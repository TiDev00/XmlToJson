   Union leader Paul Hubbert, who built
Alabama's school workforce into a political force, became the
Democratic nominee for governor Tuesday, defeating state Attorney
General Don Siegelman in a runoff.
   With 97 percent of the precincts reporting, Hubbert had 297,843
votes or 53 percent to Siegelman's 259,471 votes or 47 percent.
   Hubbert will challenge Republican Gov. Guy Hunt, a farmer,
preacher and Ronald Reagan loyalist who in 1986 became the state's
first GOP governor in 112 years.
   ``I intend to be the kind of New South, progressive governor who
will give the people of Alabama the kind of leadership they
deserve,'' Hubbert told cheering supporters Tuesday night.
   Siegelman went to Hubbert's headquarters to congratulate him,
and Hubbert supporters literally rolled out a red carpet for the
runnerup. Hubbert and Siegelman held clasped hands aloft.
   ``For those misguided souls who think the Democrats are not
together, they've got another think coming in November,'' said
Hubbert.
   Hunt had depicted both Hubbert and Siegelman as liberals who
would have a hard time winning in Alabama.
   Hubbert never ran for statewide public office before. But he has
directed the Alabama Education Association for two decades, molding
it into an influential statehouse lobby for educators, bus drivers,
janitors and other school personnel.
   Hubbert, who led a six-candidate field in the June 5 primary
with 32 percent of the vote, promised to build ``positive,
progressive programs that will raise Alabama into the New South.''
   Siegelman, the runner-up, received 25 percent to force the
runoff as he presented himself as a youthful force free of
financial ties to any interest group.
   The three-week runoff campaign turned sharply negative.
Siegelman attacked Hubbert as a special interest ``backroom
operator'' who helped teachers at the expense of schoolchildren.
Hubbert stressed his record as a coalition-builder and accused
Siegelman of running a racist radio commercial.
   Siegelman said the ad was about the power and the influence of
black political organizer Joe Reed, the teachers union's No. 2 man,
not his race.
   Siegelman, 44, a former executive director of the Alabama
Democratic Party who in 1972 managed George McGovern's presidential
campaign in Alabama, tried to overtake Hubbert with an appeal to
conservative and independent voters.
   He accused Hubbert of supporting teachers so blindly that the
union gave legal representation to a convicted child molester
trying to return to classroom teaching.
   The attorney general also claimed Hubbert's campaign promises
would require doubling Alabama's $3.5 billion annual budget and
raising $10 billion in new taxes over four years.
   The centerpiece of Siegelman's campaign was a call for a state
lottery and an increase in taxes on large timber tracts to pay for
school and health programs.
   Hubbert, 54, who earned a doctorate in education, took charge of
the union when separate black and white teacher groups merged in
1969. Along with Reed, Hubbert helped the union more than triple in
size to 70,000 members, with a payroll checkoff system building
substantial political funds.
   Hubbert traveled with a mop and bucket in hand as he urged
Siegelman to clean up the campaign. Hubbert also made joking
indirect references to Siegelman's admitted experimentation with
marijuana during college.

<HEAD>Activists, Scientists, Talk Conciliation at AIDS Conference</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One evening during the Sixth International
AIDS Conference, Dr. Anthony Fauci found himself surrounded by AIDS
activists.
   It was by his own choosing. The director of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the government's top
AIDS researcher, was appearing at a theater as a panel member with
other experts and activists.
   Compared with the days of demonstrations outside the conference,
the dialogue in the theater was a love feast.
   Fauci talked about placing more women and minorities in AIDS
drugs tests and about greater community representation on
scientific committees.
   Activist Martin Delaney of San Francisco's Project Inform
confessed that the slow pace of his own drug-testing program made
him more sympathetic to government projects he had criticized in
the past.
   ``It takes a lot longer to come up with research than I thought
it did,'' Delaney said.
   Despite the week's arrests and angry confrontations, such as the
one that greeted Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan
on Sunday much of the talk within the scientific and activist
communities was of conciliation.
   Members of the AIDS community had a greater role at the
conference, appearing on panels and questioning researchers at
various sessions.
   ``Many of them are very well informed. They ask some of the most
pointed, penetrating questions. That's good for all of us,'' said
Dr. John Bartlett, who tests AIDS drugs at Duke University.
   ``I don't always agree with them,'' Bartlett said. ``But if you
judge their contributions on balance, they have been important.''
   Even those who work for agencies that often are the targets of
criticism and demonstrations lauded the activists' lobbying for
accelerated drug testing and clinical trials.
   Dr. Susan Mertins, a researcher at the National Cancer
Institute, said she was angered by activist charges that scientists
are not trying hard enough to fight AIDS. But she said the protests
also have done some good.
   ``In the big picture, they have influenced our thinking. They
have helped get things faster to the people who need it,'' she said.
   Fauci himself hammered away at the theme of harmony during the
conference.
   ``Activists bring a special insight into the disease that can
actually be helpful in the way that we design our scientific
approaches,'' he said at the closing session, shortly before
protesters shouted down Sullivan.
   Even after the noisy demonstration, Fauci was talking peace. ``I
still see it going in the right direction,'' he said. ``There is
momentum for better relationships, for a better give and take.''
   Many in the AIDS community also spoke of the importance of
cooperation.
   Pierre Ludington, a member of the American Association of
Physicians for Human Rights, said there has been ``a snowballing of
togetherness.''
   ``People are getting tired of bashing up against each other,''
said Ludington, who is infected with the AIDS virus. ``Many of us
have learned to compromise.''
   But not everyone is talking compromise. Many members of the AIDS
Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT UP, the nationwide group that
organized the daily demonstrations, remain angry and wary of the
scientific establishment.
   ``I don't think one week makes for a greater level of
cooperation,'' said Saundra Johnson, a member of ACT UP's Chicago
chapter. ``We're going to keep it up until we get what we want.''
   The hostility and suspicion were evident even on Saturday, when
many officials with the conference took part in a march billed as
``A United Call to Action.''
   Conference co-chairmen Dr. John Ziegler and Dr. Paul Volberding
appeared at the rally to voice their support.
   ``We've made a great breakthrough,'' Ziegler said. ``We're all
in this together.''
   But scattered with the applause were shouts of ``tokenism'' and
a swelling chant of ``Stop the profiteering.''

   NASA says it will borrow a fuel
valve from the unfinished shuttle Endeavour to eliminate the
hydrogen leak that has kept Columbia grounded.
   The tiny leak has delayed Columbia's astronomy mission until at
least mid-August. The shuttle was supposed to lift off May 30 with
the $150 million Astro observatory.
   A 17-inch-diameter valve in a pipe that carries liquid hydrogen
from the shuttle's big external tank to the main engines will be
replaced with one from Endeavour, NASA said Monday.
   Endeavour is under construction and is not scheduled to fly
until 1992. Only one valve was built for each shuttle. There are no
spares.
   Columbia's launch last month was scrubbed six hours before
liftoff when the leak was detected during fueling. The shuttle had
to be moved back to the hangar for repair.
   NASA plans to test Atlantis at the launch pad on Thursday,
partly filling the external tank with super-cold liquid hydrogen to
make sure there are no leaks. Leak tests normally are conducted
with helium.
   Atlantis is scheduled for a secret military mission in mid-July.
The exact date will be set Friday.
   ``We have no reason to believe we have a generic problem,'' NASA
spokeswoman Lisa Malone said. ``All leak tests (with helium) have
passed. But that was the same for Columbia.''

   It hurts, but a growing number of the nation's
arts organizations are passing up National Endowment for the Arts
grants because the money comes at too great a price _ the loss of
artistic freedom.
   ``There are a great many literary magazines that can't afford to
... act on principle. But we had to make a statement,'' said editor
George Plimpton of The Paris Review, which last week declined its
$10,000 in NEA funds.
   The Gettysburg Review last week also declined a $4,550 grant,
joining an illustrious crowd of refuseniks that includes the New
York and Oregon Shakespeare festivals and Paul Zimmer of the
University of Iowa Press.
   ``Paul Zimmer. George Plimpton. These are people of great
conscience, intelligence, wisdom and humor,'' said Liam Rector,
executive director of Associated Writing Programs of Norfolk, Va.
``It can't be taken lightly when people of this kind of
accomplishment turn down these grants.''
   Plimpton said the review couldn't accept the 1990 grant because,
in its present form, ``it is very dangerous.'' His opinion was
shared by others among the 2,000 artists nationwide who received
grant packages this spring.
   Recipients were asked to sign letters promising not to depict
``sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children
or individuals engaged in sex acts and which, when taken as a
whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific merit.''
   The clause suggested censorship to officials at The Oregon
Shakespeare Festival, which on June 18 sent a letter rejecting its
$49,500 grant.
   ``We're talking freedom of expression here, freedom of speech,''
spokeswoman Deborah Elliott said in a telephone interview Monday.
``We do not feel it's the government's role to step in and make a
decision as to what is acceptable and what is not acceptable in the
arts.''
   The guidelines were adopted as part of the NEA appropriations
bill President Bush signed into law last year amid protests over
works such as Robert Mapplethorpe's homoerotic photography and
Andres Serrano's crucifix submerged in urine. Both had received
federal funds.
   ``It's becoming a cause celebre ... (and) we're very much stuck
in the middle,'' NEA spokesman Josh Dare said. ``The legislative
restrictions have been imposed on us by Congress and now ... it's
affecting the artists.''
   Peter Stitt, editor of the Gettysburg Review, is among those who
decided to take a stand and reject the money.
   ``What you have is people of conscience who cannot sign a
document that they find repugnant, and for me that's what it is,''
said Stitt, whose review is primarily funded by Gettysburg College
in Pennsylvania.
   Dare said that of 2,000 grants to individuals and groups, about
670 responses had come in, including at least seven rejections.
   They include Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival, the
Paris and Gettysburg reviews, choreographer Ferne Ackerman of
Venice, Calif., the Theater for the New City Foundation of New
York, the University of Iowa Press and The Oregon Shakespeare
Festival.
   He said about a dozen other recipients included protest letters
along with their signed agreement to comply with the federal
restrictions.
   Taking a stand against the Congressional guidelines is hard on
artists, many of whom need federal funding to survive.
   This year's $11,000 NEA grant represents about a quarter of the
operating budget at Alice James Books, a Cambridge-based
independent press.
   ``Without it we probably wouldn't be publishing this year,''
said spokeswoman Jenney Milner. ``But our acceptance of the grant
should not in any way imply support for the (NEA) policy because
we're deadset against any censorship.''
   The situation is dispiriting for Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., who
has been an arts advocate since 1970 and chairs the House
subcommittee that oversees appropriations to the NEA.
   He would like to see the current anti-obscenity restrictions
lifted from the 1991 appropriations bill, scheduled to go before
the full House this summer.
   ``When I first came to Congress long about 1949, there was a
major confrontation over an arts exhibition sponsored by the State
Department (because) some of the artists were alleged to be
communists. Some of those artists ... were Jackson Pollock, Mark
Rothko and Georgia O'Keeffe,'' said Yates.
   ``It's the same today, except the boogey man isn't communism.
It's obscenity.''

   Vasile would like to crack down on his
workers, who have slacked off since Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu was overthrown, but he doesn't dare.
   ``If I punished them for not working hard, tomorrow they would
ask me to leave,'' said Vasile, a chief engineer at the state-run
Republica pipe factory. He gestured at an outdoor picnic table,
where several workers sat smoking.
   Vasile's problem illustrates those of the newly elected
government. It has inherited one of Eastern Europe's least
efficient economies, but cannot change the system radically without
risking a loss of support from workers.
   How important workers are to the government was illustrated June
14, when tens of thousands poured into Bucharest to show support
after a day of anti-government riots.
   Blue-collar workers, about 40 percent of Romania's labor force,
have benefited greatly from the revolution that began with the
overthrow and execution of Ceausescu in December.
   Factory employees went on strike to force Communist managers
out, then elected their own new bosses.
   ``Of course they are nicer to us, because if they aren't, we
might fire them,'' said Alexandru, 25, a laminator. Like the others
interviewed at the Republica plant, Alexandru gave only his first
name.
   The National Salvation Front, which took power after the
revolution, quickly solidified its position by reaching out to
workers.
   It increased pay and vacations, cut the work week to five days
from the six or seven common under Ceausescu. In the election
campaign, the Front promised to move gradually toward a market
economy and avoid the painful unemployment expected in other East
European countries.
   Both the Front and its presidential candidate, Ion Iliescu, were
rewarded with big wins in the May 20 elections. Now they must
figure out how to make industry more competitive without offending
the workers.
   ``It is a challenging job,'' said Eugen Dijmarescu, an economist
expected to be a prominent planner in the new administration.
   The Communists converted Romania from agriculture to industry
and it has problems typical of Eastern Europe: low-quality
production, overemphasis on unprofitable heavy industry and
inefficiency caused by central planning.
   Its equipment is even more obsolete than that of its neighbors
because Ceausescu restricted imports for a decade in order to pay
off the national debt.
   Romania's hard-currency trade balance plunged from a surplus of
$2.5 billion in 1989 to a $400 million deficit in the first four
months of 1990, mainly because of imports of consumer goods,
according to government figures.
   Official figures show industrial production down nearly 20
percent for the first third of this year from the same period in
1989.
   Among the causes are the closings of some unprofitable plants
and diversion of electricity from factories to homes.
   Plant managers say the freedom that workers feel from the old
requirement of hard work also is involved.
   ``This is how they view democracy,'' Vasile said. ``Everyone
does what he wants, but still gets full pay.''
   Stuart Dunley of the British firm Rindalbourne Ltd., which buys
textiles from a dozen Romanian factories, said many had eliminated
the unpopular overnight shift. Combined with the reduced work week,
he said, ``the effect on production is rather dramatic.''
   Dijmarescu, the economic planner, said the new government
probably would end some of the recent pay benefits.
   He said the government planned to form stock-issuing companies
in all industries except electricity, gas production, oil and
railways. The shares initially will belong to the government, but
gradually will be sold to private investors, he said, and Romania
probably will borrow money abroad.
   Factory management boards will be allowed to set wages and the
level of private ownership, and will be allowed to go bankrupt if
they cannot make a profit, Dijmarescu said.
   ``If you put the companies in such a position,'' the workers
``will be interested in making changes,'' he predicted.
   Some feel the Front will not carry out the privatization plan
because it is divided between young technocrats who favor broad
economic changes and former Communists who oppose them.
   Whether employees will go along with a market system also is a
question.
   ``Unemployment will only be when there is professional
competition, but that will only happen if privatization comes,''
said Mihai, a 28-year-old worker in a group taking a break at the
Republica pipe plant.
   The idea, he and his co-workers declared, was unthinkable.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Last week's bloody attack on the
governing Council of State has cast doubt on plans for democratic
elections this year in Haiti, where memories of an Election Day
massacre in 1987 are still fresh.
   The shooting, which left two men dead and a third wounded,
appeared intended to terrorize potential voters and show that the
civilian caretaker government cannot ensure election security.
   Two of the four gunmen wore army uniforms. It was unclear
whether they were active soldiers, but the effect was to suggest
army complicity.
   Haiti's last attempt to hold free and fair presidential
elections collapsed in 1987, when thugs in collusion with the army
massacred at least 34 voters at polling stations.
   Memories of that are etched on the national consciousness. Even
before Thursday's attack on the 19-member Council of State, many
Haitians were fearful of elections because of a surge in urban
crime and continued repression by rural police agents.
   ``Insecurity is spreading at high speed,'' said the Rev. Antoine
Adrien, a Roman Catholic priest. ``People are not going to vote in
these conditions.''
   The attack Thursday occurred in a hotel courtyard shortly before
the Council of State was to meet with political and union leaders
to discuss the crime wave.
   Labor leader Jean-Marie Montes was killed instantly and council
member Serge Villard died Saturday while being airlifted to Miami
for treatment. Political activist Emmanuel Mani was hospitalized in
satisfactory condition.
   The government announced two days of national mourning Monday
and Tuesday for Villard, an author of the 1987 constitution and an
ardent opponent of the long dictatorship of Francois Duvalier and
his son, Jean-Claude. Haitians observed a day of mourning and
partial work stoppage for Montes on Saturday.
   President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, under pressure from the United
States and other donor nations to hold elections quickly, said over
the weekend that she was determined to go through with the vote.
She said the army would double its efforts to improve security.
   But the speech did little to satisfy growing demands for the
president to take decisive action against diehard loyalists of the
Duvalier regime, who are bent on blocking the transition to
democracy.
   Some politicians have called for Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot's
resignation.
   The independent Electoral Council has scheduled general
elections for late September, although many believe they cannot be
organized that soon.
   Marc Bazin, a former World Bank official and a leading
presidential candidate, said in an interview before the
assassinations that he saw no reason to put off the elections.
   ``The longer it takes to organize elections, the higher the
security risk will become,'' he said.
   The situation in Haiti, Bazin said, is no worse than that in
Colombia, Peru or Nicaragua, which all succeeded in holding
democratic elections.
   But others argue that Haiti is different because elsewhere
people expect the army to guarantee security.
   ``Our problem is not insecurity as such, but lack of confidence
in the armed forces to protect the voter against anti-democratic
violence,'' said Louis Dejoie Jr., a former presidential candidate.
   Lt. Gen. Herard Abraham, the army chief, has pledged support for
the elections, but many Haitians believe he does not have full
control over the notoriously corrupt and ill-disciplined force of
6,000.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, a Supreme Court judge, was appointed
president in March after the fall of the 18-month military regime
of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril. The Council of State was set up as a
check on presidential power in the transition to democracy.
   It is Haiti's fifth government since Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc''
Duvalier fled into exile in 1986, ending the family dictatorship
that began after his father's election as president in 1957.
   The U.S. government cut off $70 million in direct aid to Haiti,
one of the world's poorest nations, in disgust over the 1987
election massacre. It is leading international pressure for new
elections.
   ``We've made it clear,'' said U.S. Ambassador Alvin Adams.
``You're not going to see a resumption of comprehensive,
significantly increased aid to a government which is not
democratically elected.''
   But there is concern that security fears will keep most voters
home, making it impossible to elect a government with broad support.
   ``The Haitian people do not want anymore to be driven to what
somebody else wants,'' said Dr. Louis Roy, a physician and
president of the Council of State. ``They want free elections,
elections that would be credible.''
   One obstacle to elections may have been resolved recently with
the resignation of Finance Minister Marie Violene Legagneur, who is
widely regarded as a Duvalierist. The Council of State had refused
to approve any electoral law signed by her.

   The Sandinistas are suffering an
identity crisis after their electoral defeat, trying to figure out
how to fight what they see as a rising tide of political
conservatism backed by the U.S. dollar.
   It is a fight for their political lives and they know it.
   ``We took power by the gun and lost it at the ballot box,'' said
a Sandinista official who spoke on condition he not be named. ``We
do not know how to be a political opposition party.''
   Victor Tirado, a member of the eight-man Sandinista National
Directorate, said in a recent interview that ``international
conditions have changed with the collapse of the socialist world
and the world tendency to disarmament and solving all conflicts
through negotiation.''
   As the Sandinistas confront change, leaders have proposed more
grassroots participation in the party's decisions. The party is now
holding regional conventions as a prelude to a national convention
next year at which leaders will be elected by secret ballot.
   In their analysis of their defeat in the Feb. 25 general
elections, some Sandinista leaders have admitted tactical and
ideological mistakes and other failures such as corruption.
   ``We need a moral renovation of Sandinismo,'' former Interior
Minister Tomas Borge told a group of party leaders recently.
   Luis Carrion, another high-ranking party leader, said the
Sandinistas had lost touch with peasants in some areas. He also
said the party had lost support because of its bitter quarrels with
the Roman Catholic Church.
   A key issue is the attitude the party will assume toward the new
government headed by President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
   Some Sandinistas, like Tirado, say the time of confrontation has
passed and the party should negotiate. Others argue for a
continuation of the revolutionary hard line.
   In the pages of the party newspaper Barricada, Sandinista
ideologues still cite ``irreconcilable class differences'' as
justification for not cooperating with the new government.
   ``What we have in power now is a bourgeoisie, pro-Yankee
government,'' wrote Edgard Orozco. ``The idea of killing Sandinismo
is moving rapidly. They are trying to kill politically and
ideologically a series of concepts, ideas and programs that surge
as a true revolutionary identity...''
   The end of the military draft is seen as a major blow against
the party since all draftees had had to undergo Sandinista
political education as well as military training.
   Mrs. Chamorro abolished the draft when she took office on April
25, ending more than a decade of Sandinista rule. She announced
last week that the army would be reduced by about half _ to 41,000
soldiers _ by Aug. 3.
   The new government is also making changes in the educational
system that the Sandinistas see as a threat to their survival.
   The U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) will help
pay for new school books that eliminate references to Sandinista
heroes and U.S. imperialism, according to government and U.S.
Embassy officials.
   ``The Sandinistas thought that history began with them,'' said
poet Pablo Antonio Cuadra, a director of the Chamorro family
newspaper, La Prensa, and critic of the Sandinistas.
   ``Their worst damage was to the Nicaraguan character,'' he said.
``They tried to impose an ideology and politicize generations. They
ruined our educational system.''
   Cuadra says it will take years to repair the damage, but
Nicaragua must be careful that it does not return to the
exploitation of the pre-revolutionary dictatorships.
   ``We must study the experiences left by Sandinismo,'' he said.
``How far can we go before freedom gives room to exploitation? How
can the state be a watchman over the economy?''

an area twice the size of New Hampshire, according to a government
minister.
   Science and Technology Secretary Jose Goldemberg said Monday
that about 8 percent of the 2 million-square-mile wilderness has
been destroyed, the government news agency Agencia Brasil reported.
   Earlier estimates had ranged from 5 percent to 20 percent.
   Goldemberg was quoted as saying that the destruction of the
Amazon was proceding at a ``frightening'' rate.
   He presented the new figures at the opening of the 6th Symposium
on Remote Sensor Tracking in Manaus, an Amazon jungle city 3,000
miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   He said the data was obtained from Brazil's Space Research
Institute and was based on 222 satellite photographs of the rain
forest. The margin of error was 20 percent, Goldemberg said.
   The greatest rise in devastation last year occurred in the state
of Amazonas, of which Manaus is the capital. More than 11,000
square miles of forest were destroyed there last year, according to
the institute's figures.
   Most of the devastation was by farmers and ranchers who burned
huge tracts of land for cattle grazing or farming.

   Two gunmen sneaked into a hospital and
killed a suspected Mafia boss with at least 20 gunshots as he lay
in bed, an Italian news agency reported.
   The two gunmen entered the Santa Maria dell'Olmo hospital in
Cava dei Tirreni, about 30 miles southeast of Naples, on Monday by
climbing through a window on the first floor.
   They went to the fourth-floor room of Giuseppe Oliviero, 44, and
shot him with their pistols before escaping, the ANSA news agency
reported.
   Oliviero had been in the hospital since Wednesday with heart
problems.
   Oliviero had a criminal record and was suspected of being the
boss of the Camorra, or Neapolitan Mafia, in the nearby cities of
Nocera and Sarno, ANSA reported.

   Americans who rushed to donate money to help victims of the
Armenian earthquake 18 months ago are responding more slowly to
last week's killer earthquake in Iran. But relief agencies said
they expect contributions to pick up.
   ``There's a hierarchy of responsiveness,'' said Dick Colenso,
associate executive director of World Concern, a private relief
agency based in Seattle. ``Something happens in Europe, there's a
very large response, Asia, a pretty good respons
down to the Middle East ... thee. When you get dynamics change.''
   Colenso said, however, that contributions will ``surge upward''
as news spreads of the earthquake's destruction.
   ``As ... you get the disaster translated into the lives of
individuals instead of mass numbers, people begin to respond. They
relate to that,'' he said.
   At least 50,000 people were reported killed and 200,000 injured
in the earthquake that struck Thursday.
   AmeriCares, a private agency based in New Canaan, Conn., brought
the first shipment of supplies from the United States into Iran on
Sunday.
   The shipment was the first of its kind to be accepted by Iran
since the hostage crisis of 1979-80, when 52 Americans were held at
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Iran is believede-scale structure in the universe.
   AWARDS: National Award for Science and Technology, 1978; Chinese
Academy of Sciences Award 1982; New York Academy of Sciences Award,
1988.
   POLITICAL DISSENT: Fang became politically prominent during the
pro-democracy student demonstrations of 1986-87. His speeches to
students at the University of Science and Technology in Hefei in
central China, where he was vice president, helped incite the
protests, party hard-liners said.
   Fang was expelled from the Communist Party in 1957, when he said
Marxist theory on physics was obsolete. In 1987, he was fired from
his Hefei university posts. In between, in 1966, he was a victim of
the Cultural Revolution purges and was sent to a communal farm for
``re-education.''
   After the June 4, 1989, military crackdown on the democracy
movement, Fang and Li obtained refuge in the U.S. Embassy.

   The U.S. aircraft carrier Midway will return to the
western Pacific on Friday for routine flight operations, nine days
after an explosion aboard killed two crewmen, Navy officials said
today.
   The cause of the July 20 blast, which also seriously injured
nine sailors, is still under investigation, said Cmdr. Mark D.
Neuhart, public affairs officer for the 7th Fleet.
   Six of the injured were airlifted last Friday to the Brooke Army
Medical Center burn unit in San Antonio, Texas, and a seventh was
still too ill to be moved. He remained in serious condition in the
naval hospital in Yokosuka, along with two others in satisfactory
condition, Neuhart said Tuesday.
   He said the Midway would leave its home port at the Navy's
Yokosuka base at 9 a.m. Friday.
   After the 67,000-ton ship returned to port on Thursday to
replenish emergency equipment and give the crew a rest, joint
exercises with Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force were canceled,
Neuhart said.
   The explosion occurred in an emergency equipment storeroom when
a firefighting crew opened the hatch to investigate smoke. Navy
officials have said the room is near steam lines carrying steam at
850 degrees for the ship's plane-launching catapult system.
   Rear Adm. Henri B. Chase, commander of the 7th Fleet's
amphibious forces, arrived from Okinawa on Saturday to lead the
investigation, Neuhart said. He said the damage was still being
assessed.
   The explosion led dozens of Japanese opponents of the U.S.
military presence to demonstrate at the gate to the Yokosuka base.
   Critics in Japan, the only country to experience nuclear attack,
contend the Midway and other U.S. ships routinely bring nuclear
weapons into Japan in violation of a Japanese ban. The Navy refuses
to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons on its ships.

the rain.
   The movie will be shown here July 3, a day before its national

   The 20th Century-Fox film originally was planned for release in
June.
   Shooting had to be moved in March to the Alpena airport after
warm weather melted the snow in Denver and Moses Lake, Wash. Then
rain plagued filming in Alpena.
   Director Renny Harlin ended up using refrigerated sound studios
in Los Angeles to simulate a Christmas blizzard for the movie,
which has Willis struggling against terrorists at an airport this

   The original ``Die Hard'' pitted the ``Moonlighting'' star
against a band of Euro-bad guys in a high-rise.

<HEAD>Rulings Send Conflicting Messages on Family Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Supreme Court decisions on abortion and
the right to die send conflicting messages on the family's role in
deciding a loved one's medical care, medical ethics experts say.
   The court's rulings Monday on parental involvement in such
issues ``seem to be going in different directions,'' said K. Danner
Clouser, a humanities professor at the Pennsylvania State
University College of Medicine. ``One seems to enhance the role of
the family and the other one doesn't.''
   The court ruled Monday that states can bar family members from
ending the lives of persistently comatose relatives who have not
conclusively made their wishes known.
   The court said casual remarks years ago by a Missouri woman,
Nancy Cruzan _ who has been in a vegetative state since an
automobile accident six years ago _ did not constitute ``clear and
convincing'' evidence that she would have wanted to die. Her family
had wanted their daughter's food and water tubes disconnected.
   The court also made it significantly more difficult for young
girls to obtain legal abortions without first notifying their
parents.
   The justices upheld an Ohio law that said minors must notify a
parent before having an abortion. The court also upheld a Minnesota
law requiring either notification of both parents or permission
from a judge.
   The rulings are consistent in putting limitations on the right
to privacy, analysts said, but they diverge on the issue of
parental involvement.
   In the Missouri case, the court said competent patients have the
right to refuse life-sustaining treatment, including food and water.
   But analysts said the ruling went against the prevailing trend
in saying the state of Missouri could disregard the course of
treatment that Ms. Cruzan's parents believed would be in their
daughter's best interest.
   ``You're undermining the role of the family and saying some
government agency or bureaucrat or impersonal law is going to look
after somebody's interest better,'' said Stuart Youngner, a
biomedical ethics professor at Case-Western Reserve University
medical school. ``I find it very disruptive ... to have the state
step in and say it knows better.''
   William Colby, the Cruzans' lawyer, said Monday that Ms. Cruzan
might be moved to another state with fewer restrictions or he may
request a hearing to present new evidence about her stated wishes.
   The Cruzans are ``hurt by the decision, certainly, and will
still try to get an audience somewhere, someone who will say, `Yes,
family is very important,''' he said.
   Many analysts interpreted the court ruling as an open door to
new state legislation. But they said such laws could go either way
_ granting relatives the right to make such life-and-death
decisions for their loved ones, or making it harder for families to
end life-sustaining treatment.
   Several analysts said they did not understand the court's ruling
because it is commonly accepted that at least in some cases,
letting an incompetent patient die is in the patient's best
interest.
   ``This seems to say that a state can rule that it's never in the
interest of an incompetent to have treatment stopped,'' said Dr.
Robert Deatch, director of Georgetown University's Kennedy
Institute of Ethics.
   He and others expressed concern about the effect of such a state
law on a comatose baby or child who had never explicitly said he or
she did not want to live in a vegetative state. They also wondered
whether a generally worded ``living will'' would meet the court's
standard of proof.
   ``We've catalogued 30 types of life-sustaining treatment,'' said
Arthur Caplan, director of the Center of Biomedical Ethics at the
University of Minnesota. ``People just can't anticipate every twist
and turn of their medical care. You can't just fill out a living
will. You must formally assign legal authority to someone who can
be your decision-maker.''
   As a result of the court ruling, said Clouser, he would no
longer merely give his wife power of attorney to make health
decisions for him.
   ``I want to type her a long paragraph about what I value about
life and when I don't want to live,'' he said. ``There is such a
thing as a quality of life not worth living, and a persistent
vegetative state is it.''

   ``Dick Tracy'' collared the No. 1 spot at the
box office for the second straight weekend, becoming Disney's
biggest 10-day moneymaker with $50.3 million in ticket sales.
   The Warren Beatty-Madonna film held its ground against the
futuristic ``RoboCop 2'' and pulled in $15.6 million in its second
weekend.
   It knocked off Disney's previous record holder for a 10-day
take, ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' according to Exhibitor
Relations Co. figures Monday.
   But ``Dick Tracy'' faces tough competition with this weekend's
release of the Tom Cruise auto racing film, ``Days of Thunder.''
   ``RoboCop 2,'' starring Peter Weller as the mechanical crime
stopper, opened in second place with receipts of $14.1 million, and
Arnold Schwarzenegger's ``Total Recall'' was third with ticket
sales of $8.3 million.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Monday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.

per screen, $50.3 million, two weeks.
   2. ``RoboCop 2,'' Orion, $14.1 million, 1,769 screens, $7,996
per screen, $14.1 million, one week.

   Weeds grow waist high around the empty
old homes where girls with bobbed hair set out tea for their dolls
and young ice skaters squinted into the sun 60 years ago.
   The old mining town is gone, its 800 or so residents forced to
move on when the Depression and cheaper copper from Chile led the
Kennecott Copper Co. to abandon its claim high in mountains.
   ``We had everything here,'' said Bud Seltenreich, 75, of
Anchorage. ``Everybody who left here said, `If that place ever
opens up again, I'm going back.'''
   This month, the Kennicott kids _ now retirement age or better _
went back.
   The gathering June 16-17 was the first reunion for the 40 or so
children of Kennicott, among the country's biggest ghost towns and
a national historic landmark surrounded by deep forests.
   Many at the reunion had never returned before. Many had lost
touch after their families moved on.
   ``With lots of people, I couldn't attach a name,'' said Frank
Morris, the son of a Kennicott paymaster who came to the reunion
from Juneau. ``But then, as soon as they spoke, there was instant
recognition.''
   They searched out their past in the rain, tramping through the
brush in borrowed boots and spikes to look for old landmarks. They
walked Kennicott glacier for fun, the way they did as children. At
night, as bulging photo albums were passed around, they wished that
life in the company town had never ceased.
   The copper mines operated from 1911 until 1938, when the bottom
dropped out.
   ``The last train out was Nov. 11, 1938 _ my birthday,'' said
Inger Jensen Ricci, who left as an outdoorsy 20-year-old and at 71
still keeps in touch with childhood friends. She helped organize
the reunion with a lodge owner who gave the group free room and
board.
   No one has worked the copper mines since in Kennicott, which is
actually a misspelling of the company name. Although quality ore
remains, the company simply walked away from its copper holdings in
Alaska.
   Machinery rusts in the moist air. The town's landmark _ a
14-story concentration mill and leaching plant _ is rotting on a
hillside. Papers and books still cover dusty office desks.
   Sixty years ago, when many Americans stood in bread lines and
abandoned the Dust Bowl in search of jobs, miners worked the
Kennicott copper pockets around the clock.
   At the rate of one bucket every 52 seconds for 27 years, almost
5 million tons of ore were sent three miles down the mountain to
Kennicott, where it was loaded onto rail cars and shipped 125 miles
to the coastal town of Cordova.
   Pay was about $100 a month _ so good that mothers encouraged
sons to forget about school and stay on with the company, which
built trim red and white houses for the superintendents, foremen
and their families.
   ``The miners worked under contract,'' said George Sullivan, a
former Anchorage mayor who was 15 when he left home in Valdez to
work at Kennicott during the summer of 1937.
   ``The more ore they moved, the more money they made. Lots of
them never even came down from the mines.''
   Five miles away was McCarthy, a collection of shops, saloons,
cafes and tent brothels that the families of Kennicott called
``downtown.''
   Kennicott children were not allowed to go there unchaperoned.
   ``It was a rough little prospectors' town,'' said Mildred
Erickson Reis, 79, who came to the reunion from Whidbey Island,
Wash. ``Kennicott was very staid.''
   She recalled listening one night as a child at the kitchen table
while her father told of a woman who was asked to leave town
because of some whispered lapse of morals.
   ``It was all formal and correct,'' Reis recalled. ``We had
Saturday night dances and I learned to dance very early. The men
wore business suits. We wore pretty dresses.''
   There were two rooms in the company schoolhouse. Children often
found themselves in grades by themselves, and teachers amounted to
private tutors. Every year at Christmas, the company gave each
child a new toy.
   At the reunion, National Park Service historians were invited to
photograph old family albums and collect oral history on tape.
   ``The town really had the feel of a resort,'' said Linda Cook,
who is putting hundreds of the old photographs into archives.
   ``One gentleman here told me no Kennicott kid ever ended up in
jail. I believe him.''

   Attorney General Don Siegelman hoped for
a strong turnout today to carry him past teacher-lobbyist Paul
Hubbert in a Democratic runoff for the right to challenge
Republican Gov. Guy Hunt.
   Hubbert led a six-candidate field in the June 5 primary with 32
percent of the vote against 25 percent for Siegelman, and remained
the front-runner in weekend polls.
   The three-week runoff has been bruising. Siegelman tried to
close the gap with negative ads, and the candidates accused each
other of racist tactics.
   Whoever wins the Democrati nomination, once tantamount to
winning the governor's office in Alabama, will face an uphill
battle against Hunt.
   The preacher-farmer in 1986 became Alabama's first GOP governor
in 112 years thanks to a split in Democratic ranks. He is favored
in the polls over either Hubbert or Siegelman.
   An estimated 31 percent of Alabama's 2.4 million registered
voters cast ballots in the primary, and analysts forecast lighter
turnout today.
   Siegelman said if voters whose candidates lost in the primary
returned to the polls today, it could spell victory for him.
   Hubbert, 54, has been executive secretary of the Alabama
Education Association for 21 years. He built the teacher
organization into one of the most influential forces at the
Statehouse.
   Siegelman, 44, a former executive director of the Alabama
Democratic Party, was state manager of George McGovern's 1972
presidential campaign. He won two terms as secretary of state and
then the attorney general's office in 1986.
   Siegelman has depicted his opponent as a man opening classroom
doors to child molesters, while Hubbert has exploited Siegelman's
admission he smoked marijuana in college.
   Siegelman accused Hubbert of using ``racist code words'' in
calling for a workfare program to replace welfare, while Hubbert's
camp said a Siegelman ad warning about a black leader's influence
amounted to ``racist tactics.''
   The black leader is Joe Reed, the No. 2 man behind Hubbert at
the teachers union.

<HEAD>O'Connor Apparently Holds Key to Future of Abortion Rights</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The future of abortion in the United States,
more than ever before, appears to hinge on the views of one woman _
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
   And her latest word on the divisive issue is cheering
anti-abortion forces while alarming abortion-rights advocates.
   The court, ruling in cases from Ohio and Minnesota on Monday,
upheld state laws making it significantly more difficult for girls
to obtain legal abortions without first telling their parents.
   Although the decisions did not directly affect the abortion
rights of adult women, the court again indicated a willingness to
reconsider its landmark 1973 decision in Roe vs. Wade that
legalized abortion.
   O'Connor cast the key vote as the court upheld, 5-4, a Minnesota
law banning abortions for most unmarried girls under 18 unless both
parents are notified or a judge's permission is obtained instead.
   She also voted with the 6-3 majority to uphold an Ohio law that
said minors must notify a parent before having an abortion.
   O'Connor provided the critical vote in a 5-4 ruling that struck
down a version of the Minnesota law that would have required
two-parent notice without allowing the judicial bypass option.
   She played the same role in July 1989 when the court, also by a
5-4 vote, gave states greater power to regulate abortions.
   How far can states go in imposing new restrictions? ``Precisely
as far as Justice O'Connor will let them go,'' Roger Evans of
Planned Parenthood said Monday.
   Four high-court members _ Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy _
seem ready to reverse Roe vs. Wade. That would allow states to
outlaw virtually all abortions.
   Four justices _ Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan, Thurgood
Marshall and John Paul Stevens _ seem determined to defend women's
right to abortion.
   Left in the middle is O'Connor, who has criticized the 1973
ruling and until Monday had never voted to strike down a state
regulation making abortions less accessible.
   She soon may get another opportunity to reassess Roe vs. Wade.
The U.S. territory of Guam recently passed a restrictive abortion
law, and the Louisiana Legislature is considering similar
legislation.
   O'Connor's votes Monday, and the thrust of a concurring opinion
she wrote in the Minnesota case, drew fire from abortion rights
advocates but praise from abortion opponents.
   ``Women still have a right to abortion, but that right is
becoming emptier and emptier,'' said Janet Benshoof of the American
Civil Liberties Union.
   Gary Bauer, president of the anti-abortion Family Research
Council said, ``These two cases represent further evidence that Roe
vs. Wade will sometime soon slip into the history books as an
ill-fated Supreme Court decision.''
   O'Connor's pivotal role could change if the court's makeup
changes before the next abortion test case arrives. In that event,
President Bush's first appointment to the high court would carry
enormous impact for the future of abortion.
   Alluding to that fact, Kate Michelman of the National Abortion
Rights Action League said, ``The threat to overturning (the right
to abortion) is as close as the next Supreme Court vacancy.''
   Monday's decisions offered these guidelines for states seeking
to enact parental notification laws:
   _States may require that both parents be notified only if a
judicial bypass option is included.
   _Even requiring notice to one parent must be accompanied by an
alternative that allows a girl to avoid telling her parent if she
can prove to a judge it would be against her best interest.
   _The girl may be required to prove by ``clear and convincing''
evidence, not by just a ``preponderance'' of the evidence, that she
is mature enough to make the decision on her own.
   _Doctors personally may be required to notify the parents.
   _States may require that parental notice occur at least 48 hours
before an abortion is performed.

   Forty-one states and the District of Columbia
have ``living will'' laws that allow individuals to make their
wishes about medical treatment known in advance of a crisis that
may render them unable to speak.
   The Supreme Court ruling Monday indirectly supported living
wills by saying the Constitution guarantees a competent person a
right to refuse medical treatment.
   Eight states are considering bills that would enact such
statutes. Only South Dakota has no statute and no pending
legislation, according to the Society for the Right to Die.
   The eight states considering living will measures are
Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.

   Here is a chronology of the Supreme Court's
major abortion decisions:
   _Jan. 22, 1973. In Roe vs. Wade, the court for the first time
legalized abortion nationwide. The court based its 7-2 ruling on a
woman's constitutional right to privacy.
   The court said a woman's decision to have an abortion during the
first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor.
It said states may interfere in the abortion decision during the
second trimester only to protect the woman's health, and may take
steps to protect fetal life in the third trimester. State authority
to regulate abortions after the first trimester was not made
absolute, however.
   _Jan. 22, 1973. In Roe vs. Bolton, the court that same day
struck down by a 7-2 vote restrictions on facilities that could be
used to perform abortions. The decision gave rise to a new kind of
medical facility, the abortion clinic.
   _July 1, 1976. In Planned Parenthood vs. Danforth, the court, by
a 6-3 vote, said states cannot give husbands veto power over their
pregnant wives' decision to abort their pregnancies. By a separate
5-4 vote, the court said that neither can parents of minor, unwed
girls be given an absolute veto.
   _June 20, 1977. In Maher vs. Roe, the court, 6-3, ruled that
states have no legal obligation to pay for ``non-therapeutic''
abortions.
   _Jan. 9, 1979. In Colautti vs. Franklin, reached by a 6-3 vote,
the court reaffirmed its intention to give doctors broad discretion
in determining the timing of ``fetal viability'' _ when a fetus can
live outside the mother's womb. The justices said states may seek
to protect a fetus that has reached viability but that
determination is up to doctors, not courts or legislatures.
   _July 2, 1979. In Bellotti vs. Baird, the court by an 8-1 vote
elaborated on its parental consent decision of 1976. It said states
may be able to require a pregnant, unmarried minor to obtain
parental consent to an abortion so long as the state law provides
an alternative procedure to parental approval, such as letting the
minor seek a state judge's approval instead.
   _June 30, 1980. In Harris vs. McRae, the so-called Hyde
Amendment was upheld by a 5-4 vote. The court said the federal
government and individual states are under no legal obligation to
pay for even medically necessary abortions sought by women on
welfare.
   _March 23, 1981. In H.L. vs. Matheson, the court ruled by a 6-3
vote that states may require doctors consulted by some young girls
_ those still dependent on their parents and too ``immature'' to
decide such matters for themselves _ to try to inform parents
before performing a requested abortion.
   _June 15, 1983. In three decisions called City of Akron vs.
Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Planned Parenthood of Kansas
City vs. Ashcroft and Simopolous vs. Virginia, the court, 6-3, said
states and local communities may not require all abortions for
women more than three months pregnant to be performed in a hospital.
   The court also struck down regulations that, among other things,
imposed a 24-hour waiting period between the signing of an abortion
consent form and the medical procedure and required doctors to tell
women seeking an abortion that a fetus is a ``human life.''
   _June 11, 1986. In Thornburgh vs. American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the court voted 5-4 to strike down
Pennsylvania abortion regulations somewhat similar to those it
invalidated in 1983. The court said states may not require doctors
to inform women seeking abortions about potential risks and about
available medical assistance benefits for prenatal care and
childbirth.
   The court also struck down requirements that doctors performing
third-trimester abortions, which are rare, use procedures least
risky to a fetus capable of surviving outside the womb, and that
two doctors always be present for abortions performed in the third
trimester. Also invalidated was a regulation requiring doctors to
make a record, which could become available to the public, of every
abortion they perform.
   _July 3, 1989. In Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, the
court gave states greater power to make abortions harder to get. By
a 5-4 vote, the court ruled in a Missouri case that states may
require doctors to determine through various testing whether a
fetus at least 20 weeks old is ``viable,'' or capable of living
outside the womb.
   The court also said states may ban any public employee from
performing or assisting in most abortions and that states may ban
the use of any public hospital or other facility for performing
most abortions.
   _June 24, 1990. In Ohio vs. Akron Center for Reproductive Health
and Hodgson vs. Minnesota, the court allowed states to impose
regulations making it more difficult for girls to obtain abortions
without first notifying their parents.
   The court said a state may require notice to both parents of an
unmarried girl under 18 who is dependent on at least one of the
parents as long as the state law lets the girl avoid telling either
parent by getting a judge's permission for the abortion.

<HEAD>Lizhi's Release Fails to Persuade Congressional Skeptics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's release of dissident Fang Lizhi,
praised as a positive step by the Bush administration, apparently
is doing little to change minds in Congress about warming relations
toward Beijing.
   The astrophysicist's release on Monday from the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing, where he had been living in asylum for the past year, was
welcomed at the White House and on Capitol Hill.
   But while presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater hailed it as
``a farsighted significant step that will improve the atmosphere
for progress in our bilateral relations,'' congressional skeptics
remained unpersuaded.
   ``While I am pleased by Professor Fang's release, I continue to
be concerned about the lack of freedom available to millions of his
fellow citizens,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, a leading critic of Bush's China policy.
   Mitchell said he would continue efforts to head off an extension
of most favored nation trade status for China, which Bush recently
ordered, although it is considered unlikely that lawmakers can
muster the necessary two-thirds vote.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Asia subcommittee, said the release removes an important
``symbolic irritant'' in U.S.-Chinese relations.
   ``But it does not alter the opinion of the American public or
the U.S. Congress as to the oppressive nature of the Chinese
regime,'' he said.
   ``It is far from clear that his release marks a significant
turning point for the hundreds of courageous dissidents still
imprisoned, silenced or in hiding in China,'' Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., said.
   ``Until far greater progress is made, there continues to be no
justification for the Bush administration's decision for granting
most favored nation trade status to the brutal and repressive
Chinese regime,'' Kennedy said in a statement.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., used the occasion to
claim victory for Bush's much-criticized China policy.
   ``It is a small but significant step toward the path that we
want China to take _ the path of reason and the path of reform,''
Dole said in a brief floor speech. ``It is also one bit of tangible
evidence that President Bush is on the right track in the way he is
managing U.S.-Chinese relations.''
   Fang took refuge at the embassy in Beijing last year after the
Chinese government's brutal crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators in and around Tiananmen Square. His continuing
presence became an issue in the two countries' faltering relations.

<HEAD>Use Common Sense With Food Safety, USDA Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is prudent for Americans to be concerned
about food safety, but there's no need to go overboard about it, a
senior Agriculture Department official says.
   ``Prudence demands that we examine every threat to the food we
eat and the water we drink,'' Deputy Secretary Jack C. Parnell
said. ``That is why the (department) and other agencies are
continually developing new tests to prevent harmful chemical
residues in food from reaching consumers.''
   But Parnell told a conference on food and nutrition here Monday
that the comments of some groups demanding tougher federal
regulations make him wonder.
   ``I get the feeling that the only things that would make them
happy is if we shot down every crop duster, arrested every
toxicologist and sent every college student majoring in chemistry
to a re-education camp,'' he said.
   Parnell said there is a better way and that the USDA and other
agencies are using it.
   ``We will make sure that good health is promoted not by
requiring foods to be pesticide-free, but by making certain that
levels are no greater than what is considered absolutely safe based
on scientific measurement,'' he said.
   ``Science isn't perfect,'' Parnell said. ``Scientists can make
mistakes and they can miscalculate. But they are light years ahead
of rumor, hysteria and passions of the moment.''
   Parnell said irrational fears about chemicals and food safety
could drive up the costs of farm production and lead to higher
prices at the grocery store.
   ``If we react carelessly, without science, in response to
imagined risks, and thereby needlessly increase food costs, the
poor will be the first to notice reduced buying power and higher
nutrition costs,'' he said.
   The efficiency of farmers _ productivity _ has more than doubled
in the last 40 years, he said, and chemicals have played a role in
``this American victory over hunger.''
   Parnell, who was director of the California Department of Food
and Agriculture before becoming USDA's No. 2 official last year,
said it has been ``American agriculture through inexpensive food
that has helped enormously to raise our standard of living'' and
that of many others around the world.
   On the whole, Americans spend about 12 percent of their
disposable income for food, of which nearly 5 percent is for food
eaten in restaurants and other places away from home.
   By comparison, he said, residents of Japan spend almost 20
percent of its take-home pay for food, the Soviet Union more than
25 percent and China and India over half of their income.
   But Parnell said he has noticed there is ``a group of Americans
who are not always remembered in the debate'' about the safety of
the nation's food supply.
   ``Those (are) poorer Americans who spend a much larger share of
their budgets on food,'' he said. ``There are millions of
Americans, perhaps over 30 million Americans, who spend over 50
percent of their income on food.''
   Foreign countries, including poor Third World nations, also
would feel the pinch, Parnell said.
   ``These are more good reasons to act as quickly as the threat
demands, to the extent the danger requires _ but avoid alarmist
calls for excessive or self-defeating policies,'' he said.

   Federal and state animal health authorities
have begun a campaign to check on the possibility of ``mad cow
disease'' in the United States, a disorder that has stricken
Britain's cattle industry.
   The disease _ bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE _ attacks
the central nervous system and is fatal to cattle. Officials said
Monday there ``has been no scientific evidence to date'' that it is
a human health hazard.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the Agriculture Department's
Animal Health and Inspection Service, said BSE ``is not known to
exist'' in the United States.
   The agency, he said, has barred the importation of live cattle
from Britain since July 1989.
   ``Also, over 150 federal and state veterinarians constantly
conduct field investigations of suspicious diseases and report
their findings to us,'' Glosser said.
   The national surveillance program will include USDA animal
health officials, state veterinary diagnostic laboratories and Iowa
State University.
   Initially, Glosser said, laboratories in at least 16 states will
be cooperating in the program: California, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana,
Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.
   Glosser said additional states also have requested to be
included, so laboratory specimens may be received from other
sources as well.
   Cattle affected by BSE may suffer changes in temperament, such
as nervousness or aggression, thus accounting for it sometimes
being called ``mad cow disease.''
   Other symptoms include abnormal posture, lack of coordination
and difficulty in rising, reduced milk production, loss of body
weight despite continued appetite and eventually death.
   Confirmation of the disease is possible only through post-mortem
examination of the animal's brain. There is no test to detect the
disease in a live animal.

<HEAD>`Right to Die' Ruling Leaves Open Possibility of Living Wills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court's first ``right to die''
ruling contains good news for proponents of living wills that allow
people to assure their lives are not prolonged against their wishes.
   Already adopted by most states, living will laws allow people to
specify in writing that, should they ever become mentally
incompetent and severely disabled, no extraordinary medical
treatment may be used to keep them alive.
   In its 5-4 decision Monday, the court said states may block
family members from ending the lives of permanently comatose
relatives who have not made their wishes known conclusively.
   The ruling bars the parents of a 32-year-old Missouri woman,
Nancy Cruzan, from ordering removal of a feeding tube that is
keeping the irreversibly unconscious woman alive.
   But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the
majority, suggested the court might uphold a constitutional right
to choose death for those who put their wishes in writing in living
wills.
   ``For purposes of this case, we assume that the United States
Constitution would grant a competent person a constitutionally
protected right to refuse lifesaving hydration and nutrition,'' he
said.
   Also, Rehnquist said, the court was not deciding what would
happen if a competent person designated in writing a surrogate who
would be empowered to make life and death decisions if the
individual became mentally incompetent.
   ``The differences between the choice made by a competent person
to refuse medical treatment and the choice made for an incompetent
person by someone else to refuse medical treatment are so obviously
different that the state is warranted in establishing rigorous
procedures for the latter class of cases which do not apply to the
former class,'' Rehnquist said.
   Those words were somewhat heartening to Justice William J.
Brennan, who dissented in the Cruzan ruling.
   Brennan said the majority seemed to suggest that existence of a
living will would be adequate proof of a person's intention to
choose death over life for those, like Ms. Cruzan, in a persistent
vegetative state.
   But the problem is that relatively few Americans have taken the
time or trouble to draw up living wills even though they are legal
in most states, Brennan said.
   ``Too few people execute living wills or equivalently formal
directives ... to ensure that the wishes of incompetent persons
will be honored,'' he said.
   For them, he said, ``The testimony of close friends and family
members ... may often be the best evidence available of what the
patient's choice would be.''
   M. Rose Gasner of the Society for the Right to Die in New York
said her organization will continue to lobby for stronger living
will laws.
   ``Although we're sorry for the Cruzans,'' she said, ``in terms
of the decision's effect on the law, we'll just have to keep doing
what we've been doing, which is working state by state to get laws
passed.''

<TEXT>
   A computer-navigation system to be tested by
commuters on the Santa Monica Freeway was revved up Monday but ran
into a few bumps.
   The futuristic car guidance system with digitally recorded
voices, a television-screen map display and text displays, worked
only sporadically during the exhibit for reporters at the state
Transportation Department.
   At one point during a demonstration session, a calm female voice
got out half a warning before the system crashed in an electronic
screech:
   ``Eastbound Santa Monica Freeway congested from La Brea on ramp
to ... hwonk!''
   Officials insisted the system is an improvement over traffic
advisories offered by commercial radio stations, and defended
investing in an experiment tilted to keeping people in their cars
rather than using mass transit.
   Data gathered by the state Transportation Department from
sensors in freeways, city workers and other sources is radioed to
the cars for display on a Bosch Travel Pilot system. The system
uses a dashboard-mounted 3-inch-by-4-inch TV screen to show maps of
the freeway and nearby streets.
   On Monday, the system was demonstrated on the freeway. It will
be tested in cars over the next year on a 14-mile stretch of the
freeway linking downtown to the Westside.
   By punching buttons, drivers can zoom out for an overall picture
or in on a few blocks. They can display traffic information in text
form on the tiny TV screen. Or they can listen in on messages
broadcast from Caltrans' control center.
   The latter seemed a likely preference for many motorists, given
the difficulty of monitoring the screen and the freeway
simultaneously.
   The Transportation Department, known as Caltrans, kicked in
$900,000 to see how drivers make use of the system and how they
prefer to get their traffic messages. The Federal Highway
Administration provided $750,000. General Motors Corp. chipped in
25 Oldsmobile 88s.
   Deputy U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine L. Chao, who helped
introduce the system at a news conference, said transportation
planners must look decades ahead.
   ``We are approaching the end of the national highway development
system, and we now have to concentrate more on (alleviating)
congestion,'' Ms. Chao said.
   A similar experiment, to begin soon in the Orlando, Fla., area,
will install electronic mapping systems in 100 rental cars, with
tourist information available as part of the display.
   The cars in Los Angeles will become part of Caltrans' network of
traffic sources by feeding information back into traffic-control
computers. Delivery and cab companies are expected to show
interest, and some testing will be done by commercial drivers after
state employees and hired test drivers are studied.
   Jerry Baxter, Caltrans' Los Angeles chief, said it provides more
detailed information than radio traffic reports, especially about
streets that often are faster than jammed freeways.
   That could encourage drivers to take alternate routes, easing
congestion, he said.
   ``I've been up in a helicopter a lot of mornings and you see the
freeway is bumper to bumper and the parallel arterials are wide
open,'' Baxter said.
   The Bosch navigation systems, without the processor to overlay
local traffic information, will be on the market by year's end,
priced between $3,000 and $4,000. On the test cars, the gear totals
nearly $10,000 per vehicle.
   Baxter was asked if there weren't a cheaper way to get
information to drivers, such as special radio frequencies like
those available around airports. Other reporters questioned whether
Caltrans shouldn't be concentrating on getting drivers out of cars
and into mass transit.
   He said Caltrans is also exploring all those alternatives in
other programs.
   ``This won't work for everybody,'' he said. ``But I think we've
got to try everything we can think of.''

   The Senate heads toward a purely symbolic but
difficult vote on flag burning with each side accusing the other of
exaggerating and distorting the issue.
   ``The flag protection (amendment) ... is dead, but flag politics
is just beginning,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., Judiciary
Committee chairman.
   The House last week rejected the proposal to amend the
Constitution to give Congress and the states power to ban flag
burning. That killed it legislatively, but the Senate planned to
vote on it late today anyway.
   Republicans are using Democratic opposition to the
constitutional amendment as an issue in the fall campaign and want
the Senate vote to help that along. Democrats currently hold a
55-45 majority in the Senate, which Republicans hope to reduce or
eliminate.
   ``Why are we voting on this?'' said Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.,
noting the seeming futility of the debate. Answering his own
question, he suggested that all incumbent Democrats vote for the
amendment to foil the GOP strategy of ``30-second ads'' questioning
their patriotism.
   But Republicans said Democrats were wrong in characterizing
their amendment, which is backed by President Bush, as an assault
on the Bill of Rights.
   ``What we're doing is letting a ragtag group of people who hate
this country ... to go beyond parameters that we ought to be
setting,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   ``The Senate should vote favorably on this proposal and send it
back to the House so they may atone for their earlier decision,''
said Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   The House last Thursday voted 254-177 in favor of the flag
amendment, 34 votes short of the two-thirds majority required.
House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., led the opposition and said
the House would not vote again on the issue this year.
   The amendment was first proposed a year ago after the Supreme
Court found flag burning to be a form of free speech protected by
the First Amendment. Congress approved a revised statute against
flag burning, but the court on June 11 ruled 5-4 that the new law
also violated the Constitution.

<HEAD>Marshals Seizing Public Housing Leases of Drug Suspects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal marshals are serving warrants to seize
the public-housing leases of suspected drug dealers in 19 cities
despite a court order limiting their ability to evict the tenants.
   The effort to shut down what one official called ``grocery
stores selling crack cocaine'' is part of a campaign by Housing
Secretary Jack Kemp to rid public housing of drug trafficking.
   ``We want to purge them of the criminal element and put in
decent, law-abiding citizens,'' Frank Keating, general counsel of
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said Monday.
   ``The problem is a shocking one that makes life miserable for
the men, women and children who live in public housing,'' he said.
   HUD officials originally had planned to send U.S. marshals to
seize the leases under a 1988 federal asset forfeiture law and
immediately evict the suspected drug dealers from public housing.
   But a federal judge in Richmond, Va., late last week issued an
order barring evictions, except in ``exigent circumstances,''
without giving the tenants prior notice and an opportunity for a
hearing.
   Officials said they believe the order by U.S. District Judge
Richard L. Williams empowers marshals to immediately evict
suspected drug dealers who have firearms or if there is fear the
suspect might retaliate against neighbors for calling the police.
   ``If there is firearms, if there is a large amount of drugs like
a kilo of coke, they can be evicted,'' said HUD spokesman Bob Nipp.
   The 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act specifically authorizes the seizure
of public-housing leases from suspected dealers if the apartment is
used as a place to sell illegal drugs.
   The same law empowers law enforcement officials to seize guns,
cars, cash, boats and other property of suspected drug dealers.
   But civil libertarians argued that public-housing evictions
without prior notice was unconstitutional.
   Legal aid attorneys in Richmond obtained a preliminary
injunction requiring such notification. Cary Copeland, head of the
Justice Department's asset forfeiture program, said government
lawyers were studying the ruling to decide whether to file an
appeal.
   Florence Roisman, a staff attorney for the National Housing Law
Project, charged that HUD was trying to short-circuit due-process
protections in the Constitution.
   ``A basic constitutional principle is that the government can't
take things away from people without prior notice and a hearing,''
she said.
   Law enforcement officials may be able to justify seizing
transportable items like cash without notice to prevent its
disappearance, Ms. Roisman said.
   ``But the most concrete, rooted, unmovable thing is a piece of
real estate. It's not going anyplace,'' she said.
   HUD planned this week to seize between one and five apartments
in each of the 19 targeted cities, Keating said.
   Originally, there were to be seizures in 22 cities. Officials
declined to describe changes made in the original list, which was
obtained by The Associated Press.
   Besides Richmond, the targets include housing projects in New
York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington, Baltimore, Dallas,
Hartford, Conn.; Newark, N.J.; Indianapolis; Flint, Mich.;
Charleston, S.C.; Macon, Ga.; Kansas City, Mo.; El Paso, Texas;
Omaha, Neb.; Portland, Ore.; and St. Louis.
   The original list had also included Chandler, Ariz.; Tacoma,
Wash.; and Frederick, Md.

   Ali Reza Rezapur's blue eyes looked
exhausted. He had rescued his two sisters from the debris, but lost
his parents.
   The 26-year-old sales clerk said he believed that all of the
100,000 people who lived in this city 180 miles northwest of Tehran
when the earthquake struck Thursday have been accounted for _ with
some 6,000 to 10,000 dead.
   Relief specialists aren't so sure, but they realize they can no
longer count on residents like Rezapur to help them look.
   ``They have been digging for three or four days,'' said
Christian Brauner of the German Red Cross. ``They can't do any
more.''
   Down the street, an old woman wrapped in a black chador, or head
covering, rocked herself and wailed Monday in the gateway of what
had been her home.
   Her 10-year-old granddaughter Somaya reached out her hand to
stop the woman from beating her chest.
   ``I have lost everyone,'' the grandmother cried. Nine of her
family, including two married daughters, have been killed. The
remaining members of her family, all still grief-stricken, gathered
around her on the sidewalk.
   Among them was her 2{-year-old grandson, who sat dazed in his
father's arms, sucking on a pink pacifier. His face, like his
father's, bore scabs from cuts sustained in the rubble before they
were pulled out.
   A helicopter flight over the rugged mountainous region near the
Caspian Sea showed cities, towns and villages that are little more
than fields of rubble.
   The pilot lamented that there was no way to reach all the remote
villages in time to save trapped people. Landslides have closed the
narrow roads to heavy equipment.
   In Rudbar, virtually every building was severely damaged or
destroyed.
   Latest estimates put the nationwide toll at 50,000 dead, 200,000
dead and a half million homeless.
   Rezapur said he survived the early morning quake because he was
sleeping on the roof of his parents' house.
   ``When the earthquake started, I didn't know what to do _ so I
just prayed,'' he said.
   When the shaking stopped, he stood up to go check on his family.
   ``I took one step and fell through a hole,'' he said. ``I didn't
realize the roof had collapsed.''
   He pointed far up the hillside to a gap in the houses to show
where his home had been.
   ``Then I started digging as fast as I could to get my sisters
out from under a wall that had fallen. They're fine now. But my
parents were in another room and I wasn't able to get to them for
eight hours. They were dead.''
   He said he also helped rescue four or five other people,
including his neighbor's wife.
   Many of the people in the street crowded around visiting foreign
reporters to say how much they appreciated the aid being sent from
abroad.
   The Red Cross' Brauner, who is assessing the Iranian reaction
and needs, said the country was coping remarkably well but still
needs foreign help.
   He said help from outside is important psychologically as well
as physically: ``There is nobody who hasn't lost a loved one. They
can't comfort each other.''

<HEAD>HHS Chief Says Protesters `Stepped Over the Line'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan says AIDS activists who drowned out his speech at a
conference over the weekend ``stepped over the line'' of legitimate
protest.
   ``I've been heckled before, but I've never had the intensity
that I heard there, where the clear intent was not for the
protesters to simply make a point, but ... to prevent me from
making a point,'' he said.
   ``And that is un-American, that is clearly antithetical to the
basic principle we have in this country of free speech,'' the
secretary said in an interview Monday evening.
   Sullivan dodged wads of paper and other objects thrown by
several hundred protesters who shouted and blew whistles and air
horns as he made the closing speech Sunday to the Sixth
International Conference on AIDS in San Francisco.
   Their demonstration created a deafening roar that prevented
about 6,000 people attending the conference from hearing the
secretary's nearly 20-minute speech, which he delivered in full.
   ``They stepped over the line between what is appropriate or
legitimate protest and what is inappropriate infringement upon my
right or the right of anyone else to speak and be heard,'' Sullivan
said.
   The secretary said he knew his speech would be targeted by
protesters who have criticized U.S. immigration restrictions on
people with AIDS and want the government to put more money into the
battle against the deadly disease.
   But he said he ignored advice from members of his staff to forgo
the conference and went because ``I felt I had a responsibility to
go and as a physician wanted to be to show support and concern.''
   ``It's paradoxical and contradictory for them to state so
explicitly they want evidence from the administration that it cares
and is concerned and is trying to work with them, and then once I
go there not allow me to speak,'' Sullivan said.
   AIDS activists, led by members of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash
Power, or ACT UP, staged demonstrations throughout the five-day
conference, but not until Sullivan's speech did they disrupt the
proceedings.
   Sullivan said the reason he persevered through the protest and
completed his speech ``to make the point to those demonstrators
that I will not be silenced on this issue and ... I will not be
intimidated by their antics or those of any other extremist group.''
   Arawn Eibhlyn, a member of San Francisco's ACT UP, said in a
telephone interview that Sullivan's anger over the protest is
misplaced. ``It's time to stop talking ... and time to start saving
people's lives.''
   ``He was basically being an apologist for the Bush
administration,'' Eibhlyn said. ``This administration has not shown
any commitment to ending this epidemic. It's all pretty language
... empty words.''
   The text of Sullivan's speech that was distributed to the news
media spoke of the need to find ways to work together to help
people with AIDS and prevent spread of the disease.
   He did not refer in the speech to the immigration issue that
inflamed AIDS activists and prompted dozens of groups to boycott
the conference in protest.

<HEAD>New Gun Lock to Be Provided At Cost to Groups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many of last year's accidental shooting deaths
of children could have been prevented by use of a new gun lock that
will be provided at cost to non-profit groups, a shotgun
manufacturer says.
   The deaths of 247 children aged 14 and under last year from
accidents with firearms left around the house is ``a tough
statistic,'' said Alan I. Mossberg, president of O.F. Mossberg &amp;
Sons Inc., the nation's largest producer of pump-action shotguns.
   Cablelock, which is threaded through a gun's action to make it
inoperable, is produced by Mossberg and has been included at no
extra charge with the estimated 250,000 Mossberg shotguns sold
since last October, he said Monday.
   The lock can be used on about 80 percent of the estimated 200
million handguns, rifles and shotguns owned by Americans, Mossberg
said.
   Some 15,000 locks have been sold separately since December, said
Richard M. Pelton, executive vice president of the company.
   Although the recommended retail price is $6.95, the locks will
be available this year to non-profit groups at the company's cost
of $2.46 apiece to boost their use, Mossberg said. He suggested
that the groups could use them as a fund-raising tool.

<HEAD>House, Senate Approve Amtrak Bill Without Anti-Takeover Provision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Amtrak bill, now devoid of the railroad
anti-takeover provision that President Bush vetoed, is being sent
back to the White House.
   The bill was approved Monday by a voice vote first in the House
and then in the Senate.
   The legislation caps federal subsidies for the government-owned
passenger railroad at $684 million in the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1 and at $712 million in fiscal 1992.
   In vetoing an earlier version, Bush said he accepted the
spending figures but objected to a plan that would have required
Interstate Commerce Commission approval of railroad takeovers by
non-railroad companies.
   The House voted to override Bush's veto, but the Senate narrowly
failed to get the needed two-thirds majority to enact the bill over
his objections.
   ``Because the president's concerns have been addressed ... the
current version of the bill is acceptable to the administration,''
the White House said in a statement Monday.

   The Pentagon and Congress have reached a
compromise over a requirement that the department maintain some of
the SR-71 Blackbird spy planes for use in a national crisis,
according to a letter.
   The Air Force and Congress agreed last year to terminate the top
secret program, opting instead for satellites that could provide
the same intelligence information for less money.
   But in report language accompanying a $4 billion spending bill
President Bush signed last month, lawmakers called on the Pentagon
to maintain th aircraft _ by tail numbers _ so that flight
operations could begin within 90 days of an emergency.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney criticized the provision, which
though non-binding would do serious damage to the relationship
between Congress and the Pentagon if the department ignored it.
   The Air Force and congressional committees negotiated a
compromise that Cheney detailed in a June 21 letter to Sen. Robert
C. Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   ``We will place three SR-71A aircraft and six associated
reconnaissance sensors and electronic countermeasure suites into
long-term storage as a hedge against a protracted conflict some
time in the future,'' Cheney said in the letter released Monday.

<HEAD>Barry Orders Four-Day Furlough of City Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry, seeking to offset a
projected $95 million budget deficit, has ordered a four-day
furlough for an estimated 26,000 employees and cuts in some city
programs.
   ``Once again, city employees are being asked to bite the bullet
for mismanagement of the city government,'' said David A. Schlein,
head of the local chapter of the American Federation of Government
Employees. ``The furloughs are not a solution for what is clearly a
long-term problem.''
   The AFGE represents nearly 6,000 members of the city's
48,000-member work force.
   The furlough package, reviewed by Barry over the weekend, is
scheduled to take effect in August, City Administrator Carol
Thompson said.
   The fiscal package includes new taxes on public utilities and
commercial property owners and spending cuts in human services, job
training and other government programs.
   Employees will take four days of unpaid leave on a staggered
schedule designed to minimize the impact on the day-to-day
operations. The furlough would not affect police, fire and
correctional officers or employees at D.C. General Hospital and
other round-the clock operations, district officials said. The
public school system and other independent agencies also will not
be affected.
   Under the planned budget cuts, the administration will reduce
AIDS education programs, drug treatment services, the mayor's
summer jobs programs for youth, recreation programs, street and
alley cleaning, guard service at government-owned buildings and a
variety of other activities.

   A bomb went off at a Jerusalem bus stop today,
injuring two women, police said. It was the third such attack since
Saturday and authorities issued a special alert.
   The explosion, described as small, shattered the glass-enclosed
bus shelter, said city police spokesman Uzi Sandor. He said the two
women were taken to the hospital with minor leg injuries.
   Police set up roadblocks and searched the area. Sandori said
some 30 Arab suspects were rounded up.
   The explosion was on the road that leads to Bethlehem, which is
in the occupied West Bank.
   Jerusalem Police Commander Arieh Bibi urged people to watch for
unattended packages and other suspicious objects.
   ``Let me just tell the residents of the capital to be more
aware,'' Bibi said on Israel army radio. ``The more eyes the
better.''
   It was the third bomb to go off this week in Israel.
   On Saturday, a pipe bomb placed in a trash can on a Dead Sea
beach exploded, injuring four people. Three were hospitalized.
   On Sunday, another pipe bomb went off near gas tanks in the
central Israeli city of Ramle. There were no injuries or damage.
   Two other bombs were safely dismantled by police this week, one
in Ramle and one in Jerusalem.
   Last week, the United States suspended its dialogue with the
Palestine Liberation Organization because the PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat failed to condemn an abortive raid on a Tel Aviv beach on
May 30.
   Palestinians and Israelis both predicted an escalation in
violence.

<HEAD>Conferees Delete AIDS Provision from Civil Rights Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Language in a civil rights bill that would
have allowed employers to move AIDS sufferers away from
food-handling jobs is being removed from a civil rights bill
because it ``flies in the face'' of scientific evidence, proponents
say.
   The action on Monday came as representatives of the House and
Senate discussed changes made on the respective floors in the
landmark civil rights legislation aimed at ensuring the rights of
43 million disabled.
   Earlier this month, the Senate had accepted a House-added
provision placing the limit on work assignments of AIDS sufferers _
a move that was seen at the time as a major victory for Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C.
   But sponsors of the legislation, including Sen. David
Durenberger, R-Minn.; Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Thomas
Harkin, D-Iowa, argued that no such restrictive language was
necessary. They said it could not be justified in view of existing
scientific evidence indicating that the AIDS virus is not
transmitted through such casual means as the preparation and
handling of food.
   Kennedy said in a statement later that he was happy the
conferees turned back the food-handlers amendment.
   ``This amendment flies in the face of all scientific and medical
evidence and is a step backwards in our public understanding of and
compassion for this nation's AIDS crisis,'' he said.
   The Senate, by voice vote on June 6, had approved a non-binding
motion by Helms to have the Americans with Disabilities Act include
an exemption that would allow employers to reassign infected
workers from food-handling jobs.
   Helms' motion instructed Senate negotiators to accept a
House-adopted exemption when they worked out a final version of the
bill.
   But the so-called Chapman amendment, named for Rep. James
Chapman, D-Texas, was deleted from the bill during Monday's
conference committee work.
   Harkin had said earlier that the amendment would ``codify
ignorance'' about AIDS and how it is transmitted.
   The House had approved the exemption 199-187 last month before
it finally passed the entire act 403-20. The Senate passed the bill
76-8 last September.
   The conference report is expected to go first to the Senate,
possibly as early as Wednesday, and then to the House, and sponsors
said they expected final congressional passage before a Fourth of
July recess.
   The House had adopted the amendment even though Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said it was unnecessary. The
White House had not spoken out against the amendment, however,
although it specifically endorsed another, unrelated change.
   It was endorsed by the restaurant and food-service industry as
well as by the National Federation of Independent Business, a chief
critic of the entire disabilities bill.

<TEXT>
   Before the decade is out, you'll be able to pull
a telephone from your overcoat and make a call from anywhere on
Earth.
   Motorola Inc. announced plans today to build a satellite-based
cellular phone system that would allow users of a portable,
25-ounce phone to make and receive calls in regions where phone
service is troublesome or unavailable.
   Current portable phones cannot be used in many areas because
they rely on radio antennas atop buildings or towers being close
enough to relay a signal.
   Motorola's Iridium system, under development since 1987 and
expected to be fully operating by 1996, envisions a constellation
of 77 satellites to relay calls. Motorola said it hopes to charge
less than $3,500 for each phone.
   Motorola, the world's largest maker of cellular phones, is the
first company to announce plans for such a system.
   ``What we have done is put together a concept that allows, for
the first time, personal communications to occur anywhere in the
world,'' said Durrell W. Hillis, general manager of Motorola's
satellite communication division.
   John Pemberton, an analyst with the research firm Gartner Group
of Stamford, Conn., said American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is
believed to be working on plans for a cellular system that would
use two giant satellites.
   The Iridium system could be used in nations where conventional
telephione service is poor, such as in Eastern Europe, Hillis said.
   Iridium phone users could place a call directly to anyone with
an Iridium phone, and their calls also could connect with a
conventional, land-based phone system.
   The system will cost about $2 billion to develop, and the cost
will be shared by four or five partners that have not yet been
chosen, Hillis said.
   Motorola said it has signed with three satellite operators to
explore constructing the system.
   The satellites would be 475 miles above the Earth, considered a
low orbit. That would ensure that each point on the Earth's surface
would be in a continuous line of sight with a satellite.
   Iridium users would be given personal phone numbers, and someone
wanting to reach users would not need to know their location,
Motorola said.
   Since Iridium phones would be incompatible with conventional
cellular systems, a user probably would need to carry both types of
phones to always be in contact. Hillis said he envisions the
development of phones compatible with both systems.
   Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., has wide experience in
satellite communications and has made communications equipment for
every U.S. space mission, Hillis said.

   The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen
Tuesday, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rebounded
sharply.
   The dollar closed at 155.23 yen, down 0.39 yen from Monday's
155.62-yen finish. It opened at 155.30 yen and ranged between
154.98 yen and 155.43 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 447.58 points, or
1.44 percent, closing at 31,571.77. The index fell 570.38 points on
Monday.
   The Nikkei's recovery in part reflected relatively little
arbitrage selling between the spot and the futures markets
following Monday's large arbitrage-linked drops, said Akihiro
Sezaki, a trader with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru Securities Co.
   ``Also helping the Nikkei's recovery was the yen's stability
today,'' he said.
   But Sezaki said the majority of market players were reluctant to
buy agressively because of uncertainties over the U.S.-Japan trade
talks taking place in Tokyo.
   Those talks also put a damper on currency trading, said Akiyoshi
Sakai, a dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo. The two sides are
expected to struggle to reach agreement on an increase in Japan's
public works spending.
   The dollar's lower level in Tokyo reflected selling by dealers
attempting to take profits from its overnight rise in New York,
dealers said. In New York, the dollar closed at 155.40 yen on
Monday, up from 154.90 yen Friday.
   ``Investors in Southeast Asian markets were actively selling the
dollar, but then trading became mixed as other investors started to
pick up the currency when it fell,'' Sakai said.

<TEXT>
   A judge threw out a plea bargain as too generous
and ordered a warehouse owner to stand trial for rigging a shotgun
booby trap that killed a teen-age intruder.
   ``What's next, punji sticks, Claymore mines, bouncing betties?''
District Judge Richard Spriggs said Monday.
   A prosecutor and Philip Connaghan's lawyer had reached an
agreement under which the 24-year-old from Arvada would plead
guilty to reckless manslaughter and violating the state booby-trap
law.
   In exchange, he would have served no jail time and his record
would have been wiped clean. Manslaughter carries up to eight years
in prison, while the other offense is punishable by a fine up to
$5,000 and a year in jail.
   But the judge tossed out the agreement and ordered a trial on
the charges by Dec. 24.
   The death of 19-year-old Michael McComb ``is non-justifiable,
and to me deferred judgment does not seem warranted,'' Spriggs
said. A booby trap ``is a deadly device without mercy or
distinction, brutally savage and inhumane.''
   District Attorney Norm Early and defense attorney Bob Ransome
had argued that Connaghan's warehouse had been repeatedly
burglarized and that he had tried other means of thwarting burglars
before setting the trap.
   The booby trap killed McComb when he broke in with three
juveniles April 14. He died of a blast to the chest. The juveniles
were not hurt.
   Authorities said McComb had burglarized the warehouse at least
once before.
   Connaghan set two shotgun booby traps there after a break-in in
January. During another burglary in March, one booby trap was
tripped but malfunctioned.
   He dismantled one of the traps but told authorities he forgot to
disarm the other.

   Fang Lizhi's departure for a safe haven in
Britain leaves China without a prominent dissident with the courage
and stature to speak out against the government.
   A year after tanks crushed the pro-democracy movement, China has
effectively silenced all open dissent through arrests, intimidation
and forced exile.
   Fang refrained from speaking out during his year of refuge in
the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. But as long as he stayed in China _
outside the grasp of a government that sought to try him as an
instigator of unrest _ he remained a symbol of resistance to
political oppression.
   Now the 54-year-old astrophysicist and his activist wife Li
Shuxian join a growing list of dissidents who have escaped the
country or been banished.
   Most have been frustrated by lack of funds, poor organization
and an inability to make their voices heard where it counts _ at
home in China.
   The decision to allow Fang and his wife to leave the country
came one week after China similarly dispatched another well-known
advocate of democratic reform, Taiwanese singer Hou Dejian.
   Hou, who defected to the mainland from Taiwan in 1983, played a
key role in negotiating the evacuation of students from Tiananmen
Square during the June 4, 1989 military assault theat crushed the
pro-democracy movement.
   He hid in the Australian Embassy for two months before the
Chinese promised he would not be arrested, emerging to become one
of the few Chinese willing to openly criticize the government.
   Hou and two other companions from Tiananmen _ activists Gao Xin
and Zhou Duo _ finally went too far when they tried to hold a news
conference for foreign journalists on May 31 to call for the
release of political prisoners. All three disappeared hours before
the news conference.
   Police released Gao and Zhou, who had previously spent months in
prison, after the anniversary of the June 4 crackdown had passed.
But Hou was taken out to sea, put on a Taiwanese fishing boat and
returned to Taiwan.
   Also Monday, China announced that another dissident arrested
last summer, Wang Xuezhi, was being released from a Canton prison
and allowed to go abroad to rejoin his French wife.
   China appears to have concluded that exiling dissenters such as
Fang and Hou serves both to ease Western criticism of China's human
rights record and diminish their ability to influence opinion at
home.
   Those who left or escaped after the military crackdown _ people
like student leader Wu'er Kaixi, political scientist Yan Jiaqi and
entrepreneur Wan Runnan _ say they fear the world is gradually
losing interest in China.
   Liu Binyan, a journalist and maker of film documentaries who has
been living in exile in the United States for two years, said in a
recent interview that he longs to return home, but thinks he might
face arrest.
   ``This is a very important time in China,'' he said. ``I want to
go back and experience everything myself. Even if I can't write
about it.''
   Those released from prison in recent months as China seeks to
improve its image abroad have sought the safety of silence. Almost
all, under police orders, have avoided political activities and
stayed away from foreign reporters.
   ``Coming back home was like a dream,'' said journalist Dai Qing
when she was freed in May after being imprisoned for 10 months.
   But Dai, one of the free spirits of China's tightly controlled
mass media, said she could say no more. Speaking to a foreign
reporter without permission would mean a return to prison.

<HEAD>Liberian Rebels Pull Out of Peace Talks, Threaten Attack on
Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberian rebel forces have broken
off peace talks with the government and are threatening to attack
the capital of Monrovia, a top rebel spokesman says.
   The National Patriotic Front withdrew Monday from peace talks in
Freetown, Sierra Leone, after Liberian President Samuel Doe failed
to meet rebel demands, said Thomas Woewiyu, chief negotiator for
the rebels.
   ``President Doe has provided no satisfactory response to our
demands and we see no reason to go to Freetown,'' Woewiyu said in a
telephone interview.
   The rebel forces, led by a former Doe official, Charles Taylor,
will continue their offensive against Monrovia, Woewiyu said.
   Rebel soldiers have moved to within 15 miles of the capital, and
Taylor has said he could capture this capital city of 400,000
residents in 12 hours.
   In Monrovia, Doe was to have made a televised speech to the
nation Monday evening announcing further concessions to the rebels.
But officials said Doe canceled the broadcast, apparently after
hearing the rebels would not attend the talks unless he resigned.
   Doe has made several concessions to rebel demands in recent
days, including legalizing opposition parties, granting amnesty to
government opponents and dropping embezzlement charges against
Taylor.
   Taylor, who once headed Liberia's General Services
Administration under Doe, was charged with embezzling $1 million
from the government and fled to the United States in 1983. He was
to be extradited to Liberia when he escaped and made his way back
to Africa.
   Taylor launched the insurgency from neighboring Ivory Coast last
December and his forces now control most of the country. Taylor has
demanded that Doe step down or face an assault on the capital. Doe
came to power in a violent 1980 coup.

<HEAD>Arkansas Mass Murderer, Texas Killer Executed After Refusing
Appeals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   R. Gene Simmons, who murdered 14 relatives
and two other people in a Christmastime 1987 rampage, was put to
death by injection after refusing all appeals and pleading for a
swift execution.
   Simmons, 49, was pronounced dead at 9:19 p.m. after a brief
statement: ``Justice delayed finally be done is justifiable
homicide.''
   In Texas, James Smith, 37-year-old former taxi driver and
tarot-card reader who killed a Houston businessman man in 1983, was
executed by injection at 12:31 a.m. today. He, too, had refused all
appeals.
   ``I go to my death without begging for my life,'' he said in a
statement. ``I will not humiliate myself. I will let no man break
me.''
   The two executions brought to 132 the number of people put to
death since the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976 allowed states to resume
use of capital punishment.
   The execution of Simmons was the second in Arkansas in a week.
The June 18 electrocution of John Edward Swindler was the state's
first execution in 26 years.
   Unlike Swindler, Simmons was convicted after the state's method
of execution was changed to lethal injection.
   Simmons shot, clubbed, shot at or strangled 21 people, 16 of
whom died. The dead included his wife, Becky, four of his
daughters, three of his sons and four of his grandchildren. Eight
victims were children, ages 1 to 17.
   The killings were believed to have occurred between Dec. 22 and
Dec. 28, 1987.
   After his first conviction, Simmons said he would not appeal and
asked that no one interfere. ``I only ask for what I deserve,'' he
told the court. ``Let the torture and suffering in me end. Please
allow me the right to be at peace.''
   Death penalty foes intervened and delayed Simmons' execution for
about two years.
   Simmons went to his death without giving a motive for the
slayings. When he was arrested at the end of the killing spree, he
reportedly told a woman he had held hostage, ``It's all over now.
I've gotten everybody who wanted to hurt me.''
   In Texas, Smith was put to death in Huntsville for the slaying
of Larry Rohus. He winked, smiled to reporters and muttered ``Hare
Krishna'' as he was injected.
   He denied being a killer and said that when people ``wake up to
the reality of executions the price to be paid will be a dear one.''
   Witnesses said Smith showed up at Rohus' insurance office and
demanded money. When Rohus, 44, complied and began walking away,
Smith summoned him back, then shot him through the heart as Rohus
begged for his life.
   Smith came within six hours of dying in 1988 before death
penalty opponents persuaded his mother to seek legal help to save
her son. The U.S. Supreme Court stayed the execution.
   However, in a recent ruling in an Arkansas case, the high court
said that inmates have the right to refuse appeals and may
volunteer to be put to death.
   Smith's mother, Alexine Hamilton, failed again last weekend to
delay her son's death when a Texas appeals court and a federal
judge rejected arguments that Smith is incompetent to decide
whether he should die.
   Smith said last week that he wants to die because ``do-gooders''
already have robbed him of time in the next world.
   ``After all this unnecessary suffering and abuse here on death
row, I'm not going to change my mind,'' Smith said.
   On Monday, Smith was re-evaluated by a psychiatrist and
pronounced competent, Assistant Texas Attorney General Bob Walt
said.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 13th graf pvs, `In 1972 ...' to CLARIFY that Reform
Judaism was first major branch to ordain women rabbis.'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CARRIE FIGDOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reform Judaism, the most liberal of the
religion's three main branches, broke with 4,000 years of Jewish
tradition and voted to accept gay and lesbian rabbis. But it
stopped short of endorsing homosexual unions.
   The decision Monday by the 1,550-member Central Conference of
American Rabbis makes Reform Judaism the biggest religious group to
officially recognize homosexual clergy. The decision applies in the
United States and Canada.
   Participants said Reform Judaism already has rabbis who are
homosexual and that the vote merely recognizes reality.
   ``It's a breakthrough for our Reform movement,'' said Rabbi Yoel
Kahn of Sha'ar Zahav in San Francisco, a primarily homosexual
congregation.
   ``It is certainly a breakthrough for gay and lesbian Jews and I
think it's an important step for religious liberalism in this
country.''
   There are about 1.5 million Reform Jews worldwide, including
about 1.3 million in the United States.
   The voice vote came after 45 minutes of debate at the
conference's 101st annual convention, attended by about 500 rabbis.
A 17-member committee studied the issue four years before issuing a
report endorsing gay and lesbian rabbis.
   Jewish law, embodied in the Torah and other texts, condemns
homosexuality as an abomination.
   But ``out of concern for human dignity one is permitted to
violate the prohibitions of Torah,'' said Rabbi Samuel Karff of
Houston, conference president and a member of the committee.
   The committee's minority inserted a statement affirming that
homosexual unions can fulfill a Jew's religious duty to create a
traditional Jewish home. But the report states that heterosexual
marriage remains the Jewish ideal.
   In Reform Judaism, many Jews do not observe traditional dietary
laws or cover their heads in prayer. These among key differences
with Conservative and Orthodox Jews.
   The Union of American Hebrew Congregations, which represents
Reform Jewish congregations, overwhelmingly endorsed homosexual
rabbis last fall.
   In 1972, Reform Judaism became the first major branch to ordain
women rabbis.
   Some Reform rabbis said they will push for greater acceptance of
homosexuality in their congregations. More traditional rabbis said
Reform Judaism has gone far enough and they are not comfortable
endorsing gay role models.
   ``I am not here to state that homosexuality is a sin ... but
that there are individuals who are not appropriate as rabbis,''
said Rabbi Philip Bregman of Temple Shalom in Vancouver, British
Columbia.
   ``It's a first step. ... I'm hoping we'll be able to do more
education to build a foundation of more support and education about
gay and lesbian Jews and rabbis,'' said Rabbi Denise Eger, lesbian
leader of Beth Chayim Chadashim, a primarily homosexual
congregation in Los Angeles.
   In its report, the conference recognized that many congregations
might find themselves unable to accept gay or lesbian rabbis. The
conference helps place rabbis in congregations, but congregations
can dismiss them.
   ``We do not encourage our gay and lesbian colleagues to come out
of the closet because we cannot protect them,'' Karff said.
   The Conservative Jewish movement has had women rabbis since 1985
but does not openly accept homosexual rabbis. Orthodox Judaism
opposes ordination of women or homosexuals as forbidden by Jewish
law.
   Judaism's smaller Reconstructionist movement and the Unitarian
Universalist church openly accept homosexual clergy, and some other
Christian denominations approve ordination of homosexuals if they
remain celibate.

<TEXT>
   A river in northern Bangladesh has
overflowed its banks after the season's first monsoons, stranding
more than 20,000 people and killing two children, officials and
news reports said today.
   The Jamuna River has flooded at least 20 villages in Bogra
district, 100 miles from Dhaka, over the past three days, officials
at the Water Development Board said.
   They said many stranded people had taken shelter on rooftops of
their houses or makeshift bamboo structures erected on high ground.
About 5,000 people have been evacuated and given shelter on two
river embankments.
   United News of Bangladesh said two children drowned Monday in
Nabadari village in the district, the first casualties in the
flooding.
   The report said the swelling Jamuna flooded scores of villages
in the northwestern district of Sirajganj, affecting about 100,000
people. The people in Sirajganj are still not marooned, but they
have lost their rice crops.
   The flooding hit the northern district as rains from the monsoon
season set in last week. Flooding, an annual feature in the
low-lying delta nation of Bangladesh, claimed more than 1,400 lives
in 1988 when the country's worst flood in memory occurred.
   Flooding in Assam, an Indian state north of Bangladesh, has also
affected about 400,000 people and destroyed large tracts of rice
paddies, Indian news reports have said. No casualties have been
reported in India.

   Dissident Fang Lizhi's son says he is happy his
parents are finally free and out of China's reach.
   China on Monday allowed astrophysicist Fang and his wife,
physicist Li Shuxian, to leave the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, where
they had taken asylum a year ago. They arrived near London late
Monday in a U.S. Air Force jet.
   ``They are out of Chinese hands. Beijing cannot control them
anymore,'' their son, Fang Ke, said Monday. ``They'll be able to
see the sun, to breathe the air and maybe to see the ocean. That's
great for them. They're free.''
   The 27-year-old physics student at Wayne State University last
saw his parents in 1986 before leaving China to study at the
University of Louisville.
   The elder Fang took refuge at the embassy after the Chinese
government's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen
Square. He has been been China's most vocal dissident, supporting
student pro-democracy protests in 1986.
   The couple's release came as Congress debated whether to give
China most-favored-nation trading status.
   ``I don't think my father likes to be the bargaining chip,'' the
younger Fang said. ``He will not appreciate that he was being
used.''
   He said China should release other political prisoners who have
been jailed without being charged or tried. ``I feel happy for my
family and for their release ... but we don't know the exact number
of people still in jail,'' he said.
   Fang Ke said he kept in touch with his parents through letters
while they were in the embassy.

<TEXT>
   Donnie Wahlberg of the New Kids on
the Block could be back on stage Thursday, four days after falling
through a trap door and injuring himself during a concert, his
manager says.
   The 20-year-old singer was to be released today from Saratoga
Hospital, said manager Pete Work.
   Wahlberg, who was hurt in Saratoga Springs on the second stop of
the group's 100-city tour, will not perform Wednesday in Auburn
Hills, Mich., but may be back for a show Thursday in Hoffman
Estates, Ill., Work said.
   He crashed through the trap door late in Sunday night's concert
at the Saratoga Raceway and was treated for a gash in his chin that
needed six stitches. He also suffered cuts and bruises on his
chest, arm and mouth.
   Hospital spokeswoman Helen Edelman said Wahlberg was in stable
condition but had been put in an intensive-care unit for security
reasons. He was in good spirits Monday and spent time watching
music videos, she said.
   ``He has stitches in his lower lip, so it's trouble speaking.
But he speaks,'' she said.
   Wahlberg, of Beech Tree, Mass., is one of five New Kids, a group
known for its tightly choreographed shows and rabid teen-age
following. Among its hits is the current No. 1 single and album,
``Step by Step.''
   Edelman said about 100 fans gathered outside the hospital, some
holding banners reading ``We Love You Donnie'' and ``Hang Tough.''
   Dozens of balloons and flowers sent to him were being
redistributed in the hospital at his request, she said.

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke's
bill to ban affirmative action has been bottled up by a state
Senate committee.
   The Finance Committee voted 6-2 Monday to sit on the Republican
representative's bill, apparently killing it for this session,
which ends July 9. The House overwhelmingly approved the measure
earlier this month.
   Black legislators have called the bill racist. Duke, a former
KKK grand wizard elected from the New Orleans suburb of Metairie,
has said it ```merely prohibits discrimination in favor or against
anyone on the basis of race.''
   Sen. J.E. Jumonville, a Democrat, said the bill does nothing
because it is superseded by federal laws that allow affirmative
action.
   ``I know you are a candidate for the U.S. Senate and this makes
good political hay,'' said Jumonville. ``But are we really doing
anything? I think it's window dressing.''
   Duke said after the hearing that opponents ``pulled a dirty
political trick by sending my bill to the Finance Committee. There
are no Republicans on this committee.''
   Duke is running for the Senate as a maverick member of the
party. The GOP chose state Sen. Ben Bagert to oppose U.S. Sen.
Bennett Johnston, a Democrat who has held the post since 1972.

   The city has agreed to pay $2.5 million to
settle a lawsuit brought by the parents of the five children who
died in the 1985 police assault on the radical group MOVE.
   The settlement, filed Monday in federal court, raised to more
than $23 million the amount the city has spent as compensation
since the fiery battle.
   Police trying to evict armed MOVE members from their fortified
home dropped a bomb on the house in 1985, starting a fire that
burned down more than 60 homes. An adult and a child escaped the
house, but 11 others died.
   Deputy City Solicitors Mary Ellen Krober said the settlement was
part of the city's effort ``to put this chapter behind us if we
could.''
   Several lawsuits are still pending, including one by the only
MOVE child to survive the confrontation.
   More than $14.5 million has been spent rebuilding the
neighborhood and sheltering 250 people left homeless. An additional
$2.7 million was paid to residents who lost homes, and more than $1
million went for repairs to 82 houses.

<HEAD>Shamir: Israel Would Not Block Soviet Settlement in Territories</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G.LaBELLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said today that
Israel's policy on Soviet Jews does not forbid them from settling
in the occupied territories.
   The statement came two days after Housing Minister Ariel Sharon
suggested that Israel did not intend to settle Soviet Jews in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The immigration wave of Soviet Jews, projected to total up to
150,000 this year, has raised fears among Arabs that many would
move to the occupied territories, forcing out Palestinians.
   The United States, the Soviet Union and European countries have
all called on Israel's new right-wing government to state
unequivocally that it will not settle Soviet Jews in the
territories.
   Sharon, a champion of Jewish settlements in the occupied
territories, caught many observers by surprise Sunday when he said
Israel would not move the immigrants ``beyond the Green Line'' _ a
reference to Israel's pre-1967 borders. The West Bank and Gaza were
seized in that year's Middle East war.
   However, Shamir said this did not represent a change in the
previous policy, under which Israel would not encourage settlers to
move to the territories but would not prevent them from doing so
either.
   ``The Israeli government doesn't have any policy to convince the
new immigrants to go here or there,'' he said on Israel radio.
   ``Of course, he (Sharon) said that nobody will be sent by us to
certain territories and to certain locations,'' he said. ``But
everybody in a democratic country has the right to settle wherever
he wishes.''
   The radio report said Shamir's comments were meant to clarify
those of Sharon.
   The Hebrew daily newspaper Maariv also quoted Shamir as saying
that Sharon's statement did not apply to Arab east Jerusalem, which
was annexed by Israel after its capture in the 1967 war.
   Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc favors retaining the occupied
territories, considering them part of the historic ``land of
Israel.''
   Israeli officials have said only about 300 of the more than
50,000 Soviet immigrants arriving since April 1989 have moved to
the West Bank and Gaza. An estimated 3,400 to 4,500 moved into Arab
east Jerusalem.
   After Sharon's statement Sunday, an aide to Shamir said Monday
that the prime minister had previously sent messages to Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and European leaders offering
assurances that Israel does not have a policy of settling Soviet
Jews in the territories.
   However, neither Sharon nor Shamir stated that Israel would
block the new immigrants from joining the 70,000 Jews living in the
130 settlements that have been built in the territories since 1967.
   The State Department responded to Sharon's statement with a
cautious welcome in view of its vagueness.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said it was a ``step in
the right direction,'' but then added: ``We have seen various
reports and we don't yet have a detailed analysis.''
   Washington opposes the settlements in the territories since U.S.
policy calls for at least part of the occupied land to be returned
in exchange for peace with Palestinians and the Arab states.
   The United States also has threatened to hold up $4 million in
loan guarantees to build housing for the Soviet immigrants unless
it is assured U.S. funds will not go to settling the immigrants in
the territories.
   Shamir also said in messages to European leaders, sent last week
before the European Community summit in Dublin, that his government
wanted to reinstitute the Middle East peace process.
   The prime minister introduced a peace initiative while on a
visit to Washington in April 1989 that proposed holding elections
in the territories as a step toward limited autonomy for the 1.7
million Palestinian residents.
   However, the proposal has been stalled by Palestinian demands
that the peace process eventually lead to an independent
Palestinian state. Israel opposes creation of a Palestinian state.
   Further delay has come from resistance by Shamir's government to
U.S. proposals to hold a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue in Cairo to
discuss the election plan.

<TEXT>
   Searing heat hovered over the desert Southwest and western
Plains today, and thunderstorms were expected to move down the
nation's midsection.
   Temperatures were forecast as high as 120 degrees between
California and western Texas. The heat was caused by a combination
of warm air from a high-pressure system and heating caused by the
sun's high summertime angle.
   Today's forecast called for scattered thunderstorms from
Illinois to eastern Texas. Storms also were expected in the
Carolinas, Georgia and Florida.
   Phoenix had its all-time hottest day at 120 degrees Monday. The
previous record was 118, equaled as recently as July 4, 1989.
Tucson broke its record for the date with 113 degrees.
   The nation's high was 120, also set at Laughlin, Nev., and at
Buckeye, Gila Bend and Youngtown, Ariz.
   A tornado touched down near Magnolia Gardens, Texas, but there
were no reports of injuries or major damage. Storms produced thick
hail near Zwolle, La., and Sedalia, Mo.

   Secret Service agents acting on a tip
seized more than $500,000 in counterfeit $10 bills at a warehouse
and arrested an art gallery owner, the federal agency said.

he left the warehouse with two full boxes of counterfeit cash,
Secret Service spokesman Dave Noznesky said.
   The 43-year-old owner of the S. Eric Johnston Art Gallery

   Investigators were still counting the counterfeit money today,
and should know the exact amount later in the week, Noznesky said.
   Agents seized several plates found in the warehouse that were
used to print the phony money, Noznesky said.
   The gallery was closed Monday, and Johnston could not be reached
for comment.
   Some of the counterfeit money discovered was still in uncut
sheets and was printed at a now-defunct printing business in West
Palm Beach, Noznesky said.
   Secret Service agents have interviewed former workers at the
company, but no further charges have been filed, he said.

   An inmate was convicted of murdering two
detectives with a loaded gun he stole from a police locker when
they left him alone in a squad room.
   A jury Monday found Jay ``Stoney'' Harrison guilty of murder,
escape, grand larceny and weapons possession. He shot the
detectives last November as they drove him back to jail after
questioning in a murder.
   Sentencing was set for July 25. Harrison faces a maximum term of
life imprisonment.
   Police cited a series of procedural errors by the detectives,
including leaving Harrison alone briefly in the squad room,
handcuffing him by only one wrist and either not searching him at
all or searching him poorly.
   Since the incident, lockers have been removed from the squad
room in the New York City borough of Queens.
   Harrison, 26, was handcuffed to a pipe when he reached into a
police locker that had a broken lock and removed the loaded gun.
   With both hands cuffed in front of him, he drew the gun and shot
while in the back seat of the car of Detectives Richard Guerzon,
46, and Keith Williams, 34, as they drove him back to jail,
prosecutors said.
   Harrison fled but was arrested 10 hours later at the apartment
of an ex-girlfriend.

   Vandals have brutally attacked and killed
four prized Chilean flamingos at San Francisco Zoo, authorities
said.
   ``We're just stunned here,'' the zoo's director, David Anderson,
said Monday. ``We never thought we'd have to build a zoo to keep
people out of its exhibits _ just to keep the animals in.''
   Police are examining fingerprints from a beer bottle that was
left near a cage. Anderson said the intruders scaled a perimeter
fence and used a long metal pole to batter the animals in their
specially constructed habitat.
   Three of the birds were killed outright, sometime after midnight
on Friday, and a fourth died during surgery at the weekend.
   The birds have been a feature at the zoo for 15 years and are
worth about $1,000 each. The flamingo flock is now reduced to 28.

   A Soviet army deserter took a family of four
hostage at a camping area and was killed in a shootout with East
German police at a roadblock, authorities said today.
   The hostages were in the car with the deserter during the
shootout and escaped injury, but a police officer was wounded in
the exchange late Monday, East Germany's Interior Ministry said.
   The deserter was armed with a submachine gun and 800 rounds of
ammunition, the ministry said in a report released through the
government news agency, ADN.
   The man fled a Soviet garrison near Magdeburg and went to a
camping area outside Burg, which is about 50 miles west of Berlin,
where he abducted the married couple and their two children and
fled by car, officials said.
   A large-scale manhunt was launched, and the car was stopped at a
police roadblock, where the deserter opened fire. The gunman was
killed and a member of a police anti-terrorist squad was wounded,
the ADN report said.
   The Interior Ministry said the wounded officer was hospitalized
and the family was being treated for shock.
   Officials gave no possible motive for the incident.
   The Soviet Defense Ministry said it was investigating, ADN said.
   More than 300,000 Soviet soldiers are stationed in East Germany
but their future in the country is in doubt as the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact military alliance crumbles and the two Germanys move
toward full unification.

<TEXT>
   Cars conked out, tempers flared and air
conditioners taxed power supplies as the city hit an all-time high
of 120 degrees.
   The National Weather Service predicted the extreme heat will
last through the middle of the week.
   The temperature Monday was the highest ever recorded in Phoenix,
beating the old mark of 118, equaled as recently as July 4, 1989.
Tucson reached 113 degrees, one degree shy of that city's all-time
high.
   Hot weather plagued other parts of Arizona, including highs of
118 in Yuma, 102 in Prescott, 94 in Flagstaff and 92 at the Grand
Canyon's south rim.
   Some elderly people suffered heat exhaustion, said Steve Jensen,
a Fire Department spokesman. ``We probably had a few more
heat-related calls, but nothing major,'' he said.
   The city's two largest power suppliers urged customers to
conserve and put on extra generators to handle the demand.
   The Arizona Automobile Association's main office in Phoenix said
it took at least 1,500 service calls, up from a usual 900 to 1,000.
Most of the additional calls were from motorists whose vehicles
overheated or had dead batteries.
   Roger Austin, a police officer in Tempe, said police used
trained volunteers to respond to some calls of stranded vehicles,
freeing officers to answer domestic violence calls partly generated
by the heat.
   ``Business is up,'' he said. ``Being stranded in the heat can be
very dangerous, especially if you have small children or animals
traveling with you. These are high priority calls for us.''
   Jim Hight, a psychologist at Camelback Hospital in Phoenix,
advised people with low tolerance to heat to stay inside.
   ``Problems that seem run-of-the mill in the months of January
and February may seem a lot more complex and more difficult to
handle come June or July,'' he said.

   A 38-year-old man was gored to death today
when he tripped and fell during the annual running of the bulls in
this southwestern town, officials said.
   The running of the bulls in Coria, a town of 12,000 people 149
miles west of Madrid, is staged as part of the town's annual fiesta
dedicated to St. John. In the ritual, the bulls are turned loose
before dawn in the town's sealed-off streets, and young men race
ahead of them. The bulls are killed in bullfights later in the day.
   Many small towns and cities across Spain maintain the tradition.
But in recent years, there has been growing opposition to
bullfights and the running of the bulls from Spanish and foreign
groups, on grounds the practices constitute cruelty to animals.

<TEXT>
   Outside the downtown hotel where Nelson and
Winnie Mandela are staying, crowds chanted ``Man-del-a!
Man-del-a!'' Nearby, Debora Cates of St. Louis and her companions
shrieked ``Oh no! He's here again!''
   Cates, Kim Lingo and Bernice Gum this week are learning the
drawbacks of vacationing in the nation's capital while there's a
famous person around.
   Streets get blocked for security and for motorcades. Traffic
grinds to a halt. Pedestrians get detoured blocks out of their way.
Life gets, well, disrupted when bigwig visitors come to town.
   It happened again today when Mandela took a 40-minute walk
through the heart of downtown and into a residential neighborhood
during early rush-hour traffic.
   Mandela, wearing a New York Yankees warmup jacket and cap, was
surrounded by about 50 police and other security officers as he
left his hotel and walked about two miles, waving to surprised
onlookers.
   Traffic quickly backed up when Mandela walked down the middle of
a busy business street. Police ordered pedestrians to keep their
hands in sight as he passed by.
   Washingtonians are pretty used to it, but it can be
discombobulating for the millions of tourists who visit here each
year.
   ``He's really cramping our style, that man. It's like `Oh no!
He's here again,''' joked Cates, a 30-year-old airline worker who
was resting from a tour at a Smithsonian museum Monday.
   There have been a lot of motorcades. The African National
Congress leader stayed put after he got to his hotel Sunday
afternoon. But streets were closed off when his wife, Winnie, later
walked to a nearby church to address a program honoring South
African women.
   On Monday the couple crisscrossed the city, traveling first to
the White House for meetings with President Bush, then down to the
State Department, over to the AFL-CIO and up to Capitol Hill for
dinner.
   Cates and company first encountered the Mandela entourage Sunday
when their tour bus sat helpless in traffic. On Monday, with
Washington back at work, downtown traffic was so jammed they gave
up and walked several blocks to their hotel.
   Not every tourist was disgruntled about the disruption Mandela's
visit caused. Some didn't know he was in town. And some had no idea
who he was.
   ``I don't know what he's all about, to tell you the truth,''
said Jerry Gwyn of Mooresville, N.C., who was trying to find his
way to Arlington Cemetery. ``We learned of his visit last night on
television.''
   Olidia Thomas and Jovita Davis of Ypsilanti, Mich., also were
irritated by the stalled traffic and blocked streets that made it
difficult to get to the popular tourist sites.
   But Thomas said she took the wait in stride because ``it's for a
good cause. He needs to promote the need for support and to be more
visible.''
   ``Because Mandela is right here, we can't go into the White
House,'' joked Bart Stuurman, 19, of the Netherlands. In fact, the
White House is closed to tourists every Monday.
   Stuurman is part of a Lion's Club International Youth Camp
touring the South this summer.
   A companion, Alex Elizondo, 18, of Monterrey, Mexico, said, ``I
don't know him. I don't know anything about him,'' but then stared
in disbelief when another friend, Pedro Ulovecio, 19, explained in
rapid Spanish that Mandela had spent 27 years in prison ``for the
freedom of his country.''
   ``That's nice,'' Elizondo said.
   Hal Walls of Oklahoma City said, ``I haven't put a whole lot of
thought'' into the Mandela visit ``but there must be progress with
the fact that he's here.''

<TEXT>
   The interior minister said today that ``99
percent'' of the victims from a devastating earthquake have been
counted, but a Red Cross official said the death toll could reach
70,000.
   Officials say at least 50,000 people have been killed, 200,000
injured and half a million rendered homeless from Thursday's quake
in northern Iran.
   Bone-weary rescuers are losing hope of finding more survivors in
the rubble of nearly 350 earthquake-flattened cities and towns. But
some took heart when a 1-year-old girl was found alive in her
bedroom four days after the quake.
   Foreign aid continued to pour into the capital, Tehran. More
than 130 planes carrying relief supplies, medical volunteers and
financial contributions have arrived since Sunday.
   Much of the help comes from countries including the United
States that Iran considers sworn enemies.
   Interior Minister Abdullah Nouri said 99 percent of the bodies
of quake victims have been recovered, but said there was still no
definitive casualty count.
   Christian Brauner, a relief worker with the West German Red
Cross, said the death toll could reach as high as 60,000 to 70,000.
   Nouri, who is in charge of relief operations, thanked the
hundreds of foreign relief workers, saying their presence was
``useful.'' Some Iranian hard-liners have opposed the presence of
Western rescuers.
   French and Iranian rescue teams said an Iranian team from the
Red Crescent _ the Islamic version of the Red Cross _ found the
1-year-old girl alive in the family's wrecked home in the mountain
village of Kelishom, 30 miles east of Manjil. They had believed she
was dead, and were digging into the rubble of what had been a
bedroom believing they would find her body.
   Manjil, on the border between the stricken provinces of Zanjan
and Gilan, was virtually destroyed. It lies in the heart of the
quake zone, about 125 miles northwest of Tehran.
   Col. Gholamreza Gohari, head of police in Gilan province, said
as many as 7,000 people had died in Rudbar, a nearby town of
100,000.
   Brauner said that since large extended families live together,
the wreckage of even a small home can yield a horrifying number of
dead.
   He said in one village he visited, he was told two-thirds of the
3,000 residents were dead.
   Brauner said residents soon would need a new water system, and
insulated trailers instead of tents. ``They will have a hard and
cold winter,'' he said.
   The quake region has been jolted by about 360 aftershocks since
Thursday's jolt, some measuring up to 6 on the Richter scale,
Tehran University's geophysics center said. The main quake measured
between 7.3 and 7.7.
   For survivors, the aftershocks are a constant terrifying
reminder of the quake. For rescuers, they have foiled desperate
efforts to pluck life from the devastation.
   A French rescue team related the story of one such near-rescue.
The team, using sound detectors, picked up the sound of a knock on
Sunday morning. They quickly set to work removing debris piled
several yards deep.
   But then a strong aftershock struck, sending dirt and debris
cascading back into the excavated area.
   When the team was able to resume digging, the knocking had
stopped, said the team leader, Andre Laska. They found a woman dead
in what had once been a closet in her home.
   ``We were really, really sad,'' rescuer Francis Piat said. He
said that was the closest his team had come to finding someone
alive under the rubble.
   A team from the Soviet Armenian city of Spitak, destroyed by the
December 1988 earthquake that killed about 25,000 people, said they
had found no one alive in the wreckage of Manjil. But they said
they would keep searching.
   ``In Armenia a year and a half ago, the whole world helped our
people,'' said Movses Poghossian, the team's head. ``Right now we
are here to do the same work.''
   Fatimah Sadagriyen, a 55-year-old Rudbar woman, wept as she
described the loss of 14 family members. She had no tools with
which to dig out her shop, and nowhere to sleep.
   ``I have not seen a relief team,'' she said, her eyes welling
with tears. ``I have nothing, nothing.''
   Most foreign rescue workers said the Red Crescent was managing
to get tents for the homeless even to remote villages, but probably
not enough of them.
   Some foreign workers said the Iranians had balked at letting
them into the quake zone.
   ``They only want materials, they don't want people,'' said
Valerie Trouot, a 26-year-old French doctor of emergency medicine.
``They don't want Westerners to see how the country is.''
   But the first deputy foreign minister, Mohammed Besharati, said
foreign doctors had been welcomed.

<HEAD>Vatican Orders Theologians to Follow Church Teaching</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican said today that open dissent
cannot be tolerated and ordered theologians to refrain from
publicly challenging church teaching.
   A major document issued by the Congregation for the Doctrine of
the Faith replied in strong terms to Western theologians who have
questioned the Roman Catholic church ban on artificial birth
control, papal authority and other issues.
   ``To succumb to the temptation of dissent ... is to allow the
leaven of infidelity to the Holy Spirit to start to work,'' said
the report, approved by Pope John Paul II.
   The document defended punitive action taken against dissidents
and said theologians must adhere to doctrine whether it is
infallible or not. It rejected the notion that the church should
leave moral and sexual matters to personal choice or conscience.
   It warned dissenters against making their complaints in the
media or trying to influence public opinion.
   Last year, 170 German-speaking theology professors issued a
widely publicized statement criticizing the pope for his opposition
to contraception and his exercise of power.
   West German Cardinal Josef Ratzinger, head of the congregation,
told a news conference that the Vatican document was not a direct
response to the German declaration but addressed the general
``climate of conflict'' fomented by dissident theologians.
   During John Paul's 11-year papacy, several theologians have been
punished for straying from church positions on birth control and
other issues of sexual morality. They include the Rev. Charles E.
Curran, who was stripped of his right to teach theology at Catholic
University in Washington, D.C, in 1987.
   The 28-page document, called ``Instruction on The Ecclesial
Vocation of The Theologian'' was written by Ratzinger, a strict
doctrinal conservative and the pope's guardian of orthodoxy.
   In a blunt appraisal of the situation, the document said
theology is sometimes exposed to risks and ``moments of crisis and
tension.'' Open dissent by theologians has caused ``serious harm''
to the church, it said.
   The document said theologians might in some cases question ``the
timeliness, the form, or even the contents'' of some church
teaching. In such an event, they should try to resolve the
differences in dialogue with bishops, it said.
   However, if in the end a theologian still can not accept the
teaching, he should keep quiet, it said.
   ``Such a situation can certainly prove a difficult trial,'' the
document said. ``It can be a call to suffer for the truth, in
silence and prayer, but with the certainty, that if the truth
really is at stake, it will ultimately prevail.''
   Ratzinger's report said the church cannot be run like a
democracy, a position voiced by the pope on several occasions.
   ``Standards of conduct, appropriate to civil society or the
workings of a democracy, cannot be purely and simply applied to the
church,'' it said.

   Sikh militants masquerading as security
forces looted an armory at a railway station and kidnapped five
policemen, officials said today.
   Militants made off with 37 weapons, including three light
machineguns and 27 rifles in the raid late Monday night, said
Senior Superintendent of Police Anil Sharma.
   The raid occurred in Firozpur, 46 miles southwest of Amritsar, a
flashpoint of the militants' bloody eight-year battle for a
separate homeland in Punjab state.
   A band of rifle-toting militants entered the station dressed as
policeman, Sharma said. First they cut electricity and phone lines,
then forced their way into the armory where they looted the weapons.
   After taking the weapons, they kidnapped five policemen at
gunpoint and fled in jeeps. No shots were fired.
   About 1,200 people have been killed so far this year by Sikh
extremists in Punjab, a rich agricultural region in India's
northwest.
   The separatist movement for a Sikh homeland, known as Khalistan,
grew out of Sikh charges of political and cultural discrimination
by Hindus. Sikhs comprise only 2 percent of India's 880 million
people, but in Punjab they have a slight majority over Hindus.
Hindus make up 82 percent of India's population nationwide.

<TEXT>
   Poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition and
forced labor have robbed many of the boys and girls in India's
capital of their childhood, according to a United Nations report
issued today.
   ``Why should we call them children?'' asked the UNICEF report,
titled ``The Invisible Child.'' ``These children are grown-ups.
These children are old.''
   Citing statistics on child labor, health care, infant mortality
and education, the report describes a life of grinding work and
abuse for a child in New Delhi's slums.
   It also highlights the plight of India's urban poor, often
forgotten in this largely agricultural nation of 880 million people.
   More than half of New Delhi's 8 million people inhabit the
shantytowns, squatters huts and slums of this sprawling metropolis.
While the average per capita income in the city is about $410, in
the slums the people make one-tenth that amount, the report said.
   According to the report, more than 500,000 children, 80 percent
of them illiterate and many underfed, are forced to work in New
Delhi.
   About 40,000 work as laborers, 20,000 in car repair shops,
30,000 in restaurants and 30,000 as shop assistants, the report
said. Tens of thousands more work in one-room factories where labor
safety regulations are not enforced. Others scratch by as rag
pickers, shoe shine boys, newspaper sellers and porters.
   Child labor is only outlawed in India for certain hazardous
jobs. Many of the children are bonded labor, latter-day slaves, the
report said. The pervasiveness of such servitude makes it difficult
to wipe out.
   ``The children have to put up with long working hours, eight to
12 hours a day,'' the UNICEF report said. ``They face verbal,
physical and sexual abuse from most people who deal with them.''
   The necessity of work makes going to school impossible. The
report said a survey of parents in the slums indicated that less
than 5 percent wanted their children to stop working. They just
wanted labor conditions to improve.
   Girls usually face the worst treatment, the study said, citing
long-standing beliefs that girls are less valuable and provide less
income to the family than boys.
   Girls are yanked from school faster than boys, fed less and
forced into wedlock early, the report said.
   ``I work like a machine,'' says Parvati, a 13-year-old girl
interviewed by UNICEF. Her parents leave her at home every day to
look after her three siblings _ an 11-year-old brother and two
sisters, 8 and 3.
   The family, economic refugees from Bihar, India's poorest state,
lives in a hut near a construction site where their father was
recently employed.
   Parvati has to prepare food, care for her siblings when they get
sick and help her mother as a maid. At dinnertime, Parvati is
allowed to eat only half the food of her brother.
   ``The only thing that makes me sad is when someone beats me,''
she says.
   The environment surrounding New Delhi's slums is also miserable.
   In many such areas, there is only one toilet for every 150
people and just one household in every 156 has access to potable
water, the report said.
   ``The very notion of childhood is eroded by a hostile
environment of poverty,'' the report said.
   The report urged the Indian government to recognize the rights
to literacy, health care, play and vocational training of New
Delhi's children.

   English soccer fans went on a
bottle-throwing, window-smashing rampage in this seaside resort
early today that left at least 20 people injured and resulted in
246 arrests, officials said.
   The clashes were ``the worst incident involving English fans''
since the World Cup soccer tournament began in early June, a
British Embassy spokeswoman, Kay Coombs, said.
   She said police were expelling the arrested fans today.
   One Italian newspaper called the fighting between the British
fans and Italian police ``true urban guerrilla warfare.''
   Fan violence five years ago led to a ban on English soccer clubs
from European club tournaments, and soccer authorities have said
British fans' behavior at World Cup matches would help determine
whether to lift that ban.
   Ms. Coombs said the violence broke out when Italian fans were
celebrating Italy's 2-0 victory over Uruguay in a World Cup match
Monday night.
   Some English fans drinking in a bar started throwing bottles at
the Italians, Ms. Coombs told reporters in Bologna, 60 miles
inland, where England was to play a World Cup match today against
Belgium.
   Baton-wielding police stepped in, and the fighting engulfed
downtown Rimini and spilled over onto its waterfront and beaches
before police managed to restore order.
   Officials said 20 people were treated in hospitals. Dozens of
shop windows were smashed and many parked cars damaged.
   Police chief Lorenzo D'Onofrio said the detained English fans
would be sent home as soon as a judge signed a deportation order.
The embassy spokeswoman said they would probably be flown back to
Britain on an airliner chartered by the Italian government.
   Il Resto del Carlino, a Bologna newspaper, said the scene in
Rimini was one of ``true urban guerrilla warfare.'' It said police
fired shots into the air in an effort to disperse the rowdy fans.
   About 4,000 Italian police and Carabinieri, or paramilitary
police, were on duty for today's match in Bologna. Alcohol sales
were banned.
   A Bologna police spokeswoman said the authorities would try to
keep the English and Belgian fans separated inside the stadium. But
she said ``it will be very, very difficult'' because the tickets
were not sold in blocs by nationality.
   English clubs were banned from European club tournaments after
the 1985 Heysel stadium riots in Brussels, in which 39 fans, most
of them Italians, were killed at the European Cup of Champions
final between Liverpool and Juventus of Turin.
   Fourteen British fans were sentenced in 1989 to three-year
prison terms for their role in the riots. Today, a Belgian appelate
court raised the sentences of 11 fans up to five years, upheld the
three-year terms for two fans and acquitted one person.
   The original sentences were appealed by both the prosecution and
defense.
   The European Soccer Federation has said it wants English clubs
to rejoin the annual tournaments, but that final approval would
depend on how English fans behaved at the World Cup.

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taiwan announced today that it will ban
its driftnet fleet from fishing in the south Pacific by July 1991
because of international criticism of the technique.
   Starting next month, Taiwanese driftnet ships also will be
banned from entering foreign ports to unload catches or to take on
supplies, said Lee Chien-chuan, director of Taiwan's Agriculture
Council Fisheries Department.
   Taiwan has already reduced its driftnet fleet in the south
Pacific from 60 to 24 vessels and the government is continuing to
buy old vessels from fishermen, Lee said.
   The United Nations has announced plans to ban driftnet fishing
by June 1992.
   In driftnet fishing, fishermen use nets that sweep as much as 30
miles of the ocean. Environmentalists say the driftnets strip the
areas of fishing resources and snare species not targeted by the
fishermen.

<HEAD>Five Cuban-American Mayors Condemn Mandela Over Castro Support</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Mandela, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of Miami and four other Cuban-American
mayors in surrounding Dade County have denounced Nelson Mandela for
failing to condemn human rights violations in Cuba.
   The rebuke, which angered black leaders, came in a statement
issued Monday, two days before the South African anti-apartheid
leader's scheduled Wednesday evening arrival in Miami. On Thursday,
Mandela is scheduled to address delegates of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees at the Miami
Beach Covention Center.
   Mayors Xavier Suarez of Miami, Julio Martinez of Hialeah, Pedro
Reboredo of West Miami, Jose Rivero of Sweetwater, and Gilda
Oliveros of Hialeah Gardens signed the declaration condemning
Mandela's support for Cuban President Fidel Casto.
   ``We, Cuban Americans, find it beyond reasonable comprehension
that Mr. Nelson Mandela, a victim of oppression by his own
government, not only fails to condemn the Cuban government for its
human rights violations, but rather praises virtues of the
tyrannical Castro regime,'' the five mayors said.
   Last week, Mandela defended his support for Castro, Palestine
Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat and Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi in a nationally televised interview.
   While the mayors' note also congratulated Mandela ``on his newly
acquired freedom,'' it angered leaders of Miami's black community.
They already were upset that Suarez and one other Miami city
commissioner withdrew their support for a June 7 city commission
resolution honoring Mandela as ``a champion of human rights in his
country.''
   Johnnie McMillian, Miami-Dade chapter president of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, called the lack
of a warm welcome for Mandela in Miami ``a slap in the face'' to
the city's black community.

   Government officials and educators in the
Middle East have urged a California parole board to release Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy's assassin from prison, his attorney said.
   The lawyer, Luke McKissack, said Monday the officials suggested
in a petition that Sirhan B. Sirhan's release could speed peace in
the Middle East.
   ``In the interest of the peace process, it's time to let him
out,'' McKissack said in a telephone interview before leaving for
the state prison at Soledad, where Sirhan was to appear at a parole
hearing scheduled for today.
   Sirhan, now 46, was convicted of gunning down the senator in the
pantry of Los Angeles' Ambassador Hotel on June 5, 1968, minutes
after Kennedy won California's Democratic presidential primary.
   He was originally sentenced to death, but the sentence was
changed to life in prison with possibility of parole after
California's death penalty law was overturned in 1972. He has been
turned down for parole 10 times since 1975.
   McKissack said the latest petition was the result of two trips
he made recently to the Middle East to seek support for Sirhan's
parole.
   Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Larry Trapp said he was
surprised at McKissack's move.
   ``It would suggest that Sirhan should have some place in making
political decisions or influencing political decisions,'' Trapp
said, noting that Sirhan was convicted of an assassination for
political purposes.
   The petition was signed by about 40 people, including two
members of Israel's parliament; the mayor of Bethlehem, on the
Israeli-occupied West Bank; members of the Arab Women's Union; and
officials of Bir Zeit University, a West Bank Palestinian school.
   The two parliament members are Mohammed Miari of the Progessive
List for Peace and Abdel Wahab Daroushe of the Arab Democratic
Party, both parties in opposition to the Shamir government.
   The petition bears the official seals of the university and
other organizations supporting the release.
   ``We of Israel and Palestine are concerned that inmate Sirhan
Sirhan be given equal treatment under the law,'' the document said.
``It concerns us that after 22 years of considerable confinement
and isolation he is repeatedly denied parole while other convicted
murderers, many more dangerous than he, are released after serving
much less time,'' the petition said.
   ``Sirhan Sirhan, as a Palestinian, has suffered much, as have
both of the peoples of this land. If peace is ever to come to our
land, recognition of the sufferings of both must be given,'' it
said. ``Sirhan's equitable release will give him the chance to
contribute to a process that will lead to a just and comprehensive
peace in our region.''
   McKissack said he traveled at his own expense to Sirhan's native
Jordan as well as Israel and Kuwait in search of support and
understanding for his client.

   The broccoli issue continues to stalk
President Bush, judging from mail he has gotten with culinary
advice only a toddler could give.
   The 17 children in teacher Ellen Paradis' class suggested Bush
disguise broccoli with a banana peel or cover it with peanut butter
and jelly. Another recipe they sent mixed broccoli with birthday
cake. One suggested covering it with toothpaste.
   ``Your lighthearted message brightened my day and gave me a
chuckle,'' Bush said in a letter to the children, ages 3 to 5, at
Eastern Michigan University's Child Development Laboratory.
   In March, word slipped out of the White House that Bush had
banned broccoli from Air Force One. On March 22, Bush declared at a
news conference: ``I do not like broccoli and I haven't liked it
since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat it. And I'm
president of the United States and I'm not going to eat any more
broccoli.''

   Some of the drugs sent to Soviet Armenia for
victims of the 1988 earthquake were useless or even dangerous,
experts say, and they warn of similar problems with emergency
supplies now being sent to Iran.
   The Armenian shipments included pharmaceuticals that came from
stocks of expired drugs, and others of a type no longer sold,
according to an article in the respected British medical journal,
The Lancet.
   ``We know exactly the same problems are happening now in Iran,''
said Dr. Philippe Autier, an epidemiologist and researcher in
public health for the Brussels-based European Association for
Health and Development.
   Autier wrote the report in the June 9 issue of the Lancet with
members of Doctors Without Borders, a French humanitarian group,
and the Soviet Armenian Ministry of Health.
   ``The quantities of expired and useless drugs are especially
worrying,'' it said. ``The supply of massive amounts of drugs for
the purpose of humanitarian aid still represents a good way of
disposing of stocks of expired drugs or of those that are normally
no longer marketable.''
   In a telephone interview Monday, Autier said people feel
``forced to do something immediately'' when confronted with the
suffering from natural disasters.
   Adam Kellett-Long, a spokesman for the British Red Cross, said
his organization was sending its first shipment of drugs to Iran
today after receiving a list of needed medication and supplies from
Iran. His organization only has sent drugs that are requested.
   Iranian officials said that more than 130 planes had arrived
since Sunday carrying supplies and medicines.
   Unlike Armenia, Iran ``is much more controlled. The Iranian Red
Crescent has been very strict on what it will accept. But of course
there are a lot of other groups and countries involved which may
not be taking the same care.''
   After the Armenian earthquake on Dec. 7, 1988, which killed
25,000 people, international relief agencies and governments rushed
in 5,000 tons of drugs, consumable medical supplies and other
equipment, the report said.
   Medical workers needed injectable painkillers like morphine,
antibiotics, anesthetics, intravenous fluids, syringes and needles
_ the same supplies now needed in Iran.
   Drugs worth about $55 million were sent to Armenia, but only
about 30 percent of them were available when they were most needed
because they arrived unsorted and were impossible to identify, the
Lancet report said.
   None of the boxes was labeled in Armenian and few in Russian, it
said. In 24 warehouses in the Armenian capital of Yerevan, 238
kinds of antibiotics were labeled in 21 languages, it said.
   ``In Spitak, the most badly affected area, pharmacists wasted
about two-thirds of their time merely looking for and identifying
useful drugs among the relief parcels,'' the report said.
   Autier said experts know that only 30 to 40 types of medicines
are commonly needed in most earthquake relief efforts.
   About 11 percent of the drugs were useless, including nasal
spray and drugs for treating tropical diseases such as malaria and
bilharzia, it said.
   Eight percent of the drugs had expired by the time they arrived,
the report said. Some of these drugs, such as tetracycline, were
potentially dangerous.
   For a year following the catastrophe, the Armenian ministry
worked with Doctors Without Borders making an inventory of the
drugs.
   By the end of their work, about 21 percent of the drugs were set
to expire or already had expired.
   An incinerator had to be sent to the region because old
pharmaceuticals should be burned in temperatures above 2,200
degrees Farenheit and burying them or burning them in the open
would be environmentally hazardous, the report said.

   The man acquitted of most counts in the
longest and costliest criminal proceeding in U.S. history testified
again in his retrial, denying he molested any children at his
family's McMartin Pre-School.
   Raymond Buckey adamantly denied molestation allegations during a
sharp-toned cross-examination Monday by Deputy District Attorney
Pam Ferrero.
   ``Mr. Buckey, there's no question I'm going to ask you (to
which) you're going to say you molested children, is there?'' asked
Ms. Ferrero.
   ``I'm not going to because I didn't,'' said Buckey.
   Ms. Ferrero then peppered Buckey, 32, with increasingly hostile
questions about why he wanted to be a preschool teacher and why he
liked being around children. Buckey acknowledged that he once took
pictures of children at a day care center in San Diego where he was
a volunteer. He said he wanted them for his scrapbook.
   Why did he want to teach small children?
   ``It seemed like a happy atmosphere. Children are nice to be
around,'' he said. ``It was pretty easy. I saw it as baby-sitting.''
   Buckey's first trial ended in January with acquittal on 40
molestation charges and mistrial on 13 counts. He is being retried
on eight of those 13 charges.
   In the first trial, Buckey's 62-year-old mother, Peggy McMartin
Buckey, was acquitted of 12 charges.
   The key witnesses against Buckey in his second trial are three
young girls who say they were molested by him.
   His lawyer, Danny Davis, has suggested that the children were
influenced by their parents and therapists to say they were
molested. Davis said the defense will rest its case this week and
predicted all testimony could end as early as the middle of next
week.

<HEAD>10 Communist Guerrillas Killed; 500 Homes Destroyed in Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers killed 10 Communist rebels
in a battle on the central island of Negros and a guerrilla land
mine blew up a police jeep north of the capital, killing three
policemen, the military said today.
   In separate fighting in a southern city, followers of rival
Moslem clans battled for a second day today. At least eight people
have been killed and 500 homes destroyed in the fighting, the
military said.
   On Negros Island, an army patrol encountered about 60 New
People's Army rebels Monday in San Carlos town, 330 miles south of
Manila, according to police chief Brig. Gen. Raymundo Jarque.
   He said the soldiers killed 10 rebels in a three-hour gunbattle
before the guerrillas withdrew. One soldier died and two others
were wounded, Jarque said.
   In Tabuk, 200 miles north of Manila, an undetermined number of
rebels lying in ambush on a highway fired at policemen after a
landmine blew up their jeep Monday, a military report said.
   Three other policemen were wounded in the attack.
   Jarque said the San Carlos encounter was the fourth clash with
the NPA on Negros since the rebels launched an offensive last
Friday with an attack on a police station on Escalante town north
of San Carlos. Five civilians were killed in that attack.
   The fighting between Moslem clans erupted Monday in Jolo,
capital of Sulu province about 600 miles south of Manila.
   The battles, between followers of Sulu provincial Vice Gov.
Kimar Tulawie and Jolo Mayor Suod Tan, began after the Tulawie clan
allegedly attacked the mayor's house to arrest a renegade policeman.
   The policeman, one of Tan's bodyguards, was said to have been
involved in the killing of Tulawie's brother, two cousins and a
fourth person on June 3.
   A military official said the warring factions agreed this
afternoon to halt the fighting and pull out of the city.
   At least 12 people outside the factions, including four
soldiers, were wounded in fighting today. Casualties on the two
sides could not be immediately determined. The military estimated
each side had at least 200 men.
   Two mortar rounds landing in a village about a mile from Jolo
killed two children, a military report said.
   On Monday, using mortars and other heavy weapons, members of the
two clans engaged in sporadic firefights around the downtown area.
The military said six people were killed.
   About 500 houses were razed in the villages of Asturias and
Alat, leaving 5,000 people homeless, the state-run Philippine
Information Agency reported. Local officials said 15,000 people
have been evacuated and the number may double as tensions continue
to rise.
   Schools and offices remained closed.
   In Zamboanga, the regional development council passed a
resolution urging Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos to call leaders of
the two groups to a peace talk to avoid further bloodshed.
   Philppine troops and helicopter gunships were put on standby
alert for immediate deployment to Jolo.
   Col. Samuel Tomas of the Philippine Constabulatory said there
was no longstanding feud between the two clans. He said there had
been an incorrect report that suspects in the June 3 killings had
entered Jolo last Saturday and were in the mayor's custody. Tulawie
insisted the report was true and launched the attack, he added.

<HEAD>Environmental Tobacco Smoke Blamed For 3,800 Cancer Deaths Among
Non-Smokers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new Environmental Protection Agency study
says second-hand tobacco smoke is a human carcinogen, causing about
3,800 lung cancer deaths annually among non-smokers.
   The study, which is in draft form and has not been evaluated by
EPA's independent science advisers, was quickly criticized by a
tobacco industry trade association.
   A statement from the the Tobacco Institute said an analysis by
the EPA's Science Advisory Board ``is likely to significantly
undermine the very basis of this draft.''
   The study, prepared by the EPA's Office of Research and
Development, said an evaluation of studies about environmental
tobacco smoke, which originates from burning cigarettes, shows that
it causes cancer among non-smokers.
   This conclusion, the study said, ``is based on a total weight of
evidence.''
   The evidence includes what the report calls ``detectable
association at environmental exposure levels'' between cancer and
non-smoking family members who live with a smoker.
   ``Within the population of women who are lifelong non-smokers,''
the study said, ``the excess lung cancer risk of those married to a
smoker is large enough to be observed.''
   Twenty-four studies from eight countries provide no other
broadly applicable explanation for the association between
environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer among non-smokers, the
report said.
   Although only 30 percent of the adult population smokes, the
study said, there are detectable levels of cotinine, a metabolic
product of nicotine, detected in the blood, saliva and urine of 50
percent to 75 percent of non-smokers tested.
   The estimate of 3,800 lung cancer deaths annually among
non-smokers, the study said, includes approximately 1,750 females
who have never smoked, 800 males who have never smoked and 1,250
former smokers of both sexes.
   About 130,000 people will die of lung cancer every year, about
85 percent of which is caused by smoking directly. Smoking causes
an estimated 390,000 premature deaths a year when emphysema and
cardiovascular deaths are added to the lung cancer total, according
to government estimates.
   The EPA report said studies also have linked cigarette smoking
in the home with increased respiratory disorders among children,
particularly infants.
   ``The cumulative evidence indicates strongly that parental,
especially the mother's, smoking is associated with increased
incidence of respiratory illnesses in the first one to two years of
life,'' the study said. ``Recent studies also solidify the evidence
of a link between parental smoking and increased middle ear disease
in young children.''
   The Tobacco Institute said the EPA draft report has ``technical
problems and inadequacies'' and suffers from ``the lack of
scientific support.''
   ``The statistical manipulations represented by the EPA draft
risk assessment constitute, at the very best, speculation without
an adequate scientific foundation,'' the Tobacco Institute
statement said.

<HEAD>West Germans Release Discussion Paper Outlining Political
Unification</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUD S. BEELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany today unveiled proposals
for full unification by mid-December after joint elections.
   The plan was made public just five days before the two countries
are to merge their economies and social institutions, a move that
effectively marks the end of four decades of socialism in East
Germany.
   According to a discussion paper released by the Interior
Ministry, unification would become effective the day after united
German elections, proposed for either Dec. 9 or Dec. 16.
   West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he
expected the East German Cabinet to begin discussing the proposed
elements of the treaty on political unification on Wednesday in
East Berlin.
   The treaty for the accession of East Germany _ its joining with
the West _ should be taken up by both German parliaments by early
September, he added.
   The parliaments of both countries last week ratified an initial
treaty outlining the monetary, economic and social union that is to
take effect Sunday, when the West German mark replaces the nearly
worthless East German mark.
   The victors and vanquished from World War II are still working
on the international ramifications of German unity, namely the
military posture of a united Germany and what to do about the
380,000 Soviet troops on East German soil.
   West Germany is a member of the Western NATO alliance, and the
Allies have insisted a united Germany remain in NATO. The Soviets
have so far rejected that idea. East Germany has been the most
strategically important member of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, as
the first line of defense against the West.
   Bonn wants to limit the political treaty to only those laws and
regulations that differ between East and West Germany and are
necessary for political unification.
   According to the discussion paper, issues which could be left
unresolved before unification include the differing abortion laws,
a highly controversial issue.
   In West Germany, a woman must prove medical necessity or
financial hardship to have an abortion. In East Germany, abortions
are free on demand in the first trimester.

<HEAD>Arrested Student Leader Appears On TV, Denies Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leader of a 53-day anti-Communist
student demonstration has declared he was arrested and has been
held in a prison hospital on ``groundless charges.''
   The interview with Marian Munteanu was broadcast by state TV
Monday night in the Jilavea prison hospital outside Bucharest. He
was dressed in pajamas, and bandages covered the injuries he
suffered when pro-government coal miners beat him and broke up the
protest June 14.
   Munteanu, who also played a role in the popular uprising that
toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in December, was then
arrested on charges of instigating the violence.
   Speaking from his bed, slowly gesturing with bandaged hands,
Munteanu said he could not understand how the workers could turn on
the students or why he was arrested. He had wounds and bruises to
his head, chest and back, and a leg and arm was broken.
   ``For four years I was a worker myself and I also worked
underground,'' said Munteanu, president of the Students' League.
``So I thought I knew the working class. I cannot explain the
savage way in which the students were beaten.
   ``I still have confidence, and I pray to God that justice is
done.''
   The students had demanded that President Ion Iliescu and other
leading ex-Communists be banned from politics for 10 years.
   Iliescu had asked the miners to restore order in Bucharest and
later thanked them ``with all my heart'' for doing so.
   Iliescu distanced himself from the indiscriminate violence,
which prompted Western nations to cut some aid to Romania.
   Munteanu said he has been under arrest ``on absolutely
groundless charges. I have the testimony of thousands of people.''
   According to a communique released by the prosecutor's office,
Munteanu is the only student among the 177 people arrested in an
upsurge of violence June 13-15.
   On June 13, police headquarters, the Ministry of the Interior
and TV headquarters were firebombed after police cleared downtown
University Square of protesters. Thousands of miners then took over
the streets, beating anyone they suspected of being against the
government.
   The Student League dissociated itself from the violence of June
13, it said Monday.
   Bucharest University protested ``irresponsible actions'' that
devastated the university.

<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Michigan is
establishing a Warsaw branch of its Institute for Social Research
to study Poland's fast-moving political changes first hand.
   The Center for Social Research-Osrodek Studiow Spolecznych will
be the first collaborative venture in the social and behavioral
sciences between the United States and an Eastern European country,
institute Director Robert Zajonc said.
   Scholars in Poland and Ann Arbor will benefit, he said in a
recent interview. Five Polish scholars plan to attend an
Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research at
the University of Michigan this summer.
   And several University of Michigan researchers have projects
under way in Poland. For example, a political science professor,
Ronald Inglehart, is studying changing values from generation to
generation, and a sociology professor, Duane Alwin, is studying
concepts of justice in Eastern Europe.
   For Zajonc, opening the branch in his native Poland is both a
professional and personal achievement. He fled the country in 1940
to escape the Nazis.
   Professionally, he said, he is excited about the chance to
examine Poland's changing society.
   ``When the government changed, everything changed, and this is
an absolutely unique opportunity,'' Zajonc said. ``It was a
one-time event, a transformation from communism to capitalism
overnight. Political and economic events of this nature don't
happen, and if it happens you'd better be there to watch.''
   The institute, founded in 1946, has an annual budget of $21
million, mostly from grants and government contracts, and a staff
of 90 research scientists, several hundred researchers and more
than 300 field interviewers.
   The branch at the University of Warsaw will have a staff of six
scientists and four assistants and an annual budget of about
$250,000, provided by the University of Warsaw and U.S. foundations.

   Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi, freed by a
government eager to improve ties with the West, said today he will
continue to work for ``progress and development'' in China.
   Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, arrived in Britain Monday night
after the Chinese government agreed to permit them to leave their
refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
   The couple had sought refuge there after the Chinese
government's June 4, 1989, military crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement.
   ``As citizens of China, we hope to do whatever we can in the
future to help China's continuing progress and development,'' Fang
said in a statement issued through the Royal Society in London.
   The statement was issued after the society canceled tentative
plans to present Fang at a news conference.
   Fang's statement said he and his wife were looking forward to a
few days of quiet to ``rest and recuperate, and to have some
medical tests.''
   ``The past year has been difficult for us, but we have received
strong support from the international scientific community and
friends everywhere,'' the statement said.
   ``My wife and I would also like to express our heartfelt
appreciation to President Bush, Ambassador (James) Lilley, and the
staff at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.''
   The Royal Society, one of the country's oldest and most
prestigious scientific organizations, invited the 54-year-old
astrophysicist to Britain. He will be a senior visiting fellow at
Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy, the institute's
director said.
   ``We understand that our son in China will be soon be able to
study abroad, and we are naturally looking forward to a family
reunion,'' Fang said in the statement.
   Fang and Li have two sons. Fang Ke is a student at Wayne State
University in Detroit and Fang Zhe is a student at Beijing
University.
   Fang and Li, a physicist, flew to Britain late Monday night
aboard a U.S. Air Force transport jet from Beijing.

<TEXT>
   Lithuanian President Vytautas
Landsbergis met with Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Kremlin today,
then returned to his republic as its parliament prepared to debate
a moratorium on independence.
   Gorbachev invited Vytautas Landsbergis to the unannounced
meeting, apparently to discuss Gorbachev's proposal that the
Lithuanian parliament pass a moratorium on its March 11
declaration, said Haris Subacius, a spokesman in the Lithuanian
Supreme Council parliament.
   An aide to Landsbergis also confirmed the meeting, but declined
to comment further.
   Landsbergis returned later to Vilnius for a parliament debate on
the moratorium, which has been recommended by Lithuanian Prime
Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene.
   ``The proposed temporary moratorium could save our dignity and
at the same time promote the solution of the accumulated
problems,'' the official Soviet news agency Tass quoted Mrs.
Prunskiene as telling a news conference Monday.
   Lithuania has been under an Kremlin economic blockade since
shortly after its declaration.
   Soviet authorities partially lifted the embargo by resuming
natural gas shipments to a Lithuanian fertilizer factory, amounting
to 15 percent of Soviet gas deliveries to Lithuania. Crude oil and
gasoline shipments remain cut and many Lithuanian businesses have
closed, forcing thousands out of work.
   The Lithuanian Council of Ministers, which Mrs. Prunskiene
heads, accepted Gorbachev's proposal earlier this month.
Landsbergis has been less inclined to compromise.
   Gorbachev proposed the moratorium as a formula to enable him to
open talks with the secessionist republic and lift the economic
embargo. Details are sketchy, but he appears to be seeking a
longterm agreement with Lithuania and its sister Baltic states,
Latvia and Estonia, to keep them as republics in a newly
constituted Soviet Union.
   His chances of forcing them to retain their old status, or to
accept recently passed Soviet rules governing secession, diminished
this month when Russia, the largest Soviet republic, passed a
resolution declaring its sovereignty.
   Although the Russian declaration did not go as far as steps
taken by the three Baltic republics, it set the stage for the
transfer of many powers from central authorities to elected
governments in the 15 Soviet republics.
   Mrs. Prunskiene and some Soviet officials have been searching
for a compromise to resolve the impasse.
   Her popularity has been rising rapidly among Lithuanians during
the crisis, compared with that of Landsbergis, who is losing favor,
according to a poll released Monday.
   It was conducted by the Sociological Research Department of the
Lithuanian Academy of Sciences and reported by Interfax, an
unofficial news service of Radio Moscow.
   Mrs. Prunskiene had a favorable rating among 61 percent of those
surveyed, followed by the deputy prime minister and leader of the
breakaway Lithuanian Communist Party, Algirdas Brazauskas, with 50
percent, the report said.
   Landsbergis' rating has declined from 45 percent to 28 percent
since the independence declaration, it said.
   Interfax did not report the poll's margin of error or say how
many people were contacted.
   Despite signs of a compromise, the Lithuanian parliament has
continued to pass and implement laws that seem likely to anger
Soviet hard-liners.
   On Monday, Landsbergis and other members of parliament received
new Lithuanian identity cards, which are to be distributed later
this week to all young men as a first step toward avoiding
compulsory service in the Soviet army, according to Tass.

   Police have released a sketch of a man who may
be the so-called ``zodiac'' gunman.
   Four people who have been wounded in New York City since March
are believed to be victims of the gunman. One victim, a 78-year-old
man who was shot four weeks ago, died Sunday.
   In letters sent to police and news organizations, the writer
listed the first three shootings and threatened to shoot 12 people
_ one for each sign of the zodiac.
   The sketch released by police is that of a man who asked a
drifter his date of birth. The drifter was shot a few days later.
   Investigators said the drifter was stalked because of his
astrological sign, referred to in a note left in Central Park at
the site of the shooting.
   Police believe the gunman is unrelated to the killer dubbed the
``zodiac,'' who claimed responsibility for as many as 40 killings
in a series of notes sent to San Francisco-area newspapers from
1968 to 1987.

<TEXT>
   Western European leaders today signaled
support for Mikhail Gorbachev's efforts to rescue his ailing Soviet
economy but fended off a Franco-German push for an immediate $15
billion aid package.
   The leaders of the 12-nation trading bloc ended a two-day summit
by asking aides to consult with the Kremlin about urgent proposals
for immediate loans and longer term assistance.
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey, the host of the meeting, said
the leaders were aware of concerns about the Soviet president's
chances of success in pushing his perestroika program of economic
reform.
   ``The community is concerned lest those difficulties on the
economic front might impede, disrupt the process of perestroika ...
in which we all have a very real vested interest,'' he told a news
conference.
   The troublesome question also will be at the top of the agenda
of next month's economic summit of the seven leading industrialized
nations in Houston.
   In their final statement, the leaders praised reform efforts in
South Africa but made no move to ease the economic sanctions
imposed against the white-led government in 1986.
   They renewed their willingness to consider a gradual relaxation
of the prohibitions ``when there is clear evidence that the process
of change already initiated continues.''
   Britain's Margaret Thatcher, who has pushed for a lifting of
prohibitions, hailed their statement urging an end to violence in
South Africa. She said it was directed at black leader Nelson
Mandela's African National Congress and its support for an armed
struggle, which ``ought to be abandoned.''
   In a separate statement, the leaders expressed their ``deep
revulsion'' at recent signs of anti-Semitism in Europe. Since May
10, there have been numerous incidents of vandalism at Jewish
cemeteries, although non-Jewish cemeteries have also been targets.
   They also expressed their ``profound sympathy'' to Iran after an
earthquake in the northwestern part of the country killed tens of
thousands. They promised to provide ``all possible assistance'' to
disaster victims.
   On the question of Soviet aid, a senior West German official,
demanding anonymity, said he expected an aid package to be decided
by year's end.
   ``I think there is a majority for providing help to the Soviet
Union,'' the official said. But he acknowledged that ``no figure
will be cited'' at the end of the summit.
   In taking a cautious approach on the Soviet Union, the
officials, led by Mrs. Thatcher, rejected an appeal by France and
West Germany for an immediate $15 billion aid package.
   ``I favor support for economic reform but there has to be reform
to be supported,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   Spain's prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, said, ``It wouldn't be
responsible for the community to fix a budget (aid package) without
knowing the needs.''
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, who made a stong pitch
for immediate help for the Soviet Union, said he was satisfied with
the results of the summit. He emphasized that aid for Moscow is a
``long-term investment from which we all can benefit.''
   ``It only makes sense if the Soviets understand that this is
help to help themselves,'' he said.
   West German banks have already agreed to pump $3.1 billion worth
of loans into the Soviet economy.
   In exchange for the help, Kohl has said he would urge the
Kremlin ``to adopt a constructive approach'' toward membership of a
united Germany in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Gorbachev has opposed immediate and full membership for the new
German state in the Western military alliance. West Germany now
belongs to NATO, its eastern neighbor to the crumbling, Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact.

   A veteran FBI agent who happened upon a bank
robbery was shot and killed as he tried to arrest the robber. A
27-year-old man was arrested several hours later on a murder
warrant.
   The robbery was in progress at a Security Pacific Bank branch
several blocks east of the Las Vegas Strip on Monday when agent
John Bailey, 47, arrived to serve a subpoena, police said.
   The agent drew his gun and ordered the robber to halt, said
Metropolitan Police Deputy Chief John Sullivan. When the man
displayed a gun, Bailey fired a shot, but it missed. The man then
knocked Bailey against a wall and shot him several times, he said.
   Carlos Gurry was arrested several hours after the shooting.
Sullivan said a tip led to Gurry, and that questioning him led
police to get a search warrant and then to book Gurry on a murder
warrant. He remained in jail today pending a hearing before a
magistrate.
   Bailey died in surgery at University Medical Center about three
hours after the shooting. He had been shot twice in the chest, once
in the back and several times in the arm, said hospital spokesman
Dale Pugh.
   No others were reported injured.
   Bailey, a former Marine captain who was decorated for valor
during the Vietnam War, had been with the FBI for 21 years. He was
the 29th FBI agent killed in the line of duty in the United States,
said Las Vegas agent-in-charge Jim Weller.

   Survivors of last week's massacre at
the local General Motors Acceptance Corp. office are back at work
in new quarters.
   Seven workers and one customer were killed and five workers were
wounded June 18 by James Edward Pough, who shot people at random in
GMAC's Baymeadows office before killing himself.
   GMAC opened new offices Monday in the Southpoint office complex
about two miles north of its previous office.
   Company officials said there was no thought to returning to the
old office.
   ``Not for what these people have been through _ we couldn't do
it,'' said Jerry Robbins, a General Motors spokesman.
   Robbins said employees are trying to put the tragedy behind them.
   A uniformed, off-duty police office stood guard Monday afternoon
in front of GMAC's new office, but to keep away curiosity seekers
and to provide employees with ``a certain sense of security,''
Robbins said.
   People bought baskets of plants and flowers to the new office in
memory of the slain workers. Each desk in the office was decorated
with a single red rose _ courtesy of a local moving company.
   Robbins said GMAC plans to stay in its temporary location for
several months before deciding where to locate permanently.
   The five wounded by Pough in the shooting spree at GMAC remain
hospitalized, but are expected to survive.
   GMAC said it has discovered that it mailed two letters to Pough
seeking $6,394 he still owed the company after it repossessed his
1988 Grand Am.
   Pough turned the car in January and was notifed in March that
the company had sold the car and the proceeds had been applied
against his loan. But it said he still owed $6,394.
   On April 6, a computer-generated letter also was mailed to
Pough. But he was not contacted after that and the company had
concluded the debt was uncollectable, said Joseph D. Taylor Jr.,
GMAC regional manager from Atlanta.

black market, federal officials said.
   Alexandre Mikouline, 51, was arrested Monday at Tampa
International Airport where he was waiting to board a flight to
Washington, D.C., and Moscow.
   An hour later, Georgy Kuparadze, 50, was arrested at a St.
Petersburg Beach condominium. Both faced preliminary felony charges
of conspiring to provide false information to a gun dealer.
 who heads the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms branch in Tampa, said his office expects   Jim Sudberry, to get
a search
warrant today to inspect Mikouline's baggage. Sudberry said agents
expect to find seven shotguns they believe were bought at a Tampa
area gun shop.
   He said the government's case would be spelled out in a federal
complaint today, and that the charges would carry possible 10-year
sentences.
   Mikouline, a resident alien of St. Petersburg Beach, is a Soviet
citizen who was in the United States on a visa, Sudberry said.
Kuparadze was born in the Soviet Union, emigrated to Canada and has
been living in New York on a Canadian passport.
   Both men were held overnight at the Hillsborough County Jail.
They were to appear before a federal magistrate this afternoon.

<TEXT>
   Police burned 2,200 pounds of heroin and opium at
a rally in southern China, then announced death sentences for 14
drug traffickers, the official Xinhua news agency said. The
traffickers were later executed.
   The ceremony took place in southern Tunnan province, considered
China's drug trafficking center.
   The nationally televised evening news showed a stadium in the
provincial capital of Kunming filled with spectators, who applauded
as police officers lit a row of pyres piled high with heroin and
opium.
   Xinhua reported that police burned 1,144 pounds of heroin and
1,056 pounds of opium that had been confiscated in the past few
years.
   Also at the rally, Qiu Chuangjiao, president of the provincial
Higher People's Court, announced the death sentences of 14 drug
traffickers, Xinhua said. It said they then were executed.
   Neither report gave any details about the condemned people or
the executions.
   China's drug problem is most serious in the southwestern
province of Yunnan, which adjoins the ``Golden Triangle'' region of
northern Laos, Thailand and Burma, which produces most of the
world's heroin.
   Drug trafficking and use were virtually eliminated after the
Communists came to power in 1949. However, in recent years drug use
has increased, particularly in the south.
   Last year, health workers found 146 AIDS-infected drug addicts
in Yunnan _ a discovery that shocked the country.
   Earlier this month, provincial authorities launched an anti-drug
campaign, asking each village to form its own anti-drug team.

   Air force planes bombed and strafed
residential areas and killed an unknown number of civilians in a
battle for a strategic fort in the northern city of Jaffna, Tamil
Tiger rebels said today.
   At least 196 people were killed as rebels and government forces
fought for control of Tamil-dominated areas in the north and east,
military officials and residents said.
   The charred bodies of at least 100 Tamil Tiger rebels were found
in an eastern town, and 50 policemen were massacred by the rebels
in the north, the officials and residents said. In addition, the
military said it had killed 41 rebels and lost five soldiers in a
mine explosion.
   The Tigers, in a statement to an Indian news organization, said
five air force bombers and one helicopter gunship dropped
incendiary devices and 120-pound bombs on residential areas in
Jaffna on Monday.
   At one point, bombers and helicopters attacked the area
continuously for three hours, and hundreds of buildings near the
Jaffna Fort were set on fire, the rebels said.
   Military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Sri
Lankan air force planes were again bombing and strafing rebel
positions today. The government said the 270 security forces who
had been trapped in the 200-year-old fort in the heart of the city
had established positions 1,000 yards outside the garrison.
   Military officials have said troops would try to avoid killing
civilians.
   ``We are not hellbent on bombing and killing people,'' Defense
Secretary Gen. Cyril Ranatunge said. He added that helicopter
gunships would try to pinpoint their targets.
   There was no way to independently verify either rebel or
government claims because transportation and telephone services to
the region have been cut off. Travelers reaching Vavuniya, just
south of Jaffna, confirmed that heavy bombing and strafing
operations had begun along the whole of the Jaffna peninsula.
   The fort is in the heart of Jaffna, a city of 120,000 that is
the headquarters of the Tamil separatist movement. It is 186 miles
north of Colombo.
   Loss of the fort would the most serious blow to the government
since fighting started again June 11. At least 1,626 combatants and
many civilians have died.
   The government won the eastern city of Batticaloa on Monday, and
residents contacted by telephone said it was filled with soldiers
today.
   The current round of fighting began June 11 near Batticaloa
after a Tamil man claimed he was manhandled by police of the Indian
Ocean island nation's majority Sinhalese. Tamil Tigers then overran
a series of police stations.
   The clashes ended a tenuous 13-month cease-fire between ethnic
Tamil separatists and the Sinhalese-dominated government.
   The Tigers apparently are digging in for a protracted guerrilla
war, according to some of their military leaders, who spoke to
reporters from their jungle hideouts in Batticaloa district last
week.
   Tamil Tiger rebel mortars, rockets and gunfire have pounded the
Jaffna Fort for the past two weeks. Last week, the government
reported the 270 soldiers and policemen pinned down inside were
running out of food, water, medicines and ammunition.
   ``If the rebels do not permit food and medicine to reach the
soldiers and policemen in the fort, we will be taking military
action to clear a path,'' Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne
warned Monday.
   Over the weekend, air force planes dropped leaflets warning
residents near the fort to leave the area.
   At least 12,000 people, including 1,150 Indian soldiers, have
been killed in the Tamil separatist war since 1983. Indian troops
withdrew from Sri Lanka in March, ending an unsuccessful,
32-month-long operation to disarm Tamil separatists.
   Tamils, mostly Hindu, form 18 percent of the island's 16 million
people. Tamils have long accused the Sinhalese majority of
discrimination.
   The Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the population,
control the government and the military.

   A single-engine plane crashed in flames about 100
yards from a retirement home today, killing the pilot and the other
person on board, authorities and witnesses said.
   The plane, a single engine Bellanca craft, went down at about 9
a.m. across the street from the 350-bed Grace Presbyterian Village
nursing home. No one was reported injured on the ground.
   Witnesses said they heard a sputtering sound or a boom and saw
the plane go down.
   ``We immediately went to the plane to see if there was anything
we could do,'' said a witness, Dwight Bell. ``Unfortunately, there
was nothing we could do. The passenger did make an attempt to get
out of the plane. It was very sad to sit there and watch it burn
like that.''
   Bill Anderson of the Federal Aviation Administration's regional
office in Fort Worth said the pilot reported engine and landing
gear problems moments before the plane struck power lines.
   The plane was about four miles away from Red Bird Airport, a
general aviation airport in south Dallas, but Anderson said he did
not know if the plane had just taken off or was preparing to land.
   ``It's just the Lord's blessing that it didn't crash on top of
us,'' said retirement center receptionist Betty Williams. ``It's

   A 650-foot freight ship with a load of
lumber went aground in the Columbia River this morning but no cargo
or oil was spilled and nobody was injured, the Coast Guard said.
   The Pacduke, a Liberian-registered ship, went aground shortly
after 6 a.m. near Cottonwood Island between Rainier and Kalama,
Wash., said Lt. j.g. Sherry Bourgeault of the Coast Guard's
Portland station.
   She said the grounding 70 miles upriver from the mouth of the
Columbia apparently resulted from a steering malfunction as the
ship tried to maneuver through a curve in the waterway.
   ``The vessel is high and dry,'' Bourgeault said. ``It grounded
at a high tide and tide is on its way down now. It might be there
for a while.''
   She said a Coast Guard investigative team was dispatched to the
ship.
   ``I couldn't tell you how hard it is going to be to refloat the
ship,'' she said. Tugs were being sent to the site.
   The Coast Guard issued a notice to users of the river to
exercise extreme caution and minimize wake when passing the
grounded ship.

   The price of tickets at the new Paris Opera,
conceived to bring opera to a broad public at affordable rates,
will rise sharply in September.
   The cheapest seats _ now $9 _ will double in price, while the
most expensive ones will jump from $66 to $93.
   ``It's a question of bringing in money,'' Opera president Pierre
Berge, was quoted as saying in an interview published in the
weekend Le Figaro Magazine.
   Berge, the financial wizard behind the Yves Saint-Laurent
fashion empire, was quoted as saying that he had always
``campaigned against the privileges of money so that tickets would
be inexpensive.
   ``Otherwise, what's the purpose of building a popular Opera.''
   The Opera-Bastille, which seats 2,700 in its main auditorium,
was conceived by President Francois Mitterrand to make culture more
accessible to the masses and spark urban renewal in the eastern
part of Paris.
   Opponents contended that Paris did not need another opera house,
and that existing theater, the ornate Palais Garnier, met the
city's needs.
   While the cost of attending premieres will once again make them
an elite preserve, Berge said he would not approve ``black tie
affairs.''
   The new facility, overlooking the historic Place de la Bastille,
will put on 78 perfromances next season, including Guiseppe Verdi's
``Otello'' starring Placido Domingo and a co-production with
Milan's La Scala opera house of Tchaikovsky's ``Queen of Spades.''

   And when is a freebie golf trip considered a gift? Only when
lawmakers say so.
   In 1988, the Pennsylvania Manufacturing Association spent a
reported $20,000 entertaining seven lawmakers at a Florida golf
resort. Only one reported the outing, although three others said
they went but didn't consider it a gift.
   Lawmakers can get free movie passes in Pennsylvania, free lift
tickets at ski resorts in Utah, race track tickets in Maryland,
college basketball tickets in Kentucky and all sorts of freebies to
professional sports.
   Take a ticket in Wisconsin, however, and you'll be criminally
prosecuted. Wisconsin is the only state that bars lawmakers from
taking anything of value _ even a cup of coffee.
   Four Wisconsin senators were fined for accepting free lodging
from a special interest while attending a Chicago Bears-Green Bay
Packers football game. In a separate case, the Tobacco Institute
was fined for giving tickets to a state senator for the Los Angeles
Lakers-Boston Celtics basketball game during a legislative trip to
Boston.
   Thirteen states set limits on the value of gifts a legislator
can accept from a single lobbyist, ranging from a $10 per month in
California to $100 per gift in West Virginia.
   But there's plenty of room for ambiguity. Despite Nebraska's
limit of $25 per gift, a lobbyist onced hauled a senator around
with a private plane until state officials intervened.
   Dannie Trautwein, executive director of the state's
Accountability and Disclosure Commission, said the lobbyist was
lectured on the intent of the state's lobbying law. But no one was
prosecuted because of the vagaries of defining a gift.
   ``He looked me right in the eye and said the plane was just
going in the same direction as the senator and anbyody could have
gotten on it,'' Trautwein said.

   A prosecutor described in gruesome detail the
gang-rape and attempted murder of a Central Park jogger as the
trial of three teen-agers accused in the attack got under way.
Defense lawyers suggested their clients' statements were coerced.
   ``She was forced to submit to repeated sexual intercourse as
each one took his turn. After the group finished raping and beating
and sexually abusing her, somebody still took a pipe and struck her
in the head, leaving her for dead,'' Assistant District Attorney
Elizabeth Lederer told the jurors Monday.
   ``Every bone supporting her left eye was broken. She was in
shock. She had cuts and bruises covering her body. They left her to
die, naked and stripped,'' the prosecutor said.
   The woman, an investment banker, was making her nightly jog
through the park on April 19, 1989, when she was attacked. She
survived, but suffered brain damage and ``has no recollection of
what happened to her that night,'' Lederer said.
   Photos of the victim showed that she suffered the same injuries
that the defendants described inflicting, Lederer said, adding that
the three would convict themselves with statements they made after
they left the woman gang-raped and beaten nearly to death.
   ``Each of these defendants told police they participated in the
attack that night,'' said Lederer.
   In testimony today, a police officer, Raymond Alvarez, described
how he encountered a bloodied man believed to be the first victim
assaulted by the gang who later attacked the woman jogger. As he
and the injured man, Antonio Diaz, looked for his assailants, they
came upon a bicyclist who said a group of youths tried to assault
him but he managed to get away.
   Alvarez was the third person to testify; the first two were
technical witnesses who had made maps of Central Park.
   Charged with attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse, assault,
robbery and riot are Raymond Santana and Yusef Salaam, both 16, and
Antron McCray, 15. They are charged as adults, but if convicted,
they would be sentenced as juveniles to up to 10 years in prison.
   Three other youths are due to stand trial on the same charges
later this year.
   McCray and Santana gave written and videotaped statements to
police after they were arrested. Salaam gave neither, but a police
fficer took notes on comments he allegedly made and Justice Thomas
Galligan has ruled the notes may be presented as evidence.
   Lawyers for the defendants said in brief opening remarks that
the statements had been coerced by police lies, ruses and
intimidation.
   Michael Joseph, McCray's lawyer, said his client initially
denied involvement in the attack, and then the police ``added
facts'' because he was not telling them what they wanted to hear.
   The defense lawyers also argued that there is no scientific
evidence linking the defendants to the attack, and that without the
statements, the prosecution's case is weak at best.
   Lederer said the defendants were part of a larger group of 30 to
35 youths who entered Central Park at 110th Street around 9 p.m.
the night of the attack specifically to ``rob, beat and assault
people.''
   The three were also charged with assaulting two male joggers the
same night. Lederer said that by the time the group left the park
around 10 p.m., they assaulted or tried to assault at least eight
people.
   Police said the defendants called their action wilding. Lederer
said the victims were randomly chosen.
   The prosecutor said McCray told police: ``We charged her. We got
her on the ground and everybody was hitting her. ... Everybody was
stomping and everything ... and we all took turns getting on top of
her. I just kicked. There was a whole bunch of us just kicking.''
   Lederer said she expects to call more than 50 witnesses and
present an array of photographs and medical records during the
trial, which is expected to last six to eight weeks.
   The victim, now 29, spent several months in a New York Hospital
before being transferred to a Connecticut facility for further
rehabilitation. She recently returned to work at Salomon Brothers
and was promoted to vice president.

   A lithograph by Norwegian artist Edvard
Munch, stolen from an Oslo art gallery in April, has been
recovered, news reports said Tuesday.
   The print, Madonna, worth about $231,000, was among four works
by Norwegian artists recovered at a house in Drammen, near Oslo,
newspapers said. All the works had been stolen.
   Two Norwegian men were held on charges of receiving stolen
property, but they were not suspected of stealing the artworks,
reported the Norwegian news agency NTB. Their names were not
released.
   The Madonna was among a number of works stolen from the
Kunsthuset gallery in mid-April. Thieves broke down the door of the
museum with a rail from a trolley track.
   Munch, who died in 1944, is considered a key inspiration in
German expressionism. The painter and graphic artist's emotionally
charged style often reflected such themes as fear and death.

<DATELINE>SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Basque separatist organization
ETA on Tuesday claimed responsibility for three recent killings but
said one was a mistake, and it apologized for that attack.
   ETA seeks independence from Spain for the three-province
northern Basque region. It began its violent campaign in 1968.
   In a statement Tuesday in the Basque daily newspaper Egin, ETA
claimed responsibility for the June 13 shooting of retired Army
Col. Jose Lasanta in San Sebastian. It also claimed responsibility
for the deaths of former policeman Virgilio Do Nascimento on May 22
and Rafael San Sebastian on June 10.
   Referring to the killing of San Sebastian, a civilian, ETA
expressed ``its most serious and sincere self-criticism over this
irreparable mistake.''
   The statement gave no explanation.
   Police believe ETA suspected San Sebastian of drug trafficking.
In the past, ETA has killed at least five people it accused of
involvement in drug trafficking in the Basque region.
   Also Tuesday, two suspected Basque terrorists were found dead,
and police said they apparently committed suicide to avoid capture
following a shootout with Civil Guards. The bodies were found in a
rural area near Pamplona, which is near the Basque region.
   The dead man and woman suffered single bullet wounds to the
head. Two pistols were found next to the bodis, along with another
gun taken from a Civil Guard killed in the shootout Monday with
Basque terrorists.

<HEAD>Shamir Says Israel Will Not Block Soviet Jews From Setling In
Territories</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM RON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Tuesday that
Israel will not block Soviet Jewish immigrants from settling in the
occupied territories.
   His statement was seen as a clarification of remarks made Sunday
by Housing Minister Ariel Sharon. Sharon said the immigrants would
not be settled ``beyond the Green Line'' _ Israel's pre-1967
borders.
   But Israel radio quoted Shamir as saying this was not a change
from previous policy.
   Shamir said of Sharon's statement: ``Of course, he said that
nobody will be sent by us to certain territories and to certain
locations. But everybody in a democratic country has the right to
settle wherever he wishes.''
   The United States and Soviet Union strongly oppose settling
Soviet Jewish immigrants in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
saying such settlements are obstacles to peace. Palestinians and
Arab countries fear the Palestinians will be pushed out of the
territories if immigrants are allowed to settle in them.
   Also Tuesday, Palestinian leaders from the occupied West Bank
urged the United Nations to play a stronger peacemaking role in the
Middle East ``in view of the failure of American diplomacy.''
   They also asked the United Nations to set up a system to monitor
the settlement of Soviet Jewish immigrants in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   The requests were made during a meeting with U.N. envoy
Jean-Claude Aime. Aime is on a weeklong fact-finding visit to
Israel and the occupied territories at the behest of U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Aime met Monday with Shamir, and Israeli newspapers said Tuesday
he had offered U.N. mediation between Israelis and Palestinians.
   The Hebrew daily Haaretz said Shamir declined the offer, saying
Israel still hoped for U.S. backing for its own election plan in
the territories. The election would lead to limited autonomy for
the 1.7 million Palestinians in the territories.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens, meanwhile, met with three mayors
of West Bank towns and promised to reopen two more Palestinian
universities, the Abu Dis College of Science and Technology near
Jerusalem and An Najah College in Nablus.
   Two weeks ago, the army announced that a nursing school in the
West Bank town of El Bireh would be the first academic institution
to reopen.
   The army closed universities and colleges in the occupied
territories shortly after the start of the Palestinian uprising 30
months ago, contending they were hotbeds of anti-Israeli activity.
   Arens also promised to release an unspecified number of detained
Palestinians as a gesture of good will on the upcoming Moslem
holidary of Eid el-Adha.
   The Palestinian plea for U.N. help came in a petition by the
West Bank leaders, who included five university professors and one
physician.
   Saeb Erekat, a political science lecturer in Nablus, read the
12-point petition to reporters.
   ``In view of the failure of American diplomacy to start a peace
process and as a result of the decision taken by the United States
to suspend its dialogue with the PLO, the Palestinian people
request from the U.N. secretary-general to intensify his efforts in
this field,'' the petition said.
   President Bush last week announced the suspension of the
18-month U.S. dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
He did so after PLO chief Yasser Arafat failed to condemn an
attempted raid on Israel's coast by Palestinian guerrillas.

   Imelda Marcos' lawyer today mocked prosecutors
for trying to convict her of fraud with ``must-have-beens'' instead
of solid evidence.
   Attorney Gerry Spence said the case against the former
Philippine first lady was: ``She spent a lot of money; it must have
been dirty money. She must have known, of course she must, and
everybody lied.''
   ``That argument is a presumption of guilt,'' he said in his
closing statement today.
   Spence depicted Mrs. Marcos as a loyal wife and mother for 35
years who had been unfairly accused of stealing and excoriated in
the press for her personal habits. She is the widow of former
Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos.
   As for the spending sprees that the government alleges were
financed with money stolen from the Philippine treasury, he said,
``She could have bought every piece of jewelry on the face of this
earth and not be guilty of anything.''
   He reminded jurors that the prosecution was obligated to prove
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ``That burden never changes, and
that doesn't mean there are a lot of must-have-beens,'' Spence said.
   In a daylong closing statement Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Charles LaBella said ``powerful circumstantial evidence'' had shown
that Mrs. Marcos helped steal millions from her country's treasury
and defrauded U.S. banks in buying four New York office buildings,
artworks and jewelry.
   LaBella said her co-defendant, Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi,
had agreed to help Mrs. Marcos and her husband circumvent a 1986
federal court order freezing their U.S. assets _ ``not as a favor,
but for a fee.''
   Khashoggi's attorneys were to follow Spence, with the case
expected to go to the jury Thursday.
   LaBella repeatedly urged the jury to ``use your common sense''
in sorting out the complicated case, which involved testimony by 95
witnesses and thousands of documents over three months.
   ``You can be sure that when taken all together, the evidence
will show Imelda Marcos and Adnan Khashoggi actively participated
in the crimes charged in this indictment,'' he said.
   LaBella also urged the jury not to be swayed by the fact that
Mrs. Marcos fell ill three times during the trial.
   ``As hard as it may be for you, it's your responsibility to make
a decision solely on the facts,'' he said.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan said he planned to sequester
the jury during deliberations.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, could draw a sentence of up to 50 years in
prison and a $1 million fine if convicted on charges of
racketeering, conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice.
   Khashoggi, 54, faces up to 10 years in prison and $500,000 in
fines if convicted of mail fraud and obstructing justice.
   In his closing statement, LaBella said that both Mrs. Marcos and
Khashoggi had used trusted aides to conduct their financial
dealings but that both were fully aware of what was going on.
   The Marcoses were ousted from power in February 1986 and moved
to exile in Hawaii. Marcos, originally charged along with his wife,
died last September.

   The IRA claimed responsibility today for bombing
an elegant social club frequented by Conservative Party leaders and
warned that no government policy-makers would be safe until Britain
withdraws from Ireland.
   A porter was badly injured and eight other people were hurt in
Monday night's explosion at the Carlton Club in London's
fashionable Mayfair district.
   In a statement issued in Dublin, the Irish Republican Army said
an active service unit had ``struck at the heart of Tory rule.''
   It described the club as ``the rest and recreation center for
the British government who legislate for a military occupation of
the North of Ireland.''
   The IRA bombed the Grand Hotel in Brighton during a governing
Conservative Party conference in 1984, killing five people and
narrowly missing Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   ``Like Brighton in 1984,'' the statement said, ``the IRA has
brought the war directly to those who keep the British army on the
streets and in the fields of Ireland.
   ``While such occupation continues, and the nationalist people
face daily oppression, the policy makers and their military arm
will not be safe,'' it said.
   Scotland Yard examined security camera videotapes today for
clues to the bombers.
   Mrs. Thatcher, the club's only female member, called Monday
night's bombing ``one more outrage in a catalog of terrorist
inhumanity.''
   Tory leaders said they were determined to rebuild the club, as
it was after being hit by German bombs in World War II.
   Commander George Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's
anti-terrorist squad, told a news conference ``there's not much
doubt'' that it was the work of the IRA, which killed five people
in a bomb attack on a Conservative Party conference in 1984.
   The bomb, which exploded at 8:40 p.m., was placed inside a
porchway but outside locked security doors, Churchill-Coleman said.
   ``There was a video camera outside the building and we're
examining that tape now,'' he said.
   The most serious injuries were suffered by Charles Henry, 76, a
porter at the club, and Lord Kaberry, 82, a former vice-chairman of
the Conservative Party who is a member of the House of Lords.
   Henry suffered serious head injuries and was recovering from
surgery today in the intensive care unit, said Westminster Hospital
duty manager Kim Hodgon.
   Lord Kaberry was suffering from shock, minor cuts and bruises,
and would be kept in the hospital for observation, Hodgson said.
   Hospital spokeswoman Margaret McDagh said two police constables
treated for smoke inhalation would probably be discharged today.
   Police said five others were slightly injured: two other
employees at the club, another man and two American tourists, Jane
Kahan, 49, and Jacob Boal-Tefhuva, 61, both of New York. They were
in the street at the time of the explosion and were treated for
cuts from flying glass, a spokesman for St. Thomas' Hospital said.
   The IRA, whose armed campaign is intended to undermine British
resolve in Northern Ireland, has renewed its offensive in Britain
and continental Europe. The IRA, which draws its support almost
entirely from Roman Catholics, wants to unite the predominantly
Protestant province with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of
Ireland under socialist rule.
   The Carlton, nestled among the establishment watering holes
known collectively as Clubland, is a favorite haunt of Conservative
Party Cabinet ministers and lawmakers.
   The blocks around the club were bustling with thousands of
tourists heading to restaurants and West End theaters in the
neighborhood when the bomb went off.
   The Fire Brigade rescued 23 people from the three-story
building, and dozens of others escaped on their own.
   ``I hope the timing of this attack, coming during the European
summit, will bring home to the international community just what
depraved and evil crimnals we face,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in Dublin
today at the conclusion of meeting of European Community leaders.

   Here is the text of Nelson Mandela's address
Tuesday to the joint meeting of Congress:
   Speaker Thomas S. Foley: Members of the Congress, it is my great
privilege and I deem it a high honor and personal pleasure to
present to you Mr. Nelson Mandela, Deputy President of the African
National Congress.
   Mr. Mandela: Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, esteemed Members of the
United States Congress, Your Excellencies, Ambassadors, and members
of the diplomatic corps, distinguished guests, ladies and
gentlemen, it is a fact of the human condition that it shall, like
a meteor, a mere brief passing moment in time and space, fleet
across the human stage and pass out of existence.
   Even the golden lads and lasses, as much as the chimney
sweepers, come, and tomorrow are no more. After them all they leave
the people enduring, multiplying, permanent, except to the extent
that the same humanity might abuse its own genius to emulate life
itself.
   And so we have come to Washington, in the District of Columbia,
and into these hallowed chambers of the United States Congress, not
as pretenders to greatness, but as a particle of a people whom we
know to be noble and heroic, enduring, multiplying, permanent,
rejoicing in the expectation and knowledge that their humanity will
be reaffirmed and enlarged by open and unfettered communion with
the nations of the world.
   We have come here to tell you, and through you, your own people,
who are equally noble and heroic, of the troubles and trials, the
fond hopes and aspirations of the people from whom we originate.
   We believe that we know it as a fact that your kind and moving
invitation to ask us to speak here derived from your own desire to
convey a message to our people. And according to your humane
purposes, to give them an opportunity to say what they want of you,
and what they want to make of their relationship with you.
   Our people demand democracy. Our country, which continues to
bleed and suffer pain, needs democracy. It cries out for the
situation where the law will decree that freedom to speak of
freedom constitutes the very essence of legality, and the very
thing that makes for the legitimacy of the constitutional order.
   It stands for the situation where those who are entitled by law
to carry arms as the forces of national security and law and order,
will not turn their weapons against the citizens simply because the
citizens assert that equality, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness are fundamental human rights which are not only
inalienable, but must if necessary be defended with the weapons of
war.
   We fight for and visualize a future in which all shall without
regard to race, color, creed or sex have their right to vote and to
be voted into all elective organs of state. We are engaged in
struggle to ensure that the rights of every individual are
guaranteed and protected through a democratic constitution, the
rule of law, an entrenched bill of rights, which shall be enforced
by an independent judiciary as well as a multiparty political
system.
   Mr. Speaker, we are acutely conscious of the fact that we are
addressing an historic institution for whose creation and integrity
many men and women lost their lives in the war of independence, the
civil war, and the war against Naziism and fascism. That very
history demands that we address you with respect and candor, and
without any attempt to dissemble. What we have said concerning the
political arrangements we seek for our country is seriously meant.
   It is an outcome for which many of us went to prison, for which
many have died in police cells, on the gallows, in our towns and
villages, and in the countries of southern Africa.

   A lawsuit involving two women's singing
groups has struck a sour chord with a magistrate, who says courts
have more important matters.
   ``My, my, my, we do live in a litigious society,'' U.S.
Magistrate Leo Wagner said after Monday's hearing.
   The case involves last year's decision by the 30,000-member
Sweet Adelines to change its name to Harmony International.
   Harmony Inc., which split from Sweet Adelines in 1959, sued,
claiming the name change infringed on its rights.
   Wagner said he would issue an order soon and refer the case for
a settlement conference. He also made it clear he wasn't happy
about the case.
   ``There are 1,800 cases pending in the U.S. District Court
here,'' he said. ``Judges are attempting to preside over cases with
grave concerns. ... We have widows and orphans whose breadwinners
have been killed and are within the grasp of destitution. This is a
busy court.''
   Still, he acknowledged, ``In this country, everyone has free
access to courts _ the right for darn near anybody to come into
court and sue over darn near anything.''

<HEAD>East Germans Face Shortages in Last Hectic Days of Socialism</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Merchants shut stores and cleared shelves
this week to make room for a deluge of Western goods, forcing East
Germans to forage for food and other necessities during the
nation's hectic last days as a socialist state.
   Officials disagreed over who was to blame for widespread
shortages.
   ``There's no soap here, no meat,'' said Ines Kroll, a
25-year-old mother of two as she pushed her shopping cart past
depleted shelves in the only store in Blankenburg, a small town
north of Berlin.
   Many stores selling household goods closed to clear space for
the Western products that will pour into the country after Sunday,
when the Germanys merge their economies.
   Some merchants said they also wanted to avoid taking in large
amounts of East German marks in the days before the nearly
worthless currency is replaced by the valuable West German mark.
   Experts say many East German companies are keeping their
products off the market until next week, when they can sell them
for West German marks.
   Grocery stores have been canceling their orders with East German
suppliers and letting their stocks run out.
   ``Next week, we'll get the West products and the customers will
have West German marks,'' said Liane Fischer, a clerk at the
Blankenburg store.
   Lines of up to 1,000 people snaked down sidewalks as people
converged on banks to fill out paperwork necessary for converting
savings accounts to West German marks.
   The government, in an attempt to protect its ailing industries
from the first rush of Western competition, announced Tuesday a
series of tariffs on Western goods beginning Sunday.
   An 11 percent tariff is to be imposed through the end of the
year, replaced the following quarter by a 6 percent tariff.
   Food will not be affected. East Germany's huge farm collectives
are expected to be battered by Western agricultural producers.
   However, it is uncertain if the tariffs will remain if the
current pace of unification continues and the nations are fully
unified in December.
   Many stores are already stocking West German goods under
agreements made in March that allowed a limited entry of some
products into the country.
   But many staples still were in short supply. Mrs. Kroll said she
could find no detergent and rejected the skimpy selection of meat.
She also had mixed feelings about the end of the East German mark.
   ``My husband mints East German coins for a living,'' she said.
   Some experts say 1 million to 4 million workers will lose their
jobs in the first two years of economic unification.
   Many of the heavy industries that were once the backbone of the
former, centrally planned economy are expected to fail as they face
leaner, more efficient Western concerns.
   The small businesses that will suddenly become independent are
expected to have a much better chance of survival than the large,
inefficient factories that churn out outmoded cars, electronics and
other products.
   Dietmar Mueller, a spkesman for the East German Economics
Ministry, said retailers can make more money by selling West German
goods, which have profit margins sometimes three times as high as
East German goods.
   ``Merchants have not ordered enough from (East German) producers
because merchants think people won't buy them,'' he said. The
result, he said, is that consumers ``have to bite the bullet and
buy the much more expensive West German goods.''
   But Werner Schwartz, spokesman for the Commerce Ministry, which
represents small businesses, said East German goods have merely
sold out.
   The government last month ordered massive price cuts to clear
textiles, electronics and other goods that customers were refusing
to buy. Some televisions, for example, were cut by 90 percent.
   Cord Schwartau, an expert on East German industry for the German
Institute for Economic Research in West Berlin, said both officials
are correct.
   He said the ``amazingly low prices'' of unattractive goods
helped move them off shelves, but that merchants also have been
refusing to order new East German goods because they fear consumers
won't want them.
   He said many East German manufacturers themselves are keeping
their goods off the market so they can take advantage of higher
prices that are expected after Sunday.

   Rival Shiite Moslem militias fought
street battles in the slums of south Beirut today close to where
Western hostages are believed to be held.
   Police said at least four people were wounded in the three-hour
clash between the Syrian-backed Amal militia and the fundamentalist
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said the clashes with automatic rifles and
rocket-propelled grenades broke out in the Ghobeiri district of
south Beirut, a Shiite stronghold. It tapered off three hours later.
   Syrian troops in charge of security in west Beirut and parts of
the southern slums were trying to halt the fighting, the spokesman
said.
   He said the fighting blocked traffic along part of the highway
running to Beirut international airport on the city's southern
edge. The airport remained open, however, and travelers had to use
narrow side streets to get around the gun fights.
   Ghobeiri is two blocks west of Hezbollah's strongholds in the
Bir el-Abed and Hay Madi districts, where most of the 16 Westerners
missing in Lebanon are believed to be held.
   The Western captives are six Americans, four Britons, two West
Germans, two Swiss, an Italian and an Irishman. The longest held is
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   It was not known what triggered the gun battles. But Amal and
Hezbollah have been fighting on and off for three years for control
of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest sect.
   By police count, 1,044 people have been killed and 3,141 wounded
in the power struggle.

<TEXT>
   Indeed, we have even had our political representatives killed in
countries as far away from South Africa as France. Unhappily, our
people continue to die to this day, victims of armed agents of the
state who are still determined to turn their guns against the very
idea of a non-racial democracy. But this is the perspective which
we will trust Congress will feel happy to support and encourage,
using the enormous weight of its prestige and authority as an
eminent representative of democratic practice.
   To deny any person their human rights is to challenge their very
humanity. To impose on them a wretched life of hunger and
deprivation is to dehumanize them, but such has been the terrible
fate of all black persons in our country under the system of
apartheid. The extent of the deprivation of millions of people has
to be seen to be believed.
   The injury is made that more intolerable by the opulence of our
white compatriots and the deliberate distortion of the economy to
feed that opulence.
   The process of the reconstruction of South African society must
and will also entail the transformation of its economy. We need a
strong and growing economy. We require an economy that is able to
address the needs of all the people of our country, that can
provide food, houses, education, health services, social security,
and everything that makes human life human, that makes life joyful
and not a protracted encounter with hopelessness and despair.
   We believe that the fact of the apartheid structure of the South
African economy and the enormous and pressing needs of the people
make it inevitable that the democratic government will intervene in
this economy. Acting through the elected parliament, we have put
the matter to the business community of our country that the need
for a public sector is one of the elements in a many sided strategy
of economic development and restructuring. That has to be
considered by us all, including the private sector.
   The ANC holds no ideological positions which dictate that it
must adopt a policy of nationalization. But, the ANC also holds the
view that there is no self-regulating mechanism within the South
African economy which will, on its own, insure growth with equity.
   At the same time, we take it as a given _ as given _ that the
private sector is an engine of growth and development which is
critical to the success of the mixed economy we hope to see in
future _ in the future South Africa.
   We are accordingly committed to the creation of the situation in
which business people, both South African and foreign, have
confidence in the security of their investments, are assured of a
fair rate of return on their capital, and do business in conditions
of stability and peace.
   We must also make the point, very firmly, that the political
settlement and democracy itself cannot survive unless the material
needs of the people, the bread and butter issue, are addressed as
part of the process of change and as a matter of urgency.
   It should never be that the anger of the poor should be the
finger of accusation pointed at all of us because we failed to
respond to the crisis. of the people for food _ to the cries of the
people for food, for shelter, for the dignity of the individual.
   We shall need your support to achieve the post-apartheid
economic objectives, which are an intrinsic part of the process of
the restoration of the human rights of the people of South Africa.
We would like to approach the issue of our economic cooperation not
as a relationship between donor and recipient, between a dependent
and a benefactor.
   We would like to believe that there is a way in which we could
structure this relationship so that we do indeed benefit from your
enormous resources in terms of your capital, technology, all-around
expertise, your enterprising spirit and your markets.
   This relationship should, however, be one from which your people
should also derive benefit so that we who are fighting to liberate
the very spirit of our entire people from the bondage of the
arrogance of the ideology and practice of white supremacy do not
build a relationship of subservient dependency and foreign
ingratitude.
   One of the benefits that should accrue to both our peoples and
to the rest of the world should surely be that this complex South
African society, which has known nothing but racism for three
centuries, should be transformed into an oasis of good race
relations where the black shall to the white be sister and brother,
a fellow South African, an equal human being, both citizens of the
world.

   Marion Barry told a grand jury last year his
visits to the hotel room of a convicted drug dealer in 1988 were
not ``unusual or criminal,'' according to a tape-recording of his
testimony played today at the mayor's cocaine possession and
perjury trial.
   His assertion contradicted the testimony last week of the
convicted drug dealer, Charles Lewis, who said he and the mayor
smoked crack cocaine on each of four visits Barry allegedly made to
Lewis' hotel room.
   Barry is accused of three felony counts of perjury stemming from
his testimony before the grand jury.
   His taped testimony contradicted Lewis on several other points.
Barry told the grand jury he thought his first visit to Lewis'
hotel room in Washington, D.C., took place on Dec. 17, 1988. Lewis
testified it was Dec. 16.
   Barry said his Dec. 19 visit with Lewis lasted an hour or less.
Lewis testified it lasted well into Dec. 20 and long past the end
of the Monday Night Football game.
   ``Was there anything unusual about the visit'' Dec. 17?
assistant U.S. attorney Judith Retchin asked Barry during one of
the mayor's two grand jury appearances in January 1989.
   ``Not that was unusual or criminal,'' replied the mayor.
   In his grand jury testimony, it was the mayor who first brought
up the subject of drugs.
   Barry told the grand jury that Lewis mentioned the term
``working 50'' in casual conversation and that the mayor thought
the words had something to do with ``hot clothes ... prostitution
or drugs.''
   ``It just popped out'' of Lewis' mouth, ``I didn't pursue it,''
the mayor told the grand jury.
   Lewis testified last week that a ``working 50'' is a bundle of
crack cocaine that retails on the streets of Washington, D.C., for
$50.
   Barry is accused of lying when he told the grand jury that he
had seen nothing to indicate that Lewis was involved with drugs and
that he and Lewis hadn't ever given each other cocaine.
   On Monday, witnesses testified that Barry coerced a woman into
having sex with him and made repeated advances toward others during
a string of drug parties in the Virgin Islands.
   Witnesses testified about the mayor's 1986 and 1988 visits to
the Virgin Islands. They described drug use, drinking and the
alleged sexual encounter with one of them, Linda Creque Maynard.
   In an interview later with Washington station WJLA-TV, Barry
insisted that the jury in his case should be allowed ``to decide on
the credibility of each government witness.''
   He has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine
possession, one count of conspiracy and three felony counts of
lying to a federal grand jury about involvement with drugs by
himself and a friend, Charles Lewis.
   Maynard, a Virgin Islands resident, testified that she was
forced into having sex when she visited Barry in his Virgin Islands
hotel room in March 1988.
   The incident allegedly occurred when Lewis left the two together
for about 10 minutes after Maynard and Lewis had smoked crack
cocaine together in front of the mayor, Maynard testified.
   She said Barry, dressed only in a robe, had been ``after me''
from the moment she entered the hotel room.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin asked her whether Barry
had ``limit(ed) himself sexually with you at all.''
   ``No, he didn't,'' Maynard replied.
   ``Did you have sexual relations in the hotel room?'' Retchin
asked.
   ``Yes,'' Maynard said softly.
   Throughout this section of testimony, Barry sat expressionless
at the defense table, staring at the witness.
   Defense attorney Robert Mance then asked Maynard whether she had
fought Barry ``all over the room'' in order to avoid the incident.
   ``No,'' Maynard replied, ``he already had me down on the bed.''
   Maynard, who said earlier that she had considered it ``an honor
to meet the mayor of Washington D.C.,'' testified that she did not
report the incident to Lewis or local authorities.

   To destroy racism in the world, we together must expunge
apartheid racism in South Africa. Justice and liberty must be our
tools, prosperity and happiness our weapon.
   Mr. Speaker, distinguished Representatives of the American
people, you know this more than we do, that peace is its own
reward. Our own fate, borne by a succession of generations that
reach backwards into centuries, has been nothing but tension,
conflict, and death.
   In a sense, we do not know the meaning of peace, except in the
imagination. But because we have not known true peace in its real
meaning, because for centuries, generations have had to bury the
victims of state violence, we have fought for the right to
experience peace.
   On the initiative of the ANC, a process towards the conclusion
of a peaceful settlement has started. According to a logic dictated
by our situation, we are engaged in an effort which includes the
removal of obstacles to negotiations. This will be followed by a
negotiated determination of the mechanism which will draw up the
new constitution. This should lead to the formation of this
constitution-making institution, and therefore the elaboration and
adoption of a democratic constitution. Elections would then be held
on the basis of this constitution, and for the first time South
Africa would have a body of lawmakers which would, like yourselves,
be mandated by the whole people.
   Despite the admitted commitment of President de Klerk to walk
this road with us, and despite our acceptance of his integrity and
honesty of his purposes.
   We would be fools to believe that the road ahead of us is
without major hurdles. Too many among our white compatriots are
steeped in the ideology of racism to admit easily that change must
come. Tragedy may yet sully the future we pray and work for if
these slaves of the past take up arms in a desperate effort to
resist the process which must lead to the democratic transformation
of our country.
   For those who care to worry about violence in our country, as we
do, it is at these forces that they should focus their attention, a
process in which we are engaged. We must contend still with the
reality that South Africa is a country in the grip of the apartheid
crime against humanity. The consequences of this continue to be
felt, not only within our borders, but throughout Southern Africa,
which continues to harvest the bitter fruits of conflict and war,
especially in Mozambique and Angola. Peace will not come to our
country and region until the apartheid system is ended.
   Therefore, we say we still have a struggle on our hands. Our
common and noble efforts to abolish the system of white minority
domination must continue. We are encouraged and strengthened by the
fact of the agreement between ourselves, this Congress, as well as
President Bush and his administration, that sanctions should remain
in place.
   Sanctions should remain in place because the purpose for which
they were imposed has not yet been achieved. We have yet to arrive
at the point when we can say that South Africa is set on an
irreversible course leading to its transformation into a united
democratic and nonracial country. We plead that you cede the
prerogative to the people of South Africa to determine the moment
when it will be said that profound changes have occurred and an
irreversible process achieved, enabling you and the rest of the
international community to lift sanctions.
   We would like to take this opportunity to thank you all for the
principled struggle you waged which resulted in the adoption of the
historic comprehensive Anti-apartheid Act, which made such a
decisive contribution to the process of moving our country forward
towards negotiations. We request that you go further and assist us
with the material resources which will enable us to promote the
peace process and meet other needs which arise from the changing
situation you have helped to bring about.

   The stand you took established the understanding among the
millions of our people that here we have friends, here we have
fighters. against racism who feel hurt because we are hurt, who
seek our success because they too seek the victory of democracy
over tyranny. And here I speak not only about you, members of the
United States Congress, but also of the millions of people
throughout this great land who stood up and engaged the apartheid
system in struggle _ the masses who have given us such strength and
joy by the manner in which they have received us since we arrived
in this country.
   Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Senators and Representatives, we
went to jail because it was impossible to sit still while the
obscenity of the apartheid system was being imposed on our people.
It would have been immoral to keep quiet while a racist tyranny
sought to reduce an entire people into a status worse than that of
the beasts of the forest.
   It would have been an act of treason against the people and
against our conscience to allow fear and the drive towards
self-preservation to dominate our behavior, obliging us to absent
ourselves from the struggle for democracy and human rights not only
in our country, but throughout the world. We could not have made an
acquaintance through literature with human giants such as George
Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Thomas Jefferson, and not been
moved to act as they were moved to act.
   We could not have had heard of and admired John Brown, Sojourner
Truth, Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. DuBois, Marcus Garvey, Martin
Luther King, Jr., and others, we could not have heard of these and
not be moved to act as they were moved to act.
   We could not have known of your Declaration of Independence and
not elected to join in the struggle to guarantee the people's life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We are grateful to you all
that you persisted in your resolve to have us and other political
prisoners released from jail. You have given us the gift and
privilege to rejoin our people, yourselves, and the rest of the
international community in the common effort to transform South
Africa into a united, a democratic, and nonracial country.
   You have given us the power to join hands with all people of
conscience to fight for the victory of democracy and human rights
throughout the world.
   We are glad that you merged with our own people to make it
possible for us to emerge from the darkness of the prison cell and
join the contemporary process of the renewal of the world. We thank
you most sincerely for all you have done, and count on you to
persist in your noble endeavors to free the rest of our political
prisoners and to emancipate our people from the life of prison that
is apartheid South Africa.
   The day may not be far when we will borrow the words of Thomas
Jefferson and speak of the will of the South African nation. ``In
the exercise of that will, by this united nation of black and white
people, it must surely be that there will be born a country on the
Southern tip if Africa which you will be proud to call a friend and
an ally because of its contribution to the universal striving
towards liberty, human rights, prosperity, and peace among the
peoples.''
   Let that day come now. Let us keep our arms locked together so
that we form a solid phalanx against racism, to ensure that day
comes now. By our common actions, let us ensure that justice
triumphs without delay. When that has come to pass, then shall we
all be entitled to acknowledge the salute when others say of us,
``Blessed are the peacemakers.''
   Thank you for your kind invitation to speak here today, and
thank you for your welcome and the attention you have accorded our
simple message. Thank you.

   A battle is developing in the Communist Party
leadership about whether to go ahead with a crucial congress that
many say will decide the party's future, reformer Boris N. Yeltsin
said today.
   Yeltsin spoke in response to news reports that a member of the
party's Politburo contacted party officials in the Baltic republic
of Estonia to ask their opinion about delaying the congress.
   Increasingly vocal reformers and traditional Soviet Communists
have promised a battle for control of the party at its 28th
Congress, which is scheduled to open July 2 in Moscow.
   A large group of party reformers already has indicated it will
leave if the party is not completely overhauled.
   Some top party members want to hold the congress quickly after
the conservative-minded meeting of 2,700 Communists from the
Russian republic last week, said Yeltsin, president of the Soviet
Union's largest republic.
   ``Others, in order to somehow stabilize the political situation
that has emerged now, are for delaying for a time, perhaps until
fall,'' Yeltsin said.
   Yeltsin said he favored postponement to prepare it more
thoroughly.
   Any decision to postpone the congress would contrast with
previous similar sessions, which were planned months in advance.
   A decision to delay the congress would have to be made by a
plenary meeting of the party's Central Committee, expected within
the next few days.
   ``The plenum will be very difficult,'' Yeltsin said. ``There
will be a real struggle at the plenum.''
   He criticized Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for not
preparing more carefully for the conference of Russian communists
last week. It elected a conservative first secretary, Ivan
Polozkov, who had opposed Yeltsin unsuccessfully last month for the
presidency of the Russian Federation, the largest Soviet republic.
   Gorbachev's spokesman, Arkady A. Maslennikov, told reporters
after Yeltsin's news conference that Gorbachev's position on a
possible delay in the plenum would not be disclosed until the
Central Committee meeting.
   It was not clear exactly when the Central Committee would meet.
   A news service of the Baltic republic Estonia today quoted a
spokesman for the republic's Communist Party as saying that
Politburo member Vadim A. Medvedev had contacted officials about
the possibility of delaying the congress.
   A spokesman for Medvedev, Alexander Vladimirov, and Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said they could not confirm
the reports.

   Dr. Karl A. Menninger, one of the founders
of modern psychiatry, is being treated for abdominal cancer.
   Menninger, whose 97th birthday is July 22, was in fair condition
Tuesday at Stormont-Vail Regional Medical Center.
   A statement issued Monday by the Menninger psychiatric center,
which he co-founded with his father and brother in 1925, said the
cancer diagnosis was made last weekend. A course of treatment has
not been determined, the statement added.
   Menninger was hospitalized June 12 after complaining of
abdominal pain and loss of appetite. He had been going to his
office on the Menninger campus almost daily until then.
   Menninger, who is chairman of the board of trustees of The
Menninger Foundation, often has been called the dean or father of
American psychiatry.
   With his father, Dr. C.F. Menninger, and his brother, Dr.
William C. Menninger, both now deceased, Menninger founded the
clinic in an old farm home on the northwest edge of Topeka 65 years
ago. It later became The Menninger Foundation and is now known
simply as Menninger.

<HEAD>George Washington to be Tried For Treason at Mock Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two centuries after he took the helm of a new
nation, George Washington is being charged with treason, sedition,
high crimes and misdemeanors.
   Not to worry _ the reputation of the Father of His Country is
probably intact. The charges are merely a bit of light-hearted
litigation prompted by a British nobleman's tongue-in-cheek
challenge to U.S. jurists.
   Still, several Chicago lawyers who plan to defend Washington
when the case comes to trial in October aren't letting the British
get the upper hand in this battle.
   ``There is absolutely no question that George Washington, the
father of our country, is not guilty of any crime,'' said Michael
W. Coffield, one of the defense attorneys.
   It all began at a luncheon this month in Washington, D.C.,
during the national meeting of the American Inns of the Court. The
association comprises legal groups inspired by four inns that
operate as law schools, eateries and fraternal organizations for
British jurists.
   Lord Goff of Chievely, a British lawyer and nobleman, launched
the battle at the luncheon when he called Washington a traitor. He
challenged his American colleagues to prove otherwise.
   ``We dumped over a few tables and were the first to accept that
challenge,'' said Jim Figliulo, secretary-treasurer of the Chicago
Inn of the Court and a defense team member.
   Queen Elizabeth II's chief prosecutor was sitting at a nearby
table and agreed to represent Britain in the challenge.
   The Chicago defenders say the trial likely will be held in the
Old Bailey, London's criminal courthouse, and actors may be hired
to portray Washington and other revolutionary-era heroes.
   Depending on the outcome, Figliulo said, ``We might invite them
back for a trial of King George.''

   The National PTA Convention voted today to
support legislation that would prohibit businesses from forcing
students to view advertising as a condition of receiving donations.
   The resolution did not deal specifically with Channel One, a
controversial 12-minute daily news program that includes two
one-minute commercials. However, the program was mentioned in
debate.
   To obtain Channel One, schools sign a contract that loans them
free color televisions, a satellite dish and two videocassette
recorders for the life of a contract as long as the program is
aired in its entirety, including commercials.
   The resolution adopted today says that donations of the
equipment should not be offered on the condition that students view
advertising. It urged state and federal legislation to bar the
practice.
   Some delegates argued that newspapers have advertising and are
viewed in the schools, but others argued that no one was forcing
students to read those ads or watch commercials on other television
stations.
   ``The operation, by selection of program content, could wield a
great deal of influence on the minds of youngsters who don't have
the option of turning to an alternative channel or turning the set
off,'' said Sharon Voliva, a delegate from Dolton, Ill. ``The
commercialism is much more damaging than the commercials.''
   The convention also approved a resolution urging Congress to
further study pesticide residues and children.
   The pesticide resolution said preschool children have greater
exposure to pesticide residues because they eat more food relative
to their weight and consume larger quantities of fruit, which can
have a higher likelihood of pesticide contamination.
   The group asked that Congress clarify the Environmental
Protection Agency's authority on pesticides and dietary exposure.

   Morris Karlea escaped with 10 of his
18 children, three of his four wives and the clothes on his back
when he fled Liberia after civil war erupted six months ago.
   Karlea, 43, spoke of the soldiers serving President Samuel Doe,
who fought a rebel army that invaded Liberia from the Ivory Coast
on Dec. 24.
   ``When Doe's soldiers arrived we were all scared,'' says Karlea,
a coffee farmer from the village of Garplay. ``When they got into
town, they were just shooting and shooting. They burned my car.
They broke down our home, taking all our things.''
   There are about 570 Liberian refugees in Banneu, a town of 3,700
people a couple of miles from the Nyon River that forms Liberia's
border with Ivory Coast. Most of the residents live in thatched mud
huts and grow coffee, corn and the potato-like cassava.
   Mussa Jabateh, 34, Karlea's half-brother and also a farmer, fled
with his five children before government troops reached Garplay.
Life in Banneu suits him. ``We eat here every day, we live a free
life,'' he says. ``The people are too good to us.''
   Villagers and refugees eat meals mostly of rice and both the
leaves and roots of cassava. Once a month the Red Cross delivers a
load of frozen fish.
   The National Patriotic Front's rebel army, commanded by ex-Doe
aide Charles Taylor, now claims to control 90 percent of Liberia.
An estimated 300,000 of the country's 2.5 million people fled after
the fighting began.
   It is not just a battle to overthrow Doe _ in many cases the
fighting has pitted ethnic Gios and Manos against Krahns and
Mandingos. Doe is a Krahn.
   Terrified Liberians tell of government soldiers slaughtering
citizens because they were Gios and Manos. There are also
allegations of rebel massacres of Krahns and Mandingos.
   Karlea's mother is a Gio, his father a Mandingo. He had to get
somewhere fast. ``I brought nothing, just my trousers and my
shirt,'' he says, gesturing to his filthy, torn clothes and ragged
sandals.
   War and life in a jungle village have taken a toll on Marthe
Lawehy, who is 29 but looks much older. She came to Banneu in
January. Her husband, who works as a power saw operator in Gbelay,
near the Ivorian border, stayed behind. She brought four children
with her, leaving three more in Liberia with her mother-in-law.
   ``When Doe's soldiers came, they burned down my house and killed
three people in town. Me and my children slept three days in the
bushes,'' she recalls.
   ``Charles Taylor's soldiers saved us. They brought us to the
waterside and came here,'' she says. ``For that reason I love the
man.''
   Banneu village chief Thoma Mabea has thrown his village open to
the refugees. ``These are my brothers and I welcome them. I've
turned over my own room to them to stay in.''
   Karlea, the father of 18, is now trying to build a hut for his
family and wants to start a farm here. ``It's war in the country,
so I can't go back,'' he says. ``But I want to. Home is sweet.''

<NOTE>EDS: Retransmitting a0609 to remove garble.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peace Corps staffers have been pulled
out of rural areas and brought to the capital following
intelligence reports that Communist rebels planned to kill
volunteers, officials announced Tuesday.
   The move was the latest in a series of measures taken in the
wake of threats against Americans by the Communist New People's
Army. It has been fighting 21 years to establish a Marxist
government in the Philippines.
   Last week, the Philippine military said rebels in Manila plan to
target Americans and other foreigners for assassination and
kidnapping over the next six months.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said Ambassador Nicholas
Platt ordered the recall of Peace Corps staffers last weekend but
delayed the public announcement for security reasons.
   He said no decision had been made on when the 261 volunteers
would be allowed to return to their posts, mostly in remote, rural
areas where security is poor.
   Schrager said the embassy had received a report that Peace Corps
volunteers had been added to the target list of the New People's
Army, which is believed to have killed eight Americans here since
April 1989.
   He refused to identify the source of the report but said the
embassy took it seriously.
   In Washington, Peace Corps director Paul Coverdell said he was
taking the step as a ``precautionary measure'' and that all
volunteers are safe.
   Communist rebels claimed responsibility for killing two American
airmen last month near the U.S.-run Clark Air Base. They threatened
to kill more until all U.S. troops leave this country.
   Last week, the U.S. Embassy warned Americans to take precautions
against terrorism in advance of the next round of U.S.-Philippine
talks on the future American military bases here. Those talks are
expected in August.
   The lease on the bases expires in September 1991, and the rebels
have demanded they be closed.
   At the Admiral Hotel, where many Peace Corps volunteers were
temporarily housed, several said they were ordered to Manila on
short notice but were not briefed on the reason beyond the
embassy's official statement.
   ``Most of the Filipinos in my area support Cory (President
Corazon Aquino), have nostalgic feelings for (the late President
Ferdinand) Marcos and want nothing to do with the NPA,'' said one
volunteer, who works on an agricultural project in Nueva Vizcaya
province.
   He and the other volunteers declined to give their names.
   Coverdell issued a statement saying: ``I wish to assure
relatives and friends of the volunteers that the volunteers are
safe and emphasize that we are taking these steps only as a
precautionary measure.'' He said most of the volunteers were
already in Manila.
   The rebels have made no specific public threats against Peace
Corps volunteers but have charged that U.S. and Japanese aid
workers secretly assist the Philippine government in its
counterinsurgency operations.
   Both Washington and Tokyo deny the charges.
   On May 29, rebels on Negros island kidnapped Fumio Mizuno, a
training director for a private Japanese aid group, the
Organization for Industrial, Spiritual, and Cultural Advancement.
   Negros authorities have appointed a team to negotiate Mizuno's
release, but no talks have been held.
   Last week, the Philippine military said troops arrested 10
members of a rebel assassination squad and seized documents
indicating the guerrillas plan to target foreigners.
   Military sources said the assassination list included one
American, but they refused to reveal his name.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said one
American embassy staffer was spirited out the country this month.
   The U.S. Embassy estimates there are up to 140,000 Americans,
including 40,000 affiliated with the U.S. military, in the
Philippines.
   Peace Corps volunteers are stationed throughout the main island,
Luzon, and the central Visayas chain, including Negros. Volunteers
were recalled from the southern island of Mindanao in 1985 because
of lawlessness and never returned.
   Volunteers are involved in projects including education,
environment, agriculture and community development.

   Egypt has lifted visa requirements for
Syrian citizens, Egyptian Ambassador Mustapha Abdul-Aziz Mursi
announced Tuesday.
   The move was seen as a further step in the restoration of full,
friendly relations between the two Arab nations. Syria cut ties
after Egypt in 1979 signed a peace agreement with Israel. Syria
restored diplomatic relations in December.
   ``In view of the brotherly ties and close relations between the
two brotherly peoples of Syria and Egypt, the Arab Republic of
Egypt has decided to exempt all Syrian brothers who wish to visit
Egypt from visa requirements,'' Mursi said.
   Syria was among Egypt's bitterest enemies after the late
President Anwar Sadat signed the U.S.-brokered peace treaty with
Israel.

   Nelson Mandela appealed to Congress today to
support the struggle for a multiracial democracy in South Africa
and said his country ``continues to bleed and suffocate'' under the
repression of white-minority rule.
   ``Our people continue to die to this day, victims of armed
agents of the state who are still determined to turn their guns
against the very idea of a racial democracy,'' the South African
black leader told a rapt audience of lawmakers, diplomats and
Cabinet officers in the House of Representatives chamber.
   Mandela was interrupted by standing applause several times, once
when he said the U.S. economic sanctions against South Africa
should not be lifted now. ``The purpose for which they were imposed
has not been achieved.''
   Mandela did not specifically address his support of violence as
a last-resort alternative in the struggle for freedom, but he
reminded his audience of the many Americans who died for freedom in
the Revolutionary War, the Civil War and two world wars.
   Mandela was greeted with prolonged applause as he made his way
into the chamber. He beamed a wide smile as he mounted the podium.
   Despite the public show of support for Mandela, some members did
not attend as a show of protest over Mandela's support for Cuba,
Libya and the Palestine Liberation Organization and his backing of
armed struggle.
   Conservative Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., said he
boycotted the speech as a ``matter of principle.'' Rep. Larry
Smith, D-Fla., also stayed away.
   Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., said he was disappointed
Mandela continued to advocate armed struggle. ``Who is the real
Nelson Mandela?'' he asked.
   But other praised the speech. ``It's an extraordinary day,''
said Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif. He said lawmakers heard ``a
magnificent black man ... speak powerfully and eloquently as a man
of peace.''
   In his speech, Mandela said, ``We would be fools to believe that
the road ahead of us is without major hurdles. Too many among our
white compatriots are slaves in the ideology of racism to admit
easily that change must come.''
   He added, pointedly: ``For those who care to worry about
violence in our country as we do, it is at these forces that they
should focus their attention.''
   He credited the economic sanctions in place against South Africa
for contributing to his release from prison after 27 years. And
said they should remain in place until a new constitution is passed
and democratic elections held.
   And he clearly preferred to talk of his vision of a peaceful
future:
   ``Let us keep our arms locked together so that we form a solid
phalanx against racism to ensure that that day comes now. By our
common actions, let us ensure that justice triumphs without delay.''
   Envisioning a day when the white-minority government has been
replaced, Mandela said the country's economy must be transformed.
But, addressing administration concerns about his socialist
economic views, Mandela said, ``The ANC holds no ideological
positions which dictate that it must adopt a policy of
nationalization.''
   Mandela asked for resources for the ANC, even though U.S.
officials say President Bush has been reluctant to provide direct
financial support for the ANC because the group has refused to
renounce violence.
   ``Here we have friends. Here we have fighters against racism who
feel hurt because we are hurt, who seek our success because we,
too, seek the victory of democracy over tyranny.''
   In their struggle for democracy, Mandela said, black South
Africans are following the examples of George Washington, Abraham
Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson, as well as black American leaders
like Martin Luther King Jr.
   ``Our people demand democracy. Our country, which continues to
bleed and suffocate, needs democracy,'' he said.
   Mandela had a separate breakfast meeting with members of the
Congressional Black Caucus and singer Harry Belafonte.
   Later, several thousand jubilant people gathered for a noontime
rally to honor Mandela on Pennsylvania Avenue. Although organizers
said Mandela might stop, he did not, waving instead from his
limousine.
   Mandela, who met with Bush on Monday, was wrapping up his visit
to Washington later in the day after several other public
appearances, including an afternoon outdoor rally and an evening
speech to a crowd that paid $10 or $25 per ticket. In between, he
was meeting with congressional leaders.
   He was traveling to Atlanta on Wednesday, the next stop on his
eight-city tour of the United States.
   Mandela, 71, was honored at a dinner Monday night hosted by
Sens. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, and Terry Sanford, D-N.C.
   Meanwhile Monday, Senate leaders decided to postpone a
procedural vote on a civil rights bill, opposed by the
administration, scheduled for today. Republicans complained that
the vote was a ploy by Democrats to embarrass them during Mandela's
visit.

   A federal jury awarded more than $15
million in damages to two telephone directory publishing companies
who complained of unfair competition by Southwestern Bell Corp. and
several subsidiaries.
   The jury on Monday awarded actual damages of $5 million
requested by Great Western Directories Inc., and $9,400 by Canyon
Directories. Under antitrust law, the damages are trebled.
   The jury also awarded more than $1 million in attorney fees.
   Great Western publishes telephone directories, including yellow
pages, in nine Texas cities, including Amarillo, and the Oklahoma
cities of Lawton and Enid.
   Canyon Directories publishes telephone directories, including
yellow pages, for three towns in the Amarillo area.
   Great Western and Canyon Directories said Southwestern Bell
exerted a double squeeze on their potential profits by increasing
the fee to directory companies for Bell's listings while decreasing
advertising rates 40 percent in its own white and yellow pages,
which it improved.
   Southwestern Bell had maintained that its actions amounted to
lawful competition.

<HEAD>West Germany Unveils Proposals To Unify By End Of Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUD S. BEELMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany unveiled proposals
Tuesday to unify the two Germanys politically by mid-December and
finally end the countries' 40-year split along Cold War lines.
   The proposals, in the form of a ``Discussion Paper'' released by
the West German Interior Ministry, were made public just five days
before the two countries merge their economies and social
institutions.
   Under proposed wording for a treaty on political unification,
East Germany would officially join West Germany the day after
elections for a joint German parliament. West and East German
politicians have proposed Dec. 9 or Dec. 16 as possible dates for
the balloting.
   West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he
expected the East German Cabinet to decide Wednesday to begin
negotiations on the political treaty. He added that the pact should
be ready for debate in both parliaments by early September.
   The parliaments of both countries last week ratified a treaty
outlining the monetary, economic and social union that is to take
effect Sunday. On that day, the West German mark officially
replaces the nearly worthless East German mark and 40 years of
rigid, socialist economic policy give way to free-market rules.
   The victors and vanquished from World War II are still working
on the international ramifications of German unity, namely the
military posture of a united Germany and the disposition of the
380,000 Soviet troops on East German soil.
   West Germany is a member of the Western NATO alliance, and the
Allies have insisted a united Germany remain there. The Soviets
have rejected that idea. East Germany has been the most
strategically important member of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, as
the first line of defense against the West.
   The discussion paper notes that the so-called ``two-plus-four''
talks among the World War II victors and the Germanys are expected
to be concluded by December and that the political treaty is
conditional on the results of those talks.
   Other proposed articles of the political treaty declare that the
five pre-war states that now comprise East Germany as well as the
city of Berlin would be individual states under a united Germany.
   Proposed wording for a third article of the treaty says,
``Germans in both parts of Germany will form a united nation of
people.''
   Bonn wants to limit the political treaty to only those laws and
regulations that differ between East and West Germany and that must
be changed before political unification can be achieved.
   Issues which initially could be left unresolved include the
countries' differing abortion laws, Schaeuble told West German
reporters.
   In West Germany, a woman must prove medical necessity or
financial hardship to have an abortion. In East Germany, abortions
are free on demand in the first trimester of pregnancy.
   Schaeuble also suggested it was not absolutely necessary for
political parties in both parts of Germany to have the same minimum
election requirements in a joint election.
   In West Germany, political parties must receive at least 5
percent of the total vote for representation in parliament. There
is no such limit in East Germany, and politicians there have been
arguing for a limit lower than 5 percent so that their parties are
not at such a disadvantage in a united German election.
   Schaeuble also told reporters Monday night that he wanted to
have representatives of the European Economic Community observe the
negotiations on a final unification treaty.
   In a related development, West German Finance Minister Theo
Waigel, in East Berlin on Tuesday, said quick unification is
important because of the unstable situation in the Soviet Union.
   Waigel, in an apparent reference to President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's uncertain grip on events in his turbulent nation, said
``we need to go through the door to unification because it can
close shut again.''

   Experts say some of the drugs sent to Soviet
Armenia for victims of the 1988 earthquake were useless or even
dangerous, and they say there could be similar problems with
emergency supplies now being sent to Iran.
   Supplies sent to Armenia included pharmaceuticals that came from
stocks of expired drugs and others of a type no longer sold,
according to an article in The Lancet, a respected British medical
journal.
   ``The quantities of expired and useless drugs are especially
worrying,'' the June 9 issue said. ``The supply of massive amounts
of drugs for the purpose of humanitarian aid still represents a
good way of disposing of stocks of expired drugs or of those that
are normally no longer marketable.''
   The article was wriiten Dr. Philippe Autier, an epidemiologist
and researcher in public health for the European Association for
Health and Development. Also contributing to the article were
members of Doctors Without Borders, a French humanitarian group,
and the Soviet Armenian Ministry of Health.
   ``We know exactly the same problems are happening now in Iran,''
Autier said in a telephone interview Monday.
   Adam Kellett-Long, a spokesman for the British Red Cross, said
his organization was sending its first shipment of drugs to Iran on
Tuesday after receiving a list of needed medication and supplies.
His organization only has sent drugs that are requested bu Iran.
   Iranian officials said more than 130 planes had arrived since
Sunday carrying supplies and medicines.
   Unlike Armenia, Iran ``is much more controlled. The Iranian Red
Crescent has been very strict on what it will accept. But of course
there are a lot of other groups and countries involved which may
not be taking the same care,'' said Kellet-Long.
   After the Armenian earthquake on Dec. 7, 1988, which killed
25,000 people, international relief agencies and governments rushed
in 5,000 tons of drugs, consumable medical supplies and other
equipment, the report said.
   Medical workers needed injectable painkillers like morphine,
antibiotics, anesthetics, intravenous fluids, syringes and needles
_ the same supplies now needed in Iran. A major quake killed in
Iran on Thursday killed at least 50,000 people, according to
officials.
   Drugs worth about $55 million were sent to Armenia, but only
about 30 percent of them were available when they were most needed
because they arrived unsorted and were impossible to identify, the
Lancet report said.
   None of the boxes was labeled in Armenian and few in Russian, it
said. In 24 warehouses in the Armenian capital of Yerevan, 238
kinds of antibiotics were labeled in 21 languages, it said.
   ``In Spitak, the most badly affected area, pharmacists wasted
about two-thirds of their time merely looking for and identifying
useful drugs among the relief parcels,'' the report said.
   Autier said experts know that only 30 to 40 types of medicines
are commonly needed in most earthquake relief efforts.
   About 11 percent of the drugs were useless, including nasal
spray and drugs for treating tropical diseases such as malaria, it
said.
   Eight percent of the drugs had expired by the time they arrived,
the report said. Some of these drugs, such as tetracycline, were
potentially dangerous.
   For a year following the catastrophe, the Armenian ministry
worked with Doctors Without Borders making an inventory of the
drugs.
   By the end of their work, about 21 percent of the drugs were set
to expire or already had expired.

   Czechoslovakia will become the third newly

U.S. officials said Tuesday.
   Twenty-two specialists in English teacher training and English
as a foreign language will leave for the Central European country
later this year as the result of an agreement signed Monday in
Prague by Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier and Peace Corps Director
Paul D. Coverdell, the agency said in a statement.
   Another 40 volunteers are expected to be sent by mid-1991, the
statement said.
   Teams of English language-teaching specialists left earlier this
month to start Peace Corps programs in Poland and Hungary, the
first established in former communist-ruled countries.
   Other governments in the region have made contact about having
Peace Corps units in their countries, said corps spokeswoman Paula
Kuzmich.
   More than 6,100 Americans serve as Peace Corps volunteers in 72
countries.

   Donald Trump's bankers have approved a 30-day,
$20 million loan after agreeing in principle to a bigger long-term
financial rescue for the cash-strapped developer, a source said
today.
   An immediate $20 million cash infusion will enable Trump to make
necessary bond payments while finishing touches are placed on a
complex $65 million bailout, a participant in the negotiations said.
   The source, who spoke on condition that his name not be used,
said it could take anywhere from 30 to 60 days to draw up the final
documents on the financial package intended to shore up Trump's
empire.
   A spokesman for Trump, Dan Klores, refused to comment on the
report of a deal but said he hoped to have a statement later in the
day.
   Some 65 to 70 banks and their attorneys are involved in the
process. All but one bank agreed in principle to the deal.
   The German bank Dresdner Bank AG continued to balk but attorneys
decided that Dresdner's endorsement wasn't essential.
   Dresdner, whose $15 million loan to Trump is secured by the
first lien on the Trump Tower Fifth Avenue residential and
commercial skyscraper, has been opposed to placing a second lien on
the building.
   ``It was decided last night that Dresdner's holdout wouldn't
prevent the deal from going forward,'' the source said.
   Trump faces a midnight deadline to cover principal and interest
payments due on bonds sold to finance the Trump Castle hotel and
casino in Atlantic City, N.J. The process of making those payments
began today after seven key banks extended the $20 million bridge
loan to Trump.
   Trump had missed a June 15 deadline for the casino bond payment
but a 10-day grace period extended the time to tonight. A
declaration of default could allow creditors to seize various Trump
properties used as collateral to back the bonds and other loans,
and could affect his licenses to run casinos in Atlantic City.
   Trump also is overdue on a $30 million bank loan payment to a
group led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust.
   In spite of the German bank's continued reluctance to accept the
bailout, it was considered possible that Dresdner might eventually
agree to go in on the deal during the time it takes to complete the
paperwork, the source said.
   The long-term $65 million bailout and debt restructuring package
contains numerous stipulations, including a requirement that Trump
sell assets to raise cash. The source involved in the negotiations
said the agreement didn't specify which properties Trump must sell.
   Under the plan, the banks reportedly would extend Trump $65
million to meet any payments due and would suspend some payments on
his $2 billion in bank loans in exchange for equity in some of his
properties.
   The new loan package reportedly would contain tough restrictions
on how much the freespending Trump could spend on charitable
contributions and personal and household expenses. Some published
reports earlier in the week had said that the tentative agreement
limited his spending to $450,000 per month in the first year, less
in subsequent years.
   The loan package also reportedly requires Trump to stick to a
business plan, hire a chief financial officer, adopt a system of
accounting controls and change accounting firms.

   Nelson Mandela drove by his biggest open rally
in the nation's capital Tuesday without stopping.
   The African National Congress leader had not been scheduled to
address the several thousand people who gathered in downtown
Washington, but rally organizers had hoped he would halt his
motorcade when he saw the jubilant crowd and hundreds of balloons.
   ``I thought there was going to be a little more,'' said one
young woman who waited in the hot sun to catch a glimpse of Mandela
on his way from the U.S. Capitol.
   ``The man's tired,'' said another woman who had waited through
several speeches by local politicians.
   The hastily arranged rally caused a rift between Mandela aides
who saw the Washington stop as an important working visit and local
activists who wanted to celebrate his presence in a city that is
watching its mayor stand trial on drug charges.
   But Mandela's car and two-block motorcade pressed on down the
same route taken by presidential inaugural motorcades and Mandela
only waved from behind a closed window.
   Two white South African tourists, Ian and Karin Wood, joined the
crowd on Pennsylvania Avenue. ``We're really anxious to see him.
We've heard so much about him and he has such an aura,'' said Ian
Wood.
   ``This brings us together,'' said Councilwoman Nadine Winter,
who had pushed for the noontime celebration. ``It's something
positive, something we can feel good about.''
   Police had no immediate estimate on how many people had gathered
at Freedom Plaza across from city hall or how many were lining the
motorcade route, but there appeared to be several thousand along
the streets who watched the brief parade. ``It was just a nice
motorcade, not really a parade,'' said D.C. Police Lieutenant
Reginald Smith.
   Winter organized the event after all 19,000 seats for in a
tickets-only rally Tuesday night were sold.

<HEAD>Diplomats Close to Agreement on Fund to Save Ozone Layer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shut away in a small room on the banks of the
Thames, a group of diplomats haggled Tuesday over an international
accord to save the ozone layer.
   They met through the weekend and until late Tuesday, preparing
for a meeting in November of environment ministers and other
officials from nearly 100 countries. That meeting may for the first
time impose an international ban on a group of chemicals that
threatens the planet.
   The three-day ministerial conference also will consider a
proposal to create an international fund to help developing
countries pay the high price for technology that could help the
ozone layer.
   Conference sources said the diplomats were close to agreement on
such a fund, which the United States opposed until two weeks ago.
   In small working groups, they have been banging heads over how
decisions will be made for the fund and over who will pay the
estimated $2 billion to $7 billion bill to eliminate
ozone-depleting chemicals.
   The fund would be a milestone in ``green diplomacy'' and could
serve as a model for future accounts that will be needed to pay for
solving other environmental problems, such as global warming.
   World leaders are set to debate global warming, a result of the
so-called greenhouse effect, at a November conference in Geneva.
   ``Everyone is very tired,'' said one diplomat, speaking
privately between meetings in a room at the International Maritime
Organization. ``But what we are doing has never been done before,
establishing an environmental agreement with money to back it up.''
   The ministers' work, if successful, will extend and strengthen
the Montreal Protocol of 1987, already considered an environmental
watershed.
   Acting with unusual speed, 56 nations agreed in September 1987
to cut the use of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, in half by 1996.
   Last year, in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence on
the effect of CFCs on the ozone layer, 81 nations decided in
principle to ban them by the year 2000.
   In London, the ministers will debate whether to move up the ban
to 1997 and at what speed to phase out the chemicals. The 12-nation
European Community, along with Scandinavia, Australia and New
Zealand, wants to move up the ban. The United States and Japan are
opposed.
   The signatories to the Montreal Protocol also hope to persuade
more developing nations to sign it _ especially India and China,
which account for 40 percent of the world population and could be
major CFC users.
   Both say they won't sign unless the rich nations help pay for
the more expensive chemicals to replace CFCs.
   CFCs, used in aerosol sprays, refrigerators, foams and cleaning
solvents, destroy ozone.
   Ozone is a gas thinly sprinkled through the stratosphere that
filters out harmful ultraviolet rays. Scientists say that without
ozone, life on Earth would die.
   Higher ultraviolet radiation damages the human immune system,
causes skin cancer and cataracts, harms crops and disrupts sea life.
   The ministers are likely to agree to ban halons and carbon
tetrachloride, in addition to CFCs, by the year 2000. Both are used
in firefighting.
   Scientific studies overwhelmingly show the ozone layer will not
be fully restored unless all the severely damaging chemicals are
banned worldwide and some of the less harmful substitutes are
strictly controlled.
   Environmentalists and conference observers say the stakes extend
beyond the meeting. They say negotiations on ozone, which are
backed by a strong international consensus, are a trial run for
tougher battles looming over global warming.

<TEXT>
   The Vatican on Tuesday ruled out public
dissent by theologians, striking at those challenging papal
authority and the church's ban on birth control.
   Saying the church has suffered ``serious harm'' from open
criticism, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ordered
theologians to uphold its moral teaching or keep quiet.
   ``To succumb to the temptation of dissent ... is to allow the
leaven of infidelity to the Holy Spirit to start to work,'' the
commission said in a 28-page document approved by Pope John Paul II.
   The document was expected to draw sharp criticism from liberal
Catholics, who have charged that the Vatican is quietly extending
the scope of church teachings treated as infallible, and displaying
an authoritarian attitude.
   The document defended punishments meted out to dissidents in
recent years and declared that adherence to church doctrine is not
a matter of free speech.
   It also affirmed the right of the church to speak out on issues
of sexual morality, rejecting the idea that its voice should be
limited to economic and social issues.
   West German Cardinal Josef Ratzinger, the head of the
congregation and the pope's main guardian of orthodoxy, told a news
conference the document was a response to a ``climate of conflict''
fomented by dissident theologians.
   These include a group of 170 German-speaking theology professors
from four countries who publicly criticized the pope last year.
Their statement, known as the Cologne Declaration, attacked John
Paul for his opposition to artificial birth control and his use of
authority, particularly his choice of conservative bishops.
   Ratzinger said preparation of his ``Instruction on The Ecclesial
Vocation of The Theologian'' began before the Cologne Declaration.
But he said the German protest was an expression of the same
tensions that prompted the writing of his document.
   Ratzinger rejected dissent as a legitimate form of expression,
describing it instead as a political ploy for power in the church.
   During the pope's 11{-year papacy, several theologians have een
punished for straying from church positions. They include the Rev.
Hans Kung of Switzerland, who was stripped of his right to teach
theology in 1979, and the Rev. Charles E. Curran, barred from
teaching at Catholic University in Washington D.C. in 1987.
   The Vatican document acknowledged theologians might in some
cases question ``the timeliness, the form, or even the contents''
of some church teaching. In that event, they should try to resolve
the differences in dialogue with bishops, it said.
   ``In cases like these, the theologian should avoid turning to
the mass media ... for it is not by seeking to exert the pressure
of public opinion that one contributes to the clarification of
doctrinal issues and renders service to the truth.''
   If the theologian still cannot accept the teaching, he should
keep his objections to himself, the document said.
   ``Such a situation can certainly prove a difficult trial,'' it
said. ``It can be a call to suffer for the truth, in silence and
prayer, but with the certainty, that if the truth really is at
stake, it will ultimately prevail.''
   Asked whether theologians could publish books or articles
espousing dissident views, Ratzinger said they should take their
case to the ``competent forum'' in the church.
   Stressing the collaboration between theology and official church
teaching, the document noted theologians take an oath of fidelity
binding them to present doctrine ``in its integrity and with full
accuracy.''
   ``The theologian who is not disposed to think with the church
contradicts the commitment he freely and knowingly accepted to
teach in the name of the church,'' it said.
   The document stressed theologians must adhere not only to
infallible pronouncements or documents. Infallibility means freedom
from error in matters of faith and morals and is rarely applied.
   It paraphrased from Humanae Vitae, Pope Paul VI's 1968
encyclical reaffirming the church ban on contraception, saying
church doctrine ``also extends to that which concerns the natural
law.''
   Ratzinger's report said the church cannot be run like a
democracy, a position voiced by the pope on several occasions.
   ``Standards of conduct, appropriate to civil society or the
workings of a democracy, cannot be purely and simply applied to the
church,'' it said.
   In the news conference, Ratzinger rejected the idea the church
is ``a last bastion of an outdated authoritarianism.''

   The movie will be called ``Lucy &amp; Desi: Before the Laughter.''
It will dramatize the relationship of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz

their series on CBS in 1951.
   CBS said Tuesday it would hold open auditions for the title
roles on July 16 in Los Angeles, in Miami on July 18, and in New
York on July 20.
   ``In addition to a possible reading, prospective actors should
be prepared to perform a favorite Luci or Desi routine from `I Love
Lucy,' no longer than one minute in length, for the auditions,''
CBS said.
   Ball, who outlived Arnaz, died last year at age 77.

   But for the second time in less than a week, officials delayed
issuing a complete blueprint designed to save the bird without
devastating the region's timber industry.
   ``The admininstration is deeply concerned both about endangered
speies and the livelihood of families in the Pacific Northwest who
depend on timber production,'' Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter said.
   Yeutter and Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. appeared at a

   Screenplay writer Joe Eszterhas commanded a
record $3 million price for his latest film script.
   Carolco Pictures outbid at least 10 studios to buy ``Basic
Instinct,'' a steamy thriller about a policeman and a
writer-psychologist.
   The $3 million is a record for a ``spec'' screenplay, which is
written before going up for bids by the studios, rather than
written under contract.
   ``I've always felt that the script was at the heart of the
movie,'' Eszterhas said. ``If you're going to pay actors and
directors, there's nothing wrong with paying the writer, too.''
   Eszterhas, who wrote the screenplays for ``Jagged Edge,''
``Betrayed'' and ``The Music Box,'' generally commands more than $1
million for a movie script.
   ``We bought a great project,'' Thomas Levine, Carolco vice
president for corporate development, said Monday.

   Ze'ev Chafets, a former Israeli government
spokesman and native of Michigan, has written a book about Detroit
that depicts it as the nation's first Third World city.
   ``Devil's Night and Other True Tales of Detroit,'' to be
published by Random House this fall, says Detroit has a black
leadership that sees itself engaged in a struggle with a
white-dominated world.
   Chafets, 43, was born in nearby Pontiac. After emigrating to
Israel in 1969, he spent five years in the Israeli army and became
a government spokesman under then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin.
   The idea for the book came when he watched Devil's Night arson
during a return visit to the Detroit area, Chafets said.
   Chafets, author of three other books, describes the racial
polarization in metropolitan Detroit between the majority black
central city of 1 million people and the suburbs, whose 3.2 million
residents are overwhelmingly white.
   ``The city and suburbs are separated by a cultural and emotional
gap as wide as any that divides hostile nations,'' he writes.

   A federal judge says the Rev. Donald Wildmon
must stop using a pamphlet to support his group's anti-pornography
campaign because it misrepresents the artist's work and may harm
the artist's reputation.
   The judge, however, said Wildmon's Tupelo, Miss.-based American
Family Association could use the pamphlets if it makes it clear the
pictures being used were only fragments and not the artist's entire
work.
   The case was brought to U.S. District Court in Manhattan after
East Village artist David Wojnarowicz learned the organization was
distributing pamphlets with pieces of his work taken from much
larger collages.
   One picture, taken from a multilayered work, shows Christ with a
hypodermic needle in his arm.
   Wildmon's group mailed out about 6,000 pamphlets to members of
Congress, clergy and media outlets to bolster its view that the
National Endowment for the Arts supports pornography.
   The NEA gave the Illinois State University galleries a $15,000
grant, which they used to hold a Wojnarowicz retrospective last
winter and publish a catalogue containing his work.
   After viewing Wojnarowicz's work, Wildmon said, ``I kind of got
sick to my stomach.'' He testified at a one-day trial that he was
``angry and upset because tax dollars went to help pay for some of
this.''
   Wojnarowicz claimed the pamphlet was a gross distortion of his
work and filed a $1 million damage lawsuit, charging the pamphlet
violated copyright laws.
   Judge William C. Conner on Monday agreed in part with
Wojnarowicz and issued a temporary injunction saying the AFA could
not use the pamphlet as it was.
   ``The pamphlet could be construed by reasonable persons as
misrepresenting the work of the artist, with bringing harm to the
artist's reputation and to the value of his works,'' the judge said.
   Wildmon's attorney, Benjamin W. Bull, objected to the ruling. He
said the pamphlet was protected by the First Amendment's freedom of
speech.
   The judge said the pamphlet could be used if it contained a
clarifying statement.
   Conner said he would rule next month on the monetary and
copyright infringement complaints.
   Wildmon and his group have for years led the conservative
campaigns against films, music, television shows, magazines and art
that they deem obscene.
   ``I consider this to be a vindication of sorts,'' the artist
said after the judge issued Monday's ruling.
   ``I didn't know Mr. Wojnarowicz personally and had no knowledge
of him,'' Wildmon said outside court. ``The whole thing we have
done is try to address the issue of government support of this kind
of art. I had no malice toward Mr. Wojnarowicz.''

   A train derailed in central Italy on
Tuesday near a posh seaside resort, and 30 passengers were reported
injured, police said.
   The train was heading from Alessandria in northern Italy to Rome
when the accident occurred Tuesday afternoon. The train derailed as
it entered the Orbetello station.
   Thirty people were taken to a hospital in Orbetello with minor
injuries, police said.
   Orbetello is 90 miles north of Rome and near the Argentario
peninsula, which is dotted with elegant villas and beaches.
   The train track was closed for several hours following the
accident. Police said they were investigating the cause.

<HEAD>Minorities Mark Milestone in NYC Resident Labor Force</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minorities for the first time make up more than
half the city's resident labor force, a milestone that raises stark
challenges for New York's social and economic future, researchers
said Tuesday.
   ``It's a historic moment in the life of the city: Minorities
have become the majority of New Yorkers in the labor market,'' said
Samuel Ehrenhalt, regional chief of the federal Bureau of Labor
Statistics.
   Ehrenhalt, who reported the trend, said it will increase
pressure on the city to better educate black and Hispanic youths.
Other researchers said it will gradually force employers to open
management jobs to minorities.
   ``It's a signpost on a difficult path of necessary change,''
said John Mollenkopf, a political scientist at the Graduate Center
of City University. ``It points to a future that we all have to
recognize and embrace.''
   The labor bureau reached its conclusion after analyzing its
monthly employment surveys for 1989. It found that non-Hispanic
whites made up 49.7 percent of the resident labor force, under half
for the first time.
   Out-of-town residents who work in the city _ mainly whites _
were not included in the analysis.
   Demographers say the city's population has been less than half
white since the early or mid-1980s; it now is estimated at about 47
percent. But never before has the labor force _ residents ages 16
or older who are working or looking for work _ reached that point.
   Ehrenhalt said the arrival of black, Hispanic and Asian
immigrants is the prime reason for the trend. The white population
is about stable, and the number of native-born blacks and Hispanics
has grown only slowly.
   ``Immigrants are playing a bigger role in New York City than
they have at any time in the past three-quarters of a century,''
Ehrenhalt said. He said the trend will continue as the white
population ages and leaves the workforce.
   ``That underscores the need to encourage a more rapid and
purposeful move of minorities into the educational and occupational
mainstream,'' Ehrenhalt said. ``The city economy will need them as
never before.''
   Lack of a high-school education is higher among minorities than
among white residents, Ehrenhalt noted. And minority unemployment
remains far higher _ 9.6 percent in 1989, compared with 4.1 percent
for whites.
   Education is not the only issue. Mollenkopf said the trend
increases the demands on employers to open fuller job opportunities
to minority workers. Now minorities often hold lower-paying
clerical jobs while senior management is virtually all white, he
said.
   The labor bureau's figures supported the point: While 36 percent
of working whites held managerial, professional and technical jobs,
that fell to 24 percent of blacks and 15 percent of Hispanics. And
Hispanic workers were concentrated in the declining manufacturing
sector, largely in semiskilled and unskilled jobs.
   The city's strength is in service jobs, said Mollenkopf, ``and
the higher echelons of these service firms are still basically all
white. They have to come to grips with the fact that the city's
labor force is multiracial. They put themselves at a disadvantage
if they resist that.''

   The National Organization for Women said
Tuesday the U.S. political process is unresponsive to women,
minorities and young people, and named a panel of prominent
Americans to help improve it.
   ``We have many, many obstacles to overcome,'' said NOW President
Molly Yard. ``There are many groups that agree ... that it's time
to take another look at our democracy.''
   Yard said there were too few women, minority or young
officeholders, and politicians now in power aren't addressing the
concerns of those groups.
   The Commission for Responsive Democracy stems from a resolution
adopted last year at the National NOW Conference. It created a stir
because it was interpreted as a call for a third political party.
   Yard said Tuesday that a third party was only one option to be
considered at six regional hearings by the commission, which
includes two past third-party presidential candidates.
   ``We intend to be open-minded,'' she said. ``Our conclusions
will depend upon what we hear. The whole history of third parties
has clearly been important in the development of American political
life.''
   She said the Republican Party descended from a third party;
George Wallace's third-party presidential bid forced both major
parties to the right; and the National Woman's Party at the
beginning of the century is cited by some as the reason women won
the right to vote.
   Asked about the reaction of the Democratic and Republican
parties to the commission, Yard said she hoped they would testify
and welcome whatever recommendations the panel develops.
   ``Surely no political leader in this country believes we have a
perfect system,'' she said. ``If they do, they're like Rip van
Winkle and haven't waked up from their sleep yet.''
   Yard cited the difficulty of raising money and defeating
incumbents as two major problems for women and minorities. She said
low voter turnout was a sign that people are unhappy with political
leadership on issues ranging form defense and the environment to
social welfare programs and the savings and loan bailout.
   In addition to the third-party option, the NOW commission is
expected to examine proposals such as setting up a shadow cabinet;
eliminating political action committees; public financing of
elections; reforms in the use of television during campaigns; and
mail and same-day registration of voters.
   The commission is scheduled to report its recommendations at
NOW's 1991 convention next summer.
   Among the panel members are: Rose Bird, former chief justice of
the California Supreme Court; former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey
Clark; former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya; former presidential
candidates John Anderson and Barry Commoner; essayist Barbara
Ehrenreich and poet Robin Morgan; and retired Rear Adm. Gene La
Rocque, director of the Center for Defense Information.

<HEAD>Checking Fees Up 28 Percent in Seven Years, Consumer Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Checking fees have jumped 28 percent in seven
years, with the typical holder of a regular account paying $108 a
year, according to a consumer group survey released Tuesday.
   The Consumer Federation of America said fees on regular,
non-interest checking accounts averaged $107.96, while fees on
interest-paying NOW accounts averaged $111.39.
   Compared with a similar survey in 1988, regular checking account
fees are up 6.7 percent, while NOW account fees rose 6.4 percent.
Compared with the group's first survey in 1983, regular fees are 28
percent higher and NOW fees 62.3 percent greater.
   The consumer group collected information in March from 170 banks
and savings institutions in 16 states and the District of Columbia.
Comparisons between 1990 and 1988, however, are based only on the
111 institutions included in both surveys.
   The non-profit group, representing 240 consumer organizations
around the country, is using the survey results in its push for
legislation requiring banks to cash government checks for
non-customers and to provide low-fee accounts to the poor and the
elderly.
   Sen. Henry Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, is trying to attach a provision
requiring check-cashing to housing legislation pending on the
Senate floor. The House and Senate banking committees are
considering truth-in-savings bills that would require financial
institutions to disclose fee and interest rate information in a
uniform manner.
   Bankers are fighting government-imposed low-fee accounts,
arguing that there is more than enough competition among banks to
keep fees reasonable.
   ``Banks are businesses, not public utilities, and their prices
reflect their costs of doing business with a margin for profit,''
the American Bankers Association said in a statement.
   The bankers' group said 59 percent of 856 banks surveyed last
year offered special low-fee accounts for basic checking service.
   Ken McEldowney, executive director of Consumer Action, a San
Francisco group, said banks are competing for wealthier customers
by offering high interest rates on certificates of deposit. To
offset the high rates, banks are raising fees on smaller accounts,
he said.
   ``In a sense, low- and middle-income consumers are a captive
audience,'' McEldowney said.
   According to the survey, a typical NOW account customer needed
an average balance of $1,180 or a minimum balance of $600 to avoid
fees.
   In calculating average fees, the consumer group assumed that the
typical account had an average balance of $400, falling to $200
once a month. It assumed 10 checks, four withdrawals from automatic
teller machines and two deposits a month, as well as two bounced
checks and one returned deposit per year.
   Monthly fees averaged $5.11 for regular checking accounts and
$5.96 for NOW accounts. Per-check fees averaged 27 cents for
regular accounts and 26 cents for NOW accounts. Bounced check fees
averaged $15 and returned deposits $4.85. The average interest paid
on NOW accounts was 4.97 percent.

<TEXT>
   The plight of frogs wounded in a
debris-clogged creek prompted a group of fourth-graders to spring
into action, cleaning the stream and performing first aid on the
amphibians.
   Then they wrote a 36-page report on the incident, earning a
presidential ``Award for Excellence'' certificate and qualifying
for a national competition run by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.
   ``They were very excited. They really felt that they made some
mark,'' said Thomas J. Kennedy, science teacher to the six boys who
wrote ``Let the Frogs Leap Again,'' chronicling their clean up.
   Ten-year-old Daniel Doerpholz, one of the first to get involved,
said he and a friend from Mosier Elementary School had played in
the creek behind their house for some time when they noticed last
fall that the frogs were dying.
   ``They were getting cut up on everything. They were dying from
all the pollution,'' he said Tuesday.
   The boys tried some first aid on frogs cut by rusted pipes and
broken glass and put tags around the rescued frogs to keep track of
them.
   Daniel and his friend, Phillip Bernier, began hauling trash out
of the creek and then learned from Kennedy that they could turn
their after-school hobby into an entry for the EPA competition.
   ``In relation to cleaning up they did that on their Saturdays
and after school. They stayed after school with me sometimes for
two hours and they sat there and we brainstormed,'' Kennedy said.
   The two boys called on four other friends and they came up with
some solutions to the problem of trash in the stream. One solution
was to wrap a plastic grid over a pipe, allowing water to flow
through while trapping trash.
   Some untested ideas detailed in the report included using
hamsters to power a water wheel to stir up the water, lifting trash
to the top, and rigging a pulley system to lift the trash away off
the surface.
   Their efforts were rewarded with the award certificates and
entry into the national competition, the Presidential Youth
Environment Awards, which will be judged later this year, said
Evelyn Sullivan of the EPA's Boston office.
   ``If (projects) are worthwhile, then I encourage them to enter
the national competition (and) that's pretty much what I did,'' she
said.
   Daniel's mother, Sue Doerpholz, said she didn't realize how
serious the children were until she saw the report this spring.
   ``I knew that he and his buddy Phillip would go down there and I
thought they were just goofing off. Then he came home one day with
all this paperwork,'' she said.
   Kennedy said he's proud of his students.
   ``I have three college degrees but the brightest people I've
ever seen in relation to new ideas is 9- and 10-year-olds who
really have some great ideas,'' Kennedy said.

   Iran's fractious leaders turned a relief
operation for victims of a catastrophic earthquake into a political
dispute Tuesday, with Parliament insisting the West cannot buy
forgiveness with humanitarian aid.
   In northwestern provinces, weary rescuers dug through the
remnants of 342 cities, towns and villages demolished in Thursday's
temblor. Another quake measuring 4.9 on the Richter scale shook
southeastern Iran on Tuesday but caused no casualties or damage,
Tehran University's Geophysics Center reported.
   Officials have said 50,000 people were killed, 200,000 were
injured and 500,000 others lost their homes on Thursday, when a
quake measure 7.3 to 7.7 on the Richter scale hit Iran. Many of the
reported 360 aftershocks have hampered rescue operations.
   Interior Minister Abdullah Nouri, who supervised relief
operations, told a news conference that an accurate casualty count
was not yet possible. He said 99 percent of the bodies have been
recovered in round-the-clock operations by local rescuers, backed
by foreign relief teams and sniffer dogs.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said 171 planeloads of
relief supplies had arrived by Tuesday from more than 26 countries,
including some of Iran's bitterest foes.
   Nouri, a middle-ranking cleric in President Hashemi Rafsanjani's
political camp, thanked all those who sent relief teams and aid and
said: ``If new relief teams are willing to come to Iran on
humanitarian grounds, they are welcome.''
   Nouri, like Rafsanjani, is considered a pragmatist who favors
improved ties with the West.
   But in Parliament, hard-line deputies said the aid will not buy
closer relations with the West or nullify positions taken by
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Those stands include the February 1989
death threat to British author Salman Rushdie for offending some
Moslems in his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   One deputy, Ayatollah Saddegh Khalkhali, said quake aid from the
United States, Iraq and Saudi Arabia was appreciated but Iran
``could not forget our martyrs.''
   ``We cannot forgive the killing of 300 people on the Airbus or
the 400 at Mecca,'' the high-ranking cleric said.
   He was referring to the U.S. downing in July 1989 of an Iranian
jetliner that killed all 290 aboard. The Navy said the jetliner was
mistaken for a warplane.
   More than 400 Moslem pilgrims, most of them Iranians, died when
Saudi troops opened fire on a demonstration in Mecca in July 1987.
   House Speaker Hojatoleslam Mahdi Karrubi told Parliament: ``The
dispute between the Islamic Republic and Saudi Arabia is a rooted
and fundamental quarrel between American-style Islam and the
genuine Islam of prophet Mohammed.
   ``There is no compromise in this dispute.''
   His deputy, Hossein Hashemia said: ``We hate having relations
with those countries because what those countries did to our nation
was worse than the earthquake.''
   The Parliament, known for its fierce opposition to ties with the
West, is struggling with Rafsanjani's pragmatists, who advocate
closer ties to help Iran recover from its eight-year war with Iraq.
   Western diplomats said the aid gives Rafsanjani's faction a
means of pushing the opening with the West. If opponents argued too
loudly, they would seem to be opposing the policy of getting as
much aid as possible to the victims, one Western diplomat said.
   In earthquake-devastated Gilan province, provincial police chief
Gholamreza Gohari said the people were satisfied with the aid and
it would improve Iran's links to the West.
   But one customs inspector, examining a pen offered by a visiting
America, growled: ``We don't need a pen. Just give us back our
assets,'' referring to billions held in U.S. banks since the 1979
seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
   Editorials in Iran's leading newspapers this week on the aid
highlighted the split in attitudes.
   Jomhuri Islami, the main publication of the radicals, on Sunday
wrote: ``Our people, even under the rubble, chant `Death to
America' and demand the almighty God to curtail the U.S.
plans...even those hands stretched to help.''
   Another paper noted Sunday that the $1 million or $2 million in
U.S. aid was far lower than the salary paid to actor Sylvestor
Stallone for the movie ``Rambo.''
   But the English-language Kayhan International on Tuesday called
it ``very selfish of a newspaper man to sit in his air-conditioned
office in Tehran with his family intact to ask quake survivors to
say, `Down with America.'''
   Also Tuesday, the Agriculture Ministry announced that it would
take over the harvest of the area's rice and tea crop, threatened
because so many farmers died in the quake.

   The Soviet Union is having trouble paying $2
billion in foreign bills and needs more Western credits to help
make the transition to a market economy, a government spokesman
said Tuesday.
   ``If we have credits, it will be easier for us to have economic
reform,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told
reporters.
   ``We're experiencing come commercial difficulties now,''
Gerasimov said. ``Our perfectly immaculate record on the external
market of always paying our debts is now under question.''
   He quoted the Soviet State Bank president, Viktor Gerashchenko,
as saying the Soviet Union has a current accounts deficit _ the
difference between cash on hand and outstanding bills _ of $2
billion.
   This is due to several factors, including the disruption
involved in the transition from central planning to a market
economy, he said.
   European Community leaders meeting in Dublin this week agreed to
have the community's executive commission undertake a study of
Moscow's needs, but they refused to grant immediate aid to the
Soviets.
   Gerasimov said the Soviet Union needs more Western economic
credits like the $3.1 billion West German bank credit backed by
West Germany at the Dublin meeting.
   The Soviet Union's economic potential should be sufficient
collateral to guarantee repayment of large-scale economic credits,
he said.
   ``It's not aid, it's credit,'' he said. ``This credit must be
returned, must be paid back with interest.''
   ``To pay them back with interest, we must work harder, so it's
just a kind of input to our perestroika,'' he said, referring to
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of economic reform.
   There are no detailed plans to implement large infusions of
foreign credits, Gerasimov said. The lack of such a plan ``is a
little bit of danger,'' but it is premature to worry about it now,
he said.
   According to the Soviet business weekly Commersant, deliveries
from foreign firms worth up to $500 million have gone unpaid since
October 1989. Similar debts have been run up before, but they were
always taken care of by credits from the Foreign Economic Bank, it
said.
   Many foreign companies have been giving their Soviet partners
more time to make good on their debts.
   A Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the Soviet current account debt has been steadily growing as
imports continue to surpass exports. A $2 billion debt is not
surprisingly large to economists familiar with the Soviet economy,
he said.
   The total Soviet foreign debt is thought to be about $3 billion.
Some estimates have run as high as $8 billion.

<TEXT>
   The government put the capital under
curfew Tuesday in an effort to stop looting and anti-government
rioting that doctors said had killed 15 people and injured 149.
   President Kenneth Kaunda cut short a 10-day vacation at his
private lodge at Mfuwe, 375 miles east of Lusaka, and met most of
the day with Defense and Security Minister Alex Shapi and political
colleagues.
   The rioting began Monday one week after the government more than
doubled the price of corn meal, Zambia's staple food. The increase
was recommended by financial agencies and donor nations as part of
a plan to salvage the economy of Zambia, one of Africa's poorest
nations.
   Police opened fire on hundreds of stone-throwing protesters
Monday. Doctors at the main University Teaching Hospital said four
people died Monday and 11 Tuesday after suffering gunshot wounds
and other unspecified injuries.
   University students who led the demonstrations said up to 30
students had been detained. The state-run Zambia Daily Mail
reported that more than 100 people were being held at police
stations in Lusaka.
   Early Tuesday, army helicopters flew low over the Zambia
University campus and key trouble spots nearby.
   Student leaders meeting at the campus said they would continue
to protest. The students jeered police and chanted ``Kaunda must
go!'' ``Castrate Kaunda!'' and ``Long live multiparty!''
   Students said police opened fire to scatter protesters, injuring
at least one person.
   State radio announced the 6 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew late Tuesday
and said anyone who ignored it would be arrested.
   Sporadic gunfire was heard in Lusaka most of the day as police
and troops battled to stop the protests and widespread looting in
the city of more than 800,000.
   The U.S. Embassy was closed and British officials and U.N.
agencies advised their nationals and employees to stay home.
   Three suburban police stations were reportedly attacked and set
afire by rioters who also looted food stores and a post office east
of the city center.
   Store owners in upper-income suburbs said goods worth millions
of dollars were stolen when impoverished workers joined rampaging
protesters.
   Troops sealed off the city center and most suburban shops, and
gas stations were closed. Children who arrived at schools were
immediately sent home.
   But rioters hurled stones at police and civilian vehicles, and
Lusaka residents said gunfire could be heard in several districts
throughout the day.
   In the first official comment on the unrest, hospital
authorities said three civilians, including a 3-year-old girl, died
from gunshot wounds Monday and that 41 people were injured.
   One policeman, identified only as Constable Siwanza, also died
Monday after being stoned by angry mobs during a police search of
homes in the eastern suburb of Kalingalinga, police spokeman Andrew
Kaitisha said.
   He gave no details of other police casualties.
   In Monday's rioting, students burned flags, denounced the corn
meal price increases, from 2.79 per 55-pound bag to $6.56 a bag,
and demanded an end to nearly two decades of one-party rule headed
by Kaunda.
   Earlier this year, Kaunda promised to hold a referendum on the
future of Zambia's one-party system but no date has been set for
the vote.
   Price increases in 1986 also led to violent clashes between
troops and rioters that left 15 people dead.

   The Bush administration today announced
partial plans for protecting the rare northern spotted owl at the
cost of at least 1,000 logging jobs in the Northwest.
   But for the second time in less than a week, officials delayed
issuing a complete blueprint designed to save the bird without
devastating the region's timber industry.
   ``The admininstration is deeply concerned both about endangered
speies and the livelihood of families in the Pacific Northwest who
depend on timber production,'' Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter said.
   Yeutter and Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. appeared at a
news conference to discuss their plans to save the estimated 6,000
owls, which were declared a threatened species under the Endangered
Species Act last week.
   Lujan and Yeutter said the Bureau of Land Management will
implement a plan that will result in the loss of 1,000 jobs due to
reduce timber harvests on BLM lands in Oregon and northern
California.
   But they called for formation of a government committee to come
up with a specific plan to protect the owl on Forest Service land.
   ``Today we have set into motion a process to balance our
responsibility in preserving the owl and forests while protecting
the economic lives of American men and women who live and work in
the region,'' he said.
   An earlier proposal by government scientists would have resulted
in the loss of 7,600 jobs as a result of reductions in BLM harvests
and the loss of another 20,000 jobs by the end of the decade as a
result of reductions in Forest Service harvests.
   Lujan said the BLM proposal will protect 125 more pairs of owls
than would the proposal offered by the government scientists, led
by Forest Service biologist Jack Ward Thomas.
   That panel would have taken about 3 million acres out of
production, some 2.5 million of that from the Forest Service. Lujan
and Yeutter had no acreage estimates today.
   Lujan said annual BLM harvests in the region would drop from 950
million board feet to about 750 million compared with the 500
million envisioned under the recommendations of the scientific
panel.
   The Forest Service will operate under existing forest plans
until the new timber task force can come up with an interim
conservation proposal for the owl.
   Under the earlier recommendations of the government scientists,
harvests in the region would have been cut back to between 2.3
billion and 2.5 billion board feet.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service last Friday announced its decision
to classify the owl as a threatened species entitled to protection
under the Endangered Species Act, the same law that has protected
the grizzly bear and bald eagle.
   Members of Congress expressed fears that environmentalists would
go to court to halt logging if they were dissatisfied with the
administration's recommendations.
   Other lawmakers said Congress ultimately would try to write its
own protection plan, possibly embracing greater environmental
protection and less concern for the timber industry.
   Biologists say each nesting pair of owls needs a large tract of
undisturbed old-growth forest. Estimates of the owl population
range from 3,000 to 5,000 pairs.
   A government scientific panel proposed in April to give the owl
protection throughout its range of Oregon, Washington and northern
California.
   Its recommendations would take more than 3 million acres of
previously unprotected national forests out of production, cut
federal harvests in the Northwest nearly in half and result in the
estimated loss of more than 28,000 jobs by the end of the decade.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Won't Stop Jailing of Reporter Over Sources</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Tuesday refused to
block the jailing of a television reporter who refused to disclose
his sources in a murder story.
   KMOL-TV reporter Brian Karem said he would probably surrender
Wednesday afternoon to begin serving a six-month contempt of court
sentence.
   State District Judge Pat Priest issued the sentence in February
when Karem refused to surrender notes containing the names of
confidential sources. The sources had arranged a jailhouse
telephone interview with two murder defendants for him. Priest also
fined him $500.
   Karem appealed in U.S. District Court, and last week Judge H.F.
Garcia ruled against him and ordered him to give the notes to
defense and prosecution lawyers. Garcia also refused to delay the
jail sentence while Karem appealed.
   An arrest warrant was issued Monday. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals on Tuesday also refused to delay the sentence while an
appeal is pending.
   ``It bothers me very deeply,'' Karem said Tuesday. ``Just the
way the First Amendment has been trampled on ... really bothers
me.''
   The sources named in the notes, Karem said, helped him obtain a
jailhouse interview with Henry David Hernandez, 25, who is accused
with his brother, Julian, of killing San Antonio Police officer
Gary Lee Williams. In the interview, Hernandez said he shot the
officer last March in self-defense.
   Lawyers say they must have the identity of Karem's sources in
order to give the brothers a fair trial. They are scheduled to
stand trial in November.

   Many buildings stand roofless, and some
roofs hang with little beneath.
   The three-story community health center in this
earthquake-stricken city was reduced to a steel frame _ the brick
between the steel crumbled with each jolt. A ceiling fan, still
suspended from a fragment of the former structure, circles crazily
in the open air, driven by the wind. Electricity has been cut off.
   At another home, a single wall fell, revealing an interior and
furniture like a doll house.
   A house with blue-framed windows was rocked back on its
foundations so that its second-floor balcony faces the sky.
   Some homes just have huge cracks on the walls and glass broken
out of windows. Others have huge holes in the walls where bricks
fell out.
   People inside their homes were in the greatest danger of being
buried, but people outside ran the risk of being hurt or killed by
stone from falling buildings or landslides cascading down steep
mountains above some of the towns.
   Earthquakes travel as waves through the soil and rock, and
buildings unable to move with the ground crumble as the tremors
become intense.
   Most of the Iranian buildings destroyed on Thursday were one- or
two-story homes built of brick or unreinforced concrete.
   The nearby town of Manjil is virtually a field of rubble. Bricks
and stones that were houses scattered in all directions.
   In Rudbar, on the banks of the Sefid River, most buildings were
destroyed and those that survived were seriously damaged.
   Step three feet up from the curb that used to be in front of
People's Store, and you will find yourself on its tar roof.

   Life in this mountain city 180 miles northwest of Tehran has
moved onto the street, since houses are no longer safe.
   Large military tents have been set up. Some people sleep in
smaller tents or under plastic sheeting tied to trees or iron
fences. Even some buses parked near the river are being used for
temporary shelter.
   Along with the electricity, water has been cut off. The only
supply of running water is a three-inch pipe bent over a basin next
to a bridge.
   A woman in a black chador washes a white bowl and pan with a bar
of pink soap.
   Most people, exhausted from days of digging for missing
relatives and from the loss of loved ones, sit, stand or wander
aimlessly.
   Some pick through piles of relief clothing and blankets piled in
a storefront.

   At one clinic, a doctor cleans a scalp wound of an old man who

   The Bush administration is willing to send a
second plane load of relief supplies to earthquake victims in Iran
and is waiting to hear what is needed, U.S. officials said Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, a private group of Iranian expatriates plans to fly
to Tehran on Saturday. Among them are doctors, nurses and engineers.
   The first load of U.S. supplies was airlifted from Pisa, Italy,
to Iran last Sunday. The plane, chartered for $66,000 by the Red
Cross under a U.S. grant, carried $225,000 worth of blankets,
tents, water jugs and search-and-rescue equipment.
   The plane picked up the equipment at Leghorn, Italy, one of five
major relief depots maintained by the United States around the
world.
   The U.S. relief operation is being conducted under rules
specified by Iran. While accepting help, it insists the aid be
channeled through the Red Cross or other private relief
organizations.
   While authorities said they would not accept aid form Israel or
South Africa, Kamal Kharrazi, the Iranian ambassador to the United
Nations, said Monday that ``the Iranian people do not have any
problem with the American people.''
   In fact, he said, the U.S. help might create a better atmosphere
for relations between the United States and Iran.
   Iranian authorities have previously referred to the United
States as ``the Great Satan.''
   But the Iranian Foreign Ministry has said the nation welcomed
international help due to the magnitude of the earthquake, in which
at least 50,000 people are said to have died, with 200,000 injured
and a half-million homeless.
   The group of expatriates, known as the Society for Iranian
Professionals, has been in negotiations with Iran to provide the
kind of professional help the country has declined to accept from
foreign governments.
   U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the
doctors, nurses, engineers and other professionals will leave
Washington on Saturday.
   The officials said a second plane load of U.S. supplies would be
dispatched once Iran makes clear through Switzerland and other
intermediaries what kind of assistance it requires.
   ``As soon as we hear from them, we will help,'' an official said.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said
that the United States ``is interested in helping in a very tragic
situation. ... Politics don't enter into it.''
   The United States broke relations with Iran in 1980 after the
seizure of the U.S. Embassy and the taking of American hostages in
November 1979. Six Americans are now being held hostage in Lebanon
by militants believed to be under Iranian influence.

<HEAD>Senate, Administration Agree on Key Elements of Housing Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic and Republican senators reached
agreement with the Bush administration Tuesday on key elements of a
major housing bill that had been stalled in the Senate since last
week, Senate and administration sources said.
   The agreement came in a meeting with Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Jack Kemp and senators, including Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., the principal sponsor of the housing bill.
   The agreement, to be detailed at a news conference Wednesday,
clears the way for the Senate to resume debate on the nearly $18
billion bill, probably on Wednesday.
   The Senate debated the bill for five days last week before it
was shoved aside, with Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell
saying he would await the outcome of negotiations with the
administration before pressing for a vote.
   A key stumbling block to an agreement had been the Bush
administration's proposals for increasing down payment requirements
as part of a package of reforms aimed at halting massive losses
that threaten the Federal Housing Administration program.
   The Bush administration proposed increasing premiums and upfront
cash requirements so that FHA borrowers would have to pay
two-thirds of closing costs at the time of purchase. Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., proposed going further by requiring a 5 percent
down payment on loans over $5,000, adding a premium over the life
of the loan and requiring that all closing costs be paid at the
beginning of the loan without being financed.
   Cranston had proposed another plan that he said would shore up
the FHA program without increasing down payment requirements.
   The agreement included provisions for merging the
administration's plan for helping public housing tenants to
purchase their homes with Senate Democrats' proposal for a $2
billion program to encourage local governments to rehabilitate or
build new low-income housing.
   Senate sources, speaking on the condition they not be
identified, said the compromise bill emphasizes the rehabilitation
of existing housing units. And it would continue to authorize
nearly $4 billion more in federal spending on housing than
President Bush has proposed.

<HEAD>Parliament Votes To Get Hungary Out of the Warsaw Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament voted overwhelmingly Tuesday
to immediately suspend Hungary's activities in the Warsaw Pact and
eventually withdraw from the East bloc military alliance.
   The 232-0 vote _ with four abstentions _ again puts Hungary in
conflict with the Soviet Union, which wants to maintain the
organization as a political union. A similar declaration in 1956
prompted Soviet tanks to invade Hungary and crush a popular
uprising led by former Premier Imre Nagy.
   The Warsaw Pact has admitted that invasion was a mistake, and
Tuesday's Hungarian vote came the same day Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze criticized the Warsaw Pact for failing ``to
keep pace with the times.''
   ``It is high time we understood that neither socialism nor
friendship nor good-neighborly relations nor respect can be
maintained with bayonets, tanks and bloodshed,'' Shevardnadze was
quoted as saying in the Communist Party daily Pravda.
   The Parliament resolution called on the government to begin
negotiations with the Warsaw Pact's six other members to prepare
for the planned withdrawal.
   ``We seek to come to agreement with all member countries on
Hungary ending membership,'' the state MTI news agency quoted the
resolution as saying.
   As a first step, the resolution called on the government to
suspend Hungary's participation in the military organization.
   ``The armed forces should not take part in joint Warsaw Pact
military exercises and Warsaw Pact troops should not hold exercises
in Hungary,'' MTI quoted the resolution as saying.
   Parliament also asked the government to open talks with fellow
member nations to review existing treaties to ``delete all
references which would allow for military intervention or which
would impinge upon Hungary's sovereignty in any way.''
   The decision followed Prime Minister Jozsef Antall's
announcement June 9 that Hungary wants to ``restore full
sovereignty over the Hungarian armed forces'' and ``revamp its
forces into a defensive organization.''
   Neither Antall nor the resolution gave a timetable for Hungary's
planned withdrawal or specified how soon officials would like to
see a complete pullout from the Warsaw Pact.
   Early this month, however, Defense Minister Lajos Fuer was
quoted by MTI as saying Hungary wanted to cancel its Warsaw Pact
membership by late next year.
   Antall told reporters at the Warsaw Pact meeting in Moscow on
June 9 that Hungarian leaders felt ``the military aspect of the
Pact should be dissolved by the end of 1991.''
   In an interview published June 9 in the West Berlin newspaper
Morgenpost, East Germany's defense minister, Rainer Eppelmann,
predicted the breakup of the Warsaw Pact's military structures this
year.
   The other Warsaw Pact members are Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East
Germany, Poland, Romania and the Soviet Union. The alliance,
founded in 1955, has been a counterbalance to the West's North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   In 1956, Soviet forces suppressed a popular uprising led by
Nagy, who had called for a Hungary independent of the Warsaw Pact.
   Nagy and several aides were executed in 1958 following a show
trial. Hungarians remained bitter at the Soviets and Budapest's
Communist leaders.
   Following popular uprisings in Eastern Europe that toppled
ruling Communists, Hungary held free elections in March that
relegated the reform Communists to a minor role.
   The new non-Communist government is led by Antell and President
Arpad Goencz, who was sentenced to life in prison for his role in
the 1956 uprising.
   Warsaw Pact leaders in June admitted the 1956 invasion of
Hungary and a 1968 advance into Czechoslovakia were grave errors.
   In Moscow, Shevardnadze followed the same theme in an article
published in Pravda.
   ``Our organization turned out to be not very perceptive of
changes, failed to keep pace with the times, didn't modernize
itself, didn't perfect its military and political structures,''
Shevardnadze said.

   Police killed a Soviet army sergeant in a
shootout after he kidnapped a family in an attempt to return home,
officials said Tuesday.
   The couple and their two children were freed unharmed but a
police officer with an East German anti-terrorist unit was injured
by flying glass, according to the government news agency ADN.
   The soldier was armed with a submachine gun and more than 800
rounds of ammunition when he fled a Soviet weapons garrison Monday
night in Magdeburg, about 50 miles west of Berlin.
   The soldier took the family hostage later at a campground in
nearby Burg, Magdeburg Police Chief Hans-Joachim Stephan told ADN.
   Police spotted the soldier at the campground but took no
immediate action because of the number of people in the area, he
said.
   The soldier fled in a car with the hostages and was later
stopped by a police roadblock, where he was killed in an exchange
of gunfire, Stephan said.
   The soldier apparently wanted to return to the Soviet Union
because of family problems at home, ADN said.
   The family taken hostage was being treated for shock, it said.
   The Soviet defense ministry, in a report carried by the official
Soviet news agency Tass, confirmed the incident and identified the
soldier as S. Suvorov, ADN said.

   The IRA claimed responsibility Tuesday for a
bombing at fashionable club that is a bastion of the Conservative
Party, and it said no government member will be safe until Britain
pulls out of Northern Ireland.
   The bomb at the Carlton Club, which injured nine people, was the
first directed at the party since the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel in
Brighton during the 1984 Conservative conference. That attack
killed five people and narrowly missed Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher.
   Scotland Yard said it was examining videotapes taken by a
security camera outside the club for clues to the bombers.
   Mrs. Thatcher toured the bombed-out building and visited two of
those injured in Monday night's attack.
   ``It was dreadful, inhuman, depraved'' she said. ``They are
trying to undermine democracy. In Northern Ireland everyone has a
vote, and they voted to stay with the United Kingdom.''
   In a statement issued in Dublin, the Irish Republican Army said
an active service unit ``struck at the heart of Tory rule.''
   The Carlton Club is ``the rest and recreation center for the
British government who legislate for a military occupation of the
North of Ireland,'' the statement said.
   ``Like Brighton in 1984, the IRA has brought the war directly to
those who keep the British army on the streets and in the fields of
Ireland,'' it said. ``While such occupation continues, and the
nationalist people face daily oppression, the policy-makers and
their military arm will not be safe.''
   Police have not said whether any bomb fragments have been found.
A spokeswoman, who by custom was not identified, said the extensive
damage and instability of the 158-year-old building made it
difficult to search for evidence.
   Mrs. Thatcher said she believed the IRA bombed the club to gain
publicity during a summit in Dublin of European Community prime
ministers.
   Home Secretary David Waddington, who is responsible for law and
order, said the bombing and another on June 12 at the former home
of the Conservative treasurer, Lord McAlpine, signaled a change in
IRA tactics.
   ``Whether they strike at military or civilian targets, barracks
or private homes, they are attacking democracy itself and they do
not care who is killed or injured in the process,'' he told the
House of Commons.
   Two of the injured, Charles Henry, 76, a porter at the club, and
Lord Kaberry, 82, a former vice-chairman of the Conservative Party
who is a member of the House of Lords, were hospitalized in stable
condition Tuesday, a Westminster Hospital spokesman said.
   Two uniformed police officers treated for smoke inhalation were
released Tuesday, the spokesman said. The others, including two
American tourists, were treated and released. The Americans were
Jane Kahan, 49, and Jacob Boal-Tefhuva, 61, both of New York.
   Churchill-Coleman said the device was left in a bag or parcel
against a wall near steps inside the club's front door, probably
within an hour of the blast.
   The IRA, which draws its support almost entirely from Roman
Catholics, has stepped up its offensive in Britain and continental
Europe. It wants to unite the predominantly Protestant province
with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist
rule.
   Conservative Party leaders said they were determined the club
would be rebuilt, as it was after being hit by German bombs in
World War II.

<HEAD>Trade Policies Ignore Tobacco Health Threat, Doctors Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dramatic increase in smoking worldwide has been
fostered by U.S. trade policies that ignore the health problems
associated with tobacco, according to a report.
   ``Globally, increasing tobacco use is responsible for almost 2.5
million excessive or premature deaths per year _ almost 5 percent
of all deaths,'' said the report in Wednesday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   U.S. trade policy is perpetuating the problem by trying to
develop overseas _ especially in Asia _ a market that is drying up
at home, said the report by the AMA's Council on Scientific Affairs.
   The report's recommendations included urging the nation's
largest group of physicians to lobby the U.S. government to alter
tobacco trade policies, and imposing foreign-language health
warning labels on cigarette packages for export.
   A bill in Congress and supported by the AMA would require such
labeling.
   The U.S. Cigarette Export Association, which represents
manufacturers responsible for 98 percent of cigarette exports,
contends the United States has no business imposing its
restrictions on other countries.
   Andrew Copenhaver, counsel to the cigarette export association,
said the United States is not resposible for the popularity of
smoking overseas.
   ``There's no evidence that consumption trends (overseas) are
being affected by whether or not the U.S. product is there,''
Copenhaver said.
   The AMA report _ adopted as AMA policy in June 1989 _ said
worldwide tobacco use has increased nearly 75 percent in the past
20 years. In 1988 alone, U.S. cigarette exports to Asia increased
75 percent, the report said.
   ``The tobacco industry, ignoring long-term costs of medical
care, loss of productivity from tobacco-attributable morbidity and
mortality ... continues to promote tobacco as an excellent cash
crop,'' the report said.
   Last month, at a World Conference on Lung Health meeting, former
U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said smoking dropped 5 percent
in the United States last year, while American tobacco exports rose
20 percent.
   ``Export of tobacco products is a moral outrage,'' Koop said.
   Koop said foreign advertising aimed at women and young people,
combined with a lack of warning labels, cause many non-smokers to
take up the habit.
   Dr. Harvey Estes Jr., an AMA council member, said the government
wrongfully views tobacco exports as a trade issue rather than a
health issue.
   ``It seems irrational to advocate that we export a product that
we know is going to cause death and disability to another segment
of the world,'' he said in a telephone interview Monday.
   But U.S. trade officials believe tobacco is a legal commodity
and therefore should not be unfairly restricted, said Timothy
O'Leary, spokesman for the office of the U.S. trade representative.
   ``It's probably ... suitable for any given country in the world
to decide if it wants to permit smoking. But as long as smoking is
legal, then that country ought not to discriminate'' against U.S.
tobacco, he said by telephone Tuesday from Washington.

<HEAD>Report Links German, Dutch Firms to 2nd Poison Gas Plant in Libya</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   BADEN-BADEN, West Germany (AP) _ A West German television report
on Tuesday said Libya is planning to build a second poison gas
plant with the help of three companies _ two in West Germany and
one in the Netherlands.
   West German industrialist Juergen Hippenstiel-Immhausen, who has
admitted furnishing plans and helping build the Rabta chemical
plant south of Tripoli, is on trial in West Germany on charges of
violating export laws and tax evasion.
   On Tuesday, the ARD television network in Baden-Baden said Libya
intended to build a second plant using the plans furnished by
Hippenstiel-Immhausen for the first plant. It cited U.S. and West
German intelligence sources for the information.
   Libya has said the plant at Rabta was for producing
pharmaceuticals. Hippenstiel admitted at his trial last week that
he had helped build the chemical plant, which U.S. authorities say
was capable of producing poison gas.
   The television report said two West German companies, Rose and
Abacus, were suspected of having ties to the project.
   In addition, the report said a company it identified as
KWINT-techniek, based in the Dutch town of Culembourg, was
suspected of involvement with the second plant.
   According to the report, the Stuttgart prosecutor's office is
investigating the allegations against the companies in West Germany.
   Repeated attempts to contact the two West German companies and
the Stuttgart prosecutor's office for comment on the report late
Tuesday were unsuccessful.

   A bomb exploded at a Jerusalem bus stop Tuesday
and two women were slightly injured in the attack, the third in
less than a week, authorities said.
   The explosion, described as small, shattered the glass-enclosed
bus shelter, said city police spokesman Uzi Sandor. He said the
women were taken to the hospital with minor leg injuries.
   Police set up roadblocks and searched the area. Sandori said
about 30 Arab suspects were rounded up.
   The explosion was on the road that leads to Bethlehem, which is
in the occupied West Bank.
   Jerusalem Police Commander Arieh Bibi urged people to watch for
unattended packages and other suspicious objects.
   ``Let me just tell the residents of the capital to be more
aware,'' Bibi said on Israel army radio. ``The more eyes, the
better.''
   On Saturday, a pipe bomb placed in a trash can on a beach
exploded, injuring four people. On Sunday, another pipe bomb went
off near gas tanks in the central Israeli city of Ramle. There were
no injuries or damage.
   Two other bombs were safely dismantled by police this week, one
in Ramle and one in Jerusalem.
   Palestinians and Israelis have predicted an escalation in
violence because of the U.S. decision to suspend dialogue with the
Palestine Liberation Organization. Washington cut off the dialogue
last week because PLO chief Yasser Arafat failed to condemn an
attempted raid by Palestinian guerrillas on Israel.
   Also Tuesday, a 60-year-old Palestinian, Mohammed Abu Saba, was
shot and wounded by masked activists in the West Bank village of
Silat et Harithiya, Israel radio said. The attackers, who accused
the man of collaborating with Israel, fled after he returned fire,
the radio said.
   Some Palestinians assisting Israeli authorities are issued
weapons by the army.
   At least 225 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs as
suspected collaborators with Israel during the 30-month-old revolt
against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   Some 721 Palestinians have died of Israeli gunfire in the
uprising and 45 Israelis have been slain.
   Meanwhile, the army was investigating allegations that soldiers
walked around naked on a rooftop observation post in the occupied
West Bank and angered Arab residents, officials said.
   The rooftop post in the town of Abu Dis was set up early in June
and removed 10 days ago, the military said.
   Residents complained that troops stationed at the lookout walked
around naked, cursed women and children and used drinking water
tanks on the roof to take showers.

   Air force planes and helicopters
firebombed and strafed residential areas near Jaffna Fort, a
strategic military garrison, and hundreds of buildings were ablaze,
Tamil rebels said Tuesday.
   Authorities and witnesses reported the deaths of 196 people
nationwide, bringing the death toll in two weeks of fighting to
1,626 combatants. Many civilians have also been killed.
   In the northern city of Jaffna, the rebel stronghold, the
government used bombers and a helicopter gunship to pound
residential areas around Jaffna Fort, in which 270 soldiers and
policemen have been besieged since the fighting began.
   Five air force bombers and a helicopter gunship used 120-pound
bombs and 66-pound incendiary devices in the attack, said a rebel
statement telexed to newspaper and news agency offices in Colombo.
   It described attacks on Monday and said hundreds of buildings
near Jaffna Fort were set on fire. ``The whole area is ablaze,'' it
said.
   Military officials said Tuesday that air force planes continued
to bomb and strafe rebel positions and were trying to avoid
civilian targets in the city, 186 miles north of Colombo.
   ``We are not hellbent on bombing and killing people,'' Defense
Secretary Gen. Cyril Ranatunge said.
   There was no way to independently verify rebel or government
claims because transportation and telephone services to the region
were cut off.
   But travelers reaching Vavuniya, just south of Jaffna, confirmed
that the Jaffna was being heavily bombed.
   Over the weekend, air force planes dropped leaflets warning the
city's 120,000 residents to evacuate.
   The rebel statement claimed the military was using ``napalm''
bombs but then said the bombs were made of coal tar, rubber
shavings and explosives. There was no indication that napalm, a
powerful defoliant, was used by the military.
   The government considers Jaffna Fort one of its main bases in
the area and it would be a serious military blow if it lost the
area to the rebels.
   The Tamils started a war for separatism in 1983 but there had
been a 13-month halt to hostilities during a cease-fire between the
rebels and the Sinhalese-dominated government.
   The latest fighting broke out on June 11, after a Tamil man
claimed he was manhandled by Sinhalese police. Tamil Tigers then
overran a series of police stations.
   Tamils form 18 percent of the island's 16 million people. They
have long accused the Sinhalese majority of discrimination.

   More than $10 million was stolen by
gunmen Tuesday morning during an armored car robbery, authorities
said.
   Monroe County Sheriff Andrew P. Meloni said the robbery occurred
at about 7:20 a.m. in suburban Henrietta.
   ``It certainly was planned _ no question about that _ and was
obviously rather successful,'' Meloni said.
   The amount stolen was $10.8 million, according to other law
enforcement sources contacted by the Rochester Times-Union. Meloni
said he could not confirm the amount.
   The theft could be the second largest of its kind in U.S.
history.
   The FBI's public affairs office in Washington, D.C., said its
records indicate the largest theft from an armored car in United
States history was $11 million taken in 1982 from a Sentry Armored
Car Courier Co. office in the New York City. In 1983, $7 million
was stolen from a Wells Fargo armored car office in Hartford, Conn.
   Sheriff's department spokesman Tom Ryan said the armored car
robbed Tuesday was owned by Armored Motor Service of America Inc.,
of Chili.
   The car's male driver and a female employee had stopped at a
delicatessen to get coffee and sandwiches, Ryan said. While the
woman went into the deli, the driver was confronted by a gunman who
managed to get into the truck and take control of the vehicle, the
employees told police.
   When the woman returned, the gunman ordered the two to drive to
a more rural location about a half mile away, Ryan said.
   The money was then transferred from the armored truck to another
vehicle, believed to be a gray van, Ryan said. The armored car
company workers were taped-up and had their wrists bound.
   At least one of the gunmen wore a mask.
   After the robbers fled the scene in the second vehicle, the
employees said they took about 15 minutes to free themselves,
authorities said. They returned to the armored car company offices
and notified the sheriff's office of the robbery at 7:38 a.m., Ryan
said.
   ``We're dealing with people who had a well laid-out plan,'' said
Capt. Neil Flood, commander of the sheriff's office Criminal
Investigation Division.
   The two employees were not injured, Ryan said.
   Meloni said investigators were working closely with the FBI and
were interviewing the driver and the assistant. The armored truck
has been checked for fingerprints, he said, and examined for other
clues. Investigators were looking into records and routes of the
armored vehicle and were questioning other people in the area, he
said.
   The money was to be transported to the Federal Reserve Bank in
Buffalo, which serves as a source of coin and currency for banks
throughout western New York. Banks, in turn, send surplus money to
the Federal Reserve for storage.

<HEAD>House Approves New Funds for Prosecuting S&amp;L Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Tuesday approved a $10.5 billion
money bill that would give the Justice Department an additional $75
million to use in prosecuting fraud in the nation's savings and
loan scandal.
   With public outrage growing over the debacle that is expected
eventually to cost over $300 billion, lawmakers are rushing to
provide money to pursue the more than 21,000 fraud cases that have
so far been referred to the Justice Department.
   The additional money, approved in an amendment added to the bill
last week, was part of a measure providing about half the money
needed for the coming fiscal year for the departments of Commerce,
Justice and State, and for the federal judiciary. The measure now
goes to the Senate. The bill was approved on a vote of 368 to 55.
   The rest of the needed funds for those agencies will have to be
added later, after authorizing legislation is enacted by the
appropriate committees and the full Congress.
   Rep. Neal Smith, D-Iowa, who proposed adding $75 million for the
Justice Department's S&amp;L prosecutions, said even more money will be
coming later. The amount was an increase over the $50 million
allocated for prosecutions this year.
   The largest chunk of the bill, $3.2 billion, goes for State
Department operations for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. It
includes $788 million for U.S. dues to the United Nations and other
international bodies, including a start on paying off past-due
amounts withheld in previous years.
   Around $1.7 billion is appropriated for the Commerce Department,
including $438 million for the Census Bureau and $47 million for
research on global warming by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   Most funding for the Justice Department, including U.S.
attorneys, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service and the federal prison
system, was left out of the $1.7 billion Justice section of the
bill.
   The section does include $500 million to be used for reparations
payments to Japanese-Americans interned by the U.S. government
during World War II, and $400 million for anti-drug abuse grants.

<HEAD>German Parliament Presidents Say Israeli Fears Unfounded</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The visiting presidents of the East and West
German parliaments assured Israel Tuesday that concerns here and
elsewhere about German unification are unfounded.
   Rita Suessmuth of West Germany and Sabine Bergmann-Pohl of East
Germany also pledged that a united Germany would be a strong
supporter of the Jewish state.
   The two presidents spoke on the second day of a three-day visit
to Israel. The trip has been seen as an effort to allay concerns
about German unification.
   ``We take the concerns seriously, but they are unfounded,'' Ms.
Bergmann-Pohl said in a speech before Israel's Council on Foreign
Relations, a private group that regularly discusses foreign affairs.
   ``It will be an important task of German foreign policy to deal
with these fears and to take into consideration the legitimate
security concerns'' of its neighbors, she added.
   Ms. Suessmuth rejected predictions that a united Germany would
dominate Europe, saying that instead it would pave the way for
European unity.
   ``Without ending Germany's division, there cannot be a unified
Europe. Without German unity, the policy of confrontation between
the Eastern and Western blocs will not end,'' she said.
   She also took a gentle swipe at those expressing concern.
   ``We are being watched intensively, sometimes too intensively.
If we make mistakes they are weighed more heavily than those of
others,'' said Ms. Suessmuth.
   Many Israelis remain skeptical of German unification, including
Shevach Weiss, a deputy speaker of Parliament who as a child spent
two years hiding from the Nazis in a basement in the Ukraine.
   ``I know we can't change historical processes. But we have the
right and maybe the obligation to be afraid and alarmed by the
enormous power (of a united Germany),'' said Weiss.
   The two German officials toured the Yad Vashem Holocaust
Memorial in Jerusalem, an exhibit that tells the story of the
genocide in which 6 million Jews were slain by the Nazis.
   In Yad Vashem's Hall of Remembrance, a darkened room with an
eternal flame and the names of Nazi death camps inscribed on the
floor, Ms. Bergmann-Pohl and Ms. Suessmuth each laid a wreath with
red and yellow flowers and stood silently for a moment.
   Ms. Bergmann-Pohl, who had remained silent while viewing
pictures of executions, gas chambers and bodies piled in mass
graves, cried when she later addressed her hosts.
   ``I wanted to make a promise here that I will work hard that
such injustice will never happen again, and I will work especially
hard for this in a united Germany,'' she said outside the hilltop
memorial overlooking Jerusalem.

<HEAD>Right-Wing Groups Disappointed After Meeting De Klerk</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Mandela, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Extreme right-wing groups
expressed disappointment Tuesday after meeting President F.W. de
Klerk and accused him of capitulating to the United States, Britain
and local Communists.
   Several pro-apartheid groups met de Klerk in Pretoria and
demanded guarantees that whites would maintain political
sovereignty and that there would never be a Communist government in
South Africa.
   Jaap Marais, leader of the Reconstituted National Party, said de
Klerk refused to make such pledges.
   Marais said the president should stop ``capitulating to the
demands of the U.S.A., United Kingdom and the Communists.''
   Marais and other right-wing leaders consider Nelson Mandela and
his African National Congress a Communist-inspired terrorist group.
   The ANC, the country's largest black opposition movement, is
closely allied with the South African Communist Party, but it says
Communist beliefs do not guide ANC policy.
   De Klerk's government seeks to negotiate with the ANC and other
anti-apartheid groups to establish a new constitution that would
give blacks some share of power in the government.
   ``He (de Klerk) has become entrapped in a web in which only
people of the left have entrance to him,'' Marais said. ``He
realized today that there are people of different views.''
   Right-wing groups believe de Klerk has instituted his reforms to
persuade Western governments to lift economic sanctions against
South Africa. The limited sanctions were imposed in recent years to
protest the apartheid system that allows the white minority to
maintain political and economic control over the country.
   The European Community on Tuesday refused to lessen sanctions
until there is ``further clear evidence'' of political change in
South Africa.
   In Washington, President Bush told Mandela on Monday that the
United States would maintain sanctions for the time being.
   Mandela addressed a joint session of the U.S. Congress on
Tuesday and told the legislators his country ``continues to bleed
and suffocate'' under the repression of white-minority rule.
   Both de Klerk and Mandela have warned that heavily armed
right-wing extremists could undermine efforts to launch black-white
political negotiations.
   One of the groups that met de Klerk, the neo-Nazi Afrikaner
Resistance Movement, has established commando units and threatened
to take up arms if the government lessens white privileges.
   None of the organizations holds seats in the white chamber of
Parliament, but together the groups claim tens of thousands of
followers. Their support comes mostly from working-class and rural
Afrikaners, the country's Dutch-descended settlers who account for
about 3 million of the 5 million whites.
   The right-wing groups seek to carve up South Africa into
separate homelands for whites and the 28 million blacks.
   The pro-apartheid Conservative Party, which was not present at
Tuesday's talks in the capital of Pretoria, captured 31 percent of
the white vote in elections last September.
   Most political analysts believe support for the Conservatives
has increased in response to De Klerk's reforms.
   Right-wingers have been threatening the government for months.
Last week provided the strongest indications yet that such groups
are ready to act.
   Piet Rudolph, a leader of the Boer State Party, declared war on
the government in a videotape sent to a local newspaper. Rudolph
has been in hiding since he allegedly stole arms and ammunition
from air force headquarters in April.
   Also, two offices belonging to de Klerk's National Party were
bombed Friday night, causing damage but no injuries. No one claimed
responsibility, but government officials say they suspect
right-wingers.
   A local newspaper reported Friday that white extremists were
planning to assassinate Mandela and de Klerk. Police arrested 11
whites for questioning, but all were released and no charges have
been filed.

<TEXT>
   After 55 years at the bottom of the sea,
the last U.S. dirigible and two rare Sparrowhawk scout planes were
located in 1,500 feet of chilly water by a tiny Navy submarine.
   The 785-foot-long Macon was returning to Moffett Field, about 45
miles south of San Francisco, when it was damaged in a storm on
Feb. 12, 1935, and settled into the sea. It was carrying a crew of
83 and four Sparrowhawks.
   Lifeboats saved 81 of the crew, but the Macon slid beneath the
surface about 100 miles south of San Francisco and disappeared. It
was spotted on Sunday by the three-man crew of the titanium-hulled
Seacliff, which had been commissioned to find the wreck.
   ``It's a delightful surprise!'' said squadron leader Henry
Miller, now 87, the only Macon crewman still alive.
   ``I'm simply thrilled!,'' Miller said in a telephone interview
from his home in Shawnee Mission, Kan.
   The dirigible, which was about four times as long as the popular
Goodyear blimps, went down after a tail fin snapped in heavy wind
and rain, puncturing three helium cells, according to John Sanders,
a spokesman at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey.
   Recalling the accident, Miller said it was ``obvious the ship
was a goner'' after it began losing altitude. As the deflated tail
section dragged the airship downward, the captain sent several men
to the nose to try to balance the ship.
   When the Macon went into the ocean about 15 miles offshore,
Miller was one of the men on the nose.
   ``It was just like a big old hen settling down on a nest,'' he
said of the ``crash.''
   Sanders said searchers have always looked south of the
lighthouse for the wreckage, but apparently the Macon was dragged
north by the California Undercurrent. A clue discovered in the late
1970s helped solve the puzzle.
   A piece of the Macon was pulled from the water by fisherman Dave
Canepa, and it eventually wound up hanging on the wall of a
restaurant. Chris Grech of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, one of a
small group of people looking for the wreck, heard about the junk
hanging on the dining room wall and traced it back to Canepa.
   Canepa, who says he ``never threw any of my (fishing) records
away,'' told Grech where he found the debris. Grech passed it on to
the Navy.
   The discovery is a ``tremendous find for aviation museums,''
said Sanders. Only one intact Sparrowhawk exists, on display at the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.
   ``They were the most beautiful little planes I ever flew,''
Miller said.
   The Sea Cliff discovered the wreck in just 15 minutes on the
first dive, pilot Lt. Pat Scanlon said. Scanlon said the airship's
frame was collapsed, but the crew could see two Sparrowhawks intact.
   ``It was amazing,'' said observer Lt. j.g. Jerry Peterson. ``My
heart skipped a beat when we saw it.''
   The Macon is settled on a flat sandy bottom, Scanlon said, with
two of the Sparrowhawks visible. The third and fourth planes are
probably buried in the sand, he said.
   The planes only had a range of 100 miles, Sanders said, but the
Macon could stay aloft for days or even weeks. The Sparrowhawks on
the Macon were the only planes in the Navy that didn't have landing
gear. They landed on ``trapezes'' suspended from the dirigible.
   The Macon crash followed the crash of its sibling ships, the
Akron and Shenandoah, both of which were lost in storms. The three
crashes doomed the Navy's plans to expand the lighter-than-air
program.

<HEAD>Sullivan Discusses Food-Labeling Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan on Tuesday disclosed additional details about the
food-labeling rules being drafted, but it's still undecided whether
they will apply uniformly.
   Sullivan declined to discuss the uniformity question during a
speech to a conference on food safety and nutrition, saying ``this
issue is under review within the administration.'' He also declined
to discuss it after his speech.
   Administration sources have said Sullivan's department wants the
federal regulations to supersede state regulations, but that White
House officials don't want to preclude the states from adding
stronger regulations.
   California is the only state that might be directly affected.
   Sullivan said he believed the uniformity question would be
resolved ``very soon.'' He previously said he wanted to get the
proposed regulations out by the end of this month, but he declined
Tuesday to be that specific.
   The proposal, to be issued by the Food and Drug Administration,
would require nutrition labeling on most foods _ including most
fresh produce and seafood.
   Nutrition labels would have to appear on all packaged food. For
unpackaged foods such as fresh fruits, vegetables and seafood,
other methods of displaying the information would be allowed, such
as leaflets or posters where the foods are sold.
   Also, manufacturers would have to show on the label the number
of calories from fat and the amount of saturated fatty acids,
cholesterol and total dietary fiber.
   The regulations would define the terms ``cholesterol free,''
``low cholesterol'' and ``reduced cholesterol'' to eliminate
misleading claims.
   Restaurants, bakeries, cafeterias and some small businesses
would be exempt from the regulations, Sullivan said. Also waived
from the requirements would be bite-size foods and foods that have
no meaningful sources of calories and nutrients, he said.
   Another change would update the reference values, now called the
Recommended Daily Allowance or RDA, used to compare the nutrition
content of foods and evaluate a food's contribution to the diet.
   RDA would be replaced with the term Reference Daily Intakes, or
RDI, and updated values would be proposed for protein and for 12
vitamins and seven minerals that have RDAs.
   Vitamin K, manganese and other nutrients that don't have RDAs
would be added to the list with reference values.
   Reference values also would be established for fat, cholesterol,
sodium and fiber, but manufacturers would not be required to
include that in their nutrition labels, Sullivan said.
   The food industry has lobbied strongly for a labeling policy
that would be standard across the country.
   John Cady, president of the National Food Processors
Association, said that if labeling rules differed from state to
state, consumers would be confused and distribution logistics would
increase food costs substantially.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest wants the states
to be able to bolster any federal food-labeling requirements. But
even with that issue aside, center officials say the department's
proposals ``are inadequate given the severity of the problem.''
   Bruce Silverglade, legal affairs director for the center, said
the organization obtained a draft copy of some portions of the
proposed regulations. Because of several deficiencies in the
proposal, he said, the center is urging passage of congressional
legislation that is tougher.
   Silverglade said Sullivan's proposal was defective because it
would not require manufacturers to disclose how much fat,
cholesterol, sodium and fiber a food contributes to the maximum
daily amounts a person should consume. It also would not require
disclosure of sugar content or set a deadline for final agency
action, he said.
   Current requirements, established 17 years ago, call for
nutrition labeling only when a manufacturer adds vitamins, minerals
or proteins or makes a nutritional claim about the product.
   About 60 percent of packaged foods list nutrients, a majority of
which is labeled voluntarily.

<HEAD>Fundamentalists Issue Death Threat Against American</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem fundamentalists threatened to
kill the American director of the largest private relief group
working with refugees from the war in Afghanistan, officials said
Tuesday.
   The death threat against Thomas Yates, director of the
International Rescue Committee, was made in a letter delivered
Sunday to the World Food Program, said the officials, who insisted
they not be identified by name, nationality or agency.
   The letter, made available to The Associated Press, was written
in English and addressed ``To Whom It May Concern.'' It said
Western aid groups were being watched and that Yates would be
killed to prove the claim. It accurately described the car he
drives, clothes he had worn, and places he often went.
   ``We know your secrets and your locations,'' said the letter,
signed by the shadowy International Jihad Organization.
   The group has been linked with Hezb-i-Islami, or Party of God,
the most anti-West of the seven resistance groups based in
Pakistan. Spokesmen for Hezb-i-Islami said the attacks would be
justified, but they denied involvement.
   As Washington and Moscow move closer to a political settlement
of the Afghan war, diplomatic sources say many Afghans have
launched an anti-West campaign to counter what they consider a U.S.
attempt to sideline the Moslem fundamentalists.
   The officials said Yates and his family had left Peshawar, the
border city that has served as headquarters for the guerrillas who
have been trying for 12 years to overthrow the Soviet-backed
government of Afghanistan.
   The U.S.-based International Rescue Committee opened its
Peshawar operations in 1980. It has sponsored educational,
agricultural and health care programs in border camps, where nearly
4 million Afghans have taken refuge during the war.
   Attacks on private Western relief groups have increased since
late April, and many agencies have threatened to close their
operations unless the government guarantees their safety.
   In a related development, the Australian-based Shelter Now
International said Tuesday it was indefinitely suspending its
operation pending a final decision by the board of directors.
   Shelter Now, which ran programs for Afghan widows and orphans,
has been the target of repeated fundamentalist attacks in both
Pakistan and Afghanistan. The decision to freeze its operation was
prompted by the June 16 attempted murder of its director, American
Thor Armstrong.
   ``Although we may never know the motive behind this attack, we
are convinced this was not just a coincidence but a serious sign of
the escalating danger to both expatriates and Afghans,'' the
release said.
   ``This is not an easy decision but circumstances leave us no
choice,'' it said.
   When the Soviet Union withdrew its soldiers from Afghanistan in
February 1989 after nine years of military involvement, the
guerrilla government-in-exile was touted by its Western backers as
likely to replace the Communist-style government left behind in
Kabul.
   But the guerrillas have failed to achieve a significant military
victory, and the government-in-exile has degenerated into a chaotic
collection of bickering warlords, diplomats and analysts say.

<HEAD>Lawyer: Imelda Committed No Crime</HEAD>

   Imelda Marcos was ``a world-class shopper,'' but
the racketeering case against her is a prosecutor's fantasy based
on rhetoric rather than evidence, her attorney said Tuesday.
   ``There is no crime in being wealthy or in spending money,''
defense lawyer Gerry Spence told the U.S. District Court jury in
closing arguments. He said Mrs. Marcos ``committed no crime except
of loving a man for 35 years, raising his children, taking his
lavish gifts and being his ardent supporter.''
   Spence, a flamboyant attorney from Wyoming, gave a dramatic plea
for acquittal. He raised and lowered his voice, waved his arms and
used his cowboy hat to illustrate a point.
   He said the government had wrongly concluded that the former
Philippines first lady knew stolen money was used for investments
in the United States.
   He compared the theory to a ``big leap ... like Superman would
make'' and said it violated his client's right to a presumption of
innocence.
   ``It's a hole so big you could drive a truck through it,''
Spence said.
   The lawyer also claimed that Philippines President Corazon
Aquino had threatened to cancel the U.S.-Philippine military base
agreement unless the Marcoses were brought to trial.
   ``Corazon Aquino used the American bases on the Philippines as
leverage,'' Spence said. ``No prosecution, no bases.''
   He ridiculed the government's case in a mocking tone and
attacked the lead prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles
LaBella.
   ``His proof is his arguments, his must-have-beens, his
fantasies,'' Spence said. ``Mrs. Marcos was the most open woman in
the world. There isn't any evidence in this case that she ever did
anything.''
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is accused of helping her late husband, former
Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos, embezzle $222 million from
their country's treasury to buy four New York buildings, jewelry
and art works.
   She faces up to 50 years in prison and $1 million in fines if
convicted of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and
obstruction of justice.
   Her co-defendant, Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, is charged
with mail fraud and obstructing justice for allegedly helping the
Marcoses hide their ownership of the properties after a U.S. court
order froze their assets.
   Khashoggi's attorney, James Linn, is to present his closing
arguments on Wednesday. The jury is expected to begin deliberations
on Thursday.
   Spence said the building purchases were arranged by Mrs. Marcos'
husband and constituted a three-way investment by the Philippines
government, Marcos himself and their close friends, Benedicto and
Gliceria Tantoco.
   The Tantocos, who are fugitives in the case, owned the largest
department store in Manila and Benedicto Tantoco was the former
Philippine ambassador to the Vatican.
   Spence said Marcos was not a crook but a politician who wanted
to hide his partial ownership of the buildings.
   ``He didn't want people to know he was investing in the U.S.,''
he said. ``Don't you think he has the same right as the Japanese,
the Dutch and the English?''
   Spence said Marcos did not acquire his wealth by illegal means
but rather through 30 years of investing in Philippine companies.
In his opening statement, the attorney had attributed Marcos'
wealth to a secret horde of gold hidden in the Philippines by a
Japanese general during World War II.
   Spence again and again came back to his argument that none of
the evidence directly linked Mrs. Marcos to the transactions.
   ``One document out of 300,000 has her signature after the date
of the alleged wrongdoing and that is $700,000 from a Swiss account
to her private account to pay for her jewels,'' he said. ``There is
something almost fantastically silly about this case.''
   Spence said the defense called no witnesses because there was
``nothing to rebut.''
   Spence said at another point, ``I'll tell you she was a
world-class shopper, but I'll tell you she was a world-class decent
human being.''

   Nelson Mandela's planned visit here has aggravated
tensions in this racially divided community, as Cuban-Americans
protest his stand on Fidel Castro while blacks rally to his support.
   Black radio talk shows on Tuesday called for demonstrations to
rival the protests called for by Cuban-American radio programs
outside the Miami Beach labor convention Mandela is to address
Thursday.
   Mandela's visit was welcomed until a nationally televised
interview last week when he defended his support for Cuban leader
Fidel Castro, Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser
Arafat and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Mandela said they had
supported the African National Congress in the early years of its
struggle against apartheid in South Africa.
   Miami, with its large Cuban-American population, immediately
withdrew a planned proclamation in Mandela's honor. Five Miami-area
mayors, all Cuban-Americans, criticized Mandela for being
insensitive to human rights in Cuba.
   ``We, Cuban Americans, find it beyond reasonable comprehension
that Mr. Nelson Mandela, a victim of oppression by his own
government, not only fails to condemn the Cuban government for its
human-rights violations, but rather praises virtues of the
tyrannical Castro regime,'' their statement said.
   Mayors Xavier Suarez, of Miami; Julio Martinez of Hialeah, Pedro
Reboredo of West Miami, Jose Rivero of Sweetwater and Gilda
Oliveros of Hialeah Gardens signed the declaration.
   On Tuesday, Mayor Alex Daoud of Miami Beach, where Mandela is to
address the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees convention, also criticized Mandela over his praise for
Gadhafi and Arafat.
   The mayors' statements angered black leaders, and black-oriented
radio stations on Tuesday called for Mandela supporters to turn out
in support of the black South African leader.
   ``We look like a bunch of stupid clowns around this country and
around the world for not knowing who it is that is coming here, and
how he ought to be treated,'' said Johnnie McMillian, head of the
Miami-Dade chapter of the NAACP.
   Callers to Cuban-oriented talk shows were almost unanimous in
condemning Mandela. Callers to black-oriented stations were
particularly angry with Suarez, who enjoyed widespread black voter
support in his two election victories against more militant Cuban
challengers.
   Representatives from the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and other black groups presented Suarez's office with a
protest letter Tuesday afternoon, and called on blacks to rally at
the Miami Beach convention center and in Miami on Thursday to greet
Mandela.
   Local Jewish leaders, while praising the black South African
leader for his struggle against apartheid, have been critical of
his stand toward Gadhafi and Arafat.
   ``We also recognize that we have profound and fundamental
difference with Mr. Mandela,'' said Howard R. Scharlin, president
of the Greater Miami Jewish Federation. ``These differences are
deeply troubling to us.''
   Feuding between blacks and Hispanics in Miami has simmered for
more than a decade, polarizing the city's politics along racial
lines.
   The latest friction grew from the January 1989 shooting of a
black motorcyclist by a Colombian-born Miami police officer,
sparking three days of rioting.
   Officer William Lozano was convicted of manslaughter in the
case, but blacks objected to his widespread support in the Hispanic
community and among Latin police officers, who raised money for his
defense and wore black armbands in his support following the
conviction.

<HEAD>Anti-Smoking Forces See EPA Report As Big Win; Tobacco Industry
Disagree</HEAD>

   Anti-smoking forces view a new Environmental
Protection Agency report as a key victory in their decades-old war
against tobacco use. But tobacco industry sources say the report is
simply flawed and unsupported speculation.
   The EPA report, which is still in draft form and has not
received final agency approval, was released Monday. It contends
that secondhand smoke causes about 3,800 lung cancer deaths
annually among non-smokers. It also says that children of smokers
suffer more respiratory problems than children of non-smokers.
   ``For the first time, the government has come up with a real
body count on the effects of environmental tobacco smoke,'' John
Banzhaf, the executive director of the anti-smoking group Action on
Smoking and Health, said Tuesday. ``It's going to have a major
impact.''
   Nonsense, said Brennan Dawson, vice president of public affairs
for the Tobacco Institute. The EPA report, she said, is filled with
scientific inaccuracies and is but another example of the
anti-smoking bias in some government agencies.
   She said a review of the study by an EPA independent science
board will destroy the conclusions drawn in the draft report.
   A test of the report's effect will come this week when Rep.
Thomas Lukin, D-Ohio, introduces legislation called the ``Equal
Treatment for Cigarettes Act.'' The bill, for the first time, would
require the EPA to treat cigarette smoke as a carcinogen that it
can regulate, just as it now can act against some industrial
chemicals.
   Benjamin Cohen, an aide to Lukin, said the legislation would
remove from the 1976 Toxic Substance Control Act a clause exempting
tobacco products from EPA control.
   ``The Toxic Substance Control Act is the law that permits EPA to
regulate asbestos,'' said Cohen. ``The new legislation would
require the EPA to also regulate cigarette smoke.''
   Banzhaf said the EPA study also will strength the anti-smoking
side in lawsuits across the country, including one that his group
filed against the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
   ``When we can point out that a sister federal agency has
determined that second hand smoke is dangerous, it will strengthen
our litigation against OSHA,'' he said. The suit, an attempt to
force OSHA to regulate smoking in the workplace, will be heard in
federal court in the District of Columbia this fall.
   Phil Wilbur, director of the Smoking Control Advocacy Resource
Center of the Advocacy Institute, a non-profit organization that
assists special-interest groups, said the EPA report ``has put a
number, 3,800, on the lung cancer deaths caused by secondhand
smoke. ... People will realize that the number of deaths from
secondhand smoke rivals the number of deaths from cocaine.''
   Banzhaf said there now are about 150 non-smokers' rights groups
around the country. Many are lobbying city councils and state
governments for such things as limiting cigarette advertising and
enforcing laws to cut off minors' access to tobacco.
   Despite all this, Ms. Dawson said that the tobacco industry is
not in retreat and is still defending strongly what the group
believes is a fundamental right of people to smoke.
   ``We still do pretty well,'' said Ms. Dawson. ``The fact is that
most corporations still allow people to smoke on company premises.
Most legislative and others battles are won by the industry.
   ``You don't hear about the smoking-restriction bills that don't
get passed, or the tobacco taxes that don't pass,'' she said.
   And, she noted, despite decades of increasing opposition to
smoking, ``fifty million adult Americans still smoke.''
   The war, said Ms. Dawson, is not just for the tobacco industry
because ``our customers deserve a battle also'' and representation
against the anti-smoking forces.
   She said with things like limits on advertising and enforced
restrictions on certain behaviors, there are people who support the
industry's efforts to fight government action.
   ``They may be no friends of tobacco, but they don't like this
nannyism and behavior modification coming from their elected
officials,'' said Ms. Dawson.
   In the draft report, the EPA said evidence includes what the
report calls ``detectable association at environmental exposure
levels'' between cancer and exposure among nonsmoking family
members who live with a smoker.
   The report also said that although 30 percent of the adult
population smokes, there are detectable levels of cotinine, a
metabolic product of nicotine, detected in the blood, saliva and
urine of 50 to 75 percent of nonsmokers tested.

   A plutonium-powered satellite that
will be launched from the shuttle Discovery this fall to explore
the sun's poles poses little health risk in the event of an
accident, space officials said Tuesday.
   ``We have looked at the statistics ... and our conclusion is
that we think it's definitely as safe as it can be and we're not
worried about it,'' said astronaut Thomas Akers, who will be part
of Discovery's five-man crew.
   Ulysses' scientific instruments will be powered by one
radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), which converts heat
from decaying plutonium into electricity. Two such generators were
aboard the Galileo spacecraft that was sent on a six-year journey
to Jupiter from the shuttle Atlantis last October.
   Environmentalists had opposed Galileo's power supply. They said
a Challenger-like accident could scatter the deadly plutonium over
Florida. But Willis Meeks, Ulysses project manager for NASA, said
at a news conference the chances of that happening were ``very
small.''
   In the likelihood of the worst possible disaster, in which
plutonium was released into the atmosphere, Meeks said there would
be an additional 300 to 400 cancer deaths over 50 years based on
the world's entire population. But a U.S. Energy Department
engineer at the briefing who refused to identify himself said that
estimate was much too high.
   President Bush is expected to approve Ulysses' launch in early
September. Presidential approval is necessary when RTGs are used.
   The approximately $750 million mission is on schedule for an
Oct. 5 launch, said John Conway, director of payload management and
operations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
There is no evidence of any damage to Discovery's right payload bay
door, which inadvertently was yanked upward earlier this month by
an overhead bridge, he said.
   Ulysses will be the first spacecraft to orbit over the sun's
poles, providing new insight into solar winds and magnetic fields,
said Peter Wenzel, Ulysses project scientist for the European Space
Agency. The European agency is splitting the cost and
responsibility of the mission with NASA.
   Wenzel said it will be like seeing the sun in the third
dimension.
   ``Think of some little green man from Mars who comes, lands near
the equator, looks around, goes back and describes what the Earth
is like. That's not the whole story. You have to look at all
latitudes,'' Wenzel said.
   Discovery has until Oct. 23 to lift off with Ulysses because of
the alignment of Earth, the sun and Jupiter, whose gravitational
field will slingshot the satellite back to the sun. Otherwise, the
flight must be delayed for 13 months, said Willis Meeks, Ulysses
project manager for NASA.
   It will take Ulysses 16 months to reach Jupiter and 2{ more
years to reach the sun's 70-degree south latitude. In mid-1995, the
satellite is expected to be in the same spot on the northern side.
   The 814-pound satellite will not be any closer to the sun during
the five-year mission than it is now on Earth _ a distance of 93
million miles. It will be twice that far, in fact, when it passes
over the solar poles.
   Ulysses is named after the heroic adventurer in Greek mythology.

   Donald Trump never wanted to sell his year-old
airline shuttle and probably won't, the president of the Trump
Shuttle said on Tuesday.
   ``Ultimately, we're going to dominate this marketplace,'' said
Bruce Nobles, who added that shuttle employees and suppliers have
expressed some anxiety over the New York developer's financial
difficulties. But he said the airline is unaffected.
   Trump is $73 million overdue on loan payments, but his bankers
on Tuesday approved a 30-day, $20 million loan and agreed in
principle to a bigger long-term financial bailout which would force
him to sell some of his properties.
   The shuttle, a major Trump asset, has hourly flights linking New
York with Boston and Washington. Trump in April hired Merrill Lynch
Co. to negotiate the possible sale of the shuttle, which he
purchased last June from Eastern Airlines for $365 million.
   Nobles, in a speech to an aviation industry meeting, said he had
spoken with Trump earlier in the day.
   ``He doesn't want to sell the shuttle and has never wanted to
sell the shuttle,'' Nobles said, adding that a sale was unlikely in
view of Pan Am's efforts to sell its competing shuttle operation.
Pan Am put its shuttle up for sale a month ago.
   Nobles said Trump earlier indicated he would sell the airline
only if he were offered ``a lot of money.'' He said there is
continuing interest, but no offer has been made.
   ``It's probably unlikely someone will make an offer we can't
refuse.'' said Nobles, who has worked for both the Pan Am and
Eastern shuttles.
   He announced the airline was extending until Sept. 30 a program
that guarantees service, seats and on-time arrival. Failure to
deliver gives customers a choice of bonus frequent flier miles,
restaurant coupons or a discount on a future flight.
   Asked if criticism of Trump and jokes about his business and
marital difficulties affect the airline, Nobles said, ``I don't
know of any hard feelings. I guess a lot of people are having fun
bashing Donald.''
   He said the shuttle is running 50 to 55 percent of capacity and
has to add ``several hundred'' extra flights a month because
peak-hour flights are filled up.
   The airline has been losing money and will continue to do so
into its second year because of the need to pay off loans, Nobles
said. But he said it has been earning profits over its operating
costs for some time.
   He spoke candidly of some of the airline's failures _ a
concierge service which he said cost too much to make it worthwhile
and a helicopter service into Manhattan. He said it needs to find
ways to attract more passengers on weekends when fares already are
lower and has had to cut back to a flight every two hours on
Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning.
   Nobles said the shuttle's high fare _ $119 one way on weekdays
between New York and Washington _ is justified by the fact that
passengers can walk on any hour without reservations.
   He said a decline of shuttle passengers from 4 million in 1988
to an expected 3.7 million this year is due to general economic
decline in the Northeast and increasing competition from carriers
using other airports in the New York and Washington area and from
Amtrak.
   Nobles blamed air traffic control limitations over the busy
airports it serves for any delays. ``We would be 100 percent on
time if air traffic control could handle the demand,'' he said.

   Temperatures rocketed over 110 degrees in parts of the Southwest
on Tuesday while Miami cooled to an unseasonable 71 degrees. A band
of thunderstorms stretched across a midsection of the nation from
Kansas to Michigan.
   The 71 degree reading in Miami tied the low temperature record
for the date set in 1950. The low temperature for the nation
Tuesday was 28 degrees at Truckee, Calif., in the Sierra Nevadas.
   In Phoenix, the low temperature for Tuesday was a sweltering 91
degrees. By early afternoon, it surpassed Monday's record-breaking
120 degrees by one degree. The previous all-time record was 118.
   Searing heat also baked the deserts of San Diego County, Calif.
   Midland-Odessa, Texas, warmed to 104 degrees by early afternoon,
breaking by one degree the community's high temperature record for
the date.
   Thunderstorms early Tuesday brought wind gusts of 60 mph to
Milford Lake, Kan., and damaged large tree limbs at Topeka, Kan.
Wind gusts reach 60 mph at Kansas City, Mo.
   The storms reached southeast Kansas, northeast Oklahoma, north
and central Arkansas and southwest Missouri. Showers and
thunderstorms were scattered over the northeast Colorado, from
central and northeast Illinois across northwest Indiana into
southwest Michigan.
   Rainshowers and thunderstorms extended over much of the Florida
peninsula, southern Georgia, North Carolina and the central Texas
Gulf Coast.
   Heavier rainfall in the six-hour period ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included almost an inch at Fayetteville, Ark., and half an inch at
Springfield, Mo., and Harrison, Ark.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 54
degrees at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., to 118 degrees at Yuma, Ariz.

   Reformers are trying to postpone a major Communist
Party Congress scheduled to open next week that is expected to be a
showdown between party liberals and hard-liners, Boris Yeltsin said
Tuesday.
   A delay could prevent Communist Party hard-liners from
capitalizing on their successes last week at a meeting of 2,700
party members from the Russian Federation, the largest and most
populous of the 15 Soviet republics.
   Yeltsin, newly elected president of the Russian Federation, and
other reformers favor a delay as a means of preserving their
influence.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's stand on the delay was
not immediately known, and one Western expert said postponement was
unlikely.
   The 28th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, to be attended
by 4,700 delegates from around the country, was originally planned
for next year but its opening date was moved up to July 2 to boost
Gorbachev's reform efforts.
   Now, however, the congress seems likely to result in a walkout
by radical reformers that could further polarize the political
situation.
   The final decision on whether to delay the congress will be made
at a plenary meeting of the party's policy-making Central
Committee, expected within days, Yeltsin told a news conference.
   ``There will be a real struggle at the plenum,'' Yeltsin said.
   Some top party members want to hold the congress while memory of
last week's meeting of Russian communists is still fresh, he said.
   ``Others, in order to somehow stabilize the political situation
that has emerged now, are for delaying (the congress) for a time,
perhaps until fall,'' Yeltsin said. ``I am personally for delaying
it, to prepare more thoroughly.''
   Yeltsin said last week's meeting of Russian delegates ``will
have a very serious influence on the 28th Congress, and this is
alarming.''
   That meeting was dominated by traditional Soviet communists who
accused Gorbachev of weakening the party with his reforms. It
elected conservative Ivan Polozkov first secretary of a newly
reconstituted Communist Party of the Russian Federation. Those same
delegates from the Russian federation would form a majority at the
national party congress.
   Gorbachev's most visible conservative rival on the party's
ruling Politburo, Yegor K. Ligachev, told the Russian gathering
last week that it was impossible for the Soviet leader to
effectively run the party while he also holds the job of Soviet
president.
   In another sign of the struggle, the lead article in the
government newspaper Izvestia expressed doubt about holding any
large-scale gatherings such as the congress now.
   Izvestia writer Albert Plutnik said such meetings ``objectively,
in the current situation, do not benefit the supporters of
perestroika,'' Gorbachev's reform program.
   Gorbachev spokesman Arkady A. Maslennikov declined to comment
about Gorbachev's position and said the Central Committee would
decide when the congress would be held.
   A Western diplomat in Moscow, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he doubted the congresss would be postponed.
   Party congresses, normally held every five years, theoretically
are the most powerful party gatherings, with the right to elect the
Central Committee and party leadership, and change the party's
rules and program. In the past, however, the meetings have been
carefully orchestrated from the top.
   Gorbachev is bringing a new program and new party rules to this
congress.
   Yeltsin, elected last month president of the Russian republic,
which has 52 percent of the Soviet population and three-quarters of
its territory, is a leader of the party's reform wing.
   Gorbachev, whose position as Soviet president would not be
affected by a challenge to his party leadership, has made clear he
intends to be a candidate for the top party job at the congress and
has pledged to keep the party from splitting.
   But the main reform group within the party, Democratic Platform,
has instructed its delegates to walk out of the congress if the
party is not completely transformed. A majority of delegates to a
Democratic Platform conference June 17 in Moscow called for forming
a new political party if the Communist Party does not reform.
   Yeltsin, who was active in Democratic Platform before being
elected Russian president, said the congress was the ``last chance
for radical renewal of the party,'' and indicated he would suspend
his party membership if he is dissatisfied with the results.
   ``If there is no such renewal ... then Yeltsin as chairman of
the Supreme Soviet (of Russia) either holds up his Communist Party
membership or maybe takes other steps,'' Yeltsin said.
   According to some reports, Politburo member Vadim Medvedev had
contacted party officials in the Baltic republic of Estonia to poll
them about delaying the congress.

<HEAD>Disputed Van Gogh Work Withdrawn from Auction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sotheby's auction house pulled a painting
attributed to Vincent van Gogh out of a sale Tuesday after the
Amsterdam museum devoted to the artist warned it could be a fake.
   The small picture of a house with a red roof between trees and
two figures on a path, titled ``The Steps at Auvers'' (``L'Escalier
a Auvers''), had been estimated at $3.5 to $5.2 million in the
Tuesday night sale of impressionist and modern art.
   The unidentified seller bought it in 1984 at Sotheby's for
430,000 pounds, then worth about $602,000. If it is proved to be a
fake, its value would be no more than 5,000 pounds, or about
$8,500, as a curiosity.
   As the five-year period needed for a claim has expired, the
seller has no right to seek compensation from the auction house but
a Sotheby's statement said: ``We do consider our moral
obligations.''
   There is a larger version of the disputed picture in the St.
Louis Art Museum.
   The withdrawn work had been sold in Copenhagen in 1925 as a
genuine work of the artist and scholars dated it to July 1890,
shortly before van Gogh shot himself. It was exhibited as his work
in Tokyo in 1985.
   But experts at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam recently cast
doubt on its authenticity.
   As a result, Sotheby's said, they were withdrawing it from sale
pending further research.
   This year is the centenary of van Gogh's death and all his work
is being subjected to close scrutiny. Fakes of his art first
appeared in Paris soon after the turn of the century.
   Van Gogh never sold a picture in his lifetime but he has become
the most popular artist ever known.
   In 1987, his paintings of sunflowers and irises set world art
auction records and on May 15, his portrait of a doctor who had
treated him for mental illness received a new record price of $82.5
million in New York.
   The buyer was a Japanese industrialist Ryoei Saito.
   When the two-day Sotheby's sale of impressionist and modern art
started Tuesday, Seibu, the Japanese store chain, paid $3.14
million for a set of 42 colored lithographs by Marc Chagall. The
company said the price was an auction record for a set of prints.
   The works illustrated the pastoral romance of a goatherd and a
shepherdess, ``Daphnis and Chloe,'' attributed to the third century
Greek writer, Longus.
   The set of 42 lithographs was published in Paris in 1961.

<HEAD>Additional $11 Million Reallocated for WIC Food Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An additional $11 million has been reallocated
to 46 states for a special supplemental food program for women,
infants and children, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   About half the states have been running out of money for WIC, as
the program is called. Higher food costs, especially for dairy and
citrus products, were said to be the main factors.
   Officials said the department regularly reallocates unspent and
carryover WIC funds to states in need.
   ``Many states have managed their WIC caseloads carefully enough
that they aren't having any budgetary problems,'' said Betty Jo
Nelsen, administrator of the department's Food and Nutrition
Service.
   ``Others have had to economize ... by choosing less expensive
but nutritious foods,'' she said.
   Nationwide, the reallocated money will allow states to provide
an additional 300,000 food packages to participants over the final
three months of this fiscal year, Nelsen said.
   The funds will be available to states July 1 and will supplement
more than $2 billion allocated for WIC in the current fiscal year
that began Oct. 1. More than 4.5 million women, infants and
children participate.

<HEAD>City Council Scales Back Generous Homeless Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CASSANDRA BURRELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City council members voted Tuesday to end one
of the nation's most generous municipal policies for the homeless
in an effort to control a budget crisis that could leave the
District of Columbia with a $95 million budget deficit.
   The council voted to stop immediately providing unlimited
shelter to the homeless. The legislation now goes to Mayor Marion
Barry for his approval.
   The vote scaled back an initiative that had passed with more
than 70 percent of the vote in 1984. It guaranteed overnight
shelter for any homeless person who requested it.
   The new policy authorizes the city to restrict annual spending
for shelter, limit the number of nights individuals and families
can stay at the shelters and require people with money to help
defray the cost of finding permanent housing for themselves.
   The city was expected to spend $40 million on the homeless this
year, or about $15 million more than originally budgeted. The cost
of implementing the law has nearly tripled, from $10 million in
fiscal 1985 to $27 million in fiscal 1988.
   Tuesday's decision angered homeless advocates, who said they
planned to file suit against the city.
   ``I think whoever voted for this thing should be run out of
town,'' advocate Mitch Snyder said. ``This is going to put
thousands of people out on the streets.''
   If shelter money is exhausted before the end of the budget year,
the mayor could transfer money from other city accounts, but he
would not be required to do so.
   The Barry administration is facing a budget deficit of about $95
million for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. The mayor has proposed
that 26,000 city workers be furloughed for four days each, that
services be cut and that new taxes be enacted.

<HEAD>Scientists Testify That Weedkillers May be More Harmful Than
Thought</HEAD>

   Farmers and homeowners frequently use
weedkillers that contain a key ingredient of Agent Orange that may
be more harmful than previously thought, scientists told a
congressional panel Tuesday.
   ``It appears to me that there are other contaminants in
herbicides, as well as herbicides per se, which have not been
adequately evaluated for carcinogenicity in animals let alone
studied for their effect ... in humans,'' Daniel Thau Teitelbaum, a
Denver physician, told a House Government Operations subcommittee.
   Teitelbaum studied industry records as part of the class-action
lawsuit by Vietnam veterans against the makers of Agent Orange.
   In the 20 years of controversy surrounding whether the
government should pay benefits to ailing Vietnam veterans who were
exposed to Agent Orange, attention has focused on dioxin
contamination 2,4,5-T _ one of the herbicide's two key ingredients.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has labeled dioxin a
``probable human carcinogen'' and 2,4,5-T has been out of
circulation for years.
   But scientists told the subcommittee that the other key
ingredient _ 2,4-D _ causes cancers and other ailments linked to
Agent Orange. Evidence shows that 2,4-D was also contaminated with
harmful compounds, some related to dioxin, according to testimony
on the government handling of Agent Orange research.
   The farm-chemical industry says ongoing research into 2,4-D is
needed but that the ``weight of the evidence'' so far indicates the
risk of harm is relatively small if it does indeed exist, industry
spokesman Garry Hamlin said in a telephone interview from
Indianapolis.
   A so-called phenoxy herbicide, 2,4-D is sold over the counter to
kill dandelions and other lawn weeds. Farmers use it against weeds
in corn, wheat, rice and sorghum.
   Teitelbaum, noting that use of 2,4,5-T was first discontinued
because of concern about birth defects, said studies were needed on
possible birth defects resulting from 2,4-D exposure.
   Two National Cancer Institute studies have shown an increased
risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a rare cancer, in ``frequent users
of agriculture chemicals,'' said NCI researcher Shelia Hoar Zahm.
   The studies of farm workers in Kansas and Nebraska found that
the risk grows or drops according to skin exposure and how soon
after exposure the worker changed clothes.
   Vietnam veterans were exposed to Agent Orange in concentrations
far in excess of the normal strength, special adviser Elmo R.
Zumwalt Jr. has told the Veterans Affairs Department.
   The department said this year it would compensate veterans for
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and for another rare cancer _ soft tissue
sarcoma. However, the government maintains that exposure can't be
documented.
   Zumwalt, a retired admiral, ordered Agent Orange sprayed in
Vietnam to clear dense jungle. His son, who served in Vietnam,
later died of cancer, which Zumwalt attributes to Agent Orange. he
said 27 ailments can be linked to Agent Orange.
   Zumwalt, appearing before the subcommittee on human resources
and intergovernmental relations, reiterated his contention that
government and industry officials ``intentionally manipulated or
withheld compelling information on the adverse health effects
associated with exposure to the toxic contaminants contained in
Agent Orange.''
   In a related matter, Rep. Ted R. Weiss, D-N.Y., said his
subcommittee had forced the Air Force to release a 4-year-old draft
report showing an increase of birth defects among the offspring of
those who handled and sprayed Agent Orange from the air.
   Patti Turner, a spokeswoman for the Air Force Surgeon General's
office, said the conclusions were premature.

   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, awash in budget woes, had
a rueful response to President Bush's concession Tuesday that tax
increases were needed to shrink the federal budget.
   ``I told the truth and I paid the price,'' said Dukakis. ``Mr.
Bush did not and we're all now going to have to pay the price for
that.''
   Bush, who made ``read my lips _ no new taxes'' a hallmark of his
1988 campaign against Dukakis, released a statement Tuesday that a
``tax revenue increase'' was necessary to battle the budget deficit.
   Dukakis, who said during the campaign he would raise taxes as a
last resort, has been fighting to raise taxes to bridge a state
budget gap now estimated at more than $1 billion.
   ``This is going to be a long and difficult process for the
president and the Congress and they're going to have to go through
what, whether we like it or not, we've had to go through in the
past year and a half,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis' political popularity in his own state has plunged since
the presidential campaign.
   Massachusetts revenues have decline steadily, and the state's
bond rating has fallen to the lowest in the nation, due largely to
political paralysis over the issue of raising taxes.
   Standard &amp; Poors last week put the state on credit watch,
warning that its bond rating could fall to junk bond status if
fiscal problems are not quickly resolved.
   Although the fiscal year ends in four days, the Massachusetts
House and Senate have so fair failed to agree on either a tax plan
or a budget for fiscal 1991.

<HEAD>Sugar Producers Get Preview Of Opposition To Import Restrictions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sugar producers got a taste on Tuesday of the
debate that can be expected on the House floor when urban lawmakers
attack what they see as an overly protective U.S. sugar policy in
the 1990 farm bill.
   ``You have gotten away with murder, and I don't blame you for
wanting to continue it,'' Rep. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., told a
gathering of the American Sugar Alliance.
   He and Rep. Willis Gradison, R-Ohio, want a 10 percent reduction
in the government guaranteed sugar price. They say beet and cane
farmers should prepare themselves for changes in world trade that
will eventually lead to even greater adjustments in the program.
   The sugar program is bitterly opposed by manufacturers of candy,
baked goods, soft drinks and other sweets because it prevents
cheaper world-priced sugar from being sold in the United States.
   In defense of government sugar support, House Agriculture sugar
subcommittee chairman Jerry Huckaby, D-La., said it keeps prices
stable and predictable for sweets manufacturers. It is necessary to
compete with more heavily subsidized sugar from Europe, he said.
   The world market is a ``dump market,'' said Arlan Stangeland,
R-Minn. ranking minority member on Huckaby's subcommittee.
   Stangeland said sugar producing countries take what they need
for themselves, sell to preferred customers at the highest rates
possible and dump the rest on the world market at low prices, often
subsidized by their governments.
   Downey and Gradison also attacked the program as bad foreign
policy.
   It holds domestic prices at 22 cents a pound, about 9 cents more
than the average world price, by controlling the amount of sugar
that can be imported from sugar producing nations. Many of the
countries are desperately poor but have excellent sugar-growing
capacity.
   ``It doesn't make any sense to not allow sugar imports from
countries we are paying foreign aid,'' said Downey.
   He said the United States should allow those countries ``to get
out from us infusing them and allow them to do something
productive.''
   Gradison said the government's import quota program squeezes the
economies of Caribbean nations, who have a better climate for sugar
production than the United States.
   Downey and Gradison said the Bush administration has shown
support for their position.
   Huckaby said he feared the administration saw the sugar program
as something that could be traded away in exchange for concessions
from other countries during international trade talks aimed at
reducing subsidies worldwide.
   He and the other three congressmen all said it was too early to
predict the outcome of the international talks, though Huckaby said
``I would be amazed if any significant agreement was reached in
agriculture.''
   The House and Senate are each expected to begin floor debate on
the 1990 farm bill next month.
   Huckaby said the House and Senate sugar proposals are similar
except the House would require the government to allow no less than
1.25 million tons of imported sugar in the country each year, and
permit another half million tons in imports through a re-export
program involving U.S. refiners.
   Downey and Gradison said they'll make the case on the House
floor that sugar, or any agricultural product, should not be
treated so differently as other goods U.S. makers sell abroad.

   Mayor Marion Barry told a grand jury he had
neither given nor gotten drugs from a man who later pleaded guilty
to drug dealing, according to tapes played Tuesday at Barry's
cocaine and perjury trial. He said he saw nothing ``unusual or
criminal'' in visits to the man's hotel room.
   Charles Lewis testified at the trial last week that he and the
mayor smoked crack cocaine on each of four Barry visits to Lewis'
hotel room.
   The January 1989 grand jury tapes include new material as well
as previously released statements _ Barry's responses to questions
about whether he knew Lewis was involved with drugs, and his
denials that he ever gave Lewis drugs or that Lewis gave him drugs
_ that form the basis for the three felony perjury charges the
mayor faces.
   For example, the tapes indicate that on Dec. 22, 1988, the day
Barry's links to Lewis were becoming public, the mayor visited
three people who law enforcement officials have said could
eventually be called to testify about his alleged drug use.
   Barry testified before the grand jury in two appearances a few
weeks after a police operation aimed at Lewis was called off when
city officers learned Barry was with him at a downtown hotel.
   Since that episode, Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin asked
Barry during the grand jury proceeding, ``have you talked with
anyone or has anyone come to your attention who you believe has
information about Charles Lewis' connection with narcotics or drugs
of any kind?''
   ``No ... I had gotten the feeling, again, just an impression
from having known him over the years, having seen him in the Virgin
Islands, that one, Chuck Lewis was not a drug dealer and two, I
didn't get the impression that he used drugs,'' Barry said.
   When asked by Retchin whether he had ever given Lewis ``anything
of value,'' Barry responded, ``No. If you're getting at _ I've
never given Mr. Lewis any cocaine or any other drugs. Announce that
right up front.''
   In addition to the perjury felony charges, Barry, 54, also has
been charged with 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine possession and
one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy count. He has pleaded innocent
to all 14 charges.
   His taped testimony differed from Lewis' version on minor as
well as major points. For example, Barry said his Dec. 19, 1988,
visit with Lewis lasted an hour or less. Lewis testified that he
and the mayor smoked crack cocaine well into Dec. 20 and long past
the end of the Monday night football game they had been watching.
   Also, Barry told the grand jury he thought his first visit to
Lewis' hotel room in Washington took place on Dec. 17, while Lewis
testified it was a day earlier.
   ``Was there anything unusual about the (Dec. 17) visit?''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Retchin asked Barry during his grand jury
testimony.
   ``Not that was unusual or criminal,'' replied the mayor.
   In a Jan. 24 1989, grand jury session, Barry also described how
he attempted to handle revelations that he had paid repeated visits
to Lewis' hotel room. The mayor detailed a telephone conversation
with top police officials, and said he met a man _ now considered a
possible witness against him _ who noted the mayor's anxiety about
the situation.
   Barry told the grand jury he first learned of the developing
revelations from one of his security guards while he was visiting
the hotel room of Willie Davis, a former aide to Birmingham, Ala.,
Mayor Richard Arrington.
   Barry also said he had spent 45 minutes alone that day in the
Washington hotel room of Doris Crenshaw. He testified he visited
the hotel room of Davis before traveling to an official function
and then to the Georgetown restaurant of Hassan Mohammadi.
   Mohammadi ``recognized I was very upset about this whole thing
that had gone on that night,'' Barry said on the tape.
   Davis, Crenshaw and Mohammadi are considered potential witnesses
at the trial, according to law enforcement sources who have
commented only on condition they not be named.
   Barry also testified that on that same day he visited church
organist Mary Moore. She is the mother of Rasheeda Moore, who later
cooperated in the FBI sting that led to his arrest at a Washington
hotel.
   In his grand jury testimony, Barry said he chatted for about 30
minutes with the elder Moore, then had his security guard drive her
to a prayer meeting at her church while he talked with her son and
waited for the car to return.
   The grand jury tapes also reveal that it was Barry who first
brought up the subject of drugs while answering questions about his
relationship with Lewis, a former city employee.
   Barry told the grand jury that Lewis mentioned the term
``working 50'' in casual conversation and that the mayor thought
the words had something to do with ``hot clothes ... prostitution
or drugs.''
   ``It just popped out'' of Lewis' mouth, ``I didn't pursue it,''
the mayor told the grand jury.
   Lewis testified last week that a ``working 50'' is a bundle of
crack cocaine that retails on the streets of Washington for $50.

   Wind erosion in the Great Plains dropped
sharply this season because of improved moisture conditions in much
of the region, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation
Service, said an estimated 7.8 million acres were damaged by wind
in the 10 states that make up the Great Plains, down 45 percent
from 14.3 million acres in 1988-89.
   The agency measures wind damage during a seven-month season that
runs from November 1 through May 31, when winds are usually the
strongest and soils the driest. The survey covers 541 counties in
the 10 states.
   ``Most of this decrease is the result of precipitation in
Colorado and Kansas, where land damaged from wind decreased from
6.5 million acres last year to 463,000 acres this year for the two
states,'' Scaling said.
   The greatest damage was in North Dakota, in its third year of
severe drought, he said. The state reported 2.9 million acres
damaged this season, compared with 2.3 million last year and a
record 3.5 million acres in 1987-88.
   North Dakota accounted for more than one-third of the total wind
erosion in the 10-state region.
   Kansas, after setting a record with 5.1 million acres damaged
last year (largely due to a one-day storm that damaged nearly 4.8
million acres), reported only 190,000 damaged this season.
   The least damage was in Nebraska, with 130,000 acres damaged,
compared with 192,000 last year.
   Officials said the record for land damaged by wind in the Great
Plains was 15.3 million acres in 1954-55, the year that the agency
began annual records.
   According to the survey, the state-by-state breakdown comparing
wind-damaged acres in 1989-90 with damage in 1988-89, included:
   _Colorado, 273,731 and 1,403,655.
   _Kansas, 189,600 and 5,126,250.
   _Montana, 1,249,665 and 1,832,025.
   _Nebraska, 130,115 and 191,605.
   _New Mexico, 248,500 and 117,950.
   _North Dakota, 2,932,687 and 2,297,681.
   _Oklahoma, 136,800 and 111,930.
   _South Dakota, 601,830 and 678,550.

   The farm where Lawrence Welk learned to
play the accordion became center stage Tuesday for a project to
create a museum honoring the king of champagne music.
   About 100 people gathered to hear bands play German polkas,
waltzes and marches, and Gov. George Sinner planted a tree during a
groundbreaking ceremony at the farm where Welk lived until he was
21.
   Sinner said Welk symbolizes the talent of the descendants of the
Germans who came to North Dakota 100 years ago.
   ``They are people who work hard and play hard,'' Sinner said.
``They are people who believe that artistic ability is at its best
when it is for the common people.''
   The bandleader himself, now 87 and living in Los Angeles, did
not attend but sent a letter of thanks.
   ``Little did I dream when I was growing up on the farm so many,
many years ago that someday it would be restored and people would
come and marvel at how life was lived in the early 1920s,'' Welk
wrote.
   ``Looking back, I would say that life on the farm was very hard
and I didn't always like it _ especially when I had to help butcher
the hogs. But they were really happy days, too, because there was
always love.''
   The farm has been vacant since 1966. But folks in this town of
600 _ about 75 miles south of Bismarck _ decided to refurbish the
farm to chronicle Welk's achievements and the history of his
German-Russian ancestors.
   Carpenters have finished rebuilding a granary and a buggy house,
a summer kitchen and the outhouse on the farm where Welk's parents
came from Russia in 1893. Renovation work is under way on the 25-by
28-foot sod house built by Welk's father at the turn of the century.
   And a barn that was not part of the original farm is being
turned into a museum of German-Russian immigration.
   The cost of the project is estimated at $750,000, including
$500,000 for a trust to maintain the museum after it opens. Welk
Heritage Inc., which is coordinating the restoration, has raised
$150,000, including $80,000 from Welk's foundation in California.
It hopes to collect the rest from grants and donations.
   Sharon Eiseman, a spokeswoman for Welk Heritage, said plenty of
visitors are expected. Strasburg bills itself as the gateway to
South Dakota's Black Hills.
   ``During the summer we have 1,000 to 1,100 cars a day going
through here, down to South Dakota and back up to Canada,'' Eiseman
said.
   One recent visitor was the Rev. John Nieuwsma of Holland, Mich.,
who stopped at the farm with his sisters to reminisce about growing
up in the area.
   ``Lawrence is older than we are but we used to go to town on
Saturday night and peek through the windows of the Blue Room and
see him playing with the Hotsy Totsy Boys,'' Nieuwsma recalled.
   ``Back there in the haymow, that's where he practiced his
accordion until he left,'' Nieuwsma said.
   ``Lawrence never wanted to be a farmer but he made a deal with
his father that he'd work on the farm until he was 21, in return
for a $400 accordion.''
   Welk kept his part of the bargain _ and went on to one of the
country's most successful bandleaders. He formed his own band in
1927 and got his start in radio at WNAX in Yankton, S.D. The band
was known as ``The Honolulu Fruit Gum Orchestra'' and ``Lawrence
Welk and his Hotsy Totsy Boys,'' and played at area ballrooms for
several years in the late 1920s and early 1930s.
   ``He started out with polkas and waltzes,'' Eiseman said. ``It's
just the general heritage around here. Everybody plays polkas and
waltzes.''
   In the late 1930s, the band traveled east to the William Penn
Hotel in Pittsburgh, where ``Champagne Music'' was born. Welk then
made his headquarters in the Chicago area in the 1940s, and became
a national television hit in the late 1950s, first as a summer
replacement and then as a regularly weekly show.
   His syndicated television show, now in reruns, is still a
favorite among North Dakotans on Saturday nights.

   Egypt sent its foreign minister to the White
House on Tuesday with a ``message of peace'' and this advice: Talk
to the PLO again.
   The U.S. reply, through spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, was that
talks with Yasser Arafat's group had only been suspended _ not cut
off forever more.
   To get the 18-month dialogue resumed, all Arafat has to do is
punish the perpetrators of the attempted May 30 assault on Tel Aviv
and denounce it as well, U.S. officials said.
   As for the message carried by Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid, the Egyptian emissary declined to provide any
details, and Fitzwater and other U.S. officials were not filling in
the information blanks.
   But Abdel-Meguid provided a couple of clues after he saw
Secretary of State James A. Baker III at the State Department.
   He said it was up to Israel to get the stalled process going,
and that Egypt was willing to resume its role of conduit to the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``If this can help, if the parties are ready,'' the foreign
minister told reporters.
   ``I think the Palestinians are certainly part of the peace
process and this has been known since the peace process started,''
Abdel-Meguid said.
   At the same time, he suggested it was Israel's fault there are
no negotiations in the Middle East. ``It is for Israel to respond
to the peace process now,'' the foreign minister said.
   Egypt, working with the PLO, helped arrange the formula that
Baker presented to Israel in March. It provided for talks between
Israel and Palestinians in Cairo.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who proposed Palestinian
elections last year, resisted provisions to include Palestinians
deported from the West Bank and others with homes in East Jerusalem
in the negotiations.
   The Israeli Cabinet collapsed under the strain. This month
Shamir formed a new government and Bush has written to ask the
prime minister what his intentions are for dealing with
Palestinians.
   Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said
Tuesday that Shamir had not replied. Nor has the Bush
administration invited the new Israeli foreign minister, David
Levy, to Washington for talks.
   Fitzwater said Bush's meeting with Abdel-Meguid focused on the
peace process and on Bush's decision to suspend the 18-month U.S.
dialogue with the PLO.
   ``The president made two essential points in the discussion,''
the spokesman said. ``First, that the United States is committed to
continuing the peace process and we want to work as best we can to
get a dialogue going that will help resolve those issues.
   ``Secondly, the president reiterated that his action with regard
to the PLO was a suspension of our dialogue and that we continue to
look to the PLO to make those actions and statements that would
allow us to resume a dialogue at some point in the future,''
Fitzwater said.
   In the foiled raid, two speedboats crammed with Palestinian
guerrillas were spotted by radar and intercepted by the Israeli
navy before they could reach the Tel Aviv beach. Four of the
guerrillas were killed and 12 captured.
   Abul Abbas, a member of the PLO's Executive Committee, claimed
responsibility for the attack. The Bush administration wants Arafat
to punish him, but so far there is no sign the chairman will act
against the head of the Palestine Liberation Front.

<TEXT>
   Lithuania's prime minister told
parliament Tuesday that breaking away from the Soviet Union would
be impossible without a compromise with the Kremlin, and asked the
Lithuanian Supreme Council to freeze its declaration of
independence.
   Kazimiere Prunskiene said Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
agreed in a telephone call earlier in the day that in return for a
temporary suspension of its March 11 independence declaration, he
would end the nine-week-old economic embargo against the breakaway
Baltic republic.
   Gorbachev also said he would begin negotiations that ``will
discuss a different status for Lithuania, including as an
independent state,'' the prime minister said.
   There was no confirmation from Soviet officials of Mrs.
Prunskiene's claim that Gorbachev had softened his position on
independence. The only statement from Moscow about Lithuania was
more toughly worded.
   Mrs. Prunskiene argued that Lithuania will not escape the
economic blockade imposed in April by the Kremlin, take control of
its borders, or be free of Soviet Army soldiers without
compromising.
   ``We need negotiations,'' she said. ``We don't have a magic wand
to solve these problems.''
   Mrs. Prunskiene also hinted the future of her government _
including her own possible resignation _ may depend on how the
Supreme Council parliament reacts to the proposed compromise.
   ``Maybe a new government could find some such solution,'' she
said.
   Lithuania, a republic of 3.8 million people, and its parliament
are divided over whether to accept a compromise with Moscow over
the declaration of independence.
   Gorbachev met with Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis in
Moscow on Tuesday morning, then telephoned Mrs. Prunskiene two
hours later in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius to offer what the
prime minister described to parliament as a softening of his
position.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said she was optimistic a compromise would lead
to Lithuanian independence in part because Gorbachev in the
telephone conversation did not repeat his demand that the republic
``return to March 10'' _ once again act as a Soviet republic rather
than an independent state.
   She argued that that amounts to willingness to negotiate with
Lithuania as a sovereign state, and recognition of its declaration
of independence.
   But the Soviet news agency Tass, quoting what it said was an
official report on the meeting with Landsbergis, said the
Lithuanian president was told talks can only be held ``if Lithuania
declares a moratorium and suspends the act of March 11 for a period
of talks. They can be held only in the context of an
inter-republican dialogue on the preparation of a new union treaty
and the formation of a union of sovereign socialists states.''
   Landsbergis did not give the parliament a clear account of his
meeting with Gorbachev, but said he came away from it with a much
better idea of what was acceptable to the Soviet leader.
   He said he may return to Moscow on Wednesday if more discussions
are necessary.
   Committees of the Supreme Council will meet on Wednesday to
discuss 10 versions of the compromise. The full parliament is to
discuss them Thursday.
   Landsbergis said Gorbachev reviewed eight of the 10 options
during the meeting.
   Unlike Mrs. Prunskiene, Landsbergis made no appeal for
acceptance of the compromise in his speech to parliament. The
Lithuanian president said he was simply offering a draft for
discussion.
   Top Soviet officials also reportedly were debating whether to
delay the critical national Communist Party Congress, scheduled to
open July 2. Gorbachev might face a challenge to his leadership
from traditional Soviet communists at the meeting, and a walkout by
progressives.
   Lithuanian officials said privately a sharp debate was going on
in the republic on how their drive for independence would be
affected by the congress and its effect on Gorbachev's power.
   The Lithuanians indicated they do not know if they should accept
the compromise while Gorbachev is strong enough to offer it, or
hold out for possible victory by reformers who support the
republic's right to independence.
   The Kremlin cut off all oil, most natural gas and some other raw
materials to the republic in nine weeks ago in an attempt to force
it to rescind the declaration of independence.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said Western powers want Lithuania to negotiate
and reduce the tension between East and West caused by the
confrontation.
   A small group of foreign correspondents was allowed back into
the republic for the first time in weeks on Tuesday. The Soviet
Foreign Ministry has been barring correspondents from traveling to
Lithuania.

   The world's first test-tube tiger cub pounced
and growled during her National Zoo debut Tuesday before settling
down with a big bottle of milk.
   The 20-pound bouncing Bengal is one of a litter of three cubs
produced by in vitro fertilization in an effort to save endangered
tiger species.
   Mary Alice, the only surviving cub, was born by Caesarean
section April 27.
   ``This is a marvelous step forward for all those cats on the
verge of extinction,'' said Michael Robinson, director of the
National Zoo. ``In 20 years of our lifetime, we have lost three
subspecies of tigers.''
   During a meetings with journalists, Mary Alice fussed and
squirmed until her keeper stuck a milk bottle in her mouth.
   Then, the yellow-and-black cub stood up on her hind legs,
grasped the bottle with her front paws, closed her eyes and sucked
aggressively until her chin was covered with milk.
   Mary Alice is expected to weigh about 300 pounds when she is
fully grown.
   A second yellow-and-black cub died of pneumonia three weeks
after birth, but zoo officials said the death was not related to
the in vitro procedure. The third cub, a white tiger, died shortly
after birth.
   The surrogate mother, Nicole, a 9{-year-old Siberian tiger is
from the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, Neb. A male tiger named Chester
provided the sperm that scientists used to fertilize three eggs
taken from two other tigers.
   Mary Alice eventually will be housed at the Omaha zoo.
   Of the 37 species of felines, all but the domestic cat are
threatened or endangered, according to the National Zoo's Center
for New Opportunities in Animal Health Sciences. That means a
species is either dying out or not reproducing rapidly enough to
survive long-term.
   Since 1969, three subspecies of tigers have become extinct and
the South China tiger is critically endangered, with only 50
remaining in the world.
   There are more tigers in the world's zoos than there are in the
wild _ 31 black-footed cats; 21 sand cats; and 12 pallas cats in
zoos, according to center officials.
   ``Sometimes people use the words `captive' and `research' as
four-letter words,'' said Lee Simmons, director of the Omaha zoo.
   ``This animal's relatives are captive in Siberia and other
countries,'' he said. ``The habitats for many animals are in
isolated enclaves.''
   When tigers' natural habitats are destroyed, they are limited to
a small area, isolated from other tiger species in their home
countries. While kept in a small area, tigers inbreed, not
producing new genetic material, which causes extinction, Simmons
said.
   National Zoo officials said in vitro fertilization helps
conserve rare tiger species by allowing animals that are sexually
incompatible or separated by long distances to reproduce.
   Mary Alice is named after the wife of Ulysses Seal, a major
participant in programs to conserve tigers in zoos, Simmons said.

<HEAD>Soviets Deny Removing Nuclear Weapons from Baltic Republics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union on Tuesday denied reports it is
shifting nuclear warheads out of its rebellious Baltic and southern
republics and into less volatile regions.
   ``As they told us in the Defense Ministry press center, there is
no need to remove Soviet troops with nuclear weapons around the
Soviet Union, so no unscheduled movements have been made,'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told a regular briefing.
   U.S. officials and private specialists said last week that the
Soviets were moving nuclear warheads out of the Baltics and
southern republics, including Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   The U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
moves reflected Moscow's concerns about nationalist and ethnic
tensions that could lead to attempts by rebel forces to take
control of a nuclear weapons storage depot.
   Stephen Meyer, an authority on the Soviet military and a
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said last
week that Soviet government officials had told him recently they
were consolidating their weapon storage sites for security reasons.
    ``This is a very touchy subject for them,'' Meyer said.
   Meyer said it seemed from his conversations with Soviet
officials that the warhead removal started after a flare-up of
violence in January between armed Azerbaijani and Armenian groups
around Baku, a city where some nuclear warheads are believed to be
stored.
   Moscow sent Russian airborne units to stop the fighting, but
isolated attacks on military units in that area reportedly have
continued.
   Meyer said the consolidation involves not only nuclear warheads
but also conventional armaments. He likened the move to an American
decision in the 1970s to reduce the number of nuclear warhead
storage sites in Western Europe in response to a rise in terrorist
threats against U.S. installations.

<HEAD>Rights Leaders More Focused On Change Than Violence With Mandela</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil rights leaders who worked with Martin
Luther King Jr. say they support Nelson Mandela in his effort to
liberate South Africa's blacks despite his refusal to renounce
violence as King did.
   Mandela is to visit the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change
on Wednesday to lay a wreath at King's tomb. He is to meet with
King's widow, Coretta Scott King, and the Rev. Joseph Lowery,
president of the King-founded Southern Christian Leadership
Conference.
   Civil rights leaders in Atlanta generally have said it is more
important to liberate South African blacks than to insist on
following King's staunch policy of non-violence.
   ``As an advocate of non-violence, I am very concerned about
violence. But violence has a lot of ramifications,'' Lowery said in
an interview after a recent trip to South Africa. ``There is state
violence in South Africa, which makes it difficult for blacks to
commit themselves to non-violence. The government has not renounced
violence.
   ``We are more than anxious to be helpful,'' Lowery said. ``If
our experiences in desegregation can be helpful, we will offer
them.''
   Mrs. King has said more attention is paid to Mandela's position
on violence than is to the South African government's acts of
violence against blacks.
   In a newspaper column, she said that as chairwoman of the
Mandela visit host committee she would like to show the 71-year-old
African National Congress leader ``the city of Atlanta's impressive
spirit of interracial cooperation.''
   ``There are some differences in every revolution, but I have to
advocate non-violence. I've seen the results,'' said the Rev. Hosea
Williams, King's field lieutenant during the 1960s. ``Right now, if
the blacks in South Africa could overcome apartheid with violence,
they would still be sitting ducks for violence against them.
   ``I would tell Mr. Mandela to please study and evaluate the
teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. before deciding that violence
is the only way to bring about needed social change,'' Williams
said.
   As a young Baptist minister, King led bus boycotts in
Montgomery, Ala., in 1955, and was successful in achieving
integration of the city's public transportation system without
violence. He founded the SCLC in 1957, and dedicated the group to
fighting for social change through peaceful means.
   King advocated worldwide economic sanctions against South Africa
as a means of destroying apartheid, and in a 1964 speech on the
South African situation said ``we can understand how in that
situation people felt so desperate that they turned to other
methods, such as sabotage.''
   At the time of his death, King was greatly troubled by a trend
among black youth to embrace violence.
   Mandela helped found and launch the ANC's guerrilla campaign
after the group was banned in 1960. He was arrested in 1962 and in
1964 was sentenced to life in prison for sabotage and plotting to
overthrow South Africa's white government.
   While on trial, Mandela said the ANC had no choice but to wage
an armed struggle because the group had been outlawed. Mandela and
the organization continue to support armed struggle, saying it is
necessary to keep pressure on the government.
   On Tuesday, speaking to a joint session of Congress, Mandela did
not directly restate his position that violence is a necessary tool
in battling apartheid. But he pointed to the South African
government's oppression of the black majority.
   ``For those who care to worry about violence in our country as
we do, it is at these forces that they should focus their
attention,'' Mandela said.

<TEXT>
   Young men in the United States are more than four
times as likely to be homicide victims than those in 21 other
industrialized countries, according to a study released Tuesday.
   In 1987, there were 4,223 male homicide victims aged 15 to 24 in
the United States, or 21.9 for every 100,000 men in that age group,
researchers said in an article in this week's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   The country with the next highest rate was Scotland with 22
victims, or 5.0 for every 100,000 men in the same category.
Austria's 0.3 was the lowest rate.
   ``If the U.S. homicide rate could be reduced to the next highest
rate, more than 3,000 lives would be saved'' each year, wrote Lois
Fingerhut and Joel Kleinman of the federal National Center for
Health Statistics in Hyattsville, Md.
   While there is no clear reason for the wide differences, ``we
have to look at the availability of firearms,'' said Fingerhut in a
telephone interview from Hyattsville.
   The researchers found that 75 percent of the U.S. deaths were
caused by guns. France was second with 54 percent.
   The researchers used the latest available figures for each of
the 21 countries; most were for 1987 but some were for 1986 or 1985.
   A spokesman for the National Rifle Association in Washington,
Tom Wyld, said the NRA wouldn't comment without studying the
article.
   But James Wright, a Tulane University sociologist who
specializes in criminology, noted that the Swiss own guns and have
almost no history of violence.
   ``But they do emphasize responsible firearm ownership much more
than we do,'' he said.
   According to the NCHS study, only one of 14 homicides in
Switzerland was by firearm.
   ``And, if you subtract all the firearm homicides, we're still
killing loads more people than any other country,'' Wright said
from his office in New Orleans.
   Homicides in the United States in 1987 not involving firearms
outnumbered annual murder totals in all 21 other countries combined
by more than 3-to-1 (1,036 to 308), according to the study.
   ``The argument has been made that comparisons of homicide in the
United States and other countries are not valid because the United
States has such a heterogeneous population,'' the researchers said.
   But they point to Ohio, whose black and metropolitan percentages
mirror the entire United States, but whose homicide rates for both
blacks and whites are less than half the national average.
   Fingerhut said the research focused on the 15-to-24 age group
because 20 percent of all U.S. homicides occurred in this age
group, and because Public Health Service objectives include a sharp
reduction in homicides, especially among black males.
   When comparisions were made for the total population, the U.S.
rate, 8.7 per 100,000, was still 2.6 times higher than the next
highest rate, Finland, with 3.3 per 100,000.
   The U.S. rate among black males 15 to 24 was 85.6 per 100,000,
more than seven times this nation's rate for young white males. But
the rate for white males alone, 11.2, was still more than twice the
rate in Scotland, the study found.
   ``In the United States, homicide is the leading cause of death
among black males aged 15 to 24 years and the third leading cause
(after motor vehicle injuries and suicide) among white males 15
through 24 years of age,'' the researchers wrote in the
Chicago-based JAMA.

   The State Department on Tuesday estimated
there still are 1,000 to 2,000 Chinese in prison after Beijing's
crackdown last year on the pro-democracy movement.
   U.S. officials have been telling the Chinese that ``we hope the
names of all those released will be made available, and that China
will provide an accounting of all those who remain in detention,''
said department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   ``Our best guess is that probably up to 1,000, perhaps 2,000,
remain in prison, but I must caution you that we do not have
accurate information,'' Ms. Tutwiler told reporters.
   She noted the Chinese have officially declared that fewer than
400 people remain in detention, while Amnesty International, a
human rights organization, estimates that 650 are still in prison.
Others have reported higher numbers of prisoners.
   China has announced three releases of prisoners, Ms. Tutwiler
said, one in January of 573 people, one in May of 211 and a third
in June of 97.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard Solomon testified before a
congressional panel earlier this month that at least 2,000 remained
in custody out of the 15,000 arrested in last summer's violent
upheaval. The number of those killed has been estimated in the
hundreds or thousands.

   Robbers with a shotgun ambushed an
armored car whose crew had stopped to buy sandwiches and stole more
than $10 million cash Tuesday in one of the largest heists in U.S.
history, authorities said.
   The Armored Motor Service of America Inc. truck was headed to
the Federal Reserve Bank branch in Buffalo when the robbery
occurred, the Monroe County Sheriff's Department said. The truck's
driver and guard were bound and gagged but were not injured.
   ``We don't have an exact amount,'' Sheriff Andrew P. Meloni
said. ``It's in the neighborhood of $10.8 million.'' He said
authorities have no suspects.
   Meloni said officials have not yet determined where the money
came from.
   The largest reported robbery from a U.S. armored car company was
in 1982, when $11 million was taken from the Sentry Armored Car
Courier Co. in New York City. But authorities have since said much
of the missing money may have been previously embezzled.
   In 1985, nearly $8 million was stolen from a Wells Fargo depot
in Manhattan. In 1983, robbers took gold estimated to be worth up
to $11 million from a smelting firm and jewelry wholesaler in North
Miami, Fla.
   FBI spokesman Bill Carter said armored car robberies are usually
larger than bank robberies.
   The AMSA truck left the company's offices in the Rochester
suburb of Chili about 7 a.m. Tuesday with a male driver and a
female guard aboard, sheriff's department spokesman Tom Ryan said.
The employees' names have not been released.
   They stopped at a store nearby and the guard left the truck to
buy coffee and sandwiches, Ryan said.
   While the woman was in the store, a man stuck a shotgun in the
slot of the armored car and took control of the vehicle, Meloni
said. When the woman returned to the car, she also was placed under
the gunman's control.
   Ryan said investigators believe at least one other person was
involved in the robbery. The employees said they could not give a
good description of the robbers because they were told not to turn
around, he said.
   The employees were ordered to drive to a wooded area in the town
of Henrietta, about half a mile from the convenience store, where
they were tied up, blindfolded and gagged.
   The robbers transferred the money bags, weighing at least 1,600
pounds, from the armored car to another vehicle and drove off, Ryan
said.
   The AMSA employees were able to free themselves within 15
minutes, drove back to the company headquarters and reported the
robbery.
   It was the second multimillion-dollar heist AMSA has suffered in
the past 13 months.
   In May 1989, $2.9 million was stolen from an AMSA truck in East
Syracuse. Two men drove a one-ton truck through an overhead garage
door and pistol-whipped two guards in that robbery.
   Two suspects are now on trial in federal court in Syracuse. One
of the security guards involved pleaded guilty last year to taking
part in the robbery.
   Meloni would not comment on whether Tuesday's robbery could have
been an inside job.
   ``There are a lot of questions, obviously, about the manner of
the heist,'' Meloni said. ``It appeared to be well-planned.''
   Meloni said sheriff's officials and the FBI are looking for
witnesses, reviewing the company's records and questioning the two
employees. He said he could not comment on whether the employees'
actions followed company policy.
   He said one of the robbed employees had worked at AMSA for 6
months and the other for a year.
   The Federal Reserve Bank branch in Buffalo supplies coin and
currency to banks throughout the region. Banks in turn send surplus
money to the Federal Reserve for storage.
   The branch manager, James Aston, said loss or theft of money
headed for the Federal Reserve would be covered under an agreement
between the banks and the carrier, Aston said. ``Typically, the
carrier is insured,'' he said.

   The Senate rejected a constitutional amendment
against flag burning Tuesday with critics arguing that it was
already dead and being debated largely as ammunition for use
against them at election time.
   ``We will take a meaningless vote so that some campaign
operatives can try to bludgeon senators who are willing to stand up
for the Bill of Rights and vote against this amendment,'' Sen.
Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, declared.
   The Senate voted 58-42 in favor, leaving it nine short of the
required two-thirds majority needed to approve amendments.
Thirty-eight Republicans voted in favor and seven voted against;
among Democrats, it was 20 in favor and 35 against.
   President Bush has been calling for approval of the measure,
which said simply that ``Congress and the states shall have power
to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United
States.''
   But the House rejected it last week, falling 34 votes short of
two-thirds with a 254-177 tally in favor. Speaker Thomas Foley said
lawmakers would not get a chance to reconsider this year.
   The Senate's action thus was largely a symbolic gesture that
gave senators a chance to vent their views on an issue that has
raged in the year since the Supreme Court held unconstitutional a
Texas flag-burning law.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas conceded before the
vote that ``we're not going to win now.'' But he said that ``we're
not going to give up and we'll see what happens in the days and
weeks and months ahead.''
   ``In the heartland of America, some folks just can't understand
what Congress is up to,'' Dole said.
   Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine told lawmakers they
could ``support the American flag without changing the American
Constitution.''
   He said it would be ``a sad irony'' to see flag burners
``stampeding those who love America into taking the unwise action
of changing the Bill of Rights for the first time in our history.
   ``I love America and the American flag and the American Bill of
Rights too much to let that happen without a fight,'' Mitchell said.
   Conservative supporters held out hope that if the Senate
approved the amendment they could somehow revive the measure in the
House, while critics said the idea was to put them on record on an
emotional issue that could help their challengers.
   ``Stirred by fears of sound-bites and 30-second spots, members
of Congress who should know better are expressing a willingness to
sacrifice the Bill of Rights for what they hope will be a benefit
in the polls,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   But Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said the issue was ``so
important that it should be sent to the states where the American
people can decide whether they want to protect the flag.''
   ``If we in the Senate pass it, I have a feeling the House will
pass it,'' Thurmond said.
   In a dramatic switch, Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., declared he had
changed his mind since last year when he backed the constitutional
amendment.
   Robb said that after the Supreme Court decision he as a veteran
felt anger toward flag burners and ``feared the visceral outrage of
most Americans.''
   Robb fought in Vietnam as a Marine Corps officer.
   ``I have concluded that our flag can better be protected by not
tinkering with the First Amendment'' to the Constitution, Robb said.
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., called for approval of the
amendment, saying that ``Americanism cannot survive unless it has
nationalism'' and ``Americanism is bottomed on nationalism.''
   ``Americanism must have sacred symbols,'' Heflin said.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., reminded the Senate that President
Woodrow Wilson had advocated a maximum of free speech to make sure
that those who were fools would be exposed as such by their own
words.
   ``Those who burn the American flag are fools; let's not dignify
them by changing the Bill of Rights,'' Rudman said.
   Before voting on the amendment itself, the Senate rejected three
rival versions.
   The Senate rejected, 90-10, a plan offered by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., that would strip the Supreme Court of its authority to
decide flag-burning cases.
   Helms pointed to the close 5-4 vote in the Supreme Court and
said his measure was the most effective way to combat ``these kooks
... these loonies who burn the American flag.''
   Critics said the Helms plan would violate long-established law
giving the Supreme Court jurisdiction over constitutional issues.
``It's almost as ancient as the Republic,'' said Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn.
   The Senate also voted 51-48 to kill a plan offered by Sen. Dale
Bumpers, D-Ark., that would replace the amendment with legislation
to ban burning the flag in any way that would cause a breach of the
peace.
   Critics said approval of the measure would make it impossible to
get a vote on the amendment that had been urged by the president
for a year. But Bumpers said that measure was drawn so broadly that
it would cover numerous harmless uses of the flag.
   ``You can't buy a Coke without a reproduction of the flag on the
cup,'' Bumpers said. ``Pantyhouse, swizel sticks _ everything!''
   By 93-7, the Senate rejected a proposal offered by Judiciary
Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., that would allow
Congress to ban flag burning but deny that power to the states.

<HEAD>Peruvians Line Up for Bread, Gasoline as Economic Crisis Deepens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY LYNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peruvians lined up to buy bread, gasoline and
other essentials Tuesday as President-elect Alberto Fujimori
prepared to travel to the United States to seek aid to cope with a
deepening economic crisis.
   In Lima, housewives stood in block-long lines to buy bottled
cooking gas. Children waited hours to buy fist-sized loaves of
bread. Hundreds of taxis and buses idled near the few open gas
stations.
   Peru's currency, the Inti, lost value by the hour. On the free
market the Inti has been devalued by 48 percent in one week, and by
23 percent since Monday morning.
   The shortages come five weeks before Fujimori is to be sworn in
as Peru's next president. Fujimori, an agronomist who was a
political unknown at the start of the election campaign, defeated
noted novelist Mario Vargas Llosa in the June 10 presidential
runoff.
   On Thursday, Fujimori is scheduled to travel to New York, where
he plans to visit the United Nations to seek emergency economic aid
to finance food imports.
   He will also travel to Washington to meet with officials of the
International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Inter-American
Development Bank. He hopes to reestablish ties with international
lenders that were broken by his predecessor, Alan Garcia, who
limited payments on the country's $20 billion foreign debt.
   Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrants, will then travel on to
Tokyo for meetings with Japanese leaders. Japan has said it is
willing to resume loans to Peru if the country can show a
willingness to deal with its serious social and economic problems.
   In Lima, the shortages have only added to the problems of the
capital's 7 million residents who already suffer from daily
blackouts, severe water rationing and runaway inflation.
   The general manager of Petroperu, the state-owned oil company,
blamed the fuel shortages on panic buying and excess demand.
   ``Petroperu is very worried by the situation,'' Pedro Touzett
told a news conference Tuesday. ``People whose gas tanks are
normally half empty are trying to fill them up every night.
Housewives who normally store one gallon of kerosene are storing
five.''
   Touzett added that the shortage of electricity had increased
demand for cooking gas and gasoline to power private generators. He
said the power shortages also hampered fuel distribution because
gas stations cannot operate their pumps and natural gas bottlers
their machinery.
   The Bread Industry Association attributed the bread shortages to
reduced wheat imports. Peru imports all but 150,000 tons of the 1.2
million tons of wheat the country consumes each year.
   ``Once more we beg the government to import on a bigger scale
and to do so continuously,'' Gilberto Hinojosa Teves of the Bread
Industry Association told reporters Monday.
   But economists say that many imports have been reduced because
of a lack of foreign currency.
   The government has been selling silver and gold to raise money.
The Central Bank reserves stand at $900 million, mostly gold and
silver.
   Centrist politician Manuel Moreyra said Monday that the rapid
devaluation of the Inti was due to the government's ``unusual
emission of bills as well as the uncertainty before political
change.''
   The country's problems have been compounded by a severe drought
that has cut crop production and hydroelectric power, and attacks
by Maoist Shining Path guerrillas on power lines.

   The State Department on Tuesday estimated
there still are 1,000 to 2,000 Chinese in prison after Beijing's
crackdown last year on the pro-democracy movement.
   U.S. officials have been telling the Chinese that ``we hope the
names of all those released will be made available, and that China
will provide an accounting of all those who remain in detention,''
said department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   ``Our best guess is that probably up to 1,000, perhaps 2,000,
remain in prison, but I must caution you that we do not have
accurate information,'' Ms. Tutwiler told reporters.
   She noted the Chinese have officially declared that fewer than
400 people remain in detention, while Amnesty International, a
human rights organization, estimates that 650 are still in prison.
Others have reported higher numbers of prisoners.
   China has announced three releases of prisoners, Ms. Tutwiler
said, one in January of 573 people, one in May of 211 and a third
in June of 97.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard Solomon testified before a
congressional panel earlier this month that at least 2,000 remained
in custody out of the 15,000 arrested in last summer's violent
upheaval. The number of those killed has been estimated in the
hundreds or thousands.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration announced preliminary
plans for saving the threatened northern spotted owl Tuesday,
contending it can be done with a far-less-drastic reduction in
timber cutting than government scientists say. Even so, 1,000
Northwest logging jobs would be lost.
   For the second time in a week, officials delayed issuing a
complete proposal to support their public hopes that the bird can
be saved without economically devastating the region by greatly
restricting timber cutting.
   Tuesday's outlook from Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. was in stark contrast to
estimates by government scientists that timber-cutting reductions
that would cost 28,000 jobs by the end of the decade would be
necessary to save the owl's habitat in the Northwest's old-growth
forests.
   Environmental groups said in advance they would likely challenge
in court any action short of that.
   ``Today we have set into motion a process to balance our
responsibility in preserving the owl and forests while protecting
the economic lives of American men and women who live and work in
the region,'' Yeutter said.
   He said he will chair a new timber task force that will present
to President Bush no later than Sept. 1 a comprehensive proposal
for protecting the owl while pursuing maximum timber harvests on
Forest Service lands in the Pacific Northwest.
   At the same time, the Cabinet secretaries also called on
Congress to broaden provisions of the Endangered Species Act so
that an exemption committee will have more latitude to consider the
economic and social impact of protecting such wildlife.
   Congressional members of both parties blasted administration
officials for failing to outline more specific proposals, accusing
them of ducking the issue.
   ``These proposals are a sham, they're smoke and mirrors,'' said
Rep. Bob Smith, an Oregon Republican.
   Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., said the administration is trying
to ``throw it back to us and expect us to work miracles.
   ``I think they have come up with something they know is
impossible but will give them a chance to dump it back on
Congress,'' she said.
   The estimated 6,000 remaining owls were declared a threatened
species under the act last week.
   Under the act, federal agencies are prohibited from harming the
owl or its critical habitat without first receiving permission from
the Fish and Wildlife Service.
   Lujan and Yeutter said the Bureau of Land Management will put
into effect a plan that will result in the eventual loss of 1,000
jobs due to reduced timber harvests on BLM lands in Oregon and
northern California.
   An earlier proposal by government scientists would have resulted
in the loss of 7,600 jobs as a result of cutting reductions on
Bureau of Land Management land and the loss of an additional 20,000
jobs by the end of the decade as a result of reductions on Forest
Service land.
   Despite the lesser reductions, Lujan said that by careful
cutting the BLM land proposal would protect 125 more pairs of owls
than would the proposal offered by the government scientists led by
Forest Service biologist Jack Ward Thomas.
   Lujan said cutting on Bureau of Land Management acreage in
Oregon and northern California would be reduced from 950 million
board feet annually to about 750 million board feet. The Thomas
proposal would have cut harvests on the lands to less than 500
million board feet.
   Lujan said the Bureau of Land Management is determined to have a
minimal impact on owl habitat as it seeks maximum timber harvest
levels.
   ``We're not going to just go in there and cut willy, nilly. Any
contract submitted to us must meet the test of the Fish and
Wildlife Service. If we don't meet the test, we don't cut,'' he
said.
   Yeutter said the Forest Service will operate under existing
forest plans until the new timber task force can come up with an
interim conservation proposal for the owl, a move that should allow
the service to harvest the 3.85 billion board feet of timber
mandated by Congress last year.
   Under the earlier recommendations of the government scientists,
cutting on Forest Service lands in the region would have been
reduced to between 2.3 billion and 2.5 billion board feet.
   Yeutter also announced for the first time publicly that the
administration supports a proposal to ban exports of raw logs from
state lands in Oregon and Washington as a way to offset any
reduction in timber supply resulting from owl protection.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service last Friday announced its decision
to classify the owl as a threatened species entitled to protection
under the same law that has protected the grizzly bear and bald
eagle.
   Biologists say each nesting pair of owls needs a large tract of
undisturbed old-growth forest.

<HEAD>Opposition Groups Agree to Join Forces for Next Presidential
Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France's two main rightist opposition groups agreed
Tuesday to join forces for the next presidential campaign and
present a single candidate to challenge the Socialists'
standard-bearer.
   The alliance between the conservative Rally for the Republic
party and the center-right coalition, the Union for French
Democracy, will avoid ``fratricidal battles'' in the 1995
presidential election, said former Premier Jacques Chirac, the
leader of the Rally for the Republic.
   The two groups decided they would form a confederation, to be
called the Union for France, to field a single presidential
candidate. The nominee would be chosen through a series of
U.S.-style primaries culminating in a national convention.
   Chirac and former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, head of
the Union for French Democracy, said the confederation would
exclude any alliances with the extreme-right National Front or the
governing Socialist Party.
   ``Each movement will retain its personality'' within the
confederation, Chirac said.
   The decision was made at a lengthy meeting of a coordinating
committee of the two groups, presided over by Chirac and Giscard.
   Polls have shown voters would prefer a single rightist candidate
to counter the governing Socialists. An effort in this direction
was made with the recent creation of the United Force, a grouping
of personalities from the two rightist groups, some of whom would
like to see a single conservative party.
   The Union for France would be run by a 30-member political
bureau. Chirac said its goal is to present a common political
agenda.
   ``Whatever the circumstances, this confederation will back only
candidates who share the same political and moral values,'' said
Chirac.
   Francois Leotard, leader of the Republican Party in the Union
for French Democracy, denounced the confederation as too timid. A
member of the United Force, Leotard said the confederation would
solve neither ``disciplinary ... nor electoral'' problems, nor the
problem of ``relations with public opinion.''
   Socialist President Francois Mitterrand is in his second
seven-year term.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Calls Off Cleanup From Norwegian Tanker _ No Evidence
of Oil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GALVESTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard ended its efforts to
track spilled oil from the supertanker Mega Borg after crews
Tuesday failed to find any sign of the oil sheen in the Gulf of
Mexico.
   Since Sunday, Coast Guard pilots have been unable to spot the
sheen, once 45 miles long, which had come within 7 miles of the
Texas shoreline last week, officials said.
   ``We're expecting it to dissipate,'' said Coast Guard Chief
Warrant Officer Howard Edmonds. ``We don't think it will come
ashore.''
   An estimated 3.9 million gallons of Angolan crude oil spilled
from the Norwegian supertanker when it exploded June 8. Officials
believe most of the oil burned, evaporated or was scooped up by 11
skimmers.
   Edmonds said Tuesday the Coast Guard was calling back its flight
crews and beach patrols, which have been looking for tar balls from
Galveston to Sabine Pass for the past 10 days. He said winds and
waves are believed to have broken up the remaining oil and pushed
it back out to sea.
   Meanwhile, salvage crews continued transfering oil from the Mega
Borg to smaller cargo vessels. The transfers are expected to be
completed Wednesday, Edmonds said.
   The 886-foot Norwegian ship exploded while crews were
transferring its 38 million gallon cargo onto a smaller vessel in a
process called lightering. The supertanker burned for more than a
week some 57 miles offshore from Galveston.
   Two crew members were killed, while two others remain missing
and are presumed dead. Seventeen other crewmen were injured. The
ship owners have not said whether the supertanker will be repaired
or scrapped.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, who won the White House with a
``read-my-lips'' pledge of no new taxes, conceded Tuesday that tax
increases must be part of any plan to shrink the mushrooming budget
deficit.
   The politically charged admission was quickly hailed by
Democrats, who had demanded that Bush and his Republican allies
share the heat for digging deeper into taxpayers' pockets during an
election year.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill. and chairman of the tax-writing
House Ways and Means Committee, called Bush's statement ``an
important step in the right direction,'' while the White House said
it marked the turning point in sluggish negotiations with Congress
to write a plan to reduce the deficit.
   ``We're going to have to do some things that are probably not
going to be universally popular in dealing with the budget
deficit,'' said House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash.
   Neither the White House nor congressional Democrats would
speculate on what taxes might be raised or what spending programs
might be trimmed.
   ``We're not willing to give it any definition,'' presidential
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said of Bush's statement. ``That's
a matter for the negotiators.''
   Some Republicans balked at Bush's decision and it quickly became
a political target.
   Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa., a member of the House GOP leadership,
urged members of Congress to sign a letter declaring any increase
in tax rates unacceptable. By the end of the day, 90 Republicans _
more than half the 176 GOP members of the House _ had put their
names on the paper.,
   Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said the ``charade is finally
over.''
   ``The other shoe raised in the 1988 presidential campaign has
just dropped. George Bush has announced that he's raising taxes,''
Torricelli said.
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said Bush had scotched an election-year
theme for Republicans.
   ``It removes this so-called tax and spend issue from their
arsenal of weapons,'' he said.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said the
president had concluded that tax increases are necessary ``and we
share the president's view.''
   Foley added: ``I think someone who is complaining about taxes
being raised in the budget summit will have to complain against
both parties and the president.''
   White House chief of staff John Sununu tried to calm the
Republican revolt. House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia
said Sununu had assured him that nothing had changed in Bush's
position on taxes. ``The White House claims the statement doesn't
mean anything new,'' Gingrich insisted.
   Deficit estimates have sharply increased since Bush unveiled his
budget in January, and red ink may total more than $200 billion in
the next fiscal year.
   ``We're not interested in who's first (to mention taxes) and
who's last and who gets the blame for this and that,'' Fitzwater
said. ``Both sides want to move in a bipartisan way to resolve this
issue, and this statement is designed to reflect that feeling.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, Bush's Democratic rival in
the 1988 presidential election, said he told the truth about the
need for higher taxes and ``paid the price'' by losing the
presidency.
   ``Mr. Bush did not (tell the truth) and we're all now going to
have to pay the price for that,'' Dukakis said in Boston.
   Meanwhile, Democratic Party Chairman Ron Brown said Bush's
statement was candid and sober and ``gives no one comfort. It's no
time for partisan gloating.''
   Budget talks are scheduled to resume Wednesday, and the White
House expressed hope for a final agreement by the August
congressional recess.
   Bush issued his statement after a breakfast session with top
congressional leaders and following a weekend of meetings between
Democrats and White House budget negotiators.
   ``It is clear to me,'' Bush said, ``that both the size of the
deficit problem and the need for a package that can be enacted
require all of the following.''
   He listed ``tax revenue increases,'' cuts in spending for
federal benefits as well as reductions in other domestic and
defense programs, reform of the budget process and ``growth
incentives,'' a term often used to describe a cut in the capital
gains tax rate.
   Bush, asked about his statement as he left a photo session, said
the written statement ``speaks for itself'' and declined to
specifically address reporters' questions about his position.
   ``I want to see this economy grow,'' he said. ``I want jobs. I
want to see the deficit down. And this bipartisan statement speaks
for itself. Now we're going on to some serious negotiation.''
   He hailed congressional Democrats for the ``good faith'' spirit
of the budget talks and said it was ``essential that these talks
get moving.''
   From the outset of the budget talks, Bush had said that
everything was on the table for negotiation.
   Until now, however, he had refused to say explicitly that tax
increases must be included in the deficit-reduction formula.
   The White House refused to acknowledge that Bush had scrapped
his no-new-taxes pledge.
   ``Are you crazy?'' Fitzwater good-naturedly asked reporters.
   However, Fitzwater said Bush's statement amounted to ``a
refinement'' of his earlier remarks.
   ``We've got to deal realistically with this problem,'' he said.
   On the other hand, Fitzwater said, ``I don't think that it
(Bush's statement) is that big a change. We're still a long way
from the final details of a settlement.''
   There is a general consensus among budget negotiators that they
need to reduce the deficit by $45 billion to $60 billion in the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and about $400 billion to $600 billion
over the next five years.
   Technically, the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law would
require far deeper cuts, based on current revenue and spending
projections. By law, the government will be forced to absorb deep,
across-the-board spending cuts unless the deficit is kept to $74
billion in fiscal 1991.

   Nelson Mandela, who spent 27 years in jail for
opposing his government, will meet this week with another famous
dissident, Natan Sharansky.
   The meeting with the former Soviet prisoner will take place on
Friday in Los Angeles, a day before Mandela winds up his 10-day
U.S. tour, the Anti-Defamation League announced Tuesday.
   Sharansky was imprisoned in Soviet jails and labor camps for
more than eight years on false charges of treason, before being
exchanged in a 1986 East-West prisoner swap and allowed to go to
Israel.
   ``It is indeed appropriate for these two giants of our
generation _ heroes to blacks and Jews worldwide _ to share their
experiences and to begin a dialogue exploring common grounds on a
variety of issues,'' said ADL director Abraham H. Foxman.
   Foxman said he proposed the meeting to Mandela when he met with
him in Geneva earlier this month at the head of an American Jewish
delegation that wanted to protest the South African leader's warm
praise for Palestinian chieftain Yasser Arafat. Mandela allayed
some of the Jewish officials' concerns by advocating Israel's right
to exist within secure borders.
   Mandela told Foxman he had read Sharansky's autobiography,
``Fear No Evil,'' the Jewish official said.

   The 12-nation European Community on
Tuesday called on all South Africans to renounce violence in a
declaration that Britain said was directed squarely at Nelson
Mandela's African National Congress.
   But the leaders of the trade bloc, at the end of a two-day
summit, refused to ease sanctions against South Africa's white-led
government, saying they need ``further clear evidence'' that
changes to end apartheid will continue.
   The statement came as Mandela was being lionized on a visit to
the United States, where he called for sanctions to be maintained.
But Mandela also caused unease in Washington by his continued
refusal to renounce violence.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said it was a ``great
pity'' that the EC nations were ``unable to agree publicly to make
a start now on easing sanctions.''
   ``What they have done is something I am very pleased about,''
she added. ``They have condemned pretty clearly anyone who
advocates violence ... and that goes straight to the armed struggle
in no uncertain terms, and that ought to be abandoned.''
   Despite the refusal to lift sanctions, South Africa's government
welcomed the EC statement.
   ``What the declaration says, albeit not in so many words, is
that South Africa has regained international respectability,''
Foreign Minister Pik Botha said in Pretoria. ``The use of violence
is rejected,'' he added. ``By implication, this means that the
ANC's adherence to the armed struggle is unacceptable.''
   The summit was dominated by the South African issue and by a
West German and French demand for $15 billion in immediate aid to
help the Soviet Union's deteriorating economy. Other leaders
rejected the demand.
   On the issue of South African sanctions, the community said it
``affirms its willingness to consider a gradual relaxation of this
pressure when there is further clear evidence that the process of
change already initiated continues.''
   ``The European Council calls on all parties ... to refrain from
violence or advocacy of violence,'' the communiquesaid.
   The leaders described South African President F.W. de Klerk as a
man of ``foresight and courage'' and said Mandela has ``inspired
millions of South Africans opposed to apartheid.''
   But in effect, the community stuck to a position adopted at a
summit in Strasbourg, France, six months ago. Since then, de Klerk
has begun a reform program, including releasing Mandela after 27
years in jail, legalizing the ANC and scrapping some apartheid laws.
   Britain, backed by Portugal, argued that de Klerk deserved a
specific reward. But Ireland and Denmark were adamant that
sanctions remain.
   Britain, Italy, Spain and Portugal have already lifted some
relatively minor restrictions.
   But unanimous support by the EC nations is needed to end joint
embargoes imposed in 1986 that banned imports of South African
iron, steel and gold coins.
   On Soviet aid, the community ordered its executive commission to
undertake with the World Bank and other international agencies a
study of Moscow's needs.
   Most of the leaders opposed giving money to the Soviet Union
with no clear idea of how it would be used.
   ``It wouldn't be responsible for the community to fix a budget
without knowing the needs,'' said Spain's prime minister, Felipe
Gonzalez.
   In a related development, a Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman
acknowledged in Moscow on Tuesday that the Soviet Union was having
trouble paying $2 billion in foreign bills, but he asked for more
Western credits to help move toward a market economy.
   Officials said they expected Italy, which takes over the
community's six-month rotating presidency July 1, to have Soviet
aid proposals ready by fall.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl predicted that an aid package
would be organized by the end of the year. But Kohl, who has
pledged $3.1 billion of West German credit guarantees for the
Soviet Union, complained that ``whenever there is a question of
money, the question first goes to the Federal Republic of Germany.''
   In a separate development, the leaders expressed ``deep
revulsion at recent manifestations of anti-Semitism, racism and
xenophobia'' in Western Europe, particularly a spate of
desecrations of Jewish graves.
   Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti said he had received a
letter from Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat
``distancing'' himself from the foiled May 30 seaborne attack by
Palestinian guerrillas on a beach near Tel Aviv.
   Andreotti referred to the letter while speaking to Italian
reporters, but gave no details.
   The United States last week suspended its 18-month dialogue with
the PLO because of Arafat's failure to condemn the raid and
discipline Mohammed Abbas' Palestine Liberation Front, which
claimed responsibility for the attack.
   On Monday, pressing ahead with plans for closer union, the
leaders agreed to start intergovernmental conferences in Rome in
mid-December aimed at achieving an undefined form of political
union, and economic and monetary union by 1993.

   Nelson Mandela stood before Congress on
Tuesday where no black from America had ever stood _ not Frederick
Douglass, not Booker T. Washington, not W.E.B. DuBois, not Martin
Luther King Jr.
   His arms raised in triumph from the podium of the House of
Representatives, the deputy presiden of the African National
Congress became the third heroic figure from abroad to address a
joint meeting in these revolutionary times.
   Lech Walesa, an electrician from Poland; Vaclav Havel, a
president-playwright from Czechoslovakia; and now the 71-year-old
Mandela, a prisoner for 27 years in South Africa.
   Mandela is a representative of a struggle _ he pointedly made
clear _ that is not over.
   A dedicated revolutionary who will not renounce the use of arms,
he craftily reminded his audience of American blood that has been
shed in the cause of freedom, using words known to every
schoolchild and every member of Congress.
   ``Equality, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,'' he said,
``are fundamental human rights which are not only inalienable but
must, if necessary, be defended with the weapons of war.''
   This was said by an erect, trim, tidy, calm man in a soft,
lilting South African English that made his audience strain to hear.
   Before him sat Washington: the House, the Senate, the Cabinet,
military men led by a black general, Colin Powell, chairman of the
joint chiefs of staff; the diplomatic corps, including one black
African ambassador in a sweeping white robe.
   Often, when dignitaries visit, members of Congress find other
demands more pressing and the seats are filled by staff. Not this
time.
   The overflow sat in Statuary Hall, amid the granite figures,
watching on four television sets. When he finished, even that
audience applauded.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., stayed away. He had fought vigorously
when Congress, overriding a veto by then-President Reagan, imposed
sanctions on South Africa to bring pressure for an end of the rigid
system of segregation known as apartheid.
   Helms had said in the debate that sanctions would lead to
``everlasting tyranny.''
   Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., said he boycotted ``as a
matter of principle.'' He said Mandela was more like the 1960s
revolutionary H. Rap Brown than Martin Luther King Jr.
   But for the 24 black members of the House, the moment was
precious.
   Kweisi Mfume, formerly Frizzell Gray, wore a black African sash
with stripes of red and gold, over his gray business suit. He is a
Democratic member of the House from Baltimore.
   Someone else, apparently a staff member, brought his tiny son,
dressed in a suit, and led him across the House floor by the hand.
   Before his address, Mandela met with Congress' blacks members
and a handful of their white allies. He thanked them for pushing
through sanctions.
   ``To be there, to see him, to have him thank members of the
Congressional Black Caucus, makes my lifetime in politics
worthwhile,'' said Rep. Charles B. Rangel, a Democrat who
represents Harlem.
   During the speech, a shriek _ a whoop _ went up when Mandela
ticked off the names of his American heroes.
   ``All right!'' people called out. ``Right on!''
   He named Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, of course, but his list
included names not always on such lists:
   John Brown, the firebrand abolitionist whose anger at slavery
helped start the Civil War; Sojourner Truth, the black lady
preacher who could neither read nor write but whose words stirred
the North; Frederick Douglass, the runaway slave who bought his own
freedom with the earnings from his speeches against slavery; Marcus
Garvey, ``the black Moses''; and King, who dreamed of freedom from
the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.
   None of them, in their time, had been honored with an invitation
to address Congress, the American equivalent to knighthood.
   Mandela became the first black who was not a head of state to
whom that honor was bestowed.
   He said he came not as a leader but ``as a particle'' of a
people ``who we know to be noble and heroic, enduring, multiplying,
permanent, rejoicing in the expectation and knowledge that their
humanity will be reaffirmed.''

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela, who spent 27 years in jail for
opposing his government, will meet this week with another famous
dissident, Natan Sharansky.
   The meeting with the former Soviet prisoner will take place on
Friday in Los Angeles, a day before Mandela winds up his 10-day
U.S. tour, the Anti-Defamation League announced Tuesday.
   Sharansky was imprisoned in Soviet jails and labor camps for
more than eight years on false charges of treason, before being
exchanged in a 1986 East-West prisoner swap and allowed to go to
Israel.
   ``It is indeed appropriate for these two giants of our
generation _ heroes to blacks and Jews worldwide _ to share their
experiences and to begin a dialogue exploring common grounds on a
variety of issues,'' said ADL director Abraham H. Foxman.
   Foxman said he proposed the meeting to Mandela when he met with
him in Geneva earlier this month at the head of an American Jewish
delegation that wanted to protest the South African leader's warm
praise for Palestinian chieftain Yasser Arafat. Mandela allayed
some of the Jewish officials' concerns by advocating Israel's right
to exist within secure borders.
   Mandela told Foxman he had read Sharansky's autobiography,
``Fear No Evil,'' the Jewish official said.

<HEAD>Killer of Robert Kennedy Denied Parole 13th Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOLEDAD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sirhan B. Sirhan, who shot Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy to death 22 years ago, was denied parole Tuesday for the
13th time.
   After a hearing of more than five hours in Soledad Prison,
Sirhan was told his next parole hearing would be in 1992.
   Commissioner David Brown, one of the three Board of Prison Terms
members, said parole was denied ``because the prisoner committed a
political assassination, which is unique in American history.''
   Brown said another reason for the denial was that the
``underlying cause of the offense and the prisoner's role in the
offense remain unresolved and a longer period of time is needed to
resolve this issue.''
   Brown did not elaborate on that comment and was not available
for questions after the hearing.
   Sirhan, now 46, was convicted of gunning down Kennedy on June 5,
1968, in the pantry of Los Angeles' Ambassador Hotel. Kennedy, who
had just won California's Democratic primary, died early the next
day.
   Sirhan is serving a life term in prison. He was sentenced to
death in 1969, but the sentence was reduced to life imprisonment in
1972 after the state Supreme Court struck down the death penalty.
   The parole board had been petitioned by about 40 prominent
Middle East officials and citizens. They included two Arab members
of Israel's Knesset, the mayor of Bethlehem, members of the Arab
Women's Union and officials of Bir Zeit University.
   Sirhan's lawyer, Luke McKissack, said Monday the petition
suggested that Sirhan's release could speed peace in the Middle
East.
   Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Larry Trapp said he was
surprised at McKissack's move.
   ``It would suggest that Sirhan should have some place in making
political decisions or influencing political decisions,'' Trapp
said.
   The petition said: ``We of Israel and Palestine are concerned
that inmate Sirhan Sirhan be given equal treatment under the law.
It concerns us that ... he is repeatedly denied parole while other
convicted murderers, many more dangerous than he, are released
after serving much less time.''

   Sharp food price increases and rebate
reductions will force nearly a quarter of a million low-income
pregnant women and children from a federal supplemental nutrition
program, according to a survey released Tuesday.
   ``Between March 1990 and September 1990, the end of the current
fiscal year, our survey found that at least 240,000 participants
would no longer be served by the WIC program,'' said Dennis Bach,
president of the National Association of WIC directors.
   Bach said at least 25 states already have begun reducing their
monthly participation in the Special Supplemental Food Program for
Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC.
   The program provides needy women and children with vouchers
redeemable at grocery stores for food, including milk, cheese,
juices and cereals.
   Since May 1989 the Consumer Price Index shows that milk prices
have risen 10.7 percent, cheese costs have climbed 12.7 percent and
fruit juices and frozen fruit prices have risen 13.8 percent.
   Congress has appropriated $2.1 billion for the current fiscal
year. Bach said an additional $72 million was needed to prevent the
reductions.
   The House approved a fiscal 1991 increase of $235 million,
including $85 million to maintain current services and $150 million
for program expansion.
   But Bach said the $150 million ``could be eaten up to maintain
current levels.''
   Only half of those currently eligible are receiving benefits,
according to Bach.
   The Agriculture Department, meanwhile, announced it was
allocating an additional $11 million to 46 states for the WIC
program for the final three months of the fiscal year ending Sept.
30.
   ``Many states have managed their WIC caseloads carefully enough
that they aren't having any budgetary problems,'' said Betty Jo
Nelsen, administrator of the department's Food and Nutrition
Service.
   ``Others have had to economize ... by choosing less expensive
but nutritious foods,'' she said.
   The House Select Committee on Hunger planned a second hearing to
examine program reductions on Wednesday.
   The estimated cutbacks are prompted by an increase in WIC foods
prices that the study said are averaging 7 percent or more in
one-third of the states.
   The Department of Agriculture's food and nutrition service,
which runs the program, had estimated only a 4.5 percent food price
inflation.
   In a recent status report the USDA said no ``high priority''
pregnant or breastfeeding women or infants were being removed from
the program as of March.
   The government report, however, acknowledged ``some states will
experience declines'' but said as many as 20 states would maintain
or increase participation levels by the end of the fiscal year.
   The states hardest hit in the cutbacks include California, New
York, Texas and Florida.

   Congressional investigators reported Tuesday
that the fate of the endangered Mount Graham red squirrel has
become precarious and raised new objections to a planned
observatory on the Arizona mountaintop that is its only home.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, suggested that 1988 legislation authorizing construction
of the $200 million observatory be changed to permit a delay while
new studies are undertaken to weigh the impact of the installation
on the squirrel's chances for survival.
   The forested site of the proposed observatory on Mount Graham in
the Pinaleno mountains 110 miles northeast of Tucson is the
squirrel's only known habitat.
   In testimony before four House environmental subcommittees,
James Duffus III, natural resources director of the General
Accounting Office, sharply questioned the validity of a 1988 study
by the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service which
concluded that building the observatory would not pose an
unacceptable risk to the squirrel.
   Duffus testified that since the wildlife service's biological
report was issued and the act approving the construction of the
observatory was passed, ``the status of the Mount Graham red
squirrel has become more precarious.''
   ``Available data suggest that squirrel numbers have dropped from
about 215 in 1988 to between 132 and 146 in May 1990,'' he said.
   Duffus said that although the exact cause of the population
decline in unknown, biologists consulted by the GAO suggest that
reduction of the red squirrel's source of food, mostly spruce and
fir tree cones, is a major reason.
   ``They contend that removing trees that produce these cones in
order to build the astrophysical facility is not biologically
sound,'' he said.
   The University of Arizona initially sought to build a
seven-telescope facility atop the Emerald and High peaks of the
Mountain.
   Duffus said the eventual Fish and Wildlife report giving a green
light to a compromise bid to build three telescopes was flawed
because it was based on other than biological information and
ignored the concerns of the service's own biologists.
   The wildlife service's regional director decided on his own that
the university's determination to build a ``world-class'' facility
outweighed the risk to the squirrel, an officially endangered
species, Duffus said.
   ``We do not believe that it is appropriate for a Fish and
Wildlife Service official to consider non-biological information in
reaching an opinion that could jeopardize a species's existence,''
the GAO official said. ``We believe ... that biological decisions
should be based on biological information.''
   Sam Marler, director of external affairs for the service, said
later, ``There is nothing only in what the field biologist does,''
and recommendations from those staff members frequently are
modified by more senior biologists before the regional director
makes his decision.
   Marler said he had heard allegations that the decision was
improper, ``But I haven't seen or heard anything that would suggest
it was improper.''
   Allan Beigel, a vice president of the university in Washington
for the hearing, said in a statement issued in Tucson the
university believed the government witnesses had ``saisfactorily
responded'' to the concerns raised by the GAO report.
   University officials will try to allay concerns of members of
the Arizona delegation who believe the observatory should be
reassessed, he said.
   A joint statement from the state's two senators and Reps. Morris
Udall, a Democrat, and John Kyl, a Republican, said, ``Until the
biological opinion is updated, the project should not proceed.''
   Their statement noted the GAO opinion that the government
``would have difficulty'' persuading a court that it had complied
with all the requirements of the Endangered Species Act.
   Duffus said Congress now faces a policy decision.
   On the one hand it can allow construction of the observatory to
continue as planned, he said.
   But he said it can also order the wildlife service to update its
opinion in light of the squirrel's precarious situation and
concerns over the process used to arrive at the original opinion.
   ``This may require additional legislation to hold construction
in abeyance until a new biological opinion is rendered,'' he said.

   Six firefighters battling an erratic
wildfire in intense heat died Tuesday and at least five others were
hospitalized with serious burns, authorities said.
   Four of the injured firefighters were prison inmates who were
among the 1,000 people battling a blaze on a mountain ridge about
90 miles northeast of Phoenix.
   Officials did not know the full circumstances of the six deaths,
said Tonto National Forest spokesman Bob Celaya.
   The fire was sparked by lightning Monday, but the wind Tuesday
began pushing the 1,900-acre fire past firelines on the Mogollon
Rim, he said.
   The temperature Tuesday was at least 106 in Payson, 12 miles
southwest of the fire.
   The injured inmates were part of a group of 18 or 19 prisoners
and two officials the Perryville state prison assigned to help
fight the fire, said Corrections Department spokesman Mike Arra.
   The four injured inmates and the other injured firefighter were
taken to the burn unit of the Maricopa Medical Center in Phoenix.
   ``We are getting some in and we don't have them all yet,'' said
nursing supervisor Donna Heitman. ``We are almost in the process of
preparing for a disaster.''

   Record heat threatened crops, forced a desert
water district to issue restrictions and sent hundreds of thousands
of Southern Californians fleeing to beaches Tuesday as temperatures
pushed past well into the 100s.
   The 112-degree high at the Los Angeles Civic Center was an
all-time record for downtown, beating the previous record high of
110 degrees set on Sept. 4, 1988.
   Other areas that reached three digits were Woodland Hills with
112, Pacoima with 114, Ontario with 112, San Bernardino with 111,
San Gabriel with 111, and Santa Barbara with 103.
   The deserts were even hotter. Palm Springs and Thermal recorded
highs of 120, while Needles had a high of 119.
   The second day of high heat put firefighters on alert as brush
already dry after four years of drought sat on hillsides shimmering
in heat that dropped humidity below 10 percent.
   At least one brush fire was reported in the Sunland area
northeast of downtown.
   The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for inland
orchards and vineyards in San Diego County, and growers said berry
crops would be damaged immediately and some fruits could be lost if
the heat continues.
   ``This is going to finish up the strawberries,'' said Ben
Hillbrecht, a grower with about 200 acres near Escondido. ``And the
boysenberries will cook right on the vine. We won't have any this
year.'' He said the heat also will stop raspberry bushes from
producing for about one month.
   Avocados have just appeared as tiny green buds, and Hillbrecht
said if they don't get enough moisture, they may fall off.
   ``There are certainly some crops that are threatened, though at
this moment we have seen no damage,'' said grower Jim Bathgate of
Valley Center.
   He said fruits such as apricots and peaches still on the tree
could be affected if the heat wave continues a few days, as the
weather service has predicted.
   ``It won't help the water shortage, because everyone turns on
their water to keep things as wet as they can,'' said Hillbrecht.
   In the Mojave Desert, the small Hi-Desert Water District in
Yucca Valley announced use restrictions to begin Wednesday after
the rural water company noticed an average six-to-seven foot drop
in its wells. One well dropped 20 feet over the past six weeks.
   Irrigation will be limited to one day a week, and filling pools
and washing cars at homes will be banned, along with water use for
construction such as mixing concrete, Puffer said. The district
serves about 5,200 customers.
   Not everybody was having a hard time with the heat wave.
   At Raging Waters, a 1.5-million-gallon water playground in San
Dimas, Calif., business was also brisk, said spokeswoman Lynne
Matallana.
   ``We love the hot weather. It encourages people to come out and
visit us,'' she said.
   Hundreds of thousands of people headed to beaches, where
temperatures were more than 20 degrees cooler than inland.
Lifeguards reported nearly 100,000 at Santa Monica, 150,000 at
Hermosa Beach and 40,000 at Zuma Beach in Los Angeles County.

   Nelson Mandela urged Congress Tuesday to
supplement economic sanctions against South Africa with ``material
resources'' to hasten the end of white-minority rule. ``Our people
demand democracy,'' the celebrated black leader said.
   Mandela made an impassioned plea for justice in his historic
address to a joint session of Congress, comparing the struggle of
South African blacks with that of America's founding fathers.
   The one-time prisoner was accorded the kind of reception from
Congress normally reserved for U.S. presidents. His entrance was
greeted with a 2{-minute ovation and there was even longer applause
from the packed House chamber when he finished.
   ``Our people demand democracy. Our country, which continues to
bleed and suffocate, needs democracy,'' he said.
   At an evening rally attended by more than 19,000 people in the
city's Convention Center, Mandela again called for the United
States to maintain its economic sanctions against his country, but
he also called for financial assistance to the nation once the
apartheid system is abolished.
   ``New investment will play a key role in this respect,'' he told
an often cheering crowd of thousands.
   ``We need to mobilize the country for peace,'' Mandela said.
``We need to train personnel for economic recovery. ... For all
this we shall continue to rely on your firm support.''
   Mandela said he had been encouraged by his trip to the United
States.
   ``The masses of the American people are with us, both Congress
(the House) and the Senate are with us; surely apartheid must go,''
he said.
   Mandela's tardiness of more than an hour prevented him from
speaking at a private $1,000-per-person reception before the rally,
and he apologized for that in his speech. He said the unspecified
amount raised would be devoted to ``the struggling masses of South
Africa.''
   Mandela was introduced by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who apologized
for U.S. complicity in his arrest by the South African government
27 years ago.
   ``Our CIA was a factor in your arrest,'' Jackson said. ``We are
ashamed of that.''
   Mandela spent most of the day in private talks with lawmakers.
   In his speech Congress, Mandela appealed to the senators and
House members to let the ``people of South Africa'' _ not the U.S.
government _ be the ones to judge when the sanctions imposed by
Congress four years ago should be lifted.
   Standing before the assembled lawmakers, Cabinet members and
foreign ambassadors, Mandela skirted the controversial issues that
have arisen since he began his U.S. tour last Wednesday. He made no
reference to his support for anti-American radicals, such as
Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, and did not reiterate directly his view
that violence is a useful tool in the anti-apartheid struggle.
   He was at pains, however, to praise American founding fathers,
such as George Washington, who resorted to armed confrontation in
the American war of independence. He compared the struggle of South
African blacks to that two-century-old struggle.
   And he pointedly referred to Pretoria's armed tyranny of the
black majority.
   ``We would be fools to believe that the road ahead of us is
without major hurdles. Too many among our white compatriots are
slaves in the ideology of racism to admit easily that change must
come,'' he said. ``For those who care to worry about violence in
our country as we do, it is at these forces that they should focus
their attention.''
   In an apparent response to concerns about Marxist influence
within his African National Congress, Mandela praised private
industry as an ``engine of growth and development'' and said ``the
ANC holds no ideological positions which dictate that it must adopt
a policy of nationalization.'' But he left open the possibility of
a dominant state role in the economy when he said priority
attention must be given to meeting the material needs of the people.
   After thanking the Congress for imposing the sanctions that have
crippled South Africa's economy, Mandela said, ``We request that
you go further and assist us with material resources which will
enable us to promote the peace process and meet other needs which
arise from the changing situation you helped bring about.''
   He was not specific about the type of assistance the ANC is
seeking. Congress has approved $10 million in aid for South Africa,
which is to be used for promotion of democracy in that country.
Officials have said the ANC would be entitled to a portion of these
funds if it renounces violence. They would be channeled through the
National Endowment for Democracy, which seeks to promote the
consolidation of democracy worldwide.
   The lifting of the sanctions is expected to be an issue of
heated debate, and Mandela appealed to the lawmakers to leave the
decision to South Africans.
   ``We plead that you cede the prerogative to the people of South
Africa to determine the moment when it will be said that profound
changes have occurred and an irreversible process achieved,
enabling you and the rest of the international community to lift
sanctions,'' he said.
   Administration officials have said they would, consistent with
legislative requirements, consult with Congress on lifting the
sanctions once the State of Emergency is suspended in Natal
Province and all political prisoners are released. Mandela
estimates the total at 1,000.
   In addressing the Congress, Mandela was virtually guaranteed a
friendly audience. It was the Congress, four years ago, which
overrode President Reagan's veto and imposed a ban on new
investments in South Africa as well as trade and travel
restrictions as part of a broader sanctions program.
   The only other private citizens who have addressed a joint
meeting were Solidarity leader Lech Walesa of Poland last year and
the Marquis de Lafayette in 1824.
   While acknowledging that the struggle is not yet over, Mandela
seemed confident of eventual victory, discussing his vision of a
post-apartheid South Arica.
   At times, the 71-year-old leader used soaring rhetoric to make
his points. He said that South African society, ``which has known
nothing but racism for three centuries, should be transformed into
an oasis of good race relations, where the black shall to the white
be sister and brother, a fellow South African, an equal human
being, both citizens of the world.
   ``To destory racism in the world, we, together, must expunge
apartheid racism in South Arica. Justice and liberty must be our
tool, prosperity and happiness our weapon.''

<HEAD>Environmentalists Cautiously Applaud Bush Oil Drilling Moratorium</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Offshore Oil, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Environmentalists and lawmakers applauded President Bush's
decision Tuesday to ban much offshore oil drilling for at least a
decade, but some complained the move was politically motivated and
didn't go far enough.
   Bush blocked new drilling off much of the West Coast, Florida
and New England until at least the year 2000. He ordered further
environmental studies to determine if drilling leases might be
offered after that.
   ``We'll take a half a loaf because it's better than none,'' said
Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla.. ``A 10-year moratorium is better than
fighting for a moratorium every year.''
   ``I view this as a major victory for environmentalists and
coastal advocates. We have won time, up to 10 years,'' said
California Assemblyman Tom Hayden, a Democrat. ``So I'm thankful
for the actions in Washington, whatever the motives are.''
   Some environmentalists said Bush acted to help Republican
candidates in California and Florida concerned about possible
negative voter reaction to new drilling in a year that has seen
many news stories on oil spills.
   ``The President's decision to delay leasing and development for
10 years off most of California's coast is an important concession
to the political reality, but it merely postpones the controversy
instead of solving it,'' said Ann Notthoff of the Natural Resources
Defense Council of San Francisco.
   Notthoff also warned that a provision in Bush's order that would
lift the moratorium if oil supply is disrupted is ``a loophole big
enough to drive a truck through.''
   Bush suspended until at least the year 2000 any new leases to
oil companies for drilling off the coast of nearly all of
California. He permanently banned drilling in a marine sanctuary in
Monterey Bay.
   The moratorium also applies to the waters off Washington and
Oregon, 14 million acres off South Florida and 12.8 million acres
of Georges Bank off Cape Cod.
   Bush directed Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan to begin talks
with Florida officials on a federal-state buyback of 73 leases that
oil companies already had bought for drilling off Florida. That
rankled some Florida officials, who estimated the buyback could
cost $100 million to $200 million.
   ``The people of Florida should not be asked to bear what is
rightly a federal responsibility,'' said Gov. Bob Martinez, who
otherwise called Bush's moratorium ``a major victory.''
   Ann Whitfield, spokeswoman for the Florida Public Interest
Research Group, also complained that Bush did not ban drilling in
the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``We look at it as winning a battle, but not winning the war,''
she said.
   In Oregon, Republican Congressman Denny Smith called Bush's
action a ``sound decision.''
   ``I believe that drilling for oil would put Oregon's coastal
wildlife habitat, rich fishing runs and growing tourism industry at
risk in exchange for a few days worth of energy,'' said Smith.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., said, ``While I would have preferred
an outright ban on any leasing off our coast, a 10-year breathing
space will be welcome.''
   New England lawmakers have been fighting drilling on the
prolific Georges Bank fishing ground since it first was proposed
early in the Reagan administration.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said the Bush decision represented a
``shift _ and a welcome one'' in Reagan-Bush policy.
   ``Anybody who knows or cares about Georges Bank should be
delighted,'' said Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass. ``He's not even going
to be president by the year 2000. He's done all that he can for
Georges Bank on his watch.''
   Oil companies acknowledged public worry over oil drilling.
   ``President Bush has recognized that most Americans are not
prepared at this time to develop certain environmentally sensitive
offshore areas,'' Los Angeles-based ARCO said in a statemen.
   ``ARCO supports the president under these circumstances.''
   Chevron Oil Co. said initial reports of Bush's decision
indicated ``the president's actions seem to go too far.''
   ``But we certainly realize there is great concern by the
American public over this issue,'' the company said in a statement
in San Francisco.
   ``We're anxious to see the various parties to the offshore
development controversy work together to find long-term solutions
that will satisfy both the need for a sound U.S. energy policy and
for protection of the environment,'' the company said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush would be authorized to cut
debts to the U.S. government by Latin American countries under a
provision approved Tuesday by the House Banking Committee.
   There was no record vote. Two Republicans, Stan Parris of
Virginia and Marge Roukema of New Jersey, said they disapproved.
   But another Republican, Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, joined Democrats
Joseph Kennedy of Massachusetts and Esteban Edward Torres of
California in sponsoring the proposal.
   A subcommittee last Wednesday voted to authorize the president
to reduce the debts of African and East European countries. The
United States and other creditor governments have already reduced
some African debt.
   Tuesday's vote added Latin American countries to the proposal if
their debt and the interest they pay on it are large enough to meet
a series of requirements that show the debt to be particularly
heavy.
   It asked the Bush administration to urge other governments also
to negotiate reductions of debts owed to them. There has been
particular pressure to reduce the debt of Poland, much of which is
owed to West Germany and France. The Bush administration has so far
opposed reductions in Europe.
   Leach made it plain that he does not intend the bill to apply to
debts owed to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund,
which are jointly owned by 152 governments.

   Air conditioners whined. Swimming pools beckoned.
But there was no getting around it _ it was hot here Tuesday, 122
degrees worth of hot, hot enough to ground planes. It was the
hottest day on record in America's hottest big city.
   A heat wave that stretched from the Southern California coast to
the heart of Texas reached its sweltering peak in Phoenix, which
set an all-time record of 120 degrees on Monday and promptly broke
it a day later.
   At 2:47 p.m. it was 122, and many of the airlines at Sky Harbor
International Airport began canceling takeoffs, said airport
spokesman Rick Martinez.
   The National Weather Service advised the metropolitan area's 2.1
million residents to stay indoors, carry plenty of water when
driving and not leave pets or children inside parked cars.
   Six firefighters died and five others _ including four men from
a prison workcrew _ were seriously burned fighting a 1,900-acre
fire in Tonto National Forest, about 90 miles northeast of Phoenix,
forest spokeswoman Joyce Hassell said.
   The temperature Tuesday topped 106 in Payson, 12 miles southwest
of the fire area. It wasn't known immediately what role the heat
might have played in the tragedy.
   Spot checks at Sky Harbor indicated most airlines were resuming
flights later Tuesday afternoon, as temperatures dropped below 120.
American Airlines canceled all its afternoon flights in an out of
Phoenix, officials at the company's offices here said.
   It was the first time planes had been grounded because of heat
in the history of Sky Harbor, the world's 20th busiest airport,
Martinez said.
   The heat had reduced lift to the point that planes had no margin
for error trying to get airborne, he said. Some landings also were
rerouted to other airlines, Martinez said.
   ``Temperature is really critical on takeoff,'' Martinez said.
``People are staying in the gates, waiting for the temperature to
go down.''
   ``It is what we consider a severe weather condition, not unlike
your northern California fog conditions or similar weather
conditions,'' said America West Airlines spokesman Dick Shimizu.
America West canceled its takeoffs at 3:30 p.m.; they resumed at
4:20 p.m., airline officials said.
   Airlines with Boeing aircraft have contacted the Seattle company
to get information on engine specifications and takeoffs at higher
temperatures, Martinez said.
   Phoenix natives pride themselves on their resistance to heat,
but out-of-towners were shocked by the scorching weather. Emery
Jones of Castledale, Utah, drove into town with his wife, Suzanne,
in an air-conditioned car. When they stepped out, he said, ``it
took our breath away.''
   Monday's high of 120 broke the old record of 118 degrees that
had been set on four occasions, the last time on July 4, 1989.
   Tuesday morning's low of 91 degrees also set a record for the
date and was close to the 93-degree reading of July 20, 1989, which
was the highest low temperature ever recorded here.
   Weather service meteorologist Craig Ellis said the high
temperatures were caused by a strong high-pressure area in the
upper atmosphere and the sun beating almost directly down on the
Earth.
   He predicted the temperature would peak Tuesday or Wednesday
before cooling off to around 113 degrees.
   In Tucson, which is about 1,200 feet higher, the temperature hit
an all-time record of 115 degrees by 1 p.m. Tuesday. Arizona's
second-largest city had a high of 113 Monday and had never gone
higher than 114 degrees.
   The state didn't swelter alone.
   An all-time high of 112 was set in downtown Los Angeles, where
the previous record high of 110 degrees was set Sept. 4, 1988.
   Borrego Springs, Calif., in the Anza-Borrego Desert had Monday's
nationwide high of 122 degrees, and the weather service reported
temperatures above 110 degrees in low deserts from the coastal
mountains eastward to New Mexico.
   At Death Valley National Monument in eastern California, park
Ranger Karen Rosga said she advised people to drink a lot of liquid
and slow down. The temperature hit 120 degrees Monday and was
expected to top out at 121 Tuesday. The weather sevice issued a
heat advisory for much of north-central Texas. Lubbock in west
Texas hit an all-time high of 110 degrees Sunday, according to
weather service forecaster Loren Phillips.
   Some businesses rejoiced in the extreme heat.
   ``These will be record-beaking days for our stores, believe
me,'' said Marilyn Novak, marketing director for Baskin-Robbins ice
cream stores based in Glendale, Calif.
   Business also was brisk at Raging Waters, a 1{ million-gallon
water playground in San Dimas, Calif. ``We love the hot weather. It
encourages people to come out and visit us,'' Raging Waters
spokeswoman Lynne Matallana said.
   Several people passed out from heat exhaustion Monday at the
South Rim of the Grand Canyon, spokeswoman Maureen Oltrogge said.
Although temperatures on the rim reached only 92, it was 110
degrees deeper in the canyon, she said.
   The Salt River Project, one of the two major utilities for the
Phoenix area, appealed to the public to conserve energy by setting
thermostats 2 to 3 degrees higher and to not run appliances during
peak hours of the day.
   The Arizona Automobile Association's main office in Phoenix took
at least 1,500 calls, about 500 or 600 more than usual, said Frank
Kuczora, shift supervisor of the road service department. Many were
from motorists whose vehicles overheated or had dead batteries, he
said.
   Ellis, the weather service forecaster, said he believed the heat
lent credence to theories of global warming.
   However, Robert Gall, a professor in the University of Arizona's
atmospheric sciences department, attributed the extreme
temperatures to the atmosphere's natural variability.
   ``I don't think it represents a long-term trend,'' he said. If
the extreme heat is related to greenhouse warming, ``there is no
way of proving it,'' he said.
   ``This kind of anomaly, warm temperatures, could be naturally
occurring,'' Gall said. ``There is variation all the time ... I
would say that if the dice were rolled, it just came up hot.''

   President Bush on Tuesday blocked new oil
drilling off the coasts of much of California, Florida, Washington,
Oregon and New England until the year 2000.
   In addition, he permanently blocked any drilling in a proposed
marine sanctuary in California's Monterey Bay, and ordered a
moratorium on new leases until 1996 for one section off southern
California where drilling already is under way.
   ``My desire is to achieve a balance between the need to provide
energy for the American people and the need to protect unique and
sensitive coastal and marine environments,'' Bush said in a written
statement announcing his long-pending decision.
   The president called for more environmental studies to settle
the question of whether leases might be offered after 2000.

   The farm where Lawrence Welk learned to
play the accordion became center stage Tuesday for a project to
create a museum honoring the king of champagne music.
   Gov. George Sinner and other state officials were expected to
attend the groundbreaking ceremony at the farm where Welk lived
until he was 21. The bandleader himself, now 87 and living in Los
Angeles, did not attend but sent a letter of thanks.
   ``Little did I dream when I was growing up on the farm so many,
many years ago that someday it would be restored and people would
come and marvel at how life was lived in the early 1920s,'' Welk
wrote.
   ``Looking back, I would say that life on the farm was very hard
and I didn't always like it _ especially when I had to help butcher
the hogs. But they were really happy days, too, because there was
always love.''

   So many books in the world. So what shall we read?
   Three British bookmen and 15 collaborators have produced a list
of 2,500 books they consider are the best in the English language.
   ``That's a lot of titles, but if you start young enough, we
think you could get through it. You could read a book a week if you
wanted to,'' said Brian Last, one of the three editors of ``An
English Library'' from Gower Publishing Co.
   Their book contains 15 categories of books, from fiction to
reference, and cites 11 books of the Bible in the Old Testament and
seven in the New Testament.
   Charles Dickens' novels and William Shakespeare's plays mingle
with the poems of the present poet laureate of England, Ted Hughes,
and modern American novels such as Ken Kesey's ``One Flew over the
Cuckoo's Nest.''
   The new book is based on ``An English Library'' by the late
Frank Seymour Smith, a librarian whose choice ran to more than
5,000 books in 1963, none of them by a living author.
   ``Our changes take account of more modern tastes,'' said Last in
an interview. ``We wanted to remodel Smith, put in contemporary
writers and add new sections like world literature in English which
takes account of important authors in Australia, Canada, India and
Africa.''
   Last, 39, is managing editor of Scholar Press, a Gower
subsidiary. He and co-editors Nigel Farrow, 50, chairman of Gower,
and Vernon Pratt, a researcher at Lancaster University who is in
his 40s, say they compiled their list with the single aim of
extending people's enjoyment of reading.
   ``We all write, teach or publish books for a living but read
them for enjoyment,'' Farrow said.
   ``At the end of the day there is always the worry that we might
have left out something important but we have done as much
painstaking research as we could,'' Last said. ``We tried to
include everything that is first rate of its kind.''
   Smith put asterisks against his personal choices in what he
called the ``exhilarating wealth of genius in English books.''
   The editors of the new edition have not done the same but at the
request of The Associated Press, Last and Farrow (Pratt was
unavailable) selected their top books in each category. Here they
are, with the original publication dates:

   ``There was some argument over the American novel, and `Gatsby'
was challenged by `Huckleberry Finn' (Mark Twain),'' said Last.
   ``There was a problem with the poetry as we felt that (Geoffrey)
Chaucer, (Philip) Larkin, (Thomas) Hardy and (Andrew) Marvell had a
right to the top spot but we agreed that Yeats had the edge.
   ``It was enormously difficult to choose a play of Shakespeare as
all his plays should really be there, and on another day we might
have picked `Othello.'''
   The editors' final advice: ``If you don't like something, don't
plow through it. Reading isn't competition, it's enjoyment. The
classic you don't like is in our book because it is a classic.''
   ``An English Library'' costs $25.50. It is available in the
United States from Barbara Church at Gower Publishing, Old Post
Road, Brookfield, Vt. 05036.

<TEXT>
   In spite of the imperfections, Americans
generally tolerate their systems of governance and banking, calming
their occasional outrage by considering the alternatives.
   Those alternatives generally are worse than what already exists,
defects and all, but sometimes it is hard to accept that verdict.
The systems are forever being tested and so, therefore, is the
patience of Americans.
   The latest outrage is expressed by representatives of 37 states
and the District of Columbia who will see a net transfer of wealth
from their economies to those with the biggest savings and loan
collapses.
   In the abstract, the outrage is muted. This is one great
country, it is reasoned, and if the worst of the collapses were
concentrated in just 13 states it is still a national issue to be
dealt with by all the people.
   It is when the numbers, the specific dollar amounts, are
detailed and then broadast, as they are now, that the muted outrage
is expressed in a great roar. This happens, for instance, when
residents in certain states stand to lose $1,000 each.
   It is then that acceptance breaks down and questions and threats
begin. Why, asks Connecticut, should our people lose $1,000 each to
send money to Texans, who will benefit by several times that amount?
   Why should areas of the country whose savings and loan
associations played by the rules and kept their institutions
solvent have to ship money to those areas in which S&amp;Ls squandered
their funds on foolish investment schemes?
   Alas, that is the way the system works, a system that appears to
be filled with injustices but which, experience suggests, is still
second to none. Yes, outrages abound.
   In the 1970s, you may recall, the nation humiliated its savers,
the salt-of-the-earth types who played by the rules, who lived
within their limits and tried to put a few dollars in the bank for
a rainy day.
   For whatever reasons _ it might have been fiscal and monetary
stupidity _ the money ``saved'' in the bank was thrown away.
Perhaps stolen would better describe what happened to it.
   Because inflation raged, and because banks paid out in interest
far less than was taken away by inflation, the buying power of
savers deteriorated every day.
   Meanwhile, those who borrowed and bought goods with the money of
savers enjoyed tremendous appreciation in value. They enjoyed the
good life with the money, took tax deductions and repaid the savers
with cheaper dollars.
   The examples are myriad, and they exist right now.
   _The young couple who postponed buying a house for the past
decade, just waiting for prices to stabilize.
   Now that they have the money to buy, some lenders who had been
throwing money around are stiffening their terms because they made
so many bad loans in the past.
   _The small-business person who took the slow but sure and steady
course, who proved his financial reliability by foregoing the
wildly expansive course taken by his competitor.
   Now his credit line is shrinking because the bank made so many
bad loans, such as to his competitor, that it has decided to assume
a more conservative lending policy.
   _The young worker who is paying increasingly higher
contributions to the Social Security system, not simply to finance
his own retirement but to make possible the retirements of the
generation before.
   Anyone can cite specific personal examples, especially when
insurance or taxes are involved. They can rage against the
injustice, threaten legal action, demand reform. But then, somehow,
they learn to live with it.
   It may not be fair but it is the system, a very imperfect one,
always in need of fixing.

<HEAD>Henry Mancini's Childhood: July 4th No Big Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Henry Mancini was a kid in the steel town
of Aliquippa, Pa., the Fourth of July wasn't that big a deal. He
recalls no big parades, no rockets' red glare, no Sousa marches.
   However, he notes,``I grew up in an almost 100 percent Italian
neighborhood'' where patriotism was alive and well, but the big
events were the August ``festas,'' parties celebrating the Feast of
St. Anthony and the like.
   Next Wednesday, though, he'll be part of a big July 4 deal on
PBS _ a 90-minute musical celebration, ``A Capitol Fourth 1990.''
Hosted by Beverly Sills and broadcast live from Washington, it'll
start at 8 p.m. EDT.
   Mancini will be the guest conductor of the National Symphony
Orchestra on the show, the third time in 10 years he's done that.
   It's a little different from his usual work, which is writing
scores for films _ he's done more than 80 _ or collecting Oscars
for his music. Nominated 18 times, he owns four Oscars, which go
nicely with his 20 Grammy awards.
   A flutist and pianist, Mancini, now 66, began writing music
arrangements when he was 14. He was inspired three years earlier
when his father took him to Pittsburgh to see ``The Crusades,'' a
Cecil B. DeMille extravaganza.
   ``That was the first score that I ever heard with a large
orchestra,'' he says. ``And that's what kind of stuck in my head in
all those early years. I always had that'' _ writing for film _
``in the back of my mind.''
   His first Hollywood effort, in the early '50s, was for a scene
in an Abbott and Costello epic, ``Lost in Alaska.'' He had studied
composition, theory and harmony and all that, and arranged for big
bands.
   But nobody taught him to write for films. That small omission
from his education didn't bother him, he says: ``You had no choice.
But then, I didn't want any choice. I just wanted to work.''
   Such on-the-job training can be dicey. Film music has to convey
the moment and be precisely timed, right down to the nanosecond.
This may lead some to think of a Hollywood composer as an ulcer
with a stopwatch.
   But it would do no good for the rousing chase music of one scene
to keep going into the next scene's seduction attempt, at least in
most cases.
   Mancini insists that such problems are small.
   Sure, he says, ``you make mistakes in your timing, and all of a
sudden you've got 10 bars too many because you skipped some time,
or you don't have enough. But you go in and fix it.''
   Such errors usually are caught before the musicians go to work
in the soundstage, he adds. He didn't say what happens if the error
isn't caught. But when was the last time you saw a seduction scene
with chase music?
   Mancini's musical dossier includes such evergreens as ``Moon
River,'' ``Days of Wine and Roses'' and ``Two for the Road.''
   But his jazzy score for TV's ``Peter Gunn'' series of 1958-61 is
the one that first gained him national attention, with its use of
jazz improvisation and such rarely heard instruments as bass and
alto flutes.
   Hollywood being Hollywood, ``Gunn'' music touched off several TV
imitators, including ``Shotgun Slade'' _ the only Western ever to
have a jazz score.
   Mancini's film scores, which include ``Breakfast at Tiffany's,''
``10,'' and Bill Cosby's new ``Ghost Dad,'' generally seem to use
the whole range of instruments and have a rich, natural,
non-synthesized sound.
   It may therefore sadden foes of computer music to learn that
Mancini, the graduate of big bands, uses synthesizers.
   ``I've been using them almost since the first time they came
out, in one way or another,'' he says. ``They get interesting
sounds, and they get better and better. I use them in conjunction
with an acoustic orchestra.''
   Heresy? No, says the composer: ``I just think they give you a
much bigger palette to work from.''

<HEAD>Inside Dope on a Statistical Fluke</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While statistics have a chiseled exactness
suggesting hard truth, savvy members of this information age know
it isn't always so, whether the subject is real estate, insurance
or economics.
   They recognize, for example, that numbers may be even more
misleading than words, and subject to manipulation, twists and
torture in a manner beyond what such mere linguists as Shakespeare
could do with words.
   Sometimes the intent can be to deceive, sometimes not. Often the
numbers are clear to the eye and equally so to the mind, but the
mind chooses to be deceived. Sometimes, just a bit of probing
reveals the truth.
   As in this example:
   Since the mid-1980s, sections of the country have had depressed
housing markets, marked by repeated lowering of asking prices and
prolonged periods between listings and sales.
   At the same time, the popular statistics on housing sales may
continue to indicate price increases. Your own observations tell
you that many prices are lower. The statistics continue to show
price increases.
   Is it you, or is it the statistics?
   There are a couple of elements in the explanation, the first
being that asking prices are indeed being cut, but sometimes the
cuts only bring the selling price back to where it was a couple of
years before.
   Those high asking prices are understandable, at least in terms
of human behavior. Only reluctantly do sellers adjust to newer
market forces. They live a bit in the past and they ask for the
extreme prices of the past.
   Even when they do adjust to the new reality, some selling prices
remain higher than they were several years before, or even one year
before _ in spite of the cuts. But that's only one part of the
explanation.
   Glenn Crellin of the National Association of Realtors explains:
   A slow market means there are fewer ready, willing and able
buyers in the market, but those who do remain active want both a
good home and a good deal. Quite often, the better deal is in the
larger home.
   Larger homes cost more, of course, but the buyer who is active
in a slow market is often highly motivated, a real buyer rather
than a looker.
   ``It's human nature,'' says Crellin. ``If they can afford the
larger home, most families will opt to spend a few extra dollars
now to get closer to their dream house rather than save a little
and be dissatisfied.''
   To illustrate: The median-priced, two-bedroom home in Boston was
$200 less in the first quarter of 1990 than it was in 1989; the
median-priced three-bedroom home was $2,200 less; the median-priced
larger home was $200 less.
   However, the median of all homes sold in the Boston metropolitan
area was $1,000 more. The reason: The composition of home sales
changed. The market share held by four-bedroom homes soared to 39
percent from 34.6 percent.
   As a result, the median-priced home in metropolitan Boston rose,
while actual prices in all categories fell.
   Ultimately, says Crellin, ``this means that users of statistics
must periodically review what the statistics measure.''
   How true, whether you're reading about economic numbers in the
newspaper, listening to a life insurance salesman extol the merits
of a policy, or trying to get a measure of the housing market.

   Get ready for a plateful of soul _ more hot
sounds from ``Hot-lanta.''
   Atlanta in the 1990s is emerging as the new center for rhythm
and blues, just as Detroit did in the '60s with Motown.
   Recording artists are flocking to the South's capital from New
York and Los Angeles, drawn by a cheaper real estate market and
more privacy.
   ``Atlanta was one of the country's best-kept secrets,'' said Tom
Wright, owner of Cheshire Sound Studios, where singers such as
Peabo Bryson and Bobby Brown come to record. ``Not anymore.''
   Bryson was new in the music business and Atlanta seemed like a
good place to start. So when the relatively unknown Bang records
offered him a contract, he snapped it up. Nineteen years later,
he's still here, after raising a family and building a prosperous
career.
   ``Atlanta was not a throbbing metropolis full of opportunity in
the recording industry, but it was also not a New York City _ all
crowded,'' Bryson said in an interview.
   ``I wanted to develop my writing style here, learn to make
recordings. Now the producers are here, the equipment is here. I'm
glad I stayed.''
   Bryson was joined last year by Brown, the former New Edition
member whose multiplatinum album, ``Don't Be Cruel,'' sold 5
million copies.
   Brown bought a downtown building, which he is calling Bosstown,
to convert to a recording and pre-production studio.
   Arista producers Antonio ``LA'' Reid and Kenny ``Babyface''
Edmonds, responsible for No. 1 hits by Brown, Reid's wife, Pebbles,
and Paula Abdul, opened their own label, LaFace Records. They have
an office in suburban Norcross and plan a nearby studio to handle
at least eight projects a year _ including Whitney Houston's new
album.
   ``It's a place we felt we could raise a family and live normal
lives,'' Edmonds said.
   Producer Dean ``Sir'' Gant of Platinum Plus Productions, who has
worked with Anita Baker, George Howard and Madonna, also has opened
shop in Atlanta. Others who've been lured here include the vocal
group After 7, and Matt ``Atlanta'' Bliss, trumpeter for Prince.
   ``Unless you're somebody everybody really knows like Bobby
Brown, you're safe here,'' Bliss said. ``People here aren't used to
looking for stars on the street. In L.A., yeah, that's all it is.''
   Bryson is a visible celebrity in Atlanta. He's frequently
spotted walking around town and says he enjoys the city's most
popular and crowded nightclubs _ Petrus and Ruperts. He's also an
avid patron of the region's first comedy club catering to black
acts, the Comedy Act Theatre.
   ``Although anonymity is not readily afforded, here people are
very calm,'' he said. ``They'll walk up to you but they don't
necessarily have to bother you. You won't get your clothes torn off
here. It has a lot to do with Southern hospitality. Our attitude is
basically different.''
   Georgia isn't new to the music scene. The industry has been
building since James Brown formed his band in Toccoa about 30 years
ago. Progressive rockers REM, the Georgia Satellites and the Indigo
Girls all started here.
   But the newcomers are primarily R&amp;B artists and their producers.
With the producers comes Atlanta's chance at becoming a major
recording market, just as Detroit once was, and other cities as
well: Memphis, in the '60s with Stax Records; Muscle Shoals in the
'60s with Aretha Franklin; Chicago in the '60s with Curtis Mayfield
and Jerry Butler; Philadelphia in the '70s with the O'Jays and
Spinners; and Minneapolis in the '80s with Prince and Jimmy Jam
Productions.
   Bryson said the producers' presence means it's no longer
necessary for artists to fly to New York and Los Angeles for
recording sessions. Production costs are relatively equal in every
city, he added, and the latest technology has come to Atlanta's
studios.
   ``There's a producers' network now ... unheralded and unspoken,
but it's here,'' Bryson said. ``And Cheshire studio is the place to
be. We hang out, exchange ideas.
   ``Atlanta is a very sophisticated place. People can afford to
live here on an opulent level. New York and L.A. _ these are
glorious places where opulence is the order of the day, but they're
not afforded by a whole lot of people.''
   Real estate costs that are significantly lower than New York or
Los Angeles have prompted many artists to move here.
   ``You can get 1,200 square feet, if you're lucky, for a quarter
of a million (dollars) there,'' Bryson said. ``And here, if you're
willing to drive just 20 minutes, you can get five bedrooms with a
circular drive on an acre of land. That's pretty decent.''
   Rent also is often prohibitive for musicians living in New York.
Former Cameo singer Charlie Singleton, now a solo artist, said,
``About $700 here will get you a nice place. That's worth $1,200 or
so there.''
   Gant, working on his third album with Bryson, moved to
Alpharetta to raise his three children, save money and to gain some
privacy.
   ``You'd be out for lunch and the waiter finds out you're a
producer and pops out the demo tape. You don't find that here,'' he
said.
   ``With all the recording here _ and there's a lot of it going on
_ this will be one of the biggest recording places in the world,''
said Bobby Byrd, who played with James Brown for 25 years after
helping the singer start his band in his grandmother's basement in
Toccoa. ``I think two years and we'll be big on the map.''
   Byrd just opened his own studio and production facilities _
called Phase One and Byrd's Nest Productions _ to work with Jackson
Records.
   Bliss, who moved to Marietta from Minneapolis, said Atlanta will
define the '90s as a decade of musical variety _ from a mellow
Bryson to the more pop sounds of Singleton.
   The influx of artists has meant big business to the city's
recording studios. Cheshire studios were booked solid last year,
with 1989 the best of Wright's 20 years recording.
   Talent scouts are taking note, too. The owners of two
nightclubs, The Point and The Cotton Club, signed a three-year
contract with Warner-Chappell, the world's largest music
publishers, to scout the area.
   Bobby Brown's ``Live at Sensations'' talent showcase regularly
attracted scouts from Atlantic, Warner Bros., CBS and Arista, until
the club lost its lease this month, said Sensations manager Ed
Rucker.
   While Brown seldom attended the showcase, other stars often
joined the amateurs for impromptu concerts.
   ``Jermaine Jackson and Peabo Bryson were performing one week and
Stevie Wonder walked in,'' Rucker said. ``He upstaged everybody,
just walked on to the stage.''
   Industry insider Bob Patton, former booking manager for James
Brown, said while Atlanta probably won't become the musical ``New
York of the South,'' it can easily surpass Detroit's claim as the
country's soul capital.
   Experts said it's too early to guess just what share of the $6.5
billion recording industry Atlanta has snared. But Bryson said
within three years, 25 percent of the recording will come from
Atlanta.
   ``You can make a great recording anywhere,'' agreed
23-year-resident Rodney Mills, former producer for .38 Special now
working with Singleton. ``But there's something of an advantage
when enough people in the same business are in the same city.''

   Did a terrorist plant a bomb or did a missile go
astray in an aerial dogfight? Was there a bungled investigation or
an international coverup of what caused the mysterious jetliner
crash that killed 81 people?
   Ten years after a DC-9 on a domestic flight blew apart in
twilight skies and fell into the sea near the tiny island of
Ustica, the questions remain unanswered.
   Many theories have been advanced, but little information has
been revealed. A complicating factor is judicial secrecy, which
forbids disclosure until the investigation leads to indictments or
closure of the case.
   In May, an official panel of five experts who said in March 1989
that a missile had struck the plane re-examined the evidence and
split between missile and bomb.
   Premier Giulio Andreotti declared recently: ``The more I read
about it, the less I understand. It's very disturbing, this
interweaving of suspicions and rumors.''
   A week earlier, a state television report claimed authorities
ignored or forgot radar data from a station in Tuscany. The report
interpreted the data as indicating the DC-9, bound for Sicily, was
caught in an engagement between French and Libyan jet fighters, but
gave no proof.
   It joined a multitude of sensational, unsubtantiated theories
that have arisen over the years.
   Some contended a Libyan aircraft with Col. Moammar Gadhafi
aboard was above Sicily shortly before the crash.
   One spoke of Gadhafi's favorite air force pilot chasing a
defector across the skies; in another, U.S. jets fired a missile
that hit the airliner by mistake.
   French, U.S. and NATO officials have denied any military
activity in the skies that night. Gadhafi has blamed the United
States, but offered no evidence.
   Discovery of a crashed Libyan MiG fighter in the Calabrian
mountains, almost due east of where the DC-9 went down, bolstered
claims of a Libyan connection.
   Doctors who performed an autopsy on the pilot first gave the
date of death as July 18, then as late June, then switched back to
the later date.
   Investigators suspect air force officials of manipulating,
hiding or destroying evidence and of lying about what happened that
Friday when, 57 minutes into the flight and without a hint of
trouble, the plane disappeared from radar screens while flying from
Bologna to Palermo.
   The DC-9 of Itavia, a small private carrier, carried 77
passengers, including 11 children and two infants, and a crew of
four. School vacations had begun and many passengers were
businessmen joining their families for the weekend.
   Italy was plagued by terrorism in 1980 and and a bomb first
seemed the likely cause. A few months after the crash, however,
Transport Minister Rino Formica told Parliament a missile was
suspected.
   In 1987, the government yielded to the outcries of relatives and
engaged salvagers, who raised part of the wreckage.
   Evidence studied by several official investigations indicated
the kind of explosive found in corpses and wreckage was used to
make missiles. Examination of the fuselage indicated the aircraft
was struck from the outside, according to news reports.
   Still, investigating commissions have differed. In May 1989, two
months after the commission report that a missile was to blame,
another commission appointed by Ciriaco De Mita, then premier,
decided a bomb could not be ruled out.
   This spring, when two members of the first commmission reversed
themselves and concluded a bomb was responsible, an association of
victim's relatives, joined by some politicians, protested that the
two had ties to a state-owned company involved in making missiles
for the air force.
   After the protest and the television report about the radar
tapes, investigating magistrate Vincenzo Bucarelli announced that
an October deadline to close the case would be lifted.
   ``Every time we got close to the truth, someone pushed us back,
but I think we have finally succeeded in getting politicians'' on
our side, said Daria Bonfietti, who heads the association of
victims' relatives. Her brother, Alberto, was killed in the crash.
   The Ustica mystery has been compared to other unsolved cases in
Italy, including assassinations of Mafia investigators and
terrorist bombings, including one in a Milan bank 21 years ago.
   Corriere della Sera, a leading daily, said in an editorial:
   ``A country without truth. Evidently, around so many Italian
mysteries, there's an invincible force capable of confusing the
ideas of experts, playing with the efforts of the magistrate's
office, mocking the appeals of the head of state. It's this force,
in reality, that struck the Itavia jet, massacring 81 people and
the sense of justice.''

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Among the boarded-up flophouses, art schools and
artists' lofts in Denver's suddenly hip but still seedy lower
downtown is a little tavern with a big metal cactus sign out front
that is known throughout the jazz world as a real jumpin' joint.
   Well it should be, since the literal translation of ``El
Chapultepec'' from the Aztec means ``the hill of grasshoppers.''
   ``It's really like a step back in time,'' said sax player Rich
Chiaraluci, who has played for Mel Torme, Tony Bennett and Nancy
Wilson. `It's kind of a dive. But it reminds me of walking into a
jazz club in about 1945.''
   ``There's never a cover. The music is for the people. When you
have a cover, the music is just for those who can afford it,'' said
Jerry Krantz, the tousle-haired owner-bartender.
   Among the jazz greats who have dropped by to ``stretch out and
blow their brains out'' since Krantz began bringing jazz to El
Chapultepec have been all three Marsalis brothers _ Wynton,
Branford and Darfileo, Woody Herman, the Count Basie Orchestra,
Artie Shaw, Eddie ``Lockjaw'' Davis, sax player Buddy Collette and
tenor sax player Charlie Rouse.
   ``Buddy DeFranco (clarinet player) came to the University of
Denver to do a clinic. He came down and played here. He was the
first of the greats,'' Krantz recalled. ``Pretty soon, everybody in
the country was calling.''
   Guitarist Ozzie Carlson likes the place because people ``go in
to hear some good American jazz. People from the symphony and what
you might say is higher-echelon society come in and not just to go
slumming. They're serious to hear jazz.
   ``I guess just about every well-known jazz musician in the
country would know the name El Chapultepec as a jazz place.''
   The 20-by-40 foot main barroom with the bandstand jammed down at
the west end by the restrooms sometimes becomes so crowded that
Krantz says each patron gets just one of the foot-square black and
white checkerboard floor tiles to stand on _ or less.
   ``The place is no bigger than an RTD bus and it does fill up
just as much as one of 'em at rush hour,'' the former packing house
worker and cab driver said.
   At 5-foot-6 and 180 pounds, the 55-year-old Krantz is built like
a brick, at least ``they say that's what it feels like when I hit
them. But I have very, very little trouble down here. That is the
beautiful part of it.''
   ``Jerry is very nice to the guys,'' says Carlson. ``When it
comes time to pay, there is never any hesitation. He pays right
smack on the spot. There are a lot of joints that aren't
particularly like that.''
   ``When a good musician is scuffling for work, he could go in
there and Jerry would hire him and put him in on the weekends with
the house band to help out the guy. He doesn't have to do that. The
guy seems to care,'' Chiaraluci said.
   Drummer Bruno Carr says the clientele sets ``The Pec'' apart
because ``they come from all walks of life and everybody rubs
elbows ... the rich and the poor and the in between.''
   Carr, who has played for Sarah Vaughn, John Coltrane and Ray
Charles, said for a long time The Pec was ``the only joint in town
that really had any jazz 52 weeks a year.''
   It all began back in 1978 _ 10 years after Krantz bought The Pec
from his father-in-law _ that he changed the club's music format
from Mexican mariachi to jazz.
   ``I went to an after-hours club and got the jazz group to come
down,'' he said. ``The people loved them. I went strictly into jazz
in 1978 _ Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The people wanted more. I
tried a `Blue Monday,' where a jazz band came in and played blues,
beebop, jazz. They just kept packing the place. In 1980, I went
jazz seven nights a week.'' It's been that way ever since.
   The clientele changed. The Hispanic crowd that had supported The
Pec since it opened at the close of prohibition in 1933, began to
give way.
   ``The kids think they found a new music. ... I have doctors,
lawyers, merchants, thieves. ... They all get involved with the
music. All colors, all walks of life. Nobody cares who's alongside
them. Everybody is welcome and everybody is treated equal,
   ``Last night, I had the minister of arts from Poland. He was
here in town doing a study of American ballet. They came to listen
to the music. He said during the war in Poland, jazz represented
freedom to the Polish people because jazz represented the United
States. He startedan underground jazz thing.''
   But the noisy crowds irk longtime jazz fans of The Pec.
   ``I'd been going in there for years before it got hip to go
there,'' said Linda Grunow, who writes for Downbeat and Cadence
magazines and is jazz critic for Denver's Westword alternative
newspaper.
   ``It's a wonderful place ... a smoky old jazz bar. (But) It's
not what it used to be,'' she said. ``The public at large has
discovered it. They think it's hip. You'd better stake out your bar
stool a good two hours before the music starts.''
   There have been other attempts to establish jazz clubs in
Denver. They failed after a few months of thin crowds. New ones on
the scene now include La Cupol, The Jazz Works and the Burnsley
Hotel.
   The Pec is a survivor.
   During its 57-year stand at the corner of Market and 20th
streets, it has seen the city's old ``red light'' district torn
down _ except for Madame Mattie Silks' old ``parlor'' house across
the street. Neighboring Chinatown was torn down for warehouse
construction during World War II. Now the warehouses are falling to
the wrecking ball as developers hope lower downtown is Denver's
next development boom site.
   Through it all, The Pec continues and the jazz goes on.
   ``It has been beyond any imagination how the music got the
attention and satisfaction of the people,'' Krantz said, still awed
by his success. `My era was the jazz-swing music. And all I do is
provide a place for them to play it.''
   Somewhere amid the din of the crowded, hot little joint lies the
magic elixer of success.
   ``When all the other clubs die, El Chapultepec will still be
standing,'' Chiaraluci said. ``If it wasn't for the owner's love of
jazz, it just wouldn't be there.''

   In tiny Bancroft, Maine, they gave an election
and nobody came.
   In Texas, a hot primary campaign for governor drew 15 percent of
the voters.
   In California, about 40 percent went to the polls on primary
day, but that still was close to the record low established in 1986
for the state.
   Midway through the election year, experts are predicting 1990
will bring a continuation of a 30-year downward trend in voter
participation.
   Analysts, politicians and voters interviewed around the country
said voter frustration and disillusionment and the increasing
complexity and stress of life seem to be at least partly to blame.
   ``I don't know anybody who was in a 10-minute traffic jam going
to work 10 years ago who is not in a 45-minute traffic jam going to
work now, and it doesn't matter who gets elected,'' said Curtis
Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate. The private group tracks voter participation.
   In 1960, the year John F. Kennedy was elected president, 62.8
percent of registered voters cast ballots.
   By 1988, when George Bush was elected, turnout had dropped to
50.16 percent.
   In 1986, the most recent non-presidential general election year,
only 37 percent made it to the polls.
   Edward J. Rollins, director of the Republican Congressional
Campaign Committee, recently predicted turnout this year could go
below 30 percent.
   ``I think part of it just has to do with folks just generally
giving up on all of us,'' said Al La Pierre, executive director of
the Democratic party in Alabama. In his state, the turnout of
750,000 voters in the June 5 primary was down by about 200,000 from
1986.
   ``They just don't see any need to go do it any more, which is
sad,'' La Pierre said.
   Toni Grygo, who runs a hair styling parlor in Pittsburgh, said,
``The feedback that I get is that they are disillusioned. This is
the main thing I hear from the women and some of the men that I
do.''
   In Bancroft, a rural community in northern Maine with 61
residents and 35 registered voters, Deputy Town Clerk Mary Irish
said two or three people usually come out to vote in off-year
elections. In presidential years, she said, turnout gets up to 14.
   In the June 12 Maine primary, nobody voted in Bancroft. Voting
statewide appeared low, but final turnout figures had not been
tabulated.
   ``It was a beautiful day and there should have been greater
interest,'' said Keron Kerr, the state Democratic chairman.
   Alan Heslop, professor of government at Claremont McKenna
College in Claremont, Calif., said part of the problem is
population growth. After the 199l redistricting, California is
expected to have legislative districts of 750,000 people, three
times what they were in 1950.
   ``People feel powerless,'' said Heslop. ``It is hard to convince
oneself that one vote is going to make a difference in these
enormous, giant districts.''
   Maybe the vote in Boise County, Idaho, helps make his point. The
sparsely populated county had a turnout of 42.51 percent in Idaho's
May 22 primary, about the same as in 1986 and much higher than
turnout statewide in this year's primary.
   ``I think people vote here because we are so small that we feel
like it really matters,'' said Jan Longpre, city editor of the
weekly Idaho World newspaper in Idaho City. ``Even if it doesn't,
we think it does.''
   Heslop thinks people are turned off by the slick packaging that
is wrapped around today's candidates.
   ``I think a lot of people are tired of the sound-bite approach
to politics, the graphics mailer, the snappy computerized letter,''
he said. ``People are seeing that all of these things are in fact
means of pulling the wool over the voters' eyes.''
   ``That may to a degree be true,'' agrees Alabama Democrat La
Pierre. ``But how else can you reach the masses but through TV?''
   Gans believes negative campaigning is a big part of the problem.
   ``What they want to do with those ads is create doubts about the
character of the opponent and weaken the impulse to vote among weak
partisans and undecideds,'' Gans said. ``When this is reciprocally
done, it has got to weaken the impulse on both sides.''
   Nevertheless, despite a campaign widely criticized as negative,
Virginia voters turned out in record numbers last year to make
Douglas Wilder the nation's first elected black governor.
   ``In certain situations you can transcend the negative campaigns
because the issues are more important,'' Gans said.
   Something else has changed beside campaigns, said Heslop, and
that is the widespread perception among voters that incumbents have
become unbeatable.
   ``It is something new for them to know that there is no way of
throwing the rascals out,'' he said.
   Frank Sullivan, who runs a landscaping business in Cincinnati,
said he votes anyway.
   ``I feel like it's our only revenge,'' Sullivan said. ``I don't
think they pay any attention to us, but we are only making it worse
for ourselves if we don't let them know we are out here.''

<HEAD>Freely Elected Town Council Finds Empty Treasury</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>

   Poland held municipal elections May 27 to create
independent local governments free of Communist Party control. Here
is an account of problems one town encountered as its new council
began restoring democratic rule.

   Marek Lach knew the treasury was
empty when he won a council seat, but another truth awaited him:
The mayor had bought cars for himself and four other people with
the town's money.
   Mayor Zbigniew Jarzebski, a Communist Party holdover, walked out
June 12 when Lach began reading a report about the cars at the
second meeting of the new, freely elected council in Podkowa Lesna,
16 miles west of Warsaw.
   Lach's voice rose as he described how, six months earlier,
Jarzebski approved the purchase of cars for himself, the director
of a local museum and three physicians in the town.
   Jarzebski will be removed as soon as a new mayor can be found.
The council postponed a decision on what to do about the cars.
   The 2,323 councils chosen May 27 by Poland's first fully
democratic elections in 50 years are supposed to restore autonomy
to local government, which has been an arm of the
Communist-controlled central administration.
   Like the 9-month-old national government, led by Solidarity, the
new councils find empty coffers and a mountain of problems left
behind by the old regimes.
   Podkowa Lesna is a relatively affluent suburb of Warsaw,
population about 2,500, but many of its streets are unpaved.
Residents live in brick houses set amongst pine, birch and oak
trees. There is a small food store, a pharmacy and a news stand,
but little other commerce and no high school.
   Voters in Podkowa Lesna elected the Solidarity Citizens
Committee candidates and the new council of 15 members took office
June 6. It chose committees on finance, planning and social
services and appointed several members to investigate the town's
situation.
   As its first fiscal act, the council appropriated 800,000 zlotys
($84) to send eight poor children to summer camp.
   The council has yet to determine how much money it has, how much
it will need or how much Warsaw will provide. Under the new rules,
most funds for local government must be raised by the communities
themselves.
   ``We'll need to find a gold mine or an oil well to pay all the
town's bills,'' said Joanna Walc, editor of Gazeta Podkowianska,
the biweekly newspaper.
   Marek Kobosko, head of the council's economic committee, hopes
Podkowa Lesna will be able to form companies and make money by
operating them, but acknowledges taxes will have to be raised.
   Where the money will come from may be a problem, but the council
is fairly clear on how it should be spent.
   Adequate police protection is a major priority.
   The three police officers who staff the town's two-room station
go home at the end of the day, leaving Podkowa Lesna unprotected
overnight.
   Break-ins and other theft have increased 105 percent this year
from 1989. Police say one reason is loss of income under the
free-market economic reform plan put into effect by the national
government Jan. 1.
   Jan Jedzrejewski, the local commander, wants to increase the
number of officers, but the size of the force is determined by the
Interior Ministry, based on population. Residents say the town
needs more police because it is spread out.
   Where to put the station is the most immediate problem. It now
is in a private home the Communists expropriated in 1948, but the
original owners are reclaiming the property, as have the owners of
another house in which the post office is located.
   The council may move the police to the municipal building, which
is expected to have extra space when unneeded bureaucrats are
dismissed.
   Podkowa, as residents call the town, also needs money to run its
elementary school, improve the sewers and expand the telephone
system. About 600 people without telephones want them, and there
are not enough repairmen to keep the existing lines in working
order.
   Lach said the council will examine land sales and distribution
under former town governments to make sure friends of officials did
not benefit from special deals.
   There also is the matter of a building and repair business that
is run by the town administration and has more people working in
its offices than in production.
   ``The last 40 years changed the whole structure and values of
the town, and now we have to create them anew,'' said councilman
Kazimierz Glowacki.

<HEAD>Britain Treats the Poles to Puzzling Lessons in Democracy</HEAD>

   Half a dozen town councilors stared at
a three-story apartment block and debated whether a resident's
television satellite dish was unsightly.
   Fifteen Poles, in Britain to learn how to run a democracy,
stared in disbelief.
   ``We don't pay attention to such small things, but maybe here
they don't have such big things,'' said Maria Komarnicka, a
professor of finance at the University of Wroclaw.
   Satellite dishes have been an issue in Poland because the
Communist government banned private ones in an attempt to keep
Western influence out.
   Now those restrictions are gone, but in the tough new economic
regime that has replaced communism, most Poles can't afford dishes.
Britons can, but need permission from local authorities charged
with preserving the landscape.
   These are the kind of issues the Poles came to study. Ms.
Komarnicka's group is the first to undergo a two-week course in
local government in Leicester, a town in central England.
   It is part of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's aid program for
Europe's new democracies, built on a ``know-how'' fund for Poland
and Hungary of 75 million pounds ($128 million).
   Other East European governments also may get funds for programs
ranging from how to operate a small business to managing large
commercial enterprises and running city government.
   Most of the Poles are academics who will train 52,000 officials
elected May 27 in Poland's first free local elections in half a
century.
   ``We have no tradition of local government; it died 50 years
ago,'' said Chris Mularczyk, deputy director of the Warsaw-based
Foundation for Local Democracy, which oversees the training
programs.
   ``In Britain, there is an ethos of local democracy, and even if
you are a new councilor you instinctively have an idea of what to
do.''
   Mularczyk said those elected in Poland, however, ``all of a
sudden realize, I'm a councilor, but what does that mean?''
   At Leicester, they learned that detail is a major part of local
democracy.
   One exercise simulated a dispute between a group of gardeners
and a property developer, with the local council mediating.
   ``These people are much more hard-nosed and more concerned with
principles than the British students who usually take the class,
but this is small beer compared to a revolution,'' said the
exercise leader, Lynton Robins.
   The dispute was resolved by having the developer pay off the
gardeners. Then the visitors joined the Charnwood Borough Council
in a large, green bus for a tour.
   They visited an attractive, historic stone house the owner wants
to extend.
   Charnwood councilors mulled it over, standing in the tree-lined
street. Course member Grzegorz Walendzik of the town council in
Starachowice put a hand to his head.
   ``We haven't enough schools or flats for people'' in
Starachowice, he said. ``There is no time to visit individual
houses.''.
   Witold Kalinowski, a professor at the Polish Academy of Science,
looked at the satellite dish earlier and said: ``It is now proved
for me that the words community and communism have the same
etymological root. In Poland we may be in disarray and shambles,
but we don't have people deciding if we can have a satellite dish.''
   John Greenwood, director of the Leicester Polytechnic program,
replied: ``Local democracy boils down to smaller things. As boring
as many of these things are, we have to go through the procedures
because we're taking about people's rights.''

<HEAD>Sexual Revolution Arrives Reaching India, but Slowly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventeen centuries after teaching the
world how to make love, India is re-learning its own lesson.
   The rise of a Westernized middle class has brought a sexual
revolution, and formerly taboo subjects are coming into the open.
   Movies, books, singles magazines and hospitals treat sex with a
clarity that rivals the world's best how-to sex manual, India's own
Kama Sutra from the 3rd century.
   In June, a doctor published India's first study of orgasm.
Bombay Friend, the country's first magazine for homosexuals, began
publishing in May.
   Late in 1989, a psychoanalyst brought out the first book on
Indian sexuality. India's only singles magazine, which publishes
twice a year, began a monthly supplement in June.
   Even the conservative rural population is not immune. A survey
in June indicated condom sales in the countryside rose 200 percent
between 1985 and 1989. Doctors say an increasing number of farmers
seek treatment for sexual problems.
   Movies, a repository of India's vivid fantasy life, are
exploring a woman's sexual needs for the first time.
   Rape scenes, previously a must for a successful movie, are less
frequent and Indian leading men are starting to woo women instead
of yanking their pony tails like latter-day cavemen.
   In a movie called ``Truth,'' a woman even makes the first move,
unbuttoning her lover's shirt. Sunday magazine called that a
cinematic first for India.
   In ``My Husband Belongs To Me,'' a woman accused of being a
man's mistress defies society by moving into his house.
   On the darker side, AIDS is believed to be spreading rapidly.
Studies of Bombay prostitutes indicate the number testing positive
for the AIDS virus has jumped 500 percent in three years to about
10,000.
   ``We are undergoing a revolution in consciousness,'' said Sudhir
Kakar, the psychoanalyst who wrote ``Intimate Relations,'' the
first study of Indian sexuality. ``Right now, we are at the talking
phase.''
   Most of India's 880 million people still live by Hindu
tradition, which puts the extended family above the individual. Sex
takes a back seat to harmony, and the central family relationship
is not wife to husband but mother-in-law to wife.
   About 90 percent of Indian marriages are arranged, and sexual
affairs, when they occur, often happen within the family. According
to a 1984 study at a New Delhi hospital, half the men in a group of
1,000 had their first sexual experience with the wife of an elder
brother.
   Sexual taboos remain so strong in many Hindu communities that
women often do not have a word for their genitals, Kakar wrote in
``Intimate Relations.'' Women commonly refer to sex as ``working.''
   He said many Indian men believe ejaculation is a sign of
weakness and that women, by nature, are impure or wild beings.
   In India, Kakar said in the study, sex has become ``a zone of
genital combat'' where men's fantasies are filled with fear and
dread and women's longings weighed down with anger and
disappointment.
   Change is under way.
   Teen-age dating was almost unheard of in the 1970s. Now, coffee
shops and restaurants in major cities fill with couples when night
falls.
   A survey of 2,800 people last year by the Illustrated Weekly,
one of India's most popular magazines, found about 85 percent of
students aged 16 to 25 approved of ``mixing freely'' with the
opposite sex. The figure for people over 25 was 70 percent.
   Even virginity, a foundation of Hinduism's concept of marriage,
has taken a beating. Experts say almost every man insisted his
bride be a virgin 20 years ago, but only slightly more than half of
several thousand students questioned recently listed is as a
requirement.
   ``We are in the midst of great change,'' said Prakash Kothari,
India's foremost sexologist and author of ``Orgasm: New
Dimensions,'' India's first book on the subject.
   ``Women are now standing up for their rights to be sexually
satisfied,'' he said. ``It's just begun. I would never even have
dreamed of that 18 years ago when I started my practice.''
   Husbands are becoming more cooperative, he said by telephone
from his office in Bombay. ``They are making efforts to satisfy
their wives. That, I think, is a first.''
   Indians approach the idea of sexual revolution with a certain
irony. This is the country, after all, that produced the lush
eroticism of the Kama Sutra and the unihibited physical celebration
of the Khajuraho temple carvings.
   ``In some ways it is simply a process of remembering long-silent
traditions,'' Kothari said. ``We have to engage in an excavation of
our subconscious.''
   The change appears to be coming more from the West than from
India's past. Years of relatively strong economic growth have
created a middle class, estimated at about 150 million, that looks
to the West for inspiration.
   India's new yuppies exude self-confidence and a willingness to
experiment with new lifestyles.
   ``We are a broad-minded Moslem couple,'' says an ad soliciting
``adventurous couples and ladies'' in the singles magazine,
Bombayite. ``There is no word `No' in our vocabulary.''

<HEAD>Nigerian Hopes U.S. Lawsuit Will Offset Curse From Mother's Burial</HEAD>

   Almost four years after his mother died,
Onyebuchim Onyeanusi yearns to give her a honorable burial that
might lift a curse against him and his family.
   The curse, rooted in African tribal beliefs, has been blamed for
all sorts of woe in his native Nigerian village: dismal yam
harvests, a canceled wedding and an epidemic that killed chickens,
goats and sheep.
   The bad things started after his mother was buried in shame,
after, he says, her body was mishandled and misplaced for eight
days while being shipped from the United States.
   Because he was responsible for the funeral, Onyeanusi says he
was cursed by the gods of his native Ibo tribe, as were 98 family
members.
   Onyeanusi hoped to set things right the Western way: He and the
relatives filed suit against Pan American World Airways, which
shipped her body home. But a federal judge ruled against him last
month, and his efforts to avenge his mother's spirit now hinge on
appeals.
   ``The war is not over,'' Onyeanusi said. ``This was only a
battle.''
   Onyeanusi's saga underscores the challenges of Africans emerging
in the modern world, but still rooted in traditional beliefs.
   It began Oct. 1, 1986, when his mother, Olamma, died of
pneumonia while visiting Onyeanusi, who lives on visa status with
his American wife and their four children in Philadelphia. The
mother was about 90 when she died, although her age was unknown
because of uncertain birth records.
   Pan Am shipped his mother's body while Onyeanusi flew to
southeastern Nigeria to arrange the funeral. The body was supposed
to go to Paris, then home via Nigeria Airways.
   According to tribal custom, all business stops until the honored
person is buried. The family bears all expenses, and Onyeanusi
pledged the family's 155-acre plantation to feed the 20,000
villagers who gathered for the feast honoring his mother.
   ``We believe people should rejoice in death. The highest honor
you can give someone is at death. There is singing, feasting, the
shooting of guns,'' Onyeanusi said.
   But the villagers waited and waited and waited. Each day for
eight days, a frustrated and bewildered Onyeanusi made the two-hour
drive to the airport.
   The funeral tab eventually came to about $24,000. But that was
the least of the family's woes.
   The Videon Funeral Home of Broomall, Pa., embalmed Olamma
Onyeanusi's body and dressed it in a blue sarong, blue turban and
white gloves. She was placed in a sheet metal case, which in turn
was put into an air tray made of corrugated paper.
   The body left New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport
on Oct. 15.
   But a Pan Am memo dated Oct. 20 from the director of cargo at
Roissy Airport in Paris said: ``Shipment received with a crate
surrounding the coffin damaged. Nigerian Airways refused to accept
transfer and we had to call the Pompes Funebres (French funeral
home) to repair that crate.''
   When the body arrived in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, the family said
it had decayed. And somewhere along the line, Olamma Onyeanusi had
been wrapped in burlap and turned upside down _ tribal taboos that
show someone committed suicide or was an evil person.
   ``These are regarded as the greatest abuse to be given a
corpse,'' Onyeausi said. ``We knew from the smell the body had
spoiled. She was decomposed, decaying. The skin was peeling off.''
   At the funeral, the family burned heavy incense to mask the
smell before burying her in disgrace.
   The family offered sacrifices of yams, money and English wine to
appease the gods. But tribe members say they have seen the woman's
spirit roaming, despite placing chains on her grave to hold her
down.
   ``If anything happens, the family is blamed for it,'' said
Onyeanusi. ``My mother was treated as if she were nothing. My
mother is not at peace. She is angry.''
   One relative, Obioha Onyeanusi, was a prominent farmer, but was
ruined by a poor harvest of yams, an Ibo delicacy. An epidemic
blamed on the curse also killed 2,500 chickens, 95 goats and 89
sheep.
   The woman's daughter, Nnalu, earned a degree at Cheyney
University in Pennsylvania and went home in 1986 to marry a man she
had known for 10 years. But he called off the wedding because of
the curse.
   Business deals also went sour, the family says.
   ``It was as if the family had been shunned. Nobody wanted
anything to do with them,'' said John Beavers, Onyeanusi's lawyer.
   The family sued in 1988 to recover costs for mental anguish,
emotional distress and breach of contract. But U.S. District Court
Judge Edmund Ludwig threw the case out June 13 without saying
anything about the curse.
   Ludwig ruled the case was covered by the Warsaw Convention, an
international treaty that limits liability on shipments to about
$18 per pound with a maximum damage claim of $75,000.
   The treaty also requires damage claims be filed within 21 days.
Onyeanusi didn't notify Pan Am for 60 days, so his claim was
invalid, the judge said.
   Thomas Bracaglia, Pan Am's attorney, denied the airline
mishandled the corpse, but refused to comment on specific
allegations. But, he said, ``The issues themselves are
fascinating.''
   Onyeanusi has asked the judge to reconsider and, failing that,
will seek relief from the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   ``It goes against the grain of not only Nigerian thinking but
American thinking that human remains are just goods that can be
lost like luggage,'' Beavers said.
   ``We're not trying to prove to an American jury these curses are
real. All we want to do is convince them the family believes it's
true and they've suffered consequences,'' he said.
   Onyeanusi, who is about 50, was a captain in the losing Biafran
army during Nigeria's 1967-70 civil war, Africa's bloodiest tribal
conflict, in which 1 million people were killed.
   He left his native village of Uzuakoli and the land of the Ibo,
the fourth-largest ethnic group in his homeland, to study in
America. He earned a bachelor's degree at Philadelphia College of
Textiles and Science, a master's degree at Temple University and a
doctorate in vocational education at Temple.
   Experts on African beliefs say Onyeanusi might not be able to
offset the curse even if he wins the appeal. But it's his only
chance to regain respect.
   ``The gravity of a curse like this is such that one lives with
it forever,'' said Emeke Akaezuwa, an Ibo who is executive director

   ``Harvey'' (MCA Home Video. VHS-Beta. Unrated.)
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   In the 1950s, James Stewart turned mean.
   Romantic comedies were out, thrillers and Westerns were in. The
boy-next-door got nasty in ``Bend of the River,'' spied on his
neighbors in ``Rear Window'' and almost lost his mind in
``Vertigo'' and ``The Naked Spur.''
   But at the start of the decade, at the same time he starred in
the tough Western ``Winchester '73,'' Stewart gave the public one
more look at Mr. Nice Guy: Elwood P. Dowd in ``Harvey.''
   Elwood is in his early 40s and shares a house with his older
sister, Veta, and niece, Myrtle Mae. He is the most considerate of
men, forever holding doors open and offering invitations for
dinner, a penchant for martinis his only vice.
   Why is he so happy? According to Elwood, he was walking down the
street one evening when he encountered a large white rabbit leaning
against a lamppost and the two became instant soulmates.
   Elwood has no job _ a large inheritance took care of that _ and
no girl, but ``always has a wonderful time'' thanks to the towering
_ and invisible _ presence of his dear friend, Harvey.
   ``Is he alone?'' Veta is asked. ``Well, there's two schools of
thought, sir,'' she responds.
   Now Elwood wants everybody to meet Harvey, much to the
unhappiness of his relatives. ``Why can't we live like other
people?'' complains Myrtle Mae, who seeks a man but won't bring
anyone to the house, fearing the inevitable introduction to the
unseen rabbit.
   Veta is more sympathetic, but when she invites wealthy aunt
Ethel for an afternoon tea party, Elwood quickly clears the room as
he brings his special friend around to meet the guests.
   And that's the last straw. Veta attempts to have Elwood placed
in a sanitarium, but the psychiatrist mistakenly believes she is
the crazy one and has her carried off to a soundproof chamber.
Boasts Elwood: ``I've wrestled with reality for 35 years, doctor,
and I'm happy to say I've finally won it.''
   Everything works out fine, of course. Veta is released, Myrtle
Mae gets a bpyfriend, the psychiatrist falls for his nurse, and
Elwood, who makes believers out of almost everybody, strolls
amiably into the sunset, Harvey by his side.
   Elwood is one of the actor's most popular roles. Stewart first
portrayed him on stage, as a summer replacement for Frank Fay in
1947, and was offered the part for the film version of Mary Chase's
Pulitzer Prize-winning play.
   ``Harvey'' brought him an Academy Award nomination _ Josephine
Hull won an Oscar for best supporting actress as Veta _ and Stewart
would continue to play Elwood in theater revivals. But the film,
and its gentle message about who's sane and who's not, has aged
badly. Home viewers may be interested, however, in Stewart's
observations given in a special introduction to the black and white
video.
   ``In this world you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant,''
Elwood says of his unflappable geniality, and that sums up this
sweet, bland comedy. Even Stewart has said his portrayal was too
nice. He brought out more haunting aspects in later appearances,
including a 1972 television production.

   A Jenny Lind Recital (Northeastern) _ Elizabeth Parcells,
soprano; James Winn, piano; Robert Honeysucker, baritone
   
   In 1850, Jenny Lind, the world-renowned Swedish Nightingale,
conquered the United States in particularly hysterical fashion
befitting her promoter, P.T. Barnum, his century's combination of
our Donalds: King, Trump and Kirschner. Lind's triumphal tour plays
no small part in the nation's music history.
   Northeastern, an admirable small recording company based in
Saxonville, Mass., devoted to American music, has tried to bring
Lind back to life. Parcells reproduces on disc a typical concert
that Lind might have given during the tour.
   She sings with complete security, a clean sound, excellent
diction and tight vibrato. But there is a certain inflexibility in
her phrasing, particularly in Mozart's Queen of the Night aria from
``The Magic Flute'' that Lind probably didn't have, by all
contemporary accounts. Technically, though, Parcells is impeccable.
And she does evoke what one imagines to be the Nordic purity and
song-bird brilliance of her predecessor.
   The program, the notes tell us, is typically Lind: on the
opening oratorio number (``On Mighty Pens'' from Haydn's
``Creation'' here); operatic showpieces such as ``Ma la sola,
ohime! son io,'' from Bellini's ``Beatrice di Tenda''; a comic duet
with baritone from Rossini's ``Il Turco in Italia''; a piano
interlude and popular songs.
   Lind often ended her programs with ``Home Sweet Home,'' and
Parcells offers a lovely version sung with appealing simplicity.
   The real praise should go to Northeastern for producing such an
imaginative disc, and so many other highly worthwhile projects in
recent years.

   ``Any Kind of Lie'' (RCA) _ Marti Jones
   
   John Hiatt. Elvis Costello. Marshall Crenshaw. Janis Ian. The
list of songwriters Ohio singer Marti Jones has tapped in her
career is long and impressive.
   On her new album, the pop-country singer and her husband, Don
Dixon, decide to do most of the writing. The results, coming off of
1988's hidden gem ``Used Guitars'' LP, are disappointing.
   Jones has a pillow-soft voice that wraps itself lovingly around
a melody. Most of the melodies on ``Any Kind of Lie'' are lifeless,
the song structures too similar and simple. Some songs suffer from
arrangements that are too harsh; Jones should never have to fight
to make herself heard above a snare drum.
   Oddly, anyone persistent enough to stick with this disc until
the end will be rewarded. The last three songs are the best. ``One
Shade Darker'' features some lovely accordion by Fats Kaplin.
``It's a Crime,'' with a whiny country chorus, is the best rocker
on the album. Loudon Wainwright III's ``Old Friend'' brings the
album to a melancholic close.
   Dropped by A&amp;M because of poor record sales, this promising
artist was snapped up by RCA for this album. Let's hope this record
company is rewarded for its patience.

<HEAD>The Artists: Brilliant ``Idomeneo'' Launches Gardiner's Mozart
Project</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Eliot Gardiner has such a high opinion of
Mozart's opera ``Idomeneo'' that he decided not to put it on stage
this summer.
   ``I didn't want to be distracted, quite honestly, by the dangers
of a producer who had a completely different idea of the score from
mine, because there is so much musical richness and explicitness in
the score,'' Gardiner said.
   Instead, he led three concert performances of ``Idomeneo'' at
the South Bank Center last month to kick off a six-year,
seven-opera Mozart recording project for the English Baroque
Soloists and Monteverdi Choir.
   It was an electrifying beginning. Gardiner's high dramatic,
immaculately detailed reading was supported by silken performances
on original instruments and a solid vocal cast featuring Anthony
Rolfe-Johnson in the title role, Anne Sofie von Otter as his son,
Idamante, and the American soprano Sylvia McNair as Ilia,
Idamante's beloved.
   ``Idomeneo'' was paired with Mozart's rarely performed last
opera, ``La Clemenza di Tito,'' and both were recorded by Deutsche
Grammophone's Archiv label.
   ``Idomeneo'' is scheduled for release next year. Still to come
are fully staged productions in Paris, Lisbon and Amsterdam of
``The Magic Flute,'' ``The Marriage of Figaro,'' ``Cosi fan
tutte,'' ``Abduction From the Seraglio'' and ``Don Giovanni.''
Compact disc and videotape recordings are planned.
   The concert version of ``Idomeneo'' was impeccably authentic _
the last performance of the opera in Mozart's lifetime was a
private concert directed by the composer in Vienna in 1789.
   According to Constanze Mozart, ``Idomeneo'' was her husband's
favorite. She recalled some years after his death that he had burst
into tears during a private performance of the quartet in Act 3, in
which Idamante sets off ``on my wanderings alone, seeking death
elsewhere until I find it.''
   ``Idomeneo,'' in Gardiner's estimation, is ``the most
passionately engaged of all the Mozart operas ... unfailing in its
inventiveness.''
   ``There is not a superfluous note or a gratuitous aria in it,''
he said.
   The conductor approaches Mozart from nearly two centuries
earlier, through performances and recordings of works such as
Claudio Monteverdi's 1607 opera, ``La favola d'Orfeo.''
   More recently, the English Baroque Soloists recorded Mozart's
late symphonies and, with Malcolm Bilson, the piano concertos.
   ``So we have done our apprenticeship, as it were, in Mozart's
instrumental and operatic style,'' Gardiner said during a break
from rehearsing ``Clemenza.''
   ``And the revelations are extraordinary from the moment you use
these instruments, because it's not simply that the timbre of the
individual instruments is so different from their modern
equivalents, but the sound is more visceral, it's more physical in
a way, and you feel that they are much more individual voices. The
instruments have a personality, very very sharply defined. So the
mixing in with the voices is a fascinating process.''
   Did they have to forget Monteverdi to play Mozart?
   ``Not a bit. What you have to do is forget everything that you
learned of later music, music that comes after Mozart,'' Gardiner
said.
   ``That's where the whole false performing tradition has grown
up. It's seeing Mozart as a precursor of the great operatic events
of the 19th century, where I feel we have gone wrong over Mozart,''
he said.
   Instead, he regards Mozart as the culmination of the baroque
tradition, from Monteverdi through Handel, Purcell and Rameau.
   Gardiner made one surprising break with Mozart tradition, using
a piano instead of a harpsichord with the recitatives. Mozart used
a piano in opera, certainly after 1782, Gardiner says, but that's a
year after the premiere of ``Idomeneo'' in Munich.
   In Gardiner's judgment, a harpsichord simply sounds wrong _ ``it
makes too abrupt a change'' from the orchestral playing.
   He also parts company with some of the early instruments
community on the matter of Mozart's pupil, Franz Xaver Suessmayr,
so often maligned for his contributions to ``La Clemenza di Tito''
and the completion of the Requiem.
   The Requiem, especially, has been drastically revised by modern
editors, but Gardiner stuck with Suessmayr for this summer's
performances of ``Clemenza'' and the Requiem.
   ``I think he was not a very talented composer, but he has the
huge advantage of being a composer writing in the 1790s, at the
time when Mozart was dying _ or dead _ and he is far closer to
Mozart's style than an awful lot of the editors and bigwigs who set
themselves up as being neo-Mozartean scholars,'' Gardiner said.
   ``I have yet to come across an edition of the Mozart Requiem
that is actually materially more convincing than that of Suessmayr,
which certainly has its gaucheries and infelicities ...
   ``Well, we tidy up a little bit of it, but some of the published
versions that are now flaunted around, even in the so-called
`authentic' world, are really a disgrace in terms of Mozartean
style.''

   It's 11 a.m., an ungodly hour for most musicians
but just right for Eric Clapton _ a good time for cigarettes,
coffee and quiet conversation.
   He leans back in a green easy chair in his Manhattan hotel room,
his right ankle resting on the opposite knee. His face is deeply
tanned, the beard trim, his wavy brown hair brushed back. A black
T-shirt and bluejeans hang loosely from his rock star-skinny body.
   But it's the eyes you really notice _ the unwavering stare, how
the lids cut downwards at sharp angles, the way his brows form a
crease above his nose as he concentrates on what's being said and
considers his response.
   For a man who looks so reserved on stage, Clapton is in person,
surprisingly, a man of many words. He disapproves of asking
questions (bad manners, he says, observing is more his style), but
answers easily, spinning stories of the blues and the business.
   He talks about guitarists: early heroes such as Elmore James and
Buddy Guy, his all-time favorite; contemporaries, Jimi Hendrix and
Duane Allman; and young performers such as Robert Cray, a featured
player on Clapton's most recent album, ``Journeyman.''
   ``When you meet another guitarist, the first thing you do is
compare notes,'' Clapton, 45, explains. ``You find out who he
likes. `Do you like Robert Johnson?' It's a selfish kind of thing,
you always tend to like being around people who like the same
things you do.
   ``It was clear to me that Cray was a real dyed-in-the wool blues
musician. He's also very, very quiet, very aware, very sensitive.''
   There's a good example of the Clapton approach in the Chuck
Berry concert film, ``Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll.'' Invited by
organizer Keith Richards, Clapton takes it slow, checking out
Berry, considering what he wants to sing. He eventually settles on
a rare Berry blues, ``Wee Wee Hours,'' and gives a typically
dignified performance.
   ``My attitude's always been to just tread carefully, be seen and
not heard,'' he says. ``When I used to see my heroes as a kid, I
would just watch and listen. It's the same thing when I got to know
them. Like Buddy Guy, I just watch him and I can see that he's
doing the same thing.
   ``He says every time he sees someone playing he learns
something, which is great.''
   For much of his career, Clapton has preferred to be heard and
not seen. He makes videos, but reluctantly, insisting he has no
interest in acting. Those eyes of an eagle were meant for checking
out other guitarists, not working cameras.
   In concert, he doesn't fall to his knees or bump and grind or
run from one end of the stage to the other when walking is so much
easier. It's just not dignified, not how a gentleman would behave.
   ``There's a line on the `Layla' album, `Do you want to see me
crawl across the floor to you?''' Clapton says, referring to ``Bell
Bottom Blues.''
   ``Some people could do that, crawl across the floor on stage. I
couldn't do that. I wouldn't be able to watch myself on TV if I
played like that. That would be embarrassing to me.''
   Clapton was born in 1945 in Ripley, a small town outside of
London. He became interested in music after seeing Jerry Lee Lewis
perform on television and received an acoustic guitar for his 14th
birthday.
   In the early 1960s, he began spending time in London
coffeehouses, listening to such England blues performers as Alexis
Korner, Cyril Davis and ``Long John'' Baldry. He joined his first
blues band, the Roosters, in 1963.
   Clapton earned a wide following in the mid-'60s with John
Mayall's Bluesbreakers and became an international star with Cream
toward the end of the decade.
   On originals such as ``Layla'' and ``I Can't Stand It,'' or
covers of Bobby Bland's ``Further on up the Road'' and Johnson's
``Ramblin' on My Mind,'' Clapton sings of gentlemen pushed to the
limit, down on the floor, their dignity tested by love, lies and
their own jealous hearts.
   ``Lately I've been running on faith. What else can a poor boy
do?'' he asks on ``Running on Faith'' from his ``Journeyman''
album. ``Sadness can't prevail,'' he sings on ``Pretending.''
``Everybody knows that strong love can't fail.''
   His greatest songs have been about despair and renewal, of
lonely years and the presence of the Lord, a walk with the devil's
music for a man who once inspired ``CLAPTON IS GOD'' graffiti on
walls around London.
   In 1970, the loss of faith pushed him to the extremes of
``Layla,'' with its five-alarm guitar riff and vocals that sound
like a man going down in flames.
   It pushed him to an anguished cover of Chuck Willis' ``It's too
Late.'' The original was gentle, the singer sadly resigned to
losing his girl. For Clapton, it's much worse. He's in tears, as if
life itself is slipping away, his fate confirmed by background
yells of ``Oh, she's gone!''
   Despair almost finished him in real life as well. ``Layla''
flopped when it was first released, and when he tried to record an
album with the same musicians the following year, the band fell
apart. Clapton developed a serious heroin addiction that forced him
into virtual seclusion for 2{ years.
   ``The most horrible I sound is when I've been burned out and in
a bad state of mind and bad state of health,'' Clapton says. ``You
have to live with it. If you can be happy with it when you're old,
you've got a much more contented life.''
   A gentleman, Clapton observed is a spiritual soul, and faith
regained brings out his more spiritual side. ``Let It Grow,'' from
his 1974 album ``461 Ocean Boulevard,'' sounds like one long sigh
of relief, an offer of thanks for his own survival. On ``Anything
for Your Love,'' off ``Journeyman,'' he sings of love as salvation,
his guitar lifting the song right off the ground.
   ``There's a yearning quality to it,'' he says, ``a spiritual
striving there that all musicians attain to. It's just inherent in
what you to, trying to achieve that which you couldn't really
achieve.''
   Muddy Waters, the great bluesman with whom Clapton became close
in the late 1970s, once spoke of the importance of being a
gentleman, and not the kind with a hat and cane: ``You don't have
to have a white face to be a gentleman and up to date with what
you're doing. You can be black, brown or any other color, but
you've got to carry yourself in a way that people know that you're
it.
   ``They might say I can't play or I can't sing, but, damn it,
they'll say I was a gentleman.''
   Clapton agreed, explaining the challenges of compressing a
lifetime of thoughts and feelings into five restless fingers.
   ``I think it has something to do with grace, being graceful in
your life as much as you can be. What happens is that no matter
what you play, it's a reflection of what you are.
   ``So if you live in a state of grace and dignity, it'll come out
in what you're playing. I'm starting to realize what I'm doing now
has to be good enough to be happy with in 20 years' time.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Tennessee Williams and the Real Maggie the Cat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here sits Maggie the Cat, in a gray blouse and
blue dress, the real Maggie, the one Tennessee Williams had in mind
when he wrote ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.''
   ``In her long speeches she has the vocal tricks of a priest
delivering a liturgical chant,'' Williams writes of the play's
feisty heroine. ``The lines are almost sung, always continuing a
little beyond her breath so she has to gasp for another.''
   And Lady St. Just, the playwright's close friend for 35 years,
does speak quickly, excitedly, but in the polished, throaty tones
of British aristocracy, not the drawl of the Mississippi Delta.
   ``Five O'Clock Angel'' ($24.95, Knopf) is a collection of
letters received from Williams _ the title is the playwright's
nickname for her _ with her own commentary woven throughout.
   She was quick to criticize him, whether dumping his memoirs in
the garbage or scolding him for daydreaming too often. But when it
comes to defending Tennessee Williams, no one is more determined
than Lady St. Just.
   ``Writing was his life,'' she explained in an interview at her
hotel suite in Manhattan. ``That's why people found him so
difficult. He was up there half the time. He worked terribly hard.
Look how prolific he was. Writing was his passion and he was my
passion.''
   The daughter of a prominent surgeon, she was born Maria Britneva
in Leningrad and moved to Britain when she was still young. She
trained first for the ballet and then appeared in several plays for
Sir John Gielgud's production company. In 1956, she married Peter
Grenfell, Lord St. Just, and had two daughters. Lord St. Just died
in 1985.
   She met Williams in 1948, at a small party in London given by
Gielgud, whose guests included Laurence Olivier, Vivien Leigh and
Noel Coward. Lady St. Just was 18 at the time, and remembered
spotting a shy little man, one sock blue and the other red, sitting
nervously on the couch.
   ``You felt this great sort of wave of fear,'' she recalled of
Williams, who had recently completed ``A Streetcar Named Desire''
and would win the Pulitzer Prize for ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,''
which was revived last year on Broadway starring Charles Durning
and Kathleen Turner.
   ``I thought, `I must speak to him.' I thought he was an
understudy. I asked him if he would like a drink.
   ``He seemed surprised I paid attention to him. He looked up,
blushed, and asked, `Who brought you up?' `My grandmother,' I said.
And he said, ``My grandmother brought me up, too.' Only Tennessee
would ask a question like that.''
   So thanks, appropriately, to the kindness of a stranger, their
friendship began. Williams wrote her a month later and the letters
continued until the last few months of his troubled life.

   Lady St. Just's memories of Williams, who died in 1983 at age
71, are of panicky opening nights, long drives in Rome, visits with
her family in England, and the day when the playwright tossed her a
finished script and told her to read it.
   ``He said, `I've written the play about you.' He just flung the
script at me. I said, `Tennessee, how wonderful,' and then with
mounting fury I read this play. I said, `This is outrageous, that's
not me. I'm from Russia, I want wolves, I want carriages.
   ``He said, `I'm writing about your spirituality, your vitality.
You are life, you know.' My children saw it and they kept laughing,
They said, `Mommy, you're just like that.''
   Here are highlights from Lady St. Just's discussion on the
prize-winning play:
   Q: In ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' Maggie says to Brick, her
husband, ``Oh you weak, beautiful people who give up with such
grace.'' Is that how Tennessee Williams felt about himself?
   A: He never thought of himself as being weak, not at all. He was
fragile, not weak. He was extremely strong and very determined and
very positive. There's this picture of Tennessee as this kind of
delicate person. I'm trying to change that.
   Q: But he was sensitive, easily hurt.
   A: Very. But then he gave idiotic interviews himself. I used to
say, ``If I write my memoirs I would call them, `Oh Do Shut Up,
Tennessee.''' I used to give him signals when he was doing
interviews. He used to just blab on and on, and he would say things
that were unnecessary and could be misinterpretated.
   Q: In the mid-1950s, his letters make more and more references
to his being depressed. Is that when you first noticed his problems?
   A: I think he always had problems. But even when he was at his
lowest, he said, ``En avant,'' go forward. He was so masculine, you
see. He made decisions and took over. He was incrdibly large in his
attitude to me. And he supported his sister, his grandfather, his
mother, his maiden aunt and many young writers and poets.
   Q: Flannery O'Connor once wrote of one of her characters that
she would have been a good person if she had somebody to hit her
over the head all the time. Did Williams value you for that?
   A: He needed somebody who was very truthful and terribly honest,
to a fault. He knew I would never lie to him. He taught me how not
to lie. But I was always very careful what I said about his plays
and his poems. I would step so far.
   Q: What was the happiest you ever saw him?
   A: The happiest I ever saw him was when we were both doubled up
in laughter, playing the fools. We shared the same sense of the
ridiculous. We would take a taxi on our way to the opening of a
play and he was so nervous. I would make him sing, sing and do
imitations. He sung very, very badly, but he loved it.
   Q: He didn't seem to trust many people.
   A: He was the most suspicious, paranoid person. It was a
nightmare. ``Tennessee, no one is looking at you.''
   We were on this plane once and we had this perfectly ordinary
stewardess, and he decided she was a murderess. He wouldn't eat
anything because he thought she had poisoned it. He asked for a
glass of water, and I'll never forget, Tenmnesee took a sip from
the glass, held it to me, and said, ``Does this taste like water to
you?''
   Q: In ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' Brick is always drinking and
talks about getting the click in his head. Get the click and
everything will be all right. Is that how Williams felt?
   A: I think the click in his head was the click of the
typewriter. If he really got into a beautiful poem or a beautiful
line, that would be the click for him. Tennessee felt exactly the
same way about his typewriter as Brick did about his bottle.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Steve Earle Sings Them His Way</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN STRAUSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Steve Earle weaves back and forth between rock
'n' roll and country, the soul of his voice in one world and the
wail of his guitars in another.
   Earle broke through with the album ``Guitar Town'' in 1986 after
one false start and a decade of paying his dues in Nashville. They
called his brand of hard-bitten, country-rock ``power twang'' and
compared his stories of losers and lovers in the small-town South
to Bruce Springsteen's Jersey ballads and John Mellencamp's Midwest.
   It ain't your typical country: A character in a country song
gets drunk on a bad day. Earle's anti-heroes split for Mexico, pull
a holdup or, like the title character in ``Billy Austin,'' get
executed.
   That's been done before, but Johnny Cash didn't back his stories
up with double-lead rock riffs and a big drum sound to go with
heavy doses of mandolin and pedal steel. Earle used the Irish band
the Pogues on his last album. In ``The Hard Way,'' his fourth LP
and latest with MCA, he did one song with the Christ Missionary
Baptist Church choir of Memphis, Tenn.
   Earle, who lives outside Nashville and has another home in Los
Angeles, will tell you he's earned the right to be different. A
childhood in rural Texas, on the road as a musician by age 16,
married at 19 and in Nashville by 20, digging swimming pools and
looking for a break. It almost happened the next year: a deal for
Elvis to record one of his songs. The King didn't show up.
   But Earle was selling a few songs, and eight years later, in
1983, he signed a deal with CBS. He didn't like the four singles
that came out of it, and an album they made wasn't distributed. But
three years later, he signed a seven-album deal with MCA. He's
since had some Top-10 country success, and the title song off his
last record, ``Copperhead Road,'' was a rock crossover.
   In a recent New York promotional stop for the new record, he
conceded the experimentation with a rock sound may disappoint some
country fans. Earle says what matters is the spirit of the music.
   ``There are some purer forms of country music, maybe by
definition, through the use of electric guitars and certain
electric guitar sounds and drum sounds,'' he said. ``But this is
the 1990s and nothing stays that pure. And when you attempt to keep
anything that pure, that's tantamount to inbreeding. It tends to
weaken the strain, not strengthen it.''
   The central character in many of Earle's songs is the
stereotypical working-class Southern man known in those parts as a
``Bubba.'' That's who's talking when Earle sings, from ``Good Old
Boy'' on his first album:
   ``I got a job but it ain't nearly enough; a $20,000 pickup
truck. 'Belongs to me and the bank, and a funny-talkin' man from
Iran.''
   Earle's own views are a bit more complex. He's against imports
and gun control, but he's also against the death penalty and loudly
supports causes at variance with his country fans.
   ``A lot of people decided that I was a hyper-redneck from
hearing songs like `Good Old Boy.' But Bubba is a composite of a
lot of people that I grew up with, and I don't have anything in
common with him. And I think some of my fans were probably shocked
at how left-wing my politics are,'' he said.
   Earle, 35, grew up in a small town north of Houston, not far
from the state prison at Huntsville. After he left home his mother
used to call him on nights when an execution was scheduled because
she couldn't sleep.
   ``You became very aware when you lived in that part of the world
that kids were going out there and sitting on the tailgates of
their trucks waiting to hear the announcement. There's this whole
circus atmosphere around it.''
   In the song ``Billy Austin,'' the title character contemplates
his death sentence for killing a gas station attendant:
   ``As the final hour drags by; I ain't about to tell you that I
don't deserve to die. But there's 27 men here, mostly black, brown
and poor. Most of 'em are guilty; who are you to say for sure?''
   Earle hopes his rock-style arrangements will make his message
songs palatable to younger fans. Many of their elders, particularly
at a major country shrine such as the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville,
aren't ready no matter how the guitars sound.
   Earle would love to play there but they've never let him.
   ``It's an older audience at the Opry,'' he said. ``You know the
old joke: `What has 30 arms, 30 legs and six teeth? The first row
at the Grand Ole Opry.'''

   Capitol-Blue Note has announced the return of
World Pacific Records, the sassy label that introduced American
audiences to Brazilian and Indian music.
   The first new World Pacific LP is ``E,'' introducing Brazilian
star Gonzaguinha. There also are three reissues: ``The Legendary
Joao Gilberto,'' ``Seduzir'' and ``Toniho Horto.''
   Other new Blue Note reissues include: John Coltrane, ``Like
Sonny,'' an early example of Coltrane's quartet; Bud Powell, ``The
Bud Powell Trio Plays,'' containing 16 works never before collected
for American release; Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, ``The
Complete Louis Armstrong &amp; Duke Ellington Sessions,'' an excellent
arrangement of Ellington compositions and Armstrong's sextet; Count
Basie and Tony Bennett, ``Basie Swings-Bennett Sings''; and Maynard
Ferguson, ``Maynard '61.''
   Blue Note also focuses on new musicians this month, with drummer
Ralph Peterson's contemporary hard-bop on ``Volition,'' and the
lyrical tones of pianist Eliane Elias with her samba-laced ``Eliane
Elias Plays Jobim.''

   Charles Mingus was a composer, bass player and
pianist. He also was something of a jazz historian and keeper of
the flame, infusing his compositions with the structures and
innovations of others such as Duke Ellington and Fats Waller.
   Mingus died on Jan. 5, 1979 of Lou Gehrig's Disease. A decade
later, a 30-year project culminated with a two-hour concert at
Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall. ``Epitaph'' was an orchestral
masterwork.
   Columbia Records made a live recording of the concert and it is
now available as a double-CD. It is a rich translation, mirroring
all the tempestuous thunder of Mingus' composition as well as its
sweet melodies and contradicting harmonies.

   The Museum of Modern Art pays tribute to
Twentieth Century Fox this summer with a retrospective of over 90
films made between 1935 and 1965.
   Opening July 1, ``Twentieth Century Fox: 1935-1965'' traces
three key decades in the history of the studio, celebrating the
talents of the artists on both sides of the cameras who shaped this
period.
   Formed in 1915, the Fox Film Corporation merged in 1935 with the
much younger Twentieth Century to launch a major new studio.
   The exhibition will highlight the epic biographies of the 1930s
such as John Ford's ``The Prisoner of Shark Island'' (1936).
   Also on exhibit will be a series of Technicolor musicals
developed during World War II, featuring such actresses as Betty
Grable and Carmen Miranda.
   The '50s segment shows how the studio maintained its preeminence
with an entire new generation of stars _ epitomized by Marilyn
Monroe _ and the introduction of CinemaScope, which literally
changed the shape of motion pictures for years to come.
   The retrospective runs through September 11.

   Bob Seger's ex-wife says in a lawsuit that
the rock singer assaulted her after their divorce and pressured her
into having an abortion.
   Annette Seger's suit, which was filed June 22 in Oakland County
Circuit Court, said she told Seger she was pregnant about two weeks
after the couple divorced on Nov. 8, 1988. It says that Seger
allegedly told her that he would make her life ``a living hell''
unless she had an abortion.
   The suit also claims Seger provided no help or comfort to
Annette Seger before, during or after the abortion, although they
were living together. The Segers were married in Las Vegas in
November 1987.
   Frederick G. Buesser III, an attorney who represented the rock
star in his divorce, said he couldn't comment on Annette Seger's
allegations because he hadn't seen the suit.
   The suit also claims that Seger threw his ex-wife against a
cement wall on Jan. 26, 1989, after she walked out of an unnamed
nightclub they had entered together. Seger allegedly followed her
outside, and said, ``Come back here! Don't you dare walk out on me,
damn it.''
   She claims she suffered emotional and physical distress and was
hospitalized for four days because of her ex-husband's conduct.
   Annette Seger, who also claims her modeling career has suffered,
is seeking more than $10,000 in damages.

   Mid-June sales of North American-made cars and
trucks lagged 3.6 percent behind a lackluster sales period last
year as the Big Three automakers couldn't match gains at U.S.
plants owned by Japanese companies.
   Domestic automakers said Monday they sold vehicles at an average
daily rate of 37,962 during the June 11-20 period, compared with an
average of 39,392 a day in the same period last year.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said
their mid-June sales dropped 6.8 percent to an average daily rate
of 34,655. Sales of U.S.-made cars with Japanese nameplates jumped
54.7 percent to an average of 2,854 a day.

<HEAD>T. Boone Pickens, Japanese Target Square Off This Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oilman and investor T. Boone Pickens expects to
lose his battle with Koito Manufacturing Co. Ltd. at Thursday's
annual shareholder meeting.
   The war, however, will go on.
   ``As long as you can hold out, remain on the right side of the
issue, you'll eventually prevail,'' Pickens said in a recent
interview in his downtown Dallas office.
   Pickens, whose request for a seat on the company's board of
directors was denied last year, is asking for four seats on the
board at this year's annual meeting.
   Pickens says his fight with Koito, which makes automobile
headlights chiefly for Toyota Motor Corp., is about open investment
in Japan. The company's refusal to put him on its board, Pickens
says, is an example of Japanese unwillingness to allow outside
investors into the country.
   ``This is about the long term. This is about the future of trade
relations between Japan and the United States, about the future of
the Japanese shareholder, consumer and working family,'' Pickens
said at the Foreign Correspondents Press Club today in Tokyo.
   He has sought help from Trade Representative Carla Hills and
Congress, with little visible impact.
   ``It has nothing to do with trade issues,'' Hamilton Loeb,
Koito's American lawyer, said in a telephone interview from Tokyo.
Loeb represented Unocal Corp. when the oil company fought off
Pickens' advances in 1985.
   Koito has rebuffed Pickens by saying he is after greenmail _
having the company buy back its stock at a premium to avoid a
takeover attempt. The company also has suggested he is simply the
front man for Kitaro Watanabe, whom the company also brands as a
greenmailer.
   The latest salvo in the battle came Monday. Koito issued a
statement saying Pickens really is not the company's biggest
stockholder as he claims, a charge Pickens quickly denied.
   Pickens bought his Koito shares from Watanabe, described by
Koito president Takao Matsuura as ``an infamous Japanese
greenmailer.''
   ``We are confident there is a secret agreement. The terms of it
we can only speculate about,'' Loeb said.
   Pickens repeatedly has said he is not after greenmail but is a
long-term investor in Koito. The company says his investment does
not make financial sense.
   Although he is a multimillionaire, Pickens' $1 billion
investment in Koito is sizable even for him. But he refuses to tell
how he financed his purchases of the stock.
   ``It isn't management's option to question that,'' he said.
   ``If he were doing this in the United States,'' Loeb said, ``he
would be obligated to make disclosures of any agreement he had with
anybody about the stock.''
   If Pickens owns the 26 percent of the stock he claims, Toyota
would be the second-largest shareholder.
   Pickens contends Toyota leads a keiretsu, or business alliance,
and forces Koito to sell its auto parts at depressed prices to the
advantage of Toyota profits and the detriment of Koito shareholders.
   ``I'm a geologist, not an economist, but I do know that whatever
you call it: a cartel, a trust, a monopoly, a keiretsu or a
zaibatsu, it's wrong,'' Pickens said in Tokyo today.
   Since being denied a board seat at last year's shareholder
meeting, Pickens has sought to inspect Koito's books and increase
its dividend.
   Koito last year agreed to increase the dividend, but only by
about half what Pickens sought.
   Aside from seeking four seats on the 20-member board, Pickens
has proposed an anti-greenmail resolution; an annual statement on
whether Koito has been forced to engage in anti-competitive
activities; an annual shareholder vote on salary and retirement
benefits of board members; an annual report on pricing policies; a
further increase in the dividend, and an accounting of the
``shito-fumeikin fund,'' which Pickens suggests amounts to an

<HEAD>Coming to Your Local Sears: $999 IBM Computer for the Home</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   IBM today launched its second assault on the
home computer market, a drive to tap the millions of Americans it
says want a home machine but have been scared by the technology.
   The computers will be priced as low as $999 and, in a departure
for the world's largest computer company, will be sold at
mainstream retailers such as Sears, Roebuck and Co., Dillards
Department Stores and Dayton's Department Stores.
   The machines were designed for people who have gained some
knowledge of computers through their work but don't want to learn
all the technical terms and concepts associated with them.
   International Business Machines Corp. believes the potential
audience is huge, said Skip Gladfelter, marketing manager for the
new line.
   ``We think there are millions of families sitting on the
sidelines,'' he said in an interview Monday.
   The computers, called the Personal System-1 line, will go on
sale today in stores in the Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth and
Minneapolis-St. Paul areas, IBM said. The national rollout will
come in September.
   IBM's first assault on the home market turned into a bitter
failure. Production of the machines _ dubbed the PCjr _ was halted
about a year and a half after they were launched in 1983.
   PCjr was criticized for a toylike keyboard, limited memory and a
too-steep price.
   This time around, IBM executives say they plan to succeed. Their
first step was to determine what went wrong with PCjr.
   ``We all got Ph.D.s in PCjr,'' said Robert Amezcua, product
manager for the new PS-1 line.
   Then a group of about 50 IBM employees in Lexington, Ky., began
trying to figure out what consumers wanted, Gladfelter said.
   Since the fall of 1988, about 3,000 consumers had a say in the
new line's design through interviews and participation in focus
groups, he said.
   Among the features requested was ease of use, a low price,
sufficient computing power to handle popular office-computer
software and availability at non-computer stores, he said.
   Like the more expensive Macintosh from Apple Computer Inc., the
PS-1 line can be set up in minutes. Also like the Mac, the
computers feature graphics and a hand-held device called a mouse,
which manipulates an arrow on-screen to let users to chose the
function they want to run.
   The computers are built around the Intel Corp. 80286
microprocessor, used in millions of office computers. They also use
the popular DOS operating system, making them compatible with
thousands of applications programs for home and office use.
   Each machine contains a built-in modem, which allows computers
to hook up to distant computers or data services via phone lines.
   One such service, jointly owned by IBM and Sears, is Prodigy. It
provides such things as home banking, shopping and airline
reservations. The PS-1 line contains a built-in program that
provides an automatic linkup to Prodigy.
   The computers also include a popular software package from
Microsoft Corp. that combines a word processor, a spreadsheet, a
database program and a communications program to run the modem.
   The two cheapest PS-1s lack a hard disc, which is used to store
many of the programs on the two high-end models. That means users
of these models must insert a diskette containing the software
after they turn on the machine. On the more expensive models, the
programs automatically are pulled off the hard disc when the
computers are turned on.
   Two of the models have black-and-white screens, while the other
two offer color. The most expensive model, with a suggested retail
price of $1,999, has more memory in addition to the hard disc and
color monitor.
   All four machines feature full-size keyboards. But none has a
printer, which computer industry consultant Sam Albert said could
be a drawback for some potential purchasers.
   Industry analysts say that although many families may want a
home computer, it may compete on a wish list with other expensive
electronics devices, such as camcorders, laser disc players and
large-screen TVs.
   Analysts also say IBM may have a rough time marketing the
computers as consumer spending is declining due to economic
uncertainty.
   Albert, a former IBM executive, said IBM may have solved the
ease-of-use problem, but it still needs to show consumers why they
need a home computer, ``besides keeping up with the Joneses.''

   Here are sales results for the 10 major U.S.
automakers for second period of June 1990.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were nine selling days in the period this year and eight
selling days last year, and 145 selling days so far this year,
compared with 144 selling days in the year earlier period.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda, Subaru, Isuzu and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic
and appear in this table separately and combined as transplant cars.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and
trucks are reported at the end of each month.

<HEAD>Big Three Sales Trail in Mid June</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The sluggish economy continued to dampen the
automobile market as sales of North American-made cars and trucks
fell 3.6 percent in mid-June from the same period last year.
   And once again, the Big Three automakers bore the full brunt of
the slowdown as transplant vehicles, made in U.S. plants by
Japanese companies, snapped up whatever sales gains were to be
found.
   Continuing incentive programs failed to stem the weak sales
trend at General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.,
said automotive analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   ``We are still unable to bloody the nose of the imports,'' he
said.
   Overall, domestic automakers said they sold vehicles at an
average daily rate of 37,962 during the June 11-20 period, compared
with an average of 39,392 a day during the same period last year.
   Car sales trailed by 4.5 percent and light truck sales lagged
2.2 percent.
   GM, Ford and Chrysler said their combined mid-June sales dropped
6.8 percent to an average daily rate of 34,655 from 37,192 last
year.
   Sales of U.S.-made cars with Japanese nameplates jumped 54.7
percent to an average daily rate of 2,854. Honda and Toyota paced
the Japanese makers with increases of more than 60 percent.
   For the year through June 20, North American-made car and truck
sales ran 4.4 percent behind last year's, with car sales trailing
5.7 percent and light truck sales down 2.1 percent.
   The decline was despite a 40.4 percent rise in transplant car
sales.
   ``I'm hearing more people starting to use the ``R'' word,
meaning recession, with respect to the fact that the economy is
just sort of muddling along,'' Phillippi said. ``Not a bad one, but
just modestly in that gray area of being in a recession.''
   Chrysler reported the sharpest drop, with mid-June vehicle sales
15.5 percent behind last year's pace. Car sales dropped 18.3
percent. Sales of light trucks, including the minivans that provide
much of the company's profits, dropped 12.9 percent.
   For the year, Chrysler's car and light truck sales trailed last
year's pace by 13.2 percent, with car sales down 18 percent and
truck sales down 8.5 percent.
   GM said combined mid-June car and truck sales were off 6.2
percent. Car sales were down 7.8 percent and light trucks sales
were down 2.9 percent.
   For the year, GM said it sold 4.8 percent fewer vehicles than a
year earlier. Car sales were down 7.5 percent and truck sales were
up 0.6 percent.
   Ford reported a 2.8 percent mid-June drop in car and truck
sales. Car sales lagged 7.4 percent while truck sales were up 4
percent.
   Ford said its vehicle sales were down 8.4 percent for the year,
with cars off 12.4 percent and trucks down 2.4 percent.

<HEAD>DAT Sales Kickoff Revives Fight Over Royalties, Copying</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of Sony Corp.'s new digital audio tape
decks are off to a strong start, but not everybody's happy.
   Songwriters fear the machines _ which allow consumers to make
near-perfect pirate copies of compact disks _ will rob them of
royalties.
   ``We will seek court relief from the equipment being brought
into this country,'' said Edward Murphy, president of the National
Music Publishers Association in New York.
   A version of the DAT recorder has been sold in Japan and some
parts of Europe since 1987, and has been available through
unofficial channels in the United States.
   But manufacturers held back from launching the machines openly
in this country because of a dispute over copying. In a concession
to record companies, the manufacturers agreed to offer machines
that can make only copies of CDs, not copies of copies.
   Sony became the first to offer popular priced recorders to
American consumers Friday. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. _ the
Japanese firm that produces the Panasonic, Technics and Quasar
brands _ hopes to have a competitively priced DAT recorder in U.S.
stores by September, a spokesman said.
   Sony's DTC-75ES, priced at $950, includes circuitry that
``flags'' digital tapes copied from compact disc to prevent the
tapes from being copied. Including that technology was part of an
agreement between manufacturers and the recording industry that
seemed to remove the threat of lawsuits from record companies.
   But the accord, and bills in the House and Senate that would
write the agreement into law, did not resolve the festering issue
of royalty payments for home taping.
   George David Weiss, representing the Copyright Coalition, told a
Senate subcommittee two weeks ago that the Senate bill ``forces
songwriters to give away copies of our music without payment of any
kind.''
   Murphy said his group was collecting information on the models
available or soon to hit the U.S. market to prepare for legal
action.
   ``We have several legal options. We will pursue some form of
legal remedy,'' Murphy said, without elaborating.
   The debate apparently didn't hamper sales in the first weekend.
   ``I don't think people stormed the doors, but it was generally
very successful,'' said Shari Haber, spokeswoman for Sony in Park
Ridge, N.J.
   Manny Couto, sales manager at a Sound Advice store in Miami,
said interest in the decks was ``tremendous.''
   ``It took our company, which is represented in Florida with 17
stores, three days to sell out of about 40 pieces,'' Couto said.
``A lot of people bought. A lot of people are looking.''
   In Portland, Ore., and Seattle, Magnolia Hi-Fi was the only
store to carry the DTC-75ES. Another version selling for about $50
less, the DTC-700, will be available in more stores this week.
   Dave Kaplan, vice president-purchasing for Magnolia, said he
sold one-third of his machines over the weekend without advertising.
   ``We got off to a pretty good start with the DAT machine,''
Kaplan said.
   He would not say how many machines his store received, calling
it proprietary information. Magnolia sold the machines for $900, he
said.
   Chris Brezil, the manager at Stereo Exchange in New York, said
he sold his first shipment of ``five to 10'' digital audio tape
machines before they arrived.
   ``The response seems to be quite good,'' said Brezil.
   Bill Ramsay, manager at Point Electronics in the Detroit suburb
of Grosse Point Woods, said he's trying to get more even though he
has three of his original four left.
   ``We received tremendous promotional support from Sony and we
just haven't taken advantage of it yet,'' Ramsay said. ``We've had
a lot of interest, and we'll sell these without any trouble once
people know they're here.

   International Lease Finance Corp.,
the biggest U.S. aircraft leaser, has agreed to a $1.3 billion
buyout by American International Group Inc. to gain the financial
backing of the insurance giant.
   AIG, the largest U.S. underwriter of commercial and industrial
insurance, also will provide ILFC with $125 million in financing as
part of the deal.
   Analysts and spokesmen for the companies said the deal gives
ILFC financial muscle at a time when it must borrow heavily to
complete an ambitious expansion.
   ``They've found someone with lots of cash, low cost of funds,
and willing to take some greater risk in return for greater
rewards,'' said Daniel A. Hersch, a securities analyst with Bateman
Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. in Los Angeles.
   ILFC has grown strongly in recent years as airlines have relied
more on leasing because of the high cost of and long wait for new
aircraft purchases.
   The company owns 98 jetliners worth more than $3 billion and
averaging only three years of age.
   It also has placed $10 billion worth of firm orders for planes
to be delivered over 10 years, and has another $4 billion in
options. That means ILFC, which has had to borrow heavily and issue
new stock to finance past deals, will need much more capital at a
time when it is harder to come by.
   ``I think that having a strategic alliance with a backer of the
stature and credit-worthiness of AIG should instill a greater
confidence in the financial markets,'' Jay Jacobsen, a spokesman
for ILFC, said in a telephone interview from New York.
   AIG's triple-A debt rating, the highest possible, will enable
ILFC to borrow funds more cheaply to finance new aircraft
purchases, said Maurice R. Greeberg, chairman and chief executive
officer of the New York-based insurer. That's important with the
pricetag for planes reaching as high as $125 million for Boeing's
new 747-400, he said.
   The deal also helps AIG increase its business in financial
services other than insurance, Greenberg said.
   ``It's a perfect fit,'' he said.
   AIG had operating income of about $150 million in financial
services other than insurance last year out of total operating
income of nearly $2 billion, Greenberg said. The company hopes to
boost that figure to close to $500 million in the next couple of
years, he said.
   The buyout price of $32.50 a share is about 15 or 16 times
expected earnings for this year, at the top of the recent trading
range for ILFC stock, Hersch said.
   The stock closed at $26.87{ in over-the-counter trading Monday.
It had sunk as low as $19.37{ in the past year.
   Jacobsen said the stock had been undervalued because of investor
worries over debt, despite the fact that ILFC's purchase agreements
for Boeing and other planes are at extremely good prices.
   ``The asset values were substantially above the stock price,''
he said.
   ILFC's management will be unchanged and the company will
continue to be based in Beverly Hills, operating as a wholly owned
AIG subsidiary. It is 53 percent owned by three men, all of whom
have approved the merger: Leslie L. Gonda, the board chairman;
Steven F. Udvar-Hazy, president and chief executive; and Louis L.
Gonda, executive vice president.
   The definitive agreement has been approved by AIG's executive
committee, by ILFC's directors, and by a special committee of
ILFC's independent directors, the companies said in a joint news
statement.
   Under the deal, ILFC shareholders can receive $32.50 a share in
cash or 50 cents a share plus 0.3 shares of AIG common stock. The
amount of AIG stock to be exchanged can be adjusted depending on
AIG's share price at the time the deal closes.
   ILFC's three controlling owners have agreed to accept AIG stock
for their holdings, Jacobsen said.

<HEAD>Consumer Groups Call for Jeep CJ Investigation</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on general news wires.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three consumer groups are accusing Chrysler
Corp. of withholding evidence of rollover problems in 300,000 Jeep
CJs, but the company and the government say the safety advocates
have nothing new.
   Brandishing a 3-inch-thick pile of internal Chrysler and
American Motors documents, the auto safety advocates filed a
petition Monday for a full-scale federal investigation into the CJ
and Chrysler's actions.
   The Institute for Injury Reduction, the Center for Auto Safety
and Public Citizen turned over the documents, which they said prove
that AMC and Chrysler knew of problems with the CJ-5 and CJ-7. The
papers came from court cases against the CJ.
   Tim Hurd, spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, said the government already had all the material in
its inquiry into the safety of Jeep CJs built by American Motors
between 1971 and 1986. Chrysler took over AMC in 1987.
   ``We are very well acquainted with this vehicle, and we are
reviewing any information which comes to us,'' Hurd said.
   The agency conducted a safety analysis of the CJs a decade ago
and has turned down two previous requests to reopen the
investigation or to conduct a new one, Hurd said.
   Benjamin Kelley of the Institute for Injury Reduction, said the
CJ ``epitomizes the worst in both vehicle safety and manufacturer
indifference. Joan Claybrook of Public Citizen called the CJs
``deathtraps.''
   Representatives of the three consumer groups appeared at a news
conference with a 42-year-old electrician who said he had been
crippled in a Jeep rollover.
   ``I went from a productive member of society to what you see,''
said Ed Keller of Hughesville, Md., who struggled to the podium on
forearm crutches. Keller said a 1981 rollover in a Jeep CJ-5 broke
his back.
   The groups cited problems with a shackle pin on the CJ that
``could induce or aggravate the likelihood of rollover.'' Shackle
pins connect the Jeep body to its suspension system. They also said
the vehicles' rollbars are inadequate to protect drivers in a
rollover.
   Ms. Claybrook, who formerly headed NHTSA, said the CJ-5's high
center of gravity and narrow track give it little resistance to
rolling over.
   She said 203 people died in CJ accidents last year, 75 percent
of them in rollovers. A study cited at the news conference
maintained that the CJ-5 is 20 times more likely to roll over than
an average car and that the CJ-7 is 12 times more likely.
   A videotape played for reporters showed a CJ-5 rolling over as
it swerved at 32 miles per hour on a flat, dry roadway.
   Chrysler responded that the CJ ``is a safe vehicle _ always has
been and still is'' and that the groups' charges ``are hardly worth
responding to again.''
   ``These organizations, which derive significant support from
plaintiffs' attorneys, are simply trying to generate more business
for these supporters,'' the company said in a statement distributed
outside the hotel conference room where the groups announced the
petition.

   The dollar fell against the yen but gained against
the West German mark in European trading this morning.
   Gold prices were lower.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 155.23 yen, down 0.39 yen from
Monday's finish. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 155.00
yen.
   The dollar declined in Tokyo trading mainly because of selling
in an attempt to take profits from its overnight rise in New York,
dealers said. In New York, the dollar closed Monday at 155.40 yen.
   Investors also bought the yen and sold the West German mark to
take profits from the rising West German currency, helping the yen
firm against the dollar today, said Noriaki Ebisui, a dealer with
Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
quotes, included: 1.6800 West German marks, up from 1.6775; 1.4105
Swiss francs, down from 1.4110; 5.6380 French francs, up from
5.6335; 1.8915 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8830; 1,230.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,228.50; and 1.1738 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1792.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7290, down from
$1.7300 late Monday.
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommend price of $353.10 per
ounce Tuesday morning, down from $353.50 bid late Monday.
   In Zurich, gold opened at $352.50 per troy ounce, down from $353
bid late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 59 cents to close at a bid
$352.87 per ounce.
   Silver bullion was quoted at $4.83 a troy ounce, down from $4.85
bid late Monday.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's chief index rebounded
sharply today, while the dollar inched down.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average regained 447.58 points, or
1.44 percent, closing at 31,571.77.
   The index, which lost 570.38 points on Monday, rose in part
Tuesday from arbitrage buying by investors seeking to take profits
from price gaps between the spot and the futures markets, traders
said.
   Yoshio Ogawa, chief trader with Nikko Securities Co., added,
``Stability in the yen and the slip in the yield of the government
bonds reassured investors.''
   The Bank of Japan also bought $1.3 billion worth of Japanese
government bonds today, he said, and investors ``saw the action as
indicating the central bank's policy to allow no further rises in
the nation's short-term interest rates.''
   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 400
million shares, up from Monday's 300 million.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 155.23 yen, down 0.39
yen from Monday's 155.62-yen finish. It opened at 155.30 yen and
ranged between 154.98 yen and 155.43 yen.
   The dollar had gained a total of 1.90 yen in the previous four
trading days.
   The dollar declined in Tokyo trading mainly because of selling
in an attempt to take profits from its overnight rise in New York,
dealers said. In New York, the dollar closed Monday at 155.40 yen,
up from 154.90 yen Friday.
   Investors also bought the yen and sold the West German mark to
take profits from the rising West German currency, helping the
yen's strength against the dollar Tuesday, said Noriaki Ebisui, a
dealer with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   He said, however, that trading was not very active in the
absence of market-affecting news.
   Chemical Bank dealer Akiyoshi Sakai said market players had
little incentive to buy more Japanese currency because of
uncertainties over current trade talks. Japan and the United States
have been having trouble agreeing on how much Japan should spend on
public works to bring down its trade surpluses.
   About $9.37 billion changed hands in spot trading.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 87.12 points as of 5 p.m. from
Monday's 86.91-point close. The yield declined to 7.160 percent
from 7.205 percent the previous day.

<HEAD>Regulators May Make Charges Public Against S&amp;L Officers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Savings and loan regulators are considering
publicly releasing administrative charges against thrift officers,
including one of President Bush's sons, before the cases are judged.
   Timothy Ryan, director of the Treasury Department's Office of
Thrift Supervision, told reporters Monday that in the next week or
two he expected to decide on a policy governing when and if the
agency publicizes such charges.
   House Democrats last week called on him to release
conflict-of-interest charges concerning Neil Bush and Silverado
Banking, Savings and Loan Association of Denver. But, Ryan said he
preferred to set a broad policy rather than decide the matter on
one case.
   Separately, Ryan's agency issued rules aimed at making hundreds
of struggling S&amp;Ls a more attractive investment. Such thrifts will
now be permitted to pay some earnings to stockholders on a sliding
scale, depending on their condition.
   Healthy thrifts can distribute earnings without restriction,
while clearly weak institutions would be barred from paying
dividends without special permission.
   Regulators allege that Neil Bush's interests as an oil and gas
developer in Colorado conflicted with his duties on Silverado's
board. Silverado made loans, which were not repaid, to Bush's
business associates. Bush has denied wrongdoing, but the OTS is
pursuing administrative actions against him.
   Currently, the agency publicizes administrative penalties after
they are imposed; however, it rarely releases the charges while an
accused executive is contesting them. Hearings on charges before
administrative law judges are almost always private.
   Ryan said the new policy could spell out when charges would be
released and hearings conducted in public.
   Historically, regulators have been reluctant to release charges
before they are decided for fear of scaring depositors, he said.
But in the case of an institution already closed by the government,
such as Silverado, there presumably would be less impact on
depositors, Ryan said.
   The new dividend regulation aims to strike a balance between
struggling institutions' need to pay dividends to attract capital
from new investors and their need to retain earnings to build
capital.
   Under the rule, 1,185 thrifts that already meet tough new
capital standards taking effect in 1994 could freely distribute
earnings to shareholders, while 716 that fail current capital
requirements would be barred from paying dividends unless the OTS
approved a special application.
   An additional 612 thrifts that comply with the current standard
but not the future standard could distribute 25 percent to 75
percent of their income, depending on how close they are to meeting
the 1994 rules.
   Ryan announced the policy to the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, the thrift industry's chief trade group. It was his
first public speech since taking office April 9.

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 12.13 points on

trading.

   Analysts said the market benefited from a surge in the bond
market, which rallied this morning on remarks by President Bush
that gave traders hope for falling interest rates.
   Bush, after meeting with congressional leaders, conceded tax
increases will be needed to bring the federal deficit ``under
responsible control.''
   A lower deficit generally means less borrowing by the federal
government and more room for interest rates to fall. Analysts also
say the Federal Reserve would be more inclined to lower interest
rates if Congress approves a package to cut the deficit.
   Analysts also said the stock market was adjusting after losses
Friday and Monday. The market had slipped over concern about higher
interest rates and weaker corporate earnings.
   ``I would generally tend to argue that the declines we have
witnessed were no more important to the market than the selloff we

<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices slipped in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid diminishing
prospects for an extended Midwestern heat wave. Wheat futures rose
slightly.
   The corn and soybean markets fell sharply at the opening, then
recovered somewhat as the market absorbed new weather forecasts,
including the National Weather Service's latest six-to-10-day
outlook.
   That forecast, released late Monday, predicts near-normal
temperatures for the Midwest during the period July 1-5.
   The NWS forecast and similar projections by private
meteorologists reduced fears of an extended heat wave that helped
drive corn and soybean futures up sharply Monday.
   ``For the moment, the excitement is out of here,'' said John
Frazier, director of the agricultural trading division of Gerald
Inc. in Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent to 3 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in July at $3.34{ a bushel; corn was
} cent to 2 cents lower with July at $2.86 a bushel; oats were \
cent to { cent lower with July at $1.37} a bushel; soybeans were 1}
cents to 5 cents lower with July at $6.11 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .18 cent higher with August at
73.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .13 cent
higher with August at 84.60 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to
.40 cent higher with August at 58.65 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .25 cent to .88 cent higher with July at 57.65 cents a
pound.
   Cattle futures settled mostly lower Monday while hog futures
advanced and pork bellies fell sharply.

<TEXT>
   President Bush has decided to impose long
delays in offshore oil leasing off California and Florida,
according to an administration official. The White House was
preparing an announcement later today.
   The delay in granting new leases for offshore oil drilling would
apply to one large area off south Florida, one region off Southern
California and one off Northern California, the offical said.
   Moratoriums of up to a decade would be imposed in most of the
area under consideration, said the official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Administration sources said earlier that Bush wanted to
forestall new oil drilling in those areas pending more study on
potential impact to the environment.
   The area covered by the decision includes a 6.7-million-acre
section of ocean off Southern California, 1.2 million acres off
Northern California, and 13 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico
near the Florida everglades.
   Officials have said Bush was leaning toward imposing the longest
waiting period off the Florida Keys _ until the year 2002 or beyond.
   Bush named a task force last year, headed by Interior Secretary
Manuel Lujan, to work with the National Academy of Sciences in
studying the environmental impact of opening the three areas to new
leasing.
   The task force concluded that more study of the environmental
effects was needed. Bush has repeatedly stated his wish to protect
environmentally sensitive areas, but also has said the nation
should not have to depend on foreign oil.
   Bush postponed announcing a decision in the wake of a recent
massive tanker spill off Galveston, Texas. A Norwegian tanker was
rocked by an explosion June 8, spilling 3.9 million gallons of oil.
It created a 30-mile oil slick some 18 miles offshore. Most of it
was skimmed off, burned, or evapaorated.
   The entire Florida congressional delegation and most of the
California delegation have urged delays in new leasing. Republicans
were especially sensitive to political fallout likely from any
decision to open new oil-drilling regions in an election year.

   President Bush said today that ``tax revenue
increases'' must be included in any deficit-reduction package that
the White House works out with congressional negotiators.
   Bush's initial statement did not provide specifics on taxes, but
Democrats immediately hailed it as presidential acceptance for a
tax increase.
   ``The president has concluded that tax increases are necessary
and we share the president's view,'' said Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, who, along with other congressional
leaders, met with the president.
   ``We are not willing to give it any definition,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said of Bush's statement. ``That's a
matter for the negotiators.''
   ``No decision has been made with respect to any specific
measures,'' Mitchell agreed.
   The president issued the statement as he met at the White House
with top congressional leaders to review the sluggish negotiations
on a plan to reduce the deficit.
   Bush also called for cuts in spending for federal benefits as
well as other domestic and defense programs, and said congressional
leaders agreed with him.
   Fitzwater and congressional leaders said the talks would resume
Wednesday with the hope that they might be completed by the time
lawmakers take their August recess.
   Deficit estimates have increased substantially since Bush
unveiled his proposed 1991 budget in January and red ink may total
more than $200 billion in the next fiscal year.
   Until now, when asked whether the president would accept higher
taxes, Bush and his aides have repeatedly said that they have
stopped using Bush's campaign pledge of ``No new taxes.''
   At a news conference, congressional Democratic leaders refused
to say whether they thought he had broken his campaign pledge.
   However, they also made clear they thought the political
landscape had changed.
   ``Someone who is complaining about taxes being raised in the
budget summit will have to complain against both parties and the
president if they wish to make that kind of complaint,'' said House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
   Other elements that Bush said must be included in a
deficit-reduction plan were cuts in federal benefit programs, other
domestic initiatives and defense; reforms in the federal budget
process and ``growth incentives.''
   The term growth incentives is often used to describe a reduction
in the capital gains tax, which Bush has fought for since taking
office last year. The president says such a cut would stimulate
economic growth, while opponents say it would simply be a gift to
the wealthy, who own most of the real estate and other property
that would qualify for the reduction.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, called Bush's statement ``an important step in the right
direction.''
   ``It is clear to me that any program comprehensive enough to
make a significant dent in the deficit will have to include both
spending cuts and tax increases,'' said Rostenkowski, D-Ill., who
did not attend the meeting with Bush. ``I am pleased that the
president shares that view.''
   The fiscal 1991 budget Bush unveiled in January contained $19.7
billion in new taxes, user fees and other revenues. Some
congressional leaders have complained throughout seven weeks of
budget negotiations that that amount is insufficient to take a
serious bite out of the deficit.
   The Gramm-Rudman law will trigger widespread spending cuts on
Oct. 1 _ the start of fiscal 1991 _ unless the gap is kept to $74
billion or less.
   In his statement, Bush also said he agreed that ``orderly
reductions in defense expenditures'' were needed. But he did not
specify the amount of cuts he would favor.
   Bush has proposed reducing defense spending next year by $3
billion below what it have grown to if it kept pace with inflation.
Congressional Democrats would like the cut to be about $10 billion
or more.
   Bush held a morning meeting at the White House with House
Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash.; Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine; House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.;
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and House Minority Leader
Robert Michel, R-Ill.
   A budget bargaining session between White House and
congressional representatives set for Monday was canceled. No
further meetings were scheduled.
   The cancellation came four days after the last negotiating
session, which ended with Democrats rejecting the administration's
$51 billion deficit-reduction proposal for next year as inadequate.

<HEAD>Continental Bank Corp. Eliminates 900 Jobs in Cost-Cutting Move</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Bank Corp. said today it is
eliminating about 900 jobs and several product lines as part of
cost-cutting measures expected to save $75 million a year.
   The bank holding company said it anticipated a second-quarter
loss as a result of the moves.
   Continentnal said it would no longer engage in futures and
options execution and clearing, a business the company began to
exit with the sale of Securities Settlement Corp. last year.
   Continental also said it plans to sell First Options of Chicago
Inc.
   The bank holding company already has announced in Tokyo it would
discontinue trading U.S. Treasury securities and foreign exchange
trading for its own account there.
   The company said it will establish a special pretax reserve of
$50 million to cover the cost of eliminating the various product
lines. Establishment of the reserve will result in a loss for the
second quarter, Continental said.
   Jobs being eliminated include positions in trading, marketing
and support staff, said Continental spokesman Ted McDougal.
   About one-third of the staff reductions will take place outside
of Chicago, most of them overseas, McDougal said.
   Before the cuts began, the company had 6,720 employees,
excluding First Options' 700 workers.
   The cuts are expected to result in a savings of $25 million in
the second half of this year, and $75 million annually beginning in
1991, Continental said.
   The company said its goal is to increase revenue and reduce
expenses to achieve ``its longstanding financial goals of a 30
percent operating margin and return on common equity of 15
percent.''
   ``Continental's product review reflects the realities of the
marketplace,'' said Chairman Thomas C. Theobald. ``It's a market
reality that a client needs change over time.
   ``We aren't altering our corporate and institutional strategy.
All we're doing is aligning our services with the customers'
changing demands,'' Theobald said.

<DATELINE>FORT WAYNE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co. is
acquiring a 9.6 percent stake in Lincoln National Corp., the
biggest investment yet by a Japanese insurer in a U.S. insurance
company, Lincoln announced Tuesday.
   Dai-Ichi will acquire the stake in Fort Wayne-based Lincoln
National through a $312 million convertible preferred stock
transaction.
   The two companies also will enter into a series of business
relationships to offer investment management services, reinsurance,
pension products and group health products, Lincoln National said
in a news release.
   ``This is a very attractive arrangement for both Lincoln
National and Dai-Ichi Mutual Life,'' said Ian M. Rolland, president
and chief executive officer of Lincoln National. ``It offers
strategic opportunities for both of our companies.''
   Dai-Ichi Mutual Life is the world's third largest insurance
company. It reported assets of $110 billion and revenue of $23
billion in its fiscal year ended March 31.
   Lincoln National reported assets of $25.1 billion and revenue
exceeding $8.1 billion in the year ended Dec. 31.
   The companies will exchange trainees to improve understanding of
their respective markets, Rolland said.
   ``We are hopeful this will give Lincoln National greater
visibility in the international equity markets and provide better
business opportunities, particularly in Japan,'' he said.
   The agreement, which must be approved by federal regulators,
calls for Dai-Ichi to purchase a 5 percent share of Lincoln
National through the first series of convertible preferred stock
and a 4.6 percent share through a second series within a year.
   ``We think Lincoln National is a highly regarded and soundly
managed company,'' said Takahide Sakurai, president of Dai-Ichi
Mutual Life Insurance Co., in a statement from Tokyo. ``This
transaction offers us a good investment opportunity.''
   Lincoln National and Dai-Ichi entered into a reinsurance
agreement in 1987. The two companies' relationship dates to visits
by Dai-Ichi officials to Fort Wayne almost 30 years ago, Rolland
said.
   ``This is an alliance for two companies who are familiar with
each other's strengths and values,'' he said. ``We both believe
that good customer service is vital. We both believe that sound
investment practices are the key to our businesses.
   ``And we both believe that future growth and prosperity relies
upon our finding new opportunities in our industry.''

   U.S. and Japanese negotiators tackled Japanese
pricing mechanisms and American shortfalls in savings and
investment today as talks on structural trade problems moved into
their second day.
   Although the talks originally were scheduled to end today, they
were continuing into the night and appeared likely to extend
through Wednesday.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said in a speech Monday to
a Washington trade conference sponsored by the Institute for
International Economics it may be necessary to hold another round
of talks on broad reforms to reduce Japan's $49 billion surplus in
trade with the United States.
   ``We will continue to talk until the job is done. If there needs
to be another meeting, so be it,'' she said.
   Hills warned there could be a backlash against Japanese imports
in the United States if the trade talks fail to expand foreign
business opportunities in Japan.
   ``Japan isn't open and until we get that parity of opportunity
we will have an enormous buildup of antagonism that creates a
backdrop for very bad public policy,'' she said.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said the talks were
``very intensive'' and he welcomed comments Monday by U.S.
officials that the talks had been friendly and cooperative.
   ``This underlines that our response has been very positive,''
Watanabe said.
   Nonetheless, the two sides had failed to agree on the level to
which Japan would increase spending on public works.
   Watanabe said Tuesday's session opened with a discussion of why
Japan tends to have higher prices than the United States on similar
products.
   In the afternoon, he said, the negotiators covered such problems
on the U.S. side as the government budget deficit, low savings and
investment rates, excessive consumption, low competitiveness of
U.S. products and poor training of U.S. workers.
   ``Our position is that the U.S. side also has some tasks,'' he
said.
   Such basic factors in the two countries' economic systems are
among many topics in the so-called Structural Impediments
Initiative talks, launched last September. Japanese and U.S.
negotiators agreed on an interim report in April that both sides
hailed as a strong step toward a final pact.
   But since then, Washington has said Tokyo was not following
through fully on a pledge to increase public works spending. And on
Tuesday, Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto reportedly
said Washington apparently was ducking the problem of the huge U.S.
government budget deficit.
   Kyodo News Service said Hashimoto told reporters after a Cabinet
meeting that the United States had said in the interim report it
would eliminate its budget deficit by 1993, but the pledge did not
appear in Washington's draft of the final report.
   Later, senior U.S. officials said they had told the Japanese
side Washington wants to look beyond eliminating the budget deficit
by 1993, and to envision a budget surplus.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, they said there had been a
``good exchange'' of views Tuesday, but did not indicate whether
agreements had been reached on any of the areas under discussion.
   The U.S. budget deficit is regarded as a spur to U.S.
consumption that increases demand for Japanese imports and thus
contributes to the trade imbalance. At the same time, U.S. savings
and investment levels are lower than Japan's. That means greater
modernization for Japanese industry, increasing its advantage in
efficiency.
   An increase in Japanese public spending is expected to boost
imports and soak up some savings. The two countries disagreed over
how high the increase should be, with the Americans asking for 500
trillion yen, or $3.22 trillion, over the next 10 years. Japanese
officials indicated they favored spending between 400 trillion and
415 trillion yen, or $2.58 trillion to $2.68 trillion.
   Among other things, Japan has agreed to ease restrictions on
opening large retail stores, revise land use policies to curb high
land prices, speed up processing of patent applications, crack down
on allegedly unfair business practices by corporate groups, and
open complicated pricing mechanisms. All the measures are thought
likely to increase foreign opportunities for trade and investment
in Japan.

was little siggnificant buying by institutions to support the
rally, dealers said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 1.3

<HEAD>Maxwell Communication Posts Annual Profit of 101.1 Million Pounds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maxwell Communication Corp. PLC, the British
publishing and communications concern, said Tuesday it had a profit
of 101.1 million pounds, or about $175 million at current exchange
rates, in its latest fiscal year.
   Robert Maxwell, chairman and chief executive, said the results
were ``highly satisfactory'' for a year which saw the company
complete its move out of printing and into international publishing.
   He said the company hopes to raise $950 million from further
asset sales to reduce debt, but declined to identify what
properties are for sale.
   In reporting its results for the year ended March 31, the
company provided for comparison results from a 15-month period
ended March 31, 1989 when it said it earned 190 million pounds. The
company has changed to operating on a fiscal year rather than
calendar year basis.
   The latest profit figure reflected an extraordinary loss of 25.7
million pounds, or $44 million, in the latest year resulting from
the sale of the last of the company's printing businesses. The
latest figures were converted to dollars at the current exchange
rate of $1.73 to the pound.
   In the previous 15-month period, the company had an
extraordinary gain of 42 million pounds.
   Sales were 1.24 billion pounds, or $2.1 billion, for the latest
year, and 1.39 billion pounds for the previous 15 months.
   The company said its pre-tax profit was 172.3 million pounds, or
$298 million, compared with a pre-tax profit of 192 million pounds
in the previous 15-month period. It said its pre-tax profit rose 12
percent on an annualized basis.
   The company completed a series of U.S. acquisitions including
the 1988 purchase of the publisher Macmillan Inc. in recent years.
   Maxwell said the company now derives about 80 percent of sales
and operating profit from North America.
   Maxwell said that the company had borrowings of 2.1 billion
pounds, or $3.6 billion, or March 31 compared with 2.7 billion
pounds in September.

<HEAD>TWA Plans To Sell Four Jets, End Service to Seven Cities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trans World Airlines Inc. plans to sell four
jets by the end of the month, cut back its flight schedule and end
service to seven cities by Oct. 1, a top official told the
airline's pilots.
   In a letter to the members of the TWA branch of the Air Line
Pilots Association, TWA Chief Operating Officer William Hoar said
the company ``cannot and will not allow TWA to bleed to death.''
   ``Left with no choice, we can no longer delay our decision to
either grow or downsize,'' he said
   TWA owner Carl Icahn has said in recent months he would shrink
or dismantle the airline unless the pilots agreed to pay cuts and
other concessions. Icahn has said he would modernize and expand the
airline if the pilots agreed.
   Icahn has said that 10 percent pay cuts and other concessions
would save the airline $80 million a year.
   Hoar said the moves were being forced by pilots' resistance. He
said union leaders Kent Scott and Bill Compton had made misleading
statements about TWA's financial condition to create panic in the
ranks and build support for an employee buyout.
   ``These ambitious pilots have decided that they want to control
TWA and will go to almost any length to attain that goal,'' he
wrote in the letter, dated Friday.
   Scott on Tuesday called Hoar's comments ``ridiculous. ... ``It's
pure fantasy and an obvious divisive tactic.'' He said the pilots
union had never been interested in buying the airline in its
current financial situation.
   TWA, whose hub is in St. Louis, lost $298.5 million last year,
largely because of burdensome interest payments on its $2.7 billion
in debt. The airline lost $143 million in the first three months of
1990.
   Hoar's letter said TWA would end service to seven cities and
reduce its flight schedule by 7 percent on Oct. 1. The seven cities
have not yet been identified, but Scott said they probably would
include Nassau and Freeport in the Bahamas, and Syracuse, N.Y.
   Hoar also said the airline would sell four jets _ two Boeing
747s, one Lockheed L-1011 and one Boeing 727 _ by the end of June.
At least four more Boeing 727s will be sold in the next quarter, he
said.
   TWA previously had announced it was eliminating the two 747s and
the L-1011 from its fleet, but didn't say when. The 727s are among
a group of 20 that the airline put on the market earlier this month.
   Hoar said TWA still was trying to find buyers for the other 15
727s. He also confirmed that the airline was negotiating to sell
gates and operating slots at LaGuardia Airport in New York and
National Airport in Washington D.C.
   TWA will not need all of its gates and slots at those airports
after it cuts back its flight operation in October, he said.
   ``This is not the direction I want to see TWA going and more
importantly, it is not what has to be,'' Hoar wrote. ``We can
stabilize and grow this company together.''
   Hoar said the company planned to obtain new jets to replace its
old ones if the union would help reduce overhead and improve
efficiency.
   TWA, which is based in Mount Kisco, N.Y., has been negotiating
for several months to acquire 70 Airbus Industrie A-320s but will
not complete the deal without concessions, Hoar said.
   TWA also has talked with McDonnell Douglas Corp. and several
leasing companies about adding more MD-80s to its fleet and has
determined that some jets will be available within a few months, he
said.
   Hoar also said TWA was looking at other possibilities for
strengthening its competitive position, including building or
buying a hub in the eastern United States; merging with another
airline or buying another airline; adding domestic and
international flights from St. Louis; and expanding into the Soviet
Union, Eastern Europe and the Pacific.

   President Bush today barred new oil leasing
off much of California and Florida, the North Atlantic coast,
Washington and Oregon until after the year 2000.
   ``Further steps to protect the environment are needed,'' he said.
   Bush also canceled planned government oil lease sales in an area
stretching south from San Francisco to Monterey Bay and said he
would permanently block any drilling in a 2,200-square-mile
proposed marine sanctuary that lies within that region.
   However, Bush said tracts in the Santa Maria Basin and Santa
Barbara Channel of Southern California would be available for
leasing consideration at the beginning of 1996 if studies show the
environment can be protected there.
   Southern California is the only area involved in Bush's decision
today where oil drilling is now going on.
   ``The combined effect of these decisions is that the coast of
southwest Florida and more than 99 percent of the California coast
will be off limits to oil and gas leasing and development until
after the year 2000,'' Bush said.
   Lisa Speer, senior staff scientist for the Natural Resources
Defense Council, called Bush's decision ``a major step in the right
direction.'' But she said ``it falls short in several crucial
respects.''
   Environmentalists want a permanent ban imposed on offshore
drilling. Spear complained that Bush did not address some areas
where lease sales are upcoming, including the Mid-Atlantic coast,
North Carolina, New Jersey, Alaska's Bristol Bay, and northern
Florida.
   In the case of Florida, where the government already has sold 73
leases to oil firms in an area off the Florida Keys, Bush said he
is directing Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan to begin a process
that ``may lead to the buyback and cancellation of existing
leases.''
   Further, he said, ``Any development after the year 2000 would be
pursued only if it appears viable based on the guiding principles''
of environmental protection, energy needs and significant potential
for oil production.
   ``We will work with the state of Florida to buy back existing
leases in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico off the southern tip of
Floria,'' said Lujan.
   Barry A. Williamson, director of the department's Minerals
Management Service, estimated the lease buybacks would cost between
$100 million and $200 million.
   Republican Gov. Bob Martinez of Florida previously has rejected
any state responsibility to buy back leases sold by the federal
government.
   Along the New England coast, Bush announced a delay that
administration officials already had signaled. He said a sale of
leases in the Georges Bank area east of Cape Cod, Mass., will be
canceled until at least 2000.
   ``This will allow time for additional studies to determine the
resource potential of the area and address the environmental and
scientific concerns which have been raised,'' Bush said in his
statement.
   Georges Bank, an underwater plateau that is about 175 miles long
and lies 50 to 150 miles east of Cape Cod, is one of the world's
richest fisheries. Congress has protected the region from oil
drilling for the past several years by imposing moratoriums.
   Earlier this year, representatives of Washington and Oregon,
federal agencies and Indian tribes negotiated an agreement that
would cancel a Northwestern lease sale planned for 1992 and call
for about seven years of environmental studies.
   They submitted the agreement to Lujan. The administration had
not formally responded before today.
   In California, Bush's long-awaited decision calls for canceling
all planned government sales in Northern California, and in
Southern California south of the Santa Barbara Channel, so new
oceanographic and scocioeconomic studies can be conducted. These
areas could not be considered for new leases until after 2000.
   The decision closely follows the recommendation of a task force
Bush appointed to study the oil exploration question last year. It
recommended that more studies be conducted in California and
Florida before new oil-producing activity be allowed.
   Bush said he had received the report of the interagency Outer
Continental Shelf Task Force on Leasing and Development off the
coasts of Florida and Califronia, and had ``accepted its
recommendation that futher steps to protect the environment are
needed.''
   Although the task force was not charged with studying Oregon and
Washington and the Georges Bank, the administration expanded the
decision to include those regions.
   The Interior Department estimated the total potential oil
resources for the areas affected by the decision at 8.2 million
barrels, with proven reserves of 2.6 million barrels.
   Bush also announced he will revise the process by which the
government conducts offshore leasing to:
   _ More carefully target ``areas with truly promising resource
potential.''
   _ Ensure environmental protection where oil drilling is allowed.
   _ Take into account the ``concerns and needs of local areas
affected by offshore development.''
   The administration will propose congressional legislation to
give local communities more of a voice in the plans for oil
development off their coasts and to provide them ``with a greater
share of the financial benefits of new development.''
   Bush postponed announcing a decision on oil-leasing in the wake
of a recent massive tanker spill off Galveston, Texas. A Norwegian
tanker was rocked by an explosion June 8, spilling 3.9 million
gallons of oil. It created a 30-mile oil slick some 18 miles
offshore. Most of it was skimmed off, burned, or evapaorated.
   The entire Florida congressional delegation and most of the
California delegation have urged delays in new leasing. Republicans
were especially sensitive to political fallout likely from any
decision to open new oil-drilling regions in an election year.

<HEAD>Boone Co. Set for Showdown With Japanese Business Culture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 50 shareholders in T. Boone Pickens' private
investment firm arrived Tuesday to join the Texas oilman and
takeover strategist in his battle with the Japanese business
establishment.
   Officially, the fight is for managerial control of Koito
Manufacturing Co., an auto parts company affiliated with Japan's
largest automaker, Toyota Motor Corp.
   Pickens' firm, Boone Co., owns the largest share in Koito and
Pickens has been demanding, among other things, a corresponding
share of seats on its board of directors.
   Pickens and 52 other Americans own 26 percent of Koito's 160.36
million outstanding shares. They will face their Japanese
counterparts Thursday in an annual shareholders meeting at Koito's
headquarters in central Tokyo.
   The fight has come to symbolize to some Americans the trials
faced by investors in Japan at a time when many Japanese companies
are buying U.S. businesses and property.
   The clash also reflects fundamental differences in how Americans
and Japanese conduct business and accumulate wealth. It is one of
the cases raised by some U.S. officials in urging Japan to reform
its economic policies to encourage more foreign trade and
investment.
   In current talks on reforms in both economies, Japan has
promised to crack down on collusive business practices conducted by
``keiretsu.''
   Keiretsu are corporate families bound by mutual shareholdings
and other financial ties, and by cooperative business strategies.
Many Japanese believe that keiretsu are crucial to Japan's entire
just-in-time system of production and supply, in which parts are
delivered as needed, not stockpiled into costly inventories.
   Koito belongs to the keiretsu surrounding Toyota. The auto
company is its second largest shareholder, after Boone Co., with
about 20 percent of Koito's shares. It also buys about half the
auto lighting equipment Koito sells.
   Critics such as Pickens say the keiretsu tend to exclude
outsiders, especially foreigners. They also say the big-name
companies at the top of the manufacturing pyramid squeeze their
smaller subcontractors mercilessly and deprive shareholders of
their fair share of profits.
   ``While Americans have acquired a taste for many Japanese
products, keiretsu is one thing we will never accept,'' Pickens
told reporters Tuesday.
   ``Of course, there are people who claim that keiretsu are a
major part of Japanese culture and that the rest of the world
should just accept it,'' he said. ``I disagree. A keiretsu is a
cartel is a cartel is a cartel. Whatever you call it, it's wrong.''
   Pickens says he resorted to a public campaign against Koito's
management after top executives of Koito, Toyota and other major
Japanese firms refused to meet with him or accept his proposals.
   ``Give me a chance. Is that an unusual request?'' he said.
``Take me to the backroom. I can't get into the backroom,'' he
added, responding to suggestions that he take a less
confrontational approach in dealing with Japanese business.
   Koito officials accuse Pickens of acting as a front for Japanese
investor Kitaro Watanabe, who they say has twice tried to greenmail
them.
   Greenmailers buy large amounts of a company's stock in an effort
to force the company to buy the shares back at a premium to
maintain control.
   Pickens does not deny he may have a relationship with Watanabe.
But he refuses to disclose any details of the financing involved in
his purchase of the Koito shares from Watanabe.
   Shareholders on Thursday will vote on Picken's request for four
seats on Koito's 20-member board and his proposals for an
anti-greenmail resolution; an annual statement on whether Koito has
engaged in anti-competitive activities; an annual shareholder vote
on salary and retirement benefits of board members; an annual
report on pricing policies; a further increase in the dividend, and
an accounting of what Pickens suggests amounts to an illegal slush
fund.
   Pickens said he had received proxies from more than half of
individual Koito shareholders, who hold a total of about 4 million
shares in the company, indicating support for his proposals.
   Koito's board has rejected all Pickens' proposals as unnecessary.

   The stock market headed higher today,
strengthening on President Bush's remark that tax increases will be
needed to reduce the deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 12.13 points on
Monday, was up 6.68 points to 2,851.73 at 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 6 to 5 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 750 up, 666 down and 519 unchanged.
Volume on the Big Board came to 117.45 million shares with an hour
of trading left.
   Bush said this morning that higher tax revenues were necessary
to assure the deficit ``is brought under responsible control.'' His
statement was issued as he met with congressional leaders at the
White House.
   Prices for bonds and stocks increased on the news, reflecting
investor optimism that it meant the deficit could decline and ease
pressure on interest rates by lowering the amount of money the
federal government must borrow.
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up more than 22 points in
the first half-hour of trading, but fell back by early afternoon as
some of the weight of Bush's remark wore off.
   ``As time has gone on, I think the impact of that has
lessened,'' said Gordon L. Smith, managing director of Alex. Brown
&amp; Sons Inc.
   Analysts also said the stock market was adjusting after losses
Friday and Monday. The market had slipped over concern about higher
interest rates and weaker corporate earnings.
   Caterpillar, which led Monday's decline with a 5-point drop,
fell another 6\ to 52\ in heavy trading. Caterpillar said Monday
that the company was expecting sharply lower earnings in the second
quarter.
   IBM was up &rsqb; to 117, as the computer giant launched a home
computer to sell for $999 in mainstream retail stores.
   Among other active issues on the NYSE, Philip Morris was up &lsqb; to
46}; Commonwealth Edison was unchanged at 32{; General Motors was
down | to 47\; and American Express was unchanged at 30{.
   In over-the-counter trading, International Lease Finance Corp.
was up 3| to 30}. Late Monday, the aircraft leasing company said it
had agreed to a $1.3 billion buyout by American International Group
Inc., the nation's largest commercial and industrial insurance
underwriter.
   AIG was down 2&lsqb; to 94\ on the NYSE.
   The NYSE's composite index of all listed common stocks rose .50
to 193.10. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index
was down .46 at 356.93.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybeans Slip as Heat Fears Fade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices closed modestly
lower Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as fears of an extended
Midwestern heat wave faded. Wheat futures advanced slightly.
   Traders took their cues largely from the National Weather
Service's latest six-to-10-day outlook, which predicts normal
temperatures and above-average rain in Midwestern growing regions
from July 1-5.
   Those conditions would be ideal for crop development after
farmers complete their soybean planting in the hot, dry weather
forecast for the rest of this week, analysts said.
   Selling in the corn and soybean markets also reflected selling
to make profits after Monday's steep gains.
   ``A lot of people thought we overdid it yesterday,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the grain-trading
division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.

<HEAD>Japanese Investors No Panacea For Trump's Troubles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As the clock winds down on Donald Trump's immediate
financial problems, the flamboyant landlord and developer faces a
possibly much more lasting problem: How to win back Japanese
investors.
   Japanese doctors, businessmen, even well-paid stewardesses flush
with savings and land riches from sky-high Japanese real estate
prices, led a wave of investment in condominiums and other small
properties in the United States during recent years.
   Trump was one of many who exploited the trend, attracting
Japanese funds to help finance his purchases of apartment
buildings, hotels and casinos. He also has cashed in on the
notorious Japanese preference for brand-name goods.
   But Tokyo real estate agents say an increasing number of
investors are repelled by Trump's highly publicized financial and
marital troubles, his disparaging comments about Japan, and _ most
of all _ high prices for Trump condomiums in the depressed New York
market.
   ``The value of Trump is going down,'' said Wataru Iwamura, a
sales representative for overseas projects at Haseko Corp. The firm
is a Japanese developer and seller of condominiums and a sales
agent for Trump properties.
   ``I think it started from the divorce thing. Now they are
talking about bankruptcy,'' he said. Besides, ``Trump is not saying
good things about Japan. That does not help at all.''
   Not all agents agree. Some say Japanese will continue to buy his
properties for their prime locations, regardless of what happens to
his family life and personal fortune.
   Trump has touted his properties in Japan in person, in print and
on the water. In addition to taking out Japanese-language print
advertising, he appeared in person at a Tokyo hotel to promote his
properties and sent his plush yacht, the Trump Princess, cruising
for a buyer through Japanese waters. The yacht left without taking
down its for-sale sign.
   Trump also has tapped Japanese banks for financing. A report in
the Nippon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's premier financial newspaper,
claimed Trump owed a third of his debts to Japanese banks.
   It was not only relentless self-promotion that drew Japanese
investors to Trump's properties, some agents say.
   ``When he built Trump Tower, at the same time, Japanese were
putting their money into condominiums and Trump had good
condominiums,'' said Seishi Matsuo, general manager of the
international marketing department of Kyodo Advertising Co. The
company is publisher of a magazine for investors in overseas
property.
   ``Japanese are looking for location. At the Trump Tower, the
Trump Parc, the location is very good,'' said Hisao Yamamoto, vice
president of House Port Seiyo, a brokerage that handles Trump
properties.
   Brokers said the slump in the New York real estate market,
rather than Trump's problems, has sent would-be Japanese buyers
looking for more promising buys in other parts of the United
States, such as Seattle and California.
   Interest in Europe also is growing, with the approach of German
unification, the 1992 Common Market consolidation, and the 1992
Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.
   But even if the New York real estate market recovers, some
Japanese buyers will not be interested in the Trump brand name at
current prices. Trump Palace condominums start at $350,000 for a
studio, or about the same price as a one- or two-bedroom apartment
in some other Manhattan buildings.
   ``The Japanese are studying the U.S. real estate. They learned
that Trump property is quite expensive compared to other
(property),'' said Masayuki Kusunoki, of Nomura Real Estate
Development Co.
   But there is a bright side for would-be investors.
   ``He's in a bad position now, so maybe investors could take
advantage of it,'' Iwamura said.

   The stock market edged higher today,
strengthened by President Bush's remark that tax increases will be
needed to help reduce the federal deficit.
   Bush said this morning that higher tax revenues were necessary
to assure the deficit ``is brought under responsible control.'' His
statement was issued after a White House meeting with congressional
leaders.
   Prices for bonds and stocks increased on the news, reflecting
investor optimism that the deficit could decline, easing pressure
on interest rates by lowering the amount of money the federal
government must borrow.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, up more than 22 points in the
first half-hour of trading, fell back by early afternoon as some of
the weight of Bush's remark wore off.
   Analysts also said the stock market was adjusting after losses
Friday and Monday. The market had slipped in the last two sessions
over concern about higher interest rates and weaker corporate
earnings.

<TEXT>
   Japanese and U.S. officials agreed to extend trade
talks after failing Tuesday to reach final agreement on substantial
economic changes aimed at narrowing the trade imbalance between the
countries.
   The meetings, originally were scheduled to end Tuesday, were
extended as negotiators struggled to resolve differences over
specific strategies to dismantle structural trade barriers.
   ``We would have to be extremely efficient to finish the talks
Wednesday,'' a senior Japanese official said, speaking anonymously.
``We have received many comments from the U.S. side on the contents
of our report, and will have to work on it.''
   On Tuesday, second day of the talks, U.S. and Japanese
negotiators discussed Japanese pricing mechanisms and American
shortfalls in savings and investment that hurt the competitiveness
of U.S. industries.
   U.S. officials at the talks said they explained efforts to
tackle the U.S. federal budget deficit, which is seen as one reason
for a shortfall in investment in U.S. industry.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they
told the Japanese that Washington wants to look beyond eliminating
the budget deficit by 1993, and to envision a budget surplus.
   Officials on both sides described the discussions as cooperative.
   Nonetheless, at the end of two days of intensive talks, the two
sides failed to reach agreement on any of the areas under
discussion, including the level of Japan's spending on public
works, officials said.
   Public spending and other basic economic policies are among many
topics in the so-called Structural Impediments Initiative talks,
launched last year.
   Japanese and U.S. negotiators agreed on an interim report in
April that both sides said represented major progress. They have
since been fine-tuning a final report on the talks.
   On Tuesday, officials first discussed reasons why Japan tends to
have higher prices than the United States on similar products.
   They later dealt with problems on the U.S. side, including the
budget deficit, low savings and investment rates, excessive
consumption, low competitiveness of U.S. products and poor training
of U.S. workers.
   ``Our position is that the U.S. side also has some tasks,''
Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said.
   Officials said they were still debating Japan's proposals on
easing restrictions on opening large retail stores, revising land
use policies to curb high real estate prices, speeding up
processing of patent applications, cracking down on allegedly
unfair business practices by corporate groups, and simplifying
complicated pricing mechanisms. All the measures are thought likely
to increase foreign opportunities for trade and investment in Japan.
   The most difficult issue, however, was expected to be Tokyo's
plan to boost spending on public infrastructure such as roads,
parks and sewers. An increase in such spending is expected to boost
imports of construction products and counter Japan's high savings
rate.
   The two countries disagreed over how high the increase should
be, with the Americans asking for 500 trillion yen, or $3.22
trillion, over the next 10 years. Japanese officials indicated they
favored spending between 400 trillion and 415 trillion yen, or
$2.58 trillion to $2.68 trillion.
   Last year, Japanese sales in the United States exceeded U.S.
sales in Japan by $49 billion.

<HEAD>Continental Bank Eliminating 900 Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Continental Bank Corp. said Tuesday it is
eliminating about 900 jobs and some trading operations in
cost-cutting measures expected to save $75 million annually.
   The company also said it would establish a special $50 million
reserve to cover the cost of eliminating the product lines,
resulting in a second-quarter loss.
   As part of its belt-tightening, the company said it no longer
intends to engage in futures and options execution and clearing, a
business Continental began to exit with the sale of the Securities
Settlement Corp. last year. Continental also plans to sell First
Options of Chicago Inc.
   The company already has announced in Tokyo that it will
discontinue trading U.S. Treasury securities and foreign exchange
trading for its own account there.
   Jobs being eliminated include positions in trading, marketing
and support staff, Continental spokesman Ted McDougal said. About
one-third of the staff reductions will take place outside of
Chicago, most of them overseas, he said.
   Reductions began in the second quarter and should almost be
completed by the end of the year, McDougal said. Before the
reductions began, the company had 6,720 employees, not including
First Options' 700 workers.
   Most of the special reserve will cover the costs of providing
assistance to displaced employees, including job search and
severance packages. A smaller percentage will be used to pay for
equipment and facilities no longer needed and any loss on the sale
of certain assets.
   The cuts are expected to result in a $25 million savings in the
second half of 1990 and $75 million a year beginning in 1991,
Continental said.
   Continental Bank Corp. is a Chicago-based bank holding company
which, through its subsidiaries, arranges financing and processes
cash and securities for customers worldwide.

   Energy futures sagged Tuesday in slow trading as
conflicting signals left brokers with little incentive to buy or
sell heavily.
   The contract for August delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, dropped 24 cents to $17.14 a
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It had lost 8
cents on Monday. Other crude contract months also declined.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the July contract
for wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 0.95 cent to 61.32 cents a
gallon, wiping out Monday's gain of 0.90 cent. Contracts for later
delivery also settled lower.
   Wholesale home heating oil for July delivery fell 0.43 cent to
48.49 cents a gallon after gaining 0.26 cent Monday. Contracts for
delivery during August through October also fell.
   In natural gas trading, the August contract closed at $1.507 per
1,000 cubic feet, down from $1.516 Monday.
   Brian Tagler, an energy options specialist at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., said the oil market seems to be stuck in a holding
pattern, with activity winding down before the Fourth of July
holiday.
   ``It sort of drifted lower out of neglect,'' Tagler said.
``We've got all the ingredients for a dead market.''
   Among ingredients that curbed trading interest were weekly
supply and demand statistics, which were due after the market
closed Tuesday. The report was expected to show a bearish buildup
in stocks combined with a modest drawdown.
   Speculation about what might occur at a possible emergency
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on
July 5 made traders reluctant to sell heavily. The possibility that
the cartel might undertake measures to lift the slumping oil market
has put a floor under the market.

   Motorola Inc. said Tuesday it plans to build a
satellite-based cellular phone system that will connect users with
telephones anywhere in the world.
   The system could supplement conventional phone service in
nations where it is poor, such as in Eastern Europe, and provide
mobile phone service in rural areas where it is not offered,
Motorola officials said.
   Target users include traveling business people, passengers of
ships and aircraft, disaster-relief workers and residents of
underdeveloped nations.
   The system, called Iridium, would use a network of 77 satellites
that would receive calls from hand-held telephones resembling
today's cellular phones. The phones would cost as low as $3,000 _
compared with about $400 for today's cheapest cellular phones,
Motorola said.
   The electronics company said it would launch test satellites in
1992, and expected full service to be available as soon as 1996.
   ``We see the potential of Iridium as nothing short of
revolutionary,'' John F. Mitchell, a Motorola vice chairman, told
reporters at a news conference.
   But the system faces several obstacles. Motorola needs
regulatory approval to operate the satellites from various
government groups worldwide. It also must come up with the $2.3
billion it says it will cost to build the system.
   Motorola says it wants to take on four or five partners that
each would provide funding in exchange for a stake in the venture.
In addition, it is envisioned that several of these partners would
be satellite operators that already have the necessary government
operating authority.
   The partners have not been selected, but Motorola said it has
signed agreements with three satellite operators to explore
constructing the system: American Mobile Satellite Corp. of
Washington, D.C., International Maritime Satellite Organization of
London, and Telesat Mobile Inc. of Canada.
   These three satellite groups may become partners in Iridium,
said Durrell W. Hillis, a Motorola vice president who heads the
satellite effort.
   Motorola also said it is negotiating with other potential
partners, including Great Britain's principal phone company,
British Telecommunications PLC, and organizations in Australia,
Hong Kong and Japan.
   Iridium would be connected to existing phone networks. However,
customers probably would not want to use Iridium phones to make
local cellular calls in areas served by existing ground-based
systems because the cost per Iridium call would be much greater,
Hillis said.
   In addition, Iridium phones would not be compatible with
existing or planned ground-based cellular phone networks, so users
could not tap into these networks directly by bypassing the
expensive satellite system.
   As a result, Iridium customers probably would need to carry two
cellular phones while traveling. That could provide a huge
potential new market for Motorola, which already is the world's
largest maker of cellular phones.
   The Schaumburg, Ill.-based company also would make the
communications gear for the satellites and the computerized control
sytstems that would operate them.
   Hillis said Motorola knows of no other similar system in the
works.
   John Pemberton, an analyst with the research firm Gartner Group
of Stamford, Conn., said American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is
believed to be working on plans for a satellite-based cellular
phone system that would use two giant satellites fixed in position
over the Earth. The Iridium satellites would orbit the planet.
   Pemberton said he was impressed with Motorola's plans and called
them achievable. However, he said he believed the system would need
more than 77 satellites to provide sufficient capacity.
   The Iridium system, under development since late 1987, would
operate like a cellular phone network in the sky, passing calls
from one to the other as do the transmission towers located in each
``cell'' of a ground-based cellular phone network.
   The satellites would be located 413 nautical miles above the
Earth, considered a low orbit for satellites. The low orbit would
allow the use of small hand-held phones with tiny antennas rather
than the satellite dishes required to beam signals to existing
satellites.
   The satellites would pass a call around the globe to the
intended recipient. If the recipient has an Iridium phone, he would
receive the call directly; otherwise, the call would connect with a
conventional, land-based phone system to be completed.
   Each Iridium user would be given a personal telephone number.
For someone to reach a user, they would simply dial the number and
would not have to know the user's location, Motorola said.
   Iridium _ named after the 77th element on the periodic table _
would not have the capacity to replace conventional cellular phone
systems in urban areas, Hillis said.
   Motorola has extensive experience in satellite and outer-space
communications. It made the communications equipment for every U.S.
space mission, Hillis said.

<HEAD>Cable Company Asks CBS For Affiliate Status</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In the second such request to a network this
month, Continental Cablevision Inc., asked CBS on Tuesday if it
could become the first cable affiliate in CBS' history and serve
Concord, N.H.
   CBS has ``no comment'' on the request, said CBS spokeswoman
Susan Tick in Los Angeles, where the network's top executives are
attending the annual CBS affiliates convention this week.
   Last week, Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable
system operator, asked NBC to let its systems become NBC affiliates
in some cities that have no NBC-affiliated broadcast station.
   However, that cable company didn't specify which cities it had
in mind. NBC Cable and Business Development president Thomas S.
Rogers said NBC didn't think TCI's request was serious. A TCI
official said it was.
   Frank Anthony, senior vice-president for Continental, the
nation's fourth-largest cable operation, said his company's CBS
proposal wasn't prompted by TCI's earlier action, but ``it helped
us crystallize our thinking.''
   ``Our proposal is much more specific,'' he added. ``We're
talking about a distinct market which does not have a CBS affiliate
in it.''
   New Hampshire is among states with a higher-than-average number
of cable households. According to A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates, 62
percent of its 410,000 television households have cable.
   CBS broadcasts received in Concord now come from CBS affiliates
WHDH-TV in Boston and WGME-TV in Portland, Me., Anthony said.
Concord briefly had a CBS-affiliated UHF station in 1988, but that
outlet went out of business, he said.
   He said his Boston-based company asked to become CBS' affiliate
in Concord because of the network's strength, ``its solid news
operation'' and because CBS ``had already recognized the (Concord)
market as being somewhat underserved.''
   If its request were granted, Continental wouldn't drop the
Boston and Portland affiliate signals from its Concord cable
operation, he said.
   But as a local CBS affiliate, that operation, deriving its
income from local advertising and cable subscriptions, would
function as does as an over-the-air CBS affiliate.
   That includes payments from CBS for carrying the network's
shows, Anthony said.
   Although CBS officials declined comment on Continental's
request, it is doubtful they would grant it.
   Among other things, they have repeatedly said their company has
no interest in cable and that CBS' core business is broadcasting.
   Anthony, who said Continental has yet to receive a reply from
CBS, said network affiliation requests from cable companies could
become commonplace.
   ``I think they could,'' he said. ``But I think for CBS or
anybody else to consider them, they need to be serious proposals''
to serve markets that don't now have network-affiliated stations of
their own.

   The stock market edged downward Tuesday, losing
ground in late trading after rallying on optimism the federal
budget deficit would decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 12.13 points
on Monday, finished down 2.72 points to 2,842.33.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances slightly on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 752 down, 706 up and 529 unchanged. Volume on
the Big Board totaled 141.42 million shares, up from 133.10 million
shares the previous session.
   President Bush said Tuesday morning that higher tax revenues
would be a necessary part of any plan to shrink the deficit. His
statement was issued after a breakfast meeting held with
congressional leaders to review the status of negotiations over the
growing deficit.
   Budget negotiators generally agree they need to reduce the
deficit by $45 billion to $60 billion in the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1.
   Prices for bonds and stocks increased on news of Bush's
statement, as investors gained hope that it meant the deficit may
decline. A lower deficit eases pressure on interest rates by
lowering the amount of money the federal government must borrow.
   ``I think initially, the market rallied very strongly on that
basis,'' said Gordon L. Smith, managing director of Alex. Brown &amp;
Sons Inc. The Dow Jones industrial average swelled by more than 22
points in the first half-hour of trading.
   But it fell back by noon as some of the weight of Bush's remark
wore off, analysts said. A late afternoon selloff pushed the Dow
average and other indices back into negative territory.
   Some analysts said Tuesday's gains were an adjustment after the
market's losses in the last two sessions. The market had slipped
both Friday and Monday over concern about higher interest rates and
weaker corporate earnings.
   Caterpillar lost another 6 on top of Monday's 5-point decline,
falling to 52{ in heavy trading. Caterpillar said Monday it was
expecting sharply lower earnings.
   IBM was up &lsqb; to 116}, after launching a home computer to sell
for $999 in mainstream retail stores.
   Among other actively traded stocks, Philip Morris was up \ to
46~; General Motors was down ~ to 46~; and American Express was
down &lsqb; to 30&rsqb;.
   UAL Corp. was down 5 to 147 in light trading, after falling 3&rsqb;
on Monday. There has been concern that employee unions trying to
buy the airline company will not obtain financing by an August
deadline.
   In over-the-counter trading, International Lease Finance Corp.
was up 3~ to 31. Late Monday, the aircraft leasing company said it
had agreed to a $1.3 billion buyout by American International Group
Inc., the nation's largest commercial and industrial insurance
underwriter.
   AIG was down 2| to 94 on the NYSE.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 169.55 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market declined $4.202 billion, or 0.12
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.13 to 192.47.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell .38 to 413.25, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index slipped .25 to 352.06.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
declined .26 to 455.38. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 356.80, down .59.

   The dollar declined against all major currencies
Tuesday after the markets became pessimistic about Congress
reaching a budget accord, traders said.
   Gold bullion prices fell domestically and overseas on reports of
selling in the Middle East. The reports could not be confirmed.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for June
delivery closed at $350.40 a troy ounce, off $3.40. Later, Republic
National Bank in New York quoted a troy ounce of gold at $350.10,
off $2.70, as of 4 p.m. EDT.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar rose earlier in the day
on reports that President Bush might be ready to ease his
opposition to raising taxes in order to gain a compromise on
reducing the federal budget deficit.
   But the market learned later that Bush's comments were vague,
sending the dollar down, said Walter Simon, a vice president at
Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co. in New York.
   ``What appeared to first be positive turned out negative,'' he
said.
   Simon said the major movement in the currency markets Tuesday
was toward the West German mark, which gained on a statement by the
West German central bank that it would accept higher domestic

relative to other currencies.
   The mark also has been supported by optimism about the outcome

   In Tokyo, the dollar eased to 155.40 Japanese yen from late
Monday's 155.62. In London, the dollar was lower at 155.20 yen.
Later, in New York, the dollar closed at 154.55 yen, down from
155.40 yen late Monday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7360 late Tuesday, more
expensive for buyers than Monday's late rate of $1.7300. In New
York, a pound cost $1.7430, more than the $1.7305 late Monday.
   Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with
Monday's late quotes, included: 1.6618 West German marks, down from
1.6775; 1.3975 Swiss francs, down from 1.4100; 5.5770 French

   Earlier, in Hong Kong, before the Middle East selling reports
emerged, gold closed higher at $353.25 bid, up from $351.05.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $4.79 a troy
ounce, down from $4.85. In New York trading, silver for June

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Futures Slip as Heat Prospects Fade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices fell modestly Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade, giving up some of the previous session's
sharp gains as fears of an extended Midwestern heat wave faded.
   Wheat futures advanced slightly.
   On other commodity markets, cocoa futures surged; energy futures
retreated; livestock and meat futures were mixed; and precious
metals were mixed.
   Soybean futures settled 4\ cents to 6{ cents lower in Chicago
with July at $6.08 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1\ cents lower
with July at $2.85} a bushel; wheat futures were { cent to 3{ cents
higher with July at $3.34 a bushel; oats were 1\ cents lower to {
cent higher with July at $1.37 a bushel.
   Traders took their cues largely from the National Weather
Service's latest six-to-10-day outlook, which predicts normal
temperatures and above-average rain in Midwestern growing regions
during the first half of next week.
   Those conditions would be ideal for crop development after
farmers complete their soybean planting in the hot, dry weather
forecast for the rest of this week, analysts said.
   Corn and soybean futures soared Monday amid fears that the
mostly dry, 90-plus-degree weather headed for the Midwest this week
could remain in the region for a week or more, stressing young
crops.
   But after traders saw the weather service forecast, ``the
excitement is out of here,'' said John Frazier, director of the
agricultural trading division of Gerald Inc. in Chicago.
   Selling in the corn and soybean markets also reflected
profit-taking after Monday's steep gains, said Victor Lespinasse,
an assistant vice president in the grain-trading division of Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Cocoa futures rallied strongly on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp;
Cocoa Exchange, rebounding from sharp losses posted late last week.
   Sandra Kaul, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said
the surge mainly reflected a lack of significant selling interest.
   She said the market fell last week to levels at which cocoa
dealers had established delivery positions to lock in prices on
their 1990-91 sales commitments, effectively creating a floor of
trade buying interest.
   Cocoa futures settled $44 to $48 higher with July at $1,226 per
ton.
   Energy futures sagged in slow trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as conflicting signals left brokers with little incentive
to buy or sell heavily.
   Among ingredients that curbed trading interest were weekly
supply and demand statistics released after the market closed.
   As expected, the American Petroleum Institute report showed a
modest 531,000-barrel decline in U.S. stocks of crude oil, an even
smaller decline in gasoline stocks and a 2.4-million-barrel
increase in supplies of petroleum distillates.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 24 cents
lower with August at $17.14 a barrel; home heating oil was .34 cent
to .53 cent lower with July at 48.49 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .50 cent to .70 cent lower with July at 61.32 cents a
gallon.
   Pork-belly futures steadied on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
after limit losses of 2 cents a pound in each of the three previous
sessions. Traders said they expected the belly market to gain some
ground Wednesday after a weekly Merc report showed a
larger-than-expected decline in supplies of bellies in commercial
freezers outside of Chicago.
   Hog futures advanced while cattle futures were narrowly mixed.
   Live cattle settled .20 cent lower to .18 cent higher with
August at 73 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to
.08 cent higher with August at 84.55 cents a pound; live hogs were
.07 cent to .43 cent higher with August at 58.62 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .65 cent lower to .68 cent higher with
July at 57.15 cents a pound.
   Gold futures gave up most of Monday's strong gains on New York's
Commodity Exchange amid slack investor buying interest; silver was
barely changed.
   Gold settled $3.30 to $3.40 lower with June at $350.40 a troy
ounce; silver futures ended 0.1 cent lower to 0.4 cent higher with
July at $4.825 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Sonat Agrees to $300.5 Million Settlement for Offshore Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sonat Inc. has agreed to pay $300.5
million to settle claims stemming from a 1989 fire that killed
seven people and destroyed a production platform operated by Arco
Oil and Gas Co. off the Louisiana coast, officials said.
   Arco announced the settlement Monday. A Sonat spokesman
confirmed that the Birmingham-based company had reached an
agreement in principal to settle all claims against Sonat and
litigation involving the fire on March 19, 1989.
   An April report released by the Minerals Management Service,
U.S. Coast Guard and Office of Pipeline Safety said a number of
factors led to the accident, according to the Oil &amp; Gas Journal.
   Problems began in February 1989 when an anchor ruptured a Sonat
pipeline. In repairing the damage and clearing the pipeline, the
report said, the pipeline released a mix of gas, liquid
hydrocarbons and water.
   In March, the mixture ignited and spread to an Arco facility,
Platform Baker, located 20 miles southeast of Venice, La. The
flames caused an explosion that reached an adjacent platform
connected by a 50-foot causeway.
   Of the 42 people on the rig, five Arco workers and two contract
employees died; another 10 workers were injured. Platform Baker
suffered extensive damage, while the second platform was slightly
damaged.
   Arco, which also was forced to halt production of 18,000 barrels
of oil a day, sued Sonat, two subsidiaries and a contractor in
April 1989.
   Under the terms of the settlement, Sonat will be assigned Arco's
claims against other parties involved in the accident who are not
involved in the settlement, the Sonat spokesman said.
   Sonat said no adverse effects are expected on earnings or the
company's financial condition because insurance would cover the
settlement.

<HEAD>NYSE Accepts Soviet Invitation for Securities Seminar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Stock Exchange said Tuesday it has
accepted an invitation from the Soviet government to organize a
seminar in Moscow on developing securities exchanges and capital
markets.
   Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Leonid Abalkin, who is chairman of
the State Economic Reform Commission, invited NYSE Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer John J. Phelan Jr. to lead a delegation in
October, the exchange said.
   ``The development of a new economic structure at home, and the
Soviet Union's expansion into world financial markets, will provide
increasing opportunities for cooperation between our two nations,''
Phelan said in a statement.
   The seminar is to be sponsored by the exchange, the Soviet
Ministry of Finance and the Soviet state bank Gosbank.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said earlier this month
that the Soviets plan commercial and securities laws that will
create a ``normal commercial economic environment'' for Western
business by the end of the year.
   Phelan, who is vice president of the Association of the
International Federation of Stock Exchanges, has visit exchanges
throughout the world, including Japan, Singapore, Spain and West
Germany, and plans to visit Eastern Europe this summer, an exchange
spokesman said.
   Phelan's last visit to a non-capitalist country was to China in
1986. The spokesman said ``high-level delegations'' from the Soviet
Union have visited the NYSE in the last two years.

<HEAD>S&amp;P Downgrades Chase Manhattan Debt Ratings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. on Tuesday downgraded
its ratings of several types of debt of Chase Manhattan Corp., the
nation's second-largest banking company.
   Two weeks ago, Moody's Investors Service Inc., the other major
credit-rating agency, downgraded Chase's debt ratings. Other major
banks, including Citicorp, the nation's largest, also have seen
their credit ratings downgraded in recent weeks due to concern over
the softening economy.
   In the latest action, S&amp;P said it downgraded about $7.5 billion
worth of Chase debt securities and preferred stock, including
senior debt, subordinated debt and commercial paper. The action
involves securities issued by Chase itself and several subsidiaries.
   A lower credit rating can force a bank to pay more interest on
its securities, increasing its cost of borrowing.
   ``The downgrades reflect S&amp;P's expectation that loan quality,
particularly in the real estate areas, will deteriorate
significantly,'' S&amp;P said in a statement. Moody's also cited
concern over real estate debt for its downgradings.
   S&amp;P said Chase's profitability has been weak due to low business
volume in wholesale banking, ``although the recently announced plan
to cut $300 million of expenses should go a long way toward
remedying the problem.''
   It also said Chase's reserves for domestic loans are thin.
   ``Thus, while the company has successfully navigated through
LDC-related difficulties, it is not as well prepared to deal with a
new wave of problems domestically,'' it said, referring to Third
World debt.
   It said the concerns are partially offset by Chase's addition of
$1 billion in capital since September through an equity issue and
dividend reinvestment plan. The bank's highly profitable consumer
banking operations also provide some stability, it said.
   Chase spokesman Steve Rautenberg said, ``We're disappointed,
particularly in light of our capital-building activities over the
past two quarters.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday blocked new oil
drilling off the coasts of much of California, Florida, Washington,
Oregon and New England until at least the year 2000.
   In addition, he permanently blocked any drilling in a proposed
marine sanctuary in California's Monterey Bay, and ordered a
moratorium on new leases until 1996 for one section off southern
California where drilling already is under way.
   ``My desire is to achieve a balance between the need to provide
energy for the American people and the need to protect unique and
sensitive coastal and marine environments,'' Bush said in a written
statement announcing his long-pending decision.
   The president called for more environmental studies to settle
the question of whether leases might be offered after 2000.
   The election-year ban was likely to come as a relief to
Republican candidates in both California and Florida, who were
concerned about possible negative voter reaction to new drilling in
a year that has seen a steady parade of oil spill news stories.
   But the announcement fell somewhat short of what
environmentalists were hoping for, a permanent ban on offshore
drilling they contend is the only way to protect sensitive
environmental regions and beaches.
   Based in large part on the recommendations of an inter-agency
task force he appointed to study the California and Florida coastal
drilling prospects, Bush announced he is suspending until at least
2000 any new leases to oil companies in federal waters off:
   _Northern California, 1.1 million acres off Mendocino and
Humboldt counties.
   _Southern California, 6.7 million acres south of the Santa
Barbara Channel to the Mexican border. Not included are the Santa
Barbara Channel and the Santa Maria basin, where drilling is under
way. Bush said he would delay new leases until at least 1996,
pending further study, in those areas.
   _Central California, from San Francisco south to Monterey Bay,
originally scheduled for a lease auction next March. Bush further
permanently barred oil exploration in the Monterey Bay National
Marine Sanctuary.
   _Southern Florida, 14 million acres off Collier, Monroe and Dade
counties in the Gulf of Mexico.
   _New England, 12.8 million acres of Georges Bank off Cape Cod,
an important fishing ground vigorously defended by Massachusetts
officials and believed to far more likely to contain natural gas
than oil.
   _Washington and Oregon, where state and federal agencies
recently agreed that further environmental studies are needed.
   The White House said that the moratorium could be suspended in
the event of ``external events, such as supply disruptions,''
prompting environmental groups to complain that a loophole had been
built in.
   But White House spokesman Steve Hart said that the intention was
only to protect against a dramatic interruption in the nation's oil
supply like the 1973 embargo by Arab producers.
   ``We don't anticipate there's going to be any gas lines and we
don't anticipate just scrapping the whole thing. I believe that we
can handle it,'' Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan told reporters.
   The California and Florida areas probably contain 1.3 billion
barrels to 2.8 billion barrels of oil, equivalent to 75 to 160 days
of consumption, and 2.2 trillion cubic feet of gas, about a 42-day
supply, according to a White House fact sheet. Figures were not
given for the other areas.
   In the Florida area, oil companies already have purchased 73
leases that could not be worked while Bush was studying the issue.
It may cost $200 million to buy them back, officials have said.
   The president announced that he is directing Lujan to begin
discussions with the state for a joint federal-state repurchase
effort.
   In a statement in San Francisco, Chevron Oil Co. said initial
reports of Bush's decision indicated ``the president's actions seem
to go too far.''
   ``But we certainly realize there is great concern by the
American public over this issue, and we're anxious to see the
various parties to the offshore development controversy work
together to find long-term solutions that will 
need for a sound U.S. energy policy and for protection of the
environment,'' the company said.
   Bush said he believes ``there are significant offshore areas
where we casatisfy both then and must go forward with resource development.''
   He did not say what areas he was referring to, but his
administration has indicated it will go forward in Alaska and the
long-productive Gulf of Mexico, where Bush himself pioneered
offshore drilling many years ago.
   Bush also said he is implementing an overhaul of the leasing
system, to include ``rigorous scrutiny'' of potential oil yields
before any leasing occurs, assurance that drilling and exploration
practices will not pose a risk to ``unique natural resources,''
priority for development in the regions with the highest potential
yield and a study of national security needs.
   Members of Congress from New York and New Jersey complained that
the Atlantitruth) and we're all now going to
have to pay the price for that,'' Dukakis said in Boston.
   Democratic Party Chairman Ron Brown said Bush's statement was
candid and sober and ``gives no one comfort. It's no time for
partisan gloating.''
   Budget talks are scheduled to resume Wednesday, and the White
House expressed hope for a final agreement by the August
congressional recess.
   Bush issued his statement after a breakfast session with top
congressional leaders and following a weekend of meetings between
Democrats and White House budget negotiators.
   ``It is clear to me,'' Bush said, ``that both the size of the
deficit problem and the need for a package that can be enacted
require all of the following.''
   He listed ``tax revenue increases,'' cuts in spending for
federal benefits as well as reductions in other domestic and
defense programs, reform of the budget process and ``growth
incentives,'' a term often used to describe a cut in the capital
gains tax rate.
   Bush, asked about his statement as he left a photo session, said
the written statement ``speaks for itself'' and declined to
specifically address reporters' questions about his position.
   ``I want to see this economy grow,'' he said. ``I want jobs. I
want to see the deficit down. And this bipartisan statement speaks
for itself. Now we're going on to some serious negotiation.''
   He hailed congressional Democrats for the ``good faith'' spirit
of the budget talks and said it was ``essential that these talks
get moving.''
   From the outset of the budget talks, Bush had said that
everything was on the table for negotiation.
   Until now, however, he had refused to say explicitly that tax
increases must be included in the deficit-reduction formula.
   The White House refused to acknowledge that Bush had scrapped
his no-new-taxes pledge.
   ``Are you crazy?'' Fitzwater good-naturedly asked reporters.
   However, Fitzwater said Bush's statement amounted to ``a
refinement'' of his earlier remarks.
   ``We've got to deal realistically with this problem,'' he said.
   On the other hand, Fitzwater said, ``I don't think that it
(Bush's statement) is that big a change. We're still a long way
from the final details of a settlement.''
   There is a general consensus among budget negotiators that they
need to reduce the deficit by $45 billion to $60 billion in the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and about $400 billion to $600 billion
over the next five years.
   Technically, the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law would
require far deeper cuts, based on current revenue and spending
projections. By law, the government will be forced to absorb deep,
across-the-board spending cuts unless the deficit is kept to $74
billion in fiscal 1991.

<HEAD>Judges Would Get Discretion to Dismiss Civil RICO Suits</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also ran on general news wires.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee voted Tuesday to give
federal judges more discretion to dismiss as frivolous some civil
suits under the nation's anti-racketeering laws.
   On a unanimous vote, the Judiciary Committee's 10-member
subcommittee on crime approved legislation that would narrow the
definition of racketeering in civil suits to exclude ordinary
commercial disputes and contract cases.
   ``Ordinary businessmen are being branded as racketeers simply
because they have become embroiled in a commercial dispute,'' said
Rep. Frederick Boucher, D-Va., the bill's chief sponsor.
   The bill would revise the 1970 Racketeer Influence and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) to effectively deny plaintiffs in many
civil suits the ability to recover triple they amount of damages
they incurred.
   Under the legislation, a judge would be required to dismiss a
civil RICO suit if a defendant had not been convicted of criminal
racketeering or if the judge could not find that triple damages
were warranted because of the magnitude of the injuries.
   Boucher called the current statute one of the most abused
provisions of federal law, having ``made its way into domestic
disputes between spouses, inheritance disputs among family members,
disagreements among church members and litigation involving
landlords and tenants.''
   The bill would apply the new proposed ``gatekeeper'' provisions
retroactively to some 1,500 currently pending civil suits. On a 6-4
vote, the committee defeated an amendment by Rep. John Conyers,
D-Mich., to deny retroactivity.
   Supporters of the failed amendment said it was needed to
preserve the RICO suit of some 23,000 bondholders who lost $200
million in the parent company of Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association against the thrift's owner, Phoenix financier Charles
H. Keating Jr., and his associates.
   ``Given the inherent ambiguities in the `gatekeeper' provision,
there is no assurance that a judge will not later on deprive my
clients of a meritorious verdict,'' the bondholders' attorney,
William Lerach, said in a letter to the subcommittee.
   ``To give Charles Keating and Ferdinand Marcos another bite of
the apple is ridiculous,'' said subcommittee member Chuck Douglas,
R-N.H., referring to another suit now pending against the estate of
the deceased former dictator of the Philippines.
   Making the changes retroactive also was opposed by the state
attorneys general and state insurance commissioners.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee last January removed a
retroactivity provision from a similar bill written by Sen. Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz., one of five senators under investigation by the
Senate Ethics Committees over their involvement with Keating.
   Rather than give judges more discretion to dismiss civil RICO
suits, the Senate bill would simply eliminate triple damages except
in cases brought by the government.

<TEXT>
   The former chairman and three top executives
of Midwest Federal Savings and Loan were indicted Tuesday on
federal fraud and conspiracy charges involving financial losses
sustained by the failed thrift.
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh announced the 40-count
indictment returned by a federal grand jury.
   ``This indictment is a further demonstration of our
determination to pursue serious allegations against savings and
loan ripoff artists across the United States,'' Thornburgh said.
   Midwest Federal, which had assets of $3.5 billion, is being
liquidated by the government at an expected cost of $1 billion. The
thrift was about $1 billion in debt when it was seized by
regulators in February 1989.
   Indicted were chairman Harold W. Greenwood Jr.; Charlotte E.
Masica, former executive vice president and managing officer;
Donald J. Snede, former senior vice president and chief financial
officer; and Robert A. Mampel, former executive assistant to the
chairman.
   Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency created to bail out
the nation's failing thrifts, put Midwest up for sale in April. The
S&amp;L has 30 branches in Minnesota, nine in Iowa, eight in Oklahoma
and two in California.
   Greenwood, Mampel, Masica and Greenwood's daughter, former
Midwest Federal Vice President Susan Greenwood Olson, were ousted
when the savings and loan was declared insolvent and seized by
regulators.
   Greenwood Olson was indicted in March on 10 fraud counts
involving $15 million in loans to the Jockey Club marina and resort
in Miami. Prosecutors allege the loans far exceeded the value of
the resort and that false documents were drafted to hide Mdwest
Federal's shaky financial condition.
   Much of Tuesday's indictment centered on Midwest Federal's ties
with Green Tree Acceptance Inc., a St. Paul-based company that
finances mobile homes.
   In early 1987, Greenwood, Masica and Snede hid from regulators a
$47 million shortfall in finance income expected from a $1.5
billion portfolio of mobile home loans, the indictment alleges.
Midwest had purchased the loan service rights to the portfolio from
Green Tree for $188 million.
   The executives also inflated the thrift's net worth and made
unsound loans to delinquent borrowers to avoid writeoffs ``so as to
preserve'' their bonuses, the indictment said.
   The indictment also charges the four with misapplying funds to
pay for personal airline flights and club memberships, and to pay
``excessive levels of compensation to themselves'' and lend
themselves money without proper approval.
   Regulators say deposits at Midwest Federal have dropped 10
percent since the takeover. As of May 31, the thrift's retail
deposits were about $1.9 billion.
   Gov. Rudy Perpich has tried to distance himself from Greenwood,
who was one of Perpich's biggest campaign contributors before the
S&amp;L collapsed. The Democratic governor was granted use of Midwest's
corporate jet and Perpich had appointed Greenwood to the
Metropolitan Airports Commission and the Greater Minnesota Corp.
board.
   Perpich said Monday he had no business dealings with Midwest and
that the state does not regulate savings and loans.
   William Mauzy, attorney for Greenwood, said the indictment was
