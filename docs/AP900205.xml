<HEAD>Pioneer of Modern Architecture Dead at 87</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Muschenheim, a member of the
group that helped launch the modern movement of architecture, has
died at age 87.
   Muschenheim, a professor emeritus of architecture at the
University of Michigan, died Thursday in Ann Arbor. The cause of
death was not disclosed.
   His designs included the original facade of the New School for
Social Research, the color scheme for the Chicago World's Fair of
1933, the Solomon Guggenheim Museum of Non-Objective Art and the
Marine Transportation Building for the New York World's Fair in
1939.
   He was a member of CIAM, the French acronym for the
International Congress of Modern Architects, which included Ludwig
Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius and Le Corbusier and was
instrumental in developing the modern movement in architecture.
   Muschenheim was a native of New York City, and his family owned
the Hotel Astor there.
   He attended Williams College and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology before leaving for the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts to
study with Peter Behrens, another pioneer of modern architecture.
   His student projects included a renovation of the Hotel Astor
bar in the Bauhaus style.
   Muschenheim, whose books include ``Elements of the Art of
Architecture'' and ``Why Architecture?'' joined the Michigan
faculty in 1950 and retired in 1973.
   Survivors include his son, C. Arthur Muschenheim of London, and
daughter Anneli Arms of New York City. Services are scheduled for
Wednesday in the Auditorium, Art and Architecture Building on the
Ann Arbor campus.

   They swallow deadly drugs, plunge out of
windows, smash their cars and hang or shoot themselves at an
alarming rate. And they do it because suicide seems better than the
alternative: dying of AIDS.
   ``You have no control over this illness at all, so it gives me
some kind of control when I can say I can end my life any time I
want to,'' said Chuck Sporeman, a 43-year-old nurse who has AIDS.
   Sporeman tried to kill himself twice in December 1988, two
months after his male companion of 13 years died of AIDS. He said
he might try again when the disease leaves him unable to care for
himself, but participation in a support group helps, at least for
now.
   ``There are days where I wish I had done it, but there are other
days when it's a beautiful day, the wind is blowing through the
trees, I can go watch the waves crashing on the beach, and I'm glad
I didn't do it,'' he said.
   The author of a 1988 Cornell University study estimates about
1,000 AIDS patients in the United States will kill themselves by
1991. The study found people with AIDS are 66 times more likely to
commit suicide than the general population.
   ``It definitely happens all the time,'' said Andrew Weisser,
spokesman for AIDS Project Los Angeles, a service agency where five
of 2,100 AIDS-infected clients killed themselves in December.
   The relatively small number of AIDS-related suicides reported
publicly ``is just the tip of the iceberg,'' Weisser said.
   ``There's no way for us to keep track,'' said Los Angeles County
coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher. ``If someone comes off a
building, we don't know if they have AIDS. If they shoot
themselves, we don't know.''
   Such suicides graphically illustrate that mental health budget
cuts and discrimination leave many AIDS patients without adequate
counseling, Weisser asserts. Many AIDS patients who discuss suicide
are ``calling out for help,'' he said. But hopelessness makes
others kill themselves:
   _ A 28-year-old AIDS patient in San Diego drank all day, stole a
car, swerved down the highway without headlights, then triggered a
six-car accident that killed him and injured three others in April
1988. Paul James Curry ``was dying slow. I think he chose to die
fast,'' a friend said.
   _ Two men who authorities said had AIDS tied themselves
together, then jumped 35 floors off their New York apartment
building in 1985.
   _ Philip Saylor, 40, took a revolver into Los Angeles'
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Jan. 2, shot and killed his longtime
companion, 35-year-old AIDS patient Steven Jenkins, then killed
himself. Police said Saylor also was infected by the AIDS virus.
   After that tragedy, several experts said suicide can be a
reasonable alternative if AIDS patients are thinking clearly and
fully informed of all options.
   ``People have a right to kill themselves _ not early on when
people first find they're infected, but when they have become
sufficiently sick that the quality of their life is not
satisfactory to them,'' said Dr. Neal Schram, a member of the
California Medical Association's AIDS task force.
   Rabbi Allen Freehling, a member of the Los Angeles County
Commission on AIDS, advises AIDS patients against killing
themselves, saying suicide is a selfish act that can compound the
grief of family and friends.
   ``In Ecclesiastes, it says there is a time to live and a time to
die, and I don't think the author of that statement meant we should
decide when that time is,'' Freehling said.
   A Cornell University study published this month found that
people who have just learned they are infected by the AIDS virus
but don't yet have symptoms are no more likely than other people to
have suicidal thoughts _ if they receive proper counseling.
   Dr. Peter Marzuk, author of the earlier Cornell study, found
patients face the greatest risks just after they are diagnosed, and
again when AIDS' effects on the brain cause depression, delirium or
other treatable psychiatric disorders.
   ``If you treat the depression, frequently these people will feel
better and not feel driven to suicide,'' said Dr. Geoffrey
Newstadt, a Cedars-Sinai psychiatrist.
   Marzuk's study, published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association in 1988, found 12 suicides among 3,828 AIDS patients in
New York City in 1985. He called it striking that three of them
jumped from hospital windows _ an act repeated in 1986 by AIDS
patients at hospitals in Eureka, Calif., and Dallas. A Cedars-Sinai
AIDS patient jumped to his death a year ago, Newstadt said.
   Two other suicides in Marzuk's study had lovers who earlier died
from AIDS, which Newstadt said can spur the depression that leads
to suicide.
   Sporeman said he took care of his companion ``for the last year
and a half of his life, and when he died I, being ill, saw no
reason to go on. ... After the funeral, everybody goes back to
their lives and you're left all alone.''
   A study similar to Marzuk's found California men with AIDS are
up to 21 times more likely than other men to kill themselves. The
study, conducted by California's Department of Health Services,
counted 13 AIDS-related suicides in 1986.
   Marzuk wrote that many AIDS-related suicides go uncounted
because some people kill themselves without revealing they have the
disease, while others might be cloaked as overdoses of prescribed
medications or illicit drugs.
   Sporeman tried to inject a fatal air bubble and overdose of
medicine in his first failed suicide attempt. Days later, he
swallowed Valium and Percodan pills and downed alcohol as he walked
around his house writing a will. A friend walked in and stopped him
before he could swallow a fatal amount.
   Schram said it still is more common for AIDS patients to refuse
heroic medical treatment, to let themselves die, than to commit
suicide.
   There is ``a very thin line ... between maintaining a life and
taking a life,'' Freehling said. That line can be hard to define,
especially when AIDS patients often recover from repeated
infections before they die.
   Some AIDS patients ask friends or lovers to help them commit
suicide.
   In August, John Cleaves, 43, of San Diego was sentenced to 15
years to life in prison after being convicted of second-degree
murder for strangling Dennis Eaton, 40. Cleaves contended he helped
Eaton commit suicide.
   The development of AZT and other life-extending drugs may change
the way AIDS is viewed from a fatal disease to a ``manageable
chronic disease'' like some cancers. That could lower suicide
rates, Schram said.
   AIDS patients have a right to decide to commit suicide, Newstadt
said, but ``the problem is whether they have all of the information
available to them about treatment possibilities.''
   Of suicide, Sporeman said, ``Before the virus hits my brain or
I'm unable to do things for myself, I want to be able to do it. I
still have a plan to do it. ... Even if I don't do it, I feel I got
control over the disease, because I can say, `Stop.'''

   Garage mechanics listen for pings. Piano
tuners are alert for plunks. Donald E. Marlowe's job is to wait for
the next POW! to shatter the silence of his laboratory.
   Marlowe is the government's chief condom tester, and the
explosions come from an ``air burst'' test he is perfecting to
measure sample condoms' resistance to pressure.
   Working in a low, nondescript building that the Food and Drug
Administration shares with a furniture store in this Washington
suburb, Marlowe demonstrates by slipping a latex condom onto a
machine equipped with gauges, dials and the squiggly needle of an
instrument that looks like a seismograph.
   Then he inflates the condom with air. It swells to the size of a
good-sized watermelon before it bursts. The instruments record that
it withstood 30 liters or about 7{ gallons of air and pressure of
three-tenths of a pound per square inch, well above the
government's exacting standard.
   ``Pretty tough,'' says Marlowe, a 49-year-old mechanical
engineer who runs the division of mechanics and material science
for the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
   In another room, Marlowe takes a circular section cut from the
middle of a condom, similar to a wide rubber band, and stretches it
on a machine to test its tensile strength _ how far it will stretch
before it snaps.
   Besides condoms, Marlowe's laboratory tests a wide variety of
medical devices such as cardiac pacemakers, artificial hearts and
valves, false eyes, syringes, pumps and bone, joint and ligament
implants.
   Nearly four dozen of these prosthetic body parts are attached to
``Yorick,'' the FDA's bionic skeleton, which greets visitors to the
laboratory where all the devices have been tested over the years.
   ``The FDA is responsible for the safety and effectiveness of
medical devices, and condoms are a medical device,'' Marlowe said.
   Marlowe is accustomed to the snickers and jokes he sometimes
hears about condoms. He chuckles indulgently about the time his
staff, in a playful holiday mood, inflated some condoms with helium
and tied them to the office Christmas tree. ``They looked great,''
he said.
   But Marlowe says that with widespread public concern over the
AIDS epidemic and former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop's highly
publicized campaign to promote safer sex, condoms are no laughing
matter.
   Since the early 1960s, FDA agents at a Winchester, Mass.,
laboratory north of Boston have been conducting random, unannounced
tests of sample condoms from domestic and foreign manufacturers for
possible water leakage.
   During the year ended in April 1988, the FDA tested 115,000
condoms for possible pinholes or tears in this way, resulting in
rejection of more than 30 million imported condoms as defective and
the recall of 3 million domestic condoms from store shelves.
   Marlowe said his laboratory's air burst and tensile strength
tests for condoms form the basis for an industrywide testing
standard that was first published in 1973 and was revised most
recently in November.
   That standard is recognized voluntarily by manufacturers, the
government and consumer interests, including the U.S. Agency for
International Development, which supplies condoms for Third World
population control projects. Compliance is determined during the
FDA's regular ``quality assurance'' inspections of manufacturers.
   ``Someone new coming into the lab gets over the bathroom humor
about condoms very quickly,'' Marlowe said. ``This is serious
business.''

   A cold, windswept plain in Tibet populated with
scores of birds, plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth has
been proposed as the world's largest nature reserve.
   The Chang Tang Reserve, named from the Tibetan words for
``northern plain,'' would encompass an area the size of California.
The proposed territory covers one-sixth of the Tibet Autonomous
Region and adjoining parts of the Chinese provinces of Qinghai and
Xinjiang, said George Schaller, an American biologist who has
explored the region and helped negotiate an agreement signed just
days ago.
   ``It's one of the last, almost unexplored places on the face of
the Earth,'' said Schaller, of Wildlife Conservation International
in New York. ``It survives intact almost as it was 100 years ago.''
   Schaller, one of the world's leading wildlife biologists, has
done pioneering studies on gorillas, pandas, snow leopards and
other endangered animals.
   He is one of the very few Westerners to have entered the Chang
Tang region. Few local people have been there, either. Despite its
size, it has a human population of no more than several hundred
wandering herdsmen who live there for only a few months each year.
   When he returned from Chang Tang in late January, he brought
with him an agreement with the Tibetan Environmental Protection
Agency that outlines the steps to be taken to establish the reserve.
   An area of 100,000 square miles, about the size of Colorado,
will be set aside in Tibet. The Tibetan EPA will coordinate the
effort, with funds from Wildlife Conservation International and
Tibetan and national agencies. Proposed additions in adjoining
provinces would bring the size of the reserve to about 150,000
square miles, an area the size of California.
   ``We want to, in the next few years, find out what's there and
the areas of particular importance,'' Schaller said. He plans to
return in July. The research will be conducted with the Tibet
Institute of Plateau Biology.
   The agreement calls the area ``a unique animal and plant
community which includes such spectacular creatures as wild yak,
Tibetan wild ass, Tibetan wild sheep, Tibetan gazelle, Tibetan
antelope and Tibetan brown bear, all of which occur only on the
Tibetan plateau.''
   When asked to describe the region, he paused, searching for
comparisons to convey the vastness and austere beauty of an area
unlike any other.
   It has ``the aura of the Serengeti'' in East Africa, he said.
``You travel and travel toward a distant horizon, and the world
seems to expand in front of you.''
   The reserve is a high-altitude steppe at an elevation of about 3
miles. It is covered with scrub grasses no more than 6 inches high,
lakes too salty to drink from, and jagged, inhospitable mountains.
   Winter temperatures can drop to 40 or 50 degrees below zero.
Snow can fall any day of the year. ``And the winds,'' Schaller
said. ``Oh, how the winds can howl across there.''
   Four hundred species of plants have been found on the plateau,
along with 60 species of birds. Wild yak gather in herds of 100 or
150. ``It's a real desert area, but it has oases around which
animals congregate'' by the thousands, he said.
   Access to the reserve is normally by way of Lhasa, the Tibetan
capital, a week's drive south of the proposed reserve. ``I've gone
in from the north by camel caravan, but you cross such desolate
country, it's difficult,'' Schaller said.
   The trip from Lhasa isn't a simple excursion either. ``You need
two cars and a truck to carry gas,'' he said. Because of the need
to carry gas, expeditions normally last no more than three months,
he said.
   ``My preference would be to just have a herd of yak animals and
live in there for a few years,'' he said. ``But politically that's
not feasible.'' Schaller is willing, but ``most of the local people
have families and they don't want to be out,'' he said.
   In an area so remote, is the establishment of a nature reserve
really necessary?
   ``There is no such thing as a remote area any more,'' Schaller
said. ``It's known there are minerals there. Near there oil has
been discovered.''
   Recalling the bison that once roamed the American plains in
uncounted numbers, he said, ``They destroyed the bison in 15
years.''

   The only common thread weaving through news about
menswear for next winter is that guys will still be wearing pants.
   And even then, the trousers displayed at shows ending Monday
ranged from fairly baggy to cigarette-style, with or without cuffs.
Besides classic blazer jackets with vents, toppers are usually
hooded toggle-buttoned duffel coats or puffy parkas.
   Otherwise, there's nearly as much romance and color to seduce
male dandies as you see in women's styles, from brocade to
rhinestone embroidery touches.
   The emphasis at Hermes was on incomparable silkscarf touches in
linings on dress tails or bathrobe loungewear. The house's famed
leather goods looked softer than ever in jodphur styles.
   Welsh designer Richard James went all-out for fantasy gear: bold
tartan combinations of bermuda shorts, ties, jackets and sequined
waistcoats worn with argyle socks or sweaters. His
sequined-snowflake pastel velvet jogging outfits were adorable.
   Balmain's offerings by Patrick Aubert included a range of
delectable colors and casual styles based on suits and separates in
all ranges of chocolate brown, plum, cinnamon and curry or mustard.
   The cashmere blazers in everything from robin's egg blue to
dusty rose and rust worn with paisley vests looked great for casual
wear teamed with charcoal or blue denim jeans.
   The Lanvin message was dubbed ``a new language of color'' by
Patrick Lavoix. Besides some sharp pinstripe or herringbone suits
in soft wools, there were color combinations like burgundy, violet
and rust shades with a dash of pine green, or mixes of greenish
gray, chartreuse, cassis, teal blue and raspberry in an outfit.
   Lavoix's splendid touches of brocade vests with black tuxedos
and lounging outfits in copper brocade would pep up any
conservative's wardrobe.
   Jean-Charles de Castelbajac's selections ranged from fringed
blanket lumberjack looks to startle Tonto right through soft plaid
pants sporting peplum wraps and trains. The epicene fashions that a
lady might covet also included full-skirted loden coats for a
citified Henry David Thoreau returning to nature.
   Claude Montana's clothes were often minimalist styles in petrol
blues, tobacco, sand shades in big duster-coats over casual,
tieless gabardine suits. More fun for sportswear would be the
brightly colored blazers with dark pants.
   Montana's evening wear would best be worn by the ``leather-bar''
set. Zombie-like, the models clomped around in all manner of
nailhead-studded black leather blousons with narrow pants, plus
some weird visored stiffened nylon-string caps
   Jean-Paul Gaultier put on a rousing show of fun featuring
red-nosed cartoon characters, the Gallic version of the Three
Stooges. They sometimes sported candleabra headgear sprouting
shaving brushes instead of candles or big egret feathers.
   Gaultier also threw in some real clothes, notably well-cut brown
and blue blazers and hooded duffels in ethnic-patterned fabrics.
   Yohji Yamamoto, the Japanese advocate of black, went in for a
lot more color this time in patchwork jackets teaming checks, glen
plaids, chevron and tweeds. Mossy green or brown shirts were in,
ties were out.
   Issey Miyake put on a show of low-keyed practical clothes
featuring plenty of puffy quilted windbreakers in ``wet'' or
``dry'' surface fabrics over corduroy pants and ground-grippers.
   The black evening wear featuring spencers or priests' collar
jackets emerged from a hole in the floor on models carrying roses
in a tango-rhythmed tribute to ``the dead and the dying,''
presumably a reference to victims of AIDS.
   Catherine Hamnett, English queen of laid-back styles for men and
women, came up with a good siena-brown redingote with velvet collar
as well as rust, mustard, caramel belted polo coats.
   The evening wear was a sparkly fireworks show based on black
dressy fabrics with red sequin and crystal trim _ the glitziest
number in an all-sequined bluejean-suit look with bomber jacket.
   The Yves Saint Laurent show by designer Bernard Sanz offered
true originality in wearable classics updated with new color
schemes and light, soft fabrics.
   His shades of silvery gray and creamy white should please anyone
from Minneapolis to Montreal. The handsome toggle-buttoned duffel
coats with knit caps topped jersey pants tucked into heavy cable
socks or corduroy bicycle knickers with black-laced beige suede
high-top shoes.
   The new fox or wolf-collared panther-spotted windbreakers with
contrasting quilted satin linings looked handsome over tweed
jackets, button-down corduroy shirts and lean pants. They turned up
in various shades of tobacco, curry and old gold, with flowered or
fruit ties and long fringed silk scarfs adding a festive touch.

   A massive influx of Soviet Jews is reawakening
a sense of national pride among Israelis, who are volunteering to
help the newcomers and even furnishing whole apartments for them.
   The outpouring of good will has surprised government officials
and immigration activists who just weeks ago were having trouble
shaking Israelis out of their attitude of suspicion toward new
immigrants.
   ``It's as though a revolution has struck Israeli society. In
many places we have more volunteers ready to help the immigrants
than we have immigrants,'' said Yuri Stern, a Russian immigrant and
an adviser to Parliament's Committee on Immigration Absorption.
   ``For the first time in many years, Israelis are seizing this
chance to fulfill their destiny and their major reason for being,''
said Stern, referring to Israel's founding as a homeland for all
Jews in 1948.
   The dream of ``ingathering'' the exiles was popularized by
Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, who spoke of
``aliyah,'' a biblical word for ``moving up'' to the Holy Land, as
a top national priority along with building an army.
   As the immigrant flow rises, Israelis also are realizing the
numbers of Jews in their country is being significantly enhanced _
a welcome prospect with figures showing the Arab population growing
faster than the Jewish population.
   ``The demographic issue bothered Israeli society in a way that
many people just submerged, and now they see another half-million
Jews may arrive. It's a historic development for us,'' said Michael
Kleiner, a member of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing
Likud bloc who chairs Parliament's Immigration Committee.
   Kleiner said the immigration wave also provided a psychological
lift after more than two years of the Palestinian uprising that has
divided Israelis and damaged the country's image abroad.
   ``I don't remember this rise in spirits since the Six Day War''
of 1967, when Israel defeated three Arab armies, Kleiner said.
   The influx began last year when 12,000 Soviets arrived, more
than five times the total in 1988. The pace quickened in January
with 4,800 arrivals, and the government predicts up to 100,000
Soviets will immigrate by year's end.
   In the next decade, officials say, 500,000 Soviet Jews could
settle in Israel because of liberalized Kremlin exit policies,
growing unrest in the Soviet Union and tighter U.S. visa
restrictions.
   With the Israeli government too financially strapped to handle
the rush of arrivals, at least 50 voluntary organizations are
working nationwide, along with dozens of neighborhood councils, to
encourage Israelis to ``adopt'' Soviet families.
   Thousands of individual citizens also have organized projects.
In Jerusalem's Gilo neighborhood, for example, Meir and Rachel
Monsonego helped furnish an apartment across the hall when
immigrants Victor and Katya Savitsky moved in.
   ``We need these immigrants and we want them to stay, so we have
to help,'' said Meir Monsonego, an electric company worker who
emigrated from Morocco at the age of 10.
   The Savitskys, who have an infant and an 8-year-old daughter,
Lena, arrived with only an old green trunk full of clothes. Victor,
40, an engineer and translator of scientific documents, said he
left Moscow because he feared growing anti-Semitism.
   Savitsky said he considered trying to join relatives in the
United States. Now, he said, he would prefer to land a job in
Israel.
   As his 11-month-old daughter Sophya crawled on the floor,
Savitsky gestured toward gifts from neighbors: a crib and a child's
bed, a new gas range, an electric heater and a living room armchair.
   ``I like the openness of people that I have found here. It's an
important thing, especially when you are new,'' Savitsky said.
   Across town in Jerusalem's Neve Yaacov suburb, retired traffic
safety official Tuviah Diamant took Asya Eisenstadt, an economist
from Minsk, to Israel's Bank Leumi to try to get her a job despite
her broken Hebrew.
   ``We need to encourage as many immigrants as possible,'' he told
the bank manager, who said he would consider the application.
   Elitzur Mordechai, a social worker who is organizing volunteers
in Jerusalem's East Talpiot quarter, said many Israelis empathized
with the newcomers, who must deal with red tape and infighting
among government agencies. This week, their plight was worsened by
a walkout of 350 immigration employees in a labor dispute.
   ``We get involved emotionally when we see people put in
unpleasant circumstances arriving at empty apartments,'' Mordechai
said.
   Contrasting with the warm welcome from most Israelis is
lingering resentment among many Sephardi Jews, those from Arab and
Asian countries. They claim the newcomers are better treated than
their relatives were during the 1950s wave of immigration. They
worry that Soviet immigrants will be given jobs and welfare funds
that would otherwise go to Sephardis.
   A typical complaint came from Jerusalem shopkeeper Nahum Cohen,
whose parents were from Syria. He went into a tirade in his dusty
clothing store as he heard Shamir quoted by the radio as saying the
Russians ``can live anywhere they choose.''
   ``I'm glad they're coming to fill the country with Jews. But why
do the Russians get to live in the big cities, while many of our
families were forced to help settle the Negev desert? This is
discrimination,'' Cohen said.

   Women will be at sea in British warships by the
end of this year, ending a longstanding ban on women in combat
roles because there is a shortage of male recruits, the government
says.
   Women will also be eligible to join the Royal Marines and fly
Navy aircraft but will be barred from submarines, where privacy
cannot be provided in cramped conditions, the defense ministry said
in Monday's announcement.
   The ministry said ships will be modified to allow women to live
in them and aircraft carriers will be among the first to have women
in their crews. It said women will initially be employed as radio
and radar operators and in engineering work on aircraft.
   Archibald Hamilton, armed forces minister, told the House of
Commons that the Admiralty was unanimous in the decision and
expected that women would be quickly accepted after initial
opposition from some sailors _ and their wives.
   The navy, army and air force have recruited women for many years
but not for combat roles and the army and air force will continue
that ban.
   The ministry said the difference is in the nature of naval
operations and the fact that combat at sea is different to that on
land or in the air.
   The Dutch navy has had women among its crews for several years.
   A few women with a taste for the rough life joined the Royal
Navy disguised as men in the 18th century days of Adm. Horatio
Nelson and several served at the battle of Trafalgar in 1805.
   Navy records indicate that when discovered, some of the women
were allowed to stay on board as long as they continued to wear
men's clothes.

   The battle between rebel Gen. Michel Aoun
and militia chief Samir Geagea is one of the bloodiest episodes in
the long power struggle among Maronite Catholics, Lebanon's
dominant Christian sect.
   Since the Lebanese civil war began in April 1975, the Christians
have sought to present a united front against Moslems and leftists,
who have had support from Syria, Iran and Libya.
   Disputes among Moslems factions frequently turn into armed
confrontations, but the Christians usually have been able to avoid
open war among themselves.
   Lebanon's Maronites are the only Christians to hold power in the
Middle East. Maronites have dominated the army, government and
judiciary since independence from France in 1943, and before Aoun,
the military generally stayed out of the civil war.
   Its first serious involvement came last year when Aoun, then
army commander, went to war with Syrian troops in Lebanon and
fought sporadic actions against Geagea's powerful Lebanese Forces,
the main Christian militia.
   President Amin Gemayel appointed Aoun interim prime minister in
September 1988, when his six-year term ended with Parliament unable
to agree on a successor, and the general considers himself the only
legitimate authority in Lebonon.
   He does not recognize Elias Hrawi, a fellow Maronite who was
elected president in November and fired him as army commander.
   The Christian power struggle has centered on the three most
powerful Maronite dynasties: Gemayels, Chamouns and Franjiehs.
   Each family had its private army, lucrative interests and
political influence, and each produced presidents of Lebanon. By
unwritten agreement since independence, Lebanon's president has
been a Maronite, the prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the speaker
of Parliament a Shiite Moslem.
   Rivalries between the Christian clans has claimed hundreds of
lives in the last 15 years.
   The right-wing Phalangists of the late Pierre Gemayel fought the
Tigers militia of former President Camille Chamoun in February
1976, 10 months after the civil war began.
   As the war dragged on, the Gemayels tried to become supreme
among the Maronites. Gemayel's charismatic youngest son, Bashir,
emerged as their military leader and in 1978 he began trying to
eliminate his rivals.
   His first target was the Franjiehs, who had allied themselves
with the Syrians and had a fiefdom in north Lebanon centered on the
mountain town of Zghorta. Scores of militiamen were killed in
shootouts.
   On June 13, Bashir Gemayel sent 100 men to attack former
President Suleiman Franjieh's summer palace at Ehden, 65 miles
north of Beirut. The assault was led by Samir Geagea, a young
former medical student and policeman's son who had impressed Bashir.
   The raiders killed Franjieh's oldest son Tony; his wife, Vera;
their 3-year-old daughter, Jehane, and 30 bodyguards.
   Tony Franjieh was his father's heir apparent, a member of
Parliament and commander of the clan's militia _ the Marada, or
Giants.
   In February 1980 a car bomb killed Bashir Gemayel's daughter,
Maya, and seven Phalangists. More more than 300 Phalangists were
killed in the months that followed.
   By 1980, Bashir had merged the Phalange militia and other
Christian groups into the Lebanese Forces and taken over interests
that produced an estimated $100 million a year.
   On July 7, his militia defeated Chamoun's Tigers, a force of
2,000 men, in one of the bloodiest showdowns in the Christian
enclave north and east of Beirut.
   Gemayel's fighters showed no mercy. In one Chamounist coastal
resort, they cut power to the elevators and worked their way
through the building, hurling people from the upper floors and
shooting at them as they fell to their deaths.
   Police said more than 300 people were slain. Chamoun's son Dany
claimed the total was 530.
   Bashir Gemayel was elected president in September 1982, after
the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and Moslems appeared ready to deal
with him. He was killed by a bomb at Phalange headquarters nine
days before inauguration and his brother, Amin, became president
instead.
   After Bashir's death, Phalangist militiamen slaughtered hundreds
of Palestinians in Beirut's Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps.
   In January 1986, Geagea teamed up with Amin Gemayel to oust the
militia commander, Elie Hobeika, who had signed a treaty with
Moslem militia chieftains arranged by Syria. More than 350 people
were killed.
   A year ago, Aoun attacked the Lebanese forces to curb Geagea's
growing power. At least 82 people were killed in three days of
fighting in Christian east Beirut.
   Aoun won the battle but could not crush the Lebanese forces, and
the ultimate result was the battle that began Jan. 30.

   Paul Chih Meng, former president of the
China Institute in America, has died at the age of 100.
   Meng, who died Sunday, lived in this retirement community about
two years after spending much of his life in New York City.
   Meng was born in Beijing, and was a descendant of Mencius, the
founder of neo-Confucianism. He moved to the United States in the
fall of 1919 after his release from prison for revolting against
pro-Japan Chinese officials.
   He entered Columbia University, and earned a master's degree.
   In 1930, Meng was appointed director of the China Institute in
New York.
   After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Meng
helped create a special fund to aid Chinese students stranded in
the United States. He also worked with the State Department to
create scholarship and training grants for students.
   Meng received an honorary doctoral degree from the University of
Southern California in 1946.
   He retired from the institute in 1967. He continued to work
until a stroke forced him to curtail his activities.
   He is survived by his wife, Huan-Shou; a daughter, a son and a
grandchild.
   A memorial service for Meng is scheduled for Wednesday at the
insititute.

<DATELINE>LIMA, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At the Beer Barrel Saloon, the talk was
uncharacteristically sober. No Super Bowl reminiscing. No dreaming
of spring fishing. Patrons talked of tanks and President Bush.
   Bush's proposal last week to end orders for the Lima-built M-1
tanks was a direct hit on their jobs. They work at the Lima Army
Tank Plant, and his plan could put them and thousands of others out
of work.
   ``I got this bad feeling that the plant is going to close for
good,'' said Pat Sample, a 31-year-old welder who has worked at the
northwestern Ohio plant since 1982. ``A lot of people feel the same
way.''
   Sample's friend Wayne Thomas shook his head, saying: ``It
doesn't make sense. We make the best damn tanks in the world, and
now the government says it doesn't want them.''
   In the president's 1991 budget proposal, the plant would close
along with a sister General Dynamics Corp. tank plant in Warren,
Mich.
   Some believe the Lima factory, Allen County's largest employer,
will never reopen after its scheduled March 1993 closing; others
are more optimistic, saying the factory will keep operating _ even
if on a smaller scale.
   ``I think what our workers have to remember is that this is just
a proposal. It's not the bottom line and Congress hasn't acted on
it yet,'' said Darrell Cole, president of United Auto Workers union
Local 2075, which represents 1,800 production and maintenance
workers at the plant.
   ``I think there are some people around in Congress that think we
need some tanks.''
   More than 13,000 Ohio workers depend on the plant for their
jobs, including 2,600 employed by General Dynamics and 11,000 by
suppliers.
   U.S. Rep. Michael Oxley, a Republican whose district includes
Lima, has promised to urge fellow House members to modify the
proposal. General Dynamics also promises to lobby against the
proposal.
   Oxley said tank production should not be reduced when the Soviet
Union's tanks outnumber the United States by 3-1. He also said one
option to keep the Lima plant operating was to export tanks.
   Army spokesman Lt. Col. Dick Bridges said plans call for the
factory to be idle until the military begins production of its next
generation of the Army's main battle tank and other heavy vehicles.
The starting date probably won't be before 1994.
   Bridges said the proposed Pentagon budget of $303 billion
provides for production of 163 M-1A1 tanks and 62 M-1A2 tanks. He
said the Lima plant, now in M-1A1 production, would be closed after
completing production of the tanks in the 1991 budget.
   This city of 50,000, once a manufacturing hub carved out in the
middle of rich farm land, has lost thousands of manufacturing jobs
in recent years. Many of the laid off workers found jobs at the
plant.
   Mayor David Berger said closing the plant would be devastating.
   ``The community would be really hurt,'' he said. ``Those are
very high-paying positions, and to replace those would be very
difficult.''
   A plant closing, though, is not without precedent.
   It was opened in 1942 by United Motors Service, a General Motors
Corp. division. During Word War II, it handled nearly every type of
vehicle in the Amry's motorized fleet, including amphibious landing
craft, cargo carriers and tanks.
   But after the Korean War, its importance declined, and in 1959,
it closed. It didn't reopen until 1976, with the production of the
M-1 tank; the Army spent $40 million in plant renovations.
   Chrysler Corp. ran the plant until 1982, when it sold its
defense subsidiary to General Dynamics, which renamed it the Lima
Army Tank Center.
   General Dynamics' four-year $3.5 billion contract with the Army
to produce 3,299 M-1 tanks is in its final year. The 67-ton tank
has a top speed of 45 mph and is considered the world's most
advanced battle tank.
   Some don't see the closing as all bad.
   ``I hate to see it happen,'' said Don Downhour, 72, a production
control worker at a Westinghouse plant before he retired. ``It will
hurt Lima, but we don't need tanks if we're going to have peace,
and that's what we've been praying for.''

<TEXT>
   Two months after mutineers nearly
toppled President Corazon Aquino, there have been few signs of
steps to combat the social, economic and political problems that
contributed to the coup attempt.
   Instead, most efforts have been directed at tracking down those
behind the bloody Dec. 1-9 uprising and at presenting a facade of
normalcy to lure back foreign investors and tourists.
   Bold words about swift punishment for ``enemies of the people''
and a ``new beginning'' have bogged down. Rumors of a new coup
attempt fill the capital's newspapers despite the arrests of
several key conspirators.
   Mrs. Aquino's declaration of a 60-day national state of
emergency has made little difference, except to allow the state to
set price controls on rice and other essentials and to assume
operation of some transport companies.
   The pattern is similar to the government's response to the
August 1987 coup attempt. Then, Mrs. Aquino declared herself a
``committee of one'' to ride herd over a bloated, inefficient
bureaucracy.
   A few months later, it was business as usual: Garbage went
uncollected, telephones broke down and transport deteriorated.
   ``The political situation remains unsettled,'' U.S. Deputy
Assistant Secretary of Defense Carl Ford told the House
subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific last week. ``Many wonder
whether the government can recover from the blow sufficiently to
restore popular confidence and make lasting strides toward
stability.''
   Some observers fear the military has become so politicized that
Mrs. Aquino can do little to end the coup attempts, which have
plagued her since she took power in the February 1986 uprising
against Ferdinand Marcos.
   ``What can Mrs. Aquino do to stop more coups? Nothing,'' wrote
Teodore Locsin Jr., publisher of the Philippine Daily Globe and
Mrs. Aquino's sometimes speechwriter.
   That presents a formidable challenge to President Bush, who is
committed to supporting Mrs. Aquino and ordered U.S. warplanes to
help crush the December coup.
   Since the coup attempt, in which 113 people were killed and more
than 600 injured, an appearance of normalcy has returned.
   Most of the nighttime roadblocks near the presidential palace
have been removed. There is no evidence of large-scale flight of
capital. But the peso is weakening against the dollar. Inflation
reached 14 percent in December and is expected to remain in
double-digits this year.
   Private economists predict economic growth will slow to between
4 percent and 5 percent from 5.5 percent last year.
   During the coup attempt, rebel leaders cited a failure of
leadership, corruption, inefficiency, rising prices and
deteriorating infrastructure as reasons for removing Mrs. Aquino.
   Mrs. Aquino never publicly acknowledged any validity to rebels'
demands and instead branded them ``power-grabbers'' and ``mad
dogs'' seeking to restore a Marcos-style dictatorship.
   Three weeks later, however, she revamped her Cabinet, replacing
secretaries of transport, agriculture, agrarian reform and other
departments which had come under the sharpest public criticism.
   But personnel shifts have not been matched by dramatic changes
in policy. In some cases, stopgap measures to correct one problem
exacerbated others.
   For example, in the weeks before the coup attempt, Manila was
plagued by frequent electric power outages, which the National
Power Corporation blamed on the palace's failure to approve
purchase of new generating equipment.
   During the coup attempt, the outages ceased, and Christmas
lights returned to public streets. Later, the government
acknowledged that it increased power output by diverting drinking
water to hydroelectric projects.
   Now, Manila faces a critical water shortage.
   Corruption remains endemic. During testimony in Washington last
week, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State David Lambertson
said: ``Corruption remains a real problem in the Philippines and
its corrosive effects hamper government operations.''
   Critics blame much of the government's inefficiency on a
bureaucratic presidential staff that fails to coordinate and
prioritize policy.
   Cabinet members and department heads are retained or fired
because of loyalty to Mrs. Aquino, critics say.
   Miriam Defensor Santiago, who was removed as agrarian reform
secretary in December, complained that weekly Cabinet meetings had
degenerated into fruitless debating seminars.
   ``What happened is that it became a workshop, a seminar, where
everyone could speak off the cuff on subjects where their knowledge
was only skin deep,'' Mrs. Santiago said.
   Complaints persist that the government is unable to use foreign
aid effectively. Elliot Richardson, President Bush's special
representative to the international Philippine aid plan, said
recently the government must demonstrate it can spend money
effectively if it expects Congress to approve $200 million in aid.
   Most changes in government policy must be approved by the
unwieldy bicameral Congress, established after Mrs. Aquino took
power. Even the state of emergency had to be ratified by Congress,
which rejected administration requests for curbs on strikes and
other tough measures.
   Blas Ople, an opposition politician and member of the 1986
Constitutional Commission, said the framers of the charter should
have forged a more streamlined, single chamber.
   Some observers believe no reforms will satisfy dissidents in the
military, deeply politicized during Marcos' eight years of martial
law. Politicization deepened in 1986 when dissident officers
mutinied against Marcos, triggering the ``people power'' revolution
which toppled his administration.
   ``We opened a Pandora's box when we admired and lionized rebel
soldiers (in 1986),'' said Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, who played a
key role in crushing the December coup.
   Military sources claim opposition to Mrs. Aquino is broad-based
in the 160,000-member armed forces and that many units are ready to
strike again.

   Rajiv Gandhi lost the prime ministry and
most of his 1,800 security guards after national elections, but
death threats from Sikh extremists remain as he moves from his
government compound to a smaller home.
   Spike-pointed fences, metal detectors and watch towers are being
installed outside Gandhi's new three-bedroom bungalow to protect
him from the Sikhs, who assassinated his mother, Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi.
   Some say he faces another threat at his new address _ ghosts.
   Three former officials, including Gandhi's younger brother,
Sanjay, died after moving into the 30-year-old house. Previous
occupants or their servants lit candles every evening under a
massive banyan tree in a Hindu ceremony to try to drive out evil
spirits.
   ``I personally do not believe that this house is haunted, but I
am told that there is something,'' said Krishna Kant Tiwari, its
last occupant. ``I thought it proper that I should tell Mr. Gandhi
about it. But our leader does not believe in ghosts, demons or
stuff like haunted houses.''
   Tiwari was Gandhi's minister of information and broadcasting and
lost his seat in Parliament in the November elections.
   Former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, who died in office in
1965, once lived there. A senior government adviser died after
moving to the house. Sanjay Gandhi had his office at the home when
he was killed stunt-flying his light plane in 1980.
   Although none of the three died in the house, the ghost stories
persisted and the house remained unoccupied until Tiwari arrived in
1985.
   Tiwari's wife continued the custom of lighting a candle under
the banyan tree and often summoned priests to perfom ``pujas,'' or
religious ceremonies. Hindus believe ghosts are scared of fire, and
the flame was meant as an evocation of the Hindu fire god, Agni.
   Since losing his job to V.P. Singh in November's election,
Gandhi has stayed in the prime minister's compound while his new
home was being renovated.
   In moving to the bungalow, Gandhi, his wife, Sonia, and their
two children are losing most of their 1,800 security guards.
   The number of guards assigned to the new residence has not been
disclosed for security reasons. The Times of India said Sunday that
the opposition Congress Party leader would now have about 125
security men, while the Sunday Observer, without giving numbers,
claimed the new contingent of bodyguards would be one-sixth the
size of the old group.
   The new government says the 45-year-old Gandhi, a former airline
pilot, will continue to be adequately protected. But threats remain
from Sikh separatists, who Gandhi, like his mother, sought to quell
by expelling them from their faith's holiest shrine, the Golden
Temple in the northern city of Amritsar.
   Gandhi took office on Oct. 31, 1984, the day his mother was
assassinated.
   While in office, his entourage included decoy cars and
ambulances carrying people with the same blood type as Gandhi,
should he need it. Under the security network, which cost $176
million annually, flights were diverted whenever Gandhi was in the
air.
   ``We even protected Mr. Gandhi from possible Stinger missile
attack threats. Will this government do it?'' asked Palaniappam
Chidambaram, Gandhi's former internal security minister. ``Let
there be no doubt whatsoever that Mr. Gandhi is, and will continue
to be, the target of terrorist groups.''
   According to a well-placed source, secret service agents foiled
at least four assassination plots against Gandhi after he became
prime minister.
   The only publicly known attempt against Gandhi came in 1986 when
a lone gunman penetrated his security cordon at a public memorial
and fired at him from a crude 12-gauge shotgun. Gandhi was not hit,
but two other people were wounded, The gunman was captured, and his
trial is still underway.
   ``Threats develop overnight, but do not recede overnight,'' said
Chidambram. ``And in the case of Mr Gandhi there is no sign that it
will ever recede.''

<TEXT>
   Walk into any 7-Eleven store in this British
colony, look past the Slurpee machine to the liquor selection and
start counting; chances are up to a dozen brands of French cognac
will be on display.
   Welcome to Hong Kong, where prosperity and an obsession with
status blend to create what may be the world's capital of
conspicuous consumption.
   Cognac flows like water, luxury cars jam the streets, pricy
portable telephones are the rage and droves of people spend small
fortunes on flashy wristwatches.
   ``There's a lot of ostentatious display among Hong Kong people
... because the achievement of wealth is such a driving force in
people's lives,'' explains S.K. Cheong, head of marketing for
Television Broadcasts Ltd., the territory's No. 1 television
station.
   A recent international survey conducted by the marketing firm
Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide found that nearly half of Hong
Kong people say owning expensive cars and jewelry are important
goals.
   Only one-third of Japanese and one-quarter of Americans surveyed
felt the same way.
   Here are the stats that tell the story:
   _About 12 percent of the private cars on Hong Kong roads are
Mercedes-Benz, which cost from nearly $40,000 to more than three
times that amount, according to C.P. Moore, managing director of
the local dealership.
   ``As far as we know, that is the highest penetration on Earth''
for Mercedes, he said.
   Nearly 1,000 Rolls Royce luxury automobiles, which can cost
almost $400,000, cruise the local streets, giving this tiny British
colony of 5.7 million people the ``highest concentration of Rolls
Royces in the world,'' said Russell Blythe, sales and marketing
manager of the Hong Kong dealer.
   _Nearly 50 brands of wristwatches, most of them among the
priciest on the market, were advertised on Hong Kong's four
television channels last year.
   Bulgari, an exclusive Italian manufacturer of jewelry, has two
stores in Hong Kong and eight for the rest of the world. The most
popular Bulgari watches cost about $4,500 but are often out of
stock here.
   _About 100 fur retailers are listed in the 1990 telephone book
of this sub-tropical city, whose climatic claim to fame is stifling
heat and humidity for much of the year.
   _About 70,000 handheld portable telephones, which generally cost
$1,500 or more, have been sold in Hong Kong, although pay phones
and community phones are ubiquitous.
   _Per capita consumption of cognac is widely believed to be the
highest in the world, with 357,000 cases of brandy entering the
colony last year, or slightly more than one bottle per person age
20 or older.
   Shelves of neighborhood food stands often are stocked with
bottles priced at $200.
   In explaining such sales, local analysts note that the rapid
growth of Hong Kong's export-led economy in the past decade made
millionaires of many local entrepreneurs and left countless other
people with money to spend. The low business and personal tax rates
in the colony have ensured a high level of disposable income.
   But the thirst for status, or ``face,'' among the local Chinese
appears to be the main driving force behind the colony's
conspicuous consumption.
   ``When they have accumulated some wealth they like to spend it
on visible things to show off,'' says Joseph Wan, finance director
for Dickson Concepts Ltd., which has recorded 50 percent compound
annual growth for the past five years by selling expensive name
brands in Hong Kong and elsewhere in the region.
   ``It's an affluent city, everybody wants respect,'' agrees James
J.S. Wong, host of the popular late-night talk show ``No
Restrictions Tonight.''
   Cheong, the television marketing manager, believes social
pressure is intense to acquire possessions that advertise one's
wealth. He acknowledged considering buying a wristwatch for several
thousand dollars because of peer pressure.
   Still, the local demand for status-enhancing products may not be
limitless. Sales of some luxury goods fell after Chinese troops
ruthlessly quashed the pro-democracy movement in Beijing, and the
long-term health of the market is unclear with Hong Kong being
handed over to Communist China in 1997.
   Although Beijing has guaranteed that Hong Kong can maintain its
freewheeling capitalist ways until the middle of the 21st century,
many local residents are skeptical of such promises.
   But for now, capitalism and conspicuous consumption remain very
much alive in the territory.
   ``I see it as a beauty of Hong Kong rather than a minus,'' said
Wong. ``You work hard and you make your fortune, and now you're
allowed to show that.
   ``It's another form of freedom.''

<HEAD>Adjusting the Census: Politics vs. Statistics?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After the forms are filled in and the
computers are whirring away, the time will come for one of the most
controversial political decisions ever for the U.S. Census _
whether to adjust the results to make up for undercounting in some
areas.
   None of the 20 prior U.S. censuses has managed to count
everybody and no one expects this national head count to be perfect
either.
   But this year, for the first time, some statisticians believe
they can significantly improve the results by adjusting the final
numbers.
   And since the final figures are used to distribute billions of
dollars in federal funds _ and seats in the House of
Representatives _ forces on both sides of the issue are already at
war.
   A Census Bureau analysis estimated that the 1980 national head
count missed more than 3 million people, or 1.4 percent of the
population.
   It wouldn't make much difference if that were spread out evenly,
but it isn't. Minorities and poor people living in large cities are
missed more often than others.
   It's harder to count Hispanics too, especially those who are
here illegally.
   Men are missed more often than women; young people more than the
elderly; and overall, young black men are missed most often.
   New York and a group of other large cities, contending the
undercount cheated them of money and representation, sued for an
adjustment in the 1980 census. The government responded that it was
unable to improve the count, and the courts rejected the suit.
   But in the meantime, statisticians worked out methods they
believe can make the necessary adjustments and improve the census.
Their plan would use an extensive post-census survey in selected
areas to check on how many people were missed.
   By comparing that survey with the census for the same regions
they could estimate the undercount. The estimate then could be used
to adjust the figures for all similar areas. Enough surveys would
allow adjustment of the whole census, statisticians contend.
   But in 1987, the Commerce Department announced there would be no
adjustment in 1990. Department officials contended the methods were
not proven and that changing the numbers would shake public
confidence in the figures.
   Since the blacks and other minorities most often missed are
mostly Democrats, there was an outcry that the decision was a crass
political move by the Reagan administration.
   Barbara A. Bailer, a top Census official, resigned over the
action, saying the Census bureau hadn't been consulted by the
Commerce Department.
   And New York City, New York state, California, Los Angeles,
Chicago, Houston, Dade County, Fla., and several civil rights
groups filed another lawsuit.
   That one was settled with an agreement that the government would
reconsider adjustment and would publish criteria for deciding
whether to adjust the figures.
   The final decision on adjustment is to be made by July 15, 1991
_ 15 months after the April 1 official count.
   But those backing an adjustment say the decision has already
been made.
   The guidelines suggest changing the count only if it can be
shown that the results would be more accurate on both a national
and local level, and discourage adjustment if it would result in
confusion, disrupt the political process or undermine public
confidence in the census numbers.
   The proposed guidelines ``so stack the deck against the
possibility of correction that their adoption will be tantamount to
a decision not to correct the differential undercount,'' charged
New York Attorney General Robert Abrams.
   Michael R. Darby, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs,
said the department hopes to take such an accurate census that
adjustment won't be needed. But if adjustment has to be considered,
he said, the guidelines are still under development and can be
modified.
   Observed Rep. William R. Thomas, R-Calif.: ``The census is a
political act and there are winners and losers. The losers say
`count differently,' and the winners say `leave it alone.'''
   Meanwhile, the Census Bureau says it is hiring 315,000 temporary
workers, in addition to its usual staff, to track down people who
don't mail back the census forms they will receive in late March.
   In April and May 200,000 census workers will go into
neighborhoods, small towns and across rural America to interview
people. Another 115,000 workers will remain in offices tabulating
information and contacting people by phone, officials said.

   A 7-pound baby boy was found in a paper
bag in a hospital parking lot by a driver who had steered around
the sack.
   ``Baby Doe,'' 1 to 2 days old, was doing well Sunday at
Southwest Washington Medical Center.
   Vicky Morrow was taking her mother to the hospital for a checkup
Saturday evening when she spotted the bag.
   She said she avoided running it over because she thought it
might contain glass or nails and damage her tires. After she got
out of the car, she said, she heard the baby crying.
   The baby, wrapped in a towel, was taken to the emergency room
and was found to be in good condition without any apparent ill
effects from the cool temperatures, which were in the 40s, said
nursing supervisor Libby Sturtevant.
   Sheriff's deputies have npt determined who abandoned the infant.

   Two generations of aviation history
will be linked April 19 when a scarf once worn by Amelia Earhart
rockets into space aboard the space shuttle Discovery, Purdue
University officials say.
   The scarf was presented Saturday to astronauts Jerry L. Ross and
Donald E. Williams, both alumni of Purdue, where Earhart trained
for the 1937 around-the-world flight during which she disappeared
over the Pacific.
   Ross and Williams will take the scarf to the Johnson Space
Center in Houston and give it to fellow astronaut and Purdue alumni
Loren Shriver, who will command the shuttle mission.
   The square brown, gold and orange silk scarf is part of a
collection of Earhart memorabilia at Purdue, where she was a
counselor to female students from 1935-37.
   ``When Amelia Earhart made her flights, it was a breakthrough in
aviation at the time,'' said Helen Q. Schroyer, a Purdue librarian
who has cared the memorabilia. ``Amelia Earhart and our astronauts
share that pioneering spirit.''
   The shuttle flight will deploy the Hubble space telescope.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Rafael Angel
Calderon, the driven son of a discredited former president, plans
to focus his energies on ``improving social justice'' in his
country.
   Calderon, who founded his Social Christian party, defeated
Carlos Manue Castillo of the incumbent National Liberation Party in
Sunday's election.
   He will succeed President Oscar Arias, who could not succeed
himself.
   Calderon, 40, is a clear supporter of Washington's policy in
Latin America.
   He backs U.S. aid to help El Salvador fight its leftist
guerrilla insurgency and visited Panama to congratulate President
Guillermo Endara shortly after the U.S. invasion that toppled Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   But focusing on Costa Rica's domestic problems may affect the
dynamics of the Central American peace process, which was driven by
Arias' activist foreign policy.
   ``I will support the peace process, but I believe the main duty
of a Costa Rican president is to deal with Costa Rica's problems. I
will let my foreign minister focus on foreign policy,'' Calderon
said at a news conference Friday.
   Calderon's campaign culminated a long effort to restore the
memory of his father, Rafael Angel Calderon Guardia, who also
became president at age 40 and erved from 1940 to 1944. However, he
was exiled after he tried to nullify the results of the 1948 vote.
   Calderon, whose full name in Spanish style is Rafael Angel
Calderon Fournier, is familiarly known as ``Junior.''
   During the campaign, he agreed that the economy had improved
under two National Liberation governments, but that was not the
problem in his view.
   ``A social breach is opening in this country between rich and
poor,'' he said.
   Calderon campaigned on a populist platform that drew comparisons
to his father's social reforms, which included establishment of
social security.
   He promised a housing program for the poor and alarmed some
businessmen by saying he would require large businesses to
establish profit-sharing plans.
   But he also promised to reduce government deficit spending, and
it was not clear how he would manage both.
   His father became an ogre of Costa Rican democracy by attempting
to overturn the results of the 1948 election. After a 40-day
revolution, the army was abolished and Calderon's father was sent
into exile.
   Calderon himself was born in Nicaragua on March 14, 1949, and
spent much of his childhood in Mexico City. He eventually became a
lawyer, but he started working in his father's old party, the
Calderon Republicans, by the age of 16.
   At 21, he became director of Social Security; at 25, he was a
National Assembly delegate and at 29, he became foreign minister.
   Calderon first ran for president in 1982 for a coalition headed
by the Republicans, drawing 33 percent of the vote.
   He put some distance between himself and his father's legacy by
founding the Social Christian Unity party in 1983, and in 1986 he
made a strong losing race against Arias.
   This time he ran a careful campaign, trying to take advantage of
his father's history as a reformer without raising the specter of
1948.
   Calderon said repeatedly that he planned to focus on Costa
Rica's problems, not the problem of peace in Central America.
   That stood as an implicit criticism of Arias, who won the Nobel
Prize in 1987 for his efforts to obtain regional agreements to
bring peace to El Salvador and Nicaragua.
   Calderon is seen as likely to maintain close relations with
Salvador's President Alfredo Cristiani, Guatemala's Vinicio Cerezo
and Rafael Callejas of Honduras.
   Arias, trying to present himself as an honest broker, was
careful to avoid the appearance of ganging up on Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega's Sandinistas.
   Calderon also supports the creation of a permanent 400-man
special police force to deal with emergency situations, including
border incidents.
   The proposal is somewhat controversial since Costa Rica has no
army and only lightly armed police because of his own father's
actions.
   Calderon, a devout Roman Catholic, married Gloria Bejarano de
Calderon, a native of Mexico, in 1972. They have four children,
Rafael Angel, Gloria, Gabriela and Marco Antonio.

   A singer and a technician in the rap group LL
Cool J were acquitted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl
after a concert last August.
   A Hennepin County jury returned the verdict Sunday after
deliberating since Friday.
   Singer David James Parker, 26, whose stage name is Busy Bee, and
technician Gary Chris Saunders, 27, both of New York City, had been
charged with first-degree criminal sexual assault.
   The victim, now 16, testified that Parker and Saunders forced
her to perform oral sex on them while six to 10 other men watched
and encouraged the assault in a bathroom of a room in L'Hotel
Sofitel.
   At a separate trial in December, a jury convicted LL Cool J's
bodyguard, Christopher Tsipouras, 22, of Union, N.J., of raping the
girl alone shortly before the others arrived. He was sentenced to
10 years in prison.

authorities said.
   Angela Terrell was in fair condition Sunday night at Children's
Mercy Hospital, where she was recovering from frostbite to her

   Police found the girl early Sunday in the Mayflower school bus

   Temperatures fell to 24 degrees Saturday night.
   The bus driver was fired for failing to inspect the bus before
leaving the route, said Kyle Martin, spokesman for Mayflower

   Congressional Democrats, frustrated that
President Bush is winning high approval ratings without addressing
what they see as the hard problems of governing, are ready for an
election-year session with a sharp partisan edge.
   Bush's State of the Union speech last week crystallized the
feelings of many on Capitol Hill who saw it as a glowing vision of
America without any substantive support.
   The budget Bush sent to Congress two days earlier largely
ignored areas like education, health care and the environment, they
said. And for a Democratic Party that has lost five of the last six
presidential elections, the frustration is beginning to boil over.
   ``Apparently we're not getting our message across to people who
consider themselves to be Democrats,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio,
D-Calif. ``We have to sharpen the message.''
   One way to do that, according to a growing number of House
Democrats, is to be more willing to take Bush on directly rather
than seeking compromise and accommodation.
   Use Democratic power in Congress to send the president popular
legislation, and let him veto it if he disagrees, the reasoning
goes. That will draw sharper ideological lines between the parties
and more clearly tell voters what Democrats stand for.
   The subject was a frequent topic at a private retreat last week
attended by about 160 members of the House Democratic Caucus. The
two-day ``issues conference'' in suburban Columbia, Md., was a
chance for lawmakers to listen to pollsters talk about voters'
wants and fears and to talk to each other about how to get the
party back on the track to the White House.
   ``We think there's a growing anxiety about our drifting'' as a
nation, said House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., ``our drifting
toward a lower standard of living, our drifting toward less
competence in education in science and mathematics, our growing
problems in international competition ... Americans want something
better than that.''
   It's clear that Bush is personally popular, Foley said. ``But we
do have a difference over the emphasis we should be giving to some
of these problems, and we're going to try to speak about those more
clearly and more dramatically in the days ahead ... Where we have
disagreements, the American people expect us to raise our voices
and take our stand.''
   Democrats at the conference took broad philosophical looks at
topics like the role of government, economic opportunity and the
role of the United States in the world. Members came up with a
series of ``bold ideas'' for party initiatives that will continue
to be refined, said caucus Chairman Steny Hoyer, D-Md., adding that
most address voters' concerns about future security.
   ``People think they're doing pretty well, but they're concerned
about their children. They're not as optimistic as they were,''
Hoyer said. The better Democrats address those fears, ``the better
we're going to do electorally,'' he said.
   Hoyer acknowledged that Democrats must overcome lingering
perceptions that they are softer than Republicans on national
defense and crime. ``We want to make sure America stays strong. We
haven't conveyed that as well as we should have,'' he said.
   It remained unclear which issues Democrats will choose for
confrontations with the White House _ and where the party could
find the cohesion to make such an attack work.
   The proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to cut the
Social Security payroll tax has divided the party. Moynihan
contends Republican administrations have been using surplus funds
from the tax to mask the size of the budget deficit instead of
putting the money aside for future Social Security payments.
   There was no consensus among Democrats at the retreat, and
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., conceded it was hard to
find quick agreement in such a large group. ``This proposal is very
far-reaching in its implications. We don't think it's a trivial
matter. We're going to take our time,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Slovenia's liberal Communists have
broken with the national party over its resistance to swift
democratic change, further eroding the authority of the institution
that has ruled Yugoslavia since 1945.
   Slovenia's determination to chart its own course raises the
possibility of the disintegration of the loose Yugoslav federation,
which is riven by disputes arising from ethnic tensions and
economic troubles.
   The dispute over the pace of reform has led to the outbreak of a
virtual trade war between the relatively affluent northern republic
of Slovenia and archrival Serbia, the largest and most populous of
Yugoslavia's six republics.
   Last month, Slovenia's Communists stormed out of a national
party congress dominated by hard-liners led by Serbia.
   Yugoslavs increasingly criticize the apparent inability of the
party's fractious regional leaderships to take steps to deal with
the worst economic and political crisis under Communist rule.
   The break from the national party by the Slovenian party is the
first such rift in the 45-year rule of the Communists, whose
authority is in decline.
   By contrast, the authority of federal premier Ante Markovic and
his government, which is undertaking a radical economic reform
program, is rising.
   In Sunday's emergency meeting, the Slovenian party also changed
its name and called for the release of all political prisoners, an
end to all political trials and immediate talks between Yugoslav
Communists and leaders of newly formed opposition parties.
   It demanded that opposition political parties be legalized
throughout Yugoslavia.
   Slovenia's Communist Party president, Ciril Ribicic, said the
new party is not seeking secession from Yugoslavia but rather the
establishment of a Yugoslav confederation that restricts central
authority.
   ``This is the end of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, in
which Slovenian Communists had the status of an unequal minority,''
said Ribicic, using the formal name of the national party.
   The national party ``doesn't exist any more for us,'' said Petar
Bekes, another Slovenian party leader.
   Slovenian Communists, aware of rising criticism of Communism in
their Westward-looking region, have moved quickly in the past three
years to create a more democratic political system in the republic.
   They have scheduled multiparty elections for April and, at last
month's national party congress, told those resisting reform that
the Communist Party risks a hasty demise if it does not address the
people's democratic yearnings.
   The Slovenes have also criticize Serbia for its handling of
unrest in the southern province of Kosovo, where at least 25 ethnic
Albanian protesters have been killed in clashes with police since
Jan. 24. The Albanians, the ethnic majority in Kosovo, are
demanding more say in how their province is governed.
   The Slovenian reforms have been criticized harshly in Serbia,
where the ruling Communist hard-liners demand continued national
Communist dominance.
   Last month's national party congress was indefinitely adjourned,
but Slovenian leaders said Sunday they are not returning.
   ``We do not want to be a part of an old-style dogmatic
organization such as Yugoslavia's League of Communists,'' Bekes
told reporters. He said, however, that the Slovenian Communists
``will remain open for cooperation with all democratic-orientated
forces'' in other Yugoslav republics.
   He said Slovenia from now on will have no representatives in the
national Communist leadership, but is open to form a coalition with
the federal leadership on the national level.
   The strains between Serbia and Slovenia have led in recent weeks
to a virtual trade war. On Sunday, the state news agency Tanjug
said the governments of the republics would enter negotiations to
try and end their dispute.
   Yugoslavia's Communists were the first to break with the
Soviet-led Communist bloc in 1948. But the country has been slower
in adopting democratic reforms than other East European countries
because of its deep ethnic and economic divisions.
   Yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous
provinces, each with its own government and party structure.
   The decentralized system of government and collective federal
presidency were devised in 1974 to prevent one republic from
gaining sway over the others, but has resulted in an ineffective
government by compromise.
   The federal government is generally responsible for economic
policy while the collective presidency, which appoints the premier,
dictates defense and foreign policy. But the bulk of political
influence in the country has traditionally been concentrated in the
Communist Party.
   The Slovenian Communist party, which was formally known as
League of Communists of Slovania, changed its name to ``LCS-The
Party for Democratic Renewal.'' Its platform will be similar to
Western European social democratic parties, Bekes said.

<HEAD>Durenberger Scheduled to Face Ethics Committee This Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Dave Durenberger goes before the ethics
committee this week to explain his book contract and real estate
deal, making him the first in a long list of lawmakers facing
scrutiny this year by fellow senators.
   Durenberger's case, while less publicized than those of five
senators who received contributions from savings and loan owner
Charles Keating, has led to public disapproval in polls back home
in Minnesota and newspaper editorial calls for him to resign.
   ``There's no question that the issue has filtered down to the
grassroots level, but I also think it's still in the questioning
stage,'' says Rep. Vin Weber, a fellow Minnesota Republican. ``I
didn't have a lot of people damning Dave Durenberger. But I did
have a lot of people asking me about Dave.''
   Durenberger, a 55-year-old political moderate, denies any
intentional wrongdoing in a case that involves a book contract he
is accused of using to launder speaking fees; numerous
lobbyist-paid trips to Boston to visit a marriage counselor; and a
system under which he charged the government for staying in a
Minneapolis condominium of which he was part owner.
   He says he has given no thought to resigning the seat he won for
a third term a little more than a year ago.
   Still, he has apologized to voters for ``lapses of judgment''
and repaid the Senate $11,000 last month after the Rules Committee
said he was not entitled to reimbursements for daily expenses while
using the condo during congressional recesses.
   After Durenberger appears before the panel, the committee must
decide whether to issue a statement of possible violations, similar
to an indictment. That would trigger an investigation similar to a
trial in which the committee would decide whether violations of
ethical standards occurred.
   If violations are found, the committee could recommend
disciplinary actions ranging from a reprimand to expulsion.
   Aside from Durenberger, the ethics committee has a busy work
load.
   Also under scrutiny are five senators whose campaigns and
political causes received $1.3 million from S&amp;L owner Keating, his
relatives and employees. The five are accused of improperly
intervening with federal banking regulators on behalf of Keating,
whose Lincoln S&amp;L now ranks as the biggest thrift failure in the
nation, estimated to cost taxpayers up to $2 billion.
   The senators are John McCain, R-Ariz.; Democratic Whip Alan
Cranston of California; Donald Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the
Banking Committee; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and John Glenn,
D-Ohio.
   In a separate matter, the role of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.,
in several housing deals also is being examined.
   The House ethics committee also has several cases under review.
   Durenberger's staff has refused to discuss the senator's
expected appearance on Thursday. He has turned down requests for
interviews since telling a newspaper last month that unreleased
depositions tend to support allegations that he used the book deal
to launder speaking fees.
   The Ethics Committee hired a special counsel in August to
investigate allegations that Durenberger made $100,000 in violation
of Senate honoraria limits through a contract to promote two books
written under his name.
   The Rules Committee concluded that Durenberger was not entitled
to expense money for staying in the Minneapolis condo. He has
reimbursed the money, but committee members said other, unspecified
aspects of the deal also need to be examined by the ethics
committee.
   Several newspapers in and out of Minnesota _ including the
Mankato (Minn.) Free Press and the Boston Herald _ have called for
Durenberger to resign and polls show Minnesotans are losing faith
in him.
   More than 70 percent of Minnesota adults want Durenberger to
resign if the committee finds significant wrongdoing, according to
two statewide polls published last week.
   The case has been costly to Durenberger financially as well as
politically.
   In addition to the $11,000 he repaid the Senate, his campaign
treasury last year paid $160,059 in legal fees, and he still has
another $85,847 in unpaid bills from his lawyer, according to his
1989 campaign finance report.

suspect an 80 percent, 10-year decline for one kind _ a little gray
and white shore bird called the sanderling.
   The sanderling, which runs with abandon toward water only to
retreat from rushing waves, is being counted by volunteers for a
consortium of academics and state officials.
   Scientists suspect South Carolina coast's, with its wealth of
estuaries and marshland, is an important resting place for some
migratory birds that spend summers in the arctic and winter in the
tropics.
   ``But they haven't been able to document it yet,'' said John
Tibbets of the South Carolina Sea Grant Consortium. ``They haven't
been able to get hard numbers.''
   About 60 volunteers, with more to be hired, have been counting
birds along the coast for two years. Their census should be
complete in 1991.
   A similar census is under way in North Carolina. The results of
both counts will provide a better picture of bird migration
patterns and be the basis for future surveys to determine if
populations of certain bird species are declining.
   The census also will allow researchers determine the impact of
Hurricane Hugo on shore bird populations.
   The September storm inundated Marsh Island, for instance.
   The island is an important nesting area for egrets, herons and
terns at the Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge north of
Charleston.
   ``The storm leveled all the tall dunes and most birds will be at
risk for flooding in the spring tides,'' said Thomas Murphy of the
South Carolina Department of Wildlife and Marine Resources. ``The
pelicans will do all right but it may push other birds' nests out
to areas where they will be flooded.''
   The census also will pinpoint key nesting areas for coastal bird
colonies. Atlases will be compiled to help regulatory agencies make
sure such areas are protected.
   That, in turn, should help prevent some species from becoming
endangered, Murphy said.
   About 250 colonies that include perhaps hundreds of thousands of
wading and sea birds are spread over the state's coast, Murphy
said. He would not venture a more specific estimate of bird
populations until the census is complete.
   ``A lot of times for nine months of the year there is nothing
there,'' Murphy said. ``Then you suddenly might have thousands of
birds on a two-acre pond.''
   Scientists are concerned about development encroaching on
colonies. While the birds will adapt, ``if they have to go through
that every three years or so because of development, they
(colonies) will not be successful,'' Murphy said.
   Volunteers usually go by boat to remote areas and count around
the time of high tide because birds congregate on sand banks and
oyster banks left uncovered by the tide.
   ``They move around a lot and it's difficult to do the actual
counting. They are so mobile and so fast you have to count them in
that very narrow window,'' said Virginia Beach, a consortium
spokeswoman.

<TEXT>
   Rafael Angel Calderon, the son of an
exiled president, won Sunday's presidential election, defeating the
governing party's candidate to succeed Oscar Arias, architect of
Central America's peace process.
   ``I feel very proud of my country tonight. This is a victory for
all of you, the people of Costa Rica,'' Calderon, a strong
supporter of U.S. policy in the region, said in a statement at his
Social Christian party headquarters.
   Calderon was leading Carlos Manuel Castillo by 178,571 votes to
169,352, according to official returns representing about 20
percent of the vote. The count was suspended for the night and was
to resume at noon Monday.
   ``I accept the verdict of the people. Today we have elected
liberty and democracy to the presidency of Costa Rica,'' Castillo
said in a concession statement at the National Liberation party's
election headquarters.
   Most of the tabulated returns came from Castillo's stronghold of
San Jose, and Calderon was expected to expand his lead when the
votes from his rural strongholds started coming in.
   More than 80 percent of the nation's 1.7 million registered
voters were expected to turn out.
   Calderon will take office May 8 for a four-year term.
   Arias, who won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his efforts to
bring peace to Central America, cannot succeed himself.
   Calderon's victory marked the 10th straight peaceful election in
Costa Rica since 1948, when Calderon's father, Rafael Angel
Calderon Guardia, was president and tried to nullify the result
when his party lost.
   ``My sympathy goes out to my opponent, Mr. Castillo, and his
followers. I know what they are going through. I went through it
four years ago,'' said Calderon, 40, who made losing presidential
bids in 1982 and 1986.
   He asked his followers to celebrate without gloating or rancor
and called on ``those who did not vote for me to join us and fight
for a better future for Costa Rica.''
   Party faithful were out in force, waving flags and honking horns
in rhythm. Buses took thousands to the polls, where crowds of
teen-agers decked out in colorful T-shirts guided voters to their
precincts.
   Some who celebrated Saturday night were lined up at 5 a.m. when
the polls opened. Police blocked streets near hospitals to hold
down the sound of a festival that jammed streets of the capital
throughout the day and continued after the polls closed.
   The fiesta continued into the night for Calderon's supporters.
   Both major candidates ran populist campaigns aimed at the poor
in this country of 2.9 million. The campaign was devoid of
specifics, however.
   Castillo was hurt by disclosures about drug trafficking and
corruption, but in keeping with the tradition of Costa Rican
politics, Calderon did not press those issues as hard as he might
have.
   Calderon founded the Social Christian party in part to shed the
legacy of his father.
   But the president-elect still calls his father, who served as
president from 1940 to 1944, the greatest Costa Rican president of
this century. The elder Calderon was exiled after he tried to
nullify the 1948 election results, an incident that led to the
abolition of Costa Rica's army.
   Calderon has said he supports Arias' peace efforts but won't try
to imitate them, and will focus on domestic issues and ``improving
social justice.''
   Calderon, whose father founded Costa Rica's social security
system, has promised a new housing program for the poor while at
the same time saying he would reduce the government's deficit
spending.
   He also has proposed requiring large companies to establish
profit-sharing plans, something that has made some businessmen
nervous.
   Voters also elected 57 national assembly delegates and filled
525 municipal posts.
   Prisoners, each escorted by a guard, were permitted to vote for
the first time in Costa Rican history.
   ``It's a step towards the perfection of Costa Rican democracy,''
said human rights advocate Nancy Hernandez.
   In an exercise to reinforce the understanding of and commitment
to democracy, more than 9,500 children under age 12 went to their
own polling places in a mock election and Castillo won, taking
4,885 votes, or 50.6 percent, to 4,693, or 48.6 percent, for
Calderon.
   The voting took place only in San Jose, where the incumbent
party is strong.
   Joao Baena Soares, secretary general of the Organization of
American States, praised Costa Rica's democratic tradition but
refused to compare it to Nicaragua, where a controversial campaign
winds up on Feb. 25.
   He noted, however, that the OAS sent only four observers,
including himself, to Costa Rica. On election day in Nicaragua
there will be 400 OAS observers, he said.

   President Bush's new defense budget doesn't
offer a long-range vision for the Pentagon in a time of
revolutionary change, but it gives some short-term clues about how
this commander-in-chief wants the military to prepare for the years
to come.
   Bush said his $292.1 billion defense budget for 1991 offers a
chance to ``restructure America's defenses'' in the wake of
Europe's revolutionary changes, and he made headlines with last
week's proposal to strip hundreds of thousands of U.S. and Soviet
troops from the European continent.
   But the budget proposal also reveals a conservative,
take-it-slow approach in many areas.
   The 1991 plan takes only tentative steps into a new era with a
modest troop reduction of 38,000 in the coming year, cutbacks in
about 20 minor conventional weapon programs, and continued funding
for several futuristic weapons systems from the Reagan
administration, such as the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Dramatic change is difficult to achieve in one year, Pentagon
officials say, given the long lead time required to adjust
high-tech weapons programs and to reduce the military force of 2.1
million.
   ``We are prepared to cut the defense budget, but please let us
do it in an orderly fashion,'' Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told
the Senate Armed Services Committee last week.
   Cheney, appearing Sunday on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation''
program, said it ``makes no sense'' to cut major weapons programs
now because ``we have to deal with Soviet military capabilities and
not just intentions.''
   ``There is still enormous nuclear capability'' and the Soviets
have not shown they are prepared to change that, Cheney said.
   But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said on
NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press'' that continued spending for the MX
missile was unnecessary. ``I don't think there's any chance that
the administration's proposal to fund both (the MX and Midgetman)
will be enacted,'' he said.
   The budget opts for continued modernization of the nation's
strategic nuclear forces, including funds for more B-2 stealth
bombers, MX missiles, the Midgetman missile, a Trident submarine
and Trident missiles.
   The cuts in conventional weapons came more easily, the secretary
said, because fewer such arms will be needed as the military force
is reduced.
   The Army has argued that in an era of lessened superpower
conflict in Europe, it now must prepare for Third World,
low-intensity conflicts that require a lighter, more flexible
force, as demonstrated in the Panama invasion.
   As a result, the Army procurement budget was cut by $4 billion
from last year, but its research and development programs grew by
$1 billion, in the interest of developing such things as a light
tank.
   The announced base closures were designed to accommodate those
decisions, said one Army general involved in the planning. ``We
closed a number of ammunition depots and such because we just don't
need that much ammunition,'' said the general, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The Army is bearing the brunt of the force cutback with a 17,000
reduction, while the Air Force would be cut by 15,000 and the Navy
by 6,000 men and women. The Marine Corps was spared any major
personnel cuts.
   By most accounts, it is a better paid, better prepared and more
heavily armed military force, one that Gen. Colin Powell, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned Congress last week must not be
slashed willy-nilly amid the calls for foreign-based troop
withdrawals and tight budgets.
   ``You'll start to break the great force we've put together in
the past 10 years,'' Powell warned.
   Even if Bush's call to draw U.S. troop levels down to 225,000 in
Europe is agreed upon, it would take place over a span of one to
two years, Cheney told lawmakers.
   In the budget, none of the Air Force's major programs _ such as
the B-2 stealth bomber or the MX missile system _ were impaired.
However, the service will retire 14 1950-era B-52 conventional
bombers based on Guam, the only such unit based outside the
continental United States.
   Despite headlines over the decision to mothball two World War
II-era battleships, the Navy eluded some of the major cuts aimed at
the other services. But Cheney told reporters that even the
service's 14 aircraft carriers are not sacrosanct in an era of
declining budgets.
   The Navy took a major cut in research and development funds, due
in part to Cheney's decision to cancel the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor
aircraft.
   Congress expressed some impatience with Cheney's lack of
information on long-range Pentagon plans for troop cuts and weapons
programs, with Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., complaining of ``a number of blanks in the budget.''
   Cheney promised to provide more information when he releases his
five-year plan in April.
   ``The fact of the matter is, this is a dynamic world we live in
... We have not made final decisions in many areas because you
can't,'' Cheney said.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Backs Tax Subsidy for Corn-Based Fuel Enhancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is moving ahead with a
controversial plan to allow a new corn-based octane enhancer to
qualify for a 60-cents-a-gallon tax subsidy for alcohol fuels even
though it will cost the Treasury an estimated $192 million in lost
revenue over the next three years.
   In addition, administration officials acknowledged last week
that the planned subsidy _ sought primarily by corn growers and the
growing alcohol fuel industry _ likely will be held to be in
violation of international trade agreements as an illegal subsidy.
   Nonetheless, Assistant Treasury Secretary Kenneth W. Gideon told
the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee his department plans
to make the lead substitute, ethyl tertiary butyl ether or ETBE,
eligible for the tax credit ``in the near future.''
   Although the ETBE technically is a compound of ethanol and
petroleum-based isobutylene and not a mixture of alcohol and
gasoline as required by the 1980 law, Gideon said the Treasury
``did not believe Congress ... chose to use the word `mixture' in
its narrow technical sense.''
   Expanding the credit to cover ETBE has won the support of 75
senators. However, it has raised the ire of the fossil fuels
industry, which has a competing product, and several tax writers in
the House.
   Rep. Frank Guarini, D-N.J., cited administration estimates that
the ETBE tax credit will cost $2 billion over the next 10 years if
Congress votes to continue the alcohol fuel subsidies, which now
are set to expire in 1993.
   ``Without consulting Congress, you decided (something) that is
going to cost an additional $2 billion,'' he said. ``Joe Sixpack or
the fellows working in the steel mills in Ohio are now going to
have to pay that $2 billion.''

   Rep. Jim Jontz, D-Ind., says he is optimistic
about the prospects for including his sustainable agriculture
proposal in the 1990 farm bill.
   The Jontz legislation, which would create a new voluntary option
in the farm program, encourages producers to reduce their use of
manufactured chemicals and fertilizers by instilling greater
flexibility into federal farm programs.
   ``Regrettably, present farm policies, particularly the base
acreage requirements, force producers to plant the maximum amount
of program acreage annually,'' Jontz said. ``This inflexibility
hurts the environment by requiring greater use of manufactured
chemicals and fertilizers.''
   The Jontz bill has about 20 co-sponsors and is the vehicle in
the House for getting language on sustainable agriculture into law
this year.
   In the Senate, similar legislation is pending and lawmakers
there have been vocal about the need for flexibility in the
upcoming farm bill.
   On Friday, Sen. Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., told the National Grain
Trade Council that ``flexibility is more than this year's
catchword. ... It must be central to our farm bill deliberations.''
   ``What a cruel paradox it would be if Congress didn't give
farmers the flexibility they need to rotate crops and reduce
chemical use, but instead saddled them with new regulations
intended to force a reduction in the chemicals they apply,'' said
Kerrey.

<TEXT>
   Masked guerrillas armed with guns and
grenades attacked a bus carrying 31 Israeli tourists on a desert
road to Cairo Sunday, killing at least nine people and wounding 17,
officials and news reports said.
   At least two Egyptians on board the bus were among those shot,
according to the reports.
   An unidentified man telephoned the Cairo bureau of a Western
news agency and said the attack was to punish President Hosni
Mubarak and security officials for alleged torture in Egyptian
prisons.
   It was the worst attack on Israelis in Egypt since 1985 and the
deadliest single act of terror in the nation since Moslem
extremists killed President Anwar Sadat and seven others with him
on a parade viewing stand on Oct. 6, 1981.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, speaking in a telephone
interview with Israel TV, said the attack ``proves that hostility
towards Israel still exists and runs amok in the region.''
   Mubarak telephone Shamir and issued a statement that said he
regretted ``the monstrous aggression against Israeli tourists.'' He
said the attack was aimed at thwarting efforts for Middle East
peace, said the government-run Middle East News Agency, or MENA.
   Egypt, the only Arab country to have peace with Israel, has been
mediating efforts to get talks started between Israeli officials
and representatives of Palestinians who have waged a 2-year-old
uprising against Israeli rule of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The bus was carrying the Israelis to Cairo from Rafeh, a divided
town on the Egypt-Israel border in the Sinai Peninsula, when it was
attacked near the Suez Canal town of Ismailiya, 40 miles from the
capital, said a statement issued by the Egyptian government.
   Two men in a white Peugeot station wagon stopped the bus, got
out of the car and opened fire with machine guns, then hurled four
hand grenades before fleeing. Two grenades exploded, said the
statement carried by MENA.
   The government account was similar to that of a witness, Miriam
Kadmon, who was quoted by Israel army radio.
   She said the driver of the car signaled the bus to stop and that
the attackers smashed the car's rear window and opened fire. An
Egyptian on the bus began screaming, jumped out of the vehicle and
was shot dead, she said.
   ``Everyone saw his death in front of his eyes. ... It seemed
like an eternity, but in fact it lasted for several minutes only,''
said another survivor, Dr. Yigal Barak, who spoke on army radio in
a telephone interview from an Ismailiya hospital.
   ``Then there was a total quiet, and only screams were heard,''
he said. ``Bodies were scattered everywhere.''
   The government statement said eight people were killed and 17
wounded. It said the dead, taken to hospitals in Cairo and
Ismailiya, included three women.
   Israel radio said a ninth person died early Monday and put the
number of wounded at 18.
   MENA issued a partial list of the wounded, including 13 Israelis
and Egyptian tour guide Wadia Gamil Sorial, 27. Unconfirmed reports
said the tour guide and the bus driver, also an Egyptian, were
killed.
   The total number of Egyptians aboard was not known, but reports
indicated there may have been as many as four.
   Baruch Binah, a spokesman for Israel's Foreign Ministry, said he
could not provide a final casualty figure because the process of
gathering information was ``so slow as to be almost painful.''
   The gunmen spoke Arabic with non-Egyptian accents, the Egyptian
government statement said, suggesting they were either Palestinian
or from other Arab countries.
   Israel's armed forces radio said a caller speaking to a Western
news agency in Cairo claimed responsibility on behalf of the
Organization for the Defense of Oppressed in Egyptian Prisons, a
previously unknown group.
   MENA said Egypt's interior minister, Abdel-Halim Mousa, who is
in charge of police, rushed to the scene with other senior security
officials.
   Israel television said Israeli armed forces prepared a special
plane to evacuate the wounded from Cairo.
   Mubarak telephoned Shamir to express condolences to families of
the victims. Mubarak ``stressed that nothing should ever obstruct
the peace process but (this incident) should be an incentive for
going ahead ... to reach a final settlement of the Arab-Israeli
conflict,'' MENA said.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman George Malleck said,
``This horrible act of terrorism is to be condemned by civilized
people everywhere'' and called it and ``attempt by the enemies of
peace to halt efforts at reconciliation and dialogue.''
   He said the U.S. Embassy was in contact with Egyptian
authorities and offered medical assistance.
   Israel army radio said the bus belonged to an Egyptian tourist
company identified as Santa Maria.
   The tour was organized by Ofakim, an Israeli tourist company.
Albert Levy, an Ofakim manager, said the Israelis had begun an
eight-day tour of Egypt. He said 12 members of the group were
residents of Mevasseret-Ziyyon, a suburb of Jerusalem.
   Egypt and Israel signed a U.S.-mediated peace treaty in 1979.
There have been several incidents of violence against Israeli
diplomats or tourists in Egypt.
   On Aug. 20, 1985, an Israeli diplomat was fatally shot in Cairo
while three Israeli Embassy employees were on their way to work.
The diplomat's wife and another woman were also wounded in the
attack.
   On Oct. 6, 1985 an Egyptian policeman opened automatic gunfire
on Israeli tourists in the Sinai Peninsula resort of Ras Burka, 28
miles south of the border checkpoint of Taba, killing seven people.
The policeman also shot his commanding officer in the incident.
   On July 6, a Palestinian shouting ``the glory of Allah'' grabbed
the steering wheel and forced an Israeli bus over a cliff eight
miles west of Jerusalem, killing 14 people when the bus exploded in
flames.

<HEAD>Pit Bulls the Subject of New Legal Dogfight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The gruesome death of an elderly woman after
an attack by two pit bull terriers has revived a legal dogfight
between pet owners and authorities over the regulation of vicious
canines.
   The issue centers on whether cities should pass ordinances
specifically citing pit bulls _ a breed the American Kennel Club
says does not exist among its 141 registered varieties.
   Animal control officers and politicians have adopted an
I-know-one-when-I-see-one stance, and insist the dogs that fit the
general pit bull description are more vicious than others and need
to be regulated more closely.
   Both sides have had victories. Last year, the kennel club
successfully challenged a New York City law requiring that pit
bulls be neutered, tattooed with a registration number, and
leashed, muzzled or confined at all times.
   But an Overland Park, Kan., law requiring the dogs to wear
muzzles when out of their homes or kennels survived a lawsuit by
pit bull owners that went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined
to review the case.
   In Florida's Dade County, pit bull owners must pay a $50
registration and keep the dogs indoors or locked in a cage or a
6-foot-high pen. Outside, the dogs must be leashed and muzzled.
   After an attack in the Happy Valley, Ore., pit bull owners
managed to block an ordinance that would have had the animals and
other vicious dogs put to death or removed from the Portland-area
city.
   In California, a law took effect in January establishing a
uniform system of review, hearing and punishment for owners of
vicious dogs. But the law also bans counties and cities from
enacting their own regulations ``if they are specific to breed.''
   Focusing on any one breed ``is cutesy, shortcut politics'' aimed
at getting maximum attention, said Alan J. Stern, American Kennel
Club vice president.
   ``You make a dog vicious. You beat it, deny it affection, apply
electric shock, put down its food dish and take it away,'' said
Stern. ``These dogs are bad because of bad people.''
   He said 21 states and 183 cities have bans that do not mention
specific breeds.
   But Los Angeles Animal Control Lt. Michael Burns, who is
overseeing the investigation of the dog-mauling death of
70-year-old Marjee Lilly, said there are enough specifics about pit
bulls to adopt a law regulating them.
   ``This is the year of the pit bull ban,'' he said.
   He said arguments by opponents of pit bull bans about the
absence of genetic differences between breeds fall down in the
reality of backyard breeding used to produce dogs that most people
accept as pit bulls.
   ``You have a dog that has aggressive tendencies enhanced through
constant and incestuous breeding,'' Burns said. ``If there are some
recessive genes on the aggressive or psychotic side, they will make
themselves manifest.''
   Mrs. Lilly, of San Diego, was visiting her grandson at his home
and was attacked by his two dogs when she tried to feed them.
   The 4-foot-11 inch, 130-pound woman was alone at the time and
was mauled by the dogs for a half hour. She died Jan. 17, one day
after the attack.
   Her death prompted Gov. George Deukmejian to say he would
consider legislation restricting the ownership of pit bulls. Such
legislation would override the current law he signed.
   But Stern said the dogs that attacked Mrs. Lilly were
mixed-breed boxers. He called the immediate identification as pit
bulls typical of the trend by police, animal control officers and
the media to write off all vicious dogs as pit bulls.
   ``Pit bulls have been identified at one time or another as 27
different breeds,'' he said. ``It's a handle. If there's a dog
attack, then it's a pit bull.''
   Pit bull is generally applied to Staffordshire bull terriers,
the American Staffordshire terrier, the American pit bull terrier
and sometimes the bull terrier.
   Bred for dog fighting, they have a powerful chest, neck and jaw
muscles.
   And those are the features that backyard buyers of pit bulls are
most interested in, said Burns. He said a dog generically called a
pit bull can be bought for around $15 to $30 in Los Angeles.
   ``It just has to have the characteristics you talk about when
you are describing a fighting dog,'' he said.
   And they are different, Burns insisted.
   ``There's an absence of the normal sounds a dog makes when it
attacks,'' said Burns, who trained sentry dogs for the military.
``It's almost a workmanlike way they hold on in an attack. It's a
persistence I haven't seen in any other breed.''

   A group of people in this southern
Oregon community are saying ``nyet'' to establishing a sister city
with the Soviet town of Rubtsovsk.
   ``While we feel profound sympathy for the subjugated people of
the U.S.S.R., as well as the peoples of the 49 Communist-dominated
nations of the world, we feel no sisterly kinship with the city of
Rubtsovsk,'' a petition being circulated states.
   The petition goes on to say that sister city projects are ``a
danger to America's national security and a terrible insult and
discouragement to oppressed people who live under the Communist
yoke.''
   Gedney Webb, who drafted the petition, says those who sign it
are opposed to any formal relations with a ``totalitarian regime.''
   Cindy Patterson, who has visited Rubtsovsk in central Siberia
and who has been active in the sister city campaign, said the
opposition group is ignoring the future.
   ``I really look at this from the aspect of securing a safe
future for my children,'' said Patterson.
   She said establishing ties with Soviet cities has improved
relations at a personal level, avoiding much of the political
friction created by the differing systems.
   Webb plans to present his petition to the City Council on
Wednesday, when it considers the sister-city proposal.

   Letting your spouse's words go in one ear
and out the other may indicate a happy marriage, research suggests.
   Laura L. Stafford, an assistant professor of communication at
Ohio State University, said her study showed that strangers recall
more of their conversations than married couples.
   ``It appears obvious that at the early stage of a relationship
you are listening closely to what a person is saying and forming
impressions and evaluations _ asking yourself, `Do I like this
person?''' Ms. Stafford said recently.
   ``By the time you are in a stable marriage, you are no longer
forming impressions and evaluations of your spouse _ not on a
routine basis, anyway. So you don't recall as much detail from a
conversation.''
   Ms. Stafford has conducted studies concerning the ability to
recall conversations.
   One study concluded that married couples remembered the general
topic of their discussion, but strangers recalled more detail.
   ``Happy couples may be talking for the sake of talking. You
don't really know what you talked about with your wife, but you
know you had a good talk,'' Ms. Stafford said.
   Unhappy couples may recall more from their conversations because
they are re-evaluating the relationship.

   The popularity of what 100 years ago was a
protein substitute for the toothless has spread into the nation's
most-popular sandwich filler, consumed by an estimated 40 million
Americans in an average day.
   Peanut butter _ conceived by an anonymous St. Louis physician in
1890 as a soft edible for his toothless patients _ turns 100 this
year.
   The Peanut Advisory Board has designated March 1 as National
Peanut Butter Day, and has planned centenary celebrations
throughout the year.
   ``It has the staying power that doesn't exist in many products
in America,'' said Mitch Head, the group's executive director. ``It
has survived all the food fads in America from tofu to sushi.''
   The secret to peanut butter's popularity? It's inexpensive,
convenient and relatively healthy. Americans consumed a record 800
million pounds of it last year, or about 3.3 pounds apiece.

<HEAD>Banks, Other Lenders Seek To Reduce Loan Defaults</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banks and other lenders in three years doubled
the money recovered from delinquent student loan borrowers by using
aggressive tactics that included garnishing lottery winnings and
putting liens on real estate, a study shows.
   Lenders in the Guaranteed Student Loan Program ``introduced
innovative procedures to forestall default'' and increase
recoveries from $200 million in fiscal year 1986 to more than $400
million in fiscal year 1989, Pelavin Associates, a Washington, D.C.
research firm, said Sunday.
   Pelavin conducted three national studies on the GSL program for
a consortium of guarantee agencies in Colorado, Massachusetts,
Tennessee, Texas and Washington state.
   The program, created by Congress in 1965, has made higher
education possible for more than 20 million Americans.
   Government student loan programs have been harshly criticized in
recent years because of spiralling default rates, mainly among
trade and vocational schools.
   The GSL program, administered by 56 guarantee agencies that
protect private lenders against losses from loan defaults, had
$51.6 billion in student loans entering repayment status in fiscal
year 1988. The federal government is the ultimate guarantor of the
loans.
   According to the new studies, eighteen guarantee agencies
improved their recovery rates by more than 10 percent and 22
agencies saw improvements between 5 percent and 10 percent.

   A study says jobs for the unskilled and poorly
educated are disappearing, and future employment will require, if
not higher education, at least good communications skills and basic
ability in math and reading.
   Radical changes are occurring in the size and composition of the
work force that will affect the nation for decades to come, even as
U.S. businesses confront the challenge of foreign competition and
new technology, reports the private Population Reference Bureau.
   The study, ``America in the 21st Century: Human Resource
Development,'' says the 1990s provide a window of opportunity for
facing the nation's human and workplace problems _ problems which,
if ignored, could produce dire consequences.
   ``The 1990s provides a unique opportunity for addressing human
resource needs. If we postpone the choice at hand, demographic
factors in the years ahead could push us to the edge of a
formidable crisis,'' conclude the authors of the study, Carol J. De
Vita and William P. O'Hare.
   The nation is in transition from an industrial to a service
economy, which means most new jobs will require education and
skills, the authors say.
   Managerial, professional and technical jobs will have the
highest rates of growth in the years ahead, while the greatest
number of new jobs are expected to be in retail sales, office
workers, cleaners and waiters and waitresses.

<HEAD>Some 9.7 million People Jailed in Year Ending June 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 9.7 million people were jailed in the
United States during the year that ended June 30, 1988, the Justice
Department says.
   During the same year, some 9.6 million people were released from
jail, said the Office of Justice Statistics study released Sunday.
   Both numbers represented increases of 20 percent over 1983
figures, it said.
   The average jail stay was three days, with 39 percent of inmates
spending one day or less behind bars, 23 percent spending two to
four days and 10 percent spending five to seven days, according to
the study.
   About 3 percent served more than six months and 1 percent spent
more than a year behind bars.
   On June 30, 1988, the jail population totaled 343,569, or 144 of
every 100,000 Americans, the study said. That rate was 47 percent
higher than the 98 per 100,000 five years earlier.
   The study focused on local jails, defined as locally
administered confinement facilities holding people awaiting trial
or sentenced to terms usually of a year or less. About 51 percent
of the people in jail had not been convicted of any crime when they
were incarcerated, while 49 percent had been convicted, the same
level as in 1983, the study found.
   The census did not include facilities in Connecticut, Delaware,
Hawaii, Rhode Island and Vermont that combine jails with prisons,
which are state or federal institutions.

<TEXT>
   Forty years after a copy writer for a small
advertising agency took a taffy-like substance invented by accident
and called it Silly Putty, the toy in the plastic egg is still
making an impression.
   Binney &amp; Smith Inc., Silly Putty's maker, sells more than 3
million eggs a year of the bounceable, moldable, stretchable toy
capable of lifting images from newspapers.
   And this spring, the Easton-based company plans to add four
fluorescent colors of Silly Putty to the pinkish silicone rubber.
   These colors mark the first change in the product since Peter C.
Hodgson borrowed $147 in 1950 to market a researcher's failed
attempt at making synthetic rubber during World War II.
   ``Dads and moms may get a little jealous because they didn't
have these things, but maybe their kids will share,'' said Dennis
Malloy, Binney &amp; Smith's director of business development.
   The privately held company, which also makes Crayola crayons and
Liquitex fine arts products, bought the rights to Silly Putty in
1977, a year after Hodgson's death.
   Hodgson's son, Peter Jr., said Silly Putty's simplicity has
allowed it to stretch over two generations.
   ``It demands something of people so it animates you,'' said
Hodgson, a professor of Russian literature at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
   ``It really is what it says it is: a liquid solid,'' he said.
``It's just a paradox, a kind of puzzle, an enigma you can hold in
your hand.''
   The elder Hodgson, who envisioned Silly Putty as a therapeutic
diversion for adults, began the business in a converted barn in
North Branford, Conn., and shipped the product to retailers in
pasteboard egg crates.
   Since then, more than 200 million eggs of Silly Putty _ more
than 3,000 tons _ have been sold.
   Silly Putty, which has survived copycats such as Nutty Putty and
Goofy Goo, has been pressed into service in some unusual ways.
   The elder Hodgson gave Apollo 8 astronauts Silly Putty in
sterling silver eggs for their 1968 trip to the moon, and they used
it to keep tools from floating away in weightlessness.
   Athletes squeeze it to strengthen their hands, and physical
therapists recommend it for patients recovering from hand or wrist
injuries.
   And New York City artist George Horner uses Silly Putty in his
work, which sells for as much as $5,000.
   ``I do consider myself a serious artist even though I work with
Silly Putty,'' said Horner, whose works inside Silly Putty-filled
frames address topics such as homelessness and AIDS. ``I sort of
like to fool people's expectations.''
   Malloy said he expects Silly Putty to continue to thrive _ even
in the age of the video game.
   ``I think a parent is ecstatic when a child requests a toy that
costs a buck and a half,'' he said.
   According to Malloy, baby boomers' children have hatched a Silly
Putty sales increase of 15 percent to 17 percent during the last
four years.
   He said he expects sales to grow by 25 percent to 30 percent
this year as children collect the new blue, green, yellow and
magenta colors scheduled to reach retail stores' shelves in May.
   But Larry Carlat, editor of Toy &amp; Hobby World, said he didn't
think children would collect the different colors.
   ``Silly Putty is more of a one-trick pony,'' he said.
   At the modern plant in northeastern Pennsylvania, Binney &amp; Smith
makes an average of 300 pounds a day of Silly Putty, about 12,000
eggs a day.
   To make Silly Putty, silicone rubber is first swirled in
225-pound blobs with ingredients to keep it from puddling.
   After the pink goo _ warm from the stirring _ is poured from the
vat designed to mix mortar, it is cut up into chunks resembling
oversized loaves of homemade bread.
   These are then fed through a machine designed for cutting taffy.
Rows of Silly Putty drop onto a conveyer, and workers place the
13.3-gram disks resembling chopped hot dogs into red plastic eggs.
   Malloy said he expected the old-fashioned pink putty to continue
to sell well despite the bright colors and other innovations on the
drawing board.
   ``This isn't the last you'll see of new things in Silly Putty,''
he promised.

   The dollar rose moderately against the Japanese yen
Monday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange inched down.
   The dollar closed at 145.60 yen, up 0.65 yen from Friday's close
of 144.95 yen. After opening at 145.59 yen, it moved in a range of
145.40-145.60 yen.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's firmness carried over from
its strong showing in New York on Friday, where it closed at 145.50
yen.
   They said investors bought the currency in New York after the
release of a better-than-expected U.S. Labor Department report
which showed the nation's unemployment rate holding steady at 5.3
percent in January.
   Economists say a steady jobless rate will keep the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board, the U.S. central bank, from easing interest rates.
Higher interest rates tend to support a country's currency.
   Dealers also said uncertainty over the situation in the Soviet
Union should keep participants from taking large positions Monday
despite bullish sentiment for the West German mark.
   ``Now the market is looking to whether Soviet Leader (Mikhail)
Gorbachev's position will be consolidated'' in the meeting of the
Soviet Communist Party Central Committee scheduled for Monday and
Tuesday, a Bank of Tokyo dealer said.
   The Tokyo market has fluctuated erratically in past weeks on
rumors that Gorbachev may be resigning from his position as
secretary general of the Soviet Communist Party.
   Monday's exchange activity elsewhere is likely to be centered on
cross trading between the West German mark and the dollar as has
often been the case in recent weeks, said the dealer who, spoke
anonymously.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which gained 443.73 points Friday, fell back 18.74 points,
or 0.05 percent, to close at 37,631.41 yen.
   Securities dealers said the benchmark index opened bullish, but
uncertainty about the direction of currency rates and falling
government bond rates sidelined investors, causing large-capital
issues to lose ground.

<TEXT>
   Gun regulations have come to Oregon in the
form of a delicately balanced law that the National Rifle
Association endorses.
   The bill, which took effect Jan. 1, imposes stricter
requirements for gun ownership but gives urban-area residents
greater access to concealed handguns.
   ``I think it's a huge step for public safety. And I think it can
show other legislators they can work with the NRA,'' said House
Speaker Vera Katz, chief architect of the first major addition to
Oregon's gun laws in at least 20 years.
   Katz began work on the law after an Oregon man sprayed a
Stockton, Calif., schoolyard with bullets from a semiautomatic
rifle and two handguns in early 1989. Patrick Purdy killed five
children and wounded 30 people before fatally shooting himself.
Purdy bought the AK-47 assault rifle at a gun shop in the town of
Sandy, about 30 miles east of Portland.
   In a state where the NRA claims 62,000 members, Katz proceeded
cautiously, bringing together key lawmakers, police officials and
gun lobbyists for a series of closed-door meetings that eventually
spawned a bill.
   Banning the sale or possession of semiautomatics or any other
kind of gun never was on the agenda because of the NRA's lobbying
power, she said.
   Oregonians have a state constitutional right to bear arms for
their own defense, and the state Supreme Court has ruled residents
are entitled to possess billy clubs and switchblade knives.
   Katz said she focused instead on having enough safeguards to
keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them.
   The result, Katz said, is one of the most comprehensive gun laws
in the nation.
   For handgun purchases, the law extends the presale waiting
period from five to 15 days and requires fingerprinting. Buyers of
any gun must furnish two pieces of identification, including at
least one with a photograph.
   People prohibited from possessing guns include convicted felons
or people convicted of violent misdemeanors during the previous
four years or who have been declared by courts to be dangerous
because of mental illness.
   Purchases of rifles or shotguns carry no waiting period. But if
a background check later shows the buyer was ineligible, police are
required to confiscate the gun.
   But the law also took away much of the discretion given to
county sheriffs to deny permits for concealing weapons. Sheriffs
who once had sole discretion over such permits now are required to
issue them to applicants that meet the law's criteria and complete
a handgun safety program.
   That change was expected to spark a brisk business in those
permits in urban areas, where few had been issued.
   In one recent year, Multnomah County, the state's most populous
with 560,000 people, had issued 14 permits. Some sparsely settled
counties in eastern Oregon issued hundreds a year.
   Gun lobbyists said they support the new law.
   ``I'm still encouraged,'' said John Nichols, director of the
Oregon State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association, the state affiliate of the
NRA.
   And NRA member Tex Shively, who said he lobbied against gun
control bills during 24 Legislative sessions, is willing to give it
a chance.
   ``Too many people have guns out there,'' he said.

   A four-wheel-drive vehicle skidded on

<TEXT>
   President-elect Rafael Angel
Calderon and thousands of chanting, honking supporters celebrated
victory today as Costa Rica embarked on its second century as
Central America's most stable democracy.
   ``Today we have elected liberty and democracy to the presidency
of Costa Rica,'' said Calderon's main opponent, Carlos Manuel
Castillo, in a graceful concession statement Sunday night.
   Castillo was the governing party's candidate to succeed Nobel
laureate Oscar Arias, the architect and prime mover of Central
America's peace process. Arias was barred from running for
re-election.
   ``I feel very proud of my country tonight. This is a victory for
all of you, the people of Costa Rica,'' said Calderon at his Social
Christian party's campaign headquarters.
   The 40-year-old Calderon, who was born in Nicaragua after his
father was sent into exile, had tears of joy in his eyes as he
entered a San Jose hotel to the cheers of a flag-waving crowd.
   Calderon, a strong supporter of U.S. policy in the region, was
leading Castillo by 178,571 to 169,352, according to official
returns representing about 20 percent of Sunday's vote.
   Unofficial returns showed a much wider victory margin for
Calderon with twice as many votes counted.
   Calderon was also predicting his party would win 33 of 57
National Assembly seats. Voters also filled 525 municipal posts.
   The official count was suspended and was to resume this
afternoon.
   Castillo was breaking even in his National Liberation party
stronghold of San Jose, while Calderon was sweeping most of the
countryside. Five minor parties were not a factor in the outcome.
   Both major candidates ran populist campaigns aimed at the poor
in this country of 2.9 million people. The campaign was devoid of
specifics, however.
   Calderon made a trip to Panama shortly after the U.S. invasion
in December and supports Salvadoran president Alfredo Cristiani in
his U.S.-backed fight against leftist guerrillas.
   However, he has expressed disappointment at U.S. aid to Costa
Rica, set at about $90 million for 1990 and due to fall about 30
percent in 1991. ``Just because we are a democracy does not mean we
don't need help,'' he said.
   Costa Rica celebrated 100 years of democracy in October.
Calderon's victory marks the 10th straight peaceful election in
Costa Rica since 1948.
   Calderon founded the Social Christian party in part to shed the
legacy of his father, Rafael Angel Calderon Guardia, who was exiled
in 1948 for trying to nullify the presidential vote that year.
   Calderon, who made losing presidential bids in 1982 and 1986,
asked his followers to celebrate without gloating or rancor and
called on ``those who did not vote for me to join us and fight for
a better future for Costa Rica.''
   Thousands of voters had been celebrating a civic fiesta in the
streets throughout Sunday, and the celebration then continued for
Calderon's supporters.
   Cars with red-and-blue flags raced through the streets early
today honking to the rhythm of Calderon's name.
   Calderon said he owed his victory to party organization and the
fact that National Liberation had won the last two elections.
   ``Costa Ricans don't like one party to dominate,'' said
Calderon. He will take office May 8 for a four-year term.
   Calderon has said he supports Arias' peace efforts but won't try
to imitate them and will focus on domestic issues and ``improving
social justice.''
   Calderon has promised a new housing program for the poor, while
saying he would also reduce the government's deficit spending.
   He has also proposed requiring large companies to establish
profit-sharing plans, something that has made some businessmen
nervous.
   He inherits control of a country with a $5.5 billion debt _ more
than the annual Gross National Product of goods and services.
   But Arias, with help from President Bush, has arranged a debt
relief package and the economy is improving, although a precipitous
drop in coffee prices has hurt income from the nation's largest
export.

   ``This is tortilla money from Manuel Noriega,''
Robin Williams told Mayor David Dinkins as he presented the city
with a $227,000 check for the homeless from Comic Relief.
   ``This is from Leona Helmsley's legal fund,'' he said Sunday as
he signed over the check at St. Vincent's Medical Center.
   ``For once, a check that is not in the mail,'' Dinkins replied
Sunday
   The money comes from the $9 million that have been raised by
Comic Relief, the HBO telethon that featured Williams, Whoopi
Goldberg, Billy Crystal and other top comedians.
   Comic Relief has donated funds to help the homeless in 23
cities. It has given New York $580,000, which was administered
through St. Vincent's and the United Hospital Fund to pay for the
medical care of more than 15,000 homeless people.
   The charity's president, Bob Zmuda, said Comic Relief planned to
hold its next telethon May 12 at Radio City Music Hall. Tickets go
on sale Feb. 25.
   ``It's good to see that, hey, maybe in a little way, it's
helping,'' Zmuda said.
   HBO picks up the telethon's operating costs, so all the money
raised goes to the program, Zmuda said.

   At least two-thirds of this
U.S. territory's 38,000 residents were without water because a
power outage caused by Hurricane Ofa.
   The remaining third get their water from village catchment
systems, but some of them may have been muddied by the rains that
accompanied the weekend storm.
   Disrupted communications prevented reports from Western Samoa, a
country with 160,000 people between American Samoa and the storm

   High waves forced the evacuation of about 200 American Samoa
residents, territorial Gov. Peter T. Coleman said Sunday in
Honolulu, where he was attending a conference. They were given
temporary shelter in a school near Pago Pago.
   He said 10 to 20 people suffered cuts from flying debris, ``but
no fatalities, so we're very fortunate in that.''
   Members of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers were to arrive today
from Honolulu to assess damage.
   As of Sunday, the center of the storm, was 350 miles
east-southeast of American Samoa, moving to the southeast at 15
mph, according to the Navy in Honolulu. Winds were 120 mph, with
gusts 150 mph.
   The storm had sustained winds of 132 mph when it passed the
islands.
   Winds tore the roof off a hangar Pago Pago International Airport
and forced the airport's closure Saturday. It reopened Sunday for
daytime flights, but remained closed at night because of the power
outage, said Francesca Bozem, a Coast Guard spokeswoman in Honolulu.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Sidney Barthelemy and his defeated
challenger, Donald Mintz, called for a united effort to move the
city forward following an election decided along racial lines.
   Barthelemy, 47, who is black, overcame a strong challenge from
fellow Democrat Mintz, 46, who is white.
   Complete but unofficial returns gave Barthelemy 79,995 votes, or
55 percent, to 65,047, or 44 percent, for Mintz.
   Two other candidates split the rest of the vote.
   Pollsters said Barthelemy got about 85 percent of the black vote
and Mintz got 75 to 80 percent of the white vote in Saturday's
election.
   ``Let all New Orleanians come together _ all of us, rich and
poor, black and white ... and let us move into the 1990s and create
and build a New Orleans like no one has ever seen,'' Barthelemy
said.
   ``Together we will make New Orleans the greatest city in
America.''
   Mintz, who resigned as head of the city's dock board to make his
first try for office, said he would work to help the mayor.
   ``Because we have, perhaps, elevated campaign practices to a new
level in this city, I ask you to join with me today in pledging
support for the mayor and the new administration ... because we
believe in a better New Orleans,'' Mintz said.
   Barthelemy and Mintz said repeatedly during the campaign that
race should be irrelevant, and accused each other of exploiting it
as an issue.
   ``I think it has been a little divisive, and I'm sorry it
developed that way,'' Barthelemy said.
   Nearly 62 percent of the city's 237,000 registered voters turned
out. It was Barthelemy's sixth victory since 1974, when he won an
interim election and became the first black state Senator since
Reconstruction.
   He was elected again to the Senate and twice to the City
Council, where he was the first black ever elected as an at-large
councilman.
   Barthelemy's campaign speeches focused on ending unemployment;
Mintz said the mayor's predictions were pie-in-the-sky, and that he
could do better.
   But there was never much interest in employment or other
substantial issues, including the city's high crime rate and the
candidates' political experience and competence.
   ``The city of New Orleans has a little growing to do.... People
have to start putting race behind us,'' said U.S. Rep. Bob
Livingston, a Republican who represents Metairie. ``We have to
start looking at the credentials of the candidate. And I think if
they'd done that, Donnie would definitely be the next mayor.''
   But Moon Landrieu, the city's last white mayor, said he felt
that Barthelemy's extensive political background and Mintz' lack of
political experience were the telling factors.
   ``I don't think it's a question of color so much as who is this
person and what are his programs ... and talents or abilities?''
said Landrieu.

<TEXT>
   Voters in this tiny, remote Western Pacific
archipelago cast ballots Tuesday on whether to accept
self-government or continue as the world's last trusteeship.
   Palau's constitution mandates at least 75 percent approval must
be given to a proposed Compact of Free Association with the United
States, worth nearly $500 million in financial assistance.
   President Ngiratkel Etpison, who has spent most of the past five
weeks campaigning for the measure, believes the pact will be
ratified.
   It will be the seventh vote in as many years on the agreement
that has become U.S. law and awaits only Palau's ratification
before being put into effect. In the previous plebiscites, the
agreement has been approved ranging from 61.4 percent in the first
vote in 1983 to 73 percent in 1987.
   The U.S. Department of Interior, which administers Palau's
affairs, has indicated it will strengthen its presence here if the
pact is rejected.
   ``However, this is not to say that there will not be another act
of self-determination by Palau's people at some future date if the
plebiscite fails,'' said Sam McPhetres, who is representing the
department with a United Nations team sent here to observe voting
proceedures.
   Palau is the last of 11 territories under the U.N. trusteeship
system formed in 1947. The other territories have achieved
independence or self-government.
   An estimated 15,000 people live on eight of its 200 islands,
most in Koror, the provisional capital. The total land area is
nearly 200 square miles.
   The United States captured the volcanic islands about 500 miles
east of the Philippine island of Mindanao in 1944 from Japanese
military forces.
   Under the compact, the United States would not be able to test,
store or dispose of nuclear or other unconventional weapons in
Palau.
   However, the agreement gives the U.S. permission to use Palau's
airport, harbor and other lands for military purposes.
   Under the trusteeship, the United States is not restricted in
any of those activities.
   While there is no organized opposition in Tuesday's vote, there
are small factions who could send the compact to defeat, officials
said.
   On Sunday, 602 Palauans living on Guam voted as did 424 at
Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands. Palauans living in Hawaii,
Oregon and California also voted on Sunday.
   Yoich Kohama, Palau Election Commission chairman, said it may be
Friday before the unofficial outcome is known.

<HEAD>Leading Figure Resigns From Romania's Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading figure in the revolutionary
government has quit, suggesting discord in its highest echelons,
and criticized the leadership for campaign efforts that try to
undermine the opposition.
   Silviu Brucan, a former Communist who became the leading foreign
affairs specialist in the new regime, announced his resignation
Sunday from the National Salvation Front in a letter to the
national news agency Rompres.
   Three days earlier, the front agreed to share power with
opposition parties in a new Council of National Unity until
elections set for May 20.
   The front took control during the bloody December revolution
that toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu, who was executed
Christmas day after a summary trial.
   In making his announcement, Brucan said he considered his
mission fulfilled and that he believed all those who fought in
revolution ``share my conviction that a strong opposition is
absolutely essential to a real democracy'' in Romania.
   However, Brucan himself had been a target of opposition
criticism. It was he who announced that the front, contrary to its
initial pronouncements, would field candidates in the elections.
   Bowing to public pressure, the front last week agreed to share
power with the opposition until the elections and split into two
groups _ one to govern, the other to contest the elections.
   After his ouster, Brucan quickly became the National Salvation
Front's ideological beacon and was one its most outspoken figures.
He is a former ambassador to Washington and one-time editor of the
Communist Party daily Scinteia who first openly criticized
Ceausescu after force was used to put down labor unrest in Brasov
in 1987.
   ``Today, Feb. 4, I took the decision to retire from the
leadership of the National Salvation Front because I consider my
mission fulfilled,'' Brucan said in his letter.
   He said he was worried about several ``weak points of our new
political life,'' including a certain apathy and a focus in the
election campaign on adversaries rather than policies.
   The stress on trying to undermine the opposition rather than to
debate how best to solve Romania's many problems ``threatens to
reduce the contest to the lowest electoral traditions before World
War II,'' he said.
   In the 1930s, Romania's pre-war democracy became increasingly
autocratic, with political parties being formally banned in 1938.
   Brucan said he worried that one of the key figures helping to
form public opinion in Romania was formerly in charge of two
propaganda offices ``that were constantly promulgating Ceausescu's
cult'' and was a member of the Communist Party's now defunct
Central Committee.
   He did not identify the man.
   But Stelian Tanase, spokesman for the group for Social Dialogue,
told The Associated Press he believes Brucan resigned because of a
misunderstanding within the front.
   He said this centered on ``the rupture'' between intellectuals
who demonstrated against the front's power and the front's ruling
council, which organized a counter, pro-front demonstration a week
ago, using Communist methods such as trucking workers in from
factories.
   ``Brucan's theory is that intellectuals are a progressive force
and the anti-intellectual demonstrations were maneuvered by the
front, so these are the probable dissensions that appeared in the
council's top leadership,'' Tanase said.
   Brucan's departure follows the resignation last week of the
front's interim vice president, Dumitru Mazilu, a prominent
government critic during Ceausescu's last years although reportedly
once a colonel of the Securitate secret police. Mazilu accused the
revolutionary government of using ``Stalinistic methods.''
   Brucan, 73, offered his help to the front in the future but said
he wanted ``to get back to my writing desk and do research on
social and political issues.''
   Romanian television said the front would present its electoral
platform this week. It also said the proposed electoral law, under
debate by all parties, will be published this week.
   More than 200 people demonstrated outside the television station
Sunday, protesting what they said was biased coverage slanted
against the opposition.
   ``Has the TV been free after the revolution?'' asked Dumitru
Juga, head of a new union of 1,200 radio and television workers.
   ``No!'' the crowd shouted. Some waved placards demanding, ``Down
with censorship on TV,'' ``Down with the Ceausescu-ists from TV''
and ``Don't lie to the people with TV.''
   More than a dozen armored personnel carriers surrounded the
station, the scene of the heaviest fighting during the revolution.

<HEAD>Meditation Lengthens Lives of Elderly, Study Suggests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Elderly people who learned Transcendental
Meditation were more likely than their peers to still be living
three years later, in what experts call the first study to directly
link meditation to longer life.
   Transcendental Meditation proved more effective than two other
techniques for longevity, lowering blood pressure and improving on
several measures of mental functioning, researchers said.
   The study results are ``rather dramatic ... I think it's very
impressive,'' said psychologist Arthur Aron of the University of
California, Santa Cruz.
   Two other psychologists who study meditation said they suspect
the outcome was due to factors other than Transcendental Meditation
itself. They also suggested that other techniques might do as well
or better.
   The Harvard University study is presented in December's Journal
of Personality and Social Psychology, published by the American
Psychological Association.
   The study included 73 volunteers, with an average age of 81,
from eight homes for the elderly. They were assigned randomly to
learn Transcendental Meditation, another technique called
mindfulness training, a simple relaxation program, or no training
at all.
   Three years later, the 20 taught Transcendental Meditation were
still alive. Survival rates in the other groups were 88 percent, 65
percent and 77 percent, respectively.
   Transcendental Meditation, or TM, induces a ``a distinctively
deep state of rest'' while the mind is alert but ``in a very
settled, quiet state,'' said co-author Charles Alexander, now an
associate professor of psychology at Maharishi International
University in Fairfield, Iowa.
   Students there practice TM as part of the curriculum, Alexander
said.
   The ``mindfulness training'' in the study was not the Buddhist
technique of the same name. Instead, it was designed to stimulate
creation of ideas or new perspectives, through a verbal exercise
and a challenge to think about topics in new and creative ways.
   Each technique was practiced for 20 minutes twice daily with the
eyes closed during the 12-week experiment.
   Alexander attributed the findings to TM's combination of high
wakefulness, which he said combats atrophy of the mind and so the
body, and deep restfulness, which he said releases stress from the
nervous system and leads to reduced ``wear and tear'' on mind and
body.
   He said the study suggests TM should be combined with standard
Western medicine, not replace it.
   Some other meditation researchers suggested different
explanations for the outcome.
   For example, Michael Maliszewski, director of behavioral
medicine at the Diamond Headache Clinic in Chicago, said TM
instructors may have differed from the instructors of the other
techniques in terms of motivation or other factors that could have
given their teachings more impact. The TM group had fewer dropouts
than the other groups, he noted.
   He also said he suspected that Chinese Taoist meditative
techniques, which he said were designed to increase longevity,
might do so better than TM did. Taoism has not been studied
experimentally so far, he said.
   Alexander replied that a survey covering most dropouts found
their decision had nothing to do with the quality of the
instructors. He also said other studies have found TM superior to
alternative techniques in improving aspects of physical and mental
health, even though the commitment of the instructors of other
techniques was presumeably as high as that of the TM instructors.

   A dramatic new Holocaust memorial drew
thousands of people who came to its dedication to remember and in
some cases, bear witness.
   The memorial, dominated by a 42-foot-tall bronze hand with
sculptured, suffering figures climbing it, is for a tragedy
``beyond words and beyond imagination, but not beyond memory,''
said Elie Wiesel, the Holocaust survivor, author and professor
honored with the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize.
   ``Not to remember means to betray them all,'' he said at
Sunday's dedication. ``Not to remember means to kill the victim a
second time. Not to remember means to become an accomplice of the
enemy.''
   Nearly 3,000 chairs in an outdoor ampitheater at the memorial
were filled more than an hour before Sunday's dedication
ceremonies, and thousands more stood.
   Wiesel said not just the past, but the present, with
anti-Semitism revitalized in some countries, shows the need for
``these sanctuaries of memory.''
   The ceremonies had many in tears in this city, where thousands
of Eastern European Jews moved after World War II.
   ``I can't stop crying,'' said Miriam Feigenblat of suburban
Hallandale. She showed the number 56035 on her arm from the
Auschwitz death camp, and said she lost her parents, three sisters
and other family members. ``We are the witnesses.''
   ``It's the greatest thing to happen in Florida,'' said Jacob
Kreitzna, who survived other death camps. Pointing solemnly to his
number, he said: ``It's very important to remember.''
   Helen Fagin, a retired University of Miami professor of Judaic
studies who survived a concentration camp but lost her parents at
Treblinka, initiated the project five years ago.
   From teaching, she saw, students knew little about the
Holocaust, and she was alarmed by historical revisionists who
contended the genocidal ``Final Solution'' of Adolf Hitler never
happened.
   ``More and more survivors are leaving us,'' she said in an
interview. ``We as witnesses are going to soon disappear.''
   During trips to Washington, D.C., she was impressed by the
Vietnam Memorial and the Lincoln Memorial. A small group here, led
by automobile dealer and Philadelphia Eagles football team owner
Norman Braman, began a drive that gained donated land from the city
of Miami Beach and raised nearly $3 million for the memorial.
   Kenneth Treister, a Miami Beach resident and architect-sculptor,
traveled to Israel and studied Holocaust memorials and records
before conceiving the memorial here.
   There is a reflecting pool in the front of the ampitheater, and
a semi-circular black granite wall frames its back. A tunnel
walkway leading to the sculpture has 47 photographs showing scenes
from the Holocaust _ victims digging their own mass graves before
their executions, people being packed into railroad cars for the
camps, emaciated camp prisoners, a small boy raising his hands in
surrender to Nazi soldiers.
   The tunnel passes an eternal flame and turns, with walls
carrying the names of the death camps and listing the names of
victims.
   At the end of the tunnel, a sculptured small girl weeps and
beckons, leading to the hand, with figures climbing it, reaching
for help or for each other.
   About 5,000 names of the estimated 6 million Holocaust victims
are inscribed in the memorial, and more will be continually added
as they are received, organizers said.
   ``The Nazis tried to dehumanize them. They took away their names
and gave them numbers,'' Braman said. ``We're giving them back
their names.''

<TEXT>
   A newborn and his mother were reunited after a
bloodhound named Sherlock led police to the abductor, a woman who
was depressed over her own recent miscarriage, authorities said.
   Maria Quinones was arrested at Sunday afternoon when police saw
her walking the baby in Brooklyn, said Sgt. Nick Vreeland, a police
spokesman. Police said she kidnapped Steven Earl Pender from St.
John's Hospital on Saturday afternoon.
   The 3-day-old boy was found unharmed and returned to the
hospital, and Quinones was charged with kidnapping, authorities
said.
   ``I hugged him. I squeezed him. I'm just happy he's back,'' said
the child's mother, Cathy Pender, 18.
   Quinones was about seven months pregnant when she had a
miscarriage two weeks ago, Vreeland said.
   ``That more or less caused her to do it,'' he said.
   Police got help in looking for Quinones and the baby from the
bloodhound, who picked up her scent from the baby's clothing and a
piece of a chair that Quinones sat in at the hospital Saturday.
   Sgt. Kevin Bacon said officers went to the neighborhood where
Quinones was arrested because the dog indicated that the woman had
been there earlier.
   On Saturday afternoon, Quinones was seen talking to new mothers,
including Ms. Pender, on the eighth floor nursery of the hospital.
   She apparently was able to enter the maternity section by
convincing employees she had been discharged from the hospital and
had come to feed her son.
   Ms. Pender said she never had met Quinones until the woman
approached her in the hospital and asked her to point out her son.
   ``She came over and just started talking. She acted friendly,''
Ms. Pender said.
   ``She said, ``He's so adorable, he's so adorable,''' Ms. Pender
recalled.
   Quinones later asked nurses for Ms. Pender's son, saying she was
the child's mother, said police Sgt. Mary Wrensen.
   The nurse ``asked for some ID and she was in the course of
trying to verify who this woman was, got distracted to do something
else and when she turned around and realized, the woman was gone
with the baby,'' said hospital administrator William F. Green.
   The nurse who gave the baby to Quinones has been relieved of her
duties pending an investigation, Green said.

   Raymond Buckey promised to ``fight to my last
breath'' to prove his innocence in a retrial on child molestation
charges scheduled for next month.
   In his first extensive remarks since his acquittal on dozens of
child molestation counts, Buckey called the trial a miscarriage of
justice that destroyed his life and left children in torment.
   ``I saw what the system did. I saw how it treated children. I
saw how it treated adults. It doesn't work very well,'' Buckey said
in a Jan. 28 interview broadcast Sunday night on CBS's ``60
Minutes.''
   ``It's a very safe side to be on, saying, `Gee, these poor
children went through hell,''' he said. ``And they did go through
hell, but I'm not the cause of their hell, neither is my mother.
Nothing that happened at that preschool is the cause of their hell.
The cause of their hell is the product of the adults who took on
this case and made it what it is.''
   On Jan. 18, a Superior Court jury acquitted Buckey, 31, and his
mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, of 52 molestation counts
stemming from alleged attacks on pupils at their now-closed
McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach. Jurors deadlocked on 13
other counts against Buckey.
   Last week, after a vociferous campaign by McMartin parents that
included television talk show appearances, Los Angeles County
District Attorney Ira Reiner decided to retry Buckey on the 13
counts.
   ``I don't want to go through another McMartin trial,'' Buckey
said, ``but I will because I know I'm innocent. I'll fight to my
last breath to get vindicated in the system in some way, because
there's no end to what they've done to me.''
   The trial was the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in
U.S. history. Buckey spent five years in jail and his mother nearly
two before they were released on bail.
   On the CBS-TV program, Reiner was asked if, in retrospect, he
felt Buckey and his mother should have been jailed for as long as
they were.
   ``In retrospect? Who can tell in retrospect?'' Reiner replied.
   Mrs. Buckey, who also was interviewed, said she expected the
jurors to acquit her, but Buckey said he was unsure.
   ``I couldn't believe that they'd buy this whole case, but I knew
they were looking for something,'' he said. ``And I just hoped to
God that there weren't 12 people who were blind enough to buy this
witch hunt.''
   Jurors told reporters after the verdict that they felt some
children had been molested, but that there was insufficient
evidence that Buckey was the attacker.
   ``God knows all of us are innocent, and I can't convince other
people, but God knows it,'' Mrs. Buckey said.

   Soviet cosmonauts left the Mir orbital station on
Monday for high-flying acrobatics on a space motorcycle designed to
rescue spacemen in distress and repair satellites.
   Cosmonauts Alexander Viktorenko and Alexander Serebrov, who have
been aboard the Mir complex for nearly five months, emerged from
Mir for a second test of the motorcycle, officially known as the
Cosmonaut Movement System, the official news agency Tass said.
   The space motorcycle, which more closely resembles a floating
armchair, was ridden for the first time Thursday by Serebrov, the
mission's flight engineer, who piloted the device about 100 feet
from the giant Mir space station.
   During Thursday's test, the cycle was tethered to Mir. Official
media did not say if the tether was in place today and television
pictures were not detailed enough to determine.
   Today's test was carried out by Viktorenko, who was scheduled to
put the motorcycle through a series of pirouettes to test the
craft's maneuverability and technical performance, Radio Moscow
said.
   The testing of the space motorcycle was the fifth time the two
comsonauts have left the spaceship to work in open space since they
boarded Mir in September.
   Viktorenko and Serebrov are scheduled to be replaced later this
month by another crew.

<HEAD>Home Affordability Gap Still Growing, Study Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home buyers last year waited longer to buy their
dream house because prices rose faster than their incomes, the 14th
straight year the gap has widened, a study found.
   The Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co. said its annual survey of home
buyers in 18 urban areas showed that the majority of 1989 home
buyers were two-income couples who saved for an average of 2.9
years _ the longest period in the survey's 14-year history _ before
having enough money for a down payment.
   The study ``documents that working couples have been the major
factor influencing home affordability in this decade,'' said John
Pfister, Chicago Title vice president in charge of marketing
research.
   The study, the only national home buyers survey embracing all
types of home sales throughout the year, was based on telephone
interviews of more than 1,500 people, according to Chicago Title,
the country's largest title-insurance company.
   Nationally, the median home price _ which historically reflects
a price that most closely parallels what most people would pay _
rose 6.4 percent last year to $129,800, while the median household
income of 1989 home buyers rose 6.3 percent to $58,700, the survey
found.
   The median home price is the midpoint with an equal number of
homes selling for more and less.
   The gap was smaller than in recent years, but when considered
with the gaps since the first Chicago Trust survey in 1976, the
difference between income gains and home-price increases grew a
total of 6.5 percent over 14 years.
   ``Those buying houses today have noticeably fewer discretionary
dollars to spend on things other than housing than their
counterparts did 13 years ago,'' Pfister said.
   Chicago Title said 79.3 percent of all 1989 home buyers were
two-income families compared with 73.3 percent in 1988 and 53.1
percent in 1976.
   Among first-time home buyers, 86.8 percent were two-income
families, compared with 85.5 percent in 1988 and 64 percent in 1976.
   The segment of first-time home buyers purchasing newly
constructed homes dropped to 17 percent from 23 percent in 1988,
while the number buying existing single-family homes rose to 83
percent from 77 percent.
   ``What this tends to suggest is that the first-time buyers, in
general, were increasingly priced out of the new home market last
year and opted for older, less expensive houses instead,'' Pfister
said.
   San Francisco remained the most expensive metropolitan housing
market in 1989, the survey found, with a median home price of
$199,900, up 11.2 percent from 1988.
   At the low end, the median home price in Cleveland last year was
$75,800, down 1.3 percent from 1988.
   The median home price in Memphis jumped 18.1 percent last year
to $92,000, while the median price of a home in New York City fell
13.7 percent to $166,200.

   Secret Service agents and police removed
several demonstrators who tried to block a limousine waiting for El
Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani outside a Harvard University
gym.
   About 20 demonstrators, some chanting, ``Cristiani you can't
hide, we charge you with genocide,'' were sitting in front of the
limousine Sunday afternoon when authorities picked them up and
moved them to the sidewalk, the student newspaper Harvard Crimson
reported today.
   It was not known if Cristiani, who had come to watch his son
play squash, was in the limousine during the demonstration, the
newspaper said.
   No arrests were made and no one appeared to have been injured in
the brief scuffle.
   Cristiani's son, Alex, plays for the Princeton squash team.
Harvard won the match 5-4.
   The El Salvadoran president told a Crimson reporter inside the
gym that the demonstration was ``normal. It's a free country.
They're allowed to do that.''
   He said he was in the United States to visit the United Nations.
   Peter Costa, a spokesman for Harvard, said Cristiani was in town
for ``a private, family visit,'' and was not on official business
with the university.
   About 60 demonstrators opposed to El Salvadoran military
policies gathered outside the gym early Sunday afternoon to protest
Cristiani's presence.

<HEAD>Radical Student Gets 10 Years For Visiting North Korea</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman college student nicknamed
``the flower of unification'' was convicted and sentenced to 10
years in prison today for illegally visiting communist North Korea.
   Im Su-kyong, 21, is the first South Korean student to be
sentenced for going to the north.
   As the sentence was handed down, Ms. Im and a Roman Catholic
priest on trial with her, stood in prison garb and shouted ``Wake
up judges who ignore unification!''
   Some 30 radical students and Catholic priests in the gallery at
the Seoul District Criminal Court yelled ``Release them!'' and the
courtroom proceedings were temporarily halted until order was
restored.
   The Rev. Moon Gyu-hyon, 41, who accompanied the 21-year-old Ms.
Im across the border on Aug. 15 was given eight years in prison. He
said he went to the north to accompany her home because she was
Catholic and needed support.
   Attorneys for the defendants said they would appeal.
   On hearing news of the verdict, students at two Seoul
universities held rallies demanding Ms. Im's release. ``Release Im
_ Flower of Unification'' shouted students at Sogang University.
   Presiding Judge Hwang Sang-hyun found the pair guilty of making
an illegal visit to the communist north, of acting under
instruction from North Korea, of contacting, communicating and
rendering voluntary support to the enemy north and of benefitting
the north militarily.
   He said that when the two returned to the south they were under
instruction from North Korea to continue their anti-U.S.,
anti-government struggle.
   Ms. Im and Moon said their trips to the north last summer were
in support of unification of the peninsula, divided into the
communist north and capitalist south in 1945.
   The Seoul government forbids unauthorized trips to North Korea
as a violation of national security laws and maintains dialogue on
unification must be conducted through official channels.
   In October, a dissident clergyman was sentenced to 10 years in
prison for visiting North Korean leaders to discuss unification.
   Ms. Im said her trip to a July 1-8 international youth festival
in Pyongyang had the support of radical students and dissidents
demanding unification. She appeared on North Korean television,
gave interviews and was treated as a heroine by North Korean
officials.
   In the south, radicals nicknamed her ``flower of unification.''
After her arrest, they staged violent protests demanding her
release. Radical protests have dwindled in recent months due to
lack of support.
   The trial was marred by frequent outbursts, with members of the
gallery throwing paper airplanes and paper flowers at the judge.
   Radicals, dissidents and North Korea demand the ouster of 43,000
U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, claiming their presence
hinders dialogue on unification. The Seoul government says the
North wants to communize and unify the peninsula by force.

<HEAD>Bush Budget Proposal Won't Solve Veterans' Problems, Groups Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veterans' organizations today said the
proposed 1991 budget for veterans' programs should be boosted by
$1.1 billion, adding the current plan will not solve such basic
problems as delays in handling benefit claims.
   The proposal by AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed
Veterans of America and the Veterans of Foreign Wars said the
Veterans' Administration needs $1.1 billion more than the $30.9
billion sought by the Bush administration.
   ``There are no grandiose concepts in this independent budget,''
said Frank Morrone, a health policy consultant to the paralyzed
veterans' group. Combined, the groups claim to represent 3 million
of the nation's 27 million veterans.
   The groups want a shift in some spending priorities within the
VA, including the addition of $1.2 billion for medical care over
the Bush administration's request for $12.2 billion. Though the
highest administration request in years, the Bush proposal for
health care just meets ``the bare minimum,'' said Morrone.
   ``VA is not getting its fair share of federal dollars in terms
of health care,'' said Morrone, citing 4 percent growth in
veterans' health spending between 1985 and 1989, compared with
nearly 7 percent for Medicare and 11 percent for Medicaid. Research
dollars are decreasing, he said.
   Another chief concern of the groups was the handling of claims.
   According to the groups, the underfunding of the veterans'
benefits administration has caused a 650,000-case backlog in
compensation and pension claims. The backlog was at 167,000 cases
as recently as 1987, they said.
   As a result of underfunding, veterans wait six months for
benefits, applicants for vocational rehabilitation wait 100 days to
be interviewed, almost 2 million veterans a year can't get through
to the VA because of busy lines and long waits on hold, and home
loans are being defaulted on unnecessarily, they say.
   The groups say 734 additional employees are needed at a cost of
$25 million for general operating expenses, the category that
covers benefits work.
   The four veterans' groups, like other critics of the VA budget,
blame short staffing in the loan program for a large number of
defaults that is leading the administration to propose eliminating
a centerpiece housing benefit.
   For the first time, the Bush administration proposed last week a
mandatory 4 percent down payment on VA loan amounts over $25,000.
   The veterans' groups, offering their fourth ``independent
budget,'' say they are motivated by a ``final loss of confidence in
the Office of Management and Budget's intention or ability to
objectively address veterans' issues.''

<HEAD>Writers Applaud Rushdie's Defense, But Moslems are Unpersuaded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author Salman Rushdie's detailed defense of ``The
Satanic Verses'' is winning plaudits from fellow writers but has
failed to placate British Moslems who say the novel is blasphemous.
   Several writers said Rushdie's 7,000-word essay was a brilliant
defense of free speech. But Moslems said it would not break the
deadlock over the novel, and one reiterated that the death sentence
passed on Rushdie by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini remained
in force.
   Rushdie's essay, published in The Independent on Sunday, was his
first detailed comment on the furor aroused by ``The Satanic
Verses'' since Khomeini's edict forced him into hiding a year ago.
   Rushdie, 42, wrote of the pain of being cut off from society;
the irony of being condemned by Moslems for a novel that sought to
highlight their plight as immigrants in the West; and the anger he
feels that the Labor Party, which he has always supported, failed
to back him.
   The Bombay-born Briton said his novel sought to create a
literary language for ``formerly colonized, still-disadvantaged
peoples,'' those like himself who straddle different cultures _ ``a
love-song to our mongrel selves.''
   ``To be rejected and reviled by, so to speak, one's own
characters is a shocking and painful experience for any writer,''
he wrote.
   ``I recognize that many Moslems have felt shocked and pained
too. Perhaps a way forward might be found through the mutual
recognition of that mutual pain. Let us attempt to believe in each
other's good faith.''
   Shabbir Akhtar, a British Moslem, welcomed Rushdie's decision to
publish the essay, calling it ``thoughtful and unexpected.'' But he
said the novel remained a ``calculated attempt to vilify and
slander (the Prophet) Mohammed.''
   Akhtar is a member of the mosque council in Bradford, the
heavily Moslem-populated city in northern England where
anti-Rushdie sentiment runs high.
   Writing today in The Independent, sister of the paper that
published Rushdie's essay, Akhtar urged Rushdie to ``engage in a
dialogue'' with those he has offended. He said Islam was a merciful
religion, and ``the magnanimity which has been denied to both
parties may yet seek an occasion.''
   But he regretted Rushdie's insistence that a paperback edition
be published, saying it would ``fuel extremism in the Moslem camp.
There may even be acts of political terrorism. It will be seen as a
further provocation...''
   Rushdie's publisher, Viking Penguin, says ``no firm date'' has
been set for issuing a paperback.
   Liaqat Hussain, general secretary of the Council of Mosques in
Bradford, urged Rushdie to ``be brave enough to face the world for
his principles.''
   Another British Moslem leader, Sayed Abdul Quddus, said: ``The
death sentence still stands on Salman Rushdie. It has been passed
by Islamic law.''
   Novelist Penelope Lively, one of several writers who praised
Rushdie's essay, called it ``dignified and moving. I think, sadly,
it points up the basic confrontation; here is a novelist trying to
explain his purpose to fundamentalists who cannot, or will not,
understand what fiction is or does.''
   Writer Michael Ignatieff said the essay would be regarded as
``one of the great classical defenses of the novelist's art in this
country.''
   In his essay, Rushdie says the sequences most objected to by his
Moslem critics are actually attempts to express the pain of people
when their faith is stretched to breaking point _ ``to portray a
soul in crisis, to show how the loss of God can destroy a man's
life.''
   But he says the passage involving Mohammed with three pagan,
female deities _ an episode that particularly incensed Moslems _
was designed in part to ask ``awkward questions'' about Islam's
attitude to women.
   In introducing a character named Mahound, a medieval European
term of abuse for Mohammed, Rushdie said he was turning an insult
into a term of ethnic pride; ``The purpose is not to suggest that
the Koran (the Moslem holy book) is written by the devil; it is to
attempt the sort of act of affirmation that, in the United States,
transformed the word Black from the standard term of racist abuse
into a `beautiful' expression of cultural pride.''
   To Moslems who accuse him of turning against the faith into
which he was born, he replied: ``To put it as simply as possible: I
am not a Moslem. It feels bizarre, and wholly inappropriate, to be
described as some sort of heretic after having lived my life as a
secular, pluralist, eclectic man.''
   Responding to those who claim he deliberately set out to provoke
Moslems, he likened himself to rape victims who are accused of
having ``asked for it.''
   In a separate interview with the Independent on Sunday, Rushdie
said he has been reading Moby Dick, Ulysses, Tristram Shandy and
great free-speech defenders like Rousseau, Diderot and Voltaire,
and watching TV soap operas.
   He added: ``Having had a lot of late nights by myself I've also
become an addict of American football'' _ one of the newer features
of British television.

   Ron Kovic, the disabled Vietnam veteran
whose story is portrayed in the hit movie ``Born on the Fourth of
July,'' has not declared his candidacy, but Rep. Robert K. Dornan
is taking no chances.
   The Republican congressman already is on the offensive against
Kovic in mailings that portray the veteran as a draft card-burning
ultraliberal.
   Dornan sent out 20,000 fund-raising letters that reproduce an
old newspaper photograph apparently showing Kovic burning a draft
card.
   The letters, received Saturday by contributors, called Kovic the
favorite of the ``ultra-liberal ... Hollywood left.''
   Kovic, whose transformation from patriotic Marine to war
opponent is recounted in the movie, said Sunday he would announce
later this month whether he will run as a Democrat in Dornan's 38th
Congressional District.
   He called Dornan's letter a ``hatred campaign,'' and a
desperation move that will backfire.
   ``It's the false patriots who always attack the real heroes,''
said Kovic, who received the Purple Heart and is paralyzed from the
chest down from a combat wound.
   While not stating he would run against Dornan, Kovic said his
``time of dedicated service to my country has come again,'' and
that he was confident of victory if he does run.
   Dornan's letter asks for immediate campaign contributions of
$100 or $150 and mentions the less savory aspects of Kovic's life,
as recounted in the motion picture.
   ``The movie shows Kovic in a panic and mistakenly shooting his
corporal to death in Vietnam, visiting prostitutes, abusing drugs
and alcohol and cruelly insulting his parents,'' a postscript said.
``And this is a person the liberals want in the U.S. Congress. No
way.''
   The letter said Kovic is ``fast becoming one of the liberals'
best hopes for 1990. And he will have access to hundreds of
thousands of dollars from the Hollywood left and liberals across
the country.''
   Kovic has said Tom Cruise, who played him in the film, will walk
precincts if Kovic decides to run.
   ``I can't waste any time in case this guy is serious,'' Dornan
said Saturday. ``He's threatening to bring Tom Cruise and Jane
Fonda and (Pentagon papers defendant) Daniel Ellsberg to town. If
he's going to bring in these big guns, I've got to start building
up my war chest.''

   For a 9-year-old English boy who is terminally ill
with cancer, the looming silver-blue pickup truck with 5-foot
wheels was a dream come true.
   ``There it is, Mom,'' cried Ray Joseph ``R.J.'' Bush, of West
Croydon Surrey, England, as he pointed toward ``Big Foot,'' a
customized truck. ``There it is.''
   Seeing his mechanized hero for the first time was a dream come
true for R.J., who suffers from rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare and fatal
cancer which afflicts muscle fibers in children.
   With the aid of several British actors who perform in a BBC
sitcom, R.J's parents, Ray and Josephine Bush, raised about $8,150
for a trip to Denver to see Bigfoot in the Coors Extra Gold Motor
Spectacular Sunday at the Denver Coliseum.
   The Bushes arrived Saturday and were to return to England Monday.
   ``About 12 weeks ago, they said R.J. had a month or so to
live,'' said his 42-year-old father, who quit his job in a florist
shop to help care for the boy. ``Getting him here, being able to
see Bigfoot, has helped keep him going.''
   R.J., who was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma about 16 months
ago, has been a devoted fan of the modified Ford pickup since he
first saw it on cable television several years ago.
   The youth's eyes grew even wider as he sat next to Bigfoot and
received a few souvenirs from driver Ron Bachmann.
   ``How ya doin,' buddy?'' said Bachmann, who handed over a
Bigfoot poster, a license plate, balloons and a miniature satin
jacket with an embroidered Bigfoot patch.
   ``It's a little bewildering for him,'' said his mother as R.J.,
who is quiet and shy, reacted with tears to the Earth-shaking
rumbling of engines throughout the Coliseum. ``I don't think he
even believes that we were ever going to bring him here for this.''

   Eddie Murphy and his assistants ran up $5
million in expenses during the making of the movie ``Coming to
America,'' which has made no profit despite $350 million in ticket
sales, according to studio records.
   Last month, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Art Buchwald and
producer Alain Bernheim won a lawsuit against Paramount Pictures in
which they said the studio took the concept for the 1988 movie from
an idea by Buchwald. Paramount was ordered to pay Buchwald and
Bernheim 19 percent of the movie's net profits.
   A financial audit is scheduled during a forthcoming phase of the
trial to determine how much money Buchwald and Bernheim should
receive.
   The financial documents released to the Los Angeles Times by
court order Saturday were sealed during the trial at Paramount's
request, but studio officials had testified that the movie was
still in the red.
   The amount of money Paramount absorbed during the making of the
movie could become an issue in the accounting phase of the suit.
   According to the documents, weekly charges to production made on
Murphy's behalf included: $4,920 for a limousine and driver kept on
call around the clock, $2,200 for a special motor home for Murphy,
$1,592 to the motor home's driver, $1,500 for a personal trainer
and $650 for a valet.
   None of those expenses came out of Murphy's $8 million salary,
his 15 percent share of the film's gross receipts, his own travel
and hotel expenses or his $5,000-a-week living allowance, according
to the documents.

<HEAD>Tutu: Havard Should Divest Until South African Changes Are Made</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is a member
of Harvard University's governing board, urged the school to
withdraw its money from South Africa until promised changes are
made there.
   Tutu told reporters Sunday that he had asked the 30-member Board
of Overseers to sell off $139 million in investments in companies
that do business in South Africa. The money could be reinvested
once it becomes clear that reforms promised by President F.W. de
Klerk will take place, Tutu said.
   The Board of Overseers, to which the Anglican archbishop was
elected last June, had met earlier in the day in a closed session.
The board planned to further consider the divestment issue at a
later meeting.
   Last week, de Klerk said he would release jailed African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela and lift government bans on
30 outlawed opposition groups.
   Tutu, who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid
efforts, praised de Klerk for his announcement, but said actual
advancements would be decided by the South African Parliament.
   ``We'd like to see these things immediately, but let's be
realistic. The parliamentary session has just begun,'' he said.
``If (de Klerk) is playing games, they would be very odd games and
the world would know how to act.''
   When asked why he was in Massachusetts rather than in South
Africa at such a critical time, Tutu said, ``Harvard is Harvard.
The things that Harvard does and does not do have an impact far
beyond what you would expect from an educational institution.''
   Tutu ran for the Harvard board on an anti-apartheid slate and
was elected last June, along with Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole
and actor John Lithgow.

<TEXT>
   Two masked men ambushed a busload of Israeli
tourists on an isolated desert road and opened fire with machine
guns and hand grenades, killing at least nine Israelis and wounding
20, officials said.
   An Egyptian tour guide also was wounded in Sunday's attack.
   The bus was carrying 31 Israelis, the guide and an Egyptian
driver to Cairo from Rafeh, a divided town on the Egypt-Israel
border in the Sinai Peninsula. It was attacked near the Suez Canal
town of Ismailiya, 40 miles from the capital, the Egyptian
government said.
   Two men in a white Peugeot station wagon stopped the bus, got
out of the car and opened fire with machine guns, said the
government statement. It said they hurled four hand grenades, two
of which exploded.
   ``The vehicle became like hell at once, there were shots from
every direction, grenades were thrown inside the bus and everything
was covered with smoke,'' said Dr. Yigal Barak, a survivor who
spoke on army radio in a telephone interview from an Ismailiya
hospital.
   Barak, who was not injured, said the attack lasted several
minutes as many passengers lay flat on the floor. He said he could
not see the attackers but could hear they fired both from outside
and from the open doors of the bus.
   ``There was a terrible fear and the feeling of helplessness,''
said Barak. ``Nobody could protect us, nobody carried any weapons.''
   It was the worst attack on Israelis in Egypt since 1985 and the
deadliest single act of terror in Egypt since Moslem extremists
killed President Anwar Sadat and seven others with him on a parade
viewing stand on Oct. 6, 1981.
   The gunmen spoke Arabic with non-Egyptian accents, the Egyptian
government statement said, suggesting they were either Palestinian
or from other Arab countries.
   An unidentified man telephoned the Cairo bureau of a Western
news agency and said the attack was in retaliation for alleged
torture in Egyptian prisons. The caller claimed responsibility on
behalf of the Organization for the Defense of Oppressed in Egyptian
Prisons, a previously unknown group.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel, speaking in a telephone
interview with Israel TV, said it ``proves that hostility towards
Israel still exists and runs amok in the region.''
   President Hosni Mubarak telephoned Shamir and issued a statement
calling the attack ``monstrous.'' He said it was aimed at thwarting
efforts for Middle East peace, said the government-run Middle East
News Agency.
   A witness, Miriam Kadmon, was quoted by Israel army radio as
saying the car's driver signaled the bus to stop and the attackers
then opened fire. An Egyptian, screaming, jumped out of the vehicle
and was shot to death, she said.
   Rivka Betzer, another survivor, said that during the attack the
gunmen told Egyptian hitchikers aboard the bus to get off and that
one or two Israelis apparently got off with them and escaped.
   Israeli Embassy spokeswoman Doreet Shavit said today that nine
Israelis were killed and 20 Israelis wounded. Egyptian officials
said the Egyptian tour guide was hurt but the driver was not.
   Israeli officials in Jerusalem said earlier that a 10th Israeli
died of wounds on a flight back to Israel, but a military official
later corrected that report, saying no one died in flight.
   It was unclear if the witness who claimed an Egyptian ran off
the bus and was killed was referring to a hitchhiker or if she was
in error. Egyptian officials did not mention any deaths among
hitchhikers.
   Ms. Shavit said Israel sent three medical teams to Cairo aboard
a C-130 transport. Three of the wounded flew home overnight, and
the others were being flown back today.
   MENA quoted an unidentified senior security official as saying
police found the Peugeot station wagon on Cairo's northern
outskirts early today. He said some bullet casings were found
inside the vehicle, which is owned by an Egyptian who rents it to
tourist agencies.
   The official said authorities had found clues as to the identity
of the attackers, but did not elaborate.
   Authorities tightened security in Cairo's southern suburb of
Maadi, where many Israeli diplomats live. Police threw up
barricades and checked cars in the suburb, where Egyptian gunmen
attacked Israeli diplomats in 1984 and 1985.
   The bus belonged to an Egyptian tourist company called Santa
Maria Tours.
   The tour was organized by Ofakim, an Israeli tourist company.
Albert Levy, an Ofakim manager, said the Israelis had begun an
eight-day tour of Egypt. He said 12 members of the group lives in
Mevasseret-Ziyyon, a Jerusalem suburb.
   Mubarak telephoned Shamir to express condolences to families of
the victims. Mubarak ``stressed that nothing should ever obstruct
the peace process but (this incident) should be an incentive for
going ahead ... to reach a final settlement of the Arab-Israeli
conflict,'' MENA said.
   Egypt, the only Arab country to have peace with Israel, has been
mediating efforts to get talks started between Israeli officials
and representatives of Palestinians who have waged a 2-year-old
uprising against Israeli rule of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman George Malleck said
the attack represented an ``attempt by the enemies of peace to halt
efforts at reconciliation and dialogue.''
   Egypt and Israel signed a U.S.-mediated peace treaty in 1979.

   Israeli leaders said today an attack on a
busload of Israeli tourists in Egypt was designed to harm Israel's
peaceful relations with the Arab country and ruin chances for peace
talks with the Palestinians.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said, ``There is no doubt that
those who carried it out planned it in advance in order to harm the
Israelis, harm Israel's ties with Egypt and maybe harm the chances
of achieving peace in the region.''
   Some officials said Sunday's attack, which claimed nine lives,
seemed timed to coincide with a sensitive moment in Middle East
peace efforts.
   It came two days before a crucial meeting was scheduled by Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc, at which Shamir
was expected to defend his Middle East peace plan against assaults
by influential party hawks.
   Shamir's plan calls for Palestinian elections in the occupied
territories as a first step toward peace. The hawks say the plan,
which has been approved by Israel's coalition government, could
lead to a Palestinian state.
   After the bus attack, Trade Minister Ariel Sharon, Shamir's
chief opponent, announced on Israel army radio that the Likud
session would be delayed to an unspecified date.
   Shamir said today before the postponement ``it is clear we don't
think now about internal struggle and about settling accounts.''
   If Shamir manages to overcome his party's hawks, the next step
would be a Washington meeting urged by U.S. Secretary of State
James A. Baker III with Israel's and Egypt's foreign ministers to
set the stage for the first Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.
   But the emotional climate surrounding the bus attack could
strengthen the hand of Likud's hard-liners. The hawks, who fear
Shamir's plan could give the PLO a role in negotiations, blamed
Egypt's links with the group for the attack.
   ``We should not accept any expressions of sorrow any more. The
Egyptians have to prove they are disassociated only by one way _ a
total rejection of the PLO,'' Yehoshua Matza, a Likud legislator,
said on Israel army radio Sunday.
   Sharon said: ``There are those who believe that Egypt is an
important contributor to peace, but I say that Egypt does not
contribute to peace.... The positions of Egypt and the PLO are
one.''
   Ehud Olmert, Likud's Cabinet minister in charge of Arab affairs,
said that ``diplomatic links with Egypt are important'' but
suggested Israelis should stop visiting Egypt.
   Last year, about 90,000 Israelis visited Egypt, according to
Israeli reports. In 1986, Israeli tourism to Egypt came to a
virtual halt for a year following the Oct. 6, 1985 attack in which
an Egyptian policeman shot and killed seven Israeli tourists in the
Sinai peninsula.
   Other Likud officials, including some of Shamir's supporters,
were more cautious about blaming Egypt, the only Arab country that
has made peace with Israel.
   ``I hope it would not influence the relations between Israel and
Egypt,'' Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said.
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres of the left-of-center Labor Party,
Shamir's rival and coalition partner, said Israel should pursue its
peace plan regardless of the attack.
   ``It's clear to me that those who fired wanted to hurt that
process,'' Peres said. ``Of course, such an attack does not help
the peace process, but it should not be stopped by several mad
terrorists.''
   The leftist Peace Now group issued a statement calling on Jews
and Arabs to ``act together to stop a crazy minority ready to spill
blood in order to stop the peace process.''
   Faisal Husseni, a leading pro-PLO activist, condemned the
attack. He told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that
such violence ``comes from groups who are fed by the stubbon
Israeli position'' in the peace process.

   An unusual study of presidents' children
concludes that having a father in the White House brings ``more
problems than opportunity.''
   ``Almost any enterprise is criticized,'' says the report on
``All the Presidents' Children'' commissioned by George Bush's
eldest son, George W. Bush, while his father was still
president-elect.
   Douglas Wead reviewed the lives of presidential offspring from
John Adams to Ronald Reagan and concluded that history ``should be
a sobering warning to any new arrivals'' at the White House.
   ``Being related to a president may bring more problems than
opportunity,'' Wead cautioned in his 44-page treatise, excerpts
from which appear in the latest issue of U.S. News &amp; World Report.
   ``If (an enterprise is) successful, it's assumed that it is
because of the relationship. If not, the public assumes the son or
daughter is lazy or incompetent,'' Wead reported.
   Wead ``found a consistent pattern of trouble for the sons and
daughters of presidents,'' the magazine reported.
   ``There were higher-than-average rates of divorce, alcoholism
and accidental death; a wide variety of scandals over real or
perceived conflicts of interest, and constant frustration over lack
of independence.''
   Some presidential offspring became prominent in their own right:
John Quincy Adams became president himself, and Theodore
Roosevelt's four sons were war heroes.
   Others met tragedy during their father's term: Calvin Coolidge
Jr. died of blood poisoning after a freak accident on the White
House tennis court; Abraham Lincoln's son, Willie, died of
pneumonia in his father's arms.
   The magazine ran the excerpts as part of a story looking at how
the five Bush children are faring under the spotlight.
   George Walker Bush, 43, last year became a part owner and
managing partner of the Texas Rangers baseball team. He also ruled
out a race for governor of Texas.
   Another son, Neil, 35, a Denver oil executive, is currently
under investigation by federal bank regulators as a former member
of the board of directors of a major bank that collapsed, Silverado
Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Association. The Silverado bailout is
expected to cost taxpayers $1 billion.
   The magazine reports that when Neil called his father recently
to say he wanted to fight the Silverado charges rather than accept
a negotiated settlement, the president told him, ``Don't worry
about me. Don't worry about the presidency. Do what's best for Neil
Bush.''
   Daughter Dorothy LeBlond, 30, a tourism official for the state
of Maine, recently filed for divorce from her husband of seven
years.
   Jeb Bush, 36, is a Miami real estate developer active in state
GOP politics. Marvin, 33, is a business entrepreneur who lives just
across the Potomac in Alexandria, Va.
   Marvin, who had part of his colon removed in 1986, has been a
prominent supporter of the National Foundation for Ileitis and
Colitis.
   Wead spelled out some of the pitfalls of White House kinship for
the Bush children.
   ``Try something great and (you) appear grandiose and
presumptuous. Try to lead a quiet, normal life and (you) appear
lazy or unambitious. Try something artistic and (you will) offend
those who believe in `causes,''' Wead said.
   ``The presidential child in business faces the pressure of
enormous scrutiny. Two things the media and the public won't allow?
Success or failure. Keep the business mediocre, maintain a personal
low profile and you will be left alone,'' said Wead, a White House
liaison to conservative groups.

   The government remains committed
to segregated neighborhoods and public schools despite President
F.W. de Klerk's announcement of major political reforms, two
Cabinet ministers said today.
   ``Black people should be running their own education and white
people should be running their own education,'' said Stoffel van
der Merwe, the white official who oversees education for blacks.
   Otherwise, he said, there will be ``tremendous chaos.''
   Herman Kriel, minister of planning and provincial affairs, said
the government has no plans to repeal the Group Areas Act, which
mandates racial segregation of residential areas.
   ``We cannot allow the minorities that live here to be swamped by
majority decisions,'' he said. ``We believe community life is a
right.''
   The two ministers spoke at briefings for journalists covering
the start of Parliament. On Friday, in a historic speech opening
the session, de Klerk lifted bans on the African National Congress
and other militant opposition groups, declared a moratorium on
executions, eased restrictions on the media, and pledged to free
ANC leader Nelson Mandela soon.
   De Klerk said his intention was to draw black leaders into
negotiations on a constitution that would extend political rights
to the black majority. He said Sunday the government would
implement major constitutional changes only after white voters were
allowed to convey their views.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, visited her husband Sunday and said
later that the white-led government still must be pressured into
further reforms before Mandela can go free.
   She said those conditions include lifting the 3{-year-old state
of emergency, and she appealed for renewed pressure on authorities
to lift it.
   ``Unfortunately, the obstacles that were in the way, which
prevented his release on Friday, still exist,'' Mrs. Mandela said
after the four-hour visit at the Victor Verster prison farm.
   ``It ... doesn't depend on him when he will be released,'' she
said. But in answer to repeated questions about the obstacles, she
said Mandela still demands the complete lifting of the state of
emergency.
   Dullah Omar, an anti-apartheid lawyer who accompanied Mrs.
Mandela, said Mandela also demands that the government free all
jailed members of his African National Congress, including those
convicted of violent acts. De Klerk offered to free prisoners
convicted of belonging to the ANC, but not those convicted of
terrorism or murder.
   Under the emergency regulations that remain in effect, the
government can detain anyone for up to six months without charge.
Police have wide powers to ban meetings or speeches and restrict
televison or photo coverage of their own actions in dealing with
unrest.
   Van der Merwe said today that the government was ready to open
negotiations promptly and contended that some anti-apartheid groups
were looking for excuses not to talk.
   The ANC has said it will enter negotiations only if Mandela and
other political prisoners were freed, the state of emergency was
lifted, outlawed opposition groups were legalized, executions were
halted, and troops were removed from black townships.
   To a large extent, these conditions have now been met. De Klerk
has expressed a desire to meet the remaining conditions soon.
   De Klerk issued a statement through government-run radio Sunday
night responding to comments from ANC officials that the guerrilla
campaign would continue. If that happened, de Klerk was quoted as
saying, ``The world would turn against them.''
   Mandela, 71, was jailed in 1962 and is serving a life sentence
for helping to plan the start of the ANC's sabotage and bombing
campaign against the government.
   Mrs. Mandela said her husband was preparing a reaction to de
Klerk's speech, but she didn't know when it would be made public
because ``he remains a prisoner.''
   On her return to Johannesburg, she said the document being
prepared by her husband would indicate the circumstances under
which he would be released and would indicate when his release is
expected.
   De Klerk has said people imprisoned only for membership in
outlawed organizations or non-violent support of such groups, would
be freed. Those convicted of violent crimes, including
participation in the ANC's bombing campaign that killed 40 people
and injured 680 over the past three years, would not be freed.
   In Pretoria Sunday, assailants shot out windows at the British
Embassy. A day earlier, right-wing graffiti was spray-painted on
the building. No one was injured and no one claimed responsibility
for the incidents, which may have been in retaliation for Britain's
endorsement of de Klerk's reforms.

   A woman feeding cattle in a pasture 100
yards from her home found a plane that had crashed four days
earlier. All four people aboard were dead, including two teen-age
children of a congressional candidate.
   The pilot and a newspaper publisher also were among the dead
recovered Sunday. The four had been on a campaign swing Wednesday
with state Rep. Bill Brewster, who was kicking off his campaign for
Congress.
   Police said the crash victims probably died instantly when the
plane, bound for Ardmore, buried its nose in a pasture in Coal
County shortly after taking off from nearby McAlester in stormy
weather.
   ``We believe it crashed within 30 minutes of departure, but that
won't be known for a while,'' Highway Patrol Lt. Mike Grimes said.
``We're basing that estimate on the distance the plane was from its
departure point.''
   The victims were Kecia Brewster, 16, and Kent Brewster, 13, who
had accompanied their father on his campaign for the 3rd District
congressional seat; Herb Pate, 32, publisher of The Madill Record;
and pilot Jack Kirkpatrick, 43, of Broken Arrow.
   Brewster and his wife were in another plane because he was
heading to Oklahoma City to attend a legislative session while the
children were heading home to Marietta, near Ardmore. A third plane
carrying Brewster's other daughter and campaign workers landed
safely at Ardmore.
   The crash site was about 7 miles north of Coalgate in
southeastern Oklahoma, roughly halfway between McAlester and
Ardmore.
   Grimes said the cause of the crash was not known. The National
Transportation Safety Board will investigate.
   Freda Rogers, who lives about 100 yards from the crash site, was
feeding cattle on her property about 4 p.m. Sunday when she saw
something shiny, Highway Patrol Lt. Stewart Meyer said. Ms. Rogers
called Coal County Sheriff Joe Stone, who confirmed the plane was
the missing aircraft, Meyer said.
   About 60 aircraft had been used in an extensive search that
began early Thursday but was hampered by fog and rain. The bad
weather forced searchers to stay on the ground much of the time,
covering the 80 miles between McAlester and Ardmore on foot,
horseback and in four-wheel-drive vehicles.
   ``It was a long, tough road and we're just sorry the way it
turned out,'' said Lt. Carolyn Wrobleski, spokeswoman for the Civil
Air Patrol in Ardmore.

   An attack on the British
Embassy has increased fears that white extremists may begin lashing
out in anger at the sweeping political changes proposed by
President F.W. de Klerk.
   Assailants shot out windows at the embassy in Pretoria on
Sunday, a day after right-wing graffiti was spray-painted on the
building. The graffiti said: ``The Struggle Begins _ Order of the
Boer (Afrikaner) People.''
   Police said they have never heard of the group but are
investigating.
   ``It is suspected that the attack by the right wing might have
come about because we, the British government, have emphasized our
support for the decisions announced by President de Klerk,''
embassy spokesman John Sawyer said today.
   De Klerk, in a speech Friday, legalized or lifted restrictions
on more than 60 anti-apartheid groups, including the African
National Congress, and promised to release jailed ANC leader Nelson
Mandela.
   Right-wing whites accused the president of capitulating to the
country's black majority and have vowed to resist the changes.
   Robert von Tonder, leader of a group that seeks a whites-only
homeland, said de Klerk's changes could lead to the formation of an
underground guerrilla movement for whites.
   Several other right-wing groups have said repeatedly they will
take up arms if they believe the government has abandoned white
privilege.
   The pro-apartheid Conservative Party, which won 31 percent of
the white vote in last year's elections, is planning a major rally
Feb. 15 in Pretoria, the capital, to protest against the
``revolutionary left-wing announcements'' by de Klerk.
   Most right-wing whites are Afrikaners. Primarily of Dutch
descent, they began settling in South Africa more than 300 years
ago and now account for about 3 million of the country's 5 million
whites.
   In school they are taught that their role as rulers was ordained
by God. Until several years ago, the main Afrikaner church taught
that the foundations of apartheid were found in the Bible.
   De Klerk's legalization of the ANC has outraged many
right-wingers, who for years have been told by the government that
the black guerrilla movement was Communist-controlled terrorist
group.
   Several recent incidents suggest a growing militancy among
right-wing groups.
   _ Police Brig. Floris Mostert said in court last month that
authorities had uncovered the existence of ``a secret organization
... with members from all levels of society, which strives to
terrorize left-wing radicals with the aid of violence and
intimidation.'' He declined to elaborate.
   _ Police in December announced the arrest of five men suspected
of planning attacks against de Klerk and other government leaders
as well as anti-apartheid activists. The men allegedly broke away
from the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement because they felt
the group was not taking decisive measures to oppose de Klerk's
reforms.
   _ Right-wing whites continue to champion the cause of Barend
Strydom, a self-professed white supremacist who shot dead seven
blacks and an Indian in Pretoria in 1988. Supporters held a service
in November to commemorate the first anniversary of the shooting.
Strydom is on Death Row for the killings.
   _ The mayor of Welkom, a conservative mining town, was tarred
and feathered last year after he granted permission for a
multi-racial running race.

   Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution, which makes
the Communist Party the ``leading and guiding force of Soviet
society,'' is the key to the party's exclusive hold on political
power.
   It is part of the Constitution adopted Oct. 7, 1977, by a
special session of the Supreme Soviet under the leadership of the
late Leonid I. Brezhnev. It has been interpreted as ruling out the
creation of competing political parties.
   The Article says:
   ``The leading and guiding force of Soviet society and the
nucleus of its political system, of all state organizations and
public organizations, is the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
The C.P.S.U. exists for the people and serves the people.
   ``The Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism, determines
the general perspectives of the development of society and the
course of the home and foreign policy of the U.S.S.R., directs the
great constructive work of the Soviet people, and imparts a
planned, systematic and theoretically substantiated character to
their struggle for the victory of communism.
   ``All party organizations shall function within the framework of
the Constitution of the U.S.S.R.''

<HEAD>HUD Insured Luxury Building's Mortgage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owners of a luxury apartment building got
special treatment from the federal Department of Housing and Urban
Development after hiring two former HUD officials as consultants,
according to a report published today.
   Local HUD officials agreed to insure a $41 million mortgage for
an apartment building on the fashionable East Side of Manhattan
even though it was already under construction, New York Newsday
reported.
   HUD usually requires application for mortgage insurance before
construction starts.
   The building's owners eventually withdrew their HUD application
and obtained the mortgage insurance elsewhere, Newsday said.
   At the time of the application for the government insurance, HUD
was told that one-bedroom apartments at the building, called ``the
Colorado,'' would rent for $2,200 a month.
   The newspaper said the two consultants to the Colorado's owners
were Alexander Naclerio, former housing director for HUD's New York
region, and Lance Wilson, a former executive assistant to Samuel R.
Pierce Jr., then secretary of HUD.
   Naclerio and Wilson were paid $25,000 each, according to one of
the owners, Norman Segal.
   Naclerio's attorney, Raymond B. Grunewald, said his client had
been hired by the owners to work on other projects but may have
helped process the Colorado's application to HUD.
   A lawyer for Wilson, Raymond Banoun, said that since the
Colorado later went elsewhere for mortgage insurance, ``I don't see
how there can be any suggestion that there's anything improper.''

<TEXT>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., announced today he
will seek re-election to a third term.
   Warner, 62, was elected to the Senate in 1978 after serving as
undersecretary of the Navy, secretary of the Navy and head of the
American Revolution Bicentennial Administration.
   He told a news conference he believes ``seniority in Congress
means an ever more experienced, ever stronger voice for Virginia.''
He said he has raised about $750,000 for his re-election effort.
   Asked how he felt about having no announced competition as yet
from the Democratic Party, Warner said he hoped that reflected
people's satisfaction with his work. ``Should there not be an
opponent, I would accept that, not in a boastful way, but with
humility, and go right on and campaign,'' he said.

   Gen. Michel Aoun's troops drove a rival
Christian militia from a key coastal town north of Beirut today and
prepared for a final assault to dislodge the militia from the
capital, police said.
   Police said 64 more people were killed and 95 wounded in both
Christian and Moslem neighborhoods since Sunday.
   The latest casualties raised the toll to at least 274 people
killed and 1,030 wounded in the week-old fighting between Aoun's
forces and the Christian militia of Samir Geagea. The factions are
battling for control of the Christian enclave.
   In Beirut, already devastated by fighting between the Christian
factions, a four-hour gun battle broke out Sunday between rival
Shiite Moslem factions in the southern slums. Police said four
people were killed and seven wounded before Syrian troops moved in
to separate the Iranian-backed fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party
of God, and the Syrian-allied Amal militia.
   A committee representing Maronite Catholic Patriarch Nasrallah
Sfeir called a cease-fire for 2:15 p.m. today, the seventh in a
week of fighting between the Christian forces.
   But the Lebanese Forces charged in a communique that Aoun's
forces mounted a large-scale attack on the militia's strongholds in
east Beirut's Ein Rummaneh district ``at the very moment the
cease-fire was slated to start. Pitched battles are raging.''
   Earlier today, Aoun began to regroup armored forces at the
northern and northeastern entrances to Beirut's eastern Christian
sector after helicopter-borne paratroopers seized the strategic
coastal town of Dbaye in close-quarter combat Sunday, authorities
said.
   A police spokesman said Aoun's soldiers, mostly trained by U.S.
Marines, ``are mopping up Geagea's Lebanese Forces militiamen from
a few remaining pockets of resistance in Dbaye before turning to
the Beirut battle.''
   The latest casualties included 59 fighters killed and 70 wounded
in the battle for Dbaye.
   Dbaye's capture was Aoun's first meaningful victory in the
showdown for mastery of Lebanon's Christian enclave.
   Shelling duels slackened at dawn, allowing tens of thousands of
residents to venture out from basements and underground bomb
shelters for the first time in six days to take stock of the
destruction.
   However, the civil defense department said fire brigades had no
water to battle fires raging out of control because all pumping
stations had been knocked out of action.
   ``I am stunned,'' said Youssef Khazen, 35, whose electrical tool
shop in east Beirut's residential district of Ashrafiyeh was gutted.
   ``You cannot believe what those monsters have done to us. They
simply ruined us. Ashrafiyeh looks like it was struck by a
hurricane,'' Khazen told The Associated Press by telephone.
   A Lebanese Forces statement today conceded the loss of Dbaye,
saying the 80-man militia garrison, which was outnumbered and
outgunned, made a ``tactical retreat of 200 meters.''
   Dbaye, five miles north of Beirut, sits at a strategic traffic
junction of the coastal highway that links Beirut and north
Lebanon. The road has been closed since the outbreak of the
fighting.
   It also has a harbor that would enable Aoun's forces to disrupt
maritime supplies to Geagea's command headquarters in east Beirut.
   Lebanese Forces defenders had held off repeated tank attacks in
east Beirut by Aoun's forces.
   ``They might not be able to hold longer. The general is now in a
stronger position,'' said the police spokesman, who cannot be
identified under standing regulations.
   Both Aoun and Geagea are Maronite Catholics, the dominant
Christian sect.
   The general, appointed head of an interim military cabinet in
September 1988 by outgoing President Amin Gemayel, considers
himself the sole legitimate authority in Lebanon.
   Geagea has been the Christians' standard bearer in the nearly
15-year-old civil war against the Moslems.
   Aoun has 20,000 troops. Geagea's heavily armed militia has 6,000
fighters and 30,000 reservists.
   Aoun's inability to crush Geagea has led to speculation that he
risks being ousted by his troops if he does not deliver a quick
victory.
   At least 1,000 of his fighters have defected, 600 to the
Lebanese Forces and 400 to Gen. Emile Lahoud, the army commander
named by Syrian-backed President Elias Hrawi, military sources
reported.
   Hrawi, another Maronite, was elected by Parliament Nov. 24 with
a mandate to oversee a peace plan brokered by the Arab League in
October. He fired Aoun as interim prime minister and army
commander, but Aoun refused to quit.
   Aoun rejected the peace accord because it fails to guarantee the
withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian troops from Lebanon. Aoun considers the
Syrians, who entered Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate, to be an army of occupation.
   In Damascus, Syria, U.S. Ambassador Edward Djerjian today blamed
Aoun's ``personal quest for power'' for the Christian battles.
   ``Aoun should step aside and all parties, including the Lebanese
armed forces, should support President Elias Hrawi now in urgent
work for restoring legal authority,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The 5-year-old girl tossed her hair, twisted around
in the chair, rolled her head, raised her arms, stood up and sat
down again, all the while dutifully answering questions from the
nice lady with the rag doll.
   A camera rolled behind a two-way mirror as the two went through
a delicate procedure that has become vital in prosecution of child
abuse cases.
   The lady told the girl that sometimes unpleasant things happen
to little children and maybe they could talk about it. She pulled
out a clothed, rag doll with hair of yarn _ and anatomical details
such as breasts and genitals.
   Together, the child and interviewer pointed to the different
body parts. No, no one had ever touched her there, said the child,
pointing. She was sure. Despite physical evidence of abuse, the
little girl wasn't talking that day.
   In recent years, the use of anatomical dolls has grown as more
child abuse cases are prosecuted. But a new study shows that the
dolls' effectiveness in aiding a child's memory may be overrated.
   ``These dolls have become very popular because some
psychologists believe they do something magical, eliciting
information they otherwise couldn't get at,'' said Bruce Forman, a
University of Miami psychologist. ``But our findings indicate
that's probably not so.''
   Anatomical dolls became available in the late 1970s and early
1980s and now are common in social workers' and prosecutors'
offices and police agencies. The dolls, costing up to $75, have
evolved from crude, unclothed figures to less-threatening, more
realistic ones with underwear and bright clothes.
   Experts agree that the dolls can help some children tell what
happened to them, especially those who are very young or are
embarrassed to talk about the incident. But the evidence is less
clear in terms of what interview tool helps get the best
information from an abused child and what is normal behavior.
   ``Clinically, many believe the dolls have a place in evaluating
suspected abused kids that cannot be taken over by another tool,''
said Mark Everson, a psychologist and co-director of the clinical
research program on childhood maltreatment at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
   In a study of whether dolls' anatomical explicitness would lead
a non-abused child to act out in a sexually suggestive manner,
Everson found that 6 percent of more than 200 children aged 2-5
showed fairly clear sexual acts with the dolls during an interview,
even when there was no history of abuse.
   In the Miami study, 45 children, aged 8 and 9, viewed a
12-minute film often used in sexual-abuse awareness programs. One
group later told what they remembered verbally, another by drawing
pictures and a third with the dolls.
   ``We found no significant difference in accuracy or completeness
of information recalled,'' Forman said. The results of the study
will be published in the journal ``Social Behavior and
Personality.''
   In another study, of 32 girls aged 5-8, the Miami researchers
found that abused girls showed somewhat more aggression and sexual
play with the dolls if an observer was not in the room than did
non-abused girls. With an adult in the room, there was little
difference between the two groups, Forman said.
   However, not all of the abused girls showed increased agression
and sexual play, indicating a need for more research on what is
normal behavior, he said.
   ``From our work, we know that children who have not been abused
display some curiosity about sexual body parts, and that's normal
and healthy when it appears at the appropriate age.'' It is
important, he added, that aggression shown by a child doesn't
necessarily imply a history of sexual abuse.
   ``We've only scratched the surface of how children react. There
are still a lot of questions,'' he said.
   Although much has been made of the potential for
over-interpretation of children's interaction with anatomical
dolls, they have become an integral part of child-abuse
investigations and the prosecution of mass child abuse cases.
   Videotaped interviews of children with the dolls was among
evidence used to convict Frank Fuster Escalona in 1985 in one of
Florida's most notorious cases, involving the abuse of children at
a baby-sitting service in Dade County. The story was retold
recently in the TV movie ``Unspeakable Acts.''
   Fuster is serving six consecutive life sentences. His wife,
Ileana, was also convicted in the so-called Country Walk case,
which involved allegations of nude sex games and satanic animal
sacrifices. She served about four years of a 10-year sentence and
was deported to her native Honduras.
   Among defense criticisms was that children had been manipulated
during the interviews and that using the dolls was inappropriate,
said John Hogan, lead prosecutor. ``Obviously the jury didn't put
much credence in that.''
   In California, defense attorneys also made an issue of how
children were interviewed in the McMartin preschool molestation
case. Peggy McMartin Buckey was cleared and son Raymond Buckey was
acquitted on most charges last month in the alleged molestation of
11 children at the now-defunct school in Manhattan Beach, a suburb
of Los Angeles. Prosecutors last week said they will retry Raymond
Buckey on the 13 counts on which the jury deadlocked.
   Mary Emmons, executive director of Children's Institute
International, where the children were interviewed, said defense
attorneys were just doing their job in attacking the methods. ``For
the most part, the methods used by mental health professionals are
well-stablished clinical methods designed to aid children in
telling what may or may not have happened,'' she said.
   Others in the field echo that sentiment.
   ``I have seen some criticism of use of the dolls ... and frankly
it all gets blown out of proportion,'' said Patricia Toth, of the
National Center for Prosecution of Child Abuse, a nonprofit group
based in Alexandria, Va.
   ``People latch onto the dolls as if they're responsible for
conviction of innocent people,'' Toth said. ``I truly don't think
they have the impact people attach to them. Dolls in and of
themselves don't make the case.''
   At the Children's Center in Miami, run by the Dade State
Attorney's Office, dolls play a prominent role in interviews. They
are primarily used for showing exactly what happened after a child
has already talked about an incident, said Teresa Pooler, an
assistant state attorney and director of the center.
   The center, founded in December 1986 after the Country Walk
case, has about 18 dolls in adult, child and toddler size. The
females have vaginas and breasts and the males have penises. An
average of 70 children are interviewed a month.
   ``We use the dolls for demonstrative purposes, not for diagnosis
as to whether something in fact occurred,'' said Pooler, adding
children often have different names for body parts and difficulty
with spatial relationships.
   ``I think anything that can be used to elicit a statement from a
child is a positive thing,'' she said, ``provided it's used
properly.''

Performs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Doctors at a hospital where the world's
first implant of a lung assist device has taken place say it may be
years before they can assess its potential.
   Last week, a 16-year-old girl became the first human recipient
of the IntraVascular Oxygenator, known as IVOX. The girl, whose
name was not released. remained in critical condition at LDS
Hospital early today.
   Dr. Alan Morris, director of pulmonary research, and Dr. Terry
Clemmer, director of critical-care medicine, said it may be months
or even years before they can assess the medical significance of
IVOX, which has received approval by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for up to 10 experimental implants.
   IVOX is an inch-wide bundle of plastic fibers that mimic the
lung's task of supplying oxygen to the body. It was implanted
during a two-hour operation Friday.
   It was unclear how long doctors hope to keep the device in the
patient. In September, guidelines approved by the Food and Drug
Administration limited implants to seven days in people with acute
respiratory failure who have little or no chance of survival.
   However, hospital spokesman Tim Madden said Sunday the seven
days is considered to be a ``rough guideline'' by doctors.
   ``It's not hard and fast, although there is a limit they think
they can use it for, and that is about a week,'' he said.
   Hospital officials have released little information about the
operation, or the patient's status. Madden said he was unable to
discuss how doctors would decide when to remove the device. ``That
would get into an area I just can't,'' he said.
   IVOX's developer, Dr. J.D. Mortensen of Salt Lake City, says
while it cannot be called an artificial lung, it represents an
important step toward eventual development of one.
   Implantation involves insertion of the device via the neck or
groin into the inferior vena cava, the large vein that brings blood
to the heart.
   Two tubes the diameter of a soda straw are attached to the IVOX
bundle _ consisting of 900-1,200 hollow, porous fibers each about
the diameter of a human hair. One delivers oxygen to the body from
an oxygen system or tank, the other removes carbon dioxide, a waste
product of breathing.
   Mortensen said the initial FDA-approved human experiments will
involve only patients with acute lung disease, such as pneumonia or
smoke inhalation, not long-term, chronic disorders such as cystic
fibrosis or emphysema.
   The only alternative for people with acute lung failure is an
extra corporeal oxygenator, a large machine that requires pumping
the blood outside the body.

   Eleven United Mine Workers members on
strike for more than five years were arrested today on charges of
breaking into the UMW District 30 office in a protest of
termination of their strike benefits.
   Members of UMW Local 2492 in Phelps, near Pikeville in the
coalfields of eastern Kentucky, remained outside the office
afterward, continuing the protest.
   The 90-member local has been striking McCoy-Caney Coal Co., now
called Colonial Coal Co., near Phelps since 1984 when the company
refused to sign the 1984 Bituminous Coal Operators' Association
contract, the national contract with the UMW.
   The miners received their last strike benefit check on Dec. 15,
and their health benefits could end within 30 days, said Hilman
Dotson, president of Local 2492.
   Dotson was one of those charged with breaking into the UMW
district office early today in an attempt to bring attention to
their plight.
   Police went to the office about 12:45 a.m. EST to investigate a
reported break-in and arrested the men on third-degree burglary
charges, according to police records. The men were released after
each posted $5,000 bond.
   The miners returned to the office parking lot after their
release and were joined by about 30 other union members about 5
a.m., Dotson said.
   ``We're going to protest at the office until we get our checks
back,'' said Dotson, who pledged that the protest would be peaceful.
   Dotson said they were losing their strike benefits because the
union's international leadership determined there was no movement
in contract talks.
   The frustrated miners also picketed outside the UMW office on
Dec. 18.
   A sign on one of the miners' trucks mentioned UMW Vice President
Cecil Roberts and a union occupation of a coal processing plant in
Virginia last summer.
   ``If Cecil Roberts can occupy _ he taught us this tactic _ so
can we,'' it said.
   Dotson said Leonard Fleming, co-administrator of District 30,
spoke with the men today and promised to present their concerns to
the international union.
   One of the miners, Homer Estep, said he has had a tough time
feeding his family since his strike benefits were cut off.
   ``I'm living now on $92 a month and there's four of us at
home,'' he said. ``It's pretty bad when you get up in the morning
and you only have a piece of bologna to give the boys for
breakfast.''
   Telephone calls to the district office went unanswered this
morning. In Washington, UMW staff member Bill Banig said he had not
been aware of the situation and declined to comment.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's Parliament today added eight
members of pro-democracy groups to Communist Premier Hans Modrow's
government, giving the opposition seats in the Cabinet for the
first time in the country's 40-year history.
   The Communists now hold less than half of the 36 Cabinet seats.
   Also today, Parliament banned the ultra-right Republican Party
of West Germany from operating in East Germany. The party had been
hoping to attract major voter support during upcoming elections.
   On Sunday, the Communist Party changed its name and promised to
hand over $600 million in assets to the government in an attempt to
refurbish its image before the elections. The first free balloting
in the country's history is set for March 18.
   In an address to Parliament, Modrow said today that German
reunification is inevitable, although many obstacles need to be
overcome because the two German nations have vastly different legal
and financial structures. He said his proposal last week that a
united Germany be neutral was not meant to be the final word on the
matter.
   ``I never believed that all points of my proposals would be
accepted by everyone,'' he said.
   The United States and other NATO countries insist that a united
Germany be a part of the Western alliance. West Germany has said
that while it seeks German unity, it will not leave NATO.
   ``I made my proposals (on unification) ... to create conditions
for the inevitable process of unification of the German states,''
Modrow said.
   Modrow asked West Germany to provide immediate, short-term
financial assistance to help stabilize East Germany's flagging
economy, which has been further worsened by strikes and an exodus
of more than 50,000 East Germans to West Germany this year.
   The Communists are widely blamed for the nation's economic
problems.
   Modrow told Parliament that East Germany needs a government of
``national responsibiity'' to lead it away from the brink of
economic disaster and toward the free elections, which were made
possible by a pro-democracy revolution last year that ousted
hard-line Communist Party chief Erich Honecker.
   Following Modrow's address, Parliament approved his
recommendations that the eight opposition officials be added to his
Cabinet.
   The Communist Party now holds 17 of 36 seats in the new
government. Besides those given to the pro-democracy forces, the
other seats are held by parties once aligned with the Communists.
   The eight newly appointed opposition officials are Tatjana Boehm
of the Independent Women's Association, Rainer Eppelmann of
Democratic Awakening, Sebastian Pflugbeil of New Forum, Matthias
Platzek of the Greens Party, Gerd Poppe from the Initiative for
Peace and Human Rights, Wolfgang Ullmann from Democracy Now, Klaus
Schlueter of the Green League, and Walter Romberg of the Social
Democrats.
   Earlier today, both opposition leaders and the Communists
discouraged West German politicians from stumping for East German
candidates. At round-table negotiations, 10 of the 22 participants
said West German politicians should not be invited to be guest
speakers at election rallies.
   Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt already has led a
campaign rally for the East German Social Democrats, and had
planned further appearances. Chancellor Helmut Kohl also has said
he is planning to stump for candidates.
   The Communists especially have objected to the plans, saying
such appearances amount to unfair interference in East German
affairs.
   Parliament today barred the Republicans, neo-Nazi groups and
other right-wing extremists from trying to spread their doctrines
and beliefs in East Germany. A resolution said ``immediate measures
are needed for the protection of the state and its citizens''
because of the activities of neo-Nazis and Republicans.
   It said there recently have been threats of ``violent acts''
that ``seriously threatened the process of renewal'' in East
Germany.
   The Republicans are a legal party in West Germany, and during
the past year they have been able to win seats in a number of state
legislatures and local governing bodies.
   On Sunday, Communist leaders changed the party's name to the
Party of Democratic Socialism. It previously had been known as the
Socialist Unity Party of Germany.
   The party said it would hand over the $600 million from its
private reserves because the ``country's economic situation
requires such support,'' the government news agency ADN reported.
   ADN said the money came from party dues and party-owned
businesses such as printing operations. It did not say what the
party's total reserves are.

<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department said today that
beginning next Oct. 1, it will not issue $50 and $75 Series EE
savings bonds through payroll savings plans, making $100 bonds the
minimum denomination for plan participants.
   ``This step is one of several initiatives that will assure the
long-term strength of the savings bonds program by reducing
administrative costs,'' Richard L. Gregg, commissioner of the
public debt, said in a statement.
   The change does not affect over-the-counter sales at financial
institutions where $50 and $75 bonds will still be available.
   The Treasury said employees who currently buy $50 and $75 bonds
will not be required to complete new bond authorizations. Instead,
current allotments will automatically be applied to the purchase of
$100 bonds.
   The Treasury began phasing out $50 and $75 bonds from payroll
savings in February 1988 by no longer offering them to new
enrollees.
   Payroll savings allows employees to buy savings bonds on the
installment plan through regular payments withheld from their
paychecks. Bonds are issued when the price of a bond is accumulated.

   Capital murder charges have been filed
against two men suspected in the slayings of a couple and their two
children, who were each shot more than once and their bodies left
in their burning home.
   Anthony Carr, 24, of Clarksdale and Robert Simon Jr. 26, of
Memphis, Tenn., were arrested Saturday in Clarksdale, said Highway
Patrol Lt. Kenny Dickerson.
   The victims, Carl Webster Parker, 58, his wife, Bobbie Jo, 45,
and their children, Charlotte Jo, 9, and Gregory, 12, apparently
walked in on a burglary Friday night at their home in Quitman
County, about 15 miles from Clarksdale in the northwestern part of
the state, police said.
   All were shot between two and four times at close range, said
Quitman County Coroner J.W. Jenkins.
   ``They were all shot in the back,'' Jenkins said. ``There were
two different guns used.''
   ``The little girl also was raped,'' he said. ``It looked like
she had broken loose and tried to run.'' The girl was shot three
times in the back and once in the right hip, he said.
   The Lambert Volunteer Fire Department received a call late
Friday that the Parkers' home was burning, said Assistant Fire
Chief Chris Dancy. Investigators said they suspect the fire was set
to cover the killings.
   Firefighters pulled the bodies of Parker and the two children
from a rear room before flames gutted the house, Dancy said.
   ``All three were within 5 feet of each other,'' Jenkins said.
   ``We didn't know they'd been shot. We figured they died from
smoke inhalation,'' Dancy said.
   After the fire was extinguished, Mrs. Parker's body was found in
a back bedroom. Parker's pickup was found abandoned in Clarksdale
early Saturday, Dickerson said.
   The family was returning home from a Bible study class at
Riverside Baptist Church in Clarksdale at the time of the slayings,
the pastor there said.

activists killed in clashes with police, and leaders of both the
Albanian majority and Slav minority said they see no hope of talks
to end the ethnic violence.
   Several thousand ethnic Albanians assembled in the center of
this provincial capital for a moment of silence called by newly
formed opposition groups. At 2 p.m., car horns sounded throughout
the city and pedestrians stopped on sidewalks, raising their hands
in the ``V'' for victory sign.
   Planes flew overhead and riot police stood by, but did not
interfere. As the moment ended people applauded, then returned to
their daily routine.
   ``We are not terrorists, we're just paying homage. We didn't
kill anybody. We want every nation to live in equality and
freedom,'' one ethnic Albanian participant said.
   In their quest for more autonomy, the ethnic Albanians have
taken up calls sounded elsewhere in Eastern Europe for multiparty
democracy, free elections and the release of political prisoners.
   Throughout the countryside today, cars stopped on roads, people
filled village streets and workers put down their tools in fields
and factories to observe the moment of silence.
   On a hillside outside Pristina, 200 mourners stood silently at
the grave of one of the 25 demonstrators who have been killed in
clashes with police since Jan. 24. A security forces helicopter
hovered overhead.
   On Friday, federal authorities brought at least a temporary halt
to the killing. They sent army tanks into Kosovo and staged a show
of force with military jets flying low over Pristina and other
cities.
   But leaders of both Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the province's 1.9 million inhabitants, and its Slav
minority of Serbs and Montenegrins said today there was little hope
for a peaceful resolution.
   ``The peace is just a cover,'' said Bogdan Kecman, leader of the
Serb minority group Bozur. ``Inside, war is raging.''
   Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, a writer who chairs the
newly formed Democratic Union of Kosovo, echoed Kecman's pessimism.
   The ethnic Albanians have been seeking more autonomy since
Serbia, the Yugoslav republic that administers Kosovo, last year
imposed greater control over the province's police, judiciary and
schools.
   The Serb minority says the move was necessary to protect Slavs
in Kosovo from alleged harassment by ethnic Albanians that is
driving them out of the region, the cradle of Serbian culture.
   ``There cannot be any talks with Albanian nationalists,'' Kecman
told The Associated Press. The Serbs allege that the ethnic
Albanians seek union with neighboring Communist Albania.
   Also today, the trial of Kosovo's former leader, Azem Vllasi,
and 14 other ethnic Albanians resumed in Titova Mitrovica, north of
Pristina.
   Vllasi, a political archrival of Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic, and the others are accused of ``counter-revolutionary
activities'' and of inciting last year's unrest.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the Communist Party
leadership today that the time has come to loosen the party's iron
grip on power and compete with others for the right to rule the
Soviet Union.
   His landmark speech to the party's Central Committee came a day
after perhaps the largest protest in Moscow since the Bolshevik
revolution. At least 200,000 impassioned citizens marched to the
Kremlin, demanding that the party embrace reform and end exclusive
control of the government.
   At the opening session of a pivotal two-day Central Committee
meeting, Gorbachev made essentially the same proposal.
   The party ``intends to struggle for the role of ruling party,
but do it strictly in the framework of the democratic process,
rejecting any kind of legal or political advantage,'' Gorbachev
told the policy-making body.
   The party will ``present its own program, put it out for
discussion, cooperate with other public-political forces,'' the
Soviet leader said in remarks distributed by the Tass news agency.
   The meeting comes at a time of growing dissatisfaction with the
Communist leadership by the populace plagued by chronic shortages
and ethnic unrest.
   The Tass news agency reported that Gorbachev urged the party to
move up the next Communist Party congress, theoretically the
party's highest-ranking body, to late June.
   Presumably it would be to allow him to choose a new Central
Committee and further advance radical reforms in the party.
   The 251-member Central Committee, despite extensive changes made
by Gorbachev in recent years, is still regarded by reformers as a
bastion of party conservatives who worry that Gorbachev's reforms
are leading the country to economic collapse and ethnic strife.
   The proposed changes by Gorbachev would meet some of the demands
of the reformers who rallied an estimated 200,000 people just
outside the Kremlin on Sunday.
   One of their leaders, Communist reformer Boris N. Yeltsin, said
the Central Committee's plenary meeting represented the party's
``last chance.''
   Tass said Yeltsin, who remains a Central Committee member
despite his populist campaign against party privilege, was one of
those who spoke after Gorbachev during the opening session of the
Central Committee meeting.
   Gorbachev's statement to Central Committee meeting, which had
been anticipated for weeks and expected to turn into a battle
between conservatives and reformers, pushed the party toward
elimination of its constitutionally guaranteed position as the
``leading and guiding force'' of Soviet society.
   The former Soviet satellites of Eastern Europe abd party leaders
in the Soviet Baltic republics already have given up their
exclusive right to power.
   The political reforms through which he has strengthened the
government at the expense of the party apparatus ``have been
accompanied by a growth in political pluralism,'' Gorbachev said.
``This process can lead to the creation of parties at some stage.''
   Gorbachev declared that the party now was ``ready to act taking
into account these new circumstances, cooperate and carry out a
dialogue with all organizations that stand on constitutional
grounds, and the social structure established in it.''
   Earlier last week, Gorbachev denied a U.S. broadcast report that
he was considering stepping down as party chief but remaining
president. In such a scenario, Gorbachev would continue to run the
country with the decison-making power once concentrated in the
party transferred to legislative bodies.
   Some demonstrators on Sunday carried signs warning Communist
officials who resist change to ``Remember Romania,'' where
Communist dicatator Nicolae Ceausescu was toppled in a bloody
December revolution.
   Others called for the ruling party Politburo to resign.
   It served notice on the Central Committee that a disgruntled
populace expects radical changes. The people are angered by the
dismal state of the economy, which has wrought worsening consumer
shortages, and they resent that many Communist officials exploit
their power and enjoy comforts and goods denied the populace.
   A wall of protesters 60 wide and more than a half-mile long had
marched from Gorky Park, through some of Moscow's widest streets,
to a rally at the steps of the Moscow Hotel across from Red Square.
   They demanded that the Communist Party give up its
constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on political power.
   ``We need a free society, with a free economy ... a society of
free people,'' declared economist Gavriil Popov.
   The crowd waved huge white-red-and-blue flags of
pre-revolutionary Russia.
   ``Long live the beginning of the peaceful, non-violent
revolution of February 1990!'' historian Yuri Afanasiev told the
cheering crowd.
   The rally united reformers from the People's Front organizations
of Moscow and Russia, the Association of Moscow Voters, the
Memorial group dedicated to remembering the victims of Stalin, and
other reformers. It marked another step in a rapid solidification
of the reformers' movement.
   The Radio Moscow news service, Interfax, also said Gorbachev was
planning structural reforms that would reduce the size of the
Central Committee and possibly eliminate the Politburo. He also was
expected to give tacit approval to the concept of private property.
   However, he cautioned that a retooled political system could not
be considered a solution for all the country's problems.
   The Soviet Union is the last Warsaw Pact country where the
Communists still have a guaranteed lock on power.
   However, in the country's Baltic republics, the party already
has given up its claim to exclusive power and many small, local
parties are forming to compete in local elections scheduled for
later this month.
   Many Moscow observers expected the Central Committee meeting to
develop into a pitched battled between reformers who want quicker
change and conservatives who feel that reforms are wrecking the
economy and causing ethnic strife.
   The two-day Central Committee meeting is likely to be the last
before local elections. Most of the voting is scheduled to take
place in the next six weeks.
   Many prominent local party officials were embarrassed by defeat
in the last national elections in March.

   A convicted killer was arrested after he
shot his girlfriend to death, drove to a restaurant with police in
pursuit and took nine people hostage for up to 6{ hours, police
said. The hostages were all freed unharmed.
   Fred Goodine Jr. was being held at the Pickens County Law
Enforcement Center pending a bond hearing later today on charges of
murder and kidnapping, sheriff's department officials said.
   Police said Goodine, 47, shot his girlfriend at about 11:20 a.m.
Sunday. The woman, 40-year-old Mary Williams of Central, died an
hour and a half later.
   Shortly after the shooting, Goodine was spotted driving through
Clemson. Police gave chase because his car matched the description
given for the suspect in Ms. Williams' shooting.
   He pulled up to the Shoney's restaurant on U.S. 123 and went
inside, officials said. Workers there said he was a regular
customer.
   Dennis McDill, a waiter at Shoney's, said the restaurant had a
lunchtime crowd of about 75 to 100 people when the hostage incident
began. Police Chief Johnson Link said Goodine took nine hostages.
   One of the hostages, waitress Lori Hockman, said they were held
in the kitchen, and both gunman and hostages remained calm.
   ``He wasn't pointing the gun at anyone. I don't think he was
really threatening anyone at that point,'' she said. ``He seemed
like he was reasonable, but I'm sure that he probably feels
trapped.''
   When she and another woman began crying, the gunman let them go,
she said.
   The others were released unharmed one at a time over the next
few hours. Only a manager remained when Goodine surrendered about
6:15 p.m., officials said.
   Earlier in the day, said Goodine's wife, Betty, he was ``talking
sort of weird'' and mentioned she might soon need a black coat.
   Mrs. Goodine said she knew of her husband's girlfriend but held
no animosity toward her.
   ``I'm not the kind of person who hates,'' she said. ``If I'm
serving God, then I can't hate someone.'' The couple married when
both were 15, she said.
   Court records show that Goodine was charged with murder in 1982
for the shooting death of Barbara J. Henderson, 41, whom he was
dating. He was convicted on a lesser voluntary manslaughter charge
in 1983, and served part of a five-year prison sentence.

   RCA Corp. pleaded guilty in federal court
today to two felony charges and was fined $2.5 million as part of
the continuing probe of contractors who acquired and passed along
secret Defense Department plans for weapons systems.
   One former and one current RCA employee also entered guilty
pleas to charges of illegally conveying government property.
   The government told U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris that
in the years 1978-1985, RCA acquired copies of a wide range of
Department of Defense documents dealing with program objectives,
internal decisions and budget estimates.
   ``Both counts of the information to which RCA plead guilty
concrned RCA's unauthorized acquisition of secret editions of the
Department of Defense's five-year defense program,'' said the U.S.
attorney's office.
   One count charged that RCA, through former employee Leonard
Kampf, gave others within the company a copy of the five-year
program for 1985. The other count made a similar charge for 1986,
involving Ronald Stevens.
   Stevens, 49, manager of marketing services at RCA's Aerospace
and Defense Division at Cherry Hill, N.J. and Kampf, 69, former
manager of marketing information and communications in Cherry Hill,
face possible sentences of up to 10 years in prison and fines of
$10,000. As part of their plea agreement, the two agreed to
cooperate with the investigation.
   Stevens has been suspended from his duties, said George Jamison,
a spokesman for General Electric Co., which purchased RCA in 1986.
   RCA agreed to enter the guilty plea when it learned the two
planned to plead guilty to charges of conveying government
documents without proper authority, according to a statement from
GE.
   ``This unfortunate chapter in RCA history is now closed,'' GE
said in a statement.
   The settlement is the second in three months. The Boeing Co.
recently paid $5.2 million to settle civil and criminal charges
involving similar violations.

   An outbreak of cholera has killed 12
people and forced 91 to seek treatment at hospitals, the Health
Ministry said Monday.
   Health Minister Mavis Muyundu ordered restrictions on public
gatherings including funerals, weddings and sporting events to halt
the spread of cholera from the western suburbs and central areas of
the capital of Lusaka.
   Street vendors were prohibited from selling food, and residents
were advised to boil drinking water, she said.
   Ten treatment centers were set up in the city, and authorities
were ordered to ensure the bodies of cholera victims were buried
within hours of death.
   The government postponed Wednesday's start of a national
convention of the ruling United National Independence Party because
of the outbreak. It was delayed until Feb. 12.
   Cholera is an intestinal disease spread mainly by poor hygiene
and sanitation.

   It is the federal government's newest
nuclear reactor, a gleaming showcase amid aging Cold War-era
plants. And it is about to be closed.
   The Department of Energy, in a cost-cutting move, announced last
week it will shut the Hanford nuclear reservation's Fast Flux Test
Facility.
   The 8-year-old test reactor, largest of its kind, never had a
permanent mission. Supporters hoped to win the assignment of
producing plutonium for the space program. Instead of using the
reactor here, DOE will rely on reactors more than 30 years old at
the Savannah River project near Aiken, S.C.
   The department says that project costs far less to maintain and
operate than the $1 billion Flux.
   Savannah River has been shut down because of safety problems,
however, and Hanford's supporters say it's hypocritical for the
department, supposedly committed to safety, to cast its fate with
the South Carolina project.
   ``This is a reactor that meets every standard, and they don't
want to pay for it,'' said Rep. Sid Morrison, R-Wash., who is
leading a fight in Congress to restore operating funds for one of
the biggest employers in his district.
   Flux is the only defense reactor that meets federal standards
for commercial nuclear plants, said Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash. And
it has an operating record commercial reactors would envy, running
98 percent of the time it was supposed to in 1986, the Energy
Department said.
   But the department, facing billions of dollars in replacement
costs from decades of mismanaging its reactor complexes here, in
South Carolina, in Colorado and elsewhere, decided to shut Flux
during the next four years.
   That will cost 1,000 jobs at Hanford, which lost 2,000 jobs
during the past two years when plutonium production for nuclear
weapons ended.
   ``Unfortunately the message people get out of this is they may
be praised for their work ethics and attitudes, but the jobs will
go somewhere else that is cheaper,'' Morrison said.
   Built as a prototype for the Clinch River breeder reactor
program, Flux began life in 1982 without a permanent mission when
Congress decided to kill that expensive experiment to design a
reactor that could generate and burn its own plutonium.
   But the Hanford test reactor was started up and has been
performing experiments on the durability of reactor parts and fuel,
producing radioactive isotopes for medicine, and carrying out other
functions.
   ``Fast flux'' refers to the speed of neutrons on the reactor
core during the fission process. The neutrons are not slowed down
as in conventional reactors, which makes the production of nuclear
fuel quicker.
   Lacking a permanent mission, the test reactor faced annual
funding battles. But last year Energy Secretary James Watkins
offered encouragement that production of plutonium-238 for the
nation's space reactor program would be transferred from Savannah
River to Hanford, after extensive modifications.
   But a budget analysis prepared for the department showed that
modifying and operating the Hanford reactor for plutonium
production would cost more than $1 billion through fiscal 1995
versus $172 million at Savannah River.
   In addition, the department said once Savannah River's reactors
are restarted, they would be the only ones able to produce
plutonium in the early 1990s in time to meet National Aeronautics
and Space Administration and Pentagon needs.
   Hanford supporters say the Energy Department's budget concerns
did not factor in the costs of writing off the $1 billion
investment in Flux. It also didn't take into account that the
Savannah River plants will have to be replaced soon anyway _ if
restarted at all.
   The Flux shutdown is scheduled to begin in April and conclude by
fiscal 1994, at a cost estimated at $275 million.
   Though members of the state's congressional delegation
unanimously promised to fight the shutdown, some conceded privately
that they face an uphill battle.
   For one thing, the Savannah River plants are much cheaper to
operate.
   For another, the Energy Department cushioned the blow to Hanford
by boosting the site's total budget request by $217 million, to a
record $1.2 billion, and adding 300 jobs to a workforce of more
than 13,000. Most of the increases will go toward the 30-year
cleanup of the nuclear wastes at the department's most polluted
site.
   But Morrison argues that cleanup funds are owed because of past
federal abuses of the environment.
   Hanford was created as part of the Manhattan Project to beat
Nazi Germany to the atomic bomb during World War II, and residents
are proud of their history of making something useful for the
nation, Morrison said.
   ``We want to produce something,'' Morrison said. ``That's born
in us.''

   The senior Republican on the Senate Armed
Services Committee said today his panel will look into a report
that the Pentagon has stockpiled $30 billion worth of unnecessary
supplies and equipment.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia said that he and Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., the Armed Services Committee chairman, ``will go to work on
the problem,'' described in a Senate Budget Committee staff report
disclosed over the weekend.
   Warner, however, said he did not believe the value of
unnecessary supplies was as high as $30 billion, saying he thought
it was more like $10 billion. He said he based the lower estimate
on discussions he had with an assistant secretary of defense, whom
he did not identify.
   The report said that the Defense Department has roughly $100
billion in supplies and equipment stockpiled at various
installations and that as much as $30 billion worth of the material
is going to waste.
   ``They have a 13,000-year supply of a particular part for an
F-14 fighter aircraft,'' Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of
the Budget Committee, said today. ``There are a number of other
instances similar to that.''
   The Budget Committee's findings were based in part by staff
aides' visits to military bases around the country and on
interviews with Pentagon officials.
   The committee staff found, among other things, that there was a
glut of supplies and that in many instances equipment was stored in
the open and was deteriorating.
   The report's release came as Congress is beginning to weigh the
Bush administration's proposed $295 billion budget for fiscal 1991,
which begins next Oct. 1.
   Appearing on NBC-TV's ``Today,'' show, Sasser said, ``The
Pentagon has over $100 billion in spare parts. About $30 billion of
those spare parts would be characterized as excess, as not needed.''
   The senator said the excess supplies included, among other
things, ``a female dress shirt that was prepared and tailored for
the military. And this is a result of a study that cost $3.2
million.
   ``They studied the number of sizes they needed and they
concluded 40 sizes of the shirt weren't enough so they went up to
120 sizes,'' Sasser said. ``Now, $3 million of these shirts are
still gathering dust in Pentagon warehouses and now they've shifted
over to a different shirt style entirely.''
   ``So this is an example of the kind of problems we have in
Pentagon procurement practices,'' he said.
   Sasser also said the Defense Department has spent over $700
million in the past six to eight years for additional warehouse
space. ``And now with the troops on the verge of returning from
Europe, we're going to have just a glut of material that we're
going to have to store or deal with some way,'' he said. ``So I
predict we're going to see war surplus stores bulging at the seams
again just as they did after World War II.''

   A defense lawyer today asked the jury hearing
John Gotti's assault trail to acquit the reputed mob boss, charging
that prosecutors suffered from a ``disease'' that compelled them to
chase Gotti.
   Gerald Shargel said there was absolutely no proof that Gotti,
49, and a reputed mob associate, Anthony Guerrieri, 61, had ordered
the revenge shooting of John F. O'Connor, the former vice president
of Carpenters' Union Local 608.
   Shargel ridiculed the prosecution's two key pieces of evidence _
testimony of convict James McElroy and audio tapes secretly
recorded in 1986 at Gotti's Queens hangout and in the visiting room
at the Rikers Island jail.
   ``When the smoke clears, you will realize one thing _ that there
is no proof, let alone proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that John
Gotti and Anthony Guerrieri had John O'Connor shot,'' Shargel said.
   He said prosecutors are afflicted with an illness _ ``a disease
that will cause them to do anything to get John Gotti.'' Gotti is
reputed to be the boss of the Gambino crime family.
   McElroy, a member of a criminal gang called the Westies who is
serving a 60-year prison sentence, testified that he went to the
funeral of a reputed Gambino underboss, Frank DeCicco, and was
introduced as the Westie who was going to ``whack'' O'Connor.
   ``James McElroy is saying what he knows the prosecutors want to
hear,'' Shargel said.
   The tapes in question were difficult to hear and the defense
pointed out that transcripts of the same conversations used in a
federal court trial differed from transcripts used in this trial,
in state court.
   ``You've seen time and again that they misinterpreted on the
tapes,'' Shargel said. ``They (prosecutors) know full well that the
tapes don't prove the case.''
   A second defense lawyer, Bruce Cutler, and Assistant District
Attorney Michael Cherkasky also were scheduled to give summations
today. The jury could get the case Tuesday.
   The prosecution maintains the defendants had Westies gang
members shoot O'Connor in retaliation for vandalism at a restaurant
that which is controlled by an alleged Gotti associate, Philip
Modica.
   O'Connor allegedly had the restaurant trashed because
construction there was done by non-union workers.
   The prosecution's summation was expected to focus on testimony
by McElroy, who said he was part of the group of Westies gang
members who shot O'Connor as a favor to Gotti.
   The defense maintains McElroy is not credible because he
testified that prosecutors said his cooperation in the case could
help his girlfriend, who faces drug charges.
   The principal evidence against Gotti was a series of secretly
recorded tapes.
   In one, Gotti allegedly told an associate, ``We're gonna, gonna
bust him up.''
   The defense maintains this section of the tape is largely
inaudible and that the transcription by law enforcement officials
is inaccurate.
   Although jurors will be allowed to hear the tapes during their
deliberations, Acting Justice Edward McLaughlin said he was not
sure he would allow them access to the transcripts.
   The state Supreme Court jury has been sequestered in a hotel.
   O'Connor, who was shot in the buttocks May 7, 1986, appeared as
a surprise witness for the defense. He admitted that the union was
plagued by intercine troubles and said it was possible that someone
within the union could have arranged to have him shot.
   He said he saw the gunman but was unable to identify him from
photographs of suspects.
   O'Connor faces charges in a 127-count indictment with extortion,
perjury, larceny and labor racketeering.

   Rita Klimova, a former teacher and
dissident, was appointed ambassador to the United States by
President Vaclav Havel on Monday, the CTK news agency reported.
   The appointment comes on the eve of Havel's visit to the United
States, where he is scheduled to meet with President Bush on Feb.
20.
   Ms. Klimova, 58, was a political economics teacher at the
Charles University in Prague before she was dismissed for her
political views after the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of
Czechoslovakia.
   She then worked as a translator for underground publications and
became known as ``the voice of the revolution'' for having
interpreted for Havel at news conferences during Czechoslovakia's
peaceful revolution in November.
   Ms. Klimova spent her childhood in the United States with her
parents, who fled Czechoslovakia before World War II.

<HEAD>Officials Concerned Over Signs of Corrosion in Trans-Alaska
Pipeline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corrosion caused by the failure of
controversial protective coating and tape wraps has weakened parts
of the 800-mile crude oil Trans-Alaska pipeline, triggering a
federal probe, according to a published report.
   Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the oil industry consortium that
operates the pipeline, has already started making repairs on the
line, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday. Alyeska officials
maintain the corrosion poses no immediate danger to its operations
or to the environment.
   The pipeline carries crude oil from Alaska's North Slope to
Valdez, where the crude is transferred to tankers for shipment to
refineries.
   If left unchecked, corrosion could eventually weaken the
half-inch-thick steel wall of the pipe, which is pressurized and
could rupture, conceivably spawning an oil spill requiring a costly
pipeline shutdown.
   ``We have sufficient early warning in this case,'' said Bill
Howitt, Alyeska's manager for engineering. ``We don't have pipeline
integrity problems.''
   But Jack Overly, western regional division chief for the federal
Office of Pipeline Safety, said: ``The extent of it (corrosion) we
don't know, but it's big enough that it could affect the integrity
of the pipeline.''
   Alyeska may have violated federal safety regulations by failing
to adequately maintain portions of its systems designed to retard
corrosion, according to Office of Pipeline Safety staff reports,
the newspaper said.
   The Office of Pipeline Safety, part of the Department of
Transportation, could decide by spring whether to cite Alyeska for
violating federal guidelines, the story said.
   Pipeline inspection reports show that safeguards against
corrosion often were incomplete or faulty to begin with, the Times
reported.
   Before pipeline operations began in 1977, preparations for
laboratory tests of corrosion were set up at the National Bureau of
Standards. But those tests were never conducted, the newspaper
said, adding that most of the corrosion was caused by the failure
of a protective coating and tape wraps, which many critics earlier
had warned were flawed.
   Alyeska has said repairs on weakened portions of the line can be
completed without disrupting oil flow for more than 2{ days over
the next 18 months. Until repairs can be completed, pressure in the
line has been reduced by 20 percent in key locations.
   The pipeline rehabilitation plan could cost operators $1.5
billion over the next five years, and under a complex formula used
to determine royalties paid to Alaska, the state could lose $22
million this year alone, said Alaska Attorney General Douglas B.
Baily.
   Federal inspectors also blamed corrosion in storage tank bottoms
at the Valdez terminal on salty sand used as landfill beneath the
tanks.
   Alyeska officials, however, maintain that the tanks were
constructed on an asphalt base.

<HEAD>Student Who Visited North Korea Gets 10 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Im Su-kyong, a college student known
to her supporters as the ``flower of unification,'' was convicted
Monday of illegally visiting North Korea and sentenced to 10 years
in prison.
   She was the first student sentenced to prison for visiting the
communist nation.
   As the three-judge court declared them guilty, Miss Im and a
dissident Roman Catholic priest on trial with her shouted: ``Wake
up, judges who ignore unification!''
   The priest, the Rev. Moon Gyu-hyon, 41, was sentenced to eight
years for visiting North Korea. He went there to accompany Miss Im
home.
   Both the defense and prosecution said they would appeal. The
prosecution had sought 15 years in prison for Miss Im and 10 for
Moon.
   About 30 radical students and Catholic priests raised clenched
fists and shouted ``Release them!'' from the gllery of the Seoul
District Criminal Court.
   The Rev. Moon Jung-hyon, a Catholic priest who is Moon's older
brother, was expelled from the court after violating several orders
to keep quiet.
   ``Is this a fair trial?'' he shouted as guards escorted him awat.
   A few hundred students protest rallies at Sogang and Hankook
universities in Seoul, but did not confront police and dispersed
voluntarily after less than two hours.
   Presiding Judge Hwang Sang-hyun pronounced Miss Im and Moon
guilty of traveling to North Korea last summer in violation of
national security laws.
   He said they had instructions from North Korea to foment
protests against the United States and the South Korean government
when they returned to Seoul through the border village of Panmunjom
on Aug. 15.
   ``These days, war is a total war which involves politics,
economics and other help'' the judge said. ``By providing the North
with information regarding South Korean dissidents and opposition
and other matters, they helped the North militarily.''
   Miss Im testified that her trip July 1-8 to a world youth
festival in North Korea was intended to promote Korean unification,
but the judge said it benefited only North Korea, which he said was
bent on making South Korea communist.
   South Koreans are not allowed to visit North Korea without
government approval. The two Koreas were created when the peninsula
was divided in 1945, at the end of World War II, and fought a war
in 1950-53.
   A dissident clergyman, the Rev. Moon Ik-hwan, was sentenced to
10 years in prison in October for visiting North Korean leaders
early in 1989 without government approval.
   In the verdict Monday, Hwang said the defendants never
criticized North Korea while there, but spoke against South Korea
and the United States.
   A North Korean film shown on South Korean television last year
showed them denouncing the government in Seoul as a ``lackey of the
U.S. imperialists.''
   Radical students, dissidents and North Korea demand withdrawal
of the 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. The radicals
are a small, vocal minority among South Korea's 42 million people
and have lost public support largely because of their violent
tactics and extreme views.
   In another legal action Monday, a Seoul appeals court accepted a
defense argument and released dissident leader Lee Bu-young on a
stay of a one-year sentence imposed by a lower court.
   Lee, a leader of South Korea's largest dissident group, the
United National Democratic Movement, was arrested in April 1989 on
charges of organizing illegal anti-government rallies.

<HEAD>Former HUD Official Refuses to Testify</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Updates throughout with Hamernick taking 5th, Crawford saying
OMB shares in responsibility for HUD scandal; no pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former HUD official invoked his
constitutional rights and refused to testify before a House panel
today as it reopened its investigation into alleged widespread
abuses in federal housing programs.
   James Hamernick, former director of the office of insured
multifamily housing, became the fifth former official of the
Department of Housing and Urban Development to refuse to testify
before congressional investigators.
   Hamernick cited Fifth Amendment protections against
self-incrimination in refusing to testify.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, chairman of the House Government Operations
subcommittee on housing, said he had decided to resume a HUD probe
despite Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's decision Thursday to
seek appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate former
Secretary Sam Pierce and other former top housing officials. That
appointment by a federal court is now automatic under the law.
   Pierce is among the other former officials from the Reagan
administration who have refused to testify.
   ``As has happened in the past, most notably in the Watergate
investigation ... and the Iran-Contra investigation ... there is
occasionally a compelling need for simultaneous parallel
investigations by Congress and by law enforcement,'' Lantos said,
explaining his decision to proceed further after holding more than
20 hearings last year.
   ``The subcommittee is duty-bound to proceed with its
investigation of abuses at HUD,'' he said. ``This is particularly
true since in recent weeks the subcommittee staff has uncovered a
good deal of relevant new information.''
   He declined to say what that information was.
   Hamernick refused to answer when Lantos asked him what HUD
programs he discussed when he was entertained by Lance Wilson, a
former top aid to Pierce who later became a housing consultant with
the Wall Street firm of Paine Webber. Wilson reported spending more
than $2,000 in that job on meals and other entertainment for
Hamernick in expense accounts filed with his employer.
   Hamernick invoked a House rule allowing subpoenaed witnesses to
ban cameras and recording equipment from his appearance.
   The subcommittee questioned Carol Crawford, former associate
director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Reagan
administration, who acknowledged that OMB shared some
responsibility for what Lantos said was gross mismanagement at HUD
during those years.
   ``I would say we have to accept a certain amount of
responsibility,'' she said.
   Lantos said he had postponed the scheduled appearance of one
principle witness, former HUD assistant secretary for housing
Thomas Demery, who first appeared before the panel in May 1989.
   Demery's attorney, Jerris Leonard, said he was told over the
weekend that Lantos decided he ``wanted to discuss with the
independent counsel the question of whether or not Mr. Demery
should appear because he is at least a witness into the
investigation of Mr. Pierce's activities.''
   Stuart Weisberg, the panel's chief counsel, said Demery would
have been questioned about Pierce. He said Lantos postponed
Demery's testimony until an independent counsel is named and they
can discuss Demery's appearance.
   Lantos said new information caused him to change his mind since
last fall, when he told reporters it was time to turn the case over
to the courts and end the congressional probe of alleged fraud,
mismanagement and influence-peddling at HUD during the Reagan years.
   Lantos said he was pleased with Thornburgh's application for a
special counsel but ``I disagree with him on the scope'' of the
counsel's investigation.
   Congressional investigators are interested in Pierce's assertion
at a voluntary appearance last spring that he took no direct role
in contract awards, a point disputed in subsequent testimony by
other former HUD officials.
   Additional witnesses, including HUD inspector general Paul
Adams, are set to appear before the panel on Tuesday, and Lantos
said ``a number of additional hearings'' were being scheduled.
   Thornburgh sought an investigation of Pierce and others in the
awarding of grants under HUD's section 8 moderate rehabilitation
program, which provided subsidies for developers to do moderate
amounts of renovation to housing for low-income people.

<HEAD>Mother Says Covenant House Apparently Used Dead Son's ID</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Covenant House runaway shelter apparently
used the birth and baptismal certificates of a child who died at
age 10 to provide a new identity for a former male prostitute, the
child's mother said today.
   Betty Anne Warner said by phone from her home in Jamestown,
N.Y., that she and her husband knew nothing of the alleged use of
their son's identity until they learned of it from a reporter last
week. They since have been interviewed by a New York City
prosecutor, she said.
   ``When I first heard it, I thought it was a joke,'' Ms. Warner
said. ``I thought, oh golly, what's happening in this cruel world?''
   The Warners' son, Timothy, died of leukemia in 1980 at age 10.
The Rev. Bruce Ritter, Covenant House's founder, has said he gave
the name Timothy Warner to Kevin Kite, a former male prostitute, to
protect him from enemies.
   Kite alleged in December that Ritter gave him money, housing and
gifts in trade for sex, and Manhattan prosecutors have said they
are investigating Covenant House finances. Ritter has denied Kite's
charges and Kite's father has described him as an emotionally
troubled liar.
   The New York Post, reporting on the Warners in today's edition,
noted that Ritter said in a December newspaper column that he gave
Kite ``the name of Timothy Warner on a new birth certificate so
that he could get his life started again.''
   Moreover, Kite has said that Covenant House officials gave him
birth and baptismal certificates in Timothy Warner's name, and told
him Warner was a child from Jamestown who died of cancer at age 10,
the Post reported. Jamestown is about 300 miles northwest of New
York City.
   It was unclear how Covenant House may have obtained Timothy
Warner's birth and baptism records. Mrs. Warner said she has the
originals.
   Stanley Arkin, Ritter's lawyer, said he did not know if Timothy
Warner's records were used, but maintained that it is legal to use
such records so long as they are not used for illegal purposes.
   While Ritter has acknowledged providing Kite with the name of
Timothy Warner, ``I don't know that Father Ritter has any knowledge
where that name came from or anything like that,'' Arkin said.
   Mrs. Warner said she and her husband, Terry, learned of the
matter in a call from a New York Times reporter. They called an FBI
agent and discussed it with him, then were called by a Manhattan
assistant district attorney last week, she said.
   Gerald McKelvey, spokesman for the Manhattan prosecutors'
office, declined to comment in the case. Covenant House's spokesman
did not return a call.
   ``I am mad to think that somebody got a hold of these two
documents and did use them,'' Mrs. Warner said in a telephone
interview. ``The poor kid's dead. He suffered so. I wish he was
still here. And here's somebody going around using his name. I
don't think it's fair.''

<TEXT>
   The trial of U.S. District Judge Robert
Aguilar, charged with using his office to do favors for convicted
felons, began today after a ruling that allows the prosecution to
use wiretape evidence.
   Prosecutors are relying heavily on court-approved wiretaps from
late 1987 and early 1988 to provide evidence that Aguilar tried to
influence the outcomes of cases by approaching two fellow judges
and assisting in criminal appeals.
   In today's ruling just before jury selection began, U.S.
District Judge Louis Bechtle said wiretaps on Aguilar's
co-defendants in September and October 1987 were valid. Those taps
were the basis for court-approved monitoring of Aguilar's
telephones beginning in January 1988.
   Besides the wiretap ruling, Bechtle denied motions by Aguilar's
co-defendants for separate trials.
   Aguilar, 58, is charged with eight felonies, including the first
racketeering charge against a federal judge. He faces up to 55
years in prison if convicted.
   His co-defendants are Rudy Tham, 66, a former Teamster leader
and convicted embezzler, and Abe Chapman, 83, a self-styled former
mobster who is related to Aguilar by marriage.
   Aguilar, a 1980 appointee of President Carter, is the fourth
federal judge indicted during the last decade. Harry Claiborne of
Nevada, Alcee Hastings of Florida and Walter Nixon of Mississippi
were all later impeached and removed from office by Congress,
although Hastings was acquitted of the criminal charge against him.
   None of the charges in a June grand jury indictment against
Aguilar relate to cases in his court.
   He is accused of obstructing justice by trying to use his office
to benefit friends and acquaintances.
   Other allegations say he approached two other federal judges to
seek favorable treatment for Tham and Ronald Cloud, a former
Aguilar law client who was convicted of bank fraud; of trying to
help Tham get a new trial while Tham arranged a job for Aguilar's
brother; and of tipping Chapman that his phone was being tapped.
   Aguilar also is accused of helping his former secretary, Vera
Hoff, remain a fugitive in Mexico, where she fled after being
convicted of tax evasion. The judge is additionally charged with
lying to the FBI and advising one of Tham's lawyers to lie to the
grand jury.
   Several of the accusations are combined in a charge that Aguilar
used his office as a ``racketeering enterprise'' _ in the words of
one prosecution brief, that he ``infiltrated'' the court and
``perverted its functioning to the benefit of criminal elements.''
   Defense lawyers have suggested that Aguilar had made some
mistakes in judgment out of loyalty, but have said the government's
motives are political.
   Before Bechtle imposed a gag order in the case, Aguilar's
lawyers repeatedly called the charges political _ ``an attempt to
wipe out a frequent, vocal opponent of the conservative doctrines
of the Reagan and Bush administrations,'' as attorney Patrick
Hallinan put it.
   Since his appointment, Aguilar has curbed immigration raids on
factories and restricted aerial surveillance of marijuana fields
and prohibited the government from blocking a homosexual's entrance
into the country.
   One of 11 children of poor Mexican immigrants, Aguilar worked
his way through college and law school, and practiced law in San
Jose for 19 years before then-Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. appointed him
to the Superior Court in 1979. After his federal appointment the
next year, one of his first acts was to swear in his father as a
U.S. citizen.

   The Bush administration said today a massive
rally in Moscow demanding that the Communist party surrender some
powers was ``a measure of the new oppenness in the Soviet system.''
   With Secretary of State James A. Baker III due in the Soviet
capital for talks beginning Wednesday night, the administration
refrained from assessing prospects for change in the Communist
Party, which is holding its Central Committee meting.
   But Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman,
praised the demonstration Sunday that drew some 100,000 people to
the Kremlin walls to demand that the party surrender its monopoly
of power over the life of the nation.
   ``Yesterday marked the largest demonstration in Soviet
history,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``It is a measure of the new openness
in the Soviet system that Soviet people felt free enough to march
for the rights for greater political participation in the political
process.''
   Her statement added: ``Our dream for all people, including the
Soviet people, is political pluralism and free market economies.''
   As for the party proceedings specifically, Ms. Tutwiler said at
this point there was only speculation, which she did not discuss.
   Baker was due to leave tonight for Czechoslovakia for a 27-hour
visit that will include a meeting with President Vaclav Havel and a
foreign policy speech endorsing a 35-nation summit meeting next
year to ease tensions in Europe.
   He will hold talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze in Moscow Wednesday evening through Saturday, when
Baker also is scheduled to make an unprecedented appearance before
the International Affairs Committee of the Soviet parliament.
   Baker will meet with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday.
   In testifying last week before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, Baker endorsed ``the reformers'' in Eastern Europe and
said he would offer technical cooperation and trade benefits to the
Soviets if their human rights record continued to show improvement.
   But he also stressed the issue was not ``whether or not
President Gorbachev will or will not succeed.'' Baker said, ``the
issue ought to be whether or not we can take advantage of the fact
that he is there now reforming things and ... lock in agreements
that are mutually advantageous, that are good from the standpoint
of the United States.''

<TEXT>
   The pips and peeps of BBC radio became a shade
more precise Monday after the corporation moved its timekeeping
operations from the countryside to its London headquarters.
   Not that radio listeners were likely to notice; the difference
is that inaccuracies will be only one 1,000th of a second instead
of five 1,000ths, the BBC said.
   BBC newscasts, recognizable worldwide by their hourly ``pip pip
pip pip pip peep,'' have been getting the time from the Royal
Greenwich Observatory since 1924.
   But that service ended with Monday's 1 p.m. (8 a.m. EST) time
signal, and the BBC's own equipment, installed in a basement at its
London headquarters, took over.
   The BBC started broadcasting its time checks 66 years ago,
relying on data from the original observatory in the London suburb
of Greenwich.
   In 1957, the observatory moved to Herstmonceux, south of London,
and started using atomic clocks. But even these could not prevent
occasional inaccuracies as the signal traveled from Herstmonceux to
London.
   Now that the pips come directly from the BBC, the time should be
accurate to within one 1,000th of a second, said Simon Shute,
engineering manager at BBC radio.

<HEAD>Dentist Cleared of Sex Attacks; Judge Cites `Fantasy' Theory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dentist was acquitted Monday of
indecently assaulting seven women patients after a judge ruled that
a sedative administered to them could have caused sexual fantasies.
   Neil Larah, 32, was accused of fondling six of the women in his
office and sexually assaulting another after following her home.
   But the judge, Sir Derek Hodgson, ordered the jury to acquit him
after hearing evidence from a leading anesthetist, Thomas Healey of
Manchester University, that the sedative Valium, injected as a
relaxant, could have caused the women to believe in ``unreal
experiences.''
   The judge said he did not doubt the women were telling what they
believed to be the truth.
   ``The danger is not that they are lying or exaggerating, but
that they are mistaken ... that their recollection, honestly
believed in, is of an unreal and not a real experience,'' he said.
   ``It is also clear there is a mounting body of evidence that
patients under sedation from this class of drugs do sometimes
experience sexual or erotic fantasies,'' he said.
   The Lancet, a respected British medical weekly, reported last
month on research suggesting some drugs administered by dentists
could induce sexual fantasies.

<HEAD>Research Finds Teenage Girls Having Sex Sooner</HEAD>

   America's teen-age girls seem to be having sex
sooner, according to early reports from a federal survey of
childbearing and sexual practices.
   A 1988 survey of young women 15 to 19 found that 54 percent had
had intercourse at least once, according to researchers with the
National Center for Health Statistics. That compares to 47 percent
in a similar survey in 1982.
   ``A larger percentage of teen-agers (are) initiating sexual
intercourse at younger ages than in 1982,'' the Atlanta-based
Centers for Disease Control said in its report this week,
commenting on the NCHS research.
   ``That's a fair conclusion to draw from this,'' said Dr. William
Pratt, chief of the NCHS' Family Growth Survey Branch in
Hyattsville, Md. ``We're quite sure it's real.''
   And while sexual activity was somewhat more widespread among
young black women than their white counterparts, the increase from
1982 to 1988 apparently was fueled by increased sexual activity
among whites.
   For example, among 15-year-olds, 18 percent of whites had had
sex in the 1982 survey, rising to 29 percent in 1988, Pratt said.
Among blacks, the results actually fell slightly, from 28 percent
to 26.
   For 16-year-olds, the results rose from 29 percent to 32 among
whites, while the percentage for blacks rose from 42 to 46.
   For whites at 17, the percentage rose from 40 to 46; for blacks,
the jump was from 55 to 69.
   For whites at 18, the increase was from 55 percent to 67; for
blacks, the percentage fell from 77 to 69.
   And for 19-year-olds, the results rose from 69 percent to 81
among whites, while the percentage for blacks dropped slightly,
from 82 percent to 81.
   Those year-by-year findings may be skewed by ``sampling
variability,'' Pratt said; the smaller survey samples are more
prone to statistical quirks.
   Small jumps in the white population have more influence on the
total because of the greater number of whites. Racial breakdowns on
the total survey are not yet available.
   Still, Pratt said, the pattern is clear.
   ``All that change was due to ... the changing behavior of white
teen-agers,'' he said. ``Black teens were, statistically speaking,
unchanged.''
   The NCHS' Family Growth Survey questioned 8,450 young women,
representing a national sample. Interviews were conducted
one-on-one in the participants' homes. NCHS plans further reports
on the findings.

<TEXT>
   The terrorist attack in Egypt that killed nine
Israeli tourists is an ``outrageous act'' designed to halt efforts
toward reconciliation and dialogue between Arabs and Israelis, the
State Department said Monday.
   President Bush called Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to
express his sorrow and Secretary of State James A. Baker III
relayed a similar message in calls to the Israeli and Egyptian
foreign ministers, department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.
   ``This outrageous act of terrorism is to be condemned by
civilized people everywhere,'' she said. ``Our sympathy goes out to
the family and friends of all those killed and injured in this
tragic incident.''
   She added:
   ``Whoever did this is an enemy of peace. This is an obvious
attempt to halt efforts at reconciliation and dialogue. It points
out the need for all people to rededicate themselves to the pursuit
of peace and not allow the perpetrators of such outrages to
triumph.''
   Of the 31 Israelis aboard the bus, at least nine were killed and
20 were wounded. The bus was attacked near the Suez Canal town of
Ismailiya, 40 miles from the capital.

<HEAD>Indian Border Guards Open Fire on Protesters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indian border guards opened fire on
Pakistani protesters who swarmed into Indian territory in the
northern state of Jammu-Kashmir on Monday, officials said.
   At least 10 people were believed injured in the shooting, the
government's chief spokesman said; Pakistani officials said one
protester was killed and 13 others were shot in the legs.
   The episode occurred near Ranbirsinghpura in Jammu region, 310
miles north of New Delhi, said the spokesman, who cannot be
identified under briefing rules.
   The demonstrators who shouted anti-India slogans were protesting
a recent Indian government crackdown on Moslem separatists in the
Kashmir region of Jammu-Kashmir, said a Pakistani police official
in Sialkot, about three miles from the border.
   The Indian spokesman said about 4,000 demonstrators gathered on
the Pakistani side and tried to cross the border. ``Despite efforts
by the Pakistani rangers, some people crossed over and the Indian
security forces had to fire to control the situation.'' He said
without elaborating.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Pakistan's top diplomat in
India, Rashid Babar, was summoned to the Foreign Office and was
told of India's ``concern and deep regret'' at the ``unprovoked
incident.''
   The Pakistan government did not immediately react to the
incident.
   In Jammu, a senior official of the Indian Border Security Force,
which guards the area, said the trouble started around noon when
about 500 people gathered near the border and shouted ``provocative
slogans.''
   He said the commander of the Border Security Force outpost then
called Pakistani officers into the Indian territory to discuss the
situation, following which the Pakistani forces dispersed the crowd.
   But the crowd regrouped and despite the Pakistani guards, many
swarmed across the border, he said. Pakistan's official TV said
there were about 30,000 demonstrators.
   The intrusion was an apparent fallout of a strike Monday in
major Pakistani cities to support the Kashmiri secession. At least
76 people have been killed in Kashmir since Jan. 20 in clashes
between curfew-breaking protesters and security forces.
   India accuses Pakistan of aiding the militants with a view to
annexing Kashmir, a predominantly Moslem region claimed by
Pakistan. The charge is routinely denied, but Pakistan says it
supports the separatism, calling it a movement for
self-determination.
   Jammu-Kashmir is part of a larger Kashmir that was divided into
Indian and Pakistani territories after a war in 1948. A United
Nations monitored cease-fire line separates the smaller slice of
Pakistan Kashmir from the Indian state. Another war in 1965 over
the territory has not changed the situation.
   India and Pakistan were formed by the division on religous lines
of the Indian subcontinent when it gained independence from Britain
in 1947. Pakistan claimed Jammu-Kashmir because of its dominant
Moslem population.
   About 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 5 million people are Moslem,
making it the only Moslem dominated state among predominantly Hindu
India's 25 states.

   They're going into churches and schools.
They're advertising in foreign languages and dialects. They've
hired professional athletes in Chicago and a former gang member in
Los Angeles. The Census Bureau is going all out to count you.
   Census Day is April 1, the day every 10 years when the
government takes a snapshot of the American public.
   To make sure everyone is included in the picture, no fewer than
five advertising agencies and businesses across the country have
been enlisted to spread the word. Serving as publicity
``ambassadors'' will be the 50 state titleholders from the Miss
American pageant.
   ``Participation is one of the most important activities each one
of us can do as citizens,'' said Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher, who joined Miss America Debbye Turner in completing
sample census forms at a news conference Monday.
   Mosbacher said a good turnout also saves the government some
money.
   More than 100 million census forms will be mailed March 23, with
a request that they be completed and sent back after April 1.
People who don't return their forms will be contacted personally.
   Mosbacher estimated that every 1 percent increase in mail
responses saves the government $10 million.
   Reaching some Americans is no easy task, however, and special
efforts are being made to track them down.
   Brenda August, a census field coordinator in Los Angeles, said a
former gang member has been hired to work with census enumerators
to try to ease distrust of government officials in gang territories.
   Census workers won't be accompanied by police, but will receive
safety training, travel in groups and wear special vests to
identify themselves, she said.
   Widely known athletes, including members of the White Sox
baseball team, will be used to count people in Chicago, said
regional census director Stan Moore. Enumerators are being hired
from among residents of public housing projects.
   Census volunteers will go into local churches and schools to
promote participation, officials said.
   The Ad Council, a public service arm of the advertising
industry, will conduct a national publicity campaign. Ads will
appear on the Goodyear blimp and be mailed by J.C. Penney and
Sears, Roebuck and Co. Space will be set aside in many 7-Eleven
stores for census workers to answer customers' questions.
   The ad campaign's theme is ``Answer the Census: It Counts For
More Than You Think.'' Ads will stress the importance of census
data in determining the location of new public facilities,
apportioning state legislatures and allocating federal funds to
localities.
   Special advertising appeals will be aimed at blacks, Hispanics,
Asians, American Indians and native Alaskans. The Asian ads,
available in English, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese and Japanese,
feature an abacus with the theme, ``Any Way We Add It _ It Makes
Good Sense to Answer the Census.''
   A big selling point in the Hispanic ads, which will be published
in Mexican, Cuban and Puerto Rican dialects as well as English, is
that census answers are confidential.
   Census Director Barbara E. Bryant said records are kept secret
for 72 years and information about individuals is not given to any
government or private group.

   The State Department urged the Angolan
government Monday to halt its military offensive against
U.S.-backed rebel forces and open negotiations on ending the
conflict.
   The military attempts to crush the UNITA rebels ``are futile and
make it increasingly difficult to reach the negotiated settlement
necessary to conclude this tragic conflict,'' said department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   She reaffirmed Washington's willingness to assist the warring
factions and the chief outside mediator, Zaire President Mobutu
Sese Seko, in a search for peace.
   The heaviest fighting has been around the rebel-held town of
Mavinga, where Ms. Tutwiler said government air strikes are
continuing.
   The leftist government's main foreign supporter is the Soviet
Union.

   A man killed his two adult sons and a
girlfriend of one of them and stabbed his wife before taking his
own life this morning as police attempted to negotiate with him by
telephone, police said.
   Lt. Steve Rathbun of the Will County sheriff's office identified
the gunman as James W. Breen, 47. His victims were identified as
his sons James M. Breen, 27, and Eric T. Breen, 20, and a
girlfriend of Eric's, Victoria Pasinski, 18, of Lockport.
   Breen's wife, Virginia, 48, was taken to a hospital for
treatment of stab wounds.
   ``At 2:50 this morning we received a call of a domestic
disturbance'' in the Phelan Acres subdivision in Wilmington
Township, about 15 miles south of Joliet, Rathbun said.
   When police arrived, he said, they found a wounded woman who
told them the gunman had already shot some people and was still in
the house.
   Another spokesman for the sheriff's department, who asked not to
be identified, said the elder Breen talked on and off with police
negotiators by telephone until about 5:30 a.m., when the negotiator
reported hearing what sounded like a gunshot.
   Police entered the house at 6:05 a.m. and found the gunman and
three other bodies, the spokesman said.
   The elder Breen was found lying in the bathroom, a gun and a
portable telephone next to him, the spokesman said.
   Two other bodies were found in a bedroom, and a fourth in the
living room of the one-story frame house, the spokesman said.
   It was not immediately clear how the victims died but it
appeared they had died at least two hours before Breen killed
himself, the spokesman said.
   ``With the amount of blood around, there must have been some
kind of struggle,'' he said.
   Mrs. Breen was taken to St. Joseph's Medical Center in Joliet,
Rathbun said. Hospital spokeswoman Jean Slater said the victim was
in stable condition. She declined to release additional information.
   Rathbun said the elder Breen ``had some contact with police in
last few weeks,'' but he backed away from an earlier statement that
the man had been treated for psychiatric problems in the past,
saying police were unsure about it.
   Joliet is about 40 miles southwest of Chicago.

   A new commission has been asked to figure out what

   Martinez said he has no information that change is imminent, but
he believes the state should be ready in case Fidel Castro, in
power since 1959, follows other Communist leaders out of power.
   ``It's pretty hard to believe that he can continue to get
support from a system that no longer exists,'' Martinez said,
referring to the reforms in the Socialist bloc countries that have
helped sustain Cuba's struggling economy.
   The governor added that it would be ``bad planning'' for Florida
not to prepare for Cuba after Communism.
   There are an estimated 700,000 Cubans in the Miami area.
   The 14-member commission will be chaired by Jorge Mas Canosa, a
prominent Cuban-American businessman and leader of the influential
Cuban American National Foundation lobbying group.

   A man accused of conspiring to destroy power
lines leading to nuclear facilities in three states has decided to
change his innocent plea, federal officials said Monday.
   A change-of-plea hearing for Mark Baker, 37, of Prescott, has
been scheduled for Tuesday before U.S. District Judge Robert C.
Broomfield, a court clerk said.
   Steve Mitchell, an assistant U.S. attorney, declined to say
whether Baker had entered into a plea agreement.
   Court records indicate Broomfield vacated a
suppression-of-evidence motion that had been scheduled for hearing
Monday.
   Baker is one of four defendants in the case, all of whom are
members of Earth First!, a radical environmental organization
founded by co-defendant David Foreman, 42, of Tucson.
   Baker, Foreman, Mark Davis, 39, of Prescott, and Margaret
Millett, 35, also of Prescott, face counts of conspiracy to
sabotage federal facilities. The alleged targets were the Palo
Verde and Diablo Canyon nuclear powerplants in Arizona and
California, respectively, and the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant
near Denver.

<TEXT>
   On the eve of his 79th birthday and a year
after leaving the White House, former President Ronald Reagan says
the Cold War isn't over despite events in Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union.
   In an exclusive interview Friday, Reagan focused on such topics
as the American hostages in Lebanon, Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev and his private life in his beloved California.
   He declined to discuss aspects of the Iran-Contra scandal other
than his concern for the hostages, citing pending litigation.
   ``I think we see something on the horizon,'' Reagan said when
asked if the Cold War was over. ``But we also have to remember this
is the work of a man who can be dismissed by the Communist Party if
they see their way clear to do it.
   ``We have to know that permanent changes have been made before
we can say everything is in the clear and the Cold War is over. ...
But we have to make sure that the deeds are permanent.''
   Nevertheless, Reagan said the choice of Gorbachev as Time
magazine's ``Man of the Decade'' was appropriate. Some
conservatives have argued that Reagan should have been chosen.
   ``As a matter of fact, I have to think anything that will help
Gorbachev succeed in the changes he's trying to make in the Soviet
Union then, well, fine,'' Reagan said. He added that he has always
expected internal opposition to Gorbachev.
   ``I knew his opposition wouldn't come from the people, it would
come from that fixed bureaucracy,'' he said, adding, ``As I
describe it, the Russian Revolution simply wiped out an inherited
aristocracy and has replaced it with an inherited bureaucracy.''
   Reagan, who celebrates his birthday on Tuesday, began the
interview by pointing to the Pacific Ocean and Channel Islands
visible from his 34th-floor office in Century City, a high-rise
business district. He marveled at the view.
   ``I've always said that a Californian who is forced to live away
from California lives in a state of perpetual homesickness,'' he
said, adding, ``It isn't a place, it's a way of life.''
   Age hasn't diminished Reagan's love of a self-deprecating joke.
   ``I prefer to think of it as the 40th anniversary of my 39th
birthday,'' Reagan quipped.
   Reagan keeps in shape by pumping iron daily in his basement gym
and trimming trees with a chain saw during his monthly visits to
his Santa Barbara County ranch.
   He also remains active on the ``mashed potato'' speaking
circuit, delivering speeches on issues he cares about, such as a
balanced budget amendment and line-item veto power for the
president in dealing with budget issues.
   Reagan's hair has grown back _ still black but with a more
pronounced touch of gray _ since brain surgery last year following
a throw from a horse in Mexico. He's riding again on his trips to
the ranch.
   The former president proudly reported that he and wife Nancy now
own the $2.5 million home in the exclusive Bel-Air community that
was first purchased by friends for the couple's return to
California.
   ``It's ours and we enjoy it very much. We are very fond of it,''
Reagan said. There was a twinkle in his blue eyes as he told of the
first time he saw the house _ from the floor of a sedan _ while he
was still president.
   ``If I went any place the press would have been in attendance
and we didn't want that publicity at the time,'' he said. It was
Mrs. Reagan who persuaded him to sneak up to the house.
   ``She said if I was willing to get down on the floor of the car
and go there the press wouldn't be following or any photographers
or anything, so I did. I didn't get up until we were in the
driveway,'' Reagan said.

Hazelwood sat in a bar drinking vodka, a prosecutor told the
Superior Court jury today in his opening statement.
   Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole maintained that Hazelwood
was noticeably intoxicated when he returned to his ship after a day
ashore in Valdez.
   He also maintained it was the captain's sole responsibility to
ensure that the tanker arrived safely at its destination.
   ``This catastrophe represents the largest U.S. oil spill,'' Cole
told the jurors who listened attentively to his outline of the case
he would present against Hazelwood. ``It left in its wake a path of
destruction and death. It removed a part of Prince William Sound
that will never be replaced.''
   As Hazelwood sat a few feet away stroking his beard, Cole
directed blame at the captain.
   ``Joseph Hazelwood, the captain of the Exxon Valdez, was in
charge and responsible for that tanker's safety,'' he said. ``He
was in charge and responsible for the tanker's cargo.''
   ``Because of circumstances surrounding his failure to perform
his responsiblity on that evening, he has been charged with four
crimes,'' the prosecutor said.
   The swearing-in of jurors today and beginning of opening
statements came nearly a year after the tanker ran aground and
spilled about 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil into
Prince William Sound.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone warned jurors that the
Hazelwood case is of interest to many people and will atrract wide
media coverage. He instructed them to ignore reports on the case
and told them ``it's important you decide this case solely on what
you see and hear in this courtroom and not on anything you hear
outside.''
   Johnstone instructed the jurors briefly in the rules of
evidence, telling them they would be the sole judges of the
credibility of witnesses who come forward to describe the
disastrous accident and the events that followed.
   Hazelwood's attorney, Dick Madson, lost a bid to bar the
prosecution from mentioning Hazelwood's blood-alcohol level in
opening statements. He contended it might not be admissible
evidence and should not be mentioned now. But the judge said it was
likely to be the subject of testimony and give the prosecution the
go-ahead.
   The captain's blood alcohol reading 10{ hours after the accident
was .061, which Madson said was below state limits but above Coast
Guard limits for operating a vessel.
   The jurors, 12 regular members and three alternates, were
selected last week from among more than 60 candidates who were
screened through questions about exposure to pretrial publicity and
other factors that could lead to bias in the trial.
   Hazelwood was not on the bridge of the 987-foot tanker when it
struck Bligh Reef. Part of the defense involves his contention that
he left sound orders for crew members and cannot be held criminally
responsible for the way they did their jobs.
   The Exxon Valdez was under the control of Third Mate Gregory
Cousins when it ran aground early the morning of March 24 after
leaving designated shipping lanes.
   Cousins is among more than 100 potential witnesses in
Hazelwood's trial on a felony charge of criminal mischief and on
misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment, negligent discharge
of oil and operating a vessel while intoxicated.
   If convicted of all charges, Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y.,
would face up to seven years, three months in prison and $61,000 in
fines.
   Preparations for the trial took months. Originally scheduled for
Valdez, the port from which the tanker sailed on March 24 with its
cargo of California-bound oil, the trial was moved to Anchorage in
an effort to obtain an impartial jury.

<TEXT>
   President Bush cautioned an international
gathering of scientists today against seeking solutions to global
warming that would burden major industries.
   In a speech one environmentalist called a ``gross
disappointment,'' Bush said he is convening a meeting at the White
House this spring of top environmentalists, economists and
ecologists to grapple with the issue.
   He promised U.S. support for ``aggressive and thoughtful
action'' to solve problems caused by global warming. But he sounded
a note of caution against scientists and environmentalists who
believe the warming of the Earth's atmosphere is already serious
enough to warrant severe anti-pollution controls.
   ``Wherever possible we believe that market mechanism should be
applied and that our policies must be consistent with economic
growth and free market principles in all countries,'' Bush said in
his address before the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a
United Nations-sponsored group opening a three-day meeting at
Georgetown University.
   Environmentalists from the United States and Europe were quick
to criticize Bush for not making a clear commitment for immediate
action aimed at dealing with global warming.
   ``It was a gross disappointment. There was more talk in the
speech about economics than about the environment,'' said Daniel
Becker of the Sierra Club.
   Stewart Boyle of the Association for the Conservation of Energy
in Great Britain said Bush's remarks demonstrated ``a leadership
crisis'' on the global warming issue at the White House. ``About
the only thing we can say about it is he turned up'' at the
conference, said Boyle.
   The cross-section of environmentalists are attending the
conference as observers. They said they would have liked to have
seen Bush present specific U.S. commitments toward energy
conservation and specific goals on reductions in carbon dioxide
pollution, which is the major contributor to global warming.
   Global warming is the gradual increase in the Earth's
temperature due to buildup of heat-trapping gases emitted into the
atmosphere by burning oil and gas.
   In his speech, Bush said, ``We all know that human activities
are changing the atmosphere in unexpected and in unprecedented
ways.''
   He said ``some may be tempted to exploit legitimate concerns for
political positioning.''
   ``Where politics and opinion have outpaced the science, we are
accelerating our support of the technology to bridge that gap,''
Bush said.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu reportedly ordered
changes in the text to mute U.S. concerns about global warming.
Sununu acknowledged Sunday he made some changes, but said they were
simply to make the speech ``reflective'' of administration policy.
   Sununu also criticized ``faceless'' environmental bureaucrats he
said want to force Americans to give up their cars.
   ``If we hope to promote environmental protection and growth
around the world it will be important not to work in conflict, but
with our industrial sectors,'' Bush told the scientists.
   ``You're called upon to deliver recommendations which strike a
difficult and yet critical international bargain, a convergence
between global environmental policies and global economic policies,
a bargain where both perspectives benefit and neither is
compromised,'' Bush told the scientists.
   The speech drew restrained applause from several hundred
delegates.
   ``There was no step forward in his speech,'' remarked Brooks
Yeager of the National Audubon Society.
   Later, at the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater asserted scientists disagree on the issue of global
warming and ``the people who think this is a problem that needs to
be solved today don't understand it. They're wrong.''
   Fitzwater was asked if Bush had changed his position since the
1988 presidential campaign.
   During the campaign, Bush said he would convene a global
conference on the environment in his first year in office on global
warming and other environmental problems, and that it was time to
act on these problems.
   ``If that's true, then he has changed his view. I don't know if
he said those words during the campaign, but if so, he's changed
his mind,'' Fitzwater said.
   In a major speech on enviornmental policy in Michigan on Aug.
31, 1988, Bush said that ``those who think we're powerless to do
anything about the `greenhouse effect' are forgetting abvout the
`White House effect.' As president, I intend to do something about
it.''
   Bush also greeted the president-elect of Uruguay, Luis Alberto
Lacalle. He also met with a delegation of 24 U.S. Jewish leaders,
who urged him to prod Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to
speak out against rising anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union.
   Sununu, speaking on ABC's ``This Week with David Brinkley,''
said Sunday the speech would focus ``on our commitment to deal with
the international environmental issues in such a way that we don't
end up not being able to use our coal, oil and natural gas
resources.''
   ``There's a little tendency by some of the faceless bureaucrats
on the environmental side to try to create a policy in this country
that cuts off our use of coal, oil and natural gas,'' said Sununu,
a nuclear engineer by training.
   ``I don't think that's what this country wants. I don't think
America wants not to be able to use their automobiles,'' said the
former governor of New Hampshire, who has clashed with
Environmental Protection Agency head William K. Reilly on this and
other issues.
   White House officials said the president is seeking to
underscore environmental steps he is taking, including:
   _A proposal to spend $1 billion in fiscal year 1991, an increase
of 57 percent, for global change research.
   _Plans to spend $175 million to plant 1 billion trees annually
for a decade.
   _Major revisions in the Clean Air Act to attack smog and other
pollution, still pending in Congress.

   A federal judge today ordered former President
Reagan to give a videotaped deposition in the Iran-Contra trial of
John Poindexter and renewed his ruling that Reagan must immediately
turn over 33 diary entries to his former national security adviser.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene gave Reagan and

   Two Bush administration energy nominees
breezed through Senate confirmation hearings Monday although one is
under heavy attack from Nevada's two senators over the choice of
their state to host a nuclear waste dump.
   The Senate Energy Committee's chairman, Sen. J. Bennett
Johnston, D-La., used the occasion to declare he will not allow
Nevada to ``defeat politically'' Congress' choice three years ago
of Yucca Mountain as the site for an underground high-level
radioactive waste repository.
   Nevade senators Harry Reid and Richard H. Bryan, both Democrats,
want President Bush to withdraw his nomination of John W. Bartlett,
a chemical and nuclear engineer, to head the program after the
Energy Department sued the state last month over its denial of
environmental permits to study the site.
   However, Bartlett, a former nuclear waste specialist at Battelle
Pacific Northwest Laboratories in Richland, Wash., received nothing
but support Monday from Johnston and the committee's ranking
Republican, Sen. James McClure of Idaho.
   ``The attitude of some people in the past has been to take the
path of least resistance ... to let the program drift,'' said
Johnston. ``I would hope Nevade would recognize that ... it is a
scientific challenge ... and one that cannot be defeated on a
political basis.''
   Bartlett came under attack from Reid and Bryan after writing a
technical paper last year asserting that scientific research alone
cannot provide the proof that Yucca Mountain will be an absolutely
safe geological barrier around the radioactive wastes for 10,000
years.
   ``I do not apologize for that,'' Bartlett said Monday. ``In the
face of imperfect information, it's a very common situation that
rules are developed using good information and sound judgment.''
   Reid has accused Bartlett of wanting ``to rush full speed ahead
on the nuke dump regardless of the scientific consequences.''
   Johnston, however, complained Monday that the Energy Department
is moving too slowly, citing a decision in November to delay until
1993 the drilling of a 1,200-foot test shaft at the site and to
postpone from the year 2003 to 2010 that target date for completing
and opening the dump.
   ``We're spending hundreds of millions of dollars year after year
and there's not even a shaft ..., just paper studies,'' he said.
``Some people claim that's bureaucracy at its best. I think it's a
waste. At the rate we're going it will be the 22nd Century before
we get it done.''
   The committee spent only 20 minutes questioning Robert H.
Gentile, a former Ohio coal operator, to head the Energy
Department's fossil fuels program.
   Gentile, who headed the Interior Department's Office of Surface
Mining in the last year of the Reagan administration and is a
champion of a $6 billion government-industry program for developing
clean-coal technologies, was Bush's second choice for the job.
   Coal state lawmakers, led by Senate Appropriations Committee
Chairman Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., had objected to the nomination of
Michael McElwrath, a friend of Bush with a background in the oil
and gas business, for the post.
   Both nominations could be voted on by the committee as early as
Thursday.

   Congress was asked Monday to approve a $1.7
million spending increase for the Supreme Court for the next fiscal
year, which would bring the court's annual budget to $19.2 million.
   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia made the request
to a House appropriations subcommittee.
   O'Connor said most of the proposed increase is for higher pay
and benefits for the justices and the court's staff.
   The court is not adding any staff or new programs, she said.
   As of Feb. 1, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's annual pay
was increased $9,000 to $124,000. The salary for the eight
associate justices rose $8,600 to $118,600.
   Next Jan. 1, Rehnquist's salary will be raised to $155,000, and
the associate justices will be paid $148,300.
   The court's budget request includes $100,000 to begin upgrading
computers.

<HEAD>China Buys More Subsidized Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has bought an additional 299,150 metric
tons of U.S. wheat under a price-subsidy program, the Agriculture
Department said Monday.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said four private exporting companies
made the deals under the department's Export Enhancement Program,
or EEP.
   Delivery of the wheat is schedfuled for April and May, he said.
   The sales were part of 1 million tons authorized for sale to
China under the program Dec. 5. A previous allocation of 2 million
tons made last Feb. 27 had been exhausted, except for 10,000 tons.
   With the latest EEP approvals, China has only 1,050 tons
remaining to be used under the current authorization.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The latest sales would be about 11 million bushels. At
current prices, estimated by USDA at around $3.60 per bushel, the
wheat would have a farm value of around $39 million.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged $10.28 per ton, or
about 28 cents per bushel.
   The subsidized sales were handled by Louis Dreyfus Corp., 70,000
tons; Continental Grain Co., 84,150; Cargill Inc., 100,000, and J.
Aron &amp; Co., 45,000.
   With the latest sales, China has bought about 5.7 million tons
of U.S. wheat for delivery in the 1989-90 marketing year, which
began June 1, much of it without subsidies. In 1988-89, China
bought more than 8 million tons of U.S. wheat, all of it under the
EEP program.

   Even in New York, where a new scam comes along
about as often as a puff of pollution from New Jersey, this is one
for the books: They're scalping lox.
   More precisely, well-to-do customers are paying as much as $20
for tickets to get to the fish counter at Zabar's.
   Zabar's is a gourmet food market on Manhattan's Upper West Side,
but that is an understatement; Zabar's is a kind of secular
cathedral to New Yorkers who want the most wonderful whitefish, the
cream of caviars, the best bagels.
   On Saturday and Sunday mornings and on holidays, 100 people or
more line up outside. When the doors open at 8 a.m. they make
tracks for the dispenser that spins out numbered tickets _ first
come, first served.
   But not always.
   Zabar's officials say they have learned that some of the early
birds are ``phantom shoppers.'' They grab several numbers and then
go outside and sell them to other shoppers who want to jump the
line.
   ``Some people pay $20 for a number,'' said Kenneth Kuss, head
man at the fish counter. ``But I can understand it. I have
customers who come in here regularly and, what with sturgeon and
caviar, spend maybe $500. They don't care about an extra 20 bucks
if it'll save them an hour's wait.''
   An hour's wait is not unusual, says Murray Klein, one of Zabar's
owners. Sometimes, it stretches to two hours. On weekends, ``These
are big customers _ sometimes they tie up a clerk for 10 minutes.
An hour is nothing.''
   Klein says a look at the limousines parked outside attests to
the wealth of some customers; they can easily afford to pay $20 to
the scalpers. ``Time means a lot to them. I guess they go play golf
or meet someone,'' Klein said.
   Occasionally, police ticket cars that are double-parked outside,
and Klein tries to warn his customers. ``Some of the people
wouldn't go out,'' he said, preferring to risk a $40 ticket rather
than lose their places in line.
   ``So for these people, $20 is cheap,'' Klein said.
   Police say selling anything fraudulently in a public place at an
inflated price is a misdemeanor, punishable by fines and up to a
year in jail. But no one has been busted for the Zabar's scam _
yet. Klein says he's keeping an eye out for scalpers, and will stop
them if he can.
   ``It's not fair to the people who do stand in line,'' he says.

<HEAD>Fifth Former Official Refuses to Testify at HUD Scandal Hearings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former official of the Reagan
administration's Department of Housing and Urban Development
refused to testify Monday before a congressional panel that resumed
its hearings on the HUD scandals.
   James Hamernick, former director of HUD's office of insured
multi-family housing development, became the fifth former housing
official from the Reagan administration, including former HUD
Secretary Samuel Pierce, to refuse to testify on grounds of
self-incrimination.
   Hamernick had been questioned about his dealings with another
former HUD official, Lance Wilson, an aide to Pierce who quit to
become a housing consultant for a Wall Street investment firm. In
that position, Wilson wined and dined Hamernick.
   Hamernick appeared before the House Government Operations
subcommittee on employment and housing, whose investigation last
year prompted Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to ask a federal
court recently to name a special prosecutor to investigate Pierce
and other top officials.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., the subcommittee chairman, said last
fall he was ready to end the hearings and turn the HUD scandal over
to the courts. But he changed his mind and said he would continue
the House hearings while a special prosecutor _ yet to be named _
conducts a parallel investigation.
   Lantos asserted that ``there are still ... many unanswered
questions'' in the HUD scandal, which involves allegations of gross
mismanagement, influence-peddling, political favoritism and fraud.
   ``The subcommittee is duty-bound to proceed with its
investigation of abuses at HUD,'' he said. ``This is particularly
true since in recent weeks the subcommittee staff has uncovered a
good deal of relevant, new information.''
   He refused to say what that information was.
   Lantos cancelled the scheduled appearance Monday of a key
witness, Thomas Demery, a former assistant secretary for housing
who has been cooperating with investigators.
   Demery was prepared to testify about his involvement with Pierce
in administering the scandal-plagued Section 8 moderate
rehabilitation program, which provided subsidies to developers to
fix up low-income housing.
   Lantos said he would meet with a special prosecutor before
calling Demery to testify.
   Hamernick also invoked a House rule allowing subpoenaed
witnesses to ban cameras and recording equipment at a hearing.
   Congressional investigators say that after Wilson left his job
as Pierce's aide, he reported spending more than $2,000 on meals
and other amenities _ including a limousine _ for Hamernick in
expense accounts filed with his employer, Paine Webber.
   Congressional investigators, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that Wilson and not Hamernick was the real object of the
panel's line of inquiry.
   The subcommittee also questioned Carol Crawford, former
associate director of the Office of Management and Budget in the
Reagan administration, who said ``we have to accept a certain
amount of responsibility'' for what Lantos called gross
mismanagement at HUD during those years.
   Ms. Crawford underwent a sometimes contentious questioning by
the panel, when Lantos and another member, Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass., complaining that her lengthy replies did not answer the
questions.
   ``You are really wasting the committee's time,'' Lantos told her
at one point.
   She denied Lantos' suggestion that OMB received lists of
projects _ and the developers pushing for them _ which HUD had
selected for assistance under the urban development action grant
program.
   She said she did not recall seeing such lists, and said she had
met or talked with Pierce ``not more than half a dozen'' times.
   Except for her office's concern that former HUD assistant
secretary June Koch was spending too much time on a building trade
exhibition in the Soviet Union, Ms. Crawford said she was unaware
of other management problems that have since been uncovered at HUD.
   The committee said last fall that Ms. Koch's involvement in the
Soviet project after she left HUD and joined a private company
appeared to violate ethics laws.

   President Bush still considers the Soviet
challenge ``very much real'' and during his upcoming three-day
Western trip will defend his budget proposal to continue to pump
billions of dollars into nuclear-weapons programs, his spokesman
said Monday.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush's trip
to California, Nebraska and Ohio, which begins Tuesday, will focus
on defense issues.
   ``The president thinks it's important to talk to the American
people about the changes that we're seeing'' in Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union, Ftizwater said.
   In a series of speeches and stops at militry installations, the
president will argue for his proposal to close or change dozens of
military installations while continuing to commit resources to
nuclear weapons programs.
   Despite the reduction of East-West tensions over the past year,
``the Soviet challenge remains very much real,'' Fitzwater said.
``There have been reductions in troop strength; there are promises
of other reductions that we haven't seen. But this is not a time to
lay down our arms.''
   Bush's first stop Tuesday will be the Army's National Training
Center at Fort Irwin in Barstow, Calif., where he will view combat
exercises.
   On Wednesday, he will tour the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., where extensive research is
underway on the administration's Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Bush will also give a ``broad-based discussion of defense
policy'' in a speech Wednesday to the Commonwealth Club in San
Francisco, Fitzwater said. On Thursday, he will visit Strategic Air
Command headquarters in Omaha, Neb.
   ``The president will stress his continued support for strategic
modernization. Despite the lessening of tensions in many areas of
the world, the United States must continue to maintain a robust and
credible nulcear deterrent,'' Fitzwater said.
   Asked whether the president saw any irony in beginning his visit
in California, the state that would be hardest hit by base-closings
in his budget, the spokesman said:
   ``This trip represents several aspects of the changing world we
find. One is the ability to make reductions in U.S. forces, to
close down some bases that are obsolete and aren't needed.''
   ``The fact that some of those are in California simply points
out the changing nature of the defense situation,'' Fitzwater said.
   The administration has called for the closure or realignment of
more than 72 military installations and has called for ending
operations at 12 U.S. installations overseas.
   Democrats in Congress have complained that the administration's
budget calls for continued high-levels of financing for
sophisticated strategic systems while making deep cuts at U.S.
bases, most of them in Democratic districts.
   The spending plan sent to Congress Jan. 29 seeks total military
spending of $303.3 billion. That's about 2 percent, or $3.1
billion, less than this year's Pentagon budget, after inflation.
   However, the budget calls for about a 6 percent increase, after
inflation, in key weapons production activities, plus a 19 percent
jump in spending authority for development of a new generation of
reactors to make weapons materials.

   OK, here's the challenge: Screw a
lid onto a glass jar.
   If that sounds simple, you'll never win the eighth annual Rube
Goldberg competition at Purdue University, which aims to turn the
easiest tasks into amazingly complicated ones.
   In the spirit of Rube Goldberg, the cartoonist who specialized
in drawing complicated machines that performed mundane tasks, this
year's teams must use at least 25 steps to affix a two-piece lid
onto a pint-sized Ball canning jar.
   The lid has to be tight enough so that the jar can be turned
upside down without spilling. The task must be accomplished in five
minutes or less.
   Winners of the Feb. 17 campus contest will compete against
winners from other colleges and universities on March 17 at Purdue.
David Oliver, student chairman of the competition, said he expected
four to six teams at each level.
   Past challenges have included sharpening a pencil and preparing
an egg for frying.
   ``It's a unique competition in that people, mainly technology
and engineering students, have taken principles of science and
engineering and turned them inside out, finding complex ways to do
simple tasks,'' Oliver said.

   A man appeared in a village court
Monday with a rooster tucked under his arm and told the judge the
bird was the only legal counsel he could afford.
   The judge cried fowl.
   David Ashley was charged last month with raising poultry without
a permit, but his case was postponed until he could got a lawyer.
   When Ashley appeared in court with the rooster, village Justice
Gordon Tetor told him to get rid of the bird.
   ``It was the only legal counsel I could afford,'' Ashley told
the judge.
   ``I don't think he could speak,'' Tetor said.
   ``Sure they can, they speak to me all the time,'' Ashley said.
   After removing the chicken, Ashley told the judge he couldn't
afford a lawyer. He also told Tetor he would represent himself but
wasn't ready to go trial. Tetor adjourned the case until March 5.
   Ashley and his wife, Lynda, have about 20 chickens at their home
that they say are pets for their two children. Mrs. Ashley spent 10
days in jail in October after refusing to seek a permit or get rid
of the chickens.
   The Ashleys applied for a permit in November but the village
board turned them down and gave them 10 days to remove the
chickens. David Ashley was charged after the couple failed to
remove the birds.

<HEAD>Third Grader Suspended for Bringing Billy Beer to Show-and-Tell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A third-grade student who took an unopened
can of beer considered a collectors' item to ``show-and-tell'' at
school was suspended for three days, an action that the girl's
mother said Monday was ridiculous.
   ``I am furious,'' said Melissa Woodfin, whose 8-year-old
daughter, Haley, also must undergo counseling for illegal
possession of an alcoholic beverage for taking a can of Billy Beer
to show her classmates last week at Skipwith Elementary School.
   ``My daughter has been treated unfairly,'' Mrs. Woodfin said.
``She has lost three days of school with no right to make up the
work, according to the policy.''
   Mrs. Woodfin said her daughter removed the can of beer from a
display case at home. The beer, no longer made, was named for
President Carter's late brother, and unopened cans are considered
collector's items.
   ``She took it for show and tell,'' Mrs. Woodfin said. ``She
didn't run into a closet and pop it open.''
   In addition to the suspension from the school in suburban
Henrico County, police were notified that Haley had possessed an
alcoholic beverage illegally.
   School officials said the steps were taken under a strict drug
and substance abuse policy to which any child is subject if caught
in possession of drugs or alcohol, regardless of age.
   ``Suspending young people is not what we are about,'' said
Henrico School Superintendent William C. Bosher Jr. ``But we want
to help young people understand that alcohol and drugs are not
appropriate.''
   ``I have no problem with them having a policy, but you can't
treat a third-grader the way you would a teen-ager,'' Mrs. Woodfin
said.
   Bosher acknowledged that the suspension of an elementary school
pupil was unusual. He said suspension is a way to get the attention
of parents and bring parents, educators and the pupil together to
discuss a potential problem.
   Haley was back in school Monday after serving her suspension.
Mrs. Woodfin said she was awaiting word from police about what
legal steps would be taken.
   Sgt. James Price said the girl would be referred to juvenile
intake proceedings, ``which is nothing more than a counseling
session.''
   Mrs. Woodfin said police returned the can of Billy Beer and it
is back in the display case, where it will remain.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed in Monday's auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.7 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.83 percent, up from 7.77 percent
last week. An additional $7.6 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.72 percent, down from 7.73 percent
last week.
   The rates for three-month bills were the highest since they sold
for 7.88 percent Sept. 5, 1989. Three-month bills also sold for
7.83 percent Oct. 2.
   Rates for six-month bills were the lowest since they averaged
7.58 percent Jan. 22.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.10 percent for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,802.10, and 8.15 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,609.70.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index

<TEXT>
   Fearing that his country may be
forgotten now that deposed dictator Manuel Noriega is in U.S.
custody, Panama's Archbishop said Monday that the future of the
Central American nation depends on economic assistance from
Washington.
   Monsignor Marcus Antonio McGrath, who just returned from a trip
to Washington to request aid, met with South Florida church leaders
at the Miami Archdiocese to discuss the Catholic Church's role in
Panama's restructuring.
   ``There is hope and joy now in Panama,'' McGrath said. ``We (the
church) have to be more careful in our judgment and look beyond the
immediate moment.''
   Noriega surrendered to U.S. troops on Jan. 4 after the military
invasion of Panama on Dec. 20. McGrath said the church never
supported the invasion.
   ``We were against the invasion, against any solution that would
involve violence because violence breeds violence,'' he said. ``It
could have left in its wake many years of guerilla warfare in
Panama.''
   The Archbishop wants the U.S. government to do several things to
help his country get back on its feet. He said unemployment is
about 32 percent and there are 14,000 people homeless.
   ``Not a penny has come in almost two months,'' he said,
referring to a $1 billion aid package proposed by President Bush.
``All has been promised but nothing is being done about it.''
   McGrath also said he wants the U.S. troops that arrived in late
December to be pulled out immediately.
   ``The extra troops should leave as soon as possible, so the new
government can take over,'' he said.
   The fledgling new government should be allowed to make all
decisions concerning Panama and the military should let it test its
wings, he said.
   ``We need to develop a new generation of leaders,'' McGrath said
of President Guillermo Endara and his leaders. ``They are honest,
dedicated and well-intentioned and will make a lot of mistakes, but
I think it will work out.''

   Price Waterhouse, the folks who certify
Academy Awards winners, soon will be monitoring the efficiency of
the postal system.
   The U.S. Postal Service announced Monday it has hired the
accounting firm to begin measuring its performance in delivering
the mail.
   ``Our efforts to improve and enhance mail service must begin
with an accurate assessment of that service as our customers see
it,'' Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank said in a statement.
   The decision to award the three-year, $23.4 million contract to
Price Waterhouse was made in Los Angeles, where the Postal Service
board of governors is holding its monthly meeting.
   Frank had announced earlier that an independent test of mail
performance would be conducted and the results made public.
   Price Waterhouse will begin monitoring mail delivery this spring
and go into high gear next year. Details of making the results
public were not disclosed.
   The contract calls for Price Waterhouse to mail letters within
and between 86 cities, and to keep records of when each item was
mailed and received.
   The company will calculate the percentage of mail delivered
overnight and by the second and third days, and how that compares
with Postal Service delivery standards.
   The tests will involve more than 1 million letters sent annually
to households and businesses that will use a toll-free telephone
number to report when the letters arrive.

<HEAD>Productivity Posts Slowest Gain Since 1982; Labor Costs Escalate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American workers' productivity rose just 0.9
percent last year _ their worst showing since the 1981-82 recession
_ while hourly labor costs sped upward, the government said Monday.
   The Labor Department said that the 0.9 percent increase in
non-farm productivity _ defined as output per hour of work _ was
less than half the 2 percent gain recorded in 1988.
   While blaming part of last year's poor performance on an overall
slowdown in economic growth, analysts worried that the combination
of weak productivity growth and rising labor costs would further
weaken America's ability to compete internationally.
   ``That's a recipe for trouble,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist for the Boston Co. ``It's very distressing ... it's
symptomatic of an economy that is near the end of expansion.''
   The report showed that while productivity was slumping, hourly
labor costs _ a major inflation measure for businesses _ escalated
significantly, jumping by 5.5 percent, up from 4.7 percent in 1988
and the biggest increase since 1982.
   ``Labor cost increases are probably the scariest part of the
report,'' said David Wyss, chief economist at DRI-McGraw Hill.
   For the October-through-December quarter, non-farm productivity
rose a barely perceptible 0.2 percent, the report said. Hourly
labor costs rose at an annual rate of 6.9 percent in the fourth
quarter.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater pinned the slight
productivity increase on the overall slowdown of the economy. The
pace of economic expansion, as measured by the gross national
product, grew by a rate of 0.5 percent in the final three months of
1989, the slowest growth for any quarter since 1986.
   ``The small productivity gains last year probably reflect the
transition to a more moderate pace of economic growth rather than a
general weakening in productivity,'' Fitzwater said. ``Productivity
gains often fall off sharply when output growth slows.''
   Output in the non-farm sector was up 3.3 percent in 1989 while
the number of hours worked rose by 2.4 percent, giving the 0.9
percent increase in productivity.
   The report was certain to revive the debate over America's
lagging productivity.
   Since the end of the 1981-82 recession, productivity growth has
averaged 1.8 percent a year. While a slight improvement over the
1.2 percent average growth rate in the 1970s, it was still far
below the 3.3 percent rate of increase posted in the two decades
following World War II, when American workers enjoyed healthy wage
gains and a rising standard of living.
   Increasing productivity is considered basic to boosting living
standards because it allows businesses to pay workers more as their
output rises without risking higher inflation.
   In addition to the large hike in hourly compensation, the report
showed that unit labor costs, another key determinant of future
price inflation, shot up 4.6 percent for the year, compared with a
2.7 increase in 1988. Unit labor costs reflect changes in
compensation as well as changes in productivity.
   ``Productivity gains have been anemic for several years. It
means that our standard of living isn't increasing anymore,'' said
Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm.
   However, Robert Dederick, chief economist for the Northern Trust
Co. of Chicago, said productivity growth has been slow, in part
because the labor market has been growing rapidly in the 1980s,
absorbing record numbers of unskilled workers.
   ``There's sort of a knee-jerk reaction that this is a negative,
and I'm not sure I agree with that,'' he said, adding that it would
be worrisome only if productivity failed to rebound in the 1990s as
the workforce matures and gains job skills.
   Analysts were cheered by the report's findings on manufacturing
productivity, which continued to show better gains than the rest of
the economy.
   Manufacturers reported a 2.8 percent productivity gain in 1989,
close to the 2.7 percent gain of 1988. Manufacturing output rose
3.7 percent last year, down from the 6.1 percent increase of 1988.

   The Serbian president Monday
threatened to send hundreds of thousands of Serbs to take over the
province of Kosovo, the scene of a fierce ethnic feud.
   Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who backs the minority
Serbs, also accused two rival republics of aiding ethnic Albanians
in the strife-torn province.
   The Serbian republic has administrative control of the Kosovo,
where 90 percent of the population is ethnic Albanian.
   On Monday, Milosevic called for ``hundreds of thousands'' of
Serbian settlers to move to Kosovo to aid their countrymen.
   ``Every man in Serbia is ready to head for Kosovo if the terror
is continued there,'' Milosevic added.
   At least 25 ethnic Albanians have died since Jan. 24, when the
latest wave of unrest broke out.
   Albanians in Kosovo oppose control of their province by Serbia,
which considers Kosovo the cradle of Serbian culture.
   The ethnic and political divisions are part of a larger tapestry
of conflict that threatens to dismember this diverse nation that
once was held together by the dominating presence of Josip Broz
Tito, who died in 1980.
   The Communist Party in the relatively liberal Slovenian republic
on Sunday voted to break away from the national party, pushing the
nation closer to dissolution.
   Yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous
provinces, each with its own government and party structure. Serbia
is dominated by hard-line Communists. Slovenia and Croatia are
reform oriented and have backed the ethnic Albanians in their
conflict with Serbia.
   Albanians are demanding free elections and an end to emergency
restrictions in place in the province for the past 12 months and
the release of jailed ethnic Albanian political activists.
   Serbia's leadership showed little sign of compromise Monday.
   ``Those who support ... terror in Kosovo are lashing out at
Serbia and Yugoslavia,'' Milosevic said in comments carried by the
state Tanjug news agency. ``Every Serbian citizen feels fury in his
heart because of the support for terror from Slovenia and Croatia.''
   But Tanjug also reported that Serbia had decided to end a
two-month economic boycott of Slovenia, which was imposed Dec. 1
after Slovenian authorities banned a planned rally of Serbs
protesting Slovenian support for Kosovo Albanians. It gave no
explanation.
   The provincial capital, Pristina, was the scene of a brief rally
on Monday, with several thousand Kosovo Albanians assembling to
observe a minute of silence for the dead.
   As the hour struck, car horns sounded through the city, and
pedestrians stopped on sidewalks, hands raised and fingers spread
in the victory sign.
   Riot police stood by. As the minute ended, there was applause
before participants returned to their daily routine.
   Thousands again gathered in Pristina at 7 p.m. for a march by
candlelight. Except for occasional shouts of ``Long live democracy,
long live freedom,'' the protest was eerily silent.
   Federal authorities brought at least a temporary halt to the
violence Friday by sending tanks into the province and ordering
military jets to fly low over Pristina and other cities.
   But leaders of both Kosovo's 1.6 million ethnic Albanians and of
the Slav minority of Serbs and Montenegrins expressed pessimism
about the chances of peace in the long term.
   Bogdan Kecman, leader of the Slav minority group Bozur described
the calm in Kosovo as temporary. ``The peace is just a cover,'' he
asserted. ``Inside, war is raging.''
   Albanians continued to hold wildcat strikes in the province.

   An Associated Press story transmitted Feb. 4
may have left unclear the role played by banks and other lenders in
pursuing delinquent borrowers under the Guaranteed Student Loan
Program.
   The loan program is administered by 56 guarantee agencies that
protect private lenders against losses from loan defaults. If a
borrower defaults and the lender is unable to collect, the account
is turned over to one of these special agencies, which in turn goes
after the delinquent funds.
   The guarantors collected more than $400 million in fiscal 1989,
in part by garnishing lottery winnings, refusing professional
licenses and putting liens on real estate.

   The Bush administration voiced support Monday
for pro-democracy demonstrators in Moscow and for political
pluralism as Secretary of State James A. Baker III headed for
wide-ranging talks in the Soviet capital.
   While refraining from any direct appraisal of the power shifts
contemplated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the
State Department said the demonstrators who called on the party to
relinquish some of its powers were asserting a right to participate
in the nation's political process.
   With Baker due in Moscow for talks beginning Wednesday night,
administration officials shied away from making any judgments about
the party's deliberations, which began on Monday with a call from
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for a loosening of control.
   His landmark speech followed perhaps the largest protest in
Moscow since the Bolshevik revolution. At least 200,000 impassioned
citizens marched to the Kremlin on Sunday, demanding that the party
embrace reform and end its exclusive control of the government.
   Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, called
the turnout ``a measure of the new openness in the Soviet system''
and said the Soviet people ``felt free enough to march for the
rights of greater political participation in the political
process.''
   She added: ``Our dream for all people, including the Soviet
people, is political pluralism and free market economies.''
   Similarly, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said:
``We welcome political pluralism, but it's difficult to say exactly
what the demonstrations yesterday meant. But there, again, we
aren't going to offer any comment that might be disruptive in terms
of the (Communist Party) plenum that they're just starting today.''
   Asked about a potential change in the Soviet Constitution,
ending the party's iron grip on power, Fitzwater said: ``That's an
internal matter. We will not comment on it.''
   Baker headed first for Shannon Airport in Ireland and a meeting
with Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France while his plane is
being refueled.
   The meeting follows talks in the last two weeks with two other
European foreign ministers, Douglas Hurd of Britain and
Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany. The idea is to compare
notes among the allies before Baker's talks with Gorbachev and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, talks held in the
shadow of burgeoning sentiment for Germany reunification.
   The United States insists that a united Germany must remain in
NATO.
   Last week, Shevardnadze proposed that the issue be put to a
international referendum while Gorbachev cautioned that ``forcing
passions and simplified approaches to the problem could be
pernicious.'' West Germany Chancellor Helmut Kohl immediately
rejected the referendum idea.
   Before going to Moscow, Baker is paying a 27-hour visit to
Czechoslovakia, where a Velvet Revolution smoothly transferred
power last year from a hard-line government to reformers headed by
playwright Vaclav Havel.
   Baker will meet with Havel on Tuesday and make a speech
Wednesday supporting Gorbachev's call for a 35-nation European
summit meeting to lessen tensions in Europe.
   He will hold talks with Shevardnadze in Moscow Wednesday evening
through Saturday, when Baker will make an unprecedented appearance
before the Soviet parliament's International Affairs Committee to
answer questions.
   Baker will meet with Gorbachev on Friday.
   In testifying last week before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, Baker endorsed the reformers in Eastern Europe and said
he would offer technical cooperation and trade benefits to the
Soviets if their human rights record continued to show improvement.
   The issue is not ``whether or not President Gorbachev will or
will not succeed,'' Baker said. ``The issue ought to be whether or
not we can take advantage of the fact that he is there now
reforming things and ... lock in agreements that are mutually
advantageous.''
   Baker's initial purpose in scheduling the Moscow talks was to
prepare for the summit meeting President Bush will hold with
Gorbachev in Washington in June, a meeting aimed at signing a new
treaty that would sharply reduce each side's arsenals of long-range
missiles and bombers.
   Regional issues are also on Baker's agenda.
   The United States and the Soviet Union have been aiding opposite
sides in the civil war in Angola. Both sides support the principle
of a negotiated settlement, but the Bush administration has charged
that peace prospects were set back in December by a major
government offensive in southeast Angola.
   In Afghanistan, an 11-year-old war rages on between the
Soviet-backed Marxist government and U.S.-armed guerrillas even
though the Red Army concluded its occupation of the country last
February.
   The future of President Najib is central to a solution.
   ``Our goal continues to be a transfer of power from the Najib
regime to a broadly representative government,'' State Department
spokeswoman Tutwiler said, adding: ``Our policy has not changed. We
have consistently said we support the Afghan resistance and Najib
must go.''

   Firemen fought a blaze Monday that
has burned 40 percent of the Poco das Antas Wildlife Reserve in
southeastern Brazil, which shelters the last 250 golden lion
marmosets in the world, officials reported.
   Thousands of the small, goldish-maned monkeys, also called
tamarins, once lived along the 3,000 miles of Brazil's coastline.
   The number of golden lion marmosets fell to about 70 in the
early 1970s, but the cat-sized monkeys have made a comeback at Poco
das Antas, which has financial support from the Smithonian
Institution, World Wildlife Fund and Canadian government.
   Rare sloths, alligators, monkeys and jaguars also live at Poco
das Antas, which means ``watering hole of the tapirs'' in
Portuguese.
   ``We won't know if any of the tamarins perished as a result of
the fire until the situation is under control, but I fear the
worst,'' said Vicente Moreira Conti, acting superintendent of the
Rio office of Brazil's federal environmental protection agency.
   He said more than 100 firemen and volunteers were trying to
control the blaze at the the 12,300-acre reserve 80 miles northeast
of Rio, but faced serious obstacles.
   ``The reserve's terrain is composed of very dry, tall grass that
is extremely combustible, and the fire is located in a part of the
reserve to which there is only difficult access,'' Conti said.
``The fire is nearly impossible to put out.''
   Firemen carried only limited supplies of water in portable tanks
and were trying to smother the blaze with rubber mats, he said.
   ``What we really need is a few days of heavy rain, but
unfortunately that's not in the forecast,'' Conti said. ``We expect
to have the fire under control within the next 48 hours but there
could be a great deal more damage.''
   The fire started Saturday, probably spontaneously, he said. It
is summer in Brazil and temperatures have been around 100 degrees
for weeks.

   Here are excerpts from the text of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's report to the Communist Party Central Committee meeting
Monday. The English translation was provided by Tass, the official
Soviet news agency:
   Comrades, I think you will agree that we have gathered for a
very important plenary meeting, a meeting that Communists and all
society have been waiting for with immense interest and impatience.
   The Central Committee has received thousands of letters with
suggestions and wishes from party members and non-party people,
from party organizations and committees, from work collectives,
factory workers and farmers, intellectuals, scientists, veterans
and youth.
   Telegrams continue to pour in. You, too, have seen rallies and
meetings at which the most vital problems were discussed often from
various positions, in an acute and interested way. Their
participants also wanted to make their viewpoint known to the party
Central Committee.
   All this combined is a phenomenon that reflects profound changes
that have already occurred and are occurring in our society along
the tracks of perestroika and in conditions of democratization and
glasnost.
   The main thing that now worries Communists and all citizens of
the country is the fate of perestroika, the fate of the country and
the role of the Soviet Communist Party at the current, probably
most crucial, stage of revolutionary transformation.
   Society wants to know the party's position, and this determines
the entire significance of our plenum.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Having assessed the entire situation and examined petitions from
Communists and party organizations, the Politburo submits the
following proposal for your consideration: to hold the 28th
Communist Party congress late in June-early in July this year. We
are convinced that the proposal will be approved at this plenum.
   The congress should be preceded, in our view, with a full
report-and-election campaign in all links of the party with a broad
debate on the platform and the draft new rules of the Soviet
Communist Party. Overdue personnel issues will be resolved and new
elected party bodies will be formed. ...
   At this plenum we are to adopt the Central Committee's draft
platform for the congress. In a month or, better, three weeks from
now _ not later _ we will probably have to gather again for a
plenary meeting to consider the draft new rules and have them
published for public discussion.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Communist Party initiated perestroika and generated
its concept and policy. Profound revolutionary changes encompassing
all spheres of life and all sections of the population have been
launched on this basis in the country.
   This has paved the way for renewing society and tapping
socialism's potential. The party has succeeded in expressing in
theory and policy the country's acute needs and realities of
present-day world development.
   Rapid changes, unusual in scope and originality, are taking
place within the framework of perestroika. This makes ever new
demands on state and public institutes and, of course, on the
Soviet Communist Party.
   As a matter of fact, we have approached the moment when the
party should enrich its policy with due account for changes that
have already occurred during perestroika and problems that have
recently emerged.
   Any delay threatens a lag and the loss of the initiative, which
would, in turn, inevitably affect the party itself and the future
of its revolutionary undertakings.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Of no less importance is the understanding of the fact _ which
is the other aspect of the problem that also demands the bringing
forward of the congress _ is that the party will only be able to
fulfill the mission of political vanguard if it drastically
restructures itself, masters the art of political work in the
present-day conditions and succeeds in cooperating with all forces
committed to perestroika.
   The crux of the party's renewal is the need to get rid of
everything that tied it to the authoritarian-bureaucratic system, a
system that left its mark not only on methods of work and
interrelationships within the party, but also on ideology, ways of
thinking and notions of socialism.
   The platform says: our ideal is a humane, democratic socialism.
Expressing the interests of the working class and all working
people and relying on the great legacy of Marx, Engels and Lenin,
the Soviet Communist Party is creatively developing socialist
ideals to match present-day realities and with due account for the
entire experience of the twentieth century.
   The platform states clearly what we should abandon. We should
abandon the ideological dogmatism that became ingrained during past
decades, outdated stereotypes in domestic policy and outmoded views
on the world revolutionary process and world development as a whole.
   We should abandon everything that led to the isolation of
socialist countries from the mainstream of world civilization. We
should abandon the understanding of progress as a permanent
confrontation with a socially different world.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The party in a renewing society can exist and play its role as
vanguard only as a democratically recognized force. This means that
its status should not be imposed through constitutional endorsement.
   The Soviet Communist Party, it goes without saying, intends to
struggle for the status of the ruling party. But it will do so
strictly within the framework of the democratic process b giving up
any legal and political advantages, offering its program and
defending it in discussions, cooperating with other social and
political forces, always working amidst the masses, living by their
interests and their needs.
   The extensive democratization currently under way in our society
is being accompanied by mounting political pluralism. Various
social and political organizations and movements emerge. This
process may lead at a certain stage to the establishment of parties.
   The Soviet Communist Party is prepared to act with due account
for these new circumstances, cooperate and conduct a dialogue with
all organizations committed to the Soviet constitution and the
social system endorsed in this constitution.
   At the same time we openly state that at this crucial period the
Soviet Communist Party is able to play the consolidating,
integrating role and ensure progress of perestroika for the benefit
of the entire nation.

<HEAD>Bush Says Global Warming Response Mustn't Hurt Economic Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush called Monday for balancing
economic and environmental concerns when dealing with global
warming, prompting environmentalists to accuse him of siding with
industry and avoiding a pressing world problem.
   Bush, speaking to an international conference on the threat of a
world ``greenhouse'' effect, said ``our policies must be consistent
with economic growth.'' And he suggested that in some areas of the
debate ``politics and opinion have outpaced the science.''
   Environmentalists at the conference suggested the problem was
not scientific but a lack of U.S. leadership in dealing with the
issue. One participant called Bush's comments ``a gross
disappointment.''
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., a frequent
critic of Bush's stand on global warming, said the president was
``moving as slow as molasses'' on the issue when many scientists
already are convinced decisive action is needed.
   But the president, addressing the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, said nations must strike a bargain between curbing
pollution that is causing a warming of the earth and maintaining
economic growth.
   Arguing that key scientific questions have yet to be answered,
Bush suggested it was too early to unleash an action plan aimed at
specific pollution reductions as many environmentalists _ and some
European countries _ have said is required.
   Later at the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Bush does not believe it is ``time for a call to
arms'' on the global warming issue, but ``time for a call to
research and to find out more about it.''
   ``Our goal continues to be matching policy commitments to
emerging scientific knowledge _ and a reconciling of environmental
protection to the continued benefits of economic development,''
said Bush.
   The remarks brought a subdued reaction from many of the
participants at the international conference sponsored by the
United Nations and attended by representatives from some 60 nations.
   Delegates from some European countries, including Norway,
Denmark and Sweden, have argued that enough scientific knowledge
has been accumulated to warrant a commitment from industrial
nations to at least stabilize carbon dioxide pollution at current
levels over the next decade.
   Scientists are concerned that the accumulation of manmade
pollutants, largely carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil
fuels, is creating a serious global problem.
   Like a greenhouse, the pollution traps heat and reflects it back
to earth, causing a warming of the globe. While there is little
dispute that greenhouse gases are increasing, there remains
disagreement within the scientific community as to how severe the
warming will become and what effect it might have on the earth.
   If the pollutants are left unchecked, many scientists expect the
earth's temperature to rise by 4 to 9 degrees by the middle of the
next century, perhaps causing coastal flooding and droughts in
interior regions.
   On the other hand, reducing greenhouse gases would require major
shifts from the use of coal, oil and natural gas, which are
mainstays for a broad range of industries. Industrial leaders have
raised concerns that if pollution controls are imposed too quickly,
there could be severe economic disruption.
   Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club, said of Bush's speech, ``It
was a gross disappointment. There was more talk in the speech about
economics than about the environment.''
   Stewart Boyle of the Association for the Conservation of Energy
in Great Britain said Bush's remarks demonstrated ``a leadership
crisis'' on the global warming issue at the White House. ``About
the only thing we can say about it is he turned up'' at the
conference, said Boyle.
   In his speech, Bush said he is determined to ``produce policies
that work'' and suggested some of his critics ``may be tempted to
exploit legitimate concerns for political positioning.''
   Bush's address became a focus of controversy even before the
conference opened when White House Chief of Staff John Sununu was
reported to have ordered changes in the text to mute U.S. concerns
about global warming. Sununu acknowledged making changes, but said
the final version reflected the views of the president.
   During a campaign appearance in Michigan on Aug. 31, 1988,
then-candidate Bush endorsed unilateral action to deal with
greenhouse pollution, declaring: ``Those who think we're powerless
to do anything about the greenhouse effect are forgetting the White
House effect.''
   He continued in his campaign remarks: ``As president I intend to
do something about it. In my first year in office I will convene a
global conference on the environment at the White House. ... We
will talk about global warming ... and we will act.''
   No such conference has been held, although Bush on Monday
announced he is calling a meeting at the White House this spring to
bring together top environmentalists, economists and ecologists to
grapple with the global warming issue.

<HEAD>Former President Urges Immediate Aid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Panama's former president, expressing support
for President Bush's proposed $1 billion economic aid package, said
Monday his country needs immediate economic help to rebound from
the Noriega era.
   ``Panamanians want to do the job, but to be successful, we need
your economic support over the next two years to recover from the
devastation of Panama's economy,'' Nicolas Ardito Barletta told the
international economic policy and trade subcommittee of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee.
   Barletta, an economist who served as Panama's president for 11
months in 1984-1985, said Panama's economy is ``highly depressed.''
Barletta, now a consultant in Panama, was ousted as president by
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, overthrown in the Dec. 20 U.S.
invasion.
   Among the problems Panama faces are: unemployment of 25 percent;
loss of $600 million in business inventories to looting after the
invasion; an external debt $1 billion in arrears and a heavy
physical damage to public facilities.
   Bush has proposed a economic package of $1 billion in aid for
Panama.
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., chairman of the trade panel,
questioned the amount of the Bush package.
   ``This country is going to have to help,'' he said. ``Perhaps
not the $1 billion that the president has proposed but certainly a
good deal.''
   Gedjenson said much of Panama's economic damage stems from the
``two years of U.S. economic sanctions'' and the large-scale
military operation to dislodge Noriega.
   Barletta stressed the need to act swiftly. ``A delay in support
will prolong stagnation and create despair,'' he said.
   As the economy begins to recover, with public works projects to
employ people and credit programs to revive trade, the private
sector will proceed with ``sustainable growth,'' he said.
   On a positive note, Barletta said the dissolution of the
Panamania Defense Forces, which Noriega headed, will save the
country roughly $70 million annually. The military will be replaced
by a newly trained police force.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, responding to
charges the Pentagon has stockpiled $30 billion worth of unneeded
supplies and equipment, questioned the figure Monday but said a
``fouled up'' acquisition system contributed to excess.
   Cheney disputed the Senate Budget Committee's findings that as
much as $30 billion worth of material is going to waste in a $103
billion inventory and said the Pentagon is taking steps to improve
the system.
   ``They have a 13,000-year supply of a particular part for an
F-14 fighter aircraft,'' said Sen. James Sasser, a Tennessee
Democrat and chairman of the Budget Committee. ``There are a number
of other instances similar to that.''
   The committee's findings were based in part on staff aides'
visits to military bases around the country and on interviews with
Pentagon officials.
   Cheney, testifying before the panel on his $292.1 billion
military budget request, said there is a debate over the amount of
excess inventory, ``but a lot of that has to do with the way the
system works. The system is fouled up.''
   ``If the system is not very efficient or if there's long lead
time between when you order something and you actually get it, what
you're going to do is order enough so that you can rat-hole
whatever extra you need,'' Cheney said.
   The defense secretary said among the changes under way is having
the Army and Air Force adopt the Navy system that reduces the
overall demand for spare parts by 20 percent.
   ``An individual will know what it costs him up front to order a
part. It won't be a freebie. It will come out of his budget,''
Cheney said.
   The report said among the excess supplies was a female dress
shirt in 126 sizes. The Army wanted to add 100 more sizes to the 58
sizes of the long-sleeved dress shirt in then had its inventory,
but after warnings from the Defense Logistics Agency that the total
was unnecessary, settled for adding 68 sizes.
   More than 200,000 of the shirts, priced at $14 apiece, are in
the Army inventory, far in excess for the 86,000 women in the
active service.
   ``We're moving in the direction of using commercial
specifications to reduce the total number of clothing sizes,''
Cheney said. ``The clothing purchases have been out of control in a
sense.''
   The committee staff found, among other things, that there was a
glut of supplies and that in many instances equipment was stored in
the open and was deteriorating. The Defense Department has spent
over $700 million in the last six to eight years for additional
warehouse space, the report said.
   Sasser said that with past Pentagon efforts to improve
management, Congress ``runs into the same procedures, the same cast
of characters ... (and) when it bubbles to the surface, there's
embarrassment.''
   ``In the final analysis, we're going to have to institute some
kind of incentives,'' he said.
   Cheney and the Pentagon also were criticized by Democrats on the
committee for a military spending plan for fiscal 1991 that moves
ahead several big-ticket projects, such as the B-2 stealth bomber
and the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Democrats believe that revolutionary changes in Eastern Europe
and the lessening Soviet threat to the West should be reflected in
the U.S. defense budget.
   ``Why are we going forward and spending these very large sums of
money on things like the B-2, the rail-mobile MX (nuclear
missile)?'' Sasser asked Cheney. ``Why don't we wait and see what
kind of world we're going to be living in?''
   The Bush administration's proposed defense budget calls for $5.5
billion for five B-2 stealth bombers and an increase of nearly $1
billion for a total of $4.5 billion for SDI, popularly known as
Star Wars.
   Cheney said the Pentagon is studying the programs and will
decide at a later date whether to scale them back.
   The defense secretary said it was unlikely he would cancel the
B-2 program, but changes are possible in plans for a 132-aircraft
fleet at a cost of $70 billion.

<TEXT>
   Actor Joel Fluellen, who protested black
stereotyping in Hollywood and played the brother in ``The Jackie
Robinson Story,'' has died. He was 81.
   Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher said Monday
an autopsy showed Fluellen committed suicide and died from a
gunshot wound to the head. Police found his body Friday at his Los
Angeles home.
   Along with a string of movie and television credits, Fluellen
played an instrumental role in fighting black discrimination in
Hollywood during the 1940s and 1950s.
   Fluellen introduced resolutions to the Screen Actors Guild
asking the group to ``use all its powers to oppose discrimination''
against blacks in the industry. His proposals were turned down, but
23 years later SAG formed its Ethnic Equal Opportunity Committee.
   The Louisiana-raised actor came to Hollywood around 1940 after
appearing on the New York stage.
   Fluellen played the brother in the 1950 movie, ``The Jackie
Robinson Story.'' His other movie credits include ``The Great White
Hope,'' ``The Learning Tree'' and ``Run Silent, Run Deep.''
   He also appeared in the television series ``Hill Street Blues.''
   Funeral services were pending.

<TEXT>
   The violent winds that killed 23 people this
weekend in northern and western France caused at least $670 million
damage, insurers said Monday.
   Tens of thousands of citizens are expected to make claims this
week for homes, cars or businesses damaged by the windstorm, the
Center of Insurance Information and Documentation reported.
   The state electricity company, Electricite de France, meanwhile
reported that about 200,000 homes remained without power Monday as
crews tried to restore lines toppled by falling trees.
   No total figure for downed trees was estimated by authorities,
but at least 2,500 fell in the famed Bois de Boulogne and Bois de
Vincennes in Paris, police said.
   Another 600 came down on the grounds of Versailles, with some
striking buildings at Marie-Antoinette's mock Norman hamlet. The
grounds will remain closed this week, authorities said.
   Thousands of acres of forests were damaged by the winds, whose
top speed reached 104 mph at the Pointe de Raz in far western
France.
   The death toll of 23 made the storm the worst to strike France
in 20 years, authorities said.
   The winds occurred nine days after a similar storm raged across
southern Britain, much of northern France and six European
countries, leaving more than 61 dead and causing hundreds of
millions of dollars in damage.

   Senate tax writers spared no rhetoric Monday
in criticizing the use of surplus Social Security taxes to hide the
size of the federal deficit, but they and their expert witnesses
disagreed on what to do about it.
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., whose bill to cut Social
Security taxes by up to $300 a year for higher-income workers set
off the debate, said it is thievery to use those taxes for other
purposes. Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., termed it looting.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., called it embezzlement but said
Moynihan's proposed remedy is worse _ a ``sugar coating hides a
twin toxic menace: poison that will bankrupt Social Security and
burden the many to the benefit of the few.''
   Two former government officials who are among the foremost
authorities on the pension system offered conflicting advice as the
Senate Finance Committee held the first congressional hearing on
whether Social Security taxes should be cut to keep surpluses out
of government hands.
   Robert J. Myers, who helped create the system in 1934 and was
its chief actuary for 23 years, endorsed the tax reduction. ``The
time has arrived when the financing of the Old Age, Survivors and
Disability Insurance program should be rationalized, stabilized and
made crystal clear by going to a pay-as-you-go basis, as proposed
by Senator Moynihan,'' Myers said.
   Robert M. Ball, Social Security commissioner from 1962 to 1973,
said nothing justifies an immediate reduction in payroll taxes. If
Congress decides to eliminate Social Security surpluses, the money
should be transferred into the Medicare hospitalization fund, which
also is financed through payroll taxes, he said.
   The Bush administration vigorously opposes the tax cut as a
threat to Social Security benefits and an opening for increases in
other taxes. Nevertheless, Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn
S. King told the hearing, ``the administration is open to every
reasonable alternative'' so long as any change does not upset ``the
sound financial footing ... of the last seven years.''
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas and chairman of the Finance
Committee, sought to reassure future beneficiaries. ``Today, the
Social Security system is sound. That's my No. 1 priority, the No.
1 priority of this committee,'' Bentsen said.
   The Social Security tax on 132 million workers and their
employers is bringing in $1 billion a week more than is being paid
out in benefits. This surplus is invested, by law, in federal
securities and the money mixed with other federal revenues to
finance general government programs.
   Moynihan and some other Democrats find that galling for two
reasons.
   First, they say, it requires lower- and middle-income workers to
pay an unfair share of the cost of government. Unlike the income
tax, the Social Security tax rate is the same for rich and poor and
it applies from the first dollar earned; the tax ends once income
passes $51,300.
   Second, Democrats say, President Bush and his predecessor,
Ronald Reagan, have been able to run on pledges not to increase
income taxes because they knew the mounting Social Security surplus
would hide the true size of the deficit in other government acounts.
   This is thievery, Moynihan says, and the only solution is to put
Social Security on a pay-as-you-go basis, eliminating the surplus.
   Moynihan's bill would repeal the tax increase that on Jan. 1
boosted the rate for employees and employers to 7.65 percent of the
first $51,300 of wages; that would drop the rate back to 7.51
percent. Next Jan. 1, the rate would be cut to 6.55 percent, where
it would remain until 2011.
   Starting in 2012, when the post-World War II generation begins
retiring, the tax rate would resume a gradual increase, peaking at
8.1 percent in 2045.
   Bush told a news conference last month that Moynihan's bill is
``a disguise for increased taxes around the corner.'' Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady called the proposal ``goofy'' and ``the
height of folly.''
   The administration has acknowledged that it is unfair to future
retirees to use Social Security surpluses for other purposes.
However, the president's solution is to do nothing about it until
the federal budget is balanced and then to use surplus Social
Security taxes only for debt reduction.

<HEAD>Jackson, Thatcher, Argue About South Africa Sanctions</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Jesse
Jackson, the black U.S. civil rights leader, argued about sanctions
against South Africa during a a 90-minute meeting Monday, but
smiled for photographers afterward.
   Mrs. Thatcher gave Jackson a message for jailed black leader
Nelson Mandela saying many hopes rest with him, said a spokesman at
her official residence, 10 Downing Street, who asked that his name
not be used. Jackson is on his way to South Africa.
   ``We agreed to disagree,'' Jackson told reporters, referring to
Mrs. Thatcher's opposition to sanctions. He added, ``I feel we have
a better feel for each other.''
   Jackson said Mrs. Thatcher expressed belief that President F.W.
de Klerk of South Africa was committed to reforms he announced
Friday, which include legalizing the African National Congress
guerrilla movement and the speedy release of Mandela, an ANC leader
when he went to jail nearly 28 years ago.
   ``She happens to believe for the most part that the courageous
steps taken by Mr. de Klerk will continue,'' Jackson said. ``I
believe they will continue with encouragement, with stimulation to
go forward, with deterrence to go backwards, with economic
incentives if and when apartheid is dismantled.''
   Both Jackson and the Thatcher spokesman said the unexpectedly
long meeting was friendly, and Jackson promised to telephone with a
report on his South African visit.
   ``The prime minister asked Mr. Jackson to give Mr. Mandela a
message,'' said the British spokesman: ``Tell Mr. Mandela how many
hopes ride on him for the future of his country.''
   Jackson flew to Zambia on Monday night, and goes to South Africa
on Wednesday for his first visit in more than a decade. He has been
refused a visa since 1979.
   ``We committed ourselves to remain in dialogue as both of us
search in our own way for a new South Africa and a new equation,''
Jackson said of the meeting with Mrs. Thatcher.
   At a news conference held for him earlier Monday by three black
members of the House of Commons, Jackson said: ``Sanctions and
apartheid should end on the same day, and it ought to be soon. Even
Mr. de Klerk did not make ending sanctions a precondition for
negotiations'' with black leaders.
   Jackson urged white South Africans, outnumbered by blacks 5 to
1, not to fear losing power.
   ``There has been no evidence of any kind of retaliatory schemes
by blacks against whites once they become involved politically,''
he said. ``The quest must be for a non-racial state where all can
share power and responsibility.''
   Mrs. Thatcher been criticized by opposition parties and
anti-apartheid groups in Britain for lifting restrictions on
academic and cultural contacts immediately after de Klerk announced
the reforms Friday.
   Jackson was invited to South Africa by Walter Sisulu, an African
National Council leader freed last year, and the South African
Council of Churches.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain and snow was scattered over the West on Monday, while parts
of Minnesota warmed to record highs in the 40s.
   A winter storm warning was in effect into the night over the
Washington Cascades and Olympics.
   At midday, snow was scattered over the Idaho Panhandle and
western Washington, from south-central Oregon into north-central
California, and over northwestern New Mexico.
   Generally light rain extended along much of the northern half of
the Pacific Coast. And a thundershower produced small hail during
the early afternoon at Hoquiam, Wash.
   Snow fell during the night from Sunday into Monday over
north-central Arizona, leaving 6 inches of new snow at Flagstaff, 5
inches at Sunset Crater National Monument, 3{ inches at Walnut
Canyon National Monument and a little more than an inch at Munds
Park. That made a total of 15 inches of snow on the ground at
Flagstaff Airport, the National Weather Service said.
   In Minnesota, Minneapolis-St. Paul reached a record high of 46
degrees. Farther north, on the shore of Lake Superior, Duluth
reached a record 43 degrees. Duluth's normal high for Feb. 5 is 19
degrees.
   Elsewhere, however, more severe winter temperatures are firmly
in place in the interior of Alaska. For the 11th day in a row,
early morning temperatures Monday were in the 30-below-zero to
50-below-zero range and the cold is expected to continue until the
middle of the month, the weather service said.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 10
degrees above zero at Caribou, Maine, to 74 at Harlingen, Texas.
   Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 23 below zero at
Houlton, Maine.

<HEAD>Failed Wrapping May Have Cause Oil Pipeline Corrosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Improperly installed protective
wrapping may have caused most of the corrosion threatening the
trans-Alaska oil pipeline, and repairs may cost nearly $1 billion
over the next five years, officials say.
   ``Whether it will affect the integrity of the pipeline remains
yet to be seen,'' said Jack Overly, western regional division chief
for the federal Office of Pipeline Safety. ``We have not run into
anything to cause concern about its integrity.''
   The 48-inch-diameter pipeline was completed in 1977 at a cost of
about $8 billion and carries 1.9 million barrels of crude oil daily
from sprawling North Slope oil fields to a terminal in Valdez, 800
miles to the south.
   It is operated by the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. for a
consortium of the seven oil companies that own the line.
   There are no known leaks in the trans-Alaska oil pipeline,
Overly said.
   Nearly all of the corrosion is located on the outside of the
half-inch thick pipe wall, and nearly all of it occurs on buried
pipe.
   Overly said corrosion is common on buried pipelines. ``I've seen
them cause leaks, but I don't know of any that you'd say failed
because of corrosion,'' he said.
   Most of the serious corrosion was found in a nine-mile stretch
of pipeline buried in the Atigun flood plain, about 160 miles south
of Prudhoe Bay, Marnie Isaacs, spokeswoman for Alyeska, said Monday.
   ``That is quite an active flood plain,'' she said. ``There is a
lot of flowing water. There is a constant supply of oxygen. But
corrosion is always to be expected in buried pipe.''
   The pipeline generally operates about 1,100 pounds per square
inch, Isaacs said, but that's been reduced by about 17 percent in
the Atigun flood plain.
   The repair tab on the pipeline for this year alone is expected
to total $150 million, with expenditures over the next five years
estimated at just short of $1 billion.
   Partly because of the corrosion expenses, Alyeska has asked the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Alaska Public
Utilities Commission for permission to sharply increase the tariff
it charges to move oil through the line.
   Increased tariffs mean less income for the state, and Alaska
officials filed an objection with the federal agency. About 85
percent of the revenue received by Alaska's treasury comes from oil.
   Isaacs said the corrosion was discovered last year by a
mechanical ``pig,'' a device that moves through the line and
measures pipe wall thickness with ultrasound.
   So far, 800 anomalies in thickness have been pinpointed, Isaacs
said.
   The corrosion found has been given priorities based on its
possible effects on the line's operation.
   There are 116 Priority One anomalies which could affect pipeline
pressure, Isaacs said. ``We've investigated all of those. We
finished last week,'' she said.
   She said wrapping designed to protect the line has failed in
several spots, ``but most of them are in the nine-mile stretch at
Atigun. More than 75 percent are in a 13-mile stretch, with most of
that in the Atigun flood plain,'' she said.
   She said the outer wrapping in the Atigun area may have failed
because the installation was difficult.``That section of pipe was
installed in extremely adverse conditions. It was a winter
installation, in the bitter cold and wind. There is some thought
that may have compromised some of the wrap.''
   Alyeska plans to replace the troublesome nine-mile segment in
1991, Isaacs said. A new pipe will be buried next to the old line,
she said, and the pipeline should be shut down no more than about
two days.

<HEAD>Jewish Leaders Ask Bush To Help In Settling Soviet Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Jewish leaders asked President Bush
on Monday to appeal to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to
speak out against what they said was a resurgence of anti-Semitism
in the Soviet Union.
   Two dozen Jewish leaders, at a White House meeting, also
appealed to Bush for U.S. help to resettle the Soviet Jewish
refugees now flooding into Israel by the thousands.
   Seymour D. Reich, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of
Major American Jewish Organizations, praised Bush's own
denunciation of ``racism, anti-Semitism, bigotry and hate'' in last
week's State of the Union address.
   ``It would be helpful for (Gorbachev) to share those same
concerns with the Soviet people,'' said Reich, a New York lawyer
who is also president of B'nai B'rith, the Jewish fraternal
organization.
   ``I had a sense that he would clearly encourage President
Gorbachev to speak out, to still the fears of Soviet Jews and
others who are torn by ethnic strife,'' said Reich.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said later ``I suspect
(Bush) probably will'' communicate the Jewish leaders' concerns to
Gorbachev.
   Reich said the issue ``may very well be on the agenda'' of
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who arrives in Moscow later
this week for talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze.
   Reich said Jews in Eastern Europe have been ``haunted'' for
centuries by fears of pogroms, such as the organized persecution
and massacres of Jews that occurred in Czarist Russia.
   Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' in loosening state controls
on everyday life in the Soviet Union, has also opened the lid on
old ethnic rivalries in Azerbaijan and elsewhere and triggered an
upsurge of anti-Semitism, Soviet refugees say.
   Nearly 4,600 Soviet Jews emigrated to Israel last month and
Israeli officials are preparing for as many as 100,000 refugeees
this year.
   Israel will welcome them ``with open arms,'' said Reich, but he
added, ``The United States may be called upon to give assistance to
that settlement process.''
   On foreign aid, Reich said the Jewish leaders ``acknowledged
that the United States will be called upon to assist the blossoming
democracies in Europe. But that aid to those countries should stand
on their own.''
   ``Aid to Israel has to be measured against the fact that
glasnost has not come to the Middle East. There are still 20 Arab
countries still in a state of war and belligerency with Israel,
armed to the teeth, ready to destroy Israel if they had the
opportunity,'' said Reich.
   He said the Israeli government has not adopted a policy of
resettling Soviet Jews in the occupied territories. But he said
Israeli Prime Minister Yithzak Shamir last week told him that
``that Israel cannot pass a law to prevent that. Jews have a right
to live anyplace in the world, in any Arab country. ... Clearly
Jews should be permitted to live wherever they want.''
   Earlier Monday, Bush called Shamir and expressed condolences
over the deaths of Isreali tourists in a terrorist attack Sunday in
Egypt. At least nine Israelis were killed.
   ``This horrible act of terrorism should be condemned by
civilized people everywhere,'' presidential spokesman Fitzwater
said.

   Regrettably, we could not escape miscalculations and mistakes
during perestroika and this, too, has complicated the situation.
Social tension and anxiety are typical of it now. Elements of
apathy and disappointment have emerged. Such is the contradictory
but real situation.
   There is the danger, and the party should be mindful of this,

   We have already heard some allege that we have adopted an overly
steep course, threatening the very foundations of the socialist
system, and that there is no way out of the difficulties except by
a return to the former order.
   Others, on the contrary, allege that reforms aiming to bring out
the potential of the socialist system are doomed to failure and the
country can be rescued only through capitalization.
   We might not speak about this if these were only abstract
theoretical disputes or debates in political circles. But such
destructive judgments, penetrating into society, befuddle quite a

   Along with long-term matters, the draft platform puts forward
urgent tasks connected with the modern situation in the country.
This has paramount importance. We hoped to mount the peak of the
crisis in 1989, but recent events have shown that there has been no
change for the better.
   The recently published results of economic performance of the
past year revealed once again the contradictory nature of processes
in the economy. On one hand, a number of indices posted slight
growth despite considerable losses caused by strikes, ethnic
conflicts, lax discipline and mismanagement. More foodstuffs and
consumer goods have been produced.
   On the other hand, we can see further disruption of the consumer
market, a growth in shortages and queues, and a fall in the
purchasing power of the ruble. The situation is being worsened by
the activity of shadow economy dealers and criminal elements.
   People are especially dissatisfied with the food situation. The
question should be posed squarely. We worked out an innovative
agrarian policy and voted for it at the March plenary meeting. We
assess it as progressive and pointing to real ways out of the food
crisis.

   Yes, there are shortages of resources and technology. Yes,
social transformations must be conducted on a different scale and
at different rates. All this is true. But primary importance should
be assigned to restructuring relations of production in the
village. And the crux of the matter now is the position of our
cadre at the center and localities. This is a political rather than
an economic question. All obstacles should be removed in the way of

   I think that until now we have lacked resolve and this should be
overcome. This, particularly, concerns the main missing link that
caused the entire economic reform to stall _ the pricing system. It
is necessary to speed up the solution of this problem. The party
continues to stand on the principled position: The price reform
should not affect the standard of living, especially that of
low-income strata.
   We can no longer reconcile ourselves with the glaring
manifestations of mismanagement. Can we expect any effect from
credits that draw ridiculously small interest? Our interest is
found nowhere in the world. It is such that no one cares to return
credits because this interest does not change much, after all. This
explains why neither credit nor ruble work. This won't do at all.

   At a time when the country is rumbling, there is a shortage of

appearance of Republicans at rally; picks up 8th `The eight'</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Premier Hans Modrow of East Germany said
Monday his proposal that a reunited Germany be neutral was open to
discussion, and indicated he wants fewer Soviet soldiers stationed
in his country.
   Economics Minister Christa Luft said monetary union with West
Germany must be approached with care. Rapid introduction of the
West German mark would solve some immediate problems but create
others, she said.
   Parliament added eight representatives of pro-democracy groups
to the government, giving the opposition Cabinet seats for the
first time in East Germanty's 40-year history. It formally approved
March 18 for the first free elections and outlawed West Germany's
ultra-right Republican Party.
   Modrow's remarks in the televised Parliament session appeared to
soften his stance on neutrality. The reform-minded Communist said
his proposal last week was meant as a basis for discussing ways to
achieve German unity.
   About 100,000 people rallied in Leipzig Monday and speakers
called for quick reunification, the official news agency ADN
reported.
   One sign said ``Unity Now.'' West German flags waved in the
crowd and many deomonstrators carried anti-Communist signs.
   Leipzig has been at the heart of the pro-democracy movement, and
regular Monday rallies in the southern industrial city contributed
to the downfall of the Communist old guard in October. In recent
weeks, the rallies have become a focal point of support for
reunification.
   ADN said a group of Republicans distributed leaflets, carried
signs and used bullhorns to publicize the West German party's
goals. It said they also marched and raised their arms in the Nazi
salute.
   Republicans have attended recent Leipzig rallies. The party has
said it wanted to run in the East Germany elections.
   The eight new ministers will have no portfolios in the interim
Cabinet that is governing the until the elections. With 17 seats,
the Communists became a minority in the 36-member government for
the first time.
   Government and opposition officials spoke out against West
German politicians making campaign appearances for East German
parties during the campaign. West German party leaders said,
however, that they would continue campaigning for sister parties in
the East.
   Modrow said Monday his proposal of a neutral united Germany
meant military neutrality, which appeared to leave open the
possibility of political ties with the Western alliance.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany has rejected the concept
of neutrality for a united Germany, as have the United States and
other kmembers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German foreign minister, has
suggested the united country remain in the alliance, but that NATO
military structures not extend to what is now East Germany.
   In Parliament on Monday, Modrow said: ``There is opposition to
the idea of a military, I repeat, military neutralization of the
future joint Germany. Well, then, we should discuss this point of
contention so that we can come to an acceptable solution that would
respect security needs of all those involved.''
   ``Why not, for example, start with a reduction of reciprocal
military presence on the territory of the present two German
sttes?''
   The premier said his proposal last week that a united Germany be
neutral was not meant to be the final word on the matter.
   ``I never believed all points of my proposals would be accepted
by everyone,'' he said. ``I made my proposals ... to create
conditions for the inevitable process of unification of the German
states. The German nation, despite all attempts to dismantle it,
has never been lost,'' he added.
   He said several obstacles must be overcome because the two
Germanys have vastly different legal and financial structures.
   Mrs. Luft said at the weekly talks between the government and
opposition that quick introduction of the West Germany mark would
ease some supply problems, broaden the possibilities for travel and
force companies to become more competitive.
   She cautioned, however, that the flight of East Germans would
not stop because pay would remain below that in the Westm,
unprofitable enterprises would have to close, workers would be laid
off and savings would be threatened.
   East Germans should decide the issue in a referendum, Mrs. Luft
said. Theo Weigel, the West German finance minister, has
recommended introduction of the currency.
   More than 50,000 East Germans went to West Germany in January
alone, following 340,000 who resettled there last year.
   The East Germans leaving because of the slow progress of reforms
and the prospect of being paid in valuable West German marks
instead of East German currency, which is not convertible.
   West Germany also wants to stem the flow because of the strain
placed on social services by the new arrivals.
   Mrs. Luft said West Germany should provide East Germany with
immediate, interest-free aid of $5.8 billion to $8.8 billion.

   POLITICAL POWER _ The Soviet Communist Party, now given
exclusive political power by the country's constitution, must prove
its worthiness to remain the country's ruling party. It will reject
any political or legal advantages and will struggle for people's
support along with other political and public organizations.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MULTIPARTY SYSTEM _ Political changes fostered by Gorbachev's
reforms already have begun to create political pluralism. That may
lead to competing political parties being formed. The Communist
Party is ready to work with any organizations that accept the
Soviet Constitution and are not intent on destroying its socialist
structure.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PARTY REFORMS _ The party must move up from October to summer
its next congress, the meeting of its most powerful body that can
elect a new leadeship. It should make its internal workings more
democratic, and must review the key Leninist concept of democratic
centralism that requires strict adherence once a decision is made
at the top. The size of the policy-making Central Committee should
be reduced.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GOVERNMENT AND ECONOMY _ The party must no longer dictate to the
government or to economic managers. The Soviet economy was expected
to turn the corner in 1989, but failed to show improvement.
Soldiers were sent to the Azerbaijan republic on Jan. 20 because
thousands of lives were at risk and the danger existed of
nationalists' seizing power.

   A U.S. Air Force F-111 bomber with a crew of two
crashed into the sea off east England during a routine training
missing Monday. The British Defense Ministry said one body was
recovered and a search was under way for the second crew member.
   The coast guard at Great Yarmouth said two U.S. Air Force
helicopters and two local rescue boats searched by the light of
flares after nightfall.
   The F-111 plunged into the water over a sea firing range known
as Wainfleet.
   ``The aircraft crashed ... in The Wash and a lot of debris has
been found,'' said a coast guard spokesman, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   The Wash is a shallow bay of the North Sea.
   U.S. Air Force spokesman Sgt. Michael Devine said the bomber _
based at Upper Heyford, 50 miles northwest of London _ was on a
run-of-the-mill training mission.
   Upper Heyford is one of two British bases for the U.S. bombers,
which are capable of carrying nuclear weapons.

   People are becoming more and more aware as to where separatist
nationalist, especially extremist, slogans may lead and what they
can entail for people, nationalities and the whole country.
   We must display principled approaches in opposing nationalism,
chauvinism and separatism and, at the same time, understand that
ethnic problems are no fantasy, they are real and are waiting to be
solved by perestroika.
   The sooner decisions are taken to delimit the competence of the
union and that of republics, to actually strengthen their political
and economic independence, to broaden the rights of ethnic
autonomies and to achieve the harmonious development of all
languages and cultures, the sooner people will see the enormous
advantages of the new Soviet federation.
   Separatists, chauvinists and nationalists of all kinds
understand this well and are trying to use the growth of peoples'
national self-consciousness for their selfish aims. They evidently
want to deliver a preventive strike at perestroika, which threatens
to thwart their far-reaching plans.
   This has been patently manifest in the recent developments in
Azerbaijan and Armenia.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   I would like to draw your attention to the principled aspect of
the problem. The conflict is centred round Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Serious problems accumulated in the economic and cultural
development of this autonomous region and the central committee,
and the government took major measures to solve them.
   There appeared hope that this tight knot could be undone and the
situation could be improved, but such prospects did not suit
certain forces in both republics and in Nagorno-Karabakh itself.
   Those for whom perestroika is a thorn in the side and who are
afraid of democratization and glasnost, ignore laws. I am speaking
about representatives of the shadow economy, a veritable mafia
which is fanning the flames of ethnic strife and putting pressure
on state bodies under the slogans of national revival.
   The conduct of the authorities and party bodies in both
republics, which yielded one position after another under pressure,
does them no credit.
   Unfortunately, many representatives of the intelligentsia in
Azerbaijan and Armenia failed to correctly assess the situation, to
find the real causes of the conflict and exert a positive influence
on developments.
   Meanwhile, corrupted anti-perestroika forces managed to take the
lead and direct misled people's actions into the destructive
channel.
   I should say that there has been, perhaps, no other issue in the
past two years that has been given so much attention in Moscow.
   The initial position of the center was that the Nagorno-Karabakh
conflict should be settled in such a way that would leave no
winners and no losers. Otherwise, new flare-ups of hostility and
violence, new victims and losses would be inevitable.
   We continued to adhere to this position also at the height of
the conflict. And still, we failed to check the aggravation of the
situation.
   Late last year, in a difficult situation, the supreme bodies of
power in both republics took decisions that aggravated the
situation still more. The republics found themselves on the brink
of all-out war.
   Armed groups from both sides began clashing, they began to seize
weapons and attack troops and law enforcement bodies and tightened
the blockade of railways and roads.
   Baku became the scene of brutal pogroms. If the state of
emergency had not been introduced in Nagorno-Karabakh, in some
border areas and then in Baku, the blood of not dozens, but of
thousands upon thousands of people would have been shed.

   The key fact is that nationalist, anti-Soviet groups openly
encroached on the constitutional system, strove for power and
sought to establish a dictatorship _ not a democracy _ by naked
force and through militant nationalism.
   This was in fact a coup attempt _ nothing more, nothing less.
All structures, above all military ones, had been prepared for that.
   And the flirtation of some political forces with this wing of
the Azerbaijani popular front only reveals their own goals.

   It is now up to the peoples of the two republics and their party

life will be restored and the state of emergency lifted.
   Surely, everything must be done to resolve as soon as possible
the problems of Nagorno-Karabakh _ urgent, primary ones _ and those
problems that have emerged around it _ given strict observance of
constitutional principles, including Azerbaijan's integrity.
   Comrades, the logic of the struggle for perestroika has led to
new major decisions. The U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet will soon adopt
laws on ownership, on land, on local self-government and local
economy, on the tax system, on the delineation of the competence of
the union as a whole and of the constituent republics, and other
fundamental legislative acts.
   The second stage of political reform has been launched,
encompassing the formation of governing bodies at republican and
local levels.

   Indeed, society is acquiring a new quality. But the processes
that the party consciously activated, which will undoubtedly bring
forth positive results, have not been insured, as we already see,
against manifestations of instability, weakened management and
centrifugal tendencies.
   The effect is making itself felt on society, causing
misunderstanding of these phenomena and anxiety of the people.
   At present, from the viewpoint of strategic tasks and in view of
current realities, it is necessary to realign forces in the upper
echelons of power in order to give more dynamism to perestroika
processes and ensure more firmly their irreversibility.

<HEAD>Most Customers of Check-Cashing Services Have Bank Accounts:
Survey</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A survey released Monday of people who use
check-cashing services said that two-thirds had bank or savings and
loan accounts.
   The Consumer Bankers Association surveyed 505 customers in five
cities _ Washington, New York, Miami, Chicago and Los Angeles.
   Even though check-cashing services are more expensive, most
respondents said they used the services for convenience: they had
longer hours, were eaiser to reach, had shorter lines or faster
service.
   The survey was conducted by The Roper Organization Inc. in
October and December. Customers were quizzed outside of five
check-cashing outlets in each city.
   Consumer advocates are backing legislation by Sen. Henry B.
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, to require banks and S&amp;Ls to cash Social
Security and other government checks and to offer so-called basic
banking accounts with low fees.
   Joe Belew, president of the bankers group, said the poll
suggests ``such legislation is unneccessary'' and indicates
check-cashing services are not flourishing because banks have
shunned poor customers.
   If high check-cashing fees are a problem, Congress should
consider regulating check-cashing outlets, he said.
   Last month, consumer advocates released surveys saying that
check-cashing fees continue to climb; that only 14 percent of banks
quizzed in New York, New Jersey, Oregon and California offer
low-cost checking accounts, and that most Americans support forcing
banks to offer low-cost accounts.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Monday ordered former
President Reagan to give a videotaped deposition for the
Iran-Contra trial of John Poindexter, and to turn over 33 entries
from his diary immediately to his former national security adviser.
   ``Former President Reagan's testimony will be taken by way of a
videotaped deposition'' at ``an appropriate place and a date''
before the Feb. 20 start of Poindexter's trial, said U.S. District
Judge Harold Greene.
   Reagan promptly invoked executive privilege to avoid turning
portions of his diaries over to Poindexter. ``Former President
Reagan hereby asserts his claim to the constitutionally protected
privacy of his diaries,'' said Theodore Olson, one of Reagan's
attorneys.
   The judge's order gave Reagan and the Bush administration until
Friday to invoke executive privilege on the matter of videotaped
testimony.
   In Los Angeles, Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg refused comment
on the order for a videotaped deposition, but said the former
president was invoking executive privilege regarding the diary
entries to give his lawyers time to ``evaluate the need'' for them.
   Invoking executive privilege will enable Reagan to gain access
to a secret filing with Greene in which Pointdexter told why he
needs the diaries.
   After examining Poindexter's document, Reagan will be able to
determine whether the excerpts contain admissible evidence not
available from other sources. ``If so, the former president may
decide to waive his claim of privilege,'' Olson said.
   Greene ruled that he will allow Poindexter to question Reagan on
a wide range of subjects in the Iran-Contra affair. Poindexter gave
the court a list of 183 questions he wants to ask Reagan, and the
judge said he would be allowed to ask all but 30 of them.
Specifically, Greene said:
   _Poindexter will be permitted to ask Reagan whether he approved
Poindexter's denials to Congress that former White House national
security staffer Oliver L. North was raising money and providing
military advice to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Poindexter is charged with obstruction and conspiracy in
connection with those denials. The responses sent to Congress by
Poindexter embraced false denials about North's involvement which
had been sent to Congress in 1985 by Poindexter's predecessor,
Robert McFarlane.
   _Poindexter will be allowed to ask Reagan about ``the
president's knowledge regarding the relationship of Oliver North
with specific individuals involved in Iran-Contra activities.''
   The president told the investigative Tower Board on Jan. 26,
1987, that he did not know the National Security Council staff was
engaged in helping the Contras. ``The board is aware of no evidence
to suggest that the president was aware of Lt. Col. North's
activities,'' said the board's final report.
   ``Since he first told the American people about the diversion of
funds from the Iran arms sale, President Reagan has cooperated
fully with all of the legislative and judicial inquiries into this
matter, including the Tower Commission which he appointed to
conduct a thorough investigation,'' Reagan spokesman Weinberg said
in a statement.
   Greene renewed his order that Reagan immediately furnish
Poindexter with diary excerpts pertaining to U.S. arms sales to
Iran and the Reagan administration's secret assistance to the
Contras.
   The Justice Department's request to push back the deadline for
surrendering the diary entries ``is nothing more than an attempt to
delay'' and is ``out of the question,'' Greene said.
   The Justice Department had asked Greene to order Iran-Contra
prosecutors and Poindexter to attempt to resume negotiations on a
summary of the diary entries. Earlier negotiations broke down
partly because Poindexter declined to tell prosecutors what he
expected to prove through Reagan's testimony.
   Poindexter and Reagan had objected to having the former
president give a videotaped deposition. Poindexter wants Reagan as
a witness in the courtroom. Reagan is resisting giving testimony in
any form, on the ground that compelling him to testify would have
an adverse effect on the presidency.
   In ordering President Nixon to provide White House tape
recordings to Watergate prosecutors, the Supreme Court ruled in
1974 that ``the general assertion of privilege must yield to the
demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal
trial.''
   In endorsing the videotape approach, Greene said:
   ``There is an absence of a direct precedent in 200 years of
American history for the compelled testimony in a courtroom by an
incumbent or former president.''
   Greene said while that fact should not determine whether Reagan
should testify, ``it does call for a sense of caution by this
court.''
   Videotaped testimony would protect the rights of the former
president and the privileges of the presidency, Greene said.
   A videotaped deposition will allow evidence to be taken with
recesses for consultations on invoking executive privilege ``or the
handling of sensitive defense information,'' the judge said.
   ``Former President Ronald Reagan is claimed by Adm. Poindexter
to have direct and important knowledge that will help to exonerate
him from the criminal charges lodged against him,'' Greene said in
a 54-page decision.
   ``In view of the prior professional relationship between the two
men, ... that claim cannot be dismissed as fanciful or frivolous,''
the judge said.
   Greene said ``it would be inconceivable ... to exempt Mr. Reagan
from the duty of every citizen to give evidence that will permit
the reaching of a just outcome of this criminal prosecution.''
   The judge rejected a suggestion by Reagan's lawyers that the
former president be permitted to give written answers to written
questions from Poindexter.
   Poindexter has said Reagan took notes at meetings focusing on
congressional inquiries into North's activities to help the Contras.
   The former national security adviser also has said that his
meetings with Reagan also dealt with the accuracy of a chronology
prepared by North on a 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   North was convicted of aiding and abetting an obstruction of
Congress because the chronology falsely stated that no official of
the U.S. government learned before January 1986 that Hawk missiles
had been shipped to Iran in the CIA-assisted delivery in November
1985.

<HEAD>FBI Agents Look Over Typewriters in Mail Bomb Investigation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ENTERPRISE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents looked over three
typewriters Monday at a piano store in the hunt for a crucial piece
of evidence in their mail bomb investigation.
   Store manager Dean Powers said FBI agents were interested in
typewriters bought at an auction at nearby Fort Rucker Army Base.
   The agents examined one electric typewriter and two manual
typewriters but did not remove them from the store, Powers said.
   A swarm of FBI agents has spent the last two weeks scouring
southeast Alabama for the typewriter used to write letters linked
to the December mail bomb killings of 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals Judge Robert Vance and Savannah, Ga., lawyer Robert
Robinson.
   ``We are still searching for a typewriter,'' said Tom Moore, an
FBI spokesman in Birmingham.
   No arrests have been made.
   In Atlanta, about 200 judges, lawyers, friends and relatives of
Vance passed through tight security to attend a memorial service in
a federal courtroom just a few feet from Vance's chambers.
   Among those who spoke at the service were U.S. Supreme Court
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who supervises the three states of the
11th Circuit: Alabama, Florida and Georgia.
   ``If we adhere to the law, civilized conduct and decent people _
people like Robert Vance _ will prevail,'' Kennedy said. ``So in
the midst of grief and our sympathy ... we reaffirm the duty and
dignity of the law.''
   Two mail bombs were intercepted at the Jacksonville, Fla., NAACP
office and the 11th Circuit courthouse in Atlanta. The threat to
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
aroused fears that the bombings were racially motivated. That
concern was heightened by a letter from an obscure group claiming
responsibility for them.
   Ken Holder, a spokesman for Fort Rucker, said typewriters are
sold at periodic auctions on the Army base.
   The FBI searches in Enterprise have focused on a salvage store
owner, Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, and print shop operator Brian Joseph
Fleming, who has been a member of the Coffee County NAACP chapter
for three years.
   Holder said O'Ferrell was a registered bidder at the Fort Rucker
auctions, but the spokesman said anyone who has a junk business
probably would show up at the bidding.
   O'Ferrell has denied any knowledge of the bombings. He came
under scrutiny because he had an employment compensation case that
he lost on appeal before a three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit,
including Vance, and because of alleged similarities in O'Ferrell's
typed correspondence and typewritten material sent by the apparent
mail bomber.
   ``I hope someone will pinch me and awaken me from this
nightmare,'' O'Ferrell said Monday.
   O'Ferrell said he has been to at least three sales at Fort
Rucker and has purchased typewriters.
   An attorney for Fleming said that his client's print shop and
home were searched Friday probably because of Fleming's indictment
on charges of conspiring to export weapons, reportedly to Northern
Ireland. Fleming has pleaded innocent to the charges, and is free
on $50,000 bond.

<HEAD>Texas Governor Says U.S. In No Position To Seek Foreign Colldier
Help</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Energy Department is in no position now to
seek foreign funds to build the super collider and no one overseas
is in a position to make such a commitment, Texas Gov. Bill
Clements said Monday.
   Clements, whose state will be host to the 53-miles-around
machine, said after meeting with Energy Secretary James Watkins the
Energy Department is not prepared to request foreign help until
Congress has ``completely endorsed'' the collider and foreign
countries have been assured of its total costs and design.
   Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala., chairman of the House appropriations
subcommittee with jurisdiction over the collider, however, was
adamant last year that the department come up with a plan to share
the cost of the collider with foreign countries.
   That plan is still being drafted but has been classified, said
Department spokesman Jeff Sherwood.
   Sherwood said the draft had been classified because it
represents the government's ``negotiating position'' with potential
contributors.
   Clements said foreign participants, however, should not be
sought ``until our plans are very definitive and until the Congress
is totally on board with the whole project.''
   ``We're not in a position to ask for (foreign help). Certainly
no one overseas is in a position to make a commitment for `X'
dollars until they know what `Y' cost is, and until Congress has
completely endorsed the program. And so foreign participation,
which everybody likes to talk about, is premature to talk about at
this point,'' Clements said.
   Only India has publicly announced it was willing to contribute
to the collider, up to $50 million.
   President Bush is seeking a $318 million appropriation for the
collider in next year's budget. Bush last year requested $250
million and Congress voted $225 million for the current fiscal year.
   The collider, when completed late in the decade, will allow
scientists to test theories about the fundamental nature of matter
by smashing together beams of protons at 20 times the energy now
possible.
   The original cost, estimate at $5.9 billion, will rise by $1
billion to $2 billion if the original design is maintained, a
course Watkins has indicated he favors.

   The former wife of convicted spy John A.
Walker Jr. says her peace has been shattered by a television series
about his spy ring, one of the most damaging espionage cases in the
nation's history.
   The series, based loosely on two books about John A. Walker
Jr.'s career as a spy for the Soviet Union, has reopened old
wounds, Barbara Joy Crowley Walker said in a telephone interview
with The Cape Cod Times on Saturday night.
   Mrs. Walker, 51, lives on Cape Cod but asked that the location
of the house she shares with a daughter and grandson not be
disclosed.
   CBS broadcast the first of two parts of ``Family of Spies: The
Walker Spy Ring,'' on Sunday night. The second part is scheduled
for Tuesday night. Mrs. Walker said she saw excerpts but did not
plan to watch the series.
   Mrs. Walker said she is upset that she is being portrayed as
weak and ineffectual, and as an alcoholic. She is hurt that her
children will relive a time in their lives that was ``an absolute
nightmare.''
   Mrs. Walker and her husband were divorced in 1976, and she
turned in her husband to authorities in 1984, unaware that her son
was involved in the ring.
   Walker, a retired Navy communications specialist, had recruited
his son, brother and a friend as members of the spy ring. He
pleaded guilty in 1985 to spying for the Soviets for 17 years and
was sentenced to life in prison.
   Mrs. Walker worries that the public will not understand that her
son, Michael Lance Walker, 27, now serving a 25-year sentence in
federal prison, ``did all he did because he so desperately loved
his father.''
   ``I know what happened was news and now it is one for the
history books,'' she said. ``But now my life, or at least some
screenwriter's version of it, is being shown on the television, not
as news, not as history, but as entertainment for millions of
people.
   ``Let me tell you, what my children suffered and what they
continue to suffer has nothing to do with entertainment.''
   Sunday night's program carried the following disclaimer:
``Certain events and characters portrayed herein have been
fictionalized.''
   Disclaimer or not, Mrs. Walker believes people will see the show
and believe it.
   Gerry Abrams, the co-executive producer of the miniseries, said
those affiliated with the project had been in touch with Mrs.
Walker for the past four years. He said she had been paid a fee for
the rights to her story, but would not give the amount.
   Mrs. Walker said the past five years have been spent ``trying to
heal the wounds.'' She has sought to help her three daughters, all
in their 30s, deal with the conflicts caused by loving their father
while hating what he did.
   ``John Walker is not a horrible person. He is just a very sad
man who took the path of least resistance,'' she said.

   An explosion blasted out the roof of a thermal
power plant in Azerbaijan and disrupted electricity in the troubled
republic, Tass reported Monday, without explaining if the damage
was accidental.
   Ethnic and nationalist violence has wracked Azerbaijan for
weeks. Soviet army troops, sent into Azerbaijan last month to
restore calm after bloody attacks on ethnic Armenians, are supposed
to be guarding key industrial points, including power plants.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev spoke of the unrest there
at a meeting in Moscow Monday of the Communist Party Central
Committee. He said the soldiers were sent to protect thousands of
lives and prevent a seizure of political power.
   The official Soviet news agency said the blast occurred Sunday
in one of the power plant's four generating units outside
Mingechaur, 280 miles northwest of Baku. Tass said the unit was
just going into operation when the explosion ripped off the roof
and started a fire. Workers and firemen contained the blaze but
shut down the other three units, it said.
   ``A special commission has been set up to investigate the causes
of the incident,'' Tass said. It said the plant is one of the
biggest in the southern Trancaucasus.
   It said two generators have been restarted, and a third is
nearing operating condition. Each has a capacity of 300 megawatts.
   Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, remained quiet Monday, Tass
said. A general strike apparently continues, however. Tass said
more than 50 percent of the workforce in light industry is showing
up.
   A reduced curfew runs from midnight to 5 a.m., reported
Interfax, a service of Radio Moscow. It said a stolen T-34 tank was
recovered in Armenia's Artasat district on Saturday.
   Interfax quoted Ashot Manucharian, a spokesman for the Armenian
National Movement, as saying talks with representatives of the
Azerbaijani People's Front may resume after a situation in
Azerbaijan is clarified. Negotiations being held in Riga, Latvia,
between the two broad-based political movements broke off over the
weekend when it was reported that Azerbaijani People's Front
activists were forcing Armenians from their homes in two villages.
   Gorbachev, obviously stung by criticism of his handling of
ethnic unrest in the Caucasus Mountain region, said Monday:
   ``The key fact is that nationalist, anti-Soviet groups openly
encroached on the constitutional system, strove for power and
sought to establish a dictatorship _ not a democracy _ by naked
force and through militant nationalism.''
   He said ``the blood of not dozens, but of thousands upon
thousands of people would have been shed'' if the central
government had not declared a state of emergency.
   In an address in which he told the party's policy-making body
that Communists must yield their monopoly on political power,
Gorbachev spent a surprising amount of time defending his actions
to control an ethnic hotspot.
   Soldiers moved into Baku on Jan. 20, about a week after attacks
began against ethnic Armenians.
   More than 100 people died after the army moved into Baku. The
death toll in the latest outbreak of ethnic violence centered on
control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan has reached at
least 214.
   Azerbaijani nationalists accused Gorbachev of trying not to save
lives but to break the People's Front political movement by sending
in soldiers.
   Other critics said he should have reacted more decisively long
ago to the Armenia-Azerbaijan dispute.
   ``I would say there has been, perhaps, no other issue in the
past two years that has been given so much attention in Moscow,''
Gorbachev said.
   He said the Kremlin tried to solve Nagorno-Karabakh's problems
by improving living conditions, but enemies of his reform program
thwarted the effort.
   Gorbachev said party leaders in the area succumbed to extreme
demands rather than resist them.

   European Community foreign ministers
lent support Monday to the channeling of economic and other aid to
Eastern Europe as the nations there become more democratic.
   The ministers of the 12-nation trading bloc expressed
willingness to include Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, East Germany,
Romania and Yugoslavia in an aid program set up last summer for
only Poland and Hungary.
   At the end of their meeting, the ministers issued a statement
saying aid ``should be provided on the basis of commitments from
the countries concerned to political and economic reform.''
   ``In addition, the program of assistance should be adapted to
each country's own situation,'' the ministers said.
   They supported plans of the European Commission, the community's
executive body, to complete agreements by June to expand trade with
East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania.
   The community already has broad trade agreements with Poland,
Hungary and the Soviet Union that lift quotas and give their
products greater access to West European markets.
   A smaller arrangement with Czechoslovakia is to be expanded, and
bargaining is under way with East Germany and Bulgaria is under way.
   Foreign Minister Gerard Collins of Ireland said the community
wants to treat Eastern Europe with a ``flexible and responsible
attitude, so as to arrive at the solutions appropriate to the
situations and problems and needs of each country concerned.''
   Ireland now holds the rotating presidency of the community,
which is at the center of the Western attempt to help the East
European nations. Last summer, the trading bloc was put in charge
of an effort by 24 Western nations to develop an economic aid
program for Poland and Hungary.
   Western officials have indicated since that they wanted to
expand help for other Eastern European countries moving toward
democracy and free markets.
   Officials of the 24 nations will meet Feb. 16 Brussels for more
discussions of aid.
   The foreign ministers discussed a European Commission plan to
sign ``association'' agreements with some nations of the East bloc
that would bring them closer to the European Community but stop
short of full membership.
   Their statement said the ministers ``noted with interest the
commission's views and suggestions,'' but did not commit them to
the association concept.
   Commission officials told the ministers they would take a new
look at the community budget for the next three years seeking
sources of money for aid to Eastern Europe.
   Members of the European Community are Belgium, Britain, West
Germany, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark,
Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece. Monday's discussions were held
at the regular Council of Ministers meeting.

<HEAD>Federal Judge's Trial Starts With Ruling Allowing Wiretaps</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge accused of using his office
to do favors for convicted felons went on trial Monday after a
ruling allowing the use of wiretape evidence vital to the
goverment's case against him.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar, 58, is charged in eight
felony counts of racketeering with using his office as a
``racketeering enterprise'' to obstruct justice.
   Among the charges are allegations that Aguilar approached two
fellow judges to try to influence the outcomes of cases, that he
helped his former secretary remain a fugitive, that he tipped off a
co-defendant about wiretaps and that he told a witness to lie to
the grand jury.
   As jury selection began, prosecutors unveiled a witness list
that includes three other federal judges, Aguilar's former
girlfriend, two of his brothers and a nephew. Lawyers expect the
trial to last six weeks.
   Conviction carries maximum penalties of 55 years in prison and
$2 million in fines. Aguilar, who has remained in office and is
handling some cases, can be removed only by Congress. He is a 1980
appointee of President Carter and is based in San Jose.
   Defense lawyers, speaking before a gag order was imposed in the
case, accused the Justice Department of targeting Aguilar as a
liberal Hispanic who has ruled against the government in important
cases.
   Aguilar is the fourth federal judge to be indicted in this
decade. The others, Harry Claiborne of Nevada, Alcee Hastings of
Florida and Walter Nixon of Mississippi, were all impeached and
removed by Congress, although Hastings was acquitted of the
criminal charge against him.
   Aguilar's co-defendants are Rudy Tham, 66, a former Teamster
leader and convicted embezzler, and Abe Chapman, 83, a self-styled
former mobster who is related to Aguilar by marriage.
   U.S. District Judge Louis Bechtle, a visiting judge from
Philadelphia who is presiding over the trial, finished a series of
pretrial rulings generally unfavorable to the defense by rejecting
motions to prohibit wiretap evidence against Aguilar and his
co-defendants.
   Aguilar's home and chambers were wiretapped for several months
beginning in January 1988, and he was also tape-recorded by one of
Tham's lawyers who was cooperating with the FBI.
   Aguilar is accused of approaching two other federal judges
seeking favorable treatment for Tham and another man; of trying to
help Tham get a new trial while Tham arranged a job for Aguilar's
brother; and of tipping Chapman that his phone was being tapped.
   Bechtle also denied motions by Tham and Chapman for separate
trials.

<HEAD>Agriculture Secretary: Rural Electric Agency Will Survive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IKE FLORES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal money-lending agency for rural
electric cooperatives that serve about 25 million people will not
be dismantled by the Bush administration, Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter said Monday.
   He warned, however, that the Rural Electrification
Administration, which is part of his department, is in for some
changes in the way it operates.
   ``We need to make it a more-efficient administration,'' Yeutter
told about 12,000 people at the National Rural Electric Cooperative
Association's annual meeting.
   The association represents the nation's 1,000 non-profit,
consumer-owned rural electric systems in 46 states. It is a major
recipient of loans from the REA, which was created in 1935.
   During Ronald Reagan's administration, White House officials and
some congressional leaders proposed a phaseout of the REA,
contending it was unneeded and inefficient.
   ``There will be no more confrontational mode. ... That will
never happen during the Bush administration,'' Yeutter said to
cheers from the crowd of rural leaders from around the country.
   But because of current budget priorities, REA will ``not be able
to afford the level of direct lending we've had in the past,'' he
said.
   The REA's budget for the current fiscal year is about $1.4
billion, said association spokesman Thomas Hoy. The Bush
administration proposes cutting the agency's budget in the next
fiscal year to $200 million, an 86 percent reduction, Hoy said.
   Hoy called the proposed cut ``devastating.''
   Bob Bergland, a former Agriculture secretary who heads the
Washington, D.C.-based association, was scheduled to address the
48th annual meeting Tuesday to detail the potential impact of the
reduction on rural electric programs.
   Officials of President Bush's administration said in a recently
announced rural development plan that they want REA to take a
strong role in rural economic development efforts.
   Yeutter said one of the future challenges for REA and rural
leaders in general will be providing leadership in non-farm
programs, such as clean air and groundwater protection and
development of alternative fuels.
   The administration is setting up a president's council on rural
America to advise federal officials. It also wants to set up state
rural development councils and demonstration programs.

   People welcome what has been done to enhance the role of
legislative bodies and divide the functions of party and state
bodies. At the same time, they express clear dissatisfaction with
the lack of decisive actions where they are needed.
   The question has been raised to form an institute of presidency
with all necessary powers to implement the policy of perestroika.
The draft platform naturally speaks about this concisely, stressing
the need to act without delay.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Democratization and creating a law-based state and a
self-governing socialist society remain the principal directions of
our development.
   Comrades, naturally the draft platform speaks about the
international aspect of perestroika, about the modern world outlook
that defines our foreign policy strategy.
  
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   This policy meets our internal requirements, strengthens the
international positions of the Soviet state, raises its prestige,
favors forming civilized relations all over the world and brings
mankind closer to a peaceful period in its development.
   The all-important thing for us now is to push forward the
negotiating disarmament process, deepen dialogue and mutual
understanding on crucial sections of international development, and
facilitate in every way efforts to expand and strengthen the ground
that was covered in building a common European home.
   It is important to upgrade within its framework allied relations
with East European countries, which really need this.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   The situation in the world did improve in recent years, but the
danger of war is still preserved. The doctrines and concepts of the
United States and NATO, which are far from being defensive, remain
in force. Their armies and military budgets also exist.
   This is why we need well-trained and well-equipped armed forces.
Certainly, they need improvement and restructuring. But there
should be a more responsible approach to changing the principle of
their staffing and their construction as a whole in the context of
changes in the world situation.
   Some questions have arisen in view of the ongoing and possible
reductions in troops and armaments. Specifically, apprehensions are
expressed if this does not weaken the country's defense capability.
Evidently, additional explanations are necessary here to show that
the reduction and reorganization of the armed forces is being
carried out strictly in conformity with the principle of reasonable
sufficiency for defense, reliable defence.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   And one more serious issue. It concerns mass media coverage of
life in the army and the navy. It should be truthful and respectful
to the Soviet army, to officers' and soldiers' military service. We
cannot agree with anti-army propaganda. Our people will not allow
this.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Comrades, I want to say for one more time that the pivotal idea
of restructuring the party itself is in asserting the power of
party masses. In this connection, we are to recomprehend, among
others, the role of primary organizations in what concerns
admission to the party and quitting it, using membership dues, and
implementing the tasks related to the new role of the party as the
political vanguard.
   The role of district and city organizations should be revised
and their rights should be considerably broadened. We should change
the system of forming party bodies at all levels.
   We need a new, effective election mechanism that should also be
sealed in the rules.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The future rules should definitely say that all elective bodies,
from top to bottom, must be under control of and accountable to
Communists and that the apparatus must be under control of and
accountable to elective bodies.
   We have long been concerned by the fact that inner-life of the
party and its functioning do not give party members the possibility
to participate regularly in the formation of its policy.
   Much has been said about it but still we have no mechanism to
translate this idea into life.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   We should call for the vigorous representation of the most
active, advanced workers and farmers, who are well-known in the
party, in all elective bodies of the party, including the Central
Committee.
   Glasnost in the work of the party's leadership, including the
Central Committee and bodies elected by it, should be ensured on a
larger scale than before. Then Communists will know everything and
will be able to make conscientious judgments, conclusions and
proposals.
   We are increasing Communists' real participation in the
formation of the policy also by giving party bodies the possibility
to develop their own platforms on various problems of social
development in the context of one or another region.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The draft platform includes a proposal on changing the structure
of the upper party bodies. The meaning of this proposal is not just
to rename them and thus show our readiness for renewal.
   They are intended to strengthen the factor of democratization in
the party leadership and simultaneously to create the best
conditions for its activity as a working collective.
   One may ask, why reduce the Central Committee? Let us discuss
it. We proceeded from the need to turn the Central Committee into a
body working on a permanent basis.
   We should also depart from the principle of electing to the
Central Committee mainly people holding certain posts. This
principle was actually an expression of the party-and-state system
of power in the country.
   We think these changes will help strengthen the Central
Committee's ties with party organizations, because these ties will
be maintained not through the apparatus but mainly through elected
members of the Central Committee. ...
   It would be appropriate to speak here also about the central
party apparatus. It is clear that the change of the party's role
should entail changes in the qualitative composition of the
apparatus. It should become an assistant of the Central Committee
and work strictly under its control.

   A pregnant nurse and her husband were stabbed
to death by masked Palestinians Monday on suspicion of
collaborating with Israel, and doctors were unable to save their
unborn child, Arab reports said.
   Army sources confirmed the deaths in the town of Khan Yunis in
the occupied Gaza Strip and said police were investigating.
   The slayings of Jamil Rizik El-Bayouk, 45, and his wife,
Intissar, 40, followed the weekend slayings of two other suspected
collaborators in the Gaza Strip and the discovery of an alleged
collaborator's body near the West Bank town of Tulkarem.
   Arab reports said the West Bank victim, Rafeek Shawahneh, 35,
from the village of Kufr Thulth, was stabbed and beaten to death.
He was kidnapped two days earlier, and the reports said he was
suspected of collaborating and selling land to Israelis.
   The deaths raised to 181 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs during the nearly 26-month-old Palestinian uprising
against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Most have
been slain on suspicion of collaboration, but some were killed for
alleged drug dealing or prostitution.
   Since the revolt began in December 1987, 651 Palestinians have
been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians, and 43 Israelis have
died.
   Collaborator killings have declined in the West Bank since an
appeal issued in mid-December on behalf of PLO leader Yasser Arafat
to show more caution in dealing with suspected traitors. But such
killings have continued in the Gaza Strip, where Islamic
fundamentalist groups operate alongside pro-PLO factions.
   Arab reports said Mrs. El-Bayouk was seven months pregnant and
that doctors at Nasser Hospital performed an emergency Caesarian
section but were unable to save her child. Mrs. El-Bayouk worked as
a nurse at the hospital.
   On Oct. 26, a nurse was stabbed to death inside Nasser Hospital,
and several weeks later another nurse from the same hospital
survived an attack in her home.
   At the time, Arab reports said the two women accused of giving
the names of Palestinians being treated in the hospital to Israeli
authorities. Wounded Palestinians who come for treatment to
hospitals often given false names to avoid later arrest.
   Also Monday, clashes were reported in the Tulkarem refugee camp
between supporters of the Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas, or
Zeal, and members of pro-PLO factions.
   At least 10 people, aged 9 to 35, were injured, Arab reports
said. They were treated and released at the nearby Tulkarem
Hospital, they said.
   The clash involved clubs, knives and stones, Arab reports said.
They said army troops intervened with tear gas and rubber bullets
to break up the melee.
   In another incident, a Palestinian stringer for CBS-TV was
roughed up by Israeli troops, who damaged his camera and
confiscated videotape of a demonstration he was covering in Gaza
City, according to Arab reports.
   The correspondent, Taher Shriteh, was treated for bruises at
Shifa Hospital and released, they said. He also works as a stringer
for the London-based Reuters news agency.
   Michael Rosenbaum, CBS bureau chief in Tel Aviv, confirmed the
incident and said a complaint will be filed with Israeli military
authorities.
   ``He is an accredited journalist trying to do his job, and this
is an outrageous incident,'' Rosenbaum said.

<HEAD>Sihanouk Says He Will Return to Cambodia to Live</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cambodia's Prince Norodom Sihanouk said Monday he
would return to live in one of Cambodia's ``liberated zones'' by
the end of the month.
   ``As a patriotic Cambodian, my duty is to return to my
much-loved country to live there in the midst of my people,''
Sihanouk said in a statement to the press.
   He said he planned to live in one of ``a certain number of
liberated zones in the interior of Cambodia'' that are ``controlled
and administered'' by his army.
   An assistant to Sihanouk's secretary, who identified himself
only as Kim, said Sihanouk would live in an area ``liberated'' from
Vietnam, but that an exact place had not been chosen.
   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in late 1978, said last fall
that it had pulled out its last troops from Cambodia, but Sihanouk
has charged most of Hanoi's troops remain in the country, disguised
as Cambodian soldiers.
   Sihanouk, who was king of Cambodia from 1941-55 and head of
state from 1960-70 after which he was deposed and formed a
government-in-exile in Beijing, said he would ``install myself
definitely in a liberated zone in Cambodia'' and ``occupy myself
permanently with (the) well-being'' of his people.
   Two weeks ago, Sihanouk quit as president of a three-party
coalition resistance fighting the Vietnamese occupation, but
retained his title of president of the country. He said he would
run for president if a political settlement is reached between the
coalition and the Vietnam-backed Hun Sen government and general
elections are held.
   Last week, Sihanouk changed the name, flag and anthem of the
resistance coalition, which holds Cambodia's seat in the United
Nations and is recognized as the legitimate government by most
nations outside the Soviet-Vietnam bloc.
   Sihanouk said in his Monday statement that he would move by the
end of the month, following brief, private visits to Thailand and
Singapore.
   Sihanouk lives part-time in Beijing, as well as Paris and
Pyongyang, North Korea.

   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., denied Monday a
report that he offered $10,000 to $12,000 to help a male prostitute
get a new start in Florida after they quarreled about the man's
activities in Frank's rented townhouse.
   ``It's totally bizarre,'' Frank said of the report attributed to
Stephen Gobie in an article in the new issue of Penthouse magazine.
``It's the first time I ever heard of it.''
   The House ethics committee is investigating an allegation that
Frank, an acknowledged homosexual, knew Gobie was operating a
prostitution business from Frank's Capitol Hill home. Frank has
denied the allegation.
   Frank's response to the Penthouse article came the same day his
office made public campaign finance figures for 1989 indicating
that he raised $103,476 last year, most of it after Gobie's
allegations were made public. Only a handful of the contributions
came from constituents; the rest were from political action
committees and individuals outside the district or the state.
   Frank, 49, has acknowledged paying $80 to Gobie for an initial
sexual encounter. He says that after that they became friends and
he gave Gobie a job as a personal aide, housekeeper and driver,
firing him after learning Gobie was using the apartment as a
business base.
   Gobie is quoted as saying in the Penthouse article that he and
Frank argued after the congressman's landlord learned Gobie was
operating a sex-for-hire business in the apartment.
   ``I told him I needed $2,000 or $3,000 to move to Florida,''
Gobie is quoted as saying. ``I thought Washington had tapped out
for me. Barney offered me $10,000 to $12,000, but I said, `I don't
need that much.'''
   The article does not say whether Gobie said he received any
money. He has remained in Washington.
   Frank said the report was ``totally bizarre ... as is virtually
all of the new information'' in the Penthouse article by Art Harris
and Rudy Maxa.
   The congressman said there was ``partial truth to one story''
told by Gobie in the article ``even though he gets it wrong.''
   Gobie is quoted as saying, ``One day, at a restaurant, Barney
stood up to a bunch of Marines razzing a table of gays. They were
sashaying around with limp wrists and laughing. So Barney says, `My
name's Congressman Barney Frank. Do you guys have a problem? Were
you harassing these men because they are gay?' He got their
commanding officer's name and reported them.''
   Frank said, ``Yeah, I was in Mr. Henry's on Capitol Hill when
some Marines were hassling some guys and I went over and identified
myself and told them to stop. But I never gave their names to the
Marine Corps, because it was right after the Lebanon bombing and I
figured they were upset and I'd give them a pass on it.''
   A Marine Corps barracks in Lebanon was bombed on Oct. 23, 1983,
and 241 servicemen were killed.

<TEXT>
   Richard Secord is trying to circumvent his
plea bargain by appealing his conviction, Iran-Contra prosecutors
said Monday in asking a federal judge to delay dismissal of 11
felony charges or reinstate them against the retired Air Force
major general.
   In a court filing, the prosecutors also said they may ask U.S.
District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson to throw out Secord's plea
agreement with the government and seek to put him on trial on all
12 of the charges he once faced.
   Secord filed a notice of appeal Jan. 25, one day after he was
placed on two years' probation following a guilty plea to a charge
of making a false statement to congressional investigators.
   As part of the plea agreement, the office of independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh agreed not to prosecute Secord on eight counts of
perjury and other counts alleging conspiracy to pay illegal
gratuities to Oliver North, offering and paying North an illegal
gratuity and obstruction of Congress.
   Prosecutors now are asking that ``the court delay final
dismissal ... pending completiton'' of Secord's appeal or
alternatively, ``reconsider dismissal of charges already
dismissed.''
   The decision to appeal is ``a clear violation of the spirit'' of
the plea agreement and Iran-Contra prosecutors ``will oppose ...
his attempt to reopen what should be a settled conviction,''
Walsh's office said.
   ``The government regards it as an act of bad faith to agree to
plead guilty with the undisclosed intent to challenge the validity
of the plea,'' said the prosecutors.
   The appeal is based on a contention by Secord's lawyers that
Walsh lacks jurisdiction to prosecute for an offense arising out of
Secord's testimony to Congress.
   Thomas Green, Secord's lawyer, said after Secord was sentenced
Jan. 24 that if the appeals court were to uphold his position,
``that would result in a reversal and vacating'' of the conviction.
   Secord, who paid for a $13,800 security system at Oliver North's
home, pleaded guilty to lying when he told investigators in a
deposition in 1987 that he was unaware of any Iran-Contra proceeds
going to North.
   The Enterprise was the network of offshore companies and secret
accounts Secord and business partner Albert Hakim set up to handle
money in the Iran-Contra affair raised by overcharging Iran for
arms sold that country in secret.

   Egyptian authorities Monday arrested a suspect
in the desert bus attack in which nine Israelis were killed and
said the man was a Palestinian who went to Egypt two weeks ago with
his accomplices.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir demanded that Egypt track
down all of those involved in the Sunday attack and punish them,
and Israelis mourned their dead with silence and screams of anguish.
   Egypt's state-owned Middle East New Agency quoted an
unidentified police official as saying Monday night that one
suspect had been arrested but gave no further details.
   Israeli leaders said the latest Middle East peace efforts should
not be thwarted by public outrage over Sunday's attack _ the worst
on Israelis in Egypt since the two countries signed a peace treaty
in 1979.
   Newspaper editorials noted, however, that the incident would
almost certainly boost support for hard-line views toward Arabs.
   Israeli victims flown home by military jet from Egypt's capital
gave harrowing accounts of the several minutes during which two
gunmen on a desert road raked their bus with gunfire and hurled
grenades inside.
   ``Everyone saw his death,'' said Professor Yigal Barak, a
passenger who was unhurt.``There was nobody who could protect us,
nobody carried any weapons.''
   ``I felt like a Jew who is facing the Nazis,'' said Judith
Benjamini, 63, of Tel Aviv, describing the death of her 72-year-old
husband, Ishachar.
   All the dead were Israelis, and there were 21 people wounded,
including an Egyptian tour guide.
   In Washington, the State Department called the attack an
``outrageous act'' designed to halt efforts toward reconciliation
and dialogue between Arabs and Israelis.
   President Bush called Shamir to express his sorrow and Secretary
of State James A. Baker III relayed a similar message in calls to
the Israeli and Egyptian foreign ministers, department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler said.
   Shamir told Parliament: ``Our first demand from Egyptian leaders
is to find the perpetrators of the crime and bring them to speedy
trial and punish them severely.''
   He said Israel would go ahead with its peace initiative calling
for Palestinian elections but also would try to ``liquidate
blood-thirsty'' terrorism.
   He noted that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had telephoned
him at midnight Monday to apologize for the attack.
   ``I thanked him for his words, but I want to point out that we
view Egypt as responsible for the safety and security of Israeli
citizens who visit Egypt,'' Shamir said. ``It is inconceivable that
Israelis will repeatedly be victims of attacks by murderers who
exploit Egyptian soil for their evil and murderous plots.''
   Mubarak denounced the attack as a ``monstrous aggression ...
directed primarily'' against his efforts for Israeli-Palestinian
talks as a step toward Shamir's election plan.
   An Israeli extremist group telephoned a bomb threat to an office
of the national Itim News Agency, saying an explosive was planted
at Islam's sacred Dome of the Rock mosque in Jerusalem. Police
searched the area and found no bomb.
   While Israelis mourned the dead, some with silence and some with
anguished screams, leaders on the left and right hardened their
stands on whether it is time to move toward peace with the
Palestinians.
   Trade Minister Ariel Sharon, a member of Shamir's right-wing
Likud bloc but a foe of the prime minister's plan for elections to
choose Palestinian peace negotiators, said Egypt had no right to
press on with efforts to start an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.
   ``The positions of Egypt and the PLO are the same,'' he told
Israel army radio.
   But Finance Minister Shimon Peres, leader of the center-left
Labor Party, said on Israel radio ``that the peace process should
not be stopped by a few mad terrorists.''
   The attack gave Shamir a respite from challenges to his
leadership of Likud by Sharon and other hard-liners. Sharon agreed
to postpone for a week a showdown session on the government's peace
plan that was scheduled for Wednesday.
   But Israeli newspaper editorials noted that the attack could
could help the hardliners gain ground.
   ``This fearsome crime will no doubt also makes its mark on
efforts to get the peace wagon moving again,'' wrote the
mass-circulation Yediot Ahronot daily.
   ``Again there will be doubts about the value of a signature on a
piece of paper in the face of deep hatreds that remained ingrained
in the heart,'' the editorial said.
   Two unknown Moslem fundamentalist groups, meanwhile, claimed
responsibility for the attack.
   In Cairo, an unidentified caller said the Organization for the
Defense of Oppressed in Egyptian Prisons carried out the attack in
retaliation for alleged torture in Egyptian jails.
   In the Jordanian capital of Amman, a handwritten message to the
French news agency Agence France Presse claimed the assault was
carried out by a group called the Islamic Jihad-Holy War Jerusalem
group, but it was unclear if it was connected to any of several
groups using that name.
   Egyptian investigators said they found the white Peugeot sedan
used in the attack beside a road in the Nile River delta, and that
they had clues to the attackers.
   The Egyptian news agency identified the owner of the car as
Fat'hia Ahmed Abdel-Aal, and said she is an Egyptian citizen who
rents her car to tourist companies.
   It quoted a police official as saying the attackers hired the
car several days ago to use it in their attack. No further details
were given.
   Authorities immediately tightened security in Cairo's southern
suburb of Maadi, where many Israeli diplomats live. Police threw up
barricades and checked cars in the suburb, where Egyptian gunmen
attacked Israeli diplomats in 1984 and 1985.
   A state of alert was also declared in Egypt's sea ports and
airports to prevent the gunmen from fleeing the country.

<HEAD>Families of British Hostages Ask Rushdie Not to Publish Paperback</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relatives of British hostages held in Lebanon
asked author Salman Rushdie on Monday not to publish a paperback
edition of ``The Satanic Verses,'' which some Moslems consider
slanderous.
   ``We believe the time has come to balance the principle of free
speech against that of self restraint, which is also necessary in a
civilized society,'' the families said in a statement.
   It was issued through the archbishop of Canterbury, the Most
Rev. Robert Runcie, and signed by Frances and David Waite, wife and
brother of Runcie's envoy Terry Waite, and by close relatives of
the three other missing Britons.
   Eight Americans also are held in Lebanon, including Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
who was abducted March 16, 1985, and is the captive held longest.
   Most of the hostages are believed in the hands of Shiite Moslems
loyal to Iran. the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini pronounced a
death sentence on Rushdie a year ago _ Feb. 14, 1989 _ and the
novelist has been in hiding since.
   Monday's statement from the British families said his book had
caused ``grave offense to Moslems throughout the world,'' and
argued that free speech had been upheld by its large sales in hard
cover.
   Rushdie, 42, a naturalized Briton born to a Moslem family in
India, has been under police guard at an undisclosed location since
Khomeini urged Moslems to kill him. The decree was not lifted when
Khomeini died in June.
   ``Given the predictably grave damage likely to be caused, we
believe that further publication on the grounds of upholding free
speech would be both misconceived and irresponsible,'' the families
said.
   Viking Penguin, Rushdie's publishers, reiterated Monday night
that no decision had been made about a paperback edition.
   The relatives' made their appeal the day after a London
newspaper published a 7,000-word essay by Rushdie defending his
book and saying he regretted the offense caused.
   British Moslem leaders dismissed the essay, but members of
London's literary establishment credited the author with a
brilliant defense of free speech.
   Family members feel Rushdie has made matters worse for the
captives.
   ``Is it worth it to publish a paperback for this notion of
freedom of speech when freedom of individuals and indeed his own
liberty is at stake?'' Waite's cousin, John Waite, asked in a
television interview. ``If he thinks along those lines, I'm sure he
will feel a spirit of compromise means: Don't publish the
paperback.''
   Novelist Martin Amis countered: ``Should we deprive ourselves of
certain freedoms just to humor terrorists, to make them feel
better? Stringing up Salman Rushdie would make them feel better
still. It is not something we consider.''
   Terry Waite disappeared in Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, while trying
to win the release of American captives.
   The other missing Britons are television journalist John
McCarthy, and teacher Brian Keenan, both missing since April 1986,
and retired pilot Jack Mann, who vanished last May. Keenan also has
Irish nationality.
   They are among 18 Westerners missing in Lebanon, including the
eight Americans.

   Defense lawyers at John Gotti's assault trial
urged the jury Monday to reject ``Mafia hysteria'' and acquit the
reputed mob boss of charges he ordered the revenge shooting of a
union leader.
   Lawyers Bruce Cutler and Gerald Shargel, representing Gotti and
a co-defendant, ridiculed the quality of the prosecution's key
evidence _ poor quality audio tapes secretly recorded in 1986 at
Gotti's hangout in the borough of Queens and in a visiting room at
the Rikers Island jail.
   A prosecutor defended the state's evidence during his closing
statement, saying, ``Gotti had the motivation and he ordered the
shooting'' of John F. O'Connor, former vice president of Carpenters
Union Local 608.
   After a three-hour closing argument from Assistant District
Attorney Michael Cherkasky, Gotti said of his chances for
acquittal: ``There's no problem; there's never been a problem.''
   The jury was expected to hear final instructions from Acting
Justice Edward McLaughlin and begin deliberating Tuesday.
   The defense lawyers disparaged the truthfulness of criminals who
were prosecution witnesses, saying they were lying to save
themselves.
   They cited Vincent ``the Fish'' Cafaro, an admitted former
Mafioso who is now a government informer and witness. Cafaro
testified about the Mafia's structure but said he knew nothing
about the case against Gotti.
   Cutler, Gotti's lawyer, told the jury that although Cafaro knew
nothing about the case, ``he was put on to spread the poison, so
you'll say, `Well, somebody's a gangster so we'll convict him
anyway.'''
   ``We are in America,'' Cutler said. ``That's not how it's
supposed to be. People are not supposed to be convicted because of
who they are, who their friends are, what their background is.''
   Shargel said prosecutors suffer from ``a disease that will cause
them to do anything to get John Gotti.''
   Gotti, 49, reputed head of the Gambino gang, and reputed mob
associate Anthony Guerrieri, 61, are charged with ordering the May
7, 1986, shooting of O'Connor.
   Cherkasky asked the jury to study the daily court transcript of
the trial. ``We truly believe that if you continue to look at the
evidence, the evidence is overwhelming of guilt,'' he said.
   Prosecutors say Gotti had the Westies, a gang from Hell's
Kitchen on Manhattan's West Side, shoot O'Connor because in
February 1986 O'Connor allegedly ordered goons to trash Bankers and
Brokers, a mob-run restaurant in lower Manhattan, for using
non-union labor.
   Shargel, Guerrieri's lawyer, said there is absolutely no proof
that Gotti and his client ordered the shooting of O'Connor.
   O'Connor, who has recovered from at least four shots in the
buttocks, testified for the defense but he invoked his Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination several times when
cross-examined by Assistant District Attorney Michael Cherkasky.
   O'Connor has been charged in a 127-count indictment with
extortion, perjury, larceny and labor racketeering. His case is
supposed to start soon.
   The principal witness linking Gotti to the O'Connor shooting was
James ``Studs'' McElroy, 45, a former Westies gang member who is
serving a 60-year federal sentence.
   McElroy testified that he went to the funeral of reputed Gambino
underboss Frank DeCicco and was introduced as the Westie who was
going to ``whack'' O'Connor.
   Cutler called McElroy ``a psychopathic maniac'' who once cut a
man's throat for $100 and lied on the stand to help his girlfriend
get favorable treatment in a drug case and increase his own chances
of getting out of jail.
   ``James McElroy is saying what he knows the prosecutors want to
hear,'' Shargel said.
   ``When the smoke clears, you will realize one thing _ that there
is no proof, let alone proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that John
Gotti and Anthony Guerrieri had John O'Connor shot,'' Shargel said.
   ``The evidence they have put before you is riddled with doubt
and infested with uncertainty.''
   On the subject of the tape recordings, the defense pointed out
that transcripts of the same conversations used in a federal court
trial differed from transcripts in this trial in state Supreme
Court, a trial level court in New York state.
   ``You've seen time and again that they misinterpreted on the
tapes,'' Shargel said.
   The defense lawyers say a key sentence on tape, in which Gotti
allegedly says, ``We're gonna, gonna bust him up,'' is inaudible.
   ``They (prosecutors) know full well that the tapes don't prove
the case. If they did, John Gotti and Anthony Guerrieri would have
been arrested in 1986, not in 1989,'' Shargel said.

<HEAD>Labor Department Proposes Further Limits on Cancer-Causing Agent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Labor Department proposed Monday that
permissible workplace exposure to cadmium, a potential
cancer-causing substance used in batteries, paint and plastics, be
reduced by at least 95 percent.
   The new standard would affect 512,000 workers in a variety of
industries, according to the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.
   Cadmium is a soft metal found in lead, copper and zinc sulfide
ores and is used, among other things, as an anti-corrosive and in
batteries. Plastics, ceramic and paint manufacturers also use it,
as do metal machining and welding firms.
   Permissible exposure limits currently are 100 micrograms per
cubic meter of air for cadmium fumes, 200 micrograms for cadmium
dust, averaged over an eight-hour shift.
   OSHA proposed to reduce those limits to 5 micrograms or 1
microgram for all cadmium compounds and asked for comment on which
limit should be chosen. The agency said the lower limit could
prevent 14 cancer deaths and as many as 189 cases of kidney damage
each year.
   A short-term exposure limit was proposed to guard against heavy
exposure to cadmium for short periods that would not violate the
eight-hour standard. The short-term standard would limit 15-minute
exposures to five times the concentration specified in the
eight-hour standard.
   The agency estimated a 95 percent reduction would cost
businesses nearly $57 million a year while the 99 percent reduction
would cost about $160 million. Most of the difference includes
additional costs for engineering controls, respirators and hygiene
facilities necessary to achieve the lower limit.
   About half of the affected workers are already below the lower
limit, said assistant secretary Gerard Scannell, who heads OSHA.
   The agency will hold hearings on the proposal in Washington in
June and Denver in July. A decision is expected by around the end
of the year.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the Communist Party on
Monday it must give up its unchallenged right to rule the Soviet
Union to the tide of democratic reform he let loose five years ago.
   In a historic speech to the party's Central Committee in the
Kremlin, he tacitly acknowledged the growing power of the
pro-democracy movement that has toppled Communist regimes in
Eastern Europe, set several Soviet republics on the road to
multiparty politics, and on Sunday drew huge protests in Moscow.
   But his move was unlikely to bring about the disintegration of
the Communist Party, and Gorbachev, who is both party chief and
head of government, did not address the possibility of the party
losing power.
   The Communist Party's leading role in society, a tenet of Soviet
socialism that excluded any other political forces since Vladimir
I. Lenin founded the Soviet Union during World War I, was
formalized in the Soviet Constitution in 1977.
   The party wants to remain the leading force in society but must
prove its worthiness, earning the right to govern instead of taking
it for granted, Gorbachev said.
   In the future the party ``intends to struggle for the role of
ruling party, but do it strictly in the framework of the democratic
process, rejecting any kind of legal or political advantage,''
Gorbachev said.
   Political reform that has strengthened the Soviet government at
the expense of an all-controling party apparatus, ``has been
accompanied by a growth in political pluralism,'' Gorbachev said,
presenting a draft platform to the 249-member Central Committee.
   ``This process can lead to the creation of parties at some
stage.''
   Central Committee sources said Gorbachev told the closed meeting
that political changes he has pushed through since taking power in
March 1985 have in effect created a multiparty system already.
   In his speech, Gorbachev called into question another tenet of
Leninism _ democratic centralism, the theory that requires strict
adherance by the party's 20 million members to decisions once they
have been made at the top.
   ``The party's renewal presupposes its thorough, comprehensive
democratization and rethinking the principle of democratic
centralism with emphasis on democracy and power of the party
masses,'' Gorbachev said.
   He proposed the Central Committee meet again in about three
weeks to consider new party rules. It will reconvene its present
session on Tuesday.
   The sources said that in contrast to usual practice, there was
no applause for Politburo members when they entered the hall at the
beginning of the day, nor any applause for any of the 28 speeches
during the session.
   Gorbachev interrupted the proceedings to give his opinions only
once or twice after he spoke, unlike previous Central Committee
meetings, they said.
   The Soviet leader used strong terms to defend himself, his
policies and actions.
   He named as some enemies of his reform policies
``representatives of the shadow economy, a veritable mafia that is
fanning the flames of ethnic strife and putting pressure on state
bodies under the slogans of national revival.''
   He said soldiers had to be sent to the Azerbaijan republic
because ``a coup attempt _ nothing more, nothing less'' was being
attempted.
   Gorbachev said power changes were needed to get things done.
   ``At present, from the viewpoint of strategic tasks and in view
of current realities, it is necessary to realign forces in the
upper echelons of power in order to give more dynamism to
perestroika processes and ensure more firmly their
irreversibility,'' he declared.
   He also cautioned that while the world situation has improved,
the danger of war remains _ ``The doctrines and concepts of the
United States and NATO, which are far from being defensive, remain
in force.''
   Gorbachev indicated that he did not foresee the reform
overturning the country's socialist system as well as the
communists' assurance of power.
   The party was ``ready to act with due account for these new
circumstances, cooperate and conduct a dialogue with all
organizations honoring the Soviet Constitution and the social
system it endorses,'' he said.

   The two-day Central Committee meeting had shaped up as a major
struggle between reformers and conservatives over the party's
future. Rumors emerged that conservatives would accuse Gorbachev of
bringing on economic collapse and ethnic unrest with his reforms.
   The Soviet president said he had hoped 1989 would be the turning
point for his economic reforms, but acknowledged that ``recent
events have shown there has been no change for the better.''
   Gorbachev's address Monday granted the basic demands of the
hundreds of thousands of people who swept 60 abreast through the
streets of the capital on Sunday. Communist reformers and
non-Communists demanded the party give up its exclusive claim to
power.
   Reformer Boris N. Yeltsin, a leader of the rally, told the
Central Committee the new platform did not go far enough. ``In
general, the impression is formed that it was written by two hands
_ both the left and the right,'' he said.
   Small political parties already are forming in the Baltic
republics, where Communist leaders are leading the drive to
eliminate the party's guaranteed role.
   Gorbachev said in Lithuania last month it would be ``no
tragedy'' if a multiparty system evolved, but that such a system
was not a panacea.
   Transcripts released by the Tass news agency indicated Gorbachev
underwent immediate, stinging criticism at the Central Committee
meeting for a lack of decisiveness.
   ``Is it not time for you, Mikhail Sergeyevich, and the
leadership of the country as a whole to seriously think about the
fate of the socialist government, over the fate of honest laboring
people, and take the most direct radical measures before it's too
late?'' asked the first speaker, Kiev party chief A.I. Kornienko.
   The ambassador to Poland, Vladimir I. Borovikov, also gave a
strong speech urging faster reforms, said several Central Committee
sources.
   One Central Committee source said Leningrad party chief Boris
Gidaspov, who has become a lightning rod for conservatives,
demanded the establishment of strict law and order in the country.
   Despite the criticism, Gorbachev was in firm control of the
meeting and there was no organized effort to oust him or limit his
power, the source said.
   The source said many of the 27 speakers who followed Gorbachev
criticized his proposed platform for being too general, and that a
commission of about 60 members was formed to rework it overnight.
Gorbachev was appointed head of the commission, he said.
   There was little criticism in the meeting of Gorbachev's
proposal to strike the party's constitutional claim to exclusive
power, Central Committee members said. They predicted it would be
approved handily.
   More than 1,000 people, including 240 Central Committee members,
100 non-voting members, military district commanders and local
party and government officials attended the meeting, the source
said. But only full Central Committee members will be allowed to
vote on the platform Tuesday, he said.
   Gorbachev also said the Communist Party's views on managing the
economy and the government no longer should be pressed on Soviet
society as a whole.
   The Soviet leader called on the Central Committee to move up to
late June the next party Congress, theoretically the party's most
powerful body, which would be charged with electing a new Central
Committee and leadership.
   Congresses normally are held every five years, and the next
would have been regularly scheduled for spring 1991. But Gorbachev
last year moved up the date of the Congress to this fall, and in
his speech Monday called for it to be moved up again.
   Central Committee members interviewed outside the Kremlin at the
end of the day's session also said Gorbachev proposed structural
changes in the party and the government.
   Svyatoslav Fyodorov, a well-known eye surgeon and participant in
the meeting, said the platform included creation of a stronger
presidency with powers like that of the French or U.S. president.
   Vladimir Gusev, chairman of the Gorno-Altai regional party, said
the Soviet leader proposed creating posts of two deputy chairmen of
the Communist Party. Gorbachev also proposed reducing the size of
the Central Committee, Tass said.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Rafael Angel
Calderon said Monday he is ``a great friend of the United States''
and told a cheering crowd he hopes to turn his election victory
into ``a triumph for all Costa Ricans.''
   On May 8, Calderon will succeed Oscar Arias, who won the 1987
Nobel Peace Prize for developing and promoting the Central American
peace plan.
   He attended Mass on Monday at the Roman Catholic Basilica de Los
Angeles in Cartago, the colonial capital 15 miles east of here.
   ``I asked God to help me give the people of Costa Rica what the
people deserve: a better future,'' he told 3,000 supporters
gathered in downtown San Jose.
   Calderon, 40-year-old founder of the Social Christian Party,
repeated campaign pledges to fight crime, poverty and poor housing,
but got the biggest cheer when he asked for unity against drug
trafficking and corruption.
   The festive crowd waved Costa Rican and red-and-blue Social
Christian flags. People gave loud, good-natured jeers when a
partisan of Carlos Manuel Castillo, candidate of the incumbent
National Liberation Party, waved a green-and-white party flag from
a balcony.
   By Monday afternoon, the official count showed Calderon leading
Castillo by 656,282 votes to 604,396, with about 90 percent of
precincts reporting.
   Castillo broke even in San Jose, the National Liberation Party
stronghold. Calderon's Social Christians were sweeping most of the
countryside.
   ``Today, we have elected liberty and democracy to the presidency
of Costa Rica,'' Castillo said in a graceful concession speech
Sunday night.
   Newspaper projections showed Calderon's party winning 29 or 30
of the 57 National Assembly seats, with National Liberation taking
25 and minor parties the remainder.
   Calderon, who visited Panama shortly after the Dec. 20 U.S.
invasion, is a strong supporter of U.S. policy in the region.
   ``Costa Rica has elected a great friend of the people and
government of the United States,'' he said in answer to a question
Monday. ``I've always said Costa Rica and the United States are two
countries very different in size and power, but very much alike in
their battle for peace and democracy.''
   He delivered his broadcast address of thanks to the nation from
a balcony overlooking San Jose's central pedestrian mall, where
even curious tourists joined the spirit of the occasion.
   The president-elect has expressed disappointment over U.S. aid
for Costa Rica, set at about $90 million for 1990 and due to fall
about 30 percent in 1991.
   Thousands of Calderon supporters celebrated into the early hours
Monday, honking car horns and waving red-and-blue flags; the
streets and the morning rush hour were quieter than normal as
celebrants stayed home.
   Costa Rica celebrated 100 years of democracy in October;
Calderon's victory marks the 10th straight peaceful election in
Costa Rica since 1948, when his own father, Rafael Angel Calderon
Guardia, tried to overturn the result.
   Calderon said he owed his victory to party organization and
desire for change _ National Liberation candidates won the last two
elections, beating Calderon both times.
   Calderon, generally seen as a conservative despite his populist
rhetoric, has promised a new housing program for the poor while at
the same time saying he would reduce the government's deficit
spending.
   He proposal to require large companies to establish
profit-sharing plans, something that has made some businessmen
nervous.

   A helicopter Monday night plucked 10 people from a
damaged British cargo ship drifting in a gale in the Atlantic, and
flew them to Ireland, the coast guard reported.
   In northeastern England, police said the bodies of a man and his
13-year-old nephew, washed out of their van on Sunday as they tried
to drive across a bridge on a flooded river, were found several
miles away. Their dog was alive in the van.
   With gales and flooding hitting parts of Britain for a second
week, the government announced emergency funds for damage in one of
the hardest-hit areas, the Severn Valley in southwestern England.
   Ferry services between Wales and Ireland were disrupted Monday,
and in Scotland there were landslides.
   A helicopter was sent to the stricken freighter, the Tribulus,
after the captain asked that the wives of three crewmen and seven
other people be taken off when the ship began taking on water 250
miles off the English coast.
   The captain said the 128,000-ton ship's iron ore cargo had
expanded after the freighter began taking on water and ruptured the
hull.
   The coast guard said 15 of the crew members, all Britons,
remained on the vessel, which is owned by the Shell oil company. It
was heading slowly toward Ireland Monday night.

   Two former mayors _ San Franciso's Dianne Feinstein and
Atlanta's Andrew Young _ launched campaigns Monday for the
Democratic nomination for governor of their home states, California
and Georgia.
   In other announcements Monday, Sen. Jim Exon, D-Neb., launched
his bid for a third term and four-term Indianapolis Mayor William
H. Hudnut said he was accepting the pleas of Republican leaders to
run for secretary of state.
   Feinstein, 56, calling her campaign an historic step for women,
said she would be a problem-solving governor who would improve
California schools, provide health insurance to the uninsured and
end the auto insurance crisis.
   Young, 57, also a former civil rights leader, ambassador, and
congressman, sounded traditional campaign themes _ progress,
education and holding down taxes _ in his bid to become Georgia's
first black governor.
   Feinstein enters the race as an underdog both in polls and
fund-raising to Democratic state Attorney General John Van de Kamp
and Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson. The incumbent, Republican
George Deukmejian, is not seeking re-election this fall.
   She stressed her administrative experience as mayor of San
Francisco for nine years, ending in 1988, saying she has the
experience to ``be a governor who convinces, cajoles and, yes, even
knocks heads to get the job done.''
   Feinstein traveled to Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Francisco
to announce her candidacy Monday.
   Young, who left office last month after eight years as Atlanta's
mayor, has worked for months planning his Democratic campaign.
After his kickoff Monday, he planned to begin a four-day driving
tour of the state Tuesday.
   In his announcement, Young touched on two controversial topics,
vowing to protect abortion rights and calling for a statewide vote
on a lottery _ something that's been bottled up in the Georgia
Legislature for years.
   Young spoke in his kickoff speech of a coalition campaign, with
``young and old, rural and suburban folks.''
   He has traditionally eschewed direct racial messages, and he
continued that strategy in his first official campaign speech.
   An Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll last fall showed Young with
38 percent of the Democratic vote. Four-term Lieutenant Gov. Zell
Miller was second at 30 percent. Other Democratic challengers are
state Sen. Roy E. Barnes and state Rep. Lauren W. McDonald Jr., and
former Gov. Lester Maddox.
   The incumbent, Democrat Joe Frank Harris, is barred by the state
constitution from seeking a third consecutive term. Georgia's
Democratic primary is July 17 and if no candidate receives 50 per
cent of the vote, a runoff is held Aug. 7 for the November election.
   Young, a key player in the civil rights movement, represented
Atlanta in Congress from 1973-77. He was ambassador to the United
Nations under President Carter and served as mayor of Atlanta
beginning in 1982.
   Feinstein, who would be California's first woman governor if
elected, also touched on the abortion issue in her speech and put
special emphasis on seeking support of women voters. The primary is
June 5 and general election is Nov. 6.
   ``And if I am elected, women can be sure that their governor not
only supports their legal right to choice but personally believes
in it too,'' she said.
   In Indianapolis, Hudnut, 57, will likely face Democratic
incumbent Joseph H. Hogsett. Hogsett, 33, was appointed after Evan
Bayh left that office to become governor.

   A light aircraft slammed into a
cloud-covered hillside early Monday in southern Colombia, killing
all 15 people aboard, Red Cross officials said.
   The Grumman aircraft belonging to Helicol, a subsidiary of
Avianca Airlines, crashed as it approached the airport in Ibague, a
city 60 miles south of the capital Bogota. The plane had taken off
from Neiva, 155 miles south of Bogota, at 9:05 a.m.
   Most of the passengers worked for the Colombian petroleum firm
Hocol or Shell Oil Co., the radio network RCN reported. It added
that the victims were all Colombians.
   A Red Cross spokesman, Ramiro Lozano, said in a radio interview
that rescue workers located the plane and the bodies of the 11
passengers and four crew members on the slopes of a hill outside
Ibague.
   Lozano quoted witnesses as saying they had seen fire engulfing
the engines of the low-flying plane just before it crashed. The Red
Cross worker said the plane had been flying just below a dense
cloud cover.
   Helicol provides charter flights, primarily for executives of
foreign oil companies operating in southern Colombia.

<HEAD>President Extends Amnesty for Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos has extended for another year an amnesty for rebels trying
to topple the government, the Angolan Embassy in Lisbon said Monday.
   The announcement came as government troops and rebels battled
for control of the strategic Mavinga airstrip in southeastern
Angola, which is on the way to the rebels' Jamba stronghold.
   According to an embassy statement, dos Santos said Sunday that
the amnesty, which covers common crimes and crimes against state
security, would be extended for a year from Sunday.
   Government sources in the Angolan capital, Luanda, said about
40,000 rebels have turned themselves in so far.
   The amnesty went into effect in December 1988 as an incentive
for the rebels to end the 15-year-old civil war.
   But rebel leader Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) wants the Marxist, one-party state
to hold free elections as a precondition for peace.
   The Portuguese news agency Lusa quoted an unidentified military
source in Luanda as saying the rebels had launched a counterattack
on Mavinga.
   Government forces were hampered by low supplies and could not
consolidate their positions, Lusa quoted the source as saying.
   A military source had said Friday that two government columns
had taken control of the airstrip and most of the town, 700 miles
southeast of Luanda.
   The rebels denied the claims and Savimbi called for an all-out
attack nationwide.
   According to Lusa, the rebels sabotaged Luanda's electricity
supply lines Monday, depriving the capital of power for most the
day.
   Earlier, the Angolan state news agency ANGOP reported that two
members of the government's ruling party, the Popular Movement for
the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), congratulated troops on Mavinga's
capture but had differing views on how the civil war should end.
   Defense Minister Pedro Maria Tonha Sunday urged youngsters and
soldiers in the southeastern garrison town of Cuito Cuanavale to
fight until they defeat the rebels, the news agency said.
   It said former Interior Minister Alexandre Rodrigues called for
a peaceful solution during ceremonies in the northern town of
N'dalatando commemorating the 29th anniversary of the start of
independence wars against former colonial power Portugal.
   Rodrigues spoke as a representative of dos Santos, and it was
his first official appearance since he fell into disgrace in
December 1988, accused of forming secret combat units without the
president's knowledge.
   Rodrigues was fired as interior minister but remained in control
of a key commission of MPLA and reportedly received support from
hard-line party members.
   The rebels have fought to force the government to share power
since Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   Savimbi and dos Santos agree to a truce in June, but it
collapsed within weeks and efforts by U.S., Soviet, Portuguese and
African diplomats have failed to persuade the two sides to resume
negotiations.

   The International Monetary Fund said Monday it
had approved standby credits for Poland equivalent to $723 million
to support that country's economic stabilization program.
   Poland is trying to bring down an inflation rate that reached
650 percent last year while it moves to a market-based economy and
balance its budget.
   Poland has arranged loans from the U.S. Treasury, the Bank for
International Settlements and a fund from other western countries
to stabilize the zloty on foreign exchange markets. It is the first
time it has made use of IMF resources since it joined the fund in
1986.
   The IMF uses funds provided by member countries _ which include
almost all the western nations _ to help member countries in
economic trouble. became a member in 1986.
   The action was announced the same day that the Agriculture
Department said it would send seven experts to Poland to help
develop a private farm economy.
   The U.S. agricultural team, which will be in Poland from Tuesday
through Feb. 15, will focus on Poland's needs in agricultural
education and technical assistance for private farm production and
marketing, said Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said.
   The mission will be headed by Myron D. Johnsrud, administrator
of the Agriculture Department's extension service.

<HEAD>News Photographer Killed in Lebanon Fighting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veteran Lebanese news photographer George
Samerejian has died of wounds suffered during the weeklong fighting
between rival Christian factions, authorities said. He was 42.
   Samerejian, an Armenian Christian, worked for Beirut's
independent An-Nahar daily and was elected chairman of Lebanon's
News Photographers Syndicate in December.
   He was hit in the head last Wednesday by a stray bullet and died
Saturday.
   The photographer was one of the handful of journalists to have
covered the civil war since it began in April 1975. He survived
countless battles and two Israeli invasions and had the reputation
of leading a charmed life, though he was wounded once before and
was twice kidnapped by Moslems.
   Samerejian was among more than 150,000 people who have died in
nearly 15 years of war here and the 12th journalist to be killed in
the conflict.
   He was wounded fatally while covering street battles in east
Beirut between rebel Gen. Michel Aoun's troops and the Lebanese
Forces militia led by Samir Geagea.
   Samerejian was taken to a hospital but no surgeon could get
there to operate on him because of fierce house-to-house fighting.
   The Red Cross got him to the American University Hospital in the
western Moslem sector on Thursday. Surgeons removed the bullet that
shattered his brain, but he died Saturday without regaining
consciousness.
   An-Nahar Editor Francois Akl wrote of Samerejian: ``Throughout
his outstanding career, George was noted for his fearless
determination to be on the scene regardless of the risks involved.
   ``He was the ideal example of the news photographer, whose eye
instantly catches what his camera should record.''
   Mohammed Baalbaki, chairman of Lebanon's Press Syndicate, said
in a eulogy: ``Journalism in Lebanon has become a profession of
death and George Samerejian is one of its esteemed martyrs.''
   A sniper shot Samerejian in the left leg in west Beirut on Dec.
9, 1975, early in the civil war, but after 35 days in a hospital
bed, Samerejian was back shooting pictures of the fighting.
   An-Nahar said he was kidnapped twice by different Moslem
factions, but in both instances emerged less than a week later,
``and when he came out his captors had become close friends.''
   Samerejian was in south Lebanon in 1978, when the Israeli army
invaded to drive out Palestinian guerrillas. An old Lebanese woman
hid him in her cellar for three days and helped him sneak through
the Israeli forces to safety.
   ``I was in agony when Israeli tanks rumbled over my hideout and
I couldn't take pictures of them,'' Samerejian wrote.
   He covered the second Israeli invasion in 1982, including the
28-day bombardment of west Beirut.
   Samerejian is survived by his wife and two daughters.

   An army captain and a sergeant were killed
and seven soldiers wounded when a land mine set by Shining Path
insurgents exploded under their passing truck, the military said
Monday.
   Police in Ayacucho said Shining Path assassins also killed four
residents in two shantytowns last weekend.
   The attack on the military truck occurred Sunday, 30 miles north
of this state capital, which is in the Andes 235 miles southeast of
Lima.
   The army said the truck was the first in a convoy of three
military vehicles. The other two trucks were not damaged.
   Police said Shining Path rebels dragged four men from their
homes Saturday in Ayacucho and shot them to death. According to the
report, the guerrillas accused the four of posing as Shining Path
members to extract ``protection money'' from local storekeepers.
   Ayacucho is the birthplace and stronghold of the Shining Path
movement, which launched its insurgency in 1980 to topple Peru's
government.
   Since then, the violence has spread through most of the country,
and more than 17,500 people have been killed, including soldiers,
police, rebels and civilians.

   Gen. Michel Aoun's tanks broke into a
stronghold of his Christian militia rivals Monday, after aweek of
battle, and advanced toward the command post of Lebanese Forces
chief Samir Geagea, police said.
   They said the tanks, with cannons blazing, drove to within 300
yards of the Kassardjian militia base in Ein Rummaneh, a
working-class district of Christian east Beirut.
   Witnesses in hills above the Christian sector, reached by
telephone from Cyprus, reported heavy fighting in Ein Rummaneh
south of the Karantina quarter, where Geagea has his headquarters.
   Explosions echoed across the city as militiamen crouching in
alleyways fired armor-piercing rockets at the tanks and their
comrades hurled grenades from rooftops.
   Shells hit hospitals, schools, and churches. They set fuel
tanks, power plants, factories and apartment houses ablaze.
   Fires burned out of control because pumping stations were
knocked out and no water ws available to fight them.
   Several hospitals said they they could not function for more
than two or three days because water, blood, plasma and oxygen
supplies were virtually exhausted.
   Shellfire slackened in some districts at dawn Monday, allowing
tens of thousands of civilians to leave basements and underground
bomb shelters where some had lived for six days.
   Youssef Khazen, 35, said his electrical tools store in east
Beirut residential district of Ashrafiyeh was destroyed.
   ``You can't believe what those monsters have done to us,'' he
said. ``They've ruined us. Ashrafiyeh looks like it was hit by a
hurricane.''
   In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross asked
for an immediate truce so it could help civilians.
   Geagea has said the 6,000 regulars and 30,000 reservists of the
Lebanese Forces, the largest Christian militia, would ``resist unto
death ... to end the dictator's reign of terror'' in Christian
territory north and east of Beirut.
   Aoun, who has been dismissed as army commander but refuses to
step aside, commands nearly 20,000 Christian troopers and is trying
to gain complete control over the 310-square-milie enclave, where 1
million Christians live.
   On Monday, his paratroopers secured the key coastal town of
Dbaye, 5 miles north of Beirut. They seized it Sunday in a fierce
hand-to-hand battle.
   The Lebanese Forces conceded its 80-man Dbaye garrison had been
overrun and made a ``tactical retreat.''
   Police said 59 soldiers and militiamen were killed in Dbaye,
including nine of Aoun's officers, and 70 were wounded.
   At least 277 people have been killed and 1,037 wounded since the
fighting began Jan. 30, the police said.
   Casualties in the week-old war for military supremacy among the
Christians have included 30 people killed and 117 wounded by shells
that strayed into Moslem west Beirut, outside the combat zone.
   News photographer George Samerejian of Beirut's independent
An-Nahar was hit in the head by a stray bullet Wednesday and died
in a hospital Saturday, the newspaper said. He had covered the
civil war since it began in 1975 and was elected chairman of
Lebanon's News Photographers Syndicate in December.
   Aoun's forces appeared poised Monday for a final, two-pronged
assault on Geagea's headquarters at Karantina, from the north and
through Ein Rummaneh. Police said Aoun has regrouped his armor on
the northern and northeastern flanks of east Beirut.
   His forces apparently broke through the militia defenses in Ein
Rummaneh after two days of battle on the fringes of the district,
which lies along the line between Beirut's Christian and Moslem
sectors.
   Edward Djerjian, the U.S. ambassador to Syria, blamed Aoun for
the carnage, criticizing the general's ``personal quest for
power.'' He is responsible for Lebanon since American diplomats
were withdrawn from Beirut in September, after Aoun's supporters
surrounded the embassy.
   A three-man committee representing Maronite Catholic patriarch
Nasrallah Sfeir called a cease-fire for 2:15 p.m. Monday, but it
was as ineffective as the six before it.
   At 9:30 p.m., the mediators said Aoun and Geagea had agreed to
observe the cease-fire and a committee of officers from both sides
had been formed to oversee it, but radio stations reported
continued fighting an hour later.
   A Lebanese Forces statement claimed Aoun's forces attacked in
Ein Rummaneh ``at the very moment the cease-fire was slated to
start,'' and declared: ``Pitched batles are raging.''
   Aoun's command said the Lebanese Forces broke the truce.
   The capture of Dbaye was Aoun's first significant victory in the
battle with the Lebanese Forces. He already holds the highway
linking Karantina to militia bases in the northern ports of Jounieh
and Byblos, and now can disrupt supplies arriving by sea.
   ``By taking Dbaye, a major Lebanese Forces armor base, the
general has destroyed the militia's rear lines before turning for a
frontal assault,'' on Karantina, An-Nahar reported.
   Ghassan Tueini, the publisher, denounced Aoun and Geagea in a
front-page editorial as ``madmen dancing around the fire ... to
build a republic of graves.''

<TEXT>
   Scientists are building a
remote-controlled aircraft to fly through the hole in the ozone
layer over the South Pole, Harvard University said Monday.
   The craft will fly up to 85,000 feet above Antarctica, where
temperatures plunge to minus 135 degrees, said Professor James
Anderson, who teaches atmospheric chemistry.
   The aircraft will seek information about the ozone layer over
the South Pole, 60 percent of which has been depleted, Anderson
said.
   Some experts believe the protective ozone layer has been damaged
by chlorofluorocarbons from air conditioners, refrigerators, some
aerosol sprays and other sources.
   Because ozone blocks ultraviolet radiation, damage to the ozone
layer could lead to higher levels of skin cancer, eye problems and
damaged food crops, Anderson said.
   The craft will have a 60-foot wingspan and be built of graphite,
hydrocarbons and other strong, lightweight materials.
   Anderson's team at Harvard is designing the aircraft's
instrumentation. John Langford of Aurora Flight Sciences in
Virginia is heading the team that will build the aircraft's body.
   The unmanned craft's flight over the South Pole will be battery
powered and controlled by a computer program monitored from McMurdo
Station in Victoria Land, Antarctica, Langford said.
   Anderson and Langford said they expect the aircraft to make its
first flight this fall.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk, in
his speech last week announcing major political reforms, lifted
virtually all the media restrictions imposed under the 3-year-old
national state of emergency.
   The only emergency media restriction still in force prohibits
photographic or television coverage of political unrest unless
police permission is obtained.
   Many of the restrictions repealed by de Klerk had been ignored
with increasing frequency by South African and foreign journalists.
These regulations either prohibited or restricted reports about
unrest, security force action, general strikes or consumer
boycotts, and political statements the government deemed subversive.
   In addition to scrapping these regulations, de Klerk on Friday
lifted bans that had prohibited the local media from quoting
militant government opponents.
   Even before the emergency was declared in June 1986, South
Africa's media was subject to an array of restictive laws that
remain in effect. These restrict reporting about such topics as
mational security, energy supplies and incidents in prisons.
   During the emergency, several foreign journalists were expelled
and several anti-apartheid newspapers were ordered to close for
months because of alleged violations of the restrictions.
   In the past year, such actions have become rare, and the
government has been approving hundreds of visas for foreign
journalists to come on temporary visits to cover the expected
release of jailed African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela.

<HEAD>Report Troops Capture Strategic Town from Rebels</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers have captured a strategic
eastern town from rebels in heavy fighting that left seven troops
wounded, an army commander said Monday.
   ``We have suppressed the rebels to a point but we cannot be sure
that the war has ended,'' Brig. Gen. Moses Craig told reporters.
   Craig, the army commander in eastern Nimba county, said his
troops on Friday pushed rebels out of Kahnplay town, 200 miles
northeast of Monrovia.
   He said no soldiers were killed in the battle. Craig said there
were rebel casualties but that he did not know the number.
   Another Liberian officer, Lt. Col. David Vlayee, admitted
soldiers under his command killed a civilian boy, but he said it
was an accident.
   At least 500 civilians have been reported killed by troops sent
to the eastern border to hunt rebels who infiltrated from
neighboring Ivory Coast in a Dec. 24 invasion aimed at ousting
President Samuel Doe, according to Western diplomats in Abidjan,
the Ivorian capital.
   The rebels, led by former civil servant Charles Taylor, are from
the Gio and Manno tribes that long have felt oppressed by Doe's
Krahn tribe. Rebels have retaliated by moving south into Krahn
territory and killing civilians there, diplomats reported.
   About 60,000 Liberians caught in the ethnic conflict have fled
to Ivory Coast and about 12,000 have taken refuge in Guinea,
according to officials of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
   Vlayee said a soldier shot and killed teen-ager Paul Duo in
Yekepa, a town near the border with Guinea, as the youth ran to
hide in bushes when troops approached him.
   Doe has admitted his soldiers have killed some civilians. He
said it is difficult for them to differentiate between civilians
and rebels who wear no uniforms.
   U.S. military advisers were sent to the area in January to help
discipline soldiers, and several officers were relieved of their
duties, according to U.S. State Department officials.
   Washington is a staunch supporter of Doe, who seized power in a
bloody 1980 coup from the descendants of freed U.S. slaves who
founded Liberia in 1847.
   Col. David Staley, chief of the U.S. military in Liberia, said
Monday that U.S. soldiers in Nimba ``are assessing the situation
and making sure that no Americans get hurt.''
   About 700 Americans are in the war zone, Staley said in an
interview. They include Peace Corps volunteers, missionaries and
employees of mining companies.
   ``At the moment, the rebels are now scattered in the bushes and
are being pursued by my men,'' Craig said. ``We also have to use
guerrilla tactics to get rid of them.''
   He said palm nuts found in the pockets of a dead rebel field
commander were an indication the guerrillas have little food. The
dead rebel ``had been surviving on palm nuts for days,'' Craig said.
   He said the guerrillas are heavily armed and well-trained.
Rocket-propelled grenade launchers and heavy machine guns
manufactured in East bloc countries were among captured weapons,
Craig said.
   Liberia has accused Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and Libya of
supporting the rebels, an allegation denied by those countries.

<HEAD>Member of German Minority Vies for Polish Senate Seat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ethnic German polled more votes than
three other hopefuls Monday in the first round of voting to fill a
vacant seat in the Polish Senate.
   Henryk Krol, a veterinarian who with his father is a leader of
the ethnic German community in the Silesian province of Opole, will
face Solidarity-endorsed candidate Dorota Symonides, a professor
specializing in Silesian folklore, in a Feb. 18 runoff.
   In a field of four candidates, according to the state's PAP news
agency, Krol obtained 39.4 percent of the votes to 35.7 percent for
Mrs. Symonides.
   A runoff of the top two candidates is required when no candidate
polls 50 percent or more.
   Eliminated during the first round of voting Sunday were Jozef
Pietrzykowski, from the communist-aligned OPZZ trade union, and
Jerzy Bobrowski, an independent businessman, according to PAP.
   There were 214,796 valid ballots, and the turnout was 31.4
percent of the electorate, PAP said.
   The election is to fill the seat left vacant by the recent death
of Sen. Edmund Osmanczyk.
   If elected to represent Opole Province, Krol would become the
first member of the ethnic German minority group to serve in either
Poland's 100-member freely elected Senate or its 460-member lower
parliament house, the Sejm.
   Communist officials for decades had denied that any German
minority remained in the nearly one-third of present-day Poland
that belonged to Germany before World War II.
   Heavily industrialized Silesia is a region that has been
historically contested by both Germans and Poles.
   Part of Silesia was incorporated into Poland when Poland
regained independence following World War I. The remainder of
Silesia was awarded Poland at the end of World War II to compensate
for land in the east taken away from Poland by the Soviet Union.
   Opole province, 190 miles southwest of Warsaw, has the highest
concentration of ethnic Germans in the country, and Krol and his
father Jan Krol were founders of the area's German Minority
Cultural-Social Society.
   The province's population is about 1 million people.

   A man shot himself to death as he negotiated
with police on the telephone after killing his two grown sons, a
female visitor and wounding his wife with a kitchen knife Monday,
authorities said.
   James W. Breen, 47, kept police at bay for more than two hours
during his pre-dawn rampage, which left the walls of a house in a
quiet subdivision splattered with blood.
   Breen's 48-year-old wife, Virginia, was in fair condition at St.
Joseph's Medical Center in Joliet.
   Mrs. Breen, who suffered knife wounds and was beaten, escaped
from the house near Wilmington about 15 miles south of this
northeastern Illinois town.
   Investigators said they have no motive for the killings, and
neighbors expressed disbelief at the violence.
   ``I would guess anybody else but Breen,'' neighbor Fanny Butler
said. ``They just are not that type of people.''
   The other dead were identified as James M. Breen, 27, Eric T.
Breen, 20; and Victoria Pasinski, 18, of Lockport, who was a
girlfriend of Eric Breen, said Will County sheriff's Lt. Steve
Rathbun.
   The three apparently died without resistance, probably as they
slept, Rathbun said.
   Mrs. Breen alerted neighbors after escaping from the house,
where Eric Breen apparently lived. Authorities said they were
unsure whether the other son also lived there.
   Police were summoned to the house shortly before 3 a.m.
   They established telephone contact with the eldest Breen, who
talked periodically with negotiators until about 5:30 a.m., when
police heard what sounded like a gunshot, Rathbun said. Police
entered the house at 6:05 a.m.
   The father's body was found lying in a bathroom, a .32-caliber
pistol and a portable telephone beside him, the sheriff's spokesman
said. A .22-caliber pistol also was found in the one-story house.
   Eric Breen and Ms. Paskinski were found in a bedroom and the
other son was found lying next to a couch in the living room,
Rathbun said.
   All were casually dressed but were not wearing pajamas.
   Based on physical evidence and statements from Mrs. Breen,
investigators believe the father shot Eric Breen and Ms. Pasinski
first with the .22-caliber pistol, then shot his other son, the
lieutenant said.
   Mrs. Breen, apparently roused by the shots, suffered a
superficial gunshot wound. She struggled with her husband through
the living room, kitchen and out to the back porch, where she was
slashed with a kitchen knife but managed to escape, Rathbun said.

<TEXT>
   The state Senate on Monday approved a bill to
restore the death penalty in New York state, a measure Democratic
Gov. Mario Cuomo has vowed to veto for the eighth straight year.
   The 40-20 vote followed a 2{-hour debate in which the chief
Senate sponsor, Republican Dale Volker, asked his colleagues in the
GOP-controlled chamber ``to send a really dramatic message out to
the streets.''
   But state Sen. Howard Nolan, a Democrat, argued that the death
penalty would have no effect on crime rampant in many sections of
the state.
   The legislation would permit the death penalty for the most
heinous murders, such as contract killings and the slaying of
witnesses.
   The action by the 61-member Senate began what's become an annual
ritual at the state Capitol. Both houses of the Legislature
annually pass the death penalty bill, Cuomo vetoes it, and
legislators then count noses to see if they've got the votes for an
override. Thus far, they have come up short.
   The measure now goes to the Assembly, where a vote isn't
expected on the bill until late February or March, at the earliest.
Only after that would it go to the governor for his promised veto.
   ``I'm confident that we have a better than even shot of
overriding,'' said Volker.
   The 1990 death penalty battle has taken on additional meaning
because the governor's job and all 211 seats in the Legislature go
before the voters in November.
   As in the past, Republicans are expected to make Cuomo's
opposition to the death penalty a major campaign issue.
   The governor, who has said he expects to seek re-election to a
third term this year, is considered a potential 1992 presidential
contender.
   Cuomo, arguing that the death penalty is debasing and not a
deterrent, has called instead for life-without-parole sentences for
some murderers. The state Senate has refused to go along with that
proposal.
   New York state's electric chair hasn't been used since Aug. 15,
1963, when Eddie Lee Mays, convicted of murder in a New York City
bar shooting, became its 695th victim.
   Since then, the state's death penalty law has been gutted by
court decisions. The state Legislature has been unable to put one
back on the books because of the gubernatorial vetoes.
   New York is the largest state without capital punishment.
Thirty-seven states, including California, have death penalty laws.

<HEAD>Writers Guild East Approves Three-Year Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the Writers Guild of America, East,
in New York City and Washington D.C., overwhelmingly approved a
three-year contract with Capital Cities-ABC Monday, the union said.
   The contract for ABC network and local television and radio
employees covers 160 editors, desk assistants, researchers,
production assistants, promotion writers, graphic artists and
newswriters, some of whom also work as producers, according to
union spokesman Martin G. Waldman.
   The agreement, retroactive to Feb. 2, provides wage increases
and other benefits.
   The new pact succeeds a three-year contract signed in 1987
following a bitter seven-week strike against ABC by the Guild.
   The agreement provides for an immediate wage increase of 5
percent and another increase of 5 percent on Aug. 1, 1991, with
additional increases for graphic artists. Waldman said the
increases would raise the average newswriters' salary from $863 to
$949 a week.
   The agreement also provides for new fees for newswriters in
network radio who assume additional technical duties and additional
vacation time for union members who have been with ABC for more
than 15 years.
   The Writers Guild begins negotiating a contract on behalf of
employees at CBS network and local television and radio Tuesday in
New York. That contract expires on March 1, 1990.
   When the ABC agreement was reached last Friday, Jeffrey
Ruthizer, Cap Cities vice president for labor relations, commended
the union for being ``sensitive to the company's need for increased
flexibility.''
   ``... We were able to respond to its concerns with wage
increases and protections important to them,'' he said.
   ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoover declined to add any comment Monday.
   Mona Mangan, executive director of the Writers Guild of America,
East, chief negotiator in the contract talks, said in a statement
the union was ``especially happy that we were once again able to
prevent the network from gutting our contract, this time without
being forced by ABC into a strike situation.''
   Waldman said the union had succeeded in restoring fees for
special duties, such as newswriters doing editing work, that ABC
had planned on ending. He said the Guild had also fought off
management's efforts to have non-Guild members do work normally
done by union members at ``Good Morning America'' and ``News One,''
a television news service for affiliates.

<HEAD>Observers Say Campaign Intimidation, Violence Threaten Nicaragua</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Violence by rebels and threats against
candidates campaigning for the Feb. 25 elections pose serious
obstacles to the democratic process in Nicaragua, according to a
U.N. report.
   The report released Monday by U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar said the U.N. observer mission in Nicaragua also
expressed concerns over attempts by opposition groups to discredit
the nation's electoral authority and the international observers
themselves.
   The report said that during December and January there was
``constant military activity, attributed to groups of the
Nicaraguan resistance, which has taken a tragic toll of life and
has undoubtedly hampered the electoral process.''
   Rebel leaders have denied any involvement, U.N. observers say.
   There also was a considerable increase in the number of reports
of intimidation against candidates during the same period, the
report said.
   ``In the cases reported, pressures range from damage to property
to death threats. Complaints usually involve members of the State
Security Department,'' the report said.
   Elliot Richardson, the U.N. chief's personal representative
monitoring political developments in Nicaragua, discussed the
intimidation with Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega during a
January visit to the Central American nation. Richardson said such
incidents could undermine the credibility of the vote.
   The U.N. observers said Ortega pledged to encourage members of
his ruling party to refrain from any forms of intimidation against
opposition candidates.
   Most of the intimidation appeared to come from local party
members, indicating it did not result from a nationwide effort to
subvert the political process, the U.N. observers said.
   During the past two months there have been substantial
improvements in access to the media for opposition candidates and
groups, according to the U.N. report. Bias observed in the mass
media posed a serious concern in the initial stages of the
campaigns.
   The U.N. observers also said violence at political
demonstrations does not appear to be a cause for concern going into
the final weeks of campaigning for the presidential and national
assembly elections.
   Since violence erupted Dec. 10 at a rally sponsored by the
National Opposition Union, a coalition of 14 parties, there have
been more than 200 public demonstrations with no reports of serious
injuries, the report said.

   The president of a private economics
institute on Monday called Mexico's domestic debt a ``time bomb''
that could do more damage than the foreign debt.
   Jorge Alberto Perez Zogbi of the Mexican International Foreign
Debt Studies Institute spoke in an interview with The Associated
Press the day after President Carlos Salinas de Gortari signed a
widely acclaimed agreement with foreign commercial banks.
   ``They're paying a lot of attention right now to the foreign
debt, but the domestic debt is causing more harm,'' Perez said.
   The accord cuts $7 billion from the $48.5 billion Mexico owes
the banks and reduces interest payments by around $1.6 billion
annually.
   With the agreement, Mexico now owes all foreign lenders a total
of $93.6 billion. Brazil's foreign debt is the highest in the
developing world, at about $114 billion.
   Mexico also owes an additional $48.2 billion to Mexican lenders.
   Perez said the Salinas administration should turn its attention
to the internal debt.
   Although the internal debt is smaller than the foreign debt,
payments are nearly three times as large because of high interest
rates.
   Perez said Mexico will pour $17.4 billion of the $72 billion
federal budget into the coffers of domestic creditors, compared
with $5.56 billion destined for foreign lenders.
   ``Despite the signing of the foreign debt renegotiation, the
internal debt makes adequate health and welfare impossible,'' he
said.
   Perez said the domestic debt has increased 6,000 percent since
1982 and will stand at $57 billion by the end of the year, since
Congress has authorized borrowing of up to $8.8 billion in 1990.
   The internal debt will absorb 7.9 percent of the gross national
product and 24 cents of every taxpayer's dollar this year and the
foreign debt will absorb 2.5 percent, or eight cents of every tax
dollar, he said.

   A woman filed a $10 million libel lawsuit Monday
against the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy and his memoirs' publisher,
claiming she is the woman he implied slept with the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. the night before he was slain.
   The U.S. District Court lawsuit names Abernathy, who was an aide
to King; Harper &amp; Row, which published his book, ``And the Walls
Came Tumbling Down;'' and a Harper &amp; Row editor, Daniel Bial.
   The plaintiff, Adjuda Abi Naantaabuu, said the defendants
``falsely and maliciously charge, and caused the readers of this
book to believe, that she had engaged in adulterous behavior and
sexual relations with Dr. Martin Luther King on the last night of
his life.''
   Naantaabuu, who was identified as a beautician who also works in
the civil rights movement, claimed she has suffered great mental
anguish because she has been ridiculed and her reputation has been
injured.
   In the book, Abernathy wrote that he awoke for a nap in a
woman's living room after a late-night dinner on April 3, 1968, to
see King and the woman emerge from a bedroom.
   The book drew criticism from many of Abernathy's comrades in the
civil rights movement of the 1960s.
   Naantaabuu did not give her version of the story in the lawsuit,
but in earlier interviews has said she was the host of the dinner
and that she and her sister talked with King and another aide in
the living room while Abernathy slept on her bed.
   ``Everyone in Memphis knew that Dr. King had been at my house
the night before his assassination,'' Naantaabuu said in a
statement released by her attorney. ``Dr. Abernathy's book has cast
shadows on my character. Even my own granddaughter asked me whether
I had had an affair with Dr. King.''
   A call to Abernathy's office in Atlanta was unanswered Monday
evening. A spokesman at Harper &amp; Row also could not be reached for
comment.

<TEXT>
   The former prostitute who described
assignations with evangelist Jimmy Swaggart to Penthouse Magazine
got to keep about $54,000 of the $210,000 paid her by Penthouse,
her attorney said Monday.
   ``She's happy. I talked with her on the telephone,'' Louis H.
Schultz said in an interview after announcing settlements with
Murphree's agents and the Internal Revenue Service.
   ``I don't think anybody's happy when they've lost a large amount
of money,'' he said. ``But I'm glad we were able to salvage some.''
   Agents and the IRS had claimed they were owed $428,000 by
Murphree, a major player in the scandal that rocked Swaggart's
religious empire in 1988.
   However, Schultz said their figures were based on inflated
estimates of the amount Penthouse owed for the article and a
promotional tour and _ in the IRS' $217,000 claim _ for income from
prostitution.
   Murphree told Penthouse that Swaggart paid her $20 a visit to
strike prurient poses and perform sexual acts.
   ``The IRS ... figured she was a full-time, 12-hour-a-day working
girl, six days a week, 52 weeks a year on a rather regular basis,''
said Stephen P. High, who handled that claim for Schultz.
   ``On the promotional tour, someone asked about her income as a
prostitute. They put words in her mouth. The IRS took that
figure,'' added Schultz. He said the IRS will take $28,000 as taxes
owed for 1977 through 1979 and for penalties and interest on those
taxes.
   Schultz said last month that, based on a report that 4 million
copies of the July 1988 issue were sold, Penthouse might owe
Murphree $437,000.
   However, he said Monday that further research indicated
Penthouse's lower figures and payment to Murphree were correct.
   The contract, for $75,000 up front plus 25 cents for each issue
above 2.25 million sold, covered only the 2.8 million or so issues
sold in the United States and Canada, he said, though another
million may have been sold overseas.
   He said Murphree got $18,000 of the first $75,000 and will get
about $36,000 from money in dispute until Monday.
   Most of the money has gone or will go to agents, attorneys and
the IRS, he said.
   He said five agents and attorneys had convinced Murphree to let
them represent her in contract talks with firms willing to pay for
her story.
   ``She got herself into a mess of contracts,'' he said.
   With today's settlement, the agencies and one who settled Friday
divide about $52,000, Schultz said.
   He said he and his associates get about $25,000 in fees and
expenses.
   Schultz said Murphree is ``just a housewife in the Midwest'' but
wouldn't say where she is living. Murphree married Samuel W.
Travis, whom she met while doing time for prostitution, in December
1988.
   In February of that year, she was a prostitute working seedy
motels in suburban New Orleans. She claimed that Swaggart, the
Baton Rouge-based television evangelist, was a regular customer in
1987.
   Swaggart tearfully confessed to an unspecified ``moral failure''
and was subsequently defrocked by the fundamentalist Assemblies of
God. Layoffs and cutbacks followed at his multimillion-dollar Jimmy
Swaggart Ministries.

<TEXT>
   Doves that misbehaved over a crowd of
President Daniel Ortega's supporters and a fistfight between two
opposition organizers brought comic relief last weekend to
Nicaragua's electoral campaign.
   It all happened Sunday here and at another small town near the
Honduran border.
   A crowd of 10,000 was giving Ortega a cold reception when he
showed up at the Somoto bullring for a campaign rally organized by
his leftist Sandinista party. When cheerleaders failed to work up
the people, Ortega took over.
   ``I see you sunburned, I see you bored, I see you tired,'' he
chided the crowd, then proceded to release one-by-one six doves _
the symbol of peace. The birds took off and, after a short flight,
two dove straight into the crowd.
   The other four flew a circular course and bombarded the
gathering with more than a few droppings, drawing squeals, screams
and laughter. Things went smoother for Ortega after that.
   Ortega and running mate, Vice President Sergio Ramirez, are
seeking a second six-year term in Feb. 25 elections, against
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and Virgilio Godoy of the United
National Opposition, a coalition of 14 anti-Sandinista parties.
   The president told the rally how the Sandinistas in their 10
years in power had made sure the banks never foreclosed a farm
mortgage when a landowner was too poor to pay.
   The only time a farm mortgage was foreclosed was in 1979 when
Alfredo Cesar was Central Bank president, Ortega said in what was
an obvious dig at Mrs. Chamorro's campaign. Cesar is now a top UNO
adviser.
   ``Is there anyone here whose farm has been seized by the bank
because of an unpaid loan?'' Ortega asked. One peasant raised his
hand and Ortega asked him to come onstage.
   ``When did this happen?'' Ortega asked the man.
   ``About 20 or 18 years ago,'' said the peasant, provoking
laughter.
   ``Oh,'' Ortega exclaimed, smiling.
   Meanwhile, in the town of Posoltega west of here, a fistfight
broke out on the podium while a crowd of about 3,000 UNO supporters
waited for Mrs. Chamorro and running mate Godoy to appear and say
their campaign pieces.
   One contender in the brawl was Antonio Lacayo, Mrs. Chamorro's
son-in-law and campaign manager. Another was Jaime Bonilla, a
member of UNO's top political council.
   Bonilla nearly fell off the stage before onlookers managed to
separate them.
   The cause of the fight was not made public. But the Sandinista
party newspaper Barricada had a field day on Page 1 with the story,
and Sandinista-controlled television aired it on its Sunday night
national newshour.
   Mrs. Chamorro, publisher of the opposition newspaper La Prensa,
has become famous for her occasional absent-mindedness.
   Addressing supporters on one occasion, she mistook the election
date, saying said she was sure she would win the Sept. 25
elections. During another speech, she left a crowd puzzled when she
promised that, when she is elected, hunger will end ``because the
corn will grow in your stomachs.''
   During Sunday's rally, Mrs. Chamorro made no faux pas.

<HEAD>Key Alliance Threatens to Pull Out of Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A key political alliance Monday
threatened to pull out of Haiti's elections unless the military
government allows the return of exiled leaders and moves up the
presidential balloting from October to July.
   The National Alliance for Democracy and Progress is the only
political group left in the campaigning for this year's general
elections and its announcement came as a surprise.
   Marc Bazin, the only officially declared presidential candidate
and leader of the alliance, also gave four other conditions to
participate in the balloting.
   It would be the first since the 1987 voting was canceled
following a massacre at the polls in which armed thugs shot or
hacked to death at least 34 people.
   An alliance statement said the military government's recent
crackdown and state of siege in which political activists were
jailed, beaten or forced into exile cast doubt on whether free and
fair elections could be held.
   All other parties have refused to take part as long as Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril remains in power. But many candidates have also been
jailed or deported. Avril declared a state of siege on Jan. 20, one
day after the assassination of Army Col. Andre Neptune, his wife
and their maid.
   More than 50 opposition politicians and militants were arrested
and beaten at the time; six are still being held and seven were
sent into forced exile.
   The alliance's position was unexpected because last week it
welcomed the lifting of the state of siege on Jan. 29. In a
controversial announcement, it called the move ``an important first
step toward the necessary normalization of the political climate.''
   Avril lifted the declaration after an international outcry.
   He came to power in a 1988 coup but has repeatedly promised to
hold elections.
   The nine-member independent electoral council has set local and
municipal elections for April 29, legislative elections for July 22
and Aug. 5, and presidential elections for Oct. 28, with a runoff
on Nov. 25.
   The alliance said legislative and presidential elections should
be held on the same date in July ahead of local elections.
   ``Our position is clear. If the electoral council does not
modify the timetable, we will not participate in elections,'' Bazin
said at a news conference.
   In addition to allowing the return of exiled leaders, other
conditions set by the alliance for its participation were that the
government respect the constitution, release uncharged political
prisoners and give others a fair trial, and allow the United
Nations to monitor the vote.
   Avril said last Thursday that the exiles could return and that
he hoped they had learned ``a lesson.''
   The new president would be be sworn in Feb. 7, 1991, on the
fifth anniversary of the ouster of dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier,
who fled to a exile in France.
   Avril, a close aide of the Duvalier regime, gained power in
September 1988 when a soldier's rebellion ousted Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy, who took over after a popular uprising forced Duvalier into
exile in France.

   Two U.S. Navy enlisted men were convicted
Monday of raping a Naples woman during a shore leave, and sentenced
to more than four years in jail each, officials said.
   Patrick R. McCoy, 22, a fireman from Portsmouth, Va., and Brian
T. Vaughn, 20, a petty officer from Los Angeles were found guilty
by a Naples criminal court of rape, breaking and entering, assault
with injuries and causing damage to property, said Lt. Paul
Weishaupt, a spokesman for the Navy's Commander Fleet Air
Mediterranean in Naples.
   The sailors planned to appeal the convictions, the U.S. official
said.
   News reports said the pair allegedly raped a 44-year-old woman
in September 1988 while their ship, the USS Yellowstone, was at
port in Naples, used by the U.S. Sixth Fleet.
   They each were ordered to pay $60,000 in damages, Weishaupt said.
   Vaughn received a sentence of four years and six months, while
McCoy was sentenced to four years and 10 months, Weishaupt said.
McCoy was additionally convicted of resisting arrest, he said.
   They would continue to be held under house arrest at the U.S.
base in Naples until the end of the judicial process, Weishaupt
said.

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese
III and Andre Gratchev, Soviet deputy minister for international
affairs, debated at Oxford Monday night on the relative values of
the U.S. Constitution and socialism.
   The motion proposed by Meese at Oxford University's venerable
debating society that ``this house believes that the values of the
American Constitution, not of socialism, will shape the world in
the coming century'' was carried by 351 votes to 235.
   About 1,000 students packed Oxford Union to hear the speeches.
The debating society is a training ground for politicians and a
hotbed of talk, wit and showing-off.
   Opposing the motion, Gratchev urged: ``Do not bury socialism.
Perestroika is being tried by us to allow socialism to win.
Socialism is capable of providing answers to human problems.''
   He said many Western writers had predicted perestroika would
fail because, they said, it was impossible to reform socialism.
   But Gratchev said perestroika involved irreversible change. ``It
will continue to alter the world and profoundly change the nature
of socialism,'' he said.
   ``The purpose of perestroika is to subject socialism to
historical change. The 21st century will be the century of change.
Right now the change is coming from the East, from the Soviet
countries, from Moscow. But it is not anti-capitalist.''
   Meese said socialism had not worked, could not be defended and
was being cast aside.
   He said the value of the U.S. Constitution lay in giving to
people the ability to bring about change through democratic
processes.
   ``We recognize the Constitution will not solve all the problems
of mankind, but it allows the process whereby people can attempt to
solve problems through their elected representatives,'' Meese said.
   He said this was a potential recognized by more and more
oppressed people.
   ``That is why a copy of the Statue of Liberty was raised in
Tiananmen Square,'' he said, referring to the pro-democracy
demonstrations crushed by Chinese troops in Beijing last year.

   Eliot Frankel, an NBC television
network producer for at least 30 years, died of cancer Sunday
night. He was 67.
   Frankel worked with NBC in the early 1950s and was with ``The
Today Show'' on its first broadcast.
   He was senior producer of the Huntley-Brinkley evening newscast
from 1956-1963, then moved to London to work as a European producer
until 1966.
   He worked for news and documentary programs until 1984, when he
was a political consultant to NBC during the presidential elections.
   Frankel later taught at Vanderbilt University and Rutgers

<TEXT>
   A Honduran businessman already sentenced to
life in prison on federal drug trafficking charges refused Monday
to enter a plea to a conspiracy charge in the killing of U.S. drug
agent Enrique Camarena.
   Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros appeared in court under heavy
security with three other men, including Ruben Zuno Arce, the
brother-in-law of former Mexican President Luis Echeverria.
   The three other men pleaded innocent to the 1985 torture-slaying
of Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie entered an innocent plea on
behalf of Matta. Matta's attorney argued that a plea was not
appropriate because his client was brought to the United States
illegally to face charges.
   ``He was kidnapped by agents of the United States from his
homeland in Honduras in violation of the extradition treaty and the
United States Constitution and was tortured by those agents,'' said
Matta's attorney, Martin Stolar.
   Matta's extradition to the United States from Honduras in 1988
sparked riots that left five people dead and the U.S. Embassy annex
burned.
   Three federal judges have ruled the extradition was legal.
   Stolar also said the case has received ``highly prejudicial
publicity'' since last month's airing on NBC-TV of ``Drug Wars,'' a
miniseries about Camarena's slaying.
   Matta, 45, was sentenced last month to life in prison without
the possibility of parole following his conviction on seven
charges, including conspiracy, possession and distribution of
narcotics, and running a criminal enterprise.
   The judge scheduled trial on the latest charges for April 10. If
convicted, all four defendants could receive life sentences.
   Matta is charged with conspiracy to commit violent crimes in aid
of racketeering and conspiracy to kidnap a federal agent.
   Zuno Arce, a millionaire Mexican businessman, also was charged
with committing violent crimes in aid of racketeering and
conspiracy to kidnap a federal agent.
   Prosecutors say Zuno Arce owned the Guadalajara home where
Camarena was slain.
   Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez, arrested by U.S. agents July 27, was
charged with conspiracy to kidnap a federal agent and committing
violent crimes in aid of racketeering.
   Javier Vasquez Velasco, arrested Oct. 12, is charged with two
counts of committing violent crimes in aid of racketeering in the
murders of John Walker and Alberto Radelat in 1985 in Guadalajara.

   The University of Notre Dame bucked the College
Football Association and became the first college to sell its home
football games to a major network by agreeing Monday to a five-year
contract with NBC beginning in 1991.
   ABC and ESPN thought they had acquired rights to Notre Dame home
games when they agreed to exclusive contracts with the CFA, which
consists of 64 schools.
   But the deal by the Fighting Irish, a member of the CFA, created
the possibility that other colleges might defect from the CFA's
package. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
   ABC announced Jan. 17 that it had purchased rights to the CFA
for $210 million over five years. ESPN announced Oct. 4, 1989, that
it had bought the group's cable rights for $110 million over five
years.
   ``It would be premature to speculate on how the CFA membership
may be affected,'' said David Ogrean, CFA assistant executive
director for television. ``The CFA television committee will review
the situation and consult with the membership. Both ABC and ESPN,
with whom the CFA has agreements commencing in 1991, have expressed
interest in continuing their relationship with the CFA.
   ABC said in a statement that it intends to ``pursue all remedies
available to protect its agreement with the CFA from interference
by third parties, including NBC Sports, and to ensure participation
of all CFA'' schools. ESPN declined to comment.
   In a news conference Monday in South Bend, Ind., to announce the
deal, Notre Dame said it had not given the CFA any guarantees it
would be part of the new television package.
   NBC said it was legally free to conclude a deal with the
Fighting Irish since the school had not committed to the CFA's
package.
   ``We did not interfere with an existing relationship,'' said NBC
Sports President Dick Ebersol.
   Ebersol said that, for now, NBC would not attempt to sign
contracts with other schools. However, he said NBC ``would stand by
and see what the developments are in the other schools.''
   Sam Jankovich, athletic director at the University of Miami,
said he would not rule out a similar plan for the Hurricanes, the
1989 national champions.
   The Notre Dame package will begin with a Sept. 7, 1991 visit by
Indiana. Notre Dame will play six home games a year during the
contract against 16 opponents.
   The agreement will not prohibit Notre Dame road games from being
televised by other networks or cable stations.
   Ogrean said the deal does not affect Notre Dame's status in the
CFA.
   ``The involvement with the television package is separate from
being involved with the CFA,'' said Notre Dame executive vice
president E. William Beauchamp.
   University athletic director Dick Rosenthal said he had had
problems with ABC's plan to show many games on a regional basis
when its new deal begins in 1991. ``It would almost be better for
us not be on than to be on in only part of the country,'' he said.

   Eliot Frankel, a former producer of
NBC-TV's Huntley-Brinkley Report and an award-winning television
journalist, died of cancer. He was 67.
   Frankel died Sunday night at St. Peter's Hospital.
   In a career that spanned more than 30 years, most of them at
NBC, Frankel worked as a writer, editor and producer on dozens of
major news stories, including Winston Churchill's funeral and every
national political convention and presidential election from 1956
to 1984.
   In 1964 and 1968, Frankel coordinated live reports from the
convention floor.
   From 1969 to 1975, he was executive producer of ``First
Tuesday,'' the industry's first prime-time monthly news magazine.
The show won many awards during Frankel's tenure, including four
Emmys.
   After retiring from NBC in 1980, he accepted a position as
associate vice chancellor for news and public affairs at Vanderbilt
University, where he remained for five years before returning to
his native New Jersey
   Survivors include Frankel's wife, Charlotte; two sons, Charles,
38, and Mark, 33; and one grandchild.
   The funeral service is private. A memorial service is planned
for Friday at Kirkpatrick Chapel at Rutgers University.

   The Export-Import Bank has granted a

   The $9.75 million loan, which was signed on Friday, is to help

   The bank official, who spoke to The Associated Press on

U.S.-Chinese commercial relations.
   ``It's not that big, and it was something that was in the

   The Harvard Law Review has elected its
first black president in more than 100 years of publication at
Harvard Law School.
   Barack Obama, a 28-year-old second-year law student, was elected
in balloting Sunday by last year's editors. Obama, a native of
Hawaii, succeeds Peter Yu, the publication's first Asian-American
president.
   Obama said his election shouldn't be seen as a sign social
barriers have broken down.
   ``I wouldn't want people to see my election as a symbol that
there aren't problems out there with the situation of
African-Americans in society,'' he said. ``From experience I know
that for every one of me there are a hundred, or thousand, black
and minority students who are just as smart and just as talented
and never get the opportunity.''
   But Obama also said his presidency ``sends a signal out that
blacks can excel in competitive situations like scholarship. It's
also a sign of progress.'
   The review, founded in 1887, is published eight times a year and
contains legal articles by professors, scholars and students
throughout the United States, law school spokesman Michael Chmura
said.
   Each year, about 30 students serve as editors of the review. The
students are generally at the top of their classes, Chmura said.
   The student elected president works for one year coordinating
the work of the other editors, and has final say over the review's
contents, he said.
   Obama, who received his undergraduate degree from Columbia
University in 1983, took time off before law school for social work
on the South Side of Chicago. He said he would like to someday
return to community work, and has not ruled out a future in
politics.

   President Bush's new defense budget doesn't
offer a long-range vision for the Pentagon in a time of
revolutionary change, but it gives some short-term clues about how
this commander-in-chief wants the military to prepare for the years
to come.
   Bush said his $292.1 billion defense budget for 1991 offers a
chance to ``restructure America's defenses'' in the wake of
Europe's revolutionary changes, and he made headlines with last
week's proposal to strip hundreds of thousands of U.S. and Soviet
troops from the European continent.
   But the budget proposal also reveals a conservative,
take-it-slow approach in many areas.
   The 1991 plan takes only tentative steps into a new era with a
modest troop reduction of 38,000 in the coming year, cutbacks in
about 20 minor conventional weapon programs, and continued funding
for several futuristic weapons systems from the Reagan
administration, such as the Strategic Defense Initiative.

   The death of noted Western artist John
Clymer has not dampened enthusiasm in his hometown for building an
elaborate museum in the artist's memory.
   The Clymer Museum already is functioning in a temporary setting,
and fund raising is moving ahead for a much larger facility which
is expected to open later this year.
   The museum is a huge undertaking for art lovers in Ellensburg, a
ranching and university town of 11,000 people located 100 miles
east of Seattle. But the need to honor a native son is important,
said Janice Ludtka, president of the Clymer Foundation.
   ``We think of him as our Rockwell in this area,'' she said.
   The comparison to Norman Rockwell is appropriate because
Clymer's original claim to fame was the more than 80 covers he
painted for the Saturday Evening Post. Rockwell's celebrity also
rested on his Post covers.
   Clymer supporters already have purchased a large building in
downtown Ellensburg, but still need $200,000 for renovations and
aren't sure where they're going to get it, Ludtka said.
   ``We have really saturated our own community and businesses and
individuals,'' she said.
   After a campaign that included donation canisters in restaurants
and special Clymer sales by local merchants, supporters are now
seeking corporate donations from large Washington businesses and
government assistance.
   They also have secured a $75,000 grant from a local trust, but
that is contingent on raising matching funds, Ludtka said.
   Clymer was born in 1907 and died last Nov. 2 after an extended
illness. He attended art school in Vancouver, British Columbia, and
then made his reputation as a commercial artist. He married Doris
Schnebly in 1932, and she became his researcher.
   In 1964, Clymer stopped doing commercial work and concentrated
on painting historically accurate Western scenes and wildlife. His
original paintings were selling in the $100,000 range during his
lifetime.
   He lived his later years in Teton Village, Wyo., and was a
member of the prestigious Cowboy Artists of America.
   The idea of a Clymer Museum arose out of the Western Art
Association, which for 17 years has mounted one of the Northwest's
largest art shows and auctions in Ellensburg. A separate Clymer
Museum Board was created to keep the two projects separate.
   The Western Art Association will rent space for its headquarters
in the new Clymer Museum building.
   The association has been operating out of a small storefront
gallery in Ellensburg's historic downtown. Since 1988 that space
also has served as the temporary Clymer Museum.
   The Western Art Association owns five of Clymer's paintings, and
the new museum expects to acquire more as gifts and loans.
   Clymer's death at age 82 has sparked an even greater interest in
his work. ``Death does enhance the popularity of an artist
sometimes,'' said Jo Leal Clark, manager of the Western Art
Association.
   Speculation already is beginning on the value of limited edition
signed prints of Clymer's works, since there will be no more, she
said.
   The new museum will be located in a 17,000-square foot building,
also in the charming historic district. It used to house a Bonanza
88 store.
   But even this is not the permanent home. Long-term plans call
for building a brand-new museum on land that has been donated to
the art association.

   Today is Saturday, Feb. 17, the 48th day of 1990. There are 317
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On Feb. 17, 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its ``one man,
one vote'' decision, ruling that congressional districts within
each state must be roughly equal in population.
   In 1897, the forerunner of the National PTA, the National
Congress of Mothers, was founded in Washington.
   In 1904, Giacomo Puccini's opera ``Madama Butterfly'' received a
poor reception at its premiere at La Scala in Milan, Italy.
   In 1947, the Voice of America began broadcasting to the Soviet
Union.
   In 1981, Pope John Paul II arrived in Manila for the second
visit to the Philippines by a pope.
   In 1986, Johnson and Johnson, maker of ``Tylenol,'' announced it
would no longer sell over-the-counter medications in capsule form,
following the death of a woman who had taken a cyanide-laced
capsule.
   In 1988, Lt. Col. William Higgins, an American officer serving
with a United Nations truce monitoring group, was kidnapped in
southern Lebanon. (His captors later claimed to have killed him.)
   Ten years ago: U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim completed
formation of a commission to investigate Iranian grievances against
the deposed shah.
   Five years ago: Murray P. Haydon, a retired auto worker, became
the third person to receive a permanent artificial heart as doctors
at Humana Hospital Audubon in Louisville, Ky., implanted the
device. (Haydon lived 488 days with the heart.)
   One year ago: Iran's president, Ali Khamenei, said Salman
Rushdie, author of ``The Satanic Verses,'' could save himself from
a death sentence pronounced by Ayatollah Khomeini if he were to
apologize for his book.
   Today's birthdays: Singer Marian Anderson is 88. Sportscaster
Red Barber is 82. Margaret Truman Daniel is 66. Actor Hal Holbrook
is 65. Actor Alan Bates is 56. Former football star Jim Brown is
54. Actress Mary Ann Mobley is 51.
   Thought for today: ``The passion for setting people right is in
itself an afflictive disease.'' _ Marianne Moore, American poet
(1887-1972).

<HEAD>Democrats Search for a Campaign Theme</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On paper, there's a promising catalogue of
issues for Democrats to claim as they head into the congressional
campaign season. But it's still multiple choice, with no consensus
on a theme.
   Among the prospects: the peace dividend, proposed tax
reductions, the dispute over budget priorities and deficits,
Democratic insistence that the administration is shortchanging
national needs in education and the war on drugs.
   Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic national chairman, says his
party will rally around clear, salable campaign issues, and soon.
   At least he hopes so.
   ``We don't have consensus on the one-liners,'' he said. But he
and the party's congressional hierarchy are working on it.
   That's evidence of a frustration that always confronts the party
out of White House power, the Democrats' lot for all but four of
the past 21 years. They have to negotiate policy and political
strategy, among factions whose differences can mute the message.
   President Bush doesn't have that problem. His one-line refrain
is three words long, two years old, and still working for him: ``no
new taxes.''
   The Democrats haven't yet found an antidote.
   Brown thinks there may be one in Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's
proposal to cut Social Security taxes, a reduction that would be
worth $330 to middle income Americans next year. Moynihan, a New
York Democrat, said he proposed it because the administration is
misusing Social Security reserves to mask the size of the federal
deficit.
   ``I'd like to see the Democratic Party strongly on that issue,''
Brown said in an interview. He said it may need fine tuning, but it
is the kind of proposal with which Democrats can dramatize their
differences with the Republican administration.
   ``I think that's the kind of comparison we need to be drawing,''
Brown said, ``George Bush fighting for a cut in the capital gains
tax and here Democrats are fighting for a cut in taxes for working
people, middle-income people ...
   ``And those are the kind of distinctions that I think are clear
and concise and simple enough so the American people begin to
understand the points that we're trying to make and they begin to
crystallize,'' he said.
   But Democratic congressional leaders haven't yet been able to
crystallize their own positions, let alone a party push for the tax
cut. They have not endorsed the measure, now before the Senate
Finance Committee.
   Even if they were to agree, there's a trap waiting in the House,
where Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., signed up the Democratic
members of his tax-writing Ways and Means Committee to a 1989 bill
to protect the Social Security trust fund. It would require that
any changes in taxes or benefits be neutral in their impact on the
overall revenues flowing into the Social Security.
   Bush and his Republican allies call the Moynihan proposal a
charade that would lead to a general tax increase. They also
contend that it could lead to reductions in future Social Security
benefits. ``I hope it's dead and I think it is,'' Bush said in an
interview with the Wall Street Journal.
   And if it isn't, he said, he'll veto it anyhow.
   That's the kind of consistent, head-on theme the Democrats lack,
on the tax proposal and on other issues.
   It is the gap Brown wants filled. ``We ought to be, in a pretty
stark way, indicating what our differences are,'' he said.
   But party chairmen can only urge, advise, organize and
orchestrate. They don't control issues. Elected officeholders make
the decisions and therefore the record.

<HEAD>National Geographic Special Visits Exotic Bali</HEAD>

   Producer Miriam Birch began suggesting a
National Geographic television special on Bali not long after her
first visit to the Indonesian island.
   ``I went to Bali before it had an international airport and
before the big tourist boom,'' she said. ``I went there on a
pleasure trip and absolutely fell in love with it. I thought it was
the most magical and exotic place I'd ever seen.''
   That's high praise from a producer who's spent her career
journeying to beautiful and exotic places, from Egypt to Leningrad,
to make television documentaries.
   Birch began lobbying for the Bali show soon after she was hired
11 years ago by WQED-TV in Pittsburgh as a writer-producer for the
National Geographic Specials. She, of course, got her wish. ``Bali,
Masterpiece of the Gods'' will be broadcast Wednesday on PBS as the
second show in the National Geographic Special's 25th anniversary
series.
   The special captures Bali's distinctive culture, in which
religion and the arts are mixed with everyday life.
   ``Nearly everyone in Bali is an artist,'' Birch said. ``They
dance or paint or play a musical instrument. They have a special
relationship between life and art and God.
   ``One of the first questions people ask is whether tourism has
hurt Bali. In the show, one man says, `Yes, it's lowered the
standards for art in some cases. People are creating things just
for tourists.' I thought that was a very Balinesian answer.''
   The one-hour special is cast with the gentle, peaceful Balinese,
an island people whose ancestors include Malaysians, Polynesians,
Indians and Chinese.
   The people are Agama Hindi, a mixture of Hindu and the
indigenous animistic religion that's practiced nowhere else on
earth. Besides its vibrant, multi-colored art and haunting music,
the film also displays Bali's spectacular mountains, beaches and
stair-step rice terraces.
   When she finally got the go-ahead, Birch went on an exploratory
visit with Tom Skinner, the executive producer from WQED, and
Dennis Kane, formerly executive producer for the National
Geographic Society. At the same time, they also visited Singapore
and Shanghai.
   Birch returned for another month of researching the story. After
writing the script in Los Angeles, she spent another 10 weeks in
Bali doing the special with her film crew.
   ``When I went back the last time, I knew the people, events and
places we wanted to film,'' she said. ``We arranged to be there for
their most important religious holidays. ...
   ``We were filming a high priest in a small town giving
blessings. He called me over and gave me a Balinese blessing. He
poured water over my hands, put a flower in my hand and put rice on
my forehead. It was a profound and moving experience. I hadn't
asked for it or expected it and I could feel the sincerity of the
priest.''
   Birch also has produced specials on Jerusalem, Ireland and its
horses, Japan, the Chinese panda, the Soviet circus and Hong Kong.
Her 10th special, ``Voices of Leningrad,'' is set for April 4.
   ``I was scheduled to do a film on Shanghai,'' she said. ``I'd
already written the treatment and it had been accepted. I was on
vacation in Italy when events exploded in Beijing. That show went
on the shelf and I went to Leningrad.
   ``The Leningrad film, which is set within the context of its
history, is the most issue-oriented program ever for National
Geographic,'' she said. ``It tells what the Soviet people are going
through now with glasnost and Gorbachev. When Peter the Great
founded the city as St. Petersburg, it was a revolutionary idea. It
was on the edge of the Russian empire, it was on the swampy mouth
of the Neva River and it would be the northernmost metropolis in
the world. It's a beautiful city, but to this day, it's still a
cold, miserable place.''

   ``I'm a documentary producer,'' says Jeff
Harmon. ``What I do is document history.''
   During the war in Afghanistan, he did it the hard way _ with one
program about the rebels, then another about the Soviet troops.
   On Sunday, Ted Turner's TBS Superstation, which aired Harmon's
first show in 1986 and the other in December, is repeating the
second, ``Afghanistan: The Soviet Experience.''
   Vietnam vets in particular might find some of its scenes eerily
familiar. There's no triple canopy jungle, to be sure. But there
are the contour-flying helicopters, the door gunners watching the
ground, the dusty hill outposts resupplied by chopper and the
convoy-guarding armored personnel carrier rolling along, its young
driver listening to Western rock on his boombox.
   Another deja vu moment, in a Kabul hospital: The wounded Soviet
grunt who, according to the show's English translation, complains
that in this war, ``you can't understand who are the civilians and
who are the enemies.''
   The two programs _ the first is ``Afghanistan's Holy War'' _
were filmed three years apart and shown on TBS' National Geographic
Explorer series.
   Harmon, 36, was born in Los Angeles. Based in London, but
``living out of my suitcase now,'' he says he's ``basically
self-educated,'' with a year logged at New York University's film
school.
   He did his first Afghanistan war documentary out of plain
curiosity: ``The image of these 19th century tribesmen battling a
superpower intrigued the hell out of me. And I got sucked into the
image and went.''
   Bankrolled by the BBC, Harmon and cameraman Alexander Lindsay
emulated other correspondents trying to cover the rebels after
Soviet troops were sent to Afghanistan in 1979. The two slipped
across the border from Pakistan in 1985.
   His aim, he says, was to show the war from the grunt-level
perspective of the Soviet-fighting rebels, the mujahideen, ``the
muj'' (pronounced ``mooj''), as some Westerners call them.
   ``I don't go in with a correspondent or make myself a
correspondent,'' he says. ``I tell the story of the people I'm
covering. I do it through their eyes. ... I don't whitewash
anything. I don't take a partisan view.''
   Indeed, he says, some rebel political leaders got upset at his
documentary about the rebel troops, including what the troops
thought of their leaders and ``their real way of life,'' including
that some smoked hashish.
   The leaders considered all that bad for the rebel image, says
Harmon. His opinion of them isn't kind: ``They were like World War
I generals. To them, their men ... out on the front lines, were
cannon fodder.''
   Harmon wanted to film the Soviet GIs' side of the war, but
didn't have high hopes. Having been with the rebels trying to kill
them, he thought, would not exactly make him welcome, not even in
the new era of Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost easing access for
Western journalists.
   To his surprise, he says, the Soviets granted him a visa when he
sought to cover, for Britain's Independent Television News, the
start of the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1988. His
theory is that Soviet officials had seen his earlier documentary
and at least thought it honest.
   Visa in hand, he hurriedly called National Geographic officials
in the United States, got the green light for a full-length
documentary and, with cameraman Lindsay, went to work. He says he
told Soviet officials in Kabul this:
   ``I'm not going to make a propaganda film for you. But I'm not
going to do a hatchet job on you, either. All I want to do is show
the war through the eyes of the ordinary Ivan.''
   Word of the unusual travels fast in any army. Most Soviet grunts
and helicopter pilots he met already knew he'd covered the rebel
side of the war, Harmon says. But he found little, if any,
animosity toward him, he says:
   ``They were fascinated by the fact we'd covered the war on the
other side. The soldiers, they were so curious, so `What was the
enemy like?' I think they looked at me as a chance to see what it
was like on the other side.''

leather chairs: one for Sajak, one for the guest. Other changes

   From the California deserts to the coniferous
coast of Maine, from the Cascades of Washington to the Florida
Everglades, the ranks of environmentalists are swelling and so are
their coffers and the lands they control. No longer Don Quixotes

   When the Nature Conservancy bought 502 square
miles of New Mexico _ 90 percent of a mountain range and a more
diverse population of mammals than any national park in the United
States _ it was hailed as a milestone.
   It certainly was. But the purchase in late January was also the
culmination of an explosion of conservation efforts in the last 10
years.
   A new breed of conservationists is buying up big chunks of the
American landscape, stamping the land inviolate to the bulldozer's
blade.
   How much money the conservancy paid for the Gray Ranch in New
Mexico astride the Continental Divide wasn't made public. But it
was probably in the neighborhood of $18 million, a sum that would
have sounded improbable to a conservationist's ears a decade ago.
   What it brought under the conservancy's protection was almost
all the Animas Mountain range; some 100 plant and animal species
listed as endangered, threatened or rare; 13 pre-Columbian
archaeological digs and hundreds of others as yet unexplored; herds
of Chihuahuan pronghorn antelope; seven different habitat types
from desert grassland to chaparral and coniferous forest; and
endangered bits of nature from the white-eared hummingbird to the
night blooming cereus.
   The conservancy acted when it discovered the ranch owners wanted
to sell and there was the threat the land might be broken up and
developed.
   Conservancy president John C. Sawhill, announcing the buy, said,
``Few intact natural systems of this caliber exist in the world
today. The ... effort also represents the future trend for the
Nature Conservancy and its partners. To truly insure our natural
world for future generations, we are developing creative ways to
safeguard much larger landscapes.''
   A few years ago, such an effort would have been only a dream,
but conservationists are becoming sophisticated advocates _
scientists, business graduates, experts in law and real estate.
   Inch by precious inch they are preserving farmland, wilderness
and open spaces against development, more effectively than ever
before.
   The Nature Conservancy is a sort of symbol for individuals and
other land trusts. Before the New Mexico deal, it was taking an
average of 1,000 acres a day out of commercial play.
   Says Mike Dennis, general counsel of the conservancy, ``For
every scientist we have around here, we probably have an MBA, a tax
lawyer and a real estate attorney.''
   Environmentalists have sharpened their skills in the private
sector, recycling many of the same dollars each time to buy new
land. They have discovered revolving funds, a war fund that doesn't
have to stay invested. They can plunk down several million dollars
until, by prior arrangement, a government agency can repay them,
assuming custodial care of the property.
   Or they can buy a piece of property, deprive it of the potential
for commercial development, and resell the land for a somewhat
lesser cost to what they think is an appropriate buyer.
   Who is that buyer? A farmer who will farm without being tempted
by high developer prices, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service which
wants to protect the land, or a trust that is able to preserve the
land as open space, a vista, a place apart.
   In any case, the conservationists send the resale dollars back
into their revolving funds to be used again.
   None of these organizations or individuals could succeed without
local support. When a developer wanted to take a 147-acre scenic
hay meadow in Jackson Hole, Wyo., to put in 70 to 80 houses, the
local land trust negotiated an option on the land priced at $1.5
million.
   The county came up with one-third and the land trust raised the
rest from private donations.
   Says Ms. Jean Hocker, director of the Land Trust Alliance, an
umbrella organization in Washington for hundreds of local land
trusts, ``The community heard about it and came to the rescue.''
The deal took three months. Speed is important.
   There are more than 800 local land trusts established in states,
counties and communities _ almost half of them formed in the past
10 years. They protect about 2 million acres and they own 300,000.
Some of them have million-dollar budgets.
   Sometimes conservationists act in concert.
   The McQuerry Ranch, 3,500 acres at the foot of the 11,000-foot
peaks of Nevada's Ruby Mountains, was in financial trouble, the
family in danger of losing the land they had farmed for generations.
   A third of the ranch is a unique desert wetland area around
Franklin Lake, the kind of terrain that attracts resort
development.It is also a nesting area for migratory birds.
   The American Farmland Trust suggested to the Nature Conservancy
that the best way to preserve the land was to enhance the way in
which the farm was operated by the family.

   The migratory birds and the wetland fit the conservancy's
charter. With $300,000 from its revolving fund, the
conservationists bought the ranch and leased it back to the
McQuerry family with certain conditions.
   The family would have to change certain farming operations. For
instance, they would not be permitted to graze the wetland area
from fall to the following summer when the birds use the estuary.
   When the family was able, they would buy the ranch back, but
those covenants would remain.
   ``If we hadn't stepped in, certainly the family was going into
bankruptcy,'' says Ralph Grossi, president of the American Farmland
Trust. ``They would have lost the farm.''
   The farmland trust felt there was a real danger of development
to the land and the natural ecosystem around the lake.
   The United States covers some 3,600,000 square miles or 2.3
trillion acres. Of those, 78,000 square miles or almost 50 million
acres are inland waterways. There are also more than 88,000 miles
of tidal shoreline.
   Conservationist groups can't protect it all, nor, they say,
should they. Often they seek to cooperate with developers, allowing
residential uses, but sequestering other areas. In some cases,
developers pay mitigation fees for the damage their developments
might cause. Those funds are used to enhance the protected land.
   Says the Nature Conservancy's Dennis: ``When you're talking
about an ecosystem, you could be talking about anything from 5,000
acres to 500 square miles.''
   So he outlines a compromise, a core that the conservationists
want to own and manage. Around that they would establish a larger
area where timbering and mining are banned. ``Then you may want an
additional buffer where development is OK, but it's got to be
limited. You may allow a cluster of homes here on 2-to 5-acre
tracts and preserve farmland over there.''
   Even individuals are taking a page from their book and designing
small local operations to save such properties as a farm in
Virginia or 400 acres of rolling countryside in Connecticut. The
farm remained a farm, and the Connecticut tract is now home to an
organically safe golf course.
   In the array of people in the conservation army, there is also
an array of purposes.
   The Nature Conservancy's 542,000 members, dedicated to
preserving habitats, have financed a $600 million organization that
has saved almost 4 million sensitive acres since it was founded in
1953. It has 1,000 employees and probably 10,000 volunteers and
covers every state
   Considerably younger (10 years old) and smaller (a staff of 30
nationwide) is the American Farmland Trust, dedicated to saving the
nation's farms and improving farming techniques. Yet, it churns
accounts of more than $2 million to get more acres for the buck.
   ``We are concerned about the debt burden in agriculture,'' says
the trust's president, Ralph Grossi. ``Many farmers are going out
of business and their land isn't being cared for adequately.''
   Organizations from the National Wildlife Federation to the
Audubon Society, from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to Ducks
Unlimited, a hunter's group, often find themselves working in
concert.
   They all have one thing in common. They can move more quickly
than local or state governments can, and, using charitable tax
benefits, they can bring in a deal cheaper than developers can.
   By stripping a piece of land of development rights, it is not
only protected regardless of who owns it, but income tax benefits
can either bring the owner a sizable tax deduction or provide
instant cash for a farmer.
   It also reduces the value of the land and hence its tax
assessment, which deprives the county or state of some tax revenue.
But counties and states usually are willing to forgo taxes on some
property to enhance the value of land around it.
   Witness New York's Gov. Mario Cuomo, who has asked for $1.9
billion to set aside areas of the Empire State for scenic and
recreation purposes. California has provided more than $700 million
for similar purposes, and Florida has an active land acquisition
program.
   But the smallest of communities can be stirred to action.
Michigan's west coast is a beautiful blend of dunes, orchards and
sandy beaches on Lake Michigan. It is a magnet for those wanting
second homes, and unlike the coast of California, which it mimics
in miniature, it has no coastal commission to protect it.
   Local land trusts, with the help of the Farmland Trust, moved in
to buy a 507-acre farm on the Old Mission Peninsula, blocking any
further residential development. It will remain an orchard in an
area that prides itself as being the ``Cherry Capital of the
World.''
   ``It's unlikely that some crops will be grown in any quantity in
the United States 30 to 40 years from now,'' says Grossi of the
Farmland Trust. ``The growing areas that are required, the climate,
the soil, the weather, those unique values are essentially the same
as those that attract people.''

   The Nature Conservancy has been busy capturing
islands from sea to shining sea to provide habitats for rare,
threatened and endangered creatures.
   In the process, it has led its negotiators into some strange and
complicated deals.
   For example: Shelter Island off the tip of New York's Long
Island, 6,000 bucolic acres just two hours by car from the towers
of New York City.
   A third of it was the Mashomack Hunt Club, owned by the Girard
family, which felt very strongly about keeping it a wildlife
preserve.
   It was held by a family-owned realty company that also held
other family properties.
   The family wanted to make a substantial gift of land, but it
also wanted to realize some cash from the holdings that included
nine brownstones near Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, warehouse
property in Miami, and a number of oil and gas wells.
   What to do?
   Conservancy experts worked out an elaborate deal. The family
sold the realty company to the conservancy for less than the market
value, reaping a charity tax deduction. The conservancy then sold
off the brownstones, the gas and oil wells and the warehouses and
raised the rest of the $12 million it owed the family for the
realty company.
   Today, the Mashomack Preserve, on the Atlantic flyway, is home
for flocks of migratory birds, including the elusive osprey.
   Matagordo Island is tiny by comparison. The U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service desperately wanted the last parcel to go with the
rest it managed in partnership with the Texas wildlife service.
   The island's inhabitants include about 140 whooping cranes,
millions of ducks and other waterfowl.
   The conservancy again stepped in and bought the land,
transferring it to the wildlife service as federal funds became
available.
   Had they waited, the land would have fallen to the 40 or so
heirs of the man who owned it and consensus is difficult under
those circumstances. He died of a heart attack only months after
the deal was made.
   Sometimes a gift becomes an ecological headache.
   Santa Cruz Island is one of the Channel Islands off the coast of
California. Over the years the owner gave most of the 60,000 acres
to the Nature Conservancy.
   A century and a half ago, sheep were introduced to what was
largely a cattle ranch. The sheep ran wild, eventually numbering up
to 40,000. The conservancy brought in Navajo shepherds to round
them up. It didn't work.
   They went to the association of sheep ranchers, who were of no
help and were plainly disturbed lest that much mutton be dumped on
the market all at once.
   Finally and regrettably, fencing off a square mile at a time,
the sheep were killed.
   Sheep, as any reader of Westerns will tell you, eat the grass
down to the roots. When the conservancy got the land, the island
was a dead brown. Today, all but 10,000 privately held acres in the
south are green, and home to specific island species such as the
Santa Cruz kit fox, island jay and others.
   Sometime in the future, the last privately held parcel will be
turned over to the National Park Service, which manages all the
Channel Islands, and it will be green again.

   Proposals to ease a growing water shortage in
the arid Middle East range from building a 1,500-mile pipeline to
towing icebergs from Antarctica. Whatever is done, scientists say,
time is running out. The water crisis can only intensify
hostilities in the troubled region.

   A shortage of water brought on by a
population explosion is aggravating tensions in the volatile Middle
East and could lead to what one study calls an ``unprecedented
upheaval.''
   ``Water is more important than oil in this region,'' says
Egyptian economist Mostafa el-Said, a former economy minister.
   Growing industrial development and increasingly crowded cities
in the region have increased the demand for water in recent years.
The problem has been intensified by severe droughts over the last
decade, with five of six years the hottest years this century.
   The crisis came sharply into focus in mid-January when Turkey
blocked off much of the water in the 1,460-mile Euphrates River
that flows southward through Syria and Iraq to the Persian Gulf.
   To chants of ``Allah is great,'' President Turgut Ozal pushed a
button that lowered an 87-ton concrete plug into the diversion
channel under the dam, the fifth largest in the world.
   Despite protests from Iraq and Syria, the Turks planned to
staunch the flow of the river for one month to fill up the
reservoir for the giant Ataturk hydroelectric dam in southeastern
Anatolia province, the centerpiece of an extensive irrigation and
development program to aid the impoverished region.
   Ankara gave Damascus and Baghdad several weeks' warning, and
even increased the flow of water before the cutoff to compensate.
   But the Turkish move reminded Syria and Iraq of just how
vulnerable their water supply is.
   Baghdad's al-Thawra daily, an organ of the ruling Baath Arab
Socialist Party, warned that the long-term fall in the Euphrates
flow could cause ``a real agricultural disaster'' in Iraq,
affecting 3.2 million acres of prime farmland in the Mesopotamian
basin.
   It warned that if Turkey does not share the Euphrates water,
``relations could he harmed.''
   Scientists say not enough has been done to head off disaster.
Proposals range from a Turkish proposal for a $21 billion ``peace
pipeline'' to carry water for sale 1,500 miles south to the Arabian
peninsula to towing icebergs from the Antarctic to Saudi Arabia.
   For most countries, with the exception of Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait, desalination plants on the scale needed are simply too
expensive.
   ``In this overheated atmosphere of political hostilities,
complicated by insufficient water to meet the needs of developing
societies, the latent tensions may develop into domestic conflicts
and expand to regional ones,'' Professor Elias Salameh of Jordan
University's Water Research and Study Center said at a recent
seminar in Nicosia.
   ``Water will determine the future of the Middle East,'' he said.
``The population of the region will double by the year 2010. We
need twice as much water as we have now.''
   There are an estimated 210 million Arabs now spread across 21
countries. The population is growing at an average of 3 percent a
year.
   Water has historically been a source of conflict in the Middle
East. Ancient civilizations flowered around the region's major
rivers, the Nile, the Euhprates and the Tigris and they had to
fight to keep control of them. Without water there was nothing.
   The people of the Middle East ``have learned to live with meager
water resources, adapting their cultures and even their conflicts
to this basic commodity,'' Salameh noted.
   But he said the region was now trapped in a ``vicious circle _
the only way to cover the increasing demand for water is by
curtailing the share of irrigation water for agriculture, which in
turn is in bad need of water to supply food for an increasing
population.''
   Syria and Iraq, bitter rivals in the Arab world, face a common
threat from Turkey's plans to harness the Euphrates.
   Iraq depends on the river for much of its water for electricity
generation and irrigation, but can fall back on the Tigris.
   Syria, however, is totally reliant on the Euphrates and any
cutback could have a potentially catastrophic impact on its already
troubled economy.
   Poorly defined international laws on riparian rights leave
little room for legal action.
   Ankara's announcement last year that it would halt the Euphrates
flow fostered speculation it was using that as a political lever to
force Damascus and Baghdad to move against Kurdish rebels based in
their border territories.
   Foreign Ministry officials in Ankara deny there is any linkage.
But Turkish anger at Syria particularly has risen in recent weeks
following a raid by guerrillas of the Marxist Kurdish Workers'
Party in which 24 villagers were massacred. Also a Turkish survey
aircraft was downed inside Turkish airspace by a Syrian MiG fighter
in October.
   The Ataturk project involves construction of 13 dams and 17
hydroelectric stations generating 8,000 megawatts of electricity,
doubling the regional output, and providing irrigation for 28,600
square miles of land.
   The Turks have been providing Syria with 500 cubic yards of
water a second from the Euphrates and increased that by 50 percent
in late December to compensate for the cutoff.
   One of the problems is that the sources of the region's main
rivers, the Euphrates, Tigris and Nile, are in non-Arab countries.
For the Israelis, the rivers on which they rely originate in Arab
countries.
   Possibly the most potentially dangerous water dispute
encompasses Israel, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria over the waters of
the Jordan and Yarmouk rivers. The 1967 war and Israel's 1982
invasion of Lebanon stemmed in part from its need to acquire water
resources.
   Jordan has long accused Israel of taking an unfair share of
water from the Jordan and its tributaries.
   Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies
noted in a recent report: ``The Middle East stands at the precipice
of another major natural resource crisis.
   ``Before the 21st century, the struggle over limited and
threatened water resources could sunder already fragile ties among
regional states and lead to unprecedented upheaval within the
area.''
   The United Nations' Food and Agricultural Agency reported in
November that Middle East food production is rapidly falling behind
population growth, one of the highest in the world. This has
intensified the need for greater water resources.
   Sandra Postel, vice president of the U.S.-based Worldwatch
Institute, an independent study group, noted in a global report on
irrigation in December that the Middle East is one of several
regions expected to suffer chronic water shortages in the coming
decade, partly because of changing climatic patterns known as the
``greenhouse effect.''

   Scientists have a gift for Oman's mountain
tribesmen who pray for rain in the remote southern province of
Dhofar here on the southern edge of Arabia.
   Three fog-retention researchers from Canada and Chile have shown
the ``jebalis,'' or mountain dwellers, how to harness moisture in
the air to produce drinking water for their families and livestock
across the monsoon-clad Dhofari landscape.
   The scientists collect the mist by extraction, using wire mesh
screens as interceptors, says Mohamed Ghassani, secretary of
Dhofar's environmental planning committee.
   A small pilot project yielded 16,280 gallons of water during the
last monsoon, more than 10 times the quantity nature alone would
have provided, he says.
   ``Preliminary results are encouraging. Experiments confirm the
technology definitely works,'' Ghassani says. ``We're now planning
for this year's operation and optimistically preparing for the
coming monsoon in June.''
   The project design team, backed by the United Nations
Development Program, the World Meteorological Organization and
UNESCO, includes Dr. Richard Schemenauer of the Canadian
Atmospheric Environment Service and geographers Pilar Cereceda and
Juan Barros from Chile's Catholic University.
   Oman lies on the southeastern tip of the Arabian peninsula. The
sultanate flanks the great desert belt that stretches from the west
coast of Africa through the Sahara to Arabia, Pakistan and China.
   Southwest trade winds blow from the Indian Ocean across the
southern coast, trailing a veil of monsoon cloud over Dhofar's
mountains from June to September.
   Dhofar accounts for one-third of the sultanate's area of 115,800
square miles, about the size of New Mexico, with a population
estimated at 1.5 million, including the Bedouins of the central
desert.
   To the northwest, the Dhofar region's border with Saudi Arabia
runs through the desolate area known as the Empty Quarter.
   Dhofar's fertile alluvial soil is well watered for four months
by the monsoon cloud. But supplies of water for drinking and other
domestic needs are less accessible for the tribal communities that
live in the tree-dotted mountains 4,900 feet above the coastal
plain around the southern capital Salahah.
   Climbing high into the mountains, the scientists worked with
Omani environmentalists to erect interceptor and water retainer
mechanisms in strategic hillside locations.
   Harvesting the monsoon cloud synthetically to provide a water
supply for the jebalis and their crops and cattle had not been
considered feasible until now, a development fund spokesman said in
the capital, Muscat.
   ``Exactly how much of this plentiful atmospheric phenomenon can
be collected before it's dissipated across the Nejd desert is
currently under study,'' he said.
   The Omanis have traditionally found tree branches to be good
interceptors, he said.
   Planted in arid regions, they could be very productive. Initial
findings appear to justify large-scale tree planting across
watershed zones.
   The jebalis have traditionally used clay basins placed under
trees to collect water. They say this will continue, but they are
also showing a great deal of interest in the other methods.
   U.N. officials say fog water retention is also of increasing
interest in Chile and other parts of South America.
   Small desalination plants have been established in Dhofar, which
has a large reservoir of water under the Salalah plain.
   In the more remote areas, two systems of seawater desalination
and brackish water desalination are employed, both using the same
reverse osmosis technology.
   ``We understand fog water retention could be a relatively less
expensive, complimentary alternative and look forward to seeing the
results of further experiments,'' a water resources ministry
spokesman said.

   They are survivors of the golden age of jazz.
Art Hodes on the piano and Bud Freeman on the tenor sax were
pioneers who developed distinctive styles still being imitated by
other musicians. They are both in their '80s now, but not forgotten.
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bud Freeman and Art Hodes grew up in the Chicago
of the early 1920s, when Al Capone ruled the underworld and the
seductive sounds of a new kind of music spilled from smoky clubs on
the South Side.
   The two fresh-faced, white teens used to sneak into those
all-black joints to hear the likes of trumpeter Louis Armstrong and
pianist Earl ``Fatha'' Hines play music they'd never heard before _
bluesy beats and rich rhythms that would come to be known as jazz.
   Hodes and Freeman didn't meet until much later, but both were
hooked in those early days, and both made jazz their lives.
   Hodes built a reputation as one of the world's premier piano
interpreters of jazz blues.
   Freeman's distinctive swing style on the tenor saxophone has
been widely imitated.
   And the music's still got them, though both are in their early
80s.
   Hodes plays to packed jazz clubs in Chicago and abroad. And
Freeman stayed in the business until an eye ailment forced his
retirement a few months ago.
   Neither became a household word, but they're considered two of
the great survivors of jazz's golden age.
   ``There was a school of young white Chicago players who heard
the great New Orleans players in Chicago in the '20s and played
their own variations. Freeman was one of them, and Art Hodes was,''
says Martin Williams, a jazz scholar who compiled the Smithsonian
Institution's recorded collection of classic jazz.
   Bob Koester, owner of Chicago's Jazz Record Mart, says: ``They
come from the whole generation that pioneered jazz. No one sounded
like Bud Freeman before Bud Freeman. They had unique styles which
were so widely respected they were imitated.''
   Richard Wang, director of jazz studies at the University of
Illinois' Chicago campus, says Hodes ``is a prime representative of
a style of solo piano playing which developed here in Chicago with
the boogie-woogie pianists. He's a living museum of jazz piano.
He's a survivor of a tradition which is not in the fingers of
today's jazz pianists.''
   Hodes says he's ``about 83,'' though no one knows for sure. His
birth records were lost when his family emigrated from Russia in
the first years of the century.
   They settled on Chicago's South Side and Hodes studied music at
Hull House, where clarinetist Benny Goodman also was a student.
   His mother hoped he'd become a great classical pianist. But with
Armstrong, Hines, trumpeter King Oliver and others playing at local
clubs, Hodes had no time for the classics.
   ``I heard them on records and eventually in person,'' he
recalled in a recent interview. ``As Benny Goodman said, `You put
your dad's long pants on and hope that you can crash the clubs.'
And that's what I did.''
   ``I was just knocked out, it turned me everywhere but loose,''
Hodes says. ``I just had never heard anything like this. Jazz was
very new. It probably could be compared to what happened to the
kids when they heard the Beatles.''
   Hodes' first job, just out of high school, was playing piano in
a club run by a Capone lieutenant.
   He also played for Scarface himself.
   ``I doubt if he noticed me,'' he says. ``In those days your
social standing was somewhere above the washroom attendant, but
below the checkroom girl.''
   But Hodes persevered, borrowing the brassy sounds of his New
Orleans-bred heroes while developing a clear, resonant blues style
of his own.
   ``My big break was going to New York City in 1938,'' he says.

   There, ``for the first time in my life, jazz was being played in
nightclubs for listening, and not for background for strippers.''
   Hodes made several recordings as a featured pianist and played
``with just about everybody, including Bix Beiderbecke, Louis
Armstrong, Sidney Bechet,'' Wang says.
   In 1950, Hodes settled back in Chicago, building his reputation
as a soloist by touring the country and playing abroad. During this
period, he and Freeman met, played together and became friends.
   Freeman, born in Chicago in 1906, grew up on the West Side and
attended Austin High School, where he and four other student
musicians formed the ``Austin High Gang.''
   All five became professional musicians, though Freeman and
trumpeter Jimmy McPartland, who lives in New York, are the only
survivors.
   ``We wanted to do our own thing,'' Freeman recalls. They were
fascinated by the rhythm, ``the new sound, the improvisation'' of
what they considered ``black'' music.
   The group played ``in an awful lot of Chinese restaurants, and I
played some clubs that were pretty seedy places, but they were
places that I could play the way I wanted to play.''
   As jazz caught on, Freeman also went to New York. His big break
was his first recording, in 1927 as a featured player with
guitarist Eddie Condon. He played with Tommy Dorsey's band and with
Goodman in the '30s. Recording under his own name, he gained fame
as a soloist.
   An unabashed fan of Freeman and Hodes, Wayne Jones, 56, a
Chicago jazz drummer, has played with both.
   ``I just love 'em. There's something about them, the era they
came up in, it defies words,'' he says.
   ``A lot of younger guys, it doesn't mean anything to them. But
to me, it's like a kid ballplayer finally getting to play with Babe
Ruth.''
   Time hasn't dimmed their appeal.
   Shortly before Freeman was sidelined by illness last year, he
played to a standing-room-only crowd at the Green Mill on the
city's far North Side.
   And when Hodes and a group of local musicians played there on
Jan. 14, some people were turned away from the packed club. Hodes'
rousing solo renditions of ``Black and Blue'' and ``St. Louis
Blues'' hushed the crowd, which included many young enough to be
his grandchildren. And when the music stopped, they stomped their
feet and shouted for more.
   Freeman and Hodes can't account for their longevity.
   ``I've lived a very fast life, played around the world for 65
years. But I was never really a drinker and I always ate the best
foods,'' says Freeman, who gained a reputation as a ladies' man. He
married several times but has no children.
   ``Blowing the horn, it kept your head clear.''
   The father of five, Hodes has been ``like a teen-ager'' since
remarrying after his first wife's death in 1980, Jones says.
   ``Part of it has to be luck,'' Hodes says. ``One doctor told me
I lucked out in the game of genes. But I have changed my style of
living. With the years, I broke away from people who drank a lot,''
and quit smoking and drinking.
   ``I've always said that I'm a very lucky person. Most people
have to go to work. I get paid for playing. I love it.''

   Why do comic books remain an American obsession?
Were they the bridge between a world that relied on the printed
word and a world that learns more from visual experience? Some
experts call them the reflections of our lives, descended from the
cave drawings of an earlier life.

   Comic books are history books to Mike Benton.
   ``On the surface, comics were written mainly for children,''
says the Texas comic book collector and author. ``But on so many
levels they reflect our society and our culture.''
   Benton's recently published book, ``The Comic Book In America:
An Illustrated History'' (Taylor Publishing, Dallas, $29.95),
traces the comic book back to collections of newspaper comic strips
printed in 1933. But not their beginning.
   ``The comic strip is not American,'' Benton says. ``It goes back
to cave paintings or hieroglyphics.''
   However, the comic book as we know it was an American innovation.
   ``They represent the best of American values,'' Benton says.
``They were born out of good old American capitalism. At the same
time, they were the most democratic art form you can imagine.''
   Even the poorest of the poor could come up with a dime to buy a
comic book _ the cheapest entertainment available and chock-full of
traditional values: ``Truth, justice, liberty, fair play and right
winning over all.''
   M. Thomas Inge, a professor of the humanities at Randolph-Macon
College, has also studied comic books as a serious form of
commentary. They expose and highlight everything from social mores
to contemporary politics, he says.
   That is the reason they are both loved and hated, an amusement
and an object of suspicion, he says. In their use of character,
dialogue, scene, gesture, stage devices and compressed time, they
are close to drama. But, maybe Inge says, they are really closer to
the movies.
   At any rate their appeal is persistent. Americans buy more than
200 million a year.
   The first comic book in modern form was Funnies on Parade,
published in 1933 as a giveaway premium sponsored by Procter &amp;
Gamble. Its comic characters included Mutt &amp; Jeff and Joe Palooka.
   The first 10-cent comic book came out in 1934, and Detective
Comics published its first book in 1937.
   In 1938, DC's Action Comics introduced a caped character from
the planet Krypton. Two boys from Cleveland, Jerry Siegel and Joe
Shuster, had come up with a new concept _ the superhero. Naturally
enough, they called him Superman.
   According to Benton, there were seven significant superheroes
out of hundreds whose amazing exploits were chronicled in comics.
Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Spider Man, Captain America,
Captain Marvel and Plastic Man were all milestones in the art form,
he says.
   For example, Batman was the first superhero without super
powers. And Plastic Man was the first tongue-in-cheek superhero.
   Captain America leaped to the defense of liberty in 1940,
tackling Nazis even before the U.S. entered World War II.
   During the war, patriotic heroes flourished, including Captain
America, Sub-Mariner, the Human Torch, Major Liberty, the American
Avenger and Jap Buster Johnson.
   After the war, America became preoccupied with other topics.
Archie Andrews, the perennial teen-ager, had been born in 1941. His
misadventures at Riverdale High set the tone for millions of
adolescents.
   Romance comic books blossomed in 1949, becoming the
fastest-growing segment of the market. The next year, Weird Science
and other horrifying comics hit the newsstands.
   In the 1950s, the ``funny animals'' bred rapidly. Kids' sticky
dimes could buy a veritable menagerie of talking ducks, stuttering
pigs and scheming cats.
   Everybody has a favorite comic, making old comics highly prized
on the collectibles market.
   ``The comic books you read when you were 10 years old are the
best comic books in the world,'' says Benton, 39.
   The early comics from the 1930s and 40s are the blue chips of
comic investments, Benton says. But he sees the greatest potential
from comics of the early 1960s because those are highly sought by
baby boomers.
   In the late '60s, underground ``comix'' poked fun at the
establishment.
   ``The underground artists delineated drug-induced enlightenment,
sexual revolution and the political paranoia of the Sixties with an
explicitness never before seen in comic books,'' Benton says.
   Comics are now in a renaissance, being written more for adult
audiences than for children, he says. However, kids are still the
target of specially written educational comics.
   Benton has found them to be excellent textbooks. He believes
comics will serve to link the more literate society of the past
with the more visual society of the future.
   ``As we become post-literate, we leave behind the written word
in favor of images and pictures,'' he says.
   Benton's Austin company, Custom Comic Services, teaches young
people such things as the dangers of drug abuse and how to avoid
AIDS.
   Even such a delicate subject as child abuse can be addressed in
comics, Benton says. ``Comics teach kids how to take care of
themselves in a visual, friendly, engaging, non-threatening
method.''
   Despite the rapid growth of comics, Benton still believes the
medium is underutilized. However, he expects comics will endure and
continue their strong appeal to all ages.
   ``They're a ticket to another reality,'' he says. ``There's
almost something magical about it.''

   They were victims of Sen. Joseph McCarthy's
efforts to ferret out Communist sympathizers on the nation's
campuses and elsewhere in the 1950s. Three University of Michigan
professors were among scores of academics to feel the sting of the
House Un-American Activities Committee. Now, 35 years later,
there's a movement afoot to make amends.

   In 1952, H. Chandler Davis wrote a check
to pay for printing a pamphlet criticizing the House Un-American
Activities Committee and Sen. Joseph McCarthy for a ``witch hunt''
against Communist sympathizers.
   The University of Michigan professor believed that was part of
his constitutional right of free speech, even during the
anti-Communist frenzy of the 1950s. Instead, it made him a target
of the committee and he became a Cold War casualty.
   Brought before a HUAC subcommittee in Lansing in 1954, Davis
refused to answer questions about his political leanings, claiming
his activities were protected by the First Amendment.
   The subcommittee cited Davis for contempt and he landed in a
federal prison for six months. The University of Michigan fired him
for insubordination and blacklited him, he says.
   ``I've never been able to get normal employment in the U.S.
since then,'' says Davis, 63, who moved to Canada in 1962 and
became a professor of mathematics at the University of Toronto.
   Now, some want the University of Michigan to apologize to Davis,
a former Communist, and two other professors who were branded as
potential subversives because of their former Communist sympathies.
   Mark Nickerson, then a professor of pharmacology, and Clement
Markert, an assistant professor of zoology, refused to testify
before the subcommittee presided over by Rep. Kit Clardy, a
Michigan Republican.
   Unlike Davis, they cited their Fifth Amendment right against
incriminating themselves and avoided prison.
   Michigan President Harlan Hatcher fired Nickerson and censured
Markert.
   Now, 35 years later, the Ann Arbor Chapter of the American
Association of University Professors is asking the university to
make amends to the three through severance pay, honorary
reinstatement or honorary degrees.
   The University of Vermont, Reed College and Temple University
made similar gestures to faculty members fired during the 1950s.
   University of Michigan spokesman Joseph Owsley says the issue is
expected to come before the faculty Senate and university President
James Duderstadt will have no comment until then.
   Other universities besides Michigan fired faculty members, says
Lionel Lewis, who found 126 instances at 57 institutions in
researching his book ``Cold War on Campus.''
   ``I'm sure there are more,'' says Lewis, chairman of the
Department of Sociology at the State University of New York at
Buffalo.
   The passage of time hasn't dampened the anger of the three
Michigan professors.
   ``They didn't want testimony. They wanted us to prostrate
ourselves, to humiliate us in public,'' says Markert, who
sympathized with the Communist Party during the Depression and
fought in a Communist-organized brigade in the Spanish Civil War in
1938.
   ``The only reason they wanted to talk to you was to get other
people's names,'' says Nickerson, a former Communist who said he
never considered cooperating with HUAC.
   ``There are some things you can do and some things you can't.
You don't put somebody else in jeopardy to save your own job.''
   Markert's department fought hard to save his job. A university
faculty committee voted unanimously that he and Nickerson should
stay, but Hatcher fired Nickerson anyway.
   ``There was quite a lot of support that wasn't expressed. Other
professors would call me or come in and see me in the evening, but
walk right past me on campus,'' Nickerson says. ``The purpose of
that era was to scare people, and it certainly did.''
   Nickerson moved to Canada and took a job at a 50 percent pay
cut. Later, he became chairman of the medical school at McGill
University in Montreal and president of the American
Pharmacological and Experimental Therapeutics Society.
   ``I did everything I could have done. It was just harder,'' says
Nickerson, now 73 and retired.
   Markert, 72, says he felt few professional repercussions from
the committee's effort to smear him. He was granted tenure at
Michigan and is now a professor at North Carolina State University
in Raleigh.
   Hatcher, who lives in Ann Arbor, declined to be interviewed, but
in a videotaped interview about the era, he said his goal was
survival of the university.
   ``McCarthyism was a very destructive force, and the issue was
how to preserve the universities in the face of that threat,'' he
said on the tape, ``Keeping in Mind.''
   The videotape was an honors thesis project by former Michigan
student Adam Kulakow.
   Lewis says some universities chose to protect their faculty
members and defend their freedom to hold unpopular beliefs.
   That was the case at Michigan State University, says Walter
Adams, professor of economics and former national president of the
American Association of University Presidents.
   Then-President John Hannah asked faculty members with Communist
ties to inform him or their deans privately, Adams recalls.
   ``Nothing ever happened to any of these people. Hannah really
handled that magnificently. He protected these people,'' he says.

   Sexy and outspoken, Taylor Dayne is a hybrid as
is her music. At once warm and passionate, it is driven by a beat,
just as she is driven. It has helped her avoid the pitfalls of
alcohol and drugs, so often associated with musical success. She
knew what she wanted and got it.

   No shrinking violet, this lady.
   Her debut record album produced four top 10 singles. Now she's
on her second hit single from her second record album.
   ``I don't believe in overnight stardom,'' Taylor Dayne says
bluntly. ``That's garbage.''
   She and her version of rock 'n' roll obviously is not. Nor her
sense of what she looks like.
   Her hair, red and bushy when the first album came out, is now
blonde and less full. For photographers she pouts full lips for a
sultry look.
   From the time she was a child she says she knew she was going to
sing. ``I was an obnoxious kid wanting to sing solos in school and
doing it.''
   She chooses decolletage for public appearances, like when she
presented the dance and rap awards at January's televised American
Music Awards.
   ``I like to be photographed,'' she says. ``I have fun with it. I
like to feel good about myself.
   ``Being sexy is something that didn't happen overnight. I'm
thankful I take good photographs every now and then.''
   But she never considered modeling. ``I didn't think I was pretty
enough or tall enough ... a fool job. Singing pays better. And it's
more satisfying.''
   Her next tour, for which she's having a ``great outfit'' made,
starts in March.
   Remembering advice from her voice teachers, Dayne always warms
up her voice before she goes on stage. ``On the road I get really
freaked. Ask anybody on the tour bus with me. I have a scarf
wrapped around my neck. I have my tea and lemon and honey.
   ``I choose not to be involved in drugs. I don't preach to
anybody. I have this path within me. I've fallen off a couple of
times. I picked myself up and got back on. Always what I saw for
myself is where I am now. I know what works for me. It's to keep
myself safe, happy and healthy. ''
   If she drinks too much and feels lousy the next day, ``I know
exactly what I did to make myself feel like that. So I avoid it. I
don't avoid it altogether. Let's just say I don't abuse it.''
   In her three college years she studied philosophy and
psychology. She took voice lessons on the side. She rehearsed with
a band three nights a week and performed weekends. ``People call it
paying your dues.''
   Sometimes the lead singer, sometimes switching off with others,
sometimes the kid with the tambourine. But she was getting
restless, wanted out of the Long Island scene and she wanted to
front a band.
   She joined one in White Plains, N.Y. ``I was schlepping up there
three times a week, rehearsing. It was five people and with
everybody having their own ideas and enormous egos. The songwriter
was very gifted but he had a major attitude problem. I knew it
wouldn't take him far, and I don't mind saying that because I hate
him.''
   In Manhattan, he told her to copy other singers. ``It was a
bitter time in my life. All I could do was pray I would meet
somebody who would respect me for my vocal sound and for myself.
Three weeks later I met Ric.''
   Ric Wake, a producer of dance records, heard her first on tape.
He was struggling himself, making 12-inch singles, hoping they'd
get picked up by a major label.
   ``I started singing and writing dance stuff with him. I could
feel the pulse of the music.''
   Then she began to think that melodic songs would intrigue more
people _ both dance and pop fans.
   So, almost an unknown, she got from a music publisher a song
that was danceable and she thought had crossover appeal, ``Tell it
to My Heart.'' She cut a single and tried to shop it around.
   But, impatient to pay her father back money she had borrowed,
she was willing for a small-time, independent release of the record
if a major record company didn't pick it up.
   Arista Records signed her three days after she got out of a
previous independent production deal.
   Born Lesley Wunderman, she changed her name, so single records
she'd made wouldn't be re-issued to haunt her. ``I thought Taylor
was different. I like guys' names.'' Dayne came out of a baby-name
book.
   Arista released ``Tell it to My Heart'' and it flew up the
charts, in America and abroad. ``I was making an album four months
later,'' Dayne says.
   She'd never sung a ballad when Clive Davis, Arista's president,
said that ``I'll Always Love You,'' a passionate ballad, should be
on the album.
   She didn't want to sing it. ``Clive obviously had a lot more
confidence in my voice than I did ... Now I'm comfortable with
ballads. I knock them out constantly. It's cool.''
   Dayne grew up in Long Island, middle child of an engineer who
also deals in rare coins and a mother who had operatic training.
One brother does record company promotion and the other produces
corporate parties and ``weddings on a grand scale.''
   A ballad, ``Love Will Lead You Back,'' is her current single,
following ``With Every Beat of My Heart.'' Wake produced the ``Tell
It to My Heart'' album and the new one, called appropriately
``Can't Fight Fate.''

   The nation's unemployment rate held steady at
5.3 percent for the eighth straight month in January but the
economy still produced 275,000 new jobs, the government said.
   The Labor Department also said Friday factory jobs dropped
112,000 last month, with 90,000 of the losses suffered by the
struggling auto industry. But many laid off auto workers have been
recalled since last month. Large gains were posted in construction
and service industries.
   The jobless rate in Michigan jumped to 8.4 percent in January,
up from 7.2 percent in December. That was the largest unemployment
increase in the 11 large industrial states surveyed by the
government.

November.
   Analysts said the manufacturing sector apparently hit a trough

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said it narrowed its
losses sharply last year and expected to return to profitability in
1990 after spending two years at the center of the nation's biggest
securities fraud case.
   The securities firm said it lost about $40 million after taxes
in 1989 on $4.1 billion in revenue. That compared with a loss of
$167 million on revenue of $4.4 billion in 1988, a year in which it
took a charge of $650 million to cover a settlement of the fraud
charges.
   As recently as December, Drexel Chief Executive Frederick H.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said it narrowed its
losses sharply last year and expected to return to profitability in
1990 after spending two years at the center of the nation's biggest
securities fraud case.
   The securities firm said it lost about $40 million after taxes
in 1989 on $4.1 billion in revenues. That compared with a loss of
$167 million on revenues of $4.4 billion in 1988, a year in which
it took a charge of $650 million to cover a settlement of the fraud
charges.
   As recently as December, Drexel Chief Executive Frederick H.
Joseph predicted the firm would break even or show a modest profit
for the full year.
   Although the results announced Sunday fell short of that
forecast, Drexel said cutbacks in the past year had effectively
halved the firm's break-even point and leave it poised to turn a
profit this year.
   Last year's loss included $75 million in expenses related to
investigations of the firm for securities abuses. Those expenses
should drop nearly in half this year, Drexel said.
   In September, Drexel pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed
to pay a record of more than $650 million in fines and restitution
to settle criminal fraud charges that stemmed from the Ivan Boesky
insider trading scandal.
   The firm also reached an agreement on civil charges with the
Securities and Exchange Commission last year that placed Drexel
under unprecedented government supervision for three years and
revamps its management.
   The loss last year also included an undisclosed amount of
charges related to discontinued operations.
   The firm unloaded its retail brokerage network last year and has
reduced employment to about 5,300 today from 9,700 at the start of
1989, Drexel spokesman Steven S. Anreder said. He suggested that
the charges for discontinued operations was fairly small but
declined to give details.
   Drexel is a closely held firm and does not release detailed
earnings figures.
   Before tax and interest payments and the special charges, Drexel
said it had an operating profit of $67 million in 1989.
   That profit came after provisions to mark down the value of the
firm's holdings of high-yield bonds to reflect the steep fall in
the market for so-called junk bonds in recent months, Drexel said.
The profit figure also included over $200 million in other charges
that aren't expected to recur, the firm said.
   Anreder declined to say what the $200 million-plus charge
covered or give details about the size of the junk bond writedown.
   ``We never indicate the size of our position for competitive
reasons,'' he said of the junk bond portfolio. Drexel virtually
created the junk bond market and rode it to prominence in the
1980s, posting a record pretax profit of $1.1 billion at its peak
in 1986.
   Drexel said it would benefit from a sharp reduction in costs
this year. In addition to reduced personnel and legal costs, the
firm announced plans in October to cut its New York City office
space to about 700,000 square feet by 1991 from 1.5 million square
feet.
   Anreder said Drexel didn't anticipate any further job cuts
despite a wave of reductions on Wall Street. In the most dramatic
move, industry leader Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in January announced a
$470 million charge to cover the elimination of some businesses,
the dismissal of some 3,000 employees and a consolidation of office
space.
   ``I think we recognized the cycles a lot sooner than other
people in the industry,'' Anreder said.
   Drexel's equity capital stood at more than $800 million at the
end of 1989, down from $1.1 billion a year earlier but up from
about $750 million late in the year.
   Part of the reduction in capital reflected the firm's withdrawal
from retail brokerage, Anreder said. Drexel boosted capital late in
the year with contributions from high-salary employees, and
employees should provide another $50 million to $100 million in
fresh equity capital this year, he said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fluctuated in a narrow range in calm
European trading late this morning as markets awaited news from a
key meeting of the Soviet Communist Party.
   Gold prices rose.
   Traders said they expected little movement in the dollar until
there were political developments in the Soviet Union and U.S.
markets opened.
   The Communist Party's Central Committee is meeting today and
Tuesday to debate a proposal, endorsed by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, to give up its exclusive claim to power.
   News of further Soviet democratization could fuel some dollar
buying, dealers said.
   But the U.S. currency generally remains on a downward trend,
traders said.
   ``The dollar is currently a sick currency,'' one Milan trader
said. The huge U.S. budget and trade deficits, lackluster economic
growth, persistent inflation and the prospect of lower interest
rates are all weighing on the dollar, he said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.64 yen to a closing 145.60 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 145.70 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.6786 West German marks, down from 1.6860;
1.4868 Swiss francs, down from 1.4964; 5.7015 French francs, down
from 5.7360; 1.8930 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9010; 1,246.50
Italian lire, down from 1,252.00; and 1.1875 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1884.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6915 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6820 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $418.50 a troy ounce, up
from $417.25 bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $418.75.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $418.40, up from $417.75 bid late
Friday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $1.10 to close at a bid $416.86.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.31 a troy ounce, up
from Friday's $5.29.

   The dollar continued its climb against the Japanese
yen and Tokyo prices fell marginally today as investors reacted to
better-than-expected U.S. employment figures and uncertainties
about Soviet developments.
   The dollar closed at 145.60 yen, up 0.65 yen from last Friday's
close of 144.95 yen. After opening at 145.59 yen, it stayed in a
narrow range of 145.40-145.60 yen.
   The dollar now has gained 2.38 yen in the last five trading days.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's firmness today carried over
from its strong showing Friday in New York, where it closed at
145.50 yen.
   Investors bought dollars in New York after the U.S. Labor
Department reported that the nation's unemployment rate held steady
at 5.3 percent in January.
   Economists say a steady jobless rate will keep the U.S. Federal
Reserve from easing interest rates. Higher interest rates tend to
make a country's currency more attractive to investors.
   Dealers added, however, that uncertainty over the situation in
the Soviet Union was keeping participants from taking large
positions.
   ``Now the market is looking to whether Soviet leader Gorbachev's
position will be consolidated'' in a meeting of the Soviet
Communist Party Central Committee today and Tuesday, said a Bank of
Tokyo dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Tokyo market has fluctuated erratically in past weeks on
rumors that Gorbachev might resign as party secretary.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which gained 443.73 points last Friday, fell back 18.74
points, or 0.05 percent, today, closing at 37,631.41 yen.
   Securities dealers said that after a strong opening, uncertainty
about the direction of currency rates and falling government bond
prices sent investors to the sidelines, causing large-capital
issues to decline.
   ``Investors were watching the development of the Soviet
situation from the sidelines so anxiously that they remained
reluctant to take part all day,'' said a dealer with Nikko
Securities Co., also speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Volume traded on the exchange's first section was estimated at
400 million shares.

<HEAD>Honda Motor Considering Selling Chrysler Cars in Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honda Motor Co. is considering a request by
Chrysler Corp. to market the American manufacturer's automobiles in
Japan, a Honda spokesman said Monday.
   Honda spokesman Hitoshi Dewa said Chrysler suggested the two
companies set up a joint venture. All other details, including the
Chrysler models, number of sales and distribution channels in Japan
have yet to be finalized, Dewa said.
   Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's largest business journal, said
Honda will concentrate on selling 5,000-6,000 Chrysler Jeeps and
Cherokees a year through one of Honda's three distribution networks
in Japan. The newspaper said an agreement was expected later this
year.
   Honda's move is reportedly aimed at supplementing sales of the
troubled U.S. manufacturer, whose profits have been suffering from
a slump in the U.S. auto market, the newspaper said.
   Last November and December, Honda outsold Chrysler in the United
States, the first time the American automaker was beaten by a
foreign manufacturer, Dewa said.
   Chrysler's sales in Japan have remained negligible.
   Chrysler Japan Sales Co., the joint venture set up 1988 by
Chrysler and J. Osawa, sold 440 Chrysler cars that year and 970
cars last year, accounting for 0.5 percent of foreign auto sales in
Japan, according to company sales figures.
   Until recently, the U.S. company has had a close relationship
with one of Honda's rivals, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. The two
companies have a joint production facility in Illinois.
   Last September, however, Chrysler announced it would sell 45
percent of its share in the Japanese automaker for $592 million,
reducing its share in Mitsubishi from 21.8 percent to 12.1 percent.

   Congressional Democrats are gearing up to
rework the defense, domestic and tax priorities in President Bush's
1991 budget, but they acknowledge they dare not even tinker with
the widest gulf between the two sides.
   It's no secret that the majority Democrats in the House and
Senate want to cut defense spending beyond Bush's proposal, beef up
favorite domestic programs and change the president's mix of taxes.
   But the differences on those issues amount to just a fraction of
the gap that separates the White House and Democrats on a larger
question: how much deficit reduction will be needed next year.
   Democrats say the real figure is double the $37 billion Bush
claims is necessary. Yet they concede they will use the president's
number for a simple reason: if Congress decides that $74 billion in
savings are needed, Congress must find them.
   ``Without the executive branch, Congress simply can't assemble
the political support to make the hard, unpopular decisions that
would have to be made,'' Senate Budget Committee Chairman James
Sasser, D-Tenn., said last week.
   ``The side that goes for the higher numbers has to come up with
more spending cuts or taxes,'' says Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a
member of the House Budget Committee. ``It's one of the most awful
political dynamics I've seen.''
   The White House, relying on expectations of a healthy economy
next year, based its $1.23 trillion budget on the assumption that
healthy economic growth would shrink the 1991 shortfall to about
$101 billion. Hence, just $37 billion in taxes or savings would be
needed to reach the $64 billion Gramm-Rudman deficit target.
   Many analysts believe the economy will be less robust. That
means lower revenue collections and, they say, a $138 billion
budget gap _ or $74 billion in savings needed to hit the $64
billion target.
   The reality gulf between the two sides gets wider still. The
Democratic staff of the Senate Budget Committee last week claimed
the president's budget hid at least $100 billion in legitimate
budget costs by relying on ``big lies and budget gimmicks.''
   These ranged from carrying the federal costs of insolvent
savings and loans associations off the budget _ a $50 billion to
$100 billion expense over the next two years _ to assuming $2.5
billion in savings by running the Internal Revenue Service more
efficiently.
   Administration officials say they have done nothing misleading.
Democrats disagree, but will not discount those savings for fear of
the consequences: having to replace them with cuts or taxes
elsewhere.
   ``Going with those higher numbers now would be political
suicide'' for the Democrats, says Stanley Collender, who follows
the budget process for Touche, Ross and Co., the accounting firm.
   What Democrats will focus on is Bush's defense proposal. He
wants to spend $303.3 billion for military programs next year,
above this year's $296.3 billion but 2.6 percent below what is
needed to stay abreast of inflation. Democrats say that with the
easing of Cold War tensions, those cuts will have to go lower,
perhaps $12 billion to $15 billion less than Bush's figure.
   ``We've got to cut more there,'' says Sen. J. James Exon,
D-Neb., a member of the Senate budget and armed services
committees. ``But the problem is you get where everybody says,
`Don't close my base, close his base.' Therein lies the problem,
that local pork barrel takes the place of rational decisions.''
   Democrats will be eager to use any defense savings to protect
domestic programs against cuts proposed by Bush.
   Democratic aides to the House Budget Committee said Friday that
they had found 46 programs that Bush wants to eliminate, including
several student loan programs and subsidies to Amtrak, the
passenger railroad. Forty-three others were targeted for major
cuts, including Medicare, farm assistance and federal prison
construction.
   Majority lawmakers also are likely to try to change Bush's plans
to raise nearly $22 billion next year in new taxes, fees and other
government collections.
   Their main target is the president's proposal to cut the capital
gains tax rate, which he insists brings the Treasury $4.9 billion.
   ``I don't see any quick resolutions here,'' House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said Friday. ``The
budget could very well be the focus of confrontation for the next
few months.''

   The Bush administration's hopes of getting the
federal deficit under control could be on a collision course with
the Federal Reserve's efforts to get control of inflation, many
economists believe.
   The Fed has been resisting a variety of signals from the
administration that it would like to see a more aggressive easing
of interest rates from the central bank in order to keep the
economy from dipping into a recession.
   Private economists said recent comments from Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan leave the unmistakable impression that the
Fed's inflation-fighting efforts are not about to slacken as a
result of the administration's comments.
   As a result, many private economists predict that a variety of
short-term business and consumer interest rates are likely to
remain unchanged over coming weeks, including banks' prime lending
rate, which stands at 10 percent.
   They said mortgage rates, which have been rising, should
stabilize although they conceded this forecast depends heavily on
the financial markets.
   The Fed's main policymaking group, composed of Fed governors and
regional Fed bank presidents, was scheduled to hold closed-door
discussions on Tuesday and Wednesday to set monetary goals for the
rest of the year.
   While the outcome of those deliberations will not be known until
Feb. 20 when Greenspan testifies to Congress, many economists
predict that the central bank will not loosen further and will
instead adopt a wait-and-see attitude.
   ``I think the Fed is going to sit on its hands. The employment
and inflation numbers are coming in too high to permit further
easing,'' said David Wyss, chief financial forecaster for
DRI-McGraw Hill.
   That could spell bad news for the administration, which last
week sent Congress a budget projecting that the federal deficit
will be slashed in half to $63.1 billion next year.
   That projection was based on an optimistic economic forecast
which called for growth to be higher and interest rates to be lower
than many private analysts believe is possible given the Fed's
current course.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady on Friday conceded that the
administration and Fed policymakers don't always see eye to eye. He
said these ``differences of point of view are openly expressed''
during his weekly meetings with Greenspan.
   Since June the central bank has engaged in a series of small
credit easing efforts as the Fed tried to keep the economy from
slipping into a recession. But last week, Greenspan told a
congressional committee he believed the chance of an imminent
recession had diminished markedly since last spring and the current
slowdown is likely to turn out to be only a ``temporary
hesitation.''
   Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co., said
Greenspan's comment showed that the Fed was willing to risk lower
growth because of renewed concerns about the need to lower the
inflation rate, which last year jumped to a seven-year high of 4.6
percent.
   ``The central bank is toughing it out, letting economic growth
dip quite low in an effort to get inflation down,'' Sinai said.
   Lyle Gramley, a former Fed governor and now chief economist for
the Mortgage Bankers Association, said the central bank also is
being forced to keep an eye on the turbulence in financial markets,
especially the bond market, where interest rates have been rising
out of fears that foreign investors may be abandoning the American
market in favor of higher returns overseas.
   ``Even if the Fed wanted to ease, they could hardly do so with
sentiment in the bond market so sour. Any easing could well be
counterproductive, sending interest rates up and not down,''
Gramley said.
   Mortgage rates have been headed higher in recent weeks, now at
10.17 percent, the highest level since early September, according
to a nationwide survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
Rates dipped to 9.69 percent in late December.

   Stock prices were narrowly mixed in early
trading this morning after finishing last week on the upbeat.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 16 points
on Friday, was unchanged at 2,602.70 after 30 minutes of trading
this morning.
   Declining issues took a narrow lead over gainers among issues
listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 459 up, 482 down and
468 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 17.6 million shares at 10 a.m.
on Wall Street.
   The stock market has labored this year under the weight of
lackluster corporate earnings reports and rising interest rates.
   Interest rates have been rising in recent days in anticipation
of this week's government auction of $30 billion in new securities.
   The auction begins Tuesday with the sale of $10 billion of new
three-year notes followed by similar $10 billion auctions of
10-year notes on Wednesday and 30-year bonds on Thursday.
   This borrowing binge comes in addition to today's regular weekly
sale of $15.3 billion in three-month and six-month Treasury bills.
   Some credit market analysts say rates must rise to keep the
attention of foreign investors, especially the Japanese.
   Higher rates make yields on short-term securities more
competitive with those on stocks and could hurt the corporate
earnings outlook.
   Among the early active issues on the NYSE, Exxon was up &lsqb; at 48,
American General was down &lsqb; at 28{ and Bank of New England was up \
at 5{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
off 0.06 at 182.69. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 0.75 at 354.31.
   On Friday, the Dow Jones industrials rose 16.44 points to
2,602.70.
   Advancing issues outpaced decliners by nearly 2 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 1,004 issues up, 495 down and 473 unchanged.
   Volume came to 164.40 million shares, up from 154.58 million in

   The Chevrolet Corvette has the highest
death rate in crashes, while a four-door Volvo has the lowest,
according to a study released today.
   The study shows that 5.2 drivers and passengers die in car
wrecks for every 10,000 1985-87 Corvettes registered in the United
States. It also found the Volvo 740-760 four-door had the lowest
rate, 0.6 deaths per 10,000 vehicles.
   The figures from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety were
released by the Michigan Association of Professional Insurance
Agents.
   ``Without question the consumer has a better chance of survival
when driving a larger vehicle,'' said James Alexander, president of
the Michigan association.
   Of the 10 vehicles with the lowest death rates, three were
large, six were midsize and only one was a small car _ the
Volkswagen Jetta with 1.1 deaths per 10,000 vehicles.
   Twelve of the 15 cars with the highest death rates are small,
and the other three are midsize. Several, including the Corvette at
the top of the list, are high-performance cars.
   Gary Mitchell, a spokesman for the association, said while the
auto industry was making more small, fuel-efficient cars, they
weren't as safe as the larger models.
   ``What we've seen in recent years is that the industry has
placed such a great emphasis on fuel economy that safety has been
compromised,'' he said. ``They're lighter so they're more fuel
efficient and that's commendable, but I don't think fuel efficiency
should take a front seat over safety.''
   High-performance cars tend to have higher death rates because of
the type of drivers they attract, Mitchell said.
   ``The study shows there's a direct correlation between high
performance sports models and a higher accident death rate,'' he
said. ``The Corvette, Camaro, Mustang, Firebird, and Dodge Daytona
were all in the top 10 in terms of highest overall death rate.
   ``The average driver in those cars is a man under 30 years
old,'' he said. ``Industry figures show there cars with a higher
percentage of female drivers tend to have lower death rates.
There's a direct correlation.''
   Debra Barclay, a spokeswoman for the Washington, D.C.-based
Center for Auto Safety, agreed the the study's finding that smaller
cars were less safe, but said that doesn't have to be the case.
   ``We have continued to say that you can make fuel efficient cars
that are safe. The technology is available. It's not being used to
the extent that it can be,'' she said.
   ``With airbags, consumers have to pay a few extra hundred
dollars, but they get an opportunity to save their life. People are
thrilled to have that choice,'' she said.
   Barclay added that at least 14 insurance companies were offering
discounts to customers who buy cars equipped with airbags.
   Mitchell and Barclay also said Congress should toughen safety
standards for smaller cars.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration declined to
comment on the study.

<HEAD>Rig Count Drops Six to 931, Still Above Same Period Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working U.S. oil and gas rigs
continued to decline this week, dropping by six to 931, Baker
Hughes Inc. reported.
   But the number of working rigs still was higher than the 780
total posted for the same week last year, Baker Hughes said Monday.
   In the two previous weeks, the count plunged by 55 and then 27
to 937. Experts blamed the decline on bad weather in some states
and a general seasonal decline.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rotary rigs actively
exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the number of
producing wells.
   Ike Kerridge, a Baker Hughes vice president and economist, said
the rig count generally declines during the first quarter. The
count probably will bottom out in March or April, he said.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Pennsylvania had the greatest
weekly plunge, having lost six rigs, while New Mexico lost five,
Kansas lost three, North Dakota lost two, and Oklahoma and Wyoming
each lost one.
   Texas had the largest gain with seven, while Louisiana added
four, Colorado increased by three and California gained two.
   The number of working rigs in both Michigan and Ohio were
unchanged for the week.

<TEXT>
   Congress is expected this week to start
working out differences in oil spill liability legislation so it
can send a bill to President Bush by the March 24 anniversary of
the Exxon Valdez accident.
   The biggest remaining problem is a dispute over whether tankers
should be required to have double hulls and double bottoms.
   The legislation _ 15 years in the making _ would set
comprehensive requirements for financing and managing oil spill
cleanups. The issue was thrust to the forefront last year by the
Exxon Valdez disaster.
   The tanker, which did not have a double hull or double bottom,
dumped 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound,
Alaska, when it ran aground.
   Staff members say the House wants the legislation ready for the
president's signature by the Valdez accident anniversary. The
Senate already has chosen its members for the conference committee,
while the House is expected to announce conference committee
members on Wednesday or Thursday.
   The House bill would put oil into the hazardous material
category by requiring that tankers calling on U.S. ports with
petroleum products, like those carrying other dangerous substances,
have double bottoms within seven years and double hulls within 15
years of the bill's enactment. All new tankers constructed in the
United States would have to be built with double hulls. Such
requirements already exist for tankers carrying other hazardous
materials.
   The Senate version calls for a study to determine if any other
technology would give better protection against spills.
   ``People have argued this thing over the years and nobody can
really say precisely what would happen if a double hull or double
bottom vessel was grounded,'' said Joe Lastelic, spokesman for the
American Petroleum Institute, which opposes that provision.
   A double-bottomed ship could be more difficult to salvage
because water could accumulate between the two bottoms and cause
the ship to sink or capsize faster, he said. There also is concern
that vapors would accumulate between the two layers in an accident
and cause an explosion, he added.
   International shippers lobbied against such a requirement since
it would mean foreign tankers would have to be refitted to do
business in American ports.
   The White House also opposes the provision.
   Rep. Dean Gallo, R-N.J., plans to offer a motion to instruct
House conferees to support the hull-bottom requirement when they
meet with the Senate. The motion would be non-binding, but it would
lead to a House roll call vote and give congressional negotiators a
sense of how strongly the House feels about the provision.
   Environmental groups like the National Wildlife Federation and
the Sierra Club are lobbying in favor of double hulls and double
bottoms.
   In past congressional sessions, the House-Senate dispute has
centered on whether states should be allowed to enact stricter
liability laws than the federal government. The Senate favored such
a provision while the House was opposed.
   Many House members put up a fight over the issue again last
year, but eventually the states' rights faction won.
   Twenty-eight states have their own oil spill liability statutes,
and 19 require unlimited liability for the oil companies or
carriers to clean up damage to the environment.
   The oil industry wants a federal law that would pre-empt the
state laws and set limits on the amount a company would have to pay
for cleanup, saying insurance costs could put reputable shippers
out of business.

<HEAD>Sears Reports Gains In Quarterly, Annual Net</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. today reported more than a
five-fold increase in fourth-quarter profit after the previous
year's expensive restructuring charge and said its annual earnings
rose 4 percent.
   Despite the gains, Sears said results for both the fourth
quarter and the full year were adversely affected by insurance
claims stemming from the San Francisco area earthquake, Hurricane
Hugo and severe cold weather in the South.
   Sears reported net income of $602.1 million, or $1.76 per common
share, for the three months ended Dec. 31 compared with $117.4
million, or 32 cents a share, for the corresponding 1988 quarter.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 4.2 percent to $15.18 billion from
$14.56 billion, Sears said in a statement.
   Results for the fourth quarter of 1988 included an after-tax
charge of $442 million, or $1.17 per share, for restructuring the
company's retailing business and a loss of $78.9 million, or 16
cents per share from the sale of the life and health insurance
operations of the Allstate Insurance Co., a Sears subsidiary.
   Sears said claims of more than $250 million resulting from the
September storm known as Hurricane Hugo contributed to the steepest
losses in Allstate's history.
   For all of 1989, Sears reported net income of $1.51 billion, or
$4.30 per share, up from $1.45 billion, or $3.84 per share, in 1988.
   Annual revenue rose 7.1 percent to a record $53.8 billion from
$50.3 billion in 1988, Sears said.
   In a statement accompanying the results, Sears Chairman Edward
A. Brennan said 1989 was ``a year of transition.''
   ``The company is well-positioned as it enters the 1990s,''
Brennan said, ``and we expect momentum to build as the year
progresses.''

<TEXT>
   Honda Motor Co. is considering a request by
Chrysler Corp. to market the American manufacturer's automobiles in
Japan, a Honda spokesman said Monday.
   Honda spokesman Hitoshi Dewa said Chrysler suggested the two
companies set up a joint venture. All other details, including the
Chrysler models, number of sales and distribution channels in Japan
have yet to be finalized, Dewa said.
   Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's largest business journal, said
Honda will concentrate on selling 5,000-6,000 Chrysler Jeeps and
Cherokees a year through one of Honda's three distribution networks
in Japan. The newspaper said an agreement was expected later this
year.
   Chrysler spokesman Steve Harris confirmed from the company's
Highland Park, Mich., headquarters that the No. 3 U.S. automaker
had talked with Honda about the Japanese market. He declined to
elaborate.
   Honda's move is reportedly aimed at supplementing sales of the
troubled U.S. manufacturer, whose profits have been suffering from
a slump in the U.S. auto market, the newspaper said.
   Last November and December, Honda outsold Chrysler in the United
States, the first time the American automaker was beaten by a
foreign manufacturer, Dewa said.
   Chrysler's sales in Japan have remained negligible.
   Chrysler Japan Sales Co., the joint venture set up 1988 by
Chrysler and J. Osawa, sold 440 Chrysler cars that year and 970
cars last year, accounting for 0.5 percent of foreign auto sales in
Japan, according to company sales figures.
   Until recently, the U.S. company has had a close relationship
with one of Honda's rivals, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. The two
companies have a joint production facility in Illinois.
   Last September, however, Chrysler announced it would sell 45
percent of its share in the Japanese automaker for $592 million,
reducing its share in Mitsubishi from 21.8 percent to 12.1 percent.

<HEAD>Wheat Gains On China Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices rose modestly this morning
on the Chicago Board of Trade following news of government approval
for a subsidized sale of U.S. wheat to China.
   Soybean futures were slightly higher in early trading while corn
futures were mixed.
   The Agriculture Department said it had accepted China's bid for
300,000 metric tons of wheat at subsidized prices. The bid was
revealed Friday.
   Under a government program designed to increase export sales,
the grain exporters from whom China buys the wheat will receive
grain or grain credits from the government.
   The wheat market also was supported this morning by indications
Egypt is seeking to buy 250,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat.
   But the gains were limited by last week's National Weather
Service forecast for wetter-than-normal conditions later this week
over a widespread area of the nation's midsection.
   Slight early gains in the soybean market reflected slack farmer
sales, analysts said.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent to 2 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.81 a bushel; corn
futures were { cent lower to { cent higher with March at $2.37 a
bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 cent lower with March at $1.35\ a
bushel; soybeans were { cent to 1\ cents higher with March at
$5.61\ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures rallied in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .53 cent higher with February at
79.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .60 cent higher
with March at 83.30 cents a pound; live hogs were .08 cent to .50
cent higher with February at 48.92 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .33 cent to .70 cent higher with February at 49.50
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled higher on Friday while most pork futures
retreated.

   Kelly Services Inc., the largest U.S.

and New Zealand, Kelly said Monday.
   The acquisitions bring to eight the number of overseas temporary
services companies Kelly has acquired since January 1988.

   There will be no changes in staffs or duties stemming from
either acquisition, Kelly said in a news release.
   Kelly Services employs more than 560,000 temporary workers

including the Netherlands and New Zealand. It reported revenue of
$1.27 billion and earnings of $60.3 million in 1988, the latest
annual figure available.

   RCA Corp. pleaded guilty in federal court
today to two felony charges and was fined $2.5 million as part of
the continuing probe of contractors who acquired and passed along
secret Defense Department plans for weapons systems.
   One former and one current RCA employee also entered guilty
pleas to charges of illegally conveying government property.
   The government told U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris that
in the years 1978-1985, RCA acquired copies of a wide range of
Department of Defense documents dealing with program objectives,
internal decisions and budget estimates.
   ``Both counts of the information to which RCA plead guilty
concrned RCA's unauthorized acquisition of secret editions of the
Department of Defense's five-year defense program,'' said the U.S.
attorney's office.
   One count charged that RCA, through former employee Leonard
Kampf, gave others within the company a copy of the five-year
program for 1985. The other count made a similar charge for 1986,
involving Ronald Stevens.
   Stevens, 49, manager of marketing services at RCA's Aerospace
and Defense Division at Cherry Hill, N.J. and Kampf, 69, former
manager of marketing information and communications in Cherry Hill,
face possible sentences of up to 10 years in prison and fines of
$10,000. As part of their plea agreement, the two agreed to
cooperate with the investigation.
   Stevens has been suspended from his duties, said George Jamison,
a spokesman for General Electric Co., which purchased RCA in 1986.
   RCA agreed to enter the guilty plea when it learned the two
planned to plead guilty to charges of conveying government
documents without proper authority, according to a statement from
GE.
   ``This unfortunate chapter in RCA history is now closed,'' GE
said in a statement.
   The settlement is the second in three months. The Boeing Co.
recently paid $5.2 million to settle civil and criminal charges
involving similar violations.

<HEAD>Mexico &amp; Commercial Banks Sign Debt Reduction Agreement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico and its commercial bank creditors
signed a debt reduction agreement that was praised as an example
for other indebted nations and the result of the government's
economic reforms.
   ``Mexico stands as a beacon of hope for other debtor nations,''
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said at Sunday's signing
ceremony.
   Brady laid the groundwork for the agreement a year ago by
offering debt forgiveness in exchange for economic reforms in
developing countries. Previously, banks had managed the debt crisis
mainly by lending countries money to cover their interest payments,
a process that merely increased the total debt burden.
   ``It is very important to have the first transaction completed
but we do see it as only the beginning,'' Brady said.
   Mexico's agreement will cut the country's $48.5 billion bank
debt by a little more than $7 billion and reduce annual interest
payments by about $1.6 billion. Mexico estimates the full impact of
the agreement will save it more than $4 billion a year.
   ``The renegotiation of the debt is sufficient for Mexico'' and
will lead to growth and better living conditions for Mexicans,
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said.
   Salinas said faster growth is ``a social imperative to respond
to the demands of the more than 85 million Mexicans of today and
the 10 million more'' who are expected to swell the nation's
population during the remainder of his six-year term.
   Opposition leaders criticized the agreement, predicting it would
bring even greater austerity and hardship to the majority of
Mexicans.
   ``It's not a solution, in the end,'' Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, leader
of the leftist Revolutionary Democratic Party said, adding that it
will lead to a prolonged period of austerity for Mexico's lower
income wage earners.
   Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe said the country's total debt,
including loans from governments, will total $93.6 billion after
the accord. That is the second highest in the developing world
after Brazil's $114 billion.
   Officials of the 15 banks that negotiated the agreement on
behalf of Mexico's 450 creditor banks signed the accord in the
ceremony at the National Palace. The other banks will sign in New
York.
   Salinas took office Dec. 1, 1988, six years into an economic
crisis provoked by overborrowing and plunging prices for crude oil,
the country's main export.
   In a sweeping program to reform the heavily-protected economy,
Salinas has opened the country to competition from imports,
encouraged foreign and domestic investment, begun selling a wide
array of state-owned companies to the private sector and started
slashing subsidies.
   Under the agreement, banks could choose from three options:
reducing the principal amount of their loans by 35 percent,
reducing interest to a fixed rate of 6.25 percent, or offering new
loans equal to 25 percent of the debt they already held.
   Banks opted to reduce principal on $20 billion of the debt,
reduce interest on a further $22.5 billion and extend new loans for
$6 billion in existing debt.
   The banks that chose the first two options will exchange their
debt for Mexican government bonds backed by U.S. Treasury bonds.
Mexico will buy the U.S. bonds as collateral with a $7 billion
package of credits from multilateral agencies and Japan, as well as
the Mexican government's own funds.
   Aspe said the agreement will save Mexico an average $4.1 billion
annually in net transfers abroad in the next four years. The figure
includes $1.6 billion in reduced interest payments; an average
influx of $288 million a year in new credits, and the deferment of
prinicpal payments of $2.2 billion a year.
   The country has been paying about $12 billion a year in interest
and principal.
   The agreement ``will serve as an example for the other countries
affected by the problem of debt,'' said Michel Camdessus, director
of the International Monetary Fund, which is lending money to
Mexico as part of the agreement.
   Other countries in line for Brady plan renegotiations have not
made as drastic reforms as Mexico. Venezuela has begun a program,
but renegotiations of about $21 billion of its $34.6 billion
foreign debt have made little headway.
   Argentina, which owes about $64 billion to commercial banks, is
in a ``very difficult situation,'' but President Carlos Menem has
said he will undertake reforms, Brady said.
   Brazil was $4.4 billion behind in interest payments to private
foreign creditors in December and Argentina has about $4 billion in
interest overdue. Brazil is refusing to pay, saying it wants
President-elect Fernando Collor de Mello to assume office in March
with a safe level of reserves.
   Cardenas said that if Mexico had joined other debtor nations to
negotiate in a block, ``a real attitude of responsibility would
have been obtained from the creditor banks.''

   The stock market moved ahead cautiously this
morning, but the advance was limited by concerns that interest
rates are headed higher.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 16.44 points
on Friday, was up 4.28 at 2,606.98 at noontime on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues led declines by a narrow margin among issues
listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 670 up, 617 down and
520 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 59.12 million shares at noon EST
compared with 84.11 million shares at the same point on Friday.
   The stock market has labored this year under the weight of
lackluster corporate earnings reports and rising interest rates.
   Interest rates have been rising in recent days in anticipation
of this week's government auction of $30 billion in new securities.
   ``No one is willing to go out and commit themselves,'' said
Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst at MKI Securities Corp.
``It's going to take some time to build up confidence in this
market.''
   The auction begins Tuesday with the sale of $10 billion of new
three-year notes followed by similar $10 billion auctions of
10-year notes on Wednesday and 30-year bonds on Thursday.
   This borrowing binge comes in addition to today's regular weekly
sale of $15.3 billion in three-month and six-month Treasury bills.
   Some credit market analysts say rates must rise to keep the
attention of foreign investors, especially the Japanese.
   Higher rates make yields on short-term securities more
competitive with those on stocks and could hurt the corporate
earnings outlook.
   Pan Am was the most actively-traded issue on the NYSE as of
midday, and was up } at 3}. A union official said Sunday that Pan

   International Paper Co. said Monday it would
close its Philadelphia-area container plant by April 6, affecting
about 100 employees.
   Benny R. Smith, general manager of IP's northern container
division, said a review of plant operations made it ``clear that
closing the Philadelphia plant was unavoidable due to the continued
unprofitable nature of the operation.''
   IP has other container plants in the Northeast that can serve
the Philadelphia plant's customers, Smith said.
   Smith said IP will provide job severance and job placement
services to affected employees. The plant employs an average 70
hourly and 28 salaried workers, but a company announcement did not
specify what services or transfer rights would be available to them.
   A company spokesman did not immediately return a phone call
seeking further details.
   IP bought the plant, which makes corrugated containers, in 1958.

<HEAD>Capital Cities-ABC, Tribune Post Earnings Gains for 4th Qtr</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Capital Cities-ABC Inc. said Monday its earnings climbed 30
percent in the fourth quarter while another large media company,
Tribune Co., reported a 7 percent increase in its profit for the
same period.
   Capital Cities-ABC, the New York-based operator of the ABC
Television Network, said it earned $182 million, or $10.33 a share,
in the three months ended Dec. 31 compared with $140.2 million, or
$7.76 a share, a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 14.4 percent to $1.51 billion from
$1.32 billion in 1988.
   For the year, Capital Cities earned $485.7 million, or $27.25 a
share, up 25.6 percent from $387.1 million, or $22.31 a share, a
year earlier.
   Annual revenue rose 4 percent to $4.96 billion from $4.77
billion in 1988.
   The company said operating income rose 13 percent for the year
to $922.5 million, including a 16 percent increase from
broadcasting.
   The ABC Television Network had significantly improved results
compared with a slight loss in 1988, the company said. Revenue at
the network was up slightly for the year as strong advertising
demand in the second half of 1989 offset the impact of the Winter
Olympics and Super Bowl telecasts on 1988 results.
   Operating results at its 80 percent-owned ESPN cable network
were well ahead of last year, while the company's eight television
stations and 21 radio stations and radio networks reported moderate
increases.
   Publishing earnings improved slightly with gains for its
newspapers offset by declines at several specialized publications.
   Chicago-based Tribune Co. said it earned $$67.6 million, or 90
cents a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31 compared with
$62.9 million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 7 percent to $668 million from
$624.7 million a year earlier.
   The company cited improved newspaper results, a reduction in net
interest expense and a lower effective tax rate for the increase.
   For the year, Tribune said it earned $242.4 million, or $3.17 a
share, up 15 percent from $210.4 million, or $2.78 a share, a year
earlier.
   Revenue for the year rose 5 percent to $2.45 billion from $2.33
billion in 1988.
   The operating profit at the newspaper group rose 13 percent for
the year to $297.1 million, as improved results at the Chicago, Ft.
Lauderdale and Orlando newspapers more than offset an operating
loss at the New York Daily News.
   Advertising revenue rose 5 percent for the year while
circulation revenue rose 4 percent.
   The company's broadcasting and entertainment group posted a 24
percent increase in operating profit for the year to $96.8 million
despite a $10 million writedown of television programming assets in
the second quarter.
   Tribune owns six TV stations and four radio stations and its
entertainment group is involved with TV programs including ``At the
Movies,'' ``Geraldo'' and ``The Joan Rivers Show.''
   Its newsprint business had an operating profit of $61.3 million
for the year, down 38 percent from a year ago.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls in Europe, Gold Rises</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar declined Monday against other
major currencies, particularly the West German mark, in quiet
European trading.
   Gold prices rose.
   Foreign exchange dealers said trading was generally dull and
uneventful. But they said a late burst of dollar selling against
the West German mark helped push the U.S. currency nearly 2
pfennigs lower than levels quoted late Friday in London.
   The dollar fell on the belief that Soviet Leader Mikhail
Gorbachev will succeed in persuading the Communist Party to give up
its exclusive claim to power, said a senior dealer at Barclays Bank
PLC.
   The directorate of the Communist Party's Central Committee was
meeting Monday and Tuesday to debate Gorbachev's proposal.
   ``There was a return of some sentiment that Gorbachev will stamp
his mark on the Politburo,'' the dealer said.
   There have been fears that Gorbachev would run into severe
opposition at the party conference in Moscow. The dollar often
benefits from political turmoil abroad.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed up 0.64 yen to 145.60 yen. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 145.30 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6980 from $1.6820 late
Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday:
1.6670 West German marks, down from 1.6860; 1.4780 Swiss francs,
down from 1.4964; 5.6573 French francs, down from 5.7360; 1.8880
Dutch guilders, down from 1.9010; 1,236.00 Italian lire, down from
1,252.00; and 1.1891 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1884.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $423.25 a troy ounce,
up from $417.25 late Friday. In Zurich, gold rose to $423.00 an
ounce from $417.75.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.10 to close at a bid $416.86
an ounce.
   Silver rose in London to a late bid price of $5.37 a troy ounce
from late Friday's $5.29.

10-year notes on Wednesday and 30-year bonds on Thursday.
   This borrowing binge comes in addition to today's regular weekly
sale of $15.3 billion in three-month and six-month Treasury bills.
   Some credit market analysts say rates must rise to keep the
attention of foreign investors, especially the Japanese.
   Higher rates make yields on short-term securities more
competitive with those on stocks and could hurt the corporate
earnings outlook.

<HEAD>EC Leader Says Britain Meets Conditions for Eurocurrency
Membership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European Community Competition Commissioner Sir
Leon Brittan said Monday that Britain's conditions for becoming a
full member of the European Monetary System have been met.
   ``The way is now open for the government to start looking for an
early date for full EMS membership,'' Sir Leon told the Overseas
Banking Club in London.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, under pressure to link
the pound to the system's currency-stabilizing Exchange Rate
Mechanism, laid down stringent conditions last June.
   These included that France and Italy abolish controls on the
movement of capital and that Britain's high inflation rate, now
nearly 8 percent, fall.
   Sir Leon said France and Italy were removing exchange controls,
rules for a single market in banking were agreed upon, the
commission was taking a more ``rigorous'' approach to state
subsidies of industry and the British government was trying to
reduce inflation.
   ``Once the downward trend is clear, joining the ERM would
actually help the continuing battle against inflation,'' he said.

<HEAD>Company Breaks Off Talks About Planned Defense Subsidiary Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Daimler-Benz AG said Monday it
has broken off talks with a consortium of several West German
engineering companies about the sale of its navy and missile
technology lines.
   The sale is required as part of a government agreement that
allowed Daimler-Benz to take over the aerospace concern
Messerschmitt-Boelker-Blohm GmbH. It was the largest merger in West
German history.
   Daimler-Benz said its Deutsche Aerospace AG aircraft and defense
subsidiary has ended negotiations with Systemtechnik Nord, a group
of companies led by the steel and machinery company Fried. Krupp
GmbH.
   In November, Daimler-Benz signed a memorandum of understanding
with Systemtechnik Nord to sell the navy and missile activities.
   The consortium was formed under pressure from the governments of
Hamburg and Bremen, where most of the navy and missile operations
are located, to prevent a loss of jobs.
   A spokesman for Deutsche Aerospace said the company has ``gained
the impression that not all partners of the consortium intend to
stick to the memorandum of understanding.'' He did not elaborate.
   But the spokesman did not rule out an agreement with the group
once the talks have been put on a new basis.
   Besides Krupp, which holds 35 percent of Systemtechnik Nord,
Preussag-Salzgitter and Bremer Vulkan own 30 percent each, while
Matra SA of France and two smaller shipbuilding companies have a
joint 5 percent.
   Under the terms set by Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann last
September, Daimler-Benz has two years to sell the two divisions.
   Hausmann approved the merger against the recommendation of the
Federal Cartel Office and strong political forces, but set certain
conditions to help maintain competition in the nation's defense
industry.
   The purchase of MBB made Daimler-Benz the country's largest
aerospace and defense company. Daimler-Benz also makes
Mercedes-Benz automobiles.
   A spokesman for the city government of Bremen said Daimler-Benz
and the consortium have not agreed on the price of the transaction.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade, although near-term
wheat contracts rose amid news of a wheat sale to China and a call
for more wheat sales to the Soviet Union.
   The Agriculture Department said Monday morning it had accepted
China's bid for 300,000 metric tons of wheat at subsidized prices
for delivery in April and May.
   Under a government program designed to increase export sales,
the grain exporters who sell China the wheat will receive grain or
grain credits from the government.
   The wheat market got a further boost from the National
Association of Wheat Growers' call to increase offers of subsidized
wheat to the Soviet Union.
   In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, the
association requested the USDA offer another 2 million metric tons
of wheat to the Soviets.
   Other grain and soybean futures finished slightly lower,
pressured by forecasts for beneficial precipitation this week in
the nation's midsection.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2 cents lower to 4 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.83 a bushel; corn
futures were { cent to 1{ cents lower with March at $2.36\ a

<HEAD>Former Paramount Exec Named to Development Post at Time Warner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Warner Inc. said Monday it had selected
Arthur Barron, a retired executive from entertainment industry
rival Paramount Communications Inc., to head its new business
development operation.
   Barron, 55, will be chairman of Time Warner Enterprises, which
oversees the company's new ventures and its minority equity
holdings.
   In his new post, Barron will be involved primarily in the
development of Time Warner's strategies and ventures abroad, the
company said.
   Barron retired last July from Paramount, where he had been
president of the entertainment group, which includes Paramount
Pictures, Madison Square Garden, the New York Knicks basketball
team and the New York Rangers hockey team and theater operations.
   Ironically, Paramount tried to halt Time Inc.'s merger with
Warner Communications Inc. last year by mounting a bid for Time,
which Time management rejected. Barron said he was ``on the
sidelines'' for that episode.
   He announced in 1987 that he planned to retire from Paramount
when he reached age 55 after 26 years service.
   In the six months following his departure from Paramount, Barron
said he had a chance to ``take inventory and see what I wanted to
do next.''
   He decided he wanted to get back into the business and began
talking a month or so ago about the possibility of joining Time
Warner.
   In addition to serving as president of the Paramount
entertainment group for five years, Barron served at various times
as chief financial officer and executive vice president at
Paramount Pictures, the movie division, and as vice president and
general sales manager for worldwide syndication at Desilu
Productions Inc., which makes television shows.
   He and his wife Joan live in Beach Haven, N.J.

   Schlumberger Ltd.'s fourth-quarter net income
slipped to $118.1 million, or 50 cents a share, from $118.9
million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said
Monday.
   Revenue in the three-month period totaled $1.2 billion, down
about 3 percent from $1.24 billion in the comparable 1988 period.
   For the year, the New York-based oil drilling and oilfield
service company had net income of $441.5 million, or $1.86 a share,
down from $476.2 million, or $1.80 a share, in 1988. Revenue
totaled $4.7 billion, down about 5 percent from $4.9 billion in the
previous year.
   Schlumberger said the previous year's stock buyback reduced the
company's interest income in 1989.
   ``Decreased interest income of $63 million primarily resulted
from spending $1.2 billion in 1988 to repurchase 34.5 million
shares,'' said Chairman Euan Baird.
   The increase in earnings per share on lower income also was the
result of fewer average shares outstanding, Baird said.
   Higher oil prices in late 1989 helped the company's oilfield
businesses recover from a slump in 1988, he said.

<HEAD>Sears 4th Qtr. Net Up From Depressed Year-Ago; Hugo Hits Allstate
Results</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. on Monday reported its
fourth-quarter earnings rose sharply from a year earlier, when it
undertook a costly restructuring, and said Hurricane Hugo and the
Bay Quake made 1989 the costliest year ever for its Allstate
insurance subsidiary.
   Results from Sears' merchandise group, its biggest business,
rose sharply in a performance that several retailing analysts said
was better than they had expected.
   Sears reported net income of $602.1 million, or $1.76 per common
share, for the three months ended Dec. 31 compared with $117.4
million, or 32 cents per share, for the same period a year earlier.
   Sales for the quarter rose 4.2 percent to $15.2 billion from
$14.6 billion, Chicago-based Sears said in a statement.
   Results for the fourth quarter of 1988 included an after-tax
charge of $442 million for restructuring of the company's retailing
business and a loss of $78.9 million from the sale of Allstate
Insurance Co.'s life and health insurance operations.
   For all of 1989, Sears reported net income of $1.51 billion, or
$4.30 per share, compared with $1.45 billion, or $3.84 per share,
in 1988. Annual revenue rose 7.1 percent to a record $53.8 billion
from $50.3 billion in 1988, Sears said.
   ``The company is well-positioned as it enters the 1990s and we
expect momentum to build as the year progresses,'' Chairman Edward
A. Brennan said in a statement accompanying the earnings.
   Last year, Sears overhauled its retailing operation, the world's
largest, by cutting costs and introducing ``everyday low pricing''
in hopes of reversing slippage in its market share to both general
merchandise discounters such as K mart and Wal-Mart and to
``superstores'' specializing in appliances, electronics or
automotive products.
   The effectiveness of the strategy has been questioned since its
debut last March but analysts said the fourth-quarter results
indicated the retailing unit may be shaping up after a shakeout.
   The merchandise group reported fourth-quarter income of $368.6
million on sales of $9.6 billion compared with a loss of $113.5
million on sales of $9.5 billion in 1988. The 1988 period included
a $442 million after-tax restructuring charge.
   The fourth quarter 1989 results included a $26 million after-tax
gain from an accounting change, compared with a $26.4 million
after-tax charge in 1988 for the same accounting change.
   ``Generally speaking, they are making progress,'' said retail
analyst Monroe Greenstein, of the investment firm Bear, Stearns &amp;
Co.
   He said the merchandise unit was getting a better grip on
expenses and that its gross profit margin was wider than many
observers had expected, due partly to the mix of goods Sears is
offering.
   Retail analyst Edward Weller of Montgomery Securities Inc. also
said the results of the merchandise group were better than he had
expected.
   Allstate reported fourth-quarter income of $245.4 million on
revenue of $4.2 billion, compared with $206.3 million on revenue of
$3.8 billion in fourth quarter 1988.
   Sears said natural disasters last year, including Hurricane
Hugo, the northern California quake and severe cold weather in the
South, resulted in historically high catastrophic damage claims
against Allstate but would not reveal the dollar amount of the
claims.
   Sears earlier had pegged claims stemming from Hurricane Hugo
alone at more than $250 million.
   The Dean Witter financial services group reported fourth-quarter
income of $48.4 million on revenue of $1.1 billion, compared with
operating profit of $26.3 million on revenue of $958.7 million a
year earlier.
   The Coldwell Banker real estate group reported fourth-quarter
income of $15.3 million on revenue of $362.6 million compared with
income of $61.9 million on revenue of $377.4 million a year earlier.

   Sales of cars and trucks made in North America by
the nation's Big Three automakers fell 4.6 percent in late January
from last year, with an increase in truck sales offsetting falling
car sales, the companies said Monday.
   The sales pace last year was among the highest during any 10-day
period of 1989, skewing the comparison with this year. During the
period this year, the Big Three, especially Chrysler Corp., were
offering incentives, and these inducements seemed to be boosting
truck sales.
   Car sales for the three companies fell 12.9 percent while truck
sales jumped 10.2 percent.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler said they sold
cars and trucks at an average daily rate of 36,537 during Jan.
21-31, compared with a rate of 38,284 during the same time last
year.
   Chrysler announced a new incentive program Dec. 15, 1989, that,
for the first time, offered cash rebates or low-interest financing
on its popular minivans: the Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and
Chrysler Town and Country.
   In January, Chrysler extended the incentives on all models but
the minivans until the end of February. Chrysler guarantees that if
it boosts the rebates before Sept. 30, the automaker will make up
the difference to those that bought the vehicles during the current
incentive period.
   Chrysler, which has made liberal use of incentives in the past,
said its late-January car sales fell 4.1 percent while its truck
sales, including the company's popular minivans and Jeeps, rose
42.7 percent. Those figures combined for a sales rate 20.3 percent
higher than during the period last year.
   For the whole month, Chrysler's car and trucks sales were 19.9
percent higher than in January 1989.
   Ford said its combined car and truck sales fell 14.2 percent
during late January compared with the same time last year, with car
sales dropping 17.8 percent and light truck sales falling 8.2
percent.
   For the entire month, Ford's vehicle sales were down 5.2 percent.
   GM said its car and truck sales fell 6.5 percent during late
January as car sales declined 11.8 percent and truck sales rose 6.8
percent. For all of January, GM's car and truck sales were 5.1
percent higher than in January of last year.

center stage in foreign exchange.
   Gold prices rose in domestic and overseas trading.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $422.40 a troy ounce, $4.20 higher than
Friday's close. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late
bid for gold at $422.75 an ounce, up $4.25.
   Gabriele Schmitt, a corporate trader for the Bank of New York,
said the dollar's decline both here and abroad was ``mainly due to
the mark's strength as opposed to the dollar's weakness.''
   She said the mark gained on the belief that Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev will persuade his nation's Communist Party to
give up its exclusive claim to power, thereby further fueling
speculation that East and West Germany could some day be reunited.
   ``Even if it doesn't become a reunified Germany right away ...
the belief is that West Germany has the potential to serve this
huge market,'' Schmitt said. ``A lot of people are investing in
German corporations.''
   The dollar closed at 1.6590 marks in New York, down from 1.6830
Friday, and at 1.6670 marks in Europe, down from 1.6860.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed up 0.64 yen at 145.60 yen. It was quoted
at 145.30 yen in London, and at 144.70 yen in New York, down from
145.50 yen Friday.
   Traders said the dollar's fall against the yen reflected concern
the Japanese might keep a lower profile in the U.S. Treasury
Department's quarterly bond auction this week. Reduced Japanese
purchases would mean less demand for dollars to buy the bonds.
   The dollar was weaker against the British pound. Sterling rose
to $1.6980 from $1.6820 late Friday in London, and to $1.7000 from
$1.6840 in New York.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
quotes, included: 1.47275 Swiss francs, down from 1.4920; 5.6370
French francs, down from 5.7160; 1,231.00 Italian lire, down from
1,251.00; and 1.18735 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18845.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Friday: 1.4780 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4964; 5.6573 French francs, down from 5.7360;
1.8880 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9010; 1,236.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,252.00; and 1.1891 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1884.
   Gold gained in London to $423.25 an ounce from $417.25 late
Friday. In Zurich, gold rose to $423 an ounce from $417.75.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.10 to close at a bid $416.86
an ounce.
   Silver prices also headed higher. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery settled at $5.329 a troy ounce, up 2.2
cents from Friday. Silver rose in London to $5.37 an ounce from
$5.29.

<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices sagged Monday mainly on
technical factors with little news to buoy the market, analysts
said.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, dropped
63 cents to $22.39 a 42-gallon barrel after a gain of 32 cents
Friday.
   Contracts for later delivery declined 58 cents to 51 cents a
barrel.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the March
contract for No. 2 heating oil, which jumped 1.52 cents Friday,
tumbled 2.31 cents to end at 55.95 cents a gallon. Contracts for
delivery through 1990 closed down from 2 cents to 1.24 cents.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for March delivery finished off 1.82
cents at 62.40 cents a gallon. Other contracts closed with losses
of 2 cents to 1.65 cents.
   Analysts attributed the days losses mainly to technical factors
and to selling ahead of Tuesday's inventory report by the American
Petroleum Institute.
   ``There wasn't any news driving the market today,'' said Jack
Unger, energy broker for Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. ``Some
people might be getting out before the APIs.''
   Unger said heavy waves of selling by large commodities brokers
knocked prices lower in spurts throughout the trading session.
   ``It made buyers skittish,'' Unger said.
   Randall Rothenberg, futures trader with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc., said expectations of warmer weather also helped depress
prices.
   ``Some poeple went long Friday hoping that cold weather in the
Northeast would stimulate prices but those hopes were dashed today
with forecasts of 50-degree temperatures by midweek,'' Rothenberg
said.

   The stock market gained more ground Monday, but
its modest advance came in the slowest trading of the new year amid
worries that interest rates are headed higher.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 16.44 points
on Friday, added another 19.82 points to close at 2,622.52. It was
the third increase in the market's best-known indicator in the past
four sessions.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
838 up, 646 down and 490 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 130.95 million
shares, down from 164.40 million in the previous session. That was
the lowest trading volume since 128.03 million shares on Dec. 28,
1989.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 174.12 million shares.
   Prices of blue-chip stocks moved into the plus column early in
the session, and held onto tiny gains for most of the day,
extending their advance with a spurt in the final hour of trading.
   The market has generally labored this year under the weight of
lackluster corporate earnings reports and rising interest rates.
   Interest rates are of particular concern this week as the
government plans to auction $30 billion in new securities over the
next three days.
   Some credit market analysts say rates must rise to attract
foreign investors, especially the Japanese.
   Higher rates hurt the stock market, however, by making yields on
short-term securities more competitive and placing pressure on
corporate earnings.
   ``No one is willing to go out and commit themselves,'' said
Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst at MKI Securities Corp.
``It's going to take some time to build up confidence in this
market.''
   Newton D. Zinder, senior vice president at Shearson Lehman
Hutton, said the late advance came from ``traders who were
encouraged the market did not go down with bond prices as weak as
they have been.''
   Yields on short-term Treasury issues added between 2 and 4 basis
points, or hundredths of a percentage point, on Monday, while the
yield on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 8.53 percent from 8.50
percent late Friday.
   Amax was the most active issue on the NYSE, rising } to 23}.
Among other actively-traded stocks, Philip Morris gained | to 38~,
Exxon rose &lsqb; to 48, Bank of New England added { to 5} and IBM

<HEAD>Oil Futures Plunge As Supply-Demand Factors Come To Fore</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Petroleum futures prices fell sharply Monday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange as traders frustrated by resistance in the
crude oil market turned their sights to a bevy of bearish signals
for gasoline and heating oil.
   On other commodity markets, orange juice futures plunged;
precious metals advanced; livestock and meat futures were higher;
and grains and soybeans were mostly lower.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled 51 cents to 63
cents lower with the contract for delivery in March at $22.39 a
barrel; wholesale home heating oil finished 1.34 cents to 2.31
cents lower with March at 55.95 cents a gallon; wholesale unleaded
gasoline was 1.65 cents to 2 cents lower with March at 62.40 cents
a gallon.
   Energy futures prices rose across the board last week, largely
due to technical strength in the crude oil market despite such
negative fundamental factors as weak cash markets for petroleum
products and growing U.S. inventories of gasoline and heating oil.
   Signs of an impending collapse first surfaced Friday when the
March crude oil contract climbed to $23.05, then fell back. Market
bulls tried again on Monday to bid the contract beyond its lifetime
high of $23.18, but the rally failed at $23.06, setting the stage
for a sell-off.
   And with plenty of negative supply-and-demand news around _
including weak cash markets, slack demand for heating oil and
expanding inventories of refined products _ prices fell rapidly.
   ``The market just ran out of steam today,'' said Jim Fiedler, a
vice president of E.D.&amp; F. Man International Futures Inc. ``Crude
had been carrying us for the last few days but I think the product
fundamentals started coming through.''
   Orange juice futures prices tumbled on the New York Cotton
Exchange in a wave of selling inspired almost entirely by technical
factors.
   Analysts said they expect the Agriculture Department, in a
report scheduled for release Friday, to reduce by as much as 4
million boxes its estimate for the Florida orange crop, which was
severely damaged by a Christmastime freeze. Last month, the USDA
pegged the crop at 91 million boxes.
   Frozen concentrated orange juce settled 4.65 cents to 6.35 cents
lower with March at $1.9065 a pound.
   Gold futures posted strong gains on New York's Commodity
Exchange as concerns about political change in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe prompted new buying by investors.
   Gold futures finished $4.10 to $4.20 higher with February at
$422.40 a troy ounce; silver was 2 cents to 2.4 cents higher with
March at $5.358 a troy ounce.
   Pork belly futures rose sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in a technical rebound from last week's steep losses.
   Most livestock futures also rose in line with strong cash
markets.
   Live cattle ended .02 cent lower to .70 cent higher with
February at 79.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent to .70
cent higher with March at 83.17 cents a pound; live hogs were .10
cent lower to .60 cent higher with February at 49.02 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 1.08 cent to 1.52 cent higher with
February at 50.52 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures settled mostly lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade with the exception of near-term wheat contracts,
which gained amid news of a wheat sale to China and a call for more
wheat sales to the Soviet Union.
   The Agriculture Department said Monday morning it had accepted
China's bid for 300,000 metric tons of wheat at subsidized prices
for delivery in April and May.
   The wheat market got a further boost from a call by the National
Association of Wheat Growers' call for the USDA to offer 2 million
metric tons more wheat to the Soviet Union.
   Wheat futures settled 2 cents lower to 4{ cents higher with
March at $3.83{ a bushel; corn futures were \ cent to 1\ cents
lower with March at $2.36{ a bushel; oats were { cent to 1 cent
lower with March at $1.35 a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 2
cents lower with March at $5.58\ a bushel.

   General Electric Co.'s RCA division
pleaded guilty Monday to illegally obtaining classified Pentagon
planning documents and agreed to pay $2.5 million to settle charges
in the continuing probe of contractors trading defense secrets.
   RCA Corp. pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to two felony
counts of ``conveying without authority'' two secret editions of a
Pentagon five-year spending program.
   A current RCA marketing official and a former one also pleaded
guilty to felony counts of unlawfully conveying the secret
documents they obtained from other defense firms to other people in
RCA. The two face possible 10-year prison sentences.
   RCA's guilty plea marked an acceleration in the government's
contining investigation, dubbed ``Operation Uncover.''
   Nearly three months ago, Boeing Co. admitted it had illegally
obtained Defense Department budget documents and paid $5.2 million
in fines and restitution.
   Former Boeing employee Richard Lee Fowler was sentenced last
month to two years in prison for obtaining more than 100 secret
Pentagon documents and passing them along to Boeing and other
contractors.
   In pleading guilty, RCA conceded to a statement of facts filed
by prosecutors that it had acquired a wide array of secret Pentagon
planning budget documents between 1978 and 1985 from other defense
contractors.
   These included copies of authoritative statements of overall
defense policy and program memoranda that detailed weapon-system
priorities for the Army, the Air Force and the Navy, according to
the prosecution filing.
   U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris fined the company $20,000.
RCA, which was bought by GE in 1986, also agreed to pay the
government $2.48 million to settle civil claims.
   RCA admitted in one count that on Dec. 19, 1983, marketing
official Leonard C. Kampf provided a five-year planning document
that contained details of the Pentagon's fiscal 1985 budget.
   In the second count, it admitted obtaining on Nov. 28, 1984, a
five-year defense program document containing details for the
fiscal 1986 budget from Ronald B. Stevens.
   Kampf, 69, who left the company in 1984, and Stevens, 49,
manager of marketing services at RCA's Government Systems Division
in Cherry Hill, N.J., have agreed to cooperate in the continuing
investigation.
   They obtained the documents from employees of other defense
firms, according to the government's filing.
   According to court papers, Kampf obtained documents from Philip
R. Jackson, RCA's marketing representative in Washington.
   Jackson, who has received immunity from prosecution in return
for his cooperation, testified at Fowler's trial that he received
20 documents from Fowler.
   The probe of major defense firms is continuing, said Michael
Costello, who heads the investigation for the Pentagon's inspector
general. Costello declined to identify those companies specifically
under investigation.
   But RCA, Boeing and seven other firms were alleged during the
Fowler trial to be part of a ring of companies that swapped secret
Pentagon documents. The others named in testimony were Honeywell,
Bendix, IBM, Grumman, Raytheon, Rockwell and Martin Marietta.
   GE spokesman George Jamison said Stevens has been suspended from
his job.
   GE said in a statement from its Fairfield, Conn., headquartgrs
that RCA, a wholly-owned subsidiary, agreed to enter the guilty
plea after learning that Kampf and Stevens had planned to plead
guilty.
   ``This unfortunate chapter in RCA history is now closed,'' GE
said in its statement. Jamison stressed that the allegations
centered on RCA. ``There have never been any allegations about GE
with regard to this,'' he said.
   RCA's guilty plea came just three days after GE was convicted in
Philadelphia of bilking the Pentagon out of $10 million for a
battlefield computer system.
   GE, the nation's third-largest defense contractor, could be
fined up to $71.9 million and faces possible suspension from future
contracts.

<HEAD>Freddie Mac Quarterly Earnings Up 19 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or
Freddie Mac, said Monday its earnings rose 19 percent to a record
$115 million in 1989's fourth quarter, which it attributed to
higher income on its mortgage-backed securities sales.
   The October-December earnings of $1.72 per share compare with
$97 million, or $1.45 per share, in the same period a year earlier.
   For all of 1989, Freddie Mac reported net income of $437
million, or $6.57 per share, up 15 percent from $381 million, or
$5.73 per share, in 1988.
   Freddie Mac is a congressionally chartered but stockholder-owned
company that helps finance one in eight American homes, primarily
by purchasing mortgages from lenders and repackaging them into
securities for sale to investors.
   Chartered in 1970, it was originally owned by the nation's
savings and loans. Its stock was publicly traded for the first time
last year.
   David Glenn, chief executive officer, said the company in 1989
had record mortgage securities volume and purchased the
second-highest amount of mortgages in its history.

<HEAD>LTV Earnings Decline 24 Percent On Aerospace, Steel Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LTV Corp.'s profit fell 24 percent in the fourth
quarter, due partly to a slump in the domestic steel industry and
depressed results in its commercial aerospace programs, the company
said Monday.
   LTV, currently operating under bankruptcy court supervision,
said that for the three months ended Dec. 31, net income was $72.3
million, or 50 cents a share, down from $95.3 million, or 67 cents,
in the same 1988 quarter. Revenue declined about 6 percent to $1.58
billion from $1.67 billion.
   The defense and energy company attributed the lower sales to
reductions in military aircraft programs and fewer deliveries of
LTV's multiple launch rocket system.
   LTV said higher costs for raw materials and services had a
negative impact on its steel businesses. An increase in steel
export volume was partially offset by a slumping automotive market,
the company said.
   Lower demand also helped reduce overall steel plant operating
capacity to 76 percent in the quarter, compared with 87 percent a
year earlier.
   For the year, LTV earned $264.9 million, or $1.82 a share, a
sharp reversal from 1988, when the company lost $3.15 billion, or
$30.94 a share. Sales totaled $6.36 billion, a 13 percent drop from
$7.3 billion in the previous year.
   The loss included a $1.35 billion charge related to the
company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and a one-time $2.26 billion
non-cash charge to reflect a change in the way the company accounts
for pension benefits.
   Last year's earnings included a $30 million write down of costs
associated with the company's cancellation of plans to build a
flexible composites center to make advanced aircraft components.
   LTV, which completed the sale its Warren, Ohio steel bar
manufacturing plant in November, said exclusion of those results
for 1989, accounted for a $71 million decline in 1989 operating
income and for an $872 million decline in the steel group's sales
for the year.
   The divestiture is part of LTV's plan to reorganize into a more
streamlined company before emerging from bankruptcy.
   LTV said its results also benefited from the deferral of
interest, pension and other costs while the company operates under
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

<HEAD>New Kids on The Block `Immortalized in Plastic' as Hasbro Dolls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hasbro Inc. on Monday unveiled dolls modeled
after the five members of the New Kids on the Block in a push by
the big toy manufacturer to spur sales by capitalizing on the
popular singing group.
   The announcement of the line of dolls and accessories was made
at a news conference in Manhattan's Hard Rock Cafe, which houses
rock 'n' roll memorabilia ranging from an Elvis Presley costume to
an Eric Clapton guitar.
   Outside, hundreds of screaming fans _ mostly young girls _
crowded the sidewalk eager for a glimpse of the group that has been
spinning hits out of anti-drug and other wholesome messages.
   The teenagers started converging on the area in the early
morning after being tipped off by a local radio station that their
music idols would be appearing at the news conference, a policeman
at the scene said. He estimated that hundreds, possibly as many as
1,000, young fans were on hand.
   ``What you saw out there is the reason why we're bringing out
the line,'' said Wayne Charness, a Hasbro spokesman. ``We are
grasping on to something that girls can't seem to get enough of.''
   One girl pressed up against the police barricade flanking the
cafe entrance, Geneive Kervandjian, said she was skipping classes
at Russell Sage Junior High 190 in Queens in hopes of seeing the
Kids. Why?
   ``Because they're talented and I like what they stand for _ and
they're gorgeous!'' she chortled.
   Al Carosi, Hasbro's senior vice president of marketing, said it
was the first time the company has entered into a licensing
agreement with a major name in music to create a line of fashion
figures.
   Word of the hookup with the Kids was timed to generate advance
publicity for Hasbro ahead of the line's official debut at Toy
Fair, the industry's annual trade show that begins next Monday.
   The Hasbro line will be on store shelves by August, Carosi said.
A month later a new half-hour Saturday morning cartoon television
show based on the Kids is scheduled to begin airing. A
feature-lenth film starring the Kids will begin shooting in October.
   The centerpiece of the Hasbro line are bendable 12\-inch dolls
made to resemble the five Kids _ Jonathan Knight, his brother
Jordan, Joe McIntyre, Donnie Wahlberg and Danny Wood _ complete
with earrings, ponytails, rings and bracelets. They come dressed in
either casual street clothes or stage costumes.
   The ``street look'' dolls will sell for around $12.99. Each
concert doll, which will sell for about $15.99, carries a pretend
microphone and comes with a cassette of a taped interview in which
a group member answers questions on hot teeny-bopper topics like
dating and kissing.
   The rest of the line, sold separately, includes additional
clothes to augment the dolls' wardrobes, a stage playset including
make-believe instruments, a battery-operated microphone, puzzles
and other items.
   Lawrence Bernstein, president of the Hasbro toy division, said
the company thinks the Kids have a long time before their
popularity peaks and the line should be a lucrative addition to
Hasbro's products, including the G.I. Joe action figures and
Cabbage Patch dolls. Hasbro is the country's biggest toy company.
   The New Kids on the Block, whose members range in age from 17 to
20 and do not play instruments, was assembled in 1984 by Boston
producer Maurice Starr and started its first major tour last summer
as an opening act for former teen-queen Tiffany.
   Donnie Walhberg, who oftens acts as the group's spokesman, said
members were honored to be turned into toys by Hasbro and had no
qualms about using their pop music success in the commercial
venture.
   ``We are being immortalized in plastic,'' Wahlberg said.

<TEXT>
   A record 38.3 million foreigners traveled to
the United States last year, contributing to a $450 million travel
surplus, the first in U.S. history, the Commerce Department
announced Monday.
   ``For the first time, the U.S. will enjoy a travel surplus of
half a billion dollars,'' Undersecretary Rockwell Schnabel tol a
briefing.``This means that foreigners spent more money in the
United States than U.S. ciitzens spent abroad.''
   The department's U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration said
American and foreign travelers spent an identical $8.7 billion in
getting to their destinations.
   But foreign visitors spent $34.3 billion in the United States,
while Americans spent $33.9 billion abroad.
   ``For 1990, the surplus is projected to be $1.5 billion,'' Don
Wynegar, the administration's research director, said.
   The adminstration is forecasting a 6 percent increase to 40.7
million foreign visitors this year and a 7 percent gain to 43.4
million in 1991.
   By the year 2000, foreign tourists are expected to total 67
million visitors, spending a projected $89 billion, Schnabel said.
   Sixty-four percent of the foreign tourists came from U.S.
neighbors _ 15.2 million from Canada and 9.3 million from Mexico.
   Wynegar said 3 million Japanese visited the United States, an 18
percent increase over 1988, followed by 2.2 million British
tourists, a 23 percent increase.
   Schnabel said overseas markets with the largest potential for
continued growth include Japan, Britain, Australia and Sweden.
   ``While arrivals from Japan and the United Kingdom seem to be
slowing slightly, averaging 9 percent growth per year, growth from
Australia and Sweden is expected to average 14 percent annually in
1990 and 1991,'' he said.
   Wynegar said 10.4 million tourists from Mexico are expected this
year, an 11 percent increase over 1989, while 15.5 million are
expected from Canada, a 2 percent increase.

<HEAD>Company Announces Bankruptcy Plan Approval</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny International Inc. announced Monday
it has received U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval to submit its latest
plan of reorganization to shareholders and creditors for a vote.
   In a statement, Oliver S. Travers, the chairman, chief executive
officer and president, called the court's action ``a major step in
moving the bankruptcy process forward.''
   Allegheny International, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in February 1988, said it expects to emerge from that
status by July. The company said acceptance of its plan would
``pave the way'' for that process.
   The Pittsburgh-based company is a manufacturer of consumer
products, including Sunbeam and Oster appliances.
   The company said it will mail ballots and a description of the
plan to creditors and shareholders within the next two weeks.
Voting is to be completed by March 30.
   The statement said Allegheny International has received a letter
of support for the plan from its unsecured creditors committee. The
company also said it believes the plan will have broad constituent
support.
   Company spokesman Edward M. Romanoff said Allegheny
International proceeded with the reorganization plan despite a
recent takeover bid from New York-based Japonica Partners. The
company's board of directors has ``concerns'' about the investment
firm's ability to make good on its $650 million offer, Romanoff
said.

<HEAD>Simmons Concern Plans To Seek Removal of Georgia Gulf Board</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dallas billionaire Harold C. Simmons, who
launched a $1.1 billion tender offer for Georgia Gulf Corp., said
Monday he would seek to oust the chemical concern's board of
directors.
   In a related development, Georgia Gulf asked a Delaware court to
declare its shareholder rights plan _ known as a ``poison pill''
defense _ valid and enforceable.
   A Simmons-controlled company, NL Industries Inc., said it
intends to seek shareholder approval ``to remove all the current
members'' of Georgia Gulf's board.
   NL Industries of Houston already holds a 9.9 percent stake in
Georgia Gulf.
   In the SEC filing, NL said it intends to solicit the written
consents of other Georgia Gulf shareholders ``in support of the
removal of the current directors and the election of the NL
nominees to the company's board of directors.''
   If elected, the NL nominees intend to increase the size of the
board and to proceed with the consumation of the tender offer and
proposed merger.
   GG Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of NL
Industries, launched a $45 per share tender offer for the
outstanding shares of Georgia Gulf.
   NL said it was seeking to dump the current Georgia Gulf board
because on Jan. 15 the company announced it had formulated a
recapitalization plan that would provide shareholders with a
special cash dividend, making a hostile takeover prohibitively
expensive.
   Meanwhile, Georgia Gulf, which is incorporated in Delaware,
asked Delaware Chancery Court to declare the recapitalization plan
valid and enforceable under state law. NL said it had no comment on
the request, which is in the form of a lawsuit against the company
by Georgia Gulf.

<HEAD>Investor and Company Settle SEC Charges for $2 Million</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York investor and his company agreed
Monday to pay $2 million to settle civil charges that alleged the
investor made lucrative securities trades using inside information
from his live-in girlfriend, who worked for an investment
partnership.
   The settlement was announced by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which had charged the defendants _ Charles R. Hack, 43,
of Manhattan, and Bentham International Ltd., a Cayman Islands
corporation of which Hack is a 50 percent owner _ with securities
law violations.
   The transactions took place from February 1985 to September 1986
and involved the trading of stocks or stock options in NL
Industries Inc., Time Inc. and Viacom International Inc.
   Hack and the company did not admit guilt in settling the
charges. Hack agreed to pay $1 million in penalties and Bentham
agreed to repay $1 million, or the amount of the alleged profit.
   According to the SEC complaint, Hack ``directly or indirectly''
received confidential information about the companies from his
girlfriend, Angella Hearn, with whom he lived from October 1975 to
February 1989.
   Ms. Hearn, who was not charged, is employed by Gollust, Tierney
&amp; Olliver, an investment banking partnership that is a general
partner in an umbrella investment firm, Coniston Partners.
   The complaint said that GTO, through Coniston, was involved in a
type of trading called strategic block investing, in which it would
buy large blocks of stock to try to force the company to take
certain steps like restructuring or the liquidation of assets.
   Ms. Hearn maintained all the records of the firm's trading
activity and knew which companies were to be targets of GTO's
strategic block investing, the complaint said.
   After Hack obtained the confidential information, he instructed
his partner in Bentham, Anthony In der Reiden, to have the company
open a securities trading account in the Bahamas and to follow his
instructions on trades.
   In der Reiden, a Dutch citizen living in the Bahamas, was not
charged in the SEC complaint.
   The SEC said that Hearn caused Bentham to buy 10,000 shares and
1,523 call options of NL stock, 275 call options of Time stock and
1,150 call options of Viacom. They were sold at a profit of $1
million, the complaint said.
   A statement released by Hack's attorney, Minna Schrag, said:
``Mr. Hack cooperated with the SEC's investigation from its
inception and none of the profits from the alleged insider trading
were ever distributed or spent.''
   Schrag said the alleged profits had been held in an escrow
account pending the outcome of the SEC's investigation.
   Hack also owns Parkview Associates, a Manhattan real estate
development firm.

<HEAD>Bill Proposed To Help Protect Pension Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation to temporarily block companies
from terminating employee pension funds for the purpose of gaining
access to surplus assets was proposed Monday in the Senate.
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., introduced the bill, saying an
18-month moratorium was needed to give Congress time to review
pension fund changes that affect ``the lives and retirement
security of millions of Americans.''
   At issue is a pratice known as ``reversions,'' in which
companies terminate overfunded pension plans, establish a new
retirement program often through annunities with insurance
companies and take surplus cash for their own use.
   Surplus pension assets have become a popular target for
corporate raiders who acquire a company and use its retirement
programs as a source of cash for other purposes. Since 1980,
according to a Senate committee, at least 2,000 pension funds have
been terminated to provide corporate owners with access to $20
billion in surplus assets.
   ``I tend to believe that pension fund surpluses belong right
where they are _ in the pension fund,'' Kassebaum said in a speech
on the Senate floor.
   ``Terminating these funds and stripping out the `surplus' is but
one more way to realize short-term gain at potentially long-term
cost.''
   The legislation would block only those terminations in which
companies seek to use assets of a retirement fund for non-pension
purposes. A company could cash in a pension plan to create a new
retirement program with better benefits and to make lump sum
payments to workers with accumulated benefits of less than $3,500.
   Kassebaum introduced the legislation in response to what critics
called a ``junk pensions'' proposal involving the Coleman Co.
   The Kansas-based manufacturer of outdoor recreation equipment
was acquired last year by MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings Inc., which
is controlled by takeover specialist Ronald O. Perelman.
   MacAndrews &amp; Forbes had proposed terminating two Coleman
retirement funds valued at $83 million and investing the monies in
annunities with an insurance company with a large share of its
assets in high-risk ``junk'' bonds. Under the proposal, MacAndrews
&amp; Forbes would be able to take more than $32 million in surplus
cash for its own use.
   In response to complaints about the proposal, MacAndrews &amp;
Forbes announced last week that it would revamp the proposal and
buy annunities only from a company with the highest financial
ratings.
   Also Monday, Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., introduced legislation
in the House to provide more protections for pension benefits when
federally insured retirement funds are terminated.

   The court-appointed bankruptcy examiner overseeing
Eastern Airlines said Monday he will fight liquidation of the
carrier and called on creditors and management to start looking for
compromises.
   The comments by examiner David Shapiro were contained in a
statement announcing court approval of a $105 million ticket refund
program for passengers and travel agents.
   Shapiro said it is ``totally irresponsible'' to presume
liquidation or sale are the only alternatives for the Miami-based
airline, which he termed ``eminently reorganizable.''
   ``There's got to be some give and take on both sides,'' said
Shapiro from his Washington, D.C., office. ``If the parties put the
public interest first and their own selfish interests second, then
Eastern is a viable airline.''
   Recently, rumors have circulated that Texas Air Corp. Chairman
Frank Lorenzo, Eastern's owner, would opt for a Chapter 7
liquidation.
   The ticket refund program approved Monday would cover
ticketholders and travel agents who made purchases since Eastern
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization last March 9. Those
who bought tickets issued before the filing remain under bankruptcy
court jurisdiction.
   Meanwhile, Eastern has agreed to hire back 215 flight attendants
by April 1 in a back-to-work accord in which the union agreed to
drop a lawsuit challenging the jobs of 215 recruits hired during
the strike.
   ``Both sides had to compromise, but this was something we could
live with,'' said Mary Jane Barry, president of Local 553 of the
Transport Workers Union, which represents flight attendants at
Eastern.
   The union walked out March 4 in sympathy with the Machinists
union, which remains on strike. The flight attendants called off
their strike on Nov. 23.
   Ms. Barry said terms of the agreement with Eastern were
described in a letter sent Friday to the carrier's flight
attendants.
   Under the accord, the union agreed to drop a lawsuit challenging
the jobs of 215 recruits who were in training when the flight
attendants' strike ended, in exchange for Eastern rehiring 215
senior attendants by April 1.
   Also under the agreement:
   _Eastern agreed the union will continue to represent all Eastern
flight attendants and that all future hiring will come from a
seniority list.
   _Eastern will turn over to the union some $340,000 in dues
collected from flight attendants working since the strike began.
   _The union will drop around $215,000 in claims from a
longstanding dispute over pay to union representatives while on
union business.
   Of the 3,600 flight attendants now working for Eastern, about
half were hired after the strike began. The others are veterans who
crossed the picket lines.
   The union and Eastern still must agree on a new contract to
replace the previous one, which expired in 1988.
   Ms. Barry refused to comment on whether the agreement marked any
change in the hostility between Eastern and its unions. But she
said the contract talks will mark ``the real test of whether we can
get anywhere.''
   Eastern Vice President J. Michael Jones said Eastern was pleased
with the agreement.
   ``We are delighted to have reached a settlement that protects
the jobs of those who assisted in the rebuilding of Eastern,'' he
said in a letter.
   Negotiations are continuing with the pilots union, which ended
its sympathy walkout just before the flight attendants.
   Because of Eastern's downsizing as it strives to emerge from
Chapter 11, the number of former strikers who will get their jobs
back is in doubt.
   ``The company blackmailed the flight attendants,'' said Frank
Ortis, president of the Machinists' local. ``There are still 3,000
of them out of work, and it looks like they are pretty well broke.''

   RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. on Monday reported
losses for the fourth quarter and all of 1989, reflecting the cost
of its record $24.5 billion buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
a year ago.
   The consumer products giant, the former RJR Nabisco Inc. that
was taken private in a deal finalized in February 1989, said it
lost $144 million during the three months ended Dec. 31, compared
with a $411 million profit in the 1988 quarter.
   Quarterly sales totaled $3.54 billion, unchanged from a year ago.
   For the year, RJR Nabisco lost $1.15 billion and had sales of
$12.76 billion. That compared with a $1.4 billion profit the
previous year on $12.64 billion in sales.
   RJR Nabisco blamed the negative results on significantly higher
net interest expenses, its decision to eliminate excess tobacco
trade inventories and costs related to the KKR acquisition.
   Despite the losses, which were expected, Chairman Louis V.
Gerstner Jr. said the company was making fundamental improvements
and had steady operating results in its tobacco and food units.
   ``Our tobacco and food businesses exceeded their goals, despite
the extraordinary organizational changes and restructuring we
undertook to strengthen the company's long-term prospects,''
Gerstner said in a statement. ``We're off to a very strong start.''
   He said the company has substantially completed a divestiture
program spurred by the buyout that has allowed it to repay about $5
billion of the debt it took on in the transaction.
   The company said annual cash flow from operations totaled $647
million after interest payments, exceeding initial expectations.
   The strength of the company's business, and in turn, its cash
flow, is crucial for the success of the buyout, which was
accomplished partly through the sale of $4 billion in high-yield,
high-risk junk bonds.
   Interest and debt expenses shot up to $3.38 billion in 1989 from
$549 million the previous year.
   RJR Nabisco's bonds have fallen sharply in recent days after
Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its rating of the company's
debt, and that could mean higher future borrowing costs.
   Moody's said it downgraded the debt due to uncertainties about
the cash flow of RJR Nabisco's tobacco business over the long term
as the company faces the problem of fewer smokers and possibly
lower profits in the years ahead.
   For the full year, the company's worldwide tobacco businesses
had sales of $6.98 billion, a slight drop from $7.07 bilion in
sales in 1988. But excluding the impact of required
acquisition-related accounting adjustments and the trade inventory
decision, sales would have been up 27 percent, the company said.
   Food businesses reported 1989 sales of $5.78 billion, up 4
percent from $5.57 billion in 1988. The gains occurred despite
record expenses for marketing, research and development of new
products, the company said.
   RJR Nabisco's products include Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and
Winston cigarettes.
   Its major subsidiaries are R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco International Inc., Nabisco Brands Inc. and
Planters LifeSavers Co.

<HEAD>Report: Japan Queries Investors on Their Interest in U.S. T-Bills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bank of Japan has probed life insurance
companies, securities firms and other institutional investors to
guage their interest in buying U.S. Treasury bonds being auctioned
this week, news reports said Tuesday.
   The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's premier financial journal,
reported that the country's central bank asked investors whether
their investing stance had changed since the previous auction of
U.S. government securities late last year.
   The report said some institutions viewed the bank's inquiry as
informal pressure on investors to continue buying U.S. bonds.
   ``It reflects how the Bank of Japan is concerned about the
outcome of the auctions. It's a virtual request for us to purchase
the U.S. bonds actively,'' Kyodo News Service quoted an official
from a life insurance company as saying.
   But Takashi Watanabe, a spokesman for the Bank of Japan, said
the reports were ``groundless.''
   From Tuesday through Thursday, the U.S. Federal Reserve will
auction $30 billion of three-, 10- and 30-year securities.
   In recent years, Japanese investors are estimated to have
purchased as much as one third of all U.S. bonds auctioned. If they
don't bid actively for U.S. bonds at this week's auctions, that
could force American interests rates up and put the brakes on the
economy.
   Kyodo reported that officials at some life insurance companies
called the queries ``unusual'' because Bank of Japan officials
directly visited investors to solicit their responses.
   Fears of higher inflation and political uncertainties have
driven Japanese interest rates up sharply in recent months.
   As a result, Japanese rates now are closer to U.S. interest
rates than they have been in years. That fact has raised concerns
in the U.S. that Japanese investors will no longer find U.S. bonds

   Joseph Hazelwood was in a bar for seven
hours, ordering glasses of vodka, the day before his tanker Exxon
Valdez caused the nation's worst oil spill, and he left the bridge
before a tricky part of the voyage, a prosecutor said Monday.
   But a defense attorney for Hazelwood told jurors the skipper's
judgment was never impaired, that he showed no signs of drunkenness
and was ``calm, cool and collected as a captain should be''
throughout the night and day of the accident.
   Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole accused the fired Exxon
captain of leaving control of his ship in the hands of
inexperienced crewmembers who were not certified to pilot the
vessel through treacherous Prince William Sound, where the tanker
ripped its hull open on a reef outside normal shipping channels.
   ``The ultimate responsibility for the tanker is with the
captain,'' Cole said in his opening statement at Hazelwood's trial.
``The most dangerous part of the journey was after Hazelwood
absented himself from the bridge.''
   Defense attorney Dick Madson, however, told jurors that
Hazelwood left the ship in the hands of qualifed crewmen who may
not have had the proper licenses, but knew the territory and took
appropriate actions when it appeared the Exxon Valdez was in
trouble.
   Cole also alleged that the 43-year-old captain responded wrongly
after the March 24, 1989, accident, frantically trying to move the
ship off the rocks _ a maneuver which he said Hazelwood later
admitted was the wrong thing to do.
   Madson insisted that Hazelwood never put the ship in reverse and
did not try to move it off the rocks. He insisted that Hazelwood
actually was trying to stabilize the ship on the reef in an effort
to prevent further damage.
   Cole said that if Hazelwood had succeeded in moving the ship, it
would have capsized, spilling all of its oil. He noted that at
least some of the tanker's cargo of Alaska crude oil was saved,
although nearly 11 million gallons spilled, killing wildlife and
blackening miles of rocky shoreline.
   Exxon has said it has spent $2 billion on the cleanup. Some
state officials say the work is not over and should continue this
spring and summer.
   Hazelwood is charged with a felony charge of criminal mischief,
and misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment, negligent
discharge of oil and operating a vessel while intoxicated. Maximum
penalty for conviction on all counts is seven years, three months
in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   Cole said that by the time the Coast Guard reached the tanker,
officers could see the extent of the disaster.
   ``They could see the oil bubbling out of the tanker. By some
descriptions, it was 12 to 15 inches thick,'' he recounted.
   Cole reconstructed Hazelwood's actions during the day before the
ship left the oil terminal at Valdez, alleging the captain spent
some seven hours in a bar called the Pipeline Club where patrons
saw him ordering glasses of vodka.
   When he returned to the ship, Cole said, other crewmembers saw
that he was intoxicated and one of them smelled liquor on his
breath.
   Madson said he would dispute that Hazelwood spent the day
drinking before he boarded the ship, although he conceded the
captain had one or two drinks about four hours before he returned
to the tanker.
   Hazelwood's attorney said the captain was in control throughout
the ordeal.
   ``He did not stagger. He did not slur his words. He was cool,
calm and collected as a captain should be,'' Madson said.
   Many hours after the accident, the prosecutor said, two
investigators arrived and found Hazelwood sitting off in a corner
by himself.
   ``It became apparent to both of them that Captain Hazelwood had
been drinking. Both of them asked each other, `Did you smell what I
smelled?' and they both said `Yes.'''
   By the time a state trooper arrived to investigate, Cole said
the man was told ``they had a wild man on board.''
   Later in the day, the ship's pilot, William E. Murphy, testified
that he had lunch with Hazelwood and two other crewmembers on the
day they stopped in Valdez to pick up their cargo of oil. He said
Hazelwood drank iced tea, and that afterward Murphy dropped him off
near the Pipeline Club.
   About eight hours later, they met again on the bridge of the
Exxon Valdez, Murphy said.
   ``While on the bridge did you notice any signs that he had been
drinking?'' asked Cole.
   ``No,'' said Murphy. ``Except I smelled something I associated
with alcohol on his breath.''
   Within a half hour, he said, Hazelwood had left the bridge,
disappearing for about an hour.
   ``It's not unusual for masters to leave the bridge,'' said
Murphy. ``It wasn't typical to be gone for that long in the
narrows.''
   ``Would you have rather had him there?'' asked Cole.
   ``Yes,'' Murphy said.
   Murphy acknowledged he is testifying under a grant of immunity
from prosecution, an agreement reached at the request of his
attorney.
   Murphy was not on board the tanker when it ran aground. At the
time, pilots _ local boat handlers familiar with coastal waters _
were required to guide outbound ships to a point just short of
Bligh Reef. The rules since have been changed to require pilots to
remain on board past the reef.

<HEAD>Newspaper Chain Sues to Depreciate Subscriber Lists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Newspaper subscription lists are depreciable
assets, attorneys for a newspaper company argued Monday in a case
that could affect how publications pay their taxes.
   Lawyers made opening statements in a lawsuit brought by the
Morning Ledger Co., a Newhouse family company that owns The
Star-Ledger of Newark.
   Morning Ledger sued the Internal Revenue Service after the
agency refused to allow the company to depreciate subscriber lists
for eight Michigan papers it acquired in 1987. The company would
decrease its taxable income by depreciating the lists.
   Morning Ledger paid $305 million for the papers, which had a
combined circulation of 460,000, the company's lawyers said.
   ``The issue in this case is whether the Morning Ledger can
depreciate, for tax purposes, certain assets of its business, and
those are the paid subscribers of the Booth Newspapers as of May
31st, 1977,'' said an attorney for Morning Ledger, Albert Turkus.
   The case is being heard by U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin in
a non-jury trial.
   Subscriber lists can be treated like tangible _ and hence
depreciable _ assets because they are used in the taxpayer's
business for a limited period of time and because they have
``ascertainable values separate and apart from goodwill,'' said
Turkus.
   But, countered a government attorney, the company ``has no
proprietary interest in the subscribers.
   ``These are at-will paying customers,'' said Gregory Hrebiniak,
a lawyer with the Justice Department's tax division.
   If the newspaper company is given the depreciation allowance,
any concern with paying customers could claim depreciation if they
isolate some and say they have a ``limited useful life,'' he said.
   A paper and its subscribers have a ``customer business
relationship, just as if they were selling peas.''
   The Michigan newspapers involved, formerly known as the Booth
Newspapers, are the Ann Arbor News, Bay City Times, Flint Journal,
Grand Rapids Press, Jackson Citizen, Jackson Citizen Patriot,
Kalamazoo Gazette, Muskegon Chronicle and Saginaw News.
   The trial is expected to end late this week.

<HEAD>P&amp;O Offers to Buy Rest of Laing Properties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co. PLC
on Monday offered to pay 441 million pounds ($745 million) for the
78.2 percent of Laing Properties PLC it doesn't already own.
   Laing rejected the offer, saying it significantly undervalued
Laing's assets and longer-term growth potential.
   P&amp;O, which has interests in passenger and cargo shipping, said
its offer for the remainder of the property investment and
development company came to 650 pence ($10.99) a share.
   Laing shares surged 89 pence ($1.50) to finish at 653 pence
($11.04) on London's Stock Exchange, still below P&amp;O's offer price.
   Chairman Sir Jeffrey Sterling said P&amp;O's board was seeking
discussions with the board of Laing Properties ``with a view to
obtaining their recommendation for the offer.''
   P&amp;O already holds 13.2 million Laing ordinary shares, a 21.8
percent stake. Sterling said the offer would give Laing
shareholders the opportunity to ``unlock value.''
   ``In common with most quoted property investment companies,
shareholders in Laing have generally seen their investment valued
in the market at a discount to the value of the underlying asset,''
he said.

<HEAD>EC Looking For Compromise With Japan On Car Trade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIPPE NEURAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European Community countries failed to
agree Monday on a proposal to Japan over the contentious issue of
phasing out restrictions on auto imports, officials said.
   Foreign ministers of the 12 EC nations met here to discuss the
issue, together with other foreign trade and policy problems.
   A spokesman for the European Commission, the community's
executive body, said, the discussions were ``encouraging'' and an
``undertstanding was found among all parties that a compromise must
be reached.''
   The foreign ministers have widely diverging views on the
troublesome issue. Some car-producing countries, like France, Italy
and Spain, have strict limitations on Japanese cars imports and
want them maintained. Others, like West Germany and Britain, have
taken a more liberal attitude.
   The European Commission recently proposed abolishing national
import quotas imposed by some countries and replacing them with a
community-wide quota over a transitional period, leading eventually
to the elimination of all import restrictions.
   The spokesman, who requested anonymity, said countries disagreed
on the length of the transitional period. Countries suggested
maintaining quotas for periods ranging from three to 10 years, he
said.
   The community wants to do away with the quotas as part of
efforts to create a single European market by the end of 1992. By
that date, the 12 nations have agreed to get rid of the many trade
barriers preventing the free flow of money, people, goods and
services.
   The EC would represent the world's single largest market for
cars while Japan is the world's biggest auto exporter.
   Frans Andriessen, the EC official in charge of negotiating with
Japan, asked the ministers for a clear position on the transitional
period and import restrictions.
   The countries have not yet agreed on whether trade negotiations
with Japan should be limited to cars or expanded to wide-ranging
discussions. The spokesman said the Commission was in favor of a
broad discussion.
   Andriessen told the ministers that Japan has a trade strategy
with the Common Market but the community has none in return.
   The foreign ministers will resume their discussions on Japanese
cars in March. A meeting with Japanese officials is scheduled in
June.

<HEAD>Rosenberg Named Clausen Successor at BankAmerica</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BankAmerica Corp. on Monday named its vice
chairman, Richard M. Rosenberg, president and heir apparent of the
giant banking company.
   In another indication of its sharp improvement in recent years,
BankAmerica also announced it was increasing its dividend 67
percent to 25 cents a share from 15 cents.
   Rosenberg, 59, will succeed A.W. ``Tom'' Clausen when he retires
as chairman and chief exectuive officer May 24 after heading a
healthy turnaround for the once-ailing company, the company said.
   ``The job I was called back to do, and which I came back to do,
is done,'' Clausen said in a statement. ``The recovery has been
accomplished. The turnaround has been completed.''
   The statement described Rosenberg as the architect of the bank's
profit resurgence in retail banking, real estate and commercial
banking in California.
   BankAmerica, parent of Bank of America, earned $1.1 billion in
1989, or $5.19 a share, the highest in its history. Fourth quarter
earnings of $270 million represented the 10th consecutive quarter
of improvement in the bank's operating income.
   ``Dick Rosenberg's record as a banker, a manager, and a leader
speaks so strongly for itself that little else needs to be said,''
Clausen said. ``He gives BankAmerica the unique combination of
strength, experience, innovation and inspiration that is critical
to its success in the constantly changing and increasingly
competitive marketplaces of the '90s.''
   Rosenberg was recruited by Clausen in 1987 from a job as
president of Seafirst Corp., Washington state's largest bank and a
wholly owned subsidiary of BankAmerica.
   The imminent departure by Clausen, 66, will mark the end of his
second tour as bank boss. He ended a 32-year career at the bank by
serving as president from 1970 to 1981. After a stint as head of
the World Bank in Washington, D.C., he returned to BankAmerica in
1986 at a time of big losses.
