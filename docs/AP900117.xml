   Vice President Dan Quayle will visit Panama,
Honduras and Jamaica this month, aides said Wednesday, but one
official said privately that other countries feeling resentment
about the U.S. invasion of Panama were discouraging Quayle visits
at this time.
   Quayle himself said that ``diplomatic sensitivities'' have held
up scheduling his trip to Central and South America. But he denied
any lingering ``deep resentment'' among Latin leaders after
President Bush's Dec. 20 invasion of Panama.
   ``No country has said, `We don't want the vice president,
period,''' he told a luncheon gathering of the Hoover Institution.
   However, Quayle later told a reporter, ``There are diplomatic
sensitivities. There's a matter of timing on when you go. There's a
matter of coordination. And these things have all got to be worked
out.''
   It is anticipated that Quayle, instead of actually visiting as
many of the countries as he originally might have, will meet with
many of their leaders when he attends presidential inaugurations in
Honduras on Jan. 27 and in Brazil and Chile in mid-March.
   His office on Wednesday announced he would go to Panama and
Jamaica in conjunction with the Honduras trip, and would make
``other stops to be determined'' on his March 10-16 South American
trip for the inaugurations.
   Many Latin officials have said opposition in their countries to
the U.S. military action is so strong that this would not be a good
time for Quayle to visit, especially while the U.S. combat troops
remain in Panama.
   One administration official, commenting only on condition of
anonymity, confirmed that some of the countries have passed along
to Quayle their reluctance to have him visit now.
   The official said that the nations have not indicated they would
reject Quayle indefinitely, just that this is a bad time.
   ``By the end of this thing in a couple months, we will have
talked to everyone,'' the official said.
   Venezuelan officials in Washington have told reporters they
would prefer that Quayle not visit, and the head of the country's
main opposition party, Eduardo Fernandez, said in Caracas on
Wednesday a visit ``would not be convenient.''
   Quayle aides Wednesday night declined to confirm or deny a
report in Thursday editions of The New York Times that Quayle had
dropped plans to stop in Venezuela and Mexico because of objections
from those countries.
   Bush said, in assigning Quayle to visit the region, that he
understood the sensitivities of the Latins to the U.S. military
action in their region and was sending Quayle to explain the action
was not taken lightly or without rationale.
   Asked if Bush had underestimated the depth of reaction to the
invasion, the official replied, ``Bush spotted the problem a lot
earlier than most.''
   Quayle, asked about the impact of the Panama action on his trip,
said of the Latin American leaders, ``I've talked to a number of
these people on the phone ... and I will be very surprised if I
find deep resentment.
   ''I do not believe that the heads of state are unhappy or
resentful of our actions in Panama. I think they understand it.
That's one of the reasons I'm going down, to find out what their
true feelings are.''
   Earlier, Quayle told the lunch group, ``My mission is not one to
apologize. It is not an effort to mend fences,'' but rather, he
said, to consult with the Latin leaders ``on how we make Panama a
successful democracy.''
   One Venezuelan official said that in addition to perceiving the
timing as a problem, many people in countries Quayle might visit
object to him as the messenger because of his conservatism and his
role as a principal cheerleader for the invasion.
   The Organization of American States voted to deplore the
military action and some Latin leaders have publicly viewed it as
trampling on Panama's sovereignty.
   Peru's president, Alan Garcia, is protesting by saying he won't
attend the upcoming drug summit in Colombia if U.S. invasion troops
remain in Panama. He is sending a lower ranking representative of
his government.
   Bush said Wednesday he wants to withdraw the invasion force from
Panama ``as soon as possible,'' but he feels under no pressure to
get them out before the Feb. 15 drug summit.
   Bush, in a photo session with Gen. Maxwell Thurman, the
commander of U.S. forces in Panama, congratulated Thurman and his
troops for ``the outstanding job they did for our country.''
   He denied, in response to a shouted question, any difficulties
finding countries willing to host Quayle in the region.

<HEAD>NASA Picks First Military Women As Astronaut Candidates</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three women from the military,
including a student test pilot expected to be the first female
space shuttle pilot, are among 23 people selected as astronaut
candidates, NASA announced Wednesday.
   It marked the first time that female military officers have been
tapped as astronaut candidates, although some have applied for the
position in the past, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said.
   The list also includes Los Angeles native Ellen Ochoa, the first
female Hispanic selection.
   The three military women are Air Force Maj. Eileen M. Collins,
the first woman to be named a shuttle pilot candidate, Air Force
Capt. Susan J. Helms of Charlotte, N.C., and Army Capt. Nancy J.
Sherlock of Wilmington, Del. Helms and Sherlock were chosen as
mission specialist candidates.
   Collins, an Elmira, N.Y., native who is a student test pilot at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., also may become the first female to
command a shuttle mission. Shuttle pilots usually fly once as the
pilot before being named commander of a flight.
   In all, seven pilot candidates and 16 mission specialists were
selected from a list of 1,945 qualified applications. Last fall,
106 applicants were interviewed by NASA.
   The 23 astronaut candidates will train for a year beginning in
July before they are given technical jobs that lead to assignments
on shuttle missions.
   The astronaut candidates include Ronald M. Sega, the husband of
astronaut Bonnie Dunbar _ a mission specialist aboard the current
Columbia flight. Sega, a Cleveland native who is now a professor at
the University of Houston, was named a mission specialist.
   The other shuttle pilot candidates and their hometowns are:
Kenneth D. Cockrell of Austin, Texas; Air Force Capt. William G.
Gregory of Lockport, N.Y.; Air Force Maj. James D. Halsell Jr. of
Monroe, La.; Air Force Maj. Charles J. Precourt of Waltham, Mass.;
Air Force Maj. Richard A. Searfoss of Mount Clemens, Mich.; and
Marine Corps Maj. Terrence W. Wilcutt of Russellville, Ky.
   The other mission specialists and their hometowns are: Navy Lt.
Cmdr. Daniel W. Bursch of Bristol, Pa.; Leroy Chiao of Milwaukee,
Wis.; Army Maj. Michael R.U. Clifford of Norton Air Force Base,
Calif.; Bernard A. Harris Jr. of Temple, Texas; Thomas D. Jones of
Baltimore, Md.; Army Maj. William S. McArthur Jr. of Laurinburg,
N.C.; James H. Newman of Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands;
Donald A. Thomas of Cleveland; Janice E. Voss of South Bend, Ind.;
Air Force Capt. Carl E. Walz of Cleveland; Peter J.K. Wisoff of
Norfolk, Va.; and David A. Wolf of Indianapolis.

<HEAD>Wave of Arrests of Roman Catholic Clergy Reported Continuing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese authorities have intensified their
suppression of the Roman Catholic Church, carrying out a ``wave of
arrests'' of clergy loyal to the pope, a church missionary bulletin
reports.
   Asia News, published by the Institute for Foreign Missions, said
the Chinese government ``has adopted a policy of hard repression of
all dissent, especially that of Catholics.''
   It identified some among those it said were recently arrested as
Pietro Liu Guandong; bishop of Yixian; Giuseppe Li Side, bishop of
Tianjian; Jiang Liren, bishop of Hohot; Mattia Lu Zhensheng, bishop
of Tianshui; Filippo Yang Lipo, bishop of Lanzhou; Paolo Li
Zhenrung, bishop of Xianxian; and Bartolomeo Yu Chengdi, bishop of
Hanzhong.
   About 20 priests, deacons and lay people have also been
arrested, Asia News said in Tuesday's report.
   China broke diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1957 and
allows worship only under the guise of the state-sponsored Chinese
Patriotic Catholic Church, which consecrates its own bishops.
   The church claims more than 3 million members, but an unknown
number of other Catholics remain secretly loyal to the pope.
   ``It is feared the wave of arrests could now extend to
Beijing,'' said Asia News, adding that the state-controlled church
is investigating to identify the places where the pro-Roman
Catholics celebrate their Masses in secret.
   ``The Patriotic Catholic Church seems to actively participate in
the repressive action, collaborating with the police,'' it said.
   The missionary organization said its Hong Kong office compiled
the information from sources in China and that all those arrested
had practiced their religion clandestinely.

<TEXT>
   A military surplus store owner is landing
new customers with big prices on big guns.
   Tim Carpenter is running advertisements in a weekly shopper that
tout rocket-propelled grenade launchers for $42,000 each, anti-tank
weapons for $39,000 and land mines for $6,000 a pop.
   The only thing is, none of them pop.
   Carpenter admits they're also overpriced. For example, he said,
an inoperable grenade launcher sells for about $2,000 at most
government auctions.
   ``If it wasn't a gimmick, I'd be arrested. I don't see how
anyone could take this seriously,'' said Carpenter, who bought the
Logan Square PX store in September. ``We've had better response
with this ad in a few hours than we've had in weeks with other
ads.''

   One year after shots from a
semiautomatic weapon shattered playtime and childhood innocence at
an elementary school, campus life appears to have returned to
normal, but fragile immigrant families are still healing.
   The shootings helped lead to the nation's first and only
statewide ban on the sale of assault weapons.
   The buildings at Cleveland Elementary have been painted and the
blacktop repaved, covering the bullet holes and blood stains where
five children died and 29 other children and one teacher were
injured.
   Behind the school, two boys dribble a basketball up the steps of
a classroom building near where on Jan. 17, 1989, 24-year-old
drifter Patrick Purdy fired 105 rounds from his AK-47 assault
rifle, then used a handgun to kill himself.
   But while the campus is free of noticeable scars, the students
and teachers are not. Some still carry bullet fragments inside
their bodies, and the wounded teacher limps from a bullet-shattered
knee. About 100 children still attend weekly group therapy
sessions. Many teachers also receive counseling.
   ``The kinds of things the kids are expressing are still some
fears of strangers, fears of loud noises, difficulty sleeping and
nightmares,'' said Roger Speed, program chief for San Joaquin
County Mental Health Services.
   Those symptoms are some of the same as for post-traumatic stress
disorder, a chronic ailment suffered by some Vietnam War veterans,
war survivors and victims of rape and torture.
   ``It remains to be seen whether these children are going to have
a chronic problem or not,'' Speed said. ``We don't know. Only time
will tell.''
   School and county mental health authorities initiated counseling
for students and staff immediately after the shooting, with hopes
of aiding the healing process and preventing problems later on.
   ``But mental health therapy is not a miracle,'' Speed said.
``It's not something that solves everyone's problems. ... We can't
guarantee that all of these kids are going to be problem-free.''
   For many of the children, the shooting was the latest in a
series of tragedies to befall their families. About 60 percent of
Cleveland Elementary's 1,000 pupils are from Southeast Asian
refugee families, many of them already traumatized by war.
   The five children who died by Purdy's bullets were of Southeast
Asian descent, four Cambodian and one Vietnamese. An official
report described Purdy as emotionally disturbed and full of racial
hatred.
   The father of slain Ram Chun, 8, frequently cries out for his
dead daughter, sometimes talking of suicide and occasionally
requiring hospitalization. The girl's 16-year-old brother ran away
from home last April after being hospitalized for an emotional
breakdown. The father of slain Sokhim An, 6, has difficulty
sleeping and worries about the safety of his four other children.
   Speed said the county's transcultural mental health clinic has
seen its clientele double from 450 last year to nearly 900.
   ``I can't say each one of those is directly related to the
Cleveland School incident,'' he said. ``But these are all Southeast
Asian folks. I know they're all aware of the shooting. I think it
affects their anxiety about being separate from the community.''
   A two-week teachers' strike over pay issues that threatened to
continue through the anniversary of the shooting created confusion
for many families, officials said. The walkout ended Monday night.
   Therapists also worried that widespread media attention to the
anniversary could reopen psychological wounds. The attention,
however, also has affected society.
   Last May, in the wake of the Stockton shooting and escalating
street gang violence, the California Legislature passed the
nation's first and only statewide ban on the sale of assault
weapons.
   The wounded teacher, Janet Geng, has returned to teaching and
become an outspoken advocate of nationwide gun control.
   Boon Khoonsrivong, director of Lao Kmu Association Refugee
Resource Center, said community support after the shooting helped
overcome some cultural barriers between Southeast Asian immigrants
and other ethnic groups.
   ``I think at first they thought that the thing was going to
happen again, that it might be discrimination, but after that they
could see that a lot of people are concerned, the community is
concerned about them and is doing something good about them,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   The overthrow of Nicolae Ceausescu may
herald the return of freedom in Romania, but many of this
Transylvanian village's 2,200 laborers say their store shelves
remain bare and leaders are still corrupt.
   ``Nothing has changed,'' says Vasile Grota, who works on an
assembly line in a leather factory. ``We still have little to eat,
and the family is often cold.''
   Mayor Virgil Cernusca and other newly installed community
figures depicted villagers as generally content with their lot in
the wake of the revolution and with the local officials now leading
them.
   But complaints by Grota and others in Poplaca, about three miles
outside of the regional capital of Sibiu and 100 miles northwest of
Bucharest, indicated that ordinary folk feel the revolution has
left them in the lurch.
   They believe that Ceausescu's energy and food rationing should
be just a bad memory, banished with the toppling and execution of
the Stalinist dictator and his wife, and the plans to create a
Western-style democracy.
   A month after the popular uprising, however, fuel for the tile
stoves in Poplaca's modest houses is just as scarce as in the old
days, even though rationing officially has ended. Yards are bare
except for a scrawny chicken or two scratching the frozen earth,
and the little food on display in the community grocery store
strains small budgets to the limit.
   As in other villages, overt Ceausescu loyalists have been
replaced by new community leaders.
   But angry villagers complain that appointments had been made
from above _ by the region's provisional government in Sibiu _ and
they had no say in the selection, just like under Ceausescu. So,
they remain distrustful of the new officials.
   ``These are not our people,'' said Maria Luca, shaking her head
wrapped in a black shawl. ``We didn't put them in office, they
chose themselves.''
   Many said the workplace also has changed little from the days
when Communist Party appointees milked state farms and factories
for personal gain.
   ``They made themselves millionaires but didn't give anything to
the workers,'' said Grota, 59.
   His voice rising indignantly, Grota said the director of his
enterprise had not been replaced even though he had taken $10,000
in a production bonus last year. ``And we got nothing,'' Grota said.
   The haggard man wearing torn shirt and trousers, his face
blackened by soot from a futile attempt to light his wood stove,
wept as he aired old frustrations and new disappointments at a
table crowding one of two dingy rooms he shares with his wife and
infant daughter.
   ``I had a yard full of animals,'' Grota sobbed, relating the
evils of Ceausescu's 24-year tenure. ``They took them all away from
me, and now I have trouble finding the 14 lei ($1.50) to buy milk
for my girl.''
   And the new leaders are no different, he charged.
   ``What have I gotten in return since the revolution? Two kilos
(4.4 pounds) of wheat, and I don't have wood for the winter because
I don't have enough money.''
   Grota waved in resignation when asked about village leaders.
   ``These are still Ceausescu's people,'' he said.
   ``They've got to change all of them, even the teachers,'' he
said, saying they had twisted children's minds with the dictator's
vision of a socalist Romania.
   Luca, Grota's neighbor, added her voice to complaints about
factory officials.
   ``I also want to change all the leaders of our collective
because they were part of the old order, the bad ones,'' she said,
suggesting that some held on to good jobs despite being in the pay
of Securitate _ Ceausescu's feared special police _ less than a
month ago.
   As the two spoke, about 30 villagers gathered in front of
Grota's hovel and around the all-terrain vehicle formerly owned by
the Ceausescus and now used by the local provisional government to
transport foreign guests around the region.
   Many had marched the night before to express their general
discontent with the course of the revolution.
   ``Give us new leaders!'' some of them shouted, as the Western
visitors emerged. ``We don't have enough food.''

<HEAD>Monet Cookery Notebooks Reveal Tyrannical Gourmet</HEAD>

   The publication of Claude Monet's cookery notebooks
reveals the father of Impressionism as a tyrannical gourmet who
could fly into a rage over a sauce.
   ``Monet's Cookery Notebooks,'' by Claire Joyes and published
recently by Editions du Chene, is a delightful look at the private
life of the man who immortalized haystacks in the haze and water
lilies floating under a quaint Japanese footbridge.
   The book is to be published in the United States in the spring
by Prentice Hall.
   A must for art buffs and food lovers alike, Monet's cookbook _
with recipes tested and adapted by award-winning chef Joel Robuchon
_ is an authentic record taken from family notes.
   Like a social and cultural chronicle of the half century Monet
spent at his Normandy country home in Giverny from 1883 to 1926,
the notebooks detail Monet's likes and dislikes, what he served to
his friends and what his second wife Alice had prepared for their
eight children (two were his, six were hers) on ordinary days and
holidays. It even tells how tables were set for picnics.
   Joyes, an art historian, found the handwritten notebooks tucked
among letters, photographs and other Monet archives inherited by
her husband, Jean-Marie Toulgouat, a great-grandson of Alice
Hoschede Monet.
   ``Claire was the storyteller, Jean-Marie had the memory,'' said
Benedicte Servignat, Joyes' editor at Chene. ``He never knew Monet,
but he spent all his childhood vacations at the Giverny farmhouse
and remembered the cook Marguerite and, of course, Monet's
step-daughter Blanche, who carried on all the culinary traditions
after Monet's death.''
   Toulgouat, an artist, and Joyes live in the village of Giverny,
near Vernon, but have nothing to do with Monet's renovated
farmhouse, now open to the public as a museum.
   Monet was a solid, middle-class bon vivant, but his daily
routine was strictly regimented and it revolved totally around
painting.
   He rose before dawn to capture the variations of early morning
light, took a cold shower and breakfasted English-style _ on eggs
and bacon, grilled tripe sausages and cheese, toast and orange
marmelade.
   He would spend the morning working on his studio-boat with
Blanche, also an artist. Back by 11 a.m., they were ravenous and
impatient to sit down to lunch.
   Joyes decribed Monet as ``a demon for punctuality. A first, then
a second stroke of the gong would assemble the scattered family in
the dining room for lunch, which was served at 11:30 precisely.
Monet would cough irritably on the very half second, causing panic
in the kitchen,'' she wrote.
   Lunch invariably was a five-course extravaganza, which included
a fish course, meat dish, salad, cheese, a different homebaked
dessert every day and cakes at 4 p.m. _ all prepared by the family
cook Marguerite.
   Monet never lingered over his food. Service had to be quick so
he could get back to work. He even ordered servants never to pass
dishes around twice when his American stepson-in-law Theodore
Butler was lunching with them since Butler's slow eating habits
drove Monet mad.
   Lunch was a social affair, often with guests. Tea was served
under the lime trees, always at 4:00. Friends were never invited
for dinner because Monet was always in bed by 9:30. The uninvited,
even close friends, were politely turned away.
   Though Alice ran the house, she consulted Monet in planning
menus, which revolved around the fruit and vegetables in season and
which catered to the special tastes of a roster of illustrious
guests like Renoir, Cezanne and Premier Georges Clemenceau, who
loved the waterlilies.
   Monet and his family arrived in Giverny in May in 1883. Despite
their precarious financial situation, they immediately set about
renovating the kitchen and landscaping the wild gardens which
sloped gently down to wide meadows and a small pond.
   Monet was obssessed with order in his flower gardens, but he was
fanatical about the picking schedule of his fruit and vegetables
grown and nurtured in a 2{-acre walled kitchen garden on the other
side of the town.
   Constantly looking to expand and improve an impressive array of
herbs and vegetables, he would spend evenings leafing through
scholarly publications to find new seeds to test in the rich and
often wet Norman soil.
   Joyes described Monet as equally fanatical about the poultry he
was served, spending an ``inordinate amount of time choosing ducks
and hens to be used for breeding stock.'' He just didn't trust
local farmers.

   With China's best-known dissidents jailed, exiled
or in hiding, a popular folk singer is trying to fill the void with
protest songs and calls for democracy.
   ``You could say I'm the world's stupidest, most amateur
dissident,'' said Hou Dejian, laughing and shaking his head in mock
self-ridicule.
   ``I'm not a politician. I had friends who were dissidents, but .
.. I'm a professional musician,'' he said, with elaborate emphasis.
``But right now, I'm trying to figure out how to become a passable
dissident.''
   Hou, 33, is no ordinary mainland musician: he is the
Taiwanese-born son of a Nationalist soldier who fought against the
Communists. Seeking his roots, Hou visited the Communist mainland
as an established star in 1983 and decided to stay.
   The darling of the government, he was allowed to keep living
like a star, with two homes and two cars, one a maroon Mercedes
Benz.
   The skinny, chain-smoking Hou, usually clad in black leather
jacket and boots, is famous among Chinese on the mainland, Taiwan
and Hong Kong for his Bob Dylan-influenced songs about social
concerns, such as the endangered pandas, and about the worries of
youth.
   But he became known to Westerners when, in the final days of
China's student democracy movement last spring, he and three
friends began a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square to protest
martial law. Many students were already leaving the square out of
fear, and the hunger strike infused the movement with new spirit.
   Less than 48 hours later, on June 4, with tanks poised on the
square's edge, Hou negotiated with the army to allow the remaining
students to retreat peacefully, possibly saving hundreds of lives.
   Now, he is again trying to keep the spirit of democracy alive,
taking advantage of his relative freedom as a defector.
   ``I can say more than ordinary Chinese,'' Hou said. So he has
begun ``making a little noise,'' giving interviews to foreign
journalists and singing for them the half-dozen songs he has
written about the democracy movement, songs he knows no mainland
company can record now.
   ``Friends who love freedom, spread our wings,'' one ballad goes.
``Listen carefully, no one can lie again. Open your eyes, no one
can twist the truth again.''
   Hou has not worked out any philosophy of government or theories
about the relative merits of Communism and capitalism. ``I'm not a
political scientist. I say, ask all the Chinese people and then
decide.''
   All he wants is provide an alternative to the Communist Party
voice that has filled the airwaves and newspapers since June with
relentless condemnation of the democracy movement.
   ``Because you can't hear other voices that doesn't mean there's
stability,'' he said, choosing words carefully while he picked out
chords on his electric guitar.
   ``We have an ancient tyrant culture. A real change would mean
changing the slaves, not changing the tyrant. Although it's been
slow, there is change. Most people in Beijing took part in the
movement and ... they are not as afraid as before.''
   Hou said the movement wiped away his feeling of being an
outsider on the mainland.
   That is why during the summer, when he hid from police for more
than two months in the Australian Embassy, he did not apply for
asylum. He came out Aug. 15, as soon as the Foreign Ministry
promised he would not be arrested or deported.
   Some Chinese suspected a deal when he told government television
two days later that he did not see anyone killed in Tiananmen
Square during the June 3-4 army attack. Authorities insist no one
died in the square, while acknowledging about 300 deaths elsewhere
in the city.
   But Hou said he made no deal. ``I can only say I didn't see
anyone die. That doesn't prove no one died.''
   Two of the three friends who went on the hunger strike with Hou
remain jailed. One was freed in December.
   Hou was tailed by police for a while and has not been allowed so
far to travel inside China or to Australia, where his wife, pop
singer Cheng Lin, fled in June.
   But his main punishment has been loss of his career. Stores have
been told not to sell his records, and he cannot sing his new songs
in public. Hou said he has no interest in singing the old ones.
   He has begun selling his music equipment for money. ``I had a
lot of money but I spent a lot,'' he said with a grin. ``I don't
save.'' Nonetheless, he has turned his three-room Beijing apartment
into a hostel for friends fired because they protested, and gives
money to other former protesters who seek help.
   ``I don't like being a dissident _ I can't stand it,'' Hou said,
self-mocking again. He remembered Fang Lizhi, China's most famous
dissident, who has been hiding in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing since
June.
   ``Maybe when Fang Lizhi comes out he can continue his dissidence
and I can go back to being a musician.''

<TEXT>
   Several U.S. airlines said Tuesday they were raising air fares
again to offset jet fuel costs, the second such hike in two weeks
by major carriers, and one of the airlines announced a fuel
surcharge.
   United Airlines, USAir and Northwest Airlines said they planned
to increase by 10 percent selected one-way discount fares often
used by business travelers.
   American, which on Monday confirmed plans for a 10 percent hike
on similar fares, also plans to add a $6 one-way fuel surcharge
effective Feb. 9 on all tickets.
   In addition, United, American and Northwest are adding a
three-day advance purchase requirement, and USAir a seven-day
advance purchase rule, for one-way discount fares that now don't
require advance purchase.
   The changes are effective Jan. 24 for Northwest and Feb. 1 for
American and USAir.
   Under American's changes, an unrestricted one-way fare between
Chicago and Dallas, which was $314 on Jan. 1, increased to $327 on
Jan. 11 and would go to $360 on Feb. 1, when it must be purchased
three days in advance. Another $6 would be added on Feb. 9.
   Spokesmen for Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Eastern
Airlines said those carriers are studying the 10 percent fare hike.
   Earlier this month, industry leader American and other big U.S.
airlines raised fares by 4 percent to help pay fuel costs while
Northwest and others imposed a special fuel surcharge, the first
such charge since the 1970s oil crisis. The 4 percent hike took
effect on one-way tickets last Thursday, and also will apply to
round-trip tickets starting Feb. 1, said Mary O'Neill, a
spokeswoman for American in Fort Worth, Texas.
   She also said American plans a fuel surcharge of $6 one way and
$12 round trip on all tickets, effective Feb. 9.
   Northwest previously planned a $6-$12 surcharge also to take
effect Feb. 9. USAir spokeswoman Susan Young said a surcharge was
under review.
   ``All these actions are very much related to the skyrocketing
fuel costs that we are seeing,'' said Al Becker, a spokesman for
American.
   He said the price American pays for jet fuel has jumped from an
average 58 cents a gallon at the beginning of 1989 to around 96
cents as oil prices have surged. Jet fuel generally represents
around 35 percent of an airline's operating budget.
   The fuel surcharges do not require government approval for
domestic flights. Most of the airlines imposing them earlier this
month said they have sought permission from foreign governments to
apply them to international flights.
   Last week, American and United also raised most of their cargo
rates to help offset fuel costs.

<TEXT>
   Gaston County is due for a baby boom in
June and early July _ about nine months after Hurricane Hugo hit,
doctors say.
   The storm knocked out power and essentially shut down the county
when it struck in September.
   ``Any time there is a natural disaster or snowstorm or anything
that keeps people at their homes, this happens,'' said Deborah
Hudson, business manager for Gaston Gynecology and Obstetrics, one
of two prenatal centers in the county.
   By mid-January, the center already surpassed the number of new
patients that showed up in December. Ms. Hudson expects to have 90
to 100 new patients this month, compared with about 50 for a normal
January. Many of the expecting mothers are due in early summer.
   ``That's a pretty good indication that Hugo had something to do
with it,'' she said.
   At Gastonia Women's Clinic, the county's other prenatal care
center, Dr. Joseph Holman said, ``As soon as Hugo hit, we all joked
about it.''

<HEAD>Congressman Says Drug Law Would be ``Horrible Invasion'' of Rights</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate bill to establish federal
drug-testing standards for private companies is coming under fire
from the chairman of a House panel as ``a horrible invasion of
Americans' rights.''
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights, said Tuesday the
measure would encourage drug testing that is ``terribly expensive
and doesn't do any good.''
   The bill might have support when Congress returns next week,
Edwards said, ``with the drug hysteria that is being fanned by
President Bush and his hard-line macho approach almost daily.''
   Meanwhile, mandatory random testing for drugs and alcohol went
into effect Tuesday for the 90,000 men and women who operate the
nation's railroads.
   The bill by Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and David Boren, D-Okla.,
would not require businesses to test employees but give them the
clear right to do so _ a provision supporters said would prevent
unwarranted court challenges to drug-testing policies.
   Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, endorsing the bill, said
court challenges discourage companies from implementing
drug-testing programs. He said such testing deters workers from
using alcohol and drugs on the job.
   Hatch said the measure would protect privacy rights by
establishing guidelines for circumstances under which businesses
can test their workers.
   Under the measure, drug and alcohol tests would have to be
analyzed at a federally certified lab. Tests could be conducted
before workers are hired, during annual physical exams and any time
for workers who had gone through a drug rehabilitation program.
   Random testing could be conducted only for ``sensitive''
employees, or workers who the employer says deal with matters
connected to national security, health or safety, the environment
or require ``a high degree of trust and confidence.''
   The American Civil Liberties Union considers the guidelines
vague and too broad, said the group's legislative representative,
Gene Guerrero.
   The ACLU also opposes the measure because it would preempt state
laws that do more to protect workers, Guerrero said. Sixteen states
now have drug-testing laws, and several of those laws are more
protective of workers' privacy rights than the Hatch-Boren measure,
he said.
   The railroad drug and alcohol testing began one year after drug
abuse was singled out as a factor in a 1987 Amtrak-Conrail crash
near Baltimore that killed 16 people and injured 175.
   The testing program, delayed because a lengthy series of court
battles between the government and railroad unions, requires that
at least 25 percent of railroad engineers, brakemen, dispatchers,
signalmen, conductors and all other railroad employees directly
involved in the movement of trains be subjected to random testing
this year.
   Half of the operations personnel of the nation's largest
railroads must be tested by the end of 1991 for the presence of
alcohol and such drugs as marijuana, cocaine, opiates,
amphetamines, and phencyclidine, also known as PCP.

<TEXT>
   Composer Jeff Alexander, whose scores for more
than 40 movies and dozens of radio and television shows included
the memorable melody from ``The Twilight Zone,'' has died at age 79.
   Alexander, who died of cancer Dec. 23, wrote the scores for
several Elvis Presley movies, including ``Jailhouse Rock,'' and
such musicals as ``Singin' in the Rain,'' ``Kismet,'' ``Seven
Brides for Seven Brothers'' and ``Gigi.''
   The composer, who lived on Whidbey Island northwest of Seattle,
was reworking his musical, ``The Children's Crusade,'' at the time
of his death. He had begun work on the show in 1975 with
collaborators Yip Harburg and Larry Orenstein.
   He was one of the founders of the Screen Composer Guild, and
served two terms on the board of governors of the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences.
   The Seattle native began his career in his early teens when he
sang and danced on the vaudeville circuit. By his late teens, he
was producing musical arrangements for several big bands.
   Alexander's first feature film arrangement was for the 1937
movie ``Shall We Dance.''
   In addition to the ``Twilight Zone,'' his TV credits included
the scores for the ``Jimmy Stewart Show,'' ``Dr. Kildare'' and ``My
Three Sons.''
   Alexander returned to Washington state in 1980 when he retired
from films and television to compose chamber pieces and a symphony.
   He is survived by a daughter, Jill Alexander, of San Francisco.

<HEAD>Broken Budgets Top State Legislative Agendas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Dozens of state legislatures are in the position of a
supermarket shopper with a full cart and an empty wallet.
   Declining tax revenues have made budget problems the top issue
facing at least 20 states this year _ and among the major issues in
most other states _ even as they are pressed by such weighty
matters as abortion, drug abuse, education and the environment.
   All but a few smaller states will hold 1990 legislative
sessions, most beginning this month or next.
   Some states, particularly in the Northwest, have managed to
avoid fiscal pitfalls, but most have fallen victim to an unexpected
plunge in tax revenues.
   The most desperate states are in the Northeast, where lawmakers
are trying to bail out of potential deficits that include $1.5
billion in New York, $500 million in Massachusetts, $400 million in
Connecticut, $80 million in New Hampshire, $67 million in Maine and
$30 million in Maryland.
   Notheastern governors have proposed: raising taxes in
Massachusetts, canceling a tax cut in New York, raising ``sin
taxes'' in New Hampshire and imposing a junk food ``snack tax'' in
Maryland.
   ``The Northeast is far and away in the worst shape of any
region,'' said Marcia Howard, research director for the National
Association of State Budget Officers. ``I can't think of another
state that is in as bad shape as any of the states in New England.''
   Ms. Howard puts the blame on sluggish corporate profits that
produced lower-than-expected corporate income tax revenues. ``I
think the states that have the biggest problems are the states that
rely most heavily on that tax,'' she said.
   Midwestern states generally have coped with the downturn, she
said, because their expectations ``are so low that it's not
difficult to meet them.'' Still, some states are having problems.
Missouri's Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, Roger Wilson,
has warned agencies to decide ``who gets into the lifeboat first.''
   Most Southern states have taken in as much income as they
expected, Ms. Howard said. But that doesn't mean they're wealthy.
Louisiana is still slipping on lost oil revenues, and Hurricane
Hugo blew away any hope of budget surpluses in the Carolinas.
   ``I think if `no frills' has ever been identified with a budget,
it will be this year,'' said South Carolina state Rep. James W.
Johnson Jr. ``I think we are going to do well to tread water and
stay where we are.''
   California's budget was shaken up by the Bay area earthquake,
but several other Western states are in decent shape. Legislators
in Washington and Utah face the pleasant task of deciding what to
do with extra money.
   Perhaps the least pleasant task awaiting legislators this year
is deciding whether to adopt more stringent abortion regulations.
Nearly every legislature will have to confront what Alabama state
Sen. Chip Bailey calls ``the most controversial issue any
legislature will deal with in the next decade.''
   Drug abuse is another high-profile dilemma that is expected to
be a major issue in more than a dozen states.
   In Georgia, Democratic House leaders have prepared a package of
more than 40 bills for what they call a ``Death on Drugs
Campaign,'' ranging from increased penalties for drug traffickers
to improved anti-drug educational programs. Republicans and
Democratic Gov. Joe Frank Harris are proposing their own anti-drug
packages.
   Several states, including Alabama, New York and Rhode Island,
are considering proposals to suspend the driver's licenses of
convicted drug users. ``People seem to cherish their driver's
license, and I think that would be an effective penalty,'' Rhode
Island Gov. Edward DiPrete said.
   Finances, abortion and drugs are issues that transcend local and
regional boundaries, but many of the issues facing legislatures are
more parochial.
   The big issue in Delaware is providing paramedic service to two
counties that aren't already served. In Arizona, lawmakers are
squabbling over the Martin Luther King holiday. In Illinois, it's a
proposal to legalize Mississippi riverboat gambling to pay
education bills _ what state Rep. E.J. ``Zeke'' Giorgi calls ``a
conspicuous good use of bad money.''
   And in New Jersey and neighboring Pennsylvania, no issue is
getting more attention than high auto insurance rates. That
prompted Stephen MacNett, chief counsel to Pennsylvania's Senate
Republicans, to ask: ``Is there any other issue?''

<HEAD>ABC's `Roseanne' Back in First Place</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' is back on top of the
television ratings in a week in which comedies dominated the
Nielsen survey.
   Eight half-hour comedies were in the top 10. They were joined by
CBS' ``60 Minutes'' and its post-game show after Sunday's National
Football League championship playoff.
   ``Roseanne'' pushed ahead of NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and
``Cheers'' to take first place. ``Cosby'' was second and ``Cheers''
third for the week ended Jan. 14.
   NBC had a commanding lead among the networks and CBS narrowly
kept its second place position over ABC in the A.C. Nielsen Co.
survey. The ratings: NBC 15.4, CBS 13.4 and ABC 13.2. Each point
represents the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million television
homes tuned to a show.
   NBC leads the season with 14.8 to ABC's 12.9 and CBS' 12.2.
   CBS' coverage of the football game between the Los Angeles Rams
and San Francisco 49ers was listed as the top prime-time show by
NBC and CBS in their version of the ratings. A portion of the game
ran into prime time, but this is not counted in the official
Nielsen list. San Francisco's victory in the game advanced the
49ers to the Super Bowl.
   The post-game show, however, is on the Nielsen list and tied for
seventh place with NBC's ``Empty Nest.''
   Here's the top 10: ABC's ``Roseanne''; NBC's ``The Cosby Show,''
``Cheers,'' ``A Different World'' and ``The Golden Girls''; CBS'
``60 Minutes''; CBS' post-game NFL show and NBC's ``Empty Nest''
tied; NBC's ``Dear John'' and ABC's ``The Wonder Years.''
   Eleventh place went to ABC's ``Coach,'' which is doing better on
Tuesday night behind ``Roseanne'' than the canceled ``Chicken
Soup.''
   Two CBS Monday night shows, perhaps aided by the end of the
season for ABC's Monday Night Football or by the baby boom, placed
high in the ratings. ``Newhart'' and ``Designing Women'' were in a
three-way tie for 13th place with NBC's ``L.A. Law.'' Stephanie had
her baby on the ``Newhart'' episode, and the week before
``Designing Women'' was 10th for its one-hour special on the birth
of Charlene's baby.
   The rest of the CBS Monday shows didn't do as well. ``Murphy
Brown'' was 20th, ``Major Dad'' was 35th and ``Doctor, Doctor'' was
43rd. Another, ``The Famous Teddy Z,'' was 57th and is being
replaced by Valerie Harper in ``City.''
   ABC regained first place among news shows, replacing CBS, which
fell from first to third. The ratings: ABC 11.9, NBC 10.9, CBS 10.8.
   The lowest-rated network show was CBS' ``Tour of Duty.''

<BYLINE>Mexicans to U.S.: What Have You Done About Drugs?
^By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top U.S. and Mexican officials maintain
anti-drug cooperation between the nations has never been better,
but many Mexicans are still angry over their country's bad image in
a TV miniseries on the slaying of an American drug agent.
   The Consejo Nacional de la Publicidad, the National Advertising
Council, took out full-page ads in three major U.S. newspapers on
Tuesday to outline Mexico's anti-drug efforts and to ask, ``What
have you done in the U.S.A.?''
   The miniseries on the kidnapping, torture and murder of Drug
Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena in 1985 and the
subsequent cover-up by Mexican officials _ called ``Drug Wars: The
Camarena Story'' _ aired Jan. 7, 8 and 9 on NBC-TV. It generated a
great deal of controversy in Mexico.
   ``I think it's obvious that the Mexicans were deeply chagrined
by the NBC series,'' one Bush administration official said on
condition of anonymity.
   The newspaper ads read, ``In Mexico we say: No a las Drogas!,''
which means ``No to drugs.'' They recount drug seizures,
destruction of poppy and marijuana fields, arrests and sentences of
drug-related criminals and the killing of 41 public servants in the
line of duty.
   They conclude, ``And meanwhile, what have you done in the
U.S.A.?''
   ``We ran this advertisement in The Washington Post, The New York
Times and The Los Angeles Times in reaction to a certain television
miniseries because we wanted to rectify the damage that could have
been done to Mexico's image,'' said Dionisio Ascobereta, director
general of the Consejo Nacional de la Publicidad, the National
Advertising Council.
   The council, a nonprofit organization made up of about 60
advertising agencies, is separate from the government, Ascobereta
said in a telephone interview from Mexico City.
   The council has participated in public service campaigns in
Mexico to prevent drug abuse and drunken driving and keep the
streets clean.
   According to rates quoted by representatives of the three
papers, the ads cost a total of about $124,340 to run.
   ``There's been a strong reaction by the Mexican government to
the miniseries,'' DEA spokesman Frank Shults said Tuesday, adding
it ``hasn't had any negative impact on our ability to conduct our
international program with Mexico, at least not to my knowledge.''
   Acting Deputy DEA Administrator Terrence Burke was in Mexico
last week and ``had very productive meetings'' with people in the
Mexican attorney general's office, Shults said.
   Fernando Arias, chief spokesman for Mexican Attorney General
Enrique Alvarez del Castillo, said last Friday, ``Now, more than
ever, the relationship between our nations is friendly,
particularly among those dedicated to fighting drug trafficking.''
   The events in the miniseries occurred during the previous
administration in Mexico. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who
took office in December 1988, has cracked down on drug trafficking
and corruption.
   But Mexican Embassy officials strongly criticized the show and
NBC News segments that accompanied the broadcasts, contending they
were inaccurate and unfairly depicted widespread corruption among
Mexican authorities.
   Lloyd Siegel, executive producer for special broadcasts at NBC
News, said Mexican Embassy officials refused invitations to appear
on the discussion panels.
   ``We do not accept the charge that there were any inaccuracies
or inconsistencies'' in the reporting, Siegel said last week.
   Last Friday, the government newspaper El Nacional published a
front-page story accusing Camarena of being corrupt _ allegations
heatedly denied by U.S. officials.
   ``There is not a scintilla of evidence whatsoever that Enrique
Camarena was involved with the traffickers in any way other than an
adversarial role,'' Shults said when that story appeared.
   Camarena, 37, was kidnapped Feb. 7, 1985, in Guadalajara,
Mexico. His Mexican pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avalar, was kidnapped a
few days later. Their bullet-riddled bodies, showing signs of
torture, were found March 5, 1985, wrapped in plastic bags and
buried in shallow graves on a ranch 60 miles southeast of
Guadalajara.
   Drug traffickers Rafael Caro Quintero, 37; Ernesto Rafael
Fonseca Carillo, 56; and 10 other men have been prosecuted and
sentenced in Mexico for the killings. But U.S. officials believe
some higher-level Mexican authorities were involved in protecting
the drug traffickers and helping cover up the crime.

<HEAD>``CBS Evening News'' Third in Ratings by Narrow Margin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' regained its
winning ways in weekly ratings, but Dan Rather's once-dominant
``CBS Evening News'' was third in ratings last week, A.C. Nielsen
Co. audience estimates show.
   ABC's newscast, anchored by Peter Jennings, easily won the week
ending Jan. 14 with a ratings average of 11.9. It was the 12th time
this season the program has triumphed over CBS's newscast,
according to an ABC spokesman. The previous week, CBS was on top.
   Tom Brokaw's ``NBC Nightly News,'' which has been in third
place, was second in ratings last week with a 10.9 average.
Rather's newscast was third by a narrow margin of one-tenth of a
point.
   Each point represents 921,000 homes.
   Last week, one major CBS affiliate, KPIX-TV in San Francisco,
shifted Rather's program to an earlier 5:30 p.m. PST start time.
   But it isn't known yet if that was a factor in the week's
Nielsen returns for the program, said Michael Eisenberg, CBS vice
president for audience measurement.
   ``We couldn't point to that as the only reason right now,'' he
said Tuesday. ``We're studying the matter and trying to find out
what the reasons are.''
   At a news conference in Los Angeles during the weekend, Rather
and CBS News president David Burke said they were unable to explain
the ratings slide.
   But each discounted speculation that some of it was due to
Rather's much-publicized on-air confrontation with then GOP
presidential candidate George Bush during a ``CBS Evening News''
interview in early 1988.
   Burke blamed part of the ratings problems on what he called
statistical errors in the Nielsen ratings system and on the
programs of other broadcast outlets such as the 24-hour Cable News
Network.
   ``There is increasing competition from CNN, which means you
don't have to make an appointment to watch the news anymore, you
have it on all the time, and I think they do a fine job,'' he said.

   Japanese movie star Shintaro Katsu was arrested
and pleaded guilty to drug charges after cocaine and marijuana were
found in his underwear upon his arrival Tuesday at Honolulu
International Airport, officials said.
   The 58-year-old actor, whose real name is Toshio Okumura, was
fined $1,000 plus $350 in court costs after pleading guilty to
misdemeanor possession of 1.75 grams of cocaine, said Elliott
Enoki, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office.
   In return for his guilty plea on the cocaine charge, prosecutors
dropped charges of possession and importation of 9.75 grams of
marijuana, Enoki said.
   Enoki said the drugs were found in Katsu's underwear, but would
not elaborate on what led authorities to search his clothing.
   After the guilty plea, officials with the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service detained Katsu for possible deportation.
   His attorney, James Koshiba, said Katsu was released on ``a
couple of thousand dollars'' bail pending a hearing, for which no
date was set.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Will Decide on Children's Testimony in Abuse Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Idaho Attorney General Jim Jones says the
Supreme Court now has a chance to correct ``a travesty of justice
that silences some of our tiniest sex abuse victims while
benefitting their molesters.''
   Jones' strong reaction came after the court said Tuesday it will
use cases from Maryland and Idaho to decide whether children may be
forced to have face-to-face meetings with the adults charged with
abusing them.
   Courts in both states threw out child-abuse convictions because
defendants were not given a chance for such confrontations.
   Jones said those decisions pose ``an unacceptable roadblock to
prosecution of child molesters,'' adding, ``Many sex abuse
prosecutions can't be pursued without the use of incriminating
statements made by young sex abuse victims.''
   Many states in recent years have taken steps to protect young
crime victims, such as allowing a child to testify by
closed-circuit television rather than in the presence of the
defendant.
   The court's decisions, expected by July, could spell out what
steps are necessary to meet the constitutional requirement that
``in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right
... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.''
   Maryland Attorney General Joseph Curran said, ``This is a
crucial case for the protection of the most vulnerable of victims:
our children.''
   ``We want the Supreme Court to recognize that children who have
been traumatized by child abuse should not be forced to submit to
additional traumatization by having to come face-to-face with their
alleged assailants in open court,'' Curran said.
   The court's review of the two child-abuse cases marks its second
venture into that area of the law within the past two years.
   The justices in 1988 struck down an Iowa man's sexual-assault
conviction because two 13-year-old girls were allowed to testify
while protected by a large screen placed in the courtroom between
them and him.
   But that ruling, the result of splintered voting among the
justices, appeared to leave unanswered whether there may be
exceptions to the face-to-face requirement.
   In one of the new cases, Maryland's highest court threw out
Sandra A. Craig's conviction, saying her 7-year-old accuser and
three other young witnesses wrongly were allowed to testify against
her over closed-circuit television.
   Mrs. Craig had been convicted of sexually molesting a girl who
attended her Clarksville, Md., day-care center for two years before
it was closed in 1986. She had been sentenced to 10 years in prison
for her 1987 conviction on those charges.
   She also faces trial on charges stemming from allegations of
molestation of 12 other children who attended her center.
   In the Idaho case, the issue is whether a defendant's right to
confrontation was violated by the testimony of a pediatrician who
had examined a 2-year-old girl allegedly abused by her father.
   Laura Lee Wright and Robert Giles were convicted in Idaho of
lewd conduct committed on Mrs. Wright's two daughters, who were
then 5 and 2.
   Mrs. Wright was sentenced to 20 years in prison, but the state
Supreme Court threw out her conviction last June 13 and ordered a
new trial.
   The state court ruled the trial judge wrongly allowed a
pediatrician who had examined the 2-year-old to testify about what
she told him. The girl did not testify at the trial, and therefore
could not be cross-examined by Mrs. Wright's lawyer.
   In other matters Tuesday, the court:
   _Agreed to decide in an Alabama case what authority police have
to stop and question someone on the basis of an anonymous tip.
   _Refused to let a 10-month strike by machinists against Eastern
Airlines spread, through sympathy work stoppages, to commuter
railroads in New York City, Philadelphia and their suburbs.

<HEAD>Expert Says Congress Needs to Study Pesticides Before Legislating</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Public fear of pesticides is growing and
politicians are poised to tighten regulations, but a researcher
says incomplete information on the extent of agricultural chemical
use could lead to bad law.
   ``As a nation, we are in the middle of a major assessment of the
role of pesticides in agriculture,'' said Leonard Gianessi, of the
Resources for the Future, a non-profit environmental research group
which held a seminar on pesticides Tuesday.
   If lawmakers are set on making changes, they should first gather
more information on the use of pesticides, he said.
   Otherwise, ``we stand a good chance of dropping many pesticides
and thereby causing negative consequences that cannot be fully
anticipated,'' Gianessi said.
   Gianessi said most reports on pesticides focus only on major
field crops and many are out of date.
   ``For example, the last reports for Kansas and Missouri were
done in 1978,'' he said. ``Some state have never released any
pesticide use information at all.''
   He said the federal government did its last multi-state
pesticide use surveys for fruit and vegetable crops in 1978, and
its last survey for citrus crops in 1977.
   Detailed information is needed to develop effective food residue
monitoring programs, said the researcher. He added that because
monitoring is expensive, it should be targeted to areas where
pesticide use is high.
   Furthermore, lawmakers should have a realistic view of
pesticides if they are to fashion regulations on their use.
   ``Pesticides have made it possible to grow high-value crops in
regions of the country where such crops could not normally be
produced,'' said Gianessi.
   Lawmakers also would benefit from better information from
consumers on their specific concerns about pesticides, said Carol
Kramer, another researcher who spoke at the seminar.
   ``There are a couple of studies of consumer reaction to
extraordinary contamination of incidents where sales dropped
precipitously,'' she said. ``However, there are no good studies of
demonstrated routine consumer willingness to pay more for
pesticide-free food products.''
   She also said a number of grocery stores are experimenting with
organically grown produce.
   But ``at this time, we cannot answer the fundamental question of
how much perceived risk from pesticides consumers are willing to
accept and how much they are willing to pay to get what they
want,'' she said.
   Legislation has been introduced in both the House and Senate
that would revise pesticide regulation. President Bush also has
presented ideas he would like incorporated into any new law.
   The 1990 farm bill is also expected to contain provisions that
in some way will encourage a change in the way chemicals are used
in agriculture.

   Cupid has a new message for lovers this
Valentine's Day and volunteers are lining up to spread the word
from Loveland.
   People around the world send their Valentines through the
Loveland post office each year to get the special postmark and
cachet verse.
   Ted Thompson, 85, has been coming up with verses since he and
his wife, Mabel, started the remailing program in 1947.
   An estimated 300,000 people will get Thompson's latest
Valentine's verse:
   ``It might just be a song bird,
   ``Or perhaps some sparkling dew,
   ``That brings fond recollections,
   ``And a timeless cupid too.''
   Thompson said recently he's not sure where he got the
inspiration. ``It takes the whole year for me to get something I'm
satisfied with. It's a hard thing for me. Some people are born to
write a verse for you, but that's far away from me.''
   Since it stamped 300 pieces of mail its first year, more than 7
million Valentines have passed through the program. The mail is
hand-stamped by about 50 senior-citizen volunteers. There's no
charge for the extra touch, which begins Monday and continues
through Feb. 14.

   Some people paid $500 to go to
Gov. Jim Florio's inaugural ball and ended up watching television.
   Organizers of Tuesday's $500-a-plate celebration planned for
3,000 guests, but more than 4,300 people showed up.
   ``Isn't this great? We are over subscribed at $500 apiece. Who
would have thought that would ever happen at a Democratic event?''
wondered Princeton Mayor Barbara Sigmund, who also had sought the
Democratic nomination for governor.
   Florio and his wife, Lucinda, arrived shortly before 9 p.m. and
danced their first dance to ``Satin Doll.'' Florio said the ball
was ``organized mayhem.''
   Crews worked through the night Monday to build wood floors and
two tents to handle the overflow crowd at the Garden State
Convention Exhibition Center. Part of a dance floor and the
cocktail area were sacrificed.
   But it still wasn't enough. About 500 people had to go across
the street to a hotel to watch the festivities on a big screen
television.

   A leader of the opposition National
Peasants Party says the revolutionary government has agreed to
delay April parliamentary elections so fledgling parties will have
more time to organize campaigns.
   ``They have promised us ... (the elections) will be postponed
but they didn't give a precise date,'' said Ion Puiu, vice
president of the the largest of the political groupings that have
arisen since last month's revolution.
   Puiu said interim President Ion Iliescu gave the the assurance
at a meeting when asked for a delay. The opposition would like the
voting delayed at least until June.
   Efforts to get confirmation from Iliescu were unavailing late
Tuesday.
   The National Salvation Front now runs Romania following the
otherthrow and execution of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in a bloody
popular uprising.
   U.S. Ambassador Alan Green Jr. praised the Front leadership on
Monday, according to the official news agency Rompres.
   He was quoted as saying in the statement: ``The revolution is
less than a month old, but the caliber of the leadership with whom
I have met is very high.
   ``Significant progress has already been made in stabilizing the
country and beginning a transition to a free society.''
   Puiu said he believed the Front can guarantee free elections and
is not concerned that former members of Ceausescu's Communist Party
are among its leaders.
   The opposition leader said, ``The Communist Party is dead
forever in Romania. This party has no future in this country.''
   Rompres said six parties now have been given official status by
the government, including the National Peasants Party, and
applications from three others are pending.
   The provisional government has argued that swift elections are
needed to put a Parliament and government in place that would avoid
political missteps.
   The most apparent of those was Friday's hasty government ban on
the Communist Party _ in response to a Bucharest demonstration _
that was rescinded Saturday pending submission to a national
referendum on Jan. 28.
   Students on Tuesday under took a campaign to get rid of police
informers in dormitories, end courses on Marxism and fire
professors regarded as incompetent or party apparatchiks.
   It was common under Ceausescu's regime for doctorates to be
awarded on the basis of party affiliation rather than academic
qualifications.

<HEAD>Dole Proposes Cutting US Foreign Aid to Boost Funds to Panama,
East Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, claiming the
White House's blessing, wants to provide new aid to emerging
democracies in Eastern Europe and Panama by trimming aid across the
board to traditional allies.
   Within hours of the proposal, voiced at a news conference
Tuesday and in an opinion column in The New York Times,
denunciations came from Israel and assorted lobbyists for other
countries that would lose out under the plan.
   But State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler called it
``well worth looking at.'' Dole said President Bush himself had
told him ``he appreciated it,'' which he took as an endorsement.
   At a news conference, Dole proposed a 5 percent cut in U.S. aid
to all countries now protected by congressional ``earmarks,'' the
largest of wich are Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, Turkey, the
Philippines, El Salvador, Greece and Honduras. That would free
about $400 million to help encourage fledgling democracies, he said.
   ``Some of these countries have to realize there are fewer
tensions in the world, and maybe some of their demands can be
reduced ... because we have new players'' in the foreign aid field,
Dole said.
   Dole said he already had received a call from the
American-Israel Public Affairs Committee expressing alarm about the
proposal. The group issued a statement calling for new aid to
emerging democracies but adding, ``We believe it should not be at
the expense of other vital U.S. foreign policy objectives. We must
try not to hurt some allies in the process of helping other
allies.''
   ``Nobody will like it,'' Dole said. ``But it seems to me fair
and across the board.'' Of Israel, he added: ``We have limits.
Israel has gotten a lot of preferential treatment.''
   The Israeli Embassy in Washington issued a statement agreeing
that historic change was occurring in Eastern Europe, but noting
``the winds of change have failed to reach the Middle East, and the
dangers Israel faces have even increased.''
   ``Cutting military assistance to Israel at this delicate stage
of the peace process will send a negative message,'' the statement
said. ``Cutting economic assistance at a time Israel gears itself
towards the absorption of hundreds of thousands of Jewish
immigrants would make it almost impossible to meet this challenge.''
   Tutwiler said further talks with congressional leaders on the
proposal would be scheduled soon. But she carefully couched the
administration's position as one of support for increased
flexibility in doling out U.S. foreign aid dollars, and not an
intent to cut any specific country's current quota.
   One early reaction came from Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, who
suggested the money instead come from cuts in the defense budget,
foreshadowing a major battle that will occupy Congress when it
convenes its 1990 session next week.
   And Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., contended ``the United States
has gotten more out of the assistance it has directed to Israel
than any other foreign aid program it conducts. Israel has long
been America's most dependable ally.''
   Of this year's $14.6 billion foreign aid program, 92 percent has
been earmarked by Congress for specific recipients, leaving just
$1.2 billion for the administration to spread thinly among dozens
of friendly, needy nations. As many as a dozen friendly countries
will get nothing this year because of lack of money.
   Israel, at $3 billion, is the top recipient of U.S. aid for
several reasons: strategic importance as an ally in the Middle
East, participation in the Camp David peace process with Egypt, and
the political clout of American Jews.
   The second-largest recipient is Egypt, which will get $2.1
billion this year _ also largely because of the Camp David accord.
Turkey, a NATO ally, is to get $610 million. Pakistan, which has
played a key role in supplying arms to the U.S.-backed mujaheddin
rebels in Afghanistan, will receive $490 million; and the
Philippines, where the United States has important military bases
and wants to support a struggling democracy, will get $360 million.

   Two pit bulls mauled a 70-year-old woman,
gnawing the flesh off her arms Tuesday in a bloody 30-minute attack
at her grandson's home, and one of the limbs was amputated,
officials said.
   ``She has puncture wounds on most of her torso and all the flesh
had been eaten off both arms from the wrist to the shoulder,'' said
police Lt. Alan Kerstein.
   Marjee Lilly of San Diego was in very critical condition at
County-USC Medical Center. Surgeons amputated her left arm and
worked on her right arm in six hours of surgery, said hospital
spokeswoman Adelaida De La Cerda.
   ``Both her arms had been chewed to the bone. She is very
critical,'' De La Cerda said.
   Mrs. Lilly was visiting her 34-year-old grandson, Clarence
Hubbard, at his Los Angeles home, and knew the 14-month-old pit
bulls, which weighed 45 to 50 pounds, said Kerstein. ``She got
along well with the dogs,'' he said.
   Hubbard left for work early Tuesday, leaving his grandmother
alone in the home. He returned at 9:50 a.m. to check up on her, the
lieutenant said.
   ``Upon entering the house, he saw his grandmother on the kitchen
floor, severely mauled,'' Kerstein said. ``Both dogs were sitting
close by in the corner of the room.''
   Mrs. Lilly, who was conscious, told officers the dogs attacked
while she was getting food for them. The woman, who is only 4 feet,
11 inches tall and weighs 130 pounds, was no match for the frenzied
animals.
   ``As Mrs. Lilly was attempting to feed the dogs, she was taking
food out of a large 25-pound bag and the dogs became excited,''
Kerstein said. ``She apparently attempted to push them away or
restrain them and they attacked.
   ``She told paramedics the attack lasted about 30 minutes.''
   The dogs kept biting and chewing on the woman and didn't back
off until they heard Hubbard entering the home. ``They were
restrained just by his presence,'' Kerstein said.
   The dogs were taken to the city animal shelter.
   ``The grandson has indicated he wants them destroyed,'' Kerstein
said. ``He is in shock.''

   The army officers and soldiers
accused of murdering six Jesuit priests made their first appearance
in court, and President Alfredo Cristiani said he believed almost
everyone involved in the crime was in custody.
   Neither Judge Ricardo Zamora nor Col. Guillermo Benavides, the
highest ranking military officer to be accused of a human rights
crime in a decade of civil war, had any comment after the closed
proceedings Tuesday.
   The appearance in the 4th Penal Court was a preliminary
procedure that gave the defendants a chance to tell the judge their
side of the story.
   Cristiani, who named the suspects publicly Saturday, said he
hoped the proceedings would clear up the crime.
   ``We have come down to the bottom of this and we hope that
through the interrogation process in the judicial aspect ... that
even more information might come out and ...that everybody involved
will be held responsible and punished by the law,'' he told
NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   He said he believes ``almost all'' of those involved in the
crime are in custody.
   Zamora has until Friday to decide whether the evidence is
sufficient to charge the eight suspects and order them held for
trial in the Nov. 16 slaying of the six priests, their housekeeper
and her 15-year-old daughter.
   Benavides, who wore a dress uniform to court, and the three
lieutenants, two sergeants, corporal and soldier who faced the
court were returned after dark to the military and police garrisons
near the capital where they are being held.
   A ninth soldier who allegedly took part in the slayings deserted
last month and is a fugitive.
   Cristiani told ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' that Benavides
denies ordering the slayings, ``but the junior officers involved
expressly have testified that they received a direct order from
him.''
   Benavides is director of the Military College and the others are
members of the elite Atlacatl infantry battalion, which was
attached to the college at the time of the massacre.
   Even though the killings of thousands of suspected leftists by
death squads in the early 1980s have been either linked to or
tolerated by the military, no officer has ever been convicted of a
human rights crime.
   The Jesuit massacre, which took place on the fifth day of the
biggest rebel offensive of the war and wiped out the leadership of
the highly regarded Central American University, is a test for
Cristiani's rightist government.
   The murders prompted an international outcry and calls in
Congress for a reappraisal of the more than $1 million a day in aid
sent to El Salvador.
   They also focused attention on the Salvadoran justice system,
which U.S. Ambassador William Walker has publicly said ``doesn't
work.''
   Cristiani, whose government greatly depends on the U.S. aid, has
presented himself as the face of a new, more moderate right in El
Salvador.
   But extreme elements of his party and others in the far right
have long regarded the Central American University Jesuits as
subversives because of their belief that the civil war was the
result of gross social injustice rather than international
communist expansion, and their insistence on dialogue rather than
military force as the path to peace.

   Barbara Bush says the secret to her popularity
is that she's ``just a nice, fat grandmother'' who doesn't threaten
anyone.
   Asked why the American people give her favorability ratings that
surpass even her husband's high poll numbers, Mrs. Bush said
Tuesday, ``I don't know. Maybe they think I like them.''
   Does she? ``Darn near'' everybody, she said.
   ``I don't like racists. I don't like greedy people. I don't like
hate. I like people to be positive. I like people to help each
other,'' she told three reporters.
   People like her, Mrs. Bush said, because, ``I don't have to do
anything except just be there. I don't threaten anyone. I'm just a
nice, fat grandmother.''
   In an interview reflecting on her first year in the White House,
Mrs. Bush said she is still plagued by the double vision and
irritated eyes resulting from Graves disease, an immune system
disorder.
   She said she is ``cautiously optimistic'' that the recent
radiation treatments she underwent will improve the double vision.
It is particularly severe in the morning, she said.
   She can read, but sees double when looking up. Her eyes on
Tuesday looked slightly teary, but not as puffy as in some recent
days.
   But Mrs. Bush said her health problems ranked about 20th on the
list of things on her mind over the past year, including her
family, her dog's six puppies, and the fun she had with Christmas
at the White House.
   ``If you think of others and you keep busy you really are better
off in life,'' she said.
   Mrs. Bush said she has been surprised at how much she likes
being first lady.
   Although security concerns prevent her from walking her dog out
on the street when she feels like it, or going for a drive, she
called those restrictions minor compared to the luxuries.
   ``Ask me how many times I have to wait at the doctor, or ask me
how many times I have to hassle at the airport, or try to find a
cab ... or wait for the plumber. Ask me how many times I have to
stand in the grocery line. ... Everything wonderful happens to me
... I don't have any hassles.''
   On other matters, the first lady disclosed:
   _A new mattress for the bed in the Lincoln bedroom was purchased
by Bush's brothers and sister because the old one was too soft.
``They said if we're going to have to sleep here we want a better
mattress, so they bought a better mattress.''
   _She doesn't have a favorite former first lady, but is
``grateful to every one of them _ the Fords for their pool, the
Trumans for their balcony, Pat Nixon for the beauty parlor.'''
Nancy Reagan, she said, ``really saved me a lot of repair,'' by
making sure the plumbing works and overhauling some of the older
rooms.
   _She would prefer that the upcoming drug summit Bush will attend
in violence-ridden Colombia be held elsewhere, although she is
confident security precautions will keep him safe. ``I wish it
would be right here'' _ but ``I can't change his mind or make those
decisions ... I have no input on that.''
   Mrs. Bush, who typically declines to comment on policy issues,
was asked if women should be allowed in combat as they were in
Panama recently.
   ``If I thought a woman physically could pick up someone who was
wounded and carry them to safety, if I thought they could throw a
hand grenade as far as a man, then I would say fine. Because I
think certainly emotionally and mentally they are more than able to
compete with a man,'' she said.
   ``They can shoot as well. They can fly as well.''

   Helen Hayes stood on a sidewalk in the theater
district and picked a spot for her plaque in a ``Broadway Walk of
Stars.''
   ``I think stage center is where I'd like it,'' the 89-year-old
actress said after looking up at an overhang to determine the
center in front of a new Holiday Inn being dedicated in April.
   The first plaque pictures a Tony Award and includes Ms. Hayes'
name; her category, best actress; the play, ``Happy Birthday;'' and
the year, 1947, the first year of Tony Awards.
   Other plaques will be placed on sidewalks throughout the theater
district, rather than in a continuous line like the Hollywood Walk
of Fame, said Meredith Pillon, a Holiday Inn spokeswoman.
   Pillon said Tuesday the League of American Theatres and
Producers, the American Theatre Wing, the Broadway Association and
Holiday Inn were hoping to begin the project with about 200 plaques.

   ``We are with only nine years left in this century, and to be

reality,'' the 40-year-old musician said Tuesday at a birthday

   Actor Paul Sorvino is turning again
to singing, but the acclaimed opera singer says he knows better
than to try to soothe the savage beast of gamblers with an aria.
   ``I think people who are losing $20,000 are not going to want to
hear it,'' he said. Instead, Sorvino will be belting out Broadway
tunes, a few Neopolitan songs and some standards this weekend at
the Showboat Hotel &amp; Casino.
   His singing work in the past has been sporadic. He recorded the
cast album to the Broadway shows ``Carmelina'' and ``The Bakers
Wife,'' 13 years ago and gave a concert at New York City's Town
Hall in the mid-1980s.
   His acting roles include the bigoted Southern cop in the
television mini-series ``Chiefs.'' He plays gangster Lips Manlis in
the Warren Beatty film ``Dick Tracy,'' which is due for release in
a few months; a Mafia don opposite Robert DeNiro in Martin
Scorcese's ``Good Fellas''; and a renegade CIA agent in ``DMZ.''

   She has appeared in ``She-Devil'' with Roseanne Barr and Meryl
Streep and has had parts in television commercials.
   Assistant principal Dennis Springer said Tuesday the school was

   A Chinese-American group is calling on
Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen to apologize for using the term
``Chinaman.''
   Chinese for Affirmative Action of San Francisco said Tuesday it
had asked NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue to fine Bowlen for his
``racist comment.''
   On Monday, Bowlen, whose team faces the 49ers in the Super Bowl,
offered a tongue-in-cheek assessment of the San Francisco.
   ``Those guys have got a great owner,'' Bowlen said. ``They've
got God for a quarterback. They've got a Chinaman who plays wide
receiver whose feet never touch the ground.''
   Bowlen, when asked what he meant, said ```That Chinese guy.
What's his name? Rice?'' referring to Jerry Rice.
   Broncos spokesman Jim Saccomano said Bowlen ``was just speaking
facetiously'' about Rice, who is black. ``He was trying to be
funny,'' Saccomano said.
   But Chinese for Affirmative Action said the term ``Chinaman''
was ``an extremely derogatory term'' to the Asian community.

<HEAD>Government Wants Better Count of Workers Infected With Aids on Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government officials say they don't know how
many health care workers become infected with the AIDS virus on the
job, but they are sure it's higher than the 19 reported U.S. cases.
   An official at the federal Centers for Disease Control said
Tuesday his agency is working to expand reporting and come up with
more accurate data. But critics say putting out figures that are
admittedly too low ``trivializes'' the risk and lulls workers into
complacency.
   ``If the risk is downplayed, then the it-can't-happen-to-me
attitude will tend to prevail,'' said Hacib Aoun, a Baltimore
physician who contracted AIDS after he cut his finger on a tube
filled with infected blood in 1983.
   David Bell, chief of AIDS activity in the hospital infections
program at CDC in Atlanta, said the agency isn't minimizing the
risk of occupational exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus,
or HIV, which can occur if a worker is pricked with a contaminated
needle or is splashed with blood from an infected patient.
   Bell said all surveillance systems, including the one tracking
health care workers who become infected with HIV, are prone to
underreporting.
   ``The number of health care workers with HIV infection,
including occupationally acquired HIV, exceeds that which has been
reported to us. We all know that,'' Bell said.
   However, he said, public health officials don't know how many
health care workers have been infected in the course of their work.
   The CDC reports 27 cases of occupationally acquired HIV
infection by health care workers worldwide, 19 of them in the
United States. The agency is also investigating 34 other cases, he
said.
   Larry Gostin, executive director of the Boston-based American
Society of Law and Medicine, said the actual number of cases in
which health care workers are infected on the job could be up to
five times the CDC's official count.
   A study has determined the risk that a health care worker will
become infected with HIV after being pricked with a contaminated
needle is 1 in 250, Bell said.
   Gostin said: ``I don't want health care workers to be unduly
alarmed by the risks. I think the risks are small. But they have a
right and society has a right to have the numbers be as truthful as
possible.
   ``That way, a clearer calculation can be made about the risk ...
and there's more incentive to see that the risk is real and that
its necessary to use precautions,'' he said.
   Aoun, who said his case has not yet been included in CDC's
official count, said he believes underreporting is a form of
``panic control'' that ultimately will subject workers to greater
risks through complacency.
   ``The information they provide is used to formulate policy'' to
improve protections for workers and to improve benefits for workers
infected on the job, he said. ``If the number is trivialized, these
changes that are needed will be slow in coming.''
   Aoun, who settled with Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1987, said
workers need better protections against HIV infection and better
benefits if they do become infected on the job.
   Several other lawsuits filed by health care workers claiming to
have been infected on the job have been settled, and several are
pending.
   The current suit by New York physician Veronica Prego is the
first to go to trial.
   Sometimes workers don't report a needlestick or other possible
accidental exposure, and in three quarters of the cases that are
reported and HIV infection is positive, subsequent investigations
turn up other risk factors, including sexual behavior and
intravenous drug use, Bell said.
   Bell said that in the CDC's expanded reporting system, reports
will be categorized according to how clear they are that infection
occurred in the workplace.
   The center published voluntary guidelines in 1982 for hospitals
and other medical institutions to follow to protect workers against
HIV infection. The Labor Department's Occupational Safety and
Health Administration has proposed regulations that would require
hospitals to institute specific safeguards.

   Officials at MCI Communications Corp. say it
couldn't happen to them. US Sprint says it could happen to anybody.
   A day after long-distance service crashed for millions of AT&amp;T
customers, AT&amp;T's two biggest long-distance competitors disagreed
on Tuesday about whether they could suffer a similar massive
computer glitch.
   MCI, the nation's second-largest telecommunications company, and
No. 3 US Sprint use the same Signaling System 7 technology that
apparently caused problems for the American Telephone and Telegraph
Co.
   In Washington, MCI Executive Vice President Richard Liebhaber
said after a top-to-bottom check of the company's equipment, ``We
don't see any potential points of failure.''
   But a spokeswoman for Kansas City, Mo.-based US Sprint, Terri
Dunn, said, ``Essentially, it could happen to anybody.''
   AT&amp;T carries about 70 percent of the nation's long-distance
calls; MCI handles about 12 percent; US Sprint has about 8 percent.
   Neither of the smaller companies experienced long distance
outages Monday.
   ``I hate like hell to see it. I really feel sorry for these
guys,'' said MCI's Liebhaber, noting the long-distance disturbance
``has an impact on American industry and an impact on everybody's
customers.''
   Signaling System 7 is a so-called common channel signal system
that ``makes your network smarter and improves the calling
process,'' said Dunn. The system allows equipment to see if a
circuit or a phone number is busy before putting a call through and
tying up a circuit.
   AT&amp;T said Tuesday it traced the trouble to a bug, or ``logic''
problem, in the AT&amp;T-designed software that runs its signalling
system. It said the bug was written into the software originally
and was an accident waiting to happen.
   Ms. Dunn said US Sprint has had the system since November 1987
and ``we have not experienced an outage such as this.'' But she
said US Sprint ``is constantly checking our software and centrally
monitoring of the network.''
   Liebhaber said that although their technology is similar to
AT&amp;T's, the equipment is different.
   ``They have manufactured their own system,'' he said of AT&amp;T.
``I don't use stuff supplied by AT&amp;T. Our equipment is manufactured
by Digital Switch and combined with our own software.''
   Both MCI and US Sprint said AT&amp;T customers could use their
long-distance services by dialing the access codes of either 10333
for Sprint or 10222 for MCI. Callers will be billed through their
local phone company bill.

   The actress who portrayed housekeeper
Aunt Bee on ``The Andy Griffith Show'' lived her last years in
seclusion in a dark, dingy house and kept a 1966 green Studebaker
with four flat tires in the garage.
   The home of Frances Bavier reflects little of the coziness of
the fictional house that Aunt Bee managed for Mayberry's sheriff
and his young son on the popular television series of the 1960s.
   The 86-year-old Miss Bavier died Dec. 6 in the spacious
two-story Siler City home to which she retired in 1972. She rarely
left the house, town residents say.
   ``She strikes me as living a sparse life in her latter years, a
very quiet life,'' said Diana Hatch, communications director for
University of North Carolina Center for Public Television.
   Of an estimated $700,000 estate, Miss Bavier left the house to a
hospital foundation and its antiquated contents to the public
television network.
   An appraisal put the value of Miss Bavier's belongings at
$31,683, excluding the Studebaker, last driven in 1983 on a trip to
a grocery store.
   The stench from the actress' 14 cats coupled with peeling
plaster, frayed carpets and worn upholstery indicate Miss Bavier
either was unable or unwilling to spend much time keeping up the
home.
   Her cats evidently used a basement room and a shower stall as a
litter box.
   Evidently, the reclusive actress spent most of her time in a
large back room plainly furnished with a bed, a desk, a television
and an end table, where she kept her reading and opera glasses,
black licorice and a bell.
   ``I think she was a person who obviously valued her privacy. She
... could have had non-stop fans if she had opened her doors,''
said Ms. Hatch.
   Two trunks held her fan mail, letters in one and studio
portraits of her ``to be signed'' in another.
   Miss Bavier's few costly possessions consisted primarily of some
rare leather-bound books, a lace collection and a considerable
quantity of table linens, said Ms. Hatch.
   The few mementos of the actress' television days were the dress
and hats she wore in the show and a few publicity pictures. There
also was a blue satin gown she may have worn when she won her Emmy
Award, said Ms. Hatch.
   Just as the neat, matronly Aunt Bee would have done, Miss Bavier
saved sewing fabric in labeled boxes in a bedroom closet. But what
she made with the material was not evident in the house, which had
no curtains at windows. The walls were mostly bare except for a few
ordinary electric wall clocks.
   And while Aunt Bee was known around the ficticious Mayberry,
N.C., courthouse for her tasty box lunches, there was only one
cookbook in Miss Bavier's yellow and green 1950s kitchen.
   The belongings will be auctioned this spring, said Bob Royster,
production director for the public television center.

<TEXT>
   Three Lockheed Aircraft Corp. workers in Chad
have been detained in what the company Tuesday called a
``misunderstanding'' with that country's government, but a relative
of one of the men described them as hostages.
   The three work for the Lockheed Aeronautical System-Georgia
subsidiary, and are in the African country as part of a sale of
C-130 Hercules airplanes built in Marietta, Ga., to the government
there, said company spokesman Dick Martin.
   Lockheed agreed to set up an office in Chad for one year after
the sale so the technicians could help maintain the planes and
explain their use, Martin said.
   The year ended in December, and as the men packed up they
destroyed some documents, including manuals on the planes. Martin
said Chad's government felt the documents belonged to them, while
Lockheed maintains they were company property.
   Martin said officials of Chad revoked the workers' passports,
but said they were allowed free movement in the Marriott Hotel in
the capital of N'Djamena and the surrounding area.
   Barbara Porter, whose brother, Irving Thrash, is one of the
workers, said she learned of the matter when she telephoned her
sister-in-law in Chad on Tuesday night. The sister-in-law said the
Americans had been taken hostage Jan. 5, Mrs. Porter said.
   Mrs. Porter said Lockheed never alerted her about the matter.
   Martin said Lockheed immediately notified relatives and the
State Department. Lockheed employees immediately flew to Chad to
negotiate with officials, and copies of the destroyed documents
will be sent to Chad, he said.
   The Lockheed spokesman said the matter ``has not been a
life-threatening situation for anyone.''
   Mrs. Porter said she believed Chad is ``afraid their planes are
sabotaged.''
   Her sister-in-law, Gail Thrash, told her she was ``starving''
and didn't know where her husband was, Mrs. Porter said. One of the
other workers also brought his wife to Chad.
   Martin said he did not have the names of the other two workers.
   Mrs. Porter said she spoke with her sister-in-law by telephone
Tuesday night.
   ``She said the phones were being monitored. She said call my
Aunt Chris Curle and Uncle Paul Reynolds and mentioned the name
Terry Waite, meaning she was held captive,'' Mrs. Porter said.
   Waite, an Anglican church envoy, is among the Westerners
believed held hostage in Lebanon. Ms. Curle and Reynolds are
Atlanta television reporters.
   Mrs. Porter took her sister-in-law's mention of their names to
be a signal to call news media.
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Porter telephoned WAGA-TV, which reported the
men had been detained.
   An employee at the Marriott in N'Djamena said the Lockheed
employees ``were out'' when an Associated Press reporter telephoned
the hotel late Tuesday.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange gained in

down against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 145.52 yen, down 0.23 yen from Tuesday's

Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev had resigned, dealers said.
   The index had shed 666.41 points Tuesday, the largest single-day
loss since Nov. 10, 1987, when it fell 731.91 points.
   A slump on the Tokyo stock market in recent weeks has been
caused partly by falling Japanese government bond prices.
   Traders said trading was generally calm, with many market
players taking a wait-and-see position ahead of the release of U.S.
merchandise trade figures for November, expected later Wednesday in
Washington.
   Some economists predict the U.S. November trade deficit will
narrow to $9.4 billion from $10.2 billion in October.

   A judge sentenced an art forger to 10
months in prison and ordered him to donate four fake 19th century
paintings to a gallery so that others could study his illegal craft.
   Robert L. Trotter of Kennett Square, Pa., pleaded guilty in
August to one count of wire fraud for using the telephone to sell
forgeries.
   Prosecutors said Trotter passed off 55 works he had painted as
19th century paintings by forging signatures and treating old
canvasses with chemicals to make the paint crack.
   The paintings also were placed in old frames. They were sold in
11 states.
   U.S. District Judge Alan H. Nevas on Tuesday sentenced Trotter
to 10 months in prison, ordered him to pay nearly $70,000 in
restitution and to donate four of the fake paintings to the Yale
University Art Gallery for permanent exhibition and study of the
art of forgery.
   The FBI began an investigation in May after receiving a tip from
the owners of a gallery who realized a 19th century painting they
had bought from Trotter was a fake.
   Eugene and Mary Anne Shannon stopped payment on their $25,000
check to Trotter after consulting with another dealer and
confirming the painting was not an authentic work of John Haberle,
a 19th-century New Haven artist.
   Authorities said Trotter sold the forgeries to auction houses
and art dealers in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Vermont and Virginia.
   Nevas ordered Trotter to pay $68,400 in restitution to four
people who purchased fakes between February 1985 and May 1989. He
also ordered Trotter to undergo psychiatric counseling, and told
him to surrender by Feb. 6.
   Trotter's attorney, public defender Richard Reeve, did not
immediately return a reporter's telephone call after Tuesday's
sentencing.

<HEAD>Air Force to Let Women Crew on Cargo Airdrops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force is lifting restrictions that
kept women from being crew members on cargo airdrop missions.
   Capt. George Sillia said Tuesday that women now may serve as
pilots, co-pilots, loadmasters, flight engineers or crew chiefs on
C-130 or C-141 transport planes. The spokesman said the decision
will affect about 100 women among its 4,800 pilots and a like
number of women among enlisted crew members.
   Previously, women crew members were allowed to fly on C-141
aircraft to a specific location, unload the cargo and return.
However, women had not been allowed to be crew members on the
C-130, except the WC-130, a weather reconnaissance plane.
   The decision was made Dec. 14, six days before the U.S. invasion
of Panama during which Army women were reported to have taken part
in combat, Sillia said. The intervention delayed the formal
announcement.
   The command determined that airdrop missions don't fall under
the Defense Department's February 1988 ``risk rule,'' which says a
non-combat mission or unit can be closed to women if officials deem
that the risks are equal to or greater than those of the combat
mission they support.

<HEAD>Court Moves Toward Computerized Opinions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court is taking a major step into
the computer age by agreeing to make its opinions quickly available
via computer to The Associated Press and other members of a
24-member consortium that will provide the necessary equipment.
   The consortium's equipment will be used to disseminate the
opinions to 10 to 15 media and legal organizations, which will then
relay the information to others.
   A court committee overseeing the project said Tuesday it had
accepted an offer from the Supreme Court Opinion Network, SCON, and
soon will begin discussions to determine what kind of equipment is
needed.
   SCON, a non-profit consortium, also includes as its members the
American Bar Association, C-SPAN cable television network,
Knight-Ridder, Mead Data, United Press International and The
Washington Post.
   West Publishing Co., a major legal publisher, had made an offer
similar to SCON's.
   The Associated Press, which was among the 14 originally
submitting proposals, intends to receive the opinions
electronically and make them available to its membership. The
details of the AP plan have not been made final, pending further
description of the court's system.
   The court will choose 10 to 15 middleman ``subscribers'' that,
for a $500 annual fee, will receive opinions electronically minutes
after they are announced and distribute them. The court describes
these middlemen as ``mass disseminators'' of information.
   The court committee said subscribers will be ``those 10 to 15
organizations the court determines can best provide opinions to the
broadest possible audience.''

<HEAD>Defense Department Delays Drug Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department is holding off on
announcement of a White House-approved plan to involve U.S.
military forces more deeply in the international war on drugs.
   ``Some of the aspects of that have been put off for a while
following discussions with (Colombian) President Barco,'' Pentagon
spokesman Pete Williams told reporters Tuesday as he announced that
the department will not hold a news conference this week on the
drug plan as planned.
   Williams said he expected an announcement on the drug plan after
the department releases its budget for fiscal 1991 on Jan. 29. He
said he was unsure whether it would be announced before President
Bush goes to Colombia in February for an anti-drug summit of the
leaders of Andean nations.
   Under the reported anti-drug effort, the Navy was to operate an
aircraft carrier battle group off the Caribbean coast of Colombia
on a rotating basis.
   Pentagon officials have said the Navy would use high-tech radar
and surveillance equipment to keep tabs on suspected drug dealers'
boats and planes.
   Peru, Colombia and Bolivia have said they oppose the use of U.S.
military to police international waters.

<TEXT>
   A man claiming he had a bomb took over an
America West airliner late Tuesday and demanded to be flown to
Cuba, but was arrested soon after the plane made an emergency
landing in Austin, police said.
   No one was seriously injured during Flight 727 from Houston to
Las Vegas, with 34 passengers and five crew members aboard, or the
arrest at Robert Mueller Municipal Airport, officials said.
   SWAT team members overpowered the man aboard the plane,
officials said.
   FBI agent Byron Sage identifed the man as Jose Manuel
Gonzales-Gonzales, 39, and said he was believed to be from New
Orleans. Gonzales-Gonzales was believed to be of Cuban descent.
   The flight was diverted to Austin and landed shortly before
11:30 p.m. after trouble was reported aboard, America West
spokeswoman Kathy Christensen said in Phoenix, where the airline is
based.
   ``The man said he had a bomb and had some electronic device that
blinked when he pointed to the front of the aircraft,'' said
passenger Herb Atwood of Cold Spring, Texas.
   ``He grabbed one of the stewardesses and had something around
her neck,'' Atwood said in an interview with radio station KVET.
``He was shouting orders. He said he wanted them to fly to Cuba,
but the pilot said that we did not have enough fuel.''
   The man ordered all the passengers to move to the front of the
aircraft, Atwood said.
   Austin police received a report of a bomb threat at 11:28 p.m.,
said police spokesman Harold Elmore.
   After the plane landed, nearly 40 police officers, including
hostage negotiators, surrounded the aircraft shortly before
midnight.
   Police Capt. Loyd Polk said he climbed up an escape hatch into
the aircraft, then subdued Gonzales-Gonzales.
   ``I saw he had the stewardess, so I took action immediately,''
Polk said. ``I had a struggle with him, but I was able to hold him
to the ground until more help arrived.''
   Passengers evacuated the plane, and police began searching the
airplane for a bomb. ``We doubt there was a bomb aboard the
plane,'' Elmore said.
   Gonzales-Gonzales was taken to a hospital early Wednesday for
treatment of cuts to his head suffered when he was arrested, said
city emergency services shift commander Bob Gutierrez.
   The stewardess who was grabbed was also taken to a hospital for
minor cuts and burns when coffee spilled on her, Gutierrez said.
   Several passengers were treated at the airport for minor
injuries suffered when they evacuated the aircraft.
   Elmore said passengers were taken to an airport terminal for
questioning. City aviation director Charles Gates said the
passengers would be put up in a hotel for the night and flown out
Wednesday morning.
   Sage said authorities intended to charge the man with air piracy
and kidnapping.
   ``You always hear about this,'' passenger Atwood said, ``and I
never thought it would happen to me. I was scared like everyone
else. I was looking forward to a trip to Vegas. But my gambling
ended before it started.''

   The Bush administration supports Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's use of troops to try to restore order in the
southern Caucasus and is criticizing feuding Azerbaijanis and
Armenians for ``revisiting old ethnic hatreds.''
   Without offering a judgment on the territorial dispute between
the two groups, State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler
said Tuesday, ``It's time for the violence to stop and any
grievances to be settled peacefully.''
   At least 56 people have been killed and 156 injured in the
strife in the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan since Thursday.
Gorbachev on Monday signed a sweeping emergency decree after
intense anti-Armenian riots in Baku, the regional capital.
   At the heart of the fighting are conflicting claims to
Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian area within Ajerbaijan.
   In response to questions, Ms. Tutwiler said the Bush
administration supports ``the self-determination of people.'' But
she gave no hint of backing either side's claims.
   As Gorbachev and the Presidum of the Soviet Parliament struggled
with the violence in the Caucasus, the State Department and the
White House stressed Moscow's authority to restore order.
   ``The distinction here is not people pressing for peaceful
political change, participation, expression.'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
``They are instead revisiting old ethnic hatreds.''
   Describing the situation as ``a very difficult one,'' Marlin
Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said: ``We have seen ethnic
tensions there for many, many years. And we certainly regret the
violence that is taking place now. We understand the need to
establish order in a situation where order has broken down.''
   Also, Fitzwater said: ``We recognize the right of any state to
ensure the safety of its citizens, and it looks like that's the
primary concern at the moment.''
   In Moscow, spokesman Vladimir A. Yanchenkov of the Soviet
Interior Ministry confirmed media accounts that KGB security forces
and army had been deployed in the region. He referred to some of
the violence as ``pogroms,'' or massacres.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Tutwiler said the United
States regretted the violence and urged Armenians and Azerbaijanis
to refrain.
   ``These are age-old ethnic tensions,'' she said.
``Unfortunately, the level of violence has escalated dramatically
over the last several days. It's time for the violence to stop, and
any grievances settled peacefully.''
   The statement concluded: ``We don't encourage the use of force
anywhere, and we would hope it is unnecessary. But we recognize the
need to establish order where people are killing each other.''
   On another subject, the State Department said Gorbachev ``may
have opened the door a bit to the possibility of a multi-party
system'' in the Soviet Union.
   ``But he is by no means calling for its establishment,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said in a statement.
   This referred to remarks by the Soviet leader during a visit
last week to Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. There he urged
rebellious Lithuanians to remain in the Soviet Union and said his
fate and that of his economic reconstruction program depended on
the outcome.
   ``We should not be afraid of a multi-party system if it serves
the people,'' Gorbachev said.
   The State Department also registered its approval of a decision
by the East German government to drop its plan for reviving a state
security organization. It reflected ``the clearly expressed wishes
of the East German population,'' a statement read by Ms. Tutwiler
said.
   On another front, the State Department supported Czechoslovakia
in calling for the removal of Soviet troops from the country.
   But the statement read by Ms. Tutwiler stressed the only way to
verify a pullout is through a treaty now in negotiation in Vienna
between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   It would reduce U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe and impose
strict limits on how many foreign forces could be stationed in any
country.

<HEAD>Walter Judd Renews Praise of Chiang Kai-shek, Chiang Ching-kuo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the recent collapse of East European
communist governments, the late Chinese Nationalists Sun Yat-sen,
Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo stand out as giants of
history, says Walter H. Judd in a rare appearance for the aging
former missionary and congressman.
   The three leaders of the Nationalist Republic of China ``are
giants today'' while communist leaders from Marx to Lenin to
Brezhnev to Deng Xiaoping to Gorbachev are increasingly
discredited, the aging Minnesota Republican said Tuesday.
   Judd, 91, was famous as a leader of the old ``China Lobby,'' a
group of influential Americans credited with delaying U.S.
recognition of the Chinese communist government for nearly a
quarter of a century after its 1949 takeover in Beijing.
   Judd, a medical missionary in China for a decade who later
served 20 years in the House, made a rare public appearance at the
launching of ``Chiang Ching-kuo Remembered: The Man and his
Political Legacy,'' a book about the Nationalist president who died
in 1988.
   It was written by Ray Cline, Central Intelligence Agency station
chief in Taiwan from 1958 to 1963 and later a CIA spokesman in
Washington. Now retired from government, Cline heads the U.S.
Global Strategy Council, a conservative research organization.
   Chiang Ching-kuo was the son of Chiang Kai-shek, the
generalissimo who led the Nationalist' retreat to offshore Taiwan
in 1949. Sun Yat-sen headed the revolutionaries who overthrew the
Manchu dynasty and formed the first Chinese republic in 1912.
   Cline, who knew Chiang Ching-kuo for 30 years, and other
speakers, credited the late president with laying the groundwork
for current democratic reforms in Taiwan and for the island's
spectacular economic growth.
   When the United States switched diplomatic relations from Taiwan
to Beijing in 1979, President Chiang Ching-kuo overruled advice to
turn his back on America and democracy, ``swallowing blood on his
teeth,'' said veteran U.S. career diplomat David Dean, using a
Chinese expression for turning the other cheek.
   Dean finished a tour last month as head of the Taipei office of
the American Institute in Taiwan, the organization maintaining
nonofficial U.S. relations after derecognition.
   Taiwan is prepared to trade with and provide some economic aid
to Poland and other newly-democratic countries of Eastern Europe,
but they ``have to make the first move,'' said Stephen S.F. Chen,
deputy chief of Taiwan's mission in Washington, known as the
Coordination Council for North American Affairs.
   Taiwan law prohibits dealing with hostile countries, but such
countries ``are no longer hostile,'' Chen noted. A problem is that
the consortium of donor nations for Eastern Europe aid is made up
of governments that, like the United States, do not recognize
Taiwan and do not allow it to participate, he said.
   Cline said his book will be translated into Chinese by Taiwan's
United Daily News group for publication in book form with excerpts
in the Lian Ho Pao newspaper.

<HEAD>Navy Quietly Starts Transmissions From $400 Million Communications
System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT IMRIE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CLAM LAKE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 15-mile antenna strung out like a giant
cross in the Chequamegon National Forest quietly sends radio
messages to missile-equipped submarines patrolling deep waters
around the world.
   The Navy began using the $400 million ELF system last fall,
replacing smaller transmitters that had been sending messages to
missile-equipped submarines since the late 1960s.
   The earlier project went through despite years of protests based
on fears that the low-frequency radio waves would fry fish in
nearby streams and produce two-headed squirrels.
   ``In the last two years, we have had only two protests of any
significance. Those folks were strictly anti-military,'' said Lt.
John Smythe, project commander. ``I think the biological,
ecological and safety issues have all been addressed.''
   At one point, demonstrations occurred almost weekly at the
fenced-in transmitter site in northwestern Wisconsin.
Nuclear-weapons opponents argued the system would make the forest a
target for Soviet missiles and environmentalists called for more
studies.
   ELF, or extremely low frequency, is the only system of its kind
that sends radio waves that penetrate water. The system permits
submarines to prowl undetected by radar while receiving messages
several hundred feet under water.
   The antenna _ two strands of cable strung on wooden poles _ and
a transmitter are tucked into the forest atop 20,000 feet of buried
rock near Clam Lake, a quiet tourist wayside.
   Bears frequently climb on the poles and snowmobiles glide
through a corridor carved in the trees.
   Jerry Holter and his wife, Tish, both 60, live about a mile from
the antenna and have watched the project unfold since 1969.
   ``They brought in peace activists by the busloads,'' Holter
recalled. ``You won't find anybody in the area that ever thought
the project would do all the things opponents claimed, including
make you sterile if you walked under the lines.''
   Mrs. Holter served as a ``human guinea pig'' for researchers
monitoring the medical effects of the system on nearby residents.
   ``We are both so darn healthy, it's funny,'' she said.
   But Mark Peterson, executive director of the Sigurd Olson
Environmental Institute of Northland College in Ashland, said the
project still has its skeptics. They point to studies that indicate
milk production of cows that graze near high voltage electrical
lines drops off, he said.
   The system _ and a companion one near K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base
south of Marquette, Mich. _ use a total of $60,000 worth of
electricity each month and employ about 75 people, mostly
civilians, Smythe said.
   ELF is scaled down considerably from the original plan, which
included a grid of 6,200 miles of buried cable and 100 transmitters
built to survive a nuclear war.
   Independent researchers spent years studying possible
environmental and ecological problems the giant antenna and its
radio waves might cause, Smythe said.
   Scientists checked to see if sparrows laid the same number of
eggs each spring. Offspring of birds and bees were measured and
weighed.
   ``There have been no squirrels with two heads and six legs. We
have not been able to detect any negative effects in the
biological-ecological system,'' Smythe said.
   But monitoring of homes and other testing in the area will
continue through 1991, Smythe said.
   Former Sen. Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis., raised the first
environmental questions about the project in the late 1960s.
   ``I would say that they had resolved 90-plus percent of the
concerns I had at the time, perhaps 98 or 99 percent,'' said
Nelson, now an adviser with the Wilderness Society in Washington,
an environmental group that specializes in public lands' issues.
   Holter, a wood carver, said ELF, which looks like a small radio
station, is preferable to other alternatives.
   ``I think I feel more secure with that sitting in my backyard
than tons of battleships.''

<HEAD>Five Major Powers To Push U.N.-Administered Peace In Cambodia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. Security Council's permanent members _ the
United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France _ have
agreed to move quickly to seek a cease-fire and free elections in
Cambodia under U.N. administration.
   Officials of the five countries concluded two days of meetings
Tuesday night by setting out a 16-point summary of principles,
focused on ``an enhanced U.N. role'' in bringing peace to Cambodia.
   Representatives of the countries will meet again in New York in
about two weeks, then again in late February in Paris to push the
peace program ahead as quickly as possible.
   ``We're at least going to make a strong try at it,'' said a
senior U.S. official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity.
``We're not talking about a process that would take several years,
but it's clear it will take several months.''
   Much could depend on China, which arms and supplies the powerful
Khmer Rouge resistance faction, and is being counted on to
influence its clients to accept U.N.-supervised elections rather
than seek military victory.
   The five countries said a special representative of U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar would be in charge of
United Nations activities in Cambodia during an unspecified
transition period leading to elections.
   They called in a statement for ``an effective U.N. presence'' to
assure internal security, apparently a reference to a peacekeeping
force.
   Elections ``must be conducted under direct U.N. administration''
that would assure ``a neutral political environment in which no
party would be advantaged,'' the statement said.
   ``An enduring peace can only be achieved through a comprehensive
political settlement, including the verified withdrawal of foreign
forces, a cease-fire and the cessation of outside military
assistance,'' it said. ``The goal should be self-determination for
the Cambodian people through free, fair and democratic elections.''
   Points set out in the statement do not deal with some of the
most difficult issues _ such as whether to dissolve Premier Hun
Sen's Vietnamese-backed government, or what to do about Cambodia's
United Nations seat, now held by the three-party guerrilla
coalition led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   The statement does not even refer directly to Hun Sen, Sihanouk
or the Khmer Rouge, Cambodia's brutal masters for three years until
the late 1978 Vietnamese invasion that ousted them. The Khmer Rouge
are now allied with Sihanouk and another non-communist resistance
group.
   It appeared to draw heavily from ideas floated by Australia and
by U.S. Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., for expanding the United
Nations role in Cambodia.
   Hun Sen's government and the three guerrilla factions have shown
varying degrees of enthusiasm for the idea, but none has rejected
it out of hand.
   Pressure to find a solution has grown with reports of stepped-up
Khmer Rouge attacks in western Cambodia. Without large numbers of
Vietnamese troops to help, it is not clear how well Hun Sen's
forces will stand up to the guerrillas.
   A peace conference last summer in Paris foundered on
disagreement over proposals for a temporary administration of all
four Cambodian factions to run the country until elections chose
new leaders. Hun Sen refused to consider letting the Khmer Rouge
in. Sihanouk rejected any idea of keeping them out.
   The Khmer Rouge were responsible for killing hundreds of
thousands of people while they were in power.
   The American official who spoke to reporters said Chinese
participants in the meeting said they did not want to eliminate
completely the proposal for a quadripartite administration but were
willing to pursue the prospects for a greater U.N. role in running
the country until elections are held.
   The statement issued by the permanent members Tuesday suggests a
Supreme National Council ``might be the repository of Cambodian
sovereignty during the transition process'' but does not say who
might serve on such a council.
   Another point says ``questions involving Cambodian sovereignty
should be resolved with the agreement of the Cambodian parties'' _
which seems to fall short of the effective veto power each of the
four factions held at previous steps of the slow-moving peace talks
in recent years.
   The United Nations also is asked to verify complete withdrawal
of foreign forces from Cambodia. Vietnam announced in September
that the last of its troops had left, but Sihanouk accused Vietnam
of leaving disguised soldiers behind and intending to colonize the
country.

   Armed troops guarded the capital today
after the main opposition leader was disqualified as a candidate in
May 27 elections, Burma's first multiparty vote in three decades,
Western diplomats said.
   The decision to disqualify Aung San Suu Kyi was made late
Tuesday by the military government's Election Commission, sources
on the commission said. They said without elaborating that her
candidacy for a seat in Parliament did not conform to the election
law.
   Both the commission sources and the diplomats spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The diplomats, reached by telephone from Bangkok, said large
numbers of troops who had entered Rangoon in trucks on Tuesday were
guarding City Hall, where Election Commission has offices. They did
not say exactly how many troops there were.
   A candidate in the Rangoon constituency of Bahan, Ms. Suu Kyi,
44, has been under house arrest since July 20. The government has
accused her of subversion, but no formal charges have been filed.
   Ms. Suu Kyi is the daughter of the late Aung San, the widely
revered leader of Burmese independence.
   She is the general secretary of the National League For
Democracy, which is the largest and most popular opposition party.
The co-leader of her party, Tin Oo, was sentenced last month to
three years in prison on charges of subversion.
   Ms. Suu Kyi has strongly criticized alleged abuses by the
military authorities.
   The military seized power after crushing a national
pro-democracy uprising in September 1988, killing several thousand
mostly unarmed protesters.
   The government has promised to relinquish power after a free and
fair election, but Western diplomats say the arrests of thousands
of opposition activists in recent months and harassment of
politicians like Ms. Suu Kyi shed doubt on the election's potential
fairness.
   Sources in Ms. Suu Kyi's party said it plans to appeal its
candidate's disqualification to the Election Commission's central
five-man body.
   The challenge to Ms. Suu Kyi's candidacy was raised by Labang
Grong, a candidate for the the National Unity Party running in the
same Rangoon constituency.
   The National Unity Party is the successor to the Burma Socialist
Program Party, which ruled for 26 years and has close ties to the
military government.
   Grong contended that Ms. Suu Kyi was not eligible because she
was entitled to the rights of a foreign citizen and had links with
a rebel student group. She is married to a Briton but holds a
Burmese passport.
   The decision has not been officially announced.
   In the last multiparty election in 1960, U Nu was elected prime
minister. He was ousted in 1962, the beginning of one-party
military rule.
   U Nu was put under house arrest last month and banned from
running in the May elections after he refused to dissolve a
parallel government formed at the height of the 1988 uprising.

<HEAD>Strong Quake Rattles Northern California; No Injuries Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EUREKA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No injuries or serious damage was reported
after a strong earthquake struck the Northern California coast.
   Residents described Tuesday's temblor, which registered 5.3 on
the Richter scale, as a slow, rolling motion that built up to
lateral shaking.
   The quake hit at 12:08 p.m. and was centered about 50 miles
south of Eureka, according to the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo
Park.
   ``It seemed long and just kind of weaving. It wasn't real, real
strong here,'' said a Eureka Police Department employee who only
identified herself as Diana.
   The quake was felt along the coast from Point Arena near the
Oregon border, south to Willits, about 130 miles north of San
Francisco.
   Residents in the small town of Petrolia reported items being
knocked off shelves, but there was no other damage, state officials
said. Petrolia is near a land formation known as Punta Gorda,
almost directly where the San Andreas Fault enters the Pacific.
   The Oct. 17 San Francisco Bay area quake measured 7.1 on the
Richter scale and killed 67 people, injured 3,000 and caused $7
billion in damage.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in the strength of the shaking.
   A magnitude-5 quake can cause considerable damage.

<HEAD>China To Amend Policy of Forced Separations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China plans to amend its unpopular practice of
forcing some married couples to live and work in separate cities,
an official newspaper said today.
   The China Daily said the State Council, China's Cabinet, has
worked out a policy to help the 300,000 state-employed couples now
living apart get back together.
   Most Chinese are assigned jobs by the state after finishing
school, and job placement officials in the past have routinely sent
young married couples to different cities.
   Changing jobs and obtaining a residency permit in the more
comfortable larger cities is extremely difficult, and many couples
have been forced to spend much of their married life living apart.
   Senior intellectuals will be given priority in receiving
permission to rejoin spouses, the China Daily said. People with
doctorates or those involved in high technology jobs will
automatically qualify for relocation.
   The Personnel Ministry said that in the future all university
graduates who are engaged to be married should be assigned to the
same city.
   The ministry said it is asking married couples to join in
smaller cities rather than wait for permission to unite in
overcrowded larger cities.
   It said 1 million couples were separated when the government
first confronted the problem a decade ago, and the practice of
sending couples to different cities has been a large financial
burden to the state.
   Separated couples are allowed three to four weeks off a year to
visit their spouses, with all travel expenses paid. The state loses
10 million paid work days and must budget $468 million for the
visits.

<HEAD>Unusual Heart Condition Mistaken For Psychiatric Disorder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of American women are being
misdiagnosed as suffering from psychiatric disorders when they are
in fact suffering from an unusual form of heart disease, a
researcher says.
   The women, who have chest pain but no signs of heart disease by
conventional tests, are suffering from a treatable disorder of the
small arteries, said Dr. Richard Cannon of the National Heart Lung
and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md.
   ``Many have been mislabeled as neurotic or hysterical women,''
Cannon said Tuesday. ``They truly have a pain syndrome.''
   Cannon said the disorder afflicts up to 100,000 Americans each
year, most of them women.
   Among their symptoms is a condition Cannon calls ``sensitive
heart,'' in which they experience sharp pain when test probes are
threaded into arteries near their hearts.
   Such probes usually are painless, said Cannon, who described his
research at the American Heart Association's annual science
writers' forum.
   Cannon's studies have shown that many of the patients are
suffering from a disorder he calls microvascular angina, in which
blood flow may be blocked in very tiny arteries that nourish the
heart.
   The arteries are too small to show up on angiograms, in which
dye is injected into the larger coronary arteries to look for
blockages, he said. The condition has sometimes been called
``syndrome X,'' because its cause was unknown.
   It may be common in men, but occurs in middle age and later when
many men have already developed coronary artery blockages. Those
blockages hide underlying microvascular angina, Cannon said.
   A variety of treatments exist to relieve the pain and many are
standard heart drugs, Cannon said.
   The patients are identified in part because they have reduced
flow of blood to the heart, Cannon said.
   Studies have shown that the patients appear to have a disorder
of the so-called ``smooth muscle'' in arteries. The smooth muscle
causes arteries to tighten and relax as they help regulate blood
pressure and blood flow.
   The patients are unusually sensitive to drugs that constrict the
blood vessels, and somewhat insensitive to drugs that relax blood
vessels, Cannon said.
   They also commonly have disorders of the esophagus and an
asthma-like condition in the bronchial tubes. The esophagus and the
bronchial tubes contain smooth muscle.
   The disorder could be caused by some defect in the smooth muscle
itself, or it could be a problem in the portions of the brain and
nervous system that regulate the contraction and relaxation of
smooth muscle, Cannon said.
   Although microvascular angina is not a psychiatric condition,
some psychiatric drugs appear to relieve the chest pain, perhaps
because they alleviate a disorder in the nervous system's
regulation of the smooth muscle, Cannon said.
   His current hypothesis is that the condition may be the result
of improper signals sent from the body to the brain, or a problem
in the brain's analysis of those signals.
   Panic attacks, anxiety and depression can be seen in some
patients with microvascular angina, but ``the vast majority of
people I see are put together pretty well psychologically,'' Cannon
said.

<HEAD>Mexican Officials Look into Claims Murdered U.S. Agent was Corrupt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government, stung by American TV
depictions of corrupt Mexican officials who aid drug traffickers,
says it is looking into claims that a murdered U.S. drug agent
actually was in league with traffickers. President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari, meanwhile, put on a hastily arranged memorial service
for 44 Mexican narcotics agents killed in the line of duty in the
last 13 months.
   ``The first condition for attacking narcotics trafficking is to
dismantle and destroy the networks of corruption that protect it,''
Salinas said at the memorial Tuesday at Mexico City's airport.
   Mexico has been embarassed and angered by the NBC miniseries
``Drug Wars,'' which was broadcast early this month.
   The miniseries, based on the 1985 killing of U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena, showed corrupt
Mexican officials aiding narcotics traffickers and thwarting the
investigation of Camarena's murder.
   Comments on NBC News programs that followed the miniseries
suggested the corruption that allowed Camarena to be killed has not
gone away.
   Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said Mexican
officials had no independent corroboration of press reports that
Camarena was working with drug traffickers, although those reports
first appeared in a government news service dispatch.
   ``We are checking the basis of those reports,'' said Alvarez,
who refused to give further details in a brief encounter with
reporters.
   The reports, which involved marijuana busts in northwestern
Mexico, have been angrily denied by U.S. officials.
   Salinas has made an effort to remove drug trafficking as an
irritant in U.S.-Mexican relations, winning praise from U.S.
officials for vigorously pursuing drug traffickers.
   He did not mention the controversy over the NBC miniseries in
his speech, but before an audience of about 400 agents and family
members of the dead he emphasized that eliminating corruption was a
key to defeating drug traffickers.
   ``We do not deny our problems, nor do we look for excuses for
our errors,'' Salinas said.
   ``Although the great majority of our agents have demonstrated
great valor in fighting drug trafficking, I repeat, we will
energetically punish those who involve themselves in drug
trafficking,'' he said.
   Elaine Shannon, author of the book ``Desperados,'' on which the
NBC miniseries was based, said Mexican authorities began attacking
Camarena's integrity in 1985 in order to divert attention from
themselves, and even tried to set up a fake bank account to prove
Camarena took dirty money.
   Law enforcement sources said Camarena may have been involved in
activities common to U.S. agents that are technically illegal in
Mexico, such as allowing informants to operate freely for the sake
of gaining information and bagging bigger game.
   Opposition leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas added some political heat
to the ``Drug Wars'' controversy by saying the Mexican government
allows U.S. agents to operate too freely in Mexico, although he
said he did not know the details of their activities.
   Even Gabriel Garcia Marquez, a winner of the Nobel prize for
literature, got into the act.
   ``Mexico's response to the defamation of the country was weak
and inadequate, because it attacks not only this country but all of
Latin America,'' said Marquez, according to the Excelsior news
service. Marquez is a Colombian national but lives here.
   On Monday, a local radio station broadcast called for a
demonstration at the local NBC office, but none materialized.
   The Salinas administration crackdown has resulted in the seizure
of 36 tons of cocaine in the 13 months Salinas has been in office _
more than was seized the previous 10 years _ and the shutdown of
several major cocaine smuggling operations.
   The memorial service, staged at a hangar used by the attorney
general's office, was broadcast live on Mexican television and
given wide play on news broadcasts.
   Placards listed the accomplishments of the Salinas
administration, and several airplanes and helicopters used for
surveillance and herbicide spraying were on display.
   Drug kingpins Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo
were sentenced in December to 40 years in prison without parole for
the Camarena murder, but an investigation continues in the United
States and further indictments are expected.
   Mexican and U.S. officials say the controversy has not affected
working relations between the two governments, especially in
narcotics.

   A drug kingpin whose arrest in Honduras
sparked anti-American riots was sentenced to life in prison without
possibility of parole, closing one of the West Coast's largest
cocaine trafficking cases.
   Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, 45, was sentenced Tuesday by U.S.
District Judge Pamela Ann Rymer, ending an odyssey that began in
1988 when Honduran police raided his Tegucigalpa home at dawn and
swiftly extradited him to the United States.
   ``Matta is considered one of the godfathers who established the
Colombian cocaine connection,'' said John Zienter, special agent in
charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration in Los Angeles.
   ``His sentencing sends a message to the primary individuals
involved that no matter how high up they are _ and believe me,
Matta was among the highest _ they are not safe from dedicated law
enforcement officers.''
   Matta was in the custody of U.S. marshals, who were expected to
transport him to a maximum-security prison, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Manuel Medrano.
   Prosecutors said Matta headed a powerful cocaine cartel based in
Cali, Colombia, which funneled tons of cocaine through Mexico to
the United States.
   Matta moved almost 600 pounds of cocaine with a street value of
more than $73 million through Arizona and Southern California,
prosecutors said.
   In a presentencing memorandum filed last month, Medrano
described Matta as ``perhaps the most significant trafficker in
custody in the world to date.''
   Matta's lawyer, Martin Stolar, portrayed his client as a
legitimate businessman and one of Honduras' largest private
employers.
   Stolar has 10 days to notify the court if he intends to appeal
the sentence.
   Matta's extradition from Honduras triggered deadly riots in his
homeland. Some 2,000 Hondurans burned the U.S. Embassy annex, and
five people were killed in the week-long disturbances.
   Attorneys for Matta said he was kidnaped from Honduras, which
has no extradition treaty with the United States.
   But federal courts have upheld extraditions, Medrano said.
   Matta was convicted in September on seven criminal counts that
included conspiracy, possession and distribution of narcotics and
running a criminal enterprise.
   The case centered on a September 1981 DEA raid at a suburban Van
Nuys apartment that netted $1.9 million in cash and 114 pounds of
cocaine, at that time the largest seizure of the drug in state
history.
   Coded ledgers that were seized in the raid were traced back to a
shadowy figure called ``El Negro,'' who was identified as Matta by
Hector Barona Becerra, an admitted drug
trafficker-turned-government witness.

<HEAD>Rumor Sets Back Stocks, Dollar Inches Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another rumor about the Soviet leader set back the
Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index today just as it was recovering
from a major two-day plunge, and the dollar inched down against the
Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 29.22
points, or 0.08 percent, closing at 36,821.14.
   After losing more than 650 points on each of the last two
trading days, the index gained 360.66 points in this morning's
trading, responding favorably to a 23.25-point overnight gain in
the Dow Jones industrial average in New York.
   But then it turned down as the market looked for a continued
decline in Japanese government bond prices, and received another
setback from a recurring rumor that Mikhail S. Gorbachev was
resigning, said Kazuhiro Nomura, a dealer with New Japan Securities
Co.
   Nomura said the rumor, generated in the bond market, was
transmitted to the stock market, and the Nikkei fell.
   Bond prices, however, rose 0.21 points today, their first
increase this year after an eight-session slide that had pushed the
yield up about one percentage point from last year.
   Dealers have pointed to the slumping bond price as a major
factor in the Nikkei's decline of more than 2,000 points, or 5.4
percent, since ending last year at 38,915.87, a record high. But
amid general pessimism, rumors and speculation have been moving the
market, they say.
   Commenting recently on the rumors, Yamaichi Securities analyst
Kenji Maeshiro said, ``Gorbachev will probably have to die a
thousand times in such rumors this year,'' besides supposedly
resigning.
   Analysts say investors push such rumors in an attempt to
manipulate prices for profit-taking.
   ``The market this morning finally began to think that the Nikkei
had already hit the bottom and would start recovering, but it is
still vulnerable and is super-sensitive to pessimistic rumors,''
Nomura said.
   After substantial buying in the morning session, many investors
sold back issues for profit-taking, followed by massive selling by
Solomon Brothers, a major foreign securities firm, shortly before
the afternoon session ended, Nomura said.
   Trading was thin, with an estimated 550 million shares changing
hands on the first section.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 145.52 yen, down 0.23
yen from Tuesday's 145.75-yen finish. It opened at 145.40 yen and
ranged between 145.37 yen and 145.55 yen.
   Although trading was calm as many market players awaited the
release of U.S. trade figures for November, due to be announced
later today, ``the dollar was basically getting stronger,'' said
Yoshitsugu Hanada, a trader with Mitsui Bank.
   He added that the yen's weakness will continue to affect
government bond prices.
   ``There is no immediate need to buy the yen now, because of
uncertainties ahead of the major election,'' he said, referring to
nationwide balloting for Parliament's upper house next month.
   Some $3.67 billion changed hands in spot trading today.

   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said he knows many
Massachusetts' residents feel angered and betrayed by his
presidential loss and the damage it did to the state.
   ``It's clear to me now that I underestimated the amount of time
and energy it takes to seek the modern presidency. Trying to do two
jobs at the same time was more difficult and more grueling than I
expected,'' Dukakis said in his final State of the State speech
Tuesday.
   ``And I underestimated the toll it would take on my family,
too.''
   Dukakis' wife, Kitty, entered an alcoholism treatment program
shortly after his loss.
   Mrs. Dukakis received a standing ovation and perhaps the warmest
applause of the evening when she stepped onto a balcony to watch
her husband's address.
   Dukakis said he won the Democratic presidential nomination
``swept up by the excitement and euphoria'' of what he called the
``Massachusetts Miracle.''
   ``But a funny thing happened on the road to the White House. I
ran a great campaign for the primary, and a lousy one for the
final,'' Dukakis said. ``I lost, and in the process Massachusetts
took an unfair beating. And I feel terrible about it.
   ``I know that many of you are angry with me. Feel betrayed. Feel
that I put myself before you and the commonwealth,'' Dukakis said
Tuesday.
   ``But there comes a time _ and I believe it has arrived _ that
nobody's interest, and certainly not the public's, is served by
laying on more blame,'' Dukakis said.
   The 56-year-old governor is serving the last year of his third,
four-year term. He announced early last year that he would not seek
re-election.
   Dukakis repeated his call for new taxes to solve the state's
nagging fiscal problems, but said he was optimistic about the
future of Massachusetts and of New England, both of which are
suffering economic declines.
   The state Legislature still has not balanced the state's $12
billion budget, which is about $500 million in the red.
   Many legislators, including Republicans, praised the speech.
   ``I admire him for making the admissions that he did. I wish he
had done it a year ago,'' said Senate Minority Leader David Locke.
   After the speech, the governor and his wife greeted lobbyists,
state workers and other well-wishers. Mrs. Dukakis looked thin, and
was less ebullient than she has been in past appearances. But the
old warmth returned when she hugged friends and cooed over an
infant.
   ``I'm feeling much better, thank you _ glad to be here,'' she
said when asked about her health.
   Mrs. Dukakis said she is not sad to see the governor's term come
to an end.
   ``I think 12 years _ 12 times is enough,'' she said, referring
to the number of times the governor has given a State of the State
address. ``I'm just grateful for all the wonderful experiences.''

   A pilot accused of flying drug money from Fort
Lauderdale to Panama was part of an illegal alien-smuggling ring
led by Manuel Antonio Noriega, prosecutors say.
   The accusations came Tuesday during a bond hearing for a Noriega
co-defendant and raised the possibility the deposed Panamanian
dictator could face new charges.
   Myles Malman, a deputy assistant U.S. attorney, told a
magistrate the government has evidence that the Panamanian pilot,
Eduardo Pardo, was involved in Noriega-led ring that smuggled
illegal aliens into the United States.
   Asked whether there would be any new charges against Noriega,
U.S. attorney's spokeswoman Diane Cossin refused to comment, saying
any discussion of the new alien-smuggling accusations would be
premature.
   Pardo, 44, was denied bond by U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff,
who agreed with prosecutors that he was a risk to flee the United
States.
   A separate bond hearing for another Noriega co-defendant, Lt.
Col. Luis del Cid, who was identified by authorities as a former
head of Noriega's secret police and one of his right-hand men, was
to resume today.
   Del Cid, 46, has pleaded innocent to charges of collecting bribe
money and acting as a liaison between Noriega and drug traffickers
who allegedly used Panama as a conduit for drug shipments to the
United States.
   If convicted on all counts, del Cid could be sentenced to 70
years in prison and fined $550,000.
   His wife, 34-year-old Tilsa Jimenez del Cid, appealed to Judge
William Hoeveler to release her husband until his trial, saying
their children rely on him for their education and religious
training.
   ``I don't recall him ever going to bed without saying a
prayer,'' she testified.
   Mrs. del Cid denied that her husband led Panama's ``G-2'' secret
police and said he had nothing to do with drug trafficking.
   Del Cid's lawyer, Samuel Burstyn, complained in a motion filed
Tuesday that prosecutors haven't complied with Hoeveler's Dec. 26
order to allow him access to evidence against del Cid.
   ``The case against Lieutenant Colonel del Cid is a very thin one
and apparently rests entirely upon the uncorroborated hearsay
statements of Floyd Carlton Caceres,'' Burstyn wrote in the motion.
   Testimony by Carlton, a former confidant of Noriega, provided
the basis for much of the indictment and the convicted drug pilot
is expected to be the prime witness against Noriega at his
drug-smuggling trial.
   Outside the courtroom, a Noriega attorney, Steven Kollin, said
he would need at least a year and possibly two to prepare for trial.

<HEAD>Artery Balloon Helps Save Legs From Amputation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tiny inflatable balloon that can open
arteries plugged with cholesterol could replace up to 30 percent of
the 110,000 operations done each year to help save legs from
amputation, a researcher says.
   The blockage of arteries in the legs is the result of hardening
of the arteries, or atherosclerosis. When atherosclerosis occurs in
the arteries that nourish the heart, it leads to a heart attack.
When it occurs in the leg arteries, it can lead to gangrene and
amputation.
   Blockages in leg arteries are treated with bypass surgery
analogous to heart bypass operations. The leg operations are
performed on about 110,000 Americans a year. Another 100,000
Americans undergo amputations of legs, feet or toes each year, said
Dr. Eric Martin of Columbia University, who presented his findings
Tuesday at the American Heart Association's annual science writers'
forum.
   Wider use in the leg arteries of the balloon technique could
save $300 million to $400 million a year, Martin said. Similar
balloons are being used in lieu of heart bypass surgery in the
coronary arteries that nourish the heart.
   The balloon procedure, called angioplasty, is as effective as
surgery in leg arteries, Martin said. Depending upon which leg
artery develops the blockage, unblocked arteries have a 65 percent
to 90 percent chance of remaining unblocked for at least five years
after angioplasty, he said.
   Limb problems often occur in diabetics, whose arteries are more
likely to become clogged. In most cases, atherosclerosis in the
legs does not occur until after blockages already have produced
heart and kidney disease, Martin said.
   Limb problems therefore are limited mostly to elderly patients.
   Three new techniques may one day improve upon surgery and
angioplasty, Martin said, but as yet they are unproven.
   The use of tiny rotors to cut away blockages inside arteries is
still in its infancy, but the technique may cut in half the rate of
recurrence of blockages, compared to angioplasty, Martin said.
   Lasers that are designed to burn away the blockages have been
disappointing so far, he said. They are also extremely expensive.
The machine costs $100,000.
   As with angioplasty and the tiny rotors, the laser machine uses
a catheter, or small tube, which is threaded through the arteries
until it reaches the site of the blockage. The laser catheters cost
$600 apiece and must be discarded after a single use, Martin said.
   A third new technique is the opening of blockages with stents,

   Initial results are good, Martin said, but the stents can

   More than 11,000 newly arrived troops struggled
today to end battles between bands of Azerbaijanis and Armenians,
who reportedly were armed with everything from submachine guns and
grenades to commandeered artillery.
   The official death toll from the clashes in the southern
republic of Azerbaijan stood at 56, mostly Armenians, and new
clashes were reported.
   Azerbaijanis staged protests in their republic's capital, Baku,
and elsewhere to demand they be armed and allowed to defend their
claim to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, an
predominantly Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan, newspapers and
officials said today.
   In bordering Armenia to the west, people were still breaking
into police stations and other arms repositories in search of
weapons, said Dmitri Seleznyov, an Interior Ministry spokesman in
Moscow.
   Seleznyov said that in the past 24 hours there had been 64
attacks on Armenian homes in Baku, where the bloodletting exploded
Saturday night with mob attacks on Armenians. ``It's a terrible
thing,'' he said.
   The Armenian news agency, Armenpress, said some 1,500 refugees
were arriving daily in the Armenian capital of Yerevan.
   On Tuesday, the official Tass news agency said 2,000 people
armed with anti-aircraft guns and other artillery were massing on
hills around Nagorno-Karabakh, the flashpoint for the neighboring
groups' ethnic hatreds.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev declared a state of emergency in
the strife-torn mountain area Monday night, empowering the
government to deploy units of the Soviet army, navy and KGB to
protect lives and guard vital installations such as railroads.
   More than 6,000 additional internal security troops were sent
Tuesday to reinforce existing Interior Ministry detachments, Tass
said. To assist them, more than 5,000 Red Army soldiers, who
traditionally carry heavier weaponry, also were dispatched, Tass
said.
   Soviet media did not say how many troops already were in the
region.
   Tass said that in Armenia, ``demands are being made to arm
citizens and send them to Nagorno-Karabakh.'' The government
newspaper Izvestia reported 16 attacks on weapons depots in 24
hours by Armenians seeking guns.
   The troops have been instructed to get tougher with the
fighters, Seleznyov said, and soldiers opened fire Tuesday when an
armed group tried to take five armored personnel carriers near the
village of Tazikend.
   ``Since then, attempts to take APCs have stopped, because before
this they weren't used to having weapons used against them,'' he
said by telephone.
   Combatants in the Nagorno-Karabakh region had seized stores of
hand grenades, the Interior Ministry said.
   The flareup is the most violent between mainly Moslem
Azerbaijanis and mostly Christian Armenians since their decades-old
feud over Nagorno-Karabakh erupted in bloody clashes two years ago.
   The enclave has been ruled by Azerbaijan since 1923 and the
current troubles were sparked by its demand in February 1988 to be
annexed by Armenia.
   Internal security troops already in the region have been
incapable of halting the most protracted ethnic conflict in
Gorbachev's nearly five-year tenure as Kremlin leader.
   ``We can't bring ourselves to pronounce it out loud, but what is
happening now ... can unambiguously be termed a civil war,''
correspondent O. Shapovalov wrote in the newspaper Komsomolskaya
Pravda.
   The Bush administration supported Gorbachev's use of troops in
the region, known as the southern Caucasus, and criticized feuding
Azerbaijanis and Armenians for ``revisiting old ethnic hatreds.''
   The Kremlin's emergency decree empowers local officials to ban
demonstrations and strikes, impose curfews, censor the media,
confiscate weapons, disband unofficial organizations and detain
people for up to 30 days. Interior Ministry officials said they
could not recall such measures being imposed in the country since
World War II.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, denied the
decree was a backtracking of Gorbachev's reforms, which have led to
greater openness and liberalization of society since he became
Soviet leader in March 1985.
   ``I would not interpret this step as being at odds with glasnost
and democracy,'' Gerasimov said. ``On the contrary, the step
opposes anarchy.''
   Spokesman Vladimir A. Yanchenkov of the Interior Ministry, which
is in charge of police affairs, said in Moscow Tuesday that the
death toll in the Caucasus had reached 56 in Azerbaijan, with 156
people injured.
   Two of the dead were members of law enforcement agencies, he
said. Most of the victims were Armenians, the ministry said.
   Yanchenkov said authorities had recorded 167 ``pogroms,''
meaning ethnic attacks, and cases of arson.
   In Saturday night's anti-Armenian riots in Baku, people were
reported burned alive and a witness said women were thrown from
apartment windows.
   Fighting rapidly spread to Nagorno-Karabakh and nearby areas of
Azerbaijan, with the belligerants using helicopters, armored
vehicles, machine guns and other arms seized from government
arsenals or offered by compatriots.
   Soviet TV on Tuesday showed Interior Ministry troops firing in
the air as they rode in armored personnel carrier through an
Azerbaijani village near Nagorno-Karabakh to enforce the emergency
decree.
   The ministry said the Azerbaijani People's Front, a grassroots
political group that has organized anti-Armenian protests, was
preventing arriving troop reinforcements from traveling to battle
areas by blocking roads.
   In Nagorno-Karabakh, about 26,000 people _ about a sixth of the
population _ had been detained and nearly 3,000 firearms and other
weapons confiscated since the conflict began, Izvestia said.
   Azerbaijanis were said Tuesday to be continuing a virtual rail
blockade of Armenia's 3.5 million people, cutting short fuel and
other supplies. Azerbaijan has 6.9 million people.
   In Baku, detachment of security troops patrolled the city and
armored vehicles moved through the suburbs of the Caspian Sea port,
Azerbaijani activist Alesker Siyabov said by telephone.
   Tass said 2,000 Armenians were evacuated by ferry and plane from
Baku, an oil-producing center of 1.7 million.
   Of the 220,000 Armenians who lived there before the strife over
Nagorno-Karabakh began, only a few thousand remain, it said.
   In February 1988, Azerbaijanis went on an anti-Armenian rampage
in the industrial city of Sumgait, near Baku, and 32 people, mostly
Armenians, were killed.

<HEAD>Najib Gov't Sees Progress in National Reconciliation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN WILDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Najib's government claims to
have made tangible gains in its 3-year-old program of national
reconciliation even though it has not succeeded in ending the
country's protracted civil war.
   Government officials acknowledge that fighting between their
Soviet-armed troops and U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas continues to
claim heavy tolls in life and property.
   But they also claim to be achieving success through a campaign
of offering amnesty to any guerrillas who surrender and cash for
their weapons.
   Najib, former head of the feared KHAD secret police, launched
his national reconciliation program in January 1987 with the first
of a series of short-lived cease-fires that have been routinely
rejected by the mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors.
   ``The last three years have been really difficult and full of
problems because of the enemies of national reconciliation, but we
have made a number of fruitful gains,'' government spokesman Naquib
Sameer said.
   He asserted that ``70 percent of armed opposition commanders
have laid down their weapons and joined national reconciliation.''
   Guerrilla leaders based across the border in Pakistan admit that
some of their fighters in Afghanistan have struck deals with
Najib's government, but they say the majority are still fighting.
   Azim Nasser-Zia, spokesman for the National Islamic Front of
Afghanistan, one of the seven Pakistan-based mujahedeen factions,
scoffed at Sameer's claim.
   ``Maybe 70 percent of the mujahedeen have taken Najib's arms and
money _ but only to use it against him,'' he said.
   Kabul officials claim that 168 ``armed opposition groups'' have
joined Najib's national reconciliation process and that an
additional 351 groups have signed cease-fire agreements.
   These officials estimate that between 30,000 and 40,000
mujahedeen are still fighting the Najib government, whose combat
troops number about 50,000.
   Mujahedeen leaders, however, claim they have a fighting force of
150,000, who move freely in much of the Afghan countryside but have
failed to capture a single major city in the nearly 12-year-old
civil war.
   The mujahedeen denounce Najib's People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan as ``Godless communists,'' and steadfastly refuse to
enter into any power-sharing arrangements.
   Abdul Rahim, spokesman for the mujahedeen news agency MIDIA,
said battlefield reports contradict Najib's claims of massive
support for the reconciliation process.
   ``If anyone has joined the communists, it's because they were
communists before,'' Rahim said. ``The real mujahedeen commander
would never join Najib.''
   The Afghan war started in 1978 when the People's Democratic
Party seized power in a military coup and embarked upon the Marxist
policies that Najib now seeks to disavow.
   In 1979, internal rivalries spurred another military coup within
the party. By December 1979, Soviet troops swooped in to install
yet a third Marxist government and stayed on to fight the growing
mujahedeen insurgency.
   The Red Army managed only a stalemate before withdrawing its
troops over a nine-month period that ended last February.
   Najib has since been massively supplied by Moscow with weapons
and food but has not achieved a military victory over the fierce
mountain guerrillas.
   But he has foiled American and other Western predictions that
his government would quickly tumble once the Soviets withdrew their
direct combat support.
   More than 5 million Afghans _ one-third of the country's pre-war
population _ remain huddled in squalid refugee camps across the
border in Pakistan and Iran. By the Kabul government's own
estimates, fewer than 5 percent have ventured home in the past
three years.

<HEAD>Investigators Blame Fatal Fire on Smoldering Cigarette</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A smoldering cigarette apparently
caused a Christmas Eve fire that killed 16 people at a retirement
center, according to investigators who don't expect criminal
charges.
   The fire began in the first-floor apartment of Georgia Jones,
who was described as a chain smoker by other residents of the John
Sevier Retirement Center, officials said Tuesday.
   A senior state arson investigator, Johnny Robertson, and other
investigators held a news conference to discuss their findings, but
they did not say whether Ms. Jones, 67, was home at the time of the
fire.
   ``All other causes were eliminated,'' said Robert Frost, a fire
investigator for the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance.
   ``We didn't find anything that would allow us to eliminate it
(smoking),'' Frost said.
   The fire, the second fatal blaze in two months at the 10-floor
center, spread to the second floor and parts of the third floor and
smoke permeated the building before flames were brought under
control.
   Dozens of the 145 residents were injured and 16 were killed.
   In October, a 76-year-old resident died of smoke inhalation in a
fire at the center.
   Prosecutor David Crockett said he plans to present the case to a
Washington County grand jury next month.
   ``I would be surprised if there will be any criminal
prosecution,'' he said.
   Lawsuits for three victims have been filed against the
building's owners and managers.

<HEAD>Island Blackened By Mystery Slick, Anti-Pollution Team Sent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VILA BALEIRA, Madeira Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents on the tiny
Atlantic island of Porto Santo used shovels and buckets to battle a
mysterious 12-mile-long oil slick that blackened beaches and
threatened a valuable nature reserve.
   Help was sent to the Portuguese island on Tuesday, when the
Lisbon government sent an air force transport plane carrying an
anti-pollution team armed with floating barriers, pumps and other
equipment to combat the slick.
   Since Monday, patches of oil have washed up on the vacation
island's famous six-mile white sand beach on the south coast, while
more crude coated the rocky north and east coasts with thick slime.
   Some of the island's residents, using shovels and buckets to
fight the slick, said the oil-soaked corpses of gulls, turtles and
fish washed onto the island.
   The slick off the coast stretched over 12 miles, posing a threat
to the water supply for the 5,000 residents of Porto Santo and to a
nature reserve on the uninhabited Desertas islands 37 miles to the
south.
   The origin of the oil slick was still undetermined.
   Portuguese Navy officers said it was unlikely the crude came
from the Iranian tanker Khark 5, which leaked more than 70,000 tons
into the Atlantic in the area in December, the Lusa news agency
reported.
   The oil that washed up this week was dense and black, suggesting
a more recent leak. Oil that has been in the sea longer turns
yellowish and foamy, the report said.
   In a Portugese television interview, a merchant marine official
said the oil could have been dumped from a number of tankers which
passed along the busy sea lanes off the Madeira Islands.
   The volcanic islands, famed for their rocky beauty and
sub-tropical climate, are about 625 miles southwest of Lisbon and
about 435 miles west of the Moroccan coast.
   Madeira biologist Manuel Biscoito told Lusa he was worried the
damage the slick could cause to the Desertas.
   The craggy islands are home to a variety of rare maritime
animals, including one of the world's last breeding colonies of the
Mediterranean monk seal, an endangered marine mammal.
   Madeira Island itself, the largest member of the achipelago and
a major winter vacation destination, was not immediately threatened
by the slick, officials said, but could come into danger if wind
directions changed.
   An emergency meeting of the Madeira Regional Government called
to discuss the situation was alerted to the threat to drinking
water on Porto Santo.
   The islanders take 80 percent of their drinking water from
desalination plants drawing water from the sea. The pumps supplying
sea water to the system would have to be stopped if the slick
approached the intake area, officials said.

   A strong earthquake jolted western
Australia today, less than a month after a tremor of equal strength
shook the eastern seaboard. There were no reports of damage or
injuries.
   Today's quake, measureing 5.5 on the Richter scale, was felt in
Perth, the capital of Western Australia state, and as far away as
Albany, 280 miles to the south, seismologists said.
   State Emergency Service spokesman Keith Harraway said there were
no reports of damage or injuries. Perth is one of the world's most
isolated cities and Western Australia is mainly desert.
   In the country's first fatal earthquake, 12 people were killed
on Dec. 28 in the city of Newcastle. The industrial center and the
country's sixth biggest city is still assessing the cost, with
hundreds of buildings suffering structural damage.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. An earthquake of 5 on the scale can cause
considerable damage.

   Spring-like temperatures today were expected to surpass average
readings for January by more than 25 degrees from the Gulf states
to southern New England. Showers, thunderstorms and fog stretched
from the Gulf Coast through the Ohio Valley.
   The Southeast also was expected to enjoy sunny, warm weather.
   Chicago reveled in relative balminess Tuesday. On what is
normally the city's coldest day of the year, the mercury hit a
record 57 degrees. Tuesday's rain helped clear the air of a dense
fog that socked in Chicago's airports for hours.
   A cold front moved into the Mississsippi Valley, spawning
showers near the Gulf of Mexico and in the Midwest.
   Snow mixed with freezing rain fell over the Northern Plains
early today.
   Rain over the lower Great Lakes extended across east-central New
York state and central New England. Rain turned to snow in the
higher elevations of central New England.
   Rainshowers and thunderstorms also extended from Nebraska to
Mississippi.
   Tuesday thunderstorms left hail in parts of Illinois and
Oklahoma. Small hail also accompanied thunderstorms in California's
lower Sacramento Valley on Tuesday.
   By late afternoon Tuesday, 6 to 10 inches of snow had fallen in
the mountains near Lake Tahoe, and up to 4 inches hit the
Reno-Carson City area in Nevada.
   Tuesday's high temperature for the nation was 85 at Naples, Fla.

   The dollar was little changed against major
foreign currencies this morning as traders awaited the release of
U.S. trade figures later in the day, dealers said.
   Gold prices were lower.
   Traders said Tuesday's spurt of dollar-buying in the wake of
unrest in the Soviet Union and Eastern Germany was probably
overdone and premature.
   ``The problems Gorbachev is having are already factored into the
market,'' said Manfred Totzauer, vice president at Citibank AG in
Frankfurt. ``He'd have to fall before the dollar would do something
more substantial.''
   Some traders said concerns about the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe will ensure that the dollar remains fairly firm even if the
November U.S. trade figures are disappointing.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.23 yen to a closing 145.52 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 145.65 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.6955 West German marks, up from 1.6945
   _1.5105 Swiss francs, down from 1.5160
   _5.7685 French francs, up from 5.7635
   _1.9137 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9195
   _1,264.00 Italian lire, up from 1,261.50
   _1.1653 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1648
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.6455 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6560 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $410.00 a troy ounce,
down from $413.25 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $410.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $410.80, down from $413.00 bid late
Tuesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell $4.74 to close at a bid $409.03.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.23 a troy ounce, down
from Tuesday's $5.25.

<HEAD>Largest Anti-Apartheid Group To Defy Ban</HEAD>
<HEAD>By DAVID CRARY</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's largest
anti-apartheid coalition, forced to operate covertly since being
banned two years ago, announced today that it is resuming
full-scale, above-ground operations.
   The move is intended as a test of the white-led government's
professed commitment to reform.
   Senior leaders of the United Democratic Front, representing more
than 600 organizations with more than 2 million members, said they
would re-open offices across the country and begin planning for a
national conference in April.
   ``In what we see as a challenging period ahead of us, we have
decided to claim our rights to engage in open opposition
activity,'' Murphy Morobe, one of the coalition's chief spokesmen,
told a news conference. ``We owe it to our people that the
leadership of our movement is openly available at this crucial
moment in the struggle.''
   Morobe also said a delegation of 22 leaders of the front planned
to meet soon with Nelson Mandela, jailed leader of the African
National Congress guerrilla movement. Mandela is expected to be
released in the coming weeks after nearly 28 years in prison.
   The United Democratic Front, which shares the ANC's goals of a
non-racial democracy, was established in 1983 to mobilize
resistance to a new constitution that entrenched the exclusion of
the black majority from Parliament.
   Many leaders of the organization were detained for two to three
years after a nationwide state of emergency was declared in June
1986, and in February 1988 the government listed the front among 17
organizations prohibited from engaging in any activities.
   ``The emergency has hurt us and at some levels disorganized
us,'' said Azhar Cachalia, a member of the front's executive
commitee. ``But the the main purpose of the emergency, to smash the
UDF, has failed. We are probably stronger now than we have ever
been.''
   He said the decision to resume overt operations was intended as
a challenge to President F.W. de Klerk, who since taking office in
August has eased restrictions on anti-government protests and
invited black leaders to help negotiate a new constitution that
would extend some form of political rights to blacks.
   ``We are now, in a concrete way, beginning to test his
intentions and his commitment to a new South Africa,'' Cachalia
said.
   Morobe said no date had yet been set for the meeting between
front leaders and Mandela, who has been conferring at his prison
residence with government officials and prominent anti-apartheid
activists.
   ``We believe he is in a historically unique position that can
open up new possibilities and opportunities which can only advance
the cause of liberation,'' Morobe said.
   Morobe said the front and the ANC agree on the pre-conditions
needed before the two organizations will enter negotiations with
the government. These include the release of Mandela and other
political prisoners, lifting of the state of emergency, unbanning
of the ANC and other opposition groups, removal of soldiers from
black townships, and an end to political trials.
   Under apartheid, the country's 28 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   A high-ranking Soviet general
acknowledged today that political upheaval in Moscow's East
European allies will affect the structure of the Warsaw Pact
military alliance.
   ``There will be changes in structure,'' said Gen. Nikolaj
Chervov, head of the directorate of the Soviet general staff.
   He spoke to reporters on the second day of unprecedented talks
among the top officers of 35 nations about their military policies.
   The three-week meeting opened Tuesday with Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, and his Soviet
counterpart, Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, outlining the superpowers'
strategies. Officers from Poland, Czechoslovakia and East Germany
were scheduled to speak later today.
   Western military experts have been anxious to hear the East bloc
reports, hoping to learn more about how recent political events
will shape future policies of the seven-nation Warsaw Pact.
   Popular uprisings have driven out the hard-line Communist
leaderships in Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, East Germany, Romania and
Czechoslovakia.
   The United States and 15 of its allies belong to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Chervov, speaking through an interpreter, said the Warsaw Pact's
top governing body, the Political Consultative Committee, will
likely be disbanded.
   The panel is made up of the top Communist Party officials of the
seven nations.
   The fast pace of change in those countries, he said, has led to
``the multiplicity of parties.''
   ``The Communist Parties are no longer leading the states,'' he
said. ``Therefore, the Political Consultative Committee will
probably cease to exist of itself and perhaps there will be another
supreme body.''
   The new body, he said, could be made up of the heads of state of
those countries.
   He also said the top military officers in the Warsaw Pact
countries have ``confirmed their states will remain true to their
(alliance) obligations.'' Western officials have been looking for
hints of a dramatic weakening in the Warsaw Pact.
   On Tuesday, Sir David Craig, chief of the British defense staff,
said he did not see signs of a collapse in the seven-nation
alliance.
   ``Clearly, I think they would all recognize amongst the seven of
them that there are changes afoot,'' he said. ``But to talk about
the breakup of the (pact) was not the impression I was left with
today.''
   Moiseyev told the gathering the Soviet Union was trimming its
armed forces as part of plans to rework its military policies.
   The West contends the Soviets' powerful military might could
seize and hold foreign territory in time of war. The 16-nation
North Atlantic Treaty Organization argues its forces are the
minimum necessary to defend against an attack.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced in December 1988
plans to unilaterally slash 500,000 troops and reduce conventional,
or non-nuclear, arms substantially. Moiseyev said half the
reductions were carried out last year and the rest will be
completed in 1990.
   As of Jan. 1, he said, Soviet armed forces were down by 265,000.
He said 9,320 tanks, more than 5,050 artillery systems and 835
warplanes have been reduced in Europe.
   The military budget, he said, was cut by 8.2 percent last year
and will be pared by more than 14 percent in the next two years.
   ``We also intend, if the situation permits, to drastically, by
1.5 to 2 times, reduce the share of the national income's spending
on defense by 1995,'' he said.
   Craig said the West wanted to believe the Kremlin intends to
change its military policy.
   ``But,'' he said, ``there is a long way to go between intentions
and execution. We must wait and see how that execution is carried
out.''
   The meeting at Vienna's Hofburg Palace, the former imperial
residence, is part of negotiations on Confidence- and
Security-Building Measures, which are designed to reduce military
tensions in Europe.
   The United States, Canada and nearly all European nations are
taking part.

<HEAD>Namibia's Whites-Only Schools Admit Blacks For First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black and mixed-race children were
admitted to formerly whites-only schools for the first time today
as Namibia prepares to end South African rule and become
independent.
   Also today, police said that thousands of mortar rounds and
other munitions are being destroyed following the winding down of
the war between South African forces and nationalist guerrillas.
   Twenty-two black and mixed-race students enrolled at Centaurus
High School in Windhoek as the new school year began, school
officials said.
   A similar number of non-white applicants were refused admission
after failing English tests, they said.
   ``Aside from the normal requirements, regarding uniforms and
fees etc., our only requirement is that pupils must be able to
speak and understand English,'' said a school spokeswoman, who
declined to be named. ``It was just like any school enrollment on
the first day of term.''
   Education officials said they had no immediate figures on how
many blacks and mixed-race students were admitted today to formerly
all white schools in the territory.
   South African officials announced last week that whites-only
schools would be allowed to admit blacks for the first time this
year. Special schools and hospitals have been reserved exclusively
for whites in the past.
   South Africa is about to end its rule of Namibia following a
long bush war with the black nationalist South-West African Peoples
Organization, or SWAPO, which won elections in November and is to
head the government when independence is declared in the next few
weeks.
   South Africa had ruled Namibia, also known as South-West Africa,
since seizing the territory from Germany during World War I.
   Police officials said today that the munitions, including mortar
rounds, rocket-propelled grenades and land mines, were being
destroyed with explosives rather than returning them to South
Africa. The munitions were used by South African and allied
South-West African forces.
   Explosive experts this week detonated 4,000 South African-made
mortar rounds in one huge blast at Kwambi in the north of the
country.

<HEAD>Marshals Seize Home of Drug-Issuing Psychiatrist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. marshals, acting under a
federal law aimed at stripping drug dealers of their means of doing
business, seized the house of a 73-year-old psychiatrist accused of
illegally writing prescriptions there.
   Tuesday's seizure of the home of Henry Spitzer marked the first
use of the forfeiture statute against a doctor in California,
authorities said.
   Spitzer surrendered his license to practice last year after he
was charged with 16 felonies in 1988. Undercover agents had
concluded he was prescribing Valium and an amphetamine in cases
where it was not medically warranted.
   Federal law provides for the seizure of a home, car or other
property if the property was purchased with drug profits or used in
drug trafficking.
   ``He was practicing in his home, issuing prescriptions from
there, so this case met the test,'' said Dan Goldsmith, a senior
investigator for the state Medical Board, which worked with the
Drug Enforcement Administration on the case.
   ``We're breaking new ground here,'' Goldsmith said. ``This hits
them where it hurts _ in the wallet.''
   A Medical Board spokesman said Spitzer can remain in his
$150,000 house pending a hearing in court. If the seizure is
upheld, the house will be auctioned and the proceeds divided among
agencies that participated in the investigation.
   Under a 1989 plea bargain, Spitzer agreed to surrender his
medical license and pay restitution to the board in return for
dismissal of the criminal charges. But the board decided to pursue
seizure of the home.
   ``I think he figured this whole thing was over and done with,''
said police Lt. Lee Weigel.

<HEAD>Orchestra Percussion Section Walks Out After Mentor's Resignation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rhode Island Philharmonic's entire
percussion section quit after its leader was told he would be fired
unless his playing improved.
   George Goneconto, a 33-year veteran of the orchestra, said
Tuesday he resigned rather than fight a notice putting him on
probation. His decision led to the resignations last month of the
three other percussion members, all former students of the drummer.
   Conductor Andrew Massey, who sent warning letters to eight
members of the orchestra at the end of November, was in California
and could not be reached for comment.
   Philharmonic manager Karen Dobbs said the resignations ``just
added to the instability'' of the orchestra.
   ``If they end up with new people back there all the time, it's
very difficult,'' she said.
   Goneconto said he and Massey had a ``friendly discussion'' about
his performance in the fall, and he received the letter soon
afterward, which he called a ``complete shock.''
   Under the orchestra's contract with the Providence Federation of
Musicians, players who receive warning letters have until the end
of the season to improve. They can appeal to a panel of fellow
orchestra members, who can overrule Massey.
   Goneconto, 53, joined the Philharmonic when he was 18 and has
been the principal percussionist for 30 years.
   ``I felt it was time to look for warmer and comfortable places
to perform in, where the atmosphere is less confrontational,''
Goneconto said.
   Dobbs said she received letters from Goneconto, Bruce Dyer,
Ronald Stabile and John Beaulieu on Dec. 11, the day before
rehearsals began for the Christmas pops program. The musicians
offered no explanation for their resignations, she said.
   ``I just no longer wanted to be part of an organization like
that,'' Stabile said.
   Goneconto played the kettle drums for the orchestra, and the
three others played an array of instruments, including triangle,
marimba and cymbals.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanese media today clashed with
Christian Gen. Michel Aoun over his ban on recognizing President
Elias Hrawi, with newspapers and broadcasters calling a news strike
in protest of his orders.
   Aoun, who does not recognize the president or government chosen
under an Arab-brokered peace accord, issued a directive Tuesday
threatening to punish news organizations if they refer to the
Syrian-backed Hrawi as president and to Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem,
as prime minister.
   The army command of Gen. Emile Lahoud, which is loyal to Hrawi,
quickly responded by warning the media against applying Aoun's
directive or reporting any of his activity, terming him ``an
impostor.''
   The conservative daily Ad-Diyar defied Aoun's ban in a
front-page editorial by publisher-editor Charles Ayoub.
   Following Aoun's instructions, he wrote, would mean
``suffocation ... it is a serious beginning to limit the freedom of
the press.''
   Ayoub's article was repeatedly broadcast by Moslem radio
stations operating in west Beirut, which is outside Aoun's control.
   Aoun's 20,000 troops control the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave which includes Beirut's eastern sector and a narrow strip
northeast of the capital.
   The nation's most prestigious newspaper An-Nahar, based in
Moslem west Beirut, failed to publish in an apparent protest of the
ban.
   And Christian radio and television stations observed a news
strike for a second day to express rejection of Aoun's orders, but
have avoided a direct confrontation with him.
   Aoun, in a statement released by his office, said Attorney
General Joseph Fraiha was instructed to take ``legal action''
against Ad-Diyar, which operates in an area controlled by Aoun's
troops.
   The short statement did not clarify what legal action would be
taken, but Aoun told newspaper editors Tuesday that violators of
his instructions would be ``dealt with legally not under the press
law but under the (criminal) code.''
   The leftist As-Safir, which publishes in Syrian-policed west
Beirut, said Aoun was placing ``freedom of the press under house
arrest.''
   A front-page banner headline said Aoun's directive was ``another
separationist decision'' by the 54-year-old general who has refused
to acknowledge the election of Hrawi as president by
parliamentarians Nov. 24.
   Aoun, who was appointed by former President Amin Gemayel as head
of an interim military cabinet Sept. 22, 1988, has declared the
nation's one-chamber house dissolved to prevent the election of a
pro-Syrian head of state.
   The general is on a crusade to drive from Lebanon the 40,000
Syrian troops that control much of the countryside, making Damascus
the main power broker in Lebanon.
   Aoun's opponents said his decision to dissove Parliament was
unconstitutional, noting that only a president has the right to
dissolve the legislature.
   In addition to Ad-Diyar, four other daily papers publish in the
Christian enclave and six in Beirut's Moslem Western sector.
   The conservative daily Al-Anwar, based in Beirut's Christian
suburb of Hazmiyeh near Aoun's headquarters, followed the general's
instructions.
   The Voice of Lebanon radio of the rightist Phalange Party and
the Voice of Free Lebanon of the Christian Lebanese Forces militia
did not report news for the second straight day in another apparent
protest.
   The Lebanese Broadcasting Corp., the television station of the
Lebanese Forces, also suspended its newscasts Monday.
   The three Christian news organizations said they were
considering Aoun's directive.
   The strike and Ad-Diyar's defiance of Aoun reflected a growing
split within Christian ranks over an Arab League-brokered peace
plan to end the 14-year-old Moslem-Christian civil war that has
killed more than 150,000 lives.
   Hrawi was elected president under the peace plan, worked out by
Lebanese legislators in Saudi Arabia.
   The internationally recognized Hrawi immediately dismissed Aoun
as prime minister and army commander, but the defiant general held
out in the Christian enclave, refusing to hand over the
presidential palace to Hrawi.

   A suspected Irish Republican Army
terrorist bragged that the group's next target would be British
helicopters once it had control of a Stinger anti-aircraft missile,
according to court papers.
   Kevin McKinley, who also allegedly told federal undercover
agents that his group was responsible for a 1984 assassination
attempt against British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and other
bombings, was arrested Friday in a Palm Beach parking lot as he
tried to wedge a 5-foot Stinger missile in his car. Three other men
were also arrested.
   The four remained in prison today after a bail hearing was
postponed until Friday at the request of both sides.
   ``All have a viable defense and it will be pursued to the
highest degree,'' said Roger Colton, a lawyer for McKinley, 33;
Seamus Moley, 30 and Joseph McColgan, 39, all Irish citizens.
   Colton would not give details of a possible defense but said
entrapment is ``a possible avenue.''
   Co-defendant Sean McCann, 34, a Canadian, was represented by
attorney Michael Salnick.
   Agents posing as arms dealers arrested the men shortly after
Moley handed over $47,500 for a hand-held Stinger missile and
McKinley was taken to a West Palm Beach warehouse to inspect the
weapon, authorities said.
   Agents had planned to follow McKinley from the warehouse, but he
was arrested on the spot after he discovered the Stinger did not
fit in his car, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
said Tuesday. The three other men were arrested in North Palm
Beach, about 65 miles north of Miami.
   The Stinger, which weighs about 35 pounds, is used to launch a
single surface-to-air missile. The weapon was on loan from the
Marines and had no warhead.
   McKinley said the Stinger was to be used by the provisional wing
of the IRA against British helicopters in Northern Ireland,
according to court papers filed by Customs and ATF.
   McKinley also told agents ``his people'' were responsible for a
1984 bombing of a hotel in Brighton, England. The IRA claimed
responsibility for the bombing, which killed five people, including
two senior Conservative Party figures. Mrs. Thatcher escaped
unharmed.
   During several meetings from Nov. 20 to Jan. 12, the suspects
also said they were seeking .50-caliber rifles, C-4 explosives and
grenade launchers. All are charged with violations of the Arms
Export Control Act and Neutrality Law and other weapons violations.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Barbara Patras said they each could
receive up to 30 years in prison and $1.25 million in fines if
convicted.
   The IRA, a mainly Roman Catholic guerrilla group outlawed in
Britain and Ireland, is fighting to end British rule over Northern
Ireland and unite it with the Irish Republic.

   African National Congress leader Walter
Sisulu today said the group should increase its military and
political pressure in the fight against apartheid, although racial
tensions are easing in South Africa.
   Sisulu told about 1,000 exiled ANC members that they should work
toward negotiations with the South African government but pursue
their armed struggle to maintain pressure for rapid change of
racial laws and societal structures.
   Sisulu and seven ANC colleagues, all of whom served lengthy
prison terms in South Africa, are on a visit to Lusaka, the
guerrilla movement's exile headquarters. They came to help
coordinate ANC strategy in the face of a fast-changing political
climate in South Africa.
   The ANC's political and military wings, and the international
community, should ``intensify the struggle against apartheid, even
though there may be an easing of tensions at home,'' Sisulu said.
   ``The political struggle and the armed struggle go side by
side,'' he said.
   The 60- and 70-year-old men received a rousing welcome from the
ANC members who chanted, sang freedom songs and gave clenched fist
salutes. The hall was draped in the green, black and gold banners
of the ANC, and many members wore ANC scarves.
   Since South African President F.W. de Klerk assumed power in
August, he has allowed opposition groups to protest openly and has
urged negotiations on a new constitution that would include a
political voice for the black majority.
   But de Klerk says the ANC, the main group fighting to undermine
the white government, must commit itself to peaceful solutions and
end its military campaign before participating in negotiations.
   The ANC says the government must lift the state of emergency,
legalize the ANC, and end trials and hangings of guerrillas before
talks begin.
   Sisulu and his colleagues campaign openly for their organization
in South Africa, but the ANC remains outlawed.
   Sisulu praised the ANC and its ally, the South African Communist
Party, for ``taking the initiative'' and setting down conditions
for talks.
   The ANC has an estimated 15,000 members, many of whom are at
guerrilla camps in Tanzania and Uganda. The organization has no
offices or military bases in countries bordering South Africa, but
it has millions of supporters inside the country.
   The ANC meetings occur amid widespread speculation that the
group's best known figure, Nelson Mandela, will be freed within
weeks after more than 27 years behind bars.
   Mandela and the recently released ANC leaders no longer hold
formal titles in the organization, and leadership is a major issue
facing the organization.
   The current president, Oliver Tambo, 71, is in a Swedish clinic
recovering from a stroke. Sisulu said he intends to visit him
before returning home. The ANC in Tanzania said the leaders were
expected there Jan. 23.

   Amnesty International today accused South Korea of
reversing a two-year trend of human rights improvements, citing
mass arrests and the reported torture of prisoners.
   The worldwide human rights organization said 800 political and
trade union activists have been arrested in major cities in a
crackdown on political opposition by President Roh Tae-Woo's
government.
   Thousands more were briefly detained for participating in
demonstrations or industrial strikes, the London-based group said,
and leading dissidents and students leaders went into hiding to
escape arrest.
   Kwang Sik Kim, press attache at the South Korean Embassy in
London, said officials had not seen the report and could not
comment on it.
   In South Korea today, several newspapers quoted unidentified
government intelligence officials who accused North Korea of
holding more than 150,000 political prisoners in concentration
camps called ``dictatorial districts.''
   ``The situation (in North Korea) is much worse than that of the
notorious Stalinist era in the Soviet Union,'' the national Yonhap
news agency quoted one official as saying.
   In April, South Korea banned from political activity people with
``unacceptable views'' on reunification with North Korea or labor
activities. Amnesty said many people who have since been arrested
were denied regular access to lawyers and relatives.
   Some alleged they were tortured or ill-treated.
   Amnesty said the arrests reverse a trend in human rights
improvements that had resulted in presidential amnesties in 1987
and 1988 and the release of more than 1,000 political prisoners.
   Hundreds of prisoners were believed being held for political
reasons at the end of 1989, and another 200 political prisoners
have been held for between one and 39 years, the group said.
   It called for the release of 100 prisoners of conscience
believed to have been arrested for the nonviolent exercise of their
fundamental rights.
   Amnesty alleged that Roh's government has done little to review
the cases of long-term political prisoners or to investigate human
rights abuses under the previous government.
   It said the majority of political prisoners have been charged
with ``anti-state activities'' under the National Security Law that
provides for long sentences for illegal travel to North Korea,
contact with groups supporting North Korea or even possessing books
about or from North Korea.
   ``The mere fact of traveling to North Korea, without evidence
either of espionage activities or of the use of advocacy of
violence cannot justify imprisonment,'' Amnesty said.
   The report said many of South Korea's 200 long-term prisoners
were convicted of being North Korean spies or agents. It said the
definition of espionage is so broad that some may actually be
prisoners of conscience.
   The country's National Assembly discussed amendments to the law
in 1989 but no changes were made, Amnesty said.
   The group said it was also concerned about reports of torture
and ill-treatment of prisoners, despite government measures to
prevent torture after the death of a student under torture in
January 1987.
   It said prosecution authorities investigating allegations of
torture made by several former political prisoners have begun
judicial proceedings against police officers for assault in only
one case.
   Amnesty said seven prisoners were executed last year in a bid to
curb an increase in violent crime, after two years of no executions.

   Two sailors were found shot to death in the
bachelor enlisted quarters of a tightly guarded Trident submarine
base, the Navy said.
   The shootings were the latest in a string of apparently
unrelated slayings in the Puget Sound area since Sunday in which
eight people were killed.
   The sailors' bodies were found Tuesday morning at the Bangor
base on Hood Canal. The victims' names were being withheld pending
notification of families.
   The enlisted quarters are in the base's community area, along
with family housing and recreational facilities.
   Law enforcement officers and the Naval Investigative Service
were investigating the slayings, the Navy said.
   Also Tuesday, a clerk was killed and another seriously wounded
when someone walked into their Bremerton pawn shop and shot them,
police said. No money was taken and the only thing believed missing
was a handgun, said Capt. Dennis Plumb.
   Julie Michaels, 32, was killed. Her brother, Alan, 35, was in
critical condition today at Harrison Hospital in Bremerton.
   Bremerton and the Trident base are on the Kitsap Peninsula west
of Seattle.
   On Monday, two Seattle lawyers were found shot to death in a
house they were fixing up just south of the city.
   Capt. T. Michael Nault, King County police major crimes
commander, said the lawyers were not killed at random and that at
least one of the victims might have known the assailant or
assailants, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported today.
   The county medical examiner's office said the two, Eric A.
Hoyer, 34, and Steven M. Dorobis, about 36, were killed sometime
Sunday.
   Hoyer's practice was mostly commercial law, but he also handled
some family law cases, said Peter Friedman, a law partner of
Hoyer's. Dorobis practiced general law, said a receptionist.
   In other incidents, a Seattle homeowner killed a man and wounded
another in a shootout with intruders who broke into his home
Sunday, police said. The homeowner was wounded in the hand.
   Two brothers were killed, a third brother was injured and a
fourth man held for investigation of homicide and assault in a
shooting spree Sunday outside an apartment complex in Des Moines,
south of Seattle. Police said they believe the shootings may have
been the work of a jealous boyfriend.

   The chief of state security has
resigned following allegations that his agency illegally monitored
opposition activities, the official MTI news agency reported today.
   The report did not say when Jozsef Horvath resigned.
   Horvath, in a letter sent recently to Interior Minister Istvan
Horvath, asked to be relieved of his post because of the ``loss of
confidence in the service and in himself,'' MTI said. The two men
are not related.
   Horvath rejected allegations that his service carried out
illegal activities, including monitoring of opposition leaders as
they prepare for elections March 25.
   Leaders of the League of Free Democrats and the Alliance of
Young Democrats last week showed reporters copies of documents they
said belonged to the Interior Ministry's State Security Service
containing information on their organizations and their campaign
strategies.
   The opposition leaders refused to say where or how they acquired
the documents.
   Jozsef Horvath said the loss of public confidence would do
``great damage'' to the secret service operations in the future.
   ``I deem it unfair that at the very beginning of the
investigations we were subject to prejudice and were pronounced
guilty,'' he said in the letter, according to MTI.
   The opposition groups said they had asked the state prosecutor's
office to launch an investigation and criminal proceedings against
``persons unknown'' for violating the constitution and the penal
code.
   Hungary's security organs regularly monitored dissident
activities during four decades of Communist rule. In October, the
Communist Party formally disbanded, reconstituting itself as the
Hungarian Socialist Party and aspiring to democratic ideals.
   Parliament rewrote the constitution to incorporate multiparty
democracy and adopt laws allowing several parties to contest this
year's elections.

   An abortion protester who faced no more
than 30 days in jail but wound up spending a year behind bars
because he wouldn't give his name has been released, his identity
still in question.
   ``I did what I think was right,'' the man, who has identified
himself only as Baby John Doe, told Judge Randall Nichols at a
hearing Tuesday in which he won his freedom.
   Nicholls ordered the protester, who had been in custody since
his arrest exactly year ago for blocking the doors to a Knoxville
health clinic, to pay $12,547 to the county for the cost of jailing
him.
   The protester said he hoped his demonstration to make abortion
illegal in Tennessee had advanced his cause.
   ``Maybe not (with) the Legislature,'' he said, ``but the hearts
of some people.''
   The protester was charged with criminal trespassing after
refusing to leave the clinic during a protest by the anti-abortion
group Operation Rescue. The charge carried up to 30 days in jail.
   Nichols convicted him in September but refused to impose the
sentence until the man, who was booked as Baby John Doe and is
reportedly 25 years old and from out of state, identified himself.
   On Tuesday, Assistant District Attorney David Jennings recounted
his office's unsuccessful efforts to determine the man's identity
and said a guard at the penal farm where the man was held told
authorities his name might be Gary Christopher.
   When asked if that was his name, the protester said, ``I cannot
comment on that, sir.''
   The judge agreed to release the man under the names Baby John
Doe and Gary Christopher, saying his decision was affected by
nightly questions from his 8-year-old son on the protester's fate,
letters from all over the United States on his behalf and
overcrowding in the county jail.
   Asked how the court will be able to track down the man if he
fails to pay the $12,547, the judge said it was a valid question.
``I would hope to be able to use the powers of the state of
Tennessee to find out,'' he said.

   A quarter of Poland's farmland is so polluted
with lead, zinc, cadmium and mercury that it might be dangerous to
grow vegetables in it. Ninety-five percent of the country's rivers
are undrinkable _ and half so toxic that the water can't even be
used in industry for fear of destroying equipment.
   In Hungary, air pollution accounts for one in 17 deaths. A
quarter to a third of the forests in four of the six countries of
Eastern Europe show signs of dying from air pollution.
   Small wonder then, say American environmentalists, that in the
upheavals which have thrown out the old regimes of Poland, East
Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania one of the persistent
demands has been for environmental repair.
   ``Pollution was part and parcel of the system that molested the
people in their daily lives,'' says Jeffrey Leonard of the World
Wildlife Fund, author of several books on Eastern Europe's
pollution problems.
   Now environmentalists take hope that the new leaders of Eastern
Europe _ site of some of the world's worst pollution _ will seek to
alleviate the conditions which are turning their countries to ruin
and threatening the health of the people.
   ``Environmental conditions are so bad they affect the very
possibility of having economic growth,'' said Jessica Tuchman
Mathews of World Resources Institute, a research organization.
``How does a country rebuild a shattered economy when it can't
breathe its air, till its soil or drink its water?''
   Said Richard Liroff, director of the Eastern European
Environmental Affairs Program of the Conservation Foundation,
``People there are saying, `We've had enough. Our health is being
threatened, our lungs damaged, our forests destroyed, our children
harmed by lead and heavy metals in the environment.'''
   But the question remains whether East Europeans, having to cope
with unemployment, inflation and bankruptcy as they move toward
market economies, will be tempted to put environmental concerns
aside as they struggle to remodel their economies and political
structures.
   ``They're going to have to make some extremely hard choices,''
said Liroff. ``A lot of their industry, especially in Poland, is
antiquated. Rather than trying to place pollution control equipment
on it, it might be better to shut it down entirely and eventually
replace it with modern equipment that is energy and resource
efficient and doesn't pollute as much. But that means unemployment.
Is society willing to accept that cost? I just don't know.''
   Civic Forum, which formed the basis of the new government of
Czechoslovakia, appeared to provide its answer in laying out its
program for the nation last fall.
   ``We all must seek a method of restoring harmony between man and
his environment,'' Civic Forum said. ``We will strive (for) a
gradual repairing of the damage which has been inflicted upon
nature during recent decades. ... We are aware that this will mean
sacrifices on the part of all of us. This will require a change in
value scales and lifestyles.''
   Said playwright Vaclav Havel upon taking office as the new Czech
president: ``We have laid waste to our soil and the rivers and the
forests that our forefathers bequeathed to us, and we have the
worst environment in the whole of Europe today. Adults in our
country die earlier than in most other European countries.''
   William Chandler, senior scientist with Battelle's Pacific
Northwest Laboratories, and he is confident the Poles will make the
sacrifices necessary to build an energy-efficient and
environmentally clean industrial plant for its future.
   U.S. environmentalists say the attempt to combat the air
pollution that leads to global warming could be undermined unless
the pollution of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is curtailed.
   ``What happens in Eastern Europe is very important for global
warming because they burn so much coal,'' said Liroff. ``The
Eastern European countries need to be put on an energy diet in much
the same way as the United States and other industrialized nations
need to be put on one.''

   Boulder County Commissioner Josie Heath, an
activist in women's organizations, has become the third person
seeking the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat being
vacated by Republican Bill Armstrong.
   Heath, 52, announced Tuesday that she will run this year.
   Former state Democratic party leader Buie Seawell and Alamosa
lawyer Carlos Lucero also are campaigning for the Democratic
nomination.
   Rep. Hank Brown is the only Republican seeking the Senate seat.
   ``We will be discussing critical environmental issues, jobs and

affecting families and children,'' Heath said.
   Heath is in her eighth year as Boulder County commissioner. She
is a former high school teacher, community college administrator
and regional director for ACTION, which includes the Peace Corps,
VISTA and senior citizens programs.
   She was chairwoman of the Colorado Commission on Women and a
founder of Colorado and Boulder County women's organizations.
   Armstrong has said he is leaving after two terms to return to
private life and devote himself to religious activities and family.
   Tim Wirth, a Democrat, is Colorado's other senator.

<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's Communist government
said today that it will ask Parliament to approve legislation that
would legalize opposition parties.
   The proposal would allow independent political parties and
citizens' associations to register with authorities to gain
official recognition, the state-run Tanjug news agency reported.
   But groups ``advocating the violent overthrow of the
constitution, violations of ... guaranteed human rights, or
spreading national and religious hatred'' still would be
prohibited, according to the draft law.
   Tanjug did not say when the draft would be submitted to
Parliament.
   Prime Minister Ante Markovic, who has moved to introduce
sweeping market-oriented economic reforms since he took office in
March, has said he also wants democratic reforms in Yugoslavia.
   Earlier this month, the Communist leadership announced the
nation's first free parliamentary elections in 45 years,
tentatively scheduled for April 8-12.
   When they came to power in 1945, the Communists abolished all
opposition parties. But last month the party leadership unveiled a
draft declaration that pledges full support for the establishment
of a multiparty parliamentary system. The Communist Party is to
adopt the declaration at a national congress on Saturday.
   Despite a lack of official recognition, several dozen political
parties and independent citizens' groups have been formed over the
past 18 months.
   The liberal leadership of Yugoslavia's northern state of
Slovenia has led the drive for democratic reforms. Communist
hard-liners in some southern regions, particularly Serbia, at first
strongly opposed the drive but later gave their support for reforms.

   A man claiming he had a bomb tried to
hijack a jetliner to Cuba but was overpowered by a police officer
who sneaked up an escape chute after the plane made an emergency
landing, authorities said.
   No one was seriously hurt late Tuesday during the America West
flight that was supposed to fly non-stop from Houston to Las Vegas.
   The Boeing 737 carrying 39 people landed in Austin shortly
before midnight after the pilot told the would-be hijacker the
plane needed to refuel, authorities said.
   Passenger Robert Martin said the man had been sitting two rows
in front of him, complaining loudly about American TV programs.
   Authorities identified the man as Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Gonzalez,
a 39-year-old Cuban native who lives in New Orleans. FBI agent
Byron Sage said he expected the man to be charged with air piracy
and kidnapping.
   Gonzalez-Gonzalez told reporters as he was being put in a police
car that he tried to hijack the plane because he thought he was in
danger ``because of my political beliefs.''
   When asked what those beliefs were, he said, ``I feel this
country is in peril.'' He was driven away before he could comment
further.
   Authorities said police Capt. Lloyd Polk climbed into the
jetliner after Gonzalez-Gonzalez released the 34 passengers and
three of the five crew members, allowing them to slide down an
emergency chute to freedom.
   Polk said he had hoped to negotiate with the man. But once
inside, Polk said, it appeared that a flight attendant was in
danger.
   ``I saw he had the stewardess so I took action immediately,''
Polk said today. ``I had a struggle with him, but I was able to
hold him to the ground until more help arrived.''
   No bomb was found. Several passengers said it appeared the man
carried a flashlight and a rope, which he used to choke flight
attendant Stacy Wood, 26.
   The attempted hijacking of Flight 727 began after takeoff when
Gonzalez-Gonzalez grabbed Ms. Wood and took her to the rear,
announcing he had a bomb and wanted to fly to Cuba, police said.
The other passengers were ordered to the front.
   The pilot, Capt. Dick Nelson, told Gonzalez-Gonzalez he had to
land at Austin's Robert Mueller Municipal Airport to refuel.
   Nelson, who helped Polk as he entered the plane, said the
officer tackled Gonzalez-Gonzalez, striking him with either a
flashlight or nightstick.
   Ms. Wood and another flight attendant were treated at a hospital
for minor injuries and released.
   Gonzalez-Gonzalez was taken to a hospital for treatment of cuts
to his head suffered when he was arrested, said city emergency
services shift commander Bob Gutierrez.
   Crew members and passengers said Gonzalez-Gonzalez appeared
extremely agitated before and during the flight.
   Martin, 24, of Fontana, Calif., said Gonzalez-Gonzalez had been
a nuisance at the terminal in Houston and several passengers
complained to airline officials about him.
   Another passenger, Herb Atwood of Cold Spring, said
Gonzalez-Gonzalez had been acting strangely.
   ``You always hear about this,'' he said. ``And I never thought
it would happen to me. I was scared like everyone else. I was
looking forward to a trip to Vegas. But my gambling ended before it
started.''
   The passengers were put up in a hotel and were to be flown out
later.

<HEAD>30 Suspected Liberian Rebels Arrested in Ivory Coast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty men suspected of being part of a
band of rebels that launched attacks in Liberia have been arrested
in neighboring Ivory Coast, a newspaper said today.
   The Daily Observer said the suspected rebels were arrested in
the town of Danane, 25 miles from Liberia's border. The story
quoted unidentified diplomats as saying the men were being
questioned in Abidjan, capital of Ivory Coast.
   Fighting was first reported in Liberia's northeastern Nimba
County on Dec. 24, after Liberian officials said about 100
dissidents entered the country from Ivory Coast in an attempt to
overthrow the government.
   An estimated 20,000 Liberians have fled to Guinea and Ivory
Coast since then to escape fighting. Ivorian President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny said this month that 8,000 to 10,000 Liberians had
entered his country.
   Liberian authorities say rebels killed about 200 people,
including 16 government officials, before troops brought the
situation under control.
   However, the human rights organizations Amnesty International
and Africa Watch have accused Liberian soldiers of killing unarmed
civilians during the unrest.
   Jenkin Scott, Liberia's justice minister, admitted last week
that soldiers had killed civilians but said they acted in
self-defense.
   Daniel Sio, chief of the small Liberian border town of Butuo,
where rebels first attacked, told the Observer a different story.
   Sio said troops rounded up all local officials on arrival and
accused them of failing to repulse the rebels. Then the soldiers
opened fire and set the town on fire, he was quoted as saying.
   Sio, who was shot in the right leg, was left for dead and later
fled to Ivory Coast, the Observer said.
   The United States on Tuesday expressed concern over the civilian
casualties caused by the dissidents and the troops.
   The West African nation of Liberia was founded in 1847 by freed
American slaves and maintains strong cultural and economic ties
with United States.
   Liberia's military placed Nimba County under a state of
emergency and last week evacuated about 5,000 people from the
village of Karnplay and surrounding areas, where the fighting was
heaviest.
   The dissidents, who call themselves the Liberian Patriotic
Front, are led by Charles Taylor, a former Liberian civil servant.
Taylor said Tuesday his fighters had launched a new offensive but
gave no indication of its size.
   President Samuel Doe, a former master sergeant who seized power
in a 1980 bloody coup, has accused Ivory Coast of harboring the
dissidents, a charge Ivory Coast denies.

   The grandsons of a prospector killed in
1949 in a dispute over a buried treasure plan to resume the search
in what is now an Army missile range.
   Even if it proves to be fool's gold, Terry and James Delonis
hope their as yet unscheduled expedition will remove the stigma
attached to their family for 30 years.
   ``This is more exciting than I can describe,'' Terry Delonis
said last week.
   The Delonises' grandfather, Milton E. ``Doc'' Noss, claimed to
have discovered a cache of gold bullion and coins inside a cavern
on Victorio Peak while he, his wife and some friends were hunting
deer in 1937.
   Noss and his wife, Ova, said they made several efforts to
recover the gold but accidentally sealed the entrance while trying
to expand it.
   During World War II, the Army took over the area, and it now
lies on the restricted White Sands Missile Range.
   Noss was shot to death during an argument with a backer in a
treasure hunt in 1949. Ova Noss died in 1979, but the grandsons
plan to continue the quest for the fabled treasure.
   The brothers said they grew up hearing tales of the buried
treasure from their grandmother, who told the stories in great
detail.
   ``She also had a good mind for numbers,'' James Delonis said.
``She could recall depths, distances, degrees, etc.''
   The Army allowed a professional treasure-hunting company,
Expeditions Unlimited of Florida, onto the range in 1977. The
company, which represented several claimants to the treasure, found
nothing, but said ground radar did indicated a cavern beneath the
peak.
   The company, headed by Norman Scott, ran out of time before the
cavern could be excavated.
   Two previous searches also failed to turn up any gold, and the
Army said after the 1977 hunt that the range would be closed to
searchers.
   But Rep. Joe Skeen, R-N.M., sponsored an amendment to the 1989
Defense Authorization Act to allow Noss family heirs to dig for the
legendary treasure, although they must pay the expenses. Skeen said
anything found would be turned over to the courts to decide
ownership.
   The brothers hired Expeditions Unlimited to head the operation,
and announced they have formed a foundation to help in searching
for the treasure.
   Terry Delonis said recent ground radar readings again revealed a
cavern in the same place indicated by the 1977 expedition.
   No date for the search has been announced.
   But the Army has agreed to take reporters to the site Jan. 25.
   The gold, according to various stories, was said to have been
stored in the peak by Spanish conquistadores who mined it nearby,
or was loot gathered by the Apache Chief Victorio, for whom the
mountain was named.
   Some have contended the federal government found and removed the
gold years ago, but the Army has denied those stories.

<HEAD>Drop in 1989 Domestic Oil Output Called Largest Ever</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Domestic oil production in 1989 took the
steepest yearly fall in history, and petroleum imports rose to a
10-year high, the industry said today.
   The American Petroleum Institute, the trade association of the
major oil companies, also said that while U.S. oil consumption
increased only slightly, imports rose to 46 percent of total
supplies. That was the second-highest level on record.
   The figures confirm a continued decline of the domestic oil
industry and are expected to add heat to a debate in Congress this
year over whether exploration and production companies should get
new tax breaks to stimulate drilling activity.
   The Bush administration has argued that declining U.S. oil
production and increasing reliance on foreign producers is
undermining national energy security.
   In its year-end report, the petroleum institute said U.S. crude
oil production averaged 7.6 million barrels a day in 1989. That was
the lowest in 26 years and a decline of 553,000 barrels per day, or
6.8 percent, from the 1988 total.
   Alaskan oil production, which had increased almost every year
since the start of production from the huge Prudhoe Bay field in
1977, fell by 140,000 barrels per day in 1989.
   The report said the Alaska decline was exaggerated by
maintenance work and traffic restrictions following the Exxon
Valdez oil tanker spill last March, and that the ``underlying
decline trend'' in Alaska was about 100,000 barrels per day.
   Oil imports rose to 7.9 million barrels a day last year, up 8.2
percent from 1988 and nearly 60 percent above the 1985 level, when
imports sank to a low of 5 million barrels a day before prices
collapsed on the world market in 1986.
   The report said that while imports from Western Hemisphere
sources still accounted for about 43 percent of total imports in
1989, imports from the Persian Gulf continued to grow to 21 percent
of the total.
   Total imports accounted for 46 percent of oil consumed in the
United States last year. That was the second-highest ever, after
the 47.7 percent level of 1977. As recently as 1985, imports' share
of domestic consumption was only 31.5 percent.
   The rise in total U.S. energy consumption last year slowed to
1.9 percent after increases of 3.5 percent in 1987 and 4.0 percent
in 1988, the report said.

<TEXT>
   Yasser Arafat today denounced a statement
by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir that Israel must retain
the West Bank and Gaza Strip to settle Jews from the Soviet Union
as ``racist and expansionist.''
   In Jerusalem today, Vice Premier Shimon Peres prepared for a
meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo next week in
an effort to break the stalemate in Middle East peace efforts, a
Peres aide said.
   Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said
Shamir's claim on the status of the occupied territories poses a
threat to Palestinians, Arabs and the international community.
   ``We (the Palestinians) are going on with our resistance to the
Israeli occupation ... but it is a challenge to all Arabs which we
should confront,'' Arafat told The Associated Press.
   Shamir declared Monday that Israel needs to retain the West Bank
and Gaza, the focal points of the Middle East conflict, to settle
an influx of Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union.
   ``For a large immigration we need the Land of Israel, a great
and strong Israel,'' Shamir told the Likud. ``We will need a lot of
place to absorb everybody.''
   The term ``Land of Israel is used by members of the right-wing
Likud bloc in references to Israel and the occupied territories,
which were captured from Jordan and Egypt by Israel in 1967.
   Arafat said Shamir's statement clearly demonstrates Israel's
ambitions and Shamir's unwillingness to accept a peace settlement.
   ``This reveals the true, ugly face of Israel which wants to
swallow more land and reject all peace efforts,'' Arafat added,
calling Shamir's statement ``impudent, racist and expansionist.''
   Arafat claimed Shamir's latest statement and his rejection of a
PLO role in peace talks reflect a crisis in Israeli policy toward
peace efforts in the Middle East.
   ``Shamir is swimming against the tide of history. He doesn't
understand new developments in the world ... he cannot go on with
his occupation of our land,'' Arafat said.
   He also lashed out at the United States for its support of
Israel and alleged failure to pressure Shamir to get involved in a
peace process in the Middle East.
   ``Without American support ... Shamir wouldn't have dared to
make such a statement'' on the status of the territories, Arafat
said.
   The U.S. State Department said Tuesday it had asked Israel to
explain Shamir's comment that the occupied territories should be
used to settle Jews from the Soviet Union.
   The meeting between Peres and Mubarak on Jan. 24 will be the
first top-level encounter between Israeli and Egyptian officials
since Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin held talks with Mubarak in
Cairo in September.
   Peres spokesman Avi Gil said the Middle East peace process will
be at the top of the agenda. He refused to elaborate, saying only:
``When you're in Egypt, you don't just talk about the pyramids.''
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker is urging three-way peace
talks that would include the foreign ministers of Egypt, the United
States and Israel as the first step toward organizing elections
among Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Since the Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands began 25
months ago, Israelis have killed 648 Palestinians, Palestinian
vigilantes have killed 170 fellow Arabs suspected of cooperating
with Israel, and 43 Israelis have died.

Air Act, a lower capital gains tax, the war on drugs and crime,
education and an overhaul of farm programs _ in a kickoff speech
last week to the American Farm Bureau in Orlando, Fla.
   A few days later, Bush's address to the Cincinnati Chamber of
Commerce laid down his basic defense position: he would not
``naively cut the muscle out of our defense posture'' despite a
relaxation of tensions in Eastern Europe.
   Bush said Congress shouldn't expect a ``peace dividend'' as some
Democrats have urged, in which military savings can be diverted
directly into domestic programs.
   The president is to further outline his agenda for 1990 in a
speech on Friday to the National Association of Homebuilders in
Atlanta.
   He also has been staging events to bolster selected parts of his
program _ for instance, Tuesday's unannounced visit with Housing
Secretary Jack Kemp to a public housing development to push his war
on drugs and his proposal to make it easier for public housing
residents to buy their dwellings.
   The president today was spotlighting his anti-crime program at a
luncheon with law enforcement agencies.
   And, he has clearly set the stage for confrontations with the
Democratic-led Congress.
   Although he has vowed to repeat the offer of an extended hand to
Congress, made in his inaugural last year, th president complained
in Orlando about Democratic ``demagogues'' who oppose his capital
gains cut.
   And he told the Chamber of Commerce in Cincinnati that many of
his first-year programs remain ``bogged down in the jungles of
Capitol Hill.''
   Bush also has saluted developments in Eastern Europe, praised
U.S. troops who fought in Panama, talked about the ``daybreak of a
new decade'' and reveled over ``the opportunity and optimism of a
world at peace.''
   Bush's speeches leading up to the State of the Union address are
largely focusing on ``the issues that remain unfinished in some
cases from last year's legislative session,'' said White House
communications director David Demarest. But the State of the Union
is likely to be more forward-looking and expressed in more lofty
language.
   The president won't have to share the billing when he delivers
that address. But that wasn't so on Tuesday when he and Kemp
dropped by the public housing development in Alexandria.
   The president sat mostly impassive as Kemp delivered a long and
impassioned exposition on public housing, the drug problem,
community involvement, the desirability of home ownership and the
civil rights movement.
   When the housing secretary finally yielded the floor, Bush
observed: ``When the Berlin Wall came down, they said I wasn't
enthusiastic enough.''
   ``How do you follow this?'' Bush asked, pointing at Kemp.
   A community activist complained of a lack of funds for fighting
drug pushers. Kemp reached into his wallet and jokingly held out a
wad of bills. And, as he took one question after the other, Kemp
kept patting the president, seated beside him, on the sleeve.
   When the former Buffalo Bills quarterback, former House member
and unsuccessful 1988 Republican presidential contender finally got
around to introducing Bush, he began: ``Ladies and gentlemen, the
next president ...''
   Kemp stopped mid-sentence, looked at Bush and laughed at his
mistake. Then, he added quickly: ``I used to be `the next
president' one time, too.''

   A prospective juror in the assault trial of
reputed organized crime boss John Gotti said she thought she was
being called to judge the case of subway gunman Bernhard Goetz.
   ``You mean you confused Mr. Gotti with Mr. Goetz?'' Bruce
Cutler, Gotti's lawyer, asked the young woman, who appeared to be
in her 20s.
   ``Yes,'' she said, adding that she has lived in New York about
five years.
   She was dismissed Tuesday, as were all but one of the 21
potential jurors who participated in the session.
   Their names were kept confidential.
   Chosen as foreman was a high school teacher who appeared to be
in his 40s and who said he was aware of Gotti's ``notoriety'' and
alleged involvement in crime. He will be sequestered immediately
and remain in court custody _ sleeping in motels _ until trial's
end, said the trial judge, Acting State Supreme Court Justice
Edward McLaughlin.
   The juror, selected at the end of the day, said Gotti impressed
him as ``dignified'' and a sharp dresser.
   McLaughlin told the rest of the pool of about 170 that he
expects to complete jury selection by Thursday and that there will
be Saturday sessions.
   He told them he will permit the sequestered panel to have a
party with soft drinks and popcorn after the Super Bowl on Jan. 28.
   Gotti, 49, and co-defendant Anthony Guerrieri, 60, are being
tried on assault and conspiracy charges in connection with the
shooting of John F. O'Connor, vice president of Carpenters Union
Local 608.
   Prosecutors say the defendants arranged the shooting because
O'Connor allegedly ordered the trashing of a restaurant owned by a
Gotti associate. If convicted, Gotti could receive a prison
sentence of 25 years to life because of his felony record.
   One of those excused from the case was an actress, carrying a
book of plays, who said it was ``God's will'' that she was called
to serve on the jury of ``one of those Italian Mafia guys.''
   ``I'm from California,'' the woman told McLaughlin.
   ``I knew that,'' the judge replied as he excused her from
consideration.

<TEXT>
   A delegation of coal miners met with the
finance minister today to discuss the demands of more than 6,000
striking miners, the PAP news agency said.
   Workers were striking at the Czerwone Zaglebie and Niwka
Modrzejow mines near the industrial city of Katowice, 185 miles
south of Warsaw, PAP reported. All 6,000 workers stayed off the job
today at the Czerwone Zaglebie mine, and another 40 continued their
strike at Niwka Modrzejow.
   But miners at two other locations near Walbrzych, a city 12
miles from the border with Czechoslovakia, suspended their strike
because of the talks, the pro-Solidarity daily Gazeta Wyborcza said.
   A delegation of workers met with Finance Minister Leszek
Balcerowicz in the morning in Warsaw, said Andrzej Moroz, a
spokesman for Balcerowicz. He said details of the talks were not
immediately available.
   The miners' main demand is higher pay, and the strike is the
biggest over wages since radical reforms to introduce a market
economy took effect in Poland on Jan. 1.
   Part of the plan calls for a tight wage policy to bring down
inflation, which soared to about 900 percent last year after some
price controls were lifted in August.
   Almost all the remaining price controls were lifted Jan. 1 and
prices again are racing ahead of wages.
   Mine strikes late in the summer of 1988 led to widespread labor
unrest that forced the Communist authorities who ruled at the time
to start talks on political reform.
   The talks led to the legalization of Solidarity last year and to
partially free elections in June.
   Solidarity's sweeping victory in those elections paved the wave
for the election of Solidarity editor Tadeusz Mazowiecki as the
first non-Communist head of government in 40 years.

   Composer Jeff Alexander, who scored more than 40
movies and dozens of radio and television shows, including
``Singin' in the Rain,'' ``Gigi'' and ``The Twilight Zone,'' has
died at 79.
   Alexander, who wrote or arranged background music, transitions
between songs and other incidental music, died of cancer Dec. 23.
   The native of Seattle returned home in 1980 after his retirement
from films and television to compose chamber pieces and a symphony.
He lived on Whidbey Island northwest of Seattle.
   At the time of death, he was reworking a musical, ``The
Children's Crusade,''' which he had begun in 1975 in collaboration
with Yip Harburg and Larry Orenstein.
   He began his career as a teen-ager when he sang and danced on
the vaudeville circuit. By his late teens, he was producing musical
arrangements for several big bands.
   His first feature film arrangement was for ``Shall We Dance.''
   His film-score credits included the Fred Astaire movie ``Shall
We Dance,'' Elvis Presley's ``Jailhouse Rock'' and ``Kid Galahad,''
and the musicals ``Kismet'' and ``Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.''
   In television, he scored such series as the ``Jimmy Stewart
Show,'' ``Dr. Kildare'' and ``My Three Sons,'' in addition to ``The
Twilight Zone.''
   Alexander was one of the founders of the Screen Composer Guild
and served two terms on the board of governors of the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
   He is survived by a daughter, Jill Alexander, of San Francisco.

   A 70-year-old woman died today after being
mauled by her grandson's two pit bull terriers as she tried to feed
them, authorities said.
   ``Both her arms had been chewed to the bone,'' said County-USC
Medical Center spokeswoman Adelaida De La Cerda.
   Surgeons had amputated Marjee Lilly's left arm and operated on
her right arm Tuesday.
   The dogs mauled Mrs. Lilly on Tuesday in the kitchen of her
grandson's home, breaking off the attack when the grandson
returned, police said.
   ``As Mrs. Lilly was attempting to feed the dogs, she was taking
food out of a large 25-pound bag and the dogs became excited,''
said police Lt. Alan Kerstein. ``She apparently attempted to push
them away or restrain them and they attacked.''
   Mrs. Lilly, of San Diego, was visiting her grandson, Clarence
Hubbard, 34, Kerstein said.
   Hubbard told officials he has owned the 14-month-old dogs, which
weigh 45 to 50 pounds, since they were puppies and they had never
attacked before.
   The animals were taken to an animal shelter, and Hubbard said he
wanted them destroyed, Kerstein said.
   The lieutenant said it isn't illegal to own pit bulls, and the
animals were on private property. ``We see no criminal aspect
here.''

<HEAD>Rebels Announce Formula For New Leadership</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Afghanistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan rebels today announced a
formula for a new leadership despite bitter divisions within their
own ranks.
   The announcement coincided with U.S. Undersecretary of State
Robert Kimmitt's three-day visit. He is the highest-ranking State
Department official to visit Pakistan since February's Soviet troop
withdrawal from neighboring Afghanistan.
   Rebel sources said the formula was an offering to Kimmitt, who
was reportedly in Pakistan to take a new look at the politically
troubled rebels.
   He is expected to meet the guerrilla leadership Thursday in
Pakistan's rugged frontier city of Peshawar, 30 miles from the
Afghan border.
   Abdul Rahim, a spokesman for a joint rebel news agency, said
Kimmitt wanted something to give Secretary of State James A. Baker
III to take to next month's meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze.
   The complicated formula provides for a grand council or
``shura'' of between 2,000 and 3,000 people selected from inside
Afghanistan. These people will also represent the estimated 5
million Afghans living in squalid refugee camps in Pakistan and
Iran.
   However, it does not allow for participation of Afghanistan's
ruling Communists, something Moscow has repeatedly demanded.
   The grand council would then choose 200 to 300 people, who will
form a national assembly or Parliament.
   The assembly, according to the formula, will select a new
leadership or give a vote of confidence to the existing self-styled
government, criticized for its bitter infighting and narrow
composition.
   The renegade among the major rebel groups headquartered in
Pakistan, Gulbaddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami, rejected the
formula, demanding elections. Other smaller groups also have
denounced it.
   Nasrullah Mansoor, who represents a small guerrilla organization
based in Pakistan, said his group as well as those headquartered in
Iran want no part of the newly announced formula.
   A rebel source, who asked not to be identified, said the
Iranian-based guerrillas rejected the formula because they had no
part in its creation.
   Most war refugees living in Iran belong to Afghanistan's
minority Shiite sect of Islam, which is practiced by most Iranians.
Those in Pakistan are Sunni Moslems.
   The rebels, who have fought for 11 years to topple successive
Communist governments in Kabul, formed their own government about a
year ago. But it has been wracked by internal feuding, unable to
entice the Iranian-based guerrillas or other minority groups to
join.
   Afghan sources in Pakistan said the United States has come under
heavy criticism for its support of this rebel government, which
they charge was created by Washington and Islamabad.

   A 5-year-old boy who was submerged in
an icy pond for 40 minutes remained ``unconscious and
unresponsive'' in critical condition today and his chances for
survival were slim, doctors said.
   ``His heart and lung functions are improved somewhat but he is
going through a period of brain swelling now, as was expected,''
Dr. Craig Futterman, a pediatric internist at Fairfax Hospital,
said of George Sader. ``He has a 2 to 10 percent chance to survive
at all and about a 2 percent chance to survive neurologically
intact.''
   The boy was playing on an ice-covered pond in Centreville, Va.,
with two older girls on Monday when he fell through a crack into
six feet of water.
   Futterman said doctors would perform a CAT scan today to
determine whether the boy suffered brain damage.
   There have been about two dozen reported cases of people
surviving submersion in cold water for long periods, some up to an
hour, officials said.
   Futterman said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' program this morning that
the reason why some people survive and some don't remain unclear.
But he said it is believed that the way people cool down is linked
to their chances of survival.
   ``If the temperature of their tissues cools down to a very cold
temperature prior to their heart stopping, it's felt that that's
the most physiologic way to preserve those tissues,'' Futterman
said. ``If, however, the heart stops prior to cooling down, then
their chance of surviving are much lower.''
   George, whose body temperature had dropped to 90 degrees, was in
cardiac arrest when he arrived at the hospital and was hooked up to
a heart-lung machine to warm his blood.

   A union member was killed and two others
were wounded in a shootout in West Virginia coal country between
picketing miners and gunmen in the woods, authorities said.
   State Police said they had no suspects or motive in the
shootings, which occurred Tuesday on a highway running through the
hills of McDowell County in southern West Virginia.
   The slaying was apparently the first fatality linked to labor
violence in the Kentucky-Virginia-West Virginia coal country since
the shooting of a non-union truck driver in Kentucky in the 1984
A.T. Massey Coal Co. strike.
   ``It sounded like World War I out there _ bullets ricocheting
and you could hear them hitting houses,'' said James Chapman, who
runs a mission nearby.
   State Police spokesman Ric Robinson said troopers are not sure
who started the shooting. Robinson said shots were exchanged
between gunmen in the woods above the highway and the miners on the
road.
   The United Mine Workers union said the pickets were
demonstrating against several coal companies over back pay and
medical benefits. Union officials said the picketing was not
related to the UMW's strike against the Pittston Co.
   John McCoy, 42, was shot to death. Darrell Morgan, 41, was
listed in stable condition today at Bluefield Regional Medical
Center, as was Steve Morgan, 33. The Morgans are not related.
   The union issued a statement condemning the attack.
   ``As mine workers, they face many dangers, whether the hazards
inherent in coal mining, the hardship caused by coal company
economics or the threats of bodily harm at the hands of gun
thugs,'' UMW President Richard Trumka said.
   Jim McNeely, a union official in District 29, which includes
McDowell County, said the area is rife with conflicts.
   ``There are creditors' disputes,'' he said. ``There are personal
disputes. There are a multitude of disputes. It's not just there is
a union-non-union dispute down there.''

   Twelve undocumented Mexicans locked for two
days in a boxcar were caught by railroad police as they tried to
cut their way out with an ax, officials said.
   Two of the aliens Tuesday were slightly injured when metal
frames inside the boxcar fell on them.
   Joseph de la Cruz, in charge of the Border Patrol's
anti-smuggling unit, said his office is working with Mexican
officials to identify and arrest those who locked the aliens inside
the boxcar on Sunday.
   ``The smuggler left food, water, a little bit of beer and an ax
and told them he would see them in San Antonio,'' de la Cruz said.
He said the aliens might have died if the weather had been warmer.
It was their sixth attempt to reach the United States.
   ``This method of locking people in boxcars is inhumane and
totally unacceptable,'' de la Cruz said. ``This is the first such
case we see this year and I hope we don't have any more.''
   The injured men were taken to a hospital. The other aliens,
including a 14-year-old, were deported.
   Eighteen aliens locked in an airtight boxcar suffocated in 1987
at Sierra Blanca, 90 miles east of El Paso. One man survived the
ordeal.
   The Border Patrol monitors railyards daily, but de la Cruz said
it would be almost impossible to check every boxcar. He said more
dogs are needed to inspect boxcars.

<TEXT>
   When the doors opened on the world's largest
marketplace for syndicated TV shows, the rush was on to find the
hot new show.
   The National Association of Television Program Executives
convention is where your local TV station sends its program
director or general manager to buy old ``Star Trek'' shows or
``Geraldo,'' or hot new shows from the big studios or small
independents.
   Finding them Tuesday, the first day of the exhibition, was the
trick.
   When the showcases of more than 200 vendors, producers and their
ilk crowd their illuminated showcases inside the vast New Orleans
Convention Center, the place begins to look like the inside of a
jukebox.
   The exhibitions of the big studios _ Paramount, Warner Bros.,
Disney _ look like cathedrals in the service of weird new gods. How
do you find the hot new syndicated shows in this morass of video?
   Go to the people responsible for the hot, old ones: King World
Productions Inc., a powerful, wealthy syndicator, and its star
producer, Merv Griffin, who created the megahits ``Jeopardy'' and
``Wheel of Fortune.''
   They are the first and second highest-rated syndication shows of
all time. By mid-afternoon, with two days remaining in the
convention, ``Wheel'' and ``Jeopardy'' had signed in markets
comprising more than 40 percent of the U.S. audience.
   Griffin, former host of the ``Play Your Hunch'' quiz show and a
talk show host and whose empire includes an Atlantic City casino,
is creating ``Monopoly,'' a 22-minute facsimile of the board game,
for a fall debut.
   ``What can I tell you? It's the most valuable license in the
game the world has ever known,'' said Griffin, settling into the
burgundy velvet cushions of King World's conversation pit beside
the illuminated fountain.
   Griffin isn't worried that a TV ``Monopoly'' might be tampering
with an American institution like apple pie or Classic Coke.
   ``The box game would never hold up on television,'' he said.
``What would be thrilling to sit home and watch somebody push a
little car and watch other people throw dice?''
   Monopoly is a game of luck and some intelligence in the way the
player acquires property, said Griffin, who has bought some
Atlantic City properties in his time. ``We used it as a scoring
device and inserted a game in front of it.''
   A small person moves the token used by the players.
   ``Everybody's mad at me because I used a little person,'' he
said. ``My answer is, didn't you have a childhood? What do you
think the Munchkins were in `The Wizard of Oz.'''
   Griffin said he is pleased because ``Monopoly'' is a unique game
design.
   ``Whatever you see now is always a clone of `Wheel' or
`Jeopardy,''' he said. ``In one way it kind of makes me laugh.
   ``There must be a billion dollars in this convention, with all
the shows they do and pilots. And when you ask yourself, `What are
they doing here?' They're all here to try and get me,'' he said
with a big smile.
   If ``Monopoly'' isn't to your taste, here's a random sampling of
other syndication offerings, as advertised:
   ``Trump Card,'' from Warner Bros. _ ``We're been saying it's
`Jeopardy' on Bingo cards,'' said marketing vice-president Jeff
Hubbard.
   ``The Puzzle Game,'' a CBS-Tribune Entertainment co-production _
``The teams earn money by solving humorous, yet challenging video
puzzles. Every time a team correctly identifies a puzzle, they win
money and get a chance to earn even more money by solving a `Super
Puzzle,' which is hidden behind nine jigsaw pieces.''
   If game shows aren't your cup of tea, consider:
   ``Reunion,'' from Blair Entertainment _ ``Capturing real human
drama, the half-hour strip program ... reunites people in a myriad
of situations, from long lost friends and loves to missing children
and parents.''
   ``Not for Men Only,'' from Viacom Enterprises _ ``Emmy
Award-winning host Ross Shafer will involve members of a studio
audience in sometimes heated discussion on a wide range of topics
from `Jealousy ... the Relationship Killer' to `Fifty Lies Men Tell
Women.'
   ``House Party with Steve Doocy,'' from Group W _ ```House Party'
is a lively and unique daily hour of useful information presented
in a humorous and entertaining way.'' It begins Jan. 22 in 30
markets.
   ``Dracula: The Series,'' also from Blair _ ``The series focuses
on Carl Dau (Dracula), billionaire international power broke, who
seeks global domination through the building of a high-tech network
of white-collar vampires.''
   ``Home Again with Bob Vila,'' Group W _ Vila, who left PBS'
high-rated program, `This Old House' ``will feature many of the
same program elements for which Vila won a wide following while
emphasizing affordable restoration, repair and remodeling hints for
average Americans on a limited budget.''
   ``Super Cop'' from Viacom Enterprises _ ``James A. Kelly, a
member of a law enforcement family dynasty, becomes the only person
able to wear a special suit equipped with futuristic technology
designed to fight crime by giving him extraordinary tactical
capabilities.''

<TEXT>
   A message purported to be from
Colombia's drug lords today declared the government the winner in
the war on drugs and offered to halt illegal activities in exchange
for an amnesty.
   The communique was given to Patricia Echavarria, who was set
free today after being kidnapped with her daughter Dec. 16. Mrs.
Echavarria is the wife of a prominent doctor in the drug capital of
Medellin.
   ``We accept the triumph of the state,'' said the communique from
The Extraditables, the armed wing of the nation's powerful drug
lords. ``Thus we will lay down our arms and abandon our objectives
for the benefit of the highest interests of the fatherland.''
   The communique came in response to a call Monday by the Catholic
Church and political leaders for drug cartels to release their
hostages and end drug trafficking.
   ``We submit to the existing legal establishment in the hope of
obtaining from the government and from society respect for our
rights and our return to our families and communities,'' it said.
   ``We have decided to suspend the shipment of drugs and surrender
the weapons, explosives, laboratories, hostages, the clandestine
landing strips and other effects related to our activities at such
a time as we are granted constitutional and legal guarantees,'' the
communique continued.
   Their statement appeared to demand an amnesty that would
guarantee they would not face criminal charges.
   The drug barons have previously demanded a full amnesty and an
end to extraditions of drug suspects to the United States.
   While President Virgilio Barco said Tuesday he would not rule
out talks with drug traffickers, Interior Minister Carlos Lemos
Simmonds said Colombian law does not allow an amnesty for common
criminals.
   Barco began his crackdown on the cocaine cartels after the
assassination in August of a leading presidential candidate. As
part of the crackdown, he revived an extradition treaty with the
United States, which drew up a list of the 12 most-wanted drug
traffickers.
   The Extraditables take their name from the list.
   The communique said Mrs. Echavarria and her daughter, Dina, had
been freed as proof of the cartels' desire to make peace.
   The two were released in a neighborhood built by Medellin cartel
leader Pablo Escobar Gaviria for the poor people of Medellin.
   In the 11-point message, The Extraditables said: ``We undertake
that there will be no explosive bombings in any part of the
national territory and have ordered the suspension of all type of
executions of political figures, government and labor officials,
members of the judiciary, newsmen, policemen and the military.''
   They also offered to act as mediators in efforts to end
activities by other groups operating outside the law, ``for the
sole purpose of ending the violence which harms and shatters our
Colombian fatherland.''
   So far, Colombia has sent 11 drug suspects to the United States
to face charges, but none is on the most-wanted list.
   In an effort to stop extraditions, traffickers responded with a
campaign of bombings and other violent attacks that killed at least
209 people.
   The government also believes drug traffickers bombed a Colombian
passenger jet that crashed outside Bogota in November, killing 107
people.
   The traffickers also are believed responsible for many of 85
kidnappings in Colombia in the last 45 days.
   For its part, the government has seized millions of dollars in
property and arrested hundreds of people to try to destroy the
private army of the leader of the Medellin cocaine cartel.
   It also has killed one of the leaders of the cartel, Gonzalo
Rodriguez Gacha, who died in a shootout with police Dec. 15 on
Colombia's north coast.
   On Tuesday, Barco for the first time said he would not rule out
the possibility of negotiating to end the drug war.
   At a news conference, Barco said in answer to a question about
the possibility of talks, ``We in the government are not
inflexible.''
   The communique Monday by the church and political leaders stated
openly what many Colombians have been saying privately: that the
nation does not have the resources to fight a long war against the
billionaire traffickers.
   The church and political leaders, including two former
presidents, suggested that in return for drug lords halting their
campaign of terror, they might expect ``less rigorous'' treatment
from the government.

   Ben Woods, former acting City Council
president, was sentenced to eight years in prison today for taking
more than $47,000 in payoffs to steer business to city contractors.
   U.S. District Judge Alan Bloch also placed Woods on three years'
probation after his release. During that period, he may not serve
as a public official.
   ``Your downfall is your greed and lack of character,'' the judge
said. ``This is not an individual who made a simple mistake or fell
to temptation. You are the author and manager of a complex plan to
extract bribes from people who wanted to work for the city.''
   Woods, 47, had faced up to 201 years in prison and $3.6 million
in fines. Hours after he resigned from the council Nov. 6, a jury
found him guilty of charges including conspiracy, extortion,
racketeering and tax evasion.
   He was convicted of accepting $11,000 from Michael Hartman to
help the contractor get housing contracts and to expedite payments
on a project.
   The two-term councilman also was convicted of accepting $36,727
from businessman Joseph Wozniak to help him sell concrete sealants
to city agencies.
   On Nov. 7, Bloch ordered Woods to forfeit the money.
   Hartman, 38, of suburban Pittsburgh, was convicted of
conspiracy, racketeering and filing a false corporate tax return,
and faces up to 28 years in jail and $750,000 in fines at
sentencing Thursday.
   Wozniak testified for the government under a grant of immunity.
   Woods became acting council president when Sophie Masloff left
the post. She became mayor in May 1988 upon the death of Mayor
Richard Caliguiri.

<TEXT>
   President Bush gave a Rose Garden welcome
today to Gen. Maxwell Thurman, commander of U.S. forces in Panama,
and said he wants the invasion troops there brought home ``as soon
as possible.''
   But, Bush said, ``There are still some security considerations.''
   ``I want to do what's right for Panama. I want to do what Panama
wants,'' the president told reporters.
   ``It's Panama's show now,'' said Bush, standing with Thurman and
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney outside the Oval Office.
   Bush, before heading inside for a National Security Council
meeting to discuss Panama and its needs, said the new government of
President Guillermo Endara ``is strengthening their democracy.''
   ``Democracy is on the move. ... We want to give them economic
help. We want to offer hope to the individuals there who are out of
work, some of it because of the sanctions we had imposed on
Panama,'' said Bush. ``So we're committed.''
   ``It's my objective to get the troops out and get back to the
levels before this military action,'' said Bush. He wants that done
``as soon as possible,'' Bush said.
   The United States more than doubled its forces to nearly 27,000
for the Dec. 20 invasion that toppled strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega, now in jail in Miami awaiting trial on drug-trafficking
charges. There were 12,000 troops there prior to the invasion.
   Thurman said that as of this morning, 18,900 U.S. troops are
left in the Latin nation, with 8,000 having already returned to the
states.
   ``Eight out and we've got about four or five (thousand) to go,''
said Bush.
   Asked if he wanted them out before the Feb. 15 drug summit in
Colombia, Bush indicated that was not a consideration, despite the
refusal by the president of Peru, Alan Garcia, to attend the summit
if the invasion troops are still in Panama.
   ``It has nothing to do with the summit in Cartagena at all,''
said Bush.
   He also denied that there have been difficulties lining up Latin
countries for Vice President Dan Quayle to visit on a fence-mending
mission to the region. Bush said he expects Quayle will go to
Panama.
   Quayle is due to attend a presidential inauguration in Honduras
next week, and is planning two other trips to Latin America. The
details of his itinerary have not yet been announced.
   Bush thanked Thurman and his troops ``for the outstanding job
they did for our country and Panama.''
   ``They did a dynamite job,'' the four-star general agreed.

   The strains of ``Danny Boy''
awakened Columbia commander Dan Brandenstein on his 47th birthday
today, and a chorus of ``Happy Birthday'' filled the cabin as the
shuttle circled Earth 200 miles in space.
   The astronaut corps serenaded him, and basketball star Larry
Bird radioed congratulations as the shuttle's five-member crew
settled in for another day of scientific experiments on the eighth
day of the 10-day mission.
   ``Congratulations to you and the crew on the slam dunk with
LDEF. Happy birthday and have a safe landing,'' said Boston
Celtics' star Bird.
   LDEF is the Long Duration Exposure Facility, the 11-ton science
laboratory the astronuts plucked from space on Friday and tucked
into the shuttle's cargo bay.
   The control center also played a recording made by the astronaut
corps, singing ``Happy Birthday'' to the ``Boss.'' Brandenstein is
chief of the 90-member corps.
   ``I was hoping that flying Mach 25 you didn't age and that this
wasn't going to happen this year,'' quipped Brandenstein. The
shuttle is flying 17,400 mph _ Mach 25, or 25 times the speed of
sound.
   Bird recorded his message on the spur of the moment earlier this
week when the Celtics toured Cape Canaveral between games with
Miami and Orlando.
   After the birthday wakeup, Columbia's crew plunged into its last
full day of experiments, growing protein crystals, melting and
resolidifying a metal in zero gravity and learning how the body
adapts to weightlessness in preparation for longer space trips.
   Shortly after 11 a.m., one of two smoke alarms went off in a bay
where computer equipment is stored. But the astronauts found no
evidence of smoke or damage to the equipment, which includes the
shuttle's guidance systems.
   ``A very unexpected and unattributable alert ... at this point
considered a false alarm,'' Mission Control commentator Jeff Carr
said.
   Earlier, lead flight director Al Pennington at NASA reported the
spaceship was ``operating just beautifully. We're in good shape.''
   Pilot Jim Wetherbee and mission specialists Bonnie Dunbar,
Marsha Ivins and David Low joined Brandenstein in working quietly,
with communications between ground and spaceship kept to a minimum,
so they could concentrate on their work.
   On Thursday, the astronauts will start packing up the
experiments and other equipment for Friday's return to Earth. A
darkness landing is scheduled at 2:55 a.m. PST at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration reported that
some of Edwards' dry lakebed runways were not useable because of
recent rains, but the concrete strip Brandenstein planned to touch
down on was fine. Good weather also was expected.

   The owner of a Renoir dance hall scene lauded as
``a page of history'' is seeking to sell the painting for $40
million to $50 million.
   Sotheby's on Tuesday said ``Au Moulin de la Galette'' will be
auctioned May 16.
   The painting is being sold by Betsey Cushing Whitney, widow of
investor John Hay Whitney, who bought the work in 1929. Whitney was
an ambassador to Britain and publisher of The New York Herald
Tribune. He died in 1982.
   ``Au Moulin de la Galette,'' painted in 1876 and acclaimed for
its light, shadow and movement, depicts an outdoor dance hall in
Montmartre, the bohemian area of Paris frequented by avant-garde
writers, painters and actors.
   The painting was Renoir's first crowd scene, and many of his
friends are in the background.
   Biographer Georges Rivere, who is depicted in the work,
described the painting as ``a page of history, a precious moment of
Paris life depicted with rigorous examination.''
   A larger version is in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris.
   The most ever paid for a work was $53.9 million in 1987 for van
Gogh's ``Irises,'' bought from Mrs. Whitney's nephew, John Whitney
Payson.
   Although Payson got paid, Sotheby's recently announced the deal
fell through because Australian tycoon Alan Bond could not repay a
loan to the auction house.

<TEXT>
   Men in Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest
countries, have a better chance than men in Harlem of living past
age 40, a study shows.
   When adjusted for age, the death rate in Harlem, a poor black
neighborhood in upper Manhattan, was the highest in New York and
more than double that of U.S. whites, the researchers found.
   The report, compiled by Drs. Colin McCord and Harold P. Freeman
of Harlem Hospital, was published in Thursday's New England Journal
of Medicine. The findings were based on an analysis of New York's
central Harlem health district, where 96 percent of the population
is black and 41 percent live below the poverty line.
   The researchers found that 6,415 people died in Harlem from 1978
to 1981. If the death rate in Harlem had been the same as for
whites across the United States, 3,994 would have died.
Eighty-seven percent of the 2,421 excess deaths were in people
under age 65.
   To dramatize their figures, the researchers noted that in
Bangladesh, 55 percent of men and 50 percent of women live to age
65. In Harlem, 40 percent of men and 65 percent of women live this
long.
   Cirrhosis, homicide, accidents, drug dependency and alcohol use
were considered to be the most important underlying causes of death
in 35 percent of all those under 65. For Harlem residents over age
75, the death rate was essentially the same as for U.S. whites.
   The study also found that the rate of hospital admissions in
Harlem was 26 percent higher than in the rest of the city.
   ``A major political and financial commitment will be needed to
eradicate the root causes of this high mortality _ vicious poverty
and inadequate access to the basic health care that is the right of
all Americans,'' the authors wrote.
   In a separate letter to the editor, Christopher J.L. Murray of
Harvard's Center for Population Studies said a World Bank study
also shows that blacks nationwide have a substantially elevated
risk of dying at an early age.
   Sixteen percent of American males die between ages 15 and 60,
compared with 30 percent of black men. Nine percent of white
females die between those ages, compared with 16 percent of black
women.
   He said the high death rate among black men exceeds the rates in
Gambia, India and El Salvador.
   He said a major reason for the excess deaths among American
black men was injuries, most of them homicides. However, they also
had a higher risk of dying from some diseases, such as cancer and
heart disease.

   Hanging dead cats from an outdoor Christmas
tree and failing to care for a pet goat landed members of a
Louisiana Tech University fraternity in court, officials said.
   The local animal control official, Stuart Hitt, said the two
dead cats found during a Dec. 13 investigation apparently were
killed by cars, not by fraternity members.
   So a charge of failure to dispose of a carcass was thrown out
Tuesday by Municipal Judge Robert C. James.
   ``It was a tasteless pledge-class prank,'' said Matt Saurage,
president of the Delta Kappa Epsilon chapter. ``Only a couple of
guys were involved, and they've been reprimanded.''
   The same December investigation led to an animal cruelty charge
when it was found that a fraternity mascot, a goat called ``Wool E.
Goat,'' had heartworms and hadn't received treatment.
   James said that case would be suspended without a trial date if
the chapter paid for the goat's care, accepted the university's
sanctions of probation until mid-May and 100 hours of community
service, and allowed no more animals at the house.

   A quadriplegic who won a court battle
for the right to turn off the ventilator that keeps him alive is
leaving the machine running and is looking for a job.
   After discussions with staff members at United Cerebral Palsy of
Greater Birmingham and other advocates for the disabled, Larry
McAfee has entered an employment program run by UCP for people with
disabilities.
   ``The amount of time they're spending with me is impressive,''
McAfee said Tuesday from his bed at the Briarcliff Nursing Home in
Alabaster, outside Birmingham. ``Their sense of total commitment
has been stimulating.''
   McAfee, a mechanical engineer and sportsman before a 1985
motorcycle accident left him paralyzed below the chin, called
job-hunting ``an avenue I wanted to explore.''
   He said Brenda Carson, an employment specialist with the
Birmingham cerebral palsy group, and her colleagues ``have not only
caught my interest but stimulated my desire to give it a real good
try. If it doesn't work out, then it doesn't work out.''
   McAfee, 33, came to Briarcliff from Atlanta in August because of
its special unit for ventilator-dependent patients.
   He decided life dependent on a machine was not worth pursuing
and asked a judge in his home Fulton County, Ga., for permission to
turn off his breathing system. Judge Edward Johnson ruled in
McAfee's favor in September, and the Georgia Supreme Court upheld
the decision in November.
   By that point, however, several people in the Birmingham area
who work with the disabled had befriended him and offered him hope
of something other than life in an institution.
   Ms. Carson said McAfee's experience, which includes designing
industrial conveyor belt systems and other equipment, gives him
marketable skills.
   Though he no longer can visit job sites, he would be able to do
computer-assisted design, she said. McAfee said he already has the
necessary computer equipment and software.
   ``We feel there is a very good prospect of finding an employer
who can use his talents,'' Ms. Carson said.

<HEAD>Ag Department Says US Beefing Up Beef Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When it comes to agricultural exports, beef
used to be the puny kid on the block. But lately, says the
Agriculture Department, beef has put on some muscle and is still
growing.
   According to the latest USDA estimates, beef exports jumped
about 57 percent last year to nearly 1.07 billion pounds from 680
million in 1988. An additional increase of at least 12 percent to
1.2 billion pounds is expected in 1990.
   Japan, which accounts for about two-thirds of all U.S. beef
exports, opened its doors wider last year and has agreed to boost
the 1990 quota by an additional 60,000 metric tons, approximately
132.3 million pounds.
   ``The U.S. will have to share this market with the Australians,
who are expected to price their beef very competitively,'' said
Steve Reed of the department's Economic Research Service.
   Although Australian beef output was down last year because of
cattle herd rebuilding, production is expected to rise in 1990 _
and a larger share probably will be earmarked for the Japanese
market.
   Reed, writing in the January issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine, said Japan's storage facilities for frozen beef are
strained because of large inventories. A substantial amount of U.S.
beef is frozen, he said, and a larger portion of Australian beef is
fresh chilled.
   ``Some beef stockpiling in Japan likely occurred at the
beginning of 1989 under the expectation of strong consumer
demand,'' he said. ``Retail beef prices do not yet reflect the
lower prices for imported beef under the new system.''
   Reed said also there are ``apparently some problem in developing
outlets for frozen U.S. beef'' in Japan.
   According to a USDA supply-and-demand analysis last week,
exports estimated at 1.2 billion pounds this year will comprise 5.1
percent of U.S. beef output projected at 23.5 billion pounds.
   In 1989, the 1.07 billion pounds exported were equal to about
4.6 percent of total U.S. beef production. The 680 million pounds
exported in 1988 was 2.9 percent.
   Despite the increase in overseas sales, the United States is
still a net importer of beef. This year's shipments, primarily from
Australia and New Zealand but also more than a dozen other
countries, are forecast at 2.08 billion pounds, nearly twice the
amount of exports.

   Agriculture Department scientists are looking
at some foreign grasses to see if drought-resistant livestock
pastures can be developed to help U.S. cattle and sheep producers.
   A prairie brome grass called Matua from New Zealand shows
promise for the eastern United States. It was brought to the United
States in 1986 as a cool-season grass _ spring and fall _ for
grazing or hay.
   Gerald A. Jung of the department's Agricultural Research Service
said Matua ``was slowed down by the 1988 drought'' in central
Pennsylvania but added that ``it thrived compared to other
cool-season grasses.''
   Jung works at the agency's regional pasture research laboratory
in University Park, Pa. His findings were reported here recently by
the department.
   ``In our tests in Pennsylvania last year, Matua prairie grass
remained green and growing into December,'' he said. ``That's about
a month after other cool-season grasses went dormant for the
winter.''
   Jung said Matua is not readily available in the United States
and that about five more years of tests will be required.
   Plant explorers also have returned from two expeditions to the
Soviet Union with more than 1,000 forage and grass seed samples,
the USDA agency said. The eventual payoff could be new varieties of
range grasses that come up annually and also extend the grazing
season in the fall and winter.
   Kay H. Asay, plant geneticist at the agency's forage and range
laboratory in Logan, Utah, said he and other scientists collected
the samples over the last two summers. Many of the collections will
be grown from seed and evaluated this summer, he said.

   The United States will allow a 14 percent
increase in the amount of foreign sugar that can be imported by
U.S. processors from 39 countries.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Tuesday the increase
boosts the sugar import quota to 2,584,865 metric tons for the
period Jan. 1, 1989, through Sept. 30, 1990, an increase of 325,000
tons.
   ``This change in the level of the quota is necessary to counter
the tightness in domestic sugar supplies caused by the unexpectedly
low production of beet sugar and damage to the Florida and Texas
sugar cane crops resulting from the December freeze,'' Yeutter said.
   Quotas are used to restrict the amount of foreign sugar that can
enter the United States, thus protecting domestic producers from
lower-priced foreign sugar being dumped on the U.S. market.

   Nationwide public sector strikes spread
Wednesday, raising fears that cities and towns will be inundated
with uncollected garbage.
   Municipal employees began a five-day nationwide strike in
solidarity with about 17,000 temporary colleagues who have been off
the job for six days and are demanding permanent employment. The
temporary workers extended their walkout until Monday.
   In addition, 87,000 temporary civil service employees have been
on strike since last week.
   The temporary municipal and civil service workers were hired by
the outgoing Socialist government prior to general elections in the
summer. A government formed in November to tackle Greece's $1.9
billion budget deficit has pledged to freeze public sector hiring.
   The permanent municipal employees are demanding higher wages and
improved fringe benefits.
   Monthly salaries for municipal employees range from $375 to $438.
   In Athens, garbage blocked sidewalks and sidestreets downtown,
as well as in suburbs. The government asked residents to store
their garbage on their balconies until the walkout ended.

   East German Communists said today the
country's peaceful revolution has taken a dangerous turn that could
threaten free elections planned for May.
   The warning came in a newspaper editorial that denounced the
storming on Monday of secret police headquarters in East Berlin and
blamed it on the New Forum opposition group.
   New Forum, which organized the demonstration that led to the
rampage, denied it was to blame for the violence, although the
flier calling for the protest did call on people to bring stones.
   ``The stones that were to be taken along were meant only to
symbolically seal up the doors of the building,'' New Forum
spokesman Rainer Rodenwald said.
   ``The fliers we sent out clearly said `no violence,''' the
spokesman said. ``There is no one from New Forum who wanted or
planned the violence.''
   Late today, the Christian Democratic Party threatened to bring
down Communist Premier Hans Modrow's coalition government by
leaving it. The Christian Democrats, who control three of the 27
Cabinet seats, object to the Communists' continued grip on power
before the May 6 elections.
   Christian Democratic spokesman Lothar Lueck said his party's
leadership was showing ``a very strong tendency to leave the
government.'' West Germany's ARD television said a decision was
expected during a party meeting on Friday.
   The party also threatened to quit the Cabinet last week.
   The coalition has been running the country since a popular
uprising ousted the nation's hard-line Communist government, and
the coalition is supposed to step down once it can be replaced by a
freely elected government.
   New Forum, East Germany's largest pro-democracy movement, has
more than 200,000 members nationwide. The movement has repeated its
call to avoid violence and has promised to investigate Monday's
incident.
   The official Communist Party daily said today the autumn
revolution has ``lost its innocence.''
   ``Is the revolution eating its own children?'' Neues Deutschland
asked in its front-page editorial, recalling the line from
playwright Georg Buechner's account of the violence of the French
Revolution.
   ``No one should underestimate that question, since violence has
increased and so has fear,'' the newspaper said. ``Voting freely on
May 6 also means voting free of fear.'' Free elections are
scheduled May 6.
   The newspaper called for ``a security partnership'' linking
government, opposition and law enforcement officials to guarantee
free elections. It said the rampage at the secret police
headquarters caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage.
   Since the fall of hard-line leader Erich Honecker on Oct. 18,
East Germany's leaders routinely have called for calm and warned
that violence could hurt efforts to establish true democracy in the
country.
   Nationwide, protests have continued by hundreds of thousands of
people who have demanded that the Communists give up their virtual
control of the government, media, bureaucracy and economy.
   The unrest apparently prompted Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West
Germany to scrap plans for negotiating stronger ties with the
government. Kohl said Tuesday the talks could wait until after free
elections.
   Kohl said the East German situation has become ``more
difficult,'' adding that ``quick and effective measures'' were
needed to shore up the economy.
   Modrow's government has called for scrapping centrally planned
socialism and replacing it with a free-market system.
   It has thus started to abolish state subsidies by raising prices
for children's clothes and related articles. Apartment rents and
prices of other essentials are also to rise.
   The price hikes have sent panic through a population accustomed
to decades of rock-bottom prices for goods, services and housing.
   Modrow, visiting West Berlin on Tuesday, blamed the
pro-democracy opposition for Monday's incident.
   ``I hope the storming remains a one-time event and isn't any
kind of signal,'' Modrow said during his visit, the first by an
East German premier to the Western sector.
   He complained he had been greeted with shouts of ``red pig''
after he rushed to the storming scene in an attempt to halt the
rampage.
   Tens of thousands of people took part in the rampage Monday
night after a demonstration against the dreaded secret police
force, which Modrow has promised to have completely dismantled by
June 30.
   Many of the demonstrators looted the building, carrying away
clothing, bottles of wine and various pieces of equipment.

   Pope John Paul II bounced back from a bout
of flu and held his general audience Wednesday, but he admitted he
was still feeling the effects of the illness that has struck
millions in Italy.
   John Paul, 69, was down with fever and canceled his activities
Monday and Tuesday.
   Wednesday's audience was shortened by 30 minutes, and he
refrained from picking up and embracing children.
   ``The Italian press has written that the pope has the Chinese
flu,'' the pope told 4,000 pilgrims and tourists, including about
300 from the Soviet Union. ``This explains the brevity of the
speeches and salutes.
   ``I must behave as a person still not completely well,'' he said.
   The flu began hitting Italians in December, starting mainly in
northern Italy and moving down the peninsula.
   The pope greeted 300 people from Leningrad and another
delegation from Lithuania, a heavily Roman Catholic area, praising
the Lithuanians' ``deep faith and fidelity'' to the Vatican.

   Government officials were criticized Wednesday for
using a photo of a wounded Chinese student to illustrate a voter
registration campaign.
   The ad, published by the Scottish Office which governs Scotland,
showed a student being carried away prostrate on a delivery
bicycle. It was taken after Chinese troops crushed pro-democracy
demonstrators in Beijing on June 3-4.
   The picture appeared in several Scottish newspapers in September
above a caption that said: ``You'll only have to give your name and
address.''
   The Advertising Standards Authority, an independent watchdog
organization, said in its latest report that it received 20
complaints from people who believed it was in ``appallingly bad
taste.''
   It said the Scottish Office defended it as being a reminder to
the public of the importance of the right to vote in a free
society. But it believed the argument ``did not justify this
deplorable approach.''
   The Scottish Office said: ``We regret that some people found it
distressing. It was never our intention to shock or offend. The
advertisement will not be used again.''

<TEXT>
   Israeli and Egyptian leaders held separate
talks today with U.S. officials about peace efforts in the Middle
East amid reports that a three-way meeting could take place next
month.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III would like a meeting that
would include himself and the foreign ministers of Egypt and Israel
as the first step toward organizing elections among Palestinians in
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Egypt, the only Arab country that has a peace treaty with
Israel, is acting as a channel for the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which the Israelis want to exclude from the peace
process.
   In Jerusalem, Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu quoted
Baker as saying the trilateral meeting he has been pushing for
could take place in Washington by the end of February.
   In a telephone conversation Tuesday with Israeli Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens, Baker estimated ``the trilateral meeting of
foreign ministers will be held by the end of February,'' Netanyahu
told Israel's parliament.
   ``I had a very interesting and useful discussion with Secretary
Baker and we are going to see each other again, and then maybe at
the end of the visit, probably on Friday, I'll have something more
to say,'' Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid told
reporters here Tuesday.
   Baker met again Tuesday night with Abdel-Meguid at the foreign
minister's hotel. Details were not disclosed.
   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin had appointments today
with national security adviser Brent Scowcroft, Vice President Dan
Quayle and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   Rabin was scheduled to see Baker on Thursday.
   Also, Lebanese Finance Minister Ali Khalil arrived today amid
news reports that his Syrian-backed government was seeking weapons
from the United States to build up its military strength against
Maronite Christian holdouts.
   State Department officials refused to discuss the reports.
   Meanwhile, Israel Television reported that Vice Premier and
Finance Minister Shimon Peres will meet with Egypt's President
Hosni Mubarak in Cairo on Jan. 24 in an effort to break the
stalemate in the Middle East peace process.
   The talks would be the first top-level encounter between Israeli
and Egyptian officials since Rabin's trip to Cairo and talks with
Mubarak in September 1989. Aides to Peres could not be reached for
comment.
   Abdel-Meguid said he had no plan for a three-way meeting in
Washington. At the Israeli embassy, spokeswoman Ruth Yaron said it
would take place if any of the three sides wanted it.
   The Egyptians also were concerned with money matters. Salah
Hamed, governor of Egypt's central bank, came with Abdel-Meguid and
was meeting with the International Monetary Fund to discuss getting
a new loan for Egypt. The World Bank said the country's debts had
reached almost $50 billion by the end of 1988, one of the largest
figures in the Third World.
   A new loan from the fund would be seen as a sign of confidence
in Egypt's government and could help it get a postponement of
payments on what it already owes. Michel Camdessus, the fund's
managing director, wants a cut in Egypt's budget deficit and other
difficult policy measures by Mubarak's government before he will
agree to lend more.
   Egypt gets $2 billion in aid a year from the United States and
Israel receives $3 billion.
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the minority leader, suggested on Tuesday
that Egypt, Israel and other favored recipients take a 5 percent
cut _ $100 million for Egypt and $150 million for Israel _ so the
United States can contribute more to help Eastern Europe.

   An Army major whose wife fell over an
eighth-floor hotel railing while he was carrying her has been
ordered to stand trial on assault in the incident.
   Maj. David Schneider, 34, told police at the time of the Nov. 4
incident that he had picked up his wife in a romantic gesture but
stumbled.
   The prosecutors' sole witness at Tuesday's preliminary hearing,
Chantel McCutchen, 15, of Blue Springs, said she saw Schneider flip
his wife over the 3-foot, 7-inch railing overlooking the hotel's
lobby.
   Deborah A. Schneifer, 34, suffered multiple fractures to both
legs and a broken pelvis in the 80-foot fall. She landed on a
restaurant table.
   Platte County Associate Circuit Judge Ward Stuckey ordered
Schneider, of Fort Leavenworth, Kan., to stand trial and set a Jan.
25 arraignment.
   Mrs. Schneider, who uses a walker, apparently has no memory of
the incident, prosecutors said. She no longer lives with her
husband.

   A new roadblock has been thrown up in the
7-year-old battle to build the Presidential Parkway that would link
downtown Atlanta to the Carter Center, the presidential library on
the outskirts of the city.
   The City Council voted 15-2 Tuesday to oppose construction, even
though the Georgia Supreme Court already has ruled the city cannot
rescind its support first voted by the council in 1982.
   Council member Bill Campbell, a parkway foe who represents the
district through which the 2.4-mile road would run, sponsored the
legislation. The state Department of Transportation is pushing the
project to provide better access to surrounding suburbs.
   Opponents of the road contend it is too expensive, unnecessary
and would damage historic Atlanta parks and neighborhoods.

throughout the country.
   Jan. 16
   The News-Leader, Springfield, Mo., on Soviet Unrest:
   Mikhail Gorbachev has come face to face with the horror of blind
hatred in two Soviet provinces. One is Christian: Armenia. The
other is Shiite Moslem: Azerbaijan. They share one attribute:
hatred for its own sake.
   Thus what began as a territorial dispute over Nagorno Karabakh _
an Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan _ has become the latest
threat to Mikhail Gorbachev's goodwill and perhaps to his future.
   The hideous carnage of Armenians in a section of Baku,
Azerbaijan, is precisely the kind of religious hatred that has
destroyed entire cultures. Earlier in this century, Armenia was the
target of one of the most severe acts of genocide in history.
   The questions for Americans is a simple one: Where is the
outcry? From Americans, most especially Christians? From Americans
of Armenian descent? From the world?

   The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle on El Salvador:
   President Alfredo Cristiani, to his great credit, has taken the
pivotal first step in bringing to justice the killers of six Jesuit
priests and two Salvadoran witnesses in a Nov. 16 massacre in El
Salvador. Never before has a military officer ranking as high as
Col. Guillermo Alfredo Benavides Moreno been accused of a human
rights crime.
   The arrests so far undoubtedly have sent shock waves through the
military's ranks. This could precipitate a confrontation with the
civilian government, and with ... Cristiani's own human rights
feelings.
   The president had to have known the risks he was taking in
pursuing the case thus far, and may have chosen this way to assert
civilian control over the military. ...
   How the priests' murder is resolved will determine whether El
Salvador is a nation of laws and whether it's deserving of the free
world's continued favor.

   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on China:
   The People's Daily says China has been restored to ``complete
normality.'' Sadly, what's normal to Beijing's official press is a
climate of intense political repression that mocks the recent
lifting of martial law.
   It was disturbing, then, to find the Bush administration
welcoming the news about martial law as if it were a move of
substance. The president praised the announcement by Prime Minister
Li Peng as a ``very sound step'' and ``very positive'' _ without
noting that China's rulers have actually tightened their grip on
society.
   For years after Richard Nixon reopened diplomatic ties to
Beijing back in 1972, Americans overlooked human rights abuses in
China. Only last summer's images of tanks crushing the bodies of
peaceful protesters cured the American public of its romance with
this totalitarian regime.
   Curiously, George Bush alone remains all discretion, too polite
to publicly criticize the country where he served as President
Gerald Ford's ambassador.
   Bush is right to keep an eye on long-term relations with China.
That legitimate purpose doesn't mean he should laud a cosmetic move
as if it were a win for liberty.

   The West Central Tribune, Willmar, Minn., on Noriega:
   Anybody who thinks General Manuel Noriega walked out of Panama
to spend the rest of his life in a U.S. jail cell is either very
naive or does not understand politics.
   The general, obviously a multimillionaire, maybe a billionaire,
is accustomed to the best in life. And there's no question he
either has arranged, or fully intends, to ultimately return to that
lifestyle. Had he thought otherwise, he undoubtedly would have
flown the coop, as have other dictators, and taken up residency in
a country of one of his buddies.
   The money he stashed away is probably still hidden. It is either
under secret bank codes or entrusted to former aides. His hierarchy
also is not only still in Panama, but probably remains in positions
of authority.
   The former general is unquestionably a guy who raped his
country. But dumb he ain't. And in politics, as we all know, there
are deals and counterdeals, many of which are secret. Some
ultimately surface, but many never do.
   As the saying goes, ``If we were betting people, we'd hock the
farm,'' that before many years pass, the general will undoubtedly
be out and about.

   Mail Tribune, Medford, Ore., on defense spending:
   Despite changes worldwide that signal a thaw in the Cold War,
President Bush doesn't appear ready yet to cut into the fat of the
Pentagon's budget. Congress may have to play the role of butcher to
ensure that the bloated defense establishment created in the 1980s
doesn't continue to gorge itself in the 1990s.
   Bush and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney reportedly favor a
five-year defense plan to increase spending from the $293 billion
level in the 1990 budget to $312 billion by 1995. The argument used
to support this approach is that the amounts actually represent a 2
percent annual reduction after inflation. ...
   In Washington ... this is known as cutting a budget. ...
   This costly war machine is a legacy of former President Ronald
Reagan. In 1981 he began an eight-year defense spending spree that
was unparalleled in U.S. history. He said the buildup was necessary
to stay ahead of the Soviet Union ... and to protect U.S. interests
around the globe.
   Today, the Soviet Union is in a state of economic collapse. Its
fighting force, the armies of the Warsaw Pact nations, has
disintegrated in the face of the pro-democracy movement sweeping
Eastern Europe. ...
   Based on recent events, defense spending in the $200 billion
range for the '90s should be adequate.

   Idahonian, Moscow, Idaho, on airline threats:
   It is as refreshing as it is rare to see candor from an airline,
especially when such openness affects revenue. One sterling example
is the manner in which Northwest Airlines handled a bomb threat to
an international flight over the New Year's weekend. The action
stands in stark contrast to Pan American's fatal silence a year
earlier.
   When Northwest was threatened with sabotage to its
Paris-to-Detroit DC10 flight, it promptly informed potential
passengers of the danger. Stepped-up security precautions
notwithstanding, it allowed ticketed passengers to postpone their
flights or book passage on a competing airline.
   About three dozen people did so. The flight made it safely to
its U.S. destination. A week later, a Belfast teen-ager was
arrested on a charge of making the threat.
   A year ago Christmas, Pan Am flight 103 from Frankfurt to New
York also was under a bomb threat information known only to Pan Am
and the U.S. State Department. Fearing loss of business if the
flying public knew of the threat, the information deliberately was
kept confidential.
   We all know, of course, what happened over Lockerbie, Scotland,
on Dec. 21, 1988.
   Northwest took the responsible route, even when it most
certainly would mean a loss of fares. Travelers nearly always have
a choice of air carriers. They might consider rewarding Northwest
for its special concern for our safety the next time they fly to a
destination served by that airline.

   The Register-Herald, Beckley, W.Va., on disposable diapers:
   Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin has stirred considerable
controversy with her proposal to ban all disposable diapers. The
move may be a signal of what is to come nationwide.
   Last year Kunin was successful in making Vermont the first state
to ban the sale of vehicles which use ozone-depleting chemicals in
air conditioning. If the diaper ban becomes law, Vermont will be
the first state to prohibit all disposable diapers. Nebraska has a
similar ban, although it permits sale of biodegradable diapers.
   Kunin argues that while disposables have a usable life of ``a
few hours,'' their decomposition takes hundreds of years in dumps.
According to estimates, about 85 percent of all parents use
disposable diapers exclusively, and the disposables account for
about two percent of the nation's waste. Vermont officials estimate
that in their state alone some 43 million diapers go to the dump
annually.
   America is largely a ``throw away'' society. Convenience has
supplanted prudence and many reusable resources are discarded
rather than re-employed in the manufacturing process. While today's
society may find that affordable, future generations may find it
regrettable. ...
   The Bush administration has backed off from a proposal to tax
paper, glass, plastic and metals that aren't recycled. That was
done to make sure the president lived up to his ``no new taxes''
pledge. But Bush also promised to gear the nation into a mindset of
recycling and conserving. He needs to act on that immediately.
   Gov. Kunin may be paving the way for him.

<TEXT>
   The Americans for Democratic Action, long
considered the nation's leading liberal group, said Wednesday the
Bush administration failed in its first year to be kinder and
gentler to the poor and threatened the Constitution with its
invasion of Panama.
   ``Americans should be prepared to fight and die for what is
right,'' Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., told a news conference. ``The
question I ask is whether it was morally and constitutionally
right.''
   Rangel, president of the 47-year-old liberal group, said that
the Democratic leadership of the House as well as the news media
have failed to be critical enough of President Bush's record. The
comments came as part of what ADA billed as a report card on the
first year of the administration.
   The Harlem congressman acknowledged Bush scores high in
nationwide polls but faulted the president on education, minority
rights, the environment, homelessness, drug addiction and abortion.
He said poverty is worsening.
   Rangel said that as a former congressman, Bush is often treated
as a friend by House leaders and thus his policies do not come in
for sufficient criticism. He said the news media liked the Panama
invasion and as a result, ``the press hysterically supports the
tattering of the Constitution of the United States.''
   He said national drug policy director William Bennett has been
``a real disappointment'' and was skeptical about the
administration's war against drugs. ``I don't see anything to
knock, I don't see anything to support. I don't know where Bill
Bennett is.''
   ``Obviously the president has done a lot of things right if you
are middle class and white and really involved in military
maneuvers,'' Rangel said. ``I give the president an A for military
preparedness, holding down the minimum wage and staying out of
getting involved with the homeless. ...''
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., a former ADA president, told the
news conference that ``in civil rights, Mr. Bush has not been
kinder and gentler.''
   He said the civil rights division of the Justice Department has
a vacancy in its top position and as a result ``people who have
been discriminated against, whose civil rights have been violated,
have no champion.''
   The Democratic-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee killed the
administration's nomination of former Wayne County, Mich., sheriff
William Lucas for that position, calling the
Democrat-turned-Republican unqualified.

   Snakes are popular here, or at least
the boa constrictor is that slithered its way into a second-floor
apartment and was found wrapped around a toilet.
   ``I had no idea so many people were all that attached to
snakes,'' said police spokesman Jerry Fisher after the department
in this Houston suburb took more than 100 calls from people wanting
the snake. ``The phone has not stopped ringing for five seconds
around here.''
   The snake was first spotted by a stunned Chris Atkinson, when he
got out of bed to use the bathroom at 4 a.m. Monday. The boa was
coiled in and around his commode.
   One of those wanting to adopt the 6-foot-long snake was Bob
Miller, director of the Living Materials Center at La Porte High
School, located in another Houston suburb.
   Miller said he would like the snake for a breeding program.
   Fisher said the police department will wait a couple of days to
see if the snake's owner surfaces.
   Atkinson has said he has no plans to keep the snake, joking that
he probably could only use it as ``a new pair of boots, maybe.''
   If the snake is adopted, Fisher said he may hold a drawing for
all those who want it and give it to the winner.
   But they won't be able to keep it in League City. Owning a wild
or exotic pet is illegal and punishable by fines of up to $200.

   The director of a Dallas high school marching band
is doing more than just putting his students through rigorous
workouts in anticipation of a trip to Ireland to march in the St.
Patrick's Day Parade.
   ``I'm also looking for a good discount on 80 pairs of longjohns
underwear,'' said Derle Long, director of the W.T. White High
School band. ``It can be cold, damp and very uncomfortable in
Dublin in mid-march.''
   Long underwear isn't often needed in the North Texas city. So
Long is scouting around, trying to get a good, affordable deal.
   ``We hope we won't need them,'' said Long, who is still trying
to raise funds for the trip. ``We're praying for sunshine.''
   The band director said he intends to wear battery-powered
hunting socks to keep his feet warm during the parade.

   The Seattle Times on the exclusionary rule:
   As Eastern Europe struggles with the concept of individual
rights, the U.S. Supreme Court continues to make the gritty
decisions that convert ideas into a way of life.
   Last week the court affirmed a principle known as the
exclusionary rule, which requires that illegally obtained evidence
be excluded from criminal trials.
   For 75 years, the court has said society has more to fear from
police misconduct than the consequences of letting a guilty person
go free.
   Very narrow exceptions have been allowed over the years, most
recently in 1984. The latest challege involved an Illinois murder
case and the use of illegal evidence to impeach the credibility of
a defense witness.
   A majority of the court, including a justice who had written an
earlier narrowing of the exclusionary rule, said the conviction
must be overturned.
   Justice William Brennan said that while arriving at the truth is
important, the suppression of valid but illegal evidence is
necessary to protect constitutional rights:
   ``So long as we are committed to protecting people from the
disregard of their constitutional rights ... inadmissibility of
illegally obtained evidence must remain the rule, not the
exception,'' Brennan wrote for the 5-4 majority.
   Living up to tough rules is the test of a true democracy.

   The Milwaukee Journal on the NCAA convention:
   The National Collegiate Athletic Association recently held what
its executive director aptly called a ``convention of the
student-athlete.'' The meeting was dominated not so much by debate
over the rules of sport as by concern over the intense and often
competing social pressures that are put upon student-athletes and
the schools they attend.
   With one important exception, the convention delegates
confronted these issues in a way that will ease such stresses.
   That single exception was the NCAA's adoption of Proposition 26,
which significantly undercut a controversial measure the NCAA
enacted last year in an effort to encourage scholastic achievement.
That measure, called Proposition 42, denied athletic scholarships
to incoming freshmen who failed to meet basic academic requirements
while in high school. Prop 42 had sent a much-needed message to
these young people: If you want an athletic scholarship to college,
better start hitting the books now.
   Proposition 26 does not repeal Prop 42's restriction on athletic
scholarships, but does allow universities to grant aid based on
financial need to freshmen athletes who fail to cut the mustard in
their high school classrooms. In short, the NCAA created a giant
loophole in Prop 42. At some schools, the new measure might also
mean less scholarship money for poor but academically motivated
students who happen not to be athletes.
   But at its meeting, the NCAA did reduce the length of the
basketball season and spring football practice. That will make it
possible for students to give more attention to their most
important responsibility, intellectual development.
   The NCAA also approved a plan to conduct random, year-round drug
testing of players in major football programs. The link between
big-time sports and big-time money has become so intimate, and
competition has become so ferocious, that many athletes have
resorted to drugs that they think will let them run a little
faster, grow a little stronger, hit a little harder. But these
performance-enhancing drugs have dangerous side-effects. They
belong in doctors' offices, not in athletes' lockers, and testing
is one of the few ways to help make sure of that.
   The mere fact that academics, drugs and other social issues
dominated the NCAA agenda shows that the major universities are
aware of the problems they face. However imperfectly, the NCAA has
begun to confront that new challenge and opportunity.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on the America's Cup:
   The America's Cup is again generating news, not a result of
tautly-set, wind-filled sails driving sleek hulls through
white-capped waves, but because of litigation in the New York State
Court of Appeals.
   At issue is the San Diego Yacht Club's use of a 6,000-pound
catamaran manned by a crew of five and powered by a high technology
air-foil and rigid sail in a successful 1988 American defense of
the Cup.
   (A group of former America's Cup compeition skippers) contend
this premier sailing competition will become purely an exhibition
unless the New York Court voids the ``Stars and Stripes'' victory.
...
   They are right. The spirit of the America's Cup is one of honest
competition involving men and boats, seamanship and design, skilled
crews and the vagaries of the wind and sea.
   A catamaran sailing against a sloop is akin to a 12-meter yacht
sailing against a barge unfurling a bedsheet _ no contest.
   May the 12-meter yachts that have been entered in fair and
honest competitions since their development in the years shortly
before and after World War II return to the sea in glorious pursuit
of the America's Cup and what it was meant to stand for.

   Princess Anne, daughter of a reigning monarch,
says she wishes her children had better role models.
   ``I look around and wonder what sort of examples they have to
look up to now,'' the daughter of Queen Elizabeth II told a BBC
radio interviewer Wednesday. ``That worries me. I don't think there
are very many ... I think their elder generation is to blame for
that.''
   Anne, 39, who separated from her husband, Capt. Mark Phillips,
in August, said she is not very strict with her 12-year-old son and
8-year-old daughter.
   ``I don't go along with the `seen and not heard.' It would be
very nice but I think it's rather an impractical suggestion
really,'' said the princess.
   She said her travels on behalf of the Save the Children's Fund,
of which she is president, have made her more concerned about what
she sees at home.
   ``You find if you go to any number of countries where the small
rural communities have very strict codes of behavior you don't find
much thieving and pilfering, and murder is almost unheard of,'' the
princess said.

   A 68-year-old mansion in fashionable Highland Park
has been listed for sale by Caroline and Nelson Bunker Hunt, who
emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings earlier this month.
   The asking price on the six-bedroom, six-bath mansion
overlooking Turtle Creek is $2.8 million. The house has marble
fireplaces and a garden room with an Italian tile floor.
   Mrs. Hunt said in a recent interview that her family intends to
move into a smaller home.
   Because of the bankruptcy proceedings, the Hunts were forced to
turn over holdings valued at more than $220 million. Hunt also had
to give up his annual salary of $300,000 and income from widespread
holdings, the Dallas Times Herald said.
   Because Texas law grants homeowners an unlimited exemption for a
homestead in bankruptcy proceedings, the Hunts won't have to give
any proceeds from the sale to creditors.

   A year after a bloody massacre at a California
elementary school, a teacher wounded in that attack called today
for a ban on all assault-style weapons, domestic and foreign.
   ``How many more people, how many more children must face the
power of a bullet before something is done?'' asked teacher Janet
Geng, who was wounded in the Jan. 17, 1989, attack by a man
wielding an AK-47 assault-style rifle in Stockton.
   ``How many more must die? How many more must be disabled before
Congress will act?'' Mrs. Geng asked at a Capitol Hill news
conference called by the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. ``The gun
violence must stop now.''
   Mrs. Geng, still limping from the wound in her leg, said she
would lobby Congress for bills outlawing some domestically produced
assault-style weapons. Her bid to meet with President Bush was
unsuccessful, said coalition Executive Director Michael K. Beard.
   The Bush administration responded to the public outcry following
the Jan. 17, 1989, shootings in Stockton by banning imports of 43
types of semiautomatic assault-style rifles, including the AK-47.
   In the incident, drifter Patrick Purdy opened fire at the school
playground, killing five children and wounding 29 others and Mrs.
Geng.
   The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence says the government must go
further and ban the manufacture and sale of all assault-style
rifles, including domestically produced models unaffected by the
import ban.
   Beard said the coalition also supports a ban on imports of
semiautomatic assault-style pistols, as advocated by Handgun
Control Inc. in a petition today to the Treasury Department's
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   ``The importation of significant numbers of semiautomatic
assault pistols and their increasing use by drug traffickers and
other hardcore criminals is a relatively new phenomenon,'' says the
petition prepared by Handgun Control Inc.'s legislative counsel,
David G. Mengebier.
   ``All of the factors which ATF considered persuasive in banning
the importation of semiautomatic assault rifles are present and
applicable to semiautomatic assault pistols,'' the petition says.
   Handgun Control is concerned about the Israeli Military
Industries Uzi pistol, the Heckler and Koch HK-94 pistol _ smaller
versions of the Uzi carbine and HK rifle that were banned last July
_ and the Australian Automatic Arms SAP pistol, the F.I.E. Spectre
P. pistol and the Sterling Mark 7 pistol.
   Semiautomatic assault pistols are virtually identical to
semiautomatic assault rifles in terms of development, design and
intended use, the petition said. ``In fact, because semiautomatic
assault pistols have similar firepower but are more concealable
than their assault rifle counterparts, they present an even greater
danger to public safety.''
   The ATF and the National Rifle Association said it would be
extremely difficult to ban the handguns because rules enacted under
the Gun Control Act of 1968 were designed to rule out cheap
Saturday Night Specials, not well-made, sophisticated semiautomatic
pistols.
   ``I don't know how one would design criteria that would exclude
the firearms they're talking about and not exclude all the other
firearms,'' said Jim Baker, the NRA's director of governmental
affairs.
   ``I think that Handgun Control would like to ban anything that
there's a political or emotional opportunity to ban, and this is
consistent with that policy,'' Baker said.
   ATF spokesman Jack Killorin said he could not comment on the
Handgun Control petition since he had not seen it.
   All imported weapons must be considered suitable for sporting
purposes. Killorin said that because of the extensive legislative
history and longstanding regulations for handgun imports, it would
be more difficult to ban styles of handguns than to ban the
assault-style rifles, for which there was virtually no legislative
history.
   ``One of the things that drove the issue of the semiautomatic
assault (rifles) were the astonishing numbers that were beginning
to appear for importation,'' he said. ``We may take a look at how
many of these are coming in. These may not be a significant import
item.''
   Mengebier said his organization did not have access to import
figures for 1989 because they are considered proprietary
information. But he said, ``It's safe to say that thousands have
been authorized for importation or are being imported.''
   Added Susan Whitmore of Handgun Control: ``Even one is too many.
These are killing machines.''
   Mengebier said the semiautomatic assault-style pistols represent
a new phenomenon, and that regulations should be changed ``to
satisfy the statutory requirement that firearms have a sporting
purpose.''
   A study by Cox Newspapers last year of almost 43,000 gun trace
requests submitted to the ATF from police departments nationwide
found that the top five guns used by criminals were all handguns
produced in the United States, including the TEC-9 assault-style
weapon. Three handguns made the list of the top 10 assault-style
weapons found in crimes, but all were manufactured domestically _
the Miami-produced TEC-9, and the Atlanta-made Mac-11 and Mac-10,
according to the Cox study.

   Police in the nation's capital said today they
have no idea what has caused a surge in homicides that has left 17
people dead since last Friday.
   The latest victims include a high school athlete, three
teen-agers and an automobile dealer.
   Of the 28 homicides this year, police said, arrests have been
made in five cases.
   The District of Columbia's homicide toll stood at 18 at this
time a year ago and totaled a record 438 for all of 1989.
   ``We keep searching for the answer,'' said Lt. Reginald Smith, a
police spokesman. ``If we had all the answers, we could certainly
bring this under control a lot sooner.''
   At a news conference, Mayor Marion Barry said he planned to meet
with Police Chief Isaac Fulwood to plan new strategies. Barry noted
that the homicide rate last January was the worst month in the
city's history.
   Of the latest surge, four deaths were on Friday and Saturday,
two on Sunday and four on Monday, two on Tuesday and one early
today.
   Homicide detectives have complained about their heavy workload.
   ``We might as well surrender,'' one unidentified detective told
The Washington Post. ``At least that would be taking action.''
   Smith said community involvement is a key element of the police
department's plan to battle the increase in homicides, of which 60
percent are drug-related.
   ``They (community members) have to be a part of our eyes and
ears,'' he said.

   The Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon, an
entertainment fixture here for 17 years, will move to Los Angeles
this year, officials of the Muscular Dystrophy Association said
Wednesday.
   ``It's really a matter of economics,'' Jerry Weinberg, director
of field organization for the MDA, said in a telephone interview
from the association's New York City headquarters. ``We've always
brought most of the talent in from Los Angeles and there was a cost
involved. It was much more cost-effective to move to Los Angeles.''
   In recent years there had been ``less and less talent in Las
Vegas that we could tap into,'' Weinberg said.
   The telethon has raised more than a half-billion dollars during
its Las Vegas run, including a record $42,209,727 in September.
   ``We really feel sort of sad to be leaving Las Vegas,'' said Bob
Ross, MDA executive director and vice president. He said the city
that helped make the telethon a Labor Day entertainment event will
continue to play ``a very important part'' in the show, with some
remote broadcasts planned from Las Vegas.
   Ross said MDA officials met several weeks ago with Lewis, a
longtime Las Vegas resident, ``and he understood the rationale.''
   Lewis, 63, did not immediately return calls made to both his
home and office for comment on the move.
   Mayor Ron Lurie and other city officials were at a city council
meeting and not immediately available for comment, the mayor's
secretary said.
   Frank Sain, executive director of the Las Vegas Convention and
Visitors Authority, said the move came as a surprise but he didn't
think it would hurt the city. ``It gave us the dateline, but it
didn't pull any people into Las Vegas,'' he said.
   The Lewis telethon began in New York City in 1966, emanating
from a single TV station and raising $1 million. It moved to Las
Vegas in 1973 and raised $13.5 million that year.
   The telethon is now carried by 200 stations and is viewed
annually by an estimated 100 million people. The MDA fights 40
neuromuscular diseases that kill and cripple thousands of people
annually, most of them young people.

   A federal judge Wednesday ruled that police
officers may not make drug arrests and search for narcotics by
climbing aboard buses and randomly questioning passengers.
   U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin declared that the
``indiscriminate stopping and questioning'' of people on interstate
buses as part of the nation's war on drugs ``seems to have gone too
far.''
   Sporkin's opinion came in the case of Dennis S. Lewis, a bus
rider arrested in Washington, D.C., and accused of carrying drugs
from New York. The judge said police made an illegal seizure in
their questioning of Lewis and granted the defendant's motion to
suppress as evidence drugs taken in the arrest.
   On Oct. 19 in the bus terminal at Union Station, Lewis denied
carrying narcotics or weapons when he was approached by an officer
of the Metropolitan Police Narcotic Interdiction Unit.
   Lewis consented to a patdown search by the plainclothes
detective, who found a packet of cocaine stuffed in one of Lewis'
socks. Subsequently, marijuana was found in Lewis' jacket pocket
and heroin was found in a bag on the floor at Lewis' seat on the
bus.
   The detective testified at a Dec. 14 hearing that he had no
particular reason for questioning Lewis and that ``sometimes I'll
just walk up to anyone who may be on the bus and ask to talk to
them.''
   ``The specter of passengers riding on a public vehicle of mass
transportation being approached by police officers and searched on
a strictly random and indiscriminate basis really does not square
with the rights protected under the Constitution,'' said the judge.
   Sporkin said a passenger would not feel free to walk away when
approached by police officers in the cramped interior of a bus. A
federal appeals court has upheld searches of baggage that occurred
in the concourse of Union Station where a citizen confronted by
police would not feel constrained from walking away.
   To walk away from this encounter, Lewis, who was waiting for the
bus to continue to Richmond, Va., ``would have had to stand up from
his seat, work his way out of the narrow row in which he was
situated and ... negotiate his way past'' the plainclothes
detective, Sporkin said.
   ``Even in our drug-infested society it is clear that our legal
system demands the existence of some cause before a police officer
will approach a citizen to determine whether that individual may be
engaged in some illicit activity,'' said the judge.

   African National Congress leader Walter
Sisulu on Wednesday urged intensifying the political and military
fight against apartheid even though racial tensions are easing in
South Africa.
   Sisulu told about 1,000 exiled ANC members that they should work
toward negotiations with the South African government, but pursue
their armed struggle to maintain pressure for rapid change of
racial laws and societal structures.
   He called on the ANC's political and military wings and the
international community to ``intensify the struggle against
apartheid, even though there may be an easing of tensions at home.
   ``The political struggle and the armed struggle go side by
side,'' Sisulu said.
   Later Wednesday, Sisulu spoke at the U.S. Information Center at
a ceremony marking the birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
U.S. Ambassador Jeffrey Davidow spoke about King's commitment to
non-violence. ``He understood that violence in the pusuit of
justice provides the proponents of injustice the rational to
continue oppression,'' Davidow said.
   The U.S. government supports the ANC's aim of a non-racial
democracy in South Africa but opposes its use of bombs, sabotage
and military attacks on police and civilians.
   ``In Martin Luther King, we saw a prophet for African
liberation,'' Sisulu said. ``Martin Luther King provided us with a
glorious vision, a sense of self-confidence, the assurance of the
certainty of victory.''
   Sisulu and seven ANC colleagues, all of whom served lengthy
prison terms in South Africa, are on a week-long visit to Lusaka,
the guerrilla movement's exile headquarters. They came to help
co-ordinate ANC strategy in the face of a fast-changing political
climate in South Africa.
   The 60- and 70-year-old men received a rousing welcome from the
ANC members who chanted, sang freedom songs and gave clenched fist
salutes. The hall was draped in the green, black and gold banners
of the ANC and many members wore ANC scarves around their suit
collars.
   Since South African President F.W. de Klerk assumed power in
August, he has allowed opposition groups to protest openly and has
urged negotiations on a new constitution that would include a
political voice for the black majority.
   But de Klerk says the ANC, the main group fighting to undermine
the white government, must commit itself to peaceful solutions and
end its military campaign before participating in negotiations.
   The ANC says the government must lift the state of emergency,
legalize the ANC, and end trials and hangings of guerrillas before
talks begin.
   Sisulu and his colleagues campaign openly for their organization
in South Africa, but the ANC remains outlawed.
   Sisulu praised the ANC and its ally, the South African Communist
Party, for ``taking the initiative'' and setting down conditions
for talks.
   The ANC has an estimated 15,000 members, many of whom are at
guerrilla camps in Tanzania and Uganda. The organization has no
offices or military bases in countries bordering South Africa, but
it has millions of supporters inside the country.
   The ANC meetings occur amid widespraed speculation that the
group's best-known figure, Nelson Mandela, will be freed within
weeks after more than 27 years behind bars. Mandela and the
recently released ANC leaders no longer hold formal titles in the
organization, and leadership is a major issue facing the
organization.
   The current president, Oliver Tambo, 71, is in a Swedish clinic
recovering from a stroke. Sisulu said he intends to visit him
before returning home. The ANC in Tanzania said the leaders were
expected there on Jan. 23.

   An ex-convict suspected in the
slayings of four gay men in two states preyed on pen pals he made
while in prison, police said.
   Keith Eugene Goodman, 30, was arrested with two companions
Sunday while visiting another of Goodman's pen pals, Peter G.
Jones, a Carnegie-Mellon University professor on sabbatical in
Laguna Beach, Police Chief Albert C. Ehlow said Tuesday.
   ``If we had not arrested Goodman, I do believe the man Jones
would have been the next victim,'' said Sgt. Richard E. Downing.
   Goodman, Jon Christopher Mead, 22, and Tracy Holland, 21, all of
Anderson, Ind., were arrested Sunday for investigation of the
killings of a New York man and three Mississippi men, Ehlow said.
   ``The victims all were gay. The suspects allegedly would
befriend the victims before they were murdered and robbed,'' the
police chief said.
   Jones was among an estimated 20 to 25 pen pals Goodman had while
serving time in an Indiana prison for burglary and sexual assault
on an 80-year-old woman, authorities said.
   ``It's very frightening,'' Jones said in an interview. ``I see
myself as very lucky because the police told me I was the next
victim.''
   The New York victim and one Mississippi victim were pen pals,
Ehlow said.
   ``It's a con's con game,'' Ehlow said. ``They write to people to
tell them how bad off they are, asking for money to help them
through, get a better defense lawyer, that sort of thing. And
people send them money and befriend them.''
   Authorities say Goodman and Mead left for New York on Dec. 16 to
meet Harold D. Williams of Windsor, N.Y., one of Goodman's pen
pals. Williams, 60, was found shot to death Dec. 21 in an upstairs
bedroom of his house.
   ``They probably intended to hit him up for money and rob him.
They ended up killing him,'' said Ehlow.
   In Fulton, Miss., R.C. Vaughn, 47; Tommy Mayhall, 37, and
Richard Thomas, 30, were shot to death Jan. 6 or 7. One victim was
Vaughn's roommate and another apparently was a potential witness to
the slayings of the first two, authorities said.
   San Clemente police arrested the three on a tip from New York
authorities.

<HEAD>Stronger Sanctions May Be Needed, Lawmakers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Changes in South Africa's white-dominated
society have been largely cosmetic and the United States should
prepare to impose tougher sanctions, three members of Congress said
Wednesday.
   Pronouncing themselves disappointed after a six-day trip to
South Africa that included a meeting with President F.W.de Klerk,
the lawmakers said all the significant components of the apartheid
system of racial inequality remained in place.
   ``The government seems to be clinging to the fantasy that
somehow conflict in South Africa can be reduced and the pressures
from without will be eased while the white minority continues to
hold to power and privilege,'' said Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich.,
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa.
   Unless far-reaching reforms are made soon, ``there will be a
growing movement in the Congress and internationally to intensify
sanctions,'' said Rep. Alan Wheat, D-Mo.
   The Africa subcommittee will begin hearings next month on
proposals to further restrict U.S.-South African economic ties,
Wolpe said. Congress in 1986 barred the importation of South
African coal, steel and agricultural products, imposed banking
restrictions and cut direct air links between the two countries.
   Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., has introduced a bill that would
prohibitvirtually any commercial links with South Africa. A version
of the bill cleared the House in 1988 but died in the Senate,
lacking the support of Republicans who had backed the 1986
sanctions.
   Another House bill would impose credit restrictions.
   The Bush administration has spoken against tightening sanctions
as long as de Klerk, who assumed power in August, appears to be
moving toward reform. But Wolpe said he was encouraged by the
attitude of administration officials who had agreed to discuss the
matter.
   ``We've been speaking much more with one voice'' than during the
Reagan administration, which had an ideological aversion to
sanctions, Wolpe said.
   There have been improvements since de Klerk assumed power in
August, said Wolpe, Wheat and Rep. Constance Morella, R-Md., who
were in South Africa Jan. 4-9. Some political prisoners have been
freed and the government is allowing opposition rallies, they said
in a joint statement.
   But hundreds of political prisoners remain in jail, some under
death sentences, and politically motivated trials continue, they
said. Likewise, purported relaxation of speech restrictions have
been offset by harassment of opposition voices in the media, they
said.
   For that reason, even the expected release of jailed African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela would be little more than a
``public relations gimmick'' without genuine reforms, Wheat said.
   There is ``an enormous gap between some of the highly publicized
initiatives taken and the much broader reality that is still in
place,'' Wolpe said.
   He said discussions with leaders of a cross-section of South
African society, including government and opposition figures, led
the Americans to believe forms of persecution were getting worse.
   There have been recent reports of political assassinations by
death squads ``that appear to be operating under the direction and
sanction of police and government authorities,'' Wolpe said.
   De Klerk has said he wants to negotiate a new constitution that
would bring blacks into the national government within five years.
However, he opposes black majority rule and envisions a mechanism
that would give whites veto power on major policy decisions.

<HEAD>European Community Urged to Boost Aid To Eastern Europe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The 12 nations in the European
Community must greatly boost financial and economic aid to the
newly emerging democracies in Eastern Europe, the president of the
EC Commission said Wednesday.
   In a proposal one official termed ``very ambitious,'' commission
President Jacques Delors suggested the trading bloc provide an
extra $22.8 billion annually for five to 10 years to East European
countries.
   That is what the community pays annually to improve conditions
in its own poorest regions, he said.
   By comparison, the EC has so far given less than $3.6 billion to
Hungary and Poland, with some of these funds to be spread across
three years.
   Addressing the European Parliament, Delors said he will make
firm aid proposals for Eastern Europe later this year and the
figures he mentioned here were widely seen as indicating the scope
of those proposals.
   Delors said the EC states must renegotiate the community's
funding rules. They did this in February 1988, when EC spending on
regional development was raised and spending on runaway farm
subsidies was curtailed. ``Another `February 1988' _ equally
significant, equally historic _ is needed to demonstrate our
solidarity with Eastern Europe,'' Delors said.
   The EC's 1990 budget totals $56 billion, up 4.7 percent from
1989.
   Under current spending rules, the EC budget has $4.8 billion in
uncommitted funds which could be used for aid to Eastern Europe.
   Delors' plea that the EC nations make available almost $23
billion a year for Hungary, Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia and Romania was received with disbelief by some
officials.
   ``It is very ambitious,'' said a British source who asked not to
be named. ``He asks for a lot probably hoping he will end up with
half of that.''
   A Dutch source called the proposal a ``trial balloon.''
   The trade and economic cooperation accords that have recently
been signed with the six Eastern European nations, or are now being
negotiated, ``are unlikely to meet our requirements and their
individual needs,'' Delors said.
   Also, he said, more money must be forthcoming over a five- to
10-year period if the EC aid is to be effective given the backward
nature of the East European economies.
   Delors, in a speech outlining the work program of the EC
executive Commission, also said the EC nations must forge ahead
with plans for political and monetary union for the sake of
stability across Europe.
   The community can ``only meet its destiny if the structures, the
decision-making methods and the democratic control of European
unity are thought about at the highest levels of political debate
before the end of this year.''
   Delors said the community had helped to inspire the millions in
Central and Eastern Europe who had revolted against their Communist
regimes in recent months.
   ``Let us not forget that it was our prosperity, our freedom, our
community governed by the rule of law ... that served as a pole of
attraction.''
   Delors said the Community must reach its goal of economic and
monetary union by the end of 1992, before accepting new members. He
made an exception for East Germany.
   ``I must repeat clearly today,'' he said, ``that (East Germany)
has its place in the Community, if it asks for it.''
   He said East Germany could join if the decision to do so was
taken ``through free self-determination, peacefully and
democratically, respecting the principles of the Helsinki Final
Act, in the context of an East-West dialogue and in the perspective
of European integration.''

   An American Airlines flight from Dallas to Boston
hit unexpected turbulence Wednesday, injuring three flight
attendants, authorities said.
   Nancy John, a flight attendant based in Dallas, suffered neck
injuries during turbulence on Flight 928, said American spokesman
Ed Stewart. The other two women, who were not identified, suffered
minor injuries, Stewart said.
   The 767 jetliner, carrying 85 passengers and eight crewmembers,
left the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at 7:53 a.m.
   Stewart said the plane hit ``clear air turbulence'' over
Texarkana, Ark. That kind of turbulence, he said, does not show up
on radar screens and can affect a plane unexpectedly.
   The plane landed at Logan Airport without incident, and the
incident was not considered an emergency by airline officials,
Stewart said.

   Unseasonably high temperatures and dry soil
conditions in much of nation are adding to worries about the 1990
winter wheat crop, the government's Joint Agricultural Weather
Facility reported Wednesday.
   The facility, an operation of the Commerce and Agriculture
departments, reported on crop and weather conditions for the week
of Jan. 8-14.
   ``Snow cover on winter wheat fields was scarce across the Great
Plains and Corn Belt, continuing grower concerns over potential
freeze damage,'' the report said. ``Warmer-than-normal temperatures
during the week in most winter wheat states created concerns of
wheat breaking dormancy too early, making (the crop) vulnerable to
a freeze.''
   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and normally is dormant
during midwinter cold before starting to grow again when warmer
weather returns. The crop is harvested in the summer.
   Little or no precipitation was reported in winter wheat areas
during the week, except in the Pacific Northwest where a strong
storm system packing high winds and heavy precipitation caused
flooding in some areas.
   ``Virtually all winter wheat states are anxious for
precipitation to help replenish short subsoil moisture supplies,''
the report said.

<TEXT>
   Edward Strong, chancellor of the
University of California at Berkeley during the early 1960s, has
died. He was 88.
   Strong, who died at home Saturday after a long fight with
cancer, was chancellor from 1961 to 1965. The period marked some of
the university's most rapid growth and the birth of the Free Speech
Movement.
   Strong, whose special interests were the philosophy of history,
medieval thought and contemporary tendencies in philosophy, was
Mills Professor of Philosophy at Berkeley.
   He also was chairman of the Department of sociology and social
institutions, and was an associate dean of the College of Letters
and Science from 1947 to 1955.
   Strong helped found the Journal of the History of Philosophy and
was president of the American Philosophical Association in 1952.
   Shortly after retiring as chancellor in 1965, Strong said of
rebellious students: ``They want the sanctuary of the university to
stage political action, but to be exempt from having to answer to
the university for accompanying or resulting offenses committed on
or off the campus. They want to have it both ways.''
   He is survived by his wife, Gertrude; a daughter; two sons; 10
grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. No formal services are
planned.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's former Communist Party chief,
Egon Krenz, said Wednesday he misjudged dissidents in the past, but
he denied being responsible for the brutal suppression of fall
pro-democracy protests.
   Krenz appeared before an investigating commission of the East
Berlin city government that is looking into police brutality during
Oct. 7-8 street protests.
   The protests, coinciding with the visit of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, provided a turning point in the pro-democracy
movement that led to the ouster of hard-line leader Erich Honecker
10 days later.
   Krenz said he accepted ``joint responsibility for misjudging
dissident citizens and dissident groups for years.''
   ``From today's viewpoint, it is incomprehensible that there was
no general Politburo discussion about the negative developments
then taking place in society,'' said Krenz, an influential
Politburo member even before Honecker's fall. Krenz succeeded
Honecker and himself was ousted six weeks later.
   Krenz added that he and other Politburo members at the time
failed to realize that the Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches
were ``not working against but rather for the German Democratic
Republic.''
   Krenz, who was in charge of many police functions at the time of
the October protests, criticized the attacks by club-swinging
officers.
   ``The excessive action of law enforcement authorities was
neither politically nor morally justifiable,'' he told the panel,
but he said he was not personally responsible for orders to attack
protesters.
   Another ousted Politburo member told the commission Honecker
himself ordered the attacks.
   ``Honecker took things into his own hands,'' Guenter Schabowski
said. Like Krenz, Schabowski denied personal responsibility for the
orders to attack the demonstrators, most of them young people.
   The panel members are investigating the possibility of filing
criminal charges against the ousted leaders.
   Communist Premier Hans Modrow is struggling to hold together the
coalition government formed to govern the nation until elections
May 6.
   The Christian Democrats, one of the non-Communist parties in the
coalition, threatened Wednesday to pull out to protest the
Communists' continued tight grip on power.
   Party spokesman Lothar Lueck said the party leadership was
showing ``a very strong tendency to leave the government.'' The
party holds three of the 27 Cabinet seats.
   Leaders of the same party threatened to pull out of the
coalition last week over Modrow's plans to create a new internal
security agency. Modrow dropped plans for the security agency in
the face of widespread opposition.
   A protest outside the East Berlin headquarters of the
Honecker-era security agency, which is being dismantled, turned
into a rampage Monday night.
   The Communist Party daily Neues Deutschland on Wednesday blamed
the opposition group New Forum for the rampage and said the popular
revolution had taken a dangerous turn.
   New Forum denied responsibility for the rampage, although it
said the fliers it distributed in advance of the demonstration
called on people to bring stones.
   ``The stones that were to be taken along were meant only to
symbolically seal up the doors of the building,'' said New Forum
spokesman Rainer Rodenwald.
   ``The fliers we sent out clearly said `no violence,''' he said.
``There is no one from New Forum who wanted or planned the
violence.''

<TEXT>
   While a House panel investigates in private,
Rep. Barney Frank has been working to show his public career can
survive the scandal surrounding his relationship with a male
prostitute.
   The five-term Massachusetts Democrat has regained visibility as
one of the House's better-known liberals. And, with no well-known
challengers set to run against him, Frank supporters have been
raising funds at a healthy clip for his campaign and legal defense.
   ``Barney Frank has weathered the storm,'' said Larry Rasky, a
Democratic consultant in Boston. ``The whole incident has almost
become a non-issue.''
   But the private work of the House ethics committee into his case
continues, with no indication yet what the panel's next move might
be.
   And Massachusetts Republican Executive Secretary Alexander
Tennant said Frank's ``credibility has been irreparably damaged,''
though Tennant concedes the GOP has had a hard time coming up with
a strong opponent for Frank if he decides to run for re-election.
   In Washington, legal activist John F. Banzhaf III, with the
financial backing of the Conservative Caucus, filed a lawsuit
Tuesday seeking to force Frank into court for allegedly tolerating
a prostitution operation that Stephen Gobie contends he ran out of
Frank's Capitol Hill apartment.
   Late Tuesday, D.C. Superior Court Judge Harold L. Cushenberry
dismissed the request for an injunction.
   Frank admits he paid Gobie $80 in 1985 for sexual relations and
later hired Gobie with personal funds as a housekeeper and driver.
But he says he dismissed Gobie in August 1987 when he learned Gobie
was using his apartment for prostitution.
   Gobie told his story to the ethics committee for more than four
hours behind closed doors on Dec. 5. Borrowing a line from
Shakespeare's ``Julius Caesar,'' he told reporters afterward, ``I
came to praise Congressman Frank today, not to bury him.''
   Frank hinted strongly in a recent interview that he has
testified before the ethics committee.
   Meanwhile, Frank is leading a Democratic move to cut defense
spending and shift the funds into deficit reduction and domestic
programs. Even President Bush singled Frank out at a recent
bill-signing ceremony for his work on housing legislation.
   ``If you're being complimented by the president you must be
doing something right,'' said Rep. Joseph Moakley, D-Mass.
   With few exceptions, Frank has not commented at length on Gobie
since the scandal broke last summer.
   ``I won't discuss it,'' he said recently when asked about the
case. ``I'm not going to contribute to a non-story.''
   Penthouse magazine is to publish next month an interview with
Gobie, purchased by the magazine for a reported $50,000.
   ``There's some sense that there's going to be another wave that
will coincide with the Penthouse publication and the results of the
ethics hearing,'' said Rasky, the Bay State political consultant.
``But at this point, unless there's something startlingly new
revealed, and I don't see any reason to expect that there will,
it's just going to be treated more as the final act of last
season's play.''

   North Korea on Wednesday demanded the
United States and South Korea call off their annual joint military
exercises, saying the war games pose a nuclear threat to the
divided peninsula.
   During a meeting of the Military Armistice Commission in this
truce village, chief North Korean delegate Choe Ui Ung also urged
South Korea to remove an alleged concrete border wall to ensure
free travel between the nations.
   U.S. Rear Adm. Larry G. Vogt refused to discuss the demand for
an end to the annual ``Team Spirit'' exercises, saying the matter
was ``outside the purview'' of the commission. He told North Korea
to take the issue up directly with Seoul.
   As in the past, Vogt invited Choe to visit South Korea and
observe the ``defensive'' nature of the exercises, set for March.
He also asked North Korea to reciprocate by inviting U.S. and South
Korean officials to its exercises.
   Choe did not respond. Pyongyang has rejected all such
invitations in the past, and last year it protested the military
exercises by suspending talks between lawmakers from both nations
that were aimed at improving relations.
   North Korea traditionally has opposed the exercises as a sign
that South Korea and the United States are preparing to attack.
This year, however, it said it was concerned about a nuclear threat.
   The 43,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea under a mutual
defense treaty are believed to have nuclear forces but Washington
has refused to confirm or deny this.
   North Korean President Kim Il Sung first raised the issue of a
concrete border wall in his New Year's speech and called for talks
with South Korean political leaders on demolishing it.
   Kim claimed his nation had not built such barriers on its side
of the Demilitarized Zone and was ready to remove ``barbed wires
which mark a boundary.''
   Vogt, speaking for the U.N. Command based in Seoul, denied the
existence of a concrete wall on the southern side of the
Demilitarized Zone and urged Choe to go with him to the site to
verify this.
   Under the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War, the
Demilitarized Zone is not supposed to be fortified by either
nation, and only a limited number of lightly armed troops are
authorized to police it.
   Outside the 2{-mile zone, however, the border area on both sides
is sealed and heavily fortified by fences, concrete bunkers, mine
fields and hundreds of thousands of heavily armed troops.
   Vogt displayed pictures that he said showed North Korean
bunkers, barbed wire fences and other barriers in the Demilitarized
Zone on the northern side.
   He proposed joint investigations, but Choe again did not respond.
   South Korea has welcomed Kim's call for talks on ensuring free
travel across the border.
   But Seoul has accused North Korea of making a false claim
regarding a concrete wall to mislead world opinion, perhaps to try
to head off pressure on the authoritarian nation to carry out
democratic reforms similar to those that have swept Eastern Europe.

<TEXT>
   Political instability in East Germany combined
with talk of a reunified Germany are potentially dangerous
situations that threaten a new European order, a foreign policy
expert said Wednesday.
   Former Amb. George F. Kennan, 86, told the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee it would be foolish to reunify Germany until
the Soviet Union, the United States and Germany's neighbors agree
on a new framework.
   ``The security arrangements existing today in much of Europe ...
the presence of foreign military forces on the territories of both
parts of Germany, the existence of powerful indigenous German
forces in both parts of Germany ... are totally incompatible with
an immediate reunification.''
   Kennan, a professor emeritus at the Institute for Advanced
Studies at Princeton, N.J., said developments in East Germany
should not been allowed to serve as a catalyst for a hasty
reunification.
   East Germany is a ``very, very delicate, dicey and dangerous
situation,'' said Kennan, saying that in a few more days the
situation could disintegrate to the point there is no central
government.
   ``It's hard to talk to crowds on the street,'' he said.
   Opposition has been mounting to East Germany's Communist-led
transition government, which has scheduled elections on May 6. This
week, the police said opposition figures were involved in the
ransacking of the state security headquarters on Monday.
   Kennan said East Germany's political crisis and the ensuing talk
of reunifying Germany ``present the greatest potential danagers.''
   As a first step, Kennan suggested the four powers that govern
Berlin _ the United States, France, Britain and the Soviet Union _
establish a unified government.
   That entity would not jeopardize any future reunification and a
timetable could be worked out for combining the two Germanys, he
said.
   More generally, Kennan said the situation in all the Eastern
European countries is ``unstable and not without dangerous
aspects.''
   Those countries now governed by reform Communists face economic
problems and upcoming elections. It will be ``at least a year or
two before the emerging democratic establishments can be smoothly
functioning.''
   As for Soviet leader Mikhael Gorbachev, Kennan said the United
States could help him survive recent upheaval in his country by
removing trade impediments and proposing further reductions in
conventional arms in Europe.
   Kennan, an architect of the Cold War ``containment'' theory in
the 1940s, has long advocated that the superpowers withdraw their
troops from Europe. In 1981, he was criticized by hard-line
conservatives for suggesting both countries cut their nuclear
arsenals by 50 percent.
   But that position basically was endorsed by Gorbachev and
President Bush at their Malta summit in December.

   Elementary school teacher Janet Geng, wounded
a year ago when a drifter opened fire at her California school,
said Wednesday ``The emotional trauma is still with us. Many of us
walk in fear.''
   She remembers the smallest details of Jan. 17, 1989, when
Patrick Purdy fired more than 100 rounds from a semiautomatic
assault-style AK-47 rifle in the schoolyard of Cleveland Elementary
in Stockon, Calif.
   Purdy, 24, killed five children and wounded 29 others as well as
Mrs. Geng in less than two minutes before he killed himself.
   ``My wounded leg rested on my good one,'' she told a Capitol
Hill news conference. ``The pressure of the wound was tremendous. I
tried to get hold of the blacktop to pull myself, but I couldn't
move either leg. I tried to look out on the playground, but all I
saw was the sparks and the popping of the gravel coming closer. I
was going to die.''
   She spent 31 days in the hospital and underwent four operations
in an effort to fix what was called a ``grapefruit'' size hole in
her left leg.
   At the time, she wasn't involved in the gun control movement.
Today, she is a committed member, appearing at a news conference
called by the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and lobbying Congress
to approve pending legislation that would ban the sale and
manufacture of certain domestically produced, assault-style weapons.
   ``We're not talking about just a simple little gun anymore
that's out there,'' she said. ``We're talking about ... a war
weapon.''
   Last July, in part as a response to the outcry over the Stockton
shootings, the Bush administration banned the imports of 43 types
of semiautomatic assault-style weapons, including the AK-47.
   That action was taken by the Treasury Department's Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which has control over firearms
imports and requires that the weapons be suitable for sporting uses.
   The coalition wants President Bush to call for legislation that
would limit or ban production or sale of similar domestically
produced weapons. Coalition members argue that without a clear sign
from the president that he will sign such a bill, Congress won't
act.
   Meanwhile, Handgun Control Inc. petitioned the government
Wednesday to prohibit imports of semiautomatic assault-style
pistols, including the Uzi and HK-94 handguns, which are similar to
the rifle-size Uzi and HK-94 weapons banned last July.
   Asked Wednesday about White House reaction to the petition,
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We don't have any reaction.
We'll be guided by ATF.''
   A study by Cox Newspapers last year of almost 43,000 gun trace
requests submitted to the ATF from police departments nationwide
found that the top five guns used by criminals were all handguns
produced in the United States, including the TEC-9 assault-style
weapon.
   Three handguns made the list of the top 10 assault-style weapons
found in crimes, but all were manufactured domestically: the
Miami-produced TEC-9, and the Atlanta-made Mac-11 and Mac-10,
according to the Cox study.
   ATF spokesman Jack Killorin said Tuesday that it would be much
more difficult to ban pistol imports than it was to ban the rifle
imports because there have been two decades of regulations and
legislative history covering what handguns may be imported.
   The rifles, he said, reflected relatively new technology not
covered by the rules developed since the Gun Control Act of 1968.
   Jim Baker, the NRA's director of governmental affairs, said, ``I
don't know how one would design criteria that would exclude the
firearms they're talking about and not exclude all the other
firearms.''
   But the Handgun Control petition said ``All of the factors which
ATF considered persuasive in banning the importation of
semiautomatic assault rifles are present and applicable to
semiautomatic assault pistols.''
   Mrs. Geng had wanted to present Bush a petition signed by 59
staff members from Cleveland Elementary asking for federal
legislation that would match California measures banning sales of
assault-style weapons.
   But White House aides said Bush did not have time to meet her,
according to coalition spokesman Jeffrey Muchnick.
   The White House press office did not immediately respond to a
request for comment Wednesday.
   Elsewhere, the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence at a news
conference unveiled eight public service TV advertisements to
enhance awareness of handgun safety and to keep the weapons away
from children.
   Dewey Stokes, national president of the Fraternal Order of
Police, urged all gun owners to purchase a box with a combination
lock for their weapons at home: ``This is where all guns belong, in
a locked box.''
   The commercials feature Stokes; Lyle W. Swenson, president,
National Sheriffs' Association; Charles Gruber, president,
International Association of Chiefs of Police; Kathy Burke,
president, International Association of Women Police; Robert
Scully, president, National Association of Police Organizations;
Sylvester Daughtry, National Organization of Black Law Enforcement
Executives; Rick Darling, chairman, National Troopers' Coalition;
and Mack Vines, president, Police Executive Research Forum.

<HEAD>Miniature Generator Sharply Cuts Heart Attack Death Rate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tiny generator placed in the body to
deliver life-saving electrical shocks to the heart has dramatically
cut the death rate in people with heart rhythm disorders, a study
shows.
   Patients who have been given the device faced a 25 percent
chance of dying each year without it, and practically none would
have survived five years.
   With the device, 94 percent survive five years and 85 percent
survive 10 years, said Dr. Levi Watkins Jr. of Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore.
   Each year, 600,000 Americans die suddenly from heart attacks
that trigger abnormal heart rhythms, the American Heart Association
says.
   About 50,000 to 100,000 Americans each year could benefit from
the device, Watkins said. They are patients who have already
survived one cardiac arrest or have been diagnosed with severe
heart rhythm disorders. Additionally, their disorders have been
shown not to respond to drug treatment, Watkins said.
   He spoke Wednesday at the American Heart Association's annual
science writers' forum.
   The device, which is inserted under the skin of the abdomen, is
connected to the heart by means of two flexible electrodes.
   It monitors the heart's rhythm continually. When it detects an
abnormality it quickly delivers a shock powerful enough to restore
normal heart rhythm, Watkins said.
   The device is a miniaturized equivalent of the large generator
or defibrillator with two paddle-like electrodes that is used in
hospitals to correct abnormal rhythms. The small version is called
an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator.
   It differs from a pacemaker in that it operates only when it
detects an abnormality. A pacemaker delivers a steady stream of
pulses to the heart to cause it to beat. And a pacemaker cannot
correct the kinds of rhythm disorders that lead to sudden death.
   The implantable defibrillator has been put into more than 7,000
patients worldwide ``with remarkable results,'' Watkins said.
   The Hopkins team has used the defibrillator, which is approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in more than 310
patients, mostly men, Watkins said. About 4 percent of the patients
died during the surgery to implant the defibrillator, he said.
   ``The 85 percent 10-year survival free of sudden cardiac death
must be regarded as the most significant advance in the treatment
of malignant cardiac arrhythmias in this decade,'' Watkins wrote in
a paper describing the research.
   The defibrillator costs $15,000 and its implantation requires an
additional $15,000 to $20,000 worth of hospital care. But it may be
cheaper than the costs of the long-term hospital care needed to
find suitable drug treatments for the patients, said Dr. Myron
Weisfeldt, president of the American Heart Association.
   Improvements in the device _ coupled with growing doubts about
the effectiveness of some anti-arrhythmia drugs _ should lead to
much greater use of the device in the near future, Weisfeldt said.

<HEAD>Striking Miners See Light at Tunnel's End</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Striking coal miner Kenny Wallace says he's
worked underground long enough to know when you see the light at
the end of the tunnel, and it always takes longer to get out than
you think.
   While the United Mine Workers on strike against Pittston Coal
Group are frustrated by a delay in getting to vote on a contract,
Wallace said Wednesday they're confident the settlement negotiated
two weeks ago by union leaders will bring an end to the labor
dispute.
   ``It's just like being down in a mine,'' said Wallace, a
38-year-old electrician from Haysi. ``You see the light and it
takes time to get there. It just takes time.''
   When UMW and company negotiators worked out the tentative
settlement, they agreed to try to dissolve hundreds of legal
actions that arose during the two years the miners have been
without a contract, including $65 million in fines against the
union for illegal strike activities.
   The mountain of litigation is proving harder to dig through than
union officials originally envisioned. UMW President Richard
Trumka, badgered by reporters to make an estimate on New Year's
Day, said the contract might be sent down to the miners in eight to
10 days.
   Now, no union official will estimate when the vote will take
place and won't even talk about a timetable on the record. ``It's
not that we want to keep people in the dark; we're just not ready
to ballpark it,'' one union representative said.
   Copies of the contract haven't even been printed yet. Attorneys
for the union and company were still ``tying up loose ends''
Wednesday, the representative said. Hearings before the judges who
levied the fines have not been scheduled.
   Trumka sent a letter last week to each of the 1,700 striking
miners in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky explaining the
delay, praising them for forcing Pittston to make concessions they
sought and urging them to remain patient.
   While the terms of the contract remain a secret, industry
analysts with second-hand knowledge of it have said the union won
on their two key issues: better health and retirement benefits and
improved job security.
   ``I don't think Mr. Trumka will send down a contract we can't
live with,'' Wallace said.
   But the delay is starting to frustrate some of the miners, such
as Clifford ``Redbone'' Steffey of St. Paul, who is known for his
good humor and flatfoot dancing to bluegrass music.
   ``I makes it hard after we struggled this hard to get a contract
and it just lingers on; I'd like to get back to work,'' Steffey
said at a rally Tuesday at the union's Camp Solidarity in Russell
County. ``It's aggravating knowing you've got a contract and can't
see it.''

   A delegation of coal miners met with the
finance minister Wednesday to discuss the demands of more than
6,000 striking miners, the PAP news agency said.
   The strike began Tuesday at five mines in southern Poland and is
the most significant labor protest since Jan. 1, when a radical
reform plan took effect to create a market-oriented economy and
check inflation.
   Since then, prices have gone up dramatically and the miners are
demanding higher pay.
   Tomasz Gorski, a spokesman for the Solidarity trade union in the
Katowice region, said a delegation of miners met with Finance
Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, but neither Gorski nor a spokesman for
Balcerowicz could provide details.
   About 6,000 workers were on strike at the Czerwone Zaglebie mine
and another 40 at the Niwka Modrzejow mine, both in the city of
Sosnowiec just outside Katowice, a major industrial center 185
miles south of Warsaw.
   Workers returned to work at Kazimierz Juliusz, another mine near
Katowice, PAP said.
   Strikes also continued at three small mines in Walbrzych, a city
12 miles from the border with Czechoslovakia, the news agency
reported.
   The pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza had reported
Wednesday that workers at two of the mines had suspended their
strikes. Telephone calls to the Walbrzych area could not be put
through.
   The miners at Czerwone Zaglebie were demanding a $26 supplement
to their wages for December.
   The 130 workers on strike at the Thorez mine in Walbrzych were
demanding higher pay, and Polish TV earlier reported that the
demands were similar at the other two mines in the city.
   The workers also are demanding a reduction in mine office
employees and assurances that the strikers will not face
retaliation.
   The economic reforms being carried out include a tight wage
policy as part of the attack on inflation. Prices are soaring,
however, because they are no longer controlled by the government or
kept artificially low by budget subsidies.
   Top Finance Ministry officials say it will take at least six
months for prices to stabilize, and that the interim period will be
difficult for workers.
   None of the mines involved in the current strike participated in
the August 1988 walkouts that led to the widespread labor unrest
that forced the Communist authorities who ruled at the time to
start talks on political reform.
   The talks led to the legalization of Solidarity last year and to
partially free elections in June.
   Solidarity's sweeping victory in those elections paved the wave
for the election of Solidarity editor Tadeusz Mazowiecki as the
first non-Communist head of government in 40 years.

<HEAD>Profit-Sharing Boosts Productivity, Study Suggests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Profit-sharing plans, coupled with giving
workers a say in day-to-day decision-making, can boost productivity
at little or no cost to businesses, a study suggests.
   ``You can get productivity on the cheap, if it works,'' said
Alan Blinder, an economist at Princeton University and editor of
``Paying for Productivity.''
   The book is a collection of studies examining ways to boost U.S.
productivity, considered by many to be a crucial issue facing the
country as it struggles to compete with Japan and other rising
economic powers.
   Allowing workers to participate in decisions and rewarding their
efficiency with part of the profits can boost productivity at
little, if any, cost to the employer, Blinder said. Other methods
of boosting productivity, such as improving education and capital
investments, use many resources, he noted.
   The studies, published this month by the Brookings Institution,
a generally liberal think tank, explore whether flexible pay,
employee stock ownership, profit-sharing and incentive bonuses make
workers more productive by linking pay to performance.
   Evidence offered by the economists suggests that extra pay is
likely to be most effective when businesses also encourage employee
participation in the day-to-day decisions of the workplace.
   ``Putting the two together as a package in the workplace creates
a good environment where workers have incentive and the inclination
to do things that are good for the company,'' Blinder said.
   Between 15 percent and 20 percent of American firms have some
sort of profit-sharing plans for their employees, he said.
   Productivity, or the amount produced by each worker for every
hour he or she is on the job, increased at an annual rate of nearly
3 percent between 1947 and 1973, but since then has averaged a gain
of only about 1 percent.
   Blinder said management and labor have been reluctant to shift
to allowing more worker participation partly because it upsets
``the strong hierarchical boss-to-worker relationship.''
   ``There's an atmosphere of distrust there ... some workers view
anything as a plot to make them work harder,'' Blinder said.
   Robert Litan, director of Brookings' Center for Economic
Progress and Employment, said labor has been slow to back
profit-sharing plans because ``there's a perception that
profit-sharing is not gravy, that it's coming out of their
paycheck.''
   Masanori Hashimoto, an Ohio State economist, studied Japanese
management techniques that enlist workers in so-called shop floor
decisions. He stopped short of recommending a wholesale import of
those techniques to the United States, citing differences between
the two nations' economies.
   ``Part of the explanation is that in the past, managers felt
threatened by dilution of their power ... but the American industry
seems to be heading in that direction,'' Hashimoto said.
   He noted that some firms have begun experimenting with worker
participation techniques. For instance, at the New United Motor
Manufacturing Inc. or Nummi plant in Fremont, Calif., a joint
venture by General Motors and Toyota, teams of six to eight workers
are responsible for job rotation, balancing work assignments and
equalizing workloads.
   Nummi spokesman Michael Damer said plant officials believe
worker participation is at least partly responsible for a huge drop
in absenteeism. At the old GM plant, 20 percent to 25 percent of
the work force would fail to show on any given day _ now the
absenteeism rate is 4 percent, he said.
   Some workers have balked at the team concept, but Frank Joyce, a
spokesman for the United Auto Workers, said the UAW ``has
traditionally pushed for more worker input.''
   ``Management is too important to be left just to managers,''
Joyce said. At the same time, he said the union has been keenly
interested in who benefits from the fruits of increased
productivity, noting it is not in labor's interest to make jobs so
efficient that certain workers aren't needed anymore.

   A man who went into a rage after
another customer berated a waitress about a cheeseburger served
without lettuce and tomatoes was found guilty Wednesday of
murdering the complaining customer.
   A jury deliberated five hours before finding Ronald J. Longo,
45, of Saratoga Springs guilty of second-degree murder.
   Longo argued he was acting in self defense when he stabbed
William McEntire, 27, of Weatherford, Texas, during an argument
Nov. 5, 1988.
   Witnesses testified they heard Longo threaten McEntire after the
argument at the Spa City Diner counter over McEntire's treatment of
a waitress.
   Longo was ordered out of the restaurant and was lying in wait
for McEntire and allegedly brandished a knife during a fight
outside the diner in Saratoga Springs, according to testimony.
   McEntire was working on a construction project in the upstate
New York community.
   Longo was remanded to the Saratoga County Correctional Facility,
where he has been there since turning himself in after the incident.
   Sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 8.

<HEAD>Rare Trumpeter Swan Sighting in Mississippi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHOCTAW, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A trumpeter swan, a huge bird with a
booming call and wingspan wider than a bald eagle's, has been seen
in Mississippi for the first time since records started being kept
and perhaps for centuries.
   Birdwatchers speculate a harsh winter that froze northern lakes
drove the bird this far south.
   ``The trumpeter swan is not even on our checklist,'' said Nona
Herbert, a member of the Mississippi Ornithological Society.
   The trumpeter, a snow-white black-billed birds that weighs about
25 pounds with a wingspan of 5 to 6 feet, has apparently settled
with smaller tundra swans in a flooded bean field four miles from
Herbert's home in the Choctaw community of Bolivar County.
   Trumpeter swans are among the biggest birds in North America. In
flight they stretch about 4{ feet from the tips of their bills to
the tips of their tails. They normally winter along the Alaskan and
Washington coasts or in the northern Great Basin and can be seen
year-round at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming and Montana.
   Herbert and Don Simon, an Arkansas wildlife expert, identified
the bird as a trumpeter swan Sunday and spread the word to other
birders.
   ``I've been out seeing them every day, taking somebody to see
them every day,'' Herbert said, estimating that at least 100
birders have come to glimpse the trumpeter and tundra swans.
   Marvin Davis of Oxford, president of the state's bird-watching
society, said he had been skeptical of Herbert and Simon's claim
until he saw the bird for himself.
   ``It is all improbable, but that's what makes bird-watching so
exciting. Birds have wings, so they fly where books say they
shouldn't be. Birds haven't read the books,'' Davis said.
   The species has never been sighted since the society's Bird
Records Committee began keeping a formal list in 1962. Davis said
trumpeter swan bones have been found among 500-year-old Indian
artifacts, but it's not even certain that the birds were in
Mississippi even then because the bones could have been traded
among Indians from across large geographic areas.
   ``There's no definite record of live birds being in Mississippi
before now,'' he said. ``As far as I know, this is a first.''
   Davis said he knows of a book that mentions a 19th-century
sighting but he said that sighting was ``questionable.''

<HEAD>Harkin Says Red Tape Eating Up Funds To Fight Swine Pseudorabies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Tom Harkin said Wednesday that too much
of the money meant for eradicating the deadly swine virus
pseudorabies appears lost in ``a black hole'' of administrative
costs.
   Harkin's state, Iowa, is getting only $6,000 more funds to fight
the disease this year, despite the $600,000 overall increase in the
federal program. Some states are actually being cut back.
   ``Where's the black hole?'' the Iowa Democrat said.
   ``It's my intention to work with the inspector general and the
GAO (General Accounting Office) to get some accounting breakouts,''
Harkin told a Senate hearing.
   The 10-year federal program to rid the nation's swine population
of pseudorabies began last January with $3.1 million for 1989. The
amount was increased by $600,000 for fiscal 1990. The program also
calls for state and pork industry contributions.
   Over 20 percent of the Iowa swine herds are infected with
pseudorabies and nearly 47 percent of the nation's infected herds
are located in Iowa, said Harkin.
   Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, who says he represents the leading
pork-producing district in the nation, also has blasted the
Agriculture Department for spending so much on administration
instead of testing, vaccination and other efforts directly related
to getting rid of the virus.
   ``This vital federal program dedicated to eradicating deadly
swine disease has been rendered virtually useless by bureaucratic
red tape,'' Tauke said in a press release Monday.
   Under questioning Wednesday from Harkin, two Agriculture
Department officials admitted a greater percentage of the
appropriated funds was going to administration than Congress
intended.
   But they defended the use as necessary and said there still was
enough money to make progress in the eradication program.
   Lonnie King, deputy administrator at USDA's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service, said that in 1989 other programs within
the agency helped support the administrative costs of running the
pseudorabies program.
   ``Because pseudorabies will pay its fair share of expenses and
because of the consolidation of purchases to save money, some state
allocations will be reduced,'' King said. ``We are confident that
the funds allocated to the states are adequate to further the
progress of the national eradication program.''
   But Harkin wasn't satisfied.
   ``This confirms everyone's worst fears about government,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   The withdrawal of all Soviet
troops from Czechoslovakia by the end of 1990 will be a key issue
when President Vaclav Havel visits Moscow next month, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said Wednesday.
   ``We consider the Soviet pullout to be a key issue in the
relations between our two countries,'' said spokesman Lubos
Dobrovsky.
   Earlier this week, Soviet and Czechoslovak delegations failed to
produce a tangible result in their talks in Prague, despite of a
draft agreement proposed by the Czechoslovak side. The talks ended
Tuesday.
   Dobrovsky said he believed the Soviet delegation ``did not quite
fully comprehend the depth of transformations that took place in
Czechoslovakia.''
   ``The Czechoslovak delegation left no doubt on the Soviet side
that it will seek the withdrawal of Soviet troops with utmost
consistency,'' Dobrovsky said. ``We have reasons to believe that a
solution satisfying both sides will be found as soon as possible.''
   Dobrovsky also confirmed Czechoslovakia would seek a complete
Soviet pullout by the end of 1990 and the withdrawal of ``a
decisive part of Soviet troops'' before scheduled elections in June.
   ``The dates we have proposed were neither accepted nor rejected
by the Soviet side,'' he stated.
   The Soviet Union stationed 75,000 soldiers in Czechoslovakia
after the 1968 Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion crushed the ``Prague
Spring'' liberal reforms of Alexander Dubcek.

   A graduate student was frantic when the
worm program he designed went berserk and he couldn't stop it from
paralyzing a federal nationwide computer network, a friend of his
testified Wednesday.
   Paul Graham, a 25-year-old graduate student at Harvard
University, testified that defendant Robert T. Morris designed the
worm to break into the Internet system, but it wasn't intended to
replicate wildly as it did or cause any damage.
   ``It was just supposed to go from computer to computer to see
how far it could get. Once it got in, it wasn't supposed to do
anything,'' said Graham, a witness for the government in the
federal trial.
   Morris is charged with designing and setting loose the program
that crippled an estimated 6,000 computers linked to Internet in
November 1988.
   If convicted, Morris, 25, of Arnold, Md., a suspended Cornell
University student, faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000
fine.
   Graham, who met Morris when he was an undergraduate at Harvard,
told jurors that Morris deliberately added safeguards to limit the
growth of his program to ensure it would cause no permanent file
damage to the computers it attacked.
   ``He put in a wrong number and instead of just allowing a few
copies every once-in-a-while, it made lots of copies every time,''
said Graham.
   Morris telephoned Graham from Cornell the night of the attack
after realizing his worm was out of control, Graham testified.
   ``He sounded like he had a final the next day that he hadn't
studied for. He sounded miserable. He sounded in a state of shock
and horror,'' Graham told the jury, adding that the usually
``puritanical'' Morris was even using profanities.
   Morris tried to regain access to his computer at Cornell to try
to stop the worm, but his program already had immobilized Cornell's
computers, preventing him from getting back into the system, said
Graham.
   ``We thought maybe we could send out another program that could
eat the worm and stop its processes,'' he said. ``But there was no
way to send something after the virus. It wouldn't get through. It
was pointless.''
   Graham said Morris first told him about designing the worm when
the Cornell student visited Harvard for a weekend in late October
1988.
   Morris, whom Graham said could do anything on a computer, first
mentioned his plan to design a virus to infect Internet after
discovering a software bug, or flaw, in Harvard's UNIX system that
would allow unauthorized entry.
   Graham told the jury that UNIX was widely regarded as an
insecure system.
   Graham said he never told anyone about Morris' worm because the
plan was mentioned to him in confidence and he hadn't realized
Morris was so close to having it finished.
   Graham said he saw nothing wrong about what Morris was doing
because breaking into systems is a common practice of fledgling
computer security students.

<HEAD>Big Thaw Thwarts Winter Activities in Milwaukee</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An extended January thaw featuring spring-like
temperatures has melted the usual snow here, but planning and
technology have kept the city's annual winter festival on ice.
   Organizers of the month-long Big Cool Winterfest were prepared
for an uncooperative forecast, building a refrigeration unit for
the skating rink and stockpiling snow for the collegiate snow
sculpting contest.
   The city, which sponsors the festival, spent $150,000 to ensure
the Olympic-size rink would remain cold after four years of warm
Januarys ruined past festival events, said Winterfest executive
director Elizabeth Black.
   ``With this warm weather, we wouldn't have been able to open the
rink. It would have been a Big Cool pond if we wouldn't have
refrigerated,'' she said.
   Temperatures Wednesday, the 21st straight day Milwaukee exceeded
its seasonal norms, peaked into the low 50s, threatening to break a
century-old temperature record. The thaw is forecast to continue at
least through the weekend.
   Rain has covered most of Wisconsin this week and Milwaukee thus
far has received just 1.8 inches of snow in January, well below the
monthly average of 13 inches.
   Luckily, the festival organizers had taken precautions against
that development, stockpiling snow that fell in December and
storing the piles under tarps and plywood boxes to keep it fresh
for the sculptors.
   The student captain of a 25-member sculpting team from the
Milwaukee School of Engineering said they decided to adjust the
theme of their submission in this weekend's snow sculpting
competition.
   Mark Piszczek, 21, of Glendale Heights, Ill. said the crew of
architectural engineering students plan to create a snowman sitting
in an open refrigerator roasting a marshmallow over an campfire.
   The balmy weather has cut sales for snow removal businesses like
Blizzard Wizzard and Snowbird Plowing Service and shops that sell
skis, snowmobiles and other seasonal equipment.
   Several Wisconsin ski areas have begun to report concerns about
the unseasonal weather. At Crystal Ridge near Milwaukee, a 5-foot
snow base which formed in mid-December has melted to 10 inches in
some areas.
   ``Obviously, it hurts. People don't think about skiing when it's
raining,'' Crystal Ridge manager Daphne Reed said.
   Kay Decker, a Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman in Hurley in
northern Wisconsin, said the continued warmth would hurt the
economies of communities like her own that depend on winter
tourism..
   ``They call us the snow-belt. Our Januarys are usually cold. For
us to have 20 to 30 degrees isn't natural. Thirty degrees is like
spring,'' Ms. Decker said.

<HEAD>FDA Says Some Lens Solution Contains Dangerous Bacteria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration said on
Wednesday that some bottles of Wet Cote contact lens solution
contain a bacteria that could cause serious eye infections.
   The contaminated batch carries the lot number W3028 and the
expiration date 6-91 on the label.
   It was distributed in Texas, Florida, Georgia, Wisconsin,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, Maryland, Tennessee and
Illinois, the FDA said.
   Wet Cote, made by Occumed Inc. in Sarasota, Fla., is a wetting
solution designed for use with hard contact lenses.
   Seven of 20 bottles of Wet Cote from the batch that were
analyzed were found to be contaminated with a bacteria called
Pseudomonas cepecia, which can cause serious eye infections that
are difficult to treat and in rare cases lead to blindness, the FDA
said.
   The manufacturer recalled the product, but only about a third of
the 1,500 bottles produced were recovered, the agency said.
   The FDA advised consumers who have bottles of Wet Cote to check
the label and if the lot number shows it was from the contaminated
batch, not to use it but return the product to the place of
purchase.
   The contaminated liquid looks the same as the safe product, the
FDA noted.

<TEXT>
   When the shuttle Columbia returns to
Earth on Friday, scientists will spend weeks debriefing the
astronauts, but an engineer dubbed Dr. Flush will be interested in
only one thing: How did the toilet work?
   Don Rethke, a mechanical engineer at Hamilton Standard for 27
years, is hard at work refining a space toilet that he says will
solve the delicate problems that have plagued astronauts since the
early days of space exploration: how to cope with zero gravity,
limited storage and, well, the smell when answering nature's call
in space.
   ``We wanted it to be more earthlike,'' Rethke said recently as
he showed off a prototype of his commode during an interview in his
cramped research trailer _ about half the size of the shuttle cabin.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has already
given Rethke's design its preliminary approval, but the five
Columbia crew members will be quizzed when they return and their
reports passed on to Rethke so he and his assistants can further
refine the commode.
   ``It's going to be a pretty user-friendly type system,'' said
Eugene Winkler of NASA's shuttle support team at the Johnson Space
Center in Houston. ``We've put the best minds in the country
together on this new potty, so I think it should work out pretty
well.''
   Hamilton Standard, which has been designing space suits for NASA
since the 1960s, last year won a $35 million contract to design a
toilet that will meet the demands of larger crews and longer
missions.
   Rethke's commode will be installed on the ``extended-duration
orbiter'' shuttle to be launched in March 1992 for 16 days, but is
ultimately headed for the space station Freedom, an orbiting
laboratory where astronauts will live for months at a time later
this decade.
   The aeronautics division of the giant defense contractor United
Technologies Corp., Hamilton Standard lost a fierce competition
with General Electric to design space commodes in the early 1970s,
but got a second chance after GE dropped out of the space-waste
game. The firm last year also won the maintenance contract for the
disposal system now in use.
   Things have come a long way since that day in 1961 when Alan B.
Shepard Jr. wet his space suit as he sat helplessly strapped in his
Freedom 7 capsule atop a Redstone rocket, waiting to become the
first American launched into space.
   During the Gemini and Apollo programs, astronauts urinated into
cups that were just dumped into space; they used stick-on plastic
bags for solid waste they carried back to Earth, Winkler said.
   It was all very messy, smelly and uncomfortable, and ``zero
hygiene for the astronauts who went to the moon,'' Rethke said.
   The shuttles have had improved commodes that resemble portable
toilets, but the accommodations are still pretty Spartan. Capacity
is a problem and the astronauts have to use the same bowl that
can't be flushed, Rethke said.
   Rethke's aim for the space toilet was simple: make it
comfortable and clean.
   His commode looks much like the ordinary toilet, but instead of
water, there are individual collection bags for solid waste. Urine
is funneled into a separate container and will be chemically
treated for ``hygienic use'' _ washing, but not drinking water.
   The commode, in a closet similar to the cramped restrooms on
commercial jetliners, has biodegradable wipes, a rearview mirror to
help astronauts with delicate manuevers and padded bars to hold
them in place.
   A vacuum-like device solves the zero-gravity problem by drawing
the waste downward, also controlling ordor and bacteria.
   Instead of flushing, the astronauts will simply press a button
after they are done. The collection bags are then automatically
sealed, moved along a metal track and dropped into a compacter that
can hold a week's worth of waste from four astronauts, Rethke said.
When full, the 25-inch, fiberglass cannister is stored on board and
replaced with a fresh one.
   Each astronaut inserts a fresh bag for the next user.
   Rethke's devotion to his space toilet has spurred more than a
little ribbing from colleagues and he rarely makes it through the
day without hearing a potty joke.
   He frequently appears at company functions with his ``Dr.
Flush'' kit, including a taped bathroom noises, a white jacket
emblazoned with his ``Dr. Flush'' logo, and a toilet seat featuring
a stained-glass image of the shuttle.
   ``It has a lot of personal satisfaction from the point of view
that you're helping mankind,'' Rethke said. ``And it is extremely
serious for the astronauts. ... We have to make extremely sure it
works right.''

<HEAD>Bush Sends Top Aide to Philippines In Show of U.S. Support</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush sent a senior White House aide
to the Philippines on Wednesday ``to make sure there is no
question'' about U.S. support for President Corazon Aquino amid
fears of a new coup attempt against her.
   Robert Gates, Bush's deputy national security adviser, will be
in the Philippines through Friday, holding talks with Mrs. Aquino
and Fidel Ramos, the Philippine defense secretary.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Gates would
convey Bush's ``continuing strong commitment to democracy'' in the
Philippines.
   Fitzwater said the United States ``very strongly'' supports the
Aquino government and noted that Bush ordered air support to help
put down a failed coup attempt in December.
   ``This trip is to make sure there is no question'' about U.S.
support for Mrs. Aquino, Fitzwater said.
   Referring to reports that another coup may be attempted soon,
Fitzwater said, ``There, of course, are continuing reports of
problems in terms of security forces and so forth. She is taking
measures to deal with those, to prevent future coups. We simply
want to consult with her on those efforts.''
   Fitzwater said he would not speculate whether the United States
would come to her aid again with military support, but added, ``You
know how we have responded in the past.''
   Gates, one-time deputy director of the Central Intelligence
Agency, is the chief deputy to Brent Scowcroft, the president's
national security adviser.
   Fitzwater said Gates has a relationship with many Philippine
leaders and personally knows Ramos.
   During the December coup attempt, Gates was a key figure
orchestrating the U.S. response while Bush was in the air, flying
to Malta for talks with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Fears of a another coup attempt have swept the Philippines in
recent weeks. Most of Manila's newspapers published front-page
editorials last week condemning military coup plotters and stating
support for democracy and peace.
   Mrs. Aquino, in a speech a week ago, said ``armed
power-brokers'' had not abandoned hope of toppling her government
and that another coup attempt would lead to a ``nightmarish
bloodbath.''

<HEAD>U.S. Military Chief Sees Changes in Warsaw Pact, But No Disbanding</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States' top military officer
said Wednesday the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact was undergoing change but
no member has yet suggested pulling out of the alliance.
   ``Clearly there is a transformation taking place in the Warsaw
Pact,'' said Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, after two days of unusual talks with his East bloc
counterparts.
   ``I had no discussions with any member of the pact that
suggested they were considering ... leaving the formal structure of
the Warsaw Pact,'' he told a news conference.
   Gen. Nikolaj Chervov, head of the directorate of the Soviet
general staff, acknowledged earlier that ``there will be changes in
(the alliance's) structure.''
   He disclosed that a key policy-making body of top Communist
Party officials would likely be disbanded.
   The high-ranking military officers were in Vienna for the start
of an unprecedented meeting of 35 nations to discuss East-West
military strategies. The aim is to lift the secrecy surrounding
military activities and ease tensions in Europe.
   Western experts were eager to hear whether any of the emerging
democracies in Eastern Europe was considering leaving the
seven-nation Warsaw Pact.
   East European officers, speaking on the second day of the
meeting, stressed the importance of their national defense
interests, rather than those of their military alliance.
   ``We proceed from the fact that our national interests are
fundamental,'' said Gen. Anton Slimak, chief of Czechoslovakia's
general staff.
   ``The principles of our military doctrine are being adapted to
the newly created realities on the domestic and international
scale,'' he said.
   He said money was tight and that troops and weapons were being
trimmed.
   Starting Feb. 1, he said, ``we shall reduce by one-third the
number of forces and equipment trained to fulfill combat tasks.''
   East Germany's military chief, Gen. Manfred Graetz, said his
nation was drafting a new military policy based on protection
against foreign aggression, according to the East German news
agency ADN.
   Powell said some of the East-bloc governments appeared to be
making ``unilateral judgments' about their armed forces and weapons
production.
   ``Yet, they continue to say they are part of an alliance,'' he
said. ``So I think the Warsaw Pact alliance is shifting in its
character to a more political institution.''
   Those nations, he said, generally were cutting their armed
forces because of economic problems and an assessment of defense
needs.
   The West has long complained about the military might of the
Warsaw Pact.
   The Soviets' top military officer, Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, said
Tuesday the Kremlin was sharply reducing arms, troops and spending
as part of a new military doctrine.
   Chervov, speaking through an interpreter, said the Warsaw Pact's
governing body, the political consultative committee, would likely
be scrapped. The panel is made up of the top Communist Party
officials of the seven nations.
   He said political changes in some of the countries has led to
``the multiplicity of parties.''
   ``The Communist Parties are no longer leading the states,'' he
said. ``Therefore, the political consultative committee will
probably cease to exist of itself and perhaps there will be another
supreme body.''
   The new one, he said, could be made up of the heads of state of
those countries.
   Powell said Moiseyev indicated in private talks that the Soviets
did not intend to use military force to reverse the events in
Eastern Europe.
   Powell also said the changes were contributing to smaller U.S.
defense spending.
   ``There's a general feeling ... we can take more of a chance
(and) that we can cut back on our spending because the world does
seem to be moving in a new and positive direction,'' he said.
   The three-week meeting is part of negotiations on Confidence-and
Security-Building Measures, designed to reduce military tensions in
Europe.

<TEXT>
   A Palestinian died Wednesday of gunshot wounds
from an earlier confrontation with troops, and a police officer was
removed from his job for using unnecessary force in breaking up a
peace rally last month.
   Palestinians staged a general strike in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip to protest what they perceive as anti-Arab U.S.
policies.
   There were scattered stone-throwing clashes in the territories
and troops shot and wounded at least nine Palestinians, Arab
hospital officials said. The army confirmed six wounded.
   Yousef Hatem Shusha, 19, of the West Bank village of Husan died
at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem after being shot in the head and
back during a clash Tuesday night, Arab reports said.
   An army official confirmed the death and said the circumstances
were under investigation.
   The death brought to 648 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israelis during the 25-month Palestinian uprising against the
Israeli occupation.
   Palestinian vigilantes have killed 170 fellow Arabs suspected of
cooperating with Israel. Forty-three Israelis have died as well.
   Israeli Police Commissioner David Krauss ordered an unidentified
officer removed from his post after viewing film of police
dispersing a demonstrators on Dec. 30, police spokesman Uzi Sandori
said.
   ``We saw in the film that the policeman was beating two people,
without any need, with a billy club,'' Krauss said on army radio.
   More than 50 people were injured in the melee. The European
Community and peace activists criticized police for using
``unjustified'' violence during the demonstration.
   At the time, police said officers acted only after outlawed PLO
flags were waved and stones hurled at police.
   ``I can understand that an innocent citizen in this situation
felt very bad. He saw people running about, heard explosions, saw
horses and maybe was sprayed with water and tear gas. ... But after
you see the film you understand that police had to do it,'' Krauss
said.
   Stores were shut and transportation came to a halt throughout
the territories as Palestinians heeded a strike call by the
PLO-backed Unified National Leadership of the Uprising.
   The underground leaders ordered the strike to ``condemn American
policy which is against the rights of our people,'' according to a
leaflet circulated this month.
   The PLO has accepted the United States as a mediator in Middle
East peace efforts, but many Palestinians believe Washington favors
Israel in the conflict.
   In other developments, troops bulldozed a house in Gaza City
because the owner's son was suspected of killing a Palestinian
allegedly collaborating with Israel, the army said.
   The chief of police in northern Israel, Albert Musafia, reported
a 30 percent rise in politically motivated attacks by Israeli Arabs
in 1989 over the previous year. He did not provide figures.
   ``The events in Judea, Samaria and Gaza exercise an influence on
nationalist radicalism among Israeli Arabs that is expressed in
firebomb attacks, painting of slogans and Palestinian flags,'' he
said, using biblical names for the West Bank.
   But Musafia attributed most of the attacks to ``marginal groups
of youths.''

<HEAD>Parliament Extends Emergency by Six Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers on Wednesday extended
Zimbabwe's 25-year-old state of emergency by six months to meet
what they say are military threats from neighboring South Africa
and Mozambique.
   The laws give authorities the power to arrest without warrant,
detain indefinitely without trial and search without authority.
   Parliament approved their renewal by a vote of 73-3. The other
legislators in the 100-member National Assembly where absent.
   Home Affairs Minister Moven Mahachi, arguing for an extension,
cited several reasons for retaining the powers:
   _ An escalation in offensives across Zimbabwe's eastern frontier
by right wing guerrillas of the Mozambique National Resistance in
which 60 Zimbabweans were slain in the last six months;
   _ Reports that young Zimbabweans belonging to opposition
political parties were being trained by the guerrillas to fight
against the government;
   _ Threats by South Africa to attack neighboring states; and
   _ The need to give security forces flexible powers so they can
maintain law and order.
   Mahachi recalled that South African Defense Minister Magnus
Malan recently said South Africa might raid Zimbabwe and other
countries in the region.
   ``I do not regard these threats as hollow,'' he said. ``This has
been proved by past events,'' he added, apparently referring to
sabotage attacks in Zimbabwe by South African soldiers and agents.
   Opponents, including the Catholic Commission for Justice and
Peace, and independent newspapers, contend emergency powers were
unnecessary in a relaxed security climate, and that the laws were
often abused.
   Alexio Mudzingwa told parliament that under the regulations, the
government was committing the same human rights violations as South
Africa, as well as under the former white minority government of
Ian Smith.
   ``Can we have the audacity to condemn South Africa when we are
guilty of the same?'' he asked.
   Mahachi accused the Catholic Commission, a watchdog on human
rights, of being a spokesman for South Africa.
   Commission chairman Mike Auret later said the charge was
``patently absurd.''
   ``The commission is ... concerned by the fact that the state of
emergency created by the Smith government still pertains today in
what should be a free and democratic Zimbabwe,'' Auret said. ``The
powers of the state of emergency have been abused on many
occasions.''
   Smith introduced the emergency in 1965, shortly before he
unilaterally declared the white-ruled British colony of Rhodesia
independent to forestall black majority rule.
   The laws were largely used against black nationalist politicians
and parties which, a decade later, wages a seven year war for
independence.
   When President Robert Mugabe came to power in 1980, he retained
the emergency powers.

Atlanta area, were detained Jan. 5 after they completed a year of
training Chadians to service a Lockheed C-130 transport plane,
company officials said.
   The aircraft, built in Marietta, Ga., near Atlanta, was the
first of several the government of President Hissene Habre bought
for his air force.
   Lockheed spokesman Dick Martin in Atlanta said when the year
ended in December, the men packed up and destroyed some documents,
including manuals on the aircraft. Martin said the Chadian
government felt those documents belonged to it, while Lockheed
maintains the papers were company material.
   Martin said Chad officials then confiscated the technician's
passports pending resolution of the conflict.
   Essentially, the dispute was over a single ``high-level
technical overhaul document,'' said Webb. He said the document was
not needed for the day-to-day maintenance of the aircraft and, in
any case, Lockheed did not have the State Department export permit
for it. This authorization has now been obtained and the Chadians
have been given another copy of the document, he said.
   Webb and another technician, Paul A. Lanegger, were flown to
N'Djamena by Lockheed after the men were detained. The pair had
several high-level meetings with Chadian authorities to resolve the
issue and Webb said they were ``very close.''
   Webb, who is based in Amman, Jordan, stressed that the men were
not held hostage and had not been mistreated or harassed. Two of
them, Thrash and Ruse, were accompanied to Chad by their wives, but
the wives were not detained or mistreated, Webb added.
   The three men, held in a Chadian police compound until Monday,
have since been put under house arrest in N'Djamena's biggest
hotel, La Chadienne, part of the French-owned Novotel chain, Webb
said.
   Thrash's sister, Barbara Porter of Marietta, has called the
incident a ``hostage situation'' and expressed fear for her
brother's safety.
   But Martin said Wednesday that Thrash had not been separated
from the others and the five Americans were well-fed.
   ``They have not missed a meal,'' he said. ``No one is starving
and no one is threatened.''

   A Colombian who prosecutors say ran a network
to help traffickers hide the source of their drug money pleaded
guilty Wednesday to his part in a $32 million global
money-laundering case.
   Gonzalo Mora Jr. was considered a key player in a sophisticated
money-laundering ring that prosecutors say had ties to Panamanian
Gen. Manuel Noriega.
   One of the remaining six defendants in the case is Amjad Awan, a
former official for the Latin American division of the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International, or BCCI. He once told a U.S.
Senate committee that he was a personal banker to Noriega who,
according to court documents, controlled accounts the fallen
Panamanian leader kept at BCCI banks.
   The government accused Mora of helping traffickers hide the
source of their money by funneling cash from smugglers to an
undercover agent posing as a high-stakes launderer.
   Mora switched his plea to guilty on all 33 counts _ one each of
drug trafficking and money-laundering conspiracy, plus 31 charges
of specific laundering activities.
   Defense attorney Joel Rosenthal told U.S. District Judge W.
Terrell Hodges there was no agreement with prosecutors.
   ``There were no deals, no promises, no nothing,'' Rosenthal said
later. He said Mora has never denied laundering activities, but
``he always denied the legal conclusion that there was a
drug-trafficking conspiracy.''
   Rosenthal said the plea came over the objections of prosecutors,
but they had no grounds to fight the plea since it included all the
charges.
   However, Mora's admission to the trafficking count came
reluctantly, Rosenthal said.
   Hodges agreed to allow Mora the opportunity to withdraw the
guilty plea to that count if during trial the court decides there
is insufficent evidence to support it. Hodges also said Mora would
not be sentenced until after the trial ends and appeals are
exhausted.
   The drug-trafficking conspiracy charge carries a possible term
of up to life in prison and $4 million in fines.
   He could face up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on
the money-laundering conspiracy count and 20 years plus a $500,000
on each of the remaining counts.
   His plea came as defense attorneys fought to suppress statements
from remaining defendants after BCCI pleaded guilty to
participating in the money laundering conspiracy.
   In a deal with the government Tuesday, BCCI S.A. and BCCI
Overseas Ltd. admitted laundering $14 million in drug profits and
agreed to forfeit the cash. The money was put in an escrow account
when the bank was indicted in 1988. The account has accumulated
more than $1 million in interest which the government also gets to
keep.
   BCCI, one of the world's largest private financial institutions,
became the first international bank to admit U.S. money-laundering
charges. The bank also agreed to cooperate in undisclosed
investigations, making available information, books and documents
``relating to relevant matters.''
   Prosecutors also agreed Tuesday to drop conspiracy charges
against one bank officer, citing lack of evidence. Trial continued
for five other BCCI officers and another Colombian.

   Jesse Jackson on Wednesday urged television
executives to pay more attention to programming and marketing aimed
at minority group viewers.
   ``Not only is racism painful, it is unprofitable,'' Jackson told
a workshop audience at the National Association of Television
Program Executives convention, the prime marketplace of syndicated
TV programs.
   Jackson, a civil rights activist and a Democratic presidential
candidate in 1984 and 1988, and other panelists contended that
blacks and other minorities constitute a billion-dollar market that
is not effectively targeted by programmers and advertisers.
   Jackson said, ``African-Americans suffer from five rather deadly
stereotypes every day'' on television.
   ``We are projected as less intelligent than we are, less
hard-working than we work, less universal than we are, less
patriotic than we are and more violent than we are,'' Jackson said.
   ``So we say to programmers, `Give the audience a chance. Don't
use your brain as a strainer, a kind of way of denying people the
option to make judgment,''' he said.
   Don Jackson, no relation, who produces ``Soul Train'' and many
other black-oriented TV programs, told the workshop that when he
entered the business 12 years ago, he got conflicting signals from
the marketplace.
   ``The advertisers, including the black agencies and the general
market agencies, said to me, `If you don't have the stations and
the time periods, we cannot advertise on your show.'''
   And when he went to programmers, ``I found that I did not have
the clout to get the stations nor the time periods. Time periods
that I did get were close to midnight.'' The problem is common
among black producers, he said.
   Only a joint venture with Tribune Broadcasting Co. gave him the
clout, he said.
   ``You have to reach out, entertain what's in the marketplace and
then when you run it, don't embarrass yourself or that market by
putting it on at 1:30 or 2 in the morning,'' Don Jackson told the
programmers.
   ``Take a look at the advertisers who are willing to support our
shows. And finally, take a look at our shows. They are no longer
public affairs or urban affairs shows. They are great, dynamic
entertainment vehicles,'' the producer said.
   Jesse Jackson is entering the syndication market with Warner
Bros. to produce an issues-oriented talk show, ``Voices of
America.''
   The show has commitments in 64 markets, despite trade magazine
reports of ``anxiety'' among programmers. ``Let's call that anxiety
`creative tension.' We're winning,'' Jackson said.
   ``Communication is the key to walls collapsing,'' Jesse Jackson
said. ``As I witnessed the celebration of Dr. King's birthday these
last few days, I wished so fervently that when he was alive
Americans could have heard him in life, and not just in sound
bites, for the biters control the sound.''

<TEXT>
   Most of the Canadians and Americans
killed in the crash of a Costa Rican plane were on their way to
visit a tropical forest reserve, newspapers said Wednesday.
   All 23 people aboard died Monday morning when the twin-engine
propeller plane crashed into the 7,450-foot Pico Blanco mountain,
about 10 miles southwest of San Jose, minutes after taking off in a
driving rain.
   The seven Canadians on board and two of the five Americans had
planned to spend a week at a hotel in the Ventanas de Osa tropical
forest reserve on the Osa Peninsula in southern Costa Rica, the
daily La Nacion said.
   The group was led by Paul Tapscott, 50, of Edmonton, Canada, a
frequent visitor to Costa Rica, the newspaper said.
   ``He was enamored of Costa Rica and its people,'' the newspaper
quoted Tapscott's brother Dean as saying.
   Gabriel Sanchez Fernandez, a Costa Rican tourist guide who was
waiting for the group in Palmar Norte, the plane's destination,
said he had known Tapscott for years.
   ``He came to Costa Rica to escape the bitter cold this time of
year in his country because he had had polio,'' the newspaper
quoted Sanchez Fernandez as saying.
   Fred Ross, also a Canadian, owns the reserve and knew most of
the visitors, the newspaper said.
   The airline, Servicios Aereos Nacionales, a subsidiary of the
national airline Lineas Aereas Costaricenses, S.A. (Lacsa),
identified the Canadians, in addition to Tapscott, as Bill
MacKenzie, Helen MacKenzie, Ian Emmot, Karen Emmot, Gaetan Miliard
and Jean Batiste Perron.
   The U.S. State Department has identified three of the five
Americans as David Ulland of Austin, Minn., Lester Ross of
Lancaster, Pa., and Norman Baltimore of East Smithfield, Pa.
   The airline identified the other two Americans as Hanson Dum and
his daughter Patricia Dum. Their hometowns were not known.
   Lester Ross, 4, and his mother, Magda Ross, a Panamanian, were
traveling from their home in Virginia to visit relatives in Panama,
the airline said.
   The other 10 on board were Costa Ricans.

   Vicki Peterson, a school teacher and full-time
college student on a tight budget, loves to see movies on the big
screen.
   But with first-run movies going for $5.50 or more, she has
turned to a cheaper alternative _ discount theaters. Running older
movies and sometimes double features, these cost-cutting movie
houses cater to a more dollar-conscious crowd.
   ``I only go to 99-cent movies,'' said Peterson at Paul Sanchez's
four-screen Flowers 99 Cent Theater in Takoma Park, Md., near her
home.
   ``You can bring the whole family,'' said another filmgoer, Stu
Jarboe. ``You don't always have to eat the food and save some
money.''
   But moviegoers such as Peterson and Jarboe might face more
limited choices because of a dispute between Paramount Pictures
Corp. and discount theater operators. Paramount has raised its
rentals, and some operators have responded by ceasing to show
Paramount pictures.
   It's either that, they say, or tell customers that the buck
stops here.
   Since last spring, Paramount has been charging operators $1.05
for each adult ticket and 75 cents for each child's ticket. Prior
to that, the annual charge was a flat 35 percent of gross ticket
sales. Paramount says the new pricing is a more equitable way of
spreading the high cost of making movies.
   However, Paramount's action might threaten the discount theater
industry.
   ``If any of the other companies go ahead with the same type of
thing, discount theaters are either going to have to close or raise
the price,'' says Sanchez, who owns four theaters in the Washington
area.
   Jack Clark, president of the National Association of Discount
Theaters, said the new pricing by Paramount caused him to lose
money when he ran a discount theater in Pullman, Wash.
   He showed ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' and under the
new policy made $1,641 in a week, charging customers $1.50 per
ticket. Under the old price scale from Paramount, he made $3,148 in
a week showing the same movie. Clark said he was $269 in the hole
after expenses with Paramount's new rates.
   Discount theater operators, who number several hundred
nationwide, are fighting back, with a lobbying and public relations
campaign aimed at forcing the company to cut prices.
   Board member Randy Hester of the National Association of
Discount Theaters, a trade organization based in Seattle, urges
moviegoers and even members of Congress to write letters of protest
to Paramount.
   Hester, director of corporate development of the Dallas-based
Cinemark USA chain, hopes lawmakers will see what this is going to
do to many moviegoers and will try to take action to stop it.
   ``There are many, many people in the country that can't afford
more than a dollar for a movie ticket,'' he said. ``It wouldn't
take long after visiting a discount theater to see that this is not
the same group of people that are shelling out $5, $6 or $7 for a
first-run movie ticket.''
   There are no lines for movies at dollar theaters. That's because
dollar theaters show movies long after they've had their first run
at pricey movie palaces and multiplexes. Some discount movie
theaters are rundown, with dimly lighted lobbies, worn carpets and
floors sticky from spilled soft drinks and gooey candy.
   That's moviegoer Les Anderson's biggest complaint. ``It costs a
lot in shoes, because they stick to the floor and they don't leave
when you leave.''
   Still, the theaters are havens for the elderly, the poor and
students.
   At the request of the discount theater association, Sen. Howard
M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, has asked the Justice Department to
investigate possible antitrust violations, to see if Paramount may
be hiking rates in conjunction with other studios.
   Paramount's pricing system has a negative impact on the poor,
senior citizens and others on fixed incomes, says Metzenbaum, who
is chairman of a subcommittee on antitrust, monopolies and business
rights.
   Barry London, president of Paramount Pictures, denies any
antitrust violation, saying the company's change in its rental
policy is in no way ``conspiratorial.''
   London says his company is just trying to make discount theaters
bear their fair share of the cost of production, distribution and
marketing. He says the overall success of the movie is ``the engine
that pulls the whole locomotive.''
   Hester, however, considers this a form of buck-passing to the
dollar theaters. He insists the cost of making the movie is already
recovered from many sources.
   ``We pay the film shipping cost both ways. They make no
additional prints for us and give us no money for advertising,'' he
says. ``We get the print after the first-run exhibitor has told us
they can make no more money.''
   He says the higher rental charges are nothing but ``extra
income'' for Paramount. London counters that Hester's charges are
``ridiculous.'' And, he says, dollar movie houses aren't in
business as a public service.
   ``What they're basically doing is using our product to attract
patrons so they can charge them concession prices equivalent to
first-run movie houses,'' he says.
   Concession prices vary from movie house to movie house. Sanchez,
for example, charges $1.50 for popcorn and $1 for drinks. Hester
says his prices are comparable to regular theaters. Clark charged
$1.50 for a large soda and $3.25 for a large popcorn.
   Sales of popcorn and other goodies, London said, generate the
profits that keep the discount theater business popping.

   The owner of two part-pit bull dogs that
fatally injured his elderly grandmother in a half-hour attack wants
the dogs destroyed, but authorities said Wednesday the animals'
deaths must await an investigation.
   Marjee Lilly, 70, died Wednesday at County-USC Medical Center
despite six hours of surgery that included the amputation of her
left arm.
   ``She had puncture wounds on most of her torso and all the flesh
had been eaten off both arms from the wrist to the shoulder,''
police Lt. Alan Kerstein said Tuesdsay. The dogs gnawed on the
woman for about 30 minutes.
   The San Diego woman had been visiting her grandson, Clarence
Hubbard, when the dogs attacked Tuesday.
   Mrs. Lilly, who remained conscious during the mauling, told
police the dogs attacked while she was trying to feed the 45- to
50-pound animals.
   Hubbard, 34, who found his 4-foot-11, 130-pound grandmother on
the floor, said he's owned the 14-month-old pit bull terrier-boxer
mixed breed dogs since they were puppies and they had never
attacked anyone before.
   Hubbard told police he wanted the dogs destroyed, but city
Department of Animal Control Lt. Michael Burns said the dogs would
remain in quarantine at the North Central Animal Care and Control
Center.
   ``Our investigation is far from being complete,'' Burns said.
``We are going to hold the dogs for two reasons: First, we don't
know if they have bitten anyone else so we are holding them on a
10-day rabies quarantine, and second, we have to see if there is
any kind of negligence.''
   Kerstein said there apparently was no criminal violation because
the dogs were on private property.
   Gov. George Deukmejian said during a morning news conference on
another subject that he would be willing to consider legislation
restricting ownership of pit bull terriers.
   ``I'm as disturbed and distressed as anybody,'' the governor
said. ``We have to have some kind of law against owning them or
some other way of completely controlling them.''
   Burns said he would never own a pit bull terrier or recommend
one for a pet because of their unpredictable, vicious nature.
   ``They have a greater propensity for harming, for injuring an
individual. They will continue to attack where another dog will
just bite and run away,'' Burns said.
   ``A pit bull has a propensity for viciousness but some people
like breeds for a vicarious experience. They identify with tough,
big, aggressive dogs,'' he added
   Because there are more of them, German shepherds are the
nation's No. 1 biting dog. ``But per capita, you will have greater
injuries with pit bulls,'' Burns said.

   Sydney Johnson, longtime personal valet to the Duke
of Windsor, died Wednesday in Paris. He was 69.
   Johnson, who spent more than 30 years in the service of the
former King Edward VIII, made his last public appearance greeting
guests Dec. 10 when the Windsors' Paris mansion was reopened by
Mohamed Al Fayed, the owner of the Ritz Hotel in Paris and Harrods
department store in London.
   ``I feel on top of the world,'' Johnson was quoted as saying at
the party, where he was dressed as of old in gold and red livery.
``The restoration is so authentic I expect to see the duchess
stepping down the staircase asking, `How do I look?'''
   A Ritz Hotel official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed Johnson's death and said he had no information about its
cause.
   Al Fayed was quoted by the British domestic news agency Press
Association as saying Johnson ``was truly a gentlemen's gentleman.
We shall miss him very much.''
   Johnson was born in Nassau, The Bahamas, and entered the
Windsors' service when the duke was governor-general of the islands
off Florida during World War II.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   President Bush said Wednesday he still wants
the rest of U.S. invasion troops withdrawn from Panama ``as soon as
possible,'' but he feels under no pressure to get them out before
next month's drug summit in Colombia.
   Bush, posing for pictures in the Rose Garden with Gen. Maxwell
Thurman, the commander of U.S. forces in Panama, congratulated
Thurman and his troops for ``the outstanding job they did for our
country.''
   Bush denied that the United States was having difficulties
finding countries willing to host Vice President Dan Quayle on a
fence-mending mission to the region. Quayle will visit Honduras,
Panama and Jamaica Jan. 27-29.
   Peruvian President Alan Garcia, perhaps the most outspoken
critic of the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion that toppled Manuel Antonio
Noriega, has said he won't attend the Feb. 15 drug summit unless
the U.S. invasion force is out of Panama before then. Garcia plans
to send a minister in his stead.
   The United States sent nearly 15,000 troops to Panama for the
strike against Noriega and his Panamanian Defense Forces, more than
doubling the 12,000 troops on permanent duty there to defend U.S.
bases and the Panama Canal.
   ``We want them out of there as soon as possible,'' Bush said.
``It's my objective to get the troops out and get back to the
levels before this military action.''
   But he emphasized, ``It has nothing to do with the summit in
Cartagena at all. This is prudent, it is right. ... I'm not driven
by the summit.''
   ``I want to do what's right for Panama. I want to do what Panama
wants,'' the president told reporters.
   ``It's Panama's show now,'' Bush said before going into a
National Security Council meeting with Thurman and Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney to discuss Panama and its needs.
   Bush said the new Panamanian government of President Guillermo
Endara ``is strengthening their democracy.''
   ``We want to give them economic help. We want to offer hope to
the individuals there who are out of work, some of it because of
the sanctions we had imposed on Panama,'' said Bush. ``So we're
committed.''
   Noriega is jailed in Miami awaiting trial on drug-trafficking
charges. He surrendered to U.S. authorities on Jan. 3 after 10 days
in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City.
   Thurman said 18,900 U.S. troops are left in Panama, with 8,000
having already returned to the United States.
   ``Eight out and we've got about four or five (thousand) to go,''
said Bush.
   The president praised ``the dedication of those kids'' who
carried out the invasion.
   ``They did a dynamite job,'' the four-star general agreed.
   The invasion drew fire Wednesday from the liberal Americans for
Democratic Action. Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., the ADA president,
said the news media had enjoyed the spectacle of the invasion and
``hysterically supports the tattering of the Constitution.''
   ``Americans should be prepared to fight and die for what is
right,'' said Rangel. ``The question I ask is whether it was
morally and constitutionally right.''
   Quayle will attend a presidential inaugural in Honduras on Jan.
27. The White House announced later Wednesday he will also visit
Panama and Jamaica on that trip, and it said he will travel to
South America March 10-16 to attend inaugurals in Chile and Brazil
and make ``other stops to be determined.'' An administration
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Associated
Press that some Latin countries have quietly discouraged Quayle
from visiting.
   Quayle told a Hoover Institution luncheon Wednesday that
``diplomatic sensitivies'' had delayed the trip scheduling, but
added, ``No country has said, `We don't want the vice president,
period.'''
   Bush announced the Quayle mission Jan. 5, saying, ``I want to
assure all of the countries of Latin America that United States
policy remains one of a friendly, supportive and respectful
neighbor.''
   He said the Panama invasion was a ``unique situation.''

   A $150 million project that allows students to
earn college credits using public television and videos has lost
its main source of funding from a foundation created by former
Ambassador Walter Annenberg, officials said Wednesday.
   The Annenberg Foundation recently informed the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting that it will end its regular quarterly payment
of $2.5 million to the Annenberg@CPB Project because of a recent
Internal Revenue Service ruling altering its tax status, CPB
President Donald Ledwig said.
   ``Further discussions will take place concerning the
foundation's action,'' Ledwig said.
   The project was created in 1981 to expand opportunities for
``independent learners and working adults,'' as well as college
students, to acquire a quality college education. It was launched
when Annenberg gave CPB a $150 million gift to be paid in
increments of $10 million for 15 years.
   The foundation's decision came as a surprise to the CPB and
wider public broadcasting community, according to Communications
Daily, a communications industry newsletter that on Wednesday
reported on the foundation's Jan. 2 notification to CPB.
   ``It was a shock,'' acknowledged one official involved with the
project. ``CPB made an immediate commitment to the project, so it
is not going to end'' but it is uncertain what changes will be made.
   Mara Mayor, project director for six years, said ``We were
surprised'' but that it was ``too soon to say'' what will happen.
   About $50 million in projects have been funded through 1993, the
official said.
   Ledwig said ``In its nine years of operation, the project has
won extraordinary acclaim for the quality and impact of its work
benefiting higher education and the nation's learners.''
   The courses generally air on local public television stations
and through national cable systems, including The Learning Channel.
   Last September, the project introduced an audio-print course
collection, which offers a series of half-hour audio programs,
textbooks, study guides and instructor's manuals.
   All of the courses are designed for students seeking a
baccalaureate degree in the liberal arts and sciences.
   The project also funded demonstrations of new applications of
telecommunications and information technologies in higher
education, including programs at Brown, Harvard and Boston
universities and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   Of the 3,000 colleges and universities nationwide, 1,600 use
Annenberg@CPB project course materials. Project courses have been
offered for credit by 700 colleges across the country, and 125,000
students have received college credit for project courses.
   In an average week, officials said nearly 5 million people watch
project courses and programs on public TV or cable channels.
   Annenberg, the former owner of TV Guide and U.S. ambassador to
Britain during the Nixon administration, has donated millions to
charities and the arts, and founded the University of
Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of Communications.
   CPB is a private, nonprofit corporations authorized by the
Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 to develop noncommercial radio and
television services.

   The number of political action committees
registered to participate in federal elections declined by 90 last
year to 4,178, the Federal Election Commission said Wednesday.
   The FEC, to which all PACs that spend money on presidential and
congressional elections must report, said there has been a net gain
of 160 political action committees during the last five years.
   That rate of growth is meager compared to the mushrooming growth
of federally registered PACs in the five-year period from 1979 to
1984, when their number more than doubled from 2,000 to 4,009.
   The number of federally registered PACs rose steadily throughout
the 1980s until peaking at 4,268 as of Dec. 31, 1988, before
falling by 90 last year, the FEC said.
   The FEC data covers only those political action committees
registered to participate in federal elections and not all PACs
registered with the FEC remain active financially. Thousands more
PACs are registered at the state level.

<HEAD>Mediterranean Fruit Flies Found in Central Chile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities on Wednesday banned the
transport of all fruit out of central Chile's Aconcagua Valley
after the discovery of at least 12 Mediterranean fruit flies in the
area.
   The government Agricultural Service chief, Juan Carlos
Sepulveda, said the flies were found in a residential neighborhood
in Los Andes, a city 48 miles northeast of Santiago. He said none
had been detected in the fruit-growing areas.
   Nonetheless, Sepulveda said, an emergency plan was immediately
implemented that included banning the transport of all fruit out of
the valley.
   Grapes, peaches, nectarines and kiwis are grown in the Aconcagua
area. About 16 million crates are expected to be harvested this
year in the valley, virtually all for export to the United States,
Japan and western Europe.
   Police roadblocks were established to enforce the quarantine,
which coincides with the start of fruit harvesting in the Southern
Hemisphere's summer.
   Regional governor Raul Celis said authorities believe the
problem _ the first time Mediterranean fruit flies have been found
in Chile since 1978 _ will be resolved quickly.
   The emergency plan, Sepulveda said, includes fumigation of fruit
and trees with chemicals. Harvested fruit will be placed in cold
storage three to four days, a common procedure to kill the fly and
its larvae.
   Sepulveda said the Mediterranean flies found in Los Andes are
believed to have been come from neighboring Argentina, where
outbreaks of the insect, which is harmless to humans, has occurred.
   He said the finding had been reported to the United States,
Japan and to the United Nation's agricultural agency, the FAO.
   Ronald Bown, president of the Chilean Fruit Exporters
Association, called the situation ``seious, but controllable.''
   Last year, Chile's fruit exporters suffered a major blow when
two grapes laced with cyanide were found in a Chilean shipment in
Philadelphia.
   The finding prompted the Food and Drug Administration to
temporarily ban the sale of Chilean fruits in the United States.
The government estimated the losses sustained by Chile at $300
million.
   Fruit exports have boomed in recent years, earning about $900
million annually.
   As part of an agreement with the United States to resume the
sales of its fruits, Chile allows FDA officials to check security
measures in the entire export process, including harvesting,
packing and transport of the fruit.
   Two FDA experts however who came to Chile this month to check
the security measures were killed last Wednesday when the small
police plane they were flying crashed in a remote Andean mountain
in northern Chile.

<HEAD>U.S. Groups Say Nicaragua May Be Blocking Voter Education Efforts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican and Democratic organizations
Wednesday charged that Nicaragua's government may be intentionally
blocking the creation of programs to educate the country's voters
about democracy before next month's national elections.
   The groups, which use U.S. government funds to promote democracy
overseas, said Nicaragua has thrown up bureaucratic roadblocks to
the groups' efforts to fund what they described as non-partisan
programs to educate voters and to scrutinize the election process.
   ``We are seriously concerned that this pattern of delay is the
result of a political decision taken by your government to inhibit
action on programs designed to support the democratic process,''
the two organizations wrote in a letter to Victor Tinoco,
Nicaragua's deputy foreign minister.
   The letter from J. Brian Atwood, president of the National
Democratic Institute, and Keith Schuette, president of the National
Republican Institute, appeared to be an effort to break loose money
intended for IPCE, a civic group affiliated with the political
opposition to the ruling Sandinista party.
   The delay ``will seriously undermine Nicaraguan and
international confidence in the electoral system,'' they wrote.
   The charge comes on the heels of reports of electoral
intimidation and violence by Sandinista supporters and the denial
of visas to a presidentially appointed U.S. observer group for the
Feb. 25 national elections.
   The two institutes are seeking to provide a total of $1.5
million to IPCE to pay for training of poll watchers, pay workers
to comb through voter registration lists looking for errors or
fraud, and air television spots explaining how to vote.
   ``These are voters who've either voted in crooked elections, or
never voted before in their lives,'' said one institute official,
speaking to reporters only on condition of anonymity.
   But by Wednesday, all efforts to get the money to local
officials had been thwarted, said officials of both institutes.
``There is already a significant deterioration in what we expected
to accomplish,'' said one.
   There has been relatively little trouble getting equipment
bought and delivered directly to UNO, the opposition political
coalition, the officials said. Some $800,000 in equipment _ mostly
vehicles and office machines _ is in the process of being
delivered, they said.
   Meanwhile, an Organization of American States report submitted
by an OAS observer group said that as of Dec. 15, 191
non-Sandinista candidates had dropped out as candidates in the Feb.
25 elections because of intimidation or harassment. Slightly more
than half of the dropouts represented the UNO coalition, the
largest opposition grouping.
   Most of the 191 had been candidates for municipal council posts;
the remainder had sought seats in the National Assembly, said the
report, which was signed by OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares.
   The study calls intimidation one of the biggest problems of the
electoral process and said both pro- and anti-Sandinista partisans
have been affected.
   It said that at times the problem consists of threats of loss of
benefits or employment, of phone calls or anonymous messages, of
damage to personal property, or of physical threats or death
threats.
   The report also said there have been incidents of violence at
campaign rallies but added that it has not been easy to uncover the
causes.
   The report was issued a day after Elliot Richardson, the
personal representative of the U.N. secretary general for the
Nicaraguan elections, said he believed the Feb. 25 voting will be
carried out fairly.
   But, like the OAS report, he expressed concern about the
atmosphere surrounding the campaign, citing use of government
assets by the Sandinistas for campaigning.

<HEAD>Administration Going Ahead With European Base Relocation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is moving forward with
plans to relocate a U.S. tactical wing from Spain to Italy despite
congressional calls for reducing active forces overseas, a lawmaker
said Wednesday.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a senior member of the House
Armed Services Committee, said she received a letter from Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney indicating that he is ``going full speed
ahead on Crotone,'' the planned site for the tactical wing.
   In January 1988, the United States accepted Spain's demands that
the Air Force withdraw its 401st Tactical Wing of 72 F-16 fighter
bombers from the joint U.S.-Spanish air base at Torrejon de Ardoz,
just east of Madrid.
   Italy agreed to provide a new home for the jets, approximately
3,600 troops and 600 civilians at Crotone.
   ``The average person seeing everyone pulling out ... will be
astounded,'' Schroeder, a longtime opponent of relocating the
tactical wing in Italy, said in a telephone interview. ``This isn't
even a warfighting base.''
   The Pentagon has estimated the total cost of Crotone at $885
million. Under the administration plan, the United States would pay
$470 million, or 55 percent of the total cost, with NATO picking up
the remainder of the expense.
   Historically, the United States picks up 28 percent of the costs
of such base construction under the NATO Infrastructure program.
House and Senate negotiators, who had agreed on differing numbers
for the U.S. cost, compromised in the fiscal 1990 defense bill and
capped expenditures at $360 million, limiting U.S. payments to 40
percent and forcing the administration to renegotiate with NATO on
the remaining cost.
   That provision was included in the defense bill that President
Bush signed into law late last year.
   In May 1989, the relocation came under attack as Sen. Carl
Levin, D-Mich., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
raised the possibility of returning the unit back to the United
States and turning it into a reserve unit.
   Levin noted that former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci had
announced withdrawal of the wing before NATO offered to help.
   John A. Woodworth, deputy assistant secretary of defense for
European and NATO policy, warned against that step, saying, ``We
will harm ourselves seriously with the allies.''

<HEAD>U.S. Vetoes Resolution on Ransacking of Nicaraguan Residence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States on Wednesday vetoed a
Security Council resolution that would have denounced the
ransacking of the residence of Nicaragua's ambassador to Panama by
U.S. troops.
   The United States, as a permanent member of the Security
Council, has veto power over resolutions. There were 13 votes
favoring the resolution; Britain abstained.
   Alejandro Serrano Caldera, Nicaragua's U.N. envoy, asked the
Security Council to denounce the U.S. search of the residence on
Dec. 29, saying it violated international agreements of diplomatic
immunity.
   He called the U.S. actions a serious threat to international
peace and security in the region and accused the United States of
trying to provoke the Nicaraguan government.
   The attack on the residence came amid heightened tension in the
region following the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion of Panama.
   Thomas Pickering, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, called
Nicaragua's request for Security Council action on the issue ``an
effort to turn the council into a propaganda exercise, nothing more
or nothing less.''
   Pickering said the United States has expressed public regret
over the events that occurred at the Nicaragua ambassador's
residence in Panama. He said the ransacking by U.S. troops occurred
while ``the situation in Panama was indeed extraordinary.''
   President Bush has called the assault of the Nicaraguan
ambassador's residence a mistake _ a ``screwup'' _ but noted heavy
weapons were discovered there and questioned why a diplomat needed
them.
   The permanent members of the Security Council are the United
States, Soviet Union, Britain, France and China. The current
temporary members are Canada, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Yemen, Cuba,
Ethiopia, Finland, Malaysia, Rumania and Zaire.

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp on Wednesday
killed a program that allows private lenders to commit the
government to insuring mortgages and that has cost taxpayers nearly
$1 billion because of sour loans.
   Because of projects in the approval pipeline, Kemp said the
program would have to be phased out, a period Department of Housing
and Urban Development officials said was likely to last several
months or perhaps longer because of necessary regulatory approvals.
   In the interim, Kemp ordered, effective immediately, that
private lenders preparing to approve a co-insured loan first submit
all documentation to HUD for approval.
   Kemp's decision comes four months after HUD officials said the
co-insurance program would be reformed and revived. It was one of
many HUD programs investigated during last year's allegations of
mismanagement and influence peddling at HUD during the Reagan
administration.
   Democrats in Congress have told Kemp not to use the scandals as
an excuse to kill programs, but a key congressional aide said he
expected no battle over ending the troubled co-insurance program.
But the aide, Donald Campbell, staff director of the Senate housing
subcommittee, said Democrats likely would question whether HUD has
enough qualified staffers to oversee another insurance program Kemp
promoted as an alternative to co-insurance.
   The co-insurance program, created in 1983, was part of the
Reagan administration's effort reduce the federal bureaucracy by
turning over work to the private sector.
   The program allows private lenders to process mortgages for
multifamily housing developments and unilaterally commit HUD to
insuring roughly 80 percent of them in the event of default. Audits
by HUD's inspector general have criticized many of the co-insurance
lenders for approving bloated mortgages that far exceeded the value
of the property.
   The General Accounting Office has estimated that defaults and
other related losses have cost taxpayers at least $960 million.
   The most notorious case _ which Kemp cited in his statement
announcing the decision _ was the HUD-backed loan for the Colonial
House apartment complex in Houston.
   The development was co-insured for $47.2 million and ultimately
defaulted because of vacancy problems blamed on rents that were too
high for the depressed Houston real estate market but necessary to
cover the mortgage. HUD was forced to take over Colonial House and
recovered just $8.9 million when it auctioned the development last
year.
   Kemp suspended the program last summer as evidence of shoddy
mortgage underwriting mounted, and he has suspended six
participating lenders and placed seven more on probation. Kemp had
placed a moratorium on admitting new lenders into the program
pending a restructuring.
   In September, HUD officials said privately that the department
was on the verge of announcing reforms to the co-insurance program.
They then said the announcement was on hold because of delays in
drafting the necessary regulations.
   But in his statement Wednesday, Kemp said extensive reviews of
the program by HUD staff and outside auditors had convinced him to
kill it.
   ``The co-insurance method is structurally flawed and
fundamentally unsound as well as administratively unfixable,'' Kemp
said. ``In comparing the losses resulting from co-insurance to the
housing it provided, it is clear that co-insurance has been a bad
deal for the American taxpayer.''
   As an alternative financing method, Kemp promoted HUD's full
insurance program, under which the government fully insures
multifamily housing mortgages. In this program HUD is 100 percent
liable in the event of default, but the department handles the
underwriting _ as opposed to the private lenders in the
co-insurance program _ presumably giving it the oversight necessary
to identify risky or bloated mortgages.
   ``The problem here is that they are going back to full insurance
and there is no evidence that the have the staff to handle the
demand,'' Campbell said, noting that the Bush administration
resisted attempts by Democrats to boost HUD staffing levels this
year.
   Kemp said he was taking a number of steps to restructure the
full insurance program, including allowing private lenders to
process and service those loans in exchange for a fee. But only HUD
would have the authority to issue the insurance necessary for the
loans to be approved and it also would receive 100 percent of the
mortage insurance premiums.
   Kemp said the restructuring of the full insurance program would
be completed by year's end.
   Among the revelations concerning the co-insurance program made
last year during congressional hearings and through documents
released by HUD was that one company, DRG Funding Corp., had a
co-insurance loan portfolio that included nearly $600 million of
the more than $900 million in losses.
   DRG had been placed on probation during the Reagan
administration by then-HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. and
required to submit all of its proposed co-insurance loans to HUD
for approval.
   But Pierce lifted the restrictions after being lobbied by Carla
Hills, a former HUD secretary who at the time was in private law
practice and now serves as the Bush administration's trade
representative.

<HEAD>Portugal Speeds Help to Fight Madeira Oil Slick</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VILA BALEIRA, Madeira Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environment Minister
Fernando Real and antipollution experts flew to Porto Santo
Wednesday in the fight to contain an oil slick that blackened
tourist beaches here and threatened a nature reserve.
   Authorities flew dissolvants, floating barriers, pumps and other
equipment from Lisbon to this Atlantic island, part of Portugal's
Madeira archipelago.
   The Madeiras lie 625 miles southwest of Lisbon and about 425
miles west of Morocco.
   More than 50 tons of crude oil washed up on the island since
Monday, mostly on Porto Santo's rocky north and east coasts, said a
Portuguese naval official.
   Witnesses said the oil-soaked bodies of gulls, turtles and fish
washed onto the island.
   Oil patches covered about one mile of white sand on the vacation
island's famed 6{-mile south coast beach.
   The Portuguese news agency Lusa said public health authorities
banned the sale of fish in Porto Santo and desalination plants
producing 80 percent of the drinking water were shut down because
of fears of oil contamination.
   The origin of the oil spill remained a mystery.
   Ensign Adriano Queiros of Madeira naval command said by
telephone that small amounts of oil reached the north coast of
Madeira island, 28 miles southwest, but that Madeira was in no
immediate danger of major polution.
   He said the 12{-mile slick was lying stationary off Porto Santo.
   Raimundo Quintao, president of the Madeira Ecological Club, said
he saw 15 oil-covered turtles dying at Porto Santo and many more
may have died at sea.
   ``These are endangered animals. Because of this alone, it's an
environmental disaster,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Portuguese navy officers said it was unlikely the oil came from
the Iranian tanker Khark 5, which leaked about 19 million gallons
into the Atlantic last month, Lusa reported.
   They said the oil that washed up this week was dense and black,
while oil that has been in the sea for some time turns yellowish
and foamy.
   Officials said the oil could have been dumped from tankers that
passed along the busy sea-lanes off Madeira.
   Navy spokesman Cmdr. Antonio Monteiro Coelho said oil samples
would be analyzed to try to find the origin of the spill.
   Porto Santo had few resources of its own to fight an oil spill.
Residents scraped up oil with shovels, brooms and buckets.
   Ecologists accused Portuguese authorities of reacting slowly to
the crisis. ``The ways they have of dealing with it are ridiculous.
... It's been very slow,'' said Quintao.
   Madeira biologist Manuel Biscoito told Lusa he was concerned
over the damage the slick could cause to a nature reserve on the
Desertas islands, 37 miles south of Porto Santo.
   The craggy islands are home to rare maritime animals, including
one of the world's last breeding colonies of the Mediterranean monk
seal, an endangered marine mammal.

   Wednesday's developments in Eastern Europe:
   _ Soviet leaders said soldiers could open fire if necessary on
Armenians and Azerbaijanis fighting in AZERBAIJAN. At least 58
people, mostly Armenians, have been killed and 169 injured in five
days of civil warfare.
   _ Food officials in ROMANIA said meat shortages have become
critical and short-term rationing has been imposed in some areas to
fight hoarding. Government officials announced that public,
televised trials would begin next week for six top henchmen of
ousted dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   _ In EAST GERMANY, former Communist Party chief Egon Krenz
denied responsibility for the brutal suppression of fall
pro-democracy protests. The non-Communist Christian Democrats
threatened to pull out of the coalition government to protest the
Communists' continued tight grip on power. The chief Supreme Court
judge resigned and the deputy chief prosecutor was fired for
allegedly moving too slowly to prosecute corruption. The Communist
Party newspaper blamed the opposition group New Forum for Monday's
rampage through secret police headquarters in East Berlin. New
Forum denied responsibility.
   _ A spokesman for WEST GERMANY's opposition party said the
government should discourage East Germans from resettling in the
West.
   _ A foreign ministry spokesman confirmed CZECHOSLOVAKIA will
seek a complete pullout of Soviet troops by the end of 1990 and
that the withdrawal will be a key issue when President Vaclav Havel
visits Moscow next month. Alexander Dubcek, president of
Czechoslovakia's parliament, said the government is drawing up new
laws to protect human rights.
   _ Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said POLAND's drastic economic
plan will fail without immediate outside financial help.
Representatives of 6,000 striking miners who shut down mines
Tuesday met with the finance minister to discuss their demands for
higher pay.
   _ European Community Commission President Jacques Delors said
the EC must provide greater economic aid to the East Bloc nations.
   _ At the military strategies meeting in Vienna, the United
States' top military officer, Gen. Colin Powell, said no members of
the Warsaw Pact have suggested pulling out of the alliance despite
the changes in Eastern Europe. Gen. Nikolaj Chervov, head of the
directorate of the Soviet general staff, disclosed that a key
policy-making body of top Communist officials of the alliance would
likely be disbanded.

   A federal judge Wednesday ordered a hearing in
connection with John Poindexter's effort to subpoena former
President Reagan as a witness at Poindexter's upcoming trial.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene said next Tuesday's
court session will focus on whether a president or former president
may be subpoenaed to be a witness at a trial under any
circumstances.
   Greene asked that lawyers for Reagan, Poindexter, the Justice
Department and the Iran-Contra prosecutor's office address possible
alternatives to bringing Reagan to court to testify during
Poindexter's trial.
   Alternatives might be having Reagan give a videotaped deposition
or giving written responses to questions.
   Poindexter is seeking court approval to subpoena Reagan's
testimony, asserting that the president authorized some of the
activities in the Iran-Contra affair for which the ex-national
security adviser now is accused of crimes.
   The judge said the lawyers should address what kind of showing
Poindexter must make regarding the ``materiality or necessity'' of
Reagan's testimony before the former national security adviser is
allowed to subpoena his ex-boss.
   Reagan's lawyers have cited ``substantial constitutional
questions'' about subpoenaeing the former president's testimony and
they are asking that a decision be put off until prosecutors
complete their case against Poindexter.
   Poindexter, scheduled to go to trial Feb. 20, is charged with
conspiracy, obstructing Congress and three counts of making false
statements in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   On another matter, Greene ordered independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh, whose office is prosecuting Poindexter, to provide by Monday
the former president's written answers given to a federal grand
jury that investigated the Iran-Contra affair.
   Greene will decide whether to turn over the written answers to
Poindexter. Reagan's answers, given while he was still president,
have never been publicly disclosed.
   In connection with a separate subpoena, Reagan was ordered by
Greene to turn over to the court by Jan. 7 portions of the former
president's diaries pertaining to Iran-Contra matters.
   Greene is expected to rule on whether the excerpts will be
turned over to Poindexter in preparation for his trial.

<HEAD>Malaysia Withdraws as Host of Meeting Because Israel Present</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Malaysia has withdrawn its offer
to host the 46th annual session of the U.N. Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) after failing to
resolve problems over the presence of Israel, which is an observer
at the meeting.
   The state news agency Bernama quoted foreign ministry officials
as saying the Malaysian government informed the Bangkok-based ESCAP
of its decision last month.
   The ministerial-level meeting will be held instead in June in
Bangkok, Thailand's capital. The Kuala Lumpur meeting had been
scheduled for March 19-28, the officials said.
   Malaysia has no diplomatic relations with Israel and is a strong
critic of Israeli actions against the Palestinians, who have
battled for 25 months against Israel rule and are pressing for an
independent homeland. Israelis are not allowed to visit Malaysia.
   The officials said problems had arisen over the use of name
plates identifying the seating for Israel at the meeting and the
use of the Israeli flag.
   To overcome the problem, Malaysia requested that no name plates
be used for observer countries that would instead be grouped under
a single observer tag.
   However, ESCAP said observer name plates had been used at all
previous sessions and that the Kuala Lumpur meeting would follow
precedent, the officials said.
   The Malaysian Cabinet then decided to withdraw Malaysia's offer
to host the session, the officials said.
   Malaysia offered to host the session last March.

   The Kremlin Wednesday told the thousands of
soldiers it sent to the Caucasus to shoot if need be to halt bands
of Azerbaijanis and Armenians fighting each other in hills around
the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Thousands of Armenian refugees poured from the southern republic
of Azerbaijan, many beaten or chased from their homes by angry
mobs. Some blamed the attacks on Azerbaijanis who earlier fled
ethnic violence in Armenia.
   The death toll rose to 58, mostly Armenians, and the number of
injured to 169 in five days of civil warfare, an Interior Ministry
official said.
   The evening TV news show ``Vremya'' ran a statement from the KGB
and the interior and defense ministries, which control troops in
the area, that said:
   ``Risking their lives, they have so far refrained from using
arms against criminals to prevent bloodshed.
   ``However, a sharp increase in outrageous attacks has made the
situation unbearable,'' and the soldiers now were permitted to use
their weapons in accordance with military rules and Soviet law.
   Four burned bodies were found in Baku, the capital of
Azerbaijan, the official news agency Tass said Wednesday. Eighteen
Armenian residents were injured in Azerbaijan the past 24 hours.
   The violence erupted Saturday with anti-Armenian riots in Baku.
Fighting rapidly spread to Nagorno-Karabakh and nearby areas of
Azerbaijan, with the belligerents using helicopters, armored
vehicles, machine guns and other arms seized from government
arsenals or offered by compatriots.
   It was the worst fighting between mainly Moslem Azerbaijanis and
mostly Christian Armenians since their decades-old feud over
Nagorno-Karabakh erupted in violence two years ago. The enclave,
populated mainly by Armenians, has been ruled by Azerbaijan since
1923 and the current troubles were sparked by its demand in
February 1988 to be annexed by Armenia. It has about 160,000 people.
   Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Wednesday
that Islamic fervor was behind events in Soviet Azerbaijan, and
warned Moscow not to deal harshly with the Shiite Moslem upsurge,
Tehran radio reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Cyprus, quoted Khamenei as saying
``anyone who thinks or pretends that the motives behind these
movements are ethnic or nationalistic is making a big mistake.
These sentiments are Islamic, and Soviet leaders should face this
fact with realism.''
   The Kremlin has empowered local officials to ban demonstrations
and strikes, impose curfews, censor the media, confiscate weapons,
disband unofficial organizations and detain people for up to 30
days. Interior Ministry officials said they could not recall such
measures being imposed since World War II.
   Foreign reporters have been barred from the region.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent 11,000 army and internal
security troops to the southern region Tuesday, but they have been
slowed by Azerbaijanis who erected barricades on roads and at a
military airfield.
   The reinforcements ``haven't helped yet because they haven't
started to act,'' said Dmitri Seleznyov, spokesman for the Interior
Ministry in Moscow.
   Troops engaged in at least one battle Tuesday, when an armed
group tried to seize five armored personnel carriers near the
village of Tazikend. Soldiers fired on the group, wounding two men,
Tass reported.
   ``Since then, attempts to take APCs have stopped, because before
this they weren't used to having weapons used against them,''
Seleznyov said.
   Reinforcements also were sent to the nearby border with Iran,
Tass said. More than 7,000 Armenians have been evacuated from Baku,
many in ferry boats across the Caspian Sea.
   In Baku, a handful of Soviet soldiers for nearly three hours
held back a crowd of 5,000 people trying to prevent the detention
of 10 nationalists who broke into the apartment of a Russian
family, Tass said. They finally agreed to release the 10, and led
the Russians and an Armenian family out of the house, protecting
them with shields.
   In Armenia, residents broke into police stations and other
buildings seeking weapons, Seleznyov said. About 50,000 people
attended a rally in the Armenian capital Yerevan to hear reports
about the fighting, said Armenian activist Karen Shakhbazyan.
   Azerbaijanis staged protests in Baku and elsewhere to demand
they be armed and allowed to defend their claim to
Nagorno-Karabakh, newspapers and officials said.
   Azerbaijanis continued their rail blockade of Armenia's 3.5
million people, cutting short fuel and other supplies. Azerbaijan
has 6.9 million people.
   The Soviet government and the Communist Party issued a joint
statement of condolence to families of the dead.
   In Moscow, a 49-year-old Armenian woman spoke sadly of the night
Azerbaijani thugs beat her in front of her 15-year-old son.
   ``They are killing us,'' said Alisa Arakelova, her face swollen
and black from a fractured jaw, her left wrist and two fingers
broken and encased in plaster, and fingernails blackened and
smashed. She escaped Baku for Moscow after the attack in her
apartment, just days before ethnic hatred erupted in the latest,
most deadly round of two years of ethnic violence in the Caucasus.
   Armenian refugees milling about the Moscow office of the
Armenian republic traded horrendous stories of atrocities, but none
claimed to be direct witnesses. Many blamed Gorbachev for failing
to halt the violence that has torn the two southern republics for
nearly two years.
   Both Arakelova, interviewed at the Armenian office, and the
government newspaper Izvestia said much of the violence in Baku
involves Azerbaijani refugees from Armenia forcing Armenians from
their apartments so they will have a place to live. Izvestia said
tens of thousands of Azerbaijanis who fled ethnic violence in
Armenia in late 1988 remain without homes or jobs in Baku.
   Arakelova, an Armenian who has lived her entire life in Baku,
said some Azerbaijani men broke into her apartment a week ago and
``they began beating me with everything they could find,''
including a brick and a heavy wooden pole.
   She fled that night, and her hometown a few days later, not even
stopping to find the identity papers she must produce to check into
a Soviet hotel. ``They took all my property, and there is somebody
living in my apartment already,'' she said.
   She said the police advised them to leave, and said they have
lost control of the city.
   Ambartsyum Galstyan, an Armenian activist reached by telephone
in Yerevan, said soldiers were advising Armenians in villages along
the border between the republics to evacuate, leading them to fear
that the government has decided to solve the ethnic violence by
permanently separating the two populations.
   ``Vremya'' showed elderly Armenian women being treated for
injuries in Yerevan and said 72 of the evacuees from Baku were
hospitalized, including 20 in grave condition.
   In Tbilisi, capital of neighboring Georgia, 3,000 Armenians
rallied at the House of Government to show support for their
brothers in Azerbaijan, activist Sergei Dandurov said in a
telephone interview. Protesters also shouted their support for
independence for Georgia and Armenia.

   Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, said Wednesday that Islamic fervor was behind events in
Soviet Azerbaijan, and warned Moscow not to deal harshly with the
Shiite Moslem upsurge, Tehran radio reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Khamenei as saying
``anyone who thinks or pretends that the motives behind these
movements are ethnic or nationalistic is making a big mistake.
These sentiments are Islamic, and Soviet leaders should face this
fact with realism.''
   Official reports from Soviet Azerbaijan and Armenia say at least
58 people have been killed in violence over who should control of
Nagorno-Karabakh. The region contains mostly Christian Armenians,
but has been part of predominantly Moslem Azerbaijan since 1923.
   Moscow on Monday enforced a state of emergency in parts of both
republics and sent in Red Army units and KGB troops to protect
citizens from violence.
   Khamenei praised the ``admirable courage'' of Soviet authorities
in allowing free expression to Islam, but warned they should not
``through wrong analysis respond harshly and oppressively to these
Islamic sentiments.''
   The animosity between Armenians and Azerbaijanis flared into
violence Saturday when some Azerbaijanis in Baku went on the
rampage against Armenians living there.
   The clashes were preceded by demonstrations in Azerbaijan, when
hundreds of Soviet Moslems gathered on the bank of the Aras river
which forms part of the frontier with Iran, and demanded an open
border and free trade with their kin on the other side.
   The Soviet Azerbaijanis are bound by a common language, culture
and religion with their brethren across the frontier, who
constitute a third of Iran's 55 million people.
   Tehran radio reported more than 70 Soviet Moslems swam across
the river for short visits with their Iranian kin since the
religious upsurge on Dec. 31.
   The Tehran government has said it welcomes Soviet Moslems who
would like to visit Iran, and free trade across the border.
   A Soviet delegation is expected to visit Iran soon to discuss
tourist travel and trade between the Iranian and Soviet Azerbaijans.

<HEAD>Boston University President Announces for Governor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVE EPSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boston University President John Silber announced
Wednesday he plans to seek the Democratic nomination for governor,
although he has a few quibbles with the party.
   Silber, 63, the university's president for 19 years, is entering
his first political race. Being an outsider is a help, he said.
   ``Who is likely as governor to make the changes that are
needed?'' Silber said. ``Those who have failed in the past to
change the way things are done, or someone who comes in from the
outside?''
   The governorship became a wide-open race a year ago when Michael
S. Dukakis announced he would not seek another term when his third
term expires at the end of 1990. Silber is the fourth candidate to
seek the Democratic endorsement.
   Silber, joined by his wife, his 95-year-old mother and five of
his seven children, made his well-orchestrated announcement to
several hundred supporters seated in the wooden pews of the
historic Old South Meeting House.
   Silber acknowledged differences with the state's dominant party,
although he said he has been a Democrat most of his life.
   ``In recent years, I have become increasingly dissatisfied with
the direction of the Democratic Party,'' Silber said. ``It has
become increasingly a party of very narrow special interests and
single-issue politics.''
   He has acknowledged voting for Republicans George Bush and
Ronald Reagan in recent political elections and served as an
adviser to President Reagan on commissions dealing with Central
America.
   To win a spot on the Sept. 18 primary ballot, Silber needs at
least 15 percent of the delegates elected to the party's June
convention. The others seeking the Democratic nomination are Lt.
Gov. Evelyn Murphy, former state Attorney General Francis Bellotti
and state House Taxation Committee Chairman John Flood.
   Former federal prosecutor William Weld, state House Minority
Leader Steven Pierce, former Congressman Paul Cronin and former
Metropolitan District Commissioner Guy Carbone are among those
seeking the Republican nomination.
   With his emphasis on being an outsider, Silber joins several
other Democrats in distancing himself from those who have guided
the state through a difficult year with a budget crisis and Dukakis
losing his bid for president.
   Silber as BU president has made enemies with expansion of his
urban campus and with decisions such as a ban on overnight
dormitory visitors of the opposite sex. He frequently is at odds
with his faculty, where union organizing drives are a constant.
   The university trustees are scheduled to meet Thursday to
discuss Silber's leave status from the 26,000-student school, said
Tom Cashman, a university spokesman.

   The death Wednesday of a 70-year-old California woman who was
mauled by her grandson's pit bull terriers was the latest in a
continuing series of deaths and serious injuries caused by the
tough canine breed.
   Two dogs mauled Marjee Lilly of San Diego on Tuesday at her
grandson's home in Los Angeles. Authorities said she was trying to
feed the dogs when they attacked.
   Here is a list of some other recent fatal pit bull attacks:
   April 6, 1987 _ Dr. William Eckman, 67, of Kettering, Ohio, is
killed by two pit bulls while visiting another home.
   June 13, 1987 _ A pit bull trained for prizefighting and
guarding a backyard marijuana crop kills 2-year-old James Soto
after the boy wanders into a neighbor's yard in Morgan Hill, Calif.
   July 4, 1987 _ Robert Barbarita, 29, of Rochester, N.Y., is
attacked by a pit bull while watching fireworks in a park.
Barbarita died two weeks later from a blood clot that traveled from
his badly bitten leg to his lung.
   Nov. 10, 1988 _ Graduate student Kevin B. Cull, 25, is attacked
and killed by two pit bulls while walking up a driveway in Geneva,
Ill., to meet friends.
   Dec. 11, 1988 _ Six-month-old Amber Vergara is fatally mauled by
her father's pit bull at home in Canton, Ohio.
   May 4, 1989 _ Three-year-old Justin Webb is killed by his

   Plans by the university Thomas
Jefferson founded that threatened to blot out a view of his home
overlooking the Blue Ridge Mountains were ``the wake-up call'' for
preservationists, a spokesman said Wednesday.
   The University of Virginia announced this week that it has
decided against putting an $11 million office complex near the
entrance to the house the third president built. It was the second
time in about 10 years that a view of Jefferson's home, Monticello,
had been threatened.
   The complex would have blocked the view from those driving on a
nearby road. The house, which sits on a hill on the outskirts of
Charlottesville, can now be seen from some distance away. The
proposed complex would have been between the road and the house.
   ``The setting of Monticello was important to Mr. Jefferson and
it's important to us,'' said Daniel P. Jordan, executive director
of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, which owns Monticello
and the surrounding 2,000 acres. ``That was the wake-up call and
we're concerned about protecting what's left.''
   ``What this thing has done is alert Monticello to take care of
its entrance,'' said Robert Carter, a foundation trustee.
   The complex was to have housed the state Department of Forestry
and some other offices. It was not to have been part of the campus,
which is on the other side of town.
   The foundation is trying to buy an easement from the university
to provide permanent protection from future development, Jordan
said. Other options include having the entrance designated a scenic
parkway, he said.
   University spokesman William Fishback said the school Jefferson
founded in 1819 is now considering half a dozen other sites.
   ``From an economic development standpoint, any community would
be delighted to have a clean industry,'' Fishback said.
   Jordan said the foundation also is working with the Trust for
Public Land, to develop a strategy to protect Monticello. That
group helped protect Mount Vernon, George Washington's home.
   Monticello is depicted on the back of the nickel.
   ``About a decade ago, there was an attempt to change a cemetery
along the corridor,'' Jordan said. ``They wanted to construct a
mausoleum that would have been a replica of Monticello that
provoked a furor and was beaten back.''
   Jordan hailed the university's decision, saying ``it was the
right decision and best for everybody, including the university.''
   ``It's real important that our nation recognize that this was a
tough decision for the university, and we commend their willingness
to reconsider and their decision to look elsewhere,'' Jordan said.
``We think this shows sensitivity on their part, on this issue.''

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Claim of Two Professed Wiretappers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Wednesday threw out an $11 million
claim by two fired telephone workers who contend their reputations
were damaged when the company denied their accusations that it
engaged in illegal wiretapping.
   Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Fred Cartolano ruled that
Leonard Gates and Robert Draise, both former Cincinnati Bell
Telephone Co. employees, had not proved they were defamed by the
company.
   Gates and Draise claimed they set 1,200 illegal wiretaps on
telephones of criminal suspects, reporters and public officials
from 1972 to 1984 at the direction of company supervisors or police.
   Cincinnati Bell denied the allegations and sued Gates and Draise
for defamation. The two fired workers countersued for $11 million.
   A jury has been hearing the lawsuits since Nov. 20. The
telephone company's suit against the pair is continuing.
   The judge said he based his decision on several factors,
including Gates' and Draise's refusals to submit to polygraph
tests. The judge also said he found inconsistencies in their
allegations about when some of the wiretaps took place.
   Cartolano also cited an opinion by U.S. Magistrate Robert
Steinberg, who said Gates was not a credible witness. Steinberg
presided over Gates' employment case against Cincinnati Bell, which
fired Gates in 1986.
   Gates said Steinberg's opinion should not have been considered,
since the case has been appealed to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
   The judge said Gates and Draise could be defined as public
figures who sought out the media to press their claims of
corruption at the phone company.
   ``At this time you're subjected to a higher standard of proof,''
Cartolano said. ``You must prove that the false statements (were)
made with actual malice.''
   Gates and Draise, who were acting as their own attorneys, argued
that they were not public figures and that the media sought them
out.
   ``I don't feel we're public figures,'' Gates said. ``We didn't
ask to be sued. We only countersued because they were suing us.''
   Cartolano ruled after Draise and Gates rested their case against
the phone company.
   ``We are pleased with the judge's decision to dismiss Gates' and
Draise's claim,'' Cincinnati Bell spokeswoman Cyndy Cantoni said.
``We'll have further comment after the jury rules.''

<HEAD>Kohl Says Germans Do Not Want Discussion of Changing Borders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Wednesday
that the German people have no intention of reviving the national
border issue because it could be divisive.
   Kohl has been criticized for refusing to call specifically for
permanent confirmation of the current border between Poland and
East Germany, leading some to fear a reunited Germany might seek to
regain territory it ceded to Poland after World War II.
   In a speech before the French Institute of Foreign Relations,
Kohl repeated his government's policy that the definitive
establishment of the country's borders can only come in a freely
negotiated peace settlement involving all of Germany.
   But he said most Germans do not want to raise the question of
the country's borders _ an issue that has arisen since Poland and
East Germany shed their hard-line governments last year and began
instituting reform.
   ``The Germans _ and no one should doubt it _ have no intention
of starting in tomorrow's Europe a discussion about frontiers that
would necessarily compromise the order of European peace to which
we all aspire together,'' he said.
   ``The Germans want a durable reconciliation with their Polish
neighbors and, for that, the Poles must equally have the certitude
of living within sure frontiers,'' he said.
   Kohl said this is why ``nobody wants to link reunification with
the movement of existing borders _ borders which in a future Europe
of freedom are bound to lose their importance.''

   A brother and sister wanted on federal charges
of running a cocaine-trafficking ring between Colombia and this
country were extradited Wednesday by deputy U.S. marshals.
   Diana Maria Caballero Rangel Gamber, 29, and Roberto Caballero
Rangel, 32, were turned over to U.S. marshals by Colombian
authorities and flown to Greensboro, N.C., the Marshals Service
said.
   The two were arrested Oct. 20 by Colombian authorities in
Bucaramanga on federal drug trafficking charges steming from a 1988
indictment returned by a federal grand jury in Greensboro, N.C.
   They had been in custody awaiting extradition.
   The indictment charges that the two participated, along with 11
other defendants, in the cocaine-trafficking ring that operated
over a 5 1@2-year period between Colombia and Florida, Arizona and
the Carolinas.
   Among other things, Ms. Gamber is accused of delivering by
automobile ``kilogram quantities'' of cocaine from Colombia to her
brother in Phoenix.
   So far, 13 Colombians have been extradited to this country since
last August, when Colombian President Virgilio Barco announced a
crackdown on drug lords.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Karl Schwarzenberg, whose
aristocratic family was the biggest private landowner in prewar
Czechoslovakia, heads a team of consultants appointed by President
Vaclav Havel, news media said Wednesday.
   The official CTK news agency said the team comprises important
Czechoslovak personalities living abroad. Schwarzenberg is an
Austrian citizen.
   No other names were disclosed, but it was believed the idea was
to attract influential exiled Czechoslovaks to return home. The
announcement did not give details on the corps of consultants.
   Schwarzenberg's full name is Karl Fuerst (prince) zu
Schwarzenberg.
   Nobility titles were abolished and forbidden after the collapse
of the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918, when Austria became a
republic.
   As chairman of the Vienna-based International Helsinki
Federation for Human Rights, Schwarzenberg, 52, traveled frequently
in communist Eastern Europe. He was sometimes denied a visa from
some Soviet bloc countries, including pre-revolution Czechoslovakia.
   Schwarzenberg repeatedly intervened in behalf of the late Soviet
dissident Andrei Sakharov; Havel, and other former human rights
activists in Eastern Europe. He has a good knowledge of Czech and
is Havel's personal friend.
   His property in Austria comprises farm and forestland and a
sprawling palace, including a first-class hotel, in downtown Vienna.
   After World War II, the huge landed property in Czechoslovakia
of the Schwarzenbergs was impounded by the state and the family had
to leave, as did other nobility with estates in Czechoslovakia.

<HEAD>Ruskin Spear Dead, Realistic Portrait Painter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Ruskin Spear, who painted realistic and often
satirical portraits of famous Britons, died after a short illness,
his son said Wednesday. He was 78.
   Roger Spear said his father died Tuesday at his home in British
Grove, Hammersmith, the west London district by the Thames River.
   The artist was born there and continually painted its people,
street life and pubs in the manner of the Edwardian Walter Sickert,
whose depictions of Camden Town in north London were the main
influence in Spear's art.
   Spear was much liked for the humor of his often rough and
striking pictures.
   Groups would gather round his works at the Royal Academy of Arts
summer exhibition where Spear could be relied upon to produce an
amusing portrait, sometimes uncommissioned.
   Margaret Thatcher exclaimed: ``It's terrible. Let's get away
from it as fast as we can,'' when she saw Spear's portrait of her
called ``True Blue'' before she became Prime Minister in 1979.
   Sir Winston Churchill said to him, ``Go away, you horrible
man,'' after seeing his portrait by Spear.
   His commissioned portraits included actor Laurence Olivier as
Macbeth, Archbishop of Canterbury Michael Ramsey and Tory
politician R.A. Butler.
   When not in his studio, Spear was usually to be found in a
Hammersmith pub. He once listed his recreations as painting,
breathing and drinking.
   He taught at the Royal College of Art from 1952 to 1977 when a
new generation of painters emerged, including David Hockney and
Peter Blake.
   Spear had polio as a child and suffered from Parkinson's disease
but he painted until the last weeks of his life.

   Maverick Christian leader Gen. Michel
Aoun on Wednesday ordered a newspaper closed for a week and the
editor was subpoenaed after the paper continued to refer to
President Elias Hrawi as head of state.
   ``From now on, critical tongues shall be cut off,'' Aoun told
the daily crowd of cheering supporters outside his underground
bunker of the presidential palace in Christian east Beirut.
   Other broadcast and print media have halted operations in
protest of a directive Aoun issued a day earlier that prohibits the
Lebanese media from referring to Hrawi as president and to Salim
Hoss as prime minister.
   Hrawi and Hoss have been in office since November under an Arab
League-backed peace plan that Aoun opposes. Aoun and Hrawi are
Christians, and Hoss is a Sunni Moslem.
   Police ringed the offices of the conservative newspaper Ad-Diyar
in east Beirut's Hazmiyeh district and enforced the weeklong
suspension order of George Ghanem, the prosecutor general, an
official statement said.
   The police withdrew after serving a subpoena to Ad-Diyar's
editor Charles Ayoub.
   The action came after the paper published a front-page editorial
in which Ayoub said following Aoun's instructions would mean
``suffocation. ... We do not want to divorce our freedom, betray
our pen and desert our office.''
   Ayoub's article was broadcast repeatedly by Moslem radio
stations in Moslem west Beirut.
   Ghanem said he has started legal proceedings against Ayoub on a
charge of ``infringement on national sovereignty,'' which is
punishable by up to five years in prison under Lebanon's penal code.
   The statement mentioned no date for the trial. But Ayoub told
The Associated Press he was subpoenaed to appear before a military
examining magistrate within 48 hours.
   ``We have not been subjected to any inconvenience or harassment
by the police but we are not going to appear tomorrow,'' Ayoub said.
   Edmond Rizk, information and justice minister in Hrawi's
government, went on the government-run Channel 7 television station
in west Beirut and ordered judicial authorities not to enforce
Ad-Diyar's suspension. He called Aoun an imposter.
   Two radio stations _ Voice of Lebanon of the rightist Phalange
Party and Voice of Free Lebanon of the Christian Lebanese forces
militia _ maintained a newscast strike for a second day to protest
Aoun's orders.
   In addition to Ad-Diyar, four other daily papers publish in the
Christian enclave and six in Beirut's Moslem sector.
   The conservative Al-Anwar newspaper, based in the Christian
suburb of Hazmiyeh near Aoun's headquarters, followed the general's
instructions. The others in the enclave also obeyed the order.
   The nation's most prestigious newspaper, An-Nahar, protested
Aoun's order by not publishing a Wednesday edition even though it
is based in west Beirut.
   ``These new circumstances restrict us from publishing freely. .
.. We will not publish again until these conditions change,'' said
editor Francois Aql.
   The struggle for control of the media reflected a growing split
within Christian ranks over the peace plan to end the
Moslem-Christian civil war, which has killed more than 150,000
people.
   Lebanon's press has maintained its reputation as the freest in
the Arab world despite 14 years of civil war. All political groups
have been unfettered in expressing their opinions in print.
   Hoss issued a statement Wednesday saying, ``The freedom of the
press is sacred in Lebanon.'' He said Aoun ``poses a threat to the
Lebanese homeland.''
   Aoun's 20,000 troops control the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave, which includes Beirut's eastern sector and a narrow strip
northeast of the capital.
   After he was elected president by Parliament, Hrawi dismissed
Aoun as prime minister and army commander. But the recalcitrant
general has held out in the Christian enclave and refused to leave
the presidential palace.
   Aoun, who was appointed by former President Amin Gemayel as head
of an interim military Cabinet Sept. 22, 1988, has declared the
nation's one-chamber house dissolved to prevent the election of a
new head of state while the Syrian army polices Lebanon.
   Aoun's opponents said his decision was unconstitutional, noting
that only a president has the right to dissolve the legislature.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Two Counts Against State Senator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Wednesday threw out
two corruption counts against state Sen. Joseph Montoya, saying the
bribery charges failed to meet a $5,000 threshhold required for
federal prosecution.
   U.S. District Judge Milton Schwartz also said the charges
covered executive department employees under another statute, but
not state legislators.
   Montoya, chairman of the Business and Professions Committee, is
the first lawmaker indicted in a four-year FBI ``sting'' of the
state Capitol in which agents posed as businessmen and dispensed
cash for political favors.
   In a ruling last week, Schwartz upheld 10 other counts, covering
extortion, racketeering and money laundering allegations, but put
off a decision on the bribery charges.
   The two counts stem from Montoya's videotaped acceptance of a
$3,000 check from an undercover FBI agent, and a $500 contribution
from a group of independent oil and natural gas producers.
   Schwartz said Wednesday that contending that the $5,000
threshhold had been reached, ``stretches the language (of the law)
beyond a sensible reading.''
   Montoya, 50, took the stand for the first time Tuesday, and was
cross-examined by prosecutors Wednesday. He has denied he demanded
money in return for votes or political favors.
   ``I never made that suggestion in any fashion, shape or form,''
the Democrat said when asked by defense attorney Michael Sands if
he had ever implied that he would drop a bill opposed by the
National Football League Players Association in exchange for
financial support.
   However, Montoya acknowledged he benefitted personally from some
campaign fund expenditures, including videotapes and investment
newsletters.
   He insisted that nearly all the expenditures were motivated
primarily by legislative reasons. ``Politics never leave my
personal life and my personal life never leaves politics,'' he said.
   Prosecutors claim the legislator from the district east of Los
Angeles put his vote and political influence up for sale in an
attempt to become wealthy.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Panneton questioned how the
lawmaker spent his campaign funds, and at one point recited the
oath of office in which Montoya promised to uphold the law.
   It is illegal for state senators to spend campaign funds for
personal use.
   Montoya acknowleged that among his campaign fund expenditures
were $4,300 he spent for clothing.
   He also spent $20,000 in campaign funds to help pass Proposition
73, one of two campaign reform measures passed by California voters
in June 1988. Among its provisions are restrictions on campaign
contributions and honorariums.
   Montoya said he regarded the $3,000 check from the undercover
agent as a legal honorarium for going to breakfast with undercover
agent George Murray and Senate staffer John Shahabian, who was
acting as an FBI operative in federal agents' 3{-year undercover
probe of alleged Capitol corruption.

<TEXT>
   A man accused of trying to hijack an
America West airliner to Cuba said Wednesday he was ``guilty as
charged'' and apologized for what he said was an act of desperation
to escape death threats.
   Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Gonzalez, 39, of New Orleans, was charged
with aircraft piracy and assaulting a flight attendant during
Tuesday's 10:45 p.m. flight from Houston to Las Vegas.
   Passengers said Gonzalez-Gonzalez grabbed flight attendant Stacy
Wood, 26, announced he had a bomb and demanded to go to his native
Cuba.
   He was apprehended at Austin's Robert Mueller Municipal Airport
by a police officer who climbed up an emergency chute and
overpowered him.
   No bomb was discovered, but a device made of a toothpaste
container and a ``flashlight-type article'' was found, said FBI
agent Michael Wilson.
   `The facts speak for themselves. I'm guilty as charged,''
Gonzalez-Gonzalez told U.S. Magistrate Stephen Capelle at his
arraignment. ``My intention was to leave this country. I was being
chased with constant threat of being murdered.''
   Gonzalez-Gonzalez said others wanted to silence him for things
he knew, but did not elaborate. He also said he wanted to apologize
to Ms. Wood and the other passengers on Flight 727.
   ``They were never in any danger,'' he said. ``I took this course
out of desperation.''
   He also praised Ms. Wood, saying, ``She fought bravely.''
   If convicted of air piracy, Gonzalez-Gonalez faces 20 years to
life in prison. The assault charge carries a maximum 10-year prison
term, said FBI agent James Echols.
   Gonzalez-Gonzalez said he boarded the plane with $1,100, which
he tossed away in the airplane. He said he didn't think he would
need the money.
   Byron Sage, supervisor of the FBI office in Austin, said he
didn't know how much of the money was recovered. He said
Gonzalez-Gonzalez has been previously arrested for public
intoxication, solicitation of a prostitute and drug possession in
Louisiana.
   Gonzalez-Gonzalez, who said he had ``been on the run'' for three
weeks from New Orleans, asked to be tried outside of Texas. He said
he didn't want to return to Louisiana and wanted to be tried in
Washington, D.C.
   The magistrate said that issue would be determined later. He
ordered Gonzalez-Gonzalez held until another hearing Jan. 25.
   Gonzalez-Gonzalez said he came to the United States when he was
11 years old. He said he was not a U.S. citizen.
   Crew members and passengers said Gonzalez-Gonzalez appeared
agitated before and during the flight of the Boeing 737, which the
airline said was carrying 34 passengers and a five-member flight
crew.
   ``Our people on the ground at the ticket counter did ask him if
he was OK,'' said America West spokesman Dik Shimizu. ``He replied
basically saying he did not fly often, and he was nervous, and he
also had an ill relative.''
   ``We do not feel by any means that they made a mistake. We are
looking at it. They made a decision based on the information they
had to work with. Obviously hindsight is always 20-20,'' said
Shimizu.
   Robert Martin, 24, of Fontana, Calif., said Gonzalez-Gonzalez
sat two rows in front of him on the plane and talked loudly,
complaining about American television programs.
   After Gonzalez-Gonzalez grabbed the flight attendant, pilot Dick
Nelson told him that they had to land at Austin to refuel. Once on
the ground, the passengers and three crew members escaped through
an emergency chute.
   Police Capt. Lloyd Polk went up an emergency chute and wrestled
with Gonzalez-Gonzalez.
   ``I saw he had the stewardess so I took action immediately,''
Polk said early Wednesday.
   Gonzalez-Gonzalez, Ms. Wood and another flight attendant were
treated for minor injuries.

   Life in a quiet, residential section of the city
isn't the same since a nocturnal intruder snatched four sleeping
girls from their homes.
   Officers patrol on foot, homeowners use security systems even
when they're home and parents and school officials grapple with
protecting children without traumatizing them.
   Since September, four sleeping girls have been taken from their
north Dallas homes in the middle of night. A man sexually assaulted
three of them, police say.
   Police say they believe the assailant has been spotted twice
more, prowling outside girls' bedroom windows before being scared
off by passers-by.
   The latest episode occurred a week ago, when an intruder carried
an 8-year-old girl from her bedroom but dropped her outside the
house, unharmed, after she screamed.
   Some neighborhood men have quit taking evening walks for fear
people will suspect them. Other residents worry that someone will
get shot accidentally as tensions rise.
   Some parents tell of changing the pink drapes in their
daughters' rooms to white to avoid tipping someone to the location
of girls' rooms.
   ``The parents are really struggling with how to protect their
children and at the same time keep from instilling fears in their
children so that they can't sleep at night,'' said Lori
Messerschmidt, who has coordinated counseling for families in the
neighborhoods where the attacks occurred.
   More than 500 parents from the middle- to upper-class
neighborhoods came to meetings Tuesday at two schools to talk about
the attacks with school officials and police.
   In the exclusive Bent Tree West development where the latest
attack occurred, the homeowners' association passed out fliers
asking parents to take safety precautions: locking doors, watching
their children, using security systems even when they're at home.
   ``Our neighborhood knows each other, that's why it was so
shocking,'' said Jane Hood, who lives in the development. ``But I
think everybody on our street is remembering to lock their doors.''
   Police said Wednesday they have no solid leads in the attacks.
The victims, all elementary school-age girls, haven't been able to
give good descriptions, although all say the attacker was a white
man with dark hair, police said.
   Investigators say some of the victims have been in heavily
secured homes, complete with elaborate alarm systems and fences.
But in at least the last attack, an unlocked patio door provided
the intruder an easy way in.
   In each case, a man has taken the children just outside the
house and assaulted or tried to assault them there, never taking
them far.
   ``It's a daring offense,'' said Deputy Police Chief Grant Lappin.
   Police are talking to crime watch groups and at schools to make
sure parents and children protect themselves. They've set up
special surveillance units and a task force to work on nothing but
the child snatchings.
   Officers patrol the areas on foot day and night and have woken
up several residents in the middle of the night to tell them to
lock their doors, Lappin said.
   ``It's our belief that, despite the publicity, that there are
still some people in the area that are not aware of what is
happening,'' said police spokesman Ed Spencer. ``Some officers up
there on foot patrol on Sunday observed quite a few unlocked garage
doors.'
   While parents want their children to be aware, they worry about
traumatizing them.
   ``You have to choose your words carefully,' said Meg Sherard.
``I have a 10-year-old daughter, and you have to be careful that
you don't get the children so paranoid that they think someone's
going to break into the house and take them.
   ``So I've maintained a low-key approach, but I pick them (from
school) and I don't let them outside in the front yard,'' she said.
``And if they're in the back, fenced in, I'm always in a place
where I can see them.''

<HEAD>Legislative Assistant to Thornburgh Resigns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top legislative aide to Attorney general
Dick Thornburgh said Wednesday night she is resigning because she
considers herself unsuited to be the Justice Department's
spokeswoman on Capitol Hill.
   Assistant Attorney General Carol Crawford, blamed privately by
department officials and legislative aides for an abrasive style
that has hurt Thornburgh on Capitol Hill, said she told the
attorney general last week of her plans to leave on Feb. 1.
   ``There is no eloquent way of saying this, This is not the right
job for me,'' Ms. Crawford said in a telephoen interview. ``The
functions of this position are not really functions that I enjoy or
I am particularly well suited for.''
   Aides to members of Congress, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, have said Ms. Crawford has alienated lawmakers by
refusing requests for information and taking a confrontational
stance on a number of issues.
   One Democratic aide said Ms. Crawford antagonized House
Appropriations Committee members by suggesting cuts in other
departments, notably at the Commerce Department, so that the funds
could be allocated to the Justice Department.
   ``She was still wearing her OMB hat,'' said the aide, referring
to Ms. Crawford's previous position as associate director at the
Office of Management and Budget, a post she held for 3{ years.
   The Office of Legislative Affairs was also faulted for refusing
to honor the Appropriations Committee's request that the FBI delay
plans to scale back field offices in Butte, Mont. and Savannah, Ga.
   The department had customarily deferred to the committee's
objections to reprogramming money during a fiscal year.
   But Ms. Crawford informed Congress last June that the two FBI
offices would be scaled back despite objections from lawmakers.
   The decision prompted Congress to attach a rider to a
supplemental appropriations bill that prohibited further
reorganization at the Justice Department until the end of the 1989
fiscal year.
   The measure delayed until recently Thornburgh's plan to merge 14
organized crime strike forces into U.S. attorneys offices.
   Ms. Crawford expressd surprise that she was criticized for being
antagonistic. ``One of the functions of the person in ths position
is to deny members of Congress or staff information that they are
not permitted to have,'' she said.
   ``I can't think of anybody I've had unpleasant relations with,''
she said, but noted that ``there is a natural tension between the
Justice Departmen an the Conress.''
   ``I am mostly a mouthpiece,'' she said. ``If they don't like
something you are saying, they are going to blame you.'' But she
said she had tried ``to improve relations with Congress.''
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said Ms. Crawford
``brought on some talented people.''
   ``The office appears to be functioning well,'' said Runkel, who
declined to comment on criticism of Ms. Crawford's performance.
   Ms. Crawford said her decision was not prompted by any pressure
from Thornburgh and she has no immediate plans for another job.

   NASA discouraged people
Wednesday from trying to watch Friday's pre-dawn landing of the
space shuttle Columbia after flooding from recent storms closed the
public viewing area.
   ``It's going to be cold, it's going to be dark and you won't see
a thing'' when Columbia touches down at 2:55 a.m. Friday, said
spokeswoman Nancy Lovato of the National Aeronautic and Space
Administration.
   ``I would sure advise people who want to see a shuttle landing
to wait for a daylight landing.''
   Recent storms dumped heavy rain and snow on Southern California,
leaving standing water and mud on parts of Rogers Dry Lake,
including the east shore where up to 500,000 spectators have
gathered on the normally hard-packed clay to watch shuttles land,
Lovato said.
   ``The dirt roads are impassable,'' she said. ``The Air Force
decided to shut that site down.''
   People may go to the so-called hillside site near NASA's
facilities on this Mojave Desert military base, but Lovato said the
site is 6 miles from concrete Runway 22, where the shuttle will
land. At the very best, spectators will briefly see the shuttle as
it hurtles past the runway lights; shuttles lack running lights, so
Columbia will not be visible as it approaches.
   Columbia's landing will end a 10-day mission during which the
shuttle's crew launched a Navy communications satellite and
retrieved an 11-ton science satellite for return to Earth.
   Friday's landing will be only the second time a shuttle has set
down in complete darkness. It also will be the heaviest shuttle
ever to land.
   A National Weather Service snow advisory was in effect Wednesday
for portions of Southern California above 2,000 feet, including
Edwards Air Force Base. But forecasters said the latest storm would
leave the region Thursday.
   Lovato said the forecast for Columbia's landing time calls for
mostly clear skies, with very light winds, and possibly some
scattered clouds at 5,000 feet and broken clouds at 8,000 feet.
Temperatures were expected to be below freezing.
   Another storm front is expected Friday afternoon or Saturday,
Lovato said.

<HEAD>Iraq Says Ready to Open Air Links and Borders With Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Preparations have been completed for
starting daily flights to Tehran and opening the land borders with
Iran for visits by Moslem pilgrims, the government said Wednesday.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted an unidentified Iraqi
Airways official as saying four jumbo jets were ready to leave for
Tehran to transport as many as 1,500 Iranian pilgrims daily to Iraq
as soon as Iran agreed.
   Interior Minister Samir Mohammed Abdel-Wahab said in an
interview with the magazine Alef Ba that the decision for the air
and land links was based on a proposal by President Saddam Hussein
last month.
   Saddam proposed new direct talks to revive the stalled peace
negotiations with Iran, Iraq's foe in an eight-year war that halted
with a cease-fire in August 1988. Saddam also proposed an exchange
of prisoners of war, the opening of air links between Baghdad and
Tehran and visits by pilgrims to religious sites in both countries.
   Tehran, which insists on talks under United Nations auspices,
called the proposal a ``deception,'' and said it fell short for not
calling for an Iraqi troop withdrawal from Iranian territory
captured during the Iran-Iraq war.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Cyprus, said Iranian Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati addressed a conference of Iraqi opposition
groups Wednesday. The conference closed with a resolution pledging
to overthrow Saddam's government, it said.
   Also Wednesday, 50 sick and disabled Iraqi POWs released by Iran
arrived in Baghdad aboard a plane chartered by the International
Red Cross.
   Akram al-Witri, a Foreign Ministry legal adviser, said Iraq
would reciprocate by releasing 20 Iranian sick and disabled
prisoners on Thursday.
   There was no explanation why Iraq would not release an equal
number of prisoners.
   The Red Cross has registered some 50,000 prisoners held by Iran
and more than 19,200 by Iraq. But United Nations officials and
diplomats estimate the two sides hold about 100,000 POWs between
them.
   The Red Cross secured an agreement to repatriate ailing
prisoners immediately after a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire halted the
Persian Gulf war on Aug. 20, 1988.
   But the deal collapsed after the exchange of only 400 disabled
and wounded prisoners with both sides accusing each other of
falsifying the number of captives seeking asylum.
   U.N.-sponsored peace talks launched a few days after the
cease-fire have been deadlocked mainly over the troop withdrawal
issue and Iraq's demand for the demarcation of the border to give
it sovereignty over the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, its main outlet to
the sea.

   Three helicopters carrying more than
100 U.S. troops landed in Costa Rica this week, apparently after
becoming lost while trying to find a western Panamanian town,
public security ministry officials said.
   Ministry spokesman Carlos Jimenez said the soldiers who landed
Monday night told civil guardsmen they were trying to reach El
Progreso, a Panamanian town about two miles from the Costa Rican
border, where they had been told troops loyal to deposed Panamanian
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega were hiding.
   They apologized and left when told they were in Costa Rica, he
said.
   Residents said other helicopters overflew the area.
   Iria Herrera Arguedas said she yelled at eight soldiers
approaching her house not to hurt her children.
   An American soldier speaking Spanish told her they were lost and
not to be afraid, she said.
   She said the soldiers stayed about 25 minutes and left after
civil guards told them where El Progreso was.

<HEAD>U.S. Official Called Mexican Attorney General Over `Drug Wars'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. government was so concerned about
reaction to NBC-TV's ``Drug Wars'' miniseries that a top Justice
Department official called Mexico's attorney general the day after
the first episode aired, the attorney general said Wednesday.
   ``He asked me how I was taking it,'' Enrique Alvarez del
Castillo told reporters. Laughing, the attorney general said he had
replied with a Mexican profanity and added that he had appreciated
the gesture.
   The miniseries based on the death of Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Enrique Camarena in 1985 was broadcast Jan. 7,
8 and 9; it caused a controversy in Mexico because of its graphic
portrayal of corruption in the Mexican legal system.
   Mexican officials thought it would deal a blow to President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari's efforts to change Mexico's image, while
U.S. officials feared Mexican anger and hurt pride would inhibit
relations, especially in the fight against drug trafficking.
   Officials of both nations have insisted that is not happening
and U.S. officials have praised the Salinas' administration efforts
to fight drug trafficking and corruption. Mexican officials are
quick to point out that 36 tons of cocaine has been seized since
Salinas took office 13 months ago, more than was seized the
preceding 10 years combined.
   Drug kingpins Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo
were sentenced in December to 40 years in prison without parole for
the Camarena killing.
   Alvarez, who was governor of Jalisco when Camarena was kidnapped
in the state capital Guadalajara, said he found the miniseries'
portrayal of Mexican justice ``irritating'' but emphasized that it
had not affected relations and that the governments were keeping
things on an even keel.
   As an example of the close U.S.-Mexico relationship under
Salinas and Bush, Alvarez said he had received a sympathetic
telephone call he received from a top U.S. drug enforcement
official on behalf of U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh.
   The call came after the first episode of ``Drug Wars'' was
broadcast in the United States and on Mexico City's cable system,
Alvarez said.
   At a news conference, Alvarez said the government is
``interested'' in press reports that allege Camarena was involved
in drug trafficking himself, but that it is not reopening the
Camarena investigation.
   U.S. officials have indignantly denied the reports, which
originated with a dispatch by the government news service Notimex.
   On Tuesday, Alvarez had said there was no independent
corroboration of the allegations, which were repeated on a Mexican
television program that purported to point out ``falsehoods''
broadcast by NBC.
   Alvarez noted 26 others were convicted with Caro Quintero and
Fonseca and said he did not expect any more indictments.
   At another news conference, members of a U.S. congressional
delegation minimized the impact of the NBC miniseries.
   ``It was just like a soap opera, like `Lonesome Dove,' `Dynasty'
or `Dallas' and that's how people will regard it,'' said Kika de la
Garza, D-Texas, who represents a border district.
   But Rep. Ronald D. Coleman, D-Fla., said the program properly
did not gloss over problems within Mexico's law-enforcement
establishment.
   ``For us to forget that you have bad guys here just like we have
bad guys in the United States does a disservice to the many
Mexicans who have lost their lives fighting the drug problem and a
disservice to the Americans who have also lost their lives,''
Coleman said.
   ``It over-dramatized it, it stretched the truth. But the kernels
of truth were there. All of those people are real people and we
can't forget that,'' Coleman added.

<HEAD>UN Chief Writes Ethiopian President on Relief Deliveries</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
has written to Ethiopia's president, stressing the need to work out
arrangements so relief deliveries can begin soon to northern
Ethiopia, a spokeswoman said Wednesday.
   She said the letter will be delivered personally to Marxist
President Mengistu Haile Mariam by a representative of the
secretary-general.
   Some relief agencies estimate 5 million Ethiopians could face
starvation this year, most of them in rebel-controlled areas in the
north.
   The region was hit by drought last year.
   Rebels in Eritrea and Tigre provinces have fought the government
in Addis Ababa for years, seeking autonomy. The insurgencies also
have disrupted supply lines intended to carry relief aid into Wolla.
   A U.S. congressional staff member, speaking in a telephone
interview from Washington, said the rebels have agreed in principle
to a plan that would let food and medical supplies move through
government-controlled ports and cities, and into the areas where
conditions are expected to be the most dire.
   He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In 1984 and 1985, up to a million people died of starvation in
Tigre and Eritrea; in 1987 and 1988, a huge international relief
operation prevented a similar tragedy during another crop failure.
   Reps. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, and Bill Emerson, R-Mo., both members
of the House Select Committee on Hunger, are leading an effort by
U.S. lawmakers to get the Ethiopian government to approve a
delivery plan.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Agency for International Development,
the foreign aid branch of the State Department, said its office in
Addis Ababa estimates 750,000 metric tons of emergency food are
needed for 1990.
   Most of the food supplies sought by relief agencies are on hand
or have been pledged, said John Riddle, the AID press officer for
Egypt and Africa.
   Riddle said, ``It looks like in terms of what's pledged there is
no shortage of food. Working out an agreement for delivery is the
critical element left to be resolved.
   ``These things are always a problem when you're trying to get
three warring parties to agree on anything.''

   Convicted Colombian cocaine kingpin Carlos
Lehder said in an interview televised Wednesday that he and
associates paid deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega several
million dollars for protection.
   ``I would not be able to go into exact details as to the extent
of that protection ... because this would not be in my best
interest,'' Lehder said in the interview conducted for the West
German magazine Stern.
   A videotape of the interview _ conducted in November at the
federal prison in Marion, Ill., but not yet published _ was
broadcast by NBC News.
   Lehder said that for about 10 years, Noriega would take all
drugs and drug paraphernalia seized in Panama and sell it to drug
dealers in Colombia, Panama and the United States.
   Lehder was extradited to the United States in 1987 and is
serving a sentence of life in prison plus 135 years. He was charged
with running a large cocaine smuggling operation on a small island
in the Bahamas.
   In the interview, Lehder praised Lyndon Pindling, prime minister
of the Bahamas, as a marvelous, honest leader. Pindling has long
denied allegations of drug corruption involving Lehder, and Lehder
refused to comment on the relationship.
   ``It is possible that I knew the prime minister,'' he said.
``However, whether he was involved or not is an answer that he
himself must give, not me.''
   Noriega faces a February 1988 indictment in Miami of using
Panama to protect cocaine shipments heading north and
drug-processing chemicals and drug money headed south. He was
arrested Jan. 3 following the U.S. invasion.

   Four opposition activists were
arrested for ``aggression, offenses and lack of respect'' regarding
President Daniel Ortega as he was leaving a Sandinista rally, the
Interior Ministry said Wednesday.
   An opposition candidate said police used tear gas Tuesday night
to break up the demonstration in Granada, Nicaragua's second
largest city, 28 miles southeast of Managua.
   Luis Sanchez Sancho, a spokesman for the United National
Opposition coalition, accused police of attacking a small rally the
coalition was holding, but conceded they had no permission to stage
it.
   Julia Mena, 36, UNO candidate for National Assembly deputy for
Region 4, said about 1,000 supporters had gathered for the rally on
a street about three blocks from the hotel where Ortega was to dine.
   At about 6 p.m., riot police arrived and ordered the crowd to
disperse, but stayed about a half-block away, she said.
   She said police then threw tear gas canisters to break up the
gathering. People dispersed and police withdrew at about 6:30 p.m.,
she said.
   ``Later I found out there were some people arrested,'' she said.
   The government identified those arrested as Pedro Rafael Guzman,
Roger Rafael Rocha, Alberto Jose Roman and Pablo Valencia Mora.
   The ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front and UNO are the
main contenders in general elections scheduled for Feb. 25.
   Ortega is running for re-election against UNO presidential
candidate Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, publisher of the only
opposition newspaper, La Prensa.
   An Interior Ministry communique said Ortega was leaving the
Sandinista rally for a dinner at a hotel about six blocks away when
UNO sympathizers started the disturbance.
   ``The Sandinista police exhausted its persuasive resources in
order to make them desist from their aggressive attitude, without
result,'' it said.
   Police were ``forced to proceed with energy to dissolve the
provocateurs and detain the main instigators.''
   Diplomatic sources who witnessed the incident blamed UNO. They
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``Although it's hard in such instances to say precisely who
started it, it was mostly a provocation by UNO,'' one said.
   It was the first report of violence at a political gathering
since a UNO march on Dec. 10 turned into a riot between Sandinista
and UNO activists in Masatepe, a small town south of Managua.
   That riot led to eight political parties signing a code of
conduct on Dec. 15 that calls on party activists to respect
political foes and avoid violence.
   UNO did not sign. UNO spokesman Danilo Lacayo said Wednesday the
bloc refused to sign the pact because Sandinistas continue to
intimidate opposition activists.
   In Washington, two groups _ one Republican, one Democratic _
which use U.S. government funds to promote democracy overseas said
the Sandinista government may be intentionally blocking creation of
programs to educate Nicaragua's voters about democracy before the
elections.
   Presidents J. Brian Atwood of the National Democratic Institute
and Keith Schuette of the National Republican Institute wrote to
Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Tinoco saying Nicaragua put up
bureaucratic roadblocks to their efforts.

<HEAD>Jurors Deadlocked on 13 Charges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors who have reached verdicts on 52 counts
in the McMartin preschool molestation case said Wednesday they are
deadlocked on the remaining 13 charges in the nation's longest,
costliest criminal trial.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders received a note from the
jurors as they ended their day's deliberation and called a hearing
for Thursday to discuss the deadlock and possibly opening the 52
sealed verdicts.
   In an interview Wednesday evening, Pounders said he would deal
with the deadlocked counts first, either declaring a mistrial on
those counts and reading the sealed verdicts, or sending the jury
back to resume deliberations on the undecided counts.
   He said the verdicts could also be read before sending the jury
back. However, the judge noted that ``The attorneys are hopeful all
the counts will be resolved before we take any verdicts.''
   Pounders said he would discuss the matter with attorneys before
quizzing jurors on whether they want to deliberate further.
   The jurors are deciding whether Raymond Buckey, 31, and his
mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, are guilty or innocent of
charges they molested children at their family-owned McMartin
Pre-School in Manhattan Beach.
   The jury that spent 2{ years hearing evidence in the case have
agreed on 52 verdicts. They have all been sealed. None of the
verdicts is official until it is announced in court and affirmed by
the jury.
   Jurors are in their ninth week of deliberations. Buckey and his
mother are charged with 64 counts of child molestation and the one
shared count of conspiracy.
   One of the charges which apparently has divided the jurors is
the conspiracy charge which names both defendants.
   Jurors asked twice for an explanation of how they could convict
one defendant and acquit the other on that joint charge, but seemed
perplexed after they received an explanation earlier Wednesday.
   After conferring with lawyers, Pounders told jurors they could
convict just one of the defendants on the charge ``if you feel that
the defendant conspired with one or more other persons.''
   However, he noted the conspiracy count includes eight alleged
overt acts, some of them naming only one defendant. A split
verdict, he said, would require elimination of overt acts alleged
against a defendant acquitted of the charge.
   It was at that point, he said, that some jurors began shaking
their heads in confusion.
   Buckey and his mother were the only defendants required to stand
trial after an 18-month preliminary hearing. Five women teachers
who worked at the McMartin Pre-School had charges against them
dismissed. Among those were Buckey's sister, Peggy Ann, and his
grandmother, Virginia McMartin, who founded the prestigious but now
defunct nursery school.
   On Tuesday, deliberations were halted at midday because a juror
became ill. On Wednesday, the talks did not begin until 1 p.m.
because another juror's child was ill.
   No alternates remain in the case and the judge has worried that
losing one of the 12 remaining jurors would force a mistrial.

   Government leaders Wednesday said a reduction
in U.S. aid could harden Israel's stance in efforts to arrange
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
   They also said said a drop in funding from Washington could
seriously hamper efforts to absorb a wave of Soviet immigrants
expected to reach as many as 100,000 people this year.
   The comments came in response to a statement Tuesday by the
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, who said a 5 percent cut to big
aid recipients such as Israel could free up money to support
democracy efforts in Poland and Eastern Europe.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the idea was
``well worth looking at,'' triggering concern in Israel.
   The Jewish state receives $3 billion a year in military and
civilian assistance from the United States, making it the largest
American aid recipient.
   Vice Premier Shimon Peres, head of the left-of-center Labor
Party, responded indignantly to Dole's remarks, noting Israel
spends nearly a quarter of its budget on defense.
   ``There is totally no justification to deal a blow to us instead
of just dividing it up a little bit with the Europeans,'' Peres
told economists in Jerusalem. He called Dole's comments ``a very
worrisome declaration.''
   Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron said he, too, was worried
over the idea of reduced U.S. aid.
   ``We and the United States enjoy strategic cooperation based on
the assumption that a strong Israel is a cause of stability in the
Middle East. As long as this is the basis, I hope very much that
the United States would not cut its military and economic aid,''
Shomron said on Israel Television.
   Other leaders said the talk of cutting aid seemed to be an
attempt to persuade right-wing Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to
bend on his refusal to involve the PLO in peace talks. The issue
has long delayed progress on Middle East peace efforts.
   ``I have no doubt that the remarks (by Dole) are serious and ...
that if there will be no political progress, then this mood could
yield tough consequences,'' such as aid cuts, Communications
Minister Gad Yaacobi of Labor said.
   But he said such a move would be a mistake.
   ``By past experience, we know that Israel's reaction to such
steps is a hardening of its positions,'' he said. ``I am worried
this will be counterproductive.''
   Israel often digs in its heels in response to outside threats,
including criticism from allies such as the United States.
   ``We understand the new needs of the U.S. in East European
countries, the new developments, but these developments also affect
us,'' Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Parliament.
   Finance officials noted that inflation has eroded U.S. aid by
about 40 percent in the last decade and that much of a $1.8 billion
package in civilian aid was going toward debt repayment to the
United States.
   ``Any major cut in aid is going to create a very tough situation
for us because we are already pushing our budget to the limit,''
said David Naveh, director of the Finance Ministry's International
Division and Investment Authority.
   Netanyahu also told reporters: ``A strong Israel is a secure
Israel and one that is more able to progress along the course of
peace. This is something I think is in the interest of American
policy as well, and I would hope very much that all sides of the
equation be taken into account.''
   Netanyahu noted that less U.S. aid could hurt efforts to house,
feed and make jobs for thousands of new Soviet immigrants. Hundreds
of newcomers have been arriving on a daily basis.
   ``We understand the new needs of the U.S.in East European
countries, the new developments, but these developments also affect
us,'' Netanyahu said. ``It's a very difficult time. We have a great
migration and defense needs.''
   The government is trying to raise $1 billion immediately for the
immigrants, hoping the United States will provide about half the
sum and the rest will come from American and European Jewry.

   A federal judge on Wednesday scheduled Manuel
Noriega's drug trafficking trial to begin in early March after
attorneys for the deposed dictator's co-defendants demanded a
speedy trial.
   But U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler noted that the trial
on charges brought in a February 1988 indictment in Miami would be
complex, and expressed strong doubts it would actually start that
soon.
   The trial date was set shortly after Noriega issued a statement
denying prosecution claims that one of his co-defendants, Luis del
Cid, headed Panama's intelligence agency or served as his
right-hand man.
   Hoeveler set the trial for the week of March 5 after he
continued the bond hearing for del Cid to give his defense more
time to respond to new allegations by prosecutors.
   ``We will set the date for that week,'' Hoeveler said, ``but of
course, there will be further motions and we will just have to see
what will happen.''
   Del Cid's attorney, Samuel Burstyn, reminded the judge that he
has yet to rule on motions calling for separate trials for del Cid
and several other co-defendants.
   Outside the courtroom, Noriega attorneys Steven Kollin and Frank
Rubino, refused to comment when asked whether they would be ready
to conduct their client's defense in court by the first week in
March.
   ``Sam wants to try his case,'' was Rubino's only comment.
   Del Cid, 46, has pleaded innocent to charges of collecting bribe
money and acting as a liaison between Noriega and drug traffickers
who allegedly used Panama as a conduit for drug shipments to the
United States. He faces 70 years in prison and $550,000 in fines if
convicted on all counts.
   Also Wednesday, another Panamanian co-defendant named along with
Noriega in a federal indictment in Tampa surrendered to FBI agents
in Panama and was extradited to the United States.
   Enrique Pretelt, 47, charged with trying to smuggle more than 1
million pounds of marijuana to the United States, was being held in
Florida on Wednesday night and was scheduled to make an apperance
in a Tampa courtroom Thursday, said Justice Department spokesman
Michael W. Robinson in Washington.
   During Wednesday's bond hearing in Miami, Burstyn read Noriega's
statement on del Cid, who surrendered and was taken into custody on
drug charges after the U.S. invasion of Panama last month.
   Burstyn said prosecutors, who have called del Cid ``one of
Noriega's right-hand men,'' were using his supposed status as an
intelligence director to argue he should not be given bond.
   Burstyn told the judge that prosecutors had erred, and pulled
out Noriega's statement.
   ``At no time was Lt. Col. del Cid the head of G-2 or
intelligence. At no time was he my personal secretary or attache,''
the document read in part.
   Previously, Burstyn has pointed to what he calls discrepancies
in the February 1988 indictment against Noriega and del Cid, saying
they undercut the reliability of the witnesses responsible for much
of the evidence considered by the grand jury.
   Rubino said both he and Kollin were present when the statement
was taken in a courthouse jail cell.
   Later Wednesday, Hoeveler delayed his ruling on del Cid's bond
for a second time, giving defense attorneys 10 days to respond to
evidence raised Tuesday by Assistant U.S. Attorney Myles Malman.
   Hoeveler set no date to recovene the hearing, and del Cid
remained jailed at the federal Metropolitan Correctional center
south of Miami without bond.

   Religious items sold by television evangelists
through the mail or at crusade appearances may be taxed by states
just like any other merchandise, the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday.
   The court said such taxes do not violate religious freedom, and
unanimously upheld lower court rulings that forced the
Louisiana-based Jimmy Swaggart Ministries to pay $183,000 in back
taxes to California.
   ``Now we have the real threat of intrustion of government into
the religious ministry of churches and synagogues,'' Swaggart said
in Baton Rouge, reading from a prepared statement a few hours after
the ruling.
   ``The immediate impact of this decision on Jimmy Swaggart
Ministries will not be disastrous because we have been in this
battle for 10 years and have prepared for the consequences,''
Swaggart said. ``Most churches probably have not prepared for it.''
   Most states tax the proceeds of at least some mail order sales
to their residents, but California and Virginia appear to be the
only states that do not exempt religious organizations.
   Other states searching for additional tax revenues now could
follow California's lead.
   ``California's non-discriminatory sales and use tax law ...
imposes no constitutionally significant burden on (Swaggart's)
religious practices or beliefs,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote
for the court.
   The tax at issue was imposed on the sales of religious books,
tapes and other merchandise sold by Swaggart's organization from
1974 through 1981.
   Swaggart did not challenge California's taxing T-shirts, mugs,
bowls and crown-of-thorns replicas sold by his ministry.
   Mail-order sales from Swaggart's base in Baton Rouge, La., to
California consumers during those years totaled $1.7 million. Sales
of merchandise at California crusades totaled $240,000.
   Swaggart's challenge of the tax had been supported by an array
of religious groups _ from Hare Krishnas to mainline Protestants.
   Lawyers for the National Council of Churches, representing most
Protestant denominations, called the California tax ``a serious
threat ... a tax on the dissemination of religious messages, and
thus a forbidden tax on the exercise of religion.''
   Backing California's authority to impose such a tax were two
organizations not usually allied in court _ the American Civil
Liberties Union and the National Conference of State Legislatures.
   Swaggart's lawyers had relied heavily on a 1943 high court
ruling that overturned the convictions of Jehovah's Witnesses who
violated a city ordinance requiring all people engaged in
door-to-door canvassing to get licenses and pay fees.
   The Jehovah's Witnesses were distributing religious literature,
and the 1943 ruling said, ``This form of religious activity
occupies the same high estate under the First Amendment as do
worship in the churches and preaching from the pulpits.''
   But Wednesday's decision drew a distinction between those fees
and the California tax.
   ``Our concern (in the 1943 ruling) that a flat license tax would
act as a precondition to the free exercise of religious beliefs is
simply not present where a tax applies to all sales and uses of
tangible personal property in the state,'' O'Connor wrote.
   The justices also rejected Swaggart's argument that the tax
fosters a constitutionally impermissible ``excessive entanglement''
between church and state.
   Under a 1967 Supreme Court ruling, mail order businesses are
exempt from a state's taxes if they do no more than ship orders
there. But they can be taxed by that state if they have stores,
outlets or certain other business contacts there.
   The justices, citing a procedural flaw, did not rule on
Swaggart's arguments that the 1967 ruling should shield his
organization from the California tax.
   Swaggart is free to raise that argument if he challenges his
California tax bill for any other year than the eight covered by
Wednesday's ruling.
   In two other unanimous decisions, the court:
   _Ruled that a New Jersey corporation accused by a competitor of
bribing Nigerian government officials to win a contract in that
country may be sued in U.S. courts.
   _Said a Denver union official convicted of embezzling may not be
forced to repay the union from his own pension benefits.

government could not possess the right to live abroad, Hong Kong
government radio said.
   A top Chinese official also announced that Hong Kong civil
servants with British passports would not be allowed to seek
British consular protection while in the territory after it returns
to Chinese rule in seven years.
   Local newspapers quoted Lu Ping, deputy secretary-general of the
Basic Law Drafting Committee, which is writing Hong Kong's
post-1997 blueprint, as saying civil servants would not be allowed
to renounce their Chinese citizenship.
   In London, the British Foreign Office said it was ``seeking
clarification'' of the announcement.
   The announcements threw into doubt a British plan to offer
passports to 50,000 key Hong Kong professionals and officials,
including civil servants.
   The passports were being offered as a security net for Hong Kong
residents. Confidence in China's promise to retain Hong Kong's
free-wheeling economic system for 50 years evaporated after the
bloody June 4 crackdown on a movement for democracy in Beijing.
   The moves marked new restrictions on the territory's future
political system. Last month, China outlawed ``subversive groups''
from operating in the territory after 1997.
   The Basic Law Drafting Committee decided in Canton that the
territory's chief executive, its principal officers and all its
executive councilors could not possess the right of abode in
another country.
   Government radio said the committee still must decide whether to
ban the territory's two top judges and all its legislators from
possessing the right to live abroad.
   Under the Basic Law, Hong Kong's top officials are already
prohibited from holding a foreign passport. The move by the
committee thus marked a further restriction on politicians'
activities, prohibiting them from holding, for example, a U.S.
``green'' card or a residence permit for Canada or Britain.
   Britain has said it hopes the passport package will boost
confidence by encouraging key residents to stay in the territory by
giving them a last resort.
   But China says the package violates the 1984 agreement under
which Britain will hand the colony back to China.
   Lu said the British Consulate in Hong Kong would be prohibited
from helping Hong Kong civil servants with British passports after
1997.
   He said that without the right of abode in Britain, Hong Kong's
people would settle in Hong Kong.
   ``Now you, Britain, grant them right of abode, so just in case
they commit corruption offenses or get into trouble, they can flee
Hong Kong,'' Lu said.
   Lu's statement directly contradicted assurances made Tuesday by
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who said all Hong Kong
residents with British passports would be granted consular
protection.
   China does not recognize dual nationals.
   The committee is expected to finish drafting the Basic Law in
four days. Then it will go to China's parliament, the National
People's Congress, for a largely ceremonial vote in March.
   Still to be decided are questions concerning the percentage of
Hong Kong's 60 legislators to be directly elected after the 1997
transfer of power. China has said the maximum will be around 30
percent but Hong Kong politicians want at least 50 percent to be
voted in.
   Currently, no legislators are directly elected.

   One of the world's largest banks pleaded
guilty in a $32 million cocaine money-laundering case, but critics
call the plea bargain a ``slap on the wrist'' that won't discourage
such illicit banking practices.
   The focus of the case now shifts to evidence that may link one
of the bank's top officials to ousted Panamania dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   As part of Tuesday's plea, Luxembourg-based Bank of Credit and
Commerce International (BCCI) must forfeit a record $14 million in
assets frozen by the U.S. government. It also must cooperate
against other defendants _ including one of its bankers who once
claimed to be Noriega's personal banker.
   Amjad Awan, a former Latin American assistant division director
for BCCI, told a U.S. Senate panel in 1988 he managed Noriega's
secret accounts at the bank's Panama branch that held up to $23
million.

You couldn't set your watch according to the normally tick-tock

   Snowball fights were still in progress in schoolyards this
morning as the city of 12 million, chilled by almost-freezing
temperatures and with a light blanket of snow glistening in the
sun, approached normal speed after a day on tiptoes.
   Tokyo, on Japan's Pacific coast and 3 degrees latitude south of

doing business in South Africa.
   But the denomination's interim policy group, the church council,
is examining ``possible options'' for dealing with the board's
refusal to comply with an action last August by the denomination's
assembly.
   It had ordered the pension board to get rid of holdings by
September 1991, in all companies with direct or indirect business
in South Africa as a protest to its apartheid system of racial
separation.
   The pension board in October asked that the assembly action not
be implemented, saying it would jeopardize income, break trust with
pension members and make the board liable for damages.
   A report on possible courses of action comes before the church
council at its April meeting.

<HEAD>Abortion Issue a Loser for Republicans</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater
and his strategy team look at the abortion issue, they see a loser.
So they are urging GOP candidates to deal with it early in the
campaign year and try to put the subject to rest.
   They figure that in 1990 state or congressional campaigns in
which abortion becomes the dominant issue in the final weeks before
the Nov. 6 elections, Republican candidates who campaign against
abortion rights probably will be defeated.
   That's an ironic judgment in a party pledged by platform to
oppose abortion, and led by a president who enforced his own
opposition with three vetoes late last year. Despite those
positions, President Bush and Atwater both maintain there is plenty
of Republican room for abortion rights advocates.
   Those crosscurrents are likely to come up at Republican National
Committee meetings today and Friday, with anti-abortion Republicans
pressing to put the party out front on their issue.
   The numbers would indicate there is more mileage in Atwater's
pragmatic approach to the abortion issue.
   The abortion rights argument clearly worked to Democratic
advantage in the handful of 1989 elections, notably in the election
of Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder. This year, with the House, 34
Senate seats and 36 governorships to be filled, the GOP problem
could worsen.
   Pollsters Peter Hart, a Democrat, and Robert Teeter, a Bush
Republican, see the issue as one that could offer an important
opening to the Democrats in 1990.
   In a poll they conducted for NBC News and the Wall Street
Journal, voters said they would prefer abortion rights candidates
by a margin of nearly two to one. That survey, conducted in
November, showed that in a contest between a candidate favoring
women's right to an abortion and a candidate who wanted to ban most
abortions, 48 percent would be more likely to vote for the
pro-choice candidate. Twenty-five percent said they would more
likely vote for the anti-abortion candidate. The rest said they
would base the choice on other issues, or weren't sure.
   People who identified themselves as Republicans leaned that way,
39 percent to 33 percent.
   Asked which party could better deal with the abortion issue,
voters said Democrats, 29 percent to 21 percent.
   Bush used vetoes to block two appropriations bills that would
have provided government funds to pay for abortions for poor women
pregnant because of rape or incest; the poll indicated that voters
disagree.
   It showed 75 percent favored public funding of such abortions,
20 percent opposed.
   Atwater says he is advising candidates to be clear, concise and
quick in spelling out their abortion views. Having done so, he
says, they should stand firm on that position and move on to other
issues.
   ``So I tell candidates `Stake your position out loudly and
clearly. Don't back off.' And the second piece of advice I'm giving
them is `You define your position. Don't let your opponent define
your position for you.'''
   Atwater and other party leaders maintain that the voters will
accept differences and vote for a candidate anyhow, on other
issues, but that they don't like politicians who waffle or shift
sides.
   Perhaps.
   But thre's a lot of shuffling and shifting going on among
politicians in both parties as the campaign year begins.
   And the issue is not likely to be pushed off, or even down the
agenda by candidate efforts to get it out of the way early. It is
too emotional, and it has been recharged by the 1989 Supreme Court
decision empowering states to impose some restrictions on abortion.
In most states, legislatures are meeting for the first time since
that ruling.
   All of that points to an escalating debate in the 1990 campaign.
That is not promising for a GOP effort to settle the issue early
and put it aside.

<HEAD>Recession, Inflation, Stagflation?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Which statement best describes the state of the
economy? (a) We're in a recession; (b) Inflation remains a serious
threat; (c) ``Stagflation'' is here; (d) All of the above.
   The answer depends on where you live or work, many experts
maintain.
   ``It's a very difficult economy to analyze,'' says Irwin L.
Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New
York. ``Whether you're in a recession or have to worry about
inflation has to do with a lot of different things.''
   He points out, for example, that the manufacturing sector, which
includes the nation's automakers, easily could be described as
suffering a recession, or a period of declining business activity.
The financial services and defense industries also appear to be in
trouble.
   The service sector, on the other hand, continues to show growth.
Energy production and agriculture have picked up, too, but housing
remains a toss-up from region to region, Kellner says.
   Where does this leave the average person trying to decide how to
invest or borrow? A bit confused.
   Investment advisers urge consumers to ignore every little
economic blip and focus on long-term goals.
   ``Too many investors in America are looking at the one- or
two-year window. They need to look at the five- to 15-year
potential for growth,'' says Denver money manager Scott L. Shires.
``If you can work your way through the soothsayers, you'll do well
in blue-chips (stocks) and quality residential property.''
   Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, a North Palm,
Beach, Fla., publication that tracks interest rates among banks and
thrifts, agrees: ``Each time an economic number comes out it's the
heart attack of the hour.''
   For instance, recent worries about inflation, due partly to
reports showing a jump in food and energy prices, have pushed up
interest rates in the bond market _ even as consumers and business
were digesting a Jan. 8 drop in the prime lending rate. The
inflation news helped to temporarily lift some consumer mortgage
rates.
   The rates had been on the decline amid concerns the nation might
be falling into a recession. The Federal Reserve had been loosening
credit policies to prevent that from happening.
   Economists say both conditions, when combined, produce
``stagflation,'' a period when prices continue to rise even as the
economy weakens.
   ``Some newspapers have used recession, inflation and stagflation
in their headlines _ all in the same week,'' complains Heady.
   For the short-term investor, money market accounts are probably
the safest bet these days, investment advisers say.
   Even though interest rates have been declining since last spring
because of an overall economic downturn, rates on these accounts
have fallen the least among savings vehicles.
   ``The banks are trying to attract volatile money in a period
where people are unsure of where interest rates are going,'' Heady
says.
   The average yield on a money market account last week was 6.33
percent, down only 0.29 percentage point from April 26, Bank Rate
Monitor says.
   Rates on bank certificates of deposits fell about 1.5 percentage
points during the same period. The average rate on a one-year CD
was 7.93 percent last week, down from 9.51 percent in April, while
the rate on a five-year CD fell 1.29 percentage points to 7.91
percent.
   Investment advisers say those considering a CD might do better
locking in a rate now than waiting, since most economists expect
rates to continue dropping for awhile.
   Heady says he expects CD rates to drop between 0.30 and 0.40
percent point in the next eight weeks alone, in continued response
to the Jan. 8 prime rate cut to 10 percent from 10.5 percent. The
prime was also cut a half percentage point in July.
   For borrowers, rates haven't fallen as much as those on savings
accounts. New car bank loans fell only 0.42 percent to 12.12
percent from the end of April to last week, and Heady expects the
decline in response to the prime-rate cut will be between 0.10 to
0.15 percentage point in the next eight weeks.
   Personal loan rates actually rose, to an average 17.16 percent
from 16.99 percent, as did rates on credit cards, to 18.65 percent
from 18.09 percent, Bank Rate Monitor says.
   While mortgage rates have remained below 10 percent for several
months, some analysts predict they could rise this spring as the
home-buying season comes into full swing.
   The average rate on a 30-year conventional mortgage was 9.90
percent last week, down 0.02 percentage point from the previous
week, says HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J., publication that tracks
mortgage rates.

   From a rustic suburban house
with a yard full of overgrown weeds, five dogs and a rusting pickup
truck, the man who would be king of Albania plots a return to the
homeland he scarcely knows.
   King Leka I, an exile for all of his 50 years, believes the
rapid political reforms in Eastern Europe will light a fire in
long-isolated Albania, the last hard-line Stalinist state in the
region.
   If a revolution comes, Leka said in an interview, he would be
proud to follow the footsteps of his father, the self-made monarch
King Zog I.
   If the people don't want a king, he'd settle for the chance to
return to the country he left in 1939, when he was 3 days old, to
escape invading Italian troops during World War II.
   ``My only home is Albania,'' said Leka, who has lived in seven
countries and speaks eight languages. ``But I've learned to feel at
home wherever I have my family and my dogs.''
   He's 6-feet-8-inches tall, with glasses and a full head of
graying hair. For a meeting at his home, he wears a pistol and a
combat knife in his holster, and his military-style shirt has an
Albanian crest pinned on his collar.
   Leka, in a statement issued in December, called on Albanians
inside and outside the country to ``rise up, acting in unity and
cohesion against the tyrannical and atheist regime that has for so
long misruled our beloved homeland.''
   He said the message has been broadcast to Albania from radio
stations in Yugoslavia's adjacent Kosovo region, and also has been
reported on Radio Moscow and the Voice of America.
   Albania's Communist Party chief, Ramiz Alia, says he will resist
reforms in the rigidly controlled nation, the poorest and most
rural in Europe. The country has been largely cut off from the
outside world since the Communists came to power in 1946 under
Enver Hoxha, who ruled until his death in 1985.
   The Communist Party daily newspaper, Zeri I Populit, recently
accused Albanian exiles of trying to foment an uprising that would
bring Leka to power. Yugoslav newspapers have published reports of
unrest in Albania, which have not been confirmed and which the
Albanian government has denied.
   Leka said that more than four decades of repressive rule will
make it difficult to mobilize opposition forces. But he and his
supporters have offices in France and elsewhere in Europe, and
maintain clandestine contacts with government and military figures
disgruntled with the Communist leadership, he said.
   Because Albania is such a closed society, no accurate measure of
Leka's support within the country can be made. But he believes he
could serve as a unifying force among Albanians opposed to
Communist rule and is confident of his stature despite his family's
long absence.
   But for now, Leka can do little more than wait.
   Leka and his Australian-born wife, Susan, left Spain in 1979
when communist states put pressure on the Madrid government. Leka
claims the communist governments acted on behalf of Albania because
he had been building strong support inside and outside his homeland.
   A year later, the couple rented a ranch-style house at the end
of a dirt road here in the far northern suburbs of Johannesburg,
intending to stay only six months.
   During his exile, Leka's backers have included the late
President Anwar Sadat of Egypt, the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
of Iran, Saudi Arabia's King Faisal and Belgium's King Baudouin. He
honored their support in naming his 8-year-old son, the crown
prince, Leka Anwar Zog Reza Baudouin.
   He has used his contacts to support himself as a businessman,
exporting minerals and heavy machinery to the Middle and Far East.
He also travels extensively to maintain contacts with the estimated
3 million ethnic Albanians who live outside the country's borders,
a number almost equal to those inside.
   ``It has been difficult to wear several different hats _ to try
to be a businessman and lead a normal family life and to head an
opposition movement,'' said Leka.
   Leka's father, the head of an Albanian clan, became Albania's
prime minister in 1922 when he was still in his 20s.
   In 1928, the National Assembly gave him a title that translated
into ``prince,'' according to Burke's Royal Families of London.
However, Zog proclaimed himself ``His Majesty King Zog I,'' and the
constitution called for his son to succeed him.
   Zog died in France in 1961, and Leka was sworn in by the
government-in-exile.
   ``I am the king in exile, and I believe one day I will return,''
said Leka.

   Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky languished nine
years in the gulags for speaking his mind. Now he's getting paid to
talk.
   Jailed in 1977 on charges of spying after speaking out on human
rights and easier emigration for Soviet Jews, Sharansky focuses on
the crumbling of communism and the decline of the Soviet empire in
a U.S. lecture tour.
   But rather than lionizing Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as a
champion of democracy, Sharansky credits comrades who were
imprisoned for their beliefs.
   ``If the dissidents didn't struggle 20 years ago, we could never
celebrate what we're celebrating now. The dissidents and their
supporters in the West are the midwives of glasnost and
perestroika,'' the 41-year-old author said in an interview.
   ``Millions of people are freely expressing their beliefs. There
is such a hole in this iron wall that nobody can ever rebuild it
again. There is no question communist ideology has failed.''
   Sharansky recounted the horrors of Soviet prisons in his 1988
book, ``Fear No Evil,'' published by Random House. He plans about
10 paid lectures a year to talk about Soviet restructuring under a
contract with the Harry Walker Agency of New York, a speakers
bureau. He launched the tour on Jan. 16 at the University of
California at Davis, and made stops in Santa Barbara, Calif., and
Toronto. He is to appear in New Orleans on Tuesday. Other cities on
the tour will be announced later in the year.
   For Sharansky, the breakdown of the old order in the Soviet bloc
was the most exciting moment since his release from prison after
nine years of a 13-year sentence for spying, a charge that he and
the United States have denied.
   ``We dissidents had such deep beliefs in our hearts that sooner
or later this system had to become bankrupt, morally, socially,
economically and politically. Nobody could expect it to go so
quickly,'' he said.
   ``Gorbachev is a loyal communist. His aim was to save the
communist system by changing it. He deserves credit for one thing:
He was the first Soviet leader to say that communism would lose to
capitalism if urgent changes weren't made in the economy.
   ``He had to decide between saving the economy or saving the
empire. There is no way to save both of them. He let Eastern Europe
go its own way, but I don't think he had a choice.''
   Sharansky also noted: ``There are dissidents still in Soviet
prisons who were jailed for saying the same things as Gorbachev.''
   Now living in Israel with his wife and two daughters, Sharansky
is amazed at the speed of change, a stark contrast to the tedious
days in prisons when he played mental games of chess or sang Hebrew
songs on the cold concrete floor of his punishment cell.
   ``I told my wife that by the time our youngest daughter grew one
tooth, two more dictators in Eastern Europe had fallen down,'' said
Sharansky, looking relaxed in a sweater and open-collared blue
shirt.
   Sharansky asked to leave the Soviet Union in 1974. He was
detained, although his wife, Avital, was allowed to leave a day
after they were married.
   She worked tirelessly for his release after he was sentenced to
prison camps, even meeting with President Reagan to plead her
husband's case. Reagan and Gorbachev arranged for his release at a
summit meeting, and Sharansky passed to freedom in a prisoner
exchange on a frozen Feb. 11, 1986.
   He crossed Glienicke Bridge through a section of the Berlin
Wall. And he rejoiced when the wall opened last November.
   ``The events of the last year were the realization of our
wildest dreams,'' he said. ``For me, the wall opened for a moment
and then it closed. Now, it's falling apart.''
   He was a comrade of Soviet dissident and Nobel Prize-winning
physicist Andrei Sakharov, but was denied permission to visit the
Soviet Union for Sakharov's funeral in December.
   Sharansky, who has a street marker near the United Nations named
after him, now works for immigrant absorption in Israel. He dropped
his Soviet name, Anatoly, to use his Hebrew name, Natan, in 1986.
   As chairman of the Soviet Jewry Zionist Forum, he helps Soviet
Jews find housing and jobs. In December, his group received a $20
million gift from a billionaire American banker to assist in
resettlement.
   ``We are seeing the biggest exodus of Jews in modern history.
They are afraid to stay in the Soviet Union because of
anti-Semitism. It's absolutely inevitable this exodus will
continue,'' Sharansky said. ``There is practically no place for
Jews in the Soviet Union in the future.''

<TEXT>
   ``Junon and Avos,'' the first Soviet rock opera,
has come to New York with the original cast and new optimism.
   In the concluding scene, the narrator tells the audience that
the opera's Russian hero and his Californian lover tried to bridge
the distance between the two countries with love. The entire cast
of 60 then sings ``Hallelujah'' with such abandon that the plot's
tragic finish is all but forgotten.
   ``Eight years ago, when we sang `Hallelujah' about a
Soviet-American love affair, it was virtually an act of sedition,''
Yelena Shanina, the lead female singer, recalls of the early days
of the production. ``Now, it's celebrating a new beginning.''
   Even the name of the opera has changed with the times. To the
orginial title, ``Junon and Avos,'' producers Lucy Jarvis and
Pierre Cardin have attached a subtitle: ``The Hope.''
   Whether the good feelings and exotic music will succeed in
filling New York's City Center Theater for a five-week run is still
uncertain. A spokesman said ticket sales were slow before the Jan.
5 opening but have picked up since the first reviews _ favorable
though not ecstatic _ appeared.
   Regardless of whether the $2 million production is a commercial
success, its arrival represents the culmination of an extraordinary
political journey.
   When it somehow squeaked past the censors in 1981, the opera
caused a sensation in Moscow. Though set in 1806, it contained a
thinly disguised caricature of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev as a
doddering old man with a chest full of medals and a gold mask with
huge eyebrows.
   That, alone, might have ensured a throng of Soviet theatergoers.
But Andrei Vosnesensky, a leading Soviet poet, added two other
politically daring elements in his libretto. One was a reverent
treatment of religious symbols, including words from the Russian
Orthodox mass.
   The other was an implied message that the Soviet Union shared
the blame for an impasse in relations with the United States. That
message was expressed through the story of Count Nikolai Rezanov,
who courageously sails off to explore trading links with California
_ then a Spanish colony _ and falls in love with the governor's
daughter.
   ``Junon and Avos,'' named for Rezanov's two ships, ends in
tragedy as politics and illness foil Rezanov's mission and separate
him from his lover, the beautiful Conchita. She waits 35 years for
his return, then enters a convent when she learns he died before
obtaining the czar's permission to marry her.
   Vosnesensky says the plot is loosely based on historical truth.
There was, indeed, a Count Rezanov who helped found the
Russian-American Trading Co., traveled to California in 1806 and
died in Siberia on his way home.
   But the rest of the story is pure fiction. Vosnesensky now
acknowledges that he conceived it, following the outline of his
earlier poem, ``Avos,'' as a metaphor for the strained
Soviet-American relations of the Brezhnev era.
   ``My hero, historical Count Rezanov, was not a great fighter for
freedom. But I have put in his mouth all the words of our
intellectuals,'' Vosnesensky said in an interview.
   ``When he says `The Russian empire is a prison,' our audiences
understood what I was saying. Now it's OK just to say it. But in
1981 it wasn't OK. So I put the words in Rezanov's mouth, and it
worked.''
   It didn't work right away, however. Vosnesensky and director
Marc Zakharov repeatedly modified the opera in an effort to gain
permission for it to open at Moscow's Lenin Komsomol Theater. After
the authorities had rebuffed them for the second or third time,
Vosnesensky recalls, he began to despair.
   ``I was worried, but Zakharov said to me, `There is one more
person I know who can help us.' So I didn't ask questions. I got in
his car, we went to the main cathedral of Moscow, and we lit
candles to the Virgin Mary.
   ``I don't know whether maybe Zakharov called someone else that
night. But the next morning, `Junon and Avos' was allowed.''
   Timothy Ryback, a Harvard University researcher who has written
a book about rock 'n' roll in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union,
says that despite official condemnation, rock music had developed a
huge following in Russia by the end of the 1960s. Nevertheless,
``Junon and Avos'' is believed to have been the first full rock
opera to receive a public staging in the Soviet Union.
   Cardin, the French fashion designer who has set up clothing
factories in the Soviet Union, heard about the show and asked to
see it while on a three-day business trip to Moscow in 1982. It was
not playing that weekend, and the Komsomol Theater was busy with
another show.
   So the Ministry of Culture, eager to please the famous designer
and perhaps secure business links with his fashion empire, moved
the entire set and company to a vacant theater 25 miles outside
Moscow. There, the ministry staged a command performance on little
more than a day's notice, much to Cardin's embarassment, he said.
   Enraptured by the music _ an eclectic mix of folk melodies,
thumping electric guitars and Gregorian chants arranged by
contemporary composer Alexei Ribnikov _ Cardin decided on the spot
to try to bring the show to his Paris theater, Espace Cardin.
   Soviet cultural officials tried to persuade him to take the
Bolshoi Ballet or the Moscow Circus instead, but he held firm and
eventually got his wish after appealing to Brezhnev's successor,
Yuri Andropov.
   ``I say I want to make something young, for the young people,''
Cardin recalled. ``I tell them the Bolshoi, that is from before the
Revolution.''
   Then, just a few days before the show's Paris opening in
September 1983, a Soviet fighter pilot shot down Korean Air Lines
Flight 007, with 269 people aboard, after it apparently strayed
into Soviet air space over the Sea of Japan. Suddenly, Cardin began
to worry about bombings and security.
   ``My friends say to me, `Pierre, you cannot do this (opera) now,
because if you do that, your theater _ poof _ bomb. People were so
mad. But I say I make this only for talent, for respect for the
Russia. I am not a politician,'' Cardin said.
   Although the Paris production went off without a hitch, Cardin
hesitated bringing ``Junon and Avos'' to the United States until
superpower relations began to improve under Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   The arrangements in New York were made by Jarvis, a New York
television and theatrical producer who took the Broadway musical
``Sophisticated Ladies'' on a seven-week tour of the Soviet Union
in 1988. She and Cardin say the production might travel to San
Francisco and Japan.
   ``I am not a politician,'' said Cardin. ``But maybe with art,
you can build something stronger than with politics.''

   Business sales and inventories both rose in
November but economists noted that slower sales the following month
could worsen the December situation.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday that inventories rose 0.5
percent to a seasonally adjusted $796.8 billion in November after
rising 0.3 percent a month earlier. The November figure was
slightly higher than the 0.4 percent increase originally reported.
   Business sales were up 0.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted
$523.6 billion, after falling a revised 0.5 percent in October.
That revision compared with the initially reported 0.7 percent drop.

   Refiners boosted their profit margins by 46
cents a gallon and local retailers added 9 cents to their margins
at the peak of last month's heating oil crunch, the Energy
Department reported.
   The increases in margins, which are the difference between
buying and selling prices without regard to other costs that
determine actual profits, were disclosed Tuesday as part of a
Senate committee hearing into an average 54 percent runup in home
heating oil prices in New England in December.
   The figures are the first government data indicating that both
producers and local heating oil dealers, among others, took
advantage of the worst December cold snap in 70 years to boost
profits.

   Faced with complaints that arbitration is biased
against small investors, Wall Street officials have agreed to
consider establishing a unified system to resolve disputes between
stockbrokers and their customers.
   The proposal, made by the Securities Industry Association, would
remove arbitration from control of the nation's stock exchanges and
other self-regulatory organizations to a single industrywide body.
   ``I don't think it would be detrimental to take a look at
whether it could be feasible,'' said John Katovich, general counsel
of the Pacific Stock Exchange. ``We're certainly aware of some of
the criticisms that have been made of the system.''
   Arbitration has come under increased scrutiny following a
Supreme Court decision last May upholding the constitutionality of
contracts requiring brokerage customers to settle disputes in
arbitration rather than in court.
   Plaintiffs' lawyers claim the current system is biased against
investors because it is run by the stock exchanges and the National
Association of Securities Dealers, and because arbitration panels
contain at least one industry representative.
   Meeting Tuesday in San Francisco, the Securities Industry
Conference on Arbitration endorsed studying the plan to set up a
unified arbitration system or any other alternative to the current
structure.
   The group said the study should focus on the costs of
arbitration, funding, legal status and government oversight of any
program, Katovich said.
   Katovich said the study likely would be conducted by the
Securities Industry Association, whose president, Edward I.
O'Brien, initially made the proposal last month. No timetable for
the study was set.
   Arbitration panels typically are composed of two independent
arbitrators and one from the securities industry. Unlike
litigation, arbitration is not governed by complex rules of
evidence and panels make their decisions based on the facts
presented.
   Proponents say arbitration is quicker and faster than litigation
and investors do just as well as they would in recovering losses in
court. Opponents say the process is skewed in favor of the industry
and investors' appeal rights are limited.
   ``There's a reluctance in industry people to do anything that is
going to cause them to be criticized by anyone else in the
industry,'' said William F. Davis, a Los Angeles lawyer who handles
arbitration cases.
   ``The exchanges, though they are public, are basically composed
of people in the industry,'' he said. ``There's a built-in bias
there.''
   With several major court rulings and the stock market's 1987
crash, the number of arbitration cases soared in the 1980s. A total
of 6,100 cases were filed in 1988 compared with just 830 in 1980.
   Investors won 48 percent of the 1,561 cases decided in 1988. In
an independent study of about 100 cases decided in a three-month
period last year, plaintiffs recovered about half of their total
alleged losses.
   The NASD and the New York Stock Exchange handle more than 90
percent of the cases. The American Stock Exchange, Boston Stock
Exchange, Chicago Board Options Exchange, Midwest Stock Exchange,
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, Pacific Stock Exchange and
Philadelphia Stock Exchange also run arbitration programs.
   O'Brien has said that setting up a single arbitration system
would reduce costs to the exchanges and the securities firms that
finance the self-regulatory organizations. He said the industry
spends $12 million to $15 million a year on arbitration.
   He also has said that a unified system within the industry would
eliminate disparities in the quality of arbitrators.
   Katovich said the arbitration group also would consider any
other possible alternatives. For instance, Wall Street could decide
to remove the process from industry control entirely to an
organization such as the American Arbitration Association or set up
an independent regulatory organization.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission last year approved a
series of reforms designed to address some of the complaints. It
required the exchanges to publicize awards in specific cases and
required brokerage to highlight arbitration agreements in customer
contracts.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House
telecommunications and finance subcommittee of Energy and Finance
Committee, last year introduced legislation that would ban
pre-dispute arbitration agreements altogether.

$9,618.80.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the

for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 7.78
percent last week, down from 7.82 percent the previous week.

   Richard Braddock, head of Citicorp's consumer
banking business since 1985, has been named president and chief
operating officer of the nation's biggest banking company, Citicorp
announced.
   The Citicorp board of directors chose Braddock, 48, to become
the company's first president since 1983, when William Spencer
retired from that post after more than 40 years with the company.
   Over the past several years, the post of president essentially
was split among the executives heading Citicorp's three core
sectors: retail banking, institutional banking and investment
banking.
   Braddock, who is a director of Citicorp and its chief
subsidiary, Citibank, had been sector executive in charge of
Citicorp's worldwide retail banking unit since 1985. In 1984 he was
put in charge of the U.S. consumer banking division.
   John S. Reed, 51, has been chairman of Citicorp since 1984, when
he was promoted from vice chairman.
   Citicorp also announced Tuesday that Lawrence M. Small, who had
been sector executive running the institutional bank, was named
vice chairman and chairman of the board's executive committee.
   Citicorp said Michael A. Callen, sector executive for the global
investment bank, will be responsible for both the investment and
institutional banking for industrialized countries. Alan S.
MacDonald, who has most recently been group executive resonsible fo
the North American investment bank, was named sector executive for
Citicorp's corporate and investment banking activities in
developing countries.
   Citicorp said the management reorganization recognizes the
growing role of the company's consumer business and the need to
split the sophisticated corporate finance business that
characterizes Citicorp operations in Europe, North America, Japan
and Australia from its more traditional international business in
developing nations.
   Some banking analysts said they weren't sure why Citicorp
decided to fill the vacancy left by Spencer, although they praised
Braddock's appointment.
   ``Rick Braddock is one of the best in the business. He has a
long range of experience, especially on the marketing side of
banking,'' said James J. McDermott Jr., of Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods
in New York. ``It's not surprising,'' he was named president.
   McDermott said Braddock had headed a sector that was expected to
earn $800 million this year.

<HEAD>Judge Cuts Short Government Attempt To Blunt Razor Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has denied a Justice
Department request to immediately freeze Gillette Co.'s planned
acquisition of part of Wilkinson Sword's international razor blade
business.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Hogan refused Tuesday to issue
a temporary restraining order, saying Gillette has stated that no
action would be taken without a 10-day notice in advance to the
government.
   ``The government shall be permitted to renew its motion for a
temporary restraining order at anytime'' if the companies don't
adhere to their promise to give advance notice, said Hogan.
   The Justice Department is challenging the proposed transaction
on anti-competitive grounds, alleging a violation of the Clayton
Act, which bars acquisitions that may substantially reduce
competition.
   By acquiring Wilkinson Sword's razor blade business outside the
12-nation European community, Gillette would account for over 53
percent of the razor blades sold in the United States, says the
Justice Department.
   The judge ordered the companies to respond to Justice Department
requests for information and documents by Jan. 29, saying that the
government has raised ``potentially serious antitrust'' matters
concerning the transaction.
   Hogan also said the government may take depositions of officers
and employees of the companies.
   Boston-based Gillette plans to gain ownership of Wilkinson
Sword's razor blade business outside Europe, with title to
Wilkinson's assets in the United States transferred to Gillette as
part of the deal.

<TEXT>
   The government of Mexico and a committee of its
commercial bank creditors will sign a refinancing package on Feb. 4
in Mexico City that will reduce the country's $48 billion bank
debt, the two sides announced.
   Mexico and the banks reached final agreement last week on the
refinancing, which will cut $7.5 billion from the country's
commercial bank debt and knock nearly $2 billion from the country's
annual interest bill of $9 billion.
   It is the first refinancing completed since Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady outlined a plan last year that offered to forgive
some debt for countries that agree to make significant changes in
their economies.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has invited senior
executives of the 15 banks on the advisory committee for Mexico to
attend a signing ceremony in the capital, William R. Rhodes of
Citibank, co-chairman of the committee, said in a statement
Tuesday. The rest of the approximately 450 banks participating in
the package can sign the loan documents Feb. 7 in New York,
Citibank said.
   Details still have to be completed on a bridge loan of up to
$1.2 billion from a group of 25 to 30 banks to provide guarantees
for the refinancing, a crucial element of the package, a banking
source close to the negotiations said.
   Under the package, banks are agreeing to forgive part of
Mexico's debt or accept below-market interest rates in exchange for
guarantees of repayment, provided by funds from the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank, Japan's Export-Import Bank and the
Mexican government. The four institutions are providing a total of
$7.3 billion to guarantee the package, but they aren't contributing
all of the money at the outset, said the banker, who asked not to
be named.

   Car and truck sales jumped 27 percent in the
first 10 days of this year, prompting U.S. automakers to say their
recipe for success works: Increase incentives.
   But one industry analyst called the figures misleading because
they are being compared to a year-ago period when sales were weak.
   On Tuesday, the eight major companies with U.S. assembly plants
said they sold cars and light trucks at a daily rate of 32,539
during Jan. 1-10, compared with a 25,629-a-day pace during the same

   Car sales rose 29.8 percent in early January and truck sales
rose 22.8 percent.
   The increased sales come against a backdrop of decreased
production. General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
together have part or all of 13 assembly plants idled this week to
slow the flow of cars into dealerships.
   ``My supply of vehicles has dwindled substantially,'' said sales
manager Bill Griffith of Hayes Chrysler, Plymouth and Dodge in
Lawrenceville, Ga., near Atlanta.
   Chrysler's car sales rose 14.4 percent in early January, while
the company's truck sales, which include minivans, jumped 43.7
percent.
   Griffith said he has noticed an increase both in sales and in
the number of people entering his showroom. The most popular
vehicles are the minivans, Griffith said.
   ``The solid increases in sales are the direct result of the
guaranteed rebates,'' said James P. Holden of Chrysler's sales and
marketing division.
   He referred to the No. 3 automaker's pledge that if it increases
its rebates later this year, customers who buy using the current
incentives will receive a check for the difference.
   Analyst Mary Ann Sudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc. of New
York agreed, saying incentives that started in December on the
Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager minivans boosted consumer
interest in the vehicles.
   ``The minivan has become very popular and Chrysler's strategy to
protect their crown jewel is working,'' she said.
   GM's car sales rose 40.4 percent in early January over the
year-earlier period, despite production being scaled back by the
automaker. GM truck sales rose 28.4 percent.
   ``GM's recent adjustments in production schedules and
improvements in vehicle selling rates are evidence of the
corporation's commitment to balancing inventories with consumer
demand,'' said J.B. Fitzpatrick, vice president of marketing.
   Sudol said the overall increase in auto sales was surprising.
   ``It's a flaky kind of year. Traditionally, January is not a
robust time for sales, but there's a lot of noise coming from the
automakers about incentives,'' said the analyst, adding that she
believes the sales increase won't last.
   ``The economy is just not generating enough new jobs and enough
higher-paying jobs to keep the sales going,'' Sudol said. ``Most
people who've bought cars in the last five years are still paying
for them.''
   Early-January sales appear high because they are compared with a
year-ago period that was unusually low, Sudol said. In December
1988, automakers were offering a variety of incentives that expired
with the end of that year.
   ``It is not an easy comparison to make, since the first 10 days
in 1989 were so poor. You always get a pay-back period whenever
there are incentives,'' she said.
   Ford's sales increased the least among the Big Three automakers,
rising 15.4 percent for cars and 10.9 percent for trucks.
   In 1989, automakers saw car and truck sales slump 5.5 percent to
14.6 million from 1988's 15.4 million. Even so, 1989 was the
automakers' seventh-best selling year on record.

<HEAD>Indirect Effects of Big Retail Bankruptcy Case Possibly Widespread</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although CampeauCorp. plans to keep its
coast-to-coast department store empire running while it reorganizes
its shattered finances, the bankruptcy case could have far-reaching
consequences.
   Experts say the financial imbroglio eventually could endanger
jobs of some of the 100,000 employees at Campeau's 258 stores
around the country, lessen the immediate trend toward price-cutting
competition among department stores, and prompt investors to be
more critical of proposed retail deals.
   ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing for all of us in
this business,'' said one 30-year veteran of the retail trade, who
asked not to be identified. ``The ramifications are so widespread.
The domino effects are remarkable and difficult to conceive.''
   By seeking bankruptcy court shelter from creditors on Monday,
Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp.
can continue operating, covering payrolls and meeting suppliers'
bills while restructuring their debts.
   The fate of the chains depends on how they untangle their
balance-sheet problems. In filing the largest retailing case ever
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, Federated and
Allied said their liabilities total $7.7 billion while their assets
amount to $9.1 billion.
   There's no guarantee that Federated and Allied would be healthy
even after they complete a bankruptcy court-supervised
reorganization, experts said Tuesday.
   Lewis S. Rosenbloom, an attorney who is head of the bankruptcy
department at the Chicago law firm Winston &amp; Strawn, said the
success of any restructuring could be affected by such factors as
the stores' ability to continue getting credit.
   Retailers generally buy merchandise on credit, so if credit
dries up, manufacturers may refuse to ship, leaving stores short of
inventory and customers disenchanted.
   Business hasn't been booming at U.S. department stores in recent
months but analysts say Campeau-owned stores largely have been
moneymakers. However, profitability at Allied and Federated was
eroded by their enormous debt payments.
   The chains, including such famous retailing names as
Bloomingdale's, Rich's and Lazarus, mostly are regarded as well-run
retailers from a merchandising standpoint.
   ``I don't think there is a division there that loses money,''
said Monroe Greenstein, an analyst at Bear Stearns &amp; Co.
   Individual stores operating in weak markets might be liquidated
in a reorganization, possibly jeopardizing local jobs. However,
Greenstein said, closing poor performers would enhance overall
operations.
   Analysts said that in terms of the retail industry's health, the
pluses will probably outweigh the minuses of the Federated and
Allied reorganization.
   Richard Baum, of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. Inc., said the stiff
price competition that marked the Christmas shopping season _ and
affected profits for many retailers _ will ease. Allied and
Federated stores no longer must mark down prices to prop up sales
in order to generate enough income to meet heavy debt payments.
   Another impact could be from sales of Allied and Federated
stores. Bankruptcy reorganizations often involve asset sales to
satisfy creditors' claims and there is speculation some of the nine
Allied and Federated chains could be put on sale.
   The 17 stores in the New York-based Bloomingdale's division
already are on the auction block.
   But even if the retailing environment improves, divesting
portions of Allied and Federated could be tough, especially because
many other department stores are on the market.
   Besides Bloomingdale's, other chains looking for buyers include
Saks Fith Avenue and Marshall Field's, both owned by BAT Industries
PLC, and Bonwit Teller, owned by L.J. Hooker Corp., which is
operating under bankruptcy court supervision.
   Sanford C. Sigoloff, a turnaround expert who has been running
L.J. Hooker, a subsidiary of Australia's Hooker Corp., said, ``It's
a very unstable time right now.''
   L.J. Hooker failed in its effort late last year to find a buyer
for its upscale B. Altman &amp; Co. department store chain and was
forced to liquidate it.
   Retailing property development also could be affected by the
Campeau case. Developers and investors who provide financial
backing might not want to build new complexes when big stores
needed to anchor shopping malls are facing uncertain futures.
   Richard Echikson, chairman of Millburn, N.J.-based Retail
Consultants Inc., a company that advises on retail property
investments, said a slowdown in development of new sites might not
be all bad. He said there aren't many prime U.S. locations left and
there are plenty of existing shopping malls that could be
refurbished.
   Also, malls don't automatically go under when their main stores
run into trouble, he said. The glitzy Mall at Short Hills in Short
Hills, N.J., still had a terrific Christmas even though its four
anchors are two Campeau-owned stores and two owned by Hooker,
including an Altman's that has closed.
   Developers say Federated and Allied stores are better off back
in the hands of retailing experts rather than in Campeau's. Allied
and Federated were split from their Toronto-based parent as part of
restructuring steps leading to the bankruptcy filing.
   ``It's probably going to hurt mall development in the short-term
but in the long-term it would help,'' said Frank Pasquerilla,
chairman and chief executive officer of Crown American Corp., one
of the country's biggest shopping mall developers. ``When the dust
settles, retailing will be back in the hands of retailers.''

   G. William Miller, the former treasury
secretary and Federal Reserve Board chairman, has taken on a new
challenge: turning around the troubled Campeau Corp. retail
operations.
   Miller, 64, was named chairman and chief executive officer
Tuesday of Campeau's U.S. subsidiary. His appointment came a day
after the retailing giant, owner of 258 department stores, filed
for bankruptcy protection.
   In Miller, the American chain-store operation, which was given
operating independence from its Toronto-based parent last week, has
turned to a man viewed as a savior by other once-failing companies,
including Chrysler Corp.
   But Miller doesn't lack for critics, especially from his days at
the Fed and then as Jimmy Carter's treasury secretary.
   At Treasury, Miller oversaw the government loan program that
brought Chrysler back from the brink. As a merchant banker later,
he has revived companies large and small, earning millions, often
in the form of stock which has increased dramatically in value.
   Unlike an investment bank or a commercial bank, a merchant bank
takes a long-term stake in the companies it is advising. Miller
formed one, G. William Miller &amp; Co., after leaving Carter's cabinet.
   ``I'd like to move from being quarterback, so to speak, to being
coach,'' he said.
   He has close ties to the wealthy Ojjeh family, headed by
Syrian-born Akram Ojjeh, and other Middle East investors, for whom
he has engineered several acquisitions.
   Several years ago, creditors were about to pull the plug on
steel-oriented Korf Industries, of Charlotte, N.C., when the
company approached Miller for help. He launched a restructuring
program that included the sale of steel mills and replacement of
debt by stock. The firm now is principally owned by Kuwaiti
interests.
   At the time, he compared the rescue of Korf, which he renamed
Georgetown Industries, to his role at the Treasury during the
Chrysler crisis: ``Sell off assets to raise cash, work with lenders
to pay off debt, reduce debt, convert debt to equity ... We end up
with a company that has a sturdy balance sheet.''
   In the Korf-Georgetown case, Miller reduced debt from $265
million to $40 million in just two years.
   Miller could not be reached for an interview Tuesday over his
ideas for Campeau (U.S.) Inc., which will be renamed Federated
Stores Inc. Lisa Astudillo, his assistant, would say only that he
was traveling.
   Miller, a former chairman of Textron Inc., has long been a
director of Federated, and remained a director of the new unit
created by Campeau, even though he had resisted the takeover.
   During that battle, he assailed the acquisitions trend of the
decade, saying, ``The largest company gets thrown in turmoil and
employees suffer.''
   Yet, he has never been ready to call for government
intervention, either to halt takeovers or give takeover targets
more defenses. And during his pre-Carter days at Textron, the
conglomerate whose products range from zippers to helicopters, he
certainly wasn't shy himself on the acquisitions front.
   Born March 9, 1925, in Sapulpa, Okla., Miller grew up in Borger,
Texas, studied marine engineering at the Coast Guard Academy and
served from 1945 to 1949 as a Coast Guard officer. He received a
law degree from the University of California at Berkeley in 1952,
and joined a law firm in New York City, where one of his first
assignments was to help Royal Little, the founder of Textron, make
an acquisition.
   Little was so impressed with the young lawyer that he asked
Miller to join Textron for a one-year trial. Four years later, at
age 35, Miller became president of the company. In 1974 he was made
chairman, a post he held until Carter named him chairman of the
Federal Reserve in 1978. A little over a year later, Carter made
him treasury secretary.
   Since leaving the government, Miller generally has shunned the
limelight, though he continues to serve a wide variety of civic
organizations.
   For decades, he has been active in minority affairs, and is
crediting with helping move more women into the nation's
boardrooms, including Textron's.

<HEAD>President of Campeau Units Says They Can Restructure Successfully</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied
Stores Corp. can restructure their debt and emerge from Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection without selling groups of stores or greatly
reducing their work force, says James M. Zimmerman, president of
the two retail operations.
   ``If we run good stores during this Chapter 11, customers will
look right through this issue,'' Zimmerman said Tuesday. ``We
believe the shopper will separate the two issues and view the
bankruptcy as corporate mumbo jumbo stuff.''
   The scope of the indebtedness that drove Federated and Allied to
seek federal bankruptcy court protection took about 6,000 pages of
court filings to detail.
   The two Campeau Corp. retail divisions listed $9.1 billion in
assets and $7.7 billion in debts owed to 50,750 creditors, ranging
from investment houses that made speculative investments to fund
the buyouts of the divisions to clothing companies that supplied
their goods.
   In its bankruptcy court petition filed Monday and released
Tuesday, Federated listed $2.8 billion in secured debt and $794.8
million in unsecured debt, most of it carried by bondholders.
Allied listed $586 in secured debt and $700 million in unsecured
debt, with the parent Campeau Corp. listed its the biggest
bondholder at $100 million.
   On Tuesday, G. William Miller, 64, a Federated director, former
U.S. treasury secretary and Federal Reserve Board chairman, was
named chairman and chief executive officer of the U.S. operations.
   He succeeds John W. Burden III, who was said to have quit
effective Jan. 31 ``to pursue other interests.''
   Ronald W. Tysoe, president of Campeau Corp. and Campeau (U.S.),
the U.S. operation, will phase out his responsibilities at the
Canadian parent to concentrate on the U.S. retail operation, which
will change its name to Federated Stores Inc., the company said.
   Zimmerman will remain as president and chief operating officer
of Federated and Allied, and the management teams at all department
store chains will continue in place, the company said.
   Zimmerman said Federated and Allied are not looking to sell
divisions to pay creditors, other than previously announced plans
to sell Federated's New York-based Bloomingdale's division.
   ``This is a reorganization, not a liquidation,'' Zimmerman said.
``Our objective is to maximize the treatment of all the creditors,
but we have a bias toward keeping the companies intact ... and
restructuring the debt.
   ``Because of our tax structure, it is not efficient to sell off
divisions one at a time as a way to produce cash,'' he said.
   Zimmerman said some layoffs are possible, but large numbers are
not expected.
   ``We have a serious capital structure problem,'' he said. ``A
major mistake was made in the accumulation of too much debt on the
part of Campeau during the takeover. That has to be fixed.''
   Miller said holders of high-yield ``junk'' bonds Campeau sold to
finance its takeover of Allied in 1986 and Federated in 1988 should
expect to take losses.
   ``They bought speculative securities, and they had high interest
rates which were compensation,'' Miller said on NBC's ``Today''
show. ``I think the marketplace has already reflected in the
discounts at which they are selling the fact that they probably
will not be paid in full.''
   In listing its unsecured bondholders, Federated and Allied did
not say whether the creditors owned the bonds themselves or were
holding them for clients as trustees.
   Federated said First Boston Corp. is its largest creditor,
holding $428.8 million in bonds. But Jack Cowell, a managing
director for the New York investment house, called Federated's
figure ``vastly inflated.''
   ``The figure is well over $100 million off,'' he said.
   Cowell said First Boston bought many of the bonds at lower
market prices, investing about $75 million to $100 million in
Federated bonds.
   After First Boston, Federated listed State Street Bank-Custodian
c@o Independent Election Corp. of America at $159.9 million,
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. at $108.3 million and PaineWebber
Funding Inc. at $96.1 million.
   After Campeau, Allied listed First Boston Corp. at $97.5 million
and Manufacturers Hanover Trust at $38.4 million.
   Among the largest trade creditors listed by some of the store
groups were Liz Claiborne, with $1.4 million owed by Lazarus and
$381,076 by Abraham and Straus; $450,780 owed to Sony Corp. of
America by Lazarus; $402,456 owed to Fieldcrest Cannon Inc. by
Lazarus; $401,605 owed to Parfums Stern Inc. from Maas Brothers and
$301,151 from Burdine's; and $346,303 owed to Farberware by Maas.
   Federated's stores are Abraham and Straus, Bloomingdale's,
Burdine's Lazarus, and Rich's. Allied operates The Bon Marche,
Jordan Marsh, Maas Brothers and Stern's.
   Monday's filing was the largest under Chapter 11 by an American
retailer, affecting about 100,000 employees and 258 stores in the
United States. It also was the second-largest ever by a
non-financial company after Texaco Inc., which sought court
protection in April 1987.

   AT&amp;T is seeking to regain its ``aura of
invulnerability'' following a nine-hour outage to long-distance
service nationwide that was traced to a bug in a new software
program.
   AT&amp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen on Tuesday said he believed the
outage in a call-switching network was a ``one-time hit.''
   During a news briefing at the sprawling Network Operations
Center, Allen announced plans for a discount day on which all of
AT&amp;T's approximately 80 million long-distance customers could make
calls at reduced rates.
   The company had not decided about the amount of the discount or
when it would be offered.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. officials said other options
for compensation were being reviewed, and billings would be
adjusted to reflect the outage, but details were not given.
   Allen said the advertising campaign was designed to show that
AT&amp;T is still ``the right choice'' as it battles to maintain its 70
percent share of the market.
   Some analysts said the disruption could be a boon to AT&amp;T's
rivals.
   ``The conventional wisdom among telecommunications managers is
that you don't get fired for choosing AT&amp;T because it has this aura
of invulnerability,'' Frank Governali, an analyst with First
Boston, told The New York Times on Tuesday.
   ``That wisdom changed yesterday. The failure of AT&amp;T's network
helps give the perception that the other guys can do just as well.''
   The problem was discovered mid-afternoon Monday and corrected
nine hours later. Until it was fixed, more than half of the calls
placed on its nationwide network did not go through, the company
said.
   AT&amp;T said said the problem stemmed from a bug, or ``logic''
problem, inadvertently written into the software in a computer in
New York City that helps direct calls through the vast network. The
problem spread to more than 100 switching centers.
   ``This is not a virus,'' said spokesman Gary Morgenstern. ``It
was a human error in writing the software.''
   Allen said he could not estimate losses to AT&amp;T or its customers.
   ``We estimate we lost many thousands of calls during the outage
and thousands of potential bookings,'' said Karen Ceremsack, an
Eastern Airlines spokeswoman.
   The problem had minimal effect on reservations for Marriott's
530 hotels worldwide, said chain spokesman Roger Conner in Omaha,
Neb.
   ``Our feeling is that it affected us financially very little, if
at all,'' he said. ``It's not a matter to disenfranchise us in
terms of our satisfaction with AT&amp;T.''
   AT&amp;T has insurance to cover customers' losses stemming from the
trouble with its 800-number toll-free service, but does not have
coverage for business customers using regular long-distance
circuits.
   ``We don't have any liability in that sense,'' Allen said. ``We
have to look at each customer on a case-by-case basis.''
   Neither MCI Communications Corp. nor US Sprint, AT&amp;T's main
competitors, plan to change their marketing strategies to
capitalize on AT&amp;T's problem, spokesmen said.
   But US Sprint spokesman John Landsberg in Kansas City, Mo.,
noted an increase in the number of calls for information on its
service.
   ``People are taking a look at having an alternative carrier to
AT&amp;T,'' he said.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp., facing forecasts of sagging
car sales, expects to advertise less and cut sponsorship as part of
an overall plan to slash spending, according to a published report.
   The Detroit News said Tuesday it obtained an internal GM memo
called the ``1990 Quick Start Program,'' which said the carmaker
would cut or delay media spending by 25 percent in the first six
months of this year.
   The memo also said that GM would reduce sponsorships in motor
sports and related activities by 20 percent, the newspaper said.
   ``We're looking at a lot of things,'' said Phil Guarascio, GM
executive director of advertising. ``I don't think the door is
closed on (cutting) anything.''
   Spokesman Terry Sullivan confirmed the memo Tuesday, but said he
had no details on specific cuts and said there was no firm target
for cuts. GM does not disclose its advertising budget.
   The nation's largest automaker launched a $13-billion
cost-cutting program in 1987, and last week it confirmed another
round of cuts that published reports put at $1 billion.
   Sullivan said daily operating budgets in all departments
companywide are being reviewed in search of ways to cut or more
efficiently handle costs.
   ``I think the key there is the term `cut' or `defer,''' he said.
``Defer, it just means hold off spending for a time period and then
see if we really need it and how important it is to us. I mean
everything in general, I don't just mean advertising.''
   Car sales were slow in 1989, and the Big Three automakers have
shut down or slowed production at 13 U.S. plants this week to
lighten the 90-day supply of cars on hand. Incentives launched in
1989 to try to get rid of slow-selling cars have proven costly.
   GM on Tuesday reported a 40 percent increase in car sales and 28
percent increase in truck sales for the first 10 days of January.

   One of the world's largest banks pleaded
guilty in a $32 million cocaine money-laundering case, but critics
call the plea bargain a ``slap on the wrist'' that won't discourage
such illicit banking practices.
   The focus of the case now shifts to evidence that may link one
of the bank's top officials to ousted Panamania dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   As part of Tuesday's plea, Luxembourg-based Bank of Credit and
Commerce International (BCCI) must forfeit a record $14 million in
assets frozen by the U.S. government. It also must cooperate
against other defendants _ including one of its bankers who once
claimed to be Noriega's personal banker.
   Amjad Awan, a former Latin American assistant division director
for BCCI, told a U.S. Senate panel in 1988 he managed Noriega's
secret accounts at the bank's Panama branch that held up to $23
million.
   Defense attorneys are trying to exclude any testimony linking
Awan with Noriega, including statements they say Awan gave
involuntarily after his arrest.
   If the government insists on interjecting Noriega into the case,
defense attorneys have threatened to request sensitive government
files they say would show the U.S. government was aware of
Noriega's ties to drug smuggling.
   Charges were dropped late Tuesday against one of six bankers
charged. Proceedings against the remaining bankers and two
Colombians continued before U.S. District Judge W. Terrell Hodges
and are expected to last five months.
   Jury selection is not expected to begin until later in the week.
   Besides the $14 million forfeiture, the largest ever by a
financial institution in the United States, BCCI S.A. and BCCI
Overseas Ltd. received suspended fines and five years of
government-supervised probation.
   If convicted of all charges, $45 million in fines could have
been imposed.
   BCCI Overseas Ltd. pleaded guilty to 26 counts of money
laundering. Seven other counts were dropped. The other BCCI
subsidiary pleaded guilty to three counts of money laundering.
Twenty-four other counts were dropped.
   Hodges accepted the plea but did not set a date for sentencing.
He imposed a gag order to prevent parties in the case from
commenting.
   ``I think it's a good deal,'' said Bonnie Tischler, head of the
U.S. Customs Service in Tampa.
   BCCI, the world's seventh-largest privately held bank, is a $20
billion institution with offices in 73 countries, including the
United States.
   ``It's pretty outrageous,'' said Scott Malone, Washington bureau
chief of the monthly newsletter, Money Laundering Alert. ``It's
just a slap on the wrist. All they have to do is return the
proceeds of their crime and pay no penalty.
   ``It sends the wrong signal to bankers all over the world. ...
Many bankers in Switzerland, Montevideo and elsewhere are probably
snickering in their martinis,'' Malone said.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who conducted the Senate hearings also
lambasted the penalty.
   ``We send drug people to jail for the rest of their life, and
these guys who are bankers in the corporate world seem to just walk
away, and it's business as usual,'' said Kerry, chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on narcotics.
   ``To simply let this bank go on doing business after giving up
its drug profits is to slap it on the wrist while a whole lot of
other people in the criminal justice system have a different
standard applied to them,'' Kerry told CBS News.
   ``My impression is when banks engage knowingly in the laundering
of money, they should be shut down. It's that simple, it really
is.''
   The indictment resulted from a two-year ``sting'' during which
an undercover agent conned his way into an international money
laundering network, authorities said. Later, agents helped direct
profits from cocaine sales in American cities to Colombia through
Panama, eventually building a global laundering operation worth an
estimated $32 million, investigators said.
   The agents said BCCI bankers taught them how to use cash to buy
certificate of deposits, then use the CDs as collateral for loans.
The loan proceeds were wired into accounts controlled by the agent
or smugglers, prosecutors said.
   The branches used reportedly included locations in France,
Panama, Uruguay, the Bahamas, Luxembourg and England.
   Customs agents claimed the money was intended mainly for
Colombian drug traffickers, including the Medellin cartel.
   The defendant dropped late Tuesday was Iqbal Ashraf, 39, a
manager of BCCI's Los Angeles office. His attorneys successfully
moved to suppress statements given without counsel present.
   ``When we lost that, we just didn't have enough evidence left
(against him),'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Rubenstein.

<HEAD>Japan To Limit Auto Exports</HEAD>

   Japan will voluntarily limit its auto exports to
the United States to 2.3 million passenger cars again in fiscal
1990, Trade Minister Hikaru Matsunaga said today.
   The limit is the same as in the current fiscal year, which ends
March 31, although actual exports this year are expected to be only
2 million because of increased overseas production by Japanese
automakers.
   Japan began voluntary auto export restraints in fiscal 1981 in
response to pressure from the U.S. government to help U.S.
automakers recover. They have been considered obsolete for several
years, however, because Japan's actual auto shipments have been
less than the quotas.
   Matsunaga said the decision was made after considering auto
market conditions in Japan and the United States, including the
yen-dollar exchange rate.
   When the export restraint started, Japanese automakers had a big
price advantage over U.S. companies, but the rise of the yen
against the dollar since 1985 has made Japanese cars more expensive
overseas.
   Matsunaga also said that ``Most capital investments by Japanese
automakers in the last few years have been aimed at increasing
production efficiency and product quality, not increasing
production capacity.''
   But still, keeping the quotas is regarded as politically
important while U.S.-Japan friction continues over Japan's $50
billion annual surplus in trade with the United States.
   Today's announcement was virtually identical to last year's,
when the government said the export quota should be kept even
though exports to America were declining.
   Japanese car companies have turned increasingly to producing
autos in the United States, although some U.S. lawmakers have
argued that Japanese cars built in the United States should be
considered imports.

<HEAD>Mahlmann Re-Elected Chairman of Chicago Board of Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Karsten ``Cash'' Mahlmann has been re-elected to
a fourth consecutive one-year term as chairman of the Chicago Board
of Trade in the exchange's first contested election in a decade.
   Mahlmann, 52, the head of one of Chicago's leading commodity
trading firms, turned back a spirited challenge from Leslie
Rosenthal, a millionaire and veteran trader who had called for
rapid change in the world's largest futures exchange.
   Mahlmann defeated Rosenthal by a vote of 630-524, CBOT officials
reported late Tuesday.
   ``I am very gratified by the membership endorsement that has
been handed to me by this vote, and I am pleased the membership
will allow me to lead for another year,'' said Mahlmann, the
managing partner of Stotler &amp; Co., the exchange's third-largest
clearing member firm.
   Rosenthal, 56, managing partner of Rosenthal Collins Group, was
not immediately available for comment.
   The election took place against a backdrop of turbulence during
the past year at the CBOT, marked by an ongoing FBI investigation
into trading fraud and complaints about the exchange's handling of
July's soybean market crisis.
   Exchange officials estimated that nearly 75 percent of the
CBOT's 1,402 full members and 739 associate members _ who get
one-sixth of a vote _ cast ballots Tuesday.
   William F. O'Connor, chairman of O'Connor &amp; Co. who is viewed as
a Mahlmann ally, was elected vice chairman, defeating Donald
Andrew, senior vice president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. _ 685
to 458.
   The race for chairman pitted Mahlmann against Rosenthal, who
campaigned on a platform calling for maximizing exchange profits
and increasing member income.
   Rosenthal's proposals included introducing new exchange products
and the possible sale or refinancing of the CBOT's landmark
building in the heart of the financial district, with profits going
to the members.
   Mahlmann opposed selling or refinancing the exchange's Loop
building, saying the tax liability for members would be too high
under current law.
   Rosenthal, who served as CBOT chairman in 1981 and 1982, is
known for his daring, aggressive style.
   Mahlmann, who is considered more cautious and low-key, stressed
continuity in his campaign and building on the accomplishments of
his past three terms.
   Mahlmann portrayed himself as the best choice for seeing the
CBOT through upcoming congressional hearings on exchange issues _
such as the reauthorization of its regulatory agency, the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission _ and the federal probe that so far has
resulted in the indictment of 47 traders and a clerk in the CBOT
and Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

<TEXT>
   The 68-year-old mansion owned by Nelson Bunker
Hunt, who recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings,
is up for sale, according to a report published today.
   The Dallas Times Herald said the Hunt and his wife Caroline
intend to move into a smaller home.
   The asking price on the six-bedroom, six-bathroom house, which
overlooks Turtle Creek and features marble fireplaces and a garden
room, reportedly is $2.8 million.
   The home was valued in papers filed in the Hunts' bankruptcy
case at $1.8 million.
   The Hunts bought the house in 1962 from George McGhee, who was
named ambassador to West Germany by President Kennedy.
   Because of the bankruptcy proceedings, they were forced to turn
over holdings valued at more than $220 million. Hunt also had to
give up his annual salary of $300,000 and income from widespread
holdings.
   But because Texas law grants homeowners an unlimited exemption
for a homestead in bankruptcy proceedings, the Hunts won't have to
give any proceeds from the sale to creditors.
   The Hunts' financial problems began in 1980 when Nelson Bunker
Hunt and his brother, William Herbert Hunt, lost $1.5 billion
speculating in the silver futures markets. The silver losses were
compounded by falling real estate prices and the collapse of the
oil market.
   The brothers filed for protection from their creditors under
Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act in September 1988, shortly
after a New York jury found the Hunts had conspired to corner the
silver market.
   The Hunts emerged from bankruptcy proceedings earlier this month.

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
A. Volcker urged China on Wednesday to keep its economy open to the
world.
   Volcker, guest speaker at a three-day conference on central
banking, said he hoped China's open-door policy would continue
because international cooperation in monetary matters was
``irrelevant if you have a closed society.''
   The conference, sponsored by the U.N. Development Program, the
International Monetary Fund and the People's Bank of China, focused
on such areas as the role of monetary policy and the functions of
the central bank.
   Chen Yuan, deputy governor of the People's Bank, China's central
bank, told a news conference that one thing learned from Volcker
and other participants was ``how to resist strong demand for funds
from local governments and enterprises.''
   Volcker, head of the Fed from 1979 to 1987, was known for
sticking to a tight money policy in the face of strong political
pressure in a winning battle against inflation.
   In late 1988, China began restricting credit and took other
austerity measures in a drive to bring inflation under control.
   The government succeeded by late 1989 in bringing the inflation
rate under 10 percent, compared to 30 percent a year earlier, but
at a cost of rising unemployment and thousands of factories having
to shut down or reduce production because of lack of operating
funds.
   ``In the long run, inflation is destructive for growth and
unemployment,'' said Volcker, who now teaches economic policy at
Princeton University. ``There's a great deal to be said for giving
priority to stabilizing prices.''
   Chen acknowledged that under the current ``retrenchment''
policies, the government has given priority to price stability
rather than the pricing reforms Western economists say are crucial
for a modern, market-oriented economy.
   ``But that doesn't mean we have stopped price reform,'' Chen
said, pointing to new pricing systems in the coal and transport
industries.
   Richard D. Erb, deputy managing director of the IMF, also
praised China for its ability to rein in inflation, saying there
were very few nations that have achieved China's level of growth
``without having severe deterioration in terms of inflation.''
   Erb said the speakers at the conference, including Central Bank
of Mexico Governor Miguel Macera and former National Bank of
Belgium Governor Jean Godeaux, stressed the need for a central bank
with autonomy and accountability and a commitment to competition
among financial markets and price and wage flexibility.

<HEAD>Industrial Production, Capacity Utilization Up in December</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 2nd graf to include utility production figure</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrial production rose 0.4 percent in
December, the second consecutive monthly gain, as unseasonably cold
weather fired up output by utilities, the government said today.
   Despite the 6.3 percent gain in utilities, manufacturing
production remained sluggish, also partly because of the weather.
The slow pace was reflected by the loss of 25,000 factory jobs and
an unchanged 40.7-hour average work week.
   The manufacturing sector, particularly durable goods _ items
such as cars and household appliances expected to last more than
three years _ has been affected by the Federal Reserve Board's
tight rein on credit designed to curtail inflation since many such
items are financed by loans.
   In its report today, the board said December's gain in
production followed a revised 0.3 percent advance in November, up
from the 0.1 percent reported initially. Output had declined 0.4
percent in October and 0.1 percent in September.
   ``The extremely cold weather in December caused a sharp rise in
utility output, but also resulted in some production disruptions,
particularly in petroleum refining and construction supplies,'' the
Fed said.
   ``Aircraft production returned to normal in December following
the settlement of a strike'' at the Boeing Co., it said.
   In another report, the central bank said the operating rate at
the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.2 percentage
point to 83.3 percent in December, reflecting the increase in the
production rate. The operating rate measures not only output but
also changes in productivity levels.
   ``A surge of five percentage points in the operating rate for
utilities, which was the largest in the 23-year history of this
series, resulted from the abnormally cold temperatures experienced
in December,'' the Fed said. ``Elsewhere, utilization in
manufacturing edged down 0.1 percentage point, while the rate for
mining fell nearly a percentage point.''
   Factory use had remained unchanged at 83.1 percent from October
to November. The rate posted 10-year highs of 84.3 percent in
December 1988 and January 1989.
   The operating report is watched as a barometer of future
inflation. The closer U.S. industry gets to full operating
capacity, the greater difficulty it has producing enough to meet
demand, leading to shortages and price increases.
   Analysts general consider an operating rate of 85 percent or
above as an indication of inflationary pressures.
   Production at manufacturing plants making both durable and
non-durable goods rose 0.2 percent in December after advancing 0.4
percent in November and falling 0.5 percent in October.
   Production at plants manufacturing durable goods edged up 0.2
percent, compared with a 0.4 percent gain in November and a 1.5
percent decline in October. Non-durable manufacturing fell 0.1
percent in December after rising 0.3 percent in November and 0.7
percent in October.
   Output at mines fell 1.2 percent, after a 0.3 percent hike in
November.
   The Fed said its industrial production index in December stood
at 142.8 percent of its 1977 base, up from 142.3 percent a month
earlier.
   In the capacity utilization report, the Fed said the
manufacturing plant operating rate slipped to 83.1 percent in
December from 83.2 percent in November. The rate had peaked at 84.7
percent in January 1989.
   The rate at factories producing durable goods edged up 0.1
percentage point to 81.1 percent. The rate at factories producing
non-durable goods dipped 0.4 percentage point to 85.8 percent.
   The operating rate at mines was up 0.1 percentage point to 83.4
percent, while it shot up five percentage points to 86.3 percent at
utilities.

   The stock market got off to a weak start this
morning, struggling to overcome disappointing economic and earnings
news.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials showed a loss of 10.88
at 2,681.74 by 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Declining issues outpaced advances by about a 4-to-3 margin,
with 398 stocks rising in price, 540 falling and 502 unchanged on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.26 million shares after the
first 30 minutes of trading.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.45 to 187.92. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 0.32 to 368.73.
   Market analysts said a widening in the U.S. trade deficit to
$10.5 billion in November from $10.25 in October was discouraging
but didn't spark a slide in bond prices, which could comfort stock
traders.
   A separate report on industrial production indicated the
manufacturing sector continued sluggish. Production posted a gain

   Local heating oil dealers and major oil
companies took advantage of record heating oil demands in the
December cold snap to sharply boost their profit margins, the
government says.
   Refiners boosted their margins _ the difference between their
buying and selling prices _ by 46 cents a gallon above October
levels as part of an average 54 percent runup in heating oil prices
in New England last month, the Energy Department said.
   Local distributors also increased profit margins by 9.3 cents a
gallon, although more than half the increase happened in the first
week of January, after the worst of the cold temperatures,
according to the data.
   The figures, presented Tuesday to the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee, are the first government data indicating that
producers and local heating oil dealers among others took advantage
of the coldest December in 70 years to boost profits.
   Representatives of both the refining industry and local
retailers said the margin figures alone are misleading because they
exclude higher, profit-eating operating costs in scrambling to keep
consumers supplied.
   ``Since the middle of November, my wholesale cost has increased
59 cents per gallon while my retail price has increased by 47
cents,'' said Robert Wesson, a Waterbury, Conn., home heating oil
dealer, testifying on behalf of the Petroleum Marketers Association.
   Helmut Merklein, head of the department's Energy Information
Agency, said the extent of actual profits from the December freeze
will not be known until May after oil companies file quarterly
income statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   ``We know that the American consumer was the loser; we don't
know who the winners are yet,'' said John Easton, assistant energy
secretary for energy emergencies.
   Since the first of the year, average refiner margins and
wholesale prices on heating oil sold in New England have dropped
about 22 cents a gallon, according to the new data.
   Average retail prices are also down, but by a smaller 17 cents a
gallon to an average $1.29{ as of last Thursday. Meanwhile, jobbers
are now enjoying a peak margin of 38 cents a gallon compared with a
current margin of 36.4 cents a gallon for refiners.
   Edwin Rothschild of Citizen Action, a consumer energy policy
group, said local dealers may try to build or maintain higher
profit margins now that wholesale prices are falling.
   However, he blamed the bulk of the increase on major oil
companies who ``seized on the colder-than-normal weather to drive
prices to the highest levels in history,'' predicting they will
reap $850 million in profits.
   Charles J. DiBona, president of the American Petroleum
Institute, said some of the refineries' increased price margin was
absorbed by higher operating and transportation costs.
   The committee was told of one case in which the price of a
tanker to carry heating oil from a Texas refinery to New York
jumped from $800,000 to $2 million at the cold wave's peak.
   ``Nevertheless, industry profits probably rose ... just as they
fall in a glut,'' DiBona acknowledged.
   Glenn F. Tilton, president of Texaco Refining and Marketing,
said profits his company made on price increases the third week of
December will likely be offset by losses on 24 million gallons it
bought at 95 cents each the last week of the month.
   With much of the country enjoying warmer weather, many gallons
remain unsold and wholesale prices are now in the range of 76 cents
to 86 cents a gallon, said Tilton.
   ``Not surprisingly, no one is asking why prices have dropped or
expressing concern that we may have to sell product for less than
its purchase price,'' he said.

   The stock market was little changed today,
holding steady in the face of what analysts described as
disappointing economic and earnings news.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 1.71 to
2,694.33 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers and losers ran about even in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 603 up, 610 down and 522
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 54.02 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said a widening in the U.S. trade deficit to $10.5
billion in November from $10.25 billion in October caught some
market participants off guard.
   A separate report on industrial production was interpeted as
evidence that manufacturing remained sluggish. A rising 0.4 percent
increase in December was attributed in large measure to a cold
weather-induced bulge in output by utilities.
   Brokers also said an earnings report from International Business
Machines provided little assurance for investors who have been
waiting uneasily for fourth-quarter profit figures from many
companies.
   IBM, which said its fourth-quarter earnings shrank to $1.04 a
share from $3.97 a share in the like period a year earlier, dipped
&lsqb; to 100.
   Aristech Chemical led the active list, up { at 25&lsqb;. A
management-led group has proposed a buyout for $26 a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .10 to 188.47. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .68 at 369.09.

   The U.S. trade deficit widened in November to
$10.5 billion, its worst showing in 11 months, the government
reported today.
   The Commerce Department said that while imports declined by $593
million to $40.69 billion, U.S. exports dropped a larger $843
million to $30.19 billion. The trade deficit is the difference
between imports and exports.
   The government blamed much of the setback on the Boeing aircraft
strike, which severely cut into exports of expensive commercial
airliners.
   But private analysts were still disheartened by the deficit
figure. Many had been looking for a slight improvement following a
sharp deterioriation in October.
   ``The trade report is most distressing,'' said Allen Sinai,
chief economist of the Boston Co. ``Even accounting for civilian
aircraft, U.S. exports are going nowhere. The U.S. is simply not
competitive on goods.''
   The Bush administration was more upbeat in its assessment, with
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher saying officials were still
looking for ``continued moderate improvement in the trade deficit''
this year.
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``The
deficit is moving in the right direction. We think are policies are
sound _ no plans to change them.''
   In other reports today, The Federal Reserve Board said output at
the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.4 percent in
December, a modest gain it attributed to the return of striking
Boeing workers and unusually cold weather that boosted utility
output. The increases helped push the operating rate for U.S.
industry to 83.3 percent of capacity last month.
   The October trade deficit totaled $10.25 billion. Both October
and November represented the worst performance since a $10.8
billion deficit in December 1988.
   For the first 11 months of 1989, the U.S. trade deficit ran at
an annual rate of $111 billion, compared with a deficit of $118.53
billion in all of 1988.
   Many economists believe that America's trade deficit will
increase in 1990, reversing a two-year trend of improvements.
   This is an unsettling forecast for the Bush administration,
which is counting on continued growth in exports to bolster the
U.S. economy and dampen demands in Congress for protectionist trade
legislation.
   The 2.7 percent drop in U.S. exports left them at their lowest
level since last March.
   Almost half of all economic growth in the past two years has
been supplied by a boom in export sales. But economists are worried
that these strong increases are in danger of stalling out in 1990,
in part because the dollar was rising in value most of last year. A
stronger dollar makes U.S. goods more expensive on overseas markets.
   On the import side, the 1.4 percent November decline represented
a drop from an all-time high set the previous month. Economists
said U.S. consumer demand for foreign goods is showing little sign
of slackening.
   In addition, the country is growing more dependent on foreign
oil. Petroleum shipments climbed to $4.38 billion in November, the
highest total in six months, as the number of barrels imported rose
2 percent to 8.42 million barrels daily and the price climbed by 24
cents to $17.33.
   As usual, the biggest trade deficit in November was with Japan,
$4.0 billion, down from $4.9 billion in October. The deficit with
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
totaled $1.8 billion, while the deficit with Canada was $1.2
billion.
   Other large deficits included $1 billion with Taiwan, $800
million with China and $700 million with Western Europe.
   Many economists are pessimistic about the nation's trade
prospects, believing that the deficit will grow in 1990 because of
the dollar's strength during the past year.
   David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, predicted
America's trade deficit would rise to $115 billion this year, up
from an expected $110 billion for all of 1989.
   ``I don't think we are going to get any improvement in trade in
1990,'' Wyss said. ``We are running bigger and bigger deficits with
(Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong) and with oil prices
going up, we are hurting with OPEC as well.''
   Samuel Kahan, chief economist for Fuji Securities Inc. of
Chicago, said that for the trade gap to narrow more, U.S.
consumption will have to slow considerably while overseas growth
accelerates, boosting foreign demand for U.S. products.
   He said neither of these events was likely to occur, especially
because interest rates are rising in many countries.
   ``The trade balance pretty much has stalled out,'' he said.
   Many analysts were predicting the trade deficit will average
around $9.5 billion per month for the foreseeable future until the
dollar begins to decline further.

   Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. and its parent have
purchased a combined 35 percent stake in Hong Kong Dragon Airlines
Ltd., the airlines announced Wednesday.
   Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's largest airline, bought 30 percent
of Dragonair for 294 million Hong Kong dollars, or about $37.7
million, while its parent Swire Pacific Ltd. has acquired 5 percent
for 49 million Hong Kong dollars, or $6.3 million.
   Dragonair, the British colony's No. 2 airline that has been
losing money since its founding in 1984, also said that China's
state-owned China International Trust and Investment Corp. is
raising its stake in Dragonair from 27 percent to 38 percent.
   While Dragonair will remain an independent airline, Cathay
Pacific will name some of its key executives to provide technical
and administrative services, the airlines said.
   The two carriers will cooperate closely, with Dragonair
continuing to concentrate on serving as a regional airline with
strong emphasis on routes between Hong Kong and China, Swire said
in a statement. Cathay Pacific has operated as an international
airline.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices opened narrowly mixed
today on the Chicago Board of Trade after a steep decline in the
previous session. Grain futures continued to edge lower.
   Some of the support for soybeans stemmed from Tuesday's weekly
Agriculture Department export inspections report. The USDA said it
inspected 9.4 million bushels of soybeans for export last week, a
number slightly higher than the markets had expected.
   Wheat inspections also were above expectations while corn
inspections were about as anticipated.
   Soybean futures fell sharply on Tuesday, largely in reaction to
beneficial precipitation in soybean-growing areas of the United
States and South America.
   Wheat traders ignored the USDA's confirmation this morning that
the Soviet Union had been awarded 525,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat
at subsidized prices. The announcement had been expected since
Monday.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to { cent lower
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.98 a bushel; corn was
{ cent to 1 cent lower with March at $2.41} a bushel; oats were \
cent to } cent lower with March at $1.41} a bushel; soybeans were \
cent to 1 cent higher with January at $5.58{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were higher while pork futures were mostly lower
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .30 cent higher with February at
77.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .35 cent higher
with January at 83.50 cents a pound; live hogs were .13 cent lower
to .23 cent higher with February at 49.57 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were unchanged to .27 cent lower with February at
55.35 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures settled mostly lower on Tuesday; pork bellies
were mostly higher.

   States may tax the sales of religious books,
tapes and other merchandise sold by television evangelists, the
Supreme Court ruled today.
   The court unanimously upheld taxes imposed by California on the
Louisiana-based Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, ruling that forcing the
TV preacher's organization to pay such taxes does not violate
religious freedom.
   ``California's non-discriminatory sales and use tax law requires
only that (Swaggart's ministry) collect the tax from its California
purchasers and remit the tax money to the state,'' Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor wrote for the court.
   ``Collection and payment of the generally applicable tax in this
case imposes no constitutionally significant burden on (Swaggart's)
religious practices or beliefs,'' she said.
   The decision upheld rulings that forced Swaggart's organization
to pay California $183,000 in back taxes and interest for the years
1974 through 1981.
   The justices were told during oral arguments in October that
California is the only state imposing such taxes on religious
organizations. But now that the tax has been upheld, other states
are free to do the same.
   Most states have laws requiring payment of sales taxes on goods
bought by their residents through the mail, but many of those
states do not actively seek to enforce those laws.
   For the years at issue in the case, mail-order sales from
Swaggart's base in Baton Rouge, La., to California consumers
totaled $1.7 million. Sales of merchandise at California crusades
totaled $240,000.
   During the oral arguments, Swaggart's lawyer, Michael McConnell,
told the court, ``This ministry is not in the business to make
money. The purpose of all this is to spread the gospel.''
   He said such taxation must be prohibited ``unless we are to say
that all religious leaders are charlatans.''
   But O'Connor wrote for the court that the California tax ``is
not a tax on the right to disseminate religious information, ideas,
or beliefs per se; rather it is a tax on the privilege of making
retail sales of tangible personal property.''
   Swaggart's challenge of the California tax was supported by an
array of religious groups _ from Hare Krishnas to mainline
Protestants.
   Lawyers for the National Council of Churches, representing most
Protestant denominations, called the California tax ``a serious
threat ... a tax on the dissemination of religious messages, and
thus a forbidden tax on the exercise of religion.''
   Backing California's authority to impose such a tax were two
organizations not usually allied in court _ the American Civil
Liberties Union and the National Conference of State Legislatures.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Ruled unanimously that a doctrine restricting U.S. court
review of foreign policy does not automatically shield American
corporations from being sued for allegedly bribing foreign
government officials.
   The court permitted a lawsuit against W.S. Kirkpatrick &amp; Co., a
New Jersey corporation accused of bribing Nigerian government
officials to win a contract in 1982 for development of a medical
center at Kaduna Air Force Base in Nigeria.
   The so-called act of state doctrine, a rule adopted by the
federal courts, is designed to bar U.S. courts from inquiring into
the validity of a foreign government's acts committed within its
own territory.
   _ Ruled that a union official convicted of embezzlement may not
be forced to repay the union with his own pension benefits.
   The court, in a case from Colorado, unanimously threw out a
$275,000 judgment awarded to the Sheet Metal Workers against a
former chief executive officer of a union local.
   In the evangelist-taxes case, Swaggart's lawyers had relied
heavily on a 1943 high court ruling that overturned the convictions
of Jehovah's Witnesses who violated a city ordinance requiring all
people engaged in door-to-door canvassing to get a license and pay
a fee.
   The Jehovah's Witnesses were distributing religious literature,
and the 1943 ruling said, ``This form of religious activity
occupies the same high estate under the (Constitution's) First
Amendment as do worship in the churches and preaching from the
pulpits.''
   But today's decision drew a distinction between those fees and
the California tax.
   ``Our concern (in the 1943 ruling) that a flat license tax would
act as a precondition to the free exercise of religious beliefs is
simply not pressent where a tax applies to all sales and uses of
tangible personal property in the state,'' O'Connor wrote.
   The case is Swaggrt Ministries vs. California Board of
Equalization, 88-1374.

   International Business Machines Corp. today
announced fourth-quarter earnings fell 74 percent, largely because
of previously announcd restructuring costs aimed at making the
world's biggest computer company more profitable.
   IBM said earnings for the three months ended Dec. 31 totaled
$600 million or $1.04 a share, compared with $2.3 billion, or $3.97
a share, a year earlier. Fourth-quarter revenue totaled $20.5
billion, up 2.3 percent from $20 billion.
   The company attributed the decline mostly to a previously
announced charge against its fourth-quarter results to reflect the
expenses of restructuring its U.S. business, which has been in a
prolonged slump.
   IBM on Dec. 5 announced it expected a $2.3 billion charge
against earnings due to the restructuring, although today it stated
the charge actually came to $2.4 billion.
   IBM's earnings are scrutinized because they reflect broader
trends in the computer business. The company is the largest
manufacturer of of information processing equipment and systems and
is a historical leader in shaping the direction of the industry.
   For the year, IBM said earnings fell 40 percent to $3.8 billion
or $6.47 a share, from $5.8 billion or $6.47 a share in 1988.
Revenue totaled $62.7 billion, up 5.1 percent from $59.7 billion.
   IBM stock was up 12{ cents to $100.25 a share in mid-day New
York Stock Exchange trading following the earnings report.
   The company on Dec. 5 announced a restructuring aimed at cutting
costs and enhancing its share price. The program included plans to
cut 10,000 more jobs _ IBM's fourth job-cutting program since 1986
_ and repurchase $4 billion worth of its own stock.
   The $2.4 billion charge against earnings stemmed from costs of
the job cuts and related steps.
   IBM also stated that its earnings and revenue were hurt by the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the quarter.
   IBM has been squeezed because of sluggish spending by customers,
increasing competition and the personal computer revolution, which
is cutting into sales of the big mainframes and minicomputers that
account for most of its profits.
   John F. Akers, IBM's chairman, said in a news release that
demand for IBM products and services continued to be strong in
1989, pointing to growth on non-U.S. business revenue. He also said
the company expanded business alliances and strengthened product
and services offerings.
   ``These initiatives, coupled with our continuing drive to reduce
our costs and expense structure, will enable us to take advantage
of the growth opportunities we see for our business while enhancing
shareholder value,'' Akers said.
   IBM expanded rapidly in the early 1980s but has been cutting
back since 1985, when it became apparent that the industry's rapid
15 percent annual growth was slowing.
   The job cuts announced in December are intended to reduce the
company's U.S. workforce to 206,000 by the end of 1990, a reduction
of more than 37,000 from 1985 levels. IBM had 387,000 employees
worldwide at yearend 1988 and has been cutting jobs abroad as well.
   The cuts are to occur through attrition and early retirement
incentives.

   Genentech Inc., a leading

$15.5 million in fourth quarter earnings Wednesday, vs. a loss of
about the same amount a year earlier.
   Genentech also reported a 24 percent jump in fourth-quarter
revenues compared to the same period last year, and officials
attributed the growth to increased sales of its heart attack drug
and human growth hormone.
   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, 1989, Genentech said it earned

million or 18 cents a share a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenues totaled $111.4 million vs. $89.4 million
for the fourth quarter of 1988, a 24.6 percent increase.
   The company said sales of its much-touted heart attack drug,
Activase, increased 63 percent to $56.7 million, up from $34.7
million for the same quarter last year.
   Genentech's other marketed product, a human growth hormone sold
under the brand name of Protropin, posted fourth-quarter net sales
of $34.3 million, up from $31.7 million.
   For 1989, Genentech reported net income increased 114 percent to
$44 million, or 51 cents per share, compared to $20.6 million, or
24 cents per share, in 1988.
   Revenues for 1989 were up 20 percent to $400.5 million from
$334.8 million in 1988.

   Holiday Corp. shareholders today approved
a plan to sell the Holiday Inn hotel system to Bass PLC of Great
Britain for $2.2 billion.
   With the approval Bass acquires 55 owned or leased properties as
well as franchise agreements, joint venture agreements and
management contracts covering 1,400 Holiday Inn hotels in North
America.
   Holiday will run its profitable casino business and its newer
hotel brands, Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn and Homewood Suites,
under a new subsidiary, Promus Companies, Inc. The agreement calls
for Promus shareholders to receive a $30-per-share cash dividend.
   ``We believe this proposal not only creates maximum value for
our stockholders, but also positions each of the hotel brands for
growth by their respective owners,'' said Michael D. Rose, chairman
and president of Holiday Corp.
   Today's vote was 16,696,795 for and 69,684 against, with 251,504
shares abstaining.
   Terms of the sale call for Holiday Corp. stockholders to draw
one-quarter share of Bass stock for each of their Holiday Corp.
shares.
   Holiday Corp. said the sale is subject to approval by gaming
regulators in Nevada and New Jersey, but is expected to be complete
by the end of the month.
   Bass has more than 7,300 pubs and other food and drink outlets
in the United Kingdom. The company also brews Bass, Carling Black
Label and other beers and has annual sales approaching $6 billion.
   In 1988, Bass bought the rights to franchise Holiday Inn hotels
outside North America. As the result of that and other purchases it
already owns 14 Holiday Inn hotels in the southeast United States
and is a major franchisee in Canada.
   Holiday has sold off numerous assets in recent years while
concentrating on property management rather than ownership.
   The sale will allow it to retire $2.1 billion in outstanding
debt, much of which stems from the company's financial
recapitalization in 1987, the company said when the deal was
announced in August.

   The president of the liberal Americans for
Democratic Action today blasted the Bush administration for its
invasion of Panama and said it also has failed to be ``kinder and
gentler'' to the poor.
   ``Americans should be prepared to fight and die for what is
right,'' Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., the ADA president, told a
news conference. ``The question I ask is whether it was morally and
constitutionally right.''
   The comments came as part of what the 47-year-old Americans for
Democratic Action, often called the nation's leading liberal group,
described as a first-year report card for President Bush.
   Rangel also said that House Democratic leaders often regard
former congressman Bush as a friend and thus are too soft on his
policies. He said the news media have enjoyed the spectacle of the
Panama invasion and that as a result ``the press hysterically
supports the tattering of the Constitution.''
   Rangel said he was unimpressed by the Bush administration's war
on drugs. ``I don't see anything to knock, I don't see anything to
support,'' he said. He expressed disappointment in national drug
policy director William Bennett. ``I don't know where Bill Bennett
is,'' he said.
   ``Obviously the president has done a lot of things right if you
are middle class and white and really involved in military
maneuvers,'' Rangel said. ``I give the president an A for military
preparedness, holding down the minimum wage and staying out of
getting involved with the homeless. ...''

   Federal regulators negotiating with President
Bush's son to settle alleged banking law violations anticipate the
matter will be resolved late this week or early next week, an
official said today.
   Enforcement officials met with Neil Bush several times last week
in Washington to discuss allegations stemming from his role as a
board member of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association in
Denver, said Karl Hoyle, a deputy director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision.
   After the thrift institution failed in December 1988, regulators
blamed the collapse on management's decision to invest heavily in
Colorado's ailing commercial real estate market. They also cited an
unusually large number of transactions between officers of the
thrift and borrowers.
   Neil Bush, who owned an oil exploration firm, JNB Exploration,
had business deals with two of Silverado's major borrowers. Bush
was a director of Silverado from 1985 until August 1988, when his
father won the Republican presidential nomination.
   In an interview last week, he denied any wrongdoing and said he
had ``nothing to hide.''
   Three top officers of Silverado _ its chairman, chief executive
officer and chief financial officer _ have already agreed to accept
a thrift office order banning them from working again at a bank,
S&amp;L or credit union.
   Hoyle said Bush has not yet agreed to settle the matter, but he
said he anticipated a settlement or a decision by regulators on
whether to move against Bush absent a settlement by early next week.
   Bush would not have to admit wrongdoing as part of the
settlement. Hoyle said the agreement would not preclude regulators
from pursuing criminal charges against Bush in the future if that
is indicated.
   It also would not interfere with the right of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. to pursue a civil suit against Bush and
other Silverado officers to recover part of the taxpayers' losses.
   Bush's mother, first lady Barbara Bush, told reporters Tuesday,
``I'm sorry for him. He hasn't done anything wrong. ... He's
cooperating in every possible way.''

<HEAD>Workers Reject Latest Ford Offer; Strikes Close Three Ford Plants</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with union leaders rejecting latest
Ford offer. No pickup. A version moving on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union leaders today rejected a two-year pay offer
from Ford Motor Co. Ltd. and called a strike vote for next week.
The company said it already has laid off more than 10,500 workers
because of wildcat strikes.
   Ford's latest offer was a 10.2 percent pay raise in the first
year and a choice between 8 percent, or the inflation rate-plus-2.5
percent, in the second year.
   It was rejected during talks at the company's London offices.
Outside, about 500 Ford workers staged a noisy demonstration urging
managers to increase their offer.
   If the union votes Tuesday to reject the proposal, union members
will begin an all-out strike beginning with the final shift Jan.
26, officials said.
   About 9,000 employees already were off the job today, some for a
24-hour strike and some continuing indefinite strikes begun Monday.
   Ford said it responded by laying off more than another 10,500
employees. It employs 32,000 workers at 22 British plants. Most
earn an average of $371 a week.
   The latest offer was an improvement over Ford's previous offer
of a two-year deal of a 10.2 percent pay raise in the first year
and 7.5 percent in the second year.
   The company estimated the strikes would cut production by 2,400
vehicles, or $15 million a day.
   ``We had an understanding from the trade unions at last week's
talks that there would be no industrial action taking place,
certainly not before talks started today, and although these
strikes are unofficial, we are very disappointed,'' said a Ford
spokesman, who requested anonymity.
   An engine plant in Bridgend, Wales, engine and final assembly
operations at Dagenham, east London, and an assembly plant at
Halewood, in northwest England, were brought to a standstill, Ford
said. Production was disrupted at other plants.
   Jack Adams, chairman of the national negotiation committee's
trade union side, said: ``They will certainly have to improve the
offer and if there is not an agreement today there will be a
dispute.''
   Last month, workers voted 4-to-1 for an all-out strike if
necessary.

   A Cornell University graduate student
accused of crippling a federal computer network wanted to break
into the system but had no intention of causing any damage, a
friend testified today.
   ``He wanted to make a virus that would spread over the network,
but there was never any question of having it do anything bad,''
Paul Graham, a Harvard graduate student and friend of Robert T.
Morris, told jurors this morning.
   Graham testified that Morris told him in October 1988 he had
discovered a bug, or flaw, in the Internet network. ``I think he
had just discovered it. He had to tell someone about it. He was
very excited,'' Graham said.
   Graham said that he believed Morris just wanted to break into
university computers, but that his friend must have known there
were other computers on the Internet system, such as business and
military facilities.
   Graham testified he didn't tell anyone about Morris' plan
because it was told to him in confidence and ``at this stage I
didn't know how close he was.''
   In testimony Tuesday, a computer specialist said researchers at
an Army lab, fearing that a foreign enemy was trying to steal
weapons information, shut down their computers for nearly a week
after the runaway program, variously described as a ``virus'' or
``worm,'' appeared.
   Michael Muuss, leader of the Advanced Computer Systems team at
the Army Ballistics Research Laboratory, said the Aberdeen, Md.,
installation shut down its computers after the rogue program showed
up in their system Nov. 2, 1988.
   ``Our specific concern was that it was an attack by a foreign
power,'' he said. ``We had a real fear that someone had broken in
and was trying to take data inside and send it to somebody outside,
or that it would modify data.''
   However, defense attorney Thomas Guidoboni suggested that Army
officials overreacted.
   The suspended Cornell University graduate student's computer
tampering trial is in its second week of testimony.
   Guidoboni said Morris, 25, of Arnold, Md., created the worm as
an experiment and made a mistake that allowed it to go berserk.
Morris did not intend to cause any damage, he said.
   Prosecutors were expected to conclude their case today against
Morris, who is accused of crippling an estimated 6,000 computers.
If convicted, Morris could receive up to five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.
   Muuss testified that the Army lab shut down 200 computers linked
to Milnet, a global network carrying unclassified military
information, when Morris' worm infected one machine hooked up to
another network, known as Internet. Milnet carries information such
as computational chemistry and data on improving projectiles and
armors.
   The research center disconnected itself from Milnet and two
supercomputers at Aberdeen were shut off to outsiders for six days
while a team worked to eradicate the worm, Muuss said.
   Guidoboni asked why the shutdown lasted so long when most
universities attacked by the worm were operating within a few days.
   ``At a university, the end result may have been that someone
didn't get a paper published,'' said Muuss, who added that his
computers contained information on the evolution of weapons to 20
years in the future.
   ``Protecting defense information is a critical part of the
defense business,'' he said. ``We had to certify that no data was
stolen or modified and make sure our system could resist such an
attack if it happened again.''
   Muuss acknowledged under cross-examination that computer
security at the lab had been improved because of the worm's
invasion.
   Jurors also listened to testimony from computer system managers
at Purdue University, Carnegie-Mellon, Georgia Tech and the
University of Rochester.
   Some witnesses said although no data was permanently lost or
damaged, the worm was costly in terms of eradication and follow-up
investigations.
   But Daniel Nydick, a systems manager at Carnegie-Mellon, said he
got rid of the worm simply by crawling under his computer and
unplugging it.

<HEAD>Out On A Limb Where It Is Comfortable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While many fellow economists are contemplating a
soft landing if not a recession for the economy in 1990, Russell
Redenbaugh, an experienced forecaster, is preparing for a soft
takeoff.
   A soft takeoff is a safe one, although perhaps undramatic. It is
not a sudden ascent; its characteristics are moderation,
sustainability, steadiness. It is a positive, reassuring economy.
   In more specific economic terms it means growth of between 2
percent and 3 percent, accompanied by moderation of the extremes
and negatives that marred the 1980s.
   It means lower inflation, lower interest rates, a lower federal
budget deficit. It means more exports and a reduction in the trade
imbalance. It is one accompanied by lower capital gains taxes and
rising returns on capital.
   It is an economic situation that, Redenbaugh says, professional
economists with a negative outlook have ``grossly misread.''
Because they have misread events, he says, they have come to
``patently wrong conclusions.''
   That is, they are talking about economic deterioration, obsessed
with ``a handful of gloomy statistics for specific sectors of the
U.S. economy,'' unable to measure an historic event that he calls
the key indicator.
   To him, the key to the immediate economic future is the freeing
of the Eastern European economies from 40 years of
deindustrialization, a discontinuity that ``the economics
profession ... cannot comprehend.''
   Redenbaugh knows that his forecast puts him way out on a limb,
especially in the conservative business in which he operates, but
he claims to like it there, saying ``I feel comfortable; it's never
crowded.''
   Most economists and investment advisers run in a herd, he says,
adding: ``In this business you must have an aversion to crowds.
Crowds are comfortable, but they never produce good results.''
   Redenbaugh needs results, is measured by them, and expects to
get them as chief strategist for Cooke &amp; Bieler, Inc., a
Philadelphia-based asset management firm for Fortune 500 pension
funds and profit-sharing accounts.
   He believes that recent economic events will produce a real
peace dividend, an immediate expansion of commerce, and a
lengthening investment horizon that, as a consequence, will means
higher price-earnings ratios for stocks.
   He isn't entirely alone in his optimism. Edward Yardeni of
Prudential-Bache is probably as far out on a limb. And the
Conference Board said today that the U.S. economy is rebounding
rather than eroding, with exports leading the way.
   But if you attended a convention of economists almost anywhere
this month you might not be pleased with what you heard. Based on
their published reports, almost any uplifting news would be
balanced off with depressing reminders.
   Redenbaugh believes many professional economists are unable to
deal with changes in Europe because it doesn't fit their
``orthodoxy of using statistical models to explain everything.''
   He contends they want to say something to the effect that
``Three out of the last four times when the Iron Curtain collapsed
the following happened,'' which is, of course, absurd.
   While the suddenness of the collapse of managed economies in
Europe amazed Redenbaugh, he had suggested it might happen,
although more slowly, in a paper one year ago.
   At that time he said economic considerations were dismantling
the Iron Curtain and undermining Communist ideology, and that if
the Soviet Union was to survive it would have to abandon Marxist
economic systems.
   What has since occurred, he says, is now the key factor in
economic forecasting, whether or not it fits the conventional
forecasting models.
   As the 1990s begin, he states, ``it is not the health of the
economy that is questionable, for it is healthy; it is the health
of the economics profession that is questionable.''

<HEAD>Court Says American Corporations May Be Sued for Foreign Bribery</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Stands for a Scotus-Business Rdp.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A unanimous Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday
that American corporations may be sued for allegedly bribing
foreign government officials.
   The court permitted a lawsuit against W.S. Kirkpatrick and Co.,
which has been accused of bribing Nigerian government officials to
win a contract in 1982 for development of a medical center at
Kaduna Air Force Base in Nigeria.
   The could held that a doctrine restricting U.S. court review of
foreign policy does not automatically shield corporations from such
suits.
   The act-of-state doctrine is designed to bar U.S. courts from
inquiring into the validity of a foreign government's acts
committed within its own territory.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said the doctrine
does not bar a court from deciding the suit since ``the validity of
no foreign sovereign act is at issue.''
   The case might embarrass the Nigerian government, Scalia said.
But that alone is not enough reason to kill the lawsuit.
   ``Act-of-state issues only arise when a court must decide ...
the effect of official action by a foreign sovereign,'' he said.
``The act-of-state doctrine does not establish an exception for
cases and controversies that may embarrass foreign governments, but
merely requires that, in the process of deciding, the acts of
foreign sovereigns taken within their own jurisdictions shall be
deemed valid.''
   Scalia noted that over the years the interpretation of the
doctrine has changed so that recently the high court has used it to
guarantee separation of powers between three branches of government.
   The idea is to assure that courts will not interfere improperly
in the president's conduct of foreign affairs, Scalia said. He
noted that the administration of President George Bush, and
particularly the State Department, do not oppose the suit against
the Kirkpatrick company.
   The company was sued by Environmental Tectonics Corp., another
American corporation.
   Environmental Tectonics submitted a lower bid than Kirkpatrick
for the Nigerian project and said it would have won the contract
but for Kirkpatrick's bribery of Nigerian officials.
   The Justice Department investigated the contract, prompting the
company and its chief executive, Harry Carpenter, to plead guilty
to one count of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Kirkpatrick was fined $75,000.
   Carpenter was accused of paying Benson ``Tunde'' Akindele, a
Nigerian citizen, a ``commission'' to be turned over to Nigerian
government officials. The commission was 20 percent of the value of
the contract.
   A lower-court judge threw out Environmental Tectonics' civil
suit, but it was reinstated by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, and the Supreme Court was upholding that reinstatement.
   In other business-related cases, the court ruled that a union
official convicted of embezzling may not be forced to repay the
union with his own pension benefits.
   The court unanimously threw out a $275,000 judgment won by the
Sheet Metal Workers International Association against Curtis
Guidry, former chief executive officer of the union's Local 9 in
Denver.
   Guidry, head of the local from 1964 to 1981, pleaded guilty in
1982 to embezzling more than $377,000 from the union.
   The union said it was missing nearly $1 million of its funds.
   While Guidry was in prison, the union sued in federal court and
was awarded $275,000.
   A federal judge ordered Guidry's pension benefits placed in a
special trust to repay the union, and the 10th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals upheld the ruling.
   But the Supreme Court said Wednesday that the federal Employment
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) protects the pension
benefits of even dishonest union officials.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the court, said the law
``reflects a considered congressional policy choice ... to
safeguard a stream of income for pensioners ... even if that
decision prevents others from securing relief for the wrongs done
them.''
   ``There may be a natural distaste for the result we reach
here,'' Blackmun said. But it is the job of Congress and not the
courts to correct it.

<HEAD>Chairman of Korean Conglomerate Writes Best Selling Book on Work</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The national best seller is written by
the founder of one of South Korea's largest conglomerates, an
unabashed workaholic who says he shaves and eats breakfast in his
car to save time.
   Kim Woo-choong heads Daewoo Group, maker of products ranging
from Leading Edge computers to Pontiac LeMans exports to the U.S.
market. Kim says he wrote the book to tell young people how to find
inspiration and direction in life. Or as the suggested title for
the English version suggests, ``Work!!!''
   In South Korea, one of the fastest growing Asian countries, the
drive to succeed and make money is a passion. Kim's position as
head of a conglomerate with 1988 sales of $17.2 billion hasn't hurt
his credibility as an author.
   ``Nothing comes free in this life and nothing is accidental,''
writes Kim, 53-year-old father of four. ``The more you dig, the
deeper the hole. And the deeper the hole the more water from the
well. That's what it's all about.''
   More than 900,000 copies of ``It's a Big World and There's Lots
to be Done'' have been published since it came out last August. By
this month the book was in its 89th printing.
   South Korea's largest bookstore named it one of the five best
sellers of the decade. Daewoo says it has even sold the rights to a
professor in China for a Chinese version.
   Although the book has been translated into English, Daewoo is
looking for a U.S. publisher, and negotiations are under way for
publication in other countries.
   The 211-page paperback sells for $4.50 and features 39 essays
with pithy fatherly advice on school, working women, choice of
jobs, relationships and making money.
   His commentary is full of personal anecdotes ranging from his
school life (``not exemplary'') to religion (``better than not
having one'') to observations on why nations in southern Europe
waste so much time napping.
   Kim says he doesn't exercise, takes no vacations, sleeps five
hours a night and spends the rest of the time working and making
business deals. He wrote the book nights while waiting out a
shipyard strike last spring.
   ``My generation didn't eat well and couldn't dress well, but
look at the Korea that we've built,'' he says, advising young
people not to become smug by the country's new consumerism and
leisure time.
   ``Days are too short for me,'' he writes. ``I wish they were 30
or 40 hours long. I sometimes shave and wash with a towel in the
car on the way to work. I even occasionally have breakfast in the
car.''
   He holds staff meetings before or after the regular workday and
prides himself that at Daewoo, which means ``Big House'' in Korean,
a 9 to 5 workday can mean 5 a.m. until 9 p.m.
   ``Wasting time is worse than wasting money, for you can always
make more money,'' says Kim. ``When it comes to making money, I'm
an expert.''
   As founder and chairman of Daewoo, Kim oversees 70 overseas
offices and 93,000 employees involved in trade, construction,
shipbuilding, the manufacture of cars, industrial robots,
telecommunications, consumer electronic products, textiles and home
appliances.
   The book skips over the ways Daewoo rose from a small textile
exporter to the world's 46th largest industrial company in 22
years, omitting mention of its ties to past authoritarian
governments, low wages, easy bank credit and protectionist barriers
that allowed Daewoo and other conglomerates to grow.
   ``There's a frantic trend nowadays to think only in terms of
immediate profits,'' Kim writes. ``People are looking for comfort
and satisfaction rather than having a fighting spirit to overcome
difficulties and succeed in the long run.''
   He advises Korean women to stamp out sex discrination by
considering a job professionally, not ``a bus stop on the way to
marriage.''
   ``You have to find places that people have never been to and you
have to do things that people haven't done before,'' he advises
both sexes. ``Of course there's danger in pioneering. Pioneers take
paths that haven't been paved.''
   ``There is too much egocentricism,'' he says. ``If everyone's an
egoist, then there's always going to be trouble.''
   He recommends forming close lifetime friendships, a code
followed closely among Korean businessmen who often judge each
other by the schools they've attended.
   Although Kim exalts nonstop work, he encourages day-dreams.
``Dreams are like the rudder of a ship setting sail. The rudder may
be small and unseen, but it controls the ship's course.''

   The maker of Coca-Cola has agreed to
pay $50,000 to the state and provide consumers with $50,000 in
coupons in a settlement of a price-fixing complaint, the attorney
general's office said Wednesday.
   The agreement with Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated of
Charlotte, N.C., was announced one day after the attorney general's
office filed a complaint in U.S. District Court accusing the
company of conspiring to fix soft drink prices from 1982 to 1985.
   Judge Charles Haden has tentatively approved the settlement, the
attorney general's office said.
   Under the settlement, the bottling company will affix a minimum
of 250,000 20-cent coupon stickers to 2-liter bottles of Diet Coke,
Diet Sprite and caffeine-free Diet Coke on the soft drinks it
distributes in West Virginia from Feb. 20 to March 31. The coupons
can be redeemed at the retailer where the products are purchased.
   If the full $50,000 is not issued through the coupons, the
company will pay the state the difference, the attorney general's
office said.
   The company distributes soft drinks in most of West Virginia.

   The stock market drifted lower in an erratic
session today, faced with what analysts described as disappointing
economic and earnings news.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 11.09 to
2,681.53 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 706 up, 754 down and 490
unchanged.
   Analysts said a widening of the U.S. trade deficit to $10.5
billion in November from $10.25 billion in October caught some
market participants off guard.
   A separate report on industrial production was interpeted as
evidence that manufacturing remained sluggish. A rising 0.4 percent
increase in December was attributed in large measure to a cold
weather-induced bulge in output by utilities.
   Brokers also said an earnings report from International Business
Machines provided little assurance for investors who have been
waiting uneasily for fourth-quarter profit figures from many
companies.
   IBM, which said its fourth-quarter earnings shrank to $1.04 a
share from $3.97 a share in the like period a year earlier, dipped
&rsqb; to 97|.
   Aluminum Co. of America fell 4&lsqb; to 68| on word of lower
quarterly profits.
   Among other actively traded blue chips, American Express dropped
\ to 32&lsqb;; Philip Morris \ to 39&lsqb;, and American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph \ to 42~.
   Aristech Chemical was the volume leader, up { at 25&lsqb;. A
management-led group has proposed a buyout for $26 a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.46 to 187.91. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .58 at 368.99.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 141.64 million shares with an
hour to go.

   One giant U.S. paper company's hostile
attempt to buy another has developed into a multibillion-dollar
emotional brawl, peppered with accusations of mismanagement, lies
and coverups.
   Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s $3.8 billion offer to acquire Great
Northern Nekoosa Corp. has become a war with several fronts,
ranging from courts to full-page newspaper advertisements aimed at
swaying shareholders.
   The focus of the fray has moved to Georgia Pacific's attempt to
oust Great Northern's board at a special shareholders meeting in
Portland on March 2.
   ``It's pure fighting,'' said George B. Adler, a securities
analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. ``It sounds like a
political campaign.''
   If the merger succeeds it will create the nation's largest paper
and forest-products company, with operations in every state but
Alaska.
   Great Northern employs 20,000 workers nationwide and had
estimated sales of $3.9 billion in 1989, of products ranging from
corrugated shipping containers to the yellow sheets used in
adhesive Post-it Notes.
   Ever since Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific announced Oct. 31 it
would pay $58 a share for Great Northern, then raised the price to
$63 a share, the takeover has been a dominant story in Maine, a
lumber state not known as a corporate battleground. The only point
all sides agree on is the stakes are high.
   Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. envisions ``a very
high-quality strategic business combination,'' better able to
compete globally. Great Northern Chairman William R. Laidig says
the deal would create a ``highly leveraged junk company'' that
would run afoul of antitrust laws.
   Hahn is confident the merger will proceed, saying 75 percent of
Great Northern's stock has been tendered by shareholders. Laidig
calls Great Northern's chances of staying independent ``excellent.''
   Mainers are perhaps paying closest attention to the fight
because two company mill towns, Millinocket and East Millinocket,
and 2.1 million acres held by Great Northern are caught in the
cross fire. Natives' ingrained suspicion of any out-of-state
corporation with interests in Maine and their hopes of preserving
the vast northern woods have inflamed their passions.
   ``Whether this is right or wrong, Georgia-Pacific does not have
the quality of reputation that Great Northern has,'' said Dave
Smith, a University of Maine history professor. ``Part of it is
because Great Northern's here and Georgia-Pacific is `from away.'''
   Great Northern was founded and incorporated in Maine, although
its corporate office is now in Norwalk, Conn.
   Georgia-Pacific points to two decades of ownership of more than
500,000 acres of Maine and a mill in Woodland as evidence it is a
good corporate citizen, but its merger attempt has faced intense
scrutiny in Maine.
   During the week that Georgia-Pacific announced it was going
after Great Northern, Hahn said, his company disclosed its
intentions to top government officials in states where Great
Northern has major holdings: Wisconsin, Georgia, Virginia,
Arkansas, Mississippi and Maine.
   Maine officials immediately sought written assurances that jobs
would be protected and sensitive woodlands would not fall into the
hands of developers. When Georgia-Pacific offered assurances in
letters, conference calls and lengthy meetings at the State House
in Augusta, the Maine officials said the response was not good
enough.
   ``We have not really encountered the level of concern or
questions that developed in Maine in other states,'' Hahn said in a
telephone interview. He said Georgia-Pacific, with 44,000 employees
and projected 1989 sales of $10 billion, intends to improve Great
Northern's Maine assets.
   Great Northern, which has refused to even discuss the merger
with Georgia-Pacific, has gotten plenty of public relations mileage
out of the uncertainty the deal has raised.
   Lawyers are fighting part of the battle in U.S. District Court
in Portland, where Georgia-Pacific challenged Maine's anti-takeover
law and Great Northern's ``poison pill'' bylaws intended to thwart
a hostile takeover.
   Great Northern's responses allege Georgia-Pacific has violated
federal securities laws by masking secret plans to sell the Maine
woodlands and mills as its executives waged a campaign of cynical
propaganda to mislead Mainers and make the deal more politically
palatable.
   Great Northern alleges Georgia-Pacific Executive Vice President
A.D. ``Pete'' Correll Jr., who has often visited the state to
promote the deal, privately told consultants the Maine properties
were ``losers'' and ``dawgs'' that would be sold to make the merger
more affordable.
   Great Northern later accused Hahn of lying when he said
Georgia-Pacific had ruled out sales of the Maine properties.
Actually, Great Northern said, Georgia-Pacific told its bankers
privately that it would sell the mills.
   Georgia-Pacific said it had studied the possibility of selling
the Maine properties, but Hahn concluded the sales weren't
necessary.
   ``It's unfortunate that these kinds of allegations have been
made,'' Hahn said. ``As far as the personal attack goes, I
personally feel it was unconscionable.''
   Correll said he had no recollection of referring to the Maine
properties as ``losers'' and ``dawgs,'' although that is certainly
not how he views them today. Correll, too, was surprised by Great
Northern's allegations.
   ``I'm not normally called a liar in the press,'' Correll said.
``We're not that kind of company. I'm concerned that both Great
Northern and Georgia-Pacific's image has been harmed.''
   Georgia-Pacific, meanwhile, has accused Great Northern's
directors of seeking to entrench themselves in high-paying jobs at
shareholder expense and setting up lucrative ``golden parachute''
payments for executives to be paid if the merger goes through.
Great Northern has denied the accusations.
   Great Northern's stock was selling around $40 a share prior to
the takeover offer, so shareholders would make a healthy profit if
the deal proceeds, Georgia-Pacific says.
   Georgia-Pacific also accuses Great Northern of financially
starving the aging Millinocket mill, saying Georgia-Pacific will
offer workers a better future. Great Northern claims $4.5 billion
in credit assembled by Georgia-Pacific would leave the merged
company drowning in debt.
   Analysts agree the debt would be a concern, although several
said the merged company probably would survive.
   ``It's safe to say that this company would end up either at the
bottom end of the investment grade or the top end of the junk bond
grade,'' said Nelson Noel, an anlyst with Moody's Investor Service.
``I don't think the company is going to fall into the junk, junk
category.''
   The other hurdles faced by Georgia-Pacific are a federal
antitrust suit filed by Great Northern in Bridgeport, Conn., and an
antitrust suit filed in state court by Maine Attorney General James
E. Tierney.
   Georgia-Pacific does not view those lawsuits as serious threats,
Hahn said.
   Analysts say that other large paper companies are eyeing the
outcome. Although corporate raiders have gone after paper makers in
the past, this is the first time a competitor has waged such a
fight.
   ``There would be a feeling that if the courts and the Justice
Department and the FTC would allow this merger, some others would
consider making some acquisitions,'' Noel said.
   End advance foor Sunday Jan. 21.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean and corn futures prices fell slightly
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as rain continued in the
Midwest. Wheat futures closed slightly higher.
   The action marked the fourth consecutive daily decline in the
soybean market, where attitudes have turned bearish due in part to
increased rainfall in the U.S. corn and soybean belt and in
southern Brazil, an important soybean-producing region where the
new crop is in the early stages of growth.
   The rise in wheat futures reflected sentiments that recent
losses were not justified by supply-and-demand factors, including
Tuesday's Agriculture Department export-inspections report.
   The USDA said it inspected 22.6 million bushels of wheat for
export last week, a number higher than the market had expected.
Soybean inspections also were above expectations while corn
inspections were about as anticipated.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent to 3\ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.00{ a bushel; corn was }

   Chrysler Corp. on Wednesday recalled
about 625,000 of its 1989 and 1990 cars and light trucks with
certain 2.2- or 2.5-liter engines so it can replace a valve cover
and valve cover gasket.
   The No. 3 automaker said the gasket may move and cause an oil
leak. If the oil leak is in a certain area, an engine fire could
occur, the company said. There have been no reports of injuries or
accidents because of the problem, Chrysler said.
   The recall involves cars equipped with engines with carburetors
rather than fuel-injection systems. They were made between
early-September 1988 and mid-September 1989.
   They were sold as Chrysler LeBaron, LeBaron GTS; Dodge Dynasty,
Daytona, Lancer, Shadow, Spirit, Aries, Omni, Caravan and Dakota;
Plymouth Sundance, Acclaim, Reliant, Horizon and Voyager.
   Owners will be notified by mail and repairs will be performed
free of charge.

   Steel imports in November decreased 13 percent
from October, representing 18.9 percent of the domestic supply, an
industry association said Wednesday.
   Steel imports in November totaled 1.49 million tons, compared
with 1.7 million tons in October and 1.8 million tons in November
1988, the American Iron and Steel Institute reported.
   Imports for the first 11 months of the year fell 16 percent to
16.29 million tons, compared with 19.47 million tons in the same
period a year earlier.
   The American Institute for Imported Steel, which represents
leading steel importers and exporters, said imports for the first
11 months amounted to 15.7 percent of domestic demand when
semifinished steel bound for U.S. mills was excluded.
   Steel exports in November totaled 251,373 tons, the importers'
group said. In November 1988, American steel manufacturers exported
242,806 tons.

<HEAD>AMR Blames High Fuel Costs For Lower Quarterly, Annual Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Skyrocketing jet fuel prices in
December shot down AMR Corp. profits last year, the parent of
American Airlines said Wednesday in reporting a 66.7 percent fall
in fourth-quarter earnings.
   The fourth-quarter decline pulled down AMR's annual earnings 4.6
percent below the record level of 1988 despite record passenger
traffic.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, AMR said its net profit
dropped to $38.9 million, or 57 cents a share, from $116.7 million,
or $1.87 a share, in the fourth quarter of 1988.
   The fall occurred despite a 9.2 percent increase in
fourth-quarter revenue to $2.59 billion from $2.37 billion.
   AMR Chairman Robert Crandall began in September to predict lower
earnings for AMR and the airline industry because of rising labor
costs and AMR's own expansion plans.
   In addition to those conditions, jet fuel prices began rising
sharply in December as cold weather and refinery problems raised
the cost of petroleum products. American, the nation's largest
airline, has twice raised fares in recent weeks to help offset fuel
costs, as have its competitors.
   But ``even the latest round of (fare) increases does not come
close to covering the costs,'' said American spokesman Al Becker in
Fort Worth.
   American's fuel costs in the fourth quarter were up 30.2 percent
from 1988. In the last week of December, jet fuel cost around 96
cents a gallon, a 65.5 percent jump over the year.
   The company said the fuel price rises accounted for 27 percent
of its increased expenses.
   ``Despite record profitability during the first nine months of
1989, an extraordinarily rapid rise in fuel costs during the final
quarter of the year badly penalized the full-year results,''
Crandall said in a statement.
   For all of 1989, AMR's profit fell to $454.8 million, or $7.15 a
share, from $476.8 million, or $7.66 a share, the previous year.
   Full-year revenue jumped to $10.48 billion from $8.82 billion in
1988.
   During the fourth quarter, AMR escaped an attempted $7 billion
buyout by New York billionaire Donald Trump, whose offer collapsed
after troubles arose with a proposed employee buyout of United
Airlines parent UAL Corp. Becker would not disclose how much AMR
spent fighting off Trump, or its effect on earnings.
   Last month, AMR announced a $471 million deal to buy the prized
Latin American routes and certain other assets of Eastern Airlines
and its parent Texas Air Corp.

<HEAD>Pinola to Retire as First Interstate Chief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Interstate Bancorp said Wednesday that
Chairman and Chief Executive Joseph J. Pinola would be succeeded by
company President Edward Carson on June 1, after Pinola's 65th
birthday.
   William E.B. Siart, who heads First Interstate of California,
will succeed Carson as president of the parent company, the 10th
largest bank holding company in the country.
   Pinola's retirement this spring had been widely expected, and
the naming of Carson was seen as a sign of continuity.
   ``Carson has been in the shadow of Pinola for a long time, but
he's also been the right-hand man,'' said Dan Williams, a banking
analyst at Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco. ``It makes sense.''
   It was the second orderly top-level change announced at a big
Los Angeles bank in two days.
   Security Pacific Corp., the fourth biggest U.S. banking concern,
said Tuesday that its top two managers, chief executive Richard J.
Flamson III and chief operating officer George F. Moody, were being
replaced by their heirs apparent, Robert H. Smith and Jerry A.
Grundhofer.
   In his 12 years as First Interstate's chief, Pinola aggressively
pursued interstate expansion, presiding as First Interstate swelled
to its present $58 billion in assets, operating 28 banks in 14
states and franchising banks in 11 other states.
   But Pinola leaves at a time when First Interstate has been
hammered by huge losses at its subsidiaries in Arizona and Texas,
where the real estate market has collapsed.
   First Interstate added $400 million to its reserves in December
as it tried to get the Texas losses off its books as quickly as
possible. Six months earlier, it had set aside a $350 million
reserve against Arizona losses.
   Putting those problems behind is clearly the greatest task
confronting the 60-year-old Carson, who joined First Interstate of
Arizona in 1951, became its chairman in 1977, and was promoted to
president of the parent corporation in 1985.
   ``We made mistakes'' when the Texas and Arizona real-estate
markets were booming, Carson said in a telephone interview from
Arizona.
   He said First Interstate has tightened lending practices to try
to prevent over-aggressive lending, even in boom markets.
   ``Our strategy has been developing over the last three years,''
he said. ``We're trying to get rid of those suboptimal performers
and improve or help the good performers to be higher.''
   The big writedowns also have depressed First Interstate's stock
price, causing many analysts to regard it as a takeover candidate.
Williams noted that First Interstate would be by far the cheapest
of the big California banks for any Eastern bank hoping to enter
the lucrative markets in California.
   But Carson said First Interstate was not interested in a merger,
which he said was not in the best interest of shareholders
   ``We are not interested at the present time, based on the fact
that we have an extremely valuable franchise with a lot of
synergies available to us,'' he said.
   As an example, he said that First Interstate is well-positioned
to take advantage of computer technologies that continue to break
down the barriers between states.
   ``For example in Utah, we had a bank that really was not doing
very well, basically because Utah is an over-banked state _ I think
they have more banks per capita there than anywhere else in the
United States,'' Carson said.
   ``On the other hand, we have a very profitable bank in Nevada,
and therefore we have gone as far as we can go to combine those
banks,'' doing away with nearly all the Utah administrative staff.
   ``Technology and other advances have allowed us to bring
together the operations of those two banks into a very profitable
combined unit,'' Carson said. ``If you expand that to the
Northwest, the Southwest, you can see that there would be
tremendous opportunities.''
   California ``obviously will remain a stand-alone operation,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is proceeding
with bigger, more complicated sales of state-owned companies in a
privatization program that has more than tripled the number of
British shareholders.
   Helped by the booming stock market of the 1980s, Mrs. Thatcher's
Conservative government has raised $53 billion by selling such
industries and services as steel, gas and telephones. Next in line
is electricity.
   Not all the flotations have succeeded, and Mrs. Thatcher has
faced a barrage of accusations that she is giving away the nation's
assets. Harold Macmillan, the late prime minister, once likened it
to an impoverished family selling off its heirlooms.
   But privatization has become one of the most striking features
of Mrs. Thatcher's decade in office, and a powerful weapon in her
crusade to bury British socialism.
   The prime minister, who believes companies perform better when
the government isn't running them, has overseen the transformation
of stodgy nationalized industries into thriving competitive
businesses. A prime example is British Airways PLC, or BA, which,
as Business Week described it, has been turned from ``Bloody
Awful'' into ``Bloody Awesome.''
   But Mrs. Thatcher's aim isn't just to resuscitate ailing
industries, but to create an army of small shareholders who, having
tasted the thrills of the stock market, won't ever want to re-elect
the socialist Labor Party.
   Ten million Britons now own stock _ roughly as many as belong to
trade unions _ and 13 percent of the adult population has bought
into the privatized companies, Treasury figures show.
   Mrs. Thatcher has used the sales' revenue to convert budget
deficits into surpluses and to cut the income tax rate to just 40
percent for top earners and 25 percent for the rest, a postwar low.
   Even some of Mrs. Thatcher's ideological adversaries admire her
for the privatization campaign. Hugo Young, for example, political
columnist for the left-leaning Guardian newspaper, has praised her
for reducing the role of government in British life.
   Privatization has been so successful, its supporters say, that
Britain has become an exporter of privatization know-how, copied by
countries as diverse as Japan, Turkey, France and Chile.
   But critics say Mrs. Thatcher has become too radical during her
third consecutive term, taking her privatization program too far.
   They say the government is selling Britons what they already own
as taxpayers, or underpricing shares to ensure success.
   Particularly contentious is the sale of water and electricity,
which critics say should remain state-owned, at least for reasons
of national security.
   Moreover, they say, many privatized industries remain
monopolies, insufficiently regulated to protect consumers.
   But investors have bought shares enthusiastically and generally
have profited. The government has reserved most of the shares for
the British public _ 64 percent in British Gas PLC's case _ selling
the rest to British institutions and foreign investors.
   A shareholder who bought 100 British Gas shares for $219 each in
December 1986 could have sold them at a 34 percent profit as soon
as they began trading, or have kept them and be 76 percent richer
today, plus dividends. Sweeteners included paying for the shares in
installments, bonus shares or vouchers for free gas.
   The one big flop was the sale of the government's one-third
interest in British Petroleum Co. PLC. That $12 billion sale, the
largest so far, coincided with the October 1987 stock market crash,
and many of the shares were left in the hands of stockbrokers.
   The most recent selloff, of the 10 water authorities of England
and Wales, was widely expected to fail, because the stock market
faltered badly last October, and water seemed too vital a commodity
to expose to market forces.
   But the $8 billion sale proved the second most popular
privatization after gas, drawing 2.7 million applications for
shares.
   The government began privatization by selling relatively small
companies like Cable and Wireless PLC. Then it moved to privatizing
utilities in one piece, like British Gas, which fetched a record
4.7 million share applications.
   Now it is going even further, restructuring utilities as well as
selling them.
   Selloffs must be approved by Parliament, but the Conservatives'
large majority virtually assures assent.
   The government spent years and billions of pounds grooming its
targets for the competitive world. It wrote off their debts,
injected them with capital, closed plants and laid off workers.
   For instance, the government wrote off $2.6 billion in losses in
British Steel PLC, which cut its work force from 186,000 in 1978 to
51,600 in 1987.
   The steel giant has gone from a net loss of $2.9 billion in
1979, which got listed in the Guinness Book of World Records, to an
after-tax profit of $909 million in its first year in the private
sector.
   The government also has spent more than $160 million on
advertising campaigns and publicity gimmicks to promote
privatizations.
   In one memorable stunt, men rappelled down the side of a
high-rise building unfurling huge banners that revealed the price
of BP shares.
   The privatization program has been so successful that the
opposition Labor Party, which was responsible for nationalizing
most of the now privatized companies, has abandoned its pledge to
renationalize them.
   ``It's an acknowledgement that we're in a different world,''
said Labor lawmaker Doug Henderson.
   But Henderson remains critical. ``Privatization has been done by
and large on the cheap to make sure that they were sold. If you get
a bargain most people, take it. They got a bargain on gas,
telecommunications, and water.''
   Shares of the water companies, for example, soared to premiums
as high as 64 percent on the first day of trading on Dec. 12.
   Others say consumers have enjoyed some advantages from the
privatization _ a wider choice of telephones at cheaper prices, for
example. But some groups want tighter regulation.
   ``It really doesn't matter who owns state utilities. What does
matter is that they tend to be natural monopolies and that they
need to be regulated in such a way that they do not screw
consumers,'' said Wendy Toms, spokeswoman for the National Consumer
Council.
   Privatization also has exposed some commercial crown jewels to
foreign takeovers, creating some nationalist backlash, as happened
when Ford Motor Co. of the United States acquired British luxury
car maker Jaguar PLC in November.
   The government had gone against its own free-market principles
by retaining ultimate control in privatized companies to protect
them from foreign control. But it made Jaguar's takeover possible
by waiving its ``golden share,'' and has indicated it might
relinquish other such blockers.
   Next on the list is the sale of the electricity industry, which
could raise more than $32 billion, dwarfing all the other
privatizations. The government also hopes to privatize British Rail
and British Coal.

   A trade group representing mortgage bankers
complained Wednesday that the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. is
shirking its responsibility to finance low-cost apartments.
   Earlier this month, the company, known as Freddie Mac, tightened
its standards for buying multifamily housing loans from lenders.
Freddie Mac, which is congressionally chartered but stockholder
owned, provides money for housing by purchasing mortgages from
lenders and packaging them into securities, which are then sold to
investors. Last year it acquired more than $1.4 billion in mortgage
loans on more than 20,000 apartments.
   On Jan. 2, the agency said it would only purchase mortgages on
apartments when the borrower has made at least a 30 percent down
payment. And, unless the borrower has made at least a 40 percent
down payment, the agency is requiring the original lender to make
good on the loan in the event of a default. Earlier rules required
only a 15 percent down payment.
   Warren Lasko of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said
the new rule represented a ``complete withdrawal'' from Freddie
Mac's commitment to finance affordable rental housing.
   ``We believe that a federally chartered agency has an obligation
to follow a steady stable course in meeting its public purposes,''
Lasko said, complaining that the decision was made suddenly without
open discussion.
   However, John Nash, a spokesman for Freddie Mac, the new rule
was ``an act of prudent management'' taken to reduce Freddie Mac
loan losses. Half of the losses in the first nine months of 1989
were from apartment loans, he said.
   ``Our assignment, as defined by Congress, was not to purchase
loans that go into default. We will certainly continue to support
affordable housing,'' he said, adding that the agency hoped this
year to increase the amount of multifamily mortgages it purchased.

   The judge who will oversee the bankruptcy
reorganization of Campeau Corp.'s department store empire has a
reputation as a quietly efficient jurist _ but in this mammoth case
he also may want to fall back on his reputation for humor.
   Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr., who has been a U.S. bankruptcy judge
for 14 months, also is an amateur poet who two years ago presented
to the City Council a tongue-in-cheek ode on the merits of a
proposal to include bronze, winged pigs in a sculpture marking
Cincinnati's 1988 bicentennial.
   Critics said the pigs _ a reference to Cincinnati's 19th century
prominence in hog butchering _ made the city look silly.
   Part of Aug's 18-line verse read: ``I've heard a recent nasty
rumor; Cincinnati has no sense of humor; Now the question's grown
so big; Shall we adopt the flying pig?''
   The pigs eventually were retained.
   Aug, 43, faces a more arduous task in guiding the
reorganizations of Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. and
Allied Stores Corp. Six thousand pages articulating the largest
Chapter 11 filing in U.S. retailing history was filed with Aug's
court Monday.
   Riding on the fates of the Cincinnati-based divisions of Campeau
are 100,000 employees and 258 department stores nationwide,
including the locally based, 14,000-employee Lazarus chain.
   Aug, who also has worked as a private attorney and newspaperman
during his career, is no stranger to the federal bench or
bankruptcy cases.
   He was appointed in 1976 to an eight-year term as a U.S.
magistrate in Cincinnati and was reappointed in 1984. Magistrates
handle arraignments and certain cases under supervision of federal
district court judges.
   Aug became one of Cincinnati's two federal bankruptcy judges on
Dec. 1, 1988, when he filled a vacancy created when Judge Randall
J. Newsome transferred to a similar job in San Francisco.
   Aug handled some bankruptcy cases as a Cincinnati lawyer from
1974 to 1976 as an attorney in private practice, and before then
was a staff attorney with the federal courts in Washington. His
father, J. Vincent Aug Sr., is a Cincinnati lawyer.
   Aug declined a request by The Associated Press for an interview
because he did not wish to comment on the Federated-Allied case, an
aide said.
   Martha Perin, executive director of the Cincinnati Bar
Foundation and former director of the Cincinati Bar Association,
described Aug as low-key but efficient.
   ``He's very capable, quiet, very unassuming but very diligent,''
she said.
   Aug was born in Indianapolis and educated in Cincinnati schools.
   After graduating from St. Xavier High School, he went to
Georgetown University, where he received a bachelor's degree in
1968. He served two years with the Peace Corps in Kenya, then was a
newspaper reporter in 1970 for The Cincinnati Post.
   He received his law degree in 1973 from the University of
Cincinnati and took a job that year as a staff attorney with the
Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation in the federal court
system's Washington administrative office.
   Aug served as a columnist for The Cincinnati Enquirer from 1978
to 1983, was an adjunct faculty member at the University of
Cincinnati College of Law from 1982 to 1985, and was president of
the Cincinnati chapter of the Federal Bar Association in 1982.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
525,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices for delivery
in March under a long-term grain supply agreement, the Agriculture
Department said Wednesday.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was sold by four
private companies, which will receive subsidies under the
department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Dickerson said 511,650 tons of wheat remain in the Soviet
Union's current EEP allocation of 2 million tons announced on Dec.
19. Only wheat has been approved for sale to the Soviets under the
price subsidy program.
   The seventh year of the U.S.-Soviet grain agreement began on
Oct. 1. With the latest sales, the Soviet Union has bought about
2.3 million tons of wheat for 1989-90 delivery and more than 11
million tons of corn, plus some soybeans and soybean meal. All of
the wheat was sold under EEP arrangements.
   Meanwhile, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter announced the next round of negotiations
with the Soviets on a new agreement will be in Vienna on March
21-22. The current pact will expire on Dec. 31.
   In 1988-89, the sixth year of the agreement, the Soviet Union
bought about 5.4 million tons of wheat and more than 16.3 million
tons of corn, plus soybeans, soybean meal and grain sorghums. All
but about 700,000 tons of the wheat was bought under EEP.
   A metric tons is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 525,000 tons are equal to 19.3 million bushels worth
around $73 million at recent U.S. farm prices.
   Dickerson reported the subsidies at an average of $18.73 per
ton, or about 51 cents per bushel.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest wheat was sold by J. Aron &amp; Co.,
250,000 tons; Louis Dreyfus Corp., 150,000; Harvest States
Cooperatives, 100,000; and Cargill Inc., 25,000.

   Stock prices fell to an eight-week low Wednesday
under a barrage of late selling attributed to disappointing
economic and earnings news.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 33.49 to
2,659.13, its lowest close since it stood at 2,656.78 on Nov. 22.
   Since the average hit a record closing high of 2,810.15 in the
first session of 1990 on Jan. 2, it has retreated 153.37 points, or
5.46 percent.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
649 up, 867 down and 462 unchanged.
   Analysts said a widening of the U.S. trade deficit to $10.5
billion in November from $10.25 billion in October caught some
market participants off guard.
   A separate government report on industrial production seemed to
signal that manufacturing remained sluggish. The 0.4 percent
increase posted for December was attributed in large measure to a
cold weather-induced bulge in output by utilities.
   Brokers also said earnings reports from International Business
Machines and Alcoa provided little assurance for investors who have
been waiting uneasily for fourth-quarter profit figures from many
companies.
   IBM, which said its fourth-quarter earnings shrank to $1.04 a
share from $3.97 a share in the like period a year earlier, dropped
1\ to 98~.
   Aluminum Co. of America, another component of the Dow Jones
industrial average, fell 5~ to 66~ after the company came in with
lower quarterly profits.
   Alcoa's news appeared to drag down other basic-industry stocks
as well. Phelps Dodge dropped ~ to 59; International Paper &rsqb; to
52&lsqb;; Dow Chemical 1&rsqb; to 67~, and DuPont 1| to 121|.
   Elsewhere among actively traded blue chips, American Express
dropped | to 31}; Merck 1&lsqb; to 72; Philip Morris ~ to 38{, and
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph | to 42{.
   Caterpillar Inc., which is expected to post its results for the
fourth quarter on Thursday, lost 2&lsqb; to 54~.
   Aristech Chemical was the volume leader, up { at 25&lsqb;. A
management-led group has proposed a buyout for $26 a share.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 170.47 million
shares, against 186.07 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 202.03 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $22.39 billion, or 0.68
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.51 to 186.86.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 3.84 to 387.99, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 3.35 at 337.40.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 1.48 to 438.68. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 368.06, down .35.

   Energy futures prices tumbled Wednesday on the
New York Mercantile Exchange in response to an industry report that
showed a sharp rise in petroleum supplies.
   ``I was shocked, flabbergasted by the report,'' said Peter
Beutel, energy analyst for Elders Futures Inc.
   The report by the American Petroleum Institute, a trade
association representing major oil companies, said inventories of
crude oil, heating oil and gasoline in the nation's storage tanks
grew substantially during the week ended Jan. 12, while refineries
continued to pump out refined products at a brisk pace.
   ``We're seeing runs of a million barrels a day. It's the biggest
I've seen since I started looking at these statistics in 1982,''
Beutel said.
   Heating oil for February delivery plunged 3.51 cents to 60.52
cents a gallon, while the March contract fell 1.64 cents to 57.82
cents and April lost 1.13 cents to 55.45 cents a gallon.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for February delivery dropped 2.88
cents to 61.42 cents a gallon, March was down 2 cents to 61.82
cents and April closed at 61.78 cents, down 1.92 cents.
   The February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, closed down 68 cents at $22.10 a barrel.
All other crude contracts also lost ground.
   Analysts said the rise in gasoline stocks was the biggest
surprise, since recent indicators suggested demand for gasoline was
on the rise after warmer weather halted the heating oil rally.
   ``The market reacted violently to the unexpected build in
gasoline,'' said Michael Broder, energy broker for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Particularly surprising was the rise in refinery utilization, he
said.
   ``I think it caught the industry by surprise,'' Broder said.
   API statistics, released after the close of trading on Tuesday,
showed gasoline stocks rose 5 million barrels to 214.9 million
barrels, heating oil and other distillates increased 2 million to
108.4 million and crude oil was up 2.9 million barrels to 345.1
million.

   International Business Machines Corp. said
Wednesday its fourth-quarter earnings fell 74 percent, due to
restructuring-related costs that some analysts said were bigger
than expected.
   The world's biggest computer company posted a profit of $600
million, or $1.04 a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31. That
was down from $2.3 billion, or $3.97 a share, in the same period a
year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenue totaled $20.5 billion, up 2.3 percent
from $20 billion a year earlier.
   IBM attributed the decline mainly to a $2.4 billion charge
against fourth-quarter pre-tax profit to pay costs associated with
cutting 10,000 jobs and restructuring other aspects of its U.S.
business, which has been in a prolonged slump.
   IBM in December had projected a charge of about $2.3 billion,
amounting to about $2.25 a share, against expected earnings. The
actual charge came to some $2.58 a share, analysts said.
   ``I was surprised in that $1.04 (a share in profit) was lower
than I expected but only because the company took a
larger-than-expected one-time charge,'' said William Easterbrook,
an analyst with Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
   ``It has to do with a greater number of people taking voluntary
severance,'' he said.
   IBM stock fell $1.25 a share to $98.87{ on the New York Stock
Exchange Wednesday.
   For the full year, IBM earnings fell about 35 percent to $3.8
billion, or $6.47 a share, from $5.8 billion or $9.80 a share in
1988. Revenue totaled $62.7 billion, up 5.1 percent from $59.7
billion a year ago.
   IBM also attributed the lower earnings to a strong dollar, which
makes its business less competitive overseas, and growth in leasing
of its equipment, which reduces short-term earnings because
customers pay on a periodic basis.
   In addition to the job cuts in the restructuring plan announced
Dec. 5, IBM also said it was repurchasing $4 billion of its own
stock.
   IBM spokesman Peter W. Thonis said the company had not changed
its earlier projection of $500 million in costs for ``separation
payments'' and still expected to reduce its U.S. work force to
206,000 from the current 216,000.
   Thonis said the cuts _ IBM's fourth job-cutting program since
1986 _ would be completed by the end of March. The cuts were being
made through attrition and early retirement incentives.
   He also said the results of the restructuring were within IBM's
expectations. By 1991, the computer giant expects to reduce costs
and expenses by about $1 billion as a result of the restructuring,
he said.
   ``That works out to about $1 in earnings per share and we will
see some of that benefit starting in 1990,'' he said.
   IBM's earnings are scrutinized because they reflect broader
trends in the computer business. The company is the largest
manufacturer of information processing equipment and systems and is
a historical leader in shaping the direction of the industry.
   Industry growth, which had slowed substantially in recent years,
now appears to be stabilizing.
   IBM Chairman John F. Akers said growth in overseas revenue was
strong in 1989 and while U.S. revenue grew more modestly, it
nevertheless recorded its first gains in four years.
   ``Demand for IBM's products and services remains good,'' Akers
said, adding that the restructuring would produce a more
competitive company in the 1990s.
   Analysts generally agreed, saying IBM's recent cost controls
could result in a good payoff in the 1990s. Most said they would
continue to recommend IBM stock to investors.
   ``They're finally taking serious steps in organizing the company
and changing the cost structure,'' said Barry Bosak, analyst with
Smith Barney Harris Upham &amp; Co. ``They have a better product
compliment than they have had in recent years. My assessment is
there are no real negatives.''

<HEAD>Dollar Slips After News of Wider Trade Deficit; Gold Also Falls</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unexpected widening of the U.S. trade deficit
sent the dollar falling against most foreign currencies Wednesday.
   Gold prices were mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York,
gold rose $1.70 to $412.50 a troy ounce. Republic National Bank of
New York later quoted a bid of $412.90, up $3.10 from late Tuesday.
   Foreign exchange dealers said investors were concerned because
the poor trade performance in November was partly due to a drop in
exports. Some analysts believed the decline indicated a further
slowing of the U.S. economy.
   The Commerce Department said the trade deficit grew in November
to $10.5 billion, its worst showing in 11 months. Imports declined
by $593 million to $40.69 billion, but exports dropped $843 million
to $30.19 billion.
   The government blamed much of the increase on a strike at Boeing
Co., which severely cut into exports of expensive commercial
airliners. But private economists were still disappointed by the
figure.
   Ronald Holzer, chief foreign exchange dealer with Harris Trust &amp;
Co. in Chicago, said any possible upward moves by the dollar were
being limited by traders' skeptical view of the economy.
   However, he said, the U.S. currency was ``beginning to base at
these levels.''
   Although the trade news pushed the dollar lower, foreign
exchange traders largely focused on the West German mark and other
currencies Wednesday, Holzer said.
   Overseas dealers said continuing tensions in the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe gave the dollar some underlying support.
   The dollar did manage a gain against the British pound. In
London, one pound cost $1.6525 late Wednesday, cheaper than late
Tuesday's $1.6560. In later New York trading, the pound was quoted
at $1.65235, down from $1.6585 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's prices, included: 1.6873 West German marks, down from
1.6950; 1.5055 Swiss francs, down from 1.5116; 5.7325 French
francs, down from 5.7630; 1,256.50 Italian lire, down from
1,262.25; and 1.16515 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16375.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared to Tuesday's
late rates, included: 1.6905 West German marks, down from 1.6945;
1.5023 Swiss francs, down from 1.5160; 5.7250 French francs, down
from 5.7635; 1.8990 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9195; 1,254.75
Italian lire, down from 1,261.50; 1.1640 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1648.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 145.52 Japanese yen, down from
145.75 yen Tuesday. In London trading, the dollar closed at 145.45
yen, and in New York, it rose to 145.395 yen from late Tuesday's
145.30 yen.
   Gold prices fell below $410 a troy ounce in moderate trading in
Europe, piquing the interest of New York traders, who then moved
bullion higher.
   The late bid price for gold in both London and Zurich was
$409.75 a troy ounce, down from Tuesday's $413.25 in London and
$413 in Zurich.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $410.35 bid, down from
$415.45.
   Silver was also mixed. The metal rose 2.6 cents on the Commodity
Exchange, closing at $5.256 a troy ounce, after falling earlier in
London to $5.23 from late Tuesday's $5.25.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Plunge As Supplies Build</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil and gasoline futures prices plummeted Wednesday after an
industry report showed an increase in U.S. stocks of petroleum
products after several weeks of declining supplies.
   On other commodity markets, precious metals futures rose,
livestock and meat futures were higher, and grains and soybeans
were mixed.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 68 cents lower to 4
cents higher with the contract for delivery in February at $22.10 a
barrel; heating oil was .60 cent to 3.51 cents lower with February
at 60.52 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was 1.45 cents to
2.88 cents lower with February at 61.42 cents a gallon.
   The sell-off followed Tuesday's weekly American Petroleum
Institute supplies report, which showed sharp increases in stocks
of crude oil, gasoline and petroleum distillates last week.
   Crude oil stocks rose by 2.9 million barrels, gasoline stocks
increased by 5 million barrels and distillates, which include home
heating oil, climbed by 2.1 million barrels, the API reported.
   The API also said refinery activity rose 6.8 percent, a huge
increase and a strong contrast to recent weeks in which refining
operations were slowed by cold-weather damage to equipment in the
Gulf states and a variety of other refinery problems elsewhere.
   Energy futures had risen sharply over the past two months,
largely as a result of strong demand for heating oil caused by
unusually cold weather in Europe and then in the United States.
   But warmer temperatures have prevailed since the new year began,
and demand has eased.
   ``The weather pattern we've had so far in January has been a
contributing factor,'' said Michael Rothman, vice president of
energy securities and futures research at Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc. ``But the return to normal refinery operations, as
reflected in the API report, is really what you're seeing reflected
in today's market.''
   Gold and silver futures finished moderately higher on New York's
Commodity Exchange, boosted late in the session by reports that the
Soviet Union planned to send more troops to Azerbaijan, a southern
Soviet republic where fighting between Armenians and Azerbaijanis
is escalating.
   Gold futures settled $1.50 higher across the board with February
at $413.70 a troy ounce; silver was 2.3 cents to 2.7 cents higher
with March at $5.308 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures rose on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, led by sharp increases in cattle futures linked to tight
supplies of market-ready animals and relatively light slaughter
rates.
   Live cattle finished .35 cent to .62 cent higher with February
at 78.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to 1.02 cents
higher with January at 83.87 cents a pound; live hogs were
unchanged to .43 cent higher with February at 49.77 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .73 cent to 1.82 cents higher with
February at 56.42 cents a pound.
   Soybean and corn futures fell slightly on the Chicago Board of
Trade as rain continued in the Midwest. Wheat futures closed
slightly higher.
   The action marked the fourth consecutive daily decline in the
soybean market, where attitudes have turned bearish due in part to
increased rainfall in the U.S. corn and soybean belt and in
southern Brazil, an important soybean-producing region where the
new crop is in the early stages of growth.
   Wheat futures settled { cent to 3\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.01 a bushel; corn was 1 cent
to 1{ cents lower with March at $2.41{ a bushel; oats were 2\ cents
to 4 cents lower with March at $1.39{ a bushel; soybeans were \
cent to 2 cents lower with January at $5.57{ a bushel.

<TEXT>
   Shares of Northeast Bancorp Inc. tumbled
by 17 percent on Wednesday after the company reported a
fourth-quarter loss that reflected the impact of a declining New
England economy.
   The bank holding company's shares fell $9.50 a share to $46 in
national over-the-counter market trading.
   Northeast posted a net loss of $25,853 in the three months ended
Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $10.6 million in the same period
a year earlier.
   The company increased its provisions for possible loan losses to
$71 million from $13 million during the quarter, due to
deteriorating loan quality. Loan chargeoffs totaled $39 million
during the quarter.
   Earnings for the entire year fell to $632,000, or 8 cents per
share, from $34.6 million, or $4.39 per share, in 1988.
   Company spokesman John C. Kline attributed the stock price
plunge to the fourth-quarter financial report.
   ``I think people were reacting to the numbers more than anything
else,'' he said. ``That's the only thing I can determine.''
   Northeast Bancorp has an agreement to be acquired by Bank of New
York Co., pending changes in state laws prohibiting acquisitions by
non-regional banks. That agreement is to expire Aug. 15.
   A number of New England banks have felt the effects of declining
real estate values, bad real estate loans, and a general downturn
in the region's economy.
   Northeast Bancorp said it has been conservative in lending money
since 1987, especially in real estate, which allowed the company to
avoid many of the loan problems experienced by other banks.
   But it said the problems finally caught up with the company's
businesses, which include Union Trust Co., Connecticut's
third-largest commercial bank; NBI Mortgage Investment Corp.; UT
Finance Ltd.; and Fairfield Properties Inc.

   America's trade deficit widened to $10.5
billion in November, its worst showing in 11 months, as U.S.
exports took a tumble caused in part by a strike at Boeing, the
Commerce Department said Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said that while imports dipped slightly
from an all-time high set in October, U.S. exports sales declined
even more, falling to their lowest level since last March.
   As a result, the trade deficit, the difference between imports
and exports, rose 2.4 percent.
   The increase, coming on the heels of an even worse 20 percent
surge in the October deficit, left private economists disheartened
about the chances for further improvement in the country's trade
performance any time soon.
   Wall Street reacted to the trade report with disappointment as
well, sending the Dow Jones industrial average down by 33.49 points
to close at 2,659.13, its lowest closing since Nov. 22.
   However, in better economic news, the government reported
Wednesday that industrial production rose 0.4 percent in December,
its best showing since August, while the operating rate at American
factories, mines and utilities rose 0.2 percentage point to 83.3
percent of capacity.
   Much of the strength was attributed to a return of striking
Boeing workers and a record jump in utility usage, caused by
unusually severe weather in December.
   But analysts, noting that industrial production figures for
September, October and November were all revised upward, said the
new-found strength in U.S. industry provided further evidence that
the current economic slowdown should not worsen into a recession.
   For the first 11 months of this year, the U.S. trade deficit has
been running at an annual rate of $111 billion, only a marginal
improvement from the $118.53 billion deficit for all of 1988.
   Many economists are forecasting that the trade deficit this year
will begin rising again, reflecting a growing U.S. dependence on
foreign oil, a further slowdown in U.S. export sales abroad and
continued demand by American consumers for foreign products.
   ``The trade report is most distressing,'' said Allen Sinai,
chief economist of the Boston Co. ``The United States simply is
just not competitive on goods. We are not selling enough overseas
and Americans keep on buying imports.''
   Michael K. Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said he
was not looking for any improvement in the trade deficit either
this year or in 1991 saying, ``A balanced trade sector is just not
going to happen. We like imports too much.''
   The Bush administration, which is counting on continued solid
growth in exports to bolster the domestic economy, was more upbeat
in its assessment of the November trade report.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said the administration was
still looking for ``continued moderate improvement in the trade
deficit'' in 1990.
   The trade improvement over the past two years has accounted for
almost half of total U.S. economic growth. But with the export boom
showing signs of running out of steam, many analysts are predicting
that the overall economy will grow at just half the rate turned in
during 1989.
   The November trade deficit, and a revised $10.25 billion
imbalance in October, were the worst imbalances since a $10.8
billion deficit in December 1988.
   The 2.7 percent drop in exports, to $30.19 billion, included an
$895 million decline in commercial airplane exports, caused in
large part by the 45-day strike at Boeing, which ended on Nov. 21.
   However, analysts noted that even without the big drop in
airplane shipments in November, export sales have been basically
flat since last June.
   Imports totaled $40.69 billion in November, down only a slight
1.4 percent from their all-time high set in October.
   While shipments of autos from Japan fell by 14.1 percent during
the month, America's foreign oil bill climbed to $4.38 billion. The
number of barrels imported daily edged up to 8.42 million while the
price per barrel rose by 24 cents to $17.33.
   Economists are predicting even higher oil bills in the future as
America's dependence on foreign oil increases. The American
Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group, reported Wednesday
that foreign imports rose to 46 percent of total supplies in 1989,
the second-highest level on record.
   As usual, the biggest trade deficit in November was with Japan,
$4.0 billion, even though the total represented a decline from a
$4.9 billion October deficit.
   Other large deficits were recorded with Canada, $1.2 billiion;
Taiwan, $1 billion, China, $800 million, and Western Europe, $700
million.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Production rates at three Chrysler Corp. assembly
plants will be cut in March, resulting in the indefinite layoffs of
more than 2,000 workers, the company said Wednesday.
   Spokesman Doug Nicoll blamed the moves on slow sales.
   The cuts are due at Chrysler's plants in Belvidere, Ill.;
Newark, Del.; and Toledo, Ohio, which make some of the company's
most profitable cars and Jeeps.
   The reductions come in addition to previously announced
temporary and indefinite layoffs that will affect more than 25,000
Chrysler workers in February. Chrysler will close its Jefferson
Avenue assembly plant in Detroit Feb. 2, affecting 1,700 workers,
and eliminate the second shift at its St. Louis car plant,
involving 1,900 employees, beginning Feb. 12. Other layoffs are
temporary.
   The Belvidere factory assembles the Chrysler New Yorker, Salon,
Fifth Avenue and Imperial and the Dodge Dynasty cars, which carry
the highest per-car profit in the No. 3 automaker's lineup.
   The Newark plant makes the Plymouth Acclaim, Dodge Spirit and
the Chrysler LeBaron sedan. Jeeps, which make up a large portion of
Chrysler's light truck sales, are made at its Toledo plant.
   Nicoll said 750 salaried and hourly employees will be affected
at Belvidere, 780 will be laid off at Newark and 724 will lose
their jobs at Toledo. He did not have a breakdown of salaried and
hourly employees at the plants.
   A survey last year of automotive plant capacity by Autofacts
Inc. of Philadelphia showed hourly workers make up between 84 and
90 percent of the employees at each of the plants.
   Production rates at the Belvidere and Newark plants will be
trimmed by 12 percent and Jeep production at Toledo will be cut by
about 8 percent, Nicoll said.
   Each of the three plants will shut down completely for the week
of March 19.
   ``When they come back up the week of the 26th, they will come up
at lower production rates,'' Nicoll said.
   Nicoll declined to give assembly line speeds, but the Autofacts'
survey showed that production rates were between 60 and 65 vehicles
an hour at each plant.

   Despite efforts to improve the government's
drug-approval process, it still takes too long to push new drugs
through the regulatory maze, manufacturers said Wednesday.
   It takes about 10 years to move a new drug from development
through testing on patients to approval from the Food and Drug
Administration, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association said.
   ``Given the overriding importance of new drug therapy, that
10-year-period _ including the 32{ months of review time at FDA _
is too long and must be shortened,'' said Gerald J. Mossinghoff,
president of the trade association.
   ``We think there's some opportunity'' to cut down the review
time as well as the time in clinical trials, Mossinghoff told
reporters.
   Mossinghoff said the FDA needs more employees, better facilities
and better pay for its employees.
   FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said the review time for totally new
drugs is longer than for other drugs because they are more
complicated to process. He also said it includes about six months
during which the agency waits for more information it requests from
drug sponsors.
   Mossinghoff also said that while the generic drug scandal has
been a ``major distraction'' at the agency, it does not appear to
have hampered the processing of applications to sell generica
drugs, which are copies of drugs on which patents have expired.
   However, it did more than halve the number of generic drugs
approved last year. In 1989, 265 generic drugs were approved,
compared with 684 in 1988.
   Jay Molishever, spokesman for the Generic Pharmaceutical
Industry Association, said the result is a ``clogging of the
pipeline'' that is hurting consumers as well as innocent generic
drug companies.
   ``It should return to normal levels,'' he said. ``How quickly
that happens, we don't have an indication yet, but definitely we
think the low point has been reached.''
   The scandal has seen convictions of three generic drug company
executives and bribe-taking convictions of three FDA employees. The
investigation also uncovered evidence that some drug companies had
cheated on FDA safety tests, prompting recalls of dozens of generic
drugs, including clones of some popular drugs.
   Drug makers won approval to sell 23 new drugs last year,
compared with 20 in 1988. During the past decade, the highest
number of approvals in one year was 30 in 1985 and the lowest was
14 in 1983.
   The drugs in this category are considered ``new molecular
entities,'' which means they are not related in chemical structure
to existing drugs.
   Overall, the FDA approved a total of 87 new drugs, most of which
are chemically related to drugs already on the market, and 113
products not counted as drugs, such as vaccines, called
``biological products'' by the agency.
   In 1988, the agency approved 67 new drugs and 41 biologics.

   Accounting Today said Ernst &amp; Young asked the
newsletter Wednesday to return secret documents about the
accounting giant, which won a court order halting their publication
at another newsletter last week.
   Accounting Today, a twice-monthly newsletter based in New York,
said it had no plans to return the documents and would publish them
in its Feb. 5 edition, mailed to subscribers Jan. 30.
   ``We got a nice note from them today, hand-delivered, to return
the documents and not to talk about them,'' said Robert Crane,
Accounting Today editor. ``We will not respond. We will plan to go
ahead with what we intended to do anyway.''
   The documents, evidently leaked by someone inside the Big Six
accounting company, apparently contain sensitive details about
compensation to the partners of Ernst &amp; Whinney and Arthur Young,
the firms that merged last June.
   Ernst &amp; Young won a court order Jan. 8 preventing Bowman's
Accounting Report of Atlanta from printing a front-page article
containing the information, just as the newsletter was going to
press. A hearing on that order by New York Supreme Court Judge
Beatrice Shainswit was scheduled for Thursday morning.
   Ernst &amp; Young officials did not immediately return telephone
calls seeking comment on Accounting Today's plans. Carl D. Liggio,
an attorney representing the accounting firm in the Bowman's case,
was in a meeting and unavailable to comment, a secretary said.
   Judge Shainswit's order only applies to Bowman's. The accounting
firm would have to get another order to stop Accounting Today from
publishing the material.
   The case has attracted enormous attention from news
organizations, which claim the judge's order violated the
constitutional guarantee of press freedom. Ernst &amp; Young claims the
issue concerns privacy rights.
   The Associated Press, New York Times, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, Wall Street Journal and other media groups
have joined Bowman's in charging that order was an unconstitutional.
   The hearing originally was scheduled for next Monday but was
expedited at the newsletter's request.
   Crane did not explain how his newsletter obtained the
information, but said he did not believe the content to be very
significant outside of the accounting profession. Crane said he
believed Ernst &amp; Young was reacting more to what the accounting
firm felt was a violation of its internal affairs.
   ``You have to keep in mind that accountants take confidentiality
very seriously,'' Crane said. ``In this instance, one of their own
leaked proprietary information.''

<TEXT>
   Holiday Corp. shareholders gave
overwhelming approval Wednesday to the $2.2 billion sale of the
Holiday Inns motel chain in the United States to Bass PLC of Great
Britain.
   Holiday Inns, which became known as ``America's innkeeper'' was
begun in Memphis in 1952.
   Michael D. Rose, chairman of Holiday Corp., Holiday Inns'
corporate parent, said he expects the sale to be completed within a
month, although state gaming commissions in New Jersey and Nevada
still must give their approval.
   After the sale, Holiday Corp. is to spin off a new company to
run its profitable Harrah's Casino-Hotels and its newer hotel
brands, Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn and Homewood Suites.
   The new corporation will be called The Promus Companies Inc. and
its shareholders are to draw a $30 cash dividend. Holiday Corp.
shareholders also will get one-quarter share of Bass stock for each
of their Holiday shares.
   ``We're obviously delighted with the shareholder vote,'' Rose
said. ``We anticipated the vote would be this way and now the next
step is to get to closing and to send out the dividends and start
our future as The Promus Companies.''
   The Holiday shareholder vote was 16.7 million for the sale and
69,684 against, with 251,504 shares abstaining.
   With the sale, Bass will acquire 55 owned or leased properties
as well as franchise agreements and other management arrangements
covering 1,400 Holiday Inn hotels in North America.
   Bass has more than 7,300 pubs and restaurants in the United
Kingdom. The company brews Bass, Carling Black Label and other
beers and has annual sales approaching $6 billion.
   It bought the rights to franchise Holiday Inns outside North
America in 1988 and currently owns 14 Holiday Inns in the
southeastern United States. Bass is a major Holiday Inn franchisee
in Canada.

   Ameritech reported on Wednesday a 7.1 percent
profit increase for the final quarter of 1989, and a tiny advance
for the year.
   ``This past year saw increased calling volumes in our regulated
business and continued healthy growth in our unregulated
businesses,'' said William L. Weiss, chairman and chief executive
officer.
   For the quarter, net income increased to $331.7 million, or
$1.22 a share, from $309.7 million, or $1.15 a share, during the
final three months of 1988. Revenue rose to $2.6 billion from $2.5
billion.
   Earnings for the year were $1.238 billion, or $4.59 a share, up
from $1.237 billion, or $4.55 a share, in 1988. Revenues in 1989
were $10.2 billion, compared with $9.9 billion the previous year.
   Ameritech is the parent of Bell companies serving Illinois,
Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.

   The nation's general aviation manufacturers
shipped 1,535 planes in 1989, a 27 percent increase over the 1,212
aircraft delivered in 1988, the industry's trade association
reported on Wednesday.
   This is far below, however, the 17,050 piston and jet aircraft
delivered in the peak year of 1979.
   D. Larry Moore, chairman of the General Aviation Manufacturers
Association, told a news conference that because the industry
shipped fewer large jets and more single-engine piston aircraft
last year, net billings fell to $1.8 billion, six percent less than
the $1.9 billion reported in 1988.
   Moore noted that a decade ago the industry shipped more than
16,000 piston aircraft, more than 14 times the number of such
planes shipped in 1989.
   ``The primary cause of this decline in unit shipments is the
product liability crisis, which continues to damage the industry,''
Moore said.

<HEAD>Alcoa Earnings Drop 24 Percent in Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aluminum Co. of America said Wednesday its
earnings dropped 24 percent in the fourth quarter, partly due to a
decline in shipments and an increase in the cost of raw materials.
   Alcoa, the world's largest producer of aluminum, operates in 18
countries.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, Alcoa's net profit fell to
$164.7 million, or $1.88 a share, from $218.7 million, or $2.47 a
share, in the fourth quarter of 1988.
   The decline occurred despite a 2 percent increase in
fourth-quarter revenue to $2.69 billion from $2.65 billion.
   Alcoa Chairman Paul H. O'Neill said the earnings erosion
reflected the continuing trend of an economic slowdown that began
in mid-1988.
   The company also attributed the fourth-quarter drop to lower
prices for ingots, the molds in which metals are cast, and for most
fabricated products.
   ``Operations in Australia and Brazil accounted for 42 percent of
Alcoa's 1989 earnings compared with 25 percent in the prior year,
mainly due to strong prices for alumina and ingot for most of the
year,'' O'Neill said.
   Alcoa owns 51 percent of Alcoa of Australia, the world's largest
producer of alumina, or aluminum oxide.
   Alcoa's fourth-quarter shipments decreased 6 percent to 635,000
metric tons from 676,000 in the same period of 1988.
   For all of 1989, the company's net profit rose nearly 10 percent
to a record $944.9 million, or $10.67 a share, from $861.4 million,
or $9.74 a share.
   Full-year revenue increased to $11.16 billion from $9.93 billion
in 1988.

<HEAD>Phillips Announces $280 Million Writedown; Earnings Expected to
Drop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARTLESVILLE, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Phillips Petroleum Co. will take a
$280 million after-tax writedown on its offshore California
investments that will cause the company's fourth-quarter earnings
to plunge, company officials said Wednesday.
   ``We regrettably must take this step, even though production of
California's offshore resources could help slow the nation's
growing dependence on imported oil,'' said C.J. Silas, Phillips
chairman and chief executive officer.
   The investments include the oil-rich Point Arguello field off
the coast of Santa Barbara, Calif., which could hold as many as 500
million barrels of oil. Phillips holds 40 percent and 50 percent
interests in the blocks that are part of the field.
   Silas said the writedown was prompted by delays in getting
regulatory approval to transport oil from the field by tanker.
Those delays are largely the result of opposition by several area
environmental groups.
   He said the writedown applies to Phillips' interests in Point
Arguello and associated production, transportation and onshore
processing facilities, suspended exploratory wells in the Rocky
Point field and some other offshore California leases in which
Phillips has interests.
   ``Suspension of the project can only further increase the U.S.
trade deficit and have a negative effect on the economy,'' Silas
said in a news release.
   Silas said the writedown will be charged against fourth-quarter
1989 earnings, which will be released Jan. 25.

   John T. Geldermann on Wednesday was re-elected
chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   He was selected to his second consecutive one-year term by the
exchange's Board of Governors in an unchallenged election.
   While Geldermann's election was unchallenged, there was a
spirited contest for the chairmanship of the cross-town Chicago
Board of Trade.
   The members of the board on Tuesday re-elected Karsten ``Cash''
Mahlmann to his fourth consecutive one-year term. He defeated
Leslie Rosenthal _ 630-524.
   Geldermann, 64, has served on the Merc's Board of Governors
since 1968 and was its chairman from 1974 to 1975.
   With his father, Godfrey J. Geldermann, he cofounded the firm
that is now Geldermann Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConAgra
and a clearing member firm of the Mercantile Exchange, the nation's
second largest futures market.
   The tradition at the Merc in recent times has been for the Board
of Governors to select a chairman for three consecutive one-year
terms.

<HEAD>CenTrust Says Proposed Merger With New York Thrift Dropped</HEAD>

   CenTrust Bank, Florida's largest savings and loan,
said Wednesday that it is calling off a proposed merger with New
York-based Ensign Bank because the two struggling thrifts were
uncertain of government approval.
   But CenTrust said it plans to continue its attempt to gain
regulatory approval of its proposed sale of 63 of its 71 branches
to Great Western Bank in Beverly Hills, Calif.
   CenTrust has said the proposed merger with Ensign, a thrift with
eight offices in South Florida, would have placed the combined
institutions near, but still short of, federal capital requirements.
   The latest development came a day after Miami-based CenTrust
reported a net loss of $97.3 million in the fourth quarter.
   CenTrust said the proposed merger would have resulted in the
formation of a new, restructured holding company and a capital
infusion from Hamilton Holding Co., the parent of Ensign Bank.
   Ensign is owned by Miami billionaire Ted Arison, the majority
owner of the Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines and the NBA's Miami
Heat.
   Both thrifts decided it would be best to terminate the proposed
merger because they were uncertain it would be approved by the
federal Office of Thrift Supervision, CenTrust said in a statement
Wednesday.
   CenTrust and Ensign will each file separate capital plans in
connection with federal capital requirements, according to the
statement. CenTrust said it expected its capital plan to include
the proposed sale of the 63 branches.
   On Tuesday, CenTrust Chairman David L. Paul said the large
fourth-quarter loss was partly due to government-ordered
``excessive'' loss reserves on securities and to overall thrift
industry problems.
   The loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30 compared with a loss of
$2.7 million for the same quarter in 1988.
   CenTrust, which said it had assets totaling $9 billion Sept. 30,
also reported a loss of $119.5 million for fiscal 1989. That
compared with a profit of $50.1 million the previous year.
   Some analysts predicted more large losses were in CenTrust's
future.
   ``I believe these numbers could go even higher,'' said Miami
banking consultant Ken Thomas. ``As of Dec. 31, I believe they may
have to write off another $100 million.''
   CenTrust has been ordered by regulators to sell its expensive
art collection, a yacht and limousines, all used by Paul. The OTS,
which recently slapped Paul with a cease and desist order, has
alleged he squandered CenTrust's assets on such things as corporate
aircraft, the yacht and hefty salaries.

<HEAD>Christmas Freeze Cost Florida Citrus Growers $400 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida citrus growers lost more than $400
million from the Christmas freeze, and the lower crop and juice
yields decimated the industry's control of the U.S. orange juice
market, according to a state economic report released Wednesday.
   The two-day freeze cut Florida's orange crop to its smallest in
25 years. The freeze reduced the crop by 29 percent to 92 million
boxes and the grapefruit crop by nearly 14 percent to 38 million
boxes, according to the state Department of Citrus report.
   The early-season freeze over the Christmas weekend crippled the
industry because more than 80 percent of the crop, then estimated
at 174 million boxes, had not been harvested.
   ``As a result of Florida's reduced crop prospects in 1989-90,
Florida is expected to supply less than one-half of the orange
juice required by the U.S. market in the forthcoming season,'' said
Bob Behr, the economic and market research director for the state
agency.
   Last season, Florida citrus and its related industries brought
in an estimated $8.5 billion in revenue.
   The smaller crop and lower juice yield means Florida can supply
about 40 percent of the U.S. orange juice market, down from its 71
percent share a year ago, said Behr, who updated the 1989-90 citrus
outlook for the Florida Citrus Commission during the commission's
meeting here.
   Florida's share of the market will be offset by Brazilian
imports. Brazil supplied about 35 percent of the market a year ago
and will easily supply more than 50 percent this year, Behr said.
   ``Supply should be sufficient to meet the market, but supplies
will be slightly less than what was available last year,'' Behr
said. ``I don't really see a major shortage of orange juice.''
   While wholesale prices for frozen concentrated orange juice
supplied by private-label companies have risen about 27 percent
from levels prior to the freeze, retail prices are expected to rise
modestly by about 8 percent. The higher prices are not expected to
deter most consumers and consumption is expected to fall just 1.2
percent, Behr said.
   Florida's citrus industry has been hit by several freezes this
decade, with the tree-killing cold of 1983 and 1985 cutting the
state's citrus-production by more than 200,000 acres.
   In Lake Wales, U.S. Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., told state citrus
leaders he opposed any reduction in the tariff on Brazilian citrus
imports.
   ``Florida citrus has suffered enough,'' Graham said. ``The
freeze was bad enough. We don't want to drown in imports.''
   The Brazilians have asked for a 50 percent reduction in the
tariff, but Graham is urging President Bush not to reduce it.
