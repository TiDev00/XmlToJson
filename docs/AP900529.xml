   Perhaps nowhere in Europe will there
be as much interest in this week's summit meeting between George
Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev as in the two Germanys _ East and West.
   With 380,000 Soviet troops stationed in East Germany and 250,000
U.S. troops in West Germany, the two nations that are about to
become one have the keenest interest in superpower negotiations to
drastically reduce foreign forces stationed on their soil.
   Along with the troops, some of the world's deadliest weapons are
kept on German soil: high-tech jet fighters; nuclear-tipped,
short-range rockets; and thousands of atomic artillery shells.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III said earlier this
month that it was up to Germans to decide ``the internal aspects''
of unification. On troop levels, Baker said outsiders could become
involved in the discussions, but here, too, the Germans were in
charge of their future.
   The troop negotiations, being conducted in Vienna, Austria, by
NATO and the Warsaw Pact, have been flagging and will be one of the
prime topics when Bush and Gorbachev meet for four days in
Washington, beginning Thursday.
   Bush himself said last week that ``the talks haven't gone as far
or as fast as I would like to see. ... Maybe we can find some way
at the summit, or before the summit, to move CFE (the talks)
forward.''
   U.S. officials have said they feel Moscow is reluctant to
conclude a Conventional Forces in Europe treaty unless there are
assurances that the large West Germany army will not pose a threat
after unification.
   One U.S. official, who requested anonymity, said recently that
it would be difficult to complete a treaty this year because of the
German issue and also because of Soviet concerns about the
steadfastness of the East European allies.
   The day before Bush spoke, however, Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze said after meeting with his West German
counterpart, Hans Dietrich Genscher, that Moscow ``advocates an
acceleration in the Vienna negotiations.''
   West German officials were quoted in Geneva, where the two men
met, as saying the U.S. perception of Soviet hesitancy on the
treaty might be a misunderstanding.
   Shevardnadze himself, asked if could confirm the purported
Soviet position on the German military, replied, ``No.''
   In December, the two superpowers agreed to slash their central
European forces to 195,000 each, with the United States allowed to
keep an additional 30,000 troops in Britain and southern Europe.
There are now 305,000 U.S. troops and an estimated 565,000 Soviet
troops in Europe.
   Looking toward the summit, Capt. Stefan Lang, a spokesman for
the West German Defense Ministry, commented recently, ``We hope
important signals in the direction of arms controls come out of the
summit, but what exactly they will be we don't know.''
   No one is more eager for major superpower cutbacks than the
Germans.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government says it wants
the eventual complete removal of Soviet and U.S. short-range
nuclear weapons from German soil.
   ``We believe that the Lance (missile) and nuclear artillery have
lost most of their significance, and therefore there should be
thoughts about how these rockets can be negotiated away,'' Lang
told The Associated Press.
   He stressed, however, that the Lance missiles should be removed
only in negotiations, because ``the Soviets still have a huge
superiority in this area. This should occur in a balanced way.''
   An agreement to reduce conventional forces would open the way to
negotiations on the superpowers' nuclear arsenals in Europe.
   Washington and the other NATO allies have said they are ready
for talks with the Soviets on the short-range nuclear weapons, most
of which are based in Germany.
   But NATO has not taken a clear stand on negotiating the numbers
of these weapons down to zero.
   A feud could break out within NATO if attempts are made to
replace short-range nuclear weapons in West Germany with
air-launched rockets.
   ``I am warning against a new atomic arms race. New weapons are
not needed,'' Genscher said recently.
   The future of NATO, and of American troops in Europe, could
become a bone of contention as well.
   Some West German politicians, including Genscher, have warmed up
to the Soviets' idea of creating new ``European security
structures'' to take the place of NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   But Washington and other NATO partners say they are vehemently
against replacing NATO.
   The Social Democrats, Kohl's main political rivals, have also
said NATO and the Warsaw Pact should be transformed into a new,
Europe-wide security arrangement.
   The Social Democrats are pressing NATO to make major changes
that would better reflect the rapid waning of the once-mighty,
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   ``It would be very good if the Americans prepared the way for
this with constructive proposals (during the summit),'' Horst
Ehmke, disarmament expert for the Social Democrats, said.

<DATELINE>KARAUL, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a windswept hill fragrant with
prairie sage, the daughter of a Utah sheep rancher passed
photographs of nuclear bomb blasts to the Kazakhs crowded around
her. Eyes widened.
   ``We have seen such mushroom clouds from here, too,'' said a
grizzled man in this Central Asia ranch town.
   Just like Janet Gordon's hometown of Cedar City, Utah, Karaul is
125 miles downwind from the spot where the government routinely
tests nuclear bombs underground.
   Mrs. Gordon, 300 other foreign anti-nuclear activists and the
people of Karaul on Sunday shared stories of death and disease they
blame on radiation caused by the testing. They were taking part in
a four-day conference of anti-nuclear activists from 21 countries.
   Atmospheric testing was conducted by the Americans and Soviets
until it was banned under a bilateral treaty in 1963. Some
radiation may have drifted across the border from above-ground
testing in China until 1980.
   ``My father died,'' one Kazakh in an embroidered Moslem cap said
to Mrs. Gordon.
   Under the old man's banner, which read, ``We are nuclear
victims, too,'' a young mother grasped her little boy's shoulder.
   ``My son was sick until he was four years old,'' she said. ``He
could not walk without falling down.''
   ``I came to Kazahkstan to meet people like you,'' Mrs. Gordon
replied.
   On the Central Asian steppe, similar to areas of Nevada near the
U.S. test zone, activists traded fears, research and political
strategy with local residents who in just one year have been
transformed from silent victims to successful protesters.
   Soviet activists formed the Nevada-Semipalatinsk anti-nuclear
movement, named for test sites in the two countries. They exerted
enough pressure that the Soviet government has not conducted an
underground nuclear blast at Semipalatinsk since October.
   Soviet authorities have not agreed to a moratorium. But the
activists' meeting apparently had top-level approval, since the
zone next to the test range is normally closed to foreigners. But
police and security officials kept the group under tight control.
   ``This is my brother,'' Mrs. Gordon, 53, told the Kazakhs
crowded around her photographs. ``He was watching our sheep when
the cloud of radiation came over in 1954. He got burns on his arms,
and his hair fell out. The sheep died. His horse died.''
   Four years later, her teen-age brother had cancer of the
pancreas. He died after four years, Mrs. Gordon said. The Kazakhs
told stories of relatives crippled, retarded or sickly.
   In the 1950s, historian Amantai Isin recalled his family lived
in a village within the boundaries of the test site. Officials
would take them away during a blast but bring them back home the
same day. No one ever suggested not drinking the milk from the
family cows.
   After one great blast in 1954, Isin's 5-year-old brother came
down with a terrible headache and died. His father and another
brother both died in their 30s, he said. Isin is 39.
   The activists traded grisly statistics.
   Mrs. Gordon said 13 of 17 children born in one year in the 1950s
in Cedar City, Utah had birth defects.
   Dr. Mayra Zhangelova, director of the Semipalatinsk Medical
Institute, said birth defects per 10,000 births in the Soviet areas
nearly tripled from 11.8 in 1980 to 29.2 in 1985.
   Foreign scientists in the group said the evidence of correlation
to nuclear testing is strong but cannot be proved because of the
time lag.
   Mrs. Gordon pulled out another photo, showing a plume pouring
from the earth in 1970. The Kazakhs were shocked. This was long
after both the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to keep
all blasts underground.
   ``It was an accident,'' she explained. ``But accidents can
happen.''
   ``We also fear this,'' the crowd chimed in.
   ``Do you think there will be action on this at the summit?''
asked one Kazakh woman, referring to Wednesday's meeting between
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush in
Washington.
   Mrs. Gordon replied that a U.S. ambassador had told her ``no.''
She said she infuriated the official by calling for nuclear tests
underneath the Pentagon.
   ``That's great!'' beamed a Kazakh woman, reaching out to shake
her hand.

   For some students of history, the sense of deja vu
is chilling: weakening central power faces discontent among ethnic
groups, disgruntled workers and mutually suspicious intellectuals
arrayed in myriad political parties.
   A cumbersome and ideology-laden bureaucracy finds it easier to
stick to its old ways than to reform.
   With some vital differences, Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1990 faces
many of the same bewildering problems that caused the czarist
empire to come crashing down around Nicholas II in the spring of
1917, and the provisional government of Alexander Kerensky to fall
to the Bolsheviks that autumn.
   For Gorbachev, the warning is sounded in the official press,
over tea at the kitchen table, and in the Congress of People's
Deputies, where 84-year-old scholar Dmitri Likhachev warned against
a nationwide presidential election.
   ``I remember the revolution of February (1917) very well, and I
know where emotions can lead,'' Likhachev told parliament in March.
``Understand our conditions. Direct election of the president will
lead to civil war.''
   Writer Andranik Migranyan said in the weekly Literaturnaya
Gazeta: ``Really, you can come to despair from the thought that in
this country, everything repeats itself.''
   Gorbachev's most stubborn problems are ethnic disputes and
economic dislocation, familiar problems for pre-revolutionary
leaders.
   The fringe areas of the Russian Empire that escaped during the
turmoil of the revolution only to be patiently gathered in again by
Stalin are asserting their independence. Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia are leading the way.
   The economy is in disarray. Industrial production fell 1.2
percent in the first three months of 1990. Strikes last summer by
thousands of coal miners finally broke the long Communist
prohibition against job actions.
   Regardless of legality, 130,000 people were on strike on any
given day in the first quarter of the year. Store shelves are empty
and people are angry.
   Strike committees still are active in many cities. At a recent
meeting, representatives of about 50 of them declared a lack of
confidence in the government's ability to reform the economy.
   Just as the Bolsheviks agitated for the overthrow of the czarist
government and then Kerensky's provisional government, dozens of
new political parties now are pressing to push the Communists out
of power.
   The Soviet leader's opponents hark back to 1917 to argue that 72
years of Communist rule has brought the country little but ruin.
   In 1917, ``All Power to the Soviets'' was the slogan under which
Lenin's legions took power. In 1990, protesters march with the same
banner, demanding that the Communist Party bureaucracy turn power
over to an elected parliament.
   ``The goal of a new party must not be to work within the system
but to break up the system,'' Nikolai Travkin, a former Communist,
told supporters of his drive to form an anti-Communist group.
   Repeating the experience of the past, the new parties often
cannot agree on their own program much less a common front. Russian
Social Democrats meeting in Moscow in early May spent much of their
time debating whether local chapters would have to obey central
authority.
   Such disputes paralyzed the Russian political system before the
Bolshevik revolution and gave Lenin's highly disciplined minority
the opening it needed to seize power.
   But there are important differences between 1917 and 1990.
   Many historians argue that czarist Russia, despite its archaic
political system, could have been transformed peacefully if not for
World War I, which began in 1914.
   The Russian economy was expanding rapidly, farm output was
growing, and expenditures for education were increasing.
   The war exposed fatal weaknesses in political and economic
administration, which led not only to military losses but severe
food shortages in the cities, they argue.
   Gorbachev has resolutely avoided military conflicts. He has
pulled Soviet soldiers out of Afghanistan, concluded arms control
agreements with the West and started pulling soldiers out of
Eastern Europe in order to spend more of the country's resources on
the domestic economy.
   In contrast to Nicholas II and Kerensky, Gorbachev is a
consummate inside politician, master of the system in which he has
worked for more than 30 years.
   He has patiently isolated and eliminated his Communist Party
foes and stands alone now atop both the government and party
apparatus.
   Nevertheless, critics charge that he is dangerously late in
making key reforms, and that he does not fully understand the
country he governs.
   Vyacheslav Shostakovsky, rector of Moscow's Higher Party School
and a leading party reformer, said Gorbachev is isolated by the
party's inability to give him a real understanding of what people
are feeling.
   ``His rare trips don't give him the emotional coloring,''
Shostakovsky said in an interview. ``That's why he was shocked by
the May 1 events'' when protesters marched past him in a May Day
parade and shouted their criticisms.
   If Gorbachev had understood the mood of the people, he would
have been able to anticipate the angry reaction, Shostakovsky said.
   But Gorbachev consistently has shown a strong streak of realism.
   In February, less than two months after rejecting the idea, he
led the party into accepting a multiparty system. At the same time
the party adopted the principle of private property, and a new law
going into effect on July 1 will allow Soviet entrepreneurs to hire
labor.
   Speaking to reporters last week at a Moscow parliamentary
session, Gorbachev indicated he sees in his reforms a comparison
with Lenin in the first years of Soviet power.
   ``Take any sphere, everywhere we are hindered by complexes,'' he
said. ``People are saying, `Chaos, chaos, collapse, collapse.' When
Lenin watched a similar revolutionary process, he said, `You know,
this chaos will crystallize a new form of life.'''
   ``We remain committed to the choice made in October 1917, the
socialist idea,'' Gorbachev told the Communist Party Central
Committee in February. ``But we are moving away from its dogmatic
interpretation, refusing to sacrifice the people's real interests
to rigid schemes.''
   In 1990, once again, the Communists' opponents are split. The
19-million member party is by far the largest and best organized
force in the country. It controls most media, has experienced party
workers, and owns buildings and bank accounts.
   But the Communists face a split themselves. Conservatives
forming a Russian Communist Party declared in a manifesto published
May 13 that ``during the time of perestroika the economic situation
in the country has been so aggravated that the existence of
socialism, and the sovereignty of our government have been placed
under threat.''
   Shostakovsky said that unless Gorbachev pushes the party to
radically reform itself at its 28th Congress this summer, he and
many other progressives will quit.
   The party's dilemma is largely its own fault, Shostakovsky said
in an interview with the newspaper Soyuz. Despite the unpleasant
analogy with 1917, the party acts as though times have not changed,
he said.
   The Communist Party ``first and foremost has remained a
semi-military organization,'' he said. ``But outside the window,
it's not 1917 any more!''

<HEAD>Measure Doubling Gas Tax Tops California Ballot Measures</HEAD>

   Voters in the tax-revolt state are
being asked to double gasoline taxes to keep highway traffic moving.
   California voters face June 5 ballot topics ranging from
mountain lion hunting to legislative ethics, with the gas tax hike
aimed at raising $18.5 billion topping the list.
   Proposition 111 would double the 9-cents-a-gallon tax on fuel
over five years to finance the largest transportation investment in
state history. The $18.5 billion would pay for new highway and
railway construction aimed at thwarting freeway gridlock.
   A companion ballot measure sponsored by Gov. George Deukmejian
would authorize a $1 billion bond issue just for rail transit
construction. Environmentalists are pressing a similar but more
generous measure that would provide $1.99 billion.
   Also on the ballot:
   _ a proposal to rewrite ethics guidelines for the Legislature,
which has been rocked by a federal corruption probe. Critics call
it a lawmakers' pay raise in disguise.
   _ a proposed mountain lion hunting ban, pushed by
environmentalists but criticized by opponents who say the $30
million a year it would set aside for wildlife protection would
divert money from more deserving programs.
   _ a plan to alter state justice system guidelines that critics
call an attack on abortion rights.
   _ a pair of measures that would change how legislative district
boundaries are drawn.
   In all, the seven bond measures on the California ballot total a
record $5 billion. In addition to the two rail transit bond issue
proposals, voters are being asked to approve bonds for low-income
housing, public schools, state universities, and prisons, and to
make state and local government buildings earthquake safe.
   The tax hike, Proposition 111, is backed by a bipartisan
coalition of government, business and labor interests who forged
the plan to combat deepening transportation woes.
   With less than two weeks before voting, the tax hike backers'
internal polls showed a 7-point lead, compared with a 13-point
margin in an independent poll taken in early May, according to
published reports.
   Supporters say the gas tax increase is needed because road and
rail construction have lagged in face of rising population. Drivers
statewide waste more than 400,000 hours a day because the average
urban highway speed has fallen to about 20 mph during commute hours.
   Planners fear future growth could broaden daily gridlock. In the
next decade, the number of licensed drivers is expected to rise 18
percent.
   Strategists have been cheered by the lack of organized
opposition, but the measure asks voters to raise their own taxes in
a state that revolted against taxes, beginning with landmark
property tax-slashing Proposition 13 in 1978.
   Proposition 11 is the measure that has been criticized by
abortion rights activists. Supporters say it is aimed at limiting
the rights of accused criminals to those stipulated by the
Constitution. They say it would speed up prosecution and increase
punishment powers.
   But foes say the proposition would erode a woman's right to
abortion by eliminating privacy assurances in the state
constitution.
   The state Supreme Court has interpreted the state constitution
to give defendants greater rights than those granted in federal
courts.
   Proposition 117 would ban the sport hunting of mountain lions
and create a new program, funded with $30 million a year over the
next three decades, for buying and restoring wildlife areas.
   Some environmental groups say it is needed to protect wildlife
and wouldn't increase taxes, but opponents, including hunters
groups, say the animals aren't in danger and the bill would take
money away from existing programs.
   Propositions 118 and 119 address reapportionment. The boundary
remapping is required by the state constitution every 10 years to
balance populations among districts.
   Critics of the existing reapportionment system, in which
Legislature-approved plans are submitted for gubernatorial
approval, say it has allowed Democrats to maintain their dominance.
Democrats counter that the proposals would unfairly enhance
Republican interests.
   Proposition 118 would require that plans approved by the
Legislature be submitted to voters. Proposition 119 would require
that redistricting plans approved by an independent citizens
commission go before the electorate.
   Proposition 112, the ethics reform law, would form a commission
to set lawmakers' salaries, taking that task away from legislators.
   The measure was prompted in large part by an FBI undercover
corruption probe that led to the conviction and resignation of one
senator. A former senator remains under indictment.
   Supporters argue that it would reduce the influence of special
interests, but foes say the measure would make it easier for
legislators to get a pay raise without voting on it.
   Propositions rounding out the ballot would give the governor
more time to consider bills after legislative sessions, would
exempt the severely disabled from property tax increases when they
move into a new home, would change chiropractor licensing
procedures, and would expand instances in which the death penalty
could be imposed for murder of peace officers.

   People caught by Hurricane Hugo last
year might disagree, but forecasters here say the deadly storm may
have had a positive side effect _ it got the public's attention.
   And one forecaster says hurricane seasons may be getting worse.
   Hugo, which caused an unprecedented $10 billion in damage,
killed 28 people in the Lesser Antilles islands and an additional
29 in South Carolina.
   But it would have been much more deadly if it had hit almost
anywhere else, says Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane
Center.
   At the advent of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from
June 1 to Nov. 30, Sheets and other hurricane experts are using
Hugo's example to get the attention of complacent coastal residents
who've never experienced such fury.
   ``We'll take advantage of the fact that there was a Hugo last
year and raise people's awareness,'' said Sheets. ``The
consequences of not being prepared are too great.''
   Early warnings about Hugo last September allowed 350,000 people
to evacuate safely, and in South Carolina the worst of the
hurricane struck the Francis Marion National Forest between
Charleston and Myrtle Beach, Sheets said.
   It heavily damaged the fishing village of McClellanville and
several small rural communities, but the population there is sparse.
   If Hugo had struck a major coastal population center, the
destruction would have been greater than most Americans have ever
seen, according to computer simulations known as SLOSH models, for
Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes.
   With SLOSH, forecasters can predict the height of the storm
surge _ the mass of water piled up by the storm that is a
hurricane's most destructive component _ anywhere along the U.S.
coast by punching in a storm's speed, size and intensity, Sheets
said.
   ``The population density in South Carolina is a lot different
from the Florida coast, New Jersey or Galveston, Texas,'' Sheets
said. ``Compare that situation to the Miami-through-Palm Beach area
_ all of Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties would have been ...
destroyed.''
   Hugo was the worst hurricane to strike the southeastern U.S.
coast since Betsy hit the Florida Keys in 1965, killing 74 before
it went on to Missisippi and Louisiana. Since then, the population
of areas such as south Florida has ballooned and most residents
have never directly experienced a hurricane.
   According to one of the nation's leading hurricane experts, Hugo
may have been the first in a new era of killer storms.
   ``No one knows for sure, but the odds are, Florida and the East
Coast are going to get it,'' William Gray, professor of atmospheric
science at Colorado State University, told a national conference of
weather experts this month.
   Gray came to this conclusion after his usually accurate
predictions for hurricane activity were off the mark last year. He
had figured the 1989 season would be relatively mild, with only
four hurricanes; instead, seven hurricanes and four tropical storms
killed a total of 84 people.
   ``He blew it pretty bad,'' Sheets said. ``But then he looked at
the rainfall over Africa, and found an amazing correlation between
rainfall there and hurricane activity over Florida.''
   Gray realized the 30-year drought in Africa's Sahel region
corresponds almost exactly to the years when no major hurricanes
have struck the southeastern coast.
   ``Whether one causes the other is uncertain. They both may
reflect larger-scale events. But the Sahel is now getting up to
near-normal rainfall,'' Sheets said.
   Gray plans to release his predictions for 1990 on June 5.
   Tropical storms have been recorded in the Atlantic in every
month except April, but are rare outside the June 1 to Nov. 30
season. Last week, a preseason tropical depression brought heavy
rain to Cuba.
   A tropical depression becomes a tropical storm and is given a
name if its sustained winds reach 39 mph; it becomes a hurricane if
winds reach 74 mph.
   The names for Atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms this year
are: Arthur, Bertha, Cesar, Diana, Edouard, Fran, Gustav, Hortense,
Isidore, Josephine, Klaus, Lili, Marco, Nana, Omar, Paloma, Rene,
Sally, Teddy, Vicky and Wilfred.

   The start of the Atlantic hurricane
season this week is a time of anxiety for many victims of last
year's Hurricane Hugo.
   ``A lot of people are just barely back on their feet, if they
are at all, and the thought that something like this could happen
again is just frightening to them,'' said Veronique Aniel, a
counselor with the statewide Hurricane Hugo Outreach Program.
   The hurricane season begins Friday and runs through Nov. 30.
   Hurricane Hugo smashed ashore last Sept. 21 with 135 mph wind
and a 19-foot storm surge that caused an estimated $5.9 billion
damage and killed 29 people in South Carolina. While most
structures in Charleston have been cleaned and repaired, recovery
in outlying areas has taken longer.
   Officials of the state Department of Mental Health, which
operates the outreach program, say as many as 20,000 South
Carolinians suffering post-traumatic stress syndrome are expected
to develop long-term psychological problems as a result of the
storm.
   ``We're anticipating stress because of the anniversary coming up
and because of the hurricane season starting,'' said Linda Lane, a
counselor in Berkeley County, one of the outlying areas hard-hit by
the storm.
   ``We have children who are having difficulty in school when the
rain or wind is blowing more than normal,'' she said.
   Some people will experience fear when the weather is similar to
those before the storm, said Dr. Michael Foxworth, a psychiatrist
who is medical director at Charter Hospital of Charleston.
   ``I think the emotional damage a person suffered in Hugo
probably relates ... primarily to the duration of time their lives
were totally out of their control,'' he said.
   ``The person who had time to evacuate and get to a safe place
and then pretty quickly returned to their normal environment
suffered less psychological impact than those who were totally
without resources,'' he said.
   Foxworth said people will be watching weather reports and
tracking hurricanes more closely this year.
   Before Hugo there was a sense of denial about hurricanes, a
feeling that ``it can't happen here,'' he said.
   ``Now that it has, things swing the other way and it becomes a
sense of expectancy that it will happen again ... even though the
odds are probably no greater this year than before Hugo,'' he said.
   Some people say they will leave Charleston and never return if
another storm hits, Ms. Aniel said. Others deny another storm could
even happen.
   ``Some people don't even want to talk about it. They want to
ignore the fact. If another one comes this way, what will these
people do?'' she said.
   But the fact Charleston has recently been hit by a storm would
make a future evacuation easier.
   ``You've experienced a bad hurricane and it's fresh in people's
minds,'' said Mark Zimmer of the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables, Fla. ``There won't be any difficulty convincing people it's
a real threat.''

<HEAD>West Berlin Planning Visas For Poles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Berlin plans to require visiting
Poles to obtain visas in an attempt to curb the city's burgeoning
black market, a spokesman for the federal government says.
   Roland Bachmaier, an Interior Ministry spokesman, said Monday
that the Western allies, the West Berlin government and the West
German government have been discussing the idea, but no date has
been set.
   On Sunday, the West Berlin Morgenpost newspaper said the
requirement would take effect July 1 and also apply to other
Eastern Europeans.
   The paper said West Berlin authorities were concerned about the
growing black market in the city, for which they blame visitors
from Poland and other East European countries.
   A large West Berlin supermarket chain last week started
restricting sales to Poles, limiting the amount of goods they can
buy in each store.
   About 120,000 Poles flock to West Berlin every week, authorities
say, many seeking jobs and trade on the black market.
   Berliner Morgenpost said Poles and other Eastern Europeans
wishing to stay in West Berlin longer than one month would have to
give ``convincing reasons'' for their stay and prove they have
enough money to fund their visit.

   A man pulled a handgun from a diaper
bag and shot to death his estranged wife and mother-in-law Monday
before shooting himself, police said.
   Dutchess County's second triple shooting in two days occurred
about 6 p.m. in a YMCA parking lot during a meeting to transfer
custody of a 10-month-old boy, Poughkeepsie police Lt. Arthur
Regula said.
   Regula said two women were dead and the man was taken to Vassar
Brothers Hospital in Poughkeepsie following the shooting. The man
apparently shot himself, he said. Police said the suspect was
seriously wounded.
   Regula said police probably would not release the victims' or
the suspect's names pending notification of next of kin. The
child's parents had been separated for about three weeks, police
said.
   Police said the man had taken the child for the holiday and was
returning the boy to his mother, who was accompanied by her own
mother. Both women were from Wappingers Falls, police said.
   Capt. John Doherty said the child's mother had asked for a
police officer to accompany her to the meeting. He said the officer
arrived first and interviewed the man, who was reportedly calm and
coherent. The officer then returned to his patrol car to watch the
exchange, Doherty said.
   The man placed the boy in a child's car seat, then returned to
his own car for a diaper bag. When he reached the mother's car
again, he pulled a .22-caliber handgun from the bag and shot the
two women and himself before the police officer could react,
Doherty said.
   The child was unhurt, police said.
   On Sunday a Hyde Park man shot and killed his wife and wounded a
neighbor before killing himself with a 12-gauge shotgun.

   He is, at 59, the oldest astronaut
to ever fly in space. And that's too old, he says, to get back in
line and wait _ hope _ for one more flight.
   As a result, Vance Brand expects the upcoming mission aboard
shuttle Columbia to be his last journey into space.
   Brand will command the seven-man crew, four of whose members are
astronomers and will operate a $150 million observatory called
Astro. Liftoff is scheduled for 12:38 a.m. EDT Wednesday.
   ``I'll probably move on to a management job, a second career if
you will, at this late date. But frankly, there isn't anything that
beats flying in space,'' Brand said in a recent interview.
   ``Being an astronaut is a great job. I suppose a lot of people
would do it until they were 90 years old if they could. But at the
same time, why I've had a lot of enjoyment out of being an
astronaut and I've had four flights. So I guess I'll maybe look at
some other work.''
   The trim, silver-haired Brand was chosen as an astronaut in 1966
after serving in the Marines as a naval aviator and later working
as a test pilot.
   Brand made his first spaceflight in 1975 on the Apollo-Soyuz
mission, in which the crews of the American and Soviet spacecraft
docked in space. He was commander of the first fully operational
flight of the shuttle system in 1982 and returned to space as a
crew commander in 1984.
   His decision to make this flight his last is a matter of
practicality.
   ``The big thing is it would be too long to stand in line to get
the next flight,'' he said.
   NASA has 86 active astronauts, two of whom are older than Brand
but have not flown for five or more years and are involved in
management _ John Young, 59, and William Thornton, 61. A class of
23 will be added to the rolls this summer.
   The oldest astronaut to fly prior to Brand was Karl Henize, who
was 58 when he flew in 1985 aboard Challenger. He is now a senior
scientist at Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   There is no mandatory retirement age for astronauts. The average
age is 41.
   ``It's about like any other job. It depends on the person's
capabilities,'' Brand said.
   For about a year, Brand served as systems project manager for
the proposed space station Freedom at Johnson Space Center. He
stepped down last fall to devote all his time to the shuttle
mission.
   That may be one of his roles within the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration once Columbia returns to Earth, he said.
   ``There are a lot of challenges'' in management, Brand said.
``So it's just that I'll have to put one switch off and put another
one on.''

<TEXT>
   Pro football veteran Phil McConkey compares
himself to the new presidents of Czechoslovakia and Nicaragua in
sizing up his chances of being elected to Congress.
   Neither Czechoslovakia's Vaclav Havel nor Nicaragua's Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro had prior elected experience, says the GOP
candidate from New Jersey.
   ``These people have what it takes to lead their people to better
times,'' he says. ``Political experience has nothing to do with
it.''
   McConkey, who describes himself as ``a skinny street kid from
Buffalo,'' is running an outsider's race against two veteran
Republicans for the chance to face Democrat Marguerite Chandler in
November. They are vying for the House seat being vacated by
Republican Rep. Jim Courter, who is retiring.
   ``I've got energy to burn. I can't be outworked or outhustled by
anybody,'' McConkey says.
   McConkey, 33, began his National Football League career as a
wide receiver with the New York Giants, who he helped to a 1986
Super Bowl victory. He most recently was with the San Diego
Chargers but has not signed a contract for 1990.
   He models himself after Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, the onetime
Buffalo Bills quarterback and former New York congressman, and puts
forth a combination of energy, fiscal conservatism and patriotism.
   Although Kemp has made no endorsement in the GOP primary, he
says he has offered a ``helping hand'' to encourage McConkey's
no-new-taxes, right-to-life bid.
   Polls show McConkey trailing state Assemblyman Rodney
Frelinghuysen and state Sen. Richard A. Zimmer in the GOP primary.
   But Richard Roper, director of the Council on New Jersey Affairs
at the Woodrow Wilson School in Princeton, N.J., said it's possible
McConkey could win if the other two candidates split the moderate
GOP vote.
   Rutgers University political scientist Steve Salmore was more
pessimistic about McConkey's chances, noting that few issues
distinguish the three candidates other than abortion, where
Frelinghuysen and Zimmer are pro-choice.
   McConkey, however, is his own cheering squad.
   ``I'm always the underdog and up against insurmountable odds,''
he said. As an example of his determination, McConkey cites his
decision to return to football at age 27 after five years as a Navy
helicopter pilot.
   McConkey, a 1979 graduate of the Naval Academy, proceeds
undaunted against Frelinghuysen, whose father once held Courter's
House seat, and Zimmer, whose state legislative district dominates
the congressional district.
   ``Pressure is landing a 10-ton helicopter on the back of a
rolling, pitching deck at night or standing under a punt in front
of 80,000 people in the stands and millions on TV with 11 maniacs
foaming at the mouth ready to decapitate you,'' he said.
   McConkey, who has put $40,000 of his own money into the
campaign, has postponed his planned June wedding and is focusing
solely on the upcoming primary.
   ``My life goes from here to June 5. If you start worrying about
things that aren't in line with your goal, it's taking away from
your energy and enthusiasm,'' he said.
   McConkey talks about attracting minorities to the party,
although Roper describes the congressional district's voters as
overwhelmingly white, moderate to middle-income Republicans.
   ``It's an issue of bringing the party back to a Lincoln party, a
party of the people,'' McConkey said. He echoes the ``politics of
inclusion'' philosophy of Kemp and former New Jersey GOP Gov.
Thomas H. Kean.
   McConkey won't discuss plans for his pro football career except
to say retirement from the Chargers has been on his mind.
   ``Football is an avocation, not a vocation,'' he said.
   His campaign has relied heavily on radio and cable television
advertising, as well as old-fashioned community campaign
appearances. He also involves sports colleagues, including former
NFL teammates Lawrence Taylor, Phil Simms and Mark Bavaro.
   Former New York Knicks guard Earl ``The Pearl'' Monroe joined
former Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann in co-hosting
McConkey's only Washington fundraiser, a $150-a-person cocktail
party last week.
   Besides his political and athletic pursuits, McConkey also has
several business ventures pending. He is part-owner of McConkey's
restaurant in his home town of Flemington and also is developing a
shopping center and awaiting a patent on an electronics timekeeping
device for sporting events.

   The United States and the Soviet Union enter
this week's summit with renewed momentum toward clinching a treaty
that for the first time would require each side to reduce the
number of long-range nuclear weapons.
   While a treaty won't be ready for formal agreement when
President Bush begins four days of meetings with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Thursday, the two men are expected to issue
a joint statement this weekend declaring the main provisions of the
pact to be settled. The details, on the other hand, could be months
away.
   Bush and Gorbachev are expected to agree to drastically reduce
their stockpiles of chemical weapons and to end production of those
weapons. In addition, they are expected to call for ratification of
two existing pacts limiting nuclear tests. U.S. and Soviet
officials met during the weekend in an effort to settle arms
control issues.
   The administration has said Bush also will press Gorbachev for a
commitment to speed up NATO-Warsaw Pact negotiations to reduce
tanks, troops and other conventional armaments in Europe. Progress
in these talks has slowed recently.
   These will be the main arms control features of the summit,
which comes almost exactly eight years after U.S. and Soviet
negotiators met in Geneva to begin the Strategic Arms Reduction
Talks.
   Yet to be settled before a START treaty can be formally signed
are anti-cheating provisions and the question of whether to limit
mobile, land-based missiles such as the Soviet SS-24 and the
proposed American Midgetman, plus a number of other, relatively
minor, points of disagreement.
   Aides to Bush and Gorbachev are set to work throughout the
summit on disputed START issues and negotiating teams in Geneva
plan to press ahead this summer in hopes of pulling the final
pieces together in time for a year-end summit signing ceremony.
Analysts say the chances of success are high.
   Bush and Gorbachev are expected to announce an agreement,
probably not in the form of a treaty, to destroy all but 5,000 tons
of each side's chemical weapons arsenal. This would be intended as
a catalyst for concluding a global ban on chemical arms in the
Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Terms for ensuring compliance
with the U.S.-Soviet deal have yet to be settled.
   The summit also is to declare the two sides' agreement on a
U.S.-Soviet protocol for verifying compliance with 1974 and 1976
treaties that limit the size of underground nuclear tests. Bush and
Gorbachev are expected to say the agreement will permit both sides
to push for legislative ratification of the treaties.
   The proposed START treaty, if completed and ratified, would
represent an important step in disarmament. It would require about
a one-third reduction in numbers of long-range nuclear weapons and
also may lead to follow-up negotiations to cut strategic nuclear
forces even further.
   Previous treaties on strategic arms, including the unratified
1979 SALT II accord, limited the growth of long-range weaponry but
did not actually reduce their numbers.
   The proposed new treaty would reduce the combined U.S. and
Soviet strategic nuclear warhead totals from about 23,500 now to
about 16,000 by the late 1990s.
   ``START makes good sense for the United States,'' Secretary of
State James A. Baker III told reporters last week in defending the
administration's negotiating record.
   Yet the proposed accord is being attacked by critics at both
ends of the U.S. political spectrum. Conservatives say it concedes
too much to the Soviets while liberals say it doesn't go far enough
in forcing a shift away from nuclear confrontation.
   Baker has come under heavy attack for dropping a longstanding
U.S. demand that the START treaty prohibit all Soviet upgrading of
its SS-18 land-based intercontinental ballistic missile, the
backbone of the Soviet strategic arsenal.
   ``It's a travesty,'' said Frank J. Gaffney Jr., director of the
Center for Security Policy, a Washington think tank. He contends
that SS-18 qualitative improvements that may be permitted under
START would offset the effects of Moscow's agreement to reduce the
number of SS-18s by 50 percent over a seven-year period.
   The treaty as now drafted would not require such drastic
reductions in any element of the U.S. strategic arsenal. The
proposed cut in U.S. ballistic missiles would be about 35 percent,
while the total number of warheads for strategic forces, including
bombers and sea-based weapons, would be 25 percent, according to
Stan Norris of the private Natural Resources Defense Council.
   Norris sees only limited value in the treaty. He argues that it
would merely codify arms cuts that both superpowers were planning
anyway because of budget pressures and aging systems.
   ``As with many past treaties, this will be arms control without
pain or sacrifice,'' he said.
   The actual size of the reductions is difficult to calculate
because no one is sure what political and financial forces will
bear on each country's military between now and the end of the
treaty's proposed seven-year implementation period. It's unclear,
for example, how many more of the new B-2 stealth bombers the
Pentagon will buy at the going rate of $815 million each.
   Jack Mendelsohn, deputy director of the private Arms Control
Association and a former member of the U.S. delegation to the SALT
II and START negotiations, calculates that the cut in American
strategic nuclear warheads may be as little as 6 percent. He
figures the Soviet reduction may be less than 15 percent.

   As George Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev meet
this week for summit talks that may shape the future, an
11-year-old girl from Aberdeen, Wash., is predicting the world will
celebrate ``no more wars anywhere'' in just two decades.
   Sabrina ``Breezy'' Carter's vision of the future, which won a
first prize, $4,000 scholarship in a nationwide essay contest of
16,000 youngsters, includes the election of a female U.S.
president, a cure for the common cold and ray guns that will zap
the dirt out of laundry.
   Miss Carter, a fifth-grader at McDermoth School at Aberdeen,
will fly to Washington this week to read her essay and accept her
prize in the ``Time Capsule Contest'' sponsored by Prodigy Services
Co., a personal computer services firm based in White Plains, N.Y.
   The awards ceremony will take place at the Capital Children's
Museum on Thursday, the first day of the Bush-Gorbachev summit.
Breezy won first prize among elementary school pupils. Other top
winners were Heidi Brewer, 15, of San Diego, in the junior high
category, and Loretta Vidos, 17, of Deer Park, Texas, among senior
high students.
   In an essay addressed to her ``yet-to-be-born child,'' Miss
Carter gave this upbeat prediction for the year 2010:
   ``I do not believe you will need to wash and dry clothes in your
day. You will probably have a little ray gun that you will point at
the clothes and when you pull the trigger, all the dirt will be
made to jump right out of the clothes.
   ``I think there will be only healthy food that will not make us
fat or sick.
   ``In the year 2010, I think there will be a lady president. By
this time, I think that people in America will finally have
realized that women can do just as good a job as men, and perhaps
sometimes, an even better job.
   ``In your day, I believe there will be two important new
holidays, Children's Day and Peace Day.
   ``People will truly love children. I think people will have to
get a license to have children to prove that they will be good
parents. This way, children will no longer be abused.
   ``On Peace Day, the world will celebrate no more wars anywhere.
   ``As a doctor, you will sit in front of a screen and talk to
other doctors, nurses and patients. There will be a huge screen
that will show a doctor how a cell is working inside a patient's
body.
   ``In our year, we have several terrible diseases such as cancer,
AIDS, allergies and the common cold. In your year of 2010, I think
you will have cures for all of these diseases.''
   Miss Brewer, the junior high winner, predicted that in two
decades an environment-minded world will replace fossil fuels with
solar energy and pollution-free automobiles will be powered by
hydrogen. Human life expectancy will be 120 years.
   ``There is more living space available because the population is
carefully monitored and controlled by foolproof birth control
methods now being devised by the French and which will apply to
everyone,'' she wrote.
   Miss Vidos, the high school winner, forecast a world in which
telecommunications advances produced ``an amazing harmony'' among
cultures. As a result, she wrote, ``the prejudiced were practically
obsolete, for there was no more ignorance about their fellow
neighbors.''
   In a telephone interview from Aberdeen, Miss Carter said she
hopes the Bush-Gorbachev summit will foster her vision of a world
without war in 20 years. ``They might,'' she said. ``We'll see.
Maybe it will happen, if all the countries talk together, work out
their problems and come to an agreement.''
   The essay contest was held in cooperation with the Christa
McAuliffe Institute for Educational Pioneering, a private,
non-profit organization established to honor the Concord, N.H.,
schoolteacher killed in the explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger in 1986.

<HEAD>1990 Census Can be a Con Artist's Dream</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's a con artist's dream. After years of
learning to lock doors and install burglar alarms, Americans are
being told it's their patriotic duty to open their homes to
strangers.
   It's the U.S. Census 1990, and some swindlers are taking
advantage:
   _An 80-year-old North Carolina woman was tied up and robbed by
two men she thought were census workers.
   _People claiming to be census employees charged Houston
residents $50 after helping them complete their forms.
   Census officials say such scams have to be expected.
   ``When you do something this massive, there's someone who will
figure an angle to get money from it,'' said Noe Balli of the
census' regional office in Dallas. He warned, ``Anybody who wants
money, they're obviously not census employees.''
   There are 200,000 to 230,000 official census enumerators combing
the countryside, knocking on doors of those who failed to complete
the form sent out this spring, according to Mark Mangold of census
headquarters.
   Each worker is armed with a red, white and blue badge
identifying the holder by name and I.D. number as a ``U.S. Census
Enumerator.'' In addition, each worker carries a large black
satchel with a red, white and blue patch that says U.S. Census
1990, said Ray Bancroft of the census promotion office.
   To keep from becoming the victim of an imposter, people should
demand to see identification and, if they have questions, they
should call the local census office for verification or call the
police before allowing the person inside their home, census
officials said. Bancroft noted that impersonating a census worker
carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a $1,000
fine.
   There have been isolated incidents of con artists during every
census, Bancroft said, and this year is no different. However, FBI
spokeswoman Kelley Cibulas said there is no reason for panic
because the impostors have been few in number.
   But some people have not been wary enough.
   In the North Carolina case, the woman initially allowed only one
man into her home and was having a ``nice conversation'' with him
when the doorbell rang and the man told her it was his partner,
said Tom Smith Jr. of the Charlotte, N.C., office.
   ``They tied her up and commenced taking some valuable things
from the house as well as her car,'' Smith said. ``They tied her
hands and feet and she sat on the couch and watched them take the
things.'' She was not injured, he said.
   In Houston, people identifying themselves as census workers went
to homes and helped the occupants complete the questionnaires. Then
they charged them $50 for the help, Balli said. The so-called
census workers didn't even have copies of the questionnaire but
used those sent to the residents, he said.
   Another Houston resident complained, meanwhile, that someone
identifying himself as a census worker telephoned seeking credit
information and credit card numbers, Balli said.
   In Colorado, a woman identifying herself as a census worker
asked an elderly woman resident for money. The request was refused
and the elderly woman called officials, said Ron Ritschard of the
Denver census office. There were no other reports of similar
incidents, he said.
   Nevada residents complained about a mailing that said ``Official
Census Form'' on the envelope but actually was sent by a clothing
manufacturer, said Bob Clingman of the regional census office in
Seattle.
   ``There are some innocuous questions, and they say if you send
it in on time, you can get a special price on two pairs of our new
jeans for only $29.95,'' Clingman said. The case was not pursued
because the manufacturer's name was included on the mailing
envelope, he said.
   Not everything that appears to be a scam is a scam, noted B.J.
Welborn of the regional census office in Boston.
   For example, people shouldn't necessarily be suspicious if a
person identifying himself as a census worker seeks someone's
Social Security number, she said. While the census under way this
year does not require the number, it is needed for some surveys
being conducted by the Census Bureau.
   However, Welborn warned people to be alert if the person asks
for bank account numbers, as no census survey seeks such
information.
   Sometimes it's the census workers who are victimized, officials
said.
   About two months ago, a fearful homeowner shot an enumerator,
who survived, said Balli of Texas.
   The assailant ``was an elderly gentleman in Mississippi who had
been vandalized so many times, and he saw this fellow on his
property,'' Balli said.
   The tires of one census worker's car were slashed in northern
New Jersey, said Stephanie Lowe of the bureau's Philadelphia office.

   An auto accident victim died on the operating
table after sheets covering her caught fire and filled the room
with smoke, officials say.
   An autopsy was ordered to determine whether Angela Hernandez,
26, died of her accident injuries or was killed by the blaze Monday
at UCLA Medical Cener.
   Engineers checked oxygen lines, electrical circuits and other
equipment for the cause of the fire, said Rich Elbaum, a medical
center spokesman.
   No other injuries were reported, but the smoke forced the
closing of all 16 operating rooms for the day so they could be
sterilized.
   Ms. Hernandez had been in critical condition with heart and
liver injuries after being crushed in an accident late Sunday in
Santa Monica, police said.
   She apparently was trying to warn motorists of her disabled car
when another car struck her vehicle, which in turn hit Ms.
Hernandez, police said.
   Surgeons had finished operating on the Los Angeles woman and
were about to take her out of the room on a gurney when the sheets
and blankets ignited, said Fire Department spokesman Pat Marke.
   Staff members tried to put out the fire but were forced out of
the room by smoke, said campus spokeswoman Vicki Beck. By the time
firefighters arrived some five minutes later, the blaze had mostly
burned itself out, Marek said.
   ``The fire wasn't even hot enough to set off the sprinklers in
the ceiling,'' said Battalion Chief Chuck Merriman. He estimated
damage at $40,000.
   In 1988, a 15-day-old boy was fatally burned at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center when the spark from a cauterizer _ a pen-like
instrument used to stop bleeding from an incision _ ignited the
high-oxygen atmosphere in the room.
   UCLA Medical Center officials declined to say whether doctors
Monday had been using a cauterizer.
   In February, a man described as a disgruntled hospital worker
walked into a office at the medical center and fatally shot a
co-worker and wounded his boss.

<HEAD>Forecasters See Use of Wheat for Feed Rising Worldwide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Department forecasters are
projecting an increasingly narrow gap between wheat and corn prices
that they say could mean a shrinkage of as much as 3 million tons
in U.S. corn exports over the year ahead.
   That is because feed-quality wheat, priced at increasingly
competitive levels, is likely to take over some sales from corn.
   The United States, the European Community, Eastern Europe, Korea
and the Soviet Union are all expected to use more wheat for feed,
raising the total to 105 million tons worldwide, the department
says.
   USDA's Foreign Agriculture Service is thus forecasting the
volume of U.S. corn exports in the 1990-91 trade year down 3
million tons from the current level. The department has been
estimating corn exports in the current year at 55 million tons.
   Lower wheat prices also are likely to send some countries into
the market to look for additional wheat, notably the Soviet Union
and South Korea, the department said.
   The main reason for the projected lowering of wheat prices is a
sizeable crop in sight for next year, estimated by USDA recently at
almost 2.7 billion bushels plus beginning stocks of 442 million
bushels.
   A recent USDA report saw farm prices for wheat falling from a
current $3.71 a bushel to the range of $2.90 to $3.30 a bushel.
   Corn prices were projected to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.65
a bushel.

   Red meat and poultry production this year may
rise about 2 percent over 1989, according to Agriculture Department
economists.
   USDA's latest Livestock and Poultry Situation and Outlook Report
says, however, that poultry meat is expected to be up about 7
percent while red meat production is more likely to drop 1 percent
from last year.
   It said returns would be positive for broilers and eggs, near
the break-even point for turkey producers and favorable for pork
producers.
   The report said that corn prices may rise from recent levels of
$2.30 to $2.40 a bushel, even with a projected 1990 crop of 8.1
billion bushels.
   The price of corn is crucial for livestock and poultry producers
because it is a prime source of feed.
   USDA forecasters say broiler production could increase 7 percent
this year, reflecting a healthy market over the last three years.
Turkey production also could climb in the 7 percent range, the
department said.
   Total egg production was forecast up 1 percent.
   But USDA economists said commercial pork production is expected
to be done about 2 percent this year because of poor returns in
1989. They said beef production may rise slightly.

   USDA researchers expect to introduce 30 new
varieties of landscape plants over the next three years, including
a hybrid elm variety designed to be resistant to Dutch Elm disease.
   ``These hybrids could mean that American elms reappear on the
scene,'' says geneticist Alden M. Townsend of USDA's National
Arboretum.
   The arboretum, splashed with color much of the year and spread
across 444 acres in the nation's capital, is a world center for
developing trees, shrubs, grass and other ground covers.
   It has introduced 150 varieties of landscape plants since it was
established by Congress 63 years ago, according to an article in
the May issue of USDA's Agricultural Research magazine.
   Arboretum researchers have fanned out across the world in quest
of uncataloged varieties. With financing help from the Friends of
the National Arboretum, a private group, staffers have visited
China, Korea, the British isles and other far-flung spots.
   The arboretum provides magnificent spectacles _ an array of
color-washed gardens and a Great Meadow where visitors can see _
standing against the sky like ancient Grecian ruins _ 24 white
sandstone corinthian columns that once graced the East Portico of
the Capitol.
   Replaced with marble columns three decades ago, the huge columns
were rescued by Friends of the National Arboretum from the muddy
banks of the Anacostia River where they had been deposited in 1973.
   But the most important task at the arboretum may be breeding new
plants. Among its most impressive contributions have been three
ornamental pear trees.
   Former Director John Creech first spotted the Bradford pear _
marked by snowy blossoms and a resistance to fire blight disease _
in the arboretum's Glenn Dale, Md., nursery.
   A seed collected in China in 1917 by USDA plant hunter Frank
Meyer had produced the tree, which had grown largely unnoticed.
Over the last 30 years, millions of Bradford pears have been
planted across the country, including two placed in front of the
White House by Lady Bird Johnson in 1966.
   When Bradford pears proved too tall to be practical on some city
streets, the arboretum developed more compact varieties, the
Whitehouse and Capitol.

   It was in the 10th grade that the unusually
outspoken student was sent to the principal's office for arguing
about government with his teacher.
   Even today, Mikhail S. Gorbachev remembers the incident that
underscored for him the need for free thought and expression. He
told the story with relish to two American educators who visited
him at the Kremlin shortly after he became president of the Soviet
Union in 1989.
   ``We agreed that the most important thing is to teach students
to think,'' said Mary V. Bicouvaris, a government and international
relations teacher from Hampton, Va., and the 1989 Teacher of the
Year.
   ``Students need more than just information and facts, we agreed.
He (Gorbachev) said that every time he meets American students he
is impressed with their spontaneity,'' Ms. Bicouvaris said.
   Ms. Bicouvaris and Darlene Pierce, director of the American
Association of School Administrators' National Superintendent of
the Year program, had been invited to the Soviet Union by a weekly
newspaper owned by the Communist Party and circulated to teachers
throughout the Soviet Union.
   The 13-day trip included visits to creative schools, where an
interchange of ideas between teachers and students is allowed, and
to the more typical schools, where teacher lectures are the rule.
   ``It was amazing to understand the similarities in our problems:
low esteem for teachers, low salaries for teachers, problems
getting people to enter the teaching profession,'' Ms. Pierce said.
   Ms. Bicouvaris added, ``A lot of the schools are in crisis. They
have problems with students not studying and just watching
television, and students being materialistic.''
   The Soviet curriculum, which runs through the 11th grade, has 16
required courses. They are algebra; geometry; physics; physical
education; army training; English; English literature; computer
literacy, although there are virtually no computers in the schools;
interpreting; Russian literature; chemistry; history; biology;
geography; ethics and family life; and psychology.
   The newspaper, Uchitelskaya Gazeta, initiated its own teacher of
the year program last year and sought advice on expanding it.
Officials pressed for a meeting between Gorbachev and the two
Americans to give their program credence.
   Gorbachev, who Ms. Bicouvaris said ``talked quietly'' with a
``wonderful voice like a southerner,'' told of how he was sent to
the principal's office for arguing an idea.
   ``He would lean back in his chair as if he had nothing to do,''
said Ms. Bicouvaris. ``He talked about his feelings about teachers.
He thinks that teachers are important in making changes'' in the
Soviet Union's education system.
   ``He clearly feels that the Soviet system needs to do some
changing,'' added Ms. Pierce.

<HEAD>Housewife Collects $11 Million in Donations to Erase Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JODIE DeJONGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW BERLIN, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kay Fishburn gets some snickers when she
asks people to donate money to erase the national debt _ now at
more than $3 trillion _ but she claims to have collected nearly $11
million.
   ``We're people of modest means. But we're getting a phenomenal
response for the effort we put forward,'' said Mrs. Fishburn, 50, a
suburban Milwaukee housewife who formed Citizens for a Debt-Free
America in 1983.
   Mrs. Fishburn is under no illusions about how much her group can
accomplish _ not when the national debt is growing by about $20
million every 34 minutes _ but she said, ``We're planting an idea.''
   Paying the debt is a ``matter of honor,'' she said.
   The loose-knit group has enlisted 600 volunteers nationwide. The
donations, which last week neared $11 million, have been forwarded
to the U.S. Treasury.
   Donations included $1 million from former President Reagan,
under whose administration the national debt more than tripled.
Excess funds were donated from his 1985 inauguration committee.
   The group's volunteers send out 10,000 invitations annually to
addresses taken from telephone books, club rosters and ``Who's
Who.'' They receive 800 to 900 gifts each year from housewives to
business leaders.
   The invitation reads: ``You are invited to participate in a
historic endeavor. To honor our predecessors, to restore a legacy
of liberty and initiative for future generations, citizens of the
United States of America have begun to voluntarily retire the
public debt of the federal government.''
   ``That's the one thing we didn't anticipate was the degree of
ridicule we would face,'' Mrs. Fishburn said. ``People say,
`They'll spend it faster than we'll send it in.' It's the pervasive
cynicism. We call it the snicker factor. We ignore the skeptics.
We're going for the others.''
   Those include an Ohio man who sends his Social Security checks.
Although the average gift is $50,000 and many citizens included the
Treasury as a beneficiary in their wills, the fund also receives
envelopes containing pennies.
   ``They get a lot of 2-cent gifts. People putting in their two
cents. It's such a cynical, negative thing to do,'' Mrs. Fishburn
said.
   Mrs. Fishburn, who coordinates the effort from her New Berlin
home, donates 3 percent of her family's income.
   The U.S. Treasury manages a Debt Reduction Fund, created by
Congress in 1961 after Sara Vaughan Clayton of Texas willed annual
income from a $20 million trust fund for use in retiring the
national debt.
   The tax-deductible contributions to Mrs. Fishburn's group are
used to pay off Treasury bonds, notes and bills the government
sells to finance its debt, Treasury spokesman Pete Hollenbach said.
   ``By and large, most if the contributions are small. It's a way
for many Americans to express their patriotism and the love for the
country,'' Hollenbach said. The fund has received more than $17
million, he said.
   The national debt stood at $3.061 trillion on April 30.

<HEAD>Congress' Only Psychiatrist Doesn't Mind the Jokes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress' only psychiatrist hasn't minded the
shrink jokes since a political opponent took out a full-page
newspaper ad asking voters, ``Do you want a liberal, Seattle
psychiatrist to be your next governor?''
   ``That was 1980 when Ronald Reagan won, so liberal was not a
good tag to have,'' recalls Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash.
   ``And there is always the issue of big city versus small town,
so Seattle wasn't a good place to be from. He threw in my
profession for good measure. I'm not sure which of the three was
the worst.''
   McDermott said the voters answered the campaign question with a
resounding ``hell, no,'' awarding him only 17 percent of the vote
in the 1980 election.
   Eventually he left his private practice and took his 17 years of
state legislative experience to Africa, where he worked as a U.S.
State Department psychiatrist in Zaire responsible for the mental
health of American officials in 26 embassies.
   Elected to Congress in 1988, the Chicago native who first
entered politics because of his opposition to the Vietnam War has
found his colleagues curious about his medical work.
   ``When people approach me they always tell jokes about
psychiatrists. I think they do that in part to get to know me. I
usually respond with a joke or humor,'' he said.
   ``Most people, if they have not had direct contact with a
psychiatrist, are a little put off by the idea that you could `read
minds' or look into people's thoughts. Some say to me that they
have to be careful what they say in front of me. I always tell them
I never mix business with pleasure,'' he said.
   McDermott, 53, said the mind is of great interest to people
because it is the most complex of all human aspects. However, he
said, Congress and the public continue to shy away from addressing
mental health issues.
   ``Most people would rather think that everything is rational and
everything is going to be okay. They like to avoid thinking about
it. Because of that, it is a hard issue to get money for. We don't
like to think there are a lot of mentally ill people,'' he said.
   Being in Congress has given McDermott a chance to observe his
colleagues.
   ``If you look at them, they are an amazingly accurate
cross-section of the United States. In terms of interests,
abilities, reputations and economic status, they are quite
reflective of the general population,'' he said.
   McDermott said during his years in the state legislature he
developed a level of trust with his colleagues that would prompt
them to share family medical history and talk about family
psychological problems. He even made referrals for some.
   McDermott said he gets the impression that every successful
politician has a bit of psychiatrist in him or her.
   ``A good psychiatrist understands people and that's what this
business is, a people business. Every single one of them (Congress
members) got elected. For many, they can't explain how they did it.
But instinctively they understand people. The only advantage I have
over them is I spent a long time studying it.''

<HEAD>Arkansas' Clinton Tries to Avoid Runoff; Mazzoli Rejects Help of
PACs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Bill Clinton hoped to avoid a runoff in today's Democratic
primary in Arkansas, and U.S. Rep. Romano Mazzoli of Kentucky
sought an 11th term in a bid handicapped by his refusal to accept
money from political action committees.
   Also in Arkansas, blacks were guaranteed greater representation
in the Legislature because 31 districts were redrawn. Seats in five
of 10 newly created black-majority districts are being sought by
only black candidates.
   Clinton must get more than 50 percent of the vote to win the
nomination outright for another term. Otherwise, the top two
vote-getters will meet in a runoff.
   A poll released Friday gave Clinton 55 percent to 22 percent for
Tom McRae, former president of a charitable foundation, with 19
percent undecided. Three other contenders had 3 percent or less.
   Clinton, 43, was the nation's youngest governor when he was
first elected in 1978. He was defeated in 1980 but was elected
again in 1982, 1984 and 1986, the first year the governorship was
made a four-year term.
   The Republican gubernatorial race pits U.S. Rep. Tommy Robinson,
a former police chief and sheriff, against Sheffield Nelson, a
former utility executive.
   Robinson and Nelson may pick up some traditional Democratic
voters because they switched parties last year. Arkansas voters may
participate in either primary without making a commitment for the
November general election.
   In Kentucky, the closest contest for Congress may be the
Democratic primary in Mazzoli's Louisville district. Former TV
newsman Jeffrey Hutter, who got 39 percent of the vote against
Mazzoli two years ago, is trying again. The other candidate is
Louisville Alderman Paul Bather.
   Mazzoli's opponents have questioned whether he has done enough
for Louisville since he was first elected in 1970. Hutter has
criticized Mazzoli for voting to repeal the Catastrophic Health
Care Act, raise the salaries of members of Congress and severely
restrict abortions.
   But Mazzoli's decision not to accept PACs may be his downfall.
As of May 18, Mazzoli said he had raised $133,370 from individual
contributors. Hutter had raised $172,550 by May 9, including
$40,000 from PACs.
   Mazzoli, 57, decided in December to set an example by becoming
one of only about two dozen members of Congress who reject PAC
contributions. PACs had contributed to about half of his past
campaigns.
   ``I've always felt politics belongs to the people, not to the
large special interest groups,'' Mazzoli said. ``Instead of
leveling the playing field, PACs have become a force to keep
incumbents in office.''

<HEAD>National Gallery to Display Rubens Painting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major early painting by Peter Paul Rubens
will go on permanent display at the National Gallery of Art
tomorrow, on the 350th anniversary of the death of the 17th century
Flemish master of the Baroque.
   The gallery last year purchased the 3-by-4-foot oil, ``The Fall
of Phaeton,'' from a private collection in London for a sum
director J. Carter Brown described as in the multimillion-dollar
range.
   The painting, which depicts a dramatic scene from Greek
mythology, was cleaned to restore its colors to their original
brilliance. It joins the eight other works from Rubens' later
period in the National Gallery's permanent collection.
   Except for its inclusion in an exhibition in Cologne, West
Germany, in 1977, before it was cleaned, ``The Fall of the
Phaeton'' had never been displayed publicly.
   Little is known of its ownership since Rubens painted it in 1605
while studying in Italy.
   Brown and Arthur Wheelock, the gallery's curator of northern
Baroque painting, said the painting is important because of what it
tells about Rubens in the early, formative stage of his development
as the greatest Baroque artist.

<HEAD>House Democrats Ask for More Funds to Investigate S&amp;L Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 200 House Democrats are asking
President Bush to ask Congress for more money to investigate and
prosecute fraud in the worsening savings and loan crisis.
   The Democrats sent a letter to Bush last Friday saying the $50
million appropriated to the Justice Department to investigate and
prosecute S&amp;L fraud isn't enough to handle the backlog of thousands
of potential criminal cases.
   An additional $100 million is needed, said the Democrats, led by
Rep. Charles E. Schumer of New York and joined by some lawmakers
who last week accused the Justice Department of dragging its feet
on prosecuting thrift fraud.
   Sean Young, a White House spokesman, said over the weekend that
Bush had not received the letter yet and would have no immediate
comment on it.
   Bush said last Thursday that the savings and loan crisis
``causes me great concern'' and that policymakers' first priority
is protecting depositors against losses.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady last week raised
administration estimates of how much new borrowing the government
needs to clean up the savings and loan mess from $50 billion
forecast a year ago to between $90 billion and $130 billion.
   Including interest, the cost to taxpayers is expected to exceed
$325 billion over the next 30 years.

<HEAD>Ten Health Groups Agree on Diet Guidelines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health experts often have disagreed about what
are the healthiest foods for a long life. But after holding a
``food summit'' last year, 10 health agencies have now come up with
a list of jointly recommended dietary guidelines.
   The five private and five public agencies call it ``The Healthy
American Diet,'' with six general diet principles for everyone over
the age of 2:
   _Eat a nutritionally adequate diet consisting of a variety of
foods.
   _Reduce consumption of fat, especially saturated fat and
cholesterol.
   _Achieve and maintain a reasonable body weight.
   _Increase consumption of complex carbohydrates and fiber.
   _Reduce intake of sodium.
   _Consume alcohol in moderation, if at all. Children, adolescents
and pregnant women should abstain.
   The health organizations, ranging from the American Academy of
Pediatrics to the U. S. Department of Agriculture, also recommended
that some segments of the population take additional measures.
   To avoid dental cavities, the groups recommended fluoride in
drinking water and limited between-meal snacks containing sugar.
Adolescents and young women should eat more high-calcium foods,
such as low-fat dairy products.
   Children, adolescents and women of childbearing age also should
include iron-rich foods, such as red meat, fish and cereals, in
their diets to avoid anemia.
   Many of the groups, such as the American Heart Association,
already had recommended diets. But the experts' diets often
differed slightly from organization to organization.
   Dr. Alan Chait of the University of Washington in Seattle, who
is chairman of the heart association's nutrition committee, said a
common message on diet recommendations should help ``reduce
confusion among the public.''

   Dr. Benjamin Spock says American society
is sick and getting sicker, and one of its worst ailments is
``excessive competitiveness.''
   Most children are brought up to believe ``you're in this world
to get ahead, kid,'' Spock said in a commencement speech Monday at
Yale University's School of Epidemiology and Public Health.
   Little League baseball should be abolished, he said, because it
``takes the fun out of athletics at an early age.''
   ``We ought to raise our children with quite a different spirit _
not primarily to get ahead,'' said Spock, whose landmark 1946 book
``Baby and Child Care'' has sold 32 million copies.
   He also recommended that teen-agers take part in volunteer
activities, from working in hospitals to tutoring children.

   Madonna's untamed look once drew stares
from classmates at Rochester Adams High School, but today's
students at her alma mater seem unimpressed that she's back in town
for two concerts.
   ``The kids that are here and are 14 years old were born the year
she graduated,'' said Nancy Ryan-Mitchell, who was Madonna Louise
Ciccone's counselor. ``To these kids, though they know she's from
the community and the school, it doesn't touch them personally.''
   Madonna will perform Thursday and Friday at The Palace in Auburn
Hills, a Detroit suburb.
   Five years ago, when her ``Virgin Tour'' came to Detroit, the
students adorned a bulletin board with memorabilia hailing the
alumna-turned-pop star.
   Madonna was an unconventional student in her senior year,
drawing attention for wearing little makeup and not shaving her
underarms.
   ``She had a real European kind of attitude, a real cosmopolitan
flair,'' said Tim Lentz, Madonna's choir teacher. ``She dared to be
different.''

   The poetry of Allen Ginsberg and the
music of Philip Glass are combined in a new production about ``the
decline of the American empire.''
   ``The Hydrogen Jukebox,'' which premiered over the weekend at
the Spoleto Festival U.S.A., is based on Ginsberg's poems dating to
the 1960s. The festival production features six singers and a
six-piece orchestra.
   Each scene is built around a poem; the subjects include the
Vietnam War, ecology and cocaine trafficking.
   ``The Hydrogen Jukebox'' is about the ``decline of the American
empire,'' Ginsberg said.
   ``It's basically an emotional and moral decline,'' he said.
``It's not an angry accusation. It's more of a meditation on the
decline of an empire. The biggest decline of empire is we won't
face our problems.''

<HEAD>Government Says New Rebel Group Controls Main Dam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new guerrilla movement has emerged
in this former Dutch colony and seized a hydroelectric dam, cutting
off power to the capital and key bauxite smelters, the government
said.
   Deputy Prime Minister Willy Soemita said Monday that the group
sprang to life from breakaway followers of Ronny Brunswijk's Jungle
Commando, which had been battling the military in the isolated
South American republic since 1986.
   Soemita said the government received word from the new group
that it wanted to meet with President Ramsewak Shankar and armed
forces commander Desi Bouterse.
   He said he didn't know what its demands were but said a
government delegation was to meet with the rebels at an unspecified
time.
   He said the group seized control of the Brokondo region in
Central Suriname over the weekend and overtook the Afobaka
hydroelectric about 60 miles south of the capital.
   Paramaribo was without power over much of the weekend but most
electricity had returned on Monday.
   The deputy prime minister said he didn't know if the rebels were
still controlling the dam.
   ``The situation is very unclear,'' he said.
   He said the new leader of the group is Barrabas, as a former
notorious leader of the Jungle Commando is known.
   Bouterse, a former military ruler who came to power in a 1980
coup, had opposed a tentative peace agreement the new civilian
government reached last July with the Jungle Commando, saying it
gave Brunswijk too much power.
   Bouterse returned the country to civilian rule in November 1987,
but the army still retains the real power in the country.
   The Jungle Commando is made up mostly of Bush Negroes,
descendants of runaway slaves who make up about 60,000 of the
country's 400,000 Dutch speaking population.

   The dollar rebounded Tuesday against the Japanese
yen, and share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined after a
five-day rise.
   The dollar closed at 150.70 yen, up 1.25 yen from Monday's close
of 149.45 yen. After opening at 149.02 yen, the U.S. currency
ranged between 149.00 yen and 150.75 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues fell 373.94
points, or 1.13 percent, to close at 32,817.67. The Nikkei index
had gained 397.73 points on Monday and 1,735.44 points, or 5.35
percent, over the previous week. Volume on the first section
Tuesday was 800 million shares.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds dropped to 88.89 points p.m. from
Monday's close of 88.51. The yield rose to 6.990 percent from 6.865
percent.
   Dollar-trading was calm Tuesday, and most of the activity in the
Tokyo market focused on the West German mark, said Takayuki
Nishinaka, a dealer with the Bank of Japan.
   ``The underlying pressure on the dollar is downward,'' however,
he said. ``Everyone is expecting a little more decline.''
   Currency markets were closed Monday in New York, London and Hong
Kong, but the dollar dipped below 149 yen to hit 148.82 yen Tuesday
in Sydney, he said.
   The stock market's main barometer declined after a five-day rise
largely because institutional investors sold shares when the index
passed the 33,000 target level, said Wataru Watanabe, a trader with
Daiwa Securities.
   Incentive-backed issues did well early in the session, but by
the end of the morning, ``most investors were sidelined,'' he said.

   A 6-foot-8 granite headstone etched with the
words ``Kid of Courage'' and lyrics from songs by Elton John and
Michael Jackson has been erected at the grave of AIDS victim Ryan
White.
   The headstone was dedicated on Memorial Day, two months after
his death at age 18.
   Ryan's mother, Jeanne White, said the gravestone was built to
represent his dream to be tall. Ryan was less than 5 feet tall.
   ``He wanted to be big and be like Howie Long,'' she said. The
6-foot-5 pro football player was a pallbearer at Ryan's funeral and
helped raise money for the AIDS organization that bears the boy's
name.
   The headstone, designed by Ryan's mother, carries inscriptions
front and back telling his story. It also carries a picture of the
boy, whose battle for acceptance won hearts and improved public
understanding of AIDS.
   A hemophiliac who contracted AIDS through blood-clotting
products, Ryan won a court battle to attend school outside of
Kokomo, but ill feelings drove him, his sister and mother to
Cicero, 30 miles from Indianapolis.
   He became a spokesman for AIDS education, and his cause drew
support from singers John and Jackson. Lyrics from their songs are
on the monument, along with words from Gov. Evan Bayh.
   ``He was a young man who taught us the meaning of courage and
I'm convinced that his life will be remembered for what he taught
us about living than the disease that afflicted him,'' Bayh is
quoted as saying on the black and white granite _ Ryan's favorite
colors.
   Neighbors, his high school prom date, friends and acquaintances
gave testimonials about encounters with him during the dedication.
   ``I think about him every day _ several, several times,'' his
uncle, Tom Hale, said before the approximately 75 people who
attended the dedication. ```Don't weep for me, meet me.' That would
be his prayer.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev: Nyet to Hoover Institution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank at Stanford
University, has been dropped from Mikhail Gorbachev's itinerary.
But a visit to a typical middle-class Minneapolis family is still
on the agenda _ at least for his wife.
   Soviet officials decided Gorbachev's schedule ``was just too
tight'' for a tour of the Hoover Institution when the Soviet leader
visits the university 25 miles from San Francisco next week,
Stanford spokesman Bob Freelen said Monday.
   Gorbachev's tentative plans had included a meeting with scholars
at the institution, which was founded by future President Hoover in
1919 and boasts one of the world's biggest collections of material
from the Russian Revolution.
   Gorbachev, after summit talks this week with President Bush,
will visit Minnesota on Sunday and the San Francisco Bay area on
Sunday and Monday.
   In Minnesota, Paul Ridgeway, lead advance coordinator for the
visit, said Gorbachev will stop at the governor's mansion and meet
with Midwest business and agricultural leaders at a hotel.
   A visit to the home of Steve and Karen Watson also remained in
the planning, but probably only Raisa Gorbachev will take part,
Ridgeway said.
   The Gorbachevs have said they would like to visit a typical
middle-class family with at least three children and a dog. The
Watsons have four children and a dog.
   Georgiy Markosov, a counselor with the Soviet Embassy, said no
proposals by the governor's office had been eliminated. But
Ridgeway said Gorbachev will not address the public from the
Capitol steps, as Gov. Rudy Perpich wanted.
   Stops expected to be in the final itinerary include the
Cathedral of St. Paul and the Sculpture Garden at Walker Art Center
in Minneapolis, Ridgeway said. Perpich has suggested an ecumenical
service at the cathedral.
   In San Francisco, Gorbachev is to meet with former President
Reagan for breakfast at the Soviet consulate on June 4.
   During visit to Stanford, the Soviet leader will deliver a
speech, meet with former Secretary of State George Shultz, now a
professor of international economics at Stanford, and talk with
other faculty members and students.
   Scholars at the Hoover Institution, a longtime bastion of
anti-communism, had planned to show Gorbachev the collection from
the Russian Revolution and offer papers suggesting ways of solving
the Soviet Union's economic problems.
   Charles Palm, an associate director of the institution, said he
was disappointed by the change in plans.
   Thousands of items, including mug shots of revolutionaries and
secret Czarist police files, are at the institution.
   Hoover scholars have included Alexander Kerensky, premier of the
provisional government that followed the downfall of Czar Nicholas
II in the spring of 1917 only to be toppled in the Bolshevik
Revolution months later.

<HEAD>Lithuanians Support Independence Drive Despite Hardships from
Blockade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuanian authorities say the Soviet economic
embargo has forced sharp cutbacks in electric power to industries
and idled 40,000 workers, but a new poll shows the hardships have
not weakened support for the republic's independence drive.
   In neighboring Latvia on Monday, the Parliament approved a
resolution rejecting President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's May 14 decree
declaring independence moves by Latvia and Estonia to be illegal
and unconstitutional.
   After sharp debate, Latvian legislators approved a resolution on
Monday that called Gorbachev's decree ``illegal interference'' in
the republic's affairs, the Soviet TV news program ``Vremya''
reported.
   Anti-independence legislators did not participate in the vote,
it reported.
   The three Baltic republics, forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union
in 1940, are all seeking to restore independence. While Latvia and
Estonia have adopted a more gradual approach, Lithuania declared
its independence on March 11.
   Gorbachev cut off all oil and most natural gas supplies to
Lithuania on April 18 for its refusal to rescind pro-independence
laws.
   Electricity is being generated at only two power plants in
Lithuania _ a nuclear plant at Ignalina and the oil-burning
Elektrenai station, and neither is operating at full capacity,
according to Radio Vilnius reporter Audrius Braukyla.
   Braukyla said homes were unaffected by the power cutbacks.
   According to a government communique reported Monday by Radio
Vilnius, ``power supply to industrial enterprises is being severely
limited,'' affecting nearly 200,000 workers at those plants.
   The Lithuanian news agency ELTA said the power cutback would
affect 300 factories and enterprises.
   The communique said 40,000 workers have become jobless since the
Soviet economic embargo was imposed.
   Nearly 2,000 people have registered at the republic's
unemployment office, and 500 have been given new jobs, mostly in
the farming sector, Braukyla quoted the communique as saying.
   He quoted Lithuanian legislator Antanas Karoblis as saying
factories under Moscow's control were receiving supplies of oil and
raw materials.
   Braukyla said recent motor traffic seemed greater than early in
the oil cutoff. A taxi driver told him Lithuanians are striking
deals with residents of the neighboring republic of Byelorussia,
who are bringing in hundreds of gallons of gasoline in cars and
small trucks.
   Some were even trading Lithuanian chocolates for gasoline, he
added.
   Despite the hardships, the Lithuanian radio station said a
public opinion poll conducted this month of almost 1,000 people in
Vilnius, the republic's capital, indicated a strengthening of
support for the declaration of independence.
   Asked ``Do you think the Lithuanian Supreme Council (parliament)
should revoke the decision about the restoration of the statehood
of Lithuania?'' 72 percent said no and 19 percent said yes, the
radio station said. In April, 21 percent said the declaration
should be revoked.
   The poll was conducted by the Lithuanian branch of the All-Union
Public Opinion Poll Center, which gave no margin of error.

   The dollar rebounded against the yen today, and the
weaker Japanese currency helped push down share prices on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange after a five-day rise.
   The dollar closed at 150.70 yen, up 1.25 yen from Monday's close
of 149.45 yen. After opening at 149.02 yen, it ranged between
149.00 yen and 150.75 yen.
   ``Presumably there was an exhaustion of dollar-bearish
sentiment, and people took profits on the downside,'' said Masato
Nakamura of Sumitomo Bank. He said the dollar could go back above
151 yen this week.
   The dollar's turnaround was initiated by the West German mark's
rally in cross trading with the yen, he said. The dollar generally
has been falling since April 18, when it closed at 159.87, and it
fell below 150 yen on Monday for the first time in Tokyo in nearly
three months.
   Today's decline in the yen led to a 1.13 percent decline in the
Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, said John Courtney, a
broker with W.I. Carr. The Nikkei index fell 373.94 points, closing
at 32,817.67.
   ``It's strange, but within the market, it seems to matter more
what happens in Germany or the United States than what happens
here,'' he said. The market is ``ultrasensitive'' to changes in
exchange and interest rates, he said.
   Profit-taking after a five-day surge contributed to today's
decline, brokers said. The Nikkei had gained 1,735.44 points, or
5.35 percent, over the preceding week.
   Many institutional investors sold shares when the index passed
the 33,000 target level, said Wataru Watanabe, a trader with Daiwa
Securities.
   Volume on the first section today was 800 million shares.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds dropped to 87.75 points as of 4 p.m. from
Monday's close of 88.51. The yield rose to 7.020 percent from 6.865
percent.

   The commander of Soviet security forces in Armenia
has accused the republic's leaders of openly aiding armed groups of
Armenian nationalists who have engaged his troops in bloody clashes.
   Gen. Yuri Shatalin, head of Interior Ministry troops in the
Caucasus republic, made the remarks Monday after two days of
clashes between militants and Soviet troops in and around the
Armenian capital left 23 people dead.
   At least 20 of the fatalities were civilians.
   ``Bloodshed in Yerevan is the result of open connivance of the
republican leadership and law enforcement agencies with illegal
armed groups,'' the official Tass news agency quoted Shatalin as
saying.
   Shatalin told Tass the situation was ``developing most
unpredictably.''
   The militants were driving around Yerevan in stolen cars,
carrying captured weapons, he said. He said Interior Ministry
troops could not interfere without permission from the republic's
leaders.
   Accounts of the fighting varied. Armenian nationalists said
Soviet soldiers fired on unarmed civilians. Soviet officials said
Armenian militants attacked army patrols.
   Leaders of the Armenian Communist Party and the republic's
government declared today a day of mourning for those slain in the
clashes, according to Radio Yerevan and the independent Interfax
news service.
   The streets of Yerevan were quiet today, but a demonstration was
planned for later in the day, said Bela Avitisyan, an editor of the
official Armenian news agency Armenpress.
   Armenians marked the day by wearing black ribbons and hanging
the red-blue-and-yellow Armenian flag from the windows of buildings
and cars, said Ms. Avitisyan, contacted by telephone in Yerevan.
The local radio interrupted regular programs to broadcast somber
music.
   Ms. Avitisyan said official reports put the casualties from the
two days of clashes at 23 dead and 37 wounded. She did not have a
breakdown of how many were killed in the separate incidents, or
information about how many casualties there were on each side.
   Armenian Communist Party leader Vladimir Movsesyan urged calm, a
call echoed by leaders of the Armenian National Movement, but
militants were disregarding the calls and launching attacks to
steal weapons from local police, Tass said.
   In Moscow, Interior Ministry spokesman Yuri Makarov said six
people died early Sunday when soldiers fired on militants who had
shot at them in Yerevan's central railroad station. He said 20
soldiers were wounded in the shootout.
   A duty officer at the Armenian National Movement, who declined
to give his name, said the soldiers had opened fire on unarmed
civilians at the station.
   Rafael Popoyan, a leader of the Armenian National Movement, said
that after the shootout at the railroad station, about 15 armored
personnel carriers headed toward the city center from a nearby base.
   He said troops they were carrying opened fire on a crowd of
people who attempted to block the road with parked cars.
   Makarov said that according to a preliminary report, 14
civilians were killed and more than 30 injured in the clash at the
barricade.
   Armenian activist Satenik Paramadjan said Soviet soldiers on
Monday morning fired on the headquarters of the Armenian National
Movement, killing a person sleeping in a car outside. Including
that fatality, the death toll for the two days of violence was at
least 21.
   Popoyan said there were several clashes in Yerevan and its
outskirts late Sunday and Monday morning. Soviet soldiers, he said,
``just came into the city shooting.''
   The Soviet evening television news program ``Vremya'' showed
scenes Monday of bullet-scarred walls at the railroad station and
bloodstains on seats. It called the militants ``terrorists.''
   A mass rally was held Monday by the Armenian National Movement
to commemorate Armenia's 1918 declaration of independence, Tass
reported, adding without elaboration that ``an ominous shadow'' was
cast over the observation. Armenia was annexed by the Soviet Union
in 1920.
   In more than two years, several hundred people have been killed
in violence in Armenia and neighboring Azerbaijan. The republics
have been locked in a bitter struggle for control of
Nagorno-Karabakh, the predominantly ethnic-Armenian enclave inside
Azerbaijan.
   Soviet soldiers have been deployed in both republics to quell
the violence.
   Sunday's violence came three days after militants fired on
soldiers at military checkpoints and on patrol in Nagorno-Karabakh.
One Soviet serviceman was killed and four were wounded in the
attacks.

<TEXT>
   African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela underwent a minor operation and will remain
in the hospital for a couple of days for needed rest, the clinic's
director said today.
   ``Mr. Mandela will be here a couple of days and is resting _
which he needs,'' said Gordon Cohen, director of the Park Lane
Clinic, to which the ANC deputy president was admitted Sunday night
for a routine physical.
   He did not specify what type of operation the 71-year-old
Mandela underwent.
   ``He is well on his way to recovery,'' Cohen said, adding that
the operation did not involve the prostate, which Mandela had had
removed in a 1985 operation.
   ``The operation was nothing serious, and can't have any
long-term consequences,'' Cohen said.
   ANC spokesman Ahmed Kathrada had said earlier that Mandela was
undergoing a routine physical examination and was expected to be
released today.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, visited him today and told reporters
Mandela's planned trip to Europe next week was ``in no way affected
and would go ahead,'' the South African Press Association said.
   Cohen said the operation had occurred on Monday. On Monday
night, he had refused to confirm an operation and had told SAPA
``It was a completely minor check-up.''
   ANC internal chairman Walter Sisulu, a close friend of Mandela,
told SAPA on Monday night that he thought the examination had
included a minor operation involving Mandela's prostate.
   Kathrada said that Mandela's admission to the clinic for a
complete physical had been planned for a long time, and would be
followed by a week of rest at home before he takes his next trip.
   Mandela was treated for tuberculosis in 1988. He returned last
week from a tour of eight African countries. He also made a trip
through Africa and to Britain and Sweden shortly after he was freed
Feb. 11 from 27 years in prison, where he was serving a life term
for sabotage and plotting the overthrow of the government.

Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who opposed his election.
   The burly Siberian stood to applause from the floor of the
Russian Congress of People's Deputies when the vote was announced.
   Yeltsin needed 531 of the 1,060 members to win.
   His nearest rival, Russian Premier Alexander Vlasov, received

   It was Yeltsin's third attempt to win the Russian presidency and

   The popular and outspoken Communist renegade had lost the second
round of voting in the Russian Congress on Saturday by just 28
votes. He had lost the first round on Friday with 497 ballots to
473 for Krasnodar regional Communist Party chief Ivan Polozkov.
   He was nominated again on Monday and faced Vlasov, who had
Gorbachev's support, and Valentin Tsoy, a little-known businessman
from the Soviet Far East, in the race.
   Last week, Gorbachev spoke against Yeltsin at the congress,
opposing his plan to transfer economic and political
decision-making from central authorities to the republic.
   Yeltsin has proposed in broad outlines a more radical market
economy plan that would give more freedom to enterprises and
entrepreneurs.
   Russia, by far the largest of the 15 Soviet republics, stretches
from the Baltic Sea in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east
and is home to just over one-half the country's population.

<HEAD>Former Boston Mayor Admits Birthday Party Was a Money-Making
Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Mayor Kevin H. White has acknowledged what
prosecutors couldn't prove almost a decade ago _ that a planned
birthday party for his wife was a scheme to put money in his pocket.
   In an interview Sunday on WHDH-TV, White said the party ``was an
idea artificially hatched to make up for a problem. The problem was
I could barely survive on my salary.'' But he said establishing the
fund was not improper.
   After a great deal of publicity, the 1981 party was canceled and
about $122,000 in donations was returned. At the time, White
angrily denied allegations of corruption, no evidence was produced
to link him to organizing the party and no charges were filed.
   White did not seek re-election in 1983 after 16 years as mayor.
He now teaches at Boston University.
   The State Ethics Commission and the U.S. Justice Department
looked into the birthday party for White's wife, Kathryn, in an
attempt to prove it was a scheme to put money in White's personal
account.
   The commission censured White for conflict of interest by using
his office to gain unwarranted privileges. The two investigations
are closed.
   ``His position and the position that was expressed for him by
his attorneys was that the birthday party was for Kathryn,'' said
former Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert J. Cordy, former counsel to
the Ethics Commission.
   ``Now it seems it was a scheme to raise money for himself to
supplement his income. That was exactly the danger the Ethics
Commission was concerned about.''

<HEAD>Rain Falls in East, Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain fell in the eastern half of the nation and in the Upper
Plains early today, flooding portions of Ohio.
   Rain and showers extended from Cleveland to Buffalo to Richmond,
Va., and from Casper, Wyo., to Spokane, Wash. Thunderstorms looped
down from Kansas to the Georgia coast and up to South Carolina.
   On Monday, wet, stormy weather advanced across the southeastern
quarter of the nation, spinning off at least four tornados.
Lightning killed one person in Galveston Island, Texas.
   Heavy rain overnight flooded parts of eastern and south-central
Ohio, leaving many roads impassable.
   Floodwaters up to 6 feet deep swamped Murray City, forcing the
evacuation of at least 50 residents, authorities said. The flooding
shoved one building off its foundations, caved in a hillside and
swept equipment out of a firehouse.
   ``The streets are a mess. In 1968 we had a flood, but it was
nothing like this,'' said firefighter Bob Koon. ``We got the trucks
out, but a lot of the other stuff is gone.''
   Tornadoes touched down near Atlanta, southeast of Houma, La.,
and west of Huntington, W.Va.
   At Morehead in eastern Kentucky, a twister overturned several
light aircraft and a small hangar at Morehead-Rowan County Airport
and apparently carried off two other planes, state police said. It
also downed power lines, destroyed a small office and damaged two
houses. No injuries were reported.
   Hail fell at Maiden, N.C., Midway, W.Va., Baldwin, Ga., and
North Knoxville, Tenn.
   Today's forecast called for rain in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming
and across the Northeast. Storms were expected in Kansas, Oklahoma,
northern Texas, northern Florida and along the coasts of Georgia
and South Carolina.
   A high of 73 in Nome, Ark., broke the town's Memorial Day record
of 70 degrees that had stood for 27 years.
   The nation's high was 99 at Beeville, Texas.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell in calm European trading this
morning with most attention focused on the West German mark's
advance against the yen in cross-trading. Gold prices rose.
   Markets were closed Monday in Britain for a bank holiday and in
the United States for Memorial Day.
   ``It all depends on the mark-yen crosses,'' said a dealer at a
U.S. bank in Frankfurt. ``The dollar had failed to break out on the
upside, and the yen was strong against the mark, but now we have a
correction to that.''
   Rumors that the Deutsche Bundesbank might raise West German key
interest rates at its Thursday meeting of the Central Bank Council
contributed to the mark's rise against the yen in East Asian
dealings, traders said.
   A bullish report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development on West German growth also helped, they said.
   Traders said the market would be looking ahead to Friday's
release of new U.S. unemployment figures for a fresh indication of
the dollar's medium-term direction.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.25 yen to close at 150.70 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 150.83 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday's
European rates:
   _1.6690 West German marks, down from 1.6790
   _1.4100 Swiss francs, down from 1.4215
   _5.6290 French francs, down from 5.6565
   _1.8810 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8910
   _1,227.50 Italian lire, down from 1,233.50
   _1.1808 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1828
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.6932, slightly
more expensive for buyers than $1.6930 late Monday in continental
Europe.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $368.50 an ounce, up
from $367.45 late Friday. At midmorning, the city's gold dealers
fixed a recommended price of $368.35.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $368.45, up from $367.50 late
Monday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose 56 cents to close at a bid $369.48.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.23 an ounce,
unchanged from Friday.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shipping company hired to supply milk powder
to the famine-ravaged Sudan is under federal investigation because
the powder was unfit for human consumption, The New York Times
reported today.
   Court papers filed by the government allege that the company,
AMG Services, promised to deliver high-quality milk powder to the
Sudan but substituted an undrinkable, diluted powder.
   AMG president Martyn Merritt said the inferior powder was
supplied by a Sri Lankan subcontractor.
   Merritt warned U.S. government officials about the switch but
was ignored, he said.
   ``I didn't want this stuff to get sent off and have people get
sick from it,'' he said.
   Under an Agency for International Development program, the
United States buys food for the Sudan, one of the world's poorest
countries.
   AMG received $936,000 to ship hundreds of tons of milk powder in
January 1989, the court papers said, but the Sudanese never
received a shipment. The cargo apparently got mixed up in Sri
Lanka, where an AMG subsidiary was supposed to forward it.
   Sudanese government investigators went to Sri Lanka, found a
substitute shipment of the low-quality milk powder and rejected it.
   Erwin Shustak, an attorney for Merritt, said he believed AMG was
under investigation because of a dispute years ago between Merritt
and a government investigator.
   Prosecutors would not comment.

<TEXT>
   Doctors are waiting for test results to
decide how to treat Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley, who was
hospitalized with pneumonia, an aide to the prime minister said.
   Manley, 65, was flown here from Kingston by air ambulance early
Monday, according to a statement from Jamaica House in Kingston.
   Carol Smith, nursing coordinator on duty at the Miami Heart
Institute, said early today she had been told Manley's condition
was ``unchanged,'' but she was unaware what condition he was in.
   Mrs. Smith said further information was unavaiable.
   Hartley Neita, an aide traveling with Manley, said Monday it was
unclear how long Manley would be hospitalized.
   ``He has been undergoing tests and we're waiting now for the
results of those tests,'' he said. ``From there on, the doctors
will go full blast on treatment.
   He said Manley watched part of the French Open tennis tournament
Monday on television, but spent most of the day resting.
   Earlier, President Bush sent a message to Manley through the
U.S. Embassy in Kingston expressing concern for the prime
minister's health.
   On Sunday, Manley was admitted to Kingston's University
Hospital, where the pneumonia was diagnosed.
   Manley was scheduled to undergo prostate surgery June 5 at
Sloane Kettering Cancer Institute in New York, Neita said. But
doctors were ``watching his prognosis'' to see if that operation
would be postponed, the aide said.
   A socialist, Manley lost the 1980 elections but returned to
office in February 1989 after he moderated his politics. He was
prime minister from 1972-1980.

   About 30 riot policemen entered
the capital's largest prison to end a five-day uprising that left
one prisoner dead and three injured, officials said today.
   Rioting broke out in Ruzyne Prison on Thursday when four inmates
barricaded themselves inside their cell and set it on fire,
Frantisek Chaloupka, a senior prison official said today. They were
hospitalized and one later died of burns.
   On Saturday night, 11 inmates climbed onto the prison roof and
demanded improved prison conditions and the release of all
prisoners awaiting trial.
   Three inmates were reported injured during the riot. It was not
immediately clear how many inmates took part in the uprising or how
much of the facility the rebellious prisoners took over.
   The Ruzyne prison, which can hold 2,000 inmates but which only
had 500 when the rioting occurred, contains mostly suspects in
serious crimes.
   After negotiations with government officials failed, 30 riot
policemen crushed the protest Monday night. The 11 inmates were
removed from the roof by police using helicopters and cranes. One
policeman was injured in the process.
   Police said one prisoner escaped during the confusion.

   Apple-cinnamon milk got a thumbs down,
but milk flavored with banana or orange drew raves from kids in a
taste test.
   ``Tastes like soggy Froot Loops!'' said first-grader Jeremy
Foster, licking off the pale mustache from orange milk he chose for
lunch.
   Many of his classmates at North Star Elementary School shared
his enthusiasm during taste tests conducted at 13 Denver area
schools for the Western Dairy Farmers Promotion Association.
   Apple-cinnamon milk was a real loser but banana milk made a
splash.
   ``Cinnamon milk was sick,'' said kindergartner A.J. Pierce.
   ``I want banana back,'' said 7-year-old Tino Garcia.''
   One of the new flavors could be offered to schools next fall, in
addition to white and chocolate milk, and the occasional strawberry.
   ``Kids have become much more sophisticated in their taste these
days, and there are a variety of juices and other flavors that are
available to them,'' said association spokeswoman Faye Asano. ``We
want to expand that variety, too.''
   Reactions from other schools have closely followed those at
North Star, with banana the favorite, orange second and
apple-cinnamon the distinct third.
   Aside from the taste, students and adults complained it didn't
look nice.
   ``It looked like dirty milk,'' said Lila Stafford, the cafeteria
manager for Adams City Middle School in Commerce City.

   A school board committee has

   A school board committee voted 5-2 Monday in favor of installing
the machines in the city's 18 high schools. Installations would not
begin until September.
   ``Some of the communities are uneasy with it but the board has
got to be the driving force to say we'll have condom machines in
washrooms,'' said committee Chairman Ken Denike.
   John Blatherwick, city medical health officer, said the step was
necessary to help students protect themselves from AIDS.
   Final approval will be considered at the board's meeting next
Monday.
   Earlier this year, two other British Columbia school districts
approved the installation of condom dispensers.

   Moderate leaders at the Arab summit
appeared today to have persuaded hard-liners to take a ``balanced
and prudent'' approach to the United States, under fire for its
support of Israel, conference sources said.
   But despite their reported acquiescence, PLO chairman Yasser
Arafat and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein made belicose speeches
against the United States and Israel at Monday's opening session of
the two-day summit.
   In another development today, a senior PLO official said Saddam
and President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran could meet in the next few
weeks to formally end the Persian Gulf war, which was halted by a
cease-fire in 1988.
   The conference sources said that as the heads of state met for a
second day today, moderates headed by Egypt and Saudi Arabia seemed
to gain ground, despite often heated debates over taking Washington
to task.
   They said on condition of anonymity that Saddam and King Hussein
of Jordan, who have favored a tough anti-U.S. line, agreed to take
a more moderate approach. They did not say what instigated the
change.
   ``President Saddam has switched to a balanced and prudent
approach that will placate hard-liners and satisfy the moderates,''
said one top Persian Gulf official. ``It's now up to the United
States to accord the Arabs due respect and handle the Middle East
more maturely and constructively.''
   The conference was called as a show of Arab unity against what
Saddam has said is a Western and Israeli campaign against Iraq. It
was also sought ways to stem the large-scale emigration of Soviet
Jews to Israel.
   The Arab leaders met behind closed doors in Baghdad's heavily
guarded conference center today. Sources said they were to complete
a memorandum on issues related to the Arab-Israeli conflict that
will be sent to the U.S.-Soviet summit, which convenes in
Washington on Thursday.
   Hard-liners such as Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, were
maintaining a low profile, sources said. Syria and Lebanon have
boycotted the Arab summit, while Morocco, Algeria and Oman sent
senior government officials.
   The turnout was seen as a clear sign of discord between
hard-liners and the moderates over how tough a line they should
take against the United States.
   Sources said Arab leaders were incensed by a 16-page U.S. State
Department note sent to the 21-member Arab League last week urging
Iraq to ``moderate both its action and its rhetoric'' and advising
the heads of state to avoid ``excessively ardent language.''
   The memorandum also called on the Arabs to recognize Israel and
uphold the right of Soviet Jews to emigrate to Israel if they want.
   The Arabs, particularly the hard-liners, viewed the State
Department document as an attempt by Washington to dictate policy.
Palestinian officials complained the Bush administration ``is
treating us like schoolchildren.''
   Many Arabs have been angered by the United States' policy
regarding the emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel _ expected to
reach 750,000 over the next years. They say Washington has driven
away many from the United States by tightening American immigration
restrictions.
   Arabs states contend Israel plans to settle many of the Soviet
Jews in the Israeli-held West Bank and Gaza Strip, land the
Palestinians declared part of a Palestinian state in 1988.
   The Arabs also say Washington has not done enough to pressure
Israel into agreeing to peace talks with Arafat.
   Speaking to the 15 kings, sheiks and presidents at the summit
Monday, Arafat reviled Washington for indirectly encouraging the
Soviet Jewish emigres to settle in Israel.
   ``We are duty bound to use all weapons, including sanctions _
economic boycotts and political and psychological pressures _
against states, establishment and companies that participate in
aggression against Arab territory,'' Arafat said.
   He berated the U.S. Congress for describing Jerusalem as
Israel's capital in recent, non-binding House and Senate
resolutions. ``This illegitimate declaration amounts to aggression
on Arab dignity,'' Arafat shouted.
   He said Arab sector of Jerusalem, conquered by Israel in 1967,
``is part of the Palestinian territory under Israeli occupation. It
is the capital of the state of Palestine.''
   Also Monday, Saddam warned again that Iraq will use ``weapons of
mass destruction'' against Israel if the Israelis used similar
weapons against Iraq or any other Arab country.
   He did not spell out what weapons he had in mind. But he was
apparently referring to Israel's nuclear bombs and Iraq's
burgeoning arsenal of long-range missiles and chemical weapons.
   ``The United States bears a basic and primary responsibility for
the policy of aggression and expansion practiced by the Zionist
entity against the Arabs,'' Saddam declared.

   Mayor Marion Barry, who faces trial on drug
charges next week, isn't ruling out a re-election campaign despite
advice that he give up on seeking a fourth term, some mayoral aides
say.
   ``There were meetings this week and everything was very
forward-thinking,'' one of Barry's top political aides said Monday.
``Everything hinges on this trial and what we are hearing is that
he will make no firm decision or announcement until after that.''
   A report published today, however, quoted unnamed Barry friends
as saying the mayor would consider a plea agreement provided he was
allowed to plead guilty only to misdemeanor charges.
   The Washington Post report said the friends stressed that no
talks were under way and that any deal would have to involve the
sealing of all evidence against Barry, including a videotape
allegedly showing the mayor smoking crack cocaine.
   Law enforcement sources told The Associated Press that no talks
between prosecutors and Barry had begun.
   The direction of the legal case should become clearer later
today, when a federal judge is scheduled to rule on a defense
motion to split the charges against Barry into two trials.
   The comments by Barry political aides indicating the mayor has
not ruled out seeking re-election were at odds with a Monday report
on WRC-TV that said Barry has told close advisers he will not seek
re-election.
   Barry, 54, is scheduled to go to trial June 4 for a variety of
drug and perjury charges stemming from his Jan. 18 arrest in a FBI
sting operation and a separate, 15-month federal probe into this
ties to a convicted drug dealer.
   The mayor, who entered seven weeks of substance abuse treatment
following his arrest, faces 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine
possession, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and three
felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug use.
   If convicted of a felony, Barry would be barred from holding
office or running for re-election. However, a Washington Post poll
released Friday showed that the mayor has held onto core supporters
since his arrest. The survey showed that Barry and city council
member John Ray lead a field of six with each receiving 23 percent
support.
   Barry has not publicly disclosed his re-election plans, but has
been making a series of campaign-style appearances around the city
in recent weeks. In addition, Barry campaign officials on Friday
picked up petitions for a potential re-election bid, the first
formal step to a possible candidacy.
   ``The mayor was pleased with the poll, and both he and others
have said in he last few days that it (the poll) is another
indication that he should keep his options open,'' said a top
political aide who met with him in recent days.
   ``However, there are plenty of people who are urging him not to
put himself and the city through this trial and to seek a deal,''
said an aide who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Some city officials and personal associates of the mayor's have
been encouraging Barry to seek a plea bargain agreement in hopes of
preventing their names from coming out during the trial, city
government sources said.
   Many of those urging Barry to avoid court proceedings seek to
avoid being put in the position of having to testify on whether
they ever saw Barry use drugs or if they were aware of his alleged
drug problem, one source said.
   ``It's a question of loyalty,'' said one city official.
``Regardless of what they may or may not know, they don't want to
be put in the position of testifying against their boss.''
   For the time being, aides familiar with Barry's campaign plans
say that volunteers will concentrate on gaining the 2,000
signatures needed to place his name on the ballot and then wait for
the trial.
   Prosecutors and R. Kenneth Mundy, Barry's attorney, have
estimated that the legal proceedings could take at least a month.
   To run in the city's Sept. 11 Democratic primary, the mayor must
submit his petition signatures by July 5.

   Three mayors within one county have
fallen under suspicion as a string of corruption allegations have
tangled Miami-area politics.
   The mayor of Hialeah has been indicted on federal racketeering
charges, the mayor of Miami Beach is under investigation after the
collapse of a savings and loan, and three-quarters of Sweetwater's
elected officials _ the mayor included _ face federal extortion
charges.
   All three cities are in Dade County, the densely populated area
of about 2 million people that includes Miami.
   Since his appointment two years ago, U.S. Attorney Dexter
Lehtinen, a former Republican state senator from Dade County, has
made corruption in public office his No. 1 priority.
   Some people question his motives.
   ``There is a major suspicion in this town that Dexter has
politicized the U.S. attorney's office,'' said Miami attorney
Jeffrey Weiner, vice president of the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers.
   The scandals in Hialeah and Miami Beach threaten the political
careers of two Democratic stars, both coming off landslide
re-elections in November.
   In Hialeah, Raul Martinez, mayor of Florida's fifth-largest city
since 1981, was indicted in April on charges of extorting nearly $1
million in cash and real estate from developers for zoning
approvals. He was suspended along with a city councilman who
allegedly traded his vote for $24,000 in cash.
   Martinez emerged as a potential challenger to Lehtinen's wife,
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, in last year's U.S. House race. But he stayed
out, and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen won the seat for the Republicans.
   The U.S. attorney's office said Lehtinen disqualified himself
from the investigation into Martinez, who has been under federal
scrutiny for years. Two other council members in the city of
200,000 have pleaded guilty to federal charges in the last three
years.
   No trial date has been set for Martinez, who faces up to 180
years in prison and $2.25 million in fines if convicted. Martinez,
41, has denied all charges, and his supporters say the case is
politically tainted.
   In Miami Beach, third-term Mayor Alex Daoud has not been charged
but is being probed by federal and state authorities and by the
Florida Bar.
   Among items being investigated are $35,000 Daoud received from
CenTrust companies before the thrift was taken over by federal
regulators, tens of thousands of dollars in renovations to his home
and thousands of dollars in gifts from Miami Beach socialites.
   Daoud, a popular and media-conscious mayor, has become
tight-lipped about his troubles except to make periodic denials of
any wrongdoing.
   On Friday, city inspectors found more than $235,000 in
improvements to Daoud's Sunset Island home, The Miami Herald
reported. Daoud lacked city permits for most of the work, did not
pay all required fees, failed to get final inspections and,

   In Sweetwater, Mayor Irain Gonzalez and five of seven council
members were named Jan. 25 in an extortion indictment.
   Two pleaded guilty, and the mayor and two council members are on
trial. Another council member, named as an unindicted
co-conspirator, testified against them in a case involving a
$10,000 bribe allegedly made by a developer for a zoning variance.
Jury deliberations began Friday and were recessed until today.
   Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez, a lawyer, said the accumulation of
scandals doesn't mean that city government in the booming Miami
metropolitan area is suddenly for sale. ``I guess it's just
circumstance,'' he said.
   He added, ``One of my partners is from a state in the Northeast
where they've had a lot of corruption, and he said some of the
stuff that he's been reading about here sounds pretty minor
compared to what he was used to.''

<HEAD>Presidents of Iraq and Iran Could Meet Soon to Formally End Gulf
War</HEAD>

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and
President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran could meet in the next few
weeks to formally end the Persian Gulf war, a senior PLO official
said today.
   Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat will
fly to Tehran this week in a bid to set up the peace talks, the
official said.
   ``The chairman will go to Tehran immediately after the Arab
summit,'' expected to end Wednesday, he said. ``Barring last-minute
complications, direct summit talks between Saddam and Rafsanjani
will be under way after a month.''
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Cyprus, today quoted Iranian
Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karrubi as saying Saddam and Rafsanjani
may meet, but giving no date.
   The PLO official said Arafat, attending the Arab meeting in
Baghdad, has sent two messages to Iran's spiritual leader, Ali
Khamenei, and to Rafsanjani, urging them to respond ``quickly and
positively'' to Iraq's offer.
   Saddam and Rafsanjani have also reportedly exchanged letters
recently.
   Iran-Iraq peace talks began five days after the U.N.-sponsored
cease-fire halted the war on Aug. 20, 1988. But they have been
deadlocked ever since.
   The PLO official said he expected a high-level Iran-Iraq meeting
in Moscow if Arafat's mission in Tehran was successful, followed by
a summit between Saddam and Rafsanjani. Moscow has offered to host
any summit, and both leaders have indicated willingness to accept,
diplomats said.
   There have been indications for some time that a breakthrough in
the stalled peace negotiations was possible.
   Iran has quietly dropped demands for huge war reparations and no
long insists Iraq should be blamed for starting the war in
September 1980.
   Iraq has reportedly dropped demands that the Shatt-Al-Arab
waterway, the southern boundary between the two countries and
Iraq's main outlet to the Persian Gulf, be cleared of sunken ships
before negotiations proceed.

   A melee punctuated by gunfire erupted among
25,000 hot revelers at an overcrowded outdoor rap concert. At least
11 people were injured, none seriously, and more than 20 arrested,
authorities said.
   Concertgoers hurled bottles, fistfights broke out and a man was
stabbed in the leg during the Memorial Day show at Herman Park.
   Mothers carried screaming babies under their arms as they fled.
   More than 200 officers on foot, horseback and in helicopters
evacuated the area. Police reported more than 20 arrests, including
two for gun possession.
   A 16-year-old boy received stitches after being hit in the head
by a baseball bat, said Donna Miller, a nurse at Hermann Hospital.
   ``Some people apparently started throwing beer bottles and then
I heard pop, pop, pop _ someone was shooting _ and then everybody
started running,'' said Ron Atkins, a spectator and program
director at another station.
   ``I heard about four gunshots and just started running,'' said
George Carver.
   The concert was canceled and police closed the park.
   Police will investigate whether concert promotors did everything
they could to secure the area, said police spokesman Al Baker.
   ``The attendance was well over capacity (17,000),'' said Parks
Director Don Olson. ``We have been trying to limit the number
attending events here.''
   Promoters had hired about 30 officers for security, said Joe
Libios, promotion director for KHYS, sponsor of the free concert.
The concert was delayed for at least two hours as promoters tried
to arrange for more security.
   ``You just can't put on a concert any more without any
incidents,'' said Libios. ``One bad apple or two bad apples ruined
it for the rest of us.''
   The disturbance erupted as the opening band began its second
song. Temperatures had reached 93 degrees, and witnesses said
several people had begun spraying each other with beer in the hot
afternoon sun.
   As people surged toward the stage, someone threw a bottle into
the crowd, and someone apparently angry at the people closing in
fired a gun, Olson said.
   Thomas Martin, 13, said people on a hill overlooking the stage
threw bottles at the audience inside the theater, hitting a youth.
   ``He walked from the front of the theater up the aisle with a
T-shirt wrapped around his head and blood running down his arm,''
Martin said.
   ``I never saw so much happen so fast,'' said Carolyn Smith. ``I
was crying, I was so scared.''

   Less than three years ago, Boris N. Yeltsin was
reviled in the Soviet press, attacked by top party officials and
rebuffed by his former mentor, Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Somehow, he turned it all to his advantage.
   Yeltsin, a burly 59-year-old Siberian, won election today to a
powerful and visible post _ the presidency of the Russian
Federation, by far the Soviet Union's largest republic.
   It wasn't a quick and easy victory. It took three strenuous
rounds of balloting in the Russian Congress. Gorbachev opposed
Yeltsin's candidacy.
   But once again, Yeltsin showed his talent for overcoming odds,
for seizing the moment, for using popular support to get what he
wants.
   And as usual, if powerful higher-ups stood in his way, it only
seemed to strengthen him and his populist message of radical
economic and political reforms and less power for the central
government.
   In 1985, Yeltsin, a construction engineer by trade, was an
obscure official in the Ural Mountains industrial city of
Sverdlovsk, not far from his native village of Butka.
   Then Gorbachev brought him to Moscow to take over the capital
city's Communist Party organization, and gave him a non-voting seat
on the ruling Communist Party Politburo.
   It didn't take Yeltsin long to start making waves.
   He showed little reverence for the party hierarchy. He
campaigned in stores and on trolley buses to improve food supplies
and public services. He spoke out against special privileges for
the government and party elite.
   The gravelly-voiced, white-haired Yeltsin quickly won a
following.
   ``People identify with Yeltsin,'' the weekly Moscow News wrote
last year in a full-page story headlined ``The Boris Yelsin
Phenomenon.''
   Muscovites were tired of watching their leaders rocket by in
sleek limousines while they stood in line to buy soap, sugar and
other scarce items. Yeltsin's borshcht-in-every-pot message had
immediate appeal.
   Like millions of other Soviet citizens, Yeltsin became
increasingly impatient with the pace of Gorbachev's reforms.
   Characteristically, he did not hesitate to say so. And
characteristically, he went too far.
   In 1987, he made a stinging speech to a closed meeting of the
Communist Party Central Committee, criticizing the slow pace of
reforms.
   That earned him a sharp reprimand from his former mentor
Gorbachev and brought vitriolic attacks from the party officials
who accused him of dealing a ``stab in the back'' to economic
reform.
   The criticism of Yeltsin was published in the press, he was
stripped of his post as Moscow party chief and hospitalized for
heart trouble. The word went out that he was finished politically.
   Gorbachev and Yeltsin never did patch things up, and Yeltsin
remained on the outs with top leaders.
   But he made that rift work for him. The open disdain of the
Communist Party apparatus enhanced Yeltsin's populist image and
helped him win the backing of millions of supporters.
   Gorbachev actively campaigned against Yeltsin's bid for the
Russian presidency. He told the Russian Congress last week that
Yeltsin's call for Russian sovereignty was ``an attempt to cut
Russia off from socialism.''
   Yeltsin in turn spoke against the Soviet government's program
for gradually transforming the country's crippled centrally planned
economy to a partial market economy.
   That program, which will eventually double the cost of food,
caused panic-buying in Moscow. Some congressional deputies said
Yeltsin's candidacy got a boost from public anxiety over the plan.
   Although Yeltsin's win today seemed like a sudden triumph, his
comeback didn't happen all at once.
   After his fall from political grace in 1987, he began rebuilding
his power base. That led to a landslide victory in March 1989 in
direct popular elections to the Soviet Congress of People's
Deputies, the national parliament.
   Yeltsin was swept into office with almost 90 percent of the
vote, crushing his apparatus-backed opponent.
   Later that year, he carried out a deft procedural maneuver to
win election to the Supreme Soviet, the national legislature.
   And early this year, he was elected a deputy of the Russian
Federation Congress, which today chose him president. He also
remains a member of the party's policy-making Central Committee.
   Now his image as a man who can take on the system and win is
stronger than ever.

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Robert B. Meyner, a fiscally
conservative Democrat credited with restoring his party in New
Jersey in the 1950s, has died after a long illness. He was 81.
   Meyner, who suffered a stroke four years ago, died in his sleep
Sunday at his home in Captiva, Fla., said his wife, Helen.
   ``He lived a very full, rich life, giving an awful lot to a lot
of people,'' said Mrs. Meyner, a congresswoman from 1974 to 1978.
   Meyner was New Jersey governor from 1954 to 1962, the first New
Jersey governor elected to successive four-year terms. State law
bars governors from serving three consecutive terms. He sought the
post again in 1969 but lost.
   Meyner won the governorship at a time when Republicans dominated
state government. He was New Jersey's first Democratic governor
since 1940. Meyney had previously served one term as a state
senator.
   Meyner was credited with keeping a balanced state budget, and
ably administering basic state needs such as water supply and land
management. He oversaw the completion of the New Jersey Turnpike in
the mid-1950s.
   From 1958 to early 1960, he was considered a candidate for the
Democratic nomination for president, but was not nominated.
   Meyner gave credibility to the governor's office and the state
Democratic Party, said former Gov. Brendan Byrne, Meyner's
secretary for two years.
   ``He took a boss-controlled Democratic Party and insisted on a
public integrity which remains the standard in New Jersey,'' Byrne,
governor from 1974 to 1982, said in a statement Monday.
   Meyner was born in Easton, Pa., on July 3, 1908, and was raised
in Phillipsburg and Paterson. After leaving public office he
returned to his law practice and served on the boards of several
corporations.
   In addition to his wife, Meyner is survived by a brother.

<HEAD>Court bars Massachusetts from forcing brokers to make arbitration
optional</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let states
require stockbrokers to give investors the option of suing, rather
than seeking arbitration, over alleged broker fraud.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that barred
Massachusetts from requiring brokers to make arbitration clauses
optional, not mandatory, in brokerage contracts.
   The Massachusetts appeal the court acted on today was supported
by 30 other states, whose officials said a federal appeals court
ruling leaves them ``powerless to protect consumers from being
coerced to enter arbitration agreements.''
   But the Bush administration told the justices the Massachusetts
appeal should be rejected.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston ruled Aug. 31
that the Massachusetts regulations are pre-empted by federal law.
   The brokerage industry customarily requires customers to agree
to arbitrate all disputes as a condition of opening an account.
   But in 1987, the justices ruled, by a 5-4 vote, that if such
arbitration clauses are in the contracts signed by investors,
disputes over alleged fraud are to be resolved in arbitration, not
in lawsuits.
   Massachusetts' secretary of state in 1988 imposed regulations
prohibiting brokers from making arbitration agreements
non-negotiable conditions for opening accounts. The regulations
also required brokers to tell customers about the legal effects of
mandatory arbitration clauses.
   The state's action immediately was challenged by the Securities
Industry Association and 10 brokerage firms affiliated with it.
   A federal judge ruled for the brokers, and the appeals court
upheld that ruling.
   ``The long and short of it is that we can find no evidence of a
clear congressional command to override the unambiguous
pro-arbitration mandate of the (Federal Arbitration Act) in the
securities field,'' the appeals court said.
   In the state's appeal, Massachusetts Attorney General James M.
Shannon said the August ruling ``has national implications for
state regulation of mandatory arbitration agreements in banking,
health care, (the) automobile and many other industries.''
   Shannon said the Federal Arbitration Act does not pre-empt all
state regulation of arbitration.
   Lawyers for the securities industry and the Justice Department
urged the justices to reject the state's appeal. Government lawyers
said federal law does pre-empt such state regulation.
   The case is Connolly vs. Securities Industry Association, 89-894.

   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
two Ku Klux Klan groups and four men ordered to pay more than
$800,000 for organizing a demonstration that turned into a violent
attack on civil rights marchers in Georgia.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
punitive-damages award did not violate the free-speech rights of
the KKK and its sympathizers.
   The civil rights demonstration in Forsyth County, Ga., was led
by state legislator Hosea Williams on Jan. 17, 1987, the birthday
of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
   The KKK staged a counter-demonstration intended to convince
blacks to stay out of the county.
   A half-hour before the civil rights march began, Grand Dragon
David Holland of the Southern White Knights of the KKK addressed
the counter-demonstrators.
   Holland, who later denied he was inciting a riot, told his
followers, ``We need to let them know that we're going to keep this
place white. Let's disperse and go greet those filthy half-ape
niggers, brothers.''
   The Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan was the second
group helping lead the counter-demonstrators.
   Klan members and sympathizers climbed fences and headed for the
marchers, throwing rocks and bottles and shouting obscenities and
racial epithets.
   As the counter-demonstrators surrounded the marchers and their
bus, law enforcement officials loaded the marchers onto the bus to
protect them and moved the bus away. The counter-demonstrators
pelted the bus with debris as it withdrew.
   The next day, Holland said in a speech in Raleigh, N.C., ``The
Ku Klux Klan sent that nigger Hosea Williams and his busload of
race traitors back to Atlanta ... with three or four windows busted
out of that bus.''
   He said any future march should be met with similar tactics.
   The marchers sued, and a federal jury decided that the KKK
groups and 11 individuals violated the marchers' civil rights.
   The jury awarded $2,500 in compensatory damages; more than
$700,000 in punitive damages against the KKK groups; $43,859
against Holland, and $26,316 each against Edward Stephens, Daniel
Carver Sr. and Franklin Shirley. Stephens and Carver were KKK
officers, and Shirley said he is a white supremacist.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the awards last
year.
   There is ample evidence the KKK groups and the individuals
``plotted not only to avail themselves of the opportunity to
express views contrary to those held by the marchers but also to
disrupt and stop the brotherhood march by violent means,'' the
appeals court said.
   ``A jury may award punitive damages in a civil rights action
upon its determination that the defendant was motivated by an evil
motive or intent or where the defendant was recklessly or callously
indifferent to federally protected rights,'' the appeals court
added.
   Lawyers for the counter-demonstrators said Holland, in
addressing the group prior to the march, was urging his listeners
``to jeer and to verbally abuse'' the marchers but not to attack
them.
   The attorneys also said the size of the punitive-damages awards
shows the demonstrators were punished ``for their unpopular
political and social views'' in violation of their free-speech
rights.
   The case is Stephens vs. McKinney, 89-1558.

<HEAD>Reward Offer Bringing in Tips in IRA Killing of Australians</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROERMOND, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dutch police alerted all border
guards, offered a reward and investigated dozens of tips today, but
they were unable to determine the identity of the IRA killers of
two Australian tourists.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for Sunday
night's shooting of the two Australians, saying it ``tragically
mistook'' them for British servicemen.
   The victims were driving a British-registered car, and the
attack took place in a district of this southern Dutch city
frequented by British soldiers stationed in nearby West Germany.
   Investigators said up to 20 people witnessed the shootings, but
no one had been able to give them a good description of the killers
of Stephen Melrose and Nick Spanos, Australian citizens who lived
in London.
   National Police spokesman Louis Steens said about 40 tips had
come in since police offered a $52,000 reward late Monday for
information leading to arrests in the slayings.
   In Australia, Prime Minister Bob Hawke today condemned the
killings and denounced the IRA's description of the two as
accidental victims of war.
   ``This sort of warped logic of war casualties adds insult to a
mortal injury,'' Hawke said.
   Although Dutch police immediately alerted border guards, it is
only a 10-minute drive from Roermond to the nearest Belgian and
West German border crossings, and the Belgian border is virtually
unguarded.
   Steens told reporters at National Police headquarters that
investigators believed it was ``sheer coincidence'' that the
Australians arrived just as an IRA hit squad was seeking a target.
Roermond's cafe district was the site of another IRA attack in 1988.
   Melrose, 24, was shot as he was preparing to take a picture of
the floodlit town hall. Spanos, 28, was shot inside their car.
   Melrose's wife Lyndal, 29, and Spanos' girlfriend, Vicky Coss,
24, were uninjured. They fled screaming for help, according to
eyewitnesses.
   Steens said the two women had returned to London and ``their
condition is still very bad.''
   ``They are in heavy shock,'' he said.
   He refused to provide certain details about the attack, such as
the number of bullets fired or the weapons used.
   Roermond residents laid a wreath and attached white and pink
carnations to police fences surrounding the shooting site in their
historic market square. A chalk outline of Melrose's body was still
visible.
   There are far more eyewitnesses of the shooting than in 1988,
when the IRA killed three off-duty British servicemen in
coordinated attacks here and in Nieuwbergen, 30 miles to the north,
said Steens. But witnesses to this attack disagree on the number
and description of the IRA gunmen, he said.
   The almost exclusively Catholic Irish Republican Army is
fighting to push the British out of Protestant-dominated Northern
Ireland, join it with the Republic of Ireland and set up an
all-Ireland socialist state.

   Hussein Onn, prime minister of Malaysia
from 1976 to 1981, died at a California hospital after suffering a
second heart attack in six weeks. He was 68.
   Hussein died Monday afternoon at Seton Medical Center in
suburban San Francisco, where he had been hospitalized for several
weeks, said a nursing supervisor.
   Hussein was admitted to the intensive care unit after suffering
a second heart attack in six weeks, said his son-in-law, Yahya
Awang, a heart surgeon.
   Yahya said the Malaysian Embassy in the United States was making
arrangements for the body to be flown back to the southeast Asia
nation where an official funeral was planned.
   Hussein was Malaysia's third prime minister. Hussein became
prime minister following the death of Abdul Razak in 1976. Hussein
was Razak's deputy and his brother-in-law.
   Hussein was a member of the United Malays National Organization
party, which has ruled the country since independence in a
coalition with Chinese and Indian parties.
   He resigned after a heart bypass operation in 1981 because of
his health.
   Hussein selected the present prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad,
to succeed him in July 1981. But the two broke with each other in
1987-88 when Mahathir sacked Malaysia's highest ranking judge,
arrested 106 people and detained them without trial. Mahathir's
actions resulted in formation of a rival party.
   But during the past 18 months, Mahathir and Hussein were said to
have reconciled their differences and to have held regular
consultations.

<HEAD>Court Expands Government Power to Keep Some Defendants Jailed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today increased the federal
government's power to keep some criminal defendants behind bars
while they await trial, even if a key bail law was violated.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, spared the government from having
to free on bail some defendants deemed to be dangerous or a risk to
flee before trial.
   The decision reversed a federal appeals court ruling that said
pretrial release is required _ even for a defendant who could have
been held in custody _ if a pretrial detention hearing is not held
the first time that person appears in court.
   ``The safety of society does not become forfeit to the accident
of the non-compliance with statutory time limits where the
government is ready and able'' to show release on bail is not
feasible, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the court.
   ``Neither the timing requirements nor any other part of the
(Bail Reform Act of 1984) can be read to require, or even suggest,
that a timing error must result in the release of a person who
should otherwise be detained,'' Kennedy said.
   Justices John Paul Stevens, William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall dissented.
   Writing for the three, Stevens said that in writing the bail law
Congress required prosecutors ``to turn square corners.''
   ``The court today, however, permits federal prosecutors to
violate the law with impunity.''
   The justices in 1987 upheld the federal law allowing denial of
bail before trial to people deemed dangerous to the community, even
if accused of non-violent crimes.
   Before the 1984 law, pretrial bail generally would be denied
only if a judge determined the defendant was likely to flee.
   In practice, however, federal judges could get around the old
law by setting very high bail, ostensibly aimed at guaranteeing the
defendant's appearance in court but effectively keeping the accused
in custody while awaiting trial.
   A provision in the 1984 law states that a hearing to determine
whether pretrial detention is justified must be held ``immediately
upon the person's first appearance before the judicial officer,
unless that person or the attorney for the government seeks a
continuance.''
   A federal trial judge and the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled that the ``first appearance'' provision of the law had been
ignored in the case of Guadalupe Montalvo-Murillo, charged with
possessing nearly $1 million worth of cocaine.
   Montalvo-Murillo, a Mexican legally living in this country, was
stopped in February 1989 while driving a pickup truck near the
Mexican border at Orogrande, N.M.
   U.S. Customs Service agents found 72 pounds of cocaine, with a
wholesale value of almost $1 million in the truck.
   At a Feb. 16, 1989, proceeding, a federal magistrate put off a
detention hearing until Feb. 21. After that hearing, the magistrate
decided to release Montalvo-Murillo on $50,000 bail.
   Government prosecutors appealed to a federal judge, who ruled
that Montalvo-Murillo posed both a danger to the community and a
risk to flee.
   But the judge ruled that the New Mexico magistrate, in
postponing the detention hearing for five days, violated the
federal bail law's ``first appearance'' rule. The judge said the
only appropriate remedy was the defendant's release on bail.
   Montalvo-Murillo was freed on $88,500 bail, and has been a
fugitive from justice ever since. He is believed to have fled to
Mexico.
   The case is U.S. vs. Montalvo-Murillo, 89-163.

   A man returning his infant son to his
estranged wife pulled a gun from a diaper bag and killed her and
his mother-in-law, then fatally shot himself in the head, police
said.
   The man, Micael Jefferss, 31, died early today at Vassar
Brothers Hospital.
   Dutchess County's second triple shooting in two days occurred
Monday in a YMCA parking lot in a front of a police officer who had
accompanied the mother to the meeting to exchange the 10-month-old
child, Lt. Arthur Regula said.
   Jefferss and his wife, Lavonne, 27, had been separated about
three weeks, police said.
   Jefferss normally had custody Fridays and Saturdays, and the
child was usually returned in front of the YMCA because it is a
public place, said Capt. John Doherty. But the boy's mother
complained to police Sunday that her husband had refused to give up
the child.
   Doherty said the mother had guessed Jefferss would show up at
the YMCA on Monday and had asked for an officer to accompany her.
   The officer arrived first and interviewed Jefferss, who was calm
and coherent, then returned to his patrol car to watch the
exchange, Doherty said.
   Jefferss placed the boy in a child's car seat, then returned to
his own car for a diaper bag. When he reached his wife's car again,
he pulled a gun from the bag and shot his wife and mother-in-law,
Vivian Shealey, 49, at close range, Doherty said.
   The officer was drawing his gun when the man shot himself,
Doherty said. The child was unhurt.
   On Sunday a Hyde Park man shot and killed his wife and wounded a
neighbor before killing himself with a shotgun.

<TEXT>
   Burma's main pro-democracy party is
claiming an overwhelming victory in the national election and said
today it would start setting up a constitutional government as soon
as its win is official.
   But Kyi Maung of the opposition National League for Democracy
said his party would be ``patient'' in seeking the transition to
civilian rule.
   The current military government seized power after a bloody 1988
crackdown on pro-democracy forces.
   A final official tally in Sunday's vote may take weeks, due to a
ng process. In vote-counting so far, the
military-backed party had yet to win a single parliamentary seat.
   Kyi Maung said his party was certain it had won at least 322
seats in the 492-seat national legislature, the Htutlaw.
   Official results reslow hand-countileased so far indicated victories
by wide
margins for the National League for Democracy in Burma's first
multiparty elections in 30 years. In races already decided, League
candidates were winning by an average of 72 percent of the vote to
about 15 percent for the pro-military National Unity Party, state
radio said.
   Of the 43 parliamentary races decided, the League won 41,
official radio reported. The other two seats went to other
pro-democracy parties.
   The Leas personally responsible for
paying the owed taxes.
   The controversy stemmed from the two types of federal taxes owed
by employers _ ``trust fund'' and ``non-trust fund'' taxes _ and
the differing consequences of non-payment.
   Trust fund taxes are those withheld from employees' paychecks,
representing those employees' personal income tax, unemployment
insurance and Social Security taxes.
   Should an employer fail to pay any trust fund taxes, the
government can collect an equivalent sum directly from the
officials who were responsible for collecting and paying them.
   An employer also may fail to pay its ordinary corporate income
taxes or other non-trust fund taxes _ those to be paid directly by
the corporation and not withheld or collected from someone else.
   The government generally cannot impose personal liability on
corporate officials if a corporation's non-trust fund taxes go
unpaid.
   A Massachusetts corporation called Energy Resources Co. filed
for bankruptcy reorganization in 1983 while owing about $1 million
in federal taxes, most of which were trust fund taxes.
   As part of its court-ordered reorganization, the taxes owed by
Energy Resources were to be paid over four years. In making the
first payment, the bankruptcy trustee told the Internal Revenue
Service to apply it to trust fund taxes owed.
   But the IRS refused, contending the payment could be applied to
the corporation's tax debt as the government agency chose.
   The same sequence of events occurred after a Rhode Island
corporation called Newport Offshore filed for bankruptcy
reorganization in 1985.
   Court documents did not indicate the business in which either
corporation was engaged.
   Federal judges in both states ruled that the IRS had to apply
the tax payments as specified, and those rulings were upheld by the
Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The appeals court acknowledged that having the trust fund taxes
paid off first hurts the government's chances of collecting all the
money owed.
   If the reorganized corporation were to run out of money with
trust fund debts still owed, the government might collect them from
the people who were to collect and pay that money. But if all the
trust fund taxes have been paid when a reorganized corporation runs
out of money, the government could not go after the corporation's
officers.
   Today's decision upheld the two corporations' legal victories.
   Writing for the court, Justice Byron R. White said a bankruptcy
court ``may order the IRS to apply tax payments to offset trust
fund obligations where it concludes that this action is necessary
for a reorganization's success.''
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun was the court's lone dissenter. His
vote was not accompanied by a written opinion.
   The case is U.S. vs. Energy Resources Co., 89-255.

<HEAD>Court Broadens Protection Against Double Jeopardy in New York Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a ruling broadening the
protection against double jeopardy, said today that a motorist who
pleads guilty to drunken driving in a fatal accident may not be
prosecuted later for homicide.
   The 5-4 ruling in a case from New York extends so-called double
jeopardy protection against multiple prosecutions for some criminal
defendants. The court said someone convicted of a relatively minor
offense generally may not be retried on more serious charges based
on the same alleged conduct.
   ``Drunk driving is a national tragedy,'' Justice William J.
Brennan wrote for the court. ``Prosecutors' offices are often
overworked and may not always have the time to monitor seemingly
minor cases as they wind through the judicial system. But these
facts cannot excuse the need for scrupulous adherence to our
constitutional principles.''
   The court barred a new prosecution of Thomas J. Corbin in an
Oct. 3, 1987, accident on Route 55 in LaGrange, N.Y.
   Corbin was accused of crossing a double yellow line and striking
two other vehicles headed in the opposite driection. Brenda Dirago,
who was driving one of the other cars, was killed.
   Corbin pleaded guilty 24 days later to drunken driving and
driving on the wrong side of the road. He was fined and his
driver's license was suspended for six months.
   The local judge who sentenced Corbin apparently was unaware
someone had died in the crash. No one from the Dutchess County
district attorney's office appeared in court when Corbin pleaded
guilty or was sentenced for the traffic violations.
   Two days after the January 1988 sentencing, the district
attorney's office learned what happened and won an indictment on
various criminal charges, including negligent homicide and reckless
assault.
   The New York State Court of Appeals threw out the indictment and
the prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court.
   Groups that favor stricter laws against drunken driving had
called the appeals court ruling an outrage that tramples on the
rights of victims.
   Brennan said today, ``The Double Jeopardy Clause bars any
susbsequent prosecution in which the government, to establish an
essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, will
prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant
has already been prosecuted.''
   He noted that prosecutors intended to introduce new evidence in
trying Corbin on homicide charges. But Brennan said the test of
double jeopardy is not whether the evidence at a new trial is
different, but whether the alleged offense is based on the same
conduct.
   Joining Brennan were Justices Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall,
Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, in a dissenting opinion, said the ruling
could hamstring prosecutors.
   ``It will require prosecutors to observe a rule we have
explicitly rejected in principle: that all charges arising out of a
single occurrence must be joined in a single indictment,'' he said.
   Also dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   The case is Grady vs. Corbin, 89-474.

   The leaf-devouring gypsy moth is coming, in
numbers never before seen on the continent, scientists and federal
officials say.
   ``You can almost take that to the bank,'' said Charles P.
Schwalbe, a U.S. Department of Agriculture expert.
   In 1981, the last time the gypsy moth population exploded, the
pest stripped the leaves from 12 million acres of trees and other
plants in the Northeast.
   Gypsy moth populations rise and fall in cycles averaging about
seven years. Now, scientists say, the region is due for another
boom _ and a huge one.
   Since 1981, the moth infestation has been expanding by about 10
miles a year from New England, and the moths now are stripping
foliage as far south as Virginia and Maryland and as far west as
Ohio and Michigan.
   Smaller outbreaks also have been spotted in California, Oregon,
Washington and Colorado, where the larvae apparently were
unwittingly transported by humans on the move, said Schwalbe,
director of USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
   Those smaller outbreaks, however, were more easily controlled
and are being eliminated, said Vic Mastro, an entomologist with the
USDA.
   The gypsy moth actually is a danger in its caterpillar stage,
eating more than a square yard of foliage by the time it matures.
   The attack against the pest has primarily involved spraying of
Baccillus thurigiensis, a bacterium known as Bt that attacks the
moth's digestive tract, and use of diflubenzuron, a chemical. But
they haven't stopped the pest.
   Scientists are looking to other methods, including release of
sterilized males to interrupt the moth's breeding cycle and use of
the pest's natural enemies, including the white-footed mouse and
nine kinds of parasitic insects.
   A Japanese fungus is credited with protecting large sections of
western Massachusetts last year.
   The most promising development, some say, are viruses such as
gypchek, which attacks the gypsy moth from the inside.
   Martin Shapiro, a scientist at USDA's Insect Pathology
Laboratory in Beltsville, Md., developed and is testing a virus he
nicknamed Abby _ for the town of Abington where it was isolated _
that apparently kills more moths faster. But it works best in a
large moth population and loses effectiveness in sunlight.
   Coming soon, Shapiro said, is the potion that will make Abby the
gypsy moth's nightmare. He said laboratory policy bars him from
disclosing details.
   Even with all guns blazing against the gypsy moth, however,
humans can hope only for a stalemate, scientists say.
   ``You can control it, but when you're talking about eradicating
the gypsy moth, there ain't no such animal,'' Shapiro said. ``We do
a good job with dodo birds and passenger pigeons, but there's
virtually no insect that's been eradicated.''
   A French political exile, Etienne Leopold Trouvelot, imported
the pest from France to produce a disease-resistant strain of
silkworm. In 1868 or 1869, the moth escaped into Trouvelot's back
yard in Medford. By 1923, the moth had spread throughout New
England.
   The U.S. Forest Service, which fights the largest infestations,
has spent since 1979 an average of $6.1 million a year to fight the
moth, said Ken Knauer, the agency's assistant director of forest
pest management.
   In the fiscal year ending in September, the Forest Service will
spend $13.6 million. Knauer said officials are telling Congress
they will need about $15.3 million in the next fiscal year.
   ``With the expanding area of the gypsy moth, we doubt that ever
again will we be spending less than $6 million,'' Knauer said.

<TEXT>
   President Patricio Aylwin has ordered
former military ruler Augusto Pinochet to hand over records of the
disbanded secret police and told the general to keep the army out
of politics.
   After the meeting Monday, Pinochet told reporters he would
provide the ``necessary information,'' but later denied holding any
such records.
   ``What files? I don't have any,'' said Pinochet, who still
commands the country's 60,000-man army.
   He was summoned to the government palace Monday and then forced
to face taunts from demonstrators and shouts of ``murderer!'' when
his armored car was denied entrance at the palace gate and he had
to walk inside.
   Visibly angry, he complained about the treatment to a police
guard. There was no immediate explanation of why Pinochet's car was
turned away.
   He met with Aylwin and Defense Minister Patricio Rojas for an
hour.
   A statement issued later by Aylwin's office said he asked
Pinochet for details on the dissolving of the National Information
Center, a secret police agency that human rights groups say were
involved in the torture and killing of dissidents during Pinochet's
16{-year military rule.
   The right-wing general took power in a 1973 coup and his
administration was marked by harsh repression of leftists and
accusations of human rights abuse.
   Aylwin won democratic elections in December and took office
March 11.
   According to the government statement, Aylwin ordered that
secret police files ``but put at the government's disposition, to
help prevent and combat terrorism.'' The National Information
Center was legally disbanded shortly before Pinochet relinquished
power.
   In recent weeks, however, there have been newspaper reports that
former secret policemen have been caught conducting surveillance of
officials of the new government.
   The general described the meeting as ``very cordial, very
friendly'' and said Aylwin asked for his help in fighting
terrorism. The government is hunting for leftist guerrillas
involved in the recent shootings of some formerly high-ranking
military officers.
   ``It was such an agreeable meeting that he invited the (army's)
generals to dine with him in June,'' Pinochet said, speaking to
reporters as he left his offices in the Defense Ministry building.
   Aylwin also complained about the ``political connotation'' of an
army statement that expressed concern about the creation of a
special commission to investigate human rights abuse during
Pinochet's rule.
   Aylwin told Pinochet the army had no authority to question the
panel's creation and should be trying to cooperate with it,
according to the statement.
   Pinochet replied he didn't mean to question Aylwin's authority,
although he had reservations about the investigation, the
president's statement said. ``He expressed the army's willingness
to cooperate,'' the statement said.
   Pinochet left the meeting by a private underground exit,
avoiding reporters. He told reporters later, however, that the army
statement on the human rights panel was not politically motivated.
   It was the first time Aylwin had summoned Pinochet to a meeting.
The two met at the palace three weeks ago at the request of
Pinochet, who then complained about the human rights commission.
   Pinochet called the December elections after a national
referendum in 1988 rejected extending his rule to 1997.
   However, a clause in the 1980 constitution, written by
Pinochet's administration, allows him to remain army commander
until 1998.

   A woman shot at her front door by
someone dressed as a clown has died and detectives say they have
several leads in the search for her killer.
   Marlene Warren, 40, died at Palms West Hospital in Loxahatchee,
where she had been in critical condition since Saturday's shooting
in an exclusive Palm Beach County community, detectives said.
   She was shot by someone who went to the door of her home
carrying a basket of red and white carnations and two balloons
floating on ribbons, witnesses told police.
   One of the balloons was stamped with the words ``You're the
Greatest.'' The other bore a picture of Snow White and the seven
dwarfs.
   After the shooting, the assailant left in a white Chrysler
LeBaron that witnesses said had no license plate.
   Sheriff's detectives said they were working on numerous leads in
the case but could not discuss details.
   ``We're still out there going crazy, still plugging away,'' Palm
Beach County Sheriff's Detective Lt. Lou Sessa said Monday.
   Mrs. Warren managed rental apartments her family owned. Her
husband, Michael, owns a car dealership in West Palm Beach.

   A luxury liner was refloated from a Delaware
Bay sand bar today and headed for port, after passengers were
ferried ashore, ending nearly two days of merry-making.
   The estimated 1,000 passengers on the 642-foot Regent Star were
treated to free food and drinks, sang Christmas carols and played
``The Newlywed Game.''
   ``I had a beautiful time,'' said Mary Poniatowsky, 66, a
Baltimore bar owner. ``A lot of people were partying, but I didn't
because I'm not a drinker.''
   ``It wasn't a bad party,'' said a woman passenger who was met by
friends and family at dockside.
   The ship had been headed for Philadelphia on the final leg of a
seven-day cruise from Jamaica when a small fire early Sunday
knocked out power and allowed the vessel to run onto a sand bar a
mile off Fortescue, N.J.
   Aboard were 1,360 people, including about 300 crew members.
Nobody was in danger during the two days aground, the Coast Guard
said.
   Efforts to push the ship free with tugboats were halted for fear
the vessel would spill fuel, and the passengers were transferred to
a ferry that normally runs between Lewes and Cape May, N.J.
   The cheering passengers were put ashore Monday night 100 miles
short of their destination and got on buses to be taken to their
cars at airports and bus stations in the Philadelphia,
Baltimore-Washington and New York City areas.
   The ship was finally refloated at high tide with help from
tugboats early today and initially was moved to an anchorage off
Slaughter Beach, Del., according to the Coast Guard.
   Coast Guard Lt. James Weakley said officials have not seen any
evidence of pollution. Divers were supposed to check the hull of
the ship today for leaks or other damage, but he said that plan was
scrapped because of the weather and a decision was made to take the
ship into Philadelphia.
   When the lights went out in the disco, passenger Kathleen
Hopkins said, ``everybody was singing `Hot, hot hot.''' Later they
sang Christmas carols and played an improvised version of ``The
Newlywed Game,'' she said.
   ``People started chanting `Drinks, drinks drinks,''' and free
mimosas started flowing, Hopkins said.
   Another passenger, Barbara Sowden of Wilmington, Del., said by
phone: ``It just gave us a great opportunity to party hardy a
little longer. We don't need a band, we make our own music.''
   Ann Burguieres, a spokeswoman for Regency Cruises, said,
``They're always well stocked. There is always plenty of food and
drink on a cruise.''
   Ms. Poniatowsky and Dorothy Klausmeyer, 63, a store clerk in the
Baltimore area, were the first two passengers off the ferry.
   ``What could you do? We slept, we took pictures,'' said Ms.
Poniatowsky.
   Ms. Klausmeyer said she ``heard a thud early Sunday morning when
the ship ran aground and I started to yell. I didn't know what was
happening, then they explained it to us and we were all OK.''

<TEXT>
   Soldiers and anti-government
demonstrators battled today for control of this oil-production
center, and at least five people were reported injured, including a
soldier.
   Initial reports from witnesses said the soldier died after he
was severely beaten by protesters. But, according to later
accounts, he was evacuated to Libreville, the capital, in critical
condition.
   Gunfire from soldiers backed by armored cars wounded at least
four demonstrators, witnesses said. Automatic rifle fire and
explosions of hand grenades could be heard in low-income areas of
the city.
   Soldiers also used tear gas against supporters of the opposition
Gabon Progress Party and arrested at least 20 people, including
three party leaders trying to negotiate the release of several
children. Witnesses said they saw them driven in away in military
vehicles.
   The fighting began last week with the death of an opposition
leader, and oil companies drastically cut production. Gabon earns
80 percent of its income from oil and would quickly run out of
money without it.
   President Omar Bongo's government imposed a state of siege
Monday night throughout Port Gentil's province and sent troops in
today to restore order.
   In Paris, today, the state-owned oil company Elf-Aquitaine
announced it would gradually resume production on its 60 offshore
rigs. Production was expected to reach half of the 101,000 barrels
normally produced per day, and climb to 80 percent Wednesday, a
company spokesman said.
   Security forces began moving into Port Gentil at dawn, sweeping
away barricades set up by protesters. Initially there was no sign
of resistance from opposition party supporters, whose leaders urged
them to put away their weapons, mostly hunting rifles.
   The trouble began May 23 with the still-unexplained death of
Joseph Rendjambe, secretary-general of the opposition Gabon
Progress Party in the capital, Libreville. His party members rioted
in several cities and took control of much of Port Gentil, burning
the French Consulate and taking some expatriate oil executives
hostage for several hours.
   The French government sent reinforcements to its garrison in the
former French colony. When the troops arrived in Port Gentil, the
hostages were freed.
   Bongo's government had been reluctant to use military force
against the opposition supporters despite destruction of government
and private property.
   But it acted when Elf Gabon and Shell Gabon shut down oil
production.
   Before the Gabon security forces began their push to take over
the city, French soldiers gathered 1,000 expatriate oil workers
into special centers where they could be protected or evacuated if
necessary. Nearly all wives and children of the workers already had
been evacuated, and a further 40 to 60 reportedly were flown out
today.
   Most of the expatriates were French, but their numbers also
included British, Belgian, Dutch and American workers.
   Oil company executives said they had been forced to shut down
oil production because of threats from the opposition party
supporters. The decision angered Bongo, who threatened to look for
other oil companies if production wasn't resumed.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department today asked the
independent counsel investigating former Housing Secretary Samuel
R. Pierce Jr. to investigate fresh allegations of political
favoritism at the agency.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh made the request in a May 25
letter to independent counsel Arlin M. Adams. A copy of the letter
was released today by the Justice Department after it was received
by Adams.
   In his letter, Thornburgh asked the court-appointed independent
counsel to review allegations of favoritism in the operation of the
Department of Housing and Urban Development's Urban Development
Action Grant Program and the Secretary's Discretionary Fund for
technical assistance and special projects.
   The request for Adams to broaden his inquiry was based on a
review of testimony recently given to a House subcommittee by
DuBois Gilliam, former deputy assistant HUD secretary for program
policy development and evaluation, according to the letter.
   Gilliam, who is serving an 18-month sentence for conspiracy and
accepting illegal gratuities, told a House subcommittee that Pierce
told him on several occasions to award HUD grants to projects that
were supported by influential Republicans.
   Gilliam, who operated the UDAG program, said Pierce ordered him
to ordered to approve a $2.3 million grant for an apartment complex
and shopping center on land owned by Hampton University, where
Pierce was a trustee.
   Gilliam told the House Government Operations subcommittee in
testimony earlier this month that Pierce told him to intervene in
projects in Cleveland, Miami and Nashville.
   Justice Department spokesman Daniel Eramian said Gilliam's
testimony about the operation of HUD during the Reagan
administration was reviewed by prosecutors in the criminal division.
   In his letter to Adams, Thornburgh said Gilliam's ``allegations
concerning how the funding decisions in these programs were made
are related to the allegations you are already investigating
concerning HUD's Moderate Rehabilitation Program.''
   Adams said in a statement that ``it would appear that in light
of Gilliam's testimony, it may be appropriate to redefine the
mandate of the independent counsel.''
   ``I shall, of course, carefully consider this letter from the
attorney general during the next few days and take action
promptly,'' said Adams, who noted he received the letter today.
   Adams was appointed by a special court earlier this year to
investigate allegations that Pierce and top aides defrauded the
government by awarding Moderate Rehabilitation Program grants on
the basis of political favoritism between 1984 and 1988.
   The narrow jurisdiction was sought by Thornburgh following
hearings last year by the same House subcommittee, chaired by Rep.
Thomas Lantos, D-Calif.
   Democrats in Congress have repeatedly asked Thornburgh to expand
the scope of Adams's jurisdiction.
   Gilliam's testimony, given under a grant of limited immunity
from prosecution, conflicts with Pierce's sworn assertions to the
subcommittee that he never ordered aides to approve specific grants.

   Candidates supported by the Solidarity
trade union held a strong lead over the Communists in community
council elections across the nation, according to unofficial
returns reported today.
   Preliminary results from the national General Election
Commission indicated that Solidarity candidates swept 59 of 60
seats in the Baltic port of Gdansk, where the union was founded
nearly a decade ago.
   Candidates backed by the union also were reported to be doing
well in the large cities of Warsaw, Krakow, Katowice and
Czestochowa in the first free elections for local councils since
World War II.
   There were 52,000 individual races for seats on more than 2,000
councils, and the official results were to be announced Wednesday.
   During four decades of Communist rule, Poland's ommunity
councils were largely under the control of the central government
in Warsaw, but the new ones will be autonomous.
   Despite strong campaign efforts, the reformed Communist Party
appeared to have done poorly.
   The Social Democrats, as the former Communists call themselves,
won two seats in the cities of Kielce and Czestochowa, four in
Opole, six in Lodz and 15 out of 341 seats in Warsaw, according to
the unofficial returns.
   Voter turnout was only 42 percent, and it appeared many people
stayed away because of confusion over the large number of parties
running candidates.
   Nearly 80 new parties have been formed in the last six months,
but many have not presented clearly defined programs.
   The most organized political force in the country is the local
Citizens Committees founded a year ago by Solidarity supporters to
contest elections.
   They faced competition in some areas.
   A group representing ethnic Byelorussians won a majority of the
vote in the town of Bialowieza, and about 25 percent of the vote in
two other towns in the northeastern province of Bialystok, not far
from the Soviet border.
   The Confederation for an Independent Poland, a small
anti-Communist group that has been politically active for a decade,
won three council seats in the city of Lublin, one in Katowice and
12 in Lodz. But Leszek Moczulski, the leader of the group, lost his
race in Warsaw.
   Residents of Gdansk province also voted on a referendum on the
construction of a nuclear power plant in Zarnowiec, the PAP news
agency reported today. It said 80 percent of the voters were
against the project.

<HEAD>Court Says Indian Tribe May Not Prosecute Members of Other Tribes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Indian tribe may not prosecute members of
other tribes for crimes on its reservation, the Supreme Court ruled
today.
   The court, by a 7-2 ruling, stripped the Salt River
Pima-Maricopa Indian Community in Arizona of the authority to
prosecute a California man accused of fatally shooting a
14-year-old boy.
   ``Indian tribes lack jurisdiction over persons who are not tribe
members,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the court as it
extended its 1978 ruling that barred tribes from prosecuting
non-Indians for on-reservation crimes.
   Kennedy said Indian tribes surrendered the sovereign authority
to prosecute non-Indians for crimes on reservations when the tribes
accepted the federal government's protection.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall dissented.
Writing for the two, Brennan said, ``I do not share such a
parsimonious view of the sovereignty retained by Indian tribes.''
   Albert Duro, a member of the Torres-Martinez Band of Cahuilla
Mission Indians in California, was accused of the 1984 killing on
the Salt River Indian Reservation near Scottsdale, Ariz.
   The victim, Phillip Fernando Brown, was a member of a third
tribe _ the Gila River Indian Tribe.
   Duro was living with his girlfriend on the reservation, and was
working for PiCopa Construction Co, which the Salt River
Pima-Maricopa Indian Community owns.
   His lawyers said Duro is living in California and denies the
tribe's charges. They said he is a fugitive.
   The case is Duro vs. Reina, 88-6546.

   Police were investigating why seven

weekend.
   None of the patients at University Community Hospital suffered
any ill effects, Jim Leljedal, spokesman for the Broward County
Sheriff's Office, said Sunday. He said there were no suspects.
   The hospital has beefed up security since the first incidents
were reported early Saturday, spokesman David Margulies said.
   Six of the seven fourth-floor patients had the tubes sliced
sometime before 3 a.m. Saturday, when nurses making routine rounds
discovered the cuts. One patient said he remembered a man entering
his room about that time, but could recall no other details,
Leljedal said.
   Twelve hours later, another IV line was discovered cut.

<HEAD>East Berlin Mayor Wants 3 West Berlin Officials in His Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Berlin's mayor-elect said today he wants
three city council members from West Berlin in his government, a
move that would strengthen new ties between the long-divided cities.
   Tino Schwierzina said there were no legal bars to his plans,
even though the four victorious World War II allies still have
ultimate control over Berlin. The United States, Soviet Union,
France and Britain are expected to relinquish that power as the
German states proceed with unification plans.
   Schwierzina's plan would be one of the most significant steps
toward reuniting the Berlins since the Berlin Wall was opened on
Nov. 9.
   However, the plan may face trouble in East Berlin, where
Schwierzina, a Social Democrat, has agreed on a governing coalition
with the conservative Christian Democratic Union.
   The Christian Democrats are expected to object because
Schwierzina wants two officials from West Berlin's Social
Democratic Party and one from the leftist Alternative List.
   The Christian Democrats are the opposition party in West Berlin
and have tight links with their counterparts in East Berlin.
   Likewise, the Social Democrats in both cities also have close
ties.
   Schwierzina named as possible candidates West Berlin Finance
Sen. Norbert Meisner, Construction Sen. Wolfgang Nagel and
Education Sen. Sybille Volkholz.
   The three have already said they are ready to work for both city
governments, he said.

   An ancient murrelet is drawing hundreds
of birdwatchers to the Bristol Channel in southwest England, far
from its normal habitat.
   ``This bird has never been recorded outside the northern Pacific
Ocean before, and its appearance in Britain is likely to be the
bird sighting of 1990,'' Richard Millington, who runs an
information service on rare bird visitors, said Tuesday.
   The visitor was first sighted in Jenny's Cove on Lundy Island in
the Bristol Channel.
   Millington's telephone service, Birdline, provided details of
boats for hire in the north Devon coastal town of Bideford to ferry
birdwatchers out to the island. One boat alone was hired to take
250 people to the scene.
   The ancient murrelet is a small member of the auk family of
diving birds. Its main breeding grounds are on the Aleutians and
other islands off western Alaska. In winter it flies south as far
as Korea.

   Dimitri de Grunwald, who produced the film ``The
Millionairess'' with Peter Sellers and Sophia Loren, has died at
age 76, a family death notice said Tuesday.
   De Grunwald died Saturday at his home in Hove on the English
south coast.
   He was the son of a czarist diplomat and was born in St.
Petersburg, now Leningrad, in 1914. His family brought him to
England when they escaped during the revolution.
   De Grunwald started his career in a chemical company, then moved
to advertising and became a movie producer on his own account after
collaborating with his brother, Anatole, in making films, including
``The Way to the Stars,'' ``The Winslow Boy'' and ``The
Demi-Paradise.''
   After ``The Millionairess'' in 1960, in which Sellers played an
Indian doctor, de Grunwald produced ``Shalako'' with Sean Connery
and Brigitte Bardot, ``Murphy's War'' with Peter O'Toole and other
movies.
   He started a new career in 1980 as a consultant to a
pharmaceutical company.
   De Grunwald is survived by his wife, Vera, and a son. His
brother died in 1967.

   Edward Fernconde was in custody and charged with the fatal
stabbing of Gale Stanley Critchfield, 20, of Payson, Utah, police

   Critchfield was attacked while walking home late Sunday in
Clondalkin, outside Dublin, after making a series of house-to-house

   With the help of a colleague, Critchfield was able to reach his
apartment, where a roommate called an ambulance. He died early
Monday in hospital.
   Critchfield was one of 160 workers with the Mormon Missions in
Ireland and had been in the mainly Roman Catholic country since
March 1989.
   Police said Fernconde, who is unemployed, made brief court
appearances Monday night and Tuesday morning for the formal filing
of the murder charge.

<HEAD>Proposal to Disarm Majority of Police Alarms French Officers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evoking the image of London's bobbies, the interior
minister has suggested that most French police officers do not need
to carry guns. Police unions are aghast, saying French crooks don't
share the English sense of fair play.
   ``Why not demand the disarmament of the whole planet?'' asked
Bernard Deleplace, leader of the largest police union, at a news
conference Tuesday.
   ``In our Latin countries, the criminals are better-armed than
the police,'' he added.
   Interior Minister Pierre Joxe ignited the controversy Monday
with a spontaneous comment during a discussion about proposed
legislation affecting France's 10,000 municipal police.
   Joxe said he not only agreed with a proposal to disarm these
officers, but also believed that a vast majority of the 120,000
members of the national police force had no need to carry arms.
   To back his argument, Joxe cited the example of London, where
only 2,552 of the 26,800 police officers are authorized to carry
guns.
   All major police unions responded to the comments with surprise
and alarm.
   ``When the crooks have learned English fair play, then maybe
we'll see,'' said a spokesman for a union of detectives. ``Crime
isn't going to decrease, and we mustn't disarm the police.''
   Roger Chaix, former director of the national intelligence
service, rejected Joxe's comparison with London.
   ``Crime doesn't have the same characteristics in Britain as in
France, where unfortunately there is extremely violent crime,'' he
told the newspaper Le Figaro.
   According to union estimates, weapons are carried by most of the
80,000 uniformed officers in the national police force, and 95
percent of them would oppose disarmament.

   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Ethiopian rebels said Tuesday they ``completely
routed'' government troops southeast of Asmara, the besieged
capital of Ethiopia's northernmost province.
   The Eritrean People's Liberation Front said in a clandestine
radio broadcast that it began an offensive Monday along what it
called the Segeneyti Front, 30 miles from Asmara.
   The broadcast gave no details, referring only to a ``strong
offensive'' that ``also routed enemy soldiers who arrived in
support.''
   The Eritreans' boast came as newspapers in Addis Ababa claimed a
government victory over Tigrean rebels in central Ethiopia. The
newspapers said government soldiers killed 1,450 rebels of the
Tigre People's Liberation Front in fighting for control of a
strategic mountain pass.
   There was no way to verify either of the claims.
   The Eritreans seek independence for the northern province of
Eritrea, a former Italian colony. They captured the Red Sea port of
Massawa on Feb. 8 and cut off all but air access to Asmara.
   The Tigreans are fighting to oust President Mengistu Haile
Mariam and establish a hard-line Marxist government.
   The newspaper reports Tuesday said government troops battled
Tigre rebels around Debre Lebanos, 50 miles north of the capital.
   ``A large number of terrorist bandits was captured and sizeable
caches of heavy and light arms and equipment seized,'' the
newspapers said.
   The reports did not specify when the fighting took place, but
sources said the battle was Friday and Saturday. It was in the same
area where the Tigreans said they ``annihilated'' two government
battalions earlier in the week.
   Debre Lebanos lies on a pass through a mountain range and
controls the main road from Addis Ababa northwest to Gojam, the
Horn of Africa nation's main agricultural region.

   Derek C. Bok, president of Harvard
University since 1971 and one of America's foremost educators, has
resigned his post, it was announced today.
   Peter Costa, a spokesman for the university, could not
immediately offer reasons for the resignation or any details of its
timing.
   Bok, a Stanford University graduate, earned a law degree from
Harvard in 1954. He joined the Harvard Law School faculty in 1958
and became dean of the school in 1968.
   Bok, 60, is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, and author of several books, including one on labor law
that he wrote with Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox.
   During his tenure as Harvard's president, Bok established both
the John F. Kennedy School of Government and revived an
undergraduate core curriculum based on the study of classics.
   Bok often made headlines with his conservative views on
education and business, including a controversial stand against a
movement for total divestment of the university's holdings in
stocks of companies doing business in South Africa.
   Among his challenges, he headed the school during sometimes
violent anti-Vietnam War demonstrations, and negotiated with black
students and professors arguing over the years for better minority
representation.
   But most of Bok's efforts were low-key as he worked behind the
scenes to maintain traditions at Harvard, which celebrated its
350th anniversary in 1986 and has one of the nation's richest
endowments.
   There had been wide speculation in academic circles that Bok
would step down following the celebration marking the Cambridge
institution's founding in 1636.
   Bok is the son of a Pennsylvania Supreme Court judge, and his
grandmother was the daughter of H.K. Curtis, founder of Curtis
Publishing Co., which published the Saturday Evening Post.
   He married Sissela Myrdal, the daughter of Swedish sociologist
Gunnar Myrdal, in 1955. He and his wife, who has a doctorate in
philosophy from Harvard and teaches at Brandeis University, have
three children.

   The 450-pound tortoise, named Peter, has taken the quarter-mile

zoo spokeswoman Hannah Jennings.
   Some plants distracted him and he stopped to eat them.
   At 1:15 p.m., the keepers gave up, loaded Peter onto a truck and
hauled him the rest of the way.
   The tortoise, from Aldabra Island in the Indian Ocean, was

<TEXT>
   Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin triumphed over
opposition from Mikhail S. Gorbachev to win the presidency of the
largest Soviet republic today in what he called ``Russia's social,
economic and spiritual rebirth.''
   After three hard-fought ballots in the 1,060-member Russian
Congress of People's Deputies, Yeltsin won 535, four more than the
majority he needed. Russian Premier Alexander Vlasov, received 467
ballots.
   Yeltsin now poses a substantial challenge to Gorbachev, who
retains the two most powerful jobs in the country: president of the
Soviet Union and general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party.
   However, Gennadi Gerasimov, spokesman for the Soviet Foreign
Ministry, said Yeltsin's election could strengthen Gorbachev's
campaign for economic reforms.
   ``Yeltsin's victory is an expression of general discontent with
how things are going in the Soviet Union's biggest republic,''
Gerasimov told reporters at the United Nations in New York.
   ``The Soviet Union is a democracy, so we accept what the Russian
parliament has decided. It may be a blessing in disguise. President
Gorbachev has his critics from both the left and the right, and
possibly it is better to have the election of a critic from the
left,'' he said.
   Igor Malashenko, foreign policy advisor to the Communist Party
who accompanied Gerasimov at the news conference, agreed.
   ``This victory of Yeltsin has been misinterpreted as a problem
for Gorbachev,'' Malashenko said. ``Yeltsin is also a reformer,
although he reflects concepts which are different from Gorbachev.
   ``In this respect I believe it (the election) can strengthen the
cause of reform in the Soviet Union. Today, many people blame
Gorbachev for problems and now they have another person to blame.''
   After the election result was announced in the Grand Kremlin
Palace, the burly 59-year-old Yeltsin, strode to the podium,
received warm applause and cheers from fellow lawmakers, and was
handed a bouquet of flowers.
   Yeltsin said he felt ``a certain satisfaction, but at the same
time, I have much more a feeling of responsibility at this turning
point for Russia and the country.''
   ``I pledge not to spare anything _ health or time _ to do
everything to get out of this crisis and lead Russia to better
times,'' Yeltsin said in his victory speech.
   He called the day ``the beginning of the road to Russia's
social, economic and spiritual rebirth, the way out of the crisis
and toward the blossoming of Russia as a sovereign, independent
government in the framework of our union.''
   Gorbachev actively opposed Yeltsin's election, telling the
Russian Congress last week that his platform of moving political
and economic power from central to local authorities would lead to
a ``breakup of the union.''
   The Russian Federation is by far the largest of the 15 Soviet
republics, stretching from the Baltic Sea in the west to the
Pacific Ocean in the east. It is home to one-half the country's 285
million people and includes Moscow.
   As the president of Russia, Yeltsin will have a highly visible
platform from which to wage his campaign for more radical reforms
than those pursued so far by Gorbachev.
   The victory marks an amazing comeback for Yeltsin. Less than
three years ago, he was reviled in the Soviet press, attacked by
party officials, rebuffed by his former mentor, Gorbachev, and
considered finished politically. Gorbachev had brought Yeltsin to
Moscow to head the city's Communist Party, but he was fired in 1987
after showing little reverance for party hierarchy.
   Yeltsin, however, made his rift with Gorbachev work for him.
   The popular and outspoken Yeltsin had lost the second round of
voting on Saturday by just 28 votes. He lost the first round Friday
with 497 ballots to 473 for Krasnodar regional Communist Party
chief Ivan Polozkov.
   He was nominated again Monday and faced Vlasov, who had
Gorbachev's support, and Valentin Tsoy, a little-known businessman
from the Soviet Far East, who received 11 votes.
   After his election, Yeltsin walked through the Kremlin grounds
with reporters and well-wishers. After passing through the Spassky
Gate, he was joined by more supporters.
   ``Thank you! Thank you for our future!'' one man shouted.
Yeltsin mounted the steps of an embankment below the Kremlin wall
for an impromptu speech to supporters who rushed across the
cobblestone street. To shouts of ``victory!'' Yeltsin pledged to
work for a ``renewed Russia.'' The crowd pledged support.
   ``We're prepared to go together with him into tough times.
Everyone says that,'' one crowd member, Nadezda Matveyeva said.
   During his campaign, Yeltsin called on the Congress to reject
the Kremlin's new program for gradually transforming the country's
crippled, centrally planned economy to a partial market economy.
   ``The Congress must take the citizens of Russia under its
defense,'' he said. The reform program, which would triple the
price of bread on July 1 and double the cost of other foodstuffs
starting Jan. 1, caused panic buying that prompted Moscow city
authorities to bar sales to non-residents of the capital.
   Gorbachev, who left Moscow today for a Washington summit, went
on national television Sunday night to try to calm fears. But
anxiety is high and the list of items being rationed is on the rise.
   Yeltsin has broadly outlined a plan that would more rapidly seek
a transition to a market-based economy, giving more freedom to
enterprises and entrepreneurs.
   Lawmakers said Monday they believed Yeltsin's offer of a
coalition government in the republic bolstered his chances to win
today's round.
   Discontent over the government's economic program also boosted
Yeltsin's campaign, said one of his backers, lawmaker Leonid
Gurevich of Murmansk.
   Some economists have estimated that up to 40 million people
could lose their jobs as a result of the central government's
reforms, expected to drive many inefficient businesses into
bankruptcy.
   Under the three-step reform plan, to be implemented through
1995, 60 percent of state enterprises would be sold to the public
sector, and controls would be lifted on 60 percent of prices.

<HEAD>Soviet Admiral Confirms Nuclear Submarine Incident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet admiral Tuesday confirmed that a
nuclear submarine suffered a mishap near Norway in December, but he
denied reports that it leaked radiation.
   The Soviet youth newspaper Komsomolskaja Pravda reported in
February that a MIKE-class submarine spread radioactive
contamination after a reactor or atomic missile accident.
   ``I can confirm that a nuclear submarine was involved in a
mechanical failure situation, but it made it to land under its own
power. There was no danger for the crew or of a radiation leak,''
said Adm. Aleksi Sorokin at a news conference in the Soviet Embassy.
   ``Our youth newspapers sometimes sensationalize things,'' said
Sorokin, who was in Norway visiting military bases and meeting with
government leaders.
   He said the accident occurred 345 miles from land, ``in an area
between the Barents Sea and the Norwegian Sea,'' but gave no
details.
   Norway, a member of the NATO alliance, has complained that the
Soviets failed to issue adequate warnings in three other accidents
aboard nuclear submarines last year.
   In the worst previous accident, a Mike-class submarine sank in
the Norwegian Sea on April 7, 1989, killing 42 Soviet sailors.
   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Sigrid Romundset said the December
incident was ``probably not serious enough that we would expect to
be informed.''

   About 20 monuments were discovered damaged Saturday 100 yards
from the graves of Anthony, Edward Bausch and Henry Laumb, said
Mary Lou Tyndall, manager of the city's division of cemeteries.
   ``These are literally priceless,'' she said. ``Some of them date

   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley received $32,000
in speaking fees last year, according to House financial disclosure
forms made public today.
   Foley, D-Wash., donated $5,000 of the honoraria to charity. In
1988, when he was House majority leader, Foley accepted $34,750 in
speaking fees.
   Foley also got a healthy boost in salary when he was elected
House speaker to succeed Rep. Jim Wright, D-Texas, a year ago after
Wright was forced to resign. Foley's salary _ half a year as
majority leader and half as speaker _ was $107,034. He also
reported receiving $26,462 on the sale of various stocks managed by
a blind trust.
   All House members were required to submit the financial
disclosure forms, which listed assets and liabilities as well as
income from salaries and outside sources and gifts. Senate
financial disclosure forms will be made public Wednesday.
   The House Democratic leadership last year underwent a traumatic
shift as a result of the resignations of Wright and Rep. Tony
Coelho, D-Calif., both of whom were caught up in allegations of
financial irregularities.
   But the scandals that brought about the leadership changes
prompted no differences in attitudes toward accepting speaking fees
from various groups.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, catapulted into the majority
leader's post last year, accepted $34,500 in honoraria and donated
$7,500 to charity.
   But the speaking fees accepted by Foley and Gephardt were
dwarfed by their leadership colleague, Rep. William H. Gray III of
Pennsylvania, the assistant majority leader. Gray received $164,098
in speaking fees and gave $139,098 to charity.
   House members are allowed to keep honoraria totalling up to 30
percent of their congressional salaries. The base salary for House
members was $89,500.
   Not all benefits that went to House members came from their
speaking ability.
   Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., received $14,000 in
income from designing jewelry, most of it for people in Colorado.
   Rep. Les Aspin. D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, can see all the baseball games he wants. He received an
American League baseball pass from Bud Selig, owner of the
Milwaukee Brewers and a National League pass from the late A.
Bartlett Giamatti, who was National League commissioner at the time.
   Among Republican leaders, Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the
assistant minority leader, saw his speaking rise sharply from a
total of $28,550 in 1988, to $67,491 last year.
   Gingrich, who came under criticism last year for the royalty
arrangement on a book he wrote, gave $40,704 of his honoraria to
charity _ $29,304 of that to the Atlanta Zoo.
   Minority leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., received $49,300 in speaking
fees and donated $21,540 to charity.
   As usual, Michel, an avid golfer, listed items received from his
participation in various charity tournaments, including shoes, golf
balls, jackets and shirts.
   The categories for assets and liabilities were in ranges that
made it impossible to precisely calculate the wealth of some
members.
   For example, Amory Houghton Jr., a New York Republican who is an
heir to the Corning Glass Works fortune, listed his assets as a
range from at least $5,046,937 to more than $7,460,000. But there
was no way of estimating how much more than the second figure
Houghton was worth.
   Rep. Julian C. Dixon, D-Calif., chairman of the House Ethics
Committee, included the income and holdings of his wife, Betty, in
his form.
   Mrs. Dixon's dividend income was listed as exceeding $100,000 in
1989. It came from her interest in Mir Kanon@Peideau, an airport
stores partnership. And the value of her stock was listed as
exceeding $250,000.
   According to previous financial disclosure forms, Dixon's wife
invested between $5,000 and $15,000 in the partnership in 1986.
Last year, Dixon listed the value of his wife's investment in the
partnership at between $100,000 and $250,000.
   As usual, Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., was one of the
leaders in speaking fees.
   Schroeder reported accepting honoraria on 72 occasions in 1989
for speeches, writings and television appearances. She reported
keeping $26,313 of her total honoraria, $500 less than the maximum
allowed.

   Here's a list that would make David
Letterman proud: the best excuses for avoiding traffic tickets.
   ``One person said he was reaching for his hamster, because the
thing got loose in the car. One guy said he couldn't read, so he
couldn't read the speed limit sign,'' said police Cpl. Ray
Schexnider, known as ``Write 'Em Up Ray''
   Schexnider has handed out 10,882 tickets in seven years and
keeps his excuse collection in a battered yellow notebook.
   ``I have the 66 best excuses, but there are some duplications,''
he said. ``The most popular one is, `I'm late for work.' And it
doesn't matter what time it is, either.''
   Some people want to see how the road works. Others claim their
car can't possibly go as fast as the ticket says. One speeder said
he was on the way to help a cow give birth. Another was hurrying
home to check his motor, because a cat was caught in it.
   But sometimes Schexnider softens up.
   Once, he said, a man stopped for speeding said he wanted to get
to the hospital before his wife's operation began. Schexnider
believed the man and let him go.
   He later got a letter from the man, saying his wife had died on
the operating table and Schexnider had given him the extra minutes
he needed to see her.

<TEXT>
   A freight train derailed near Fairbanks
and spilled more than 100,000 gallons of jet and diesel fuel, state
officials said.
   The southbound train with more than 50 cars derailed at about
1:30 p.m. Monday, said Arnold Polanchek, vice president of
operations for the state-owned Alaska Railroad Corp.
   No one was injured in the derailment and the company still was
investigating the cause, Polanchek said.
   Railroad cleanup crews and state Department of Environmental
Conservation officials were on the scene, about 40 miles south of
Fairbanks near Dunbar Station, Polanchek said.
   The fuel probably would have run into nearby Goldstream Creek
were it not for some beaver dams nearby that held it back, a state
environmental official said. There were no immediate reports of
whether any beavers or other wildlife were harmed.
   Polanchek estimated the spill at 60,000 to 80,000 gallons. But
Paul Bateman, Fairbanks program manager for the state environmental
department, said Tuesday that more than 100,000 gallons was a more
accurate estimate.
   ``We've got cars upside down, sideways, holed on both ends.
They're in all shape and condition. It's a mess,'' said Bateman,
who spent Monday night at the scene. He said at least 14 cars were
leaking. Polanchek earlier had said 18 tank cars left the track and
eight or nine were leaking fuel.
   By early today, pumps and hoses had begun pumping the fuel off
the ground, Bateman said. Broken tanker cars were scattered on both
sides of the track.
   A bulldozer was used to build a temporary earthen dike around
the spill, Polanchek said.
   ``It should all be contained. It hasn't gotten to any moving
water,'' he said.
   The fuel was on its way to Anchorage from the Mapco Alaska
Petroleum Inc. refinery in the town of North Pole, near Fairbanks.
   The Alaska Railroad was purchased by the state from the federal
government in 1985. It runs one freight train northbound and one
train southbound daily.
   Passenger trains also make the run between Anchorage and
Fairbanks, serving the Denali National Park and Preserve, where
Mount McKinley is located.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether states may impose mandatory life sentences without
possibility of parole for people convicted of possessing large
amounts of drugs.
   The justices said they will study the appeal of Ronald Harmelin,
convicted in Oak Park, Mich., of possessing more than 650 grams of
cocaine.
   Harmelin contends that his life sentence without possibility of
parole violates the Constitution's ban on ``cruel and unusual
punishment.''
   Michigan courts rejected that contention.
   The justices were told Michigan is the only state that imposes
such a mandatory sentence. But if the state sentencing law is
upheld, other states might follow Michigan's lead in their fight
against drug use.
   Oak Park police stopped Harmelin's car for going through a red
light May 12, 1986. Police found more than a pound of cocaine when
they searched the car's trunk.
   The appeal acted on today attacked Harmelin's conviction as well
as his sentence, but the justices said they were limiting their
review to the sentence.
   In other words, they left intact Harmelin's conviction.
   The appeal said: ``There is no other crime in Michigan for which
the punishment is mandatory life without parole except for
first-degree murder.
   ``A person with a long criminal record could commit the foulest
of atrocities _ hacking off limbs or poking out eyes of children or
attempting to assassinate public officials _ without even the
possibility of receiving a sentence as high as Ronnie Harmelin,''
the appeal said.
   The appeal added, ``This mandatory sentence law does nothing to
deter the real drug kingpins, nor does it help protect society from
drugs.''
   But Michigan prosecutors defended the sentence as they urged the
justices to reject Harmelin's appeal.
   ``While the defendant portrays himself as an innocent and
misguided individual with no prior record, it is clear that he
possessed well over 650 grams of cocaine, some of which was
individually packaged for apparent resale,'' the state prosecutors
said.
   They noted that he also possessed other drugs, a gun and a
beeper.
   But Harmelin was not convicted of distributing drugs or of
possession of drugs with intention to distribute.

<TEXT>
   A Michigan appeals court spent two sentences rejecting
Harmelin's constitutional challenge to his sentence.
   ``Defendant's last claim is that the mandatory sentence of life
imprisonment is entirely out of proportion to the seriousness of
his crime and constitutes a cruel and unusual punishment proscribed
by the U.S. Constitution's 8th Amendment and (the state
constitution). We disagree,'' the appeals court said.
   It cited a previous state appeals court ruling for that
conclusion.
   The Michigan Supreme Court refused to hear Harmelin's appeal
last Jan. 29.
   The case is Harmelin vs. Michigan, 89-7272.

   The Supreme Court agreed today to review
federal regulations that bar government-financed family planning
clinics from counseling about abortion.
   Critics of the regulations, issued by the Reagan administration
in 1988, allege they violate free-speech and abortion rights.
   At stake is the future scope of a federal program with a $200
million yearly budget. The program funds over 4,000 clinics serving
some 5 million low-income women nationwide.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Agreed to decide whether states may impose mandatory life
sentences without possibility of parole for people convicted of
possessing large amounts of drugs.
   The justices said they will study the appeal of Ronald Harmelin,
convicted in Oak Park, Mich., of possessing more than 650 grams of
cocaine.
   _ Broadened the protection against double jeopardy, saying that
a motorist who pleads guilty to drunken driving in a fatal accident
may not be prosecuted later for homicide.
   The 5-4 ruling in a case from New York extends so-called double
jeopardy protection against multiple prosecutions for some criminal
defendants. The court said someone convicted of a relatively minor
offense generally may not be retried on more serious charges based
on the same alleged conduct.
   _ Rejected an appeal by two Ku Klux Klan groups and four men
ordered to pay more than $800,000 for organizing a demonstration
that turned into a violent attack on civil rights marchers in
Georgia.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
punitive-damages award did not violate the free-speech rights of
the KKK and its sympathizers.
   _ Increased the federal government's power to keep some criminal
defendants behind bars while they await trial, even if a key bail
law was violated.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, spared the government from having
to free on bail some defendants deemed to be dangerous or a risk to
flee before trial.
   _ Refused to revive a lawsuit in behalf of a child abused after
Illinois officials placed her isn the home of her aunt and uncle.
   The court, without comment, turned away arguments that public
officials should not be shielded from federal suits when they
knowingly expose children to abuse in foster homes.
   A federal appeals court in New York upheld the ban on abortion
counseling but other federal courts ruled it is unconstitutional.
The high court's decision, expected sometime in 1991, should
resolve the conflicting rulings.
   The family planning program, enacted by Congress as Title X of
the Public Health Service Act, pays for creating and operating
family planning clinics. The 1982 law forbids clinics to use the
federal money to perform abortions, but initial regulations let the
clinic staffs tell women about the abortion option.
   After those regulations drew fire from anti-abortion groups, the
government barred clinics from using federal money to advise women
that abortion is an option or to refer them to abortion clinics.
   The newer regulations say federally funded clinics may not
``encourage, promote or advocate abortion as a method of family
planning'' or distribute written materials on abortion.
   The regulations also require a family planning clinic that
receives federal money to keep physically and financially separate
any abortion clinic it might operate without federal money.
   If a woman visiting a federally funded family planning clinic
asks about abortion, doctors and counselors are barred from saying
more than that the program ``does not consider abortion an
appropriate method of family planning'' and to offer help in
obtaining prenatal care.
   New York state and New York City officials, the directors of two
family planning clinics, Planned Parenthood and other organizations
challenged the 1988 regulations in federal court the same day they
were issued.
   The lawsuit contended the regulations go far beyond the
restrictions imposed by the 1982 law, and that they impermissibly
interfere with freedom of speech and women's choice to obtain
abortions.
   U.S. District Judge Louis L. Stanton in New York City upheld the
regulations, and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed by a
2-1 vote last Nov. 1.
   After stating that the regulations are consistent with the 1982
law, the appeals court ruled that the regulations do not violate
any constitutional right of pregnant women or family planning
clinic staff members.
   ``The government has no constitutional obligation to subsidize
an activity merely because the activity is constitutionally
protected,'' the appeals court said. ``The government may validly
choose to favor childbirth over abortion and to implement that
choice by funding medical services relating to childbirth but not
those relating to abortion.''
   n the appeal acted on today, challengers said the federal
regulations represent a kind of ``viewpoint discrimination.''
   ``Because these regulations require the provision of
misinformation they do more than encourage childbirth. Rather, they
constitute a direct interference with a protected activity,'' the
appeal said.
   ``Women who have come to rely on Title X for medically sound
advice will be misled. The silence of a trusted doctor on the
subject of abortion will lead many women to believe that abortion
is not an appropriate or medically indicated option for them,'' the
appeal added.
   Bush administration lawyers, although contending that the 2nd
Circuit court was right, urged the justices to review the case to
resolve conflicting rulings.
   The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last
March that the regulations are unconstitutional. So did a federal
judge in Colorado.
   The cases are Rust vs. Sullivan, 89-1391, and New York vs.
Sullivan, 89-1392.

   An agreement to expand _ and possibly
quadruple _ commercial air travel between the United States and the
Soviet Union is ready for signing at the summit, while negotiators
are still working on deeper cuts in nuclear weapons.
   The agreement, concluded on Sunday, will expand the travel route
to involve more carriers and cities and inaugurate regular cargo
flights between the two countries. It represents closer ties
between the superpowers as Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
tries to get a grip on his troubled economy.
   In another sign of U.S.-Soviet cooperation, U.S. officials said
Monday that the Soviets had informed the Bush administration that
they would begin dismantling the long-disputed Krasnoyarsk radar
facility in eastern Siberia.
   The arms negotiations, meanwhile, resumed today at the State
Department after more than nine hours of talks over the holiday
weekend. They are dealing with projected cutbacks in long-range
nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines, as well as a stalemate in
negotiations to cut troops, tanks and other conventional weapons in
Europe.
   Any announcement will be withheld until the summit, Margaret D.
Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said.
   However, another U.S. official said none of the strategic arms
issues had been settled but there was some progress on methods of
verifying cutbacks in conventional weapons. ``That's good news,''
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A brief press notice late Monday gave no indication whether any
progress was made. Any announcement of a breakthrough is expected
to come from President Bush or Secretary of State James A. Baker
III.
   In any event, the two sides already have reached agreement on
many of the main points of a new treaty to reduce their strategic
nuclear weapons arsenals. A declaration will be issued by Bush and
Gorbachev at their four-day summit meeting, which opens in
Washington on Thursday.
   The air travel accord will add four U.S. cities and six Soviet
cities to current airliner routes, under an agreement to be signed
at the summit.
   U.S. officials said Monday the agreement could quadruple air
travel between the two countries and, for the first time, would
provide regular cargo service. It will allow six additional U.S.
airlines to operate as well as a planned new Soviet airline to
participate in service between the two nations.
   Only Pan Am and the Soviet airline Aeroflot now fly U.S.-Soviet
routes serving New York, Washington, Moscow and Leningrad.
   Additional U.S. cities to be provided service are Anchorage,
Alaska; Chicago, San Francisco and Miami. The new Soviet cities are
Kiev, Minsk, Magadan, Khabarovsk, Tbilisi and Riga, in Latvia.
   In addition, the two sides agreed to allow at least 100 annual
charter flights over the North Atlantic route and to consider up to
100 charters across the Pacific.
   U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
final details involved a compromise on the percentage of rubles
paid by Soviet travelers that Moscow will guarantee to convert into
U.S. dollars.
   The United States originally insisted on 15 percent while the
Soviets only wanted to guarantee 6.5 percent. Negotiators settled
on a compromise that 8.75 percent of the space on U.S. airliners
flying out of the Soviet Union would be purchased with rubles
convertible to dollars.
   A number of U.S. carriers have expressed interest in competing
with Pan Am for the expanded service, including Delta, United,
Alaska Air and Northwest.
   The Soviet decision to begin dismantling the Krasnoyarsk radar
facility would overcome one obstacle in the way of the strategic
arms treaty. Both the Reagan and now the Bush administrations have
said they would not sign a strategic arms reduction treaty until
the giant radar facility is dismantled.
   ``We recently saw signs that this is going on,'' said one
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Reagan administration had contended the installation
violated the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty which imposes
strict limits on radar. After protesting initially, the Soviets
eventually relented and said they would dismantle the facility.
   The two countries' arms control negotiating teams met in three
sessions Sunday totaling 6{ hours and then for 2} hours on Monday.
   The U.S. delegation was headed by Undersecretary Reginald
Bartholomew and the Soviet group by Deputy Prime Minister Viktor P.
Karpov, an experienced arms control negotiator.
   Gorbachev sent the negotiators initially to take up a half-dozen
unsettled strategic weapons reduction issues.
   But a U.S. official, declining to be identified, said the talks
also dealt with cuts in U.S. and Soviet troops, tanks, artillery
and airplanes in Europe.

   The people who live in the hillside
slums of this Central Asia city have little faith in the latest
Kremlin plan to salvage the economy.
   ``Honestly, I don't believe anyone anymore,'' said Valentina
Bludova, 57. She said she was fired from the nearby slaughterhouse
after she was struck on the head by a falling piece of machinery
and knocked out.
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov last week announced a plan for
a painful transition to what he called a ``regulated market,'' in
which the state will surrender much of its control over the economy.
   When Muscovites heard they could expect food prices to double
and widespread layoffs, they began buying out the stores.
   Halfway across the country, in Kazakhstan near the mountains
separating the Soviet Union from China, shoppers have not panicked.
   However, residents expressed little hope in the future. They
predicted the government would have a hard time winning support for
a program that officials say will entail a two-year recession.
   ``I don't think it will be any better for me,'' said Tamara
Sukhikh, 37, who earns $243 a month as a janitor in a packaging
factory. ``I fear higher prices. How can I take care of my family?''
   Mrs. Sukhikh lives with her husband and two children in one of
many two-room shacks built from wooden scraps and tar paper. The
hovels are privately owned, but the land beneath them belongs to
the state.
   The rain pours through plywood ceilings of the home built by
Mrs. Sukhikh's parents just after World War II. Half the family
sleeps on the floor.
   A young mechanic lounging along Polezhayeza Street smoked
cigarettes with friends in front of his weathered wooden shack that
houses his wife, two children, his mother, and three other families.
   The toilet is outside. Water is hauled from a communal faucet
down the steet. Residents say in the nearly 50 years since the
shacks were built, the authorities have never even mentioned the
possibility of plumbing.
   The mechanic says he gets ``promises, promises, promises'' when
he asks city authorities for an apartment. ``They take our
documents and later they give them back,'' he said, refusing to
give his name.
   ``If they would let me buy land, I would build a house and a
garden,'' he said.
   One of the government's announced reforms would allow the people
of this slum _ and those in millions of shacks and slums throughout
the country _ to buy a building lot.
   ``I don't believe it,'' the mechanic said. ``The bureaucrats
will just take my documents and keep them and do nothing.''
   As it is, he doesn't even dare repair the leaky roof of his
shack. ``If I did, they would ask `Where did you get the material?'
and give me a fine,'' he said.
   Mrs. Bludova, the former slaughterhouse worker, ran afoul of the
bureaucrats when she took the housing situation into her own hands.
   A widow who says she was abandoned by her second husband when
she was unable to bear children, she bought a shack just big enough
for a stove and a table. She paid 10,000 rubles. That's $16,600 at
the official rate, or roughly six years' salary, not including the
land.
   Scrounging a board here and there, she gradually added 2{ rooms
herself. ``I lived well,'' she said proudly.
   She soon discovered, however, that she needed permission for
each improvement. And she found that the woman who had sold her the
house, who is now dead, had not transferred the documents into her
name.
   The bureaucrats discovered this and ``yelled and yelled at me,
and I broke down in tears and ran away,'' she said.
   Now, she fears any attempts to better her living conditions will
bring her back to the attention of the authorities.
   After decades of promised reform, the slum dwellers aren't the
only ones in Alma Ata who have grave doubts about the government's
economic plan.
   ``If the economists can't make up their minds what to do, how
can I decide if their are right?'' asked Murlan Zhanobilov, a
lawyer with the Kazakh Supreme Court.
   Legalization of private land would help, he said, ``but nobody
believes that. Without a guarantee that if we build a three-story
house, it won't be taken away, nobody will believe it,'' he said,
shaking his head.
   Soviet citizens remember the millions who died in the
collectivization drive of the 1930s for the crime of being owners
of private farms. In Kazakhstan, memories are fresher.
   Five million of the republic's 16 million people came to its
remote steppes when Stalin forcibly deported whole nationalities in
the 1940s, Zhanobilov said.
   Alma Ata authorities confiscated homes as recently as three
years ago, he said.
   Bureaucrats said it was part the ``campaign against unearned
income'' and converted the houses to kindergartens and other
institutions, he said. They told residents: ``Prove where you got
each brick.''
   Since many of the houses were 20 and 30 years old, Zhanobilov
said, ``How could they?''

   CBS' fall schedule features a revamped prime
time lineup with seven hours of new programming and a first-run
movie package, the network's top entertainment executive said today.
   ``This is a strong, first step in the process of rebuilding our
prime time lineup,'' said Jeff Sagansky, president of CBS
Entertainment, introducing his first full schedule since taking
over the job last year.
   CBS has been in third place for three consecutive seasons, but
came close to beating front-runner NBC in the just-completed May
sweeps _ although it did so with a mix of specials and movies that
pre-empted its regular programs.
   CBS offers four new half-hour situation comedies _ ``family
comedies with breakout star potential,'' _ and five hourlong dramas
aimed at attacting more family viewing in the 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. time
period, Sagansky said.
   Fox Broadcasting Co. was expected to announce its fall schedule
late today.
   Sagansky said CBS will have new shows in the 8 p.m. to 9 p.m.
slots on five nights. The first-run, pre-cable movie package
includes such hits as ``Born on the Fourth of July'' and ``Field of
Dreams,'' he said.
   The new sitcoms are the movie spinoff ``Uncle Buck''; the NBC
castoff ``Hogan Family''; the blue-collar ``Lenny''; Burt Reynolds
in ``Evening Shade,'' as a former pro football star who coaches a
high school team; and a widower firefighter raising four children
in ``Four Alarm Family.''
   The five hourlong series include ``The Flash,'' adventures of
the high-speed superhero; ``WIOU,'' about the cutthroat world of
local television; ``The Hammersmiths,'' a ``comedic and poignant''
family saga; ``Over My Dead Body,'' a murder mystery with Edward
Woodward and Jessica Lundy. There also will be network television's
first prime time pro-environment series, ``The Green Machine,''
about a team of experts who right ecological wrongs.
   Shows getting the ax included ``Tour of Duty,'' ``Falcon
Crest,'' ``The Amazing Teddy Z,'' ``City,'' ``Sydney,'' and ``Sugar
&amp; Spice,'' but Sagansky said ``Paradise'' may be renewed.
   ``Wiseguy,'' a crime series, has been relegated to backup
status, with Ken Wahl to return in the first few episodes when the
show returns to the air, but with a new actor, Stephen Bauer,
replacing Wahl as a new undercover agent.
   CBS' news shows ``60 Minutes'' and ``48 Hours'' return to the
fall schedule, along with what was ``Saturday Night with Connie
Chung.''
   Miss Chung's show was given a new format and shifted to Monday
night as ``Face to Face with Connie Chung.'' The show in that
incarnation got two test-runs during the May sweeps and scored high
ratings.
   Sagansky played down suggestions that the CBS schedule is not as
unconventional as that of its two major rivals, each of which have
music-drama shows and, in ABC's case, the return of the quirky cult
favorite ``Twin Peaks.''
   ``What makes a show unconventional is the way it's executed, not
cops singing or whatever is behind `Twin Peaks,''' Sagansky told
reporters at a news conference at the CBS Broadcast Center.

<HEAD>Soviet Industries Destroying Last European Wilderness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATTI HUUHTANEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet pollution is choking Finnish
Lapland, threatening what is considered Europe's last wilderness,
scientists say.
   Some experts predict ecological death for the pristine pine
forests and arctic tundra in a decade unless quick action is taken.
   ``We are used to drinking water from the lakes and streams in
Lapland. But if the pollution continues at current levels, I give
the region 10 years,'' said Satu Huttunen, professor of botany at
the University of Oulu in north Finland.
   Finnish Lapland makes up about a third of the country and is
largely uninhabited by humans. Home to bears, wolves, moose and
other animals, it also provides a recreation area for skiers and
canoeists.
   Finnish officials say the problem begins with large Soviet
nickel and apatite plants in the Kola Peninsula that spew out
770,000 tons of sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere each year.
   Most of it falls into Soviet territory, but foresters in
northeast Finland have reported increasing levels of pollutants.
   ``Some of the sulphur concentrations are three times higher than
the vulnerable arctic nature can tolerate. In fact, concentrations
in some Finnish cities are lower than in the isolated corner of
Lapland,'' Mrs. Huttunen told The Associated Press.
   Last week, Prime Minister Harri Holkeri visited the Soviet
industries in the region with Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Stepan
Sitaryan.
   ``It was just plain devastation. Everywhere you looked for
kilometers around, the trees and vegetation were dead. The whole
place was polluted, under heavy black dust,'' said Jyrki
Myllyvirta, Holkeri's special assistant.
   Myllyvirta said Sitaryan ``was visibly shocked'' by what he saw,
but was unsure how fast the Soviets would begin to clean it up.
   The two countries have signed an agreement to halve
trans-boundary air pollution, measured by 1980 levels, in the next
five years.
   ``But we have experienced in the past that there are many
problems in the Soviet Union when it comes to applying new
technology,'' Myllyvirta said in an interview.
   Mrs. Huttunen and other researchers say that to save Lapland,
sulphur emissions must be cut by at least 90 percent without delay.
   ``Otherwise, there is no hope. The pollution levels are much
higher than any of us believed,'' said researcher Jaana
Reinikainen, who recently returned from northeast Lapland.
   ``We knew of totally destroyed forest areas of some 10 hectares
(25 acres), but now we found areas as big as 400 hectares (1,080
acres) which were badly damaged,'' Mrs. Reinikainen said.
   The Finnish Outokumpu mining company is negotiating the sale of
new flash-smelting technology to the Soviets that it says would
reduce sulphur emissions by more than 97 percent.
   An Outokumpu official said the new technology could be running
at full capacity in the Kola Peninsula within three years at a cost
of $375 million.
   Press reports said the Soviets had rejected Outokumpu's
technology in favor of their own. Myllyvirta denied the reports.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Tuesday by the Supreme Court.
   
   ABORTION COUNSELING
   
   The court agreed to review federal regulations that bar
government-financed family planning clinics from counseling about
abortion.
   Critics of the regulations, issued by the Reagan administration
in 1988, allege they violate free-speech and abortion rights.
   At stake is the future scope of a federal program with a $200
million yearly budget. The program funds over 4,000 clinics serving
some 5 million low-income women nationwide.
   The cases are Rust vs. Sullivan, 89-1391, and New York vs.
Sullivan, 89-1392.
   
   DRUG SENTENCING
   
   The court agreed to decide whether states may impose mandatory
life sentences without possibility of parole for people convicted
of possessing large amounts of drugs.
   The justices said they will study the appeal of Ronald Harmelin,
convicted in Oak Park, Mich., of possessing more than 650 grams of
cocaine.
   The case is Harmelin vs. Michigan, 89-7272.
   
   DRUNKEN DRIVING
   
   The court broadened the protection against double jeopardy,
saying that a motorist who pleads guilty to drunken driving in a
fatal accident may not be prosecuted later for homicide.
   The 5-4 ruling in a case from New York extends so-called double
jeopardy protection against multiple prosecutions for some criminal
defendants. The court said someone convicted of a relatively minor
offense generally may not be retried on more serious charges based
on the same alleged conduct.
   The case is Grady vs. Corbin, 89-474.
   
   KU KLUX KLAN
   
   The court rejected an appeal by two Ku Klux Klan groups and four
men ordered to pay more than $800,000 for organizing a
demonstration that turned into a violent attack on civil rights
marchers in Georgia.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
punitive-damages award did not violate the free-speech rights of
the KKK and its sympathizers.
   The case is Stephens vs. McKinney, 89-1558.
   
   BAIL
   
   The court increased the federal government's power to keep some
criminal defendants behind bars while they await trial, even if a
key bail law was violated.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, spared the government from having
to free on bail some defendants deemed to be dangerous or a risk to
flee before trial.
   The case is U.S. vs. Montalvo-Murillo, 89-163.
   
   CHILD ABUSE
   
   The court refused to revive a lawsuit in behalf of a child
abused after Illinois officials placed her isn the home of her aunt
and uncle.
   The court, without comment, turned away arguments that public
officials should not be shielded from federal suits when they
knowingly expose children to abuse in foster homes.
   The case is Doe vs. Bobbitt, 89-1218.
   
   TAX DEBTS
   
   The court made it more difficult for the federal government to
collect all taxes owed by bankrupt corporations.
   By an 8-1 vote, the court thwarted the government's attempt to
hold officials of bankrupt corporations personally responsible for
paying the owed taxes.
   The case is U.S. vs. Energy Resources Co., 89-255.
   
   OVERSEAS BANKS
   
   The court, in a case with potentially billions of dollars at
stake, ordered further hearings to decide whether U.S. banks with
branch offices overseas must pay depositors after foreign
governments freeze those accounts.
   The court, by an 8-1 vote, set aside a ruling that required
Citibank to pay a depositor whose account was frozen by the
Philippine government of Ferdinand Marcos.
   The case is Citibank vs. Wells Fargo, 88-1260.

<HEAD>Jovanovich Resigns From Publishing Company, Former Energy Sec
Appointed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds 3 grafs with Jovanovich son's role, background on
Herrington. A longer version moved on financial wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Jovanovich has resigned as chairman of
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. and his successor at the publishing
company is former U.S. Energy Secretary John S. Herrington.
   ``Forty-three years is enough, especially since I now can devote
my time to editing books and writing them,'' Jovanovich, 70, said
in a statement issued today by the Orlando, Fla.-based company.
   Jovanovich is the author of several novels and one is scheduled
for release in the fall. He edited Mary McCarthy until her death
last November and currently edits Diana Trilling.
   During Jovanovich's tenure, the company's revenue grew from $8
million in the 1950s to $1.3 billion. The company's authors include
Alice Walker, Umberto Eco, Mark Helprin and Charles Simic, who won
the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for poetry. The company also publishes
scientific and medical books and journals and operates a large
insurance business as well.
   Jovanovich arranged an infusion of capital in 1987 that enabled
the company to avoid a takeover by British media baron Robert
Maxwell. But the resulting heavy debt prompted the company to sell
its six theme parks, including four Sea World parks.
   Herrington has served as a member of the Harcourt board since
May 1989. He called Jovanovich ``an American publishing legend, a
pioneer in educational technology and an industry giant who built
the best independent publishing house in America.''
   The company issued a statement that Jovanovich also had
submitted his resignation as chairman of the company's executive
committee.
   He will be replaced in that position by his son, Peter
Jovanovich, 41, who was named chief executive and president of the
company last December.
   Herrington, 51, served as energy secretary in the Reagan
administration from February 1985 to January 1989. He had been
assistant secretary of the Navy from 1981 to 1983.

<HEAD>Legislation Would Tie More U.S. Aid to American Purchases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Senate committee chairmen on Tuesday
proposed revamping U.S. foreign aid to make it more supportive of
American business interests overseas.
   Sens. David Boren, D-Okla., and Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said a
larger portion of U.S. economic aid should be tied to purchases of
American goods and services. They proposed legislation to boost the
figure from the current 7 percent to 40 percent by 1996.
   Competitors such as Japan, West Germany and France already make
heavy use of such ``tied aid,'' they said.
   ``More and more, we have come to understand that competition in
the world today is primarily economic'' rather than military, Boren
said at a news conference. He said polls show Americans are
increasingly disenchanted with foreign aid spending.
   Boren, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said he and
Finance Committee Chairman Bentsen were being joined in the effort
by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the Appropriations
Committee.
   Their suggestion is likely to join various ideas for revamping
foreign aid as Congress seeks to adapt a decades-old aid system to
the new realities of Eastern European democracies and collapsing
centrally planned economies.
   Many of the ideas reflect a need for aid to be aimed less at
military security for friendly nations, as it has been through the
Cold War era, and more at economic warfare.
   Boren called it a ``tragic waste'' that the United States gave
most of its recent $800 million in aid to Poland in cash, with no
strings attached, while West Germany and Japan gave nearly $3
billion that could be spent only to buy goods from those countries.
   ``I think it is time we adjust to what our economic competitors
are doing,'' Boren said. ``We should offer American goods when
developing nations are cleaning up their environment and building
their infrastructure, transportation systems, communications
networks and new plants with new technologies.''
   Boren proposed as a safeguard that the shift of aid money not
penalize the poorest countries, particularly those in Africa, which
now receive direct grants for programs like public health,
population control and agricultural development.
   The proposal also included a 15 percent increase in the ceiling
for direct loans by the Export-Import Bank to finance purchases of
U.S. goods by overseas buyers, increases in other credit programs
tied to purchase of American products, and a new $1 billion loan
guarantee program for Eastern Europe to encourage ``an aggressive
U.S. presence'' in that new market.

   The U.S. edition of a private Soviet business
weekly is making its debut this week to coincide with the
Bush-Gorbachev summit.
   ``The idea is to give practical information and objective
information, which is more or less unusual for the Soviet press,''
said Vladimir Yakovlev, creator and editor-in-chief of Commersant.
   The paper, aimed at the Soviet and foreign businesses in the
Soviet Union, started publishing in Russian and English in January.
It has a domestic circulation of 350,000 and the new
Soviet-American edition is expected to attract up to 60,000
subscribers at an introductory rate of $165 a year.
   Commersant covers topics such as the launch and failure of joint
ventures, the accurate but unofficial dollar exchange rate and
Soviet government decisions affecting business.
   It was the first to report on the government's planned economic
reforms.
   The paper advises readers about how to start a business, where
in the country it is risky to invest, how to attract foreign
capital and how to invest rubles. It will also list stock prices
when the Soviet Stock Market opens in September.
   The front page of a special summit issue says Commersant has
been ``published since 1908,'' but was ``suspended from 1917 to
1990 for reasons beyond its control.''
   One piece in the summit issue of Commersant compares the Soviet
economy to a cramped leg _ ``you can move it neither forward nor
backward nor can you remain still because of the pain.''
   Asked if he had any competitors, Yakovlev laughed and said,
``Not yet.'' But he said he hoped someone would start a daily
Soviet business newspaper, allowing him to publish less news and
more analysis.
   Yakovlev, 31, is founder and chairman of FACT, his country's
largest business databank. It employs more than 400 people.

<HEAD>Court Rules in Cross-Country Divorce Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today effectively extended
the long arm of the law in the case of a couple who split up and
now live on opposite coasts.
   The justices, voting 9-0, said New Jersey resident Dennis
Burnham must answer to courts in California in a divorce suit by
his wife, Francie Burnham.
   The court ruled that someone who visits a state may be sued
there by a state resident even if the visitor has only minimal
contacts with that state. The ruling is likely to have significant
impact in other divorce and custody cases.
   Burnham was greeted by a process server in January 1988 when he
went to California to spend some time with the couple's children
who live with their mother in the San Francisco area.
   The Supreme Court said today that Burnham's presence in
California, although brief, was enough for the California courts to
have authority over him in the divorce proceeding.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, in the court's main opinion, said
Burnham's due process rights are not violated by forcing him to
contest his wife's divorce claim in California.
   ``Jurisdiction based on physical presence alone constitutes due
process because it is one of the continuing traditions of our legal
system that define ... notions of fair play and substantial
justice,'' he said.
   Joining his opinion were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   The other five justices agreed that Burnham's rights were not
violated but in separate concurring opinions declined to go along
with Scalia's reasoning. They supported a case-by-case approach
precluded by Scalia's broader pronouncement.
   The Burnhams were married in 1976 and lived in New Jersey until
they separated in July 1987 when Mrs. Burnham took their two
children to California.
   Burnham sued for divorce in 1987 in New Jersey, accusing his
wife of desertion. She said the suit violated their agreement that
they were splitting up over ``irreconciliable differences.''
   When Burnham visited his family in January 1988, he took one of
the children on an outing to San Francisco. When he returned to his
wife's home in nearby Mill Valley, he was served with a summons and
a copy of her divorce petition.
   The California courts denied his motion to quash the service of
process, rejecting arguments that he only had minimum contacts with
the state.
   Court papers did not specify where Burnham lives in New Jersey.
   The case is Burnham vs. Superior Court of California, 89-44.

<TEXT>
   Burma's first competitive election in 30
years may have given this impoverished nation a chance to start
anew in building a democratic government.
   But skepticism and anxieties persist about how the powerful
military, which has held authoritarian power since 1962, will react
to the turn of events.
   To the surprise of many analysts, the country's leading
opposition party, the National League for Democracy, appears to
have scored a huge victory over conservative, pro-military forces.
Final results from Sunday's general election may not be in for
weeks, but in vote-counting through Tuesday, the party backed by
the military had yet to win a single seat in the 492-seat
parliament.
   The National League for Democracy had won 41 of the 43
parliamentary seats decided and said it was certain it would hold
at least 322 seats when counting was finished.
   The mood in this city of crumbling, British colonial-era
buildings has changed dramatically since the vote.
   Saturday, people dared not take the leaflets I was handing out.
Now they talk freely,'' said a party organizer Tuesday.
   But the future appears unclear. The military has promised to
turn over power after the new parliament writes a constitution and
a strong civilian government is in place. There is no indication
when this will be achieved.
   ``It's still a very murky situation. It has never happened
before, and I think the army is still scratching it's head and
wondering how to handle it,'' said one senior Western diplomat.
   ``If you look back in history, the army's attitude is not firm.
They often change their color _ do you see the point?'' said an
official of the National League for Democracy, who requested
anonymity.
   It was the army that killed several thousand, mostly unarmed
civilians, when the country rose up against authoritarian rule in
1988.
   A group of military leaders, led by Gen. Saw Maung, crushed the
uprising in September 1988, imposed martial law and carried out
widespread arrests. It did call for general elections and for a
time allowed relatively free political activity.
   But when opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the charismatic
daughter of independence hero Aung San, criticized the military and
gathered mass support last summer, she was put under house arrest.
The co-leader of the National League for Democracy, Tin Oo, was
also jailed. Former Prime Minster Nu also remains under house
arrest.
   Other political prisoners remain in detention, and arrests
continued until just before the election. Five days before
balloting, Zagana, a popular comedian who took part in the 1988
uprising, was sentenced to five years in prison by a military
tribunal.
   Given this prelude, diplomats, human rights organizations and
others branded the elections fraudulent. Yet from all available
accounts, including observation by foreign correspondents, the
balloting was free and fair.
   The United States praised the Burmese for the election and said
Tuesday that from the early results, ``it is apparent the Burmese
people want to return to a multiparty political system.''
   Some analysts speculate that the military miscalculated the
Burmese people's dissatisfaction with their situation.
   ``They simply did not realize how deeply unpopular the
(pro-military) National Unity Party, and by extension they
themselves were,'' said a Rangoon-based Western diplomat.
   The opposition is taking the election at face value: the
military called an election, pro-democracy forces won and now have
a mandate from the people.
   People who until recently did not dare approach foreigners in
public are speaking freely, although they do not always want their
names printed.
   ``I'm very happy to see fresh new faces in parliament, and I'm
glad to see those old cronies who had devastated the economy leave
the scene,'' said one retired civil servant. ``This election has
turned a page in Burmese history.''
   This is not the first effort at democracy in modern Burmese
history. After independence from Great Britain in 1962, a
parliamentary democracy was established.
   It scored some successes. But factionalism, rebellions by ethnic
groups, and other problems plagued the fledgling experiment. The
army stepped in on several occasions and finally seized power in a
1962 coup led by Gen. Ne Win.
   Ne Win and his one-party state led the country to economic ruin,
isolationism and political stagnation.
   Ne Win retired in 1988, and some say his withdrawal from the
political arena contributed to the election triumph of the League
for Democracy. Others believe he is still pulling strings behind
the scene.

   A marching band and the cheers of thousands
of residents created a rousing homecoming today for Frank Reed, who
spent 3{ years as a hostage in Lebanon.
   The noontime procession officially welcomed Reed back to this
suburb just north of Boston, where residents never lost hope during
his 44 months of captivity.
   Reed and his family led the city's high school band through
downtown to City Hall to the tune of ``Tie A Yellow Ribbon,'' the
song that inspired the idea of festooning trees with yellow ribbons
as reminders of U.S. hostages.
   Reed, 57, was freed by his Shiite Moslem kidnappers April 30. He
underwent medical treatment at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., until
the holiday weekend, which he spent relaxing with family members in
Malden. Later he was to return to Maryland for continued treatment.
   On Monday, Reed recalled in an interview that fellow hostage
Terry Anderson once suggested Reed would get through the experience
because he was ``a realistic optimist.'' Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, has been held captive
since March 1985.
   ``I've never been a person to go through super highs or super
lows,'' Reed said in an interview. ``I've never been a person to
get depressed. That may have sustained me during the whole ordeal.''
   Bob Woolf, Reed's spokesman, repeatedly stopped him from
answering questions about the six Americans and 10 other Westerners
held in Lebanon.
   On Sunday, Reed said some of the hostages were in ill health,
mentioning Anderson, 42, and Thomas Sutherland, 59, but giving no
details.
   Those comments contradicted statements he made at a news
conference May 6, when he said Anderson and Sutherland ``look
physically wonderful.'' He said he last saw Anderson between a year
and 18 months ago and Sutherland 14 months ago.
   Asked about the contradiction, Reed said, ``There is something
to say, and there may be some clarifications to be made,'' before
he was stopped by Woolf.
   Appearing fit and heavier than when he was released, Reed said
his anemia is ``moving in the right direction.'' He was prevented
from answering detailed questions about his condition, but did say
doctors had been surprised by how quickly he had regained his
health. He said he had regained almost 20 pounds.
   ``Everything's supposed to be wrong with me, but the doctors
keep saying, `Gee, it ain't there,''' Reed said. ``They keep making
up these superlatives to describe my health.''
   He attributed his seeming good health to a strong constitution
inherited from his 91-year-old mother, Leota Sprague. He saw her
for the first time in eight years when he arrived at Boston's Logan
International Airport on Sunday.
   He said he hopes to complete his doctorate, continue his career
as an educator and perhaps write a book about his experiences.
   ``The thing about suddenly being released is, thank God I'm
free,'' Reed said. ``Put me anywhere where I can get my life
started.''

   President Bush and his advisers went over
final preparations today for a U.S.-Soviet summit that a top aide
said will tackle ``bare bone essentials'' rather than tallying up
agreements to sign.
   Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will likely issue
a statement of progress on nuclear arms reductio as
sign various cultural and economic agreements when they meet this
week, said a senior admin talks, as wellnistration official who briefed
White House
reporters.
   But the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, cast doubt
on prospects for a U.S.-Soviet trade agreement before Gorbachev
leaves.
   ``We're in a rather uncertain state about what exactly will
happen on the trade agreement,'' the official said, citing U.S.
unhappiness over Soviet actions in Lithuania and the Soviets'
failure to enact legislation allowing free emigration.
   Still, the official said, ``This is not a summit devoted to the
celebration of agreements that we can sign. It is a summit designed
to do the hard work of trying to overcome the remaining obstacles
that stand in the way of transforming East-West relations.''
   ``We are now dow: Education Program.

<TEXT>
   Arab Leaders Tuesday decided against
sending a memorandum on the Middle East conflict to the superpower
summit after moderates failed to temper criticism of Washington in
the draft.
   The memorandum, mostly on the influx of Soviet Jews to israel,
had become a focus of discord on how hard a line the Arab League
summit should take against the United States.
   ``There will be no letter,'' Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz
said as he emerged from a closed-door meeting. He refused to
elaborate.
   The conference was called as a show of Arab unity against what
President Saddam Hussein has said is a Western and Israeli campaign
against Iraq. It also sought ways to stem the emigration of Soviet
Jews to Israel.
   Little unity, however, has been apparent so far in the summit.
Syria and Lebanon boycotted the meeting, and Morocco, Algeria and
Oman sent senior government officials.
   In bellicose speeches Monday, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and
Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat blasted
the United States and Israel.
   But moderates, led by Egypt and Saudi Arabia, appeared to have
persuaded hard-liners to take a ``more balanced and prudent''
approach on the summit's second day, sources said.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Arab
nations were unable to agree on the wording of a memorandum to be
sent to the superpower summit, which begins Thursday in Washington.
   Iraq and the PLO drafted an 18-page document, which focused
mainly on the emigration issue and called for economic sanctions
against countries that facilitate the influx. It urged Western
nations, especially the United States, to absorb Soviet emigrants.
   But Egypt and Saudi Arabia rejected references to sanctions and
the criticism of U.S. policy.
   ``With the moderate and hard-line blocs arguing over every word
in the 18-page draft memorandum, they decided to scratch it
altogether,'' a conference source said.
   About 750,000 Soviet Jews are expected to emigrate to Israel in
the next few years, and Arab states contend many will settle in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, land the Palestinians
consider their own.
   Many Arabs are angry at the United States, saying it has added
to the influx by tightening immigration restrictions and driving
Soviet Jews to Israel.
   The Arabs also believe Washington has not done enough to
pressure Israel into agreeing to direct peace talks with the PLO.
   At a closed-door session Tuesday, Arafat alleged that Israel was
conducting military exercises in the Negev Desert in preparation
for an attack against Iraq's military installations.
   Iraq has often said accusations it was producing chemical
weapons and building a so-called super gun were a prelude to a
strike similar to the 1981 Israeli air raid on a nuclear reactor
near Baghdad.
   On Monday, Saddam told the conference he would use ``weapons of
mass destruction'' against Israel if the Jewish state deployed its
nuclear arsenal against any Arab nation.
   He accused the United States of fostering ``the policy of
aggression and expansion practiced by the Zionist entity against
the Arabs.''
   Iraq is said to have binary chemical weapons. Britain, Italy,
Greece and Turkey recently have confiscated Iraq-bound shipments
allegedly containing components of a ``super gun.''Arab states
claim Israel has 200 nuclear bombs.
   The Arab summit was originally scheduled to end late Tuesday,
but conference sources said the closing session would not be held
until Wednesday.

   A federal judge sentenced a reputed
high-ranking member of the Medellin drug cartel to 30 years in
prison and fined him $5 million today.
   Jose Abello Silva was convicted May 19 on one count of
conspiracy to import cocaine and marijuana into the United States
and one count of conspiracy to possess drugs with the intent to
distribute.
   Abello was extradited to the United States from Colombia last
fall.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Brett said the extradition treaty
provided a maximum sentence of 30 years. Brett sentenced Abello to
30 years on each count but ordered the terms to run concurrently.
   Abello, who stood with his arms crossed during the hourlong
sentencing, maintained his innocence.
   Abello was indicted and tried in Tulsa because of telephone
calls and money exchanges between groups in Oklahoma and Florida
that allegedly helped raise money for a man jailed in Tulsa.

   One congressman's life was saved by a
newspaper. A senator's marriage gave some Midwesterners their first
look at a Democrat. And a new president rated a unique greeting at
the Capitol.
   While reports of Washington street violence seem to abound
lately, it's apparently not a new phenomenon.
   In 1861, muggers attacked Rep. Charles Van Wyck, R-N.Y., on a
street near the Capitol. One assailant tried to stab the
congressman but the knife was deflected by the folded pages of a
newspaper in Van Wyck's pocket.
   Van Wyck decked one mugger, then pulled out a pistol to ward off
others.
   Most members of Congress aren't armed these days, and few would
expect their lives to be saved by newspapers.
   But many may find similar experiences in a new book,
``Congressional Chronicles.'' The collection of anecdotes compiled
by Anthony S. Pitch was published by Mino Publications of Potomac,
Md.
   In it, Pitch recalls Sen. J. Allen Frear, D-Del., who had what
may have been a tense experience.
   Shortly after his marriage, Frear went to Wisconsin to visit
friends and relatives of his wife, Esther, who was from a town
where nearly everyone was a Republican.
   In the middle of the party, Frear was asked to stand in the
middle of the room and his father-in-law told those present: ``I
want you to see and know what a Democrat is. You probably have
never seen one before, but here is one.''
   When Ronald Reagan headed for the Capitol after his first
inauguration, the new sergeant-at-arms Howard Liebengood asked
Majority Leader Howard Baker, R-Tenn., ``How do you greet these
people.''
   ``Watch Nordy, he knows,'' said Baker, referring to Nordy
Hoffman, the retiring sergeant-at-arms.
   But Hoffman, a 300-pound former tackle on Knut Rockne's 1929 and
1930 Notre Dame football teams, recalled that actor Reagan once
portrayed George Gipp, another member of that team.
   When Reagan's limousine pulled up and the door opened, Hoffman
extended a hand and said: ``Hiya, Gipper.''
   Many members of Congress admit that their staff wields plenty of
influence, getting things done that the members don't have time to
supervise.
   Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., saw the difference when he was
elected to the House in 1977 after eight years as an aide to Sen.
Warren Magnuson.
   ``I never thought I'd give up that much power voluntarily,''
Dicks said when asked about his new job.
   Rebecca Latimer Felton, D-Ga., holds three Senate records set in
a very brief 1922 career.
   Appointed before the winner of a special election was seated,
she served the shortest Senate term _ one day. The 87-year-old also
was the first woman senator and the oldest person to become a
member of that body.
   Rep. John Taber, R-N.Y., was famous for his impassioned oratory,
particularly when it was about saving money, but his voice may also
have had some medical applications.
   Taber reportedly bellowed so loudly one day in the spring of
1940 that Rep. Leonard Schuetz, D-Ill., tottered dazed into the
cloakroom. A few minutes later Schuetz recovered his equilibrium
and realized that he could hear perfectly, having suddenly
recovered from lifelong deafness in his left ear.
   George Washington Bridges was elected to Congress as a unionist
from Tennessee in 1860, but was captured by Confederate troops
before he could get to Washington. Bridges eventually escaped and
was sworn in just a week before his term expired.
   A visit to a naval vessel by women is nothing special these
days, but it wasn't the case at the close of World War II.
   Reps. Chase Woodhouse, D-Conn., Reva Bosone, D-Utah, and a
female aide, surprised the Pentagon by accepting an invitation for
an overnight stay aboard the Aircraft Carrier Midway.
   Woodhouse asked Adm. William Halsey if the guard posted outside
their quarters had been there to protect the women or the crew.
   ``You've got to know,'' said Halsey, ``that you three are the
first ladies who ever spent a night on the ship _ legally.''
   Rep. John Allen, D-Miss., joined the House in 1895 and said he
was mighty impressed with the other members.
   ``In a House in which everybody is either a judge or a general
or a colonel it is quite a distinction to be a private,'' remarked
Allen.
   From then on he was known as Private John.

<HEAD>U.S. Sends Iran Report on Iranians Missing in Beirut</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has given Iran information
supporting his earlier assertion that four Iranians missing in
Lebanon since 1982 are dead, the White House said on Tuesday.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Swiss
government had passed the report on to Tehran. Bush, at a news
conference on May 3, promised to provide the information as a
``gesture of goodwill.''
   ``We have made a major effort of collecting information,''
Fitzwater said. ``Essentially, the conclusions are the same: the
four individuals they are concerned with are dead.''
   The four Iranians _ two diplomats, a journalist and a driver _
disappeared from Beirut during the 1982 Israeli invasion of
Lebanon. Iran in the past has suggested Lebanese Christian
militiamen had a role in the abductions.
   Fitzwater told reporters he had no new information on the
circumstances of the killings or on the identity of the
perpetrators. The contents of the report were not disclosed.
   He said that the United States conferred with the International
Red Cross, other countries and ``a lot of private sources that we
developed'' in compiling its report to Iran.
   At his May 3 news conference, Bush said he hoped providing Iran
with information on the fate of the four missing Iranians would
satisfy Tehran's request for a gesture of thanks for its role in
the freeing of two U.S. hostages. At the same time, Bush said he
remained firmly against negotiating for the release of the six
American hostages still being held in Lebanon.
   ``We don't put any conditions'' on giving Iran the ``new
evidence'' on the fate of the four missing Iranians, Fitzwater said.
   He said the material was turned over to Iran ``within the last
several days.''

<HEAD>Opponents of New Premier Riot, Fight With Police</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The legislature confirmed a top general as
premier during a raucous session Tuesday, and hundreds of opponents
fought in the streets with police, burned buses and tossed
firebombs at government buildings.
   At least 40 people, including 10 officers, were reported
injured. Police detained 10 people in the rioting, which paralyzed
downtown traffic for more than 12 hours.
   Two policemen were hospitalized with serious burns from
firebombs, police said.
   At the height of the clashes, about 600 demonstrators, many
wearing headbands with the slogan ``oppose military intervention in
politics,'' fought roving battles with about 5,000 riot police near
the legislative Yuan building. Police used water cannons to try to
subdue the protesters, witnesses said.
   What touched off the unrest was the approval of Defense Minister
Hau Pei-tsun as the next premier. Legislators approved him by a
vote of 186 to 27.
   The vote was delayed seven hours as 21 members of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party stormed the podium, kicked their seats
in disgust and grabbed microphones from lawmakers of the ruling
Nationalist Party.
   The opposition lawmakers, all wearing vests with Chinese
characters reading ``Oppose a soldier leading the Cabinet,''
occupied voting booths for an hour to prevent Nationalist lawmakers
from casting ballots. Several voting booths set up as replacements
were torn down.
   At one point, legislature Speaker Liang Su-jung called in 100
police officers to restore order.
   Hau, 70, the nation's only four-star general, was selected by
President Lee Teng-hui earlier this month to head the Cabinet.
   Opposition politicians and intellectuals called the decision a
step backward for democracy on this island.
   The Nationalists have dominated politics since they fled the
Chinese mainland in 1949 after losing a civil war to Communist
forces. In recent years, however, the Nationalists have eased their
authoritarian grip, lifting martial law and allowing the formation
of opposition political parties.
   Hau has promised to distance himself from the military once he
becomes premier, but his critics dismiss the claim. Hau gave up his
four-star ranking Saturday.
   Opposition lawmaker Chen Shui-pien called Tuesday's vote
ridiculous and said it ``ran counter to public opinion.''
   After the vote, about 200 students staged a sit-in outside the
legislative building, witnesses said.
   The clashes began when about 600 demonstrators tried to break
through barricades and a wall of police guarding the building.
Police with shields surged into the crowd and beat several
demonstrators with clubs before opening up with water cannons,
witnesses reported.
   The crowd dispersed but quickly regrouped and attacked the
officers with rocks, they said.
   Dozens of protesters then attacked the nearby Cabinet building,
where a room was destroyed by firebombs, they said.
   Some protesters ransacked the lobby of the nearby Lai Lai
Sheraton Hotel, smashing chandeliers, windows and security monitors
and overturning furniture. The hotel closed briefly because of the
violence.
   About 500 protesters later surrounded a police station and
demanded the release of the detainees. Witnesses said the
protesters smashed windows and that the demonstrators and police
threw rocks at each other.
   About 1,000 riot police marched in to disperse those protesters,
but many returned later and burned a bus, the witnesses said.

   A man angered because he couldn't take his drink
out of a bar drove by the lounge and opened fire with an automatic
rifle early Tuesday, killing a woman and wounding five people,
police said.
   The wounded were taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital where they
were listed as stable, said police.
   The trouble started when two men trying to leave the Magic City
Lounge three blocks west of the Overtown section were told it was
against the law to carry their drinks outside, police said. An
argument ensued and the men left.
   The two drove by in a car and one opened fire with a fully
automatic AK-47 assault rifle, police said. One of the bullets went
through a 3-inch-thick metal door and fatally wounded Tracy L.
Black, a 25-year-old customer inside the bar, police said.
   ``We're trying to interview some of the victims at the hospital
to see if they know anything about these guys,'' police spokesman
David Rivero said. ``We lifted fingerprints from some of the
glasses. We have very little information. We're going to check all
the AK-47s purchased recently.''

   Populist reformer Boris N. Yeltsin won the
presidency of the largest Soviet republic Tuesday, overcoming
opposition by Mikhail S. Gorbachev and declaring the start of
``Russia's social, economic and spiritual rebirth.''
   Yeltsin's election, after three hard-fought ballots in the
Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian Federation, poses a
substantial challenge to Gorbachev and may spur more radical
reforms across the country.
   Gorbachev, who arrives Wednesday in Washington for a summit,
retains the two most powerful jobs in the country: president of the
Soviet Union and General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party.
   But as president of the largest of 15 Soviet republics, Yeltsin
will have a highly visible platform from which to wage his campaign
for more radical reforms. Yeltsin and other Soviet officials said
they believe his election will help Gorbachev push more radical
reforms.
   ``It may be a blessing in disguise,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady Gerasimov told reporters at the United Nations in New York.
``Gorbachev has his critics from both the left and the right, and
possibly it is better to have the election of a critic from the
left.''
   Yeltsin said: ``At first, President Gorbachev will react very
unhappily, but then he'll gradually get used to this
inevitability.''
   The strapping, white-haired Yeltsin told reporters that he would
seek reconciliation with Gorbachev and avoid confrontation with
him, so long as it did not hurt Russia's interests.
   Gorbachev had brought Yeltsin to Moscow to head the city's
Communist Party, but the two men had a falling out in 1987 after
Yeltsin publicly criticized the pace of Kremlin reforms. They have
been at odds since then.
   After the vote result was announced in the Grand Kremlin Palace,
Yeltsin strode to the podium to warm applause and pledged to
``spare nothing _ health or time _ to get out of this crisis and
lead Russia to better times.''
   His bass voice echoing through the hall, he called the day ``the
beginning of the road to Russia's social, economic and spiritual
rebirth, the way out of the crisis and toward the blossoming of
Russia as a sovereign, independent government in the framework of
our union.''
   He left through the Kremlin gates later to the tumultuous cheers
of a small crowd of well-wishers chanting ``Victory! Victory!'' One
man yelled, ``Thank you, thank you for the future!''
   Gorbachev strongly opposed Yeltsin's election. He told the
Russian Congress last week that Yeltsin's platform of moving
political and economic power from central to local authorities
would lead to a ``breakup of the union.''
   The Russian Federation stretches from the Baltic Sea in the west
to the Pacific Ocean in the East. It is home to half the country's
285 million people and includes Moscow, the Soviet capital.
   As president of the Russian Congress, a newly created body that
holds the Russian Federation's highest government authority,
Yeltsin acts as chief executive of the republic and took office
immediately. As the first president of a newly reorganized
legislature, he will play a major role in shaping his powers and
duties, which as yet are unclear.
   After three votes in the 1,060-member Russian Congress, Yeltsin
won 535 votes, four more than the majority needed.
   Russian Premier Alexander Vlasov received 467 votes. Valentin
Tsoy, a little-known businessman from the Soviet Far East, received
11 votes.
   Lawmakers said Tuesday they believed Yeltsin gained the last few
votes he needed by offering to form a coalition government with
members of the conservative Communist Party bloc and other groups.
   Yeltsin said he believed he gained several votes because of a
last-minute push by Gorbachev to block his election. Gorbachev
reportedly urged delegates at a meeting Monday night not to vote
for Yeltsin.
   Russian Deputy Alexander Liubimov, a well-known TV commentator,
said Yeltsin's election would force Gorbachev to start dealing with
another strong leader instead of ``shadows'' willing to defer to
him. ``It will be a lesson for him. Maybe a hard one,'' Liubimov
said.
   Vitaly Churkin, a spokesman for Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, said on NBC that Yeltsin's election ``might actually
help Gorbachev because Gorbachev is for radical reform, and he
needs more popular support for that.''
   Some also said Yeltsin may have benefited from the adverse
reaction to the Kremlin's proposed program for making the crippled
Soviet economy a partial market economy.
   The reform program, which would triple the price of bread on
July 1 and double the cost of other foodstuffs starting Jan. 1,
caused panic buying that prompted Moscow city authorities to bar
sales to non-residents of the capital Monday.
   The national legislature postponed a decision on the reform plan
Tuesday, raising the possibility of compromise with Yeltsin and
others demanding more radical measures. It also rejected a motion
for a no-confidence vote in Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who
presented the reforms last week.
   Yeltsin has proposed a more rapid transition to a market-based
economy that would grant more freedom to enterprises and
entrepreneurs.

   Summertime is tough for Jean Brissette,
who longs to give her kids the backyard barbecues and baseball
outings she knew while growing up in an affluent suburb.
   Today, the divorced mother of four is scraping by on $100 a
week. Making sure her children have new sneakers means months of
scrimping.
   ``I figured I'd have everything my mother had, the nice home and
all that,'' Brissette, 42, said recently. ``But I'm robbing Peter
to pay Paul and still barely getting by. How can I hope to get
ahead?''
   She is part of a suburban secret, 9.5 million poor people
scattered among the nation's manicured lawns and backyard
basketball hoops.
   They won't be evident to first ladies Barbara Bush and Raisa
Gorbachev, who are coming to this town about 10 miles outside
Boston to deliver a commencement address this week at Wellesley
College.
   ``They are the invisible poor,'' said Sheldon Danziger, a
University of Michigan poverty researcher. ``They are seldom
discussed.''
   These people live on the edge of bankruptcy, foreclosure and
life on the streets. Many have already been pushed off the
precipice by New England's broken-down economy and inflationary
cost of living.
   Like Brissette, fellow Wellesley resident Frank G., who spoke on
condition that his family's name not be used, measures his life in
checks: paychecks, unemployment checks, checks from relatives
lending a hand.
   Jobs are scarce, so the 31-year-old construction worker and his
wife are raising three children on about $600 a month in a town
where the median home price is about $340,000.
   ``I'm two paychecks away from getting thrown out on the
streets,'' he said. ``I was treated better in the inner city. At
least there you were on the same wavelength.''
   His family and Brissette and her children live in Barton Road, a
faded housing project for financially strapped families.
   Frank's wife has to walk two hours round trip, with children in
tow, to a supermarket because they have no car and there is no
public transportation.
   Residents of wealthy communities are beginning to face pockets
of despair camouflaged by country clubs and in Wellesley's case, a
prestigious women's college.
   Since 1986, suburban welfare cases have jumped 12 percent
compared with a 5 percent increase in the number of urban poor.
Officials estimate the state has 44,000 suburban welfare cases,
just 4,000 fewer than in the cities.
   More than 28 percent of the 520,000 people living below the
poverty line in Massachusetts now reside in suburbia, where about
80 food pantries have sprung up to feed them.
   ``The poverty has been masked for a long time,'' said Westy
Egmont, executive director of the Boston Food Bank. ``But social
service providers are documenting the reality.''
   Frank found himself homeless after leaving the Navy in 1980.
``We've been dirt poor but we're a family ... and that's what it's
all about,'' he said.
   Frank's family moved to Wellesley from Boston five years ago
when their number was called for the low-cost housing project. But
the cost hasn't turned out to be that low.
   Each time Frank gets a decent job, the rent is adjusted upward.
It has climbed as high as $700.
   Jobs have been hard to come by and welfare is not for Frank, who
is built like a football player and more than ready to work. He
never gives up, but being broke gets him down.
   ``It's tough when friends say `Let's go to see the Bruins play'
and your priority is in diapers,'' said Frank.
   Living on the edge takes its toll on everyone. But it's perhaps
hardest for the children, whose schoolmates are dressed in the best
and riding brand new 10-speed bikes.
   ``Sometimes they say mean things like `Your mother's on
welfare,''' said Frank's 10-year-old daughter, Janelle.
   Brissette, with two young sons still at home, had a stormy
marriage that ended in a divorce seven years ago.
   When the money runs out, she joins the line of people seeking
help from the local food bank. Things aren't at all the way she
planned.
   ``It's a story of incredible pain because of the contrast
between being poor and living in Wellesley,' said Egmont. ``We
can't escape the fact that we are all marginal.''

<HEAD>Soviet Leader Will Be Closely Guarded on U.S. Visit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A ``big bunch of people with big guns'' will
protect Mikhail S. Gorbachev during his summit visit, a Soviet
spokesman said Tuesday, saying ethnic protesters could keep the
Kremlin leader's guards busy.
   Dozens of protests, by groups ranging from Lithuanian-American
war veterans to Afghans and Turkestanian-Americans, might become
``a headache for Gorbachev's security,'' Soviet press spokesman
Vladimir Ustimenko said.
   Neither the U.S. Secret Service nor the KGB, which will work
together on summit security, furnished details of protection
arrangements on the eve of Gorbachev's arrival for his second
Washington summit.
   But the Soviet leader's free-wheeling style in public already
has been in evidence here, and his security detail wants to be
ready. If officials knew of any Gorbachev surprises a day before
his arrival, however, they weren't saying so.
   The last time he was here _ to hold a summit with then-President
Ronald Reagan in December 1987 _ Gorbachev halted his motorcade to
take an impromptu walk to meet the local citizenry. Then-Vice
President George Bush, riding in the same motorcade, jumped from
his limousine to join Gorbachev on the busy Washington street
corner.
   The Soviet leader also has been known to wade into crowds of
protesters to carry on political discourse _ and there will be
plenty of opportunities for that if he chooses to do so.
   They include protests by those representing people in various
Soviet states, as well as people favoring a unified Korea with a
South Korean leadership. There also will be Palestinians seeking a
homeland, Vietnamese seeking democracy in Vietnam, and those
pushing for a cure for AIDS, said Maj. Carl Holmberg of the U.S.
Park Police.
   Other demonstrations are scheduled to follow Gorbachev as he
travels to Minneapolis and Northern California on Sunday and
Monday. Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians plan a peaceful show of
their flags in Minneapolis. And in Northern California, Armenians
and Eritreans plan protests. The latter are fighting for
independence from Soviet-backed Ethiopia.
   The demonstrations have been announced, but details of
Gorbachev's stay in Washington still were not in the hands of the
Soviet press center or the Secret Service on Tuesday.
   All of the roughly 500 U.S. Park Police officers in the
Washington area were to work through the summit Sunday to ensure
control over the myriad protests planned for Lafayette Park and the
Ellipse by the White House as well as at the Capitol reflecting
pool, Holmberg said.
   ``No days off _ and extended shifts,'' he added.
   Holmberg expressed confidence that while Gorbachev might see
some protesters, they won't get out of control.
   ``We've got some groups to keep an eye on, but I don't think
they're a grave concern,'' he said.
   The number of agents was a state secret on both sides. ``It will
be a big bunch of people with big guns,'' Ustimenko declared.
   Richard Adams of the Secret Service, like Ustimenko, had no
specifics to give out.
   ``We have a good idea of what he's going to do,'' but not all of
the details, Adams said. ``As far as an impromptu stop, that's not
out of the question.''
   Any sudden decision by Gorbachev to get out of his limosine to
shake hands with the public ``probably works to our advantage,''
Adams said.
   ``If we don't know and his staff doesn't know where he's going
to stop, that means someone meaning him harm won't know either,''
Adams said. ``Impromptu stops are not necessarily a negative thing
to us.''
   Washington, D.C. has been the nation's murder capital for the
past two years, but the Soviet Embassy where Gorbachev will stay is
in a relatively safe part of town near the White House.
   There have been no slayings in recent memory in that area, said
Metropolitan Police Department spokeswoman Shannon Cockett.
   To ensure that no untoward events occur there this week, the
entire block will be closed to all traffic through Sunday, she said.
   U.S. security agents and the KGB apparently are working well
together.
   ``Soviet-American friendship starts with the friendship between
the Soviet KGB and the American Secret Service,'' Ustimenko said.
   ``It's hard sometimes for the folks on the outside to understand
this,'' said Adams, ``but from a security point of view, we have
the same goal here: the protection of Gorbachev.''
   ``We have to work closely with them, so they understand what
we're doing and we understand what they're doing,'' Adams said.
``If our president decides to travel to Moscow, we would be asking
for the same cooperation from them, and they would provide it.''

<HEAD>Agency Budget Cuts Expected to Restrict Help to Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARE NULLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a decision that will severely restrict
assistance to 15 million refugees worldwide, the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees agreed Tuesday to a sharp cut in its
1990 budget.
   The agency's executive committee agreed that expenditure on
general programs should be limited to $341 million in 1990 in order
to tackle a financial crisis overwhelming the organization.
   In a speech on the opening day of the emergency meeting Monday,
Deputy High Commissioner Douglas Stafford said a deficit of $82
million was forecast for 1990. He said overall spending needs were
estimated at $672 million.
   Last year's general budget was $389 million, and in October, the
executive committee proposed a $414 million budget for 1990.
   High Commissioner Thorvald Stoltenberg said in an 11-page report
to the meeting that the revised budget was a ``reasonable balance''
between the needs of refugees and income expected from donor
governments.
   He said said education and support programs were being slashed
as a result of the financial crisis and that 10 percent to 15
percent of the 2,400 agency employees would be cut.
   Supplies of food, clothing, blankets and fuel are being cut to
inadequate levels in many refugee camps, while lack of resources
for transport and road repairs is imposing further limits on
supplies, according to the report.
   The report said refugee protection was also suffering. It cited
insufficient staff to monitor Vietnamese boat people in Southeast
Asian countries, to separate genuine refugees fleeing political
persecution from those escaping economic hardship.
   Stoltenberg said cuts in programs to repatriate refugees or
integrate them into local economies meant people would have to
remain in camps, at great expense.
   ``In 1980, UNHCR had twice as many resources for each refugee
than it has in 1990,'' Stoltenberg said.
   The meeting in Geneva was held to fix spending for the rest of
1990 and to make an initial assessment of needs in 1991. All agency
money is based on voluntary contributions from governments.

   A strong earthquake rattled Kodiak Island
on Tuesday, but there were no immediate reports of damage or
injuries.
   The 10:31 a.m. temblor was centered about 50 miles southwest of
Kodiak, and had a preliminary magnitude reading of 5.8 on the
Richter scale, said Bill Zitek, a spokesman at the Alaska Tsunami
Warning Center.
   ``It was felt strongly in Kodiak and at Old Harbor,'' Zitek
said. ``I guess a few things fell off shelves.''
   Kathy Duda, a communications officer with the Kodiak Police
Department, said a few residents of the island, 260 miles southwest
of Anchorage, called to report feeling the quake.
   ``There was no damage, no injuries, no tsunami,'' she said.
Tsunamis are tidal waves that can be generated by quakes.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   A magnitude-5 quake can cause considerable damage and a
magnitude-6 quake can cause severe damage.

   Dozens of people remained hospitalized
Tuesday after a cloud of toxic fumes passed through a small farming

   A farmer who burned garbage containing an insecticide caused the
poisonous cloud Monday in Quebrada Seca, about 280 miles southwest

   He said 33 children were being treated at a local clinic. About
30 adults were being treated at Central Hospital in the state
capital of Barinas, Tovar said.
   Some 120 people were affected by the fumes Monday morning.
Authorities identified the burned insecticide as Dixos.
   Residents of the town of 10,000 suffered fainting spells,
dizziness, vomiting and severe stomach pains, Tovar said.
   ``People would be walking along the streets and all of a sudden
they'd collapse,' he said.
   The farmer who lit the bonfire was among the first to be
affected, Tovar said.

   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton sought the Democratic nomination for
a fifth term Tuesday, and Republicans decided a rancorous
gubernatorial primary that pitted a former utility chief against a
sheriff-turned-congressman.
   In Kentucky, former Louisville mayor Harvey Sloane battled state
schools Superintendent John Brock for the Democratic nomination to
meet Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell. McConnell faced only token
opposition in the GOP primary, from perennial candidate Tommy Klein.
   Long-time Democratic congressmen in both states faced spirited
challenges.
   In the 1st District of northeast Arkansas, Rep. Bill Alexander,
a 22-year veteran of Congress, faced Osceola attorney Mike Gibson,
a political newcomer with strong business backing.
   In the Louisville area, 10-term incumbent Rep. Romano Mazzoli
campaigned without money from political action committees against
former television newsman Jeffrey Hutter and Alderman Paul Bather.
   Clinton's main challenger, Tom McRae, former president of the
Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation, lagged in public polls, and the
governor hoped to gain a majority vote and avoid a June 12 runoff.
The other Democratic candidates were Joe Holmes of Pine Bluff,
Jerry Tolliver of North Little Rock, Cyrus Young of Fayetteville
and O.O. ``Woodrow'' Wilson of North Little Rock.
   The GOP primary featured a bitter rivalry between Rep. Tommy
Robinson, former police chief and sheriff from Pulaski County, and
Sheffield Nelson, former head of Arkla Inc., the major natural gas
utility in Arkansas. Both were Democrats until last year.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Sen. David Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat, had no primary
opposition and will face only a write-in foe in November.
   Arkansas' Republican campaign for governor focused on a business
deal between Arkla Inc. and Arkoma Production Co., owned by
Nelson's friend Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys owner who grew up
with Robinson in North Little Rock.
   In 1982, Arkla sold a half-interest in gas drilling leases to
Arkoma for $15 million. After Arkoma spent $35 million more on
drilling and other costs, Arkla bought back its leases in 1986
along with the rest of Arkoma for $174.8 million.
   Robinson, 48, called the deal sleazy and severed his financial
ties and friendship with Jones. Jones' 22-year-old daughter,
Charlotte, quit her $60,000 a year job as administrator of
Robinson's congressional office after Robinson began criticizing
her father.
   Nelson's feud with his mentor at Arkla, W.R. ``Witt'' Stephens,
spilled over into the campaign. Stephens' sister-in-law, Mary Anne
Stephens, managed Robinson's campaign. Her husband, Jack Stephens,
and Stephens Inc., the investment firm run by the brothers, were
major contributors to Robinson's campaign.
   Clinton, 43, was the nation's youngest governor when he was
first elected in 1978. He lost his bid for re-election in 1980, but
was elected again in 1982, 1984 and 1986, when the two-year term
for governor was doubled.
   Clinton, frequently mentioned as a potential presidential
candidate, became the object of jokes in 1988 because of his
meandering speech introducing another candidate for that office _
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. Clinton was supposed to talk
for 15 minutes but spoke for more than twice that long.
   In Kentucky, Gov. Wallace Wilkinson backed Brock, but
disagreements between the two surfaced last week when Brock decided
not to follow Wilkinson's advice to borrow $250,000 for a
last-minute television blitz. Wilkinson said that all but dashed
Brock's chances and disassociated himself from the campaign.
   Alexander, 52, claimed that rich landowners in his native
Mississippi County and big oil companies bankrolled Gibson'
campaign. In a whirlwind push the last two months of the campaign,
the incumbent portrayed himself as a ``child of the Delta'' and
boasted of bringing $100 million in federal aide to the 24-county
district.
   Gibson, 43, derided what he said was the incumbent's
ineffectiveness in Congress. He noted that Alexander had never
chaired or co-chaired a major congressional committee.
   The main issue in Mazzoli's district was whether the incumbent,
first elected to the seat in 1970, had done enough for Louisville
in his two decades in office. Mazzoli was co-author with Sen. Alan
Simpson, R-Wyo., of the 1986 immigration reform law.

   The United States said Tuesday it hoped any
joint statement emerging from the Arab League summit would
contribute to peace in the Middle East.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler also said that
anti-Israel statements by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein were
outrageous.
   Saddam, repeating an April warning, told the summit in Baghdad
that Iraq would use ``weapons of mass destruction'' against Israel
if the Israelis used similar weapons against Iraq or any other Arab
country.
   ``Our view of these statements remains as it was several weeks
ago. They're irresponsible; they're inflammatory; they're
outrageous,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   ``No one should be trumpeting such weapons _ meaning chemical
weapons. We should be trumpeting their destruction,'' she said.
   Repeating messages sent privately and publicly to Arab leaders,
Ms. Tutwiler said the United States hoped ``any resolutions coming
out of the summit will contribute to peace, not raise tensions
further.''
   Any summit document should support U.S.-sponsored efforts to
bring Israelis and Palestinians to the negotiating table so
violence such as that that killed a 72-year-old Jewish man in a
Jerusalem explosion Sunday can be stopped, she said.
   The conference was called as a show of Arab unity against what
Hussein has said is a Western and Israeli campaign against Iraq. It
also sought ways to stem the emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel.
   But little unity has been apparent so far in the summit, with
several Arab states boycotting the gathering and a decision Tuesday
by the participants to send a memorandum critical of the United
States to the superpower summit in Washington this week.

<HEAD>Iran, Iraq to Hold Talks to Formally End Gulf War, Officials Say</HEAD>

   The presidents of Iran and Iraq may hold
their first direct meeting in the next few weeks for peace talks to
formally end the Iran-Iraq war, a senior PLO official said Tuesday.
   If the talks take place, they would be the first direct
negotiations between the countries since 1988, when a
U.N.-sponsored cease-fire halted eight years of fighting.
   Peace negotiations began five days after the truce took effect
in August 1988, but they quickly deadlocked.
   Arab officials in Baghdad said they believe the threat from
Israel perceived by Arab leaders is acting as a catalyst to push
the foes toward a peace treaty.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said PLO chairman Yasser Arafat will fly to
Tehran this week in an effort to set up talks between Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Cyprus, quoted Iranian Parliament
Speaker Mehdi Karrubi also as saying that the two leaders may meet,
but Karrubi gave no time estimate. He made the comment after Saddam
proposed direct talks in a letter to Tehran.
   Arafat, in Baghdad for an Arab summit that began Monday, ``will
go to Tehran immediately'' after the conference, which is expected
to end by Wednesday, the PLO official reported.
   ``Barring last-minute complications, direct summit talks between
Saddam and Rafsanjani will be under way after a month,'' the
official added.
   According to Soviet sources in the Iraqi capital, Saddam sent a
letter to Tehran in April suggesting direct talks. Soviet envoy
Vladimir Petrovsky carried that letter to Tehran, they said.
   The PLO official said Arafat had sent two messages to Iranian
leaders Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Rafsanjani in recent days,
urging them to respond ``quickly and positively'' to Saddam's offer.
   Speaking at a news conference in Tehran, Karrubi stressed that
any talks between Rafsanjani and Saddam must be within the
framework of United Nations Security Council Resolution 598, which
resulted in the cease-fire.
   The resolution calls for the withdrawal of both sides to
internationally recognized borders, an exchange of prisoners, and
dredging the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway of war debris.
   The waterway forms the southern boundary between the two
countries and is Iraq's main outlet to the Persian Gulf.
   Iraq's claim over the strategic waterway was the main stumbling
block in earlier peace talks. But according to press reports in
Tehran and Kuwait, Saddam has now conceded that sovereignty over
the Shatt-al-Arab is negotiable.
   Both leaders are under pressure to formally end their war.
   Iran needs stability to carry out reconstruction and revitalize
its economy. Since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini died last June,
Tehran has quietly dropped its demands for huge war reparations and
for an Iraqi admission it started the war.
   Iraq, meanwhile, needs to reopen its major port at Basra on the
Shatt-Al-Arab, which has been closed since the war began. It also
is under domestic pressure to get back its 50,000 prisoners of war.

<HEAD>Sources say New Orleans, New York are Finalists for Convention</HEAD>

   New Orleans and New York are the finalists in
the competition to host the 1992 Democratic National Convention,
party sources said Tuesday.
   The 46-member site selection committee will recommend the two
cities Wednesday to party Chairman Ronald H. Brown, who will make
the final decision, the sources said.
   The convention is scheduled to open July 13, 1992, and run for
four days.
   Brown plans to visit both cities, possibly as early as next
week, and announce his decision in mid-June.
   The 1988 Democratic convention was held in Atlanta.
   New York was the site of the 1976 convention when the Democrats
nominated Jimmy Carter for president, the last time the party won a
national election.
   New Orleans hosted the 1988 Republican convention that nominated
George Bush.
   In addition to the two finalists, the site selection committee
also considered bids from Cleveland and Houston.
   While Cleveland impressed committee members with its
enthusiastic presentation, the city was unable to overcome its
shortage of hotel space. The city planned to house some convention
participants on boats docked on Lake Erie.
   The Democrats insisted on access to the hall for six weeks prior
to the opening of the convention and also asked for a commitment of
$15 million in support services to include police protection and
rental of the facility.
   Those two requirements proved too much for several cities that
were invited to bid but later declined to enter the competition.
   The convention is expected to attract 35,000 people to the host
city and millions of dollars in economic benefits. Atlanta was
estimated to have gained about $70 million from the 1988 convention
that nominated Michael Dukakis for president.
   New York made the strongest financial bid of any city, offering
the Democrats $22 million in up-front money and services. But
Madison Square Garden was regarded as only marginally adequate for
the convention. City officials offered a plan to provide additional
seating, but several selection committee members were skeptical.
   In addition, the media workspace in New York would be in the
Javits Center, half a mile from the convention site.
   New Orleans had trouble meeting the financial requirement and is
located in a state that is considered a stronghold of the
anti-abortion movement, placing it at odds with the prevailing
sentiment of the Democratic Party. But its Superdome offered more
than enough space for the delegates plus the thousands of news
media needing room to work.
   Both cities were able to guarantee plenty of hotel rooms and are
home to some of the nation's best known restaurants.
   The Republicans also have begun their site selection process and
plan to announce the GOP convention site in January.

   The Supreme Court said Tuesday it will decide
whether a ban on government-financed family planning clinics
counseling patients about abortion violates free-speech and
abortion rights.
   At stake is the future scope of a federal program with a $200
million annual budget. The program funds more than 4,000 clinics
serving about 5 million low-income women nationwide.
   A federal appeals court in New York upheld the counseling ban,
but other federal courts ruled it is unconstitutional. The high
court's decision, expected sometime in 1991, should resolve the
conflicting rulings.
   In other action Tuesday, the court:
   _Said it will decide whether states may impose mandatory life
sentences without parole for people convicted of possessing large
amounts of drugs.
   The court must determine whether such a Michigan law, the only
one of its kind in the nation, amounts to unconstitutionally
``cruel and unusual punishment.''
   _Gave criminal defendants new ``double jeopardy'' protection
against multiple prosecutions as it voted 5-4 to bar homicide
charges against a drunken driver in New York.
   _Ruled, 7-2, in a Pennsylvania case that convicted criminals may
avoid making restitution to their victims by declaring bankruptcy.
   _Ruled, 7-2, in a case from Arizona that Indian tribes may not
prosecute any member of another tribe for crimes committed on their
reservations.
   _Let stand a ruling in an Illinois case that shields public
officials from being sued in federal court for placing children in
foster homes where they are sexually abused.
   _Rejected an appeal by two Ku Klux Klan groups and four men
ordered to pay more than $800,000 for organizing a demonstration
that turned into a violent attack on civil rights marchers in
Georgia three years ago.
   The newest abortion controversy tackled by the court involves a
family planning program enacted by Congress as Title X of the
Public Health Service Act. It pays for creating and operating
family planning clinics.
   The law forbids clinics to use the federal money to perform
abortions, but initial regulations let the clinic staffs tell women
about the abortion option.
   After those regulations drew fire from anti-abortion groups, the
Reagan administration in 1988 barred clinics from using federal
money to advise women that abortion is an option or to refer them
to abortion clinics.
   The newer regulations say federally funded clinics may not
``encourage, promote or advocate abortion as a method of family
planning'' or distribute written materials on abortion.
   The regulations also require a family planning clinic that
receives federal money to keep physically and financially separate
any abortion clinic it might operate without federal money.
   If a woman visiting a federally funded family planning clinic
asks about abortion, doctors and counselors are barred from saying
more than that the program ``does not consider abortion an
appropriate method of family planning'' and to offer help in
obtaining prenatal care.
   New York state and New York City officials, the directors of two
family planning clinics, Planned Parenthood and other organizations
challenged the 1988 regulations in federal court the same day they
were issued.
   The lawsuit contended the regulations go far beyond the
restrictions imposed by the 1982 law, and that they unduly
interfere with freedom of speech and women's choice to obtain
abortions.
   U.S. District Judge Louis L. Stanton in New York City upheld the
regulations, and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed by a
2-1 vote Nov. 1.
   After stating that the regulations are consistent with the 1982
law, the appeals court ruled that the regulations do not violate
any constitutional right of pregnant women or family planning
clinic staff members.
   ``The government has no constitutional obligation to subsidize
an activity merely because the activity is constitutionally
protected,'' the appeals court said. ``The government may validly
choose to favor childbirth over abortion and to implement that
choice by funding medical services relating to childbirth but not
those relating to abortion.''
   In the appeal acted on Tuesday, challengers said the federal
regulations represent a kind of ``viewpoint discrimination.''
   ``We are hopeful the Supreme Court will overturn the appeals
court's very harmful ruling,'' said Eve Paul, Planned Parenthood's
vice president for legal affairs.
   ``The regulations would force many clinics to go out of business
because they could no longer provide medically ethical advice to
their patients. Fewer women would get contraceptive advice, and the
result would be more women would seek and obtain abortions,'' she
said.
   Diana Gurieva, president of Planned Parenthood of New York City,
said, ``As policy, the regulations are both shortsighted and
self-defeating.''
   Bush administration lawyers, although contending that the 2nd
Circuit court was right, urged the justices to review the case to
resolve conflicting rulings.
   The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in
March that the regulations are unconstitutional. So did a federal
judge in Colorado.

   Improved teaching won't mean better schools
until curriculum changes are coupled with broader early childhood
health screenings, advocates said Tuesday.
   ``We need to be dealing with the whole child. You're not going
to have an educated child until you have a healthy child,'' said
Lawton Chiles, a former senator from Florida and chairman of the
National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality.
   His comments came at a news conference that kicked off a two-day
symposium designed to persuade health and education professionals
to work more closely.
   ``Nobody is looking at the whole child,'' said William S.
Woodside, a New York City businessman who chairs the board of the
Institute for Educational Leadership. ``We've got programs out
there, but nobody asks, `How are all these programs dealing with
the children?'''
   The organizations headed by Chiles and Woodside form the
National Health-Education Consortium.
   Chiles said a third of the nation's school-age handicapped
children have problems that could have been corrected in their
early years. Part of the problem, he said, is that existing
programs are under funded and serve too few.
   ``We're talking about doing something about curriculum, but if
you don't do something on the front end, none of that will make any
difference,'' he said.
   While expanded programs might require greater financial
commitments from federal, state and local governments, Chiles said
the net result is a shifting of costs because children who remain
in school are more likely to pay taxes and less likely to need
public assistance or end up in prison.
   Woodside said the long-term savings could be five times as much
as the cost.
   Conference participants discussed how a child's learning
potential is affected by factors ranging from premature birth, low
birth weight and substance abuse by the expectant mother to
perinatal, pre-school and school-age health screenings.

   Boris N. Yeltsin has embarrassed President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev again by transforming popular support into a political
office, despite a high-level campaign against him.
   The prize this time was the presidency of the Soviet Union's
largest republic, the Russian Federation.
   Yeltsin's victory Tuesday in the republic's Congress of People's
Deputies presents a formidable political challenge for Gorbachev,
who invested his own political clout last week in a rare public
browbeating of Yeltsin.
   The 59-year-old Yeltsin confronted Gorbachev's program of
moderate reforms with a sweeping call for a more radical steps,
including devolution of political and economic decision-making from
central to local authorities.
   Gorbachev told the Russian parliament last week that Yeltsin's
call for Russian sovereignty was ``an attempt to cut Russia off
from socialism.''
   Those words may have slowed the rise of Yeltsin, who passed the
531-vote majority he needed only after three ballots. But they did
not prevent his ascendancy into a leadership position from which
Gorbachev cannot fire him.
   Gorbachev, who retains the top Kremlin jobs of Soviet president
and general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, left Moscow on
Tuesday for Canada and the United States, where he is to meet
President Bush on Wednesday.
   Yeltsin's victory stood in contrast to Gorbachev's foreign trip,
a showcase of the Soviet leader's foreign policy success at a time
of sagging popularity at home.
   His election also coincided with a nationwide wave of panic
buying triggered by the government's plan to raise prices in a
transition to a partial market economy.
   Yeltsin was born Feb. 1, 1931 in the village of Butka in the
Sverdlovsk region of the Urals. He was educated as a construction
engineer. For several years he worked in building organizations in
Sverdlovsk. In 1976-1985 he was head of the Sverdlovsk regional
party committee.
   Shortly after Gorbachev came to power in 1985, he summoned
Yeltsin from Sverdlovsk to take over the Communist Party
organization in Moscow. Gorbachev also gave Yeltsin a non-voting
seat on the ruling Communist Party Politburo.
   Yeltsin's populist style soon won him the affection of
Muscovites.
   He chopped the capital's party apparatus, campaigned in stores,
on trolley buses and on television to improve food supplies and
public services, and spoke out against special privileges for the
government and party elite.
   For many Muscovites, who watch their leaders rocket by in sleek
limousines while they stand in line to buy soap and other scarce
items, Yeltsin's borscht-in-every-pot message has immediate appeal.
   Yeltsin, along with millions of Soviets, became increasingly
impatient with Gorbachev's perestroika, or economic reform,
program. He called for faster changes and became an outspoken
public figure.
   Then he went too far. In a speech to a closed meeting of the
Communist Party Central Committee in 1987, Yeltsin criticized the
slow pace of Gorbachev's reforms. He also lashed out at
conservative forces led by Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev.
   That speech brought Yeltsin a scathing reprimand from Gorbachev
and vitriolic attacks from other party officials, who accused him
of dealing ``a stab in the back'' to economic reform.
   The criticism of Yeltsin was published in the press. He was
stripped of his post as Moscow party chief, then hospitalized for
heart trouble.
   The word went out that the Siberian politician was broken. In
his own biography published this year, Yeltsin said he felt
demoralized and beaten, but not defeated.
   Now, after two years, adversity and the open opposition of the
Communist Party apparatus has only swelled Yeltsin's reputation.
Millions of supporters relish his open battles with party leaders
and cheer his calls to ease the brutal grind of Soviet daily life.
   He carries a simple message in simple style, using his throaty
bass to boom out accusations and demands in simple phrases, his
square doughy face set in a characteristic snarl, his strapping,
erect figure topped by a smooth sweep of silver hair.
   ``People identify with Yeltsin,'' the weekly Moscow News wrote
last year in a full-page story headlined ``The Boris Yelsin
Phenomenon.''
   ``He's a victim of dislike on the part of higher-ups _ who of us
hasn't been in the same position?'' the weekly said. ``And he is
being slighted for refusing to seek their approval _ who hasn't
dreamed of doing that?''
   The first big step in his political comeback was a landslide
victory in March 1989 in direct popular elections to the Soviet
Congress of People's Deputies, the national parliament. Yeltsin was
swept into office with almost 90 percent of the vote, obtaining
approval from more than 5 million Muscovites and crushing his
apparatus-backed opponent.
   Later that year, he carried out a deft procedural maneuver to
win election to the Supreme Soviet, the national legislature. And
early this year, he was elected a deputy of the Rssian Federation
Congress, which Tuesday chose him president.
   He still is a member of the party's policy-making Central
Committee.

   The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) is meeting in the Mormon
heartland to act on its first statement of faith since a 1983
merger healed a Civil War-era split over slavery.
   In its first meeting in Salt Lake City, the General Assembly is
scheduled to vote on ``A Brief Statement of Faith'' that mixes
traditional Christian beliefs with more modern concerns for the
environment and sexual equality.
   Resolutions on the environment, U.S.-Cuban relations and
Northern Ireland also have been placed before the chief
policy-making body of the 2.9 million-member Protestant
denomination.
   No official dialogue is planned between the Presbyterians and
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but private
meetings are scheduled between Mormon leaders and the Presbyterian
Inter-Faith Office.
   There are 5,000 Presbyterians in Utah, where an estimated 70
percent of the 1.6 million residents are Mormons. Roman Catholics
make up the next largest group with an estimated 80,000 members.
   It is unusual for the denomination to hold its annual assembly
in a place where it has so few members, but the church was heeding
a call from local Presbyterians who were seeking recognition in
Utah, according to church spokeswoman Marj Carpenter.
   ``They just kind of wanted a little reinforcement,'' she said.
   The more than 600 commissioners attending the 202nd General
Assembly, which opened Tuesday, have their first major business
meeting Wednesday when the election of a moderator is scheduled.
The meeting runs through June 6.
   Six candidates, all male, were nominated to succeed the Rev.
Joan SalmonCampbell of Philadelphia.
   The candidates are: Josiah Beeman, 54, clerk of session of
Capitol Hill Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C.; Price
Henderson Gwynn III, 67, an elder at Steele Creek Presbyterian
Church in Charlotte, N.C.; the Rev. M. Douglas Harper Jr., 62,
pastor of St. Andrews Presbyterian Church in Houston; the Rev.
Allen Maruyama, 63, co-pastor of Montview Boulevard Presbyterian
Church in Denver; the Rev. Herbert Meza, 67, pastor of Fort
Caroline Presbyterian Church in Jacksonville, Fla.; and the Rev.
Fred A. Ryle, 55, pastor of Grace First Presbyterian Church in
Weatherford, Texas.
   Stated Clerk James E. Andrews, the denomination's chief
executive, said the proposed statement of faith reflects the
theological maturity of the church since the northern and southern
branches reunited in 1983, following a 122-year-old split.
   The 80-line statement upholds centuries-old church teachings
that Christ was fully human and fully God, and that he rose from
the dead to offer eternal life.
   Reflecting more recent church developments, it also declares
that God calls women and men to all ministries of the church and
uses the images of both mother and father in references to God.
   The statement also calls upon the denomination that was once
divided over slavery to proclaim: ``In sovereign love, God created
the world good, and makes everyone equally in God's image, male and
female, of every race and people, to live as one community.''
   If approved, the statement will be sent to the church's 171
presbyteries. If two-thirds of the regional bodies approve the
statement, it will come before the 1991 General Assembly for a
final review and vote.
   Among other issues:
   _In a document titled ``Restoring Creation for Ecology and
Justice,'' the Committee on Social Witness Policy recommends the
church establish an office on environmental justice and
stewardship. It also calls for incorporation of environmental
concerns into worship and preaching, education programs and
community ministries.
   _The resolution on normalizing relations with Cuba calls for
relaxing trade, travel and currency restrictions and negotiating
agreements on issues such as radio and television transmissions,
drug trafficking and immigration procedures.
   _The resolution on Northern Ireland calls for cooperative
efforts among U.S. and Irish Presbyterians and Catholics to work
toward a non-violent solution to the sectarian conflict.
   Several presbyteries submitted overtures on abortion and
homosexuality, two issues that have continually divided the
denomination, but task forces appointed by previous assemblies to
study the issues have not finished their work.

<HEAD>Soldiers Retake Oil City, at Least 15 People Wounded in Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT GENTIL, Gabon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers sent to take control of this
oil production center clashed with anti-government protesters
Tuesday, and at least 15 people were wounded by gunfire and grenade
attacks, officials said.
   The troops, backed by armored cars, arrived in the morning and
were in control late Tuesday, said witnesses. They described the
city as tense but calm in the evening.
   Witnesses said soldiers used tear gas on supporters of the
opposition Gabon Progress Party and arrested at least 20 people,
including three party leaders. A girl and a soldier were among the
injured, according to witnesses and hospital officials.
   A Gabonese general said in a news conference that 300 soldiers
were used in the operation.
   The city had been in turmoil since last Wednesday, when a leader
of the opposition party was slain.
   Oil companies drastically cut production because of the unrest.
Gabon earns 80 percent of its income from oil and would quickly run
out of money without it. President Omar Bongo's government tried to
restore order by declaring a state of emergency Monday.
   When that did not stop the protests, troops were sent in.
   In Paris, the state-owned oil company Elf-Aquitaine announced it
would gradually resume production on its 60 offshore rigs.
Production was expected to reach half of the 101,000 barrels
normally produced per day, and climb to 80 percent Wednesday, a
company spokesman said.
   Troops began moving into Port Gentil at dawn, sweeping away
barricades set up by protesters. Initially there was no sign of
resistance from opposition party supporters. Leaders urged them to
put away their weapons, mostly hunting rifles.
   Later, automatic rifle fire and the explosions of hand grenades
were heard in low-income areas of the city.
   At the news conference, the Gabonese general said soldiers
hurled grenades over barricades sheltering demonstrators firing
rifles. The general's name wasn't immediately known. He appeared at
the news conference with Gen. Idriss Ngari, head of the Gabonese
armed forces.
   A spokesman at Paul Igamba hospital in Port Gentil said at least
15 people were wounded by bullets. Most were hit in the upper leg,
but one 9-year-old girl was struck in the back.
   Initial reports from witnesses said one soldier was captured and
beaten to death by demonstrators. But, according to later accounts,
he was evacuated to Libreville, the capital, in critical condition.
   The unrest began May 23 with the still-unexplained death of
Joseph Rendjambe, secretary-general of the opposition Gabon
Progress Party in Libreville. His party members rioted in several
cities and took control of much of Port Gentil, burning the French
Consulate and taking some expatriate oil executives hostage for
several hours.
   The French government sent reinforcements to its garrison in the
former French colony. When the troops arrived in Port Gentil, the
hostages were freed.
   Bongo's government had been reluctant to use military force
against the opposition supporters despite destruction of government
and private property. But it acted when Elf Gabon and Shell Gabon
shut down oil production.
   Before the Gabon security forces arrived Tuesday, French
soldiers gathered 1,000 expatriate oil workers into special centers
where they could be protected or evacuated if necessary. Nearly all
wives and children of the workers already had been evacuated, and a
further 40 to 60 reportedly were flown out Tuesday.
   Most of the expatriates were French, but they also included
British, Belgian, Dutch and American workers.

   African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela underwent a minor operation and will remain
hospitalized for a couple days for a needed rest, the clinic's
director said Tuesday.
   Gordon Cohen, director of the Park Lane Clinic, would not say
what the operation involved. Mandela, 71, was admitted to the
clinic late Sunday and had surgery Monday, Cohen said.
   Also Tuesday, President F.W. de Klerk indefinitely postponed his
visit to the United States next month. He said an unnecessary
controversy had developed over his U.S. visit preceding Mandela's,
which is scheduled for late June.
   ``Mr. Mandela will be here a couple of days and is resting _
which he needs,'' Cohen said. ``The operation was nothing serious,
and can't have any long-term consequences.''
   ANC internal chairman Walter Sisulu said Monday he thought the
operation involved Mandela's prostate, the independent South Africa
Press Association reported. But Cohen said the surgery was not
related to Mandela's prostate, which was operated on successfully
in 1985.
   Mandela was hospitalized with tuberculosis in 1988, but is
believed in generally good health.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, visited him Tuesday and said Mandela's
planned trip to Europe next week was ``in no way affected and would
go ahead,'' the Press Association reported.
   He has maintained a demanding schedule of public appearances
since his release in February after 27 years in prison for sabotage
and plotting to overthrow the government.
   He returned last week from a tour of eight African countries. He
also made a trip through Africa and to Britain and Sweden shortly
after his release. He is scheduled to visit Europe next week, then
return briefly to South Africa before traveling to the United
States on June 20.
   De Klerk said Tuesday he was postponing his visit, which would
have been the first to the United States by a South African head of
government in more than 30 years. He said he still planned to meet
Bush but gave no date.
   Black American organizations and the ANC office in Washington
had said they would not look favorably on President Bush meeting de
Klerk before he meets Mandela.
   ``Due to a controversy that has arisen in the United States as
regards the possible timing of my visit in June ... I have decided
to postpone my visit,'' de Klerk said in a statement.
   De Klerk took office in August and has launched a series of
reforms, including Mandela's release. He says he wants to dismantle
apartheid and negotiate a new constitution that will allow
black-white power sharing.

<HEAD>Trial Begins in Italy's Major Banking Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trial of 35 people for their alleged
role in Italy's biggest postwar banking scandal opened Tuesday with
some key defendants failing to appear, including Licio Gelli.
   Gelli, former grandmaster of the supersecret P-2 Masonic Lodge,
and several others exercised their right under Italian law and
stayed away from the proceedings. They will be tried in abstentia.
   The defendants are charged with being accessories to the 1982
fraudulent bankruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano, which was Italy's
largest private bank.
   Umberto Ortolani, one of the defendants and former close
associate of the late Ambrosiano chairman Roberto Calvi, said
allegations of the lodge's involvement with the bank were a
``fantasy.'' Speaking to reporters in the courtroom, he said the
charges were ``fabricated.''
   The lodge, which is now outlawed, has been linked to right-wing
terrorism and other crimes.
   The opening day was confined to procedural matters. Three minor
defendants informed the court they would seek to plea bargain but
the prosecution said it would oppose that.
   The defendants include 15 members of the bank's former board of
directors, as well as industrialists and the reputed leaders of the
Masonic Lodge.
   Archbishop Paul C. Marcinkus of Cicero, Ill., and two senior
officers of the Vatican bank, originally charged in the case, will
not be tried. Italy's highest court ruled two years ago that
Italian judges can not interfere in the internal affairs of a
foreign state _ the Vatican.
   The Vatican bank, formally known as the the Institute for
Religious Works, was Ambrosiano's largest shareholder.
   Banco Ambrosiano collapsed after failing to collect $1.3 billion
in loans it made to Latin American ``dummy'' companies. The loans
were made after the Vatican bank provided letters of assurance.
   Orazio Bagnasco, a well-known Italian industrialist, and
Giuseppe Prisco, a noted lawyer who is vice-president of the soccer
club Internazionale, are among the board members charged in the
case.
   Also accused are retired financier Anna Bonomi Bolchini, and the
former managing director of the Rizzoli publishing group, Bruno
Tassan-Din.
   P-2 allegedly received funds from Calvi, the secretive chairman
of Banco Ambrosiano, who was found hanging from a London bridge in
June 1982, a few months before the collapse of his bank.
   If convicted, defendants could receive jail terms of 3 to 10
years. The trial could last months.

<HEAD>Army to Try to Restore Order in Troubled Sindh Province</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto ordered
the army to help restore peace to her troubled home province, where
hundreds of people have been killed or wounded in ethnic violence,
government sources said Tuesday.
   Critics, including some within Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's
Party, say she has not done enough to stop a wave of kidnappings,
assassinations and sniper attacks that have left more than 250
people dead and 1,000 injured in the past two weeks in Sindh
Province.
   In Karachi, the provincial capital and Pakistan's largest city,
89 people have been killed since Saturday in random shootings and
clashes between rival ethnic groups and security forces, officials
said.
   Despite escalating violence, Ms. Bhutto again rejected calls to
dismiss the provincial government and declare a state of mergency,
according to government sources.
   ``It has been decided after two days of consultations to call
out the army to help the civilian administration restore law and
order in the province,'' said one source, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``The army will stay until peace is restored.''
   The prime minister called emergency meetings in Karachi with
provincial officials. Also attending was Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg,
Pakistan's army chief of staff, who cut short a visit to Bangladesh.
   Ms. Bhutto has accused neighboring India of stirring up much of
the trouble in Sindh. New Delhi denies the allegations.
   ``The country is confronted with civil war,'' said opposition
leader Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, referring to the violence in Sindh.
``How long can the government be ... like the ostrich with its head
buried in the sand?'
   Police blame the current violence on a militant faction of the
Mohajir Qami Movement, a small political party representing
descendants of Moslem Indians who immigrated to Pakistan during the
1947 partition of the subcontinent.
   The group is demanding recognition as Pakistan's fifth
nationality, along with the Pathans, Punjabis, Baluch and Sindhis.
   The Mohajir group once backed Ms. Bhutto but withdrew its
support last November and forced a no-confidence vote, which she
narrowly survived.
   Tensions have been simmering for years between the Mohajirs and
other ethnic groups.
   Ethnic rivalries erupted anew on May 15 in Hyderabad. By the
time the army was deployed to restore order Sunday, at least 180
people had been killed and nearly 500 wounded.
   The army was deployed in Hyderabad, about 150 miles north of
Karachi, after security forces opened fire on a crowd of 10,000
people who defied curfew. They defied the curfew at the urging of
Moslem clerics, who told them to take to the streets to demand food
and restoration of their water and electricity. Officials said at
least 60 people were killed and nearly 300 injured.

   The State Department expressed appreciation
Tuesday for the return by North Korea of the remains of five
American servicemen and said the action was a step toward improved
U.S.-North Korean relations.
   Other measures that could promote an accommodation include a
North Korean willingness to engage in constructive talks with South
Korea and an end to alleged North Korean sponsorship of terrorist
activities, department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.
   In addition, she encouraged North Korea to sign a nuclear
safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
   Ms. Tutwiler also reaffirmed a statement on Feb. 1 by Secretary
of State James A. Baker III in which he said the United States is
looking for a ``steady, reciprocal process toward better relations
both between North and South Korea and between the United States
and North Korea.''
   She said the return of the remains ``is a step in that
direction.''
   North Korea turned over the remains of the Americans to eight
members of Congress in a ceremony at the truce village of Panmunjom.

<HEAD>Week-old Dock Strike Broadens in Romania</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A week-old strike by more than 10,000
shipping and harbor workers widened Tuesday and the nation's
largest steel plant said it only had a few hours of fuel, the state
news agency Rompres reported.
   There appeared little chance of a quick settlement to the
walkout, which has left hundreds of cargo ships backed up outside
seven ports on the Danube River, the agency reported.
   The government on April 25 agreed to some demands by the
shipping union, including a 25 percent salary increase for night
shifts, allowances in hard currency and food allocations for the
merchant marine.
   But the Department of Shipping Transport called several later
demands unjustified, including a further 50 percent raise and
retroactive payment of night shifts for the past three years.
   ``We just want to be given back what had been taken from us in
the dictatorial regime,'' union leader Gheorghe Vrabie was quoted
as saying Sunday, referring to Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu, who was ousted in a popular revolt in December and
executed.
   Dockers in the port of Turnu Severin joined the strike Tuesday,
Rompres reported. Sailors, harbor workers and administrators are
striking in the Danube ports of Galati, Sulina, Tulcea, Cernavoda,
Agigea and Braila, the news agency said.
   Unions at Romania's largest steel plant, in Galati, said Tuesday
the strike had repercussions on the national economy, noting their
plant only had enough coal and limestone for a few hours, Rompres
said.
   The union and the transport ministry said Monday night that
attempts to start a dialogue between the workers and
representatives of the shipping company Navrom had failed. The
union said Tuesday it wanted a dialogue with the ministries of
transport, labor and national economy.
   Navrom, which had a profit in 1989, has lost $10.6 million in
the first four months of this year and is now on the brink of
failure, the transport ministry said in a communique.
   The department said the strike has caused grave economic
problems for the Galati and Calarasi steel factories and called for
the establishment of a commission to investigate the losses.
   The union began the strike May 23 after issuing another 22
demands.

   The election Tuesday of populist reformer
Boris Yeltsin as president of the Russian Republic was an
expression of discontent that could aid reform, Soviet officials
said.
   ``It may be a blessing in disguise,'' said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady Gerasimov after hearing of Yeltsin's victory.
   ``President (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev has his critics from both the
left and the right and possibly it is better to have the election
of a critic from the left,'' he said.
   Gerasimov and other Soviet officials were at the United Nations
to brief reporters before the U.S.-Soviet summit on Wednesday in
Washington.
   Igor Malashenko, foreign policy adviser to the Communist Party,
told reporters at the same news conference that ``this victory of
Yeltsin has been misinterpreted as a problem for Gorbachev. Yeltsin
is also a reformer, although he reflects concepts which are
different from Gorbachev.
   ``In this respect I believe it can strengthen the cause of
reform in the Soviet Union. Today many people blame Gorbachev for
problems and now they have another person to blame.''
   However, Yuri Golik, chairman of the Supreme Soviet Committee on
law, said through an interpreter: ``I am not very happy with the
election of Mr. Yeltsin, but it is a fact.'' Speaking through an
interpreter, he quoted a Russian proverb: ``Only when chicks grow
up to be chickens can we see the results ... So, when the autumn
comes, we will see the results from Mr. Yeltsin's election.''

<HEAD>World's Newspapers Face Growing Classroom Competition from TV</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's newspapers trying to battle
illiteracy and boost future readership by getting schoolchildren to
read papers face growing competition from television, international
publishing spokesmen said Tuesday.
   Even among young readers in Japan, with its low illiteracy
rates, ``disenchantment with newspapers is proceeding at a
frightening pace,'' said Kazuo Ichiriki, owner of the newspaper
Kahoku Shimpo in Sendai.
   Japanese high school students spend an average of just six
minutes a day reading newspapers, and 20 percent of university
students don't read newspapers daily, Ichiriki told participants at
a international literacy conference sponsored by the American
Newspaper Publishers Association Foundation.
   The conference focused on ANPA's 25-year-old Newspapers In
Education program aimed at promoting use of newspapers in schools
worldwide to help youngsters develop lifelong reading habits.
   The international gathering, which drew 165 participants from 20
nations, was a prelude to a three-day conference in New York
beginning Wednesday.
   Among the topics to be discussed later in the week: classroom
newscasts by CNN and Channel One by Whittle Communications.
   Some publishers fear such programming could squeeze newspapers
out of the curriculum.
   ``We are in a war in fighting for resources and recognitiion in
schools,'' said Uzal H. Martz Jr., president and publisher of the
Pottsville (Pa.) Republican.
   Japanese publishers began an NIE program 4{ years ago, said
Ichiriki, because people from that nation were spending just 30
minutes a day reading and two hours a day watching TV. About 85
percent of Japanese schools now make use of newspapers in classroom
lessons.
   ``But NIE is not just to protect our self-interest (as newspaper
publishers) but because the future of Japan could be adversely
affected,'' he said.
   Representatives of several other foreign language newspapers
published in the United States and abroad issued similar warnings
that newspapers needed to make a more concerted effort to regain
students' attention in the face of growing competition from
television.
   In Sweden, newspaper readership among 9-to-14-year-olds recently
has declined after a decade of stability, largely because of
increased television viewing, said Birgitta Pahlen, Newspapers in
Education manager for the Swedish Newspaper Publishers Association
in Stockholm.
   In less developed countries, poverty or indifference pose the
larger threat to literacy efforts employing newspapers. In India,
for example, with 280 million illiterates, only one NIE effort
exists, according to John Ryan, coordinator for UNESCO's
International Literacy Year.

   More than half the states are responding to
unexpectedly sharp increases in food prices by cutting back on a
federally funded program that provides food for women, infants and
children, authorities said Tuesday.
   ``It means we won't have as many healthy children and mothers as
we wanted because all of these people are medically at risk for
malnutrition and anemia,'' Rep. Tony P. Hall, D-Ohio, said.
``You've got to be in trouble to be in the program in the first
place.''
   The changes are being made in the $2.1 billion Special
Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as
WIC, which in February provided groceries to an all-time high 4.55
million individuals.
   Hall, chairman of the House Select Hunger Committee, has been
calling for a $150 million increase in the program for each of the
next five years. But he said that even with that money in 1991 ``if
we stay even, we'll be lucky.''
   The program provides needy women and children with vouchers
redeemable at the grocery store for food, including milk, infant
formula, juice, cheese and cereal.
   Price increases for milk and to a lesser degree orange juice and
cereal have been named as the prime sources of the budgetary strain.
   The Department of Agriculture's food and nutrition service,
which runs the program, had figured on inflation in food prices
this year of a little more than 4 percent.
   But the costs of food staples have risen about double that,
straining state programs.
   Dennis Bach, head of the Iowa program and president of the
National Association of WIC directors, said 36 of the 44 states
that responded to a recent survey said they were cutting benefits
under the program. Hall said a Hunger Committee study found similar
results.
   Only about half of those eligible are receiving benefits,
according to Bach. Many states are not able to provide food to
individuals who fall into the lowest priority categories.
   ``There are literally millions of young children who would
qualify for WIC who are not getting served,'' Bach said.
   ``We've talked to the states about the first measure being to
find less expensive ways to provide the same nutrition without
cutting volume of food or nutritional value of food,'' said F.
Philip Shanholtzer, a spokesman for the food and nutritional
service.
   Texas has cut the cereal allowance for 1-year-olds and
2-year-olds from 36 ounces a month to 24 ounces a month and will
drop 27,000 program participants. Those receiving benefits reached
a peak of 357,000 in January.
   ``When prices go up on food items, that means our budget won't
go as far and we have to serve fewer people,'' said Ray Krzesniak,
chief of staff services for the Health Department's bureau of
women, infants and children.
   Texas receives $148 million from USDA under the program as well
as $5.5 million in state funds plus a hefty rebate on each can of
infant formula.
   Iowa, which has a much smaller program, is nonetheless planning
to end benefits for post-partum women who are not breast feeding, a
low priority on the USDA scale. That would drop an estimated 4,000
participants and reduce the total of individuals receiving benefits
to 45,000 for a $400,000 savings.
   California, which currently serves 470,000 individuals, is
planning to cut the monthly juice allowance for children three to
five years old for an expected savings of $1.2 million. It also is
hoping to save $6 million by eliminating vouchers for cheese.

   A former Vietnam War hero, an ex-ambassador
and a movie stuntman were among House candidates whose financial
disclosure forms were released Tuesday.
   The disclosures of income, holdings and liabilities are required
of challengers as well as for incumbents. Holdings and liabilities
are listed in low and high ranges, rather than in exact amounts.
   Randall H. Cunningham, an ex-fighter pilot who was a Vietnam
``ace'' and an instructor in the Navy's elite ``top gun'' school,
is a Republican running for the seat held by Rep. Jim Bates,
D-Calif.
   Cunningham listed $77,666 in income for 1989, while his holdings
ranged from a low of $465,008 to more than $820,000. He had no
liabilities.
   Another Republican vying for the seat is Joseph A. Ghougassian,
who was the U.S. ambassador to the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar
from 1985 to 1989.
   His entire salary in 1989 was from the State Department,
totaling $46,502. He listed unearned income ranging from $30,005 to
$90,000.
   Ghougassian's holdings, however, were extensive, ranging from
$680,006 to more than $1.3 million. He also listed $100,000 to
$250,000 in liabilities.
   Bates, who is running for re-election, came under fire last
October from the House ethics committee, which found that he had
violated a House rule prohibiting sexual harassment and an ethics
guideline barring campaign work in a congressional office. Former
female staffers of Bates had complained about his behavior.
   James H. Dingeman Jr., a part-time stunt driver for television
ads and for movies, is a Republican challenging Rep. David Bonior,
D-Mich., his party's chief deputy whip.
   Dingeman, who also is an environmental consultant, listed 1989
income of $670,781 _ which included the sale of a his interest in a
steel company. He also listed unearned income ranging from $21,008
to $72,500 and holdings from $40,009 to $155,000. He had no
liabilities.
   Walter Dudycz, a Republican state senator and Chicago police
detective on leave, is challenging 13-term Chicago Democrat Frank
Annunzio. Dudycz listed a 1989 income of $59,660. Dudycz had no
unearned income, no holdings and no liabilities last year.
   Three Democrats are running to unseat House Republican Whip Newt
Gingrich of Georgia.
   David Worley, who lost to Gingrich two years ago, did not list
any 1989 salary or liabilities, and his only holding was an
individual retirement account worth $1 to $1,000.
   Roger B. Marietta, mayor of Fayetteville, listed $51,752 in
earned income last year, and an additional $2 to $2,000 in unearned
income. His holdings were $5,000 or less. Liabilities were listed
from $5,001 to $15,000.
   Joe Forrest, a former Eastern Air Lines pilot, earned $33,002
last year, including $16,800 in strike benefits during the pilots'
walkout against the airline. His unearned income was $6,007 to
$22,500 and his holdings ranged from $5,001 and $15,000. He had no
liabilities.
   Last March, the House ethics committee ordered Gingrich to amend
his financial disclosure forms to reflect participation in the
purchase, along with his daughter, of her home in Georgia four
years ago.
   The committee also criticized two letters sent on his letterhead
in 1986 and 1987, promoting a for-profit senior citizens cruise.
However, the committee also decided not to pursue a formal
investigation of Gingrich's financial dealings as had been
requested by Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark.

   Old Etonians thronged ``ye distant spires,
ye antique towers, that crown the wat'ry glade,'' and Queen
Elizabeth II came for lunch Tuesday to mark the 550th anniversary
of Eton College.
   The queen praised the school as ``second to none,'' though she
sent her three sons to Gordonstoun in Scotland. She told students
she had asked the headmaster to give them an extra holiday each
October.
   Why October? Because the actual 550th anniversary of the
foundation of Eton College by King Henry VI falls on Oct. 11.
   Eton celebrated Tuesday, a school official explained, because it
was the day before the annual June 4 holiday in honor of King
George III _ which Eton chose to celebrate on May 30.
   Eton's calendar, like its modes of speech and dress, is all its
own.
   The school long ago disposed of top hats, flogging, and the
humiliating ``bum freezer'' jackets for its shortest boys, but it
remains its own world.
   Masters are still ``beaks,'' classes are ``divs,'' rowers are
``wet bobs,'' cricketers are ``dry bobs'' and students are either
``tugs'' (King's Scholars) or ``oppidans'' (fee-paying students).
Students wear long-tailed black coats, white ties and stiff collars
in class.
   The myth of Eton is that the school, nestled in the shadow of
Windsor Castle, inculcates superiority of mind, grace and social
status.
   ``The thing Eton majors in is arrogance _ so deep-rooted it is
totally unselfconscious. It's ugly and unappealing, and I've spent
the past 30 years trying to unlearn it,'' said Mark Fisher, a Labor
Party lawmaker.
   Lord Longford says he once was interrogated by King George VI
about why he, an old Etonian, became a socialist. It came down to
``the conviction that we are all equal in the sight of God,''
Longford said. ``Well, I think Eton stands for something far
removed from that.''
   Fisher and Longford were among 50 ``old boys'' interviewed by
Danny Danziger for his recently published book, ``Eton Voices.''
   George Orwell, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Henry Fielding, Aldous
Huxley, the economist John Maynard Keynes and the poet Thomas Gray,
who wrote about ``ye distant spires,'' all attended Eton. So did a
score of prime ministers and three members of the current Cabinet.
   The Old Etonian Association had hoped to lure 8,000 old boys for
the festivities, including fireworks and a ``supper box'' priced at
about $105 but sold half that many tickets.
   John Butterwick, chairman of the Old Etonians, blamed an out of
date mailing list, and a computer that couldn't deal with titles or
the strings of honors behind some former students' names.
   Derek Malcolm, film critic of The Guardian newspaper, left Eton
feeling equal to any occasion. ``I mean, there's no higher you can
go socially,'' he told Danziger.
   Pish and tosh, says Philip Howard, literary editor of The Times
of London. ``You should see some of the diffident, insecure ...
boring Etonians I meet, if I don't see them coming first,'' he
wrote in the newspaper.
   ``I do get irritated by people who think that because we look
traditional and old-fashioned, the Establishment is hidebound and
backward-looking,'' the headmaster, Eric Anderson, told the Daily
Express.
   ``Underneath all that, it's a very modern school.''
   Nine out of 10 Etonians go on to universities, a quarter to
Oxford or Cambridge. The school has two dozen science labs, a
``beak'' for every 9.5 students and even a golf course among the
famous playing fields where, as it's said, the Battle of Waterloo
was won.
   The school has at least three applicants for each of its 1,260
places, and parents pay $14,450 a year for an education, plus those
incomparable intangibles.
   ``Being known as an Etonian is a handicap, because of false
expectations of snobbery and wealth it arouses,'' wrote Howard, who
said one of his old school companions wound up managing a bus
station.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Asks Special Counsel to Expand Pierce Probe</HEAD>

   The Justice Department on Tuesday asked the
special prosecutor investigating former Housing Secretary Samuel R.
Pierce Jr. to study new allegations of favoritism toward
politically connected developers.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh asked independent counsel Arlin
M. Adams to review allegations by one of Pierce's former top aides,
DuBois L. Gilliam, that politics was an important criteria for
awarding grants through two additional programs operated by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Adams, who is already investigating whether Pierce and top aides
illegally dispensed political favors in managing the Moderate
Rehabilitation Program, said he would act promptly on Thornburgh's
request.
   ``It would appear that in light of Gilliam's testimony, it may
be appropriate to redefine the mandate of the independent
counsel,'' Adams said in a statement after the Justice Department
released a copy of Thornburgh's letter.
   Thornburgh based his request on testimony that Gilliam, who is
serving an 18-month sentence for corruption, gave a House
subcommittee about the operation of the Urban Development Action
Grant Program and the Secretary's Discretionary Fund for technical
assistance and special projects.
   ``Mr. Gilliam's allegations concerning how the funding decisions
in these programs were made are related to the allegations you are
already investigating concerning HUD's Moderate Rehabilitation
Program,'' the attorney general said.
   ``Accordingly, I consider it proper and appropriate to refer
those allegations to you for investigation,'' Thornburgh wrote.
   Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian said Thornburgh's
request for a wider investigation was based on a review of
Gilliam's sworn testimony by criminal division prosecutors.
   Paul Perito, Pierce's attorney, called Gilliam's testimony
``scurrilous allegations'' and denounced the congressional
committee that called him as a witness.
   Pierce, Perito said, has ``nothing to fear by an impartial
review ... by a group of dedicated and responsible prosecutors, as
opposed to the hysteria and insatiable thirst for publicity of a
congressional inquiry gone awry.''
   Gilliam testified that during the Reagan administration HUD was
``the best domestic political machine I'd ever seen. We dealt
strictly with politics there.''
   ``If you were well connected in political circles, your
application got strong, strong consideration,'' said Gilliam, who
was deputy assistant secretary for policy development and
evaluation.
   Gilliam's testimony, given under a grant of limited immunity
from prosecution, contradicts Pierce's own sworn assertions to the
same subcommittee last spring that he never ordered aides to
approve particular grants.
   ``I know for a fact the secretary made decisions'' on specific
projects, Gilliam said during his congressional testimony earlier
this month.
   In one case, Gilliam said Pierce ordered him to approve a $2.3
million grant for an apartment complex and shopping center on land
owned by Hampton University, where Pierce was a trustee.
   Gilliam said that Pierce ordered the approval of a $5.6 million
UDAG grant to a project in Florida because his former executive
assistance, Lance H. Wilson, was a private consultant for the
developer.
   Gilliam told the subcommittee that Pierce ordered him to
intervene in projects in Nashville, Cleveland and Miami that were
supported by influential local Republicans.
   Adams was appointed by a special court earlier this year to
investigate allegations that Pierce and top aides defrauded the
government by awarding Moderate Rehabilitation Program grants on
the basis of political favoritism from 1984 to 1988.
   The special prosecutor law allows Adams to accept a broader
jurisdiction at the request of the attorney general.
   The original jurisdiction was defined by Thornburgh in his
request to the special court for the appointment of Adams.
Democrats on Capitol Hill have repeatedly called for a wider scope
of the independent counsel's inquiry.
   Gilliam, who told lawmakers he took $100,000 in bribes and
gratuities while working at HUD from 1984 to 1987, pleaded guilty
last year to conspiring to manipulate the award of a grant and
accepting $8,000 in illegal gratuities.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., one of several House Judiciary
Committee members who spearheaded the call for an independent
counsel last fall, welcomed the move but called for even wider
jurisdiction.
   ``I still do not understand, however, why perjury is not
included'' in the independent counsel's jurisdiction. ``It would be
best if the attorney general issue a broad mandate and let the
independent counsel's investigation go where the evidence
warrants,'' Schumer said in a statement.
   Thornburgh found there was insufficient basis to investigate
Pierce for allegedly lying to the subcommittee, saying the former
secretary was asked ambiguous questions.

   There's nothing fashionable about being
this late, but no one seemed offended.
   Prince Charles and Princess Diana finally received a wedding
gift from Glasgow, nearly nine years after they were married. The
present: naming a hospice after them.
   It's named the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice, which took
several years to finance and construct, and chatting to patients.
   The royal couple _ married July 21, 1981 _ officially opened the
hospice Tuesday, and spent an hour touring the building and
chatting to patients.

   A suburban community is toasting the upcoming
visit of Mikhail S. Gorbachev by slashing the price of Soviet vodka
_ a libation banned by another municipality when East-West
relations weren't so merry.
   ``We felt it was an opportunity to extend a greeting to the
Soviet president,'' said Bob Erickson, city administrator of
Lakeville.
   Erickson said the sale of Stolichnaya vodka by the three
municipal liquor stores at 5 percent above the wholesale price _
discounted from $14.99 a liter to $11.65 _ was designed to
counteract a now defunct advertising campaign for Minnesota-made
Karkov vodka.
   Before the Karkov campaign was dropped last week, billboards
featured the Soviet president as a pitchman beside the caption
``The Party's Over,'' a reference to the Communist Party's problems.
   The billboards were up before Gorbachev's visit to Minnesota was
announced. In their place is a message in Russian toasting his
health.
   Lakeville has advertised its Stolichnaya promotion under the
slogan ``The Party's Just Beginning,'' said Judy Perron, Lakeville
liquor manager.
   ``She (Perron) found the Karkov billboards somewhat offensive,''
Erickson said. ``She felt that as a liquor retailer we wanted to
counteract that.''
   The vodka promotion at the municipal liquor stores began Monday
and will continue through Saturday, Perron said.
   But the drinks haven't always flowed this freely.
   The small town of Hutchinson, for example, banned the drink from
its municipal liquor store in 1983 following the downing of a South
Korean jetliner by a Soviet fighter pilot. The ban was lifted in
December in recognition of a thaw in the cold war.

<HEAD>Judge Upholds Poindexter Convictions, Says Defense Was Weak</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge refused Tuesday to overturn John M.
Poindexter's five Iran-Contra convictions, ruling that the former
national security adviser had presented a weak defense against
strong evidence.
   U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene denied defense motions for
a judgment of acquittal on the five felony convictions of
then-President Reagan's national security adviser.
   ``A review of this evidence reveals that proof of defendant's
guilt of the charges is compelling,'' Greene said of the
conspiracy, obstruction of Congress and false statement convictions
that were returned April 7 by the jury in the case.
   Jurors found Poindexter guilty of lying to Congress and
destroying documents to conceal covert Reagan administration
assistance of the Nicaraguan rebels and the U.S. role in a 1985
Israeli shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   The judge, rejecting defense arguments that prosecutors did not
prove their case against the retired Navy rear admiral, found that
Poindexter's defense ``was neither broad nor particularly
convincing.''
   ``Other than to attempt to weaken the testimony of the
government's witnesses through cross-examination, Poindexter simply
did not have a defense of his own,'' the judge said.
   Poindexter, who did not testify at his trial, is scheduled to be
sentenced
   June 11, when he could be given up to 25 years in prison and
fined as much as $1.25 million.
   The judge noted that neither Reagan, who gave a videotaped
deposition that was played to the jury, nor former National
Security Council aide Oliver L. North, was ``willing to relieve
defendant of culpability'' in their testimony.
   The judge found that Reagan ``may have helped generate an
atmosphere at the White House which led subordinate officials to
conclude they were carrying out the president's wishes'' by
repeatedly stressing his commitment to freeing U.S. hostages in
Lebanon and helping the Nicaraguan rebels after Congress cut off
aid.
   But Greene said ``there is no evidence to contradict the former
president's testimony that he warned his subordinates against
acting outside the law.''
   The judge also dismissed a defense contention that Iran-Contra
prosecutor Dan Webb improperly argued to jurors in his final
summation that Reagan had lied to the American public when he
denied selling arms to Iran for hostages.
   Poindexter's lawyers argued this was an improper expression of
personal opinion not based on the facts.
   ``While the language regarding a former president of the United
States should perhaps have been more delicate, the prosecutor's
assertion was nevertheless a fair inference from the evidence,''
Greene said.

<BYLINE>World Bank Approves Big Loan for China
^By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank approved a $300 million loan
for China on Tuesday, the bank's largest loan to China since tanks
suppressed the pro-democracy movement there last June.
   Approval came despite protests in Congress and from Chinese
student groups in this country.
   The United States contributes more than any other country to the
bank, which is the biggest source of aid to the Third World.
Patrick Coady, the U.S. executive director, is one of the 22
members on the board that met Tuesday and approved the loan behind
closed doors.
   Until last year, China was one of the bank's two biggest
borrowers, along with India. It borrowed $1.35 billion in the 12
months that ended last June 30. Since then it has borrowed $140
million.
   The new loan will go largely for planting trees in 15 Chinese
provinces. China can take 40 years to repay it at less than 1
percent interest a year.
   Within a week after tanks went into Tiananmen Square, bank
President Barber Conable delayed loans to China worth $780 million,
though he continued disbursing loans granted previously. President
Bush then asked that new loans be withheld but later said they
should be granted only for basic human needs.
   Robert Levine, a spokesman for the Treasury, said after
Tuesday's board decision that the forestry loan qualified under
that definition because it provides jobs, fuel and housing material
for low-income farmers. It is part of a $500 million project, for
which China itself will provide the other $200 million.
   Conable has said repeatedly that the bank makes its loans only
on economic grounds, with no attention to politics.
   The bank spokesman, Peter Riddleberger, said another loan _ $150
million for roads and waterways in China _ was indefinitely
postponed at Tuesday's meeting. He added that the postponement was
asked by one of the 22 executive directors, whom he declined to
identify except to say he was not the U.S. representative.
   The prospect of the two loans brought a sharp protest from
congressmen, including Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of
the House Banking Committee. In a letter last week to Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Gonzalez said granting the loans would
endanger the prospect of new money for World Bank help to the
poorest countries, and for eastern Europe.
   ``We expect that the political atmosphere in the Congress will
be poisoned to the point of making thorough analysis and
consideration on the merits of these important initiatives
extremely difficult,'' Gonzalez wrote.
   He said that under U.S. law, Coady should vote against the loans
and try to persuade other governments' directors to do the same.
   The letter was also signed by Rep. David R. Obey, D-Wis., who
chairs the foreign operations subcommittee of the Appropriations
Committee and Delegate Walter Fauntroy, D-D.C., head of Gonzalez'
subcommittee on international development bodies.

<HEAD>US Says Reports Indicate Tibetan Prisoners Being Tortured</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Tuesday it has
received numerous reports of torture by Chinese authorities in
Tibet, and it called on China to take effective measures to guard
against such abuses.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the reports
received by U.S. officials were similar to those contained in a
study by Asia Watch, a privatehuman rights group.
   The report said the incidence of serious torture in Tibet ``is
at least as bad as it has been for years, and in some cases worse.''
   Some officials have suggested China's decision to lift martial
law in Tibet a month ago was aimed at encouraging the Bush
administration not to revoke trade privileges for China.
   Ignoring appeals from some members of Congress, President Bush
announced last week that China's most-favored-nation trade status
would be retained.
   About two weeks after martial law was lifted, a U.S. consular
official visited Tibet to review the human rights situation there.
It was the first visit of its kind since martial law was imposed,
and Ms. Tutwiler expressed hope that such visits will be permitted
in the future.
   ``Renewed diplomatic access will enable us to monitor the
situation in Tibet more directly and to raise human rights concerns
with officials there, she said.
   The administration also hopes the lifting of martial law ``will
lead to further easing of tensions and the release of those
imprisoned for peaceful expression of political views,'' she added.
   The Asia Watch report said there is no indication that the
lifting of martial law has led to the release of any political
prisoners.
   China regards Tibet as an integral part of Chinese territory but
many Tibetans favor independence.

   A radical Palestinian guerrilla group said
Tuesday one of its fighters was killed in a clash with
Israeli-backed militiamen in south Lebanon.
   In a brief communique released in this southern port, the
Palestine Liberation Front said a second fighter was missing after
a clash Monday with militiamen of the South Lebanon Army.
   U.N. soldiers said Monday they believed the guerrilla was killed
when Israeli forces attacked a hillside 1\ miles north of Israel's
security zone with mortar and helicopter gunship fire.
   Israel's self-declared security zone is a strip two miles to 10
miles wide that Israel set up after withdrawing the bulk of its
invasion forces from Lebanon in 1985.
   The zone is patrolled by Israeli troops and the estimated
2,500-member Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia.
   The guerrilla communique said the fighters clashed with South
Lebanon Army militiamen near the southern town of Bint Jbeil, in
the western sector of the security zone.
   On Saturday, the Israeli-backed militiamen killed four
guerrillas from the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine who infiltrated into the zone.

   Storms rolled across the Plains on Tuesday, heavy rain was
scattered over the upper Ohio Valley and Eastern Seaboard, and
frosty air settled around Lake Superior.
   Showers and thunderstorms washed across the Texas Panhandle,
western and central Oklahoma, western and central Kansas, western
Nebraska, southwestern South Dakota, southern Wyoming, Colorado and
much of New Mexico.
   Several funnel clouds that did not touch down were reported in
east-central New Mexico, the National Weather Service said.
   One twister did touch down, near the tiny town of Taiban in the
rural DeBaca County, but it didn't do any damage, said Kathy West,
city clerk at Fort Sumner, N.M. She said the tornado headed toward
Taiban, which has only a post office and a few families, but it
lifted back up into the clouds before it reached the community.
   Hail three-quarters of an inch in diameter fell near Milnesand,
N.M., the weather service said.
   Funnel clouds and tornadoes also appeared over metropolitan
Denver as a cold, wet storm system crossed Colorado, triggering
hail, heavy rainfall and street flooding. But there were no reports
of injuries and only minor property damage was reported.
   Rain also fell across central and southern New England, New York
state, Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, much of West Virginia, Maryland
and northern Virginia. Showers and thunderstorms also developed
along North Carolina's northern coast and showers were scattered
across southern Florida.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
1.73 inches at Wilmington, Del.; 1.63 inches at Dover, Del.; 1.50
inches at Millville, N.J.; 1.45 inches at Atlantic City, N.J.; 1.13
inches at Willow Grove, Pa.; and 1.08 inches at Patuxent River, Md.
   In the West, rain and showers extended from northeastern Nevada
into south-central and western Montana.
   Overnight temperatures early Tuesday reached the mid 30s near
Lake Superior, and an advisory for frost and freezing temperatures
into Wednesday morning was issued for Upper Michigan and a section
of northern Lower Michigan.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 45 at
Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 95 at both Avon Park and
Daytona Beach, Fla.
   Tuesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 32 at Flagstaff, Ariz.

   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev may be
eager to play ``Let's Make A Deal'' when he meets with West Coast
executives next week, but he's likely to be confronted by plenty of
skepticism.
   Gorbachev, beleaguered at home by rising prices and bare
shelves, is going West in search of high-tech products,
entrepreneurial expertise and long-term business relations after
his summit talks with President Bush.
   Gorbachev's June 4 luncheon with executives of 150 businesses
based in California, Oregon and Washington state is ``more than a
public relations gesture,'' said Bill Johnston, Palo Alto-based
Hewlett-Packard Co.'s director of international planning and
administration.
   ``He is clearly wooing the West, and certainly this area. He's
trying to get his economy squared away and attract U.S.
manufacturing expertise to the Soviet Union.''
   Hewlett-Packard has had an office in Moscow for 18 years, and
last week joined four other U.S. companies in a consortium with
three Soviet health and medical research ministries.
   ``There are a lot of problems,'' Johnston said. ``The currency
is a major issue. There is still considerable political and
economic uncertainty, and the two are interlocked. They have a mess
on their hands.''
   But despite worries about doing business in the Soviet Union,
Gorbachev's visit has charged the Bay area with a Super Bowl
atmosphere, sending corporate executives scrambling for a chance to
dine with him at a business luncheon _ some willing to pay
thousands of dollars for a ticket.
   Fifteen companies co-sponsoring the event are paying $2,000 for
two seats each, and up to $500 for additional seats. Labor leaders
are complaining they may be left out.
   Phone lines are jammed at the Soviet consulate, Stanford
University, the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce and City Hall.
T-shirts with Gorbachev's image and tackier souvenirs _ a
``Communist Party Animal'' T-shirt _ already are on sale, and
billboards are planned to welcome the Soviet leader in the city and
on the highways.
   ``This may even exceed the Super Bowl,'' predicted Stanford
spokesman Joel Shurkin, who said the university had been bombarded
with requests by 5,000 reporters to cover Gorbachev's speech at the
1,700-seat Memorial Auditorium.
   A lottery is planned to determine who gets to go, with
preference to Stanford faculty and students.
   Silicon Valley is experiencing a ``Gorbasm,'' said Mark Muchnik,
president of Global Development Corp., who has organized a Soviet
Silicon Summit to encourage high-tech trade between the countries.
   Raisa Gorbachev's planned visit to an Oakland-based program that
helps Soviet children doomed by heart defects, and the possibility
that she'll visit some of the area's big tourist attractions, has
sparked more excitement.
   ``Lots of people have invited her ... institutions, hospitals,
homes,'' said Charlotte Mailliard Swig, San Francisco's chief of
protocol.
   Armenians, Latvians, Estonians and Lithuanians are planning
protests, some coming from hundreds of miles away to register
complaints about Soviet policies.
   At Gorbachev's request, the companies at the business luncheon
will represent a variety of industries _ telecommunications,
computers, agribusiness, food processing, construction, oil,
banking, hotels and tourism.
   Gorbachev's aides chose the companies from a list submitted by
the Chamber of Commerce, which is co-host of the luncheon with
Mayor Art Agnos and California Gov. George Deukmejian.
   ``The Soviets have an interest in positioning the Asian part of
their country as a Pacific Rim player,'' said Carol Piasente,
spokeswoman for the Chamber of Commerce. ``The purpose of this
luncheon is to build a relationship between the West Coast
companies and the Far Eastern part of the Soviet Union.''
   In addition to Hewlett-Packard, other companies with
longstanding ties to the Soviet Union who will be represented at
the luncheon are AT&amp;T, BankAmerica and Chevron.
   Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., said the Soviets have ``a desperate
need'' for computers, fax machines, modems and other high-tech
office equipment that are attracting them to Silicon Valley. And
the interest is mutual.
   ``We are very concerned about losing one of the largest markets
we'll ever see,'' said Campbell, who fears European and Asian
companies will swoop in on the Soviets if American firms move too
slowly.
   ``I don't see any risk to our defense and I do see economic
benefits. One of the great dreams is we'll be so integrated
economically that nobody would benefit from an attack,'' he said.
   At Stanford, Gorbachev had been expected to visit the Hoover
Institution, a campus think tank and longtime bastion of
anti-communism with ties to the Reagan and Bush administrations.
   Stanford officials said Tuesday that Gorbachev would skip Hoover
because he felt his ``schedule was too tight.'' Others speculated
that the visit was simply too controversial.
   ``The Russian ambassador made it very clear that the president
really wanted to spend time with students and faculty,'' and that
Gorbachev could not do that if he also stopped at Hoover, said
Robert Freelen, Stanford's vice president for public affairs.

<HEAD>Bucharest Mayor Announces Plans to Clear Square, End Protest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GABRIEL PASLARU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of Bucharest announced
Tuesday that authorities would clear the city's main square of
anti-Communist protesters by morning. One demonstrator urged
friends and relatives to come to the square.
   About 150 protesters remained in University Square on a cold and
rainy night, continuing a 38-day-old protest that demands former
high-ranking Communists be banned from holding public office for 10
years.
   The government, led by President Ion Iliescu, a former Communist
official, has rejected the demand.
   In a statement read on state television, Mayor Dan Predescu said
his office decided ``to take due measures to open traffic'' in
University Square because the lengthy blocade has blocked one of
the city's main thoroughfares and because of the numerous requests
from local people.
   He said the area would be cleared by morning.
   One protester urged friends and relatives of those remaining to
come to square to maintain the blockade.
   Octavian Radulescu, a member of the Association of Former
Political Detainees, said he would use his car to ram the first
security vehicle that approaches.
   The government earlier said it would do everything possible to
stop the hunger strike by 11 anti-Communist demonstrators living in
a tent camp on the square. Some have been fasting for four weeks.
   Demonstrators have remained split on ending their occupation.
   Six key groups in the square, concerned the hunger strikers
might die, have decided to switch to weekly protests. The Group for
Social Dialogue, Romania's leading intellectuals, backed them
saying the demonstrators had won ``a moral victory'' and they
didn't want the hunger strikers to suffer any more.
   But other groups have vowed to remain in the square because the
government has rejected their proposed ban on ex-Communists in
office.
   The demonstrators say the first to be banned should be Iliescu,
an ex-Communist Party Politburo member, who they accuse of rigging
the general election May 20, in which he won a landslide victory.
   Since the protest started April 22, several attempts to start a
dialogue between the protesters and government officials have
failed. The government has called the protest unacceptable.
   Iliescu announced he wanted to clear the square before the
election, but Prime Minister Petre Roman later said the
demonstrators could remain.
   Iliescu is leader of the National Salvation Front, a broad group
that served as an interim government following the ouster of
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in a popular uprising in
December. Iliescu fell from favor with Ceausescu and became a
critic of the dictatorship.
   Ion Neamtiu, president of an association named for the Dec.
16-21 uprising, pledged to keep his members in the square ``until
the final victory.''
   ``Our democracy is like a frail baby and needs somebody to take
care of it,'' he said Sunday. ``Our retreat from the square would
mean we are renouncing the fight for a real democracy. I'm asking
all the Western governments not to help Romania's new neo-Communist
leaders ... (who have) stolen our revolution and the elections.''

<HEAD>Israelis Shout Anti-Arab Chants, Stone Cars After Bomb Attack</HEAD>

   Angry Israeli youths shouting ``Death to the
Arabs!'' stoned Palestinians' cars Tuesday after the funeral of a
72-year-old Israeli killed in the bombing of a Jerusalem market.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir appealed for calm.
   Two Palestinian groups claimed responsibility for Monday's bomb
attack in telephone calls to news agencies.
   The stone throwing occurred despite a heavy police presence
aimed at preventing anti-Arab violence during the funeral. Police
dispersed the protesters after about 90 minutes.
   About a dozen Arab cars were stoned and some had their windows
shattered, but there were no reports of injuries.
   The stonings began about 15 minutes after a procession of
several hundred Israelis went to the cemetery to bury the victim of
the pipe bomb attack.
   Six of the nine Israelis injured in the bombing remain
hospitalized, Israel radio said.
   Shamir, visiting the injured, appealed for calm. ``It has to be
a concern of all the people living in this area to see to it that
reason prevails,'' he said.
   One victim, Miriam Dadya, 57, struck in the chest and legs with
shrapnel, told Shamir repeatedly, ``I want to see peace, let there
be peace.''
   Shamir replied: ``So do we all.''
   Since the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation began
29 months ago, 712 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis.
Forty-four Israelis also have died.
   In one anonymous call to a Western news agency in Jerusalem, a
man who spoke in Arabic claimed responsibility for Monday's bombing
in the name of the Islamic Jihad fundamentalist group.
   The caller said the bombing was in revenge for the May 20
massacre of seven Arab laborers by an Israeli gunman, who
authorities said went berserk.
   ``Israel still doesn't understand any other language except fire
and steel,'' the caller said.
   Islamic Jihad also claimed responsibility for the Feb. 4 attack
on a tourist bus in Egypt in which nine Israelis died and 21 were
wounded.
   On Monday, a Syrian-backed Palestinian guerrilla group that
broke with the Palestine Liberation Organization also claimed
responsibility for the bombing.
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat demanded last week that a U.N. force
be stationed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to
protect the 1.7 million Palestinians living there.
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official, requesting anonymity, left
open the possibility that Israel would allow a U.N. delegation to
visit Palestinians in the occupied territories, but only if it did
not deal with security issues.
   Foreign Ministry officials told reporters Monday that Israel had
in the past accepted personal envoys of the U.N. secretary-general.
   ``If there will be a request for a secretary-general envoy who
will not deal with security, then it will be judged on its
merits,'' said the official. ``We are not saying yes, not saying
no.''

   A Soviet newspaper on Tuesday published an unusual
list of limits on food and consumer items sold in Moscow, one day
after the city council barred food sales to non-residents.
   The restrictions were imposed in an effort to stem panic buying
sparked by a government plan to triple bread prices on July 1 and
double other food prices Jan. 1.
   In another development, the city of Kaliningrad responded to
Moscow's decision by suspending the shipment of meat and dairy
products to the Soviet capital.
   Here is the list of goods limited for sale in Moscow, as
published by the youth newspaper Moskovski Komsomolets.

   CBS, trying to battle back from three seasons as
third in evening TV ratings, said Tuesday it will have nine new
series next fall. Fox Broadcasting said it'll go to a
five-night-a-week schedule.
   Fox also said it is moving the hit ``The Simpsons'' to head-on
Thursday competition with NBC's ``The Cosby Show.''
   And Fox's shows will air on Thursdays-through Mondays. It had
been expected to add Wednesdays and Fridays to its current
Saturday-through-Monday lineup.
   Fox, which also said it would air a new Sunday sitcom about an
interracial marriage called ``True Colors,'' announced nine new
series. To make room, it axed one of its original series, ``21 Jump
Street,'' and such others as ``Alien Nation,'' ``Booker,'' and
``The Outsiders.''
   CBS' new lineup, which includes a comic-book hero and an action
series whose heroes fight polluters, was described by CBS
Entertainment president Jeff Sagansky as a starting move in the
network's road to ratings recovery.
   ``This is a strong first step in the process of rebuilding our
prime time lineup,'' said Sagansky. The schedule, his first full
one since CBS hired him last fall, revamps all nights but Tuesday
and Sunday.
   It also gives CBS four nights of comedies.
   The goal, he told CBS affiliates in a closed-circuit hookup, is
to attract younger viewers and more family viewing in the 8 p.m.
EDT time period.
   Speaking with reporters here later, he discounted suggestions
that CBS' new schedule is not as unconventional as ABC's and CBS'.
   It's the way a show is done, not the idea for it, that makes it
succeed, he said: ``What makes a show unconventional is the way
it's executed, not cops singing or whatever is behind `Twin Peaks.'
''
   CBS' roster includes five new hour-long series; four new sitcoms
and a comedy once on NBC, ``The Hogan Family.'' It also has a
pre-cable movie package of such hits as ``Born on the Fourth of
July'' and ``Do The Right Thing.''
   The low-rated ``Saturday Night With Connie Chung'' will move to
Mondays with a different format and name _ ``Face to Face With
Connie Chung.'' Two test runs of the new version got high ratings
during the May ratings sweeps.
   But CBS axed the Vietnam War series ``Tour of Duty,'' the
venerable ``Falcon Crest,'' whose demise was announced last week,
and such far newer ones as ``The Famous Teddy Z,'' ``City'' and
``Sydney.''
   However, Sagansky said ``Paradise'' may be renewed. ``Wiseguy''
now is in backup status, he added, with Ken Wahl to return in the
first few episodes, then be succeeded by Stephen Bauer, who would
play a new undercover agent.
   CBS' new sitcoms are the movie spinoff ``Uncle Buck,'' the
blue-collar ``Lenny,'' ``Four Alarm Family,'' about a widowed
firefighter with four kids, and ``Evening Shade,'' starring Burt
Reynolds as an ex-football star who moves his family back to the
small Arkansas town of his boyhood.
   Edward Woodward of CBS' late ``The Equalizer'' will return in
the hour-long ``Over My Dead Body'' as a burnt-out novelist paired
with a young obituary writer played by Jessica Lundy.
   CBS' other new hour-long entries are ``The Flash,'' based on the
comic book crime-fighter; ``WIOU,'' about the cutthroat world of
local TV, and ``The Hammersmiths,'' a family drama with Lucie Arnaz.
   There also will be ``The Green Machine,'' the first network
drama in which the good guys battle those who would harm planet
Earth.
   In addition to ``True Colors,'' Fox's other sitcoms are ``Parker
Lewis Can't Lose,'' about high school life; ``Get a Life,''
starring Chris Elliott as a 30-year-old newspaper delivery boy;
``Good Grief,'' about undertaking; and ``Babes,'' about three
sisters in a cramped New York apartment.
   There also is a half-hour serious series, ``American
Chronicles,'' by Mark Frost and David Lynch, creators of ``Twin
Peaks,'' and an hour series of various video projects, ``Fox Video
Hour.''
   The other new hour-long series are ``Class of Beverly Hills,''
about a Midwestern family moving to Southern California;
``D.E.A.,'' about exploits of the Drug Enforcement Administration,
and ``Against the Law,'' about an unconventional trial lawyer.
   Fox also added a two-hour Monday movie night, ``Fox Night at the
Movies.''
   Fox says it has 129 affiliates, compared with the more than 200
each of CBS, NBC and ABC. But it isn't officially considered a
network yet by the Federal Communications Commission.
   Its expansion this fall was made possible by a one-year FCC
waiver that lets it broadcast 18{ hours a week of prime-time
programming without being subject to restrictions that bar CBS, NBC
and ABC from the lucrative syndication business.

<HEAD>Infant Formula Manufacturers Criticized</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT NAYLOR JR.</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three companies use their nearly total control
of the infant formula market to keep prices high and rebates to
state-run programs for poor children low, two federal lawmakers
said Tuesday.
   Industry officials said their prices were fair.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, accused the companies that
control the market of participating in a ``follow-the-leader''
system of matching a competitor's price increases.
   ``American women may have been paying millions of dollars more
than they should for infant formula because there is no price
competition,'' he said at a hearing of the antitrust, monopolies
and business rights subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Mead Johnson, Ross Laboratories and Wyeth Laboratories make
about 90 percent of the infant formula sold in the United States.
   Representatives of state-operated Women, Infants and Children
programs, which provide formula for babies of poor women, said most
additional federal money meant to add participants is being spent
on expensive formula.
   ``The funds that Congress intended for helping more infants are
contributing to healthy profits for manufacturers,'' said Betsy
Clarke, director of Oregon's WIC program.
   WIC mothers receive monthly vouchers to buy a particular brand
of formula from a grocery store, which is reimbursed by WIC. The
state contracts to receive a rebate from the manufacturer.
   More than 1.3 million women participate in the 16-year-old
program.
   Advocates complained that the companies are offering lower and
lower rebates. But Rolland Eckels of Bristol Myers in Evansville,
Ind., whose Mead Johnson subsidiary manufactures Enfamil, said his
company paid more than a half-billion dollars in rebates last year.
   He said companies submit rebate offers in sealed bids based on
the state's population and other factors.
   John Kane, president of Columbus, Ohio-based Ross Laboratories,
said he'd like to see additional incentives for breast feeding
built into the program and development of ``a number of
administrative controls'' to help ensure its effectiveness.
   Ross markets Similac.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said in a written statement that
infant formula price increases over the last 10 years have been 10
times more than increases for groceries.
   Eckels, whose company was not represented at the hearing, said
it's unfair to compare rises in formula and grocery costs.
   ``Infant formula is manufactured under conditions that are
health industry standards,'' he said in a telephone interview.
``Infant formula is not just something that is thrown together.''
   Both Kane and Eckels said their companies put much of the profit
from formula back into research.
   He said Ross spent more than $500 million last year on research
and product development, with much of the money invested in special
formulas for ``extremely premature'' babies and those born with
rare metabolism problems.
   Officials of Wyeth Laboratories did not return calls seeking
comment.

   Special interests paid nearly $600,000 last
year for speeches by a half-dozen top leaders in the House. Rep.
Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the tax-writing committee, took in
the most with $285,000, according to financial disclosure reports
made public Tuesday.
   Rank-and-file members shared in the speechmaking windfall to
supplement their $89,500 salaries. All told, House members accepted
millions of dollars for speaking and writing, and many got more for
talking than the average family earns in a year.
   The flow of speaking fees, mostly from special interests that
ranged from colleges to banks, was hardly slowed by the allegations
of financial improprieties that led last year to the resignations
of Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the
majority whip.
   Wright's successor, Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., reported
he received $32,000 in honoraria. Coelho's successor, Rep. William
Gray, D-Pa., claimed $164,098. Foley's successor as majority
leader, Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., reported $34,500.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., was the top talk-for-pay
lawmaker outside the leadership, with $160,517.
   House members are allowed to keep honoraria equivalent to 30
percent of their salaries and most give what is left to charity.
Rostenkowski traditionally spreads the excess among churches and
schools in his hometown of Chicago. Republican Whip Newt Gingrich
of Georgia handed over $29,304 of his $67,491 in fees to the
Atlanta zoo.
   The disclosure statements of most House members were made public
Tuesday, although some lawmakers were granted extensions. Senators'
reports will be released Wednesday.
   Speaking and writing fees were not the only source of outside
income for members of the House, which has dozens of millionaires.
   One of the wealthiest, Rep. Amory Houghton, R-N.Y., an heir to
the Corning Glass Works fortune, received $127,000 last year for
managing family trusts. Rep. Don Sundquist, R-Tenn., listed
dividends of $5,000 to $15,000 from his stake in a popular barbecue
restaurant, Red, Hot `n Blue, in Arlington, Va.
   Rep. Ronald Machtley, R-R.I., earned interest by lending money
to his own campaign committee. Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., who
heads the Foreign Affairs Committee, pocketed a $24,000 salary from
his law firm, $11,913 in Social Security benefits and as much as
$15,000 from his stake in a thoroughbred horse breeding operation.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who is under investigation by the
House ethics committee because of his association with a male
prostitute, was paid between $15,000 and $50,000 as an advance on a
book he is writing. Rep. Ben Jones, D-Ga., an actor who played on
the old ``Dukes of Hazzard'' show, received a $10,625 advance for
his autobiography.
   Another ex-actor, Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, earned $26,219 in
royalties from his tour on the ``Love Boat'' series. Rep. J. Howard
Coble, R-N.C., won $600 in a congressional pinball tournament and
donated it to charities in his district.
   Rep. Curtis Weldon, R-Pa., who once helped extinguish a fire in
a House office building, was reimbursed for expenses of 19 speaking
trips to fire-fighting organizations in 16 states last year. He
received no fees for those speeches. Weldon is a founder of the
congressional fire-prevention caucus.
   Rep. Chester Atkins, D-Mass., earned $17,307 as chairman of the
Massachusetts State Democratic Committee. Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va.,
sold a 1948 Chrysler roadster for something between $15,000 and
$50,000.
   Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., earned nearly $14,000
designing Indian jewelry. Rep. Herbert Callahan, D-Ala., was paid
$12,000 in director's fees from the Finch Companies.
   Although Democrats, who control the House, were paid the most
for their speechmaking, Republicans shared in the wealth.
Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois reported $49,300. Rep.
Jerry Lewis of California, who heads the House Republican
Conference, was paid $31,000.
   As part of a bill raising their government salaries, House
members agreed that 1990 will be the last year they will receive
honoraria. Senators will allow themselves lower government salaries
than House members after this year but will keep their speaking
fees.
   In addition to their speaking fees and other honoraria, members
of Congress and most other federal officials are required to
disclose their assets, not including their homes; their
investments, most liabilities and gifts.
   The forms require that values be listed only by broad category.
For example, a multimillion-dollar holding is reported only as
worth more than $250,000. Some members are more precise.
   Rep. William Natcher, D-Ky., whose seniority and Appropriations
Committee position make him one of the most powerful House members,
listed no speaking fees, no gifts, no liabilities, no investment
transactions and no membership in any organization. He listed nine
properties valued at $144,978 from which he collected $4,200 in
rent, and the $4,131 savings account that earned $212 interest.
   Not all are so lucky in their finances.
   Rep. Tommy F. Robinson, R-Ark., who switched parties last year,
listed among his liabilities more than $250,000 he owes Jerral W.
Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys. Jones' daughter left a
$60,000-a-year job on Robinson's staff last year after the
congressman and Jones had a falling out over Robinson's plans to
run for governor.
   Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., reported assets of between zero and
$5,000 with no liabilities. On the other hand, Gephardt, who sold
rental homes in Missouri last year, had no liabilities but assets
of as much as $915,000.
   Rep. William Green, R-N.Y., an heir to the Grand Union food
stores, reported one of the highest 1989 incomes among House
members, at least $507,857 and perhaps as much as $1.26 million.
His campaign committee returned to him between $100,000 and
$250,000 of personal funds he had invested in his 1984 re-election
effort.

<HEAD>Pentagon: Trident Weapon Meets Safety Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nuclear-tipped Trident II missile designed
for the Trident submarine meets safety standards, but a study is
under way to determine whether there are ways to make them safer, a
Pentagon spokesman said Tuesday.
   ``The Trident (missile), in its present design, meets all
current safety requirements'' of both the Department of Defense and
the Department of Energy, Bob Hall told reporters.
   He was questioned about a report in The Washington Post that
said the design of the W-88 warhead on the Trident D-5 missile
concerns experts at the three U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories.
   Only one Trident submarine, the USS Tennessee, has been deployed
with the D-5 missiles that carry the W-88 warheads.
   The report said experts are concerned about a possible missile
explosion that could result in the release of plutonium. The
experts have been using computer studies to see if their fears have
foundation, the report said, but so far their studies have found
``no firm basis for such a possible accident.''
   The report said the concern lies in the design of the missile,
which has three-stages. The missile contains its most explosive
rocket fuel in a cylinder at the center of its uppermost stage, and
the fuel is surrounded by eight thermonuclear warheads.
   Because of the need for continued study, Energy Secretary James
Watkins has ordered a special report on the cost and feasibility of
redesigning the warhead, the report said.
   Hall would say only that ``a study of all weapons including the
W-88, is being conducted.''
   He said the study was ``looking at the safety of all our nuclear
warheads.''
   ``As technology changes, and there are things you can do to make
them safer, you make them safer,'' Hall said.

<TEXT>
   More than 100,000 people demonstrated
throughout Lebanon on Tuesday, chanting anti-war slogans and
demanding an end to the nation's civil strife.
   Also Tuesday, a major labor union issued an unprecedented call
for a strike against warring leaders.
   In Beirut, tens of thousands of demonstrators waved loaves of
bread and Lebanese currency banknotes. They chanted, ``We are
hungry, we are thirsty! No, no, no to war!''
   In the past two years, bread prices have increased 250 percent
while the Lebanese pound has lost more than half its value.
   Earlier, the warring Christian forces of Gen. Michel Aoun and
militia chieftain Samir Geagea fought a two-hour duel with mortars
in east Beirut. No casualties were reported.
   The exchange reflected the fragility of a 12-day-old cease-fire
in the confrontation beteen Geagea and Aoun. The two have been
fighting four months for control of the Christian enclave northeast
of Beirut.
   The showdown has killed at least 1,035 people and wounded 2,770
since it broke out Jan. 30. It has inflicted an estimated $1
billion damage, adding an extra burden to Lebanon's shattered
economy.
   ``Moslems and Christians starve alike. Moslems and Christians
die alike,'' demonstrator chanted as they gathered near the
government house in west Beirut.
   In its first such move since the civil war broke out in 1975,
the General Federation of Labor Unions told Lebanese: ``Let's
strike against the leaders of this war.''
   `It's our natural right to demand an end to the war. We want
state authority spread over the whole of Lebanon,'' federation
President Antoine Beshara told a demonstration in the Christian
port of Jounieh, north of Beirut. The demonstrators applauded and
sang the national anthem.
   Police said demonstrations in Beirut, Jounieh, the southern
provincial capital of Sidon, the northern town of Tripoli and the
ancient town of Baalbek in the eastern Bekaa Valley ended
peacefully.
   The strike was observed in Moslem regions as well as in Israel's
self-proclaimed ``security zone'' of south Lebanon. But the work
stoppage was reported in only 60 percent of the enclave controlled
by Geagea's militia.
   Aoun's civil administration agency, the National Coordination
Bureau, declared Tuesday ``a normal working day,'' and said the
strike was not a positive way to combat soaring prices.

   Parliament amended the constitution on
Tuesday to allow princesses the same rights as princes to inherit
the crown, news reports said.
   The former constitution said a male child should inherit the
throne, even if he has an older sister.
   ``A basic attitude in Norwegian society today is that men and
women have equal rights and duties,'' Jan Petersen of the
Conservative Party told the NTB news agency.
   ``I see it as self-evident that this should include the right to
inherit the throne,'' he said.
   The amendment affects children born after 1990. Crown Prince
Harald and his son Prince Haakon Magnus will still be able to
ascend to the throne, even though they have older sisters.

<HEAD>De Klerk Postpones U.S. Trip Until After Mandela's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk said
Tuesday that he has delayed his visit to the United States after
complaints by black nationalist groups that he would be upstaging
Nelson Mandela.
   Neither the White House nor the South African government had
announced a date for the meeting with President Bush, but it had
reportedly been set for June 18.
   The African National Congress and others complained a meeting
with de Klerk would be a snub to Mandela, the ANC leader, who is
due to arrive in the United States on June 20.
   De Klerk, in a statement, said: ``Due to a controversy that has
arisen in the United States as regards the possible timing of my
visit in June, and also because certain important matters would
require my personal attention during the next few weeks, I have
decided to postpone my visit to the United States.''
   In Washington, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said de
Klerk notified U.S. officials, who ``are ready to see him whenever
he wants.''
   He said the change of schedule ``will have no impact'' on
Mandela's visit.
   Fitzwater said he was aware of the controversy over whether de
Klerk or Mandela visits first, but said the White House had not
``tried to guide them.'' ``We are willing to see either gentleman,
at any time,'' he said.
   De Klerk and Mandela have said they don't care which one meets
with Bush first. But many ANC representatives and some black
American leaders have said Bush should not meet with de Klerk at
all until South Africa's apartheid system is dismantled. It has
been more than 30 years since a South African head of government
has visited the United States.
   In the province of Natal, South African police on Tuesday
reported a renewed outbreak of violence.
   They said 16 people had died the previous 24 hours, including a
a 14-year-old girl reported to have been dragged from her home by a
mob and raped before being beaten to death.
   Fighting between black factions in Natal's townships has killed
more than 4,000 people since 1986.
   Mandela has criticized de Klerk's handling of Natal, saying the
government has not done enough to stem the violence.
   The South African president returned Saturday from an 18-day
visit to nine European nations, where he met with leaders and
explained his plans to end apartheid and give the voteless black
majority a voice in running the government.

   Lagging U.S.-Soviet talks to cut troops and
tanks in Europe got a pre-summit boost Tuesday but a half-dozen
tough strategic weapons issues remained unsettled as negotiators
pressed against a fast-approaching deadline.
   The talks, held for a third day under tight secrecy at the State
Department, focused on the two main arms control areas _ U.S. and
Soviet conventional forces in Europe and the two superpowers'
arsenals of globe-girdling nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines.
   Two days before opening his summit with Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
President Bush met with leaders of the Pentagon, State Department
and CIA for an update on deep economic and political troubles in
the Soviet Union.
   The only non-summit appointment on Bush's schedule was the
presentation of diplomatic credentials from new ambassadors,
including Aleksandr Bessmertnykh of the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev, meanwhile, arrived in Ottawa for a 29-hour visit and
talks with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. ``This is a time
of dramatic change in the world,'' the Soviet president said after
escorting his wife, Raisa, from their Ilyushin 62 aircraft.
   The Soviet leader, appearing tired after a long flight,
expressed hope for ``a new level of cooperation.''
   Commenting on political developments back home, Gorbachev told
reporters he was ``somewhat concerned'' by Boris N. Yeltsin's
victory over Gorbachev's own candidate in parliamentary elections
for the presidency of Russia. But he also said Yeltsin had had to
``adjust his position quite seriously over the past few days and
has adjusted to the better.''
   On Capitol Hill in Washington, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole
said Gorbachev was in a much weaker position than when he last
visited, 2{ years ago.
   ``Bush has 1,000 points of light, and Gorbachev has 1,000
problems,'' Dole said, alluding to shortages of consumer goods,
ethnic unrest and Yeltsin's political ascent. ``We'll be watching
closely,'' Dole quipped. ``If Gorbachev brings more than two bags,
he may be staying.''
   Gorbachev will arrive in Washington Wednesday evening and begin
three days of talks on Thursday.
   Thousands of demonstrators already are on hand, ready to express
anger over Soviet coercion of Lithuania and to voice demands for
causes ranging from a Palestinian homeland and democracy in Vietnam
to a unified Korea and a cure for AIDS.
   Security forces were beefed up to keep control.
   ``No days off and extended shifts,'' said Maj. Carl Holmberg of
the U.S. Park Police. The number of security agents was kept
secret, but Soviet spokesman Vladimir Ustimenko said, ``It will be
a big bunch of people with big guns.''
   While there was no announcement from the arms negotiations, U.S.
officials reported progress on one front and continuing
difficulties on the other.
   The ``good news,'' a U.S. official told The Associated Press,
was that the two sides had agreed on definitions for such
conventional weapons as tanks and armored personnel carriers. The
issue is one of several holding up a treaty to cut most weapons by
at least 50 percent and to set new and lower ceilings on U.S. and
Soviet troops.
   The Bush administration had accused the Soviets of foot-dragging
before Gorbachev sent Deputy Prime Minister Viktor P. Karpov and
other experienced negotiators here for pre-summit talks that began
on Sunday.
   The agreement on defining the weapons not only will facilitate
cutting weapons stockpiles but will make it easier to verify that
terms of the treaty are carried out, the officials said.
   On the other hand, the two sides remained in disagreement over
several long-range nuclear weapons. The officials said those
weapons may be excluded from a declaration Bush and Gorbachev are
expected to make.
   The issues include whether to ban ballistic missiles with
multiple warheads and the number of flight tests the Soviets could
conduct of their heavy SS-18 missiles. The arsenal of such missiles
is to be halved, from 308 to 154, but there is no agreement
restricting improvement in the missiles that remain.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in talks two weeks ago in
Moscow, proposed two flight tests a year. But the Soviet
negotiators led by Karpov did not accept the quota in their talks
with the U.S. group headed by Under Secretary Reginald Bartholomew,
the U.S. officials said.
   The lack of progress in the current talks will not keep Bush and
Gorbachev from a declaration at the summit pledging wholesale
cutbacks in long-range nuclear arms.
   Baker's trip to Moscow produced a breakthrough on sea and
air-launched cruise missiles, setting the stage for a summit
announcement that most major issues had been resolved.
   Yet, a senior administration official played down the importance
of arms agreements, saying the real significance of the meeting
would be face-to-face discussions on disputes over Germany unity
and Soviet action against Lithuania.
   ``I'd urge you ... to put away your scorecard on this one about
who's winning and who's losing, about what agreements are signed
and trying to enumerate them,'' the official told a
standing-room-only briefing at the White House. He commented only
on condition of anonymity.
   There were conflicting signals about movement toward the signing
of a U.S.-Soviet agreement on trade, a condition for Moscow
receiving most-favored-nation trade status.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater refused to rule out
the possibility of an accord, although the senior administration
official said an agreement was linked to a U.S. demand for a law
protecting Jewish emigration, as well as to U.S. unhappiness over
Soviet pressure on Lithuania.
   Details on a new trade agreement were completed last week but
Bush may delay signing the accord.
   ``We would like to go ahead,'' the State Department said in a
brief press notice. ``...The situation in Lithuania, however,
cannot help but influence the final decision on the subject.''
   The statement referred to the partial economic boycott the
Soviets have imposed on Lithuania to try to force a slow-down in a
drive for independence in the Baltic Republic.
   On another front, Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department
spokeswoman, said a new commercial air travel agreement was
initialed on Monday and could be ready for signing at the summit.
It will more than triple air service between the two countries,
vastly increasing Soviet ticket purchases, she said.

former U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Miami.
   Hastings was removed from the bench last October after his

   A Japanese court has frozen assets of an
engineering company accused of rigging construction bids at a U.S.
Navy base in Yokosuka, the Justice Department said Tuesday.
   The unprecedented order from the Kawasaki District Court freezes
$1.6 million in assets of Hosaka Engineering Co., the department
said.
   Under Japanese law, the granting of the order indicates that the
U.S. government has shown ``a substantial likelihood'' of winning
its civil suit, the department said.
   ``The application of pre-judgment attachments of assets is a
firm and decisive action. We are gratified that the Japanese court
was receptive to our request,'' Stuart M. Gerson, assistant
attorney general in charge of the civil division, said in a
statement.
   ``Today's action by the court is an important step toward
ensuring free and fair trade by making it clear that all nations of
the world must be bound by the same international code of business
and legal conduct,'' Gerson said.
   Hosaka is one of 140 Japanese construction companies that had
been accused by the Justice Department of rigging 250 contracts at
the Yokosuka Navy base.
   Of those, 124 companies have paid $33.8 million to settle the
claims. Hosaka is one of 16 firms that have refused to settle.
   ``The practice of bid-rigging in Japan has too long been a way
of life in their construction industry,'' said James F. Rill, the
assistant attorney general for antitrust matters.

   Leaders of the Baltic republics Tuesday challenged
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's authority to negotiate their fate during his
talks with President Bush and said they would not be bound by
decisions made at the summit.
   Also Tuesday, Lithuania asked Soviet officials to restore fuel
supplies to a power station connected to a nuclear power plant,
saying the cutoff could lead to an accident at the nuclear plant,
Vilnius Radio reported.
   Gorbachev is scheduled to meet with Bush on Thursday at the
White House.
   ``We do not want anything signed behind our backs or at our
expense,'' President Edgar Savisaar of Estonia told a news
conference in Stockholm, Sweden. He said the Baltic republics will
``not be bound by the outcome.''
   The Baltic foreign ministers announced the same policy after a
meeting in the Latvian capital of Riga. They also restated their
rejection of the 1939 Soviet-Nazi pact that divided Central Europe
into spheres of influence.
   Their declaration appeared in part to be an effort to ensure
that the Baltic issue is not overshadowed at the summit by talks of
arms control and Gorbachev's political and economic problems.
   The declaration, reported by the Lithuanian news service ELTA
and by telex from the Baltic foreign ministries, said that as a
result of the Soviet-Nazi pact, ``the three Baltic states came
under Soviet military occupation during June 15-17, 1940, and
subsequently were forcibly incorporated into the U.S.S.R.''
   Soviet authorities say Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia violated
the Soviet constitution with their steps toward independence, and
Gorbachev imposed a partial embargo of oil and natural gas against
Lithuania.
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene asked Soviet
authorities to restore fuel supplies to a thermal power station or
shut down a nuclear power plant to which it is linked, Vilnius
Radio reported.
   She outlined the problem in a letter to Gorbachev and Premier
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, Vilnius Radio said.
   ``As a result of the Soviet Union's blockade on supplies of
petroleum products to Lithuania, reserves of fuel have run out at
the Lithuanian thermal power station, which is a component part of
the Ignalina nuclear power station,'' she wrote.
   The Ignalina plant supplies much of Lithuania's electricity and
is controlled by Moscow-based ministries.
   ``The situation at the thermal power station could lead to an
accident at the atomic power station. It will therefore be
necessary to halt the operation of the atomic power station,'' she
said.
   Lithuanian officials did not say how the thermal plant is
connected with Ignalina's safety system.
   Most nuclear power plants depend on a separate power source to
run their control rooms and safety systems in the event the nuclear
reactors have to be shut down. Without independent power, operators
might not be able to control or monitor the nuclear reactors.
   A shutdown of Iganlina, Prunskiene said, would cut electricity
not only to Lithuania but to Kaliningrad, a region of the Russian
republic that can be reached only across Lithuanian territory.
   Electricity is being generated at only two power plants in
Lithuania _ a nuclear plant at Ignalina and the oil-burning
Elektrenai station. Neither is operating at full capacity, said
Radio Vilnius reporter Audrius Braukyla. He said homes were
unaffected by the power cutbacks.

   President-elect Cesar Gaviria urged drug
traffickers and leftist guerrillas on Tuesday to lay down their
arms and said his election this weekend proved Colombians had
rejected violence.
   In his first news conference, the president-elect said: ``I
trust that those responsible for terrorism will understand that
theirs is a blind policy, a policy of hate that was rejected by
Colombians at the polls.''
   Gaviria, 43, made his comments at the presidential palace after
a meeting with President Virgilio Barco.
   Gaviria won Sunday's presidential elections with 47 percent of
the vote. His closest rival, Alvaro Gomez of the National Salvation
Movement, took 24 percent. The results, reported by the national
elections office, are based on a count of 95 percent of the ballots.
   Of the four major presidential candidates, Gaviria took the
toughest line against drug barons, advocating their extradition to
the United States.
   Authorities said the traffickers stepped up terror attacks in
the days preceding elections, killing 37 people and injured about
350.

   Malaysia on Wednesday hanged eight
Hong Kong residents convicted of drug trafficking _ its highest
number of executions in a single day, prison officials said.
   Authorities rejected humanitarian appeals by British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and the human rights group Amnesty
International. They also turned down new court efforts to block the
killings of the eight, convicted of smuggling 28 pounds of heroin.
   Despite widespread criticism, Malaysia has said it would
continue a mandatory death penalty for anyone convicted of drug
trafficking. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad says illicit drug use
is Malaysia's ``No. 1 enemy'' _ with an estimated 350,000 addicts
among Malaysia's 17.8 million people.
   Since 1975, 250 people have been sentenced to death for
trafficking. Of those, 92 have been hanged, while the others are
awaiting dates for hanging or appeals.
   Under Malaysian law, a drug trafficking conviction does not
require proof of actual sale. The possession of more than a
half-ounce of heroin or 3{ ounces of marijuana is deemed to be
trafficking.
   Two of the eight were hanged in Kajang prison, 18 miles south of
Kuala Lumpur, and the remainder in Taiping Prison, 150 miles north
of the capital.
   Among those killed was 32-year-old waitress Han Tsui Ling, the
first foreign woman to be hanged. Most of those executed were
professionals from the British colony, and they included a company
supervisor and the director of an insurance company.
   Police said the eight were en route to Brussels, Belgium, with
the heroin in five suitcases when they were arrested in October
1982 at the Penang International Airport, 180 miles northwest of
Kuala Lumpur.
   They were convicted in 1985, and the Supreme Court rejected
their appeals last year.
   Wednesday's hanging of eight marked the highest number of people
executed in Malaysia on the same day, prison officials said.

   More than 200 bridge players shuffled
their cards Tuesday at Romania's first international bridge
festival since Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu banned the game
seven years ago.
   Over the weekend, about 800 players from Romania, Bulgaria, the
Soviet Union, Poland and France are expected to gather at
Bucharest's main exhibition hall, scene of the city's annual
national fair for the May 26-June 3 festival.
   Dragos Paun, who helped organize the event said he thinks
Ceausescu banned bridge in 1983 because it brought ``Too many smart
brains together,'' hinting at the former dictator's fear of
opposition of any kind.
   But bridge referee, Victor Marculetiu, said he thought Ceausescu
banned the game to separate his oldest son, Valentin, from other
players.
   ``He used to play a lot and was an intelligent guy. He was OK. I
think he does not deserve his fate,'' he said. Valentin, his
brother Nicu and sister Zoe were arrested and jailed following the
December revolution, in which Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were
deposed and executed.
   Bridge fans founded the Romanian Bridge Federation in January,
just weeks after the uprising, and began organizing the first
competitions for its almost 4,000 members.
   Since January, Romanian players have disputed the European
championship in Bordeaux, France, placing among the top third. They
also played in a tournament of one-time Communist nations in Riga,
Soviet Union, and placed second.
   Marina Alart of France said she came to Bucharest for the
festival.
   ``I have found out that the Romanians play better than the
French. They like to attack. Neither the Spanish nor the Belgians
are so strong. Only the Germans do better,'' she said.
   Theodor Chimion, a former Romanian who now lives in France and
also came to play said: ``I left the country in 1972. Then, I
returned to Romania to work here for an Austrian company until
Ceausescu forced me out in 1982. By that time I had already played
100,000 games.''
   Organizers said the festival was a dress rehearsal for the
National Bridge Festival, which is to resume this summer at Mamaia,
on the Black Sea.
   ``We actually never stopped playing,'' said Marculetiu. ``Even
under the ban we had our championships, although we had to meet in
the players' homes illegally. We were about 200.''

<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia soon will form a
coalition government dominated by non-Communists, Prime Minister
Ante Markovic said in an interview published Tuesday.
   His comment was a significant step in efforts to resolve a
political crisis that has paralyzed the country and eroded the
fragile federation that unites its six ethnically and economically
diverse republics.
   The daily Borba also quoted Markovic as saying he might quit the
Communist Party, which has ruled Yugoslavia since 1945.
   Markovic was named prime minister in March 1989 by the
one-party, Communist Parliament but now hopes to keep his post in a
free ballot. His popularity has grown as his government has moved
to halt four-digit annual inflation and make the Yugoslav currency,
the dinar, convertible.
   His suggestions of turning his government team into a separate
party have drawn fierce criticism from hard-line Communists in
Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic, who fear losing their
authority if Markovic forms a new power base.
   Borba quoted Markovic as saying the government will join
democratic elections and ``is offering a coalition of all
parties.'' Dozens of non-Communist parties have emerged in
Yugoslavia in the past two years.
   The Zagreb daily Vjesnik, commenting Tuesday on Markovic's
recent maneuvers, noted the premier has ``shrewdly entered the
empty political space which has been created by the definite
collapse of the Communist Party.''
   The party's authority has deteriorated since the 1980 death of
Communist Yugoslavia's founder, Josip Broz Tito, leaving
Yugoslavia's diverse ethnic and political groups battling for power.
   Over the weekend, the Communist Party formally renounced its
monopoly on power and agreed to multiparty elections.
   Borisav Jovic, a hard-line Serbian Communist who recently began
a one-year term as president, said Tuesday he is sure democratic
parliamentary elections will take place by December.
   Free elections already have taken place in the northern
republics of Slovenia and Croatia, and are scheduled in all
republics except Serbia by year's end.
   Slovenia and Croatia are now dominated by center-right parties,
which advocate a looser confederal alliance for Yugoslavia's
republics. They threaten to secede altogether if their demands are
not met.

<HEAD>Fortune Cookie King Edward Louie Dies at 69</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edward Louie, creator of the fortune cookie
folding machine and the popular risque fortune cookie, has died at
age 69.
   Louie returned from visiting his ancestral village in China two
days before his death Friday. The trip fulfilled a promise made to
his mother long ago, the San Francisco Chronicle reported in
Tuesday's editions. The cause of death was not immediately
available.
   Louie gained notoriety after he invented a machine that
automatically inserts the paper fortunes into the cookies as they
are folded. He created the device in an effort to save his family
the labor of folding thousands of cookies by hand every day.
   Louie was best known, however, for two marketing ploys that were
tremendously successful _ the giant fortune cookie and the risque
cookie.
   The giant fortune cookie was six inches wide and was sometimes
filled with money or jewels. The risque cookie, of course,
contained suggestive fortunes and jokes.
   Louie's parents, farmers in a village near Canton, China,
emigrated to San Francisco when Louie was only 18 months old. Set
on opening his own fortune cookie company, Louie opened the Lotus
Fortune Cookie Co. in 1946.
   The entire Louie clan worked at Lotus, flipping and folding the
fortune cookies with chopsticks until he invented the folding
machine in 1967. The original machine is still operating today,
contributing to the company's daily output of 90,000 cookies.
   ``To this day, nothing breaks down,'' said his son, Gregory
Louie.
   Louie once said his business was successful because, ``nobody
can resist reading their fortune, no matter how corny it is.''
   Louie had not worked at the Lotus Fortune Cookie for three years.
   He is survived by his wife, Florence, and his three sons,
Gregory, Clarence and Paul, all of San Francisco. Louie is also
survived by three grandchildren, three brothers and three sisters.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Eugenia Charles, the
Caribbean's first female leader, expressed disappointment Tuesday
after winning a third consecutive term with a sharply reduced
parliamentary majority.
   ``I do not call this a victory,'' the 71-year-old conservative
and staunch U.S. ally said in an interview at her home outside the
capital of Roseau. ``There is no joy to it.''
   Final but unofficial returns from Monday's parliamentary
elections gave Charles' Dominica Freedom Party 11 of the 21 elected
seats in the House of Assembly _ the minimum required for a
majority government.
   Going into the election, the party had 17 seats.
   During the campaign, Charles said she hoped to win all 21
parliamentary seats. She said Tuesday she did not know why the
party had done so poorly.
   ``Maybe we did not put in enough (campaign work), that's all,''
she said.
   Despite her now-slim majority, Charles said she expected to
carry out the government's development program, including the
planned construction of an international airport to boost tourism
and trade.
   The United Workers Party, formed in 1988 and headed by Edison
James, finished a strong second, winning six seats in its first
electoral outing.
   James, a former manager of the Banana Marketing Corp., replaces
the Dominica Labor Party's Michael Douglas as parliamentary leader.
Labor won four seats, unchanged from the previous election.
   About 50,800 voters of the 82,000 residents of this
289-square-mile eastern Caribbean island between Guadeloupe and
Martinique were eligible to vote.
   The election focused on personalities, rather than issues. Ms.
Charles' opponents accused the prime minister of becoming
increasingly authoritarian.
   The prime minister is a leading proponent of economic and
political integration of the English-speaking islands of the
Caribbean.
   Her tough anti-communist stance and allegiance to former
President Reagan during the 1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada earned
her the nickname ``Iron Lady,'' a reference to British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   She won her first five-year term in 1980 and was re-elected,
with an increased parliamentary majority, in 1985.

   Highway fatalities dropped last year after
three straight years of increases, from 47,087 to 45,454 and the
nation's top highway safety officer credits tighter laws,
advertising campaigns and greater public awareness.
   The death toll represented the lowest ever, in terms of miles
traveled.
   ``Most of these regulations went in about two years ago but they
really didn't take effect until last year,'' Jerry Ralph Curry, the
head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said
Tuesday. ``All of these things working together have dumped them
down.''
   Deaths involving passenger cars dropped from 25,808 to 24,929 in
the United States last year as part of the overall decrease in
highway fatalities, the national Transportation Safety Board
reported. Highway fatalities account for 95 percent of all
transportation deaths.
   Before all the figures were in, the safety administration in
February estimated 1989 fatalities at 45,500 and said this figure
was 2.2 deaths per 100 million miles traveled, the smallest death
rate on record. The 1988 figure was 2.3 per 100 million miles and
the 1980 rate was 3.3 per 100 million miles.
   ``This was not an accident,'' Curry said. ``We worked very hard
along with the rest of the nation to make that happen.''
   He said seat belt use is up.
   ``The leader of the nation is Hawaii, 78 percent belt use,'' he
said. ``Puerto Rico is second with 70 percent. New York State, big
as it is, is next with 60 percent. The national average seat belt
use is 46 percent.'' A total of 35 states now have seat belt laws,
he said.
   Curry also cited three million cars equipped with air bags now
in use; an ad campaign featuring two talking crash dummies, and new
state laws permitting administrative license suspensions for
driving while drunk or drugged. He said Vermont, Connecticut,
Maryland, Florida and California all passed such laws bringing the
total number of states that have them to 29.
   ``The number of people killed in alcohol and drug-related
accidents on the highway is still totally unacceptable,'' said Jim
Kolstad, chairman of the NTSB.``Alcohol and drug abuse continues to
be one of the greatest threats to transportation safety facing our
nation.''
   Aviation deaths were practically unchanged: 1,160 in 1988 and
1,158 in 1989. General aviation deaths dropped from 796 to 763 and
fatalities involving airlines from 285 to 277. But those decreases
were offset by a rise in air taxi deaths from 58 to 86 and commuter
airline deaths from 21 to 32.
   Grade crossing accidents invlolving trains and highway vehicles
accounted for 791 fatalities in 1989, up nearly 15 percent from the
689 the previous year. Rail fatalities increased from 563 to 601.
   The grand total of all transportation deaths decreased from
49,904 in 1988 to 48,243 last year, the NTSB said.

   ``Hydrogen Jukebox,'' 21 poems by
``beat'' poet Allen Ginsberg set to music by Philip Glass, was
splendidly sung but difficult to understand in its staged premiere
at the Spoleto Festival.
   It's presented as an ``acted'' song cycle, with much arm moving,
walking and rolling around the stage by six splendid singers.
   Few words are understandable, far fewer than in most new operas
in English. In an opera, when words aren't understood, the audience
can get the gist of what's going on from the plot. But in
Ginsberg's poems of free association, symbolism, fanciful
happenings, inside allusions and non sequiturs abound, and one line
of poetry often has no relation to the line before. The work
desperately needs surtitles.
   We saw Monday night's performance, the third, in the Sottile
Theater. We were able to realize there are anti-war poems, many
references to India, nature, politics and industry, with
appropriate back-wall projections.
   Glass' music was usually a melody, which the singers _ James
Butler, Richard Fracker, Suzan Hanson, Thomas N. Potter, Linda
Thompson and Darynn Zimmer _ sang over repetitive figures instead
of chords.
   Each singer has a fine, distinctive voice, and they blended
beautifully.
   Following the Spoleto Festival U.S.A., ``Hydrogen Jukebox'' will
be performed at the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy June
27 through July 15. A year from this fall, there are plans to tour
``Hydrogen Jukebox'' to 40 or 50 American cities.
   In great contrast was Mozart's ``The Marriage of Figaro'' from
1786, in the Dock Street Theater. Gian Carlo Menotti, artistic
director of Spoleto Festival U.S.A., staged it. It became the hit
of last year's festival and was repeated eight times this year,
quickly selling out.
   The production is warm and friendly. Spiros Argiris conducted so
briskly that some singers, especially Hilda Harris as Cherubino,
had difficulty. Renee Fleming from Indiana, Pa., is probably the
best Countess we've ever heard. Also fine were Erich Parce, Figaro;
Young Ok Shin, Susanna, and Christopher Trakas, the Count.
   Menotti's grandson, Claudio, nearly 3, made his stage debut
Saturday night as the son of the Count and Countess, with notable
stage presence.
   Our biggest surprise at the festival was the sold-out ``Birth of
an American Avant Garde'' concert at the College of Charleston.
Host, composer John Kennedy, said that no piece on the program had
been played more than a handful of times.
   The hit was William Russell's ``Four Dance Movements,'' three
written in 1933 and one in 1990, and his 1936 ``Made in America,''
first performed in 1990. The concert, which included playing a
suitcase, was at its most fun when Kennedy donned goggles and one
glove and hammered a bottle to bits over a metal garbage can.
   Peter Garland was inspired by Indians and Johanna M. Beyer by a
one-string instrument called a lion's roar, both at too much
length. A 1971 James Tenney early minimalist piece completed the
program.
   Old festival hands were saying there was the most
experimentation ever this year. A sold-out chamber music concert at
the Dock Street Theater, hosted in laid-back, knowledgeable,
amusing style by Charles Wadsworth, sandwiched the premiere of
Frazelle's ``String Trio'' between Bach and Vivaldi.
   The Memorial Day weekend streets of Charleston were crowded with
people walking among 11 theaters, some going to concerts morning,
afternoon and evening.
   Menotti said Tuesday that his greatest joy is introducing the
arts to people who've never experienced them before.

   The government has ordered special
police protection for an Amazon-based rubber tapper who is leading
the fight against the destruction of the rain forest.
   Police and farmers said they fear Osmarino Amancio, now in
hiding, faces assassinated by landowners who oppose his
environmentalist policies.
   There have been five attempts on Amancio's life this year.
   The former head of the rubber tappers union, Chico Mendes, was
shot and killed on Dec. 22, 1988, outside his home in the Amazon
town of Xapuri, near the Bolivian border.
   In Brazil, Mendes is revered as a man who died protecting the
rights of peasants against powerful ranchers, who often hire gunmen
to do their bidding in the jungle. U.S. producers are planning a
movie based on Mendes' life.
   Landowners have cleared huge tracts of Amazon forest to provide
grazing land for their cattle; cleared jungle land is initially
fertile but quickly loses its nutrients.
   Poor peasants and rubber tappers, who make their living
collecting rubber from the trees, oppose destruction of the forest.
   Amancio is one of the leading activists of the rubber tappers'
union. The union is led by Julio Barbosa, who took over after
Mendes' assassination.
   Mendes was the most prominent of almost 1,000 people _ most of
them peasant farmers _ killed at the order of large landowners the
past decade. According to Amnesty International, only two of the
gunmen responsible for the crimes have been punished.
   ``Osmarino has suffered a number of death threats and police
will now accompany him and also be posted at his home,'' Joao
Martins, a federal police spokesman in Brasilia, said Tuesday. He
said police were acting at the request of Justice Minister Bernardo
Cabral.
   Rosa, a director of the National Council of Rubber Tappers in
Rio Branco, 2,600 miles northwest of Rio, said: ``The protection is
welcome but it is not enough. Landowners have gunmen who circulate
freely in the region and they must be locked up.''
   Rosa, who refused to be further identified, said Amancio may
still refuse to emerge, even with police protection.
   ``The police were guarding Chico Mendes and that didn't prevent
his death,'' she said.
   Amancio, 33, was based in the small town of Brasilea, 93 miles
southwest of Rio Branco on Bolivia's border.
   ``If the government doesn't take serious action there will be a
bloodbath,'' Rosa said.
   In a recent interview, Amancio vowed to continue his fight to
protect the Amazon despite the threats on his life.
   ``I know my life is in danger,'' he said. ``But if we want to
stay on the land and protect the rain forest, all of us must be
prepared to run that risk.''

   A reputed high-ranking member of the
Medellin drug cartel, convicted in a seven-year conspiracy to
import marijuana and cocaine into the United States, was sentenced
Tuesday to 30 years in prison.
   The term was the maximum allowable under a Colombian extradition
decree.
   Jose Abello Silva, extradited from Bogota in October and
convicted May 19 on two drug conspiracy counts, also was ordered to
pay $5 million in fines before he can be released.
   Rod Baker, head of the U.S. Probation office in Tulsa, said
Abello would be eligible for parole in 10 years.
   ``For 10 years of your life, you were a major player in
trafficking hundreds of thousands of pounds of marijuana and
thousands of pounds of cocaine,'' U.S. District Judge Thomas Brett
told Abello.
   ``Your smuggling network was large and sophisticated. The
quantity of drugs imported into the United States by your
organization has been responsible for immeasurable human
suffering.''
   In a 1989 decree allowing the extradition of accused drug
smugglers, then Colombian President Virgilio Barcos declared that
no Colombian national could be extradited unless the requesting
state guaranteed it would not impose a prison sentence exceeding 30
years.
   U.S. Attorney Tony Graham sought consecutive life sentences and
$8 million in fines for Abello.
   But Brett ordered a 30-year term for each count, to run
concurrently, citing the Barcos decree.
   Graham, who said he may appeal the sentence, said he believed
Brett could have imposed any term he wanted on Abello, ``as long as
he is not incarcerated in excess of 30 years.''
   Defense lawyer Richard Hayne said he was delighted Brett
followed the decree.
   Abello stood at Brett's bench with his arms crossed during the
hearing.
   Asked if he had any comment, Abello said, ``I am innocent.'' He
also questioned whether his extradition to the United States was
legal.
   He was convicted of conspiracy to import cocaine and marijuana
into the United States and conspiracy to possess drugs with the
intent to distribute.
   The conspiracy ran from July 1980 to July 1987 and included a
transportation network from clandestine airstrips in northern
Colombia through islands in the Bahamas.
   Abello was indicted in Tulsa because of a series of phone calls
and money exchanges between parties in Oklahoma and Florida about a
plan to import 500 kilograms of cocaine into the United States.
   The plan originated at a February 1987 meeting in Aruba at which
Abello agreed to supply the cocaine.
   Prosecutors called 23 witnesses during the eight-week trial,
many of them convicted drug smugglers who linked Abello to
extensive drug trafficking.
   Abello testified that he was a legitimate cattle rancher, farmer
and imported car salesman who walked away from the 1987 meeting in
Aruba when cocaine was mentioned.

   Moving slowly under its own power after
being shoved off a sand bar, and minus 885 passengers it had
brought from Jamaica, the luxury liner Regent Star docked in
Philadelphia Tuesday evening.
   The ship, still carrying about 400 crew members, arrived at
Penn's Landing on the Delaware River about 7 p.m.
   The 642-foot ship had been heading for Philadelphia's Pier 84
after a seven-day cruise from Jamaica when a fire early Sunday
knocked out its steering and the ship ran aground in the Delaware
Bay.
   It was stuck in 22 feet of water for nearly two days, leaving
some passengers partying while others were frustrated, angry and
even a bit afraid. On Monday night, the passengers were ferried to
the Delaware shore. No one was hurt.
   ``I was scared,'' admitted Dorothy Klausmeyer of Baltimore after
the liner struck the sandbar, couldn't get off and temporarily lost
lights and power.
   ``The trip was wonderful, even running amok, it was wonderful,''
said Marjorie Ponder, Trenton, N.J., another passenger. ``Any
traveler knows you can expect anything at any time.''
   ``The crew did the best they could,'' agreed Lynn Harris of New
York City, ``but once the Coast Guard took over everything seemed
to happen faster.''
   She said there were some passengers who talking about suing
``but, for me, the overall experience was interesting. I like
adventure.''
   Some passengers complained about the $15-a-minute charge to call
worried relatives from the ship.
   The passengers were finally ferried to Lewes, Del., where 23
buses took them to their cars parked at airports and bus stations
in the Philadelphia, Baltimore-Washington and New York City areas.
   Ferry terminal manager Gerald Hitchens said the passengers were
``quite understanding.''
   ``I didn't see that many people upset. They understood the
situation,'' he said.
   Ms. Harris said the end of the adventure was memorable.
   ``As the ferry pulled away from the ship, the entire staff and
crew was on the deck waving goodbye to us, and the band playing
`When the Saints Go Marching In.' It was a beautiful moment,'' she
said.
   Mary Poniatowsky, Baltimore, said ``I had a beautiful time''
even though she is a teetotaler and didn't drink any of the free
booze cruise officials offered.
   The Regent Star got off the sandbar with the help of high tides,
several tugboats and power from the ship's own engines.
   Before the refloating, fuel was transferred to upper tanks. The
Coast Guard had feared the ship's anchor could rupture the lower
fuel tanks.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer David Oney said the liner will undergo
further inspection by the Coast Guard and the National
Transportation Safety Board at Philadelphia.
   A preliminary inspection Tuesday morning at Big Stone Beach in
lower Delaware Bay found no serious damage, he said.
   ``Engineering controls were OK,'' Oney said. ``That was when
approval was granted to bring the ship into Philadelphia.''
   It might be months before a final report on the accident, he
said.

<HEAD>Investigators Probe Cauterizer Use in Operating Table Fire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A surgical tool capable of releasing a spark
was in use when fire and smoke engulfed a car accident victim on an
operating table at UCLA Medical Center, the Fire Department said
Tuesday.
   An autopsy was scheduled to determine if 26-year-old Angela
Hernandez of Los Angeles died of the injuries for which she had
just undergone surgery, or from the fire that started early Monday
in the bedclothes covering her, said coroner's spokesman Scott
Carrier.
   Among other things, doctors planned to check if she had inhaled
smoke.
   The surgical tool, a penlike cauterizer used to stop bleeding
from an incision, was present in the operating room along with pure
oxygen, which raises the danger of fire, said Fire Department
Inspector Ed Reed.
   ``In the presence of oxygen, even something like steel wool can
catch fire pretty easily,'' Reed said.
   Fire Chief William Burmester of the arson squad said no official
word on the fire's cause was expected until Wednesday.
   ``We're investigating a cauterizer as well as other tools that
might have ignited the fabric,'' he said. ``We're not quite ready
to make a final call yet.''
   The accident grimly recalled an operating room death in October
1988 at nearby Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where a 15-day-old boy
was fatally burned when a cauterizer spark ignited a high
concentration of oxygen in the room.
   UCLA Medical Center, at the University of California campus
here, is owned by the university regents.
   Cornelius L. Hopper, a doctor who is vice president of health
affairs for the state university system, noted that UCLA
authorities, fire officials and state health regulators were all
investigating. He said the regents would take no action until those
probes are completed.
   No other injuries were reported, but the smoke closed down all
16 operating rooms for the day so they could be sterilized.
   The fire broke out about 5:30 a.m. in an underground level of
the UCLA hospital.
   Surgeons had finished operating on Ms. Hernandez and were about
to take her out of the room on a gurney when the sheets and
blankets ignited, said Fire Department spokesman Pat Marke.
   Blinding smoke forced the medical team to leave the operating
room and kept out university police. By the time firefighters
arrived a few minutes later, the blaze had mostly burned itself
out, officials said.
   Ms. Hernandez arrived at the medical center in critical
condition late Sunday with heart and liver injuries sustained in
the automobile accident in Santa Monica shortly before midnight,
police said.

   A balloon-carrying clown fatally shot a
woman in the face and left few clues to the killing that has
stunned this wealthy community, police said Tuesday.
   On Saturday morning, someone wearing a clown suit and mask,
carrying foil balloons and a basket of red-and-white carnations,
shot Marlene Warren when she opened the door of her home in the
exclusive Aero Club neighborhood, police said.
   ``We're still out there going crazy, still plugging away,'' Palm
Beach County sheriff's Lt. Lou Sessa said.
   Mrs. Warren, 40, was pronounced dead late Monday at Palms West
Hospital in Loxahatchee, Palm Beach County sheriff's spokesman Bob
Ferrell said.
   The only clue to the case so far is a balloon _ bearing a
picture of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs _ that store owners say
is not commonly sold, authorities said.
   The Snow White balloon is not available at most stores, said
Emilie Little, owner of Balloon Affairs. She said she would have to
make out a special order if a customer requested it.
   Investigators continued Monday to interview people who knew
Warren, who managed several rental apartments owned by her and her
husband, Michael, 38. Michael Warren owns Bargain Motors in West
Palm Beach and was at work at the time of the killing, police said.
   ``It's just a real shock for the whole community,'' said John
Herring, who has served with Michael Warren on the community's
Architectural Review Board.

   NASA scrubbed Columbia's launch
Tuesday when an apparent leak in a hydrogen system was detected as
workers were pumping a half-million gallons of propellant into the
shuttle.
   The postponement came about six hours before the scheduled
launch at 12:38 a.m. EDT Wednesday. No new date was set
immediately, and engineers evaluated the problem through the night.
   The shuttle holds a $150 million observatory called Astro that
will monitor unseen radiation and provide astronomers with
unprecedented views of distant stars and galaxies.
   NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said Tuesday night that the leak
appeared to be in the shuttle's main propulsion system or in the
liquid hydrogen system's ground support equipment.
   ``The vehicle was never in an unsafe position at any time,'' she
said.
   None of the seven astronauts were on board at the time.
   Malone said a new launch date would be set ``as soon as the
problem has been identified and corrected.''
   Engineers continued pumping hydrogen late Tuesday in an attempt
to isolate the source of the leaking gas, Malone said. The leak
could be anywhere in the maze of plumbing that carries the
super-cold propellant into the spacecraft, she said.
   About 5 percent of the liquid hydrogen _ or nearly 20,000
gallons _ had been pumped into the external tank, officials said.
Less than 25 percent of the liquid oxygen _ or 35,800 gallons _ had
been loaded. It later was drained.
   The cylindrical tank contains two separate vessels, one for
143,351 gallons of liquid oxygen and the other for 385,265 gallons
of liquid oxygen. The 528,616 gallons are pumped separately into
the engines, where the two gases meet and burn to provide thrust
for Columbia's three main rockets.
   Engineers in the launch control center at 5:15 p.m. noticed
indications on their consoles that concentrations of hydrogen were
building in the rear section of the shuttle.
   ``At that point, it didn't look good for launch,'' Malone said.
   The scrub was announced one hour and five minutes later.
   Earlier, the countdown had proceeded despite a problem with a
loose connector on one of two communications units in the shuttle's
middeck.
   The bad connector was unhooked and NASA planned to use the
second unit for synchronizing data gathered and transmitted within
Columbia and between the shuttle and ground stations.
   The nine- to 10-day flight is to be the first in five years
devoted entirely to scientific research. Astro will probe radiation
that is invisible from Earth and from the Hubble Space Telescope,
deployed last month.
   ``We humans look at the universe in visible light,'' said
Lennard Fisk, chief scientist for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration. ``But the universe is, in fact, bright in
many other kinds of radiation, and Astro will allow us to see the
universe in ultraviolet light and in X-rays.''
   The crew, commanded by Vance Brand, includes four astronomers
who will operate Astro's three ultraviolet telescopes. An X-ray
telescope will be managed from computer commands sent from Goddard
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
   Astro's four telescopes will make nearly 1,000 observations of
up to 230 sources of ultraviolet and X-ray radiation while Columbia
orbits 218 miles high. The targets will include Comet Austin,
believed to be making its first trip through the solar system, and
stars and galaxies, some as hot as 10 million degrees Fahrenheit.
   Astro's observing schedule has changed repeatedly over the years
due to delays. The mission originally was scheduled for March 1986
and included Halley's Comet as a target, but the Challenger
explosion changed that.
   A two-week delay this month because of repairs to the shuttle's
cooling system resulted in further changes. Fewer observations are
planned of Comet Austin, which is receding rapidly from the solar
system. Jupiter and some stars are now too close to the sun to be
seen by the instruments.
   But a quasar 10 billion light years from Earth is now in a
better position than a month ago and will be Astro's faintest
target, said Arthur Davidsen, principal investigator of Astro's
Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope.
   NASA expects the first observation to be made 15 hours into the
mission, after the instruments are checked and calibrated.
   It is the first time since 1985 a shuttle is taking along
components of Spacelab, although the pressurized module normally
carried in the payload bay is being left behind. The astronomers
will use Spacelab computers while working in the rear flight deck.
   Once the mission gets under way, it will mark some other firsts,
too.
   It will be the first shuttle flight to offer ``Lessons from
Space,'' tentatively scheduled for the fifth day of the mission.
Forty-two middle school students at two NASA centers will question
the astronauts through a two-way audio and video link. The exchange
will be taped for distribution to schools nationwide.
   It also will be the first time direct radio communication is
made between a U.S. and Soviet spacecraft. Columbia's astronauts
plan to talk by ham radio to two cosmonauts aboard the Soviet space
station Mir.
   Payload specialist Ron Parise, a licensed ham radio operator,
also will contact amateur radio stations around the world.
   The other crew members are pilot Guy Gardner, mission
specialists Mike Lounge, Robert Parker and Jeffrey Hoffman and
payload specialist Samuel Durrance.

Picks up 4th graf pvs: `His presidency ...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harvard University President Derek C.
Bok announced his resignation Tuesday after presiding over two
turbulent decades of sweeping changes at the nation's oldest and
richest university.
   ``It is time for me to step down and allow a new president to
provide fresh energy and continuity of leadership through the next
decade,'' Bok said in a statement.
   Bok, 60, became the university's 25th president in 1971. He said
he will step down at the end of the next school year and had no
immediate long-term plans.
   ``There's no perfect time to leave a job like this, which I've
loved,'' Bok said at the end of a hectic day after the
announcement. ``But I've felt 20 years was the outside limit. I
thought of leaving around the 350th (anniversary of Harvard) but
the Harvard Corporation asked me to stay on for a couple of years.
   ``It's time for me to look for a new challenge.''
   His presidency began amid student demonstrations against the
Vietnam War. It comes to a close as women and minorities argue for
greater representation at the school. Most recently, a black law
professor drew publicity by taking an unpaid leave to pressure the
law school into giving tenure to a woman from a minority group.
   In recent years, Bok also was the target of protesters seeking
total divestment of university stock holdings in companies doing
business in South Africa, and by clerical staff who formed a union
after a 13-year fight.
   Through it all, the school has expanded in all directions.
   A core curriculum of basic studies was instituted, women gained
equal access to the previously all-male college and the school
became more accessible to part-time students by expanding the
extension and summer schools.
   Also under his direction, the John F. Kennedy School of
Government was developed into a major professional school, two art
museums were added and athletic facilities were expanded.
   Gifts to the university rose from $50 million at the start of
his presidency to more than $200 million this year. A new
investment organization, Harvard Management Co., was created to
manage the university's endowment. And the endowment rose from $1
billion in 1971 to approximately $5 billion, the nation's richest.
   Most of Bok's efforts at the 17,500-student school were low-key.
He worked behind the scenes to maintain traditions at Harvard,
which celebrated its 350th anniversary in 1986.
   But he was a ready defender of ideals.
   When then-U.S. Education Secretary William Bennett blasted
Harvard's core curriculum of required courses such as moral
reasoning as not rigorous enough, Bok shot back.
   ``Instead of pursuing these questions in an informed and sober
manner, (Bennett) has followed his penchant for delivering highly
publicized polemics against educational practices which he has not
studied in detail,'' said Bok.
   Bok spoke out in 1982 about professors pursuing commercial
profit in biogenetic research risking a loss of academic integrity.
   Bok, often ranked among America's most influential educators,
drew wide praise as word of his resignation spread.
   ``He's absolutely one of the leading presidents ... not simply
because it's Harvard, but he has provided outstanding leadership,''
said Robert Hochstein, of The Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching.
   The university said a committee was being formed to find a
successor for Bok, who had been the subject of wide speculation
that he would step down.
   Bok, a Stanford University graduate, earned a law degree from
Harvard in 1954. He joined the Harvard Law School faculty in 1958
and became dean of that school in 1968.
   He is the author of several books, including one on labor law
with Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox and three on higher
education.
   He has served as chairman of the American Council on Education
and the Association of American Universities and as a member of the
board of the National Association of Independent Colleges and
Universities.

<HEAD>Commonwealth Party Condemns Bush Statehood Drive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing pro-Commonwealth
party unanimously passed a resolution on Tuesday condemning the
``repeated intervention'' of President Bush in favor of statehood
for Puerto Rico.
   The 100-member general council of the Popular Democratic Party
passed the measure, presented by Senate leader Miguel Hernandez
Agosto, after an all-day meeting.
   Legislation before the U.S. Congress would allow Puerto Ricans
to hold a referendum in 1991 on whether to remain a U.S.
commonwealth with increased autonomy, become the 51st state or form
an independent nation.
   The New Progressive Party has favored statehood for the
commonwealth.
   The resolution said the Popular Democratic Party ``energetically
repudiates any attempt by the government of the United States to
manipulate Puerto Rican public opinion'' in the proposed plebiscite.
   ``The repeated intervention by President Bush as statehood's
leading advocate in the plebiscite process represents a misuse of
presidential power,'' it said.
   Answering previous charges of ``outside interference,'' Bush
wrote Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon last Friday and said as president
he had ``certain responsibilities for all the territory under the
American flag.'' He said he had the right to favor statehood for
this Caribbean island.
   Hernandez Colon, leader of the pro-commonwealth party, said Bush
had a right to his personal opinion, but that he felt Bush was
abusing his power as president.
   Earlier, he said Bush was treating Puerto Rico ``like a Baltic
republic'' by sending two White House officials to the island to
attend pro-statehood rallies and meet with statehood party leaders.
   Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States in 1890 at the end
of the Spanish-American war. It became a U.S. commonwealth in 1952,
an arrangement under which its 3.3 million residents are U.S.
citizens and can be drafted but don't pay federal taxes and are
ineligible to vote for president.

   An explosion blasted a natural gas well
Tuesday in southeastern Mississippi, killing at least one worker
and critically burning four others, authorities said.
   A two-mile area around the well was evacuated, affecting about
145 people.
   Authorities initially evacuated only those within a half-mile,
but expanded the plan after the fire went out by itself and then
re-ignited, for fear that winds would scatter poisonous hydrogen
sulfide gas.
   The gas is naturally associated with some gas fields.
   Experts at capping gas wells were to fly in Tuesday night. The
explosion occurred at about 2 p.m., authorities said.
   The rig collapsed in the initial burst of what sounded like four
successive explosions, said Alex Thomas, who lives within a
half-mile of the rig. Others said there was another explosion later
in the afternoon.
   Jim Maher, director of the Mississippi Emergency Management
Agency in Jackson, said officials intended to keep the gas escaping
from the well afire to burn off the poison.
   ``What they are going to do is bring a flame thrower-type device
to keep the well burning,'' Maher said.
   Roads were closed leading to the well, which is about 75 miles
southeast of Jackson, as was a five-mile stretch of U.S. Highway 11.
   ``Until we get a firm handle on this and somebody that can tell
us with absolute certainty what is going on there, we will continue
to take extreme precautions,'' said Mississippi Emergency
Management Agency spokesman Dusty Perkins.
   Perkins said the rig was known as Travis No. 3 and was owned by
R&amp;H Oil and Gas Inc. of Tickfaw, La.
   City Clerk Debbie Logan identified the dead man as Dwayne
Kennedy of Heidelberg. His age and exact job were unavailable.
   The four burn victims were in critical condition and would be
moved to burn units in Greenville and in Mobile, Ala., said Lafe
Jones, a spokesman for the South Central Regional Medical Center in
Laurel. A fifth worker was treated for minor injuries and released.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev expressed confidence Tuesday
on the eve of a superpower summit that he and President Bush will
agree on a formula for permitting German unification without
upsetting the balance of power in Europe.
   The Soviet president's comments came Tuesday evening in the
Canadian capital, where he made a stopover en route to Washington
for his second summit with Bush.
   Asked if he was optimistic about reaching agreement with the
United States over Germany and its membership in NATO, Gorbachev
replied, ``I am sure of that. And tell that to the American
people.''
   Gorbachev's remark to reporters during a walking tour of a
downtown Ottawa mall marked a sharp turn from the gloomy
assessments of Bush and his senior advisers in recent days and
Gorbachev's own warning that U.S. insistence on a new, united
Germany retaining West Germany's seat in NATO could stall the
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe.
   The Soviet Union, which lost more than 20 million people to Nazi
forces, has moved from outright opposition to German unification to
acceptance of the concept under some formula that would provide
assurances a new German giant would never again pose a military
threat to its neighbors.
   Gorbachev left behind worsening domestic problems _ including
panic-buying, attempts by the Baltic republics to secede from the
Soviet Union and clashes between troops and militants in Armenia _
as he arrived Tuesday in Ottawa.
   After talks with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Gorbachev was
cheered by thousands as he strolled through a downtown mall.
   For Gorbachev, the 29-hour stopover marked his second trip to
Canada, which he first visited in 1983, when he was in charge of
Soviet agriculture policy and was gaining notice as a rising star
in the Communist Party hierarchy.
   On this visit, he was not accompanied by Alexander Yakovlev, a
former ambassador to Canada who now advises Gorbachev on
international affairs and has accompanied Gorbachev on other trips
to the West.
   Yakovlev's absence was seen as an indication Gorbachev felt
compelled to leave at least one member of his inner circle in
Moscow to oversee events in the troubled country during his travels.
   During his walk, Gorbachev shook hands and talked with people
lining police barriers and chanting ``Gor-by! Gor-by! Gor-by!''
   Gorbachev, accompanied by his wife, Raisa, and at least 20
bodyguards, spoke with one man who asked him about Lithuania, one
of three Baltic republics seeking independence from Moscow.
   Gorbachev said he was confident the impasse with the Baltic
republic could be resolved politically and a system of federalism
could provide a framework for Soviet republics pushing for greater
sovereignty.
   ``Look at Canada,'' Gorbachev said through a translator,
referring to a separatist movement in French-speaking Quebec
province. ``You have so many nationalities ... if we show some good
will, these problems can be solved.''
   Gorbachev told reporters after talks with Mulroney that they did
not discuss Lithuania, but the subject was mentioned in separate
talks between Joe Clark, Canada's minister for external relations,
and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Clark said they
hoped ``the Lithuanian matter would be resolved by negotiation.''
   Clark said he and Shevardnadze were in general agreement during
their talks about the importance of using the 35-nation Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe as a mechanism for building a
new Europe. Both countries will work toward a conference summit
later this year, Clark said.
   Across the street from the Soviet Embassy, a handful of youths
appealing for independence for the Baltic republics spent the day
pacing on the sidewalk, carrying flags and waving to motorists who
honked their horns.
   Leaders of the three republics, which were forcibly annexed by
the Soviet Union in 1940 and are trying to secede, challenged
Gorbachev's authority to negotiate their fate during his talks with
President Bush. They also said Tuesday they would not be bound by
decisions made at the Washington summit.
   Addressing another domestic topic, Gorbachev told reporters he
was ``somewhat concerned'' by the election Tuesday of radical
reformer Boris N. Yeltsin as president of Russia, the largest of
the 15 Soviet republics.
   Yeltsin narrowly defeated Gorbachev's candidate in the
parliamentary elections in Moscow.
   The victory gives one of Gorbachev's most vociferous critics a
new platform to criticize his economic reforms, which Yeltsin
contends have not gone far enough to salvage the country from
severe economic decline.
   Gorbachev called the protracted voting that Yeltsin won ``a kind
of confrontation.''
   Gorbachev, looking tired with deep creases in his brow, arrived
at the Uplands Canadian Forces Base outside Ottawa and was greeted
by Governor General Ray Hnatyshn and Mulroney.
   Snipers were posted on rooftops at the airport and security was
tight along Gorbachev's route to downtown Ottawa.
   One house along the route proudly displayed a large homemade
sign in Russian: ``Hello, Mr. President. Come and have a beer.''
   Gorbachev heads to Washington on Wednesday for the summit with
Bush, expected to focus on German unification, arms reduction and
trade. On Sunday, he plans to leave Washington for Minneapolis,
followed by a trip to San Francisco.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's motorcade, all 70 cars,
slowed down on the way from the airport to the Canadian capital on
Tuesday as it passed Spike Wormington's hand-printed sign.
   To Wormington's chagrin, however, the Soviet president did not
stop. Apparently, Gorbachev wasn't thirsty enough.
   ``Hello, Mr. Gorbachev. Drop in for a beer,'' the sign said in
Russian.
   ``He always makes an impromptu stop,'' said Wormington, 25, a
part-time high school math teacher and land surveyor. ``I thought
this might be it.''
   He did stop Tuesday, but it was hardly impromptu.
   A half-dozen limousines, flanked by police cars, swung into the
heart of a downtown mall at 7:15 p.m., and Gorbachev emerged from
his limousine to the cheers of thousands who gathered after TV news
programs announced he was about to make one of his trademark
``walkabouts.''
   With his wife, Raisa, at his side, Gorbachev shook hands and
stopped often to talk with people lining police barriers.
   One of those he charmed was Diane Carter, 30, a legal secretary
from Ottawa, who said he told her she didn't look her age.
   ``That was the most important thing,'' she said. ``He wanted to
know how old I was. He wanted to know what I worked at and how much
I made.''
   The crowd burst into cheers when he signed a copy of his book,
``Perestroika,'' for one man.
   There were intermittant chants of ``Gor-by! Gor-by! Gor-by!''
and people stuck their heads out of windows to catch a glimpse of
Gorbachev as, surrounded by at least 20 bodyguards, he made his way
leisurely along the mall, spending 45 minutes strolling and
chatting amiably with spectators.
   Canadians had reason to expect a stop by Gorbachev. On almost
every trip Gorbachev takes into the Soviet countryside or abroad,
he finds time for at least one more or less spontaneous encounter
with the public.
   He caused a paralyzing traffic jam and a media sensation in
Decmber 1987 when he ordered his limousine to a sudden halt on
Connecticut Avenue in downtown Washington and plunged into a crowd,
shaking hands and engaging in good-natured banter. The move was so
unexpected that part of his motorcade cruised on ahead and got
separated from him.
   When Gorbachev takes a stroll, however, the crowds and confusion
can ruin even the best-laid plans. In Belgrade, the capital of
Yugoslavia, security men got nervous about the crush of people and
hustled Gorbachev's entourage back into limousines for a quick
departure. It all happened so fast, they left the local mayor's
wife behind.
   Camera crews are always particularly eager to know where to set
up in time to capture Gorbachev's smile and friendly gestures as he
and his wife, Raisa, charm a crowd.
   At about 5 p.m., as Gorbachev neared the end of his first day of
meetings with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and other officials,
Mulroney's office said Gorbachev might appear at the downtown
Sparks Street Mall two hours later.
   Thousands of residents flocked to the pedestrian shopping area.
   ``I want to see his aura,'' said Dan Creed, 23, as he jogged
from Ottawa University to the mall. ``He's gone to great lengths to
craft his image, so we might as well see it in person.''
   Not everyone had a pleasant message for Gorbachev.
   ``Free the Baltic states. It's their right,'' said Richard
Calendra, 23, of Toronto, who was waving a yellow, green and red
Lithuanian flag to signal his support for the breakaway Baltic
republic.
   Calendra and about a dozen other protesters waving Estonian and
Latvian flags as well as the Lithuanian banner lined the mall.
   A larger demonstration was scheduled at Parliament Hill on
Wednesday before Gorbachev leaves Canada for Washington for his
second summit with President Bush.

   A state auction of an estimated
$750,000 worth of jewelery belonging to Mexican drug trafficker
Rafael Caro Quintero was canceled Tuesday after no bids were placed.
   Caro Quintero is serving 65 years in Mexico for drug running and
for the murder of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent
Enrique Camarena.
   Costa Rica's attorney general's office required a 5 percent
deposit on the estimated value of each item before bidding began,
but no deposits were placed.
   ``We went through the opening of the auction today just for
protocol but we knew in advance that nobody would buy any of the
jewels because the deadline for making the deposits was
yesterday,'' said Roxana Hernandez, an official with the attorney
general's office.
   Caro Quintero was captured in 1985 by Costa Rican authorities
and U.S. drug agents. It is unclear how he later wound up in
Mexico, where he was convicted of murder and drug trafficking.
   His jewels became property of the state after his conviction.
   The items included rings, watches, gold chains and bracelets.

   Freed hostage Frank Reed urged a crowd of
several thousand to remember those still held captive in the Middle
East as he spoke Tuesday at a festive homecoming celebration.
   Joined by his wife and other relatives in front of City Hall,
Reed called on local well-wishers to ``keep thinking about those
fellows over there who were my mates and those who weren't.''
   Reed, head of the private Lebanese International School when
gunmen abducted him in September 1986, said he was torn between the
desire to stay close to home and the urge to publicize the plights
of the remaining six American and 10 other Western hostages.
   Still, the 57-year-old Reed reveled in a glorious homecoming. He
smiled and joked while thanking those who kept hope alive during
his 44 months in captivity.
   ``I'm not sure I deserve all you've given me,'' Reed said. ``I
want to say to say to you ... I love you, Malden.''
   The people in this suburb north of Boston tied hundreds of
yellow ribbons around trees and erupted in applause and cheers as
Reed and the Malden High School marching band led a parade through
downtown to City Hall.
   ``I kept my Bible open for him,'' said Carol Babb, 44, of
Malden. ``My prayers were answered.''
   Reed, released April 30, was scheduled to return to Andrews Air
Force Base in Maryland late Tuesday to continue medical treatment.
Reed, who suffers from severe anemia, is expected to remain
hospitalized at least two more weeks.
   ``His life was wasted all those years,'' said William Dulong,
who along with the rest of the crowd came out to greet Reed under
cloudy skies. ``They really hurt him.''
   Citizens here repeatedly demanded that the captors holding
Western hostages in the Middle East be quickly brought to justice.
   ``I've been praying for (Reed's) release ... but they should all
be home, Anderson and the rest of them,'' said Eugene Christie, 69,
a lifelong Malden resident.
   Christie was referring to the longest-held hostage _ Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press
_ who's is his sixth year in captivity.
   The other Americans still held hostage are Joseph James
Cicippio, 59, who was acting comptroller at the American University
in Beirut; Edward Austin Tracy, 59, a west Beirut resident; Alann
Steen, 51, a communications instructor at Beirut University
College; Jesse Jonathan Turner, 42, a professor of mathematics and
computer science at Beirut University College; and Thomas
Sutherland, 59, former dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut.
   Reed has said he hopes to complete his doctorate at Boston
College and continue his career as an educator.
   He has also said he hopes to write a book about his experiences
while at the same time traveling abroad to raise awareness about
the hostages still in captivity.

   Crews scrambled Tuesday to contain
120,000 gallons of fuel that spilled after an Alaska Railroad train
derailed and scattered cars on both sides of the track.
   Seven of the 19 cars that derailed were leaking fuel, railroad
spokeswoman Vivian Hamilton said at the scene. Each of the tanker
cars held 20,000 gallons, and two of them were totally drained.
   A spokesman for the state Department of Environmental
Conservation earlier had erroneously said in Juneau that all 19
derailed cars were leaking.
   The southbound train with 68 cars derailed at about 1:30 p.m.
Monday, said Arnold Polanchek, vice president of operations for the
state-owned Alaska Railroad Corp.
   The fuel was en route to Anchorage from the Mapco Alaska
Petroleum Inc. refinery in the town of North Pole, near Fairbanks.
   By early Tuesday, pumps and hoses had begun siphoning the fuel
from the ground, said Paul Bateman, Fairbanks program manager for
the state environmental department.
   ``We've got cars upside down, sideways, holed on both ends.
They're in all shapes and condition. It's a mess,'' said Bateman,
who spent Monday night at the scene.
   Railroad crews were also on the scene, about 40 miles south of
Fairbanks near Dunbar Station, Polanchek said. The crews worked to
rebuild nearly 300 feet of track and remove the tanker cars. They
also laid absorbent boom and began trying to skim oil off the
surface of a nearby creek.
   No one was injured in the derailment and the company was trying
to determine its cause, Polanchek said.
   Hundreds of tourists scheduled to visit Denali National Park and
Preserve and the Mount McKinley area by train Tuesday were to be
bused around the wreck, tour officials said.
   The fuel had drained into two beaver ponds and into Goldstream
Creek, which flows into a wildlife refuge about 40 miles south of
Fairbanks. It appeared to be at least several inches thick on a
small stream that fed the creek.
   More of the fuel probably would have run into the creek had it
not been for some beaver dams that contained it, a state
environmental official said.
   Workers used a bulldozer to shore up one of the dams and used
plywood and absorbent pads to strengthen the other, said Chuck
Kleeschulte of the state Department of Environmental Conservation.
   ``The beavers are very helpful,'' he said.
   Railroad officials initially estimated the spill's size at
60,000 to 80,000 gallons, but Dale Nelson, an environmental
engineer for the railroad, later revised the estimate upward to
120,000 gallons of jet and diesel fuel.
   ``This is a major spill, one of the most major I've seen at the
railroad,'' Nelson said.
   The Alaska Railroad was purchased by the state from the federal
government in 1985. It runs one freight train northbound and one
train southbound daily.

<HEAD>Duke's Affirmative Action Bill Passes House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY COATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Louisiana House Tuesday passed a
bill banning affirmative action programs that was sponsored by
state Rep. David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.
   The 66-28 vote crossed party lines; 13 people abstained. The
bill was sent to the Senate.
   ``Some are going to call this bill racist,'' said Duke, a
Republican. ``This bill simply prohibits racial discrimination in
hiring, promotion, scholarships ...
   ``It prohibits affirmative action programs that discriminate on
the basis of race. ... There is no justification to discriminate
against someone who works hard, who is qualified for a job.''
   Duke said his bill would outlaw the use of racial quotas in
promotions or hiring.
   ``I'd love to see the day that everybody is treated fairly.
That's not what is going on,'' said Democratic Rep. Diana Bajoie.
``Many of you see me as a black woman before you see me as a member
of this House.''
   She went on: ``You would think we never had discrimination. We
have tried to right some wrongs perpetrated on our people for 100,
200 years since they entered this country. It's too early to stop
that. It's only been 25 years since we passed the Civil Rights
Act.''
   Duke countered, ``You don't eradicate discrimination by putting
in a policy of discrimination. Young people coming up were not part
of past discriminatory policies.''
   Democratic Rep. C.D. Jones warned such a law would be
unconstitutional.
   ``You can camouflage things but racism is racism,'' said Jones,
who is black. ``What we just passed is an attempt to try to set
black people in this state back _ one-third of the population in
this state. You still must understand that we live in the United
States and federal law takes precedence over the Louisiana
Legislature, and thank God for that.''
   Duke left the KKK in 1980, accused of trying to sell a
membership list to a rival faction, and formed the National
Association for the Advancement of White People.
   Elected to the Louisiana House from a nearly all-white district
in 1989, he says his racism and Nazi sympathy were youthful errors.
   Now Duke, 39, is running for U.S. Senate, although the state GOP
has endorsed another candidate.

<HEAD>Gannett Board Approves Share Rights Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gannett Co. Inc. said its board approved a share
rights plan designed to discourage unsolicited takeover attempts.
   John J. Curley, chairman, president and chief executive of
Gannett, said May 21 the rights were not being distributed in
response to any specific effort to acquire control of the company.
``The board is not aware of any such effort,'' he said.
   It comes only a few weeks after Gannett's largest shareholder,
the Gannett Foundation, announced it was putting its holding of 10
percent of Gannett's stock up for sale.
   Douglas McCorkindale, vice chairman and chief financial officer
of Gannett, said in a telephone interview the share rights plan had
nothing to do with the foundation's plans to sell its stock.
   ``We have been considering it for a couple of years,'' he said,
adding that the board felt it would ``an appropriate time to put it
into effect'' because acquisition activity had fallen off in recent
months.
   Gannett, based in Arlington, Va., said its board declared a
dividend of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding
share of Gannett's common stock. The right entitles stockholders to
buy a fraction of a share of a new series of junior preferred stock.
   If any person or group acquired 15 percent or more of Gannett's
common stock, each right would entitle holders to buy a number of
Gannett common shares having a market value of twice the exercise
price. The Gannett board also could convert each right into one
share of common stock.
   The company said the rights would not prevent a takeover but
``should encourage anyone seeking to acquire the company to
negotiate with the board prior to attempting a takeover.''
   Gannett publishes 83 daily newspapers, including USA Today, and
52 non-daily newspapers. It operates 10 television stations, 16
radio stations, Gannett News Services and a leading outdoor
advertising company.

<HEAD>Ad Age Reports `TV Guide' Up for Sale; Murdoch Denies It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rupert Murdoch angrily denied a trade
publication report that he is ``sounding out prospective buyers''
for TV Guide and said he offered $1 million to the publication's
parent if it could prove its story.
   Advertising Age said May 21 that the head of News Corp. Ltd. was
shopping TV Guide around.
   Rance Crain, the editor in chief of Ad Age, said he turned down
the offer ``to bet me $1 million'' because it would have required
revealing the magazine's sources.
   ``We stand by the story completely,'' Crain said in a telephone
interview.
   News Corp. acquired TV Guide as part of a $3 billion buyout of
Triangle Publications Inc. nearly two years ago. That deal also
included Seventeen magazine and the Daily Racing Form.
   The report in Ad Age comes a few weeks after News Corp. agreed
to sell Star magazine, a supermarket tabloid, for $400 million in
cash and securities.
   Murdoch confirmed in a recent interview that he had no plans for
additional major acquisitions over the next few years and would
focus on improving profits at existing operations, which include
magazines, book publishing, newspapers, television stations and the
Fox TV network.
   His company has an estimated $6 billion in debt and has lost
more than $400 million in its effort to launch a satellite-TV
service in Great Britain.
   The Ad Age story said unidentified publishing industry sources
have met with a number of major publishers in recent weeks to gauge
interest in TV Guide, a weekly magazine that the report said ``has
been in an ad page and circulation slump'' since it was acquired in
1988.

<HEAD>Small Weekly Beats Atlanta, Gwinnett Dailies for Legal Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple of cross-county moves by two
large daily newspapers opened the door for a tiny weekly to win the
$500,000 account for Gwinnett County's legal advertising.
   The Gwinnett Home Weekly, with a circulation of about 9,000,
beat out the much larger Gwinnett Daily News and The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. Both papers have daily circulations of more
than 40,000 in the county.
   The daily papers became ineligible for the account because they
recently moved their local operations out of Lawrenceville, the
county seat, officials said in awarding the contract May 24.
   Under state law, a county's official legal organ must be
published in the county seat.
   The Daily News, which had been the legal organ since 1985, moved
its headquarters from Lawrenceville to Duluth earlier this year.
The Journal-Constitution moved its Gwinnett operation to Norcross.

<HEAD>Soviet Newspapers Find Tough Going in U.S. Ad Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet newspapers Izvestia and Pravda are
chasing American advertising pegged to the the upcoming summit
between President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. But
their ad salesmen are finding it's a tough sell.
   U.S. companies, even those already doing business in the Soviet
Union, are taking a go-slow approach to print advertising for a
Russian audience.
   The government-run newspaper Izvestia disclosed plans in April
to publish a pair of special supplements on the United States
during the summit. The Russian-language supplements would be tucked
inside about 2 million copies of the newspaper, which has a total
circulation of 11 million.
   While several U.S. companies and ad agencies have expressed
interest, none had bought space as of May 21, an official said.
   ``American businessmen are perhaps not as aggressive in terms of
looking at the market possibilities in Russia in this way,'' said
Anthony R. Wight, head of Publicitas Inc., in charge of ad sales
for Izvestia.
   Wight said Izvestia has been peddling space to Western
advertisers since January. Nearly all of the buyers so far have
been European.
   Pravda, the official newspaper of the Soviet Communist Party,
sent out notices to dozens of American companies encouraging them
to buy full-page ads during the summit. It claims circulation of
more than 8 million.

<HEAD>Breslin Resumes Column Without Mention of Suspension</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Columnist Jimmy Breslin returned to print
without mentioning his suspension for insulting a Korean-American
reporter and then joking about it on the air.
   In his Newsday column May 23, Breslin wrote about a plumber who
follows construction crews around the city, waiting for them to
accidentally break an underground water pipe so he can fix it.
   The editors of Newsday suspended the Pulitzer Prize-winning
columnist May 9 for two weeks without pay for uttering racial and
sexual slurs against New York Newsday reporter Ji-Yeon Mary Yuh
after she criticized a column he wrote on women's roles.
   Breslin, who said the column in question was intended as humor,
issued an apology, which Newsday executives accepted. But they
suspended him after he called a controversial New York radio
personality, Howard Stern, and joked over the air about the
incident.

   The Soviet newspaper Izvestia and Hearst Corp.
plan to test market a weekly paper in both countries starting on
the Fourth of July.
   American and Soviet journalists will work together on the
newspaper to be jointly edited at Hearst's Washington news bureau,
Hearst announced May 22.

Kiev in the Soviet Union and Washington and other U.S. cities.
   The paper will be called WE-Miy. Miy, pronounced ``mwee,'' is
Russian for ``we.'' In the newspaper's logo, it will be a Cyrillic
character.
   ``Glasnost has opened tremendous opportunities and new
opportunities demand new journalism,'' Vladimir Nadeine, Washington
correspondent for Izvestia said in a statement.
   Hearst said the paper will cover political, economic, social
issues and in both countries and will include fashion, sports, arts

<HEAD>Knight-Ridder VP Sees Bright Future</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EUGENE, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jay Harris, a vice president of
Knight-Ridder Inc., sees a bright future for newspapers that can
adapt to change while maintaining traditional journalistic values.
   Delivering the University of Oregon School of Journalism's
annual Ruhl Lecture on May 22, Harris said four great changes have
swept over the newspaper business: increased competition from other
news media, a drop in readership, major societal changes and ``the
rise of a business imperative.''
   To succeed, newspapers will have to continue their role as the
public's watchdog, with hard-hitting investigative reporting and
aggressive coverage of government at all levels, he said.
   ``But we need to do more,'' Harris said. ``We will need to
publish newspapers that are a pleasure to read and far better
organized. We will need to make our papers helpful to readers as
well as informative, a complement to the full range of activities
and situations they encounter in their daily lives.''
   Newspapers also must reach out to blacks, Hispanics, Asians and
Indians, he said.
   But the trend that poses the greatest threat to the industry is
the tendency by some newspaper owners to allow concerns about
business matters to overwhelm all other considerations, Harris said.
   He said the rise of publicly held newspaper groups has more
often than not brought higher quality news staffs and newspapers.
But, he added, there have been instances ``where the ascendancy of
the business imperative has not been positive, instances in which
papers have been stripped down too far, instances in which the
interests of local communities have been subordinated almost
entirely to the interest of owners, instances in which the high
standards of modern newspaper journalism have been cast aside, all
with the sole purpose of squeezing out ever-greater profits.''

<HEAD>Fired Editor Sues Wall Street Journal for $12.64 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former editor for The Wall Street Journal sued
the newspaper for $12.64 million May 22, claiming he was fired and
his reputation smeared by a false charge of plagiarism.
   Jonathan Kandell, the Journal's assistant foreign editor prior
to his dismissal May 2, also demanded the return of notes and other
documents that he contended the paper's editors had kept, knowing
they would support his position.
   The Journal fired Kandell after accusing him of lifting
uncredited material from another writer's book for a page 1 article
about three private entrepreneurs in Eastern Europe.
   Roger May, a spokesman for Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., owners of the
Journal, said, ``Dow Jones believes the suit is utterly without
merit and the company intends to defend itself vigorously.''
   Kandell quoted Paul Steiger, deputy managing editor of the
Journal, as having said his alleged offense was ``the most serious
transgression to take place at the Journal since the Foster Winans
case.''
   R. Foster Winans was convicted in 1985 of using his position as
a Wall Street Journal columnist to profit from insider stock
trading information. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison, a
$5,000 fine and five years' probation.
   In his federal court lawsuit, Kandell contends he was libeled
and his professional reputation destroyed by the Journal. He
demanded $10 million in punitive damages and $2.64 million in
compensation for ``willful, wanton and reckless disregard of the
truth'' and ``actual malice'' on the paper's part.
   He said the libel was contained in a letter of apology that the
newspaper sent to the author of a book dealing with the same
subject and in a subsequent article in the weekly newspaper Village
Voice about Kandell's case. The Voice was not named as a defendant
in the suit.
   Kandell's article, in the March 30 edition of the Journal,
profiled a Soviet machine tool maker, a Czechoslovak inventor and a
Hungarian banker as examples of individuals succeeding in the
private sector.
   Kandell said he based the story on interviews with the three
individuals in their countries after hearing them speak at a
meeting in New York sponsored last November by the Council on
Foreign Relations.
   He said that at the same meeting, he also learned of a book,
``Communist Entrepreneurs,'' and met the author, John W. Kiser III.
He said he later ``read the book once and put it aside.''

<HEAD>Former Police Chief Charges TV Station With Slander</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Omaha police chief sued television
station KETV for $1.5 million May 21, alleging one of its reporters
slandered him in comments to police officers and reporters in
Illinois.
   KETV's general manager, David Summers, said the suit filed by
Robert Wadman had no merit.
   In a lawsuit filed in state court here, Wadman alleged reporter
Frank Brown told members of a crowd at the Kane County (Ill.)
Courthouse on May 18 that ``Wadman is the subject of an
investigation by a grand jury in Omaha.''
   Some of the information provided by Brown was broadcast later
that day on Chicago television station WLS, the lawsuit said.
   It said Brown's statements, along with discussion of them by
rank-and-file police officers and the WLS broadcast, damaged
Wadman's reputation and his ability to act as police chief in the
Chicago suburb of Aurora, Ill.
   Summers said, ``I don't see anything untruthful that he said.''
   The lawsuit names KETV as the sole defendant, saying Brown was
``acting as an agent and employee'' of the station.
   Brown traveled to Aurora to report on a controversy involving
Wadman's disciplining of a police officer there who had been
indicted on felony charges for allegedly using excessive force
against a person being held in a jail booking area.
   As Omaha's police chief in 1986, Wadman was fired by the
administration of then-Mayor Mike Boyle for refusing to sign
disciplinary orders against three police officials. A court ruling
gave Wadman his job back, but he lost it again last year in an
appeal to the Nebraska Supreme Court.
   He later accepted the job in Aurora.

<HEAD>Woman Loses Effort To Block Report of Her Divorce</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled against a woman who sued a
newspaper in an effort to prohibit it from printing news of her
divorce.
   ``The state of Rhode Island ... has expressly made that
information a matter of public record,'' Superior Court Judge
Richard J. Israel wrote in the decision issued May 21.
   The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a woman using the name Jane
Doe. She was delaying her final divorce decree in hopes it would
not be printed in The Newport Daily News.
   A second woman, calling herself Allison Roe, was allowed to join
the suit earlier this month. The woman said she received obscene
phone calls the day her divorce notice appeared in the paper.
   Thomas W. Kelly, the attorney for the two women, argued that
printing divorce records of private persons violated the state
Privacy Act.
   But Joseph V. Cavanagh Jr., the paper's lawyer, argued that
divorces are considered public information. He said the U.S.
Supreme Court had ruled in favor of newspapers that printed court
information.
   Cavanagh also argued any ban would violate the First Amendment
to the Constitution.
   Israel did not rule on the constitutional issue but rejected
Kelly's privacy argument.

<HEAD>Ohio Supreme Court Orders Police Chief To Pay Legal Fees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cincinnati's police chief must pay $4,365
in lawyer's fees resulting from a television station's legal battle
to obtain records in a police shooting, the Ohio Supreme Court
ruled May 23.
   The court ruled 6-1 that the fees should be awarded because
there was a public benefit in the disclosure of police records in
the shooting of a suspect by a police officer during a scuffle last
Oct. 9.
   Chief Lawrence Whalen had cited executive privilege in
withholding the records but the state's highest court ordered
Whalen on Jan. 10 to turn over the records to WLWT-TV.
   The station had sought a tape recording of radio transmissions
from an open microphone in Officer George Miller's patrol car while
he struggled with Donnie Roberts. Miller said he shot Roberts after
Roberts tried to strangle him.
   In its latest ruling, the Supreme Court said Whalen should pay
the fees to WLWT and its parent company, Multimedia Inc., because
his decision to withhold the records was unreasonable. It also said
Whalen's argument that the station could have sought the records
from his superiors was baseless because Whalen had admitted he had
responsibility for keeping the records.
   The court called Whalen's decision not to release the documents
an ``unreasonable attempt to avoid the clear mandate'' of the state
open records law.

<TEXT>
   Criminal libel charges against the editor
of The Barnwell County Banner were dropped May 25.
   Drew Wilder, editor and publisher of the weekly, had been
charged with two counts of criminal libel after the paper reported
that Hammond Still, principal of Wagener-Salley High School, had
been arrested and charged with assault and battery and disorderly
conduct. The incident occurred in connection with an April 6
domestic dispute at South Carolina State College involving Still's
wife, Rhonda, the newspaper reported.
   Still and his wife each swore out warrants against Wilder.
   The Stills' lawyer, Tim Moore, said no assault charge was ever
filed against Still, but he did acknowledge Still had been charged
with disorderly conduct. That charge was dropped April 20.
   Wilder maintained his paper's stories about Still were accurate,
saying he got the information from records at the Orangeburg County
Jail.
   Solicitor Barbara Morgan said the charges against Wilder were
dropped at the request of the Stills. The charges were dismissed
with prejudice, meaning the Stills cannot take further criminal
action against Wilder in connection with the incident.

   A supermarket tabloid has paid undisclosed
damages to Tom Selleck's father for publishing statements falsely
attributed to him in an 1982 article detailing his son's alleged
``love secrets.''
   The Globe, a Florida-based weekly, published an apology as part

   Television journalist Diane Sawyer has been
subpoenaed to appear at Imelda Marcos' fraud trial to testify about
an interview she did with the former Philippines first lady in 1986.
   In a May 22 letter to U.S. District Judge John Keenan,
prosecutors said they want Sawyer to ``authenticate'' a segment of
her interview that they plan to present as evidence.
   Sawyer conducted the interview while working for the CBS News
show ``60 Minutes.''
   A CBS attorney, Helen Gold, said the network would ask the judge
to quash the subpoena.
   Sawyer is now employed by ABC. A spokeswoman there said Sawyer
had no comment.
   In the segment, Mrs. Marcos denied writing the signature on a
Swiss bank record. The document, which is already in evidence at
the trial, reflects the opening of an account in the name ``Jane
Ryan.''
   Prosecutors claim ``Jane Ryan'' is a fictitious name for Mrs.
Marcos. They said the handwriting on the document has been
identified as Mrs. Marcos'.
   Mrs. Marcos' attorneys are seeking to keep the jury from seeing
the tape or hearing Sawyer's testimony.

   About 30 people marched outside The Pittsburgh
Press on May 19, accusing the news media of bias in covering
abortion issues.
   Some of the marchers said they objected to the use of
``pro-abortion vocabulary'' in news stories.
   ``That is the vocabulary that calls us `anti-abortion' and calls
the pro-choicers what they want to be called, which is
`pro-choice,''' said James Miller.
   Ron Royhab, assistant managing editor-news at the Press, said

<HEAD>When News Is Bad for Business, Press Unskeptical, Critic Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The willingness of the press to accept
unskeptically the word of businesses' critics has turned
``reporters into patsies time and again,'' a Philip Morris
executive says.
   ``Reporters and editors treat the president, the senator, the
congressman, the mayor and companies with great skepticism, which
is as it should be,'' Guy L. Smith IV said May 23. ``But let a
critic of business come along ... and the media turn over their
typewriters to him.''
   Smith, vice president for corporate affairs of Philip Morris
Companies Inc., said the news media often become loyal to one side
in a dispute and ``lazy and uncritical of the side they support.''
   To make his point, Smith attacked news accounts about a
forthcoming Environmental Protection Agency study which sources
have said will report that ``second-hand smoke'' _ inhaled by
non-smokers _ causes more than 3,000 cases of lung cancer annually.
   He said the EPA assessment was based on 23 studies, 18 of which
found no link. The other five, he said, were conducted in Greece,
Japan and China and may be invalid because they did not consider
lifestyle questions, such as the effect of oils or charcoal used in
cooking.
   ``The problem here is what always happens when editors and
reporters take sides,'' Smith said. ``They start running not news
reports but morality plays _ and any fact that does not fit ... is
transformed to fit or slides down the memory hole.
   ``This double-standard journalism is a particularly strong
temptation in reporting on science, where the usual tentativeness,
complexity and ambiguity of scientific discussion simply does not
make a good story.''
   Reporter Lewis Cope of the Star Tribune of Minneapolis,
president-elect of the National Association of Science Writers,
said Smith ``has a right to his opinion, but there is a need to
report contrary views from reputable scientists, particularly on
matters that are so important to people's health.''
   Offering another example, Smith said the press often cites a
figure first published by the American Automobile Association's
Foundation for Traffic Study saying the average child sees 100,000
beer commercials between age 2 and 18. He said a youngster would
have to watch 14 hours of television a day or five or six hours of
sports television to see that many.
   But the press keeps using the figure as established truth,
``never bothering even to devote the two minutes of critical
thought it would take'' to realize its ``preposterous'' nature, he
said.

<HEAD>Officials, Media Victimized by Hoax AIDS Rumor, Prosecutor Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A florist in a rural community who
claimed he was beaten and harassed because people wrongly thought
he had AIDS apparently made up the story, authorities said.
   Kanawha County Prosecutor Bill Forbes said Bill Grealis checked
himself into the psychiatric unit of Thomas Memorial Hospital on
May 24 after being confronted with evidence he was making harassing
telephone calls to himself.
   Que Stephens Sr., head of the state Human Rights Commission,
said Grealis was the target of a sting operation involving 20
members of the attorney general's staff monitoring Grealis' home
and pay telephones. Stephens said Grealis did not know of the sting.
   ``We have been preyed upon by this guy,'' Forbes said. ``There
has been a perpetration of a fraud on all of us who stand here, and
all of the media, too.''
   Forbes said he did not know the reason behind Grealis' behavior.
   Grealis' plight came to the attention of reporters when he
complained he was threatened, beaten, his business boycotted and
his workplace broken into because of a rumor in the Campbell Creaks
community that he had acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Grealis said that business at his flower shop dropped 80 percent
since December and that he nearly went insane.
   He had said he lost weight because of a prostate ailment and
went so far as to post a negative AIDS test result on the shop
window in an attempt to convince his neighbors that he didn't carry
the deadly virus.

<HEAD>Controversy Surrounds Homeless Paper in New York</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While sales of a newspaper sold by the homeless
continue to rise, turmoil on the paper's staff has begun to attract
as much attention as the unique publication itself.
   As many as eight salaried staff members at Street News left
their jobs in mid-May, accusing the paper's editor and publisher,
Hutchinson Persons, of ``erratic and irresponsible behavior.''
   For the paper, where some staff members have worked 16-hour days
and viewed their work more as a mission than a job, it is the
latest in a series of blows.
   Street News began publishing in November with a tiny sales force
of homeless people who gave up begging in the city's subway system
to sell papers that give them 45 cents of the 75-cent-per-copy
price.
   As word spread of the creative way of turning those who were
down on their luck into working people again, the number of sellers
and buyers expanded dramatically. Persons estimates distribution at
300,000 monthly.
   ``It was great. It was happy,'' said Wendy Koltun, who helped
found the paper. ``We were helping so many people.''
   But in January, Koltun quit.
   ``Things started to happen that made me realize that I could not
trust his decision-making or his behavior,'' she said of Persons.
``And I could no longer represent Street News' operational
integrity as something that reflected my views.''
   At one point, an anonymous complaint was made to the state
attorney general's office and an inquiry was begun into its
management and allegations that it had misrepresented itself. The
IRS began reviewing the designation of Street Aid, the newspaper's
parent organization, as a tax-exempt charity.
   Other more established organizations to benefit the homeless
began complaining that Street News and Persons were only providing
the homeless with money, not wider-ranging help.
   Amy Connors, who joined the staff in February and quit several
weeks ago, said Persons frequently fired people abruptly, changed
plans and mistreated the homeless.
   ``Three months at Street News is like three years anywhere else.
I had a job for 12 years and it seems like I worked at Street News
as long,'' she said.
   ``As soon as anyone asked him any questions, he would at first
be extremely evasive and very condescending. They would press him
further and he'd become enraged and very abusive.''
   Persons dismisses the complaints, saying that ``in any company
employees are going to be disgruntled and think they can do a
better job.''
   ``We've lost a lot of employees. Some couldn't keep up,'' he
said. ``I'm pretty demanding to work for. Everybody comes in
saying, `Wow, this is really great.' After a few months, they say,
`Wow, this is really hard.'''

<HEAD>Suburbanites Criticize Newspaper Rack Congestion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of suburbanites says newspaper
racks are making their community unattractive.
   About 50 residents of Boca del Mar complained at May 21 meeting
that the vending machines are ugly and encourage traffic congestion.
   ``There's one, there's two know it, there , and before youare
15,'' said Norman Simon, a member of the Boca del Mar Committee
Against Newsrack Eyesores. ``They're ugly and they fall over.
People are adamant that they present a traffic hazard.''
   But some community association leaders said a ban on racks would
be excessive, suggesting instead that newspapers agree to reduce
the number of racks.
   Ken Feigl, president of the Boca Del Mar Improvement
Association, said the association was searching for aesthetically
pleasing locations in the community of 10,000 homes.
   ``The board feels that newspapers are essential to the American
way of life,'' he said. ``A small group says there are too many
racks, and they object to the damage created by driving onto our
manicuredS. airliners
flying out of the Soviet Union would be purchased with rubles
convertible to dollars.
   A number of U.S. carriers have expressed interest in competing
with Pan Am for the expanded service, including Delta, United,
Alaska Air and Northwest.
   The Soviet decision to begin dismantling the Krasnoyarsk radar
facility would overcome one obstacle in the way of the strategic
arms treaty. Both the Reagan and now the Bush administrations have
said they would not sign a strategic arms reduction treaty until
the giant radar facility is dismantled.
   ``We recently saw signs that this is going on,'' said one
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Reagan administration had contended the installation
violated the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty which imposes
strict limits on radar. After protesting initially, the Soviets
eventually relented and said they would dismantle the facility.
   The two countries' arms control negotiating teams met in three
sessions Sunday totaling 6{ hours and then for 2} hours on Monday.
   The U.S. delegation was headed by Undersecretary Reginald
Bartholomew and the Soviet group by Deputy Prime Minister Viktor P.
Karpov, an experienced arms control negotiator.
   Gorbachev sent the negotiators initially to take up a half-dozen
unsettled strategic weapons reduction issues.
   But a U.S. official, declining to be identified, said the talks
also dealt with cuts in U.S. and Soviet troops, tanks, artillery
and airplanes in Europe.

<HEAD>Administration Considers Curtailing Radio Free Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the demise of communism in Eastern
Europe, the White House is wondering why the United States should
continue broadcasting radio programs to those countries.
   A review by the National Security Council recommends that the
broadcasts by Radio Free Europe be reduced, accordin to a source
familiar with the preliminary report scheduled for completion May
30.
   Radio Free Europe, based in Munich, West Germany, broadcast to
Eastern Europe throughout the Cold War and was much reviled and
jammed by the communist governments in those countries.
   Although the changes in Eastern Europe have given Radio Free
Europe unprecedented reporting and broadcasting opportunities, they
also have called into question the need for its existence.
   The network announced May 24 that it was opening offices in
Prague and Warsaw at the invitation of the leaders of
Czechoslovakia and Poland. Czech President Vaclav Havel attended
the bureau opening in Prague and praised Radio Free Europe for its
programs that contributed to the fall of communism.
   But the NSC review is expected to call for Radio Free Europe to
eventually cut its programs to Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland,
the source said. The money saved would be channeled into other
foreign broadcasting services, possibly the Voice of America or the
U.S. Information Agency's television network, said the source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Board for International Broadcasting, which controls Radio
Free Europe, argues that Eastern Europe needs Radio Free Europe
during its transition to democracy, that its audiences are far
greater than those of VOA, and that its functions are completely
different.

<HEAD>Foreign Press Group Criticizes Israeli Army Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Press Association on May 28
protested Israeli restrictions on coverage of recent rioting in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Conny Mus, chairman of the group which represents more than 200
foreign journalists in Israel, said army curfews and closure orders
had ``systematically prevented'' the foreign press from covering
events except in the company of army escorts.
   In such cases, the statement said, foreign press pool reporters
were barred from talking with either Palestinians or soldiers
involved in the events.
   ``This has left us unable to fulfill our role as impartial
observers,'' Mus said in the statement.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last week that
Israel did not need United Nations observers to safeguard the Arab
population in occupied areas as proposed by the Palestine
Liberation Organization. He said ``there is already an abundance of
observers'' in the form of foreign journalists, visiting academics
and international aid workers.
   Responding to the Foreign Press Association, an army spokesman
said the army was gradually lifting curfews and other restrictions
but was justified under international law in taking such action to
contain unrest and prevent incitement. The spokesman also said the
army made a special effort to enable journalists to cover events
even in areas where curfews had been imposed.

<HEAD>Organizers Call Off Mission for China Radio Ship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Organizers of the Goddess of Democracy
radio ship canceled plans to beam pro-democracy messages to China
because of setbacks in obtaining crucial broadcasting equipment.
   ``It was a difficult decision. We are forced to abandon the
broadcasting project,'' said Xu Tianfang, deputy secretary of the A
Boat for China Association, one of the main organizers.
   He said May 24 that organizers would sell the ship at auction
and distribute tapes of the planned broadcasts to radio stations
that can help transmit the messages to China.
   The organizers had hoped to begin broadcasting to China before
June 4, the first anniversary of China's crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement. The ship takes its name from a statue built
by students in Tiananmen Square during the demonstrations.
   Organizers accused Taiwan's government of scuttling the project
by refusing to allow Chinese to board the ship to make broadcasts
and by holding up the transmitter. Authorities here also had said
they would not allow the ship to return for supplies once it left
port.
   The Taiwan government said it supported efforts to foster
democracy in China but could not support the planned broadcasts,
which it said would violate international agreements on
broadcasting.
   The 1,200-ton ship was sponsored by the French magazine Actuel
and other publishing organizations and backed by the Paris-based
Federation for a Democratic China, a dissident Chinese group.

   About half of the 10 Chinese journalists who
studied at the University of Hawaii this year may remain in the
United States for further studies, says the director of the
fellowship program in which they studied.
   John Luter, chairman of the school's journalism department, said
the Chinese journalists planned to remain in the United States to
work on master's degrees.
   Newspaper reports indicate China is being more restrictive in
allowing people out of the country to study, Luter said. If the
journalists go back, they will have to remain in the country for at
least five years before they can go out again, he said.
   Last year, three of the students in the 10-month Parvin
Fellowship Program remained in Hawaii. Luter said that before then,
only two out of 78 students who had participated in the program had
ever stayed for further study.
   ``The purpose of the program is not to have students stay in the
United States, but to have them go home and help their media and
their country,'' he said.
   ``I'm trying very hard to get them to go home,'' he said.

<HEAD>Hunter Thompson Ordered To Stand Trial on Drug Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASPEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Gonzo'' journalist Hunter Thompson has
been ordered to stand trial on drug and explosives charges.
   Mesa County District Judge Charles Buss ruled May 22 that there
was sufficient evidence to try the author on five felony charges of
possessing drugs and possessing and storing explosives illegally.
   Trial was tentatively set for June 25.
   The judge threw out charges of cocaine use in the case, which
stemmed from complaints by a woman who also alleged Thompson
assaulted her in his home in February. Misdemeanor assault charges
weren't considered at the hearing.
   The woman's complaint to authorities led to a two-day search of
Thompson's house that turned up LSD, cocaine, Diazapam, marijuana
and four sticks of dynamite.
   Hal Haddon, Thompson's lawyer, argued the drugs couldn't be
proven to belong to Thompson because he has so many visitors. He
said the explosives didn't belong to Thompson, but to someone who
used them to blow up beaver dams, stumps and other obstacles to
irrigation water.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors are investigating allegations that a
television station staged a fight between two pit bull terriers for
a report on illegal dog fights.
   The station said news staffers attended an illegal pit bull
fight but defended the action as ``legitimate news-gathering
activities'' and denied the fight was staged for its cameras.
   KCNC General Manager Roger Ogden said May 25 that station
employees attended such a fight in September, but they didn't
realize at the time it was illegal.
   He also said the videotape used in reporter Wendy Bergen's
four-part series on illegal pit bull fights came from a
confidential source and was not made by KCNC staffers.
   ``We have been told, and we believe, that this video was not the
same fight attended by KCNC employees in September,'' the station
said in a statement.
   The station and police began an investigation after allegations
were made by anonymous sources that KCNC staged a fight between two
dogs for Bergen's series. The sources also told competing news
organizations the station paid for the fight.
   Police said the fight featured in Bergen's report, which aired
April 30-May 2, occurred in Sheridan, a Denver suburb.
   Staging a dogfight or even attending one is a felony in
Colorado, punishable by up to four years in prison and $1,000 fine.
   Police investigations into the incident were completed last
week. District attorneys in Arapahoe and Jefferson counties, where
the fights reportedly occurred, are looking into who might have
been involved.
   No charges have been filed against station employees or dog
owners. KCNC news director Marv Rockford said no disciplinary
action had been taken against any KCNC employee.

<HEAD>Women Reporters Gain Network Visibility Slowly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Female correspondents increased their
visibility last year on the major network evening news programs,
but male reporters still dominated the airwaves, a study says.
   ``There is an assumption in American society that women are
upwardly mobile in the work place, but that's not the case in
network television news,'' said Joe S. Foote, chairman of the
radio-television department at Southern Illinois University.
   Just three women were in the top 10 out of 186 reporters ranked
on ABC, CBS or NBC, according to the Network Correspondent
Visibility Study. The study does not include news anchors.
   The reporters were ranked by the number of stories they had on
the air during 1989. They had to have filed at least five stories
during the year to be listed in the study.
   ``There were more women at the top than ever before. That's
unprecedented,'' Foote said May 23. ``But there were 50 percent
fewer women overall.''
   Overall, just eight women reporters were in the top 100,
compared with 15 in 1988. They were led by CBS's Lesley Stahl at
No. 3, NBC's Andrea Mitchell at No. 4 and CBS's Rita Braver at No.
8.
   Stahl, who covers the White House, received the highest ranking
of any woman ever in Foote's seven-year study. She was preceded
this year by NBC's John Cochran and ABC's Brit Hume.
   The study also found no blacks among the top 50 correspondents
and just two Hispanic correspondents: CBS's Juan Vasquez at No. 16

   The petition calls for the FCC to refuse renewal of operating

allegedly poor minority hiring records. It was filed by the NAACP's
Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma state conferences.
   ``We've been completely in compliance with the FCC

   The station has gone beyond FCC regulations on equal employment
practices by specifically contacting minority employment programs
in search of employees, Fearnow said.
   ``We're looking for a qualified person to do the job that needs
to be done, and it doesn't matter what color that person is,''
Fearnow said.
   ``We've had a hard time hiring (minorities),'' he said. ``We

   The NAACP petition alleges the stations have employed only token

1984, though both Congress and the FCC currently are considering
steps to reimpose some regulation.
   ``You cannot expect government to continue sanctioning, indeed,
protecting and promoting cable as a sole-source provider of video
services while at the same time forgoing the regulation that
historically has been placed on monopoly operations,'' Sikes said.
``The American people, in short, will not tolerate an unregulated
monopoly indefinitely.''
   Though cable TV has soared in popularity over the last decade _
it is now received in 57.1 percent of all U.S. homes with
television _ the industry has been beset recently by complaints
from consumers about poor service and rising rates.
   The FCC is scheduled to take up cable issues at its July 26

<HEAD>Colombians Cited for Courage in Covering Drug Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colmbian journalists under siege for
covering the drug trade in their nation have won the 1990 Louis M.
Lyons Award for Conscience and Integrity in Journalism
   Harvard University's Nieman Foundation said in announcing the
award May 25 that it cites Colombian reporters, living and dead,
for their work on the drug industry and its effect on that country.
   Luis Gabriel Cano, president of the newspaper El Espectador of
Bogota, will accept the award in the fall. The paper has lost
staffers to death or exile and had its newsroom bombed in September.
   The Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based human
rights group, has documented the killing of 20 reporters and
editors in Colombia by agents of drug lords in the last five years.
But Cano and other Colombian journalists estimate 50 news
organization employees, including business employees, have been
killed.
   Among those murdered was Cano's brother, Guillermo, who was El
Espectador's editor in chief and a columnist.
   A committee of the 21 members of the Nieman Fellow Class of 1990
chose the Colombians for the award, which is named in honor of
former Nieman curator Louis M. Lyons.
   Earlier in the week, Cano's brother Fernando, who is editor of
El Espectador, was one of 11 foreign journalists named Nieman
Fellows for the coming academic year at Harvard.
   American fellows were announced previously.
   In addition to Cano, the foreign fellows are:
   Rui Araujo, a producer at Portuguese Broadcasting Corp.; Kabral
Blay-Amihere, a freelance journalist formerly with The Independent
of Ghana.; Raj Chengappa, a special correspondent for India Today.;
Maria Dunin-Wasowicz, deputy economic editor of Przeglad Tygodniowy
of Poland and Tony Bluemenor, assistant editor of This Week of
Lagos, Nigeria.
   Also, Nanise Fifita, senior journalist with the Tonga
Broadcasting Commission; Joseph Latakgomo, senior assistant editor
of The Star in Johannesburg, South Africa; Jennifer Lewington,
Washington bureau chief of The Globe and Mail of Toronto; Luis
Alberto Moreno, director of TV Hoy in Colombia and Vladimir
Vessenski, special correspondent for Literary Gazette of the Soviet
Union.

   Business journalists from The Associated Press,
The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post were among those
honored with prizes for excellence in two contests.
   Winners were announced May 21 for both the John Hancock and
Gerald Loeb awards for 1990. Both contests honor work that furthers
public understanding of business issues.
   The prize-winning work ranged from the savings and loan scandal
to personal finance to the workings of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   Heading the list of seven Hancock winners was AP writer Vivian
Marino, winner in the syndicated and news service category for a
series on people and their finances. The stories covered topics
ranging from selling a home to filing for personal bankruptcy. It
was the third consecutive Hancock award and the 10th overall for
the AP in the 23-year history of the contest.
   Also winning Hancocks were:
   _Dana Rubin of Texas Monthly magazine, in the general-interest
magazine category, for a story exploring the collapse of a small
rural town's uninsured bank.
   _Johnnie L. Roberts of The Wall Street Journal, in the financial
newspaper or magazine category, for articles on the reliability of
Dun &amp; Bradstreet credit reports.

examining the regulation of insurance in Wyoming.
   _Alex Beam of The Boston Globe, in the financial columnist
category, for columns analyzing topics such as the decline of
Massachusetts' Route 128 technology belt and the troubles of Wang
Laboratories.
   Winners in each category receive $5,000 cash.
   Leading the Loeb winners in the large newspaper category
(circulation over 400,000) were David Vise and Steve Coll of The
Washington Post for ``The Man From Wall Street: John Shad's Reign
at the SEC.'' Earlier this year, Vise and Coll also won a Pulitzer
Prize for their reporting on the SEC.
   Other Loeb winners were:
   _Jerry Kammer, Andy Hall and a team from The Arizona Republic of
Phoenix, in the medium-size newspaper category (circulation over
150,000), for coverage of the collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.
   _Gary Belsky and Phyllis Furman of Crain's New York Business, in
the small newspapers category (circulation under 150,000), for a
report on the rise and fall of the founder of the Crazy Eddie chain.
   _Peter Brimelow and Leslie Spencer of Forbes, in the magazine
category, for a story on the best paid lawyers.
   _L. Gordon Crovitz of The Wall Street Journal, in the commentary
category, for columns on alleged prosecutorial abuses of the

   The United States and the Soviet Union enter
this week's summit with renewed momentum toward clinching a treaty
that for the first time would require each side to reduce the
number of long-range nuclear weapons.
   While a treaty won't be ready for formal agreement when
President Bush begins four days of meetings with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Thursday, the two men are expected to issue
a joint statement this weekend declaring the main provisions of the
pact to be settled. The details, on the other hand, could be months
away.
   Bush and Gorbachev are expected to agree to drastically reduce
their stockpiles of chemical weapons and to end production of those
weapons. In addition, they are expected to call for ratification of
two existing pacts limiting nuclear tests. U.S. and Soviet
officials met during the weekend in an effort to settle arms
control issues.
   The administration has said Bush also will press Gorbachev for a
commitment to speed up NATO-Warsaw Pact negotiations to reduce
tanks, troops and other conventional armaments in Europe. Progress
in these talks has slowed recently.

   A half-dozen accordions stand on Lawrence
``Shine'' Mouton's kitchen table, the result of hundreds of hours
of work and decades of experience.
   ``My daddy was a musician _ Amadia Breaux. He composed `Jolie
Blonde.' I tried to learn to play ... but didn't learn to play as
well as he did,'' said Mouton, 63. ``I said if I couldn't play, I'd
learn to make 'em.''
   Mouton's name is now as well known among Cajun musicians as his
stepfather's. His accordions are played by such performers as the
popular ``Zydecajun'' musician Wayne Toups, and Jimmy Basile of
Cajun Tradition, the Mamou group nominated for a Grammy award this
year.
   As Cajun music and its spinoffs have become more popular, so has
Mouton's craft. About 45 people now make the little German-style
squeeze boxes, most of them in little backyard sheds.
   ``I figured I wasn't any dumber than the next fellow. I figured
if he could make it, I could make it too,'' said John Elton Doucet,
whose workshop is in his grocery store. ``The first one wasn't too,
too good. But then the second one was good.''
   Doucet makes six to 10 accordions a year. It's painstaking work.
The flat metal reeds and the bellows are imported from Italy, but
everything else is made by hand.
   Or at least adapted. For instance, many people make the big
silver buttons on the left end of the accordion from chrome-plated
chair glides. They snip off the little prongs, solder a wood screw
onto the back and fill in the curve with lead.
   ``You drill a hole, and it's all threaded and ready to go,''
said Larry Miller, who makes accordions only for his family but
makes and sells Cajun triangles, spoons set in wooden blocks so
they're easy to use as a rhythm instrument and the
over-the-shoulder style metal washboards used by Zydeco bands.
   The four wooden stops used to close off the four sets of
accordion reeds are made from cabinetwork spindles. And tiny coiled
screws inside the accordion were made to put tension on stereo
tuning knobs.
   Some people paint their accordions, others varnish them to show
off fine-grained woods. The long curved half-dowels which open or
close the reeds often are covered with gold Mylar tape, which gives
even more glitter than the once traditional gold paint and is a lot
easier to apply.
   Miller said he began learning to play the accordion because of a
lecture from Cajun music great Dewey Balfa, after an assembly at
the school where Miller was principal. Miller told Balfa that his
father had made triangles and played accordion, but none of his
brothers or he had kept it up.
   ``He said, `If you're concerned about it dying in your family,
it'll probably be your fault _ you were the one that broke the
chain,''' recounted Miller. ``It hit me like a ton of bricks. Three
days later, I went and bought an accordion and commenced to
learning.''
   About seven years later, he started thinking about making the
instruments. He was influenced by stories he had heard about Mouton
and a few other men who had loved the instrument so much that,
after repairing and re-repairing German instruments made before
World War II, they started making their own.
   Strictly speaking, the Cajun accordion is a melodeon or diatonic
accordion _ a very different instrument from the big piano
accordion popular shortly after the turn of the century.
   For one thing, the Cajun accordion is much smaller. It's about
11 inches high and six inches deep, and will squeeze down to 14
inches across. It weighs about eight pounds _ less than a third the
weight of its big cousin.
   It's held on with a strap around the back of the left hand and a
smaller strap for the right-hand thumb, and played like a
hand-driven harmonica. Each of the 10 right-hand buttons gives two
notes: one when the accordion is squeezed, the other when it's
pulled out.
   The 28-pound piano accordion can't be held up without heavy
padded shoulder straps. Its two-octave keyboard is twice as long as
the Cajun accordion's little row of buttons; each key always plays
the same note.
   Since it does have all 12 notes of the chromatic scale, it can
play in any while the Cajun accordion is limited to four _ if a
player is particularly adept _ and plays every note of the scale
only in one.
   However, Cajun accordion makers say that their instrument can
overpower the bigger one, because it has four sets of melody reeds.
   German accordions began showing up in Cajun country around the
1890s, and quickly upstaged the quieter fiddle as lead instrument.
World War II stopped imports, and the factories were destroyed or
converted to other uses.
   Factories resumed making accordions later, but the style popular
in Louisiana _ four sets of reeds controlled by one set of buttons
_ wasn't used much elsehwere.
   Mouton, Charlie Ortego and Sidney Brown and Marc Savoy are
generally considered the pioneers of modern-day accordion building.
   Mouton began making accordions in 1961, opening up his father's
old German-made Sterling accordion and using it as a reference.
   In 1970, heart trouble forced him to choose between a transfer
and retirement from work as a civil engineer for Conoco. His hobby
became his full-time job.
   ``Not to say a living. I don't make that much money making
accordions, because the cost of reeds and bellows is so high,'' he
said.
   Those two parts are ordered from Italy and cost hundreds of
dollars. Reed makers don't give any discounts, Miller said, but he
and about 25 other accordion makers recently began ordering bellows
together.
   ``I remember when you could buy reeds for $5 a set,'' said
Mouton. Now, the cheapest reeds are $90, and bellows start at $150
_ and those are for a brand scorned as vastly inferior to those
made in Italy.
   Importing presents other problems. ``I ordered some reeds Oct.
19, 1989. They have my money. I still don't have the reeds,'' said
Mouton.
   Mouton still works in a little backyard shed, though his heart
problems have cut back to six or seven hours a day and about 20
accordions a year. A friend has begun cutting out the wooden parts
for him to put together.
   Photographs of his father and his wife, Betty, stand on a shelf
over his workbench. On the walls are a plaque naming Breaux to the
Cajun Musicians Hall of Fame in 1984, musicians' signed promotion
photographs, and several Wayne Toups posters, one of them
inscribed, ``To Mr. Shine _ thanks for being a special friend.''
   Mouton opens a corner cabinet.
   ``This is my daddy's old accordion. He bought it in 1918 for
$7.50. I don't know what it would cost today. But I turned down
$2,500 for it.''

   Pia Zadora, tired of fighting her image as a
cinema sex tart, was ready to call it quits five years ago.
Finally, she returned to her musical roots.
   The result was ``Pia and Phil,'' an album of nightclub standards
backed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra.
   Critics, who had berated Zadora for everything from her movies
to her marriage to multimillionaire Meshulam Riklis, suddenly
remembered her musical background.
   ``It was really a big victory for me emotionally and otherwise.
That was my last-ditch effort, my last bag of tricks. Thank God, it
(singing) was something I had done all my life,'' Zadora said in a
telephone interview from her Los Angeles home.
   In the background, her children _ Kady, 5, and Kristofer, 3 _
could be heard playing in the bathtub. Zadora, 34, said she took an
18-month break from touring so she could be with them.
   During that time, she recorded her new album, ``Pia Z.''
However, she won't perform any of the songs from that LP at her
concerts with the Phoenix Symphony Orchestra on June 1-2 because
the orchestra did not have enough time to learn the new music. She
goes to Atlantic City, N.J., for a short stint following her
Phoenix appearances.
   Zadora, a child of a violinist, was 6 when she appeared in the
Broadway production of ``Midgie Purvis.'' After several other
musicals, she attended the Juilliard School of Music in New York.
   Zadora jumped into films with ``Butterfly'' in 1981, earning a
Golden Globe for best new actress. But in 1982, her career took a
turn for the worse with the release of ``Lonely Lady,'' a critical
and box-office flop.
   ``I must have been stupid,'' Zadora said. ``It was something
that was offered to me. It was a Universal picture, and there were
a couple of reasons I liked it. It was a serious role about a
writer. But I had to live with it. I had to live with it when it
was a `Movie of the Week' on television. The week it was on I went
out of the country and wouldn't return my phone calls.''
   Zadora also released a few dance-oriented, pop-rock albums that
flopped in the United States in the early '80s. She scored a
European hit with Jermaine Jackson on ``When the Rain Begins to
Fall,'' but she refers to her early musical releases as novelty
records.
   ``I really was in a tough position,'' she said. ``I got caught
in one mousy project after another _ from `Lonely Lady' to all
those silly records.''
   But Zadora rebounded with ``Pia and Phil'' and then ``I Am What
I Am.'' The albums followed the path paved by Linda Ronstadt in
1983 with her classics-filled ``What's New'' album.
   Zadora's orchestrally backed works included such tested songs as
``It Had to Be You'' and ``Smile.''
   ``Pia Z,'' released in February, is more pop-oriented. It was
produced by Grammy winner Narada Michael Walden, who has worked
with Whitney Houston and Barbra Streisand.
   Zadora said she is apprehensive about returning to the screen or
stage and feels her Golden Globe in ``Butterfly'' has been
tarnished by critics who said her husband bought the trophy by
wining and dining voters.
   Being married to a millionaire sometimes makes it hard for
people to believe she is a legitimate artist, Zadora said.
   ``Certain people don't think I'm serious,'' she said. ``They say
why should she bother to do it with all that wealth. Those people
don't understand that it doesn't matter how much luxury or wealth
you have, you still have to be productive.''

<HEAD>Golden Triangle Kingpin Little Affected by U.S. Indictment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The heroin business has rarely been
better for Chang Chi-Fu, alias Khun Sa, who seems more concerned
about the rival Wa tribe than a U.S. government indictment.
   The United States has branded Chang the ``Prince of Death'' and
the billion-dollar drug kingpin of the Golden Triangle.
   It has charged him with importing or trying to import more than
3,500 pounds of heroin into New York between September 1986 and
February 1988, and has threatened to ``go after him if he can be
located.''
   Sources who were with Khun Sa when he learned of the indictment,
announced March 15 in Washington, described the chain-smoking
warlord as angry but not particularly worried.
   He has not, for example, made noticeable changes in his
operations, and there is no indication the flow of heroin from his
area of control in Burma has decreased.
   The United States did manage to arrest four members of his drug
ring in Hong Kong on May 20. They are to be tried in New York on
charges of smuggling 46 pounds of heroin into the United States on
May 9.
   One of them, Sai Yeung Ng, was described as a brother-in-law of
Khun Sa. A federal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn identified the others as Dun-Shun Yeung, Wirote Tankirdkit
and Yu-Shing Lam.
   A warrant is out in Thailand for the arrest of Sze-Wah Yeung,
another defendant in the case.
   The United States has been vague about its plans to seize Khun
Sa, but has ruled out large-scale military action. Analysts note
that the jungle and mountain terrain would make military operations
difficult and costly.
   Thai officials say there has been no substantial pressure on
them from Washington to move against Khun Sa.
   Burma is unlikely to cooperate, given Washington's denunciation
of the military junta that seized power after brutally crushing a
pro-democracy uprising in 1988. Washington stopped its
anti-narcotics aid program to Rangoon in protest.
   Khun Sa now is engaged in one of the perennial conflicts of the
Triangle, the rugged, largely lawless territory where the borders
of Burma, Laos and Thailand converge.
   This time, Khun Sa's army is trying to stop the potentially
powerful Wa tribe from muscling in on his territory.
   The Wa, one of Burma's multitude of ethnic minorities, broke
away from the outlawed Burma Communist Party, which had emerged as
a major narcotics producer and trafficker in the 1980s.
   Khun Sa has general control of areas near the Thai frontier,
which allows opium transported from deeper inside Burma to be
processed into heroin at border refineries.
   From these border refineries, the heroin is smuggled through
Thailand to the United States, Australia, Western Europe and Asian
points.
   According to official U.S. estimates, the Triangle's opium crop
in the 1988-89 growing season amounted to 2,600 tons, about 85
percent of it from Burma. A similar amount is expected this year.
   Washington has focused on the drug deluge from Latin America and
the so-called Golden Crescent of Pakistan and Afghanistan, which
had supplied much of the heroin to U.S. addicts.
   At least 40 percent to 50 percent of heroin imported into the
United States now originates in the Triangle, much of it bearing
Khun Sa's imprint.
   Some knowledgeable observers speculate the U.S. indictment was
not so much a prelude to direct action against Khun Sa as a message
to Thailand and Burma.
   Melvyn Levitsky, the top State Department narcotics official,
has criticized corruption in Thailand, which allows drugs to cross
the country in vast quantities, and Burmese government connections
with drug warlords.
   Khun Sa, believed to have been born in 1932, emerged as a
narcotics trader in the 1960s. He claims to be a freedom fighter
for Burma's Shan minority who must use narcotics to finance his
rebellion.
   On several occasions, he has offered to sell the opium crop to
the United States, and keep it off the illicit market.
   He has survived numerous battles and five years in prison. In
1982, he was driven out of his Thai stronghold, complete with
swimming pool and plush quarters, and into Burma.
   The Thais have a $19,000 reward on his head, but his links with
Thailand remain.
   He buys weapons on the Thai black market for his army of 4,000
to 10,000 men. His aides openly operate businesses in tungsten,
jade and timber across northern Thailand, and he is known to have
close ties to many provincial officials.
   Thai narcotics sources acknowledge privately that corruption
among police, army and government officials facilitates the
trafficking.
   Maj. Gen. Chavalit Yodmani, who heads the Office of the
Narcotics Control Board, said the key to eradicating drugs in the
Triangle is solving Burma's ethnic minority problems.
   ``Khun Sa is just one person,'' Chavalit said in an interview.
``You can indict twenty Khun Sas, but another one will simply
spring up to take their place.''

   The huge production costs and star salaries
of the summer films have aroused fears that the film industry is
headed down the same road as America's savings and loans.
   Don't worry, advise the makers of the $50 million ``Total
Recall,'' which is set for release in 2,000 U.S. theaters tdoay.
   Says Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose salary was reportedly $10
million: ``As long as you can bring the money back, that's the key
thing. In Hollywood, if someone would pay me $100 million in salary
and they would get back $400 million, they would do it with
pleasure. Wouldn't you? I would.
   ``The numbers don't matter. The only thing that matters is: Can
you return this money twice or three times over? Sometimes studios
make a movie for $5 million, then they put $10 million in for
promotion and they lose it all, because it's a bad picture. This is
how studios ... eventually ... go bankrupt.''
   Adds director Paul Verhoeven: ``We made it pretty cheap by going
to Mexico City. Shooting in Los Angeles, I'm sure that the movie
would have cost $70 million or something like that. We started (the
budget) at $43 million, and I think I went over 15 percent. So it's
probably up to $50 million. I always go over 15 percent, even in
Europe, where I made films for half a million.
   ``I always seem to go over a bit more than the producers want to
give. But it's all on the screen. It's not something that fell in
the water or disappeared into somebody's pocket. It's all there.
   ``I don't think you feel the (fiscal) responsibility as a
director. You know that you can't make it for $5 million or even
$40 million. The decision is economic. The producers must decide:
Can we do this movie with all the special effects and by adding
Arnold Schwarzenegger make our money back? If that possibility
exists, they go for it.
   ``A company like Carolco makes a lot of pre-sales. With a name
like Arnold's and my name, which is pretty well known in Europe,
they can say, `Look what we have: the director of `Robocop' and
Arnold Schwarzenegger, can we please sell this movie to you?' So
they get a lot of money already from the pre-sales. Then they can
say, `We can do it.'''
   ``Total Recall'' has been in the works for 10 years, originating
in a short story by Phillip K. Dick, ``We Can Remember It for You
Wholesale.'' Dino De Laurentiis developed the script, which
intrigued Schwarzenegger in the mid-1980s.
   ``It was the best script I had read in years,'' he recalls.
``When I picked up the script the first time, I couldn't put it
down. I read it all the way through, then I read it again. ... The
whole business of memory being erased and another memory implanted
was fascinating.''
   Set in the year 2084, ``Total Recall'' depicts Schwarzenegger as
an Earth laborer who enrolls for a memory-implant vacation and soon
finds himself enmeshed in a civil war on Mars. De Laurentiis was
unable to find a director for the film and sold the project to the
enterprising Carolco, maker of the ``Rambo'' films. Schwarzenegger
agreed to the choice of Verhoeven as director: ``He has the right
mentality for it, the discipline, the know-how.''
   The Martian world was created on the stages of Churubusco stdios
in Mexico City with the designs of William Sandell. Included is the
tawdry red-light district of Venusville with its glaring neon and
an occasional touch of whimsy, such as a Jack-in-the-Box sign.
Mexico City itself provided the locations for Earth 100 years from
now.
   ``We used the Mexican style called `new brutalism' with all the
concrete stuff, very threatening, with little windows,
Aztec-style,'' said Dutch-born Verhoeven.
   ``There will be new things in the 2080s, but there will be
things that you can compare with today. Especially when you come
from Europe, where in every city you can see buildings that are
four-, five-, 600-years old. So there is always a combination of
the old and new.
   ``Generally I don't think the world changes that much. It will
be a bit larger, the style will change a little bit. Buildings of
Egypt 4,000 years ago are not much different from what you see
today. People still need a roof if it's raining.''

   It's mid-August. You're too hot to go out.
Grab a glass of something cool, park in front of the tube and
consider the choices:
   A third repeat of ``I Married Dora.'' The second showing of that
fabulous ``Manimal'' episode in which the lead character turns into
a tiger. Or, wait, hold onto your sun visor, what about the fourth
special encore presentation of that ``Moonlighting'' episode where
Maddie sleeps with Mark Harmon?
   There's been a cure for the summertime rerun blues. It's called
flipping the dial to a network where there are myriad first-run
programs to chose from. And that means not flipping to ABC, CBS or
NBC.
   It took the Big Three a couple of years to swallow this little
pill. It went down only after Fox Broadcasting Co. stole
significant numbers of viewers last year while the big boys over at
the mondo-networks took their usual summer naps.
   The alternative Fox network, not asleep at the wheel, has taken
to calling last year's coup ``The Summer of Opportunity.''
   This year, they plan to maintain year-round original
programming. Two new shows have been announced for the summer, as
well as more fresh episodes and specials of shows such as ``Cops,''
``America's Most Wanted'' and the critically acclaimed ``In Living
Color.''
   Cable networks such as Home Box Office like to take credit, too,
for increasing their viewership by running original programming
during the summer.
   ``The networks are definitely reacting to cable television,''
said HBO spokesman Richard Licata. ``Cable is definitely eroding
their (ratings) shares.''
   The sleeping giants have stirred, and this summer ABC, CBS and
NBC are pumping more money into summer programming than ever before.
   But it's not a whole lot. And even though the Big Three are
making a big deal out of their summer programming, with few
exceptions, it's still pretty meager fare.
   ABC will show unseen episodes of the recently canceled
``Brewster Place,'' starring Oprah Winfrey, and ``Capital News,''
starring Lloyd Bridges. Its few new summer shows include ``New
Attitude,'' about a beauty salon, and the game shows ``Super
Jeopardy!'' and ``Monopoly.''
   Rather than produce a large slate of fresh shows, ABC instead
has spent ``between $10 and $20 million increasing episode orders
of existing shows,'' said network spokesman Jim Brochu.
   Over at the No. 1 peacock network, which barely held on to its
top-rated status during May sweeps, NBC programming gurus have some
interesting ideas for summer.
   Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff announced this week
that repeats of ``Quantum Leap,'' one of his favorite shows, would
be shown at 10 p.m. EDT for five consecutive nights beginning June
25. New programs include ``Singer and Sons'' starring Esther Rolle
and ``The Seinfeld Chronicles'' starring comedian Jerry Seinfeld.
   ``Because there are so many choices, no longer can you just
simply go away and not come back until the fall,'' said NBC
spokeswoman Sue Binford. ``Putting that into practice is very, very
tough. We're not going to get there completely this summer.''
   At bottom-rated CBS, executives have little to say about the
summer season. They're too busy trying to figure out their fall
schedule and how to get out of last place.
   But the battered eye is the only broacast network to have an
executive in charge of nothing but summer programs. So far, CBS has
announced three new programs for the hot months to come.
   One is ``War Room,'' about White House speech writers. Another
is ``Northern Exposure,'' about a New York doctor forced to work in
Alaska to pay off his medical education. In ``Manhattan Nights,''
which still is in production, summer viewers will peek at the lives
of residents in a fictional New York apartment building.
   ``By having original programming on in the summer, we're trying
to attract viewers back to CBS,'' said Mike Eisenberg, network vice
president of research. ``We're trying to reduce viewer erosion.''
   It is a simple fact that less people watch television in the
summer. According to Eisenberg, the number of prime time viewers in
July 1989 was 18 percent less than in January of the same year.
   There are several reasons: The weather is nicer and people take
vacations.
   Might it also be that summer TV was lousy to begin with?
   Don't run to the lodge without reservations just yet, but as the
networks pay more attention to hot weather programming, could an
August sweeps period be far behind?

<TEXT>
   The diehard Karen rebels have been
squeezed into shrinking frontier enclaves and may be down to the
last battles of their 41-year-old fight for autonomy.
   It has been a long, hard march for one of Burma's many ethnic
minorities, most of it backward. At the beginning, in the late
1940s, Karen troops swept through Burma's major cities and even
penetrated to the outskirts of Rangoon, the capital.
   In the past two years, the army has overrun most of the Karen
bases along the Thai border and sent 28,000 refugees fleeing across
the frontier.
   Thailand, eager to exploit Burma's rich forests, has struck
deals with the government at the expense of the rebels. Hundreds of
fighters have died on both sides in fierce jungle combat, sometimes
hand-to-hand.
   The opposition won the Burmese national elections last weekend,
but it is not certain how that will affect the Karen war or when
the military government will relinquish power.
   Among the last Karen strongholds is the border town of
Manerplaw, capital of territory the Karen call Kawtoolei.
   Manerplaw, probably one of the world's most idyllic guerrilla
bases, sits on the Moei River, at the foot of mist-streaked hills.
   Its neat wood-and-thatch buildings house 12 government
departments of the Karen National Union, including foreign affairs,
fisheries and mining. Karen leaders claim to command 10,000 troops
and govern 1 million civilians.
   The Karen fighters and a dozen other rebellious ethnic
minorities with which they are allied do not seek independence, but
greater political and cultural autonomy.
   ``If you consider it historically, it is the worst situation we
have faced, but it doesn't mean the end of the Karen revolution,''
said Ba Thein, general secretary of the Karen National Union.
   He said the Karen were switching to more classic-style guerrilla
warfare and would have little trouble operating in areas of eastern
Burma dominated by the Karen minority. A ``mobile headquarters''
would be organized if Manerplaw fell to the Burmese, he said in an
interview.
   Ba Thein also expressed hope for internal political change in
Burma.
   ``We are not alone,'' he said. ``All the people in Burma are
struggling for freedom. We believe that, if democracy comes, all
the ethnic minority problems with be solved.''
   Burma's military, which brutally crushed a pro-democracy
uprising in 1988, has shown remarkable tenacity.
   The loss of border bases has greatly reduced the Karen National
Union's income from taxes levied on frontier smuggling, which was
used to buy weapons.
   In contrast, the 200,000-member Burmese military has restocked
its arsenal with funds from teak-logging concessions granted to
Thai businessmen.
   Burmese control of the border is now in the interest of powerful
Thais, and rebel officers say some Thai-Burmese military
cooperation has occurred.
   ``The logging has been the death knell of the Karen,'' said a
knowledgeable Western observer in Bangkok. He noted that earlier
friendly and mutually advantageous ties between the Thais and Karen
had helped sustain the insurgency.
   What some sympathetic Westerners and Thais have called the
``sellout of the Karen'' fits a historical pattern.
   Although the Karen have lived in what is now Burma at least as
long as the Burmans, they have been suppressed and looked down upon
as ``savages'' and ``wild cattle of the hills.''
   The Karen fought bravely alongside the Allies in World War II,
while a pro-Japanese government sat in Rangoon, but promises of
some autonomy were broken when Burma gained independence from
Britain in 1947.
   After the early successes of their insurgency, the tide turned
against the Karen rebels and they were gradually forced into the
border region.
   There has been incompetence and some corruption among the aging
rebel leaders, who have not conducted a real guerrilla war, and
disparities in power and education between the Christian leaders
and their followers, most of whom are Buddhist or animist.
   In 1984, the government stepped up its campaign and three years
later announced it would destroy the Karen National Union within
two years. That has not happened, but two words often heard when
the rebels discuss the future are ``dark'' and ``bleak.''
   ``I am 63 and have fought all my life,'' Ba Thein said. ``My
children have now joined the revolution. Perhaps the next
generation will also have to struggle.''

   How can surveys show no credit crunch on a
national scale when so many businesses complain about financing
restrictions?
   It will be a year before enough hard data are available and
analyzed to say whether or not a national credit crunch exists
today, which means, of course, that the answer will be too late for
practical purposes of policy.
   Meanwhile, anguished shrieks of pain can be heard from operators
of startup companies, from those involved in any way with real
estate or building, from companies with little collateral to offer,
and from otherwise solid outfits.
   Have their complaints fallen into that no-man's land, that
intellectual desert where economists debate, equivocate, qualify
and toss questions from one hand to the other and never reach even
a tentative conclusion?
   Some help in resolving the apparent contradiction _ between
those who rely on economic statistics and see no credit crunch, and
those small companies that complain of being squeezed almost to
death _ can be found in phrasing.
   Most surveys, for example, make a distinction between a general
credit crunch and regional ones. A key phrase in this distinction
is ``national credit crunch.'' To many economists, anything
regional doesn't qualify.
   Surveys also tend to look at business in general, whereas most
complaints seem to come from small or medium-size businesses, which
often use real estate as collateral. Some economists tend to think
only in big-business terms.
   And, it has been argued, those companies that indeed are hurt,
even when they represent only a small fraction of the whole, squeal
so loudly there is a tendency to think the entire barnyard is in an
uproar.
   One of the most cogent explanations offered is that of economist
William K. MacReynolds, who makes a sharp distinction between a
general credit crunch, which he says may not exist, and a
specialized one, which he says does exist.
   MacReynolds' thesis, developed for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
is not a cop-out but an explanation. While stating that ``to date,
there is no conclusive evidence that a general credit crunch
exists,'' he provides this observation:
   ``However, there is a clear sense from published economic data,
credit market behavior, new credit availability, bank examiner
actions, bank reactions, and anecdotal evidence provided by bankers
and small-business people in more than half the states in the
country that a credit crunch is underway.''
   In short, and without awaiting statistical conclusions, he
declares there is indeed a problem out there.
   He observes that larger companies with access to various credit
markets have suffered the least, even though many of them have had
their credit ratings lowered. And, as everyone knows, the junk bond
market has collapsed.
   Small-business credit providers, he says, are burdened by
targeted bank examinations, especially since the spate of bank and
thrift failures, and these examiners are especially critical of
real estate collateral.
   Real estate is a primary source of collateral for small
business. Bank examiners, says MacReynolds, are asking banks, even
well-capitalized community banks, to get new appraisals and to
write down the value of these loans.
   ``If banks do not seek new appraisals or adjust existing loans
with new collateral, they are forced to write down the value of
loans and report large losses,'' he explains, adding:
   ``And while bank examiners and government regulators would not
claim they wish to discourage good loans, the pressure on banks is
to withhold new loan approval.
   ``Even performing loans from long-standing bank customers, whose
ability to repay debt goes unchallenged, can be classified as
troubled because new appraisals have not been made.''
   That situation is exacerbated, says MacReynolds, when small
banks are taken over by larger ones. Then, he suggests, the
small-business customer might almost automatically lose its credit,
even with a good payment record.
   Conclusion: ``In a general slowdown, everyone's capital tends to
erode, and asset values stop rising.
   ``Regulatory actions on top of a slowdown that discriminate
against a class of borrowers regardless of their proven ability to
repay loans make the situation worse to the point where a crunch is
unavoidable.''

<HEAD>Is Dance Alive and Well?: The Joffrey and Other Upsets</HEAD>

   Is dance in America alive and well?
   ``It's alive but not well,'' says Richard Philp, editor in chief
of Dance magazine.
   ``No, it's isn't,'' says choreographer Agnes de Mille. ``It's
suffering from malnutrition. There isn't any money.''
   And that's a catastrophe, in her view, ``because the well-being
of the arts is a direct thermometer of our country's spiritual and
emotional well-being.
   ``The function of art in our lives I think is vital. It's next
door to food. We have to have something.''
   In recent years, dance companies throughout the United States,
like other organizations in the arts community, have suffered from
cuts in financing and reorganization. Some companies have virtually
gone out of business.
   ``In general, what you're seeing is true throughout the arts: a
decline in funding due to the economy, the mergers and acquisitions
phenomenon and to a change in priority in some companies who now
have an emphasis in the environment, education and social causes at
the expense of the arts,'' said Betsy Hopkins, executive director
of the fund-raising organization Corporate Fund for Dance.
   Hopkins said that, in general, the nation's 400 or so dance
companies were healthy and not any worse off than other arts
organizations.
   ``There's a heightened interest in dance in this country,'' she
said. ``But dance companies just don't tend to have big
endowments.''
   The most recent upheaval in the world of dance has been at the
Joffrey Ballet. Gerald Arpino, co-founder of the company with
Robert Joffrey and artistic director since Joffrey's death in 1988,
resigned May 1 and said the company _ on the eve of a Los Angeles
season _ couldn't perform his or Joffrey's creations.
   Arpino later said the company could dance his works starting May
25. He resigned after the Joffrey's 55-member board voted to
establish a nine-member operating committee, which would virtually
eliminate his power and the board's power. Ten board members
resigned immediately. The vote came after the board learned that
the company, beside its $1 million deficit, owes $800,000 in
payroll-withholding taxes.
   Negotiations continued and on May 23 an agreement was reached.
Arpino, whose resignation was never accepted, continues as artistic
director. He will license his and Joffrey's ballets to the company.
An executive committee of 10 board members plus Arpino will run
day-to-day operations.
   During May, board co-chairmen David Murdock in Los Angeles and
Anthony Bliss in New York, vice chairman Frank Lynch, board
president David Holbrook and executive director Penelope Curry
resigned.
   Earlier in the month, Murdock, the millionaire who was
instrumental in the Joffrey adopting Los Angeles as a second home
in 1983, offered to lead a three-year drive to erase the Joffrey's
deficit. Murdock's resignation may mean he rescinds that offer.
Also, the Joffrey's contract with the Los Angeles Music Center
expires June 30.
   Last November, the board defeated a proposal to name Bliss'
wife, Sally, a former dancer who headed the young Joffrey II
company, as artistic head of the company to whom Arpino and Curry
would report.
   The Joffrey's July 17-29 engagement at the University of
California at Berkeley has been canceled. However, four
performances June 7-9 at the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, S.C.,
remain booked.
   American Ballet Theater's big upheaval came last year, when
Mikhail Baryshnikov abruptly resigned as artistic director.
   Baryshnikov had brought in Jane Hermann from an administrative
job at the Metropolitan Opera to become executive director of
American Ballet Theater. She cut the season's budget to $18 million
from $23 million and instituted cost-cutting measures intended to
reduce a $1 million deficit. This led her to clash with and then
remove Charles France, Baryshnikov's personal assistant. In support
of France and citing artistic standards, Baryshnikov resigned in
September from the company he had headed since 1980.
   The Dance Theater of Harlem danced a season at the Kennedy
Center for Performing Arts in Washington in March. Having canceled
its May season here, it laid off dancers, technical personnel and
some administrative staff, saying $1.2 million could be saved.
Cancellations in domestic and European tours had made the year's
projected deficit $1.7 million.
   America's most renowned modern dance troupe, the Martha Graham
Dance Company, also had to lay off dancers through February and
March; there was no money to pay them. Dancers returned in April to
prepare for appearances in the United States, Spain and Japan from
May through August.
   Personality conflicts and power struggles may play a part but
most observers agree the basic cause of turmoil in the dance world
is lack of money.
   ``I think the problem comes right down from the presidency and
the National Council on the Arts. They don't give enough money and
they don't give it regularly enough. They're stingy,'' said Agnes
de Mille.
   ``Dance cannot support itself, never did and never will. The
fine arts aren't designed to pay for themselves. In the early days,
Lucia Chase footed the bill for Ballet Theater. Lincoln Kirstein
still foots the bill for the New York City Ballet. Rebecca Harkness
helped what became the Joffrey Ballet.
   ``Dancers are very special. They have to be cared for very
carefully and it's expensive. Now, they're getting reasonable
salaries. Before, they starved.''
   Money sources are drying up, while operational costs continue to
soar.
   ``I don't know what the Dance Theater of Harlem is going to
do,'' said Philp, the editor of Dance. ``The Joffrey's philosophy
has been to present the best of 20th century dance, historical as
well as contemporary. They may have to adapt.''
   After the Dance Theater of Harlem's shutdown became known, it
received nearly $150,000, a third each from Chase Manhattan Bank,
the New York State Council for the Arts and individuals, so that
its school could remain open. The Shubert Foundation made a
$200,000 challenge grant to the company. A fund-raising event will
be held this month.
   At Ballet Theater, works by experimental modern-dance
choreographers and expensive new productions of Russian ballets
often were mounted during Baryshnikov's tenure. Philp says of the
latter, ``The dancers didn't have the maturity that's necessary to
project the heart and soul of certain roles.''
   In the future, American Ballet Theater apparently intends to
emphasize Antony Tudor and Agnes de Mille dance-dramas and to
develop stars who'll be box-office draws. A fund-raising 50th
anniversary gala, with top ticket price at $1,250, was held in
January.
   While de Mille praises the efforts of dance companies to pull
themselves up by their own bootstraps, she believes the government
should see the need for vigorous interest and help. ``I think our
lives are terribly starved. We have enough electrical gadgets but
our brains are empty. In large measure our spirits are empty. If
they weren't, we wouldn't have so many snarling people on the
streets.
   ``I think our government doesn't lead us,'' she said. ``I think
they reflect what they think is the common will and they think the
common will is for more soap operas and more crack.
   ``We were blessedly fortunate with those men in Philadelphia,
the founding fathers. They were knowledgeable and they sat down and
really deliberated and didn't have people telling them how many
votes they're get here or there.''

   The members of Dance Theatre of Harlem see
themselves as different from those in other top-tier ballet
companies, united on a mission to bring the fine arts to people too
long out of their reach.
   But this summer the dancers have found themselves thrown apart,
laid off for six months by a combination of bad luck and economic
reality.
   Losing 15 of the minimum 40 weeks they're accustomed to working
each year, the dancers worry about paying their rent, meeting other
bills and keeping in shape. And they worry whether their company
can come out of this in one piece.
   ``I'm very concerned that this interuption is so long that it's
going to be hard to rebuild suddenly,'' said Virginia Johnson, a
principal ballerina and the company's star who has been with the
troupe for 21 years.
   ``I am very worried about the individual dancers and if the
company as it was is going to be able to survive. ... Will they be
able to leave what they found in the interim?''
   Johnson considers herself lucky, having quickly lined up guest
performances with the Garden State Ballet in Newark, N.J., and the
Washington Ballet in Washington, D.C. She also plans to continue
work on her college degree _ she took a leave of absence 20 years
ago from studying history.
   The lithe, delicate dancer thinks about modeling, or maybe
working as a receptionist. She takes dance classes: ``When you're a
dancer and you're used to dancing eight hours a day, you just don't
feel like the same person if you're not taking class.''
   She insists, however, that she has not considered quitting the
troupe. ``It's not just a job; it's not just a place that we go to
dance. It's a place that we feel we make a contribution to solving
some of the world's problems.''
   Arthur Mitchell, a former principal dancer with the New York
City Ballet, co-founded Dance Theatre of Harlem in 1969 as a
commitment to the Harlem community after the assassination of the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
   From the start, the troupe challenged racial stereotypes and
proved that blacks can dance classical ballet. The company prides
itself on preserving American dance repertory, demonstrating a
variety of styles and moods, from the classical ``Swan Lake'' to
George Balanchine's neoclassical ``Allegro Brillante'' to
Mitchell's modern ``Holberg Suite'' to the folk ballet ``John
Henry.''
   In 1988, the troupe captivated audiences in the Soviet Union
with its magical retelling of John Taras' ``Firebird,'' set to the
original Igor Stravinsky score.
   Now considered among the country's top professional ballet
companies, Dance Theatre of Harlem's commitment to its mission
remains as strong as ever.
   When not doing regular performances, the dancers conduct
workshops for disadvantaged youths, introducing them to the arts
and the discipline they require, and particularly to classical
ballet. One such audience included members of rival Los Angeles
street gangs.
   ``We're trying to be positive role models ... to all the youth
in the United States,'' says Eddie J. Shellman, a principal dancer
who joined the company in 1975 and plans to stay even after he
stops dancing.
   ``We're very close. We're all related because we're all going
for the same thing, which is a sense of pride, giving the best that
we can give _ just raising the company's self-esteem, which happens
at every performance,'' he said.
   Shellman is spending the layoff teaching ballet, working on a
license to teach dance as a substitute in New York public schools
and preparing for his wedding to fellow dancer Endalyn Taylor. He
is living partly off his savings.
   Lowell Smith, a principal dancer who's been with the troupe for
13 years, is trying to break into acting, as he's always planned to
do.
   He intends to dance full time again when the company resumes.
But at 36, he's also realizing he may soon be seeking a more
permanent alternative.
   Mitchell felt Dance Theatre of Harlem was somehow safer than
other non-profit arts companies, partly because it earns a
relatively high 50 percent of its budget.
   But the middle fell out of the company's scheduled European tour
when an arts festival in Leeds, England, was canceled after its
artistic director died, and its London booking was lost because the
venue's regular occupant had a schedule change. Then an American
sponsor had to cancel the company's dates in San Diego for
financial reasons.
   Facing a potential $2 million deficit and a spring New York
season that traditionally loses money, the only way the company
could show fiscal responsibility was to curtail activities,
Mitchell said.
   The company laid off about 80 full-time dancers, technicians and
administrative members of a full- and part-time staff that totals
140, cutting the budget for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30 to
$5.3 million from $7.6 million. Special grants from Chase Manhattan
Bank and the New York State Council on the Arts allowed the
company's school to keep going.
   Performances were canceled from April, except for one
fundraiser. The company plans to resume Oct. 1 _ provided the board
sees the fiscal year end without red ink and sees a significant
start toward $2 million in the bank.
   Mitchell is optimistic. But some dancers, especially younger
ones, worry he won't be able to bring everyone back.
   Andre Levitt, 26, who joined the corps last year, reluctantly
admits he's been auditioning for other dance troupes.
   ``I don't want to, but you have to be careful,'' he said. ``I'm
too young to guest now for the rest of my career. I should be in a
company, learning things.''
   Meanwhile, he tries to make ends meet. On what he says is the
bottom salary rung, Levitt normally earns $495 a week. Unemployment
brings him $225 a week.
   A three-week guest appearance with a Virginia company brought
him $500, total.
   ``It was really frustrating,'' Levitt said of the layoff. ``I
guess I thought that with a bigger company like Dance Theatre of
Harlem, that things like this just don't happen.''
   Sophia Cannonier feels even more vulnerable. She's still a
probationary apprentice, not yet under regular contract. Still a
student and on a stipend, the layoff cost her half her check.
   But still a citizen of Bermuda, she has no work permit. And
still a student, she has had to spend at least four hours a day in
class and rehearsing for an open house, leaving little time to work
even off the books.
   ``It keeps me busy. It keeps me in class,'' she says. ``It keeps
my hopes and just my adrenaline going.''
   Cannonier, 20, plans to go home and live with her parents this
summer. She'll guest, like some other members of the company, with
the Bermuda Civic Ballet. A former beauty queen, she plans to do
some modeling.
   And, she says, she will return.
   ``I ultimately want to be in Dance Theatre of Harlem,''
Cannonier said. ``I love what they do, how they perform. And I want
to be a part of that ... just the way they move, their rapport,
their style.''

   In the world of tutus and toe shoes, red is
particularly hot this season. Barely a week seems to pass without a
mention of some dance company's financial woes.
   The problems aren't particularly new to non-profit organizations.
   ``Everybody's always been struggling,'' said Stephanie French,
vice president for corporate contributions and cultural affairs at
Philip Morris Companies Inc. ``But somehow it seems that they're
more severe now.
   ``Giving budgets haven't gone up so much, but everybody's
operating budget has. All the requests are for more money.''
   Trouble comes to all sizes and all regions.
   At the Joffrey Ballet, which has homes on both coasts,
long-simmering artistic vs. administrative conflicts were brought
to a head this spring by a deficit growing toward $2 million.
   In a power struggle, artistic director Gerald Arpino resigned _
taking his works and those of the late Robert Joffrey, with whom he
founded the company in 1956. Numerous board members, including
French, also left. Arpino and the works have returned. The deficit
didn't leave.
   At the Cleveland Ballet, fast growth helped cause an
accumulation of red ink, particularly in the last five years, that
is hard to wash out.
   American interest in dance blossomed in the 1960s and '70s,
thanks largely to the Ford Foundation fostering ballet training and
companies nationwide. Headline-grabbing defections of glamorous
Soviet dancers such as Rudolf Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov also
helped.
   But now audience growth is leveling, while costs are not, and
companies find themselves in an increasingly competitive fight for
money.
   Douglas Sonntag, senior program specialist in the dance program
of the National Endowment for the Arts, notes that many companies,
of various sizes, are flourishing artistically and financially _
such as the New York City, Boston, Houston and Pacific Northwest
ballets.
   If a dance company earns more than 30 percent to 40 percent of
its income, that's really quite good, Sonntag says.
   But it isn't always enough.
   Dance Theater of Harlem has been earning 50 percent of its
budget, says co-founder and artistic director Arthur Mitchell. But
this year, emergencies unrelated to the company cost it three
scheduled appearances, two in the middle of a European tour.
   That erased $1.2 million. Then an anticipated $150,000 in grants
turned out to be $50,000.
   Seeing red, Mitchell, the executive director and the board took
emergency evasive action. They called a six-month layoff, canceling
the remaining European dates as well as the company's New York
season that, though important for prestige, traditionally loses
money.
   The 14-year-old Cleveland Ballet has been growing by leaps and
bounds. Its budget for the fiscal year ended last June 30 was about
$7 million, more than double that of five years before. Its deficit
was $1.3 million. This year also is expected to close in the red.
   The Cleveland Ballet earns 65 percent of its income, spokeswoman
Christine Patronik-Holder says. The rest is contributed. And, as is
the case with many other dance companies, the Cleveland Ballet has
no endowment.
   The company has found its niche in full-length, theatrical
ballets that are expensive to mount, even though it makes most
costumes and scenery in-house.
   But ticket sales have gone down, Patronik-Holder says. Rent for
theater, studio and office space is $600,000 a year.
   Growing pains have been costly. In 1988, the Cleveland Ballet
presented itself in Chicago, to good reviews and a $600,000 loss.
Now, it performs only in Cleveland and its other home city of San
Jose, Calif., unless assured of at least breaking even.
   Philip Morris' French believes the answer lies in arts companies
finding a broader donor base, especially among individuals. But
it's not a good time for donations.
   At the National Endowment for the Arts, the dance program budget
has remained at about $9 million for several years, Sonntag says.
About two-thirds of that goes to dance companies. Grants range from
$10,000 to $400,000. But they have to be matched.
   In the private sector, where profits have been sagging,
corporations that sponsor the arts are demanding more marketing for
their money, he said. That poses problems for arts groups that
can't afford to give disproportionate credit to any single source.
   Today, individuals, corporations and foundations with any money
to give face a devastating array of causes that address fundamental
social needs _ such as homelessness, AIDS and crack-addicted babies.
   ``They are hitting at a much more basic level of need in our
society than cultural improvement,'' says Sonntag. ``We have to
have homes before we have theaters.''

   In Turin, Italy, the Roman Catholic Church has
six official exorcists to cast out demons. Magicians, seers, faith
healers, mind readers, astrologers and others dabbling in the
occult advertise regularly on television. Has Satan established a
stronghold in the ancient city famous for its religious icons?

<DATELINE>TURIN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Real or imagined, the devil is tormenting
this sober industrial city in northwestern Italy.
   Some believe a sinister presence lurks in the shadows along the
city's broad, arcaded boulevards and haunts the medieval squares in
the nearby mountain hamlets of the Piedmontese Alps.
   The city likes to be remembered as the former seat of the House
of Savoy dynasty, the first capital of a unified Italy, the resting
place of saints and religious relics, the home of the Fiat auto
empire.
   It's also the home of the Shroud of Turin, which some believe
was the cloth with which Joseph of Arimathea wrapped the body of
Jesus Christ after his crucifixion.
   But Turin has a darker reputation as a haven for Satan and his
disciples.
   There is no proof, of course. But what is certain is that the
city has six official exorcists, an underground core of devil
worshipers and thousands of people dealing in the occult.
   Specialists in the occult maintain that Turin forms part of two
``magic'' triangles representing good and evil.
   Along with Prague, Czechoslovakia, and Lyon, France, the city is
reputedly a center of ``white magic,'' a positive force. Turin is
also said to join London and San Francisco as a stronghold of
``black magic,'' which is considered harmful or diabolic.
   ``Turin has always been a place of great spiritual and magical
ferment,'' says Giuditta Dembech, a journalist and author of the
book ``Torino: Citta Magica'' (Turin: Magic City). ``It has some of
the qualities of places like Mecca, Jerusalem and Lourdes.''
   The city first attracted widespread notoriety as a devil's
playground four years ago when Turin's archbishop at the time,
Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero, appointed six official exorcists.
   Exorcism, the process of casting out demons, is an accepted
practice in the Catholic Church. Pope John Paul II has frequently
stated that the devil is a pervasive reality in today's world.
   The naming of the six exorcists in Turin followed a directive
from Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, prefect of the Vatican's
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, for churches to
exercise greater control over exorcisms.
   ``Unfortunately some of our priests had gone a little too far
and were performing exorcisms too hastily,'' says Canon Giuseppe
Ruata, who heads Turin's pool of official exorcists.
   Two events in 1988 further contributed to the city's satanic
image.
   First, the pope spoke of the devil during a visit to Turin,
saying: ``From the history of salvation, we know that where there
are saints there is also another person who presents himself not by
his name but the name of others. He is called the prince of this
world, the demon.''
   Then, a month later, Turin hosted a weeklong conference on
demonology that bitterly divided local politicians, churchmen and
academics.
   Church officials deny Turin has a greater problem with the devil
than any other cities, pointing out that Milan tops Italy with
eight exorcists of its own. Milan has a population of 1.5 million,
compared with Turin's 1 million.
   ``Turin has an image it doesn't deserve,'' Ruata, 74, said in an
interview at the archdiocesan offices. ``I wouldn't make Turin out
to be the capital of the demonic empire.''
   Most agree, however, that Turin has an unusually high number of
magicians, seers, faith healers, mind readers, astrologers and
others dabbling in superstition and witchcraft. They advertise
continuously on private television and radio.
   ``There are more than 100 of these types of agencies in Turin,''
Ruata says. ``They charge $400 as the initial fee for removing a
spell. It's a huge form of trickery.''

   Ruata says he is approached every day by people who believe they
are possessed by the demon. Nearly all, he says, are people with
psychological problems or are superstitious.
   Actual demonic possession occurs in ``perhaps 2 or 3 percent''
of the cases, Ruata says. He says he has personally performed only
one real exorcism.
   ``Real diabolical possession involves a great aversion for the
sacred,'' he says. ``The possessed will spew out terrifying curses
and speak foreign languages which they never learned. Sometimes
levitation occurs. They rise up, then fall back like a sack of
potatoes. It's horrible. Then the phenomenon goes away and they
don't remember anything.''
   While there are people in Turin who turn to the church to combat
demons, there are others who pay devotion to Satan in secret,
ritualistic ceremonies.
   Ruata says devil worshipers have robbed churches of hosts, the
bread consecrated for the Eucharist, and other objects for use in
``black Masses.''
   Gianluigi Marianini, a Turin television personality, political
figure and demonologist, claims the city has 40,000 satanic
followers.
   ``The ones I've known are everyday people,'' says Marianini, 71,
stroking his white goatee. ``They don't give any outward sign of
anything. They just have this dark corner of their lives. They are
usually people who are frustrated with their lives and choose this
parallel religion out of disillusionment.''
   Dembech, the author, disputes the 40,000 figure.
   ``It's already hard enough to find 40,000 perfect Christians,''
she writes. ``The real Satanists in this city can be counted on one
hand.''
   Turin's devil worshipers have sometimes left behind signs of
their activities.
   Last year, for example, a satanic cult was blamed for
desecrating an ancient church in the suburb of Pianezza, plundering
the tombs of clerics buried there centuries ago and using the bones
for some macabre ritual.
   The bones were found scattered around the church and some
tombstones were crushed.
   Marianini says several young girls found murdered in the
countryside south of Turin in recent years have born signs of
ritual sacrifice. ``The girls were killed by sword or dagger, their
money and jewelry were untouched and there was no sexual assault,''
he says.
   Marianini says he's seen basement temples used for black Masses.
They are equipped with a black marble altar, an upside-down
crucifix, black candles and wooden balls ``which are said to
contain pieces of human hearts,'' he says.
   During black Masses, according to eyewitness accounts,
participants at times show up hooded and the ritual sometimes ends
in sexual orgies.
   An example of the undeserved attention given the devil occurred
in 1988 when the murders of a young Turin couple were blamed on a
satanic ritual, drawing such lurid headlines in the normally staid
local newspaper, La Stampa, as ``Fear of the Devil Killed Them.''
Last month, a court put an end to the hysteria, ruling they were
victims of a cocaine ring. ``The Devil Acquitted,'' said La Stampa.
   The Rev. John Navone, an American theologian at the Pontifical
Gregorian University in Rome, believes Satanism is no more
prevalent in Turin or Italy than in other modern, industrial
societies.
   ``What about Los Angeles or Miami or Seattle?'' he asks. ``I
think there is probably more Satanism in the United States than
Italy. The fact that it is a scandal in Italy is perhaps a sign of
the society's health.''

   Neither Bill nor Myra has matured much beyond the mentality of a
young adult, Buchanan says. But together they have achieved what
each wanted so badly for so long: independence and intimacy.
   ``At night, when I come home, he's sitting there,'' Myra says.
``There's somebody to talk to, somebody in the house.''
   There's somebody to help figure out the microwave, turn off the
television or share a funny story. ``There's someone to call `Hon'
or `Sweetie,''' says Diane Barbee, residential director at the
cooperative.
   As in any relationship, Bill and Myra have their problems.
Through therapy, they have learned how to control the frustrations
that quickly turn to anger.
   They've also learned how to turn to each other when faced with
the sudden pain of an insult, perhaps issued by a mocking stranger
in a passing car. But still they are sometimes unprepared.
   ``One time there were some people in a car and they said they
were going to a party, did we want to come along,''' Myra says.
``So we did, but it wasn't good. They were religious people and
they wanted things.''
   That's where the Cooperative For Human Services staff comes in.
Counselors such as Barbee and Buchanan are on hand to intervene
when someone _ perhaps a peddler _ tries to capitalize on Bill and
Myra's naivete.
   The staff is also there to explain the daily prejudices and
bolster morale. They are part of a civil rights movement embodied
by the proposed Americans With Disabilities Act which, if approved
by Congress, would guarantee equal opportunities to the nation's
more than 35 million adults with mental and physical handicaps.
   It would help people like Bill and Myra when they confront old
stereotypes, such as the common assumption that parents with
disabilities will necessarily bear similarly disabled children.
   Dr. Pasquale Accardo, co-author of ``When A Parent Is Mentally
Retarded,'' says it depends on the individual whether retarded
parents are able to give their children a well-rounded upbringing.
But he says his studies indicate that less than one-third of their
children are born retarded.
   ``People still have irrational fears,'' says Accardo, a
professor at St. Louis University School of Medicine.
   Bill and Myra are helping educate the public.
   They are familiar fixtures in their hometown just outside
Boston, meeting people while on their weekly trip to the
supermarket, standing in line to catch a ``Batman'' matinee or
having a hamburger at the Brigham's coffee shop.
   ``A lot of people look at someone like Myra and Bill and think
it's nice they can do for themselves,'' Barbee says. ``But others
think differently.''
   Some people underestimate what Bill and Myra can do for
themselves. They think they have to speak louder or gesture wildly.
Some people don't understand that retarded adults are not exempt
from the human range of emotions.
   Disabled people can be scary _ even to each other.
   Bill, much like Myra, had reservations when they first met in
1974 at a supervised workshop. After four decades of living in his
parents' home, he wanted to prove he could live on his own.
   But he also harbored memories of a previous girlfriend who had
whipped him across the face with a belt and threatened his one good
eye with a lit cigarette.
   ``I wanted to know why she was in the hospital for all those
years and she explained how she used to be really nervous and did
damage to her mother and friends,'' he says.
   ``I just looked at her and thought, `Should I or shouldn't I?'
'' he says. ``And then I said to myself, `I'm going to try it
again.'''
   Soon they were sharing Cokes at a nearby Holiday Inn, listening
together to the songs of Elvis Presley or taking the bus to spend
sunny days at Salisbury Beach. Sometimes they would take drives
with Myra's parents up to Vermont or Maine.
   They were growing closer, and soon they became lovers.
   ``When I was growing up I figured I would never move out on my
own and always be a burden,'' Myra says, reaching for Bill's hand.
   ``I'd never know how to cook or sew. I'm dumb. I'm stupid.
That's what I thought. Now I know some other things. And Billy
does, too.''

   It's the last wish of hundreds of terminally ill
children to visit Walt Disney World or one of the other tourist
attractions in central Florida. Now they can, thanks to the efforts
of a death camp survivor and a lot of other individuals and
corporations.

<TEXT>
   As a boy of 13 in a Nazi concentration
camp, Henri Landwirth learned what it's like to wait fearfully for
death at an early age.
   At 63, he believes he's been living the past 45 years on
borrowed time.
   So feeling a need ``to give something back,'' he's now helping
make dreams come true for terminally ill children.
   The slim, white-haired Landwirth, a survivor of the infamous
death camp at Auschwitz, is the founder of a vacation village
called Give Kids the World, a special retreat for children whose
last wish is to visit Walt Disney World, Sea World or one of the
many other tourist attractions in central Florida.
   Because of his efforts _ combined with the generosity of some
major corporations and individuals _ hundreds of terminally ill
boys and girls come here every year with their families. All it
takes is for the sick child to ask a local group in his or her
hometown.
   They spend a week at the complex, each family in one of the 32
villas at the year-old village.
   ``Seventy-five percent of the dying children want to see Mickey
Mouse,'' Landwirth says, citing statistics compiled from visitors.
``Eighty percent of the families never left their home state and
just as many will never travel again as a family. So this trip is a
lifetime vacation.
   ``Families can do all the major theme parks or whatever they
want. Each kid gets a gift every day. We have a big party, local
restaurants provide food. The Disney and Sea World characters visit
and entertain. We have volunteers working with the kids.''
   The village is located in the rural countryside less than a mile
from busy U.S. Highway 192 near Disney World. It has a playground,
a pool designed for the handicapped, a fishing lake, a mock pirate
ship and a large cafeteria-family center.
   ``We never turn anyone away, and we can accommodate a family on
very short notice because the greatest enemy of these kids is
time,'' says the soft-spoken Landwirth.
   Landwirth came to his role as benefactor through the
determination he acquired as a youth to survive the Jewish
Holocaust.
   He and his twin sister, Margot, were separated from their
parents and sent off to separate concentration camps in
German-occupied Poland in the early days of World War II. Their
father, Max, was killed soon after his imprisonment. Their mother,
Fanny, was among more than 1,000 female prisoners herded aboard a
ship that was blown up at sea just weeks before the Nazis
surrendered to the Allies.
   After five years of imprisonment, young Henri managed to escape
and spent about a month hiding and wandering _ homeless, sick,
hungry and scared. Finally, three days after the war ended, he was
taken in by a family in a small Czechoslovakian village.
   After his recovery, Landwirth hitchhiked back to a small town in
Poland where he had learned his sister was living after her
repatriation. Together they returned to Belgium, where they were
born, and he emigrated to this country in 1949.
   Soon after his arrival in New York, where he worked briefly as a
diamond cutter, Landwirth was drafted by the U.S. Army during the
Korean War.
   After his discharge, he went to hotel-management school under
the GI Bill, got married and eventually got a job in a Miami Beach
hotel as a bellboy.
   Hard work paid off in better jobs and soon he was manager of the
Starlite Hotel in Cocoa Beach, at the time the nation's space
program was gearing up in nearby Cape Canaveral.
   Landwirth became innkeeper to the nation's original crew of
astronauts, the Mercury Seven. Virtually the entire space hierarchy
and journalist corps moved into first one and then another hotel he
operated during those early years.
   He became friends with astronauts John Glenn, Alan Shepard and
Scott Carpenter and media personalities such as Walter Cronkite _
all of whom would later serve on the advisory board of Give Kids
the World Foundation.

   ``We were like a family,'' says Landwirth, recalling the
exciting, infant days of the space program.
   Glenn, now a U.S. senator from Ohio, went into partnership with
Landwirth in the hotel business in the Orlando area in 1970, soon
after Disney World began operating. The two were franchise holders
for three large Holiday Inn motels for years.
   They still own one in Kissimmee, and are planning to build a new
hotel at the Disney community of Lake Buena Vista.
   Landwirth and the astronauts also became founding members of the
Mercury Seven Foundation, which provides annual scholarships for
upper-level college students specializing in aerospace, science and
engineering fields.
   Landwirth, who has a long history of philanthropy, first became
interested in helping terminally ill children when as a hotel
operator he provided free rooms for some of the kids and parents
who were brought here on an occasional basis by volunteer groups
around the country.
   ``I remember two kids died while waiting for arrangements to be
made for a visit to Disney World,'' Landwirth says. ``It took so
long to coordinate efforts for airline transportation, lodging,
free tickets at the attractions, food and all of the other things.
   ``I decided something had to be done.''
   Landwirth used a foundation he had created in his mother's name
as financial backing for his idea to act as a clearinghouse to make
all local arrangements for the last-wish trips.
   He first contacted Disney officials three years ago and they
enthusiastically agreed to help.
   ``They were fantastic,'' he says. ``To this day, they've never
said no to anything and they are our biggest supporters and
contributors _ from money to services and people and all the
special things that they do and do not publicize.''
   After that, Sea World, Cypress Gardens and other attractions got
into the picture on a permanent basis, along with Holiday Inn and
some 40 other businesses and groups large and small. Area hotels
continued to furnish accommodations until the village was built and
dedicated last year.
   The $3.5 million in construction costs came from donations, with
$1.7 million coming from Holiday Inns Corp. and its employees and
$1.8 million in labor and materials from area businesses and the
community, said Julia H. Wylam, director of development.
   Landwirth calculates the value of the goods, services, tickets,
gifts and other items provided directly to the kids and their
families last year at $3 million.
   There are some 150 wish-granting foundations around the world
that identify the children, provide administrative and medical
assistance and round-trip transportation for their visits here.
   Many of the kids write Landwirth and the village staff after
their return home.
   ``You are a wonderful man,'' wrote teen-ager Amy Johnson from
Phoenix, shortly before she died of leukemia.
   ``Children are supposed to be our future but kids like me don't
have futures, we just have memories _ memories of our past. You're
in my prayers for remembering us little people.''
   Lisa and Jack McDonald of Lewiston, Maine, who brought their
5-year-old daughter, Kristin, to the village in March, wrote:
   ``Our visit to the Kids Village allowed us as parents to share
our experiences, hopes and fears with other parents who are
undergoing very similar actions and emotions in their respective
lives.''
   Landwirth now devotes most of his time to the village.
   ``This is my life now. I'm fulfilling a spiritual need,'' he
says.
   ``I love this country. I love what's happened to me here. This
is more rewarding than anything I have ever done.''

   In the 40 years since Arthur Miller first
adapted Henrik Ibsen's ``Enemy of the People'' as a protest against
McCarthyism, he has reverted back to the secondary theme of the
century-old play, a warning about environmental pollution.
   Miller has moved the play from a 19th century Norwegian village
to a turn-of-the-century health spa in Maine in a new staging for
``American Playhouse'' on PBS. It will have its premiere on
Wednesday.
   ``It's really a prophetic play,'' says Miller, who is in Los
Angeles to help with the taping of the play by KCET-TV.
   Jack O'Brien directs this version, which stars John Glover and
George Grizzard as brothers who end up on opposite sides of an
issue.
   Glover plays a doctor who discovers that a tannery's faulty
waste disposal system is polluting the town's water supply and is
causing an epidemic of health problems. When he makes this public,
the townspeople, led by Grizzard, the mayor, turn on him for fear
it will harm the town's reputation as a health spa.
   In 1950, when Miller adapted the play for Broadway, it spoke out
against Sen. Joseph McCarthy's campaign against domestic communism.
But the times have changed and the play is now seen as a cautionary
tale about pollution.
   ``I saw the Ibsen play in London last year and realized why the
ecology theme had such an impact,'' Miller says. ``But that wasn't
why Ibsen wrote the play. Ecology was hardly important in Norway in
the last century. It was the right of someone to speak the truth
against the will of the majority.''
   Ibsen wrote ``An Enemy of the People'' in 1881 after reading a
newspaper account of a scientist who was vilified for reporting the
pollution of a town's water supply.
   The tourist dollars theme also was used by Peter Benchley in
``Jaws.'' It told of a police chief who faced opposition from the
mayor and townspeople when he tried to close a seaside resort's
beaches because of attacks by a great white shark.
   ``One of the reasons I chose to adapt this play in 1950 was that
Fredric March asked me to do it at the height of the McCarthy
era,'' Miller says. ``In that same period I wrote `The Crucible,'
which is a parable of the McCarthy era.''
   Miller is also discussing an adaptation of ``The Crucible'' with
executives of the Arts &amp; Entertainment cable channel.
   O'Brien, artistic director of the Old Globe Theater in San
Diego, says what Miller has done is give ``Enemy of the People'' an
``American spin.''
   ``Bringing the play to America figures only obliquely in the
story because Arthur has such respect for Ibsen,'' O'Brien says.
``Arthur has written the dialogue in quintessential American
cadence. But the relevance of this play written so long ago is
scary.
   ``I just did Anton Chekhov's `Uncle Vanya,' which was written in
1892. It has a huge speech about conservation and ecological
disasters. You would absolutely believe that play was written
today. The same thing with Arthur's adaptation. So why shouldn't we
take advantage of it?''
   O'Brien, at the Globe Theater since 1981, puts on 12 to 15 shows
a year. ``Enemy of the People'' is the fifth play he's directed for
``The American Playhouse.''

   Playwright Peter Barnes recalls that about 10
years ago critics were complaining about the length of his plays.
In frustration, he tried radio. He liked it.
   Barnes is not alone in writing regularly for both stage and
radio. The list includes such names as Tom Stoppard, Arnold Wesker
and Harold Pinter.
   Not only does radio offer exposure, it attracts big names.
   Barnes wrote for radio one of the late Laurence Olivier's last
roles, ``No End To Dreaming.'' His radio work has enjoyed the
luxury of talent such as Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Paul Scofield and Sir
John Gielgud.
   With the notable exception of David Mamet, few major playwrights
in the United States bother with radio drama. But several
expatriate American writers have found a hospitable environment on
the British airwaves.
   Craig Warner, a 25-year-old American based in London, has had
three radio dramas produced by the British Broadcasting Corp. He
says he has now written more radio plays than he ever heard
broadcast when he was in his native Los Angeles.
   Warner's ``By Where the Old Shed Used To Be'' won a Giles Cooper
award as one of the five best radio dramas of the past year.
   For many, the BBC and radio drama are synonymous. Besides
serials and soap operas, the network produces an average of 500
radio plays a year.
   Two commercial stations _ Radio Clyde in Scotland and LBC
Crown-FM in London _ also program radio drama.
   Finlay Welsh, drama producer at Radio Clyde, acknowledges that
audiences and financial returns are small.
   However, he said in an interview, ``It's very important that an
independent radio station not simply produce news and music
programs but also make a definite and deliberate contribution to
writing and acting.''
   Radio drama's heyday dates back to Dylan Thomas's ``Under
Milkwood,'' perhaps the best-known radio play ever. It lasted until
the mid-1960s.
   Those were the days when the theater was under censorship. There
was no alternative ``fringe'' theater to pick up the slack.
   ``The very important thing is to nurture writers,'' says John
Tydeman, head of the BBC Radio drama department. ``Pinter still
writes; Tom Stoppard is writing a pla for us. They can say things
in a certain way on radio, and we are discovering new people all
the time.''
   Some are first surprised, then delighted, to find themselves
writing for radio.
   Peter Barnes' series ``Barnes's People'' began on BBC Radio 3 in
1980.
   ``Radio was a ball because they just asked, I delivered, and
they put it on,'' he says.
   Barnes notes that radio plays are made in three or four days,
compared with the eight years it took for his award-winning 1985
play ``Red Noses'' to get produced at the Royal Shakespeare Company.
   Arnold Wesker, the noted British playwright of ``Roots'' and
``Chips with Everything,'' was commissioned to write his first
radio play, ``Bluey,'' in 1984. It was about a judge on the verge
of a nervous collapse.
   ``I got my education from radio, but I never really thought
about writing for radio,'' he recalls.
   Wesker found he enjoyed the genre.
   ``I was using sound in a way that couldn't be used so
effectively elsewhere _ the sound of wind and rain, the sound of
building sites, the sound of words echoing through the judge's head
which finally assemble and tell him what had led to his
breakdown,'' Wesker says.
   A second radio play, ``Yardsale,'' was later performed as part
of a double bill on stage.
   Wesker says he would write more if the money were better. Even
the most successful radio dramas pay a fraction of the $35,000 to
$50,000 or more that a hit play can generate for its writer.
   David Zane Mairowitz, an American writer based in France, says
he's ``one of the few people in the world'' who can live off radio
drama. His plays are produced first in Britain, then translated and
sold on the Continent.
   Mairowitz, 47, says he was drawn to the imaginative demands of
radio.
   ``A radio listener is someone who has to produce the images in
his mind, in his head. Whoever's listening is responsible for 50
percent of the input of whatever he's listening to.''
   Mairowitz, like Warner, also received a Giles Cooper award this
year, for ``The Stalin Sonata,'' about a female pianist imprisoned
during Stalin's 1937 purges.
   Sometimes radio is a steppingstone to the stage. Agatha
Christie's long-running ``The Mousetrap'' began on radio as ``Three
Blind Mice.'' Tom Stoppard wrote his 90-minute ``Artist Descending
A Staircase'' for radio only to have it turn up last December on
Broadway, where it flopped.
   Simon Gray, whose ``Quartermaine's Terms'' and ``The Common
Pursuit'' have been hits off-Broadway, used radio as the medium to
revise his London play ``Melon.''
   ``I found myself changing a few scenes and suggested we should
give it a whirl on radio,'' he says.
   Gray rewrote it for BBC Radio 3 under the title ``The Holy
Terror,'' a name it will retain for its Broadway bow next January.

<TEXT>
   It won the ``velvet revolution,''
runs the government and smiles on every village from its happy-face
symbol, but Civic Forum has tough competition in the nation's first
free elections since 1946.
   Polls show it leading, but with less than a quarter of the total
vote. Civic Forum appears likely to lose to the Christian Democrats
in Slovakia, the more rural and Roman Catholic of the two
constituent republics.
   Campaigning began officially April 29, with rallies, posters on
practically every available surface and endless spots on radio and
television. Each of 23 parties fighting for seats in the federal
parliament and the Czech and Slovak legislatures gets four hours of
time.
   Czechoslovaks will vote Friday and Saturday.
   Few differences are evident among the parties. All reject the
communist past, including the Communists. All favor a market
economy and parliamentary democracy.
   Civic Forum's membership cuts across the political spectrum. It
claims to be neither left nor right and emphasizes its well-known
personalities, including President Vaclav Havel, experience, and
authority as leader of the November revolution.
   In the din of conflicting election claims, muddied further by
accusations of past connections between leading figures and the
Communist secret police, polls show one in four voters undecided
and have the the Communists running third.
   As elsewhere in Eastern Europe, the Communists are under fire
from all the others, despite the party's new advocacy of democratic
principles.
   Civic Forum's competition comes from a flock of new or remodeled
parties, chief among them the Christian Democrats, buoyed by recent
center-right victories in East Germany and Hungary.
   ``We shall win ... but I don`t know how big it will be,'' said
Jana Ryslinkova, a mathematician who speaks for Civic Forum. ``I
think it won't be less than 30 percent.''
   Havel, Civic Forum's biggest asset with voters, is officially
setting himself apart from organization he helped found, on grounds
his office requires impartiality.
   The immensely popular president does help indirectly by
participating in events organized by Civic Forum. He opened its
indoor-outdoor exhibit on recent Czechoslovak history, which draws
large crowds.
   Under a new proportional system, a party whose candidate list
gets 5 percent of the vote nationally is guaranteed representation
in Parliament. Up to six parties could qualify, forcing Civic Forum
to make a power-sharing arrangement.
   Parties variously describe themselves as right, center or
center-left, but the main distinctions involve economic control and
social benefits.
   Leftist parties such as the Communists, Socialists and Social
Democrats favor slower conversion to capitalism and some retention
of benefits. The Christian Democrats reject any degree of
socialism, empasizing their identification with ``Christian values
and tradition.''
   Some Civic Forum leaders want to retain elements of socialism.
   A survey released by the state polling organization May 20 said
Civic Forum was supported by 26.9 percent of voters, while the
Christian Democrats had 16.4 percent and the Communists and Greens
9.8 percent each. In Slovakia, Christian Democrats led Civic
Forum's Slovakian arm by 29.1 percent to 13.1 percent.
   In November, Civic Forum seemed to be the country's only
authentic political force. Its rallies attracted hundreds of
thousands of people and persuaded Communist leaders to step aside
peacefully.
   Since then, the government it dominates has improved
Czechoslovakia's image abroad, negotiated a deal for withdrawal of
Soviet military forces by June 1991 and erased myriad symbols of
the old order.
   Radical overhaul of the economy must wait until after the
election, however, in part because of divisions in the government
over how fast to go.
   Ms. Ryslinkova, the Civic Forum spokeswoman, said the edge goes
to Civic Forum over parties offering similar programs because
``what we have more than the other parties is the ... people able
to lead.''
   Hoping to overcome it is the Christian Democratic Alliance of
the People's Party, formerly allied with the Communists, the
Christian Democratic Party in in the Czech republic, and the
Christian Democratic Movement in Slovakia.
   The alliance has joined forces with associations of would-be
entrepreneurs and farmers and appeals to those with Christian
values, said Miroslav Bartos, a People's Party candidate and one of
the parliamentarians appointed in December to replace resigning
Communist deputies.
   Communist spokesman Josef Hora said his party, which ruled from
1948 until last year, might get 10 percent to 12 percent of the
vote. The party claims a membership of 900,000 in the population of
15.5 million.
   Hora complained that critics don't take the party's ``renewal''
seriously and still blame it for the repressions of the past.

   ``Dick Tracy'' the movie opens in nearly
2,000 theaters June 15 amid a media megablitz that rivals last
summer's ``Batman.''
   But will Warren Beatty's film about the square-jawed flatfoot
with the yellow fedora match the $252 million domestic gross
amassed by the caped crusader?
   Fingers crossed, Walt Disney Co. is tossing a huge premiere at
Disney World in Florida with 3,000 journalists expected to attend.
Following trailers that have appeared in 2,000 theaters since
Christmas, TV commercials will be unleashed on the nation's
networks. Merchandise, including Tracy's wrist-watch radio, will
flood the market.
   But skeptics point to some negatives.
   The comic strip Dick Tracy, once featured in 500 newspapers, now
appears in 150 and is little known by today's young, moviegoing
audience. And what's worse, the young crowd hardly knows Beatty,
53, who has made only two films in nine years, the last being the
quintessential bomb ``Ishtar.'' His other was the critically
acclaimed ``Reds,'' in 1981. He co-starred with Diane Keaton and
received an Academy Award for best director.
   Another problem is that although ``Dick Tracy'' co-star Madonna
may be a megastar in pop music, her last few movies were
megadisasters: ``Shanghai Surprise'' and ``Who's That Girl.''
   However, Barrie Osborne, executive producer of ``Dick Tracy,''
takes an upbeat view.
   ``The picture should attract a wide audience, because it can be
appreciated on different levels,'' he said in an interview. ``The
younger audience can enjoy the prosthetic characters (Pruneface,
Flattop, etc.), lots of action and beautiful color. And they
certainly know Madonna.
   ``The older audience can appreciate the wit and the appearance
of the film; much of it was derived from post-expressionist
paintings _ a `Three Penny Opera'-Bertolt Brecht look. ... And
Warren can bring that (older) audience as well.''
   Disney plans to issue graphic novelizations _ spruced-up comic
books _ of ``Dick Tracy'' to bring some sort of awareness to the
movie and character.
   ``Dick Tracy'' was the creation of Chester Gould, who drew
cartoons for Chicago papers. He began submitting comic strip ideas
to Joseph Patterson, publisher of the New York Daily News. Gould
finally clicked with ``Plainclothes Tracy,'' a hawk-nosed,
straight-arrow detective who Patterson renamed Dick. The strip made
its debut in the Detroit Mirror on Oct. 4, 1931, and the Daily News
eight days later.
   The comic strip featured blood, bullets and a menacing menagerie
of villains with memorable names. Flattop, Flyface, Measles,
Mumbles and more have threatened the intrepid two-fisted Tracy for
nearly 60 years.
   Tracy, his sweetheart Tess Trueheart and his grotesque enemies
became American icons in the 1930s and '40s. Low-budget movies and
serials and a short-run TV series helped fill the country's
fascination with Gould's denizens of the underworld.
   ``Dick Tracy,'' according to Beatty, had its beginnings in 1977
when producers Art Linson and Floyd Mutrux bought film rights from
the Tribune Syndicate. They made a deal with Paramount Pictures,
which enlisted Universal Pictures to co-produce. Various packages
were proposed, including projects with directors Steven Spielberg,
John Landis, Richard Benjamin and Walter Hill, and stars Harrison
Ford, Clint Eastwood, Richard Gere, Tom Selleck and Mel Gibson.
   Beatty became involved in 1983, but Paramount reportedly balked
at his pay demands. Five years later, Michael Eisner and Jeff
Katzenberg had moved from Paramount to Disney, and they revived
``Tracy'' with Beatty, adding certain fiscal restraints (``Ishtar''
cost $40 million).
   No one at Disney is saying how much ``Dick Tracy'' cost. Reports
range from $23 million to $30 million, considerably less than other
summer epics such as ``Total Recall,'' a reported $50 million;
``Die Hard 2,'' $60 million plus; and ``Days of Thunder,'' $55
million plus.
   ``It was a modestly budgeted film,'' insists executive producer
Osborne, a veteran of such bloated budgets as ``Apocalypse Now''
and ``The Cotton Club,'' both made by Francis Coppola.
   ``It was all filmed on the back lot and on sets that were
constructed. The film was made on budget _ within the contingency.''
   The contingency, according to reports, was that Beatty would
have to sacrifice part of his take for exceeding the budget.
   Osborne, 46, who began in films as a Directors Guild trainee,
joined ``Dick Tracy'' in September 1988. He had not worked
previously with Beatty, but he soon learned how the
producer-director-star operated.
   ``Warren acts as a conductor,'' said Osborne. ``He is very
collaborative, likes to get people together and listen to their
ideas. Then he selects what he wants.
   ``The look of the film was his idea. He wanted to achieve the
same quality of the Sunday comic strip. When there was a red, it
was the same red throughout, the same green, etc. It took some
convincing when (cinematographer) Vittorio Storaro and (production
designer) Richard Sylbert came on board.
   ``The limited-color pallette was hard on (costume designer)
Milena Canonero; she came in with cloth samples in 10 shades of
blue, 10 shades of green. Warren told her he wanted one shade only.
It was a tough challenge, but it helps the film. The production
design of most films is anchored in reality. Because of the
grotesque characters in `Dick Tracy,' we needed devices to tell the
audience that it was not reality.''
   A major attraction of ``Dick Tracy'' is the appearance of
well-known stars in wild makeups, Osborne believes. They go
unbilled, but their identities are an open secret: Al Pacino as mob
boss Big Boy Caprice, Dustin Hoffman as Mumbles, James Caan as Ribs.
   Among those who are billed: Glenne Headly, Tess Trueheart; Mandy
Patinkin, 88 Keys; Charles Durning, Police Chief Brandon; William
Forsythe, Flattop; Dick Van Dyke, the district attorney; Paul
Sorvino, Lips Manlis; Estelle Parsons, Mrs. Trueheart.
   Beatty considered several actresses for the role of the
seductive moll, Breathless Mahoney, before deciding on his close
friend Madonna, who argued that the role was similar to her own
onstage persona. Beatty agreed, eschewing the usual readings and
tests.
   Madonna's biggest challenge, she says in publicity material, was
singing the five Stephen Sondheim songs: ``It was a great learning
experience for me because when I first heard the music I panicked.
`I can't sing these songs; they're too difficult,' I said.
   ``But Stephen was very helpful and generous and gave me a lot of
encouragement. They are great songs. I wish I could write songs
like that.''
   Beatty's challenge, says Osborne, was directing the actor Warren
Beatty: ``It is actually not impossible to direct yourself. Warren
was able to watch a video playback after each scene, but mostly he
relied on the reaction of people around the camera, like Richard
(Sylbert) and Vittorio (Storaro).''
   ``Dick Tracy'' was tested before audiences away from major film
centers in large cities, and the reaction was ``great,'' said
Osborne. Only a few cuts were made to tighten the film to its
100-minute running time.
   Then the labs started turning out the 200 70mm, six-sound-track
prints that will play major theaters, and hundreds of 35mm,
two-track versions that will appear in the rest of film houses in
the United States and Canada.
   All that remains to be seen is whether or not Dick Tracy will go
from funnies flatfoot to big screen scream.

<TEXT>
   The Warren Beatty-Madonna movie may be
attracting a lot of hoopla, but Dick Tracy is no newcomer to the
screen.
   Tracy purists may prefer ``Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome,'' circa
1947, in which the fabled flatfoot does battle with the great Boris
Karlorff. Or maybe ``Dick Tracy vs. Cueball,'' a low-budget 1946
flick in which the detective takes on a bald smuggler.
   Then there are two other RKO features of the mid-1940s that
starred Ralph Byrd or Morgan Conway as the steel-jawed, hawk-nosed
sleuth. Or, see Dick Tracy as an FBI agent in ``Dick Tracy's
G-Men,'' a 1939 yarn with Byrd chasing the evil Zarnoff.
   If you have the patience, you could watch four serials, dating
from 1937 to 1941, with Byrd as Chester Gould's comic-strip hero.
   Beatty's rediscovery of Dick Tracy follows the pattern of recent
Hollywood times: Filmmakers have been exploiting long-establish
characters of comic strips and books, giving them a modern look for
today's audiences. ``Batman'' is the biggest success story thus far.
   Created by Bob Kane in 1939, ``Batman'' flew onto the big screen
with serials in 1943 and 1949. The sensation of the 1965-67
television series led to a 1966 feature, also starring Adam West
and Burt Ward. Last year a hyped-up ``Batman,'' starring Jack
Nicholson and Michael Keaton, proved a huge moneymaker.
   ``Superman'' dates back to 1940s serials, a 1951 quickie
``Superman and the Mole Men'' and the subsequent TV series starring
George Reeves. Christopher Reeve took over the cape in the 1978
epic ``Superman.'' It was a huge hit, followed by three sequels
with diminishing results.
   ``Little Orphan Annie'' first hit the screen in 1932 with Mitzi
Green as the carrot-topped waif. Then _ gloryoskee _ ``Annie''
became a hit Broadway musical in the 1970s. Its success was
repeated in a 1982 movie, directed by John Huston, of all people,
and starring Albert Finney, Carol Burnett and Bernadette Peters.
   Not all comic heroes and heroines have done as well in recent
years. ``Flash Gordon'' was an expensive failure in 1980, helping
along the eventual collapse of Dino de Laurentiis' American
enterprise. ``Popeye'' bombed in 1980 despite the best efforts of
Robin Williams to imitate the one-eye spinach fancier. ``Brenda
Starr,'' with Brooke Shields as the resourceful reporter, remains
on the shelf after three years, partly because of legal tangles.
   ``Brenda Starr'' was made by New World Pictures, which has since
gone out of business. There are disputes over New World's assets,
and whether or not the movie will be released depends largely on
how the disputes are resolved. But the film has appeared in some
overseas countries.
   Motion pictures and comic strips were born at about the same
time and almost immediately began their association. Hearst
cartoonist Winsor McCay drew his ``Little Nemo'' for the screen in
1911 and followed with ``Gertie the Dinosaur'' in 1914. ``Krazy
Kat,'' ``Bringing Up Father'' and ``The Katzenjammer Kids'' were
other early movie cartoons.
   Comics also contributed characters for live action: ``Ella
Cinders'' (Colleen Moore), 1922; ``Tillie the Toiler'' (Marion
Davies), 1927; ``Skippy'' (Jackie Cooper), 1930; ``Harold Teen''
(Arthur Lake), 1934; and ``Joe Palooka'' (Stewart Erwin), 1934, and
another version in 1946 with Joe Kirkwood, plus sequels.
   Serials, which Hollywood ground out from 1930 to 1950, were
ideal for telling comic book stories. They included: ``Archie,''
``Captain Marvel,'' ``Flash Gordon,'' ``Jungle Jim,'' ``Mandrake
the Magician,'' ``Talespin Tommy,'' ``Brick Bradford'' and ``Terry
and the Pirates.''
   For 10 years starting in 1938, Arthur Lake and Penny Singleton
annually appeared in two ``Blondie'' films, as sandwich-loving
Dagwood Bumstead and his dizzy wife. After his Tarzan days were
over, Johnny Weissmuller made 12 quickies as ``Jungle Jim'' from
1948 to 1955.
   After scoring as a musical on Broadway, ``L'il Abner'' came to
the screen in 1959 with all its Dogpatch characters intact.
``Prince Valiant'' put Robert Wagner in a page-boy wig in 1954.
Bill Mauldin's dogface soldiers Willie and Joe appeared in the 1951
``Up Front'' and did a sequel, ``Back at the Front.''
   Racier comics also have made it to the screen: ``Modesty
Blaise'' (Monica Vitti), 1966; ``Barbarella'' (Jane Fonda) 1968;
and the only X-rated cartoon movie, ``Fritz the Cat'' in 1971.

   Would any hip teen be caught dead wearing a
T-shirt plastered with the profile of a forgotten comic strip cop?
   Warren Beatty may still cause some female fans to swoon, but the
star and director of ``Dick Tracy'' faces a far more difficult
seduction in the youth-driven movie merchandise business.
   Young shoppers are starting to inspect goods decorated with the
likeness of Madonna, who co-stars as Breathless Mahoney in ``Dick
Tracy.'' But Beatty's title character has remained an elusive sale,
some retailers and manufacturers say.
   And while the film itself continues to generate much
anticipation, ``Dick Tracy'' wares are lagging behind retail
products linked to ``The Simpsons,'' ``Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles'' and other TV shows and movies.
   ```Dick Tracy' will in no way come close to `Batman,''' said
Nancy Overfield-Delmar, manager of special event and merchandise
publicity for J.C. Penney. ``The movie may do very well in
theaters. But there is no awareness in stores right now.''
   John Green, president of ``Dick Tracy'' T-shirt licensee Village
Mews, said Walt Disney Co. has been slow to promote the film, with
little expenditures for billboards, television spots and posters.
   ``From a retailers point of view, that's not very good,'' Green
said. ``The `Batman' hype was going a year before the movie came
out. A lot of kids still don't know who Dick Tracy is.''
   Marketing Evaluations, a research firm that studies the appeal
of celebrities and fictional characters, found in a study last year
that Dick Tracy ranked below average. His popularity was below
Wonder Woman, Howdy Doody and Archie.
   Larry Carlat, the editor of Toy &amp; Hobby World, believes young
shoppers will be more interested in Barbie and Nintendo video games
than Beatty and Madonna. But Playmates, a leading toy manufacturer,
thinks ``Dick Tracy'' will outsell ``Batman.''
   As movies, ``Batman'' and ``Dick Tracy'' share several common
elements: Both are based on long-standing comic strips, both have
been adapted into live-action films and both feature recognizable
central characters.
   Yet the merchandising of the two films is wholly different.
   Jack Morrow, vice president of licensing for Applause Inc.,
makers of ``Dick Tracy'' dolls, figurines, mugs and key chains,
said Warner Bros. positioned its ``Batman'' as a fad, not just a
movie. The logo thus became a statement unto itself.
   ```Tracy' didn't have the same warm-up that `Batman' had, and I
attribute that directly to fashion. That yellow and black design
was cool. And `Tracy' doesn't have that,'' Morrow said.
   ``Dick Tracy'' merchandise, retailers and licensees say, will
live or die on the film's performance. If the movie soars, so, too,
will the products. If it bombs, then you can look for ``Dick
Tracy'' products on the discount shelf.
   ```Willow' could have sold a lot of merchandise if the movie was
good,'' said Gary Caplan, a licensing consultant. ```Howard the
Duck' could have sold a lot of products, too, if the movie had
played well.''
   According to trade estimates, ``Batman'' merchandise so far has
claimed retail sales of $650 million. A studio typically enjoys 10
percent of the wholesale revenues generated by the merchandise to
which it holds the copyrights.
   In 1980, licensed products had retail sales of $9.9 billion. By
1989, that figure had surged to $64.6 billion. About $3 billion
worth of merchandise inspired by movies and television programs was
sold last year.
   Even if ``Dick Tracy'' produces wholesale receipts of $100
million, Disney will collect $10 million _ for doing essentially
nothing but negotiating deals and approving artwork. And if kids
wear T-shirts bearing the film's logo, Disney has walking
billboards touting the movie.
   Among the estimated 100 merchandise licenses are yellow fedoras,
wrist walkie-talkies, stretch satin evening wear (as worn by
Madonna's Breathless Mahoney character), shower curtains, drapes,
backpacks, jewelry and a variety of watches. There also will be
three movie-related record albums.
   Will ``Dick Tracy'' be able to get his man at the cash register?
So far, it looks like a tough case.

   ``Triumph of the Spirit'' (RCA-Columbia Home Video. VHS-Beta,
$89.95. Rated R)
   
   ``Triumph of the Spirit'' is as subtle as a right to the jaw
and, at times, just as powerful.
   At other times, it swings and misses.
   A Holocaust film that came out late last year, ``Triumph of the
Spirit'' was nearly forgotten thanks to the near-simultaneous
releases of the acclaimed ``Enemies: A Love Story'' and the
Costa-Gavras drama ``Music Box.''
   But ``Triumph'' couldn't be more different. While those films
are about memory, with the Holocaust a nightmare lurking
off-screen, ``Triumph,'' shot on location in Auschwitz, dares to
show the unshowable.
   The film is based on the true story of Salamo Arouch, the
middleweight boxing champion of the Balkan countries in 1938. After
the Nazis occupied Greece, he and his family and friends were
deported to Auschwitz. Arouch, used by the Nazis to box with other
prisoners, survived and now lives in Israel with his wife, children
and grandchildren.
   ``Triumph'' is relentless, deliberately hard to take, with no
time for the soul-searching of ``Enemies'' or ``Music Box.''
   ``They promised us a new life in Poland,'' Arouch (Willem Dafoe)
recalls. As he speaks, Nazis are squeezing Greek Jews into cattle
cars and shipping them off to their new life _ in Auschwitz.
   Blows, big and small, rain down. The Nazis take their valuables,
shave their heads and make men and women wear the same drab
uniforms. Prisoners are kicked, literally, out of bed each morning
and drag themselves back at night, beaten down by a day of marching
and lifting.
   Screaming matches break out over a pair of shoes. A woman breaks
down and cries as she begs her friend for a few drops of broth.
When Arouch steals a moment with his girlfriend, Allegra (Wendy
Gazelle), he embraces her as if he were a starving man sniffing a
loaf of warm bread.
   The Final Solution is never far away. Gas chambers. Hangings.
Commanders coolly selecting the next round of victims.
   Arouch, however, is spared. He KO's a guard who pushed him down
a hill and becomes a valuable commodity to the commanding officers,
who bet on him in boxing matches with other prisoners. Arouch wins
every fight.
   So ``Triumph'' becomes a story of ``triumphs,'' physical, moral
and spiritual. Arouch is bloodied, but not defeated.
   ``All I have left is my love for Allegra,'' he says after the
camp has been liberated and his family killed. Shoulders slumped,
Arouch exits down a long and empty road, walking gingerly under an
endless gray sky.
   If this video comes up short, don't blame Dafoe, excellent as a
man who learns to duck punches in and out of the ring. Co-stars
Robert Loggia, as Arouch's ailing father, and Edward James Olmos,
the camp gypsy are both solid.
   But Dafoe has to keep a straight face with such lines as ``You
still taste like apricots,'' and ``How can we do this to our
brothers?''
   The direction, by Robert Young (``Dominick and Eugene'') is
unimaginative, and worse, the music soars and swells like the
soundtrack of an old Bette Davis movie _ a symphony seeming to rise
with every tear that falls.
   ``How many rounds?'' Arouch asks when offered the chance to
fight.
   ``Rounds?'' the commander responds. ``No rounds. You fight until
one can't get up.''
   ``Triumph of the Spirit'' lasts a full 15. Give it a split
decision.

   ``Laredo'' (MCA) _ Steve Wariner
   
   Steve Wariner's easygoing ``Laredo'' travels over some familiar
country ground but comes up a winner on the strength of
above-average songs and the singer's ability to convey that he
clearly enjoys the material.
   Using three producers, Wariner shifts comfortably from mid-tempo
ballads to ``lite'' swing, maintaining a pleasant groove that
falters only when he indulges in the sappy sentimentality of ``I
Wanna Go Back,'' a needless lament for the good ol' days.
   Wariner, a staple on the country charts, knows what makes a hit,
and almost everything else on ``Laredo'' sounds groomed for the
radio. ``Precious Thing,'' a bluesy love song, the tear-jerkers
``She's in Love'' and ``There for Awhile'' and the clever ``The
Domino Theory'' appear likely candidates to receive airplay.
   The band is tight (the piano playing is superb throughout _ four
keyboardists are credited), and the digital recording is clear and
uncluttered but not cold.
   All in all, a safe, likable album. If you have to go down the
middle of the road, Steve Wariner's not a bad guy to have along as
a rider.

   ``Dog City'' (Grudge) _ Crack The Sky
   
   With ``Dog City,'' Crack The Sky is guilty of one of rock 'n'
roll's deadly sins: wrapping politically charged messages in dull,
plodding music.
   This band has a lot to say, but who can pay attention to the
words when the music is putting them to sleep? And, despite the
bombast here, who can stay awake through this set?
   This from a band that knows better.
   Never a household name, Crack The Sky does enjoy some cult
status largely on the strength of its 1975 debut, which
successfully mixed John Palumbo's delightfully bizarre songwriting
with quirky, imaginative guitar-based rock.
   None of that here. Palumbo's lyrical sights are on the nation's
social ills _ the homeless, drug abuse, violence _ but his words
are lost in a mix of leaden, hard-rock cliches. Even if you agree
with what he's saying, you may find yourself wanting to join the
other side.
   Only on ``Mr. President,'' in which a children's choir makes a
plea for the government to do something about the homeless, does
the music break away from the muck. It's not nearly enough, though,
to salvage this dog of an album.

   ``Jump for Joy'' (Alligator Records) _ Koko Taylor
   
   The Queen of the Blues meets the King of Gonzo. Talk about
strange bedfellows. But in proving again that she's no pretender to
the crown, Koko Taylor rips into Ted Nugent's ``Hey Baby'' as if it
were one of her own. Maybe it's not so strange. After all, rock 'n'
roll has its roots in the blues.
   Taylor's 12th album, ``Jump for Joy,'' is a strong follow to
1987's ``Live From Chicago _ An Audience With the Queen.'' If
history repeats itself, Taylor could be up for her second Grammy
award (her last three releases have been nominated).
   This is standard fare from Taylor, marked by tough, from-the-gut
vocals and a solid band that boogies. Lonnie Brooks slides in for a
duet and some six-string work on ``It's a Dirty Job.'' Taylor mixes
five originals with five covers.
   The bulk of Taylor's blues are in the good-time vein. On ``Time
Will Tell,'' however, she sings with raw emotion that makes her
loss from the death a year ago of Richard ``Pops'' Taylor, her
husband of 30 years, nearly palpable.

   Schooled since birth in the discipline of the
theater, Amy Irving sought interviews to promote her new movie only
days before delivering her second child.
   She already was the mother of one of the most famous _ and
richest _ boys in the world, Max Spielberg, whose father is her
former husband, film tycoon Steven Spielberg. Irving and Spielberg
were divorced last year.
   Max now has a half-brother, Gabriel Davis Baretto, born May 4 to
Amy and Bruno Baretto, director of her new film. Max also has
another half-sibling, since Spielberg and Kate Capshaw became the
parents of a daughter, Sasha, on May 14. But that's a different
story.
   Like Spielberg-Capshaw, Baretto-Irving are not married. ``But we
plan to be,'' declares Irving.
   Her new movie is a Paramount Pictures release, ``A Show of
Force.'' Based on Anne Nelson's book ``Murder Under Two Flags,'' it
delves into the political intrigue surrounding the murder of two
young men in 1978 in Puerto Rico. The alleged coverup caused a
government scandal that apparently still has reverberations.
   ``The script is very close to the facts of the case,'' Irving
said. ``There was some license that we took in telling the story,
and there were some demands that we do not use real names. There
were rumors that the American government is trying not to expose
this film too much because it does come down pretty heavily on them.
   ``The fact that the two boys were set up to look like
Cuban-backed terrorists and then murdered in cold blood has been
proven. How high up the influence goes and who was involved is
still under investigation.''
   The actress admitted her own ignorance of Puerto Rico before
making the film _ ``I even asked what currency they used.'' Her
stay there provided an education, and she concludes with
understatement: ``I don't think that the situation there is one
that America has helped.''
   Like many of today's film heroines, Irving plays a television
reporter. A widow with two children, her investigation ``puts her
life in jeopardy, puts her family's life in jeopardy and makes her
question her own vision of what America was; she seeks the truth
and comes into her own strength in seeking the truth.''
   Her role as Kate Ryan de Melendez is the mainstay of the plot,
which also involves Andy Garcia as the prosecutor, Lou Diamond
Phillips as an undercover agent and Robert Duvall as the television
station manager. Also in the cast is Irving's mother, Priscilla
Pointer.
   With an actress mother and a father who was a distinguished
stage director, Amy Irving grew up in the theater. The late Jules
Irving was artistic director of San Francisco's American Repertory
Theater when Amy was born in Palo Alto, Calif., 37 years ago. She
made her stage debut at 9 months in ``Rumplestiltskin,'' trained at
her father's theater and later at the London Academy of Music and
Dramatic Art.
   Over the years, Irving has divided her time between stage
(``Amadeus,'' ``Heartbreak House'') and screen (``Carrie,''
``Yentl,'' ``Crossing Delancey''). Daughter of one director and
former wife of another, it seemed inevitable she would fall under
the spell of her ``A Show of Force'' director.
   ``I met Bruno before the film,'' she related. ``He flew up from
Brazil about a year ago March, and we talked about the film. I had
seen his `Dona Flora and Her Two Husbands,' and he showed me other
of his Brazilian films; he has made nine there. All of his films
have a central character of a very strong woman, a woman who
travels through some kind of journey in life. In each one, the
performances were so impressive that I couldn't wait to be directed
by him.
   ``We had a wonderful experience making the film, and afterward
more happened. It turned out to be a grand experience in my life.''
   After their marriage, she says, they plan to make their home
here; she also has a house in New Mexico, and he will keep his base
in Brazil.
   ```A Show of Force' is Bruno's first English-language film, and
he plans to come to America and pursue his career here,'' Irving
said. ``He got tired of people `reading' his films; all his films
are subtitled (outside Brazil and Portugal). To be able to have
people watch the faces as the story unfolds is something that he's
wanted for a long time.
   ``We'll go to Brazil. We've spent some time there, and I'm
learning Portuguese. His 13-year-old daughter lives with us, and
our life is pretty international now. Max has already learned how
to ask for a chocolate cookie in Portuguese.''

   Grace Lai stumbled into her artistic passion. But
she can't afford to stumble now.
   Lai spends much of her time 30 stories or more above the ground,
sometimes near open walls and elevator shafts, just to get the
right perspective for her paintings.
   Hardhat on head, she totes her studio on a handcart, painting
watercolors of Chicago's changing skyline and the workers who
change it.
   She's been working at the North State Street site of the
American Medical Association's new headquarters for about two
years, watching excavators, welders, steelworkers, cement workers,
plumbers, electrical contractors, carpenters, tilesetters,
pipefitters and more.
   ``No one has ever tried to document what they do,'' Lai says.
``This is something they can take home and show their wives and
say, `Look, I really DO work.' ''
   Lai, 62, and her husband, Harry, operated Acme Studios at
various Chicago locations for 25 years until his death in 1985. She
then decided to return to school and try to support herself with
her art.
   She sketched her first construction site in 1985. It was on her
first day back in art school when her bus dropped her at the
42-story office tower at 190 N. LaSalle, the first Chicago building
designed by the architect Philip Johnson.
   Transit schedules forced her to arrive two hours early for class
at the American Academy of Art, and she filled the time sketching.
   Several weeks later, the chief site inspector noticed her, liked
her work and made her the ``official'' artist for the construction
site.
   The current building is the third site she's painted. Between
Johnson's building and her current site, she climbed and painted
the 50-story tower at 35 W. Wacker Drive that houses the Leo
Burnett Co. advertising agency.
   Before she found her passion for painting construction sites,
she used the only subject of which she could think.
   ``I used to just sketch people on the buses back and forth from
visiting my father in the nursing home,'' she says. ``But it was a
chancy thing. If people found out you were sketching them and
didn't like it, you took your life in your hands. But most of them
were delighted.''
   Her original watercolors sell for $400 to $500. She has 8-by
10-inch prints made of each one and sells the prints to workers for
$15 to $40. She sells enough to ``get by,'' she says.
   She leaves space around the construction scenes in many of her
works, which she fills with portraits of individual workers or
crews. The workers often pose briefly during their coffee breaks.
   ``When are you gonna do me, Gracie?'' one worker asks. ``Any
time,'' she says. They agree on a painting and a time and part
company, each expressing thanks.
   John Buck Co. and Miller-Klutznick-Davis-Gray Co., partners in
the building, plan to show her works at the building's grand
opening, tentatively scheduled in August.
   Lai will have 25 to 30 full-size watercolors ready, all showing
different phases of construction. She hopes the show will bring
recognition and a wider audience.
   It will be her first show outside the Pallet and Chisel, a group
of Chicago artists with a studio in the downtown Loop who combine
their efforts to promote local art. Her paintings now are available
only at her in-home company, Advertising Art, and at the City of
Chicago store in the Loop.
   ``Success for me would be being respected by fellow artists.
This may end up affording me a living, but I don't want to turn out
garbage,'' she says.
   ``Most importantly, I want to be an artist. It doesn't have to
be in construction. I'd like to go into a paper mill or an atomic
plant, things people hear about and never see. You have to be
half-insane to do it, but my gosh, can you find anything more
exciting?''
   The excitement _ and potential danger _ of being hundreds of
feet above the ground has never caused her any trouble, says Lai,
who signs a release at each site. A contractor involved with each
site has insured her under his company policy.
   ``My only problems are off the site. Last year, I spent four
months on crutches because I was doing aerobics and I landed wrong.
So aerobics can go. I'll walk,'' she said.
   However, the time on crutches was even helpful.
   ``After I came back, my painting changed entirely. I became a
lot more thoughtful. I did whole scenes instead of just throwing
things together. I think it was being away for so long; it made me
realize what I was missing.''
   Construction workers help her stay out of the way, she says.
   ``You kind of sense when things are starting to move, and
usually somebody will come by and say, `Gracie, scat!''' She
laughed again.
   Lai worked in December when she had to add alcohol to her paints
to keep them from freezing and had to cut the fingers out of her
gloves on her drawing hand to handle her pens and brushes.
   And she didn't quit when her friends told her she wouldn't
finish art school, or when her classmates began placing bets on
when she'd drop out. She graduated last year.
   Her tenacity has provided her with a living, experience and
friendships.
   ``I know so many of my friends who say, `Nobody ever comes to
see me.' You've got to out and meet the world.''

   After 35 years, Bo Diddley wants his payday.
   It's nice to be called a legend. It was fun playing the White
House. Induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was
flattering, and telling center fielder Bo Jackson that he didn't
know diddley was a laugh.
   But now, Bo wants more. Bo wants cash.
   ``I feel like America owes me something more than just saying,
`Oh, the great Bo Diddley,''' the 61-year-old artist said in a
recent interview.
   ``Elvis Presley copied me, and I used to wouldn't say anything
about it. When they found the white boy who could do what I was
doing, then they shoved me back in the corner and he went on to Las
Vegas, where all the money was. But Bo Diddley never got a chance
to get involved,'' he says.
   ``I have no bitterness against Elvis or any other white
entertainer that records black music, but I think there should be
some recognition as to where he got the stuff from. Don't come up
and steal my stuff and say you wrote it, because that's a lie.''
   It's not just Elvis who rode the Bo Diddley beat to success. The
trademark guitar sound that he's played during six decades anchors
the Who's ``Magic Bus,'' Bruce Springsteen's ``She's the One,''
Buddy Holly's ``Not Fade Away,'' Johnny Otis' ``Willie and the Hand
Jive,'' Elvis Costello's ``Lover's Walk'' and George Michaels'
``Faith.''
   Diddley _ like other rhythm and blues artists in the late 1940s
and '50s _ was paid a flat fee for his recordings and received no
royalty payments on record sales. But over the years, he's found
his music on records around the world, ``in places I ain't never
heard of in my life.''
   ``But where's the money?'' he says. ``The thing that hurts me so
bad is that every time I come up with something it looks like
somebody jumped on it, they make money with it and I can't get
arrested with it.
   ``Everybody says, `Oh, you've got such a negative attitude.'
Guys can always tell Bo: `You shouldn't be hollering about that.
That's water under the bridge.' Yes, it's water under the bridge,
but my kids were deprived of a lot of things because the water went
under the bridge, and I'm not at all happy about that.''
   Diddley has been entertaining almost from the day he was born
Otha Ellis Bates on Dec. 30, 1928, in McComb, Miss. He was later
adopted by his mother's cousin and took on the name Ellis McDaniel,
which his wife calls him to this day.
   When he was 5, the family moved to Chicago, where he learned the
violin at the Ebenezer Baptist Church. He learned the guitar at age
10. He entertained passers-by on street corners, taking inspiration
from the rhythm and blues bands playing in local clubs.
   In his early teens, he played on Chicago's Maxwell Street and
acquired his stage name, a moniker derived from a ``bo diddley'' _
a one-stringed guitar. For four years beginning in 1951, he played
at the 708 Club on the South Side.
   In July 1955, he was signed to the Checker record label and his
first single, ``Bo Diddley,'' was a success. He appeared on ``The
Ed Sullivan Show''; shortly thereafter, radio disc jockey Alan
Freed called his music ``rock 'n' roll.''
   ``I was first to be called rock 'n' roll. Not Little Richard,
not Elvis Presley, not Buddy Holly. None of them. I was the first
one,'' Diddley says.
   He stood out on stage with his homemade square guitar,
dark-rimmed glasses, black leather jacket and black hat with a
diamond-shaped turquoise pinned to the front.
   ``I'm an entertainer. I'm a showman. I'm not a guitarist,'' says
Diddley. ``When you're dealing with cats like myself you're dealing
with a real entertainer, a person who knows what the stage is built
for.''
   It's not the same at home, where he's Ellis to his wife and ``Bo
Pop'' to his grandchildren. He's also no rebel off stage, serving a
stint in the 1970s as a sheriff in New Mexico. He considers himself
patriotic.
   ``I'm here, baby. I'm a piece of this dirt or whatever it is. I
didn't come from no Africa,'' he says.
   Sometimes, he can be found building a porch in Deboe, Fla., for
his 70-by 24-foot trailer home, surrounded by rose bushes, fruit
trees and grass.
   He says the home is so big it makes him feel like ``nobility,''
but he knows what it can connote to some people.
   ``It's comfortable. It doesn't bother me what people think
because there's so many people that live in those trailers that got
more money than Bo Diddley. I am a regular person,'' he says.
   He is still paying for a large home in Hawthorne, Fla., which he
moved away from when a previous marriage ended. Someone, he says,
should do a benefit for Bo Diddley to clear him of his $300,000
debt.
   ``At 55, I couldn't retire. I couldn't even think about it,'' he
says.
   Meanwhile, he'll keep touring the country, playing here and
there and mostly near his home in the same sort of venues where
he's been displaying his act for parts of five decades.
   With all his business failings, one of Diddley's greatest
achievements came last year when he was in the Nike sneaker
commercial.
   ``The Nike commercial did more for me than anything done for me
in the last 20 years. Everybody knows Bo Diddley now, just because
I said, `You don't know Diddley.' That's all I said. I ain't done
nothing else. I don't understand this part of it.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Code of the West Lives in Medoff's Plays</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto
^By RICHARD BENKE</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tall stranger rode into town and
stayed because he found what's left of the Code of the West was
still alive in Las Cruces.
   He packed no gun. He had a typewriter.
   A recent Stanford University graduate school alumnus in 1966,
Mark Medoff drove into Las Cruces in a black '62 Volkswagen beetle
with no idea that he would become one of America's premier
playwrights.
   Florida-born Medoff, just turned 50, is a Westerner now. He
teaches screenwriting, playwriting, acting and directing at New
Mexico State University and writes on his computer in the
wood-paneled library of his Spanish colonial home.
   The author of the Tony-winning ``Children of a Lesser God'' and
Obie-winning ``When You Comin' Back, Red Ryder?'' says many of his
plays are about Old West values and the fall of the hero, as Medoff
recalls from growing up in Miami Beach.
   ``I think we don't have heroes in this country particularly
anymore,'' Medoff said during an interview at his home. ``We have
demystified all our heroes. We don't have people we look up to.''
   He's not particularly optimistic about what has replaced them.
   His new play, ``Stumps,'' is the second sequel to ``Red Ryder.''
In it, Vietnam amputee Stephen Ryder and a wheelchair-ridden
comrade try to sell a screenplay to a pornography producer, a
sociopath in clergyman's clothing, who brutalizes them and Ryder's
Vietnamese wife, Lin.
   After two New Mexico productions, ``Stumps'' is ready for larger
venues, and Medoff has started sending it out.
   The challenge of ``Stumps'' was to create an educated,
articulate character without a conscience, the Rev. Calvin Rhodes,
who'd be seen as human, not allegorical.
   ``I guess my greatest fear about Calvin Rhodes is that he's not
simply an aberration but that he's a kind of character we may see
proliferate around us in our lives,'' Medoff says.
   Ryder's luck has been lousy with sociopaths. In ``When You
Comin' Back, Red Ryder?'', a gunman holds patrons of a desert diner
hostage and wounds one. The play's roots were Westerns.
   ``The bad guys ride into town, they go into the saloon and they
start tormenting the guy who drinks milk,'' he says.
   In the first sequel, ``The Heart Outright,'' we learn the gunman
later was killed by state police.
   But the author has met such bad guys only in his head. ``I've
always maintained that I have all the worst of my worst characters
in me, and I think we all do.''
   He recalls a happy childhood listening to the real Red Ryder on
the radio, along with ``The Lone Ranger'' and ``Straight Arrow.''
   ``My father's a doctor; my mother's a psychologist. My father
was a superb pianist; my mother's a very fine painter. The house
was always full of music and art and books, and it was a very nice
upbringing ... a very civilized, congenial upbringing, and yet I
think that in a way we in my generation all bridled against our
very civility.''
   ``The Wild One'' with Marlon Brando impressed him as a
teen-ager. In that film, biker Brando half-terrorizes,
half-mesmerizes a small-town diner.
   ``I was about 15 and looking at my upper-middle-class, Jewish,
well-educated self, thinking, `God, I wish ... I had the guts and
the wherewithal to put on black leather and get on a hog and go out
and make trouble.''
   Instead, the 6-foot-tall Medoff channeled his aggressions into
sports, tore up a knee and had to quit football. He now has a
passion for golf.
   He was also 15 when he started writing prose. With support from
his parents _ but with their warning about the vagaries of literary
life _ he studied creative writing at the University of Miami. One
of his stories was published by Random House in ``Prize College
Stories'' of 1963. He got his master's degree at Stanford and
accepted a position, at first reluctantly, at New Mexico State.
   It worried him that it was an agricultural school ``with cows
right on campus,'' but he soon found it a more diverse barnyard:
The first people he met were involved in the Las Cruces Community
Theater.
   One was actor Bill Frankfather who suggested Medoff write a play
and they'd put it on. ``So I did, and they did and that was the
beginning.''
   Frankfather played Rhodes in the New Mexico Repertory Theatre
production of ``Stumps'' this winter in Santa Fe and Albuquerque.
   The nurturing and support from campus and community and the
spirit of the Old West keep Medoff in New Mexico. He likes his
plays to succeed in New York, but he prefers to stay here.
   ``I have an affinity for the Old West, and I think there's still
a residual civility here. ... There's just something about the
warmth of the people.''
   He met his wife, Stephanie, in one of his literature courses.
They have three children: Debra, 22; Rachel, 15; and Jessica, 11.
Parenthood changed Medoff as a writer.
   ``The world is so much with us, and the world is so full of
violence and seems to be so much fuller today than it was yesterday
of a lack of conscience that, for my children, I know I'm trying to
write material that brings people face to face with that lack of
conscience in hopes of fostering change,'' he said.
   When a brother of one of Medoff's students was murdered several
years ago, Medoff created ``The Homage That Follows,'' which was to
have been his statement on sociopaths.
   But he became sympathetic to the killer. ``Even though what he
did was unforgivable. It became clear he was not without
conscience.''
   So ``Stumps'' was summoned up from the depths of his anger.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Lorrie Morgan's Year of Tragedy and Triumph</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>

   Keith Whitley and Lorrie Morgan seemed
the perfect pair when they married.
   They were both singers with blossoming careers. When she was
away from home singing in concert, he always sent flowers or called
to ease the separation. He planned to adopt her 8-year-old daughter
by a previous marriage.
   Morgan was the precocious child of a Grand Ole Opry star and was
so beautiful and talented she had been voted runnerup in the Miss
Nashville Pageant.
   Some people called them ``Mr. and Mrs. Country Music.''
   Then Whitley died last May of an accidental alcohol overdose.
Morgan became a widow at age 29, losing her husband just as her
career took off.
   She recently talked about the past year, a year ``filled with a
lot of highs and lows,'' in an interview in the conference room at
RCA Records, a room named in memory of her husband.
   ``I finally have something I've waited for all my life _ the
success of this career,'' she said. ``But I also lost part of my
life that I had lived for and that was a fairy tale marriage with
Keith. It was every woman's dream _ to have a fairy tale marriage.
   ``If I had to take my choice, I'd rather have him than anything.
But it's not my decision to make.''
   Morgan's album, ``Leave the Light On,'' was certified gold in
May for sales of a half million, placing it ahead of dozens of
others, including Dolly Parton's highly promoted ``White
Limozeen.'' Morgan's ``Five Minutes'' was a No. 1 country music
single in April. ``Dear Me'' was another hit single last summer _
just weeks after Whitley died.
   At a time she should be exhilarated because of career
achievement, Morgan finds herself searching to explain her frame of
mind in a year of tragedy and triumph.
   ``I don't know that I'm bitter,'' she said. ``You know that old
saying, `God never puts anything on you that you and he can't
handle.' There's a reason for all this. I'll probably never know
the reason until I go up to heaven and ask.''
   ```Confused' is probably a better word as to why it happened,
the way it happened, when it happened.''
   The night after her husband was buried, she sang on the Opry as
a tribute to him.
   ``It was real difficult,'' she recalled. ``It was difficult just
to breathe, to open my eyes. It was something I felt I had to do to
get on with life. It would have been very easy to sit home and mope
and cry and stay shut up in a room. But I needed to be around
friends, not closed in.''
   Within two weeks, she was back on the road traveling to
concerts. She used her late husband's bus.
   ``It was an eerie feeling. I could picture him coming out of the
back any minute.''
   Five months after Whitley's death, she tearfully accepted his
award on network TV for single record of the year from the Country
Music Association for his ``I'm No Stranger to the Rain.''
   This year, it may be her own award she accepts. Her ``Leave the
Light On'' has been in the top 10 of the country music charts.
   She will have performed live before an estimated 1.2 million
people by year's end as part of a lengthy concert tour with country
superstars Alabama and the hottest country act in four years, Clint
Black.
   Two duets she recorded with Whitley before he died will be
released soon by RCA.
   Morgan now is reaping the rewards of a singing career that began
when she performed on the Opry at age 13. At just 14, she was
singing on the road with her father, Opry star George Morgan. At
16, she had her own band and was a touring act.
   ``I've paid a lot of dues, learned a lot, seen people come and
go, what to do and what not to do. I think I'm ready for the
success I'm having. I guess this is the big final test when you
have your exams,'' Morgan said.
   ``I'm not sure I can point to the one thing for my success, but
a lot of years has helped.''
   Whitley, 33, has remained in the public eye because of the
continued release of his songs.
   ``He's going to be one of the greats,'' Morgan said. ``There may
be someone come around who will have more success than Keith did,
but there never will be another better singer. Never.''

   The Lincoln Center Council, which represents the
center's 11 artistic organizations, has announced its support for
the beleaguered National Endowment of the Arts.
   The 25-year-old NEA came under attack last year from Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., when it gave support to an exhibit of works by the
late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. The show last June at the
Corcoran Gallery in Washington was canceled after some called it
obscene, resulting in a move by Congress to limit federal funds to
the arts.
   The NEA distributes money yearly allocated to it by Congress to
large and small arts organizations and to artists. Last year,
restrictions were written into the endowment's appropriations bill
barring it from supporting artwork considered obscene.
   Lincoln Center has begun placing inserts in programs for its
Great Performers concerts asking supporters of ``a thriving and
culturally diverse'' arts community to write to their congressional
representatives in support of the NEA.
   The Lincoln Center council is made up of all the New York arts
center's organizations, including the Metropolitan Opera and the
New York Philharmonic and New York City Ballet.

   Inflation in the 12-nation European Community
jumped 0.9 percent during April, boosted by sharply higher consumer
prices in Britain, Portugal and Greece, the EC's statistical agency
Eurostat reported Tuesday.
   The increase was faster than a 0.5 percent rise in March and up
from a 0.8 percent increase a year earlier.
   Eurostat said the consumer price index for the EC as a whole
rose 5.4 percent in the 12 months to April, higher than a 4.7
percent increase in the United States and a 2.4 percent rise in
Japan during the same period.
   Eurostat said a 3.0 percent surge in Britain accounted for a
large part of the EC-wide increase.
   Britain's April figure was pushed up by the introduction of the
community charge on adults, or so-called poll tax, rises in excise
duties on alcohol, tobacco, and gasoline, as well as increases in
public utilities, rents, and in seasonal food costs.
   The 3 percent April increase in Britain was the highest since
April 1980, when the consumer price index rose 3.4 percent,
Eurostat said.
   Eurostat said a 1.7 percent jump in Greece and a 1.2 percent
increase in Portugal also drove up the inflation rate for the
Community as a whole.
   In the year to April, Greece had the highest EC inflation, at
17.9 percent. Portugal had price increases of 12.9 percent, Britain
9.4 percent, Spain 7.0 percent, Italy 6.2 percent, Ireland 4.2
percent, Luxembourg 3.6 percent, Belgium and France 3.2 percent,
Denmark 2.4 percent, West Germany 2.3 percent, and the Netherlands
2.1 percent.

<HEAD>Mexicana Buying 30 Airbus Planes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexicana de Aviacion has agreed to buy 30
Airbus A320-200 jets for $1.1 billion.
   Mexicana and Airbus Industrie, a European consortium, signed a
letter of intention Monday in the presence of President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari at the Presidential Palace.
   Airbus also signed a technical agreement with the airline that
calls for construction of a maintenance base in Guadalajara, 360
miles northwest of the capital.
   Airbus will begin delivering the new passenger jets next year,
and the two parties will negotiate for possible purchase of another
20 planes, according to a statement by the airline. The A320-200
seats from 130 to 179 passengers.
   Among the 30 new planes being purchased, 16 are considered sold
and another 14 are being purchased on option, depending on need,
the statement said.
   Mexicana hopes to nearly double its fleet from 48 planes to 82
by the end of the decade, Mexicana President Carlos Abedrop Davia
said.
   Abedrop said the company has gone through a major restructuring
to improve service. ``Now we are beginning the second important
task: updating our fleet.''
   Mexicana's present fleet is comprised of 42 Boeing 727-200's and
six DC-10s. The airline has said it plans to sell some of its older
planes.
   Mexicana previously announced that it plans to expand domestic
and foreign routes next year. Mexicana presently flies to the
United States and Latin America.
   Formerly government owned, Mexicana was sold to private
investors last September as part of the government's privatization
plan.
   Airbus Industrie is owned by partners in West Germany, France,
Britain and Spain.

   Tektronix Inc. announced Tuesday it will
lay off about 1,300 employees as part of a restructuring designed
to offset the electronics manufacturer's financial problems.
   Under the restructuring, the 44-year-old company said it plans
to sell or close some of its test and measurement operations and
non-television communications businesses.
   The layoffs will reduce the company's employment to about 13,000
by August, Tektronix said in a statement.
   ``These steps are part of a broad effort to place Tek on a solid
financial footing for the long term,'' said Robert Lundeen,
chairman and chief executive officer.
   The restructuring and layoffs will result in a one-time charge
of about $70 million in the fourth quarter ended May 26, the
company said.
   Tektronix has suffered net losses or only marginal profits in
recent quarters on flat or declining sales. In the quarter ended in
March, the loss was a record $24.5 million. The company's annual
sales are about $1.4 billion.
   Longtime President David P. Friedley resigned in April at the
board's request, and Lundeen assumed the title of chief executive
officer.
   The company declined to specify which businesses will be sold,
but said the process would begin immediately.
   Tektronix also said it is exploring the possibility of
partnerships to enhance the market position and performance of its
Visual Systems television equipment unit.
   Tektronix also said it has ended discussions with Sony Corp.
concerning the possible sale of the company's Grass Valley Group
subsidiary.

   Recent sharp increases in the prices of food
staples have led several states to cut food allotments or drop
people from welfare rolls.
   The cost of milk, orange juice, cereal, eggs and infant formula
has risen 8 percent in the first half of this fiscal year, four
times the rate predicted by the Federal Food and Nutrition Service,
The New York Times reported today.
   The price increases have stretched the $2.1 billion that the
federal Women, Infants and Children program spends on 4.5 million
new and expectant mothers.
   As a result, the states, which administer the program, have had
to either reduce the food allotment, reduce the number of
participants or both.
   Federal officials said they did not know how many people had
been affected by the cuts, the Times said.
   F. Phillip Shanholtzer, spokesman for the Food and Nutrition
Service, said the inflation has ``outstripped everyone's
predictions.''
   Officials blamed the price increases, such as a 13.3 percent
rise in the cost of orange juice and 5.9 percent for cereals, on
natural effects such as the drought of 1988 and the December freeze
in Florida.
   Texas and Missouri are not accepting new cases. Both states said
children who show no signs of clinical malnutrition will be cut
from the program.
   New York will try to cut its caseload by 20,000 to 360,000,
while Connecticut no longer allows use of federal funds to buy
orange juice, suggesting instead that mothers buy apple or
pineapple juice, which cost less.
   Illinois officials, however, say their state is an exception to
the national problem and will not have to cut any of its 162,000
recipients, according to the Chicago Tribune, which also reported
on Friday on cuts in the WIC program.
   Congress has proposed a $150 million increase in the program for
next year. That money was meant to strengthen the program, but now
officials hope it will be enough to stay even.
   The WIC program provides poor families with food vouchers. It is
open to pregnant women, those who have just given birth, and
children.
   It serves 1 million women, 1.4 million infants and 2.1 million
other children under age 5, or about one-third of all babies born
in the United States.
   During the 1980s, when other welfare programs were cut, WIC was
spared because federal studies said it saved lives, reduced infant
mortality and prevented illness, thereby sparing future expense to
Medicaid.

<TEXT>
   Cadbury Schweppes PLC, the British beverages and
sweets manufacturer, agreed Tuesday to buy most of the non-cola
soft drinks business of Source Perrier of France for 125 million
pounds, or $211 million.
   The purchase includes the noncarbonated fruit drinks Oasis and
Bali, the fruit drink concentrate Atoll and the bottling rights for
Gini, a carbonated lemon drink, Cadbury Schweppes said.
   Cadbury Schweppes said 1989 sales of the businesses being
acquired was 91.3 million pounds, or $154 million.
   The acquisition includes two manufacturing plants near Paris and
one in Marseilles, Cadbury Schweppes said. The company is not
buying a couple other brands and Perrier's bottling rights to
Pepsi-Cola products.
   The deal is conditional on clearance by the French authorities.
   Cadbury Schweppes said the acquisition is being made by the
purchase of shares in Compagnie d'Exploitation de Boissons
Refraichissantes, a wholly owned subsidiary of Source Perrier.
   Perrier executives have said that the company wants to
concentrate on its flagship bottled water interests because it
expects that market to expand dramatically in coming years.
   Earlier this year, Perrier withdrew its mineral water from
shelves worldwide after some samples of the water were discovered
to contain traces of benzene, a naturally occurring chemical said
to be cancer inducing.
   Source Perrier since has reintroduced the mineral water, after
carrying out checks and repairs to prevent benzene from entering
the finished product.

<HEAD>$12 Billion Development Bank for Eastern Europe Created</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials from 40 nations on Tuesday signed a
treaty creating a $12 billion development bank to finance Eastern
Europe's conversion to a market economy.
   The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will be a
``catalyst between the capital and know-how of the West and the
businesses of the East,'' French President Francois Mitterrand said
at a signing ceremony.
   Mitterand proposed creating the bank last November as Communist
regimes crumbled across Eastern Europe. He said the 42 founding
nations would not reduce their individual support to Third World
countries.
   The bank is expected to become operation in April 1991. The 12
European Community nations hold a controlling 51 percent interest
in the bank, although the United States is the single biggest
shareholder with 10 percent interest.
   Eastern European countries will hold 13.5 percent interest.
   Under the bank's statutes, two-thirds of the founding members
must ratify the treaty before the bank can start lending money to
countries in Eastern Europe that have embraced democratic
principles.
   The bank will allocate at least 60 percent of its loans to the
private sector in Eastern Europe and the rest to public projects.
   The five-month negotiations to create the bank were punctuated
by disputes over the Soviet Union's membership and the choices for
a venue and president.
   Early in the talks, the United States raised objections to
accepting the Soviet Union as a full member. The dispute was
resolved by allowing the Soviets to join, but limiting borrowing
for three years to the amount of capital they contribute.
   The Netherlands led a rebellion by six other small Western
European countries against plans to locate the bank's headquarters
in London under the presidency of Jacques Attali of France, one of
Mitterrand's top aides.
   Dutch officials, saying the big European powers were too
dominant in multinational instituions, lobbied in vain to have the
bank based in Amsterdam or to have former Dutch Finance Minister
Onno Rudding picked as president.
   In Paris last month, Attali was elected 32-8 over Rudding. The
bank's two institutional members, the European Commission and the
European Investment Bank, abstained.
   London received 23 votes as the venue for the bank's
headquarters, while Amsterdam and Copenhagen got five votes each.
   The Dutch kept their finance minister at home Tuesday and sent a
low-level delegation to the signing ceremony instead.

<TEXT>
   A top U.S. trade official on Tuesday appealed to
other rich nations to give a push to trade talks stalled by a
dispute between the United States and European nations over
government payments to farmers.
   ``A window of opportunity is now,'' U.S. Trade Representative
Carla Hills said a day before the opening of high-level discussions
by trade and finance chiefs of two dozen industrialized nations.
   ``The possibilities are profound,'' she said. ``It just is going
to take the political will to do it.''
   The officials are attending the annual meeting of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. They were
expected to focus on the Uruguay Round talks, an ambitious effort
to revamp the world trading system.
   The negotiations, which involve about 100 nations, are designed
to reduce barriers to trade in agriculture, textiles and other
manufactured goods, and in services such as banking and investment.
   The bargaining began in Uruguay in 1986 and is due to end in
December. But a fight between the United States and the 12-nation
European Community over agricultural subsidies has raised concern
the talks could end in failure.
   The United States wants the EC, also known as the Common Market,
to end import barriers and domestic and export farm subsidies that
distort trade. U.S. officials estimate that ending the costly
subsidies could boost U.S. farm exports by $11 billion annually.
   The Common Market give its farmers subsidies through guaranteed
prices for many crops. It also assists exporters so more expensive
European farm products can compete with lower prices on the world
market.
   The community argues it has begun trimming farm aid but contends
it cannot scrap the program entirely. In 1988, European leaders
adopted a plan limiting the maximum annual amount of expenditure on
price guarantees over five years.
   U.S. officials have said the measures were not enough to fix
what they deem a fundamentally flawed system.
   ``Agriculture is a key to the success of the round so that the
Europeans are going to have to decide whether they want a
successful round,'' Mrs. Hills said.
   She said about $1 trillion worth of commerce was not covered by
international rules. Without regulations, countries can use a
variety of tactics _ some considered unfair by trading partners _
to sell their goods or protect them from competitors.
   Mrs. Hills said that ``if we don't get a deal in agriculture,
we're not going to build the rules we need in these areas where
there are no rules at all.''
   ``It's just time that we do have rules, for without rules we are
a lawless international trading community,'' she said.
   The flow of textiles, for instance, is controlled by a network
of tariffs and quotas, not by the multinational trading system.
   The Uruguay Round talks are held under the auspices of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. GATT is a forum and an
agreement for promoting freer trade.
   Officials want to move talks along so lower-level negotiators
can reach preliminary agreement in at least some of 15 areas under
discussion at a July 23 session in Geneva, Switzerland.
   OECD members are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada,
Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United States and West Germany.

<HEAD>Court Agrees To Hear Case on Interstate Business</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Scotus-Business, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide
whether state laws that interfere unconstitutionally with
interstate businesses also may violate federal civil rights law.
   At issue in the Nebraska case is whether states can be forced to
pay lawyer fees and other legal expenses for businesses that
challenge a state's discriminatory taxes.
   The case stems from an Ohio trucker's challenge of a Nebraska
truck tax. Mark Dennis, the owner of Dennis Trucking in Royalton,
Ohio, sued the Nebraska Department of Motor Vehicles in 1984 over
taxes imposed on truckers from states that imposed certain types of
taxes on Nebraska-based trucking businesses.
   The taxes, which are no longer in effect, were imposed on trucks
from Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oregon,
Pennsylvania and Wyoming.
   Nebraska courts ruled that the state tax interfered
impermissibly with interstate commerce. State officials were barred
from collecting the taxes, but the courts refused to treat Dennis'
suit as a civil rights case, which would have entitled him to
recoup lawyers fees and other expenses.
   The case is Dennis vs. Higgins, 89-1555.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed in Tuesday's auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $8.4 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.80 percent, up from 7.74 percent
last week. Another $8.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.74 percent, down from 7.79 percent last
week.
   The rate on three-month bills was the highest since April 30
when they sold for 7.91 percent. It was the lowest for six-month
bills since they averaged 7.68 percent on May 14.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.07 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,802.80 and 8.17 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,608.70
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, slipped to 8.22
percent last week, down from 8.24 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>EC, Japan Agree To Improve Trade and Other Ties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community and Japan agreed
Tuesday to improve trade ties and Japan hinted it soon would give
more money to the developing democracies in Eastern Europe.
   EC estimates show that the 12-nation alliance's trade deficit
with Japan grew 5.9 percent in the first nine months of 1989 from
the same period a year earlier to reach $23.2 billion.
   Frans Andriessen, EC commissioner for foreign affairs, said the
two sides would form a panel to review bilateral trade that would
discuss current problems and try to reach a ``breakthrough'' in the
trade imbalance.
   Japanese foreign minister Taro Nakayama also told journalists
Japan was ``directing its assistance to all'' developing
democracies in Eastern Europe and said Western aid program to these
nations were ``very important.''
   The European Commission coordinates aid from 24 industrialized
nations, including Japan, for Poland and Hungary. The aid is likely
to be extended to five other East and Central European nations at a
meeting in July.
   Andriessen said Japan had a ``firm determination to continue
helping the newly developing democracies.''
   Kabun Muto, the Japanese minister of international trade and
industry, said Japan would try to help Europeans invest in sectors
``welcomed in Japanese markets.'' He did not specify the areas, but
said the action would help reduce the trade imbalance.

<HEAD>Dukakis May Seek Sale of Tobacco Investments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael Dukakis may try to make Massachusetts
the first state in the nation to divest its stock in tobacco
companies, a spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   ``Right now we're taking a serious look at it,'' Dukakis aide
Mari Sullivan said.
   Dukakis last week asked aides to determine whether he can order
the state to divest through an executive order or if the
legislature needs to pass a bill, according to a report in
Tuesday's Boston Globe.
   Anti-smoking activists say Massachusetts would be the first
state to take such action.
   Activists have mounted a nationwide effort to push states,
universities and hospitals to divest of tobacco holdings. But
tobacco industry officials have said they foresee little trouble
for their stock, although they do not completely dismiss the
efforts.
   Harvard University last week announced a policy against using
any of its nearly $5 billion endowment fund to invest in tobacco
companies. The City University of New York has a similar policy.
   Massachusetts holds $31 million in tobacco stocks as part of a
$2.9 billion pension fund managed by Pension Reserves Investments
Management. About $24.6 million is invested in Philip Morris Co.
Other holdings include U.S. Tobacco, Lowes Corps. and American
Brands Inc.
   In addition, the state treasurer's office has invested millions
of dollars in tobacco stocks as part of a retirement fund for
teachers and state employees. As of April 30, the investment in
tobacco stocks totaled $26.9 million.
   The anti-tobacco drive had its genesis in a May memo in which
Secretary of Human Service Philip Johnston and public health
commissioner David Mulligan argued against the investments on
health grounds.

<HEAD>East Germany Plans To Speed Privatization</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany plans to speed
privatization of its industry as the nation lays foundations for a
switch to capitalism, its economics minister said Tuesday.
   Economics Minister Gerhard Pohl said only 180 of about 8,000
state-owned industries have been converted into publicly held
companies so far.
   ``If things continue like this, it will take five years'' to
reach total privatization, Pohl told reporters in Bonn after
meeting with West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann.
   Pohl said the East German parliament is to approve a legal
framework by October to quicken the process. He said ``incentives''
were planned for potential investors in now state-owned
enterprises, but he did not elaborate.
   West Germany has been pressuring East Germany to quicken
privatization as a source of revenue for economic reconstruction.
The two German states are to become a single economic entity as of
July 2.
   West Germany will provide massive financial backing to start the
possibly painful transformation of East Germany's centrally planned
economy into one based on free-market principles.
   For its part, East Germany has pledged to start selling off
state-owned property to produce its own contributions for economic
reconstruction. There are fears privatization could result in
eliminating many ailing businesses unable to withstand competition.
   Pohl and Haussmann discussed plans to build a layer of small and
medium-sized companies to form the backbone of the newly
restructured East German economy.
   Pohl said his government plans legislation to increase fivefold
the number of trainee positions available in industry starting in
September.
   He said it is too soon to say how many people will lose their
jobs as uncompetitive industrial companies go out of business in
the economic merger. Pohl said about 1 million people will have to
be retrained under the new order.

<HEAD>Brady Sees More Competition for International Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said Tuesday
that debt-strapped Third World countries must reform their
economies quickly to compete with emerging Eastern European
democracies for investors.
   ``The incentive for the developing countries to move ahead
vigorously with reform efforts has taken on additional urgency
since the emergence of Eastern Europe,'' Brady said.
   ``In the aggressive worldwide competition for foreign
investment, countries which fail to create an attractive investment
environment run a real risk of lost opportunities and falling
behind,'' he said.
   Brady said the competition was for not only investment capital
put up by commercial banks and other private interests but also for
support from governments such as the United States.
   ``We are committed to providing maximum possible support for
market-oriented reforms in both regions (of Eastern Europe and
Latin America),'' Brady said. ``But let's face it, the world is
short of capital and governments are shorter still.''
   Brady said the Bush administration was channeling its aid both
on a country-by-country basis and through multinational lending
organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund.
   Brady's remarks were made in a speech to the American Chamber of
Commerce in London. A text of the comments was released in
Washington.
   Brady praised the progress made under his 15-month-old debt
initiative in which commercial banks are provided incentives to
forgive a portion of the $1.3 trillion debt being carried by Third
World countries.
   So far, six nations _ Mexico, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Morocco,
the Philippines and Chile _ have reached debt-reduction agreements
using guidelines of the Brady plan.
   Brady said the commercial bank debt of the six nations accounts
for nearly half the debt of the 16 largest debtor countries and
that negotiations are underway to reach debt agreements with
several other countries.
   The crumbling of communist domination in Eastern Europe has
grabbed the headlines, but Brady said revolutionary change has also
been underway in Latin America.
   ``Democratic elections in many Latin American nations have
produced a new generation of leaders committed to market-based
economic reforms,'' he said. Brady addressed business leaders in
London before traveling to Paris for a ceremony establishing the
new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, aimed at
providing assistance for Eastern Europe.
   He also was leading the U.S. delegation to the annual meeting of
the 24-nation Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.

   Prices surged higher in light trading on Wall
Street today as technology stocks rebounded from Friday's sharp
losses and helped propel the Dow Jones industrial average to
another closing high.
   The industrials gained 49.57 to close at 2,870.49, surpassing
the index's previous high of 2,856.26, set just last Wednesday.
   Technology issues had pulled the market sharply lower on Friday
after Adobe Systems, a computer software company, said its earnings
for the second quarter and full fiscal year were likely to fall
short of analysts' estimates.
   But the high-tech stocks did an about-face today, in part
because of a Barron's article that said International Business
Machines was on an upward course after several laggard years.
   IBM was among the big gainers today.
   Rising bond prices, which often help support the stock market by
easing concerns about interest rates, did so again today. The
Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up about $4 for each $1,000
in face value by late afternoon.
   Analysts said the stock market sentiment appeared positive
despite Friday's 35-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average.
They said early signs of weakness brought buyers back into the
market.
   Some computer-program buying was reported today, and prices
surged higher late in the session as investors who had been on the
sidelines jumped in to avoid being left out of the rally.
   Analysts noted, however, that with a light volume, it remained
to be seen if the gains would hold up.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower; Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Renewed domestic buying after the long U.S.
holiday weekend helped the dollar stage a partial recovery from an
earlier foreign selloff, but it still ended lower against most
major currencies Tuesday.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Foreign exchange dealers said trading in the dollar was
uneventful and interest probably would not perk up before the
release Friday of U.S. unemployment data for May.
   Speculation about possible developments at the summit that
begins Thursday between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev kept some currency dealers on the sidelines.
   ``It was generally a quiet day today with the dollar climbing
back from its overnight selloff,'' said Marc Chandler, currency
analyst at MMS International in Chicago. ``U.S. dealers took
advantage of the dip in the dollar to re-establish long positions.''
   The dollar weakened in European trading. Markets in the United
States and Britain were closed Monday for a holiday.
   ``I think the market's taking stock after the holidays,'' said
Andrew Elliott, international foreign exchange salesman at Chase
Manhattan Bank in London.
   The dollar's trading day began in Tokyo where the currency
closed at 150.70 Japanese yen, up from 149.45 yen late Monday.
Later, in London, it rose to 150.95 yen. The dollar continued its
rebound in New York, rising to 151.22 yen from 149.40 yen late
Friday.
   Selected late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's
late quotes, included: 1.6740 West German marks, down from 1.68235;
1.4105 Swiss francs, down from 1.4235; 5.6380 French francs, down
from 5.6615; 1,229.50 Italian lire, down from 1,235.50; and 1.17945
Canadian dollar, down from 1.1830.
   The dollar weakened against the British pound. Sterling
strengthened to $1.6945 in New York from late Friday's $1.6905. In
London, the pound rose to $1.6953 from Friday's $1.6930.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Monday's late
levels, included: 1.6710 West German marks, down from 1.6790;
1.4080 Swiss francs, down from 1.4215; 5.6280 French francs, down
from 5.6565; 1.8810 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8910; 1,228.25
Italian lire, down from 1,233.50; and 1.1815 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1828.
   Gold prices ended with minor losses in domestic trading after
posting scattered gains overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold for
current delivery shed 80 cents to close at $367.40. Republic
National Bank quoted a bid of $366.90 for a troy ounce of gold
bullion, 60 cents lower than Friday.
   In London, gold rose to a late bid of $367.60 a troy ounce from
$367.45 late Friday. Monday was a holiday in Britain. In Zurich,
gold was unchanged from Monday at a closing bid of $367.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 56 cents to close at a bid of
$369.48.
   Silver prices finished lower. Silver for current delivery fell
to $5.138 a troy ounce on New York's Comex from $5.215 Friday.
Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $5.17 a troy ounce
from $5.23 late Friday.

   Prices surged higher on Wall Street Tuesday and
the Dow Jones industrial average reached another new closing high
as technology issues recovered from Friday's losses and took the
rest of the stock market along for the ride.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 49.57 to
2,870.49, surpassing the blue chip barometer's previous closing
high of 2,856.26, set just last Wednesday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 11
to 4 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 1,107 up, 434 down and 462 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to a relatively light
137.41 million shares, up from 120.25 million in the previous
session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 167.06 million shares.
   Technology issues, which pulled the market sharply lower on
Friday, reversed course Tuesday after a Barron's article said
International Business Machines was on an upward course after
several laggard years. Investors snapped up IBM, bidding the stock
up 3{ to 119}.
   Friday's decline had been triggered by an announcement by the
computer software manufacturer Adobe Systems that its earnings for
the second quarter and full fiscal year were likely to fall short
of analysts' estimates. But Adobe was a winner Tuesday, gaining 2|
to close at 37~ in over-the-counter trading.
   Other high-tech gainers included Digital Equipment, up 2\ to
94}, and Tandy, which gained 1{ to 35{. Both stocks were traded on
the NYSE.
   On the over-the-counter market, Apple Computer rose 1 to 41 and
Intel was up 1&lsqb; to 48|.
   Rising bond prices, which often help support the stock market by
easing concerns about interest rates, did so again Tuesday. The
Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up about $4 for each $1,000
in face value by late afternoon.
   Analysts were cautiously upbeat about Tuesday's gains, noting
that the advance came on relatively light volume. But they said the
market showed signs of strength in its ability to shake off
Friday's 35-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average.
   ``After the Adobe decline on Friday, you'd think it would temper
the enthusiasm, but it certainly has not,'' said Michael Metz, an
analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   ``It shows a very resilient market, with with underinvested
participants looking for entry points,'' Metz said.
   Some computer-program buying was reported Tuesday, and prices
surged higher late in the session as bargain hunters and investors
who had been on the sidelines jumped in to avoid being left behind.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was Varity, which
rose &lsqb; to 3&lsqb;.
   Other Big Board gainers included Time Warner, which soared 3&rsqb; to
109 after another Barron's article called the stock undervalued.
Wal-Mart rose 2&rsqb; to 57{, Disney rose 2&lsqb; to 119}, and Bristol Myers
Squibb was up 1&lsqb; to 61~.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $45.179 billion, or 1.33
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
advanced 2.86 to 196.57.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 7.68 to 421.31, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 6.07 to 360.65.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
picked up 3.82 to 457.51. At the American Stock Exchange, the
market value index closed at 362.56, up 2.72.

   Stock prices surged Tuesday in light trading as
technology issues rebounded from Friday's sharp losses and helped
propel the Dow Jones industrial average to another closing high.
   The Dow finished up 49.57 at 2,870.49, surpassing the widely
watched index's previous record close of 2,856.26, set last
Wednesday.
   Broader market indicators also jumped higher and nearly three
stocks rose in price for every one that fell on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Technology stocks pulled the market sharply lower Friday after
Adobe Systems, a computer software company, said its earnings were
likely to fall short of analysts' estimates. The Dow Jones
industrial average lost 35 points on Friday.
   But high-tech stocks did an about-face Tuesday. Analysts said
the rebound stemmed partly from an article in Barron's magazine
that said International Business Machines Corp. was on an upward
course after several laggard years. IBM, a key component of the Dow
industrial average, was among the big gainers Tuesday.
   Declining interest rates in the bond market also helped support
stocks by easing concerns about higher interest rates. The yield on
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 8.62 percent from 8.66
percent Friday.
   Tuesday's climb occurred in relatively light trading volume.
NYSE volume totaled 137.41 million shares, compared with 120.25
million on Friday ahead of the three-day Memorial Day weekend.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Drop in Reaction to Labor Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices plunged Tuesday on New York's Commodity
Exchange as traders reacted to a labor accord reached last week
between Kennecott Corp. and its workers.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures were mostly lower,
livestock and pork futures were higher, energy futures gained and
precious metals futures dropped.
   Last week's agreement between Kennecott and the United
Steelworkers union, which represents the mining company's workers,
proved to be a drag on copper futures.
   Copper settled 2.10 cents to 4.10 cents lower, with the contract
for delivery in May at $1.1585 a pound.
   There had been been fears that a dispute over wages and benefits
could result in strikes in the copper industry, said Jim Steel, an
analyst with Refco Inc. in New York.
   The union settlement reduced the possibility of supply
disruptions had a contract agreement failed to materialize before
the June 30 expiration of the previous contract, Steel said.
   The agreement makes it more likely that the other copper
producers will reach accords with their unions, he said.
   Grain and soybean futures were mostly lower on the Chicago Board
of Trade.
   Soybean prices fell sharply as professional selling set in
during late trading. The demand for soybeans and soybean products
has been negligible, said analyst Joel Karlin of Research
Department Inc.
   ``What demand there has been is being supplied by sales in South
America,'' Karlin said.
   He said soybean futures also were pressured by continued wet
weather in the Midwest that has delayed corn planting. Forecasts
have called for more rain later this week.
   Karlin said traders are concerned that the longer corn planting
is delayed, the more likely the acreage given over to soybeans will
increase. Corn takes longer than soybeans to mature.
   The weather outlook offered some support to corn futures, as did
scattered export business, Karlin said.
   Wheat prices gained on ideas among traders that wheat had been
oversold in recent sessions, analysts said.
   Wheat was 4{ cents to 6 cents higher with July at $3.35 a
bushel; corn was 1\ cents lower to 2 cents higher with July at
$2.84\ a bushel; oats were 7 cents to 8\ cents lower with July at
$1.46\ cents a bushel; soybeans were 8 cents to 14} cents lower
with July at $6.06 a bushel.
   Thestrength of meat futures sent livestock and pork prices
higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Frozen pork belly futures closed up the 200 point limit in the
wake of the U.S. Agriculture Department's monthly cold storage
report, released Friday, which showed light movement of pork
bellies into cold storage.
   Hog futures were higher, gaining support from bellies and higher
cash prices.
   Cattle futures were boosted by spillover buying from the pork
pits.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .55 cent higher with June at
74.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .20 cent higher
with August at 83.90 cents a pound; hogs were .43 cent to 1.30
cents higher with June at 67.25 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .70 cent to 2 cents higher with July at 67.85 cents a pound.
   Energy futures were higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange
after rallying from a steep selloff in earlier trading. Analysts
attributed the early selloff to an oversupply of crude oil.
   However, unleaded gasoline led a comeback on revived buying
interest by major oil companies in the U.S. Gulf Coast region and
the firming of the European gasoline market, said Jim Ritterbusch,
an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in Chicago.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 6 cents to 28 cents higher
with July at $17.98 a barrel; heating oil was .32 cent to .58 cent
higher with June at 50.24 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .85
cent to 2.38 cents higher with the June contract at 65.79 cents a
gallon.
   Precious metals futures were lower on the Comex, with
followthrough selling of silver futures from Friday's weak close
pulling gold lower.
   Gold was 80 cents to $1.10 lower with June at $367.40 a troy
ounce. Silver was 7.7 cents to 8.5 cents lower with May at $5.138 a
troy ounce.

   DHL International Ltd. said Tuesday
that Japan Airlines, Lufthansa and the Japanese trading company
Nissho Iwai will acquire a minority stake in the air express
service company.
   Japan Airlines and Lufthansa each will get a 5 percent stake in
DHL with an option to buy up to 25 percent within 18 months. Nissho
Iwai will acquire a 2.5 percent interest with an option for up to
7.5 percent.
   The company said negotiations were under way for selling a small
stake in DHL Corp., based in Redwood City, Calif., but no agreement
had been reached.
   Patrick Lupo, chief executive of DHL Worldwide Express in
Brussels, said the deal would allow DHL to expand air, hub and
gateway operations. ``This alliance will enable us to keep pace
with market growth in Europe and Asia,'' he said.
   DHL said that its network carried over 50 million international
shipments last year. The network has over 24,000 employees
worldwide and operates 1,350 service centers in 184 countries. DHL
said 1990 revenue will top $1.8 billion.
   DHL International Ltd., part of the DHL Worldwide Express
Network, operates in all areas of the world outside the United
States. DHL Corp., another unit of the DHL Worldwide Express
Network, operates the business in the United States and its

   Chairman William Jovanovich resigned Tuesday
from textbook publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., three years
after orchestrating a recapitalization that kept the company
independent but left it heavily in debt.
   ``Forty-three years is enough,'' the 70-year-old Jovanovich said
in stepping down from his last major corporate assignment at the
company he joined as a textbook salesman and editor in 1947.
   He had been disengaging himself from the company over the past
two years, stepping down earlier as president and chief executive.
   Jovanovich will be succeeded as chairman by former U.S. energy
secretary John S. Herrington, 51, who has been on the board of
directors for a year.
   His son, Peter Jovanovich, 41, was named president and chief
executive late last year and was named Tuesday as chairman of the
executive committee, another post the elder Jovanovich is leaving.
   Analysts said they expect no major shifts in direction for the
company, which is grappling with how to handle a debt burden that
is expected to become a more serious problem over the next few
years as cash dividends come due.
   ``I don't see where this makes a whole lot of difference,'' said
Andrew Herenstein, who follows the company for the investment firm
Delaware Bay Co. in New York. ``There still has to be some kind of
restructuring.''
   Wall Street also shrugged off the change. In trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, Harcourt finished unchanged at $3.12{ a share.
   William Jovanovich joined Harcourt Brace &amp; Co. as a book
salesman and editor in 1947 and built it into one of the nation's
leading publishers of textbooks as well a premier medical and
professional publisher.
   When he became president and chief executive in 1954, the
company had annual sales of $8 million and employed 125 people.
Last year, it posted revenue of $1.3 billion and employed 6,000
people.
   Although he owned less than 2 percent of the company's stock,
Jovanovich exercised unusually strong control over the company. It
added his name to its own in 1970 when Jovanovich added chairman to
his list of titles. He was seen within the industry as a maverick,
moving the company to Orlando, Fla., from New York in 1983 and
shunning the usual trade associations.
   ``Forty-three years is enough, especially since I now can devote
my time to editing books and writing them,'' he said in announcing
his resignation.
   But Jovanovich leaves the company with $1.6 billion in debt
incurred in a 1987 recapitalization undertaken to avoid a takeover
bid from British publisher Robert Maxwell.
   Many analysts say the company generates enough cash to meet its
interest obligations over the next two years. But they warn that
trouble could develop in 1992 when cash payments start coming due
on preferred stock and debt which now are issuing additional
securities as dividends.
   In an effort to pare its debt, Harcourt sold its theme park
business to Anheuser-Busch Cos. for $1.1 billion last year. But the
price disappointed some analysts.
   That sale helped the company post a profit of $72.1 million, or
17 cents a shsre, in 1989 on revenue of $1.34 billion, compared
with a loss of $53.4 million, or $2.03 a share, on revenue of $1.27
billion a year earlier.
   More recently, HBJ was reported to have been in talks on selling
more assets to Thomson Corp., the Canadian publisher. The company
never confirmed who it was talking with, but announced May 9 that
it had terminated talks on selling assets and public debt to a
third party.
   In addition to its publishing operations, Harcourt has interests
in the insurance business, which accounted for one-third of its
1989 revenue.
   Herrington, 51, has served as a member of the Harcourt board
since May 1989, and has served on its executive and finance
committees.
   He served as energy secretary in the Reagan administration from
February 1985 to January 1989 and was assistant secretary of the
Navy from 1981 to 1983.
   Herrington called Jovanovich ``an American publishing legend, a
pioneer in educational technology and an industry giant who built
the best independent publishing house in America.''
   In a telephone interview, Herrington said he became a candidate
for the job after the elder Jovanovich asked him to run for it. ``I
think it's going to be a team effort between Peter and I,'' he
said, adding he brings management experience honed in overseeing
the sprawling Energy Department to the job.
   ``We are looking at all options. We are interested in keeping
this company viable, independent and American,'' he said.

   Energy futures prices rose Tuesday, led by a
strong jump in unleaded gasoline due to what analysts said were
internal market factors and concerns about future gas supplies.
   The June contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 2.38
cents to 65.79 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
on top of Friday's 0.18 cent increase. The July contract increased
1.96 cents to 62.96 cents a gallon.
   John Hill, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Energy Futures,
said the increase was prompted partly by continued buying among
major oil companies in the Gulf Coast market.
   He also said there was concern that some refineries taken off
line for routine maintenance would not return to full production as
fast as originally expected.
   ``Gasoline output's just a little behind where we thought it
would be,'' he said. ``(The refineries) are coming back on, but
they're coming back on a little more slowly than we anticipated.''
   Among other refined products traded on the Merc, the June
contract for home heating oil rose 0.58 cent a gallon to 50.24
cents, after dropping 0.15 cent on Friday. Later months showed
slightly smaller increases.
   Bob Baker, senior energy analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said the price rose on the coattails of the increase in
unleaded gasoline.
   The July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 18 cents to $17.98 a 42-gallon barrel
on the Mercantile Exchange following a 3-cent drop Friday. Later
contract months showed small increases.
   Analysts said the price was bouncing back after declines last
week that were spurred by renewed concerns of a worldwide oil glut.
   Natural gas prices declined. The July contract fell to $1.585
per 1,000 cubic feet from $1.592 Friday.

<HEAD>Shareholder Sues Software Company After Stock-Price Plunge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A stockholder of Adobe Systems Inc. has
sued the computer software company and its top officers over a 30
percent plunge in its stock price, claiming fraud and stock
manipulation, it was disclosed Tuesday.
   The U.S. District Court suit was filed Friday after the price of
Adobe's stock, which is traded over the counter, dropped by $15.25
a share to $35.25 in reaction to the previous day's report by the
company that second-quarter earnings would be 27 to 35 cents a
share, far below previous projections.
   Adobe closed at $37.875 a share Tuesday in continued heavy
selling.
   Stockholder Donald A. Wells Jr. said in the suit that Adobe's
top officers knew in March that the company's stock price was
inflated but issued a series of misleadingly optimistic statements
to the public.
   Wells cited a May 2 statement by John E. Warnock, Adobe's
chairman and president, that the company would continue to
demonstrate solid rates of growth and had maintained its leadership
position in its industry. Adobe's software is used to control
computer printers.
   Warnock also stated that sales to Apple Computer Inc., Adobe's
leading customer, had not slowed, despite knowing that Apple
planned to use a competitor's product in its future laser printers
and that sales to Apple would plummet, Wells charges.
   The suit said Warnock and four other officers sold 316,000
shares of Adobe stock between March 6 and last Thursday, at prices
they knew were inflated. Meanwhile, Wells and other members of the
public relied on the alleged misstatements by the company in buying
the stock, the suit said.
   Wells, who said he and his retirement plan owned 500 shares of
Adobe, seeks to sue on behalf of all who bought company stock
during the period. No specific amount of damages is claimed, but
the suit says the stock's aggregate value dropped by more than $300
million during Friday's selloff.
   Adobe, based in Mountain View, issued a statement Tuesday saying
it was ``not unusual for companies having announced a drop in their
income, as we did, to receive one or more similar complaints.''
   ``We also believe the lawsuit is completely without merit and we
intend to vigorously contest the action,'' the company said.

   A Soviet health official said Tuesday
that consumers in his country are demanding safer food after the
accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station.
   ``In the last few years there has been a lot of discussion as to
the information given to people as to what they eat, drink and
breathe, and it has produced a lot of interest and activity in
ecology,'' Alexander Kondrusev, vice minister of health, said at a
conference.
   ``People do not want to eat the contaminated foods and they
express it forcefully,'' he said.
   Kondrusev and Victor Tutelyan, an official with the Soviet
Academy of Medical Scientists, spoke at the opening of the
International Conference on Food Safety at Michigan State
University.
   Tutelyan said some meat, milk and potatoes from a
6,200-square-mile area near Chernobyl are still contaminated with
radiation. He said 4 million people live in the area.
   ``It will be a long time before it will be possible to obtain
milk that meets current safety standards and is acceptable for
use,'' he said.
   High radiation levels began showing up in Soviet milk two or
three days after the April 26, 1986, explosion at the nuclear power
station in Chernobyl, about 80 miles north of Kiev.
   Two jet-like emissions of radioactive material spewed into the
air, followed for 10 days by a cloud of radioactive gases, Tutelyan
said.
   He said Soviet officials attempted to protect the public by
moving cattle into barns so that they would not graze in pastures
contaminated by the fallout.
   Some citizens rejected the government's countermeasures. Nearly
30 people, mostly elderly farmers, insisted on leaving their milk
cows outdoors to graze on contaminated grass. Tutelyan said the
farmers, who were 70 or older, decided not to worry about
developing cancer in 20 years.
   Meat contaminated with radiation was buried in a 20-mile zone
around Chernobyl, but Tutelyan said new technology has been
developed to decontaminate meat.
   He also said milk can be made into butter because the
radioactive contaminants are concentrated in the water portion of
the milk and can be separated. In 1986, 20 percent to 30 percent of
milk, meat, greens and fruits produced near Chernobyl had to be
discarded, he said.

<HEAD>Names American Express Exec To Run Brokerage Unit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., continuing a major
overhaul, on Tuesday named an executive from parent American
Express Co. to run the troubled firm's retail brokerage and asset
management units.
   The move is the latest step by American Express to reshape the
nation's second-largest securities firm, which has stumbled badly
following a huge expansion in the 1980s.
   Shearson is expected in coming days to announce a reorganization
that could split its investment banking business from its retail
brokerage network, possibly including the resurrection of the
venerable Lehman Brothers name.
   In what analysts called a precursor to the division,
Shearsonsaid Tuesday that Jonathan S. Linen would become president
and chief executive of the firm's retail brokerage and assest
management businesses starting next week.
   Linen, 46, currently is president and chief executive of
American Express' direct marketing and travelers checks group,
which includes investment products, life insurance, merchandising
and publishing businesses.
   Linen was described as a close associate of American Express
Chairman James D. Robinson III, who has led the restructuring at
Shearson.
   Shearson also said that Hardwick Simmons, a respected industry
figure who had run the firm's brokerage division, had resigned.
Simmons, former head of the Securities Industry Association, the
industry's main trade group, could not immediately be reached for
comment.
   American Express in recent months has infused more than $1
billion in capital into Shearson and is buying all of the
brokerage's remaining common stock. American Express now holds 61
percent of Shearson.
   Robinson earlier this year installed Howard L. Clark Jr., then
American Express' chief financial officer, as Shearson's chairman
and chief executive after ousting Peter A. Cohen, a Wall Street
whiz who led Shearson's growth.
   The firm expanded in the last decade during a period of great
deal making activity and unprecedented profits. Shearson in 1984
took over the respected Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc. investment
bank in 1984.
   Shearson lost an industry record $915 million in the first
quarter, partly because of expenses to pay for a restructuring tht
included about 2,000 layoffs. Most Wall Street firms have been
forced to cut back because of an industry slowdown since the 1987
stock market crash.
   Linen has no direct experience in the securities business, but
is viewed as an effective trouble-shooter during 21 years at
American Express. He will be responsible for running Shearson's
retail network of about 10,000 brokers, second in number only to
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Shearson's retail network had about $180 billion of assets held
in private accounts at the end of the first quarter and about $93
billion under management for pension funds, corporations and
institutional clients.
   Analysts said they did not necessarily believe Linen's lack of
experience on Wall Street would be a handicap. They said his first
task would be to renew confidence at the firm among its retail
brokers.
   Linen's marketing background also could help in assessing what
financial products the firm is selling and their cost, they said.
   ``The primary focus right now is to get Shearson straightened
out,'' said Lawrence Eckenfelder, an analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in San Francisco. ``Some people say why bring in
another person from the outside. On the other hand the guys that
had been running it hadn't been doing a very good job.''
   Linen came to Shearson in 1969 as assistant to the chairman, who
was then Clark's father, Howard Clark Sr. He held various
positions, including president of the U.S. travel services division
from 1980 to 1986.

<HEAD>Brokerage Unit Files for Chapter 11</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. on Tuesday joined
its parent company and filed for bankruptcy court protection,
saying it hoped to come back as an operating entity on Wall Street.
   Drexel said the filing under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy
law was a step to enable the firm to emerge from court protection
alive, but it did not specify what kind of business it would
operate.
   As part of the plan, Drexel named John F. Sorte as chief
executive. He succeeded Frederick H. Joseph, who led the firm
through its rapid rise in the 1980s under the growth of junk bonds
pioneered by Michael Milken.
   Sorte, 42, who will take over Drexel's day-to-day operations,
was co-head of the firm's corporate finance department and a member
of its executive committee. Joseph will remain as president of the
firm's parent, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., which sought
bankruptcy protection Feb. 13.
   Previously, it had been expected the Drexel would simply
liquidate all of its operations even though most of its
subsidiaries were never covered by the parent's bankruptcy filing.
   In Tuesday's filing, made in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan,
Drexel said ``it is anticipated that a viable reorganized entity
will emerge.'' Drexel said 14 other smaller subsidiaries of the
parent company also filed for bankruptcy protection.
   The company said the filing would allow the units ``to utilize
and realize the full value of their respective assets.''
   The filing allows all of Drexel's operations to reorganize under
court protection, a move that would have been difficult had only
the parent been in bankruptcy proceedings. It also freezes
outstanding litigation against any of the subsidiaries.
   Federal guidelines generally prohibit investment firms that do
business with the public from seeking bankruptcy protection. But
Drexel officials said the firm was able to make the filing because
it no longer had any client accounts.
   A revived Drexel would not be expected to deal with the public
but could seek to manage its existing stock and junk bond holdings
and advise clients, including companies that issued junk bonds
under Drexel's auspices.
   Drexel said in a statement that it now has 500 employees, down
from 5,400 when the parent filed for bankruptcy and more than
10,000 at its peak in the mid-1980s.
   In a court filing earlier this month, Drexel said it had total
assets of $3.26 billion and liabilities of $2.8 billion as of April
30. That was down from $54 billion at the time of the parent's
bankruptcy filing.
   Drexel said Tuesday it has sold off 87.4 percent of its
securities portfolio. Spokesman Steven Anreder said the firm still
holds about $1 billion in securities, mostly hard-to-sell junk
bonds that have been battered by a downturn in that market since
last fall.
   Drexel made millions in the 1980s in large part because of its
prowess issuing risky high-yield bonds used by expansion-minded
companies and for hostile takeovers.
   But the firm last year pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed
to pay $650 million to settle widespread securities law vioilations
following a lengthy government investigation. Milken admitted to
six felonies and agreed to pay $600 million in penalties last month.

   A Forbes magazine reader won $10,000 for
predictions made in 1980 on such things as the cost of a Big Mac,
the prime rate and the number of pro football teams at the end of
the decade, the magazine said Tuesday.
   Jack Rankin Jr. of Round Hill, Va., out-predicted 660 readers
who entered the contest announced in the Oct. 27, 1980, issue of
Forbes, the magazine said.
   The magazine's late editor, Malcolm Forbes, wrote in his Fact &amp;
Comment column that he would give $10,000 to the reader who most
accurately forecast 35 items 10 years in the future.
   ``If you're so smart, here's $10,000,'' Forbes wrote. ``All you
have to do between now and this year's end is to send me your
estimates of what the numbers will be for these 35 items at the end
of the decade _ Dec. 31, 1989.''
   Forbes magazine established a point system for grading the
entries, each receiving zero to 10 points per item based on
nearness to the actual figure.
   Rankin, 59, had one perfect score, for his exact estimate of the
number of pro football teams _ unchanged from 1979 at 28 _ and
earned points in 22 of the other categories, Forbes said.
   Rankin, a communications support group manager for Honeywell
Federal Systems in McLean, Va., also was close to the mark for the
price of a Big Mac _ he forecast $1.60, while Forbes said it was
$1.79 at the end of last year.
   But in some categories, Rankin was way off. He forecast the Dow
Jones industrial average would be 1,150; it was 2,753 on Dec. 31.
He said the price of a barrel of Saudi crude oil would be $59; it
was $18.40.
   Other categories included the number of computers in the United
States (52.4 million, up from 300,000), the number of shopping
malls (more than 34,000 from 19,200), the price of an ounce of gold
($399 from $525), the national debt ($3 trillion from $845 billion)
and the number of lawyers (725,574 from 464,851).
   Malcolm Steve Forbes Jr., editor-in-chief of the magazine,
announced another contest for the next decade in the magazine's
June 11 issue. The winner this time will receive $100,000.
   His advice to entrants: Don't assume today's trends will
continue.

<HEAD>Group Seeks to Represent Eastern Pilots in Bargaining</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A recently formed pilots association at Eastern
Airlines moved Tuesday for an election that it hopes will make it
the pilots' bargaining agent, replacing the union that struck the
carrier last year.
   The Eastern Pilots Association said it represents 93 percent of
the airline's 1,775 flying pilots while the Air Line Pilots
Association, the current bargaining agent, represents less than 5
percent.
   Thomas Cooper, chairman of the EPA steering committee, said ALPA
has lost touch with Eastern's working pilots after leading them off
the job in sympathy with striking Machinists last year.
   ``Our organization better represents the real interests of the
men and women who are flying Eastern's planes every day,'' Cooper
said in a statement. ``The fairest way for the pilots of Eastern to
determine the destiny of their own careers and the future of
Eastern is to have an election.''
   The EPA is seeking immediate action on its application for an
election to the National Mediation Board in Washington.
   ALPA called off its walkout late last year but most of its
members remain without jobs. Eastern is flying with pilots who
crossed picket lines and with non-union pilots who were hired
during the strike.
   ALPA's membership includes an estimated 1,200 to 1,400 Eastern
pilots who are not working.
   ``Under the Railway Labor Act, ALPA is the legal bargaining
agent for all Eastern pilots, and the actions taken today by the
EPA do not in any way affect that representation,'' ALPA spokesman
Lou Baldwin said in a statement.
   The airline had no comment, an Eastern spokesman said.
   Meanwhile, Eastern said Tuesday it will offer special discount
fares during June ranging from $49 to $99 each way for youngsters
12 to 21 and people 62 and older.
   The mileage-based fares are $49 one way for flights up to 300
miles; $69 for 301-1,200 miles; and $99 for trips over 1,200 miles.
Rates are $10 more each way during peak travel times.
   Eastern said the fares are available in all domestic markets and
good for travel beginning May 30. Travel must be completed by June
27.
   No advance purchase is necessary and all tickets are fully
refundable. A three-day minimum stay is required.

<HEAD>Controversial Plant Lights Homes with Nuclear Power for First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEABROOK, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The long-delayed Seabrook plant lit up
homes with nuclear power for the first time Tuesday night as
operators began gearing up toward full operation, officials said.
   The plant was operating at 15 percent capacity and producing
about 75 megawatts of electricity, enough to supply 65,000 homes,
when it was connected to the New England power grid just after 8
p.m., officials said.
   The hookup occurred as part of a series of tests to ready the
plant for full operation by mid-summer, spokesman Ron Sher said.
   ``By making this initial connection ... we're now on our way
toward making a major contribution to New England's long-term
energy supplies,'' Edward Brown, president of plant operator New
Hampshire Yankee, said in the news release.
   Sher said the plant would produce electricity into the early
morning hours and then be disconnected from the power grid so
equipment can be tested. Operators will connect and disconnect the
generator from the grid repeatedly during the next several weeks of
testing.
   At full power, Seabrook will generate 1,150 megawatts, enough to
supply 1 million homes, New Hampshire Yankee has said.
   The plant first produced electricity during tests in November
1985, before it received an operating license, but that was
non-nuclear power generated by the system's heater and pumps.
   The $6.5 billion plant was licensed in March after years of
delays. Opponents who claim the plant is unsafe and that the
surrounding area cannot be evacuated in an emergency have fought
the reactor in the courts, through the regulatory process and in
mass demonstrations since construction began in 1976.
   The long delays and rising costs _ the original cost was
projected at less than $1 billion _ forced its lead owner, Public
Service Co. of New Hampshire, into bankruptcy court in January
1988. Public Service is in the process of being taken over by
Northeast Utilities of Connecticut.

   The dollar moved lower against the yen Wednesday
morning, reversing its opening gains, while stocks recovered from
early losses to post moderate gains.
   The dollar closed the morning session at 150.55 yen, down from
Tuesday's close of 150.70 yen. After opening stronger at 151.05
yen, the U.S. currency ranged between 151.38 yen and 150.55 yen.

percent, ending the morning session at 32,975.22. The Nikkei index
lost 373.94 points on Tuesday.
   A trader with Nomura Securities Co. said the yen's early
weakness against the dollar discouraged market players and sent the
index plunging more than 350 points before rebounding at midmorning.
   Buying of technology issues that are expected to benefit from a
weaker yen helped the market recover, said the dealer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   In currency dealings, the dollar strengthened to 151.60 yen in
Sydney market earlier Wednesday and then was pushed down to around
150.50 yen in Tokyo on profit-taking, said Masato Hayashi, a dealer
with the Bank of Tokyo.
   The dollar rose earlier because ``market players were mainly
selling the yen to buy back the (West German) mark that had been
oversold against the yen,'' he said.
   Dollar-yen dealing was relatively inactive ahead of the
announcement of May U.S. unemployment figures on Friday, he said.
   ``Currently, there is little yen-buying incentive here,''
Hayashi said.
   The benchmark No.119 10-year Japanese government bond fell to
88.02 points from Tuesday's close of 88.51. That boosted the yield
to 6.965 percent from 6.865 percent.
