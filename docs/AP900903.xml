<HEAD>Two Apparently Escape from Prison Where Manuel Noriega is Held</HEAD>

   Two inmates apparently escaped Monday night from
the federal prison where Manuel Noriega is being held pending his
drug trial, police said.
   The deposed Panamanian leader wasn't involved.
   The two inmates were seen scaling a fence on the extensive
grounds of the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center south of
Miami, said prison spokesman Charles Davis. But it was unclear if
the men actually got beyond the outer fence, he said.
   ``Our perimiter patrolman fired on the inmates and claims he hit
one on the shoulder,'' Davis said. ``They may have gotten out of
the perimiter of the property.''
   Police believed they may have gotten into a large public park
nearby.
   Police identified the prisoners as Omar Fernandez, a convicted
bank robber and Charles Carew, who is serving time for cocaine
possession.
   At least three helicopters, squadrons of police officers and
police dogs surrounded the prison.
   Police checked every car leaving the prison grounds and at least
one U.S. Customs helicopter fitted with infrared lights for night
vision hovered over the area.
   Guards searched inside the prison grounds, but the most of the
search concentrated outside the fence.
   Many of the inmates are allowed relative freedom inside the
wooded, 48-acre compound southwest of Miami. But Noriega is under
constant watch by a guard posted outside his specially built cell
in the administration building.
   The medium-security MCC was designed to hold 425 inmates between
trips to the federal courthouse in Miami, about 25 miles away. Now
more than 1,100 live there, sleeping two to a cell, taxing the
ability of guards to watch over them. About 700 of the inmates are
in pretrial detention, 300 were returned from prisons outside
Florida to await trials here and about 100 inmates are serving full
sentences.
   Security was tightened after Barry Kramer, a former powerboat
racing champion serving life without parole for leading a drug
trafficking ring, arranged for a friend to pick him up by
helicopter in April.
   The copter crashed into the fence surrounding an exercise yard,
injuring both the would-be escapee and the pilot.
   Three successful escapes have occurred since 1981, Davis said.
Once, a prisoner walked out the front door with visitors _ made up
in lipstick and dressed in his wife's clothes.
   Another inmate slipped out by hanging onto the undercarriage of
a Dade County bookmobile. He was captured two years later.
   The third rode out in a trash bin, and narrowly escaped being
compacted.

   President Bush wrapped up a three-week
vacation Monday and returned to the White House to get ready for
his summit in Helsinki with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   White House aides said Bush's trip may be extended an additional
day to give the president a chance to meet on Saturday with Finish
President Mauno Koivisto. In that case, Bush will leave for Finland
on Friday, said deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk.
   The president will meet with Gorbachev for about five hours on
Sunday, including luncheon talks, and then return to Washington.
   The crisis in the Middle East tops the agenda, although the
president and White House aides have stressed that several other
subjects _ including progress toward an agreement on reducing
troops and tanks in Europe _ will also be discussed in some detail.
   Side meetings between aides to Bush and Gorbachev are not
planned for this summit, said an official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Such sessions usually are standard during summit
meetings.
   Another official described the one-day session as more an
``informal meeting'' between the two leaders.
   Bush has said he does not expect the Soviet Union to mediate
between Iraq and the United States. But the administration would
welcome any pressure Gorbachev can bring against Iraq, a longtime
recipient of Soviet arms.
   Popadiuk said there was ``no doubt'' Bush would spend much time
in the days ahead preparing for his third summit with Gorbachev,
but that there were few details of the president's schedule at this
time.
   ``I'm assuming he'll take into acount the view of allied
leaders,'' Popadiuk said.
   In advance of other summits with Gorbachev, the president spent
hours on the phone conferring with other western leaders.
   Members of Congress begin to return to Washington and this week,
and two foreign affairs committees will begin their official
scrutiny of the month-old Persian Gulf crisis.
   Twenty-two House members returned Monday night from a tour of
Bahrain, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, with lawmakers from both parties
supporting the administration.
   ``All of us left here with the conclusion that the president's
action was a correct action,'' said House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo. ``All of us come back believing that is the case.''
   But the House members were concerned about the cost of the
operation, and Gephardt said his colleagues believed the financial
burden should be shared by other nations.
   Budget talks, stalemated when Congress left in early August for
its recess, resume late this week. Administration officials say the
$1-billion-a-month U.S. military operation in the Persian Gulf will
make reaching a deficit-cutting agreement even more difficult.
   Bush spent his final day at his Maine family retreat boating and
playing golf, taking along national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft on both outings.
   He was to meet with his Cabinet on Tuesday to brief it on
developments in the Persian Gulf.
   On Thursday, the president was to travel to Topeka, Kan., and
Tallahassee, Fla., to help raise funds for Republican candidates.
   The trip was expected to give Bush a chance to use a newly
delivered Air Force One for the first time. The new plane, a
converted Boeing 747, is much larger than the current planes used
for Air Force One _ a pair of Boeing 707s that are more than 20
years old.
   Bush was then to take the new plane to Helsinki and back.
   With only a week's advance notice on the summit, White House
aides had little time to work out logistics.
   ``Everybody's scrambling to put their pieces together,'' one
official said.
   Sig Rogich, who oversees White House advance logistics and
imagemaking, ended his vacation early on Sunday to coordinate the
planning.
   Meanwhile, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said that any diplomatic
solution to the Persian Gulf crisis must regain Kuwaiti
sovereignty, assure Saudi Arabian security and ``assure the
integrity of Iraq.''
   Jackson returned from Iraq on Sunday with 47 freed American
hostages after he met for six hours with Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein.
   The civil rights leader and former Democratic presidential
aspirant urged Bush to pursue a diplomatic solution to reverse
Iraq's takeover of Kuwait and cautioned against relying solely on
military pressure.
   ``Just as our generals are in Saudi Arabia with a military
presence, our politicians should be as evident in seeking
diplomatic solutions,'' he said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' on Monday.
   Jackson, who met with Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan as well as
the Iraqi president, said a diplomatic solution must ``regain the
sovereignty of Kuwait, assure the security of Saudi Arabia and
assure the integrity of Iraq.'' He called for an end to the
``drum-beating hostile rhetoric.''
   Jackson, in an interview on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,''
said he challenged Saddam on his takeover of Kuwait, saying the
annexation and his threats against Saudi Arabia were errors.
   Asked to respond to criticism that he was exploiting the
hostages' plight for his own political gains, he said, ``Suffice it
to say, blessed are the peacemakers, even when they are beguiled.''

   Each year the Watkins family of Provo, Utah,
flew east for the best of the Big Apple _ tennis at the U.S. Open,
a room at the Hilton, dinner at Tavern on the Green in Central Park.
   But this year, in the subway, a gang of youths robbed Sherwin
Watkins, punched his wife, Karen, and killed their 22-year-old son,
Brian, when he fought back.
   Brian Watkins was stabbed once in the chest during the robbery
Sunday evening in midtown Manhattan. He was chasing his family's
attackers when he collapsed on the subway station platform, and
died 40 minutes later at a hospital.
   Late Monday, seven youths were arrested on murder and robbery
charges in the subway system's 18th killing this year.
   The Watkinses were ``huge tennis buffs,'' according to a friend,
and the trip to the Open at the National Tennis Center in the New
York City borough of Queens was an annual celebration.
   ``They went back there every year for the Open,'' said the
family's Mormon bishop, David G. ``Doc'' Hansen. ``I don't know how
many years they did it, but it was almost a tradition.''
   He said Brian Watkins was a tennis star at Provo High School and
went to Idaho State University on a tennis scholarship. He also
taught the sport at a club in Provo, where his parents are ardent
tennis players.
   Police said the family, including son Todd and his wife,
Michelle, were waiting for a train in the station at 53rd Street
and Seventh Avenue to go to Tavern on the Green, just two stops
away.
   About 10:20 p.m., they were approached by a group of about nine
young men, one carrying a knife, another a box cutter. They sliced
open Sherwin Watkins' pants and took a money clip containing about
$200 and some credit cards, and they punched his wife in the face.
   Todd and Brian interceded, but one of the men stabbed Brian.
Before collapsing, he tried to give chase.
   The robbers, described by police as being between the ages of 16
and 20, fled up a stairway and escaped.
   Police arrested seven youths Monday on robbery and murder
charges in the case, said police Chief Joseph DeMartino. Two others
who had been questioned in the case were freed, he said.
   ``We are certain that these seven are the principal actors,''
DeMartino said at a late night news conference, adding that more
arrests were possible.
   Five of the seven youths went to a dance club right after the
attack, DeMartino said. The motive for the attack appeared to be to
get money to spend at the Roseland Ballroom, less than a block from
the subway station where the attack took place.
   DeMartino said several weapons were recovered, including one
cardboard cutter with expendable blades. He said the murder weapon
was a folding butterfly knife, which would be analyzed by the
medical examiner's office for traces of blood.
   Sherwin Watkins was treated at a hospital for a cut to the back
of his leg and released. His wife was treated for a mouth cut.
   Sharon Sandgren, a family friend in Provo, described Brian
Watkins as ``an easy going, soft-spoken guy. He wasn't a violent
person. If he was going to get in a fight, something would have
really had to provoke him.''
   Another friend, Debbie Jaspering, said she'd seen the family at
the tennis tournament several days ago, before she returned to
Provo.
   ``They were having a great time,'' she said.
   ``My sister and I had been nervous, you know, two women alone in
the city,'' she said. ``And this happens to the Watkinses, with
three men there. It's crazy.''

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wolfgang Jung had spent his first two years
in college absorbing communist economics when, abruptly, the world
changed. So did his homework.
   Jung is spending his last two years of college cramming for
capitalism at East Berlin's College of Economics, where even the
teachers are taking a crash course in free-market thinking.
   The college is part of a vast educational system that is both
trying to reshape itself quickly and continuing to train young
people for jobs that may not exist on graduation day.
   Nearly 2.1 million East Germans from elementary to graduate
level are beginning a new school year that will be much different
from the previous 42.
   Millions of new textbooks free of communist ideology have
flooded in from West Germany. Bloated departments devoted to
Marxist-Leninist theory have been dissolved.
   Hundreds of Russian-language teachers spent the summer learning
to teach English. More than one-third of the nation's 1 million
teachers are enrolled in retraining programs.
   On the secluded campus where the Communist secret police once
learned their fearsome skills, music, science and languages are
taught to an ordinary student body.
   Still, experts say, the changes are almost superficial.
   Most of the old teachers, former guardians of ideology and
components of a vast domestic intelligence network, will be back in
their classrooms.
   All principals, rectors and chancellors were fired, but the
communities entrusted with refilling those jobs returned more than
half to their former positions.
   What has happened to East Germany's schools in the year since
communism fell is only the beginning of a process that may need a
generation to complete, the experts say.
   For Jung and others in the Class of '92, that is too long.
   ``I didn't know what a corporation was when we began learning a
market economy,'' said Jung, 24, sitting in the school cafeteria
bent over a West German textbook.
   ``It was socialism, socialism, socialism. Now we have to go back
to the beginning.''
   The democratic government elected in March has only begun
decentralizing the system, reteaching the teachers and eliminating
the rigidity of lesson plans, said Hans-Joachim Meyer, the
education minister.
   Meyer believes the five state governments that will be created
Oct. 14, to fit in with the West German system, will have a more
formidable task when they assume full responsibility for the
schools.
   He said the hardest job will be to change the way people think,
to instill individuality and imagination in a system dulled by
decades of restrictive, paranoid Stalinism.
   ``We need probably four to five years to introduce the necessary
structures,'' he said. ``But in order to develop new attitudes
toward life, toward society: yes, that will take a generation.''
   Meshing the East German education system with West Germany's is
another problem. East German students, for example, need 12 years
of schooling to qualify for a university, while West Germans must
have 13.
   ``It is a major problem to get East Germany to fit into the
whole context,'' said Monika Renz, a researcher for the Standing
Conference of Education Ministers of the 11 West German states.
   The group is debating how to merge the systems, and ``not all
the states are convinced'' East German schools are up to par, she
said.
   All have agreed, some grudgingly, to allow East Germans equal
access to West German universities, with admission quotas based on
percentages of East German applicants.
   East German educators bristle at criticism of their schools and
what they feel is condescension by West Germans.
   ``They give us their textbooks, their lectures, their
seminars,'' said Heidi Klemm, who teaches English. ``They say,
`It's all rubbish, your schools'.''
   She pointed out that the exodus to West Germany last year, which
helped bring down the Communist government in East Germany, was
largely of people judged to be highly skilled.
   Ms. Klemm spoke while strolling across her college campus
outside the small farm community of Golm, 25 miles south of Berlin
and just outside Potsdam.
   Ivy covers many buildings and barbed wire rings the periphery.
The college was the officers' training school of the former Stasi
secret police, where only the brightest in the feared organization
could gain admittance.
   Stasi students and faculty were expelled late last year and the
school was converted into an extension of a teacher's college in
Potsdam.
   The Potsdam school occupies beautiful colonnaded buildings in a
complex of 19th century palaces and gardens built for Frederick the
Great, the Prussian king. In them, nearly 3,000 students study
languages, medicine, art and geography.
   It is the largest teachers' college in East Germany, and has a
severe case of nerves.
   All administrators of all schools were dismissed in June.
Committees of local officials, students, parents and teachers have
been meeting to recommend who should be retained.
   The Potsdam school's committee began work Sept. 1.
   ``If you come here in January, maybe someone else will be
sitting here,'' Knut Kiesant, the vice chancellor, said in his
spacious office.
   Kiesant has been with the school for six years and Wolfgang
Strauss, director of international relations, for 25. Both say
people who rose to high levels in the old regime are being
persecuted.
   ``Whether I am good or I am bad is not a question of black or
white, as a child would decide,'' Strauss said.
   Both men said they favor the new politics in East Germany.
   Most school committees have completed their work and more than
half, perhaps 65 percent, rehired their old administrators, said
Meyer, the education minister.
   He attributed that to a lack of qualified alternative
candidates, apathy in local committees and deference to the old
headmasters.
   Meyer predicted more administrators would be replaced when the
new state governments took over, but recommended against wholesale
dismissals of teachers.
   Teachers are such a large group, he said, that they deserve a
chance to change with the changing society.
   Many may be weeded out by economic collapse. Unpaid bills are
mounting at the Potsdam school and it has a 5-1 ratio of students
to teachers, compared with 30-1 in West Germany, Strauss said.
   Economic problems are increasing across the country, presaging
hard times for students nearing graduation.
   Agriculture students have learned techniques applicable only to
the dying collective farms. Thousands of trade school students are
apprenticed to factories expected to close.
   No school has had to shift gears more quickly than the
4,500-student College of Economics.
   About 60 of the 200 professors have been replaced with Western
experts, said Hans-Peter Krueger, the new vice chancellor.
   Krueger said the school added crash programs so students and
teachers could catch up with capitalism.
   ``We not only have to learn how to teach a market economy, we
have to teach how to live in a market economy,'' he said.

   Robert Ostman spotted Sen. Dave
Durenberger's state fair booth right between the Cider and Nut Hut
and a stand hawking inflatable Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
   The 68-year-old man was ready to give the Minnesota Republican a
piece of his mind. Ostman is one Minnesotan who says he voted for
Durenberger before but won't vote for him again.
   ``What were you thinking?'' queried Ostman, face to face with
his senator. ``You thought you could get by with it. You had a good
thing going and you blew it.''
   Later, a teen-ager in braces brought Durenberger a different
message. ``The only difference between you and the rest of them is
that they didn't get caught,'' he said.
   ``I hope you'll be able to support me,'' Durenberger replied
softly.
   Durenberger had expected this ever since he was formally
denounced on the floor of the Senate on July 25 for financial
wrongdoing. The Senate found that he violated its rules by
laundering speaking fees through a book contract and billing the
government when he stayed in his Minneapolis condominium.
   Some senators used the long August recess to relax on long
vacations before the post-Labor Day crunch of congressional
business.
   But Durenberger, whose support in public opinion polls has
plunged, faces a long period of political rehabilitation. Before
heading to Saudi Arabia with a congressional delegation Friday, he
attended much of the two-week Minnesota State Fair to take what
came from the 1.5 million who visit it each year.
   In some of them, he found support. A knot of well-wishers stayed
around Durenberger, who posed with fair-goers for an aide's
Polaroid camera and listened patiently to constituents.
   ``Stay in there; we're behind you 100 percent,'' said an elderly
woman who identified herself as Matilda.
   Durenberger had braced himself for the worst. The
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party booth down the street was passing out
buttons that read: ``I Paid More Rent Than Dave Durenberger,'' a
reference to his condo deal.
   Minnesotans are known for their congenial manner, a collective
personality trait known as ``Minnesota Nice.'' But some fair-goers
let Durenberger know they were disappointed in him or couldn't
understand how he got off so easy, as they saw it, for ``stealing''
from the government.
   Earl Cromey, a retired railroad worker from Stillwater, demanded
to know why Durenberger was still in office if former House Speaker
Jim Wright was out.
   ``He quit on his own. He made the decision,'' Durenberger
explained.
   Durenberger insists that he was acting in good faith when he
pursued the schemes that resulted in the Senate's disciplinary
action. Durenberger was first elected to the Senate in 1978 and his
current term expires in 1994. He has not said whether he would run
again.
   ``Somehow they think I stole $40,000 from the government,''
Durenberger said in an interview before heading to the fairgrounds.
   ``I can't change people's minds about what they think are the
facts. I'll just have to change their minds about how they view me
as a senator,'' he said.

<HEAD>S&amp;L Prison Terms Average Longer Than Other White Collar Crimes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Virtually all those convicted of savings and
loan fraud are first-time offenders, but they are getting harsher
prison sentences than the typical white-collar criminal, according
to Justice Department figures.
   ``These are traditionally no-record defendants,'' said Marvin
Collins, the U.S. attorney in Dallas, whose office has prosecuted
about a quarter of the major S&amp;L cases. ``They appear often very
contrite at sentencing and generally make sympathetic defendants
for sentencing.
   ``Given all of that, I feel reasonably comfortable with the
types of sentences that we have been receiving,'' Collins said.
``Most of the people are receiving jail time.''
   There were 128 people convicted since Oct. 1, 1988, who received
average prison sentences of 3.2 years, according to department
statistics.
   That compares with an average 2.5 years for all federal fraud
cases, including embezzlement and forgery, according to a study
compiled last year by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice
Statistics. That study used figures from 1987, the most recent year
available.
   The average sentence for embezzlement in 1987 was 1.8 years
while the average sentence for mail and wire fraud was 2.6 years.
   Thirty-seven of those convicted for S&amp;L crimes since Oct. 1,
1988, have not been jailed.
   The Justice Department defines a major S&amp;L case as one involving
fraud or loss of more than $100,000 or in which the defendant was
an executive or officer of a thrift institution.
   Sentences have ranged from probation to the 30-year term given
Woody F. Lemons, former chairman of the failed Vernon Savings &amp;
Loan Association near Dallas, earlier this year.
   Lemons, who could have been sentenced to 65 years in jail, was
convicted of 13 counts of bank fraud, misapplication of funds,
conspiracy and bank bribery.
   Other important sentences include:
   _A 15-year prison term given to Robert Hopkins, former chairman
of Commodore Savings Association in Dallas, for making illegal
campaign contributions with the thrift's money and concealing the
donations from federal regulators. He also was ordered to pay
restitution of $122,980.
   _The 12-year prison terms given to Oscar Tharp, president, and
John O'Donnell, the vice president, of First Mutual Savings
Association of Pensacola, Fla., for conspiring to steal money from
the S&amp;L through kickback schemes involving multimillion-dollar bank
loans for Georgia real estate projects.
   _The 12-year sentence that Julian Seidel, president of First
Maryland Savings and Loan received for embezzlement by approving
speculative loans. Losses to the Silver Spring, Md., thrift were
estimated at $60 million. Senior Vice President James Porter
received a seven-year prison term.
   The average is brought down by a large number of defendants who
are shown leniency in exchange for cooperating with federal
investigators to help convict higher-level officers or executives.
   ``We always make cooperation known to the court'' at the time of
sentencing, Collins said.
   ``We want other people out there to distinguish between those
people who are willing to cooperate and testify against others who
have broken the law and those who want to thumb their noses at the
system,'' Collins said.
   Short prison sentences or probation were imposed on defendants
in cases in which the fraud was not directly related to the failure
of a thrift institution, Collins said.
   Because most of the S&amp;L crimes occurred before new government
sentencing guidelines took effect, those serving time will become
eligible for parole after serving a third of the prison term, minus
good time.
   By comparison, many of the defendants convicted in the Justice
Department's investigation of Pentagon procurement fraud _
nicknamed ``Operation Ill Wind''_ were sentenced under the
guidelines, which do not allow for parole.
   The major figures in the ``Ill Wind'' investigations have
received sentences ranging from 18 months to nearly three years.
   Sentences for the major participants in the recent
insider-trading scandal on Wall Street ranged from two months for
trader Martin Siegel to four years for investor Paul Bilzerian.
Ivan Boesky received a 3-year sentence and paid $100 million in
fines and restitution.
   Members of Congress often like to compare S&amp;L fraud to bank
robbery, an analogy that makes law enforcement officials wince.
These officials note that bank robbers are often armed.
   The Justice Department study of 1987 sentences found that the
average sentence for defendants convicted of federal robbery
charges was 12.3 years. But unlike the S&amp;L offenders, many of these
criminals were not first-time offenders.
   A study by the U.S. Sentencing Commission found that first-time
offenders convicted of robbery were sentenced in 1985 to average
sentences ranging between 2.5 years and 4.7 years, depending on the
amount involved in the holdup.

had nearly 1,000 people,'' said Roy Barrund, one of the race
organizers and the licensee of the local hotel.
   More than 90 blue tongues, frillies, frizzies and shellbacks
were auctioned to take part in the races, with the top price of
$120 going for a smart-looking shellback caught sleeping the day
before on a sand dune just outside town.
   The auction and races afterward raised several thousand of
dollars for the Royal Flying Doctors, a rural airborne medical
service, and for a new wing at the hospital in nearby Cunnamulla.
   The even is held each year and draws visitors from across
Australia to the small community 500 miles west of Brisbane.
   None of the local residents contacted Monday could remember the
name of the winner of the main race.
   ``He was a blue tongue. A 20-to-1 outsider, and the bookie
really cleaned up,'' said Barrund, who also cleaned up.
   ``Our pub takings run to $6,000 on a good week. Last weekend we
topped $20,000,'' he said.

   Justice Minister Shin Hasegawa collapsed Monday
during a ceremony at the palace and was being treated for what was
believed to be a stroke, officials said.
   Akio Takagi, a neurologist at Tokyo's Toranomon Hospital, said
Hasegawa's right arm and leg were paralyzed. He said Hasegawa was
conscious.
   Hasegawa, 71, was attending a ceremony at the Imperial Palace
for the appointment of newly selected Supreme Court Justice Ryohei
Kizaki when he collapsed.
   The minister was taken to Toranomon Hospital by ambulance after
court doctors gave him emergency treatment.
   Hasegawa, a Liberal Democrat, has been elected three times to
the House of Councilors from Niigata state, in central Japan.

   The government asked the country's private industry
Monday to help support the multinational force in the Persian Gulf
by providing jeeps, car-carrying ships and other products and
services.
   Also, the Kyodo News Service reported from Baghdad that Iraq was
urging Japan to partly lift sanctions in return for the release of
Japanese men being held at strategic installations in Iraq.
   The Kyodo report said Iraq's cultural and information minister,
Latif Nasif Al-Jasim, declared in an interview that Iraq would
release the Japanese hostages if Japan resumed buying Iraqi oil and
allowed Iraq to buy food and medicine.
   International Trade and Industry Minister Kabun Muto sought
cooperation in a meeting with leaders of six major industries _
automobiles, steel, electronics, construction, machinery and
plastic _ said a ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   On Wednesday, nearly a month after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu announced an aid package of $1
billion for the U.S.-led force arrayed against Iraq and further
assistance for Middle East countries hurt by the embargo on Baghdad.
   The package is to include a medical team of about 100 people,
transport of food, water and medical supplies by chartered civil
aircraft and ships, and the provision of items such as water and
prefabricated housing for troops.
   Nissan Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. said they received
requests Monday from the trade and transport ministries to make
their ships available for the support effort.
   Nissan spokeswoman Keiko Tanaka said the company has contracts
for eight vessels, including two owned by Nissan Motor Carrier Co.
Ltd., a Nissan subsidiary, to export vehicles. The average vessel
is capable of carrying 5,000 cars, and one trip takes about a
month, she said.
   Toyota spokesman Yoshiharu Tateishi said Toyota already has
agreed with U.S. shipowners that it would contribute its
U.S.-registered vessels to the Middle East effort upon U.S.
government request. Of Toyota's 23 contracts, at least a few are
for U.S.-registered ships, Tateishi said.
   He said the Japanese government has asked Toyota to contribute
four-wheel-drive jeeps.
   ``We are willing to send items to armed forces of any nation
fighting for peace in the Middle East,'' said the Foreign Ministry
official.
   Japan insists that it is not sending items for military use.
   ``We believe four-wheel-drive land cruisers are not to be used
for military purposes. We are trying to send items that soldiers
need for their daily lives,'' the official said.
   Japan's constitution bans the use of force as a means of
settling international disputes and forbids the maintenance of
land, air and sea forces. Since the early 1950s, that has been
interpreted as allowing a purely defensive military.

   An earthquake shook the northwestern

the streets.
   The quake, whose epicenter was 10 miles northwest of the
Croatian capital, measured 4.6 on the Richter scale, Zagreb's
Geophysical Institute of Seismology said. There were no immediate
reports of damages or injuries.
   A temblor with a magnitude of 5 can cause considerable damage.
   The quake, which occured at 12:48 p.m., was felt as far south as
Bulgaria, where the state news agency Tanjug reported moderate
tremors but no damage.

<HEAD>Cellular Phone Subscriptions Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cellular phone subscriptions grew nearly 25
percent in the first half of 1990 despite economic hard times in
some industries that depend on mobile communications, an industry
group said Monday.
   ``In the face of a quivering economy, cellular continues to be
extremely strong,'' said Robert W. Maher, president of the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association.
   The average bill paid by subscribers of the 4.4 million cellular
phones declined slightly in the first six months of the year, to
$83.94 from $89.30, while the average length of calls remained
about the same at 2.3 minutes, according to an association survey.
   Maher said a cellular phone increasingly is considered an
essential item _ not a luxury _ by industries such as construction
and real estate that have been hit recently with business slowdowns.
   ``It shows increasing public and business acceptance of cellular
at a time when the economy was not growing very much,'' said
Charles J. Many, president of NYNEX Mobile Communications and
chairman of the association.
   The survey of 552 cellular companies found that 859,742
subscribers were added between Jan. 1 and June 30, a 24.5 percent
growth rate. By comparison, 817,151 subscribers were added from
June 1989 through December 1989, a growth rate of 30.3 percent.
   Maher said the industry no longer was experiencing the huge
growth rates of the mid-1980s when cellular first began, but that
its growth was steady. Any declines have been more in usage than in
subscribership, he said.
   ``Companies facing a little problem with the bottom line are
probably cautioning on the use of cellular, to make sure it's
business only,'' Maher said.
   Industry service revenues were up 10 percent in the first six
months of this year, to $2.13 billion.
   The industry has grown from 32 systems in December 1984,
representing a total capital investment of $354.8 million, to 592
systems with a total capital investment of $5.2 billion at the end
of June. The $5.2 billion is 16 percent above December 1989.

   Government troops broke through rebel
cordons at a besieged army garrison, securing an important victory
in Sri Lanka's civil war, military officials said Monday.
   At least 53 Tamil rebels were killed over the weekend in bitter
hand-to-hand fighting, said the officials, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. They did not mention any army casualties.
   The garrison in the northern district of Mullaitivu, 175 miles
northeast of Colombo, is in heavy jungle. Tamil rebels are believed
to have set up their headquarters in the area.
   The military officials said troop reinforcements parachuted into
the garrison and others fought their way to the camp from the
nearby coast.
   There was no independent confirmation of the government claim
and no comment from the rebels.
   The Tamil rebels have held out against repeated government
attempts to break the siege of another army garrison, located in a
17th century Dutch fort in the northern city of Jaffna.
   Fighting between the rebels and the army resumed June 11 after a
13-month cease-fire.
   Tamil rebels have been fighting for an independent homeland
since 1983, claiming their community is discriminated against by
the majority Sinhalese, who dominate the army and the government.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed since the insurgency
began.

   Sixteen Israeli soldiers were wounded during a
nighttime parachute exercise in southern Israel, and six of them
required hospitalization, Israel radio and doctors said Monday.
   The army command confirmed the report but gave no details.
   Dr. Haim Reuven, director of Soroka Hospital in Beersheva, said
16 soldiers were brought to the emergency room Sunday night with
leg, arm and head injuries. Six were hospitalized.
   Israel radio said the accident was caused by high winds during
the parachuting exercise. It said all the injured were reservists.
   It was the Israeli military's third training accident in a
little more than four months.
   On July 17, five Israeli soldiers were killed and 10 were
wounded when a stray artillery shell landed near a reserve unit
conducting a tank exercise.
   On April 23, seven Israeli airmen were killed when their
transport helicopter crashed during a flight over the occupied West
Bank.
   Reserve Brig. Gen. Ephraim Hiram, a parachute commander, told
Israel radio the latest accident was not especially serious.
   ``When someone breaks a leg it hurts of course, but 16 injuries
during a parachute exercise is not an exceptionally large number,''
he said.
   Last year, four soldiers were killed and 24 injured in ground
training exercises.

   Endangered species pop up in the strangest
places. Like flowerbeds.
   Plant-protection activists say some species of bulbs bought to
decorate American and European gardens are being collected by the
millions in the wild, threatening to wipe out those flowers in
their home turf.
   ``The world would lose an irreplaceable treasure,'' said
Marjorie Arundel of Warrenton, Va., an adviser to the Garden Club
of America's horticulture committee. ``They're the ancestors of all
of our spring bulbs today.''
   Mrs. Arundel and other activists are urging American gardeners
to buy only commercially propagated plants, which experts say make
up at least 99 percent of the flower trade anyway.
   ``Wild-collected flowers are a small percentage of the trade,
but a large percentage of certain kinds of plants,'' said Faith
Campbell, director of the plant conservation program for the
Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.
   Working with the World Wildlife Fund and the Garden Club of
America, the NRDC has produced leaflets calling on gardeners to
avoid most kinds of cyclamen, sternbergia and galanthus, or
snowdrops, which they say are collected in the wild in Turkey.
   Those three species are listed as endangered in the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and
Flora, or CITES. But this treaty _ effective in fighting trade in
some endangered animal skins, horns and tusks _ has had little
effect on the flower trade, Ms. Campbell said.
   Snowdrops are greatly depleted in Turkey's Mediterranean
regions, forcing traders to seek out sources in more remote regions.
   The popular ``Angel's Tears'' narcissus are being collected in
the wild, but experts are not sure if the source is Portugal or
somewhere else.
   Other wildflowers, such as trillium, are being collected from
the wild in the United States and Canada. Japan, China, India and
the Soviet Union appear to be the sources for still other rare
flowers.
   Some species of these plants may be produced by growers in the
United States or Europe, but buyers are being counseled to check
the origins as carefully as they can.
   This may become easier, as a result of the decision last May by
the Dutch Commodity Board for Ornamental Horticultural Products to
require exporters to use a ``Bulbs from Wild Sources'' label to
identify wild-collected plants.
   Under the negotiated agreement, Dutch exporters will also label
their cultivated bulbs, beginning in 1992 for minor species and in
1995 for such major bulb varieties as tulips and hyacinths.
   Because the Netherlands has long dominated the world flower
trade, the action by the Dutch regulatory body should have a major
impact, Ms. Campbell said. It is not binding, though, on dealers in
the United States or other countries.
   Also, the agreement was reached too late for most of this fall's
catalogs. So even if American gardeners order from Dutch dealers
covered by the rules, they might not know they were buying
wild-collected flowers until the bulbs arrive in the mail, labeled
``wild sources.''
   ``We can just hope they won't order those again,'' Ms. Campbell
said. ``It is a messy phasing-in.''
   The long-range solution, she said, could be in helping people in
Turkey and elsewhere who make money from collecting wild flowers to
start propagating the rare flowers in or near the native habitat,
she said.
   Gardeners shouldn't think they're aiding nature by keeping alive
a species that might be disappearing in its native habitat.
   ``We don't consider that a contribution to conservation in any
way,'' Ms. Campbell said. ``It's not playing its role in the
ecosystem in which it evolved.''

<HEAD>Foreign Minister Levy Faces A Difficult Task In His New Post</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a recent improvement in U.S.-Israeli
relations, Foreign Minister David Levy's visit to Washington may
prove the most difficult task in his three months as Israel's chief
diplomat.
   Levy, who is scheduled to meet Wednesday with Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, declared when he was named foreign minister in
June that improving ties with Washington would be his chief goal.
   Then, relations with the United States were touchy because of
Israel's refusal to agree to U.S.-proposed compromises meant to
open a peace dialogue with Palestinians. The right-wing Likud bloc,
leading the new government, was the chief opponent of the American
proposals.
   Since then, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the American buildup
in the Persian Gulf have helped change views in Israel's favor.
   Israel's repeated warnings that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
posed a danger to the world have proven true. Israel's adamant
refusal to talk to the Palestine Liberation Organization is viewed
more favorably because of the PLO's backing for Saddam.
   Washington, which gives Israel $3 billion a year in military and
economic aid, is reportedly open to hearing Israel's request for
additional sophisticated weapons. Levy is expected to raise the
topic at his meetings with Baker and other U.S. officials.
   Still, the main stumbling block in Israeli-U.S. relations _ the
Palestinian problem _ will not disappear from the agenda, Israeli
officials say.
   Israeli officials are concerned that President Bush's
administration, eager to please the new Arab allies who have joined
the campaign against Iraq, will apply pressure on Israel to make
concessions for peace.
   Levy's reputation as a hard-liner may make the talks more
difficult. As housing minister since 1979, he played a key role in
building many of the 130 Jewish settlements in the occupied
territories. Washington defines the settlements as obstacles to
peace.
   Levy also was instrumental in pressuring Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir to reject Baker's proposals for an Israeli-Palestinian
dialogue.
   Critics say Levy's communication with American officials may be
hampered by his lack of experience in foreign policy and weak
command of English.
   ``Sometimes ministers prefer to meet alone,'' noted an Israeli
government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``But
here there will certainly have to be someone else in on the meeting
unless he (Baker) has learned Hebrew.''
   Israeli newspapers already have blamed Levy for at least two
gaffes as foreign minister.
   Last month, Levy demanded immediate distribution of gas masks to
civilians following threats from Iraq of a chemical attack. Critics
saw the demand as linked more to his rivalry with Defense Minister
Moshe Arens, who opposed such a move, than to concern for public
safety.
   Levy also reportedly leaked an Israeli-Egyptian plan to open
Israel's border so as to ease the exodus of Egyptian refugees from
Iraq coming home via Jordan. Both Jordan and Egypt were embarrassed
by the public revelation, and the plan was canceled.
   Supporters say, however, that the Moroccan-born Levy's fluency
in Arabic and his familiarity with the Arab world could become an
important asset in possible peace negotiations with the Arab states
and the Palestinians.
   Levy, a fiery orator who immigrated to Israel in 1957, worked
his way up from ditchdigger to the highest-ranking job ever held by
a North African immigrant. He is seen as a symbol of the
integration advocated by Israel's founding fathers.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Mickey Edwards has found it hard to talk
about the budget and the federal deficit lately as he campaigns for
re-election in his Oklahoma district.
   ``All of the speeches I gave in the last week ended up being
primarily discussions of Iraq,'' the seven-term Republican said. At
coffees, public forums, civic clubs, ``every question I would get
was about Iraq... for me, it's shoved everything else off the
table.''
   Edwards is not unique. Across the country this election season,
the crisis in the Middle East has thrown carefully laid campaign
plans aside and blunted the efforts of challengers to attack
incumbents' records. In some cases, campaigns are locked in a
virtual freeze frame.
   For incumbents, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait was at least a temporary windfall.
   It meant that instead of answering questions about why Congress
didn't prevent the savings and loan scandal, or why it can't
balance the budget, lawmakers were in sudden demand as local
experts on foreign policy.
   In some places, political discourse has been reduced to a
contest to see which candidate can most strongly support President
Bush's troop deployment and denounce Saddam in the harshest terms.
   Nearly three dozen members of the House and Senate traveled to
the Middle East last weekend, and the days and weeks ahead will be
consumed with hearings on foreign policy, military policy, energy
policy _ all far removed from the quagmire of issues that
incumbents dread.
   Both Ed Rollins, political director of the Republican House
campaign effort, and Howard Schloss, spokesman for the Democrats'
national House campaign arm, described the Iraq phenomenon in
precisely the same words: ``It's knocked everything else right off
the radar screen.''
   Across the land, the Middle East is popping up on the campaign
trail:
   _ In Washington's northern Virginia suburbs, Democratic
challenger Jim Moran called a news conference to talk about women's
issues, an area he viewed as a weak point for incumbent GOP Rep.
Stan Parris. In response to a question, he urged caution in any
military commitments in the Middle East.
   Parris called his own news conference in response, declaring:
``The only three people I know who support Saddam Hussein's
position are Moammar Gadhafi, Yasser Arafat and Jim Moran.'' Moran
shot back that Parris is ``a deceitful, fatuous jerk... I want to
break his nose.''
   _ Jim Gallaway, the front-runner in Tuesday's Nevada GOP
gubernatorial primary, got a boost and a flurry of publicity when
he was called to active duty by the Marine Corps because of the
gulf crisis. A Marine reserve colonel, he spent a week doing
military logistics work in Arlington, Va., then returned to the
campaign trail.
   _ Democratic Senate candidate Ron Twilegar in Idaho accused GOP
nominee Rep. Larry Craig of accepting $65,000 from the fossil fuel
industry, while allowing his oil company friends to jack up
gasoline prices and take advantage of the Middle East crisis. Craig
responded that he is seeking answers about possible price gouging,
and denied acting against constituents' interests.
   Political analyst and newsletter publisher Charles Cook said the
diversion from politics as usual helps both Republicans, who stood
to lose ground largely because of a weak economy, and incumbents
generally.
   Bush's approval rating, which had been dropping along with
perceptions of the nation's economic health, has been given new
vitality by his handling of the Persian Gulf crisis _ another
factor that benefits GOP candidates.
   ``The economy was starting to snowball as a political issue ...
and then it was stopped,'' Cook said. ``What this may do is ensure
another status-quo election,'' one in which neither party makes
substantial gains.
   Cook and other analysts note, however that Nov. 6 still is more
than two months away, and that the situation in the Middle East is
unpredictable.
   If the Iraq crisis turns into a long-term standoff and the issue
fades from the front pages, the economy, abortion, ethics, the S&amp;L
crisis and the budget all could return as hot political topics,
putting incumbents once again on the defensive.
   But if the gulf region boils over into military conflict, voters
will be grasping for stability and unlikely to make changes, such
as throwing incumbents out of office, the analysts said.
   The result, said Rollins, will be an abbreviated campaign
season. The fall campaign usually kicks into high gear on Labor
Day, but this year the battles will be fought in the final two or
three weeks before the elections, he said.
   Those who spend their lives drafting carefully scripted campaign
battle plans find themselves at the mercy of events.
   Lamented Rollins: ``From a political manager's perspective, it's
the worst of all possible nightmares.''

   A judge Monday ordered a six-month jail sentence
for a train driver who ran a red light and caused a crash that
killed five people and injured 87.
   Robert Morgan, 47, pleaded guilty to two manslaughter charges
arising from the crash at Purley, south London, on March 4, 1989.
   ``I do not believe it is possible to deal with a case such as
this but by a sentence of imprisonment,'' said Justice Ian Kennedy.
   Morgan's train failed to slow down after he passed two warning
signals, and it slammed into the back of a slower train.
   Julian Bevan, the prosecutor, said Morgan's train was traveling
at about 70 mph when it hit the other train.
   The judge issued an 18-month sentence but suspended 12 months
``because you have never pretended it was anyone else at fault and
have never contemplated throwing the dust in the eyes of
investigators. You also have had a particularly good character.''

   ANC leader Nelson Mandela called
Monday for an independent investigation of police partiality
following a judge's ``scathing attack'' on police actions that left
five people dead during a March protest.
   ``The matter is too important to be given to the police, the
very culprit, to investigate,'' Mandela told a news conference in
Soweto.
   He and other black leaders have accused police of aiding Zulu
backers of the conservative Inkatha movement in township battles
with Xhosas and other African National Congress supporters.
   Police found 25 bodies over the weekend after clashes erupted
following several days of relative quiet. The fighting in the
townships near Johannesburg has killed at least 540 people since
Aug. 12.
   Gangs armed with spears, axes and knives fought in Tokoza and
Tembisa townships, and a minibus filled with armed men shot down
residents in the townships, police said. Security forces said they
were unable to stop the killings.
   ``What can you do. We're always too late,'' said one police
officer, who declined to give his name.
   Authorities reinforced police and soldiers patrolling the
townships. Elite army battalions were moved into Johannesburg late
last month to help police.
   President F.W. de Klerk called Sunday for an investigation of
alleged police bias in the recent township violence. De Klerk said
he told Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok to conduct ``an urgent
and in-depth investigation'' into charges made by black political
and church leaders.
   De Klerk and police have repeatedly denied the charges of
anti-ANC bias, saying individual police may have acted improperly
but that the force as a whole was impartial.
   On Saturday, a government inquiry sharply criticized police for
firing on demonstrators in the Sebokeng township last March. Five
blacks were killed and 156 wounded by gunfire.
   Mandela said the Sebokeng report showed the government lacked
control over police.
   ``I think its findings are a very scathing attack on the
training of the police,'' he said. He called for a similar judicial
inquiry of police actions in the townships during the recent
fighting.
   Mandela, just back from a nine-day trip to Norway, Libya,
Algeria and Zambia, also said he rejected a face-to-face meeting
with Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi because ``the question of
violence is not a question of individuals.''
   He said working groups had been formed to try to end the
fighting.
   Buthelezi has repeatedly sought a meeting with Mandela to
discuss the Inkatha-ANC feud, which started five years ago in Natal
Province.
   The ANC charges Inkatha spread the violence to the Johannesburg
area this month to broaden its constituency from the traditional
Zulu homeland. Inkatha charges the ANC is trying to terrorize other
black opposition groups to monopolize power.
   On other issues, Mandela said:
   _he questioned a government plan to study converting migrant
worker hostels in the townships into family dwellings. Much of the
recent fighting has involved township residents and hostel dwellers.
   _he was satisfied with the response of government leaders he met
with during his trip. He refused to discuss details, such as
reports he would ask Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi for money.
   _the governing National Party's move toward opening itself to
non-whites would make little difference to the ANC. ``I doubt if
any black personality of stature would commit suicide by joining
the National Party,'' he said.
   In other developments, two bombs rocked the office late Sunday
of Beeld, a leading pro-government Afrikaans newspaper. A car was
damaged and windows shattered, but there were no injuries.
   A Beeld editor said Monday that an extreme right-wing group
claimed responsibility. Such pro-apartheid groups have used
dynamite in a recent series of bombings to protest government
attempts to end white minority rule.
   Also Monday, 11 ANC members were released from Robben Island
prison near Cape Town. They had been charged with crimes such as
treason and terrorism.
   The government had said it would release up to 15 political
prisoners after the weekend under an agreement with the ANC reached
last month.

   Saudi Arabia has increased oil
production by 2.27 million barrels a day and will give priority to
supplying developing nations hit hardest by the embargo on Iraqi
and Kuwaiti oil, officials said Monday.
   But because of lag time in shipping, it will be several weeks
before these nations see the oil.
   The increased production is designed to make up for the
shortfall created by the U.N. embargo on products from Kuwait and
Iraq, according to Saudi and Western officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Most of the increase derives from Saudi Aramco, the
government-owned oil giant that controls 96 percent of the
country's production.
   Aramco is aiming to produce about 7.5 million barrels a day, up
from 5.3 million, which is about the company's sustainable
capacity, according to Western sources.
   The price of oil on world markets has already fallen from about
$30 a barrel to $26 a barrel in anticipation of the increased
production, the sources said.
   Aramco has a short-term surge capacity of 8.5 million barrels;
company officials said the oil giant peaked at 10 million barrels
in the 1980.
   Many facilities were shut down during the 1980s oil slump. But
even before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Aramco had embarked
on an ambitious multibillion dollar program to refit and retool
production and storage capacity.
   At the heavily guarded shipping terminal here on the Arabian
Gulf, officials are expecting an increase in tanker activity in two
to three weeks.
   ``The decision to increase production was taken only a few days
ago,'' said Mohamed Yones, chief harbor pilot at the huge terminal.
   He said the increase ``will be reflected in more ships coming
here'' in the next several weeks. The delay stems from the lag time
needed to schedule tanker visits, he said.
   Saudi Arabia will give priority to supplying developing
countries whose oil supplies have been cut off, Saudi officials
said. The embargo dried up about 4 million barrels a day.
   The countries suffering most include Turkey, Brazil, the
Philippines, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Taiwan and South Korea,
according to the Middle East Economic Survey, a Nicosia-based
newsletter.
   Next on the list are the Japanese, the newsletter said. In last
place are increases for U.S. and European buyers.
   Roughly 75 percent of Saudi oil exports leave from the Ras
Tannura terminal and two sister terminals.
   On Monday, two tankers were at Ras Tannura, which has docking
space for as many as 25 tankers. At the height of the oil boom in
the 1980s, the complex handled 320 tankers a month, Yones said.
   Aramco has also boosted production of jet fuel and other refined
products to cope with demand from Operation Desert Shield, the
military buildup in the Persian Gulf region.

<HEAD>Pope Laments Misery But Urges Hope</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MWANZA, Tanzania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Monday lamented
that millions of people are living in misery because of the failure
of development policies, but he urged Africans not to give up hope.
   Despite ``so much poverty and suffering, so many instances of
neglect and injustice ... the final word is not one of suffering
and hopelessness, but of love and victory over sin,'' he said.
   The pope, on the third day of a 10-day, four-nation African
pilgrimage, crisscrossed Tanzania, flying from the Indian Ocean
port city of Dar Es Salaam to the southern town of Songea and then
to this northern city on the edge of Lake Victoria.
   John Paul spoke bluntly of Africa's problems and hardships _ a
common theme in his seven visits to the continent. In Tanzania, a
nation of 25 million people, the annual per capita income is below
$200. It is one of the poorest countries on earth.
   The pope compared Africa's plight to the ``original chaos,''
described in the opening of the Book of Genesis _ the world as a
``formless void, (and) there was darkness over the deep.''
   ``That biblical image is a good representation of the real
difficulties and frustrations that accompany the daily life of
millions of our brothers and sisters,'' he said in his homily
during a Mass at Songea.
   The pope said many developing countries had high hopes for the
future when they gained independence but had failed to realize
their promise.
   ``The failure of development is evident in continuing hunger and
malnutrition, in the plight of refugees, in exposure to disease and
the lack of even basic health care.
   ``It can also be seen in scarcity of educational facilities, of
decent living conditions, of productive employment, in unfair
competition for positions, in the crime, corruption and unscupulous
ambition present at many levels of social life.
   ``How many young people are deeply affected by the lack of hope
that overshadows their future.''
   Still, John Paul said Africans can retain hope in the future if
there is a ``a new attitude, diametrically opposed to a selfish
desire for profit and the thirst for power.''
   ``The change of attitude which the world so urgently needs is
not brought about by ideological tensions or social conflicts,'' he
said. ``The love we are speaking about includes a profound respect
for the dignity of every person, without discrimination of any
kind, and effective service of others.''
   About 25,000 people, many waving Tanzanian and Vatican flags,
attended the Mass in a dirt field in the middle of the African
savannah. The pope spoke in English, with several passages of
Swahili mixed in, from an altar with a bamboo backdrop.
   He received the traditional welcome of African dance and music,
including a performance at the Songea airport by a group of tribal
warriors with spears and animal-skin shields.
   After the Mass, the pope flew to Mwanza, a city of 200,000
people on the southern shores of Africa's biggest lake, to visit
the cathedral and give his blessing to 26 sick people.
   On Tuesday he will celebrate Mass in Mwanza, fly to Tabora for
another service and then travel to Moshi at the foot of Mount
Kilimanjaro, Africa's tallest mountain.
   The pope's tour will also take him to Burundi, Rwanda and Ivory
Coast.

   Lupe Vasquez is spending the waning days
of summer with her family _ farm workers who live in a ramshackle
homeless shelter on the edge of town.
   This fall, she'll return to Stanford University, where she hopes
to maintain her B-plus average as a sophomore studying science and
engineering.
   ``I'd like to think the second year will be easier. But I don't
think so,'' the 18-year-old said. ``I'm going to have harder
classes and a heavier load.''
   When she graduated second in a class of 397 students from Oxnard
High School in June 1989, she was accepted by six California
universities. She chose Stanford because she thought it had the
best science program.
   Stanford, with annual costs topping $21,000, also is the most
expensive university in the state. She's using private
scholarships, state and federal grants and loans to pay for her
education, and she's saving money from her two summer jobs.
   On a recent weekday, the teen-ager sat at a table in the
enclosed patio of a family friend's home, studying calculus and
listening to Spanish pop music.
   ``I don't even want to remember my first year, it was so hard,''
she recalled with a grimace. ``My brain was just going all the
time. I could never get to sleep before 3 in the morning. And
finals were just awful.
   ``The first two to three weeks I really felt homesick,'' said
Ms. Vasquez. ``I wanted to see my mom. I wanted to go back to the
Zoe.''
   That's the Zoe Christian Center, a former Japanese internment
camp that is now a homeless shelter.
   Ms. Vasquez's mother, stepfather and four younger siblings have
shared crowded rooms there for two years, struggling to save enough
to rent an apartment in town.
   Ms. Vasquez spent the first few weeks of summer at the shelter,
home to about 150 people, mostly couples and single mothers with
children.
   She found it hard to concentrate and took a room in her former
high school counselor's home. She finds time to visit her family
almost daily.
   ``I lived in an unsettled situation for years,'' Ms. Vasquez
said. ``And I just found I couldn't return to an unstable
condition.''
   That lack of balance began when Ms. Vasquez was 2 years old and
her mother and father separated. The mother, Maria Leyva, left
Chihuahua, Mexico, bringing her two eldest daughters, Lupe and
Virginia, with her to Mirage, Ariz.
   Mrs. Leyva, 39, said Lupe has loved school ever since she
entered kindergarten at age 4. Mrs. Leyva's schooling ended with
fifth grade.
   ``Even when Lupe was sick she forced herself to go to her
classes,'' Mrs. Leyva said in Spanish. ``She was born to study.''
   Soon, little Lupe was carrying armfuls of library books home to
the succession of crowded apartments and boarding house rooms her
family shared.
   Mrs. Leyva met her second husband in the onion fields. The
couple had three children together.
   For years, the family of seven moved with the crops throughout
Arizona. They eventually landed about 60 miles northwest of Los
Angeles in Oxnard, where Ms. Vasquez spent her last two years of
high school.
   This summer, Ms. Vasquez works at a bank in the afternoons. In
the mornings, she works for the California Rural Legal Assistance
doing research on the effects of pesticides on farm workers.
   ``She's bright and talkative and has a good, incisive mind,''
said CRLA staff attorney Marco Antonio Abarca. ``It's funny. I went
to Yale and then Stanford Law School and Lupe is one of the
smartest people I know.''
   Ms. Vasquez said that even though her freshman year was
difficult, it also was intellectually invigorating and filled with
new experiences.
   She took karate classes. She went to parties. She visited San
Francisco. She heard her first symphony.
   ``Getting my independence was the best part,'' she said, echoing
the sentiments of many 18-year-olds who've left home for the first
time. ``Now I can come and go as I please.''

   Diplomats are suffering from heat, thirst
and isolation at embassies that kept their doors open in Kuwait
City and defied Iraqi orders to close.
   The skeleton staff at the U.S. Embassy was boiling swimming pool
water to drink and sleeping outdoors at night to keep cool, despite
swarms of mosquitoes, according to American civil rights leader
Jesse Jackson and others who returned from Kuwait Sunday.
   Iraqi troops kept up a menacing presence outside embassy gates,
trapping those inside 30 embassies, including the U.S., British,
Japanese, Canadian and Egyptian missions.
   Soldiers took up positions and started cutting water, power and
phone lines Aug. 24, the deadline set by Iraq for embassies to shut
down and clear out their personnel.
   Governments reduced staff but ordered diplomats to stay on the
premise that closing their embassies would imply recognition of
Iraq's claim to Kuwait.
   The tense, 10-day standoff has become an endurance test for
stoic diplomatic staffs holed up in offices lacking air
conditioning.
   Afternoon temperatures soar to 120 degrees or higher. Some
diplomats are alone in their embassies.
   ``Water is the principal problem,'' Italian Ambassador Marco
Colombo said in a telephone interview with a reporter from Rome's
La Repubblica newspaper. ``We have a good supply of it and we are
self-rationing. But the heat is terrible.''
   Asked about morale among diplomats in the embassies, the
52-year-old ambassador replied: ``The spirit is the last to go, and
woe if it weren't so in situations like these.''
   Colombo set up an informal network of Italian ``group leaders''
to track the whereabouts of Italians trapped in Kuwait. At least
one of these, an engineer, was spotted by troops and sent to
Baghdad after he attempted to contact a group of Italians at a
Kuwait hotel.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, in an interview
Sunday on French TV, said he had brought up the embassy standoff
situation during meetings Friday and Saturday with Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz in Amman.
   ``Tariq Aziz promised me to do something, to display some
flexibility.... to avoid diplomats' expulsion,'' the U.N. leader
said. But he added that he ``regarded it as unlikely'' that Iraq
would change its mind.
   A free-lance photojournalist who accompanied Jackson to Kuwait
said Americans inside the palm-fringed embassy compound were
breaking furniture to burn in wood stoves for cooking.
   LLoyd Culbertson, a 76-year-old Texan who arrived in Washington
Sunday with a group of 47 Americans, described worsening conditions
inside the U.S. compound.
   ``The food is spoiling. There is no electricity,'' he said in a
television interview. ``We have no means of communicating with
other people. Our ambassador is not allowed to talk with other
ambassadors or to American citizens. He can't leave the compound.''
   He estimated that 20 to 25 Americans remained inside.
   Diplomats have pulled together to keep an eye on each other and
share communications equipment _ Egypt uses Turkey's radio, Denmark
assists Norway, and several embassies use the working phone at the
Czechoslovak mission.
   East German Ambassador Kurt Merkel and his wife, the last two
people left in their mission, were captured by Iraqi soldiers when
they left the embassy in search of food from their West German
colleagues. The ambassador was sent to Baghdad.
   Word of their capture was sent via radio by Belgium's ambassador.
   A diplomatic source in Brussels, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said ``the food and water situation was apparently
critical'' in the East German mission.
   In Berlin, an East German government spokesman said the
government was negotiating with Iraq for the release of the
56-year-old diplomat.
   West Germany said its embassy was using an emergency power
generator. Water supplies were low, but a government spokesman in
Bonn added that those who could get out of embassy compounds were
finding ``food at the stores, although no fresh food.''
   In Oslo, the Foreign Ministry said short messages from its
diplomats in Kuwait indicated that occupation forces remain on
constant patrol.
   ``Their freedom of movement is very limited,'' said government
spokesman Bjoern Blokhus. ``The help they can offer (Norwegians in
Kuwait) is like null.''

   Asian refugees from Iraq and Kuwait are
dying from exposure in a makeshift camp in the desert no man's land
between Iraq and Jordan, and rioting may break out soon, U.S. aid
workers said Monday.
   The estimated 41,000 stranded Asians are fighting each other
over scant supplies, they said. An Indian woman's face was bashed
in with a water jug by other refugees.
   Several thousand of the increasingly desperate refugees mobbed
an Indian who volunteered to help relief workers when they
suspected him of cheating in distributing tents. He was beaten, but
survived.
   ``Helping here is like building a sand castle three feet into
the surf,'' said Jim Nuttal, coordinator for Save the Children.
``New people keep coming at 100 an hour, and there's no end in
sight.''
   Dick Clay, an American construction manager who spent three days
at the camp after fleeing Kuwait disguised as a Filipino, said,
``People will be killing each other soon if nothing is done.''
   ``There was a death Sunday, and there will be more,'' said
Rebecca Salti, an American settled in Jordan who also works with
Save the Children. ``Things are so bad we don't even know how many
have died. People are in awful shape.''
   In Turkey, which also borders Iraq, Pakistanis described similar
desperate conditions at a refugee camp on the Iraqi side of the
frontier with Turkey. They said at least three Pakistanis,
including a woman giving birth, have died at the camp.
   Pakistan's military attache in Ankara, Staff Col. Arshad Setih,
said conditions at the camps on the Iraqi side were ``deplorable.''
``They wait there for passage for days and weeks with no food or
water, under parching sun,'' the colonel said.
   The Jordanian camp at Shaalan, 24 miles east of the border post
at Ruweishid, is full of refugees awaiting transportation home. The
Asians are stuck there because the Jordanian authorities will not
process them until their governments guarantee rapid repatriation.
   With few tents, people live in the open, under scorching sun all
day and chilling temperatures at night.
   ``It's like a piece of sandpaper from horizon to horizon, with
scorpions and snakes,'' Nuttal said. ``They desperately need tents,
transportation, food, water and medical care.''
   Dust blows constantly, he said. ``And with 41,000 people going
to the bathroom in the open, you can imagine what's in that dust.''
   ``Sanitary conditions are non-existent, and I'm afraid cholera,
typhus and other epidemics could break out any day,'' said Dr.
Bhuran Joshi, a British-Nepalese doctor.
   Refugees backed up after a human tide of Bangladeshis, Indians,
Pakistanis, Filipinos, Thais and others overwhelmed Jordan's
capacity to process them.
   Jordanian officials, stretching meager resources to shelter
nearly 100,000 people stranded in Amman, accused Asian governments
and international agencies of not evacuating them fast enough.
   Asian countries say they cannot afford the transportation to fly
their nationals back home.
   From Bangladesh alone, there are 30,000 refugees now in Jordan,
with tens of thousands more expected. Only 1,000 have been
repatriated since Aug. 7, said Riyad Al-Ghabrah, an official at the
Bangladesh consulate.
   ``We can't find any transporation,'' he said. ``We're trying our
best with the United Nations. There are good indications that the
U.N. will help us.''
   Some 6,900 refugees left Sunday on 34 planes, but authorities
said twice that many crossed at Ruweishid.
   Since Aug. 7, about 101,000 people have been evacuated on 500
flights. Egypt airlifted 65,000 of its nationals from Jordan's Red
Sea port of Aqaba, leaving about 25,000 still camped there.
   ``We're not slowing down processing,'' said a senior immigation
offical at Ruweishid last week, red-eyed and numb from three weeks
of 18-hour workdays.
   ``How can we allow any more into Jordan until there's some
possibility of taking care of them there?'' he asked, requesting
that he not named because of acute sensitivites over the refugee
issue.
   King Hussein's brother, Crown Prince Hassan, toured Ruweishid
and Shaalan on Sunday and was visibly shaken by what he saw. Women
strained to reach him, wailing and flailing their arms in the air.
Some refugees taped signs to their bodies demanding action from
embassies.
   Nuttal said a lone Jordanian Red Crescent doctor and 11 aides
treat an endless line of refugees from 5 a.m. until 2 a.m. the next
morning, day after day.
   ``He's a walking zombie,'' Nuttal said of the doctor.
   Nuttal, from Detroit, spoke as he ate his first meal in days
after returning to Amman. Dehydrated from illness, he did not want
to consume any food or medicine desperately needed by refugees.

   Public and private schools went on a
four-day week Monday to save energy in the wake of the Persian Gulf
crisis and resulting loss of oil supplies.
   The Cabinet ordered all elementary and high schools to close
Fridays until Oct. 31 in an energy-saving measure. Officials said
the four-day schoolweek could be extended depending on the
situation next month.
   The Philippines relied heavily on oil from Kuwait and Iraq
before the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. After the invasion, the
United Nations called for embargoes of Iraqi and Kuwaiti goods,
including oil, resulting in a drop of oil supplies.

<DATELINE>KHAFJI, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavily armed Bedouins sit under a
tent guarding a building identified by a new sign outside as
housing offices of the Kuwaiti government-in-exile's Ministry of
Oil.
   This is the forward command post for the Kuwaiti resistance
movement. Its day-to-day operations include smuggling ammunition
and communications equipment into Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, Kuwaiti
exiles say.
   The Saudi-Kuwait border is just three miles to the north.
   ``All the operations to Kuwait come via Khafji,'' said a senior
Kuwaiti guerrilla leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity out
of fear of Iraqi reprisals.
   ``All communications, all orders, all border crossings ... You
saw the trucks, the aerials,'' he said.
   He said the resistance movement has already recruited thousands
of volunteers from among the estimated 70,000 Kuwaiti refugees in
Saudi Arabia.
   A senior Saudi official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Sunday that the Kuwaiti resistance is ``growing in strength''
and stepping up its attacks on the Iraqi occupiers.
   An Associated Press reporter visited the Kuwaiti resistance
headquarters last week. Over the weekend, the Saudi government
barred journalists from traveling to Khafji without an official
escort.
   The resistance and the Kuwaiti army, which has offices nearby,
remain loyal to the government-in-exile headed by Kuwait's emir,
Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah. The government is based in Taif, in
southwest Saudi Arabia.
   The red-green-white-and-black Kuwaiti flag flies outside the
building, which is also the new headquarters of the Kuwait branch
of the Arabian Oil Co., a concern Kuwaiti exiles say is jointly
owned by the Kuwaitis, Saudis and Japanese.
   That is somehow appropriate because Kuwait's oil wealth
guarantees that the resistance movement will not lack for funds.
Saudi officials estimate that the Kuwaiti government-in-exile has
access to assets worth about $100 billion.
   The Kuwaiti guerrilla leader said money is not a problem. ``What
we need is weapons,'' he said.
   Some arms have been obtained from Iraqi defectors, he said.
Others came from the arsenal of Kuwait's National Guard, which
Kuwaitis broke into a day after the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion.
   The guerrilla leader refused to provide details about U.S.
assistance to the Kuwaiti resistance, except to say that Americans
were involved in recruiting Kuwaiti refugees for training in Saudi
Arabia.
   Last week, several U.S. television networks reported that the
CIA and Army Special Forces troops were helping the Kuwaiti
resistance organize hit-and-run attacks on Iraqi occupiers.
   No Americans were involved in the fighting, but Kuwaiti fighters
based near the Saudi-Kuwait border were reported to be getting
intelligence, weapons, radios, advice on target selection and
instruction from U.S. advisers, the networks said.
   President Bush would not confirm directly that his
administration is supporting the Kuwaiti resistance. But, he said,
``In a broad way, I support the Kuwaiti underground. I support
anybody who can have a hand in restoring legitimacy there to Kuwait
and to getting the Iraqis out of Kuwait.''
   The Kuwaiti guerrilla organizer said the resistance is still in
its formative stages. It is headed by three Kuwaiti sheiks _ two
based in Khafji and one in Hafr Al-Batin to the west near King
Khalid Military City, a major Saudi military base, he said.
   In addition to coordinating attacks on Iraqi troops inside
Kuwait, the resistance runs a radio and television station.,
   Guerrillas have also managed to smuggle ammunition into Kuwait,
the guerrilla organizer said.
   He said _ and Saudi officials confirmed _ that Kuwaiti women are
playing an active role in the resistance. In one instance, he said,
a Kuwaiti woman threw a grenade at a group of Iraqi soldiers,
killing several before she was slain.
   The resistance is supported by a network of committees set up by
Kuwaiti exiles in Saudi Arabia.
   Anwar Al-Duaij, the head of a group assisting Kuwaiti refugees
in Khobar, 180 miles south of the border, said the military branch
of his organization was registering volunteers wishing to return to
Kuwait to fight the Iraqis. They are then sent north to infiltrate
into Kuwait.
   He said most of the volunteers did not require training since
most Kuwaiti men had served in the National Guard and were familiar
with weapons.
   ``Every day we hear of 70 Iraqi soldiers being killed by the
resistance. This is correct, this is not an exaggeration,''
Al-Duaij said.
   His figures could not be independently verified.

   Hilary Donofrio arrived at Wesleyan
University for freshman orientation last week, excited at beginning
college life.
   But she admits the turmoil that kept the exclusive liberal arts
college in the news much of last year gave her parents second
thoughts about her choice of schools.
   Two campus firebombings, the slaying of a student activist,
rising racial tensions and publicity about drug use gave parents
plenty to think about.
   ``I wasn't really disturbed by it, but there was a point where
my father said, `Maybe you shouldn't go there,''' Donofrio, 18, of
Southport. She spoke last week as she waited in line to register
for classes, which begin Wednesday.
   School officials acknowledge that events of the past year
contributed to a decline in enrollment. Thirty-six percent of those
accepted by the school have enrolled, down from 38 percent last
year, or 663 freshmen, down from 684. Among Connecticut residents,
who were closer to the publicity, enrollment in this year's
freshman class is down from 71 to 47.
   ``We took a hit, but I think it's momentary,'' said Wesleyan
President William M. Chace. ``I'm just not of the belief that we're
some deeply wounded, crippled institution that is worse off than
other universities.''
   Wesleyan, where annual costs for each of the 2,700 students will
top $20,000 this year, has a reputation for academic excellence
pursued in a less formal, more pastoral setting than its neighbor
to the south, Yale University.
   But school last year began inauspiciously with news stories
about an unofficial annual rite of passage at Wesleyan, a
marijuana-smoking bash. Some students asserted that the
administration looked the other way when it came to drug use,
something school officials vehemently denied.
   The campus was outwardly quiet until April, when the firebombing
of Chace's office fomented simmering racial tension. A second
firebombing, at the Wesleyan boathouse, followed a few weeks later.
   Several students, including Nicholas B. Haddad, a 21-year-old
sophomore from Lebanon, charged that the administration and local
police unfairly singled out black students in their investigation
of the firebombings.
   Tensions increased when racial slurs were found spray painted in
the basement of the Malcolm X House, a residence housing 26 black
students. Some students staged demonstrations, including a nine-day
hunger strike, to protest the university's minority policies.
   Just when the summer break promised a respite, Haddad was found
shot to death in a Hartford park, a cache of weapons in his car.
Police concluded he was slain by two men with whom he was setting
up a drug distribution ring.
   Among those charged in Haddad's death was Kumar Viswanathan, the
21-year-old son of Tanjore Viswanathan, an adjunct professor at
Wesleyan and a prominent musicians.
   Then Viswanathan's cousin, Sudhama Ranganathan, 18, was charged
in the firebombing of Chace's office. His late father also was a
faculty member at Wesleyan.
   Chace said last week that the school is addressing student
concerns over minority issues. It has hired boosted minority hiring
and received a $100,000 Ford Foundation grant to develop new
courses in multiculturalism. Freshmen attended discussions on race
relations during orientation week.
   But some students say the school may have a hard time returning
to its former calm.
   ``I thought when we returned in the fall, things would have
mellowed out, but with the murder of Nick Haddad, there will still
be some tension here,'' said Christina Daly, a sophomore from
Middletown, N.Y.
   Other students said they are optimistic that last year's turmoil
won't spill over into the new school year.
   ``Last year a lot of consciousness was raised and people are
talking more than they used to,'' said Liz Martin, a senior from
Barre, Vt.
   Donofrio's mother, Margaret, said she and her husband no longer
have reservations about their daughter's attending Wesleyan.
   ``I'm really not worried because most of the things that
happened seemed limited to a few people,'' she said. ``The students
seem to be able to roll with it and handle it.''

<HEAD>Burial in Chile's Capital For Allende, 17 Years After His Death</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto SCL1</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The remains of former Marxist
President Salvador Allende are to be unearthed Tuesday from his
modest tomb in a resort city for re-burial in Santiago, 17 years
after his death in a bloody military coup.
   The government of President Patricio Aylwin, a political foe of
Allende, has supported the plan to move Allende's remains to the
capital. But right-wing politicians are bitterly criticizing it,
reviving the controversy over Allende's three-year government.
   Tuesday, the day of the burial and ceremony, marks the 20th
anniversary of the day Allende became the first Marxist freely
elected president in a Western country.
   Three years later, Allende was toppled by Gen. Augusto Pinochet,
whom he had named army commander. Allende died during in an attack
on his presidential palace on Sept. 11, 1973, during the coup led
by Pinochet.
   Allende, who according the military committed suicide rather
than surrender, was buried the day after the coup in a modest
family tomb in Vina del Mar, 75 miles northwest of Santiago.
   Hundreds of people visited the tomb Saturday and Sunday, placing
a thick carpet of red carnations on it as police with automatic
weapons stood guard.
   During Pinochet's 16{-year rule, the tomb remained unmarked.
When supporters of the former president placed a plaque indicating
he was buried there, it was quickly removed by authorities.
   After the Santiago ceremonies, Allende's remains will be buried
at a mausoleum in the capital's main cemetery, where other former
presidents and Chilean dignitaries are buried.

   New Kids on the Block member Donnie Wahlberg got
into a scuffle with a fellow passenger over an airline seat during
a weekend flight from Salt Lake City to Atlanta, authorities said
Monday.
   A police report said Wahlberg, 20, fought with the man in the
coach section of Delta Air Lines Flight 1140 after it left Salt
Lake City on Sunday.
   Wahlberg, who had been sitting in the first-class section of the
plane, went to visit with members of his entourage sitting in the
coach section. He departed briefly, then returned to resume his
conversation and found the seat he had used was taken by the
passenger, the police report said.
   The two began fighting. The report alleged Wahlberg poked the
passenger in the eye and passenger allegedly responded by kicking
Wahlberg in the stomach.
   The passenger was treated for minor injuries at South Fulton
Medical Center and released. He declined to file charges against
Wahlberg, the police report said.
   There was no comment Monday from Wahlberg; calls to his agent
were not answered.
   It was the second Atlanta incident involving the rock group in
less than a month. On Aug. 9, Steven Chandler of Boston, a
bodyguard for New Kids singer Jordan Knight, was arrested on two
counts of battery after an altercation at an nightclub.

   For ABC Sports announcer Al Michaels, the
arrival of Brent Musburger from CBS this spring was nothing to
worry about, although there was speculation that Musberger might
unseat Michaels as ABC's top announcer.
   ``Hey, that was the last thing I had to worry about, really,''
Michaels said in this week's TV Guide. ``My contract specifies what
events I do. It's locked in.
   ``Brent is a great addition for ABC, and there's lots for him to
do _ college football, spring football, golf, bowling, a lot of
stuff.''
   Michaels is perhaps best known as host of ``Monday Night
Football'' and for his announcing during the 1980 Olympics when the
U.S. hockey team upset the Soviet Union and during the earthquake
that interrupted the 1989 World Series.
   ``It's such an irony that a guy who so loves baseball is best
known for a hockey game and an earthquake,'' he said.

   Mikhail Gorbachev has been a lead player on the
stage of history for years, so maybe it's appropriate that that he
will soon be portrayed on a real stage.
   ``Moscow Gold,'' opening in London later this month, will bring
to theater audiences an array of communist giants, from Lenin to
the present-day Soviet president, to be played by David Calder.
   The play was written by London playwrights Howard Brenton and
Tariq Ali, who were responsible for last year's ``Iranian Nights,''
about the plight of author Salman Rushdie under Moslem death threat.
   Calder says the play treats Gorbachev as someone on whom ``the
fickle finger of historical fate suddenly lands, rather than a man
of ambition desperate to get into the old Lenin seat.''
   ``Moscow Gold'' opens Sept. 26 at the Royal Shakespeare
Company's Barbican Theater. It runs through Nov. 3.

   Country music singer Tammy Wynette just
happened to spend the night in a motel where police had a standoff
with an armed man who barricaded himself in his room for more than
five hours.
   Customers in rooms near the man were evacuated and there were no
injuries, Police Chief James Bozicevich said. The man, who was
alone in the room, surrendered after authorities broke a window
early Monday and tossed in two tear gas canisters, Bozicevich said.
   Neither Miss Wynette nor any member of her crew was associated
with the man or incident, Bozicevich said. The chief said Miss
Wynette was staying in a part of the hotel which was not evacuated.
She was in the Iron Range area of northern Minnesota to perform at
Ironworld USA in nearby Chisholm.
   The chief said someone reported late Sunday that the man, a
customer at the motel, had pointed a gun at someone. No shots were
fired, the chief said.
   The man, from Mayfield, Ky., had more than one gun in his
possession when he surrendered, he said.

<HEAD>Japan, Soviets to Set Aside Border Dispute for Better Ties</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan and the Soviet Union hold top-level talks
this week amid growing willingness on both sides to improve
relations even if a stubborn 45-year-old land dispute remains
unresolved.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrives Tuesday for
talks with his Japanese counterpart and Japanese Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu.
   Moscow's ties with Japan have not kept pace with its improving
relations with Western countries. This is because of continuing
bitterness over a group of small islands off northern Japan seized
by Soviet troops in the final days of World War II.
   For years, Japan has demanded that the islands be returned. The
two countries never formally signed a treaty ending World War II
hostilities as a result of the dispute.
   But both sides now say they are willing to discuss a broad range
of cooperation while continuing their negotiations on the
territorial question.
   ``There's definitely been a shift,'' said George Komarovsky,
counselor at the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo.
   ``We have begun to find a common language,'' he said. ``In the
recent past when the two sides met, they talked only about the
territorial problem and there was only confrontation. Now there is
a very constructive dialogue on international relations, and on
many issues our positions are identical.''
   That view was echoed by a Japanese Foreign Ministry official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``We consider (a solution of the border issue) as being the most
important goal, but at the same time we have made it clear that we
are not saying that Japan-Soviet relations consist only of this
single issue,'' the official said. ``We are prepared to find other
common areas where we can make progress.''
   In another sign of change, Kaifu directed Japan's Defense Agency
to delete references to a ``Soviet threat'' in its annual policy
paper due out this month, Kyodo News Service reported Monday.
   Shevardnadze's talks with Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama and
Kaifu are expected to focus on preparations for a visit by Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev next year, the first by a Soviet leader.
   Japan has proposed 10 areas in which agreements could be reached
during the visit, including economic, technical and cultural
cooperation and assistance to victims of the Chernobyl nuclear
power plant accident, the Foreign Ministry official said.
   Japan has indicated its willingness to provide technical support
for Gorbachev's reforms in areas such as management training, said
the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
   Shevardnadze is expected to ask that Soviet banks be allowed to
open branches in Japan and to seek Japanese joint ventures in the
Soviet Union.
   He also is likely to ask for Japanese participation in a new
collective Asian security organization. Details are expected to be
outlined in a speech the Soviet official is to give in the eastern
Soviet port city of Vladivostok before his arrival, ministry
officials said.
   Some analysts predict the Soviet Union will urge Japan to join
the security arrangement in exchange for a withdrawal of Soviet
troops from the contested islands.
   The two sides also are likely to discuss the Middle East crisis,
Cambodia and tensions on the Korean peninsula, Japanese and Soviet
officials said.
   In meetings in China last week, Shevardnadze and Chinese Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen urged that force be avoided in the gulf.
Shevardnadze is likely to make the same point with Japanese
officials.

   Presidents George Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev
plan an informal meeting in Helsinki focusing on the Persian Gulf
and other issues without the ``theatrics'' of previous summits, a
Soviet spokesman said Monday.
   The summit, proposed by Bush, will build on the personal rapport
the presidents established at previous meetings, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady Gerasimov told a news briefing
   ``Such personal meetings, both presidents believe, offer a
unique possibility to compare notes on the fast-changing situation,
grasp each other's reasoning better, and consequently, help enhance
constructive trends and neutralize negative developments in the
world today,'' Gerasimov said.
   ``The first summits _ they were to establish personal relations
and to discuss things in general terms. But now they have concrete
business, what to do in the Persian Gulf, what to do with our arms
talks in Vienna and Geneva, what to do with Germany.''
   Gorbachev and Bush will meet in the Finnish capital for one day
with only their foreign ministers and chiefs of staff, Gerasimov
said. He said the presidents discussed the possibility of holding
such meetings on short notice with no formal agenda during their
talks at Camp David in June.
   ``The concept of promptly arranged, trustful contacts at summit
level fits in perfectly with the new fiber of Soviet-American
dialogue, based on the renunciation of Cold War stereotypes,'' he
said.
   The Soviet spokesman said relations between Moscow and
Washington are moving away from ``theatrics ... to really a working
level when the leaders meet not to exchange compliments, not to
organize a mutual admiration society ... but to talk business, and
now they have business, a lot of business.''
   Gerasimov said he doubted Gorbachev would try to contact Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein before the summit. He said Moscow has not
been asked to play a mediating role in the crisis that began with
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The last of the 941 Soviet women and children stranded in Iraq
returned to Moscow on Monday, but Gerasimov said he did not know
when about 7,000 Soviet men remaining in Iraq could be evacuated.
   He acknowledged the continued presence of 193 Soviet military
advisers in Iraq was embarrassing but said removing them was ``a
very delicate situation for us.''
   The military experts have been training Iraqi soldiers how to
use Soviet-built weapons, and repairing and maintaining those
weapons. Soviet officials insist they were not advising Baghdad
about the invasion of Kuwait.
   ``It's an unhappy situation that we have so many Soviet experts
there, but we started this in 1972 when we signed a treaty of
friendship and cooperation with Iraq, and they asked us to send
advisers to many places,'' Gerasimov said.

<HEAD>Bush's Pass-The-Plate Strategy Questioned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is dispatching two high-level
missions this week on a global search for billions of dollars to
support the economic and military campaign against Saddam Hussein _
a strategy some say is unbecoming of a superpower.
   One delegation, led by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, leaves
Tuesday for stops in Paris, London, Seoul, South Korea and Tokyo,
passing the plate in search of as much as $25 billion to help
defray the expense of the American troop deployment and to aid
nations suffering hardships from the economic embargo against Iraq.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III leaves later in the week
on a similar whirlwind trip looking for assistance in the capitals
of oil-rich Persian Gulf countries.
   Bush announced the burden sharing effort just last Thursday and
on Monday officials were still scrambling to put together
itineraries for the hastily scheduled trips.
   The fact that Bush was sending two of his closest Cabinet
advisers served to emphasize the importance the president was
attaching to the task of getting other countries to share the
burden. However, administration officials conceded that the sales
job was not going to be easy.
   Bush's effort has also raised questions about the propriety of
issuing a global call for donations to support the U.S. military.
Critics charged that it left the appearance that America's soldiers
are up for hire as mercenaries.
   ``I don't want to leave any impression in the world that we pay
for our soldiers and our sailors if we send them into another part
of the world only through another country's money,'' said Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. ``This is not a rent military. It's not a
mercenary force.''
   Leahy said a better approach to take would be to boost taxes if
necessary to pay for the Persian Gulf buildup.
   Bush has vigously rejected suggestions that putting pressure on
the allies for money to support the U.S. military was improper and
he has received support for this position from other members of
Congress.
   ``The Japanese have a hell of a stake in this and they ought to
pay a hell of a share,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.
   Many congressmen noted that Japan and many countries in Europe
are more dependent on the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf than
the United States is.
   Still, many private analysts saw the pledge-seeking missions as
stark examples of where America's global fortunes now stand.
   As the world's largest debtor nation, burdened by huge trade and
budget deficits, the United States no longer has the economic
muscle to go it alone.
   ``We are no longer the economic super power we used to be,''
said Lawrence Chimerine of the Economic Strategy Institute, a
Washington research organization. ``Our changing role in the world
economy is clearly in evidence here.''
   In launching the burden sharing initiative last week, Bush
maintained that the ``shape of the post-Cold War world'' was at
stake in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   C. Fred Bergsten, a former Treasury Department official in the
Carter administration, said that Bush's hasty effort could well
serve as a prototype for future global cooperation in which the
U.S. military would stand ready to preserve peace with financial
backing from other countires.
   Bergsten said that a more formal agreement, perhaps under the
auspices of the United Nations, may evolve from the current
conflict with the expected contribution from each country spelled
out more clearly in advance of any conflict.
   That would relieve one of the problems in the current crisis in
which many U.S. allies have been slow to make economic commitments.
   While it is recognized that Germany is facing huge costs in the
reunification effort in its country, critics contend that the $1
billion pledged so far by Japan stops far short of what that
country should be doing.
   However, a more formal arrangement that committed the United
States to putting U.S. soliders in harm's way to police the world's
hot spots would raise political opposition, Bergsten concedes.
   ``Some Americans are not going to like that because it sounds
like we are mercenaries,'' Bergsten said. ``But the fact is that
the world is an insecure place and we have the military capability
to make a difference.''

   With corn borers in the corn bread and
crickets in the chocolate, there must be fly in the ointment at
Iowa State University.
   But not so, say the entomologists. Their Insect Horror Film
Festival at the Ames campus this week is designed to give bugs a
better name, not to mention a better flavor.
   Not only can you see how bugs are portrayed in bad movies, but
there will be ``treats'' for those with enough intestinal fortitude
to try chocolate covered grasshoppers or roasted larvae.
   Those who prefer their bugs on the hoof will delight in a
petting zoo featuring cockroaches, drone bees, tarantulas, giant
walking sticks, water beetles and dragonfly nymphs. For some 300
guests, there will be praying mantises to take home.
   ``When we think of bugs, we tend to dwell on those insects that
we don't like or make us uncomfortable,'' said John Obrycki, an
entomology professor.
   ``Insects get a lot of negative press.''
   That's especially true in Iowa, where farmers are on a mission
to stamp out bugs.
   ``Yes, there are pests,'' said Obrycki. ``But when you go out
and try to kill all the bugs in a field, you'll kill far more good
ones than bad.''
   But that wisdom hasn't sunk in for adults, he said. Hence, the
horror show, which runs Thursday through Saturday.
   ``In kids' films, bugs are mostly friendly, Jiminy Cricket type
stuff and `Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,' '' he said. ``I've taken
2-inch-long cockroaches into first grades and the kids love it.
They all want to hold it.
   ``But you take the same insect into the undergraduate class I
teach here, most people would just as soon not handle it,'' he
said. ``I don't know where the dividing point is, but somewhere
along the line we learn not to like insects.''
   Especially not for meals. But there's nothing harmful about corn
borers, roasted and ground up as a flour substitute, he said.
   ``And we'll have garlic fried larvae that you find on clover
leaves,'' said entomology undergraduate student Cynthia Lidtke.
What kind? ``Large green and yellow ones,'' she said. ``I gave some
to my daughter and she thought they were good.''
   The festival kicks off Thursday with ``An Itch in Time,'' a
cartoon featuring a singing flea. Two bug cartoons will be shown
before each feature _ things like ``The Fly,'' ``Bug'' and ``Them.''

   Former President Ronald Reagan has joined
President Bush and others in likening Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.
   Reagan barely mentioned the Middle East crisis in a weekend
speech, but did say Arab nations' banding together against Saddam
Hussein is ``reason for very great optimism.''
   He called the Iraqi leader the ``reincarnation of Hitler.''
   President Bush ``is doing very well in what is needed,'' he said
in a speech at a copy service company's convention.
   Despite the Mideast crisis, Reagan, 79, said he is ``more
optimistic than I've ever been'' about the prospect for freedom and
peace in the world.
   Reagan spoke Sunday to more than 2,000 people at the Kwik-Kopy
International Conference.
   He also talked about the importance of the free flow of
information in a free society, even though he had requested that
the press in general be prohibited from attending his speech, said
Jan Norris, a spokesman for Kwik-Kopy.
   Reagan, whose speaking fee was not disclosed, said Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev understands that his government ``must
allow the flow of information'' to prosper.

   The strike was called by independent trade unions set up
recently by Kosovo's 1.9 million ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of its population.
   Serbia's Communist government took administrative control of
Kosovo last spring, saying it had to abolish the province's
autonomy to protect the Serb minority from alleged harassment by
the majority ethnic Albanians.
   In July, the Kosovo parliament proclaimed the province's
independence from Serbia, which reacted by dismissing the lawmakers.
   Streets in this provincial capital were virtually deserted
Monday. Almost all shops were closed. Pristina's usually lively
bazaar was deserted, with empty stalls, the previous day's trash
strewn about and a big metal gate chained shut.
   There were no reports of violence. Last week, Serbian
authorities said 21 police and scores of demonstrators were injured
in clashes with thousands of ethnic Albanians waiting for a U.S.
Congressional delegation investigating charges of human rights
abuses.
   The delegation, headed by Sen. Robert Dole, a Kansas Republican,
criticized what it called ``a systematic pattern of violating the
rights of Albanians.''
   ``Trade union leaders asked us not to go out to avoid conflicts
with the police,'' Lepaja told journalists in his home near the
center of the city.
   ``We all expect we could lose our jobs,'' he said, adding that
his wife, who works for a state firm, had already emptied her desk
``because she is convinced she will be fired tomorrow.''
   ``But Albanians are ready for sacrifices _ the community has
never been so united before,'' Lepaja declared.
   Officials of Serbia's provisional government in Kosovo said any
ethnic Albanians absent from work in state companies on Monday
faced dismissal. They threatened to replace them with workers
brought in from Serbia.
   ``Ethnic Albanian managers and experts responsible for vital
services will be replaced and suspended'' for taking part in the
walkout, the Tanjug news agency quoted Momcilo Trajkovic, Serbia's
vice premier in charge of the economy, as saying.
   Disciplinary and other ``legal measures'' will be taken against
all strikers, and ``energetic actions'' will be implemented against
the owners of private shops and groceries that fail to open,
Trajkovic said.
   Kosovo was the core of Serbia's medieval kingdom and has strong
sentimental value for most Serbs.
   Serbian leaders contend that if it were given sovereignty, it
would secede and merge with neighboring Albania.
   More than 60 ethnic Albanians have died in the province in the
past 18 months during protests against Serbian dominance.
   The bloody riots, a wave of arrests of ethnic Albanians and
other Serbian policies have drawn strong protests from
international human rights monitoring groups.

   An ex-KGB general who alleged the secret police
agency continues to spy on Soviet citizens scored a decisive
victory in a runoff election for a seat in the Soviet parliament,
officials said Monday.
   Oleg Kalugin won 57.9 percent of the vote in Sunday's voting for
the seat in the southern Russian province of Krasnodar, about 750
miles south of Moscow, said Vladislav Busheyev, chairman of the
regional Election Commission.
   Kalugin defeated Nikolai Gorovoi, an agricultural official who
won 39.2 percent of the vote, Busheyev said in a telephone
interview.
   ``My election victory is a manifestation that the revolutionary
process is shifting from the center to the provinces,'' Kalugin
told the independent Interfax news agency.
   The win ensures that Kalugin will have broad immunity to
continue criticizing his former employers without fear of
prosecution.
   Kalugin's campaign focused on his allegations that the KGB
continues to tap telephones, infiltrate trade unions and the
Russian Orthodox Church and play dirty tricks abroad, despite a
campaign to shed its image as an instrument of purges and
repression.
   Kalugin, 55, was dismissed and stripped of his rank after going
public with his accusations in June. The Soviet prosecutor has been
investigating him since July 17 under a law against divulging state
secrets, but no formal charges have been filed.
   As an elected lawmaker, Kalugin cannot be prosecuted on criminal
charges without the agreement of the Soviet legislature.
   The former major general was a KGB agent in the United States
from 1958 to 1970, first under the cover of being a Radio Moscow
correspondent and later as a first secretary in the Soviet Embassy
in Washington.
   The KGB and its supporters tried to discredit Kalugin before an
initial vote was held last month in Krasnodar, an agricultural
region along the Black Sea. Kalugin outpolled 20 other candidates
but did not win the required majority.
   Kalugin told the independent news agency Interfax on Monday that
KGB agents were ``very active'' in Krasnodar and followed his
campaign workers.
   On Saturday, the KGB accused him of slander for saying that two
people who had once worked as assistants to KGB Chairman Vladimir
Kryuchkov and his deputy chairman, Viktor Grushko, later defected.
Kalugin made the allegations Friday night on the popular television
program Vzglyad, or Viewpoint.
   The KGB called it ``another slanderous allegation by Oleg
Kalugin.'' In a statement released by Tass, the KGB also said ``it
is impossible to bypass the fact that many statements by Kalugin
betray striking affinity to numerous statements'' by one of the
defectors.
   The KGB said neither Kryuchkov nor Grushko ever had assistants
who betrayed their country.
   Krasnodar's seat in the national Congress of People's Deputies,
which meets twice a year, was vacated by Ivan Polozkov, who left to
become the Communist Party chief of the Russian republic.

<HEAD>Bread In Short Supply in Moscow for First Time Since Khrushchev</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet citizens are used to waiting in line for
bananas, paying under the table for meat and using ration coupons
for sugar. But bread, that staple of the Russian diet, was always
fresh and plentiful.
   Now that has changed. On Monday, Soviets lined up for bread at
stores across Moscow for the first time in years.
   Many were grumbling, blaming President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reforms for shortages of a growing list of products that includes
tobacco, paper, cheese and gasoline.
   Russian bread, which is chewy but wholesome and cheap because of
government subsidies, had been one of the few products Soviet
consumers could count on. The last time people remember long bread
lines was under Premier Nikita Khrushchev, who was ousted from
power in 1964.
   ``That's perestroika _ we're not moving forward, we're going
backward,'' said Viktor Lyubeznov, a 52-year-old electrician who
went to four Moscow bread stores before finding a loaf.
   ``Now we think freely, we speak freely, but the economic
situation is more severe than ever,'' said Irina Samoruppa, 65.
   The shortage could undermine support for the political and
economic reforms _ known as perestroika _ initiated by Gorbachev.
   Inside Moscow's Bread Store No. 150 on Monday, tempers flared as
customers accused saleswomen of saving the last few loaves of white
bread for themselves.
   ``Look, comrades, they have more left back there, they just
won't sell it,'' one woman cried.
   ``You don't know what you're talking about, so just be quiet,''
answered a husky saleswoman in a white apron.
   Outside, people stood in clusters, commiserating and arguing.
   ``Never in my life have I ever had to search for bread before,''
said Anatoly Znamensky, a 66-year-old retired taxi driver.
``Vegetables, fruit, cheese, butter, meat _ they appear and
disappear. But with bread there was never a problem, until now.''
   ``Everything will be fine,'' said Mrs. Samoruppa. ``It isn't
possible for this to continue very long.''
   ``Anything's possible. You can't rule anything out anymore,''
said Valery Myutek.
   The bread shortage, which began late last week and worsened over
the weekend, appeared to be limited primarily to Moscow, although
bread rationing has been introduced in Tarusa, a small city to the
south.
   The newspapers Moskovskaya Pravda and Izvestia said the
capital's bakeries were unable to keep up with the sudden rise in
demand when residents returned from their traditional August
vacations.
   The problem is not a lack of grain. A record harvest is expected
this year.
   Izvestia said the bottleneck is Moscow's central bread bakeries,
which have undergone little expansion or modernization since the
1950s, when the population was about half the current 8.8 million.
   The shortage could be especially hard on the city's retirees.
Some receive pensions of only $48 to $96 a month and survive
largely on bread, which costs just 11 to 18 cents a pound,
depending on the variety.
   The lack of bread comes on the heels of a summer-long shortage
of tobacco, which led to street demonstrations in Moscow, strikes
in other Russian cities and a riot in Siberia.
   In addition, gasoline has become hard to find. Hard cheese has
virtually disappeared from stores in Moscow in recent weeks. As
school reopened, shelves were bare of the notebooks children are
required to use in class.
   Of all the shortages, however, bread is potentially the most
politically troubling, if only because of its historical symbolism.
When Lenin returned from exile to lead the revolution in 1917, his
slogan promised Communism would bring ``Peace, Land and Bread.''

   Foreign ministers from five Arab League nations
ended a two-day summit on Monday by adopting a working document
aimed at ending the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   The document, whose contents were kept secret, was to be relayed
to the leaders of Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia
for further consideration.
   The ministers' closed-door discussions were not made public, but
were believed to have included seeking an ``Arab solution'' to
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and Libya's longstanding border
dispute with Chad.
   A source close to the discussions said Monday there was a
``broad convergence of views'' on the implications of Iraq's
invasion, as well as on measures to solve the situation.
   The five North African countries took opposing sides at the Arab
League vote last month in Cairo on whether to support sending
troops to the Gulf region as part of a multinational peacekeeping
force.
   Morocco voted in favor of sending troops, Libya against and
Algeria and Mauritania abstained. Tunisia boycotted the meeting.
Morocco has committed about 1,200 troops to the peacekeeping
operation.

   President Yoweri Museveni freed a former
army major who was held for four years but was never tried,
officials said Monday.
   Fred K. Mpiso, described by human rights groups as a prisoner of
conscience, was released Saturday by presidential pardon, officials
said.
   Mpiso, 31, was arrested in May 1986 and charged with being drunk
and neglecting his duties. He challenged the charge and was freed
but was rearrested on a charge of treason in December.
   High Court Judge James H. Ntabgoba ordered Mpiso's release a
month ago after the military failed to present the prisoner in
court as demanded by his wife. The army, however, ignored
Ntabgoba's order.

   A rusty toaster, a child's plastic sand
bucket and some soggy clothes were just about all that an angry
twister left behind when it came to call on Carol Levenston and her
4-year-old son.
   While hundreds of other Illinois tornado victims last week stood
in line to see their insurance agents, Levenston, whose second
child is due any day, pecked through the pile of rubble she once
called home.
   ``We had just really got started here,'' said Levenston, 30.
``We thought about (insurance) but we just never expected this to
come about.''
   The tornadoes killed 27 people and demolished more than 270
homes and 14 apartment buildings last Tuesday in the small towns of
Plainfield and Crest Hill, some 30 miles southwest of Chicago. An
additional 639 dwellings were damaged.
   By week's end, many residents were meeting with insurance
agents, calling building contractors and beginning to look to the
future.
   ``We're totally covered,'' said Scott Ellerbrock of Plainfield.
   Ellerbrock joked he is ``31 years old going on 80,'' after the
storm left only two walls of his house intact. He said his
insurance agent had already issued him a check and that, for his
family, the worst was over.
   ``Take your best shot _ I can take it,'' the Dow Chemical Co.
worker said. ``I've been through hell and I made it.''
   Ellerbrock plans to rebuild on the same site _ this time a
larger house for his wife and two young children.
   Throughout the area, insurance agents scurried to meet demand
left in the wake of the twisters.Many residents praised the quick
response of their agents.
   ``They came out Wednesday morning _ figured it was a total loss
for me,'' said Richard Vogen as he carried a few chairs from his
three-bedroom home.
   Vogen said his agents issued him a check on the spot.
   Two disaster relief centers were set up by the state and federal
governments to assist some victims with loans and outright grants.
   The newly appointed director of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, Wallace Stickney, toured the disaster area Monday and
visited the two centers. Stickney, who also flew over the
devastation in a helicopter, praised the quick response of federal
and state emergency workers.
   ``We may be able to beat the response by a couple of hours next
time, but I think we've set a record here that's going to be hard
to match in the future,'' Stickney said.
   It is Stickney's first major disaster since taking over FEMA two
weeks ago.
   Ron Buddecke, a regional FEMA official, said Friday that the
agency antifipates serving a lot of people with insufficent
insurance or no insurance.
   Many residents of the modest Crestlakes Apartment complex in
Crest Hill, where at least nine of the fatalities occurred, said
their losses had not been covered.
   Paul Hendrix, 30, pulled ``a pillowcase full'' of clothes from
his apartment Friday. Hendrix said his losses were compounded by
looting on Wednesday and Thursday while he was working at an auto
dealership.
   ``I couldn't even afford to take off,'' said Hendrix.
   Even for the insured, the road was not easy. In Plainfield, an
unidentified man wept as he pleaded over the phone with his
insurance company.
   ``You can't call me,'' the man said. ``I have no phone. My home
has been destroyed. I'm sorry. I'm upset.''

<TEXT>
   Parliament on Monday extended federal
rule over Kashmir, and the government said it will investigate
allegations that security forces battling Moslem secessionists have
raped and molested women.
   The Rajya Sabha, or upper house of Parliament, endorsed direct
federal rule over the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir,
replacing an administrative ordinance issued July 18. The lower
house had approved the move last week.
   The local elected government was first suspended in January and
replaced by a federally appointed governor in a crackdown on the
separatists.
   Subodh Kant, the junior minister for interior affairs, said
three security personnel faced unspecified punishment for
``excesses on women.''
   He also said the authorities will investigate more that 30 other
cases of alleged rape or molestation.
   The Indian police, army and paramilitary forces have been
accused of human rights violations and indiscriminate killing while
hunting Moslem militants.
   Kant said most of the allegations of atrocities by government
forces were fabricated by the militants.
   On Sunday, two air force technicians were abducted and killed in
Srinigar, the state capital. The government clamped a curfew on the
city and authorized its forces to shoot curew violaters on sight.
   Press Trust of India reported three more people died in the
state Sunday night and Monday, including a militant commander and a
security man who died of injuries in an earlier clash. The body of
an unidentified woman also was recovered from a river, PTI said.
   At least 1,089 people have been killed since January.
   The latest round of secessionist violence flared on Jan. 20
following a government crackdown on escalating protests, bombings
and attacks on state officials. The secessionist campaign has been
alternately simmering and flaring for more than 40 years.
   The militants had earlier campaigned for union with Pakistan,
which claims Kashmir because of its predominant Moslem population,
but now demand independence and the status of a neutral country.

   President Mohamed Siad Barre, whose
country is convulsed by rebellions and banditry, on Monday sacked
the 6-month-old government of Prime Minister Mohamed Ali Samantar.
   The president, in power since a 1969 coup, gave no reason for
the move in the state radio announcement. He asked Mohamed Hawadle
Madar, a former Cabinet minister, to form a new government in this
East African nation and said Samantar will stay on as a caretaker
until then.
   Madar, a former vice president of the national assembly, is a
member of the northern Isaak clan that makes up the main element of
support for the rebel Somali National Movement (SNM).
   The sacking comes amidst continued fighting against the SNM in
the north and intensified battles against the rebel United Somali
Congress in central Somalia.
   The country also is suffering from hyperinflation, which
threatens to overcome the economy, widespread banditry and
interclan fighting in the interior.
   Heightening tension in the capital, Mogadishu, has included at
least a half-dozen unexplained bomb blasts at foreign missions the
last two months.
   A Western diplomat, asked about the dissolution of the
government, said the public was dissatisfied with the performance
of the old government _ ``politically, economically and socially.''

<HEAD>Former CIA Agent Tried For Not Reporting Contra Arms Profits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former CIA agent embroiled in the Iran-Contra
affair goes on trial Tuesday in a case expected to shed light on
who made how much in the secret arms supply network to Iran and the
Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   Thomas G. Clines, who retired from the CIA in 1978 after a
29-year career, is accused of under-reporting his earnings from
arms sales on his 1985 and 1986 tax returns. He also is charged
with failing to tell the Internal Revenue Service about overseas
bank accounts.
   Clines, of Middleburg, Va., pleaded innocent March 9 to all four
counts. If convicted of all charges, Clines could be fined up to $1
million and sentenced to 16 years in prison.
   ``As I've said in open court, we thought the case should never
have been brought,'' said Clines' attorney, Paula M. Junghans. ``He
intends to defend it vigorously.''
   She declined to comment further.
   Prosecutors contend Clines reaped about $882,000 in commissions
for helping buy and sell arms to Iran and the Contra rebels
fighting the Marxist Sandinista government in Nicaragua. Some of
the money was kept in a foreign account code-named ``C.Tea,''
according to the congressional Iran-Contra report issued in
November 1987.
   Clines was in the arms business with Richard V. Secord, a
retired Air Force major general, and Albert Hakim, an Iranian-born
businessman, the indictment said.
   The business allegedly operated in 1985 and 1986. It was
directed by former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter and
retired Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, a former National Security
Council aide, court papers said.
   ``North and Poindexter played critical roles in providing the
funds that Clines, Hakim and Secord used to pay for the weapons the
Contras eventually received,'' according to court documents.
   ``Those funds also provided the source of the profits that
Clines and his partners kept, which are at the heart of this case.''
   Prosecutors claim evidence will show that Clines received about
$423,000 in 1985 and $459,000 in 1986.
   Clines reported gross receipts of $265,000 for the tax year 1985
and $402,513 for 1986, the indictment said.
   Hakim, who managed bank accounts in the Iran-contra affair, is a
key witness in the case against Clines.
   Hakim pleaded guilty Nov. 21, 1989, to a misdemeanor of
supplementing North's salary. He was sentenced in February to two
years of supervised probation and was fined $5,000.
   Hakim was a principal shareholder of Lake Resources Inc., a
company that pleaded guilty to stealing government property. That
was done by diverting the proceeds from arms sales to Iran to the
Contras.
   The government also is expected to put Secord on the stand.
   Secord pleaded guilty Nov. 8, 1989 to one felony count of making
false statements to the Iran-Contra congressional committees. He
was sentenced in January to two years of probation.
   Clines worked for the CIA as an agent in Southeast Asia and was
involved in the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba. He became director of
training in the directorate of operations, also known as the
clandestine services.
   In 1984, Clines pleaded guilty on behalf of a company he owned
to overcharging the Defense Department for shipping military
equipment to Egypt. He was fined $10,000.
   In a plea agreement in Richmond, Va., Clines also agreed to pay
$100,000 in exchange for assurances that he wouldn't be sued for up
to $8 million his company allegedly overcharged the government.

   The capture of a jail escapee has provided
leads in the search for a second escapee and the woman guard who
investigators believe is romantically linked to him, authorities
said Monday.
   James V. Barnes, 35, of Romney, was captured Sunday night in a
vacant vacation home, said West Virginia State Police Cpl. E.E.
Bolyard. He escaped early Wednesday from a jail in Cumberland, Md.,
30 miles to the north.
   About 15 law enforcement officers surrounded the house and a
police dog and its handler who entered through a window found
Barnes hiding behind a door, said Maj. Gary Simpson of the Allegany
County Sheriff's Department in Maryland. Barnes was treated for a
bite from the police dog.
   Barnes waived his right to fight extradition and was being held
in the Hampshire County Jail until he could be taken back to
Maryland.
   Barnes and Edgar Eugene Kerns Jr., 30, escaped from their
maximum-security cells at the Allegany County Detention Center in
Cumberland. Another prison guard watched them take guard Sandra Kay
Beeman with them, grabbing her neck in a choke hold.
   At first authorities regarded Beeman as a hostage although they
wondered how the men, armed just with hard objects in white socks,
were able to force Beeman to open two sets of locked doors.
   Then, on Saturday, the 46-year-old guard telephoned her daughter
in Frostburg, Md., to tell her: ``I'm fine. I'm with him.''
   A warrant charging Beeman with aiding in the escape, a felony
that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years, was issued later that
day.
   The capture of Barnes clears up who Beeman is with, Simpson
said. Barnes told authorities Kerns and Beeman were together when
the trio separated earlier in the week.
   Statements by Barnes confirmed police beliefs that Kerns and
Beeman are romantically linked, Simpson said. Barnes also provided
new leads about where the pair may have headed, Simpson said.
   Barnes had been sentenced to 50 years in prison in Virginia for
rape, kidnapping and robbery. He entered the Cumberland jail Feb.
14 to await trial for rape, kidnapping and assault with a deadly
weapon a knife.
   Kerns, of Martinsburg, W.Va., had been in the Cumberland jail
since Jan. 13. He was awaiting sentencing on charges of grand
larceny and writing bad checks. He had been charged with assault
for allegedly beating his wife, but that case wasn't prosecuted
because she declined to testify, authorities said.
   On the night of the escape, co-workers said, Beeman asked an
officer to pick up dinner from a nearby carryout restaurant,
leaving Beeman and another guard on duty. Beeman then went upstairs
for a routine round, carrying keys to all the cells, a breach of
policy.
   The two men, who had been in maximum security cells, and Beeman
walked downstairs and through a series of doors, including one that
was supposed to be locked at all times.
   The men threatened the other officer, who locked herself in a
bathroom, co-workers said.
   The three then left in Beeman's car.
   ``I've known Kay,'' said Allegany Deputy Craig Allen Robertson,
the detective in charge of the case. ``She was a friend of mine.
But now she's crossed a border. ... It makes it very hard.''

   Mongolia's first popularly elected legislature
met in its initial session Monday and re-elected Punsalmaagiin
Ochirbat as president of the Central Asian nation, a source in Ulan
Bator said.
   The session lasted about 10 hours, said the source, who spoke in
a telephone interview from the Mongolian capital on condition of
anonymity.
   ``Everyone really felt free to get up and speak their piece, and
did so,'' he said.
   The source said the leader of the communist party, formally
called the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, nominated
Ochirbat and the opposition Social Democratic Party seconded the
nomination. He said Ochirbat will be sworn in Tuesday.
   His information was based on radio reports shortly after
Monday's session ended.
   Ochirbat, a former mining engineer, was trade minister when
first named president last March during a leadership shuffle forced
by months of pro-democracy protests.
   Jambyn Batmonh, who was president and communist party chief,
resigned both posts.
   Ochirbat initiated a policy in recent years of seeking ties with
countries outside the Soviet bloc, to which Mongolia has belonged
since a 1921 communist revolution. He came to China in May to
normalize relations after many years of coolness caused by the
Chinese-Soviet split.
   The Mongolian Democratic Party initiated Mongolia's
pro-democracy movement and was the first opposition party when it
was founded this year. It did not support Ochirbat's nomination,
but did not nominate its own candidate, the source said. The vote
count was not immediately available.
   Opposition parties hold only 10 percent of the 430 seats in the
legislature, called the Great People's Hural, following Mongolia's
first multiparty elections on July 29. A communist victory was
guaranteed in the elections because the five new opposition parties
lacked time to put up candidates for each seat.
   The source said that despite their small numbers, the presence
of the opposition party members changed the atmosphere of the
entire legislature.
   ``It clearly was a departure from previous hurals _ everybody
feeling free to speak,'' he said.
   Mongolia has 2 million residents.

   Americans marked the last blast of the summer with Labor Day
picnics, parades and a river raft race in Oklahoma. A Chicago
neighborhood sent red, white and blue messages to U.S. soldiers in
the Persian Gulf.
   Michigan Gov. James Blanchard joined 65,000 people early Monday
for the 5-mile walk across Mackinac Bridge, which links the state's
two peninsulas. Blanchard made the trek in one hour and 10 minutes,
then flew to Detroit for more walking in the Labor Day parade and
the Polish Day parade in Hamtramck.
   A morning parade in Oklahoma City sponsored by the Central
Oklahoma Labor Council drew plenty of spectators but only nine
floats. The parade's brevity didn't seem to disappoint the
children, who gleefully scooped up candy thrown from the floats and
cars.
   A holiday perennial, the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon, turned
25 this year, shifting from Las Vegas to a revolving Hollywood
stage. Lewis kicked off the 21{-hour fund-raiser Sunday night for
the Muscular Dystrophy Association with a dedication to the late
Sammy Davis Jr.
   The weekend in Virginia Beach, Va., ended as peacefully as it
began, without the looting and rioting that marred last year's
gathering of college students. City officials blocked off a section
of the oceanfront to traffic and restricted visitors' movements.
   ``I think I'll be in the Bahamas next year,'' said Tracy Jordan,
21, of New York City. ``It's just too much trouble to get down here
and then they kept us from going anywhere.''
   In Tulsa, Okla., about 180 rafts _ some nothing more than two
tire inner tubes strapped together _ were registered for the 18th
raft race. At the boom of a cannon, the crafts left their moorings
at Sand Springs on the Arkansas River for the 8.3-mile trek to
Tulsa's River West Festival Park.
   About 1,000 people marched in the 27th annual Wellington-Oakdale
Old Glory Marching Society on Chicago's north side. After the
four-block parade, about 150 marchers turned in tiny American flags
on which they had penned messages for troops in the Persian Gulf.
   ``Hurry home,'' said one.
   ``We're thinking of you'' and ``God bless you,'' said others.
   Someone wrote the current standings of all four baseball
divisions on the back of one of the 4-by-6-inch flags.
   Galesburg, Ill., extended a tradition with its 98th Annual
Galesburg Labor Day parade, one of the oldest in the nation.
   In New York City, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo exhorted labor leaders
Monday to go on the offensive against higher Social Security taxes.
   Leading that kind of a fight would restore the prestige and
influence of the labor movement, the governor said at a pre-parade
Labor Day breakfast hosted by the New York City Central Labor
Council.

<HEAD>Shiite Leader Rules Out Early Release of American Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An influential Shiite Moslem leader on
Monday ruled out any quick release of the six American hostages in
Lebanon, but indicated seven Europeans could soon be freed.
   ``If there is going to be a hostage release, it will be
Europeans, not Americans,'' Hussein Musawi said in Baalbek, a town
in eastern Lebanon.
   ``The United States has spearheaded the West's occupation of
Saudi Arabia after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and that eliminated
the chance of releasing American hostages in Lebanon this year,''
Musawi told reporters.
   Musawi heads a pro-Syrian wing of Hezbollah, or Party of God,
the reputed umbrella for extremist Shiite Moslem factions in
Lebanon. He is said to be the mentor of pro-Iranian Shiite factions
believed to hold the hostages.
   There are four Britons, two West Germans and an Italian in
addition to the six Americans held in Lebanon.
   He was commenting on reports published in Beirut newspapers
quoting unidentified Lebanese sources close to Iran as saying all
13 Western hostages, including the Americans, would be freed by the
end of the year.
   These reports quoted the sources as saying ``backstage
negotiations and preparations are under way to free Anglican Church
envoy Terry Waite soon.
   ``Barring unforeseen hitches, Waite will be the next hostage to
be freed. Otherwise it will be John McCarthy.''
   Waite, 51, was kidnapped on Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving a West
Beirut hotel for a rendezvous with representatives of Islamic
Jihad, a group that claims to be holding American hostages Terry
Anderson and Thomas Sutherland.
   Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held Western hostage in Lebanon. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Sutherland was dean of agriculture at the American University of
Beirut when he was abducted June 9, 1985.
   No group has claimed to be holding Waite and none of the freed
hostages this year has mentioned seeing him in captivity.
   McCarthy, 33, a British reporter for the London-based Worldwide
Television News, was kidnapped April 17, 1986, as he drove to
Beirut airport to catch a flight to London.
   No group has claimed to be holding him either. But several
Lebanese Shiite leaders recently asserted that Waite was alive and
well, which suggests he is being held separately from the other
hostages.
   Five Western hostages have been released the past four months.
   The first two were Americans Robert Polhill and Frank Reed,
freed 10 days apart in April.
   
   Swiss orthopedic specialists of the International Committee of
the Red Cross, Emanuel Christen and Elio Erriquez, were released
respectively last month after 10 months in captivity.
   
   The latest freed was Irish teacher Brian Keenan, who was
released on Aug. 24. Keenan said upon his release that he had seen
Anderson and McCarthy in captivity and that both were well.

   Young people left the sand and surf
at the end of the Labor Day weekend with city officials and
merchants pleased there wasn't a repeat of last year's violence.
   Some of the young visitors complained much of the fun also was
missing.
   ``I think I'll be in the Bahamas next year,'' said Tracy Jordan,
21, of New York City. ``It's just too much trouble to get down here
and then they kept us from going anywhere.''
   Last year, the informal end-of-summer party that draws thousands
of students, many from predominantly black East Coast colleges, was
marred by violent confrontations between police and young people.
More than 100 stores along the main beachfront avenue were looted.
Hundreds were arrested, and damage was estimated at more than $1.4
million.
   This year, facing accusations that the city didn't want black
visitors, officials took an active role in planning the weekend.
Turnout was low _ down from an estimated 100,000 last year to about
28,000 this year.
   The city closed a 200-block section of the oceanfront to
traffic. Visitors with hotel reservations could drive in, but
others had to walk or take buses.
   ``I think the restrictions have significantly helped in the
planning of the event,'' said City Manager Aubrey V. Watts.
   But many of the young visitors complained. ``We couldn't go
nowhere,'' said 28-year-old Elaine Alexis of New York City. ``Can't
have any fun here. They're just too strict.''
   Jack Gravely, president of the Virginia chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People,, said the civil
rights group supported the city's control of access to the
beachfront, but was uncomfortable with the high profile of police.
   ``It seemed as if the city had a South African frame of mind.
It's sending an ominous message that anytime you have a large
number of blacks gathering, you are under a state of siege,'' he
said.
   Hundreds of extra officers were on duty when the weekend
started. But after peaceful nights Friday and Saturday, state
police scaled back operations.
   The violence last year prompted a call for an economic boycott
of this year's party by some blacks, and businesses along the
resort strip reported lower than normal sales on what is generally
the busiest weekend of the summer.
   But for the most part, merchants were content.
   ``My business was off, but I'm happy with what we got. I'm glad
this is over and everybody had a good time,'' said Herman Davison
at the Showboat Bar.

   About 500 British women and children are expected
to travel in a bus convoy from Kuwait to Baghdad on Tuesday, the
Foreign Office said.
   Once in the Iraqi capital, they hope to continue overland to
neighboring Jordan or to fly to Amman en route home.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said the estimated 500 people will be
housed in hotels after the half-day journey to Baghdad while their
exit visas were arranged.
   ``We are willing to take any route which we can use to get our
citizens out. Any option is as easy or as difficult as the Iraqis
choose to make it,'' the spokesman said.
   The British Broadcasting Service was to transmit instructions by
radio to those wishing to join the convoy to be at the Sultan
Center car park in Salmiyah before dawn Tuesday, carrying one
suitcase per person plus hand luggage.
   ``They should be prepared for a long journey and take water and
food accordingly,'' the planned broadcast said.
   The Foreign Office said it knew of 25 British citizens with exit
visas in Baghdad.
   It said it was also considering chartering Iraqi planes to
evacuate Britons from Baghdad. ``We're not talking about a ransom
here to get people out. We're talking about paying a commercial
fare,'' the spokesman said.
   The government estimates 2,500 Britons are still in Kuwait and
about 500 in Iraq.
   An Iraqi Airways jet that landed in Paris, London and Washington
on Sunday carried 199 Britons, mostly people detained in Kuwait.
The Boeing 747 returned to London on Monday to pick up about 105
Iraqis in Britain.
   Britain also said it has protested to Iraq over the detention of
seven British men who were held with three Americans while seeking
exit visas for their wives.
   The Foreign Office said the 10 men, all employees of the Bechtel
Corp., were thought to have been taken to ``civilian
installations'' around Baghdad after being picked up Saturday.
   The Washington Post reported from Baghdad that the Americans
were lured from haven at the U.S. Embassy when Iraqi immigration
authorities asked them to report in connection with their wives'
exit visas.
   The Foreign Office spokesman, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity, said he did not know whether the Britons had been in the
British Embassy, their homes or hotels.
   ``We have protested to the Iraqi authorities both in London and
Baghdad about this,'' said the spokesman.
   The Foreign Office earlier said it was checking reports that
Iraq has banned all foreign flights intending to pick up Western
women and children.
   A British airline, Virgin Atlantic, said it had been refused
permission to land in Baghdad. A French aircraft was also denied
permission.
   Virgin Atlantic said it would fly a jumbo jet with blankets,
food and medicine to Amman on Tuesday, and fly out about 150
Britons, Europeans and Americans who have fled Iraq.
   It said the remaining seats would go to Egyptian refugees, with
the plane stopping first in Cairo. The passengers would be carried
free of charge, it said.
   Virgin Atlantic said it was acting on an appeal by King Hussein
of Jordan to its chairman, Richard Branson, for help in coping with
the tens of thousands of refugees who have poured into Jordan from
Iraq.

   Three state troopers were injured and 25
people were arrested during an annual live pigeon shoot Monday
after protesters rushed onto a field and tried to free the caged
birds.
   Several fistfights broke out, a skunk was thrown at
demonstrators and one protester kicked out the windshield of a car
before state police stopped the protest at the 57th Fred Coleman
Memorial Shoot in Hegins.
   Participants pay to shoot birds released from cages, and the
proceeds are used to maintain a park in this small east-central
Pennsylvania town.
   Fourteen people with fake blood dripping from their mouths ran
onto the field at different times to free the animals. Spectators
chanted ``shoot'' as state police tried to handcuff the
demonstrators.
   ``It was just getting out of control,'' said state police
spokesman Tom Lyon. He said 40 officers were assigned to the park
and a state police helicopter was called in as an ``extra show of
force.''
   The 14 people who rushed the field were charged with criminal
trespass. An additional 11 demonstrators were charged with
disorderly conduct. The officers received only minor injuries.
   About 150 people from Pennsylvania, California, Maryland,
Kansas, Illinois, New Jersey, West Virginia, Virginia, Texas and
Florida picketed the Labor Day event, billed as the largest live
pigeon shoot in the world.
   Competitors using shotguns stood about 20 yards from the birds,
which were released one a time from metal cages. After a group of
birds was shot, a group of ``trapper boys'' ran onto the field to
retrieve them.
   The children would wring the birds' necks or pull their heads
off if they were fluttering on the ground wounded. Dead birds were
put in a barrel to be used in fertilizer, shooters said.
   An estimated 4,800 birds were killed Monday, organizers said.
   Tammy Cox, a mother with three children, said she is sick of the
yearly display by protesters and told them to ``take care of their
own back yards.''
   ``Our churches are packed on Sundays,'' said Anne Coleman. ``We
have more churches than barrooms. So we're doing something right.
Good people come out of this area. We even had a Miss Pennsylvania
a few years ago.''
   Jack Keating, a 30-year shooter, said the protesters don't
realize the event is just ``shooting rats with wings.''
   Tim Leese, 12, sported a T-shirt that read, ``Save a Pigeon.
Kill a Protester.''
   ``They're retarded,'' the seventh grader said. ``They should
protest something else. It's not too cruel because the pigeons
carry diseases.''
   Signs read, ``Small Men, Big Guns,'' ``Stop the Slaughter,'' and
``Killing for Fun is Sick.''
   ``It's deplorable that these men get their kicks out of this,''
said Paula Murphy, an elementary school teacher from Ashland.

   NASA's third countdown for the space
shuttle Columbia and its astronomy mission proceeded uninterrupted
Monday as the space agency aimed for a Thursday liftoff.
   ``We want the shuttle Columbia and the science payload to be
right when we launch,'' said Vance Brand, commander of the
seven-man crew. ``We are enthusiastic about the mission and ready
to fly it.''
   The latest countdown began early Monday and liftoff is scheduled
for 1:20 a.m. EDT Thursday. If the Columbia takes off, it will be
the first shuttle launched since hydrogen fuel leaks grounded
NASA's three-shuttle fleet in the spring.
   Columbia originally was scheduled to lift off with the $150
million Astro observatory in March 1986. However, the January 1986
explosion of the Challenger, which killed all seven crew members,
postponed all shuttle missions.
   Columbia's launch was eventually rescheduled for May 30 of this
year, but hydrogen fuel leaks halted the countdown.
   A month later, the Atlantis shuttle also was found to have
hydrogen leaks, prompting the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration to ground the whole fleet. Atlantis' classified
Pentagon mission, originally scheduled for July, is now set for
November.
   Last week, communications problems with Astro's X-ray telescope
halted Columbia's second countdown. The launch had been scheduled
for Saturday.
   Four astronomers on board will take turns operating Astro's
three ultraviolet telescopes round the clock. But the X-ray
telescope has to be managed by computer commands sent from Goddard
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
   The communication problem was corrected over the weekend when
workers replaced an electronic component in the 1,500-pound X-ray
telescope, anchored along with the ultraviolet telescopes in
Columbia's cargo bay. A minor software problem was fixed Sunday.
   The Columbia would be the first shuttle launched since April,
when Discovery carried the flawed Hubble Space Telescope into
orbit. The stretch between missions is the longest since flights
resumed in 1988 following the Challenger disaster.
   A beleaguered NASA has spent the summer also contending with
Hubble's defective mirror and communications problems with the
Venus-orbiting Magellan spacecraft.
   At NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, engineers
hoped computer commands radioed this week and next would restore
the Magellan spacecraft to normal operation. They have not
determined why the Magellan suffered two long communications
blackouts, but hoped its $744 million mission to map Venus with
radar would begin this month.
   ``We've had some trouble, but responding to trouble, fixing
problems, is our strong suit,'' said Columbia test director Mike
Leinbach. ``We've been disappointed several times, of course, but
Thursday morning we hope that's all behind us.''
   ``I'm ready to get this one off the ground'' and move on to
Discovery's planned flight in October with the Ulysses spacecraft,
Leinbach said. Ulysses is to study the sun.
   Columbia's nine- to 10-day mission will be one of the longest
since the first shuttle flight in 1981. It also will be the first
shuttle mission in five years devoted entirely to scientific
research.
   Astro will examine some of the hottest objects in the universe,
including a supernova and Comet Levy, which is making its first
recorded pass through the solar system. The observatory will remain
in the cargo bay and be returned to Earth for possible use on a
future mission.

Action</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 600 anti-logging demonstrators
marched peacefully Monday to a lumber mill here for the last
planned protest of Redwood Summer.
   The ``Redwoodstock'' marchers were met by 100
counter-demonstrators. Authorities said there were no arrests and
no violence as the environmentalists made their way to the Pacific
Lumber Co. mill in this town on California's northern coast.
   The march came on the third day of the last summer action
planned by environmentalists who oppose clear-cutting and logging
of old growth timber. Logging companies had urged their employees
and others who back timber interests to ignore the protest.
   Humboldt County sheriff's officials said 700 to 800 Redwood
Summer participants gathered peacefully over Labor Day weekend.
   The main campsite for the protesters was on the banks of the Eel
River near Fortuna.
   About 100 law enforcement officers were on hand over the
weekend, said sheriff's spokeswoman Leona Mendenhall.
   Humboldt County tried to block the march by refusing to approve
a permit. A federal judge in San Francisco ruled last week that
such a prohibition violated the marchers' freedom of speech. The
judge allowed the march to go on.

<HEAD>Socialists Reportedly Willing to Accept Minority in New Cabinet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Socialists are offering to
take a minority share of seats in a new Cabinet to induce the
opposition into joining a coalition government, an opposition
leader said Monday.
   Petar Dertliev, chairman of the opposition Bulgarian Social
Democratic Party, said after meeting with Premier Andrei Lukanov on
Monday that the Socialists were willing to accept only 40-45
percent of the positions in a new Cabinet.
   Dertliev also said Lukanov, a leading Socialist, had offered to
freeze his membership in the Socialist Party.
   ``The meeting created an atmosphere of dialogue between the
government and the opposition, and it gave certain guarantees for
the civil peace,'' Dertliev said.
   The Socialists are the renamed Communist Party, now dominated by
the reformers who ousted hard-line leader Todor Zhivkov in
November. The sole exception to the trend away from Communism in
Eastern Europe, they won multiparty elections in June.
   But the Socialists have seen their popularity plummet since then
because of Bulgaria's worsening economy.
   Many key food and consumer items are rationed, and Bulgaria has
placed a moratorium on paying its $10.3 billion foreign debt. The
Socialists' newspaper Duma said Sunday that the country is
threatened with famine.
   President Zhelyu Zhelev, a prominent opposition figure, last
week asked Lukanov to form a new government.
   The Socialists want to draw opposition figures into the
government because they say comprehensive economic reforms cannot
be made without broader public support than they alone can muster,
and that no Western aid will be forthcoming if the Socialists
govern alone.
   The opposition has refused to enter a coalition government if it
has a minority in parliament.
   Zhelev last week said ``an outright coalition is out of the
question.'' Dertliev on Monday termed the idea ``destructive'' for
the Socialists' opponents.
   But Dertliev said the Agrarian Party, one of the largest
opposition parties, was ready to accept the Socialists' invitation
to enter a coalition. There was no confirmation from the Agrarian
Party.
   An opposition spokesman also told reporters that Parliament had
gone into closed session Friday to discuss a claim of
responsibility for a fire that gutted the Socialist Party
headquarters on Aug. 26.
   Michail Nedelchev, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic
Forces, a coalition of opposition political parties, told reporters
the claim was made by an anonymous caller to Vice President Atanas
Semerdzhiev on behalf of a group calling itself the Bulgarian
Secret Central Revolutionary Committee.
   No information about the Committee was available, and its claim
to have set the fire could not be verified.
   The party headquarters in downtown Sofia was torched during an
anti-Communist demonstration on Aug. 26. The protesters were
demanding the removal of the red star _ the symbol of Communist,
one-party rule _ atop the building.

<TEXT>
   Sueb Nakasathien, known as one of
Thailand's most dedicated wildlife conservationists, shot himself
to death in a vast wilderness area he fought to protect, an
official said Monday. He was 41.
   Gov. Uthai Manthavorn of Uthai Thani province said the death was
believed a suicide. He said it was certain Sueb killed himself with
a pistol at his quarters in Huay Khakaeng Wildlife Reserve. The
body was found Saturday.
   The governor said he learned from Sueb's subordinates that Sueb
had set very high standards and was probably disillusioned by lack
of results.
   Sueb spent years at Huay Khakaeng and adjacent Thung Yai
sanctuary, which contain one of the last great forests of mainland
Southeast Asia and an abundance of animal life.
   He assailed a plan to build a major dam in the area and tried to
ward off other attempts at encroachment by loggers and poachers
which adversely affected Thailand's wildlife parks and reserves.
The plan was shelved in 1988.
   Funeral arrangements were uncertain.

<HEAD>Pakistani Court Overturns Nepotism Charge against Bhutto Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday
overturned charges of nepotism and abuse of power against Ehsanul
Haq Piracha, who was deputy finance minister under ousted Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan removed Ms. Bhutto on Aug. 6 on
charges of corruption, incompetence and abuse of power.
   Weeks earlier, the Lahore High Court accused Piracha of nepotism
when he granted a relative permission to start a stock exchange at
Islamabad.
   The case was a civil matter aimed at stopping establishment of
the stock exchange. No criminal charges were filed.
   But the charge was widely used by opposition politicians to
attack Ms Bhutto's government. That and other allegations prompted
Ishaq Khan to dismiss her 20-month administration.
   The nation's highest court disputed the Lahore finding, saying,
``Relationship with a director or promotor or a sponsor of a
publically owned company or a trade organization does not
disqualify an administrative decision-maker.''
   The ruling will make only a minor dent in corruption charges
leveled against Ms. Bhutto, her former Cabinet and members of her
Pakistan People's Party.

   A district court sentenced a 16-year-old Jewish
youth to 10 months in prison Monday for stoning cars belonging to
Palestinians from the occupied territories, the national news
agency Itim said.
   The youth, whose name was not given, also drew a one-year

any damage or injuries.
   The stonings two weeks ago followed anti-Arab rioting after two
Jewish teen-agers were slain in Arab east Jerusalem, believed
killed by Palestinians.
   Stonings and firebomb attacks have characterized the
33-month-old Palestinian revolt against Israeli rule in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<DATELINE>CASTLEMAINS, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lady Home, wife of ex-prime
minister Lord Home, died Monday after a stroke, her son said. She
was 80.
   Lady Home died in Law Hospital, Carluke, a southern Scottish
town near the family's shooting estate at Castlemains, in
Larnarkshire, said her son, David Douglas-Home.
   He said his mother was taken ill at home while his father was
out walking on the estate. She was taken to the hospital in a coma
from which she never recovered.
   Lady Home, the former Elizabeth Alington, was the daughter of
the Very Rev. Cecil Alington, who was headmaster of Eton when Alec
Douglas-Home _ then Lord Dunglass _ attended the prestigious boys'
boarding school during World War I.
   She married Home, seven years her senior, in 1936 after they had
met again as adults when she visited Scotland. They had one son and
three daughters.
   Home, the 14th Earl of Home and scion of an ancient Scottish
aristocratic family, renounced his titles in 1963 to become prime
minister. He served in that post until 1964, and then was
opposition leader until 1965.
   Home was later knighted and was given a life title, Lord Home of
the Hirsel, in 1974. The Hirsel, in Berwickshire, near the
Scottish-English border, is another huge estate owned by the family.
   Lady Home often traveled with her husband through his long
political career as a top leader of the Conservative Party.
   But she once described how his career often kept them apart,
even when together.
   ``Actually we did find ourselves sitting next to each other at
the Guildhall (the Lord Mayor of London's official residence), but
I couldn't think of anything to say to him,'' Lady Home said.
``After all you cannot ask him about the children in the middle of
an official function.''

   Former Israeli Army Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen.
Moshe Levy, was seriously injured and partly paralyzed Monday in an
accident at his home, hospital officials said.
   Israel radio said Levy slipped and fell on his back at his home
on the communal settlement of Beit Alfa in northern Israel.
   He suffered an injury to his spine and could not move some of
his limbs, the radio said.
   Levy was admitted to the neurosurgery wing of the Tel Hashomer
Hospital near Tel Aviv.
   ``He is not in danger of dying, but he is suffering from some
paralysis,'' said Head Nurse Hanna Hava. She would not disclose
further details about his condition.
   She said doctors had not yet decided if Levy needed surgery and
that there was a chance his paralysis was temporary.
   Levy, 54, retired from the army in February 1987 after serving
for four years as chief of staff. He assumed command in 1983 during
Israel's invasion of Lebanon and was instrumental in withdrawing
the bulk of the Israeli troops from that country in 1985.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jordan's King Hussein told President Francois
Mitterrand on Monday that Jordan is suffering the most in the
Persian Gulf crisis, sources close to their talks said.
   Mitterrand pledged emergency aid of $770,000 to Jordan to help
ease the crush of refugees from neighboring Iraq.
   Hussein's trip on the crisis has already taken him to nine
countries.
   He dined in Paris on Monday with U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar. No details of those talks were available, but the
U.N. chief was believed to have briefed Hussein on his two days of
fruitless talks with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz.
   Perez de Cuellar arrived Sunday in Paris, saying he was ``deeply
disappointed'' he failed to budge Iraq on withdrawing its soldiers
from Kuwait, which it invaded Aug. 2.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said Monday that France would
support tightening the U.N.-imposed economic embargo of Iraq to
include cutting off Iraq's land and air links.
   If the embargo proves ineffective, France's position ``would be
to extend it,'' he said on the TV interview show ``L'Heure de
Verite.''
   Dumas expressed hope that at the U.S.-Soviet summit next Sunday
in Helsinki ``the Americans and Soviets agree on a solution that
can be a solution of peace . . . or a solution of greatest
firmness, that is, reinforcing the embargo, . . . (and) eventually
forcible action.''
   Dumas said a joint French-U.S. command will be set up in
Bahrain, just off Saudi Arabia, to coordinate movements of U.S. and
French fleets.
   Hussein told Mitterrand he was ``deeply preoccupied that Jordan
is the country suffering the most from the situation,'' sources
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   More than 250,000 refugees have poured across Jordan's border
with Iraq since Iraq's invasion. Jordan's resources are severely
strained trying to provide shelter and food for them.
   The aid promised by Mitterrand is in addition to about $4
million granted to Jordan by the European Community.
   Hussein, a long-time friend and strong ally of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein, has been criticized for his reluctance to join
international sanctions on Iraq.

<TEXT>
   An Iraqi Airways jumbo jet bearing a group of
Iraqis who were stranded in Britain by the Persian Gulf crisis took
off from London's Heathrow airport Monday night bound for Baghdad,
the Iraqi capital.
   A senior official with the airline, speaking on condition of not
being further identified, said the plane left with 195 passengers.
   The jet arrived from Washington after carrying Westerners from
Baghdad to the United States, Britain and France over the weekend.
   They were among thousands of Westerners detained by Iraq after
its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and imposition of U.N. sanctions on
the government of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Many Iraqis were
left in Britain without transportation home.
   ``This is a very terrible situation and we hope it can be
settled peacefully,'' said Ahmed Ali, an Iraqi flying out with his
wife and four children.
   ``We do not want war but I must say I support Saddam Hussein. He
is only doing what he believes is correct for his Arab brothers.
However, I do believe it is wrong to use women and children to
prevent an attack against Iraq. But this proves he thinks the
Americans and British will attack our country.''
   An Iraqi who refused to give his name said he was returning to
get his family and leave Iraq.
   ``President Saddam is crazy,'' he said. ``He wants war to prove
he is the leader of all the Arabs. But he is wrong. He will die if
there is war _ and so will my country. There is no future in Iraq.''

<HEAD>Iraq Suspends Repaying Foreign Debt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq on Monday suspended repayment of its
foreign debt in response to the United Nations trade embargo, the
official Iraqi News Agency reported.
   Iraq's outstanding debt has been estimated at $30 billion to $35
billion, most of it owed to the United States, Britain, France, the
Soviet Union, West Germany and Japan for purchases of weapons,
technology and food.
   In another development, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz urged
countries that have large number of expatriates in Iraq to ``take
urgent measures'' to send them food supplies, according to INA,
monitored in Cyprus.
   ``Suffering as it is from the effects of the international
siege, Iraq will not be responsible for their suffering resulting
from the shortages in food supplies,'' Aziz was quoted as telling
Cornelio Sommaruga, president of the International Committee of the
Red Cross, on Monday.
   INA quoted Mohammed Mahdi Saleh, the acting minister of commerce
and finance, as saying the debt suspension would have extremely
adverse effects on countries and companies ``incapable of
withstanding the current situation.''
   He was referring to the economic difficulties faced by poorer
countries who count on trade with Iraq for generating critical
foreign exchange.
   Some countries, like Sri Lanka and Jordan, have asked the United
Nations to clarify what items are covered by the embargo.
   Jordan relies heavily on income from Iraqi shipments through the
port of Aqaba. It has asked for international financial help to
make up for the loss caused by the embargo.
   Saleh was quoted as saying, ``Compensation is not going to be a
solution for the economic crisis because it is temporary, limited
and ineffectual for dealing with the losses suffered by these
countries . . . dragged into the aggressive schemes of the U.S.
administration.''
   The U.N. Security Council imposed the trade embargo Aug. 6 to
force Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait, which
he invaded Aug. 2 and subsequently annexed.
   INA said Iraq had paid $5.5 billion on its debt in the first
half of this year.
   Saleh, a U.S.-educated economist, said the impact of the crisis
on the world economy was indicated by U.S. moves to obtain help in
paying for its Persian Gulf deployment.
   President Bush last Thursday appealed to prosperous countries in
Western Europe and Asia to subsidize the cost of U.N. economic
sanctions enforced by a great fleet of warships in the gulf region.
   In his comments to the Red Cross, Aziz said he hoped the
organization would assist the countries involved in taking needed
measures to supply foreign nationals in Iraq with food, INA said.
   Iraq has said previously that should food shortages occur
because of the U.N. sanctions, foreign hostages would suffer the
same as the Iraqi population.
   The invasion of Kuwait caught about 3 million foreigners in Iraq
and Kuwait, including about 3,000 Americans and 18,000 other
Westerners.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer
resigned Tuesday as opinion polls indicated his ruling Labour Party
would be routed in next month's national elections.
   External Relations and Trade Minister Mike Moore, who Palmer
defeated in a party vote when former Premier David Lange resigned
13 months ago, was named to succeed Palmer in the Oct. 27
balloting. The opposition National Party is leading by a large
margin over the Labour Party in the latest polls.
   Moore, 41, who in recent months had repeatedly denied he would
seek to unseat Palmer, had been ranked third in power behind Palmer
and Deputy Prime Minister Helen Clark.
   Moore told a news conference that New Zealanders wanted a ``new
direction'' and that his bid for the leadership ``in no way is a
reflection on Mr. Palmer's service to New Zealand.''
   New Zealand, with 3.5 million residents, has been hit in recent
months by a weakness in its general economy and a rise in
unemployment.
   Palmer, 48, had denied he would step down as recently as Monday.
New Zealand Press Association quoted sources as saying he had
enough support to stay in office but decided to quit because the
internal power struggle would have devastated the party.
   Palmer told a news conference he ``may well have had the numbers
to remain, but I took the view that to have a leadership contest on
a vote would be destructive, it would be divisive, that it was not
in the best interests of the collective.''
   Palmer said, ``I've done the best that I can do and I certainly
hope that we will improve our fortunes (for victory) in the next
eight weeks.''
   Palmer appears ready to leave politics altogether. He said he
would not seek re-election to Parliament, although he agreed to
stay on as environment minister, a non-Cabinet position, through
the election.
   Labour parliamentarians, who met briefly Tuesday, were to meet
again Thursday.
   The move comes as Labour members have voiced concern they could
not hold onto power with Palmer as leader. Some have run campaign
ads without the Labour logo.
   A Radio New Zealand poll in late July showed the conservative
Nationals leading by a 46 percent to 21 percent margin over Labour.
   Polls also have shown Moore to be leading all candidates for
prime minister. Moore was the clear choice too in a survey of
business chief executives.
   Some political commentators say Labour may even be hard pressed
to hold onto 20 seats in the 97-seat Parliament, a result that
could oust several Cabinet ministers, including Ms. Clark.
   Labour holds 56 seats, the Nationals 40 and the breakaway
left-wing New Labour Party one. The 5-month-old Green Party has
been running third in opinion polls.
   However, a large section of voters remain undecided, including
many traditional Labour supporters. Opinion polls in some
electorates have put the undecided vote at 38-47 percent.
   Labour took power in 1984, ousting the Nationals. It won
re-election in 1987 despite losing some support because of its
deregulation policies.
   Palmer defeated Moore for the prime minister's job at a
government caucus after Lange resigned in August 1989 due to health
reasons. Both Palmer and Moore represent districts in Christchurch,
the largest city on New Zealand's South Island.
   Palmer is a former attorney who taught law at the University of
Iowa and University of Virginia.
   Moore became the youngest person ever elected to Parliament when
he won his first seat in 1972 at age 23. He was ousted in 1975 in
Labour's landslide loss, but returned three years later.

   North Korean Prime Minister Yon Hyong
Muk and 90 of his countrymen crossed the heavily armed Korean
border into South Korea on Tuesday for a historic visit aimed at
easing four decades of hostilities.
   Yon and the six official North Korean delegates to the premiers'
talks were welcomed by their South Korean counterparts at the truce
village of Panmunjom inside the Demilitarized Zone separating the
rival Koreas.
   ``A Korean proverb says a thousand miles start with a first
step,'' said South Korean Unification Minister Hong Sung-chul, who
was among those to greet the visitors.
   The North Koreans were given bouquets of flowers, a traditional
Korean gift of friendship, and tea, before being escorted to South
Korean-made sedans for a 35-mile trip south to Seoul.
   A military helicopter hovered overhead as the motorcade of 12
cars and three buses prepared to move south toward Seoul.
   The group is the first to cross the border since 1985 and only
the third delegation to travel to the South since the end of World
War II in 1945.
   South Korean Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon was to meet the
North Koreans at a luxury hotel near Olympic Park, official
headquarters for the talks.
   The premiers' meeting is seen as a new phase in capitalist South
Korea's efforts to coax the totalitarian Communist North out from
four decades of isolation and begin a thaw in their Cold War.
   South Korean officials say the meeting will be the first in
which both sides recognize the legitimacy of each other's
governments. North Korea has steadfastly refused to recognize the
Seoul government since the Koreas established separate capitals in
1948.
   During the visit, the North Korean prime minister is expected to
make a courtesy call of South Korean President Roh Tae-woo,
possibly delivering a letter from North Korean leader Kim Il Sung.
   If all goes well, a second round of talks is to be held Oct.
16-19 in North Korea's capital of Pyongyang.
   ``The Korean peninsula still remains in the grip of the Cold War
era that has placed South and North Korea in a state of mutual
distrust and confrontation,'' said Unification Minister Hong
Sung-chul, spokesman for the South Korean delegation.
   ``This continued national tragedy should not be permitted to go
on endlessly,'' he said. ``Every effort must be made to establish
regular dialogue between the two sides.''
   The Korean peninsula was divided at the end of World War II into
the Communist North and capitalist South. The two sides fought the
1950-53 Korean War but a peace treaty was never signed.
   The border between the Koreas remains the most heavily fortified
permanent demarcation in the world, with more than 1.5 million
armed men on either side behind bunkers and barbed wire. There is
no travel, mail or other communication between civilians of the two
sides.
   Stock prices in Seoul jumped Monday by four percent in
anticipation of the visit. Businessmen believe the visit could lay
the groundwork to joint ventures combining the North's resources
and cheap labor with South Korean capital and technology.
   Formal talks were scheduled Wednesday and Thursday and the
delegation is to return north on Friday. The schedule also includes
informal talks and sightseeing, lavish dinners, a stage show and a
trip to the National Museum, which houses relics of shared Korean
history.

   A tearful Jerry Lewis remembered the late
Sammy Davis Jr. Monday during Lewis' 25th telethon to raise money
to fight muscular dystrophy.
   The event raised a record $44,172,186 in pledged donations,
organizers said.
   Weeping, the comedian narrated a tribute to Davis, who appeared
at the Muscular Dystrophy Association telethon for 13 years,
including last year while suffering from the cancer that killed
him. On Sunday, Lewis dedicated the telethon to his friend.
   ``There is only one reason why he isn't here with us this year,
and that is the only thing that could have kept him away,'' Lewis
said Monday. ``When you knew him, you knew that God made something
special.''
   The Labor Day telethon changed settings this year, moving to
Hollywood after 17 years in Las Vegas. Producers said they wanted
to cut costs and update the telethon's image.
   The Las Vegas shows raised millions in pledges, with last year's
tally a record $42.2 million to fight 40 neuromuscular diseases
that kill and cripple thousands of people annually, most of them
young people.
   In 17 years in Las Vegas, Lewis has raised more than half a
billion dollars.
   While donors phoned in pledges to the studio on Sunset
Boulevard, about 40 protesters marched outside, demanding more
accountability for the money.
   ``We want them to open up and really show us what they have
achieved,'' said Sue Marston, secretary of a group called the
Alliance for Research Accountability.
   ``Every year they say they have a new break,'' she said. ``They
always say the cure is right around the corner. They always say
they're breathtakingly close.''
   Gary Cifra, president of the activist group said, ``There's no
treatment and there's no cure. Something's wrong.''
   Telephone calls made about 30 minutes after the telethon was

   Gang members thwarted in an attempt to
attack rivals rampaged through the city, killing one person and
wounding up to nine others, police said Monday.
   The victims apparently were chosen at random during a four-hour
spree of shootings and robberies Sunday night throughout this
central California city of 350,000 people, said Sgt. Mike Guthrie.
   ``There doesn't seem to be any identifiable pattern,'' Guthrie
said. ``I think it was more driving until they saw an opportunity
and taking it.''
   Police arrested four boys, ages 14, 15, 16 and 17, and
confiscated five guns early Monday. All of those arrested are from
Fresno, Guthrie said.
   Each was charged with one count of murder, six counts of
attempted murder and seven counts of armed robbery. Their names
were withheld because of their ages.
   One suspect remained at large and additional charges were
pending against the four held, police said.
   Besides the three shotguns, one rifle and a handgun, police
seized crack cocaine from one of the youths, Guthrie said.
   The rampage began after uniformed officers patrolled a
drug-infested west Fresno neighborhood called ``the U,'' said
Guthrie.
   Five gang members intended to shoot rivals, but left the area
because of the police, Guthrie said.
   After the fatal shooting downtown, one juvenile left the group,
Guthrie said. The other four robbed and shot people along an
eight-mile stretch north to near Fresno State University, then
headed back downtown, he said.
   ``This entire scenario was an afterthought,'' Guthrie said.
   The shooting spree was ``unprecedented in our city,'' he said.
``I can recall nothing of this magnitude ... There very easily
could have been half a dozen or more murder victims.''
   Police blamed the juveniles for the killing of a 47-year-old man
and shootings that left six other men wounded.
   Two remained hospitalized Monday in serious condition, said Sgt.
Dwight Williamson. The others weren't seriously wounded, he said.
The victims' names were withheld released.
   Three other people were injured in shootings Sunday night and
investigators were trying to determine whether the same youths were
to blame.

   Campus life was returning to normal
Monday for many college students frightened by a string of
mutilation murders, but police warned that the killer could still
be on the loose.
   Students returning to the University of Florida for the second
week of classes said they were less worried than they were last
week by the deaths of five students who were found slain in their
apartments.
   ``All you can do is be very careful. I'm usually in my room
before dark,'' said Ava, a sophomore from Fort Lauderdale who
refused to give her last name.
   ``Everyone I know is calming down,'' said Aaron Sotala, 20, a
sophomore from Copper Harbor, Mich. ``It has been almost week, but
there is still tension on the campus.''
   Police said they have eight suspects, but warned residents
against dropping their guard.
   ``Students should know that the killer has not been apprehended
_ the killer is not in custody _ and assume that person or persons
is still in the area,'' Lt. Sadie Darnell, a police spokeswoman,
said Monday.
   Police said an emotionally troubled University of Florida
freshman, in custody in Brevard County for allegedly assaulting his
grandmother, remained a suspect.
   Edward Lewis Humphrey was held on $1 million bond. Public
Defender J.R. Russo said he would seek a hearing Tuesday to request
reduced the bond.
   ``Are we just holding a citizen just because he fits a certain
mental pychological profile or do they have specific evidence which
justifies a million dollar bond?'' Russo said Monday.
   Lt. Spencer Mann, an Alachua County Sheriff's Office spokesman,
said: ``There is a presumption that Humphrey is simply `the'
suspect in this case. He is one of a possible number of suspects.
It is premature to say he is the prime suspect in the case.''
   The Gainesville Sun reported Monday that Humphrey's psychiatric
records were subpoenaed by the task force investigating the
killings.
   Prosecutors and Humphrey's public defender said they likely
would seek a psychological evaluation of Humphrey this week.
   Humphrey's psychiatrist, Phillip K. Springer, said he opposed
being legally compelled to turn over the records and didn't believe
Humphrey's mental condition should be a basis for suspicion in the
murders. Humphrey has been treated with lithium, a mood-stabilizing
drug.
   Brevard Circuit Judge John Antoon signed an order Sunday
allowing investigators to take Humphrey's footprints to compare
with those found at one of the crime scenes.
   Police guarded his apartment over the holiday weekend while
other officers continued searching a creek behind the apartment
complex.
   Police have said the killer or killers spent a lot of time at
the crime scenes, leaving deliberate clues and relishing the
confrontation with police. Police have refused to characterize the
messages other than to say they were not in the form of notes or
other writings.
   The bodies of University of Florida freshmen Sonja Larson, 18,
and Christina Powell, 17, were found Aug. 26. The body of Sante Fe
Community College student Christa Hoyt, 18, was found the next day,
while the bodies of Tracey Paules, 23, and Manuel Taboada, 23, were
found Aug. 28. Miss Paules went to the University of Florida, while
Taboada was a student at Santa Fe.
   All five died of multiple stab wounds. The bodies of the first
three victims were mutilated, police said.
   Humphrey lived briefly this summer at an apartment complex where
Taboada and Miss Paules were killed and at Tolbert Hall, a coed
dormitory where Miss Powell lived during summer school.

<TEXT>
   Baghdad balked on Monday at allowing more airlifts of hostages,
told nations with citizens trapped in Iraq to urgently send them
food, and suspended payment of its foreign debt in response to the
U.N. trade embargo.
   Western governments expressed fear that Saddam Hussein's
government did not intend to fulfill its promise to free remaining
women and children held captive since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   Diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis also seemed mired. U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar met Monday with Jordan's
King Hussein in Paris after returning empty-handed from talks with
Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz.
   President Bush returned to Washington from his vacation home in
Maine to prepare for his Sunday summit in Helsinki, Finland, with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. They will discuss, among
other things, the gulf crisis.
   Foreign ministers of the European Community nations planned to
meet in Rome before the summit. Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Giovanni Castellaneta told reporters Monday the 12-member EC would
consider Bush's request for financial support for the U.S.-led
deployment of forces to the gulf region.
   Iraq was having its own money troubles. The official Iraqi News
Agency, monitored in Cyprus, reported Iraq had suspended repaying a
foreign debt estimated at $30 billion to $35 billion. Most of it is
owed to the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, West
Germany and Japan for purchases of weapons, technology and food.
   The U.N. Security Council imposed a trade embargo on Aug. 6 to
force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   INA also quoted Aziz as telling Cornelio Sommaruga, president of
the International Committee of the Red Cross, on Monday that
``suffering as it is from the effects of the international siege,
Iraq will not be responsible for . . . (foreigners') suffering
resulting from the shortages in food supplies.''
   Aziz urged countries with large number of expatriates caught in
Iraq to ``take urgent measures'' to send them food supplies,
according to the agency.
   About 3,000 Americans were among 21,000 Western hostages
believed in Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. Saddam says hostages
were being used as human shields to protect Iraqi targets.
   An Iraqi Airways jumbo jet carrying some Iraqis stranded in
Britain by the crisis left London late Monday for Baghdad, the
Iraqi capital. An airline official said 195 passengers were aboard.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is expected Friday in
Saudi Arabia for talks with Kuwaiti government-in-exile officials,
which likely will center on the cost to America of the military
operation.
   King Fahd promised a U.S. congressional group Sunday that Saudi
Arabia will do its utmost to help the world avert any oil crisis
due to the confrontation, according to statements distributed
Monday by the official Saudi Press Agency.
   Fahd expressed hope other oil-producing states will do the same.
   Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter. A perceived
threat to the kingdom following Kuwait's takeover helped spur U.S
military moves. Including Kuwait, Iraq now holds 20 percent of the
world's oil reserves. The U.N. embargo on Iraq and Kuwait led to a
world shortfall of 4 million barrels of oil a day.
   Diplomats at 30 embassies in Kuwait continued to defy Iraqi
orders to close their doors and get out. One reason they stood fast
was that leaving could be seen as implying recognition of Iraq's
annexation of Kuwait.
   The 10-day-old standoff was taking its toll. East Germany says
Iraqi authorities grabbed its envoy and took him to Baghdad when he
ventured out of his embassy. Troops ring the missions and power,
water and telephone service are cut off. The envoys and citizens
under their protection were running out of food and water in
120-degree temperatures.
   The punishing Mideast climate also increased the misery of
thousands of refugees, mostly Arabs and Asians, who flooded into
Jordan.
   At Shaalan, 24 miles east of the Jordanian border post at
Ruweishid, a slum city of desperate Asian refugees has sprung up.
Jordanian authorities will not process their entry until the
refugees' governments guarantee rapid repatriation.
   ``It's like a piece of sandpaper from horizon to horizon, with
scorpions and snakes,'' said Jim Nuttal, coordinator for Save the
Children who has been working with the refugees. ``They desperately
need tents, transportation, food, water and medical care.''
   During the weekend, hundreds of foreigners made their way out
aboard three separate flights from Baghdad.
   Britain and France had sought permission to send in planes to
pick up more Westerners, but they said on Monday the airlifts were
apparently on hold.
   In London, the Foreign Office said about 500 British women and
children on Tuesday will travel in a bus convoy from Kuwait to
Baghdad. They hope to continue overland to Jordan or fly to Amman,
bound for home.
   Saddam promised last week that all foreign women and children
captives could leave, but Saturday's flights were the only
large-scale departures.
   The French Foreign Ministry indicated Monday that Iraq set
unacceptable conditions for landing rights for a French plane to
repatriate 200 women and children.
   Britain's Virgin Airways said it received permission to fly into
Baghdad, but permission was revoked in a telex on Sunday.
   Calls went out Monday to keep up the pressure on Baghdad by
strictly enforcing the U.N. economic sanctions.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd was in Yemen, considered
somewhat of a weak link in the enforcement chain.
   ``If we can make sanctions fully effective ... the chances of a
peaceful solution are good, are reasonable,'' he said.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service said Iraq was asking Tokyo to bend
the sanctions _ in exchange for freeing Japanese hostages.
   The report quoted Iraq's cultural and information minister,
Latif Nasif, as saying Iraq would release Japanese if Japan resumed
buying Iraqi oil and allowed Iraq to buy food and medicine.
   Jesse Jackson, who escorted 47 freed American hostages out of
Iraq on Sunday, cautioned Monday against relying solely on military
pressure to deal with Iraq.
   ``Just as our generals are in Saudi Arabia with a military
presence, our politicians should be as evident in seeking
diplomatic solutions,'' the civil rights leader said in an
interview on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   In other developments:
   _An Army vehicle carrying Tow anti-tank missiles and other
weapons exploded Monday in eastern Saudi Arabia, the Army said. No
injuries were reported. A U.S.-led multinational force is in Saudi
Arabia to discourage any move by Iraq to seize more territory.
   _The Labor Day holiday in the United States and the unsuccessful
U.N.-Aziz talks kept trading light Monday. Stock prices fell
sharply on thin trading in Tokyo and London prices rose slightly.
   _The Turkish government said Monday it will seek power to send
troops abroad and permit foreign troops to be stationed in Turkey.
   _Iraq failed in a bid to unseat Kuwait's delegation at a
140-nation conference in Geneva reviewing an international treaty
banning the spread of nuclear weapons, diplomats said Monday. Iraq
said Kuwait had ceased to exist and had no right to representation.

<HEAD>Rival Christian Forces Skirmish in Lebanon</HEAD>

   Rival Christian forces battled with
machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades for two hours before
dawn Monday, police said.
   Warring Shiite Moslem factions meanwhile pledged to observe a
cease-fire brokered by Syria and Iran to halt an inconclusive power
struggle.
   Police said troops loyal to rebel Gen. Michel Aoun clashed with
Lebanese Forces militiamen led by rival Christian leader Samir
Geagea in east Beirut and the adjoining 310-square-mile Christian
enclave.
   They said no casualties resulted.
   Aoun and Geagea have waged an inconclusive battle for control of
the Christian enclave since Jan. 30.
   Military sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said over
the weekend that Syrian troops and Lebanese soldiers loyal to
President Elias Hrawi were being deployed around the gateways into
the Christian enclave.
   They said the buildup indicates an attack may be imminent to
drive Aoun from the presidential palace in Baabda, five miles east
of the capital.
   On Monday, Aoun warned opposing troops in a radio address they
would pay a heavy price if they attacked.
   Military sources in predominantly Moslem west Beirut, where
Hrawi's government is based, said about 6,000 Lebanese troops and
20,000 Syrians, backed by 300 tanks, have been positioned around
the main approaches to Metn province, where Aoun has been holding
out with 19,000 troops.
   The buildup followed a summit in Damascus Wednesday between
Hrawi and Syrian President Hafez Assad, who pledged to help
Lebanon's government extend its authority over the whole of Lebanon.
   Aoun refuses to recognize Hrawi, who was elected Nov. 24 to
implement an Arab League-brokered plan to end Lebanon's 15-year-old
civil war.
   Aoun wants a guarantee for withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian troops
deployed in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab league peacekeeping mandate.
   The peace plan gives the Moslems, who make up 55 percent of
Lebanon's 4 million people, an equal share of power with the
traditionally dominant Christians.
   Hrawi has fired Aoun as interim prime minister and army
commander, but the general refuses to step down.
   The cease-fire between rival Shiite forces was called at 8 p.m.
Sunday after meetings between representatives of the Iranian-backed
fundamentalist Hezbollah and the more secular, pro-Syrian Amal
militia. three years.
   The two factions have been fighting for dominance among the 1.2
million Shiites who make up Lebanon's largest single sect.

   Arab League Secretary-General Chedli Klibi
resigned Monday, apparently in anticipation of next week's
relocation of the League's headquarters to Cairo, officials said.
   Klibi, 66, a Tunisian, has been the Arab League's secretary
general since 1979, when the organization's headquarters were moved
from Cairo to Tunis. He was reappointed to a five-year term in
March 1989.
   The decision to move the headquarters back to the Egyptian
capital has provoked protests from Iraq. Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz criticized the move because of what he called Egypt's
``partial attitude'' against Iraq.
   Klibi apparently did not want to take responsibility for
divisions within the League concerning the location of its
headquarters, observers said.
   The Arab League Secretariat is expected to release a communique
explaining Klibi's resignation, Arab League officials said.
   A meeting of Arab League ministers has been called for Sept. 10
in Cairo, where the transfer of the League's headquarters back to
Cairo will be officially announced.

   The city of Chelyabinsk, which was wracked by
shortages of food, tobacco and alcohol suffered more woes Monday
when bus drivers went on strike, the Tass news agency reported.
   The drivers, whose demands include higher wages, longer
vacations, retirement at age 55 and better housing, agreed to
return to work later in the day, Tass said. It did not elaborate on
their demands.
   The buses in the southern Ural Mountains city of about 1 million
people are old, with no spare parts, and the regional transit
authority loses about $35 million a year, the official news agency
said.
   On Aug. 22-24, disturbances broke out in Chelyabinsk, about 900
miles east of Moscow, following a protest by hundreds of
demonstrators demanding better supplies of food and consumer goods,
according to Soviet media.
   The Worker's Tribune newspaper reported Sunday that 64 people
were injured, including 11 policemen, and five people were arrested.
   The protests began when a supermarket refused to sell alcohol to
shoppers waiting in line and expanded to include food and tobacco.
Cigarettes have been in short supply all summer.

<TEXT>
   A light plane crash Monday seriously injured
two candidates in Nevada's primary election, authorities said. One
person was killed in the election-eve accident.
   The injured included Sue Wagner, a candidate for lieutenant
governor, and Bob Seale, who is running for state treasurer.
   Seale, a licensed pilot, was flying the plane, said Churchill
County Sheriff Bill Lawry.
   The Republicans were among five people aboard a twin-engine
Cessna 411 that crashed shortly after takeoff from the Fallon,
Nev., municipal airport, about 60 miles east of Reno, the sheriff
said. The plane was carrying the candidates to Carson City from
Fallon, where they attended a Labor Day parade.
   It appeared the plane's right engine lost power and the pilot
was trying to make it back to the airport when the crash occurred
shortly after 12:30 p.m. in a grassy area about a mile from the
airport. The plane was badly damaged and witnesses said one of its
wings was sheared off.
   Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said Seale's wife,
Judy, was killed in the crash. Lawry confirmed one death, but
withheld the victim's name pending notification of family members.
   Two other passengers, Stephanie Tyler, a campaign aide to Mrs.
Wagner, and Brian Krolicki, Seale's campaign manager, suffered less
severe injuries and were taken to a Fallon hospital, the sheriff
said.
   Mrs. Wagner and Seale were taken to Washoe Medical Center in
Reno. A hospital spokeswoman said the two were listed in serious
condition but the exact nature of their injuries wasn't immediately
known.
   Mrs. Wagner, 50, is a longtime state senator, and Seale, 48, is
a certified public accountant. Both are on Tuesday's primary
election ballot.
   Mrs. Wagner's late husband, Peter B. Wagner, was killed in a
1980 plane crash in northern California.
   Lawry said Krolicki managed to walk out about two miles to a
nearby ranch house to notify authorities of the crash about 1:15
p.m.

   Protesters demanding more parks
blocked traffic into this gambling center, delaying thousands of
Labor Day travelers on the casinos' busiest day of the year.
   Police arrested 23 black activists out of the approximately 250
who demonstrated on behalf of what they called ``the forgotten
youth of Atlantic City.'' Leaders of the group said they would
extend their protests through the week and disrupt the Miss America
Pageant, which has its finals televised live Saturday night.
   They called for more recreational sites and an end to alleged
police brutality. Negotiations broke off last week between the
group and Mayor Jim Whelan, a former teacher who says he wants to
work with them but refuses to be pressured by demonstrations.
   Police on motorcycles, in cars and a helicopter watched as the
demonstrators marched through the slums that abut the glittering
Boardwalk strip of casinos and hotels,
   Shortly before 1 p.m., the marchers blocked traffic coming into
town on the Atlantic City Expressway, forcing officers to
temporarily divert traffic to side streets.
   Eight of the marchers, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has
been active in black community protests in New York and elsewhere,
sat down.
   Twenty-three people, including Sharpton, were arrested, said
mayoral aide Lou Tuscano. Most of the arrests were for being
disorderly; one was for aggraved assault for throwing things at
officers.
   Sharpton and local group organizer Steve Young also were charged
with incitement to riot for allegedly telling others to cross
police barricades.

   Army commanders on Monday ordered troops to
halt their advance on the last stronghold occupied by armed Mohawks
as they tried to persuade the Indians to surrender.
   Earlier Monday, a shot was fired as soldiers moved through a
wooded area toward the Mohawk positions. Both Mohawk and army
representatives denied shooting.
   The incident took place as a nearly 2-month-old standoff wore
on, with troops surrounding about two dozen members of the militant
Mohawk Warrior's Society and 30 women and children holed up in a
drug and alcohol detoxification center on Indian land in the
Kahnesatake settlement.
   Mohawk warriors with rifles and automatic weapons manned
foxholes around the center, which was encircled by a tight cordon
of troops, armored vehicles and barbed wire.
   Lt. Gen. Kent Foster, commander for the Montreal region, told a
news conference Monday, ``The army's next move is to stay in place
and keep the perimeter closed (around the detoxification center).
There will be no more military movement. We will stay here until
this is over.''
   Foster said the army has a phone line open to the Mohawks in the
detoxification center.
   He said the commander on the scene, Brig. Gen. Armand Roy, was
negotiating with Terry Doxtater, a chief of the Six Nations
Iroquois Confederacy, in an effort to persuade the Indians to lay
down their arms.
   Doxtater described the situation as ``desperate.''
   ``The people of the Pines (the Kahnesatake Mohawks) are not
going to lay down their arms if the Canadian army moves in. This is
a decision made by the men and the women,'' he said. ``The army has
created an environment which they hope will trigger the all-out
bloody assault they seek.''
   Another Iroquois Confederacy chief, Bob Antone, said the
negotiations centered on creation of a native peacekeeping force to
replace the Quebec provincial police in Kahnesatake.
   The Indians have said they will not give up their weapons
without some guarantees of protection from police reprisals. They
fear the Quebec police might seek revenge for the death of a
policeman in a July 11 clash that triggered the Oka standoff.
   On Sunday, about 350 soldiers demolished the last barricades
blocking access to the Kahnesatake settlement and seized control of
most of it. The Mohawk militants were confined to a small wooded
area about the size of a football field around the detoxification
center.
   The Indians had erected the barricades at Kahnesatake and
another Mohawk community, Kahnawake, in a dispute over plans by Oka
town officials to expand a golf course onto what they claim is
tribal land.
   The barriers had blocked traffic on an Oka highway and, about 20
miles to the east, on the Mercier Bridge over the St. Lawrence
River connecting Montreal with its southern suburbs.
   In northern New York, Mohawks set up a roadblock Monday
afternoon on the international bridge between Canada and the United
States near Hogansburg.
   The Mohawks set up the roadblock on the Canadian side of the
bridge, but were persuaded to move by Canadian police after about
an hour, according to State Police in Massena, N.Y. Traffic was
impeded on the New York side, but was moving again by 1 p.m.
   At the Mercier Bridge near the Kahnawake Mohawk reserve south of
Montreal, Indian women and children staged a peaceful demonstration
to support the Oka natives.
   The army asked Quebec Transport Department employees working to
reopen the bridge to withdraw and moved three armored personnel
carriers onto the structure.
   Later, Quebec provincial police entered the Longhouse, a site of
traditional Mohawk government on the Kahnawake reserve. Army troops
helped cordon off the building, but did not enter, said an army
spokesman, Maj. Jean-Paul Macdonald.
   Mohawk leaders said several Indians were hit by rifle butts and
injured in scuffles with police who entered the Longhouse to
interrogate the 75 people inside, most of them women and children.
   Police and army officials denied the allegations.
   Meanwhile, Mohawks charged that a rock-throwing incident last
week contributed to the death of 65-year-old Mohawk Joe Armstrong.
Armstrong was in a convoy of Mohawks fleeing the Kahnawake reserve
who were pelted by stones thrown by angry local residents.
Armstrong died of a heart attack in a hospital early Sunday.
   Armstrong was not struck but was ``scared to death'', said
Kahnawake band counselor Hazel Lazare. He was, however, already a
``very sick man'' when his family decided to take him off the
reserve, she added.
   The army moved into the Kahnesatake Mohawk settlement on
Saturday afternoon after factional fighting broke out between
moderate and militant Mohawks.
   The dispute over the golf course expansion was solved when the
federal government purchased the land and said it would give it to
the Indians.
   But the Mohawks seized the situation to publicize a much wider
range of grievances, including demands for sovereignty.

   The nine victims, one of whom received a gunshot wound to the
face, were in stable condition at Park Place and St. Mary
hospitals, said Port Arthur Police Sgt. K.J. Landry.
   The shooting occurred shortly after 1:00 a.m. outside the Speak

The gunman, who remained at large Sunday night, possibly used an
assault rifle to spray the club, police said.

   Prince Charles, recovering from bone
surgery, got a get-well card from a sly 9-year-old and a visit from
Princess Diana.
   The heir to the British throne had a second operation on
Saturday to mend his right arm, which was broken in a polo match
two months ago.
   Princess Diana visited on Sunday and thanked another patient at
the hospital, 9-year-old Penny Hutchins, who slipped past security
guards and pushed a get-well card under the prince's door.
   Penny, who is being treated for a skin ailment, and other young
patients drew a teddy bear with an arm in a sling on the card,
which read, ``Get well soon, your Highness.''
   Doctors at Queen's Medical Center in Nottingham said the surgery
was a success and that the 41-year-old prince was in excellent
condition.
   He had a sore hip after surgeons removed bone slivers for
transplant into his arm during the three-hour operation. A six-inch
titanium plate also was screwed into the damaged bone.
   The fracture did not heal after the first operation on June 28,
the day he fell off his horse.

<HEAD>Movie About Cabbie and Jewish Musician Looks at Soviet Life</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pavel Lungin's movie ``Taxi Blues'' examines
Soviet life at a time when, in the opinion of many citizens, it
couldn't be worse.
   Into a daily mixture of ethnic unrest, shortages and a rising
crime, the Soviet director has dropped the story of the love-hate
relationship between a coarse Russian taxi driver and a drunken
Jewish jazz saxophonist.
   The two-hour commentary on the tensions between ethnic groups
and classes in what was supposed to be a classless society won
Lungin the best-director prize at the 1990 Cannes film festival.
   Only days after its premiere last week, the film became the
sensation of Moscow's fall season.
   It depicts the taxi driver's confusion, endemic to contemporary
Russians, when he realizes a way of life he has been taught was
superior is in reality backward.
   Like the acclaimed Soviet documentary ``This is Not the Way to
Live,'' about a crime-ridden society, ``Taxi Blues'' could not have
been shown before glasnost, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy
of openness.
   A leading Moscow theater was sold out for the three-day premiere.
   An important drawing card is Pyotr Mamonov, a Soviet rock star
who plays the musician. The master of ceremonies at the opening
described him as ``the idol of Soviet youth.''
   The predominantly young audience at the premiere seemed to
regard the film as upbeat, focusing on the ultimate success of the
Jewish jazzman rather than the frustrations of the Russian cab
driver.
   ``It's about our times, and how people are very different but
everyone lives together,'' said Lena, a 22-year-old in the October
Theater audience.
   The movie is to be released in France in September and the
United States in November.
   Veteran actor Pyotr Zaichenko plays the cab driver opposite
Mamonov.
   They meet when Mamonov's character, Lyosha, rides in the cab
driven by Zaichenko's character, Vanya Shlykov. After walking away
without paying, Lyosha becomes Shlykov's live-in slave to work off
the debt.
   As the story progresses, they grow to like and understand each
other, but the relationship eventually breaks down, first because
of Lyosha's success with Shlykov's girlfriend and later over his
success in the West.
   Both characters are self-destructive, but the similarities end
there.
   Lyosha is a free-wheeling individual with anti-establishment
views whose musical career collapsed because of alcohol. He engages
in such antics as drinking a bottle of cologne in the bathroom and
romping around naked.
   Shlykov seeks escape from life's miseries in body building and a
simple, stern philosophy revealed in his attempt to sober up
Lyosha: ``Break your back like every Russian fellow!''
   His crude behavior includes beating up teen-agers and drunks and
forcing his girlfriend to have sex with him on a windowsill.
   Another dark side of Shlykov is his bigotry. ``What, are you a
Jew?'' he says when he sees Lyosha drinking heavily, not believing
Jews have drinking problems.
   Lyosha rebels against Shlykov's attempts to sober him up through
hard labor and exercise, and retorts: ``You can't make an animal
out of me!'' and ``You're a goat!''
   The film explores prejudices and how difficult they make it for
a Soviet who works with his mind, like the musician, and one who
does physical labor, like the cab driver, from getting along with
each other.
   Vignettes show a Soviet society plagued by alcoholism,
anti-Semitism and moral decay.
   Most young people interviewed after seeing the movie sympathized
with the irresponsible musician rather than the hard-working taxi
driver.
   ``Shlykov is bitter,'' said Lalai, a 20-year-old student. ``He
doesn't understand that a musician can make money and that music is
a profession. He can only drive a cab.''
   Lalai's friend, Dima, noted that Lyosha, who tours the United
States, was like many Soviet cultural figures _ appreciated at home
only after his talent is recognized abroad.

<TEXT>
   Heavily armed Bedouins sit under a
tent guarding a building identified by a new sign outside as
housing offices of the Kuwaiti government-in-exile's Ministry of
Oil.
   This is the forward command post for the Kuwaiti resistance
movement. Its day-to-day operations include smuggling ammunition
and communications equipment into Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, Kuwaiti
exiles say.
   The Saudi-Kuwait border is just three miles to the north.
   ``All the operations to Kuwait come via Khafji,'' said a senior
Kuwaiti guerrilla leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity out
of fear of Iraqi reprisals.
   ``All communications, all orders, all border crossings ... You
saw the trucks, the aerials,'' he said.
   He said the resistance movement has already recruited thousands
of volunteers from among the estimated 70,000 Kuwaiti refugees in
Saudi Arabia.
   A senior Saudi official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Sunday that the Kuwaiti resistance is ``growing in strength''
and stepping up its attacks on the Iraqi occupiers.
   An Associated Press reporter visited the Kuwaiti resistance
headquarters last week. Over the weekend, the Saudi government
barred journalists from traveling to Khafji without an official
escort.
   The resistance and the Kuwaiti army, which has offices nearby,
remain loyal to the government-in-exile headed by Kuwait's emir,
Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah. The government is based in Taif, in
southwest Saudi Arabia.
   The red-green-white-and-black Kuwaiti flag flies outside the
building, which is also the new headquarters of the Kuwait branch
of the Arabian Oil Co., a concern Kuwaiti exiles say is jointly
owned by the Kuwaitis, Saudis and Japanese.
   That is somehow appropriate because Kuwait's oil wealth
guarantees that the resistance movement will not lack for funds.
Saudi officials estimate that the Kuwaiti government-in-exile has
access to assets worth about $100 billion.
   The Kuwaiti guerrilla leader said money is not a problem. ``What
we need is weapons,'' he said.
   Some arms have been obtained from Iraqi defectors, he said.
Others came from the arsenal of Kuwait's National Guard, which
Kuwaitis broke into a day after the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion.
   The guerrilla leader refused to provide details about U.S.
assistance to the Kuwaiti resistance, except to say that Americans
were involved in recruiting Kuwaiti refugees for training in Saudi
Arabia.
   Last week, several U.S. television networks reported that the
CIA and Army Special Forces troops were helping the Kuwaiti
resistance organize hit-and-run attacks on Iraqi occupiers.
   No Americans were involved in the fighting, but Kuwaiti fighters
based near the Saudi-Kuwait border were reported to be getting
intelligence, weapons, radios, advice on target selection and
instruction from U.S. advisers, the networks said.
   President Bush would not confirm directly that his
administration is supporting the Kuwaiti resistance. But, he said,
``In a broad way, I support the Kuwaiti underground. I support
anybody who can have a hand in restoring legitimacy there to Kuwait
and to getting the Iraqis out of Kuwait.''
   The Kuwaiti guerrilla organizer said the resistance is still in
its formative stages. It is headed by three Kuwaiti sheiks _ two
based in Khafji and one in Hafr Al-Batin to the west near King
Khalid Military City, a major Saudi military base, he said.
   In addition to coordinating attacks on Iraqi troops inside
Kuwait, the resistance runs a radio and television station.,
   Guerrillas have also managed to smuggle ammunition into Kuwait,
the guerrilla organizer said.
   He said _ and Saudi officials confirmed _ that Kuwaiti women are
playing an active role in the resistance. In one instance, he said,
a Kuwaiti woman threw a grenade at a group of Iraqi soldiers,
killing several before she was slain.
   The resistance is supported by a network of committees set up by
Kuwaiti exiles in Saudi Arabia.
   Anwar Al-Duaij, the head of a group assisting Kuwaiti refugees
in Khobar, 180 miles south of the border, said the military branch
of his organization was registering volunteers wishing to return to
Kuwait to fight the Iraqis. They are then sent north to infiltrate
into Kuwait.
   He said most of the volunteers did not require training since
most Kuwaiti men had served in the National Guard and were familiar
with weapons.
   ``Every day we hear of 70 Iraqi soldiers being killed by the
resistance. This is correct, this is not an exaggeration,''
Al-Duaij said.
   His figures could not be independently verified.

   Oh, to be chumming on Lake
Chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg.
   By the time you've pronounced it, you've probably hooked a bass
in this popular fishing spot in southern Massachusetts, which
boasts the longest name in the United States. Also known as Lake
Webster, its Indian name means, ``I fish on my side, you fish on
your side and nobody fishes in the middle.''
   The lake is among dozens of geographic oddities celebrated in a
new Library of Congress exhibition titled ``A World of Names,''
which opens Thursday through Jan. 15.
   The show marks the 100th anniversary of the U.S. Board on
Geographic Names, the federal authority that has officially
recognized nearly 7 million foreign and domestic names for use in
government maps and publications.
   If you're an optimist, you'll feel at home in Top of the World,
N.M., or Carefree, Ariz. If you're a pessimist, you might be more
comfortable in Lowpoint, Ill., or Droop, W.Va.
   The romantically inclined will enjoy an odyssey through Venus,
Texas, and Romeo, Mich., followed by Ogle, Ky.; Valentine, Neb.;
Kissimmee, Fla.; Romance, Ark.; Bridal Veil, Ore., and Blissville,
Vt.
   When Christmas comes, you'll find a holiday mood in 836 places
across America with ``Bethlehem'' in their names. There are a dozen
places named ``holly'' in Maryland, a town called Santa Claus in
Georgia and an Oregon stream called Donner and Blitzen.
   There's a Yankeetown and a Crackertown in Florida, towns called
Laurel and Hardy in Iowa, Burns and Allen in Michigan, Carpenter
and Hammer in South Dakota, and Narrows and Tight Squeeze in
Virginia. Not to mention Ding Dong, Texas.
   If you have a taste for the unusual, by the way, Texas is your
place. There you'll find towns called Loco, Faker, Bug Tussle, Cut
and Shoot, Noodle, Tarzan, Dime Box, Turkey and Jot 'Em Down.
   Ronald Grim, an official of the geography and map division of
the Library of Congress and curator of the exhibition, said the
rich diversity of America's geographic names tells much about the
country's history and cultural origins from Indians through French,
Spanish and English settlers.
   Some names, like the border towns of Calexico, Calif., and
Mexicali, Mexico, are artificial. Some, like Rome, Canton and
Stockholm, N.Y., are borrowed from the great cities of Europe and
Asia. Many towns were named by postmasters after their wives,
daughters or girlfriends.
   Explorer John Wesley Powell named the mesas and buttes of the
Grand Canyon for ancient gods and spiritual leaders: Buddha,
Zoroaster, Wotan, Isis and Vulcan. The contours of the Rocky
Mountains range in northwest Wyoming reminded French explorers of
the female anatomy, so they were named the Grand Tetons after the
French for ``big breasts.''
   Local pride sometimes prompted name changes. Hog Heaven
eventually became Moscow, Idaho, after the fabled Soviet capital,
and Mole Hill became Mountain, W.Va. In the mountains of
southeastern Oregon is ``Whorehouse Meadow,'' named for frontier
prostitutes who solicited shepherds. A prudish federal bureaucrat
changed its name to ``Naughty Girl Meadow,'' but local residents
succeeded in reverting to the original name for historical reasons.
   For amnesiacs, there is Nameless, Texas.
   Grim said the local postmaster, exasperated by residents'
bickering over what to name their new crossroads community, wrote
authorities in Washington a letter declaring ``Let the place be
nameless and be damned.'' The Post Office dutifully obliged.

   Bursting from behind a clump of
shrubs, a white Chevy pickup roars into the open and drives in
frantic, dust-raising circles. Two truckloads of soldiers chase
behind, their M-16s cracking in the desert air.
   Finally, the driver jumps from the pickup and tries to flee on
foot. But the long skirt of his Arab dishdasha makes it easy for an
officer to grab him.
   Saudi officials staged this episode Sunday for visiting
television crews. The idea was to show how Saudi Arabia's frontier
force catches smugglers and illegal aliens along the country's
1,600 miles of coastline and 1,200 miles of land frontier, most of
it open desert.
   In normal times, the frontier force spends considerable effort
tracking smugglers of alcohol, illegal in this orthodox Moslem
kingdom.
   But these are not normal times. In addition to watching for
smugglers of contraband, the frontier force is preparing for war.
   Its units are the farthest north of any Saudi forces, ahead of
the Saudi army and ``right on the Iraqi border,'' an officer said.
U.S. troops are further to the south.
   Although any move by Iraqi troops toward the border would
probably be detected first by radar and other high-tech systems
operated by the U.S. military, the frontier patrols have their own
orders should they encounter any sign of trouble: send the alarm
and get out of the way.
   ``We are the first line. We are the human early warning
system,'' said a frontier force officer, who requested anonymity.
   He said that in the first days after the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait, Saudi border guards could see the Iraqis on the other
side of the line. ``But they have pulled back and we can't see them
now,'' he said.
   The frontier force is stretched thin. Of its 25,000 members,
about 3,000 are assigned to the border in the crisis zone south of
Iraq and Kuwait _ about two per mile, according to Gen. Mojab
Al-Qahtani, who commands the force.
   At sea, the frontier force is using most of its 16 aging
hovercraft to patrol the coastlines and watch for saboteurs or
other unusual activity.
   In one notable incident earlier this year, sea patrols caught a
Greek-flagged freighter anchored offshore which was operating as a
floating liquor store for small boats running the contraband to
shore.
   Alcohol confiscated by the frontier force is destroyed under the
supervision of officials of the force, Saudi customs officers and
the Muttawa, the officially designated Islamic religious police.

   Labor Day weekend 1990. A time to spend
with family and friends, maybe go to beach. Or maybe a time to
march in the blazing sun wearing your M17A2 gas mask and
charcoal-lined chemical warfare suit.
   Then, if there's time before dinner, you can practice what to do
in case of nuclear attack.
   So goes the holiday weekend for the 265th Quartermaster
Detachment, 14 South Carolina guardsmen training for deployment to
the Persian Gulf.
   The water purification unit was placed on active duty a week
ago. The men, all from the small community of Allendale, S.C., have
been at Fort Stewart since Thursday, brushing up on survival skills.
   They did not take the holiday off. They jogged before dawn to
prepare civilian bodies for possible military action overseas. They
devoted part of the afternoon to throwing themselves on the ground
in the prescribed method of surviving a nuclear explosion.
   Most of the day was spent outside the barracks in 90-degree
heat, practicing how to survive chemical warfare.
   Over and over, a timekeeper would shout, ``Gas!'' and the men,
in the posture of Old West gunfighters, clawed at the gas mask bags
hanging on their hips, trying to get them over their heads before
nine seconds passed and the timekeeper yelled ``Stop!''
   The unit would freeze and Sgt. Bill Bostick, a Vietnam veteran,
would inspect each man and declare him either dead or alive.
   As crows called from the high pines, the unit struggled into
heavy, olive drab chemical warfare jackets and pants, then the
thick black rubber gloves and overboots that keep out dangerous
chemicals but keep in all body heat.
   The unit marched in single file past the rows of cinder block
barracks where other reservists sat listening to rap music. After
the walk, sweat dripped steadily from the bottom of their masks. It
poured from the gloves when the men pulled them off.
   ``(If) we have to spend too much time in these suits over there
where it's 120 degrees, there's going to be a lot of dead boys from
Allendale,'' Spc. Edward Simmons, a lumber truck driver, said
good-naturedly.
   ``Make him put back on that mask to keep him quiet!'' snapped
Spc. Ulysses Calhoun.
   Later in the day, there is time for basketball.
   Simmons and Calhoun lead a team of younger men facing an older
squad that includes unit leader Sgt. Ronnie Jackson, a stocky
39-year-old probation officer who referees high school basketball
games.
   The younger team wins.
   ``Hey, reporter,'' Simmons called to the lone observer of the
victory. ``You tell them we beat the sergeant.''

   While the Middle East crisis will occupy
center stage when President Bush meets with Mikhail Gorbachev next
Sunday, the Soviet leader certainly could be forgiven if he also
tries to steer the conversation around to his own economy's
desperate situation.
   Gorbachev has been struggling with a myriad of economic problems
in recent weeks ranging from a continued shortage of consumer goods
on store shelves to wrangling among competing economic commissions
over just how fast the Soviet economy should move to a free-market
system.
   Gorbachev is appealing for massive financial aid to turn the
situation around, but the United States and many of its allies are
demanding a look at the Soviet balance sheets before they commit to
any major assistance programs.
   Many analysts believe those studies, especially one being
conducted by the International Monetary Fund, could prove critical
in determining the fate of Gorbachev's faltering economic reforms.
   In announcing the hastily scheduled summit in Helsinki, Finland,
the White House on Saturday said it would focus primarily on the
Middle East. But Bush said the discussions would not be limited to
that area.
   Whatever the agenda, the summit will allow Gorbachev to turn
briefly to statesmanship and away from his economic problems.
   At the last meeting between the two leaders, May 30-June 3 in
Washington, Gorbachev stressed the need for Western aid to insure
the success of his efforts to rescue the faltering Soviet economy.
   Bush, however, has remained opposed to direct Soviet aid, and
even the U.S.-Soviet trade agreement which the two leaders did sign
remains stalled, awaiting passage in the Soviet parliament of
legislation to ensure free emigration.
   The impasse is occurring as the Soviet economy continues in a
steep nose dive. The total output of goods and services actually
shrank during the first six months of the year, while the country's
trade deficit has more than doubled and both unemployment and
inflation are up sharply.
   ``The Soviet economy is disintegrating,'' said Marshall Goldman,
the associate director of Harvard's Russian Research Center.
``Everybody is standing around watching Moscow burn, but nobody
knows what to do about it.''
   Gorbachev's appeals for Western aid will be considered this
month when the IMF and its sister organization, the World Bank,
hold their annual meetings in Washington on Sept. 20-27.
   No decisions on those appeals are expected from the meetings.
But finance ministers from the 152 nations that make up the two
organizations will discuss the IMF-led study, which was ordered by
President Bush and other Western leaders this summer at the
economic summit of leading industrial nations in Houston.
   The study was a compromise between demands by the French and
West Germans for an immediate $15-billion aid package and
resistance to direct economic aid by Bush and other summit leaders.
It is scheduled to be completed in December.
   The International Monetary Fund generally is viewed as the top
cop of international finance. Its clout stems not just from the
loans it hands out, but also from the fact that other lenders take
their cue from the fund.
   If, for example, the IMF does not approve of a nation's plans to
get its economic house in order, that nation has a hard time
getting credit.
   But IMF austerity programs have in the past triggered bloody
riots in Third World nations unhappy with the prescription to curb
runaway inflation.
   Whether the Soviet Union, with its long history of distrust of
Western capitalism, will readily accept IMF dictates remains to be
seen.
   The study team faces other formidable obstacles.
   There is the question of how to measure the Soviet economy,
which operates with a currency that is not convertible into other
foreign currencies.
   While the Central Intelligence Agency estimates that the Soviet
economy was roughly 51 percent the size of America's $4.2 trillion
economy in 1989, other experts have attacked those figures as
grossly inflated and suggested that the total output of Soviet
goods and services is really only one-third that of America's gross
national product.
   The IMF study may resolve this debate, since one of its main
jobs will be to conduct an exhaustive look at a host of economic
statistics. These include Soviet gross national product, trade
statistics and the amount of hard currency on hand to pay for
shortfalls between what the country sells overseas and what it
imports.
   For decades, the Soviet Union was considered a good
international credit risk because the government always promptly
paid its import bills. But because of a widening trade gap, the
Soviets have fallen behind on their payments and are seeking trade
credits from other nations.
   West Germany already has agreed to $3 billion of such credits
and other European nations are expected to follow suit.
   The Bush administration, however, has so far rejected proposals
for direct financial aid, and instead offered technical assistance,
including advice on improving the collapsing food distribution
system or how to establish private banking.
   But many experts believe that the Soviet problems are so severe
they can be resolved only by a major overhaul of the economy and
massive economic support from the West.
   ``The Soviets face fundamental economic problems that are not
amenable to quick fixes,'' said Jeffrey Schott, an expert at the
Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based research
organization. ``The question of restructuring their entire economy
and their distribution system will take quite a number of years to
accomplish.''

<HEAD>Countdown Begins Again for Columbia</HEAD>

   The countdown began today for NASA's
third attempt to launch Columbia with the Astro observatory after
engineers solved the latest problem to befall the mission.
   Liftoff is scheduled for 1:20 a.m. EDT Thursday. It will be the
first shuttle launch in more than four months _ the longest gap
between missions since flights resumed following the 1986
Challenger disaster.
   ``It's been a long, hot summer, and we're just glad to be
getting back into the flight business,'' said NASA spokesman Dick
Young. The shuttle fleet had been temporarily grounded after
hydrogen leaks were discovered on two of the three orbiters,
including Columbia.
   NASA decided on a Thursday launch after re-establishing full
contact with the X-ray telescope inside Columbia's cargo bay. The
telescope is one of four that constitute the $150 million Astro
observatory.
   Contact between the instrument and launch control computers was
lost Wednesday night after the cargo bay doors were closed, and
NASA scrubbed Saturday's launch attempt.
   Workers installed a new electronic component for the telescope
inside the cargo bay and finished testing it Sunday.
   Engineers also had trouble verifying the telescope's ability to
send signals over a radio link that would be used during the
flight. The problem was caused by faulty software and was corrected
Sunday, Young said.
   Columbia's liftoff would have been delayed until at least Friday
if the problem had not been solved by midnight Sunday, Young said.
That's when workers planned to begin freezing the argon used to
keep the X-ray telescope's instruments cold.
   Columbia was supposed to have gone up May 30, but hydrogen
leaked during fueling and NASA called off the launch. Atlantis was
the next shuttle scheduled to fly, but its classified Pentagon
mission was delayed from July to November when it, too, was found
to have hydrogen leaks.
   Columbia returned to the launch pad in August with new hydrogen
lines.
   NASA has not sent up a shuttle since April, when Discovery
carried the flawed Hubble Space Telescope into orbit.
   Columbia has a crew of seven astronauts, the largest since
Challenger.
   Four of the crew members are astronomers who will work in
non-stop shifts to operate Astro's three ultraviolet telescopes
during the nine- to 10-day mission. Astro will return to Earth with
the shuttle and might be used again on a later flight.
   Astro is designed to observe some of the hottest objects in the
universe, including a comet and a supernova. It will be the first
shuttle mission in five years dedicated entirely to scientific
research.

   Saddam Hussein has a fleet of more than
150 transport aircraft, including airliners plundered from Kuwait,
that could be used to beat the United Nations-ordered embargo on
trade with Iraq.
   But aviation experts stress that any attempt at airborne
blockade-busting is fraught with difficulties and dangers, for both
sides.
   They note, too, that an airlift would likely be little more than
a gesture of defiance because it could never carry enough supplies
to feed Iraq's 17 million people or enough military materiel to
make a serious difference in Saddam's confrontation with the West.
   ``The sheer amount of cargo that would be needed to resupply a
whole country by air is mind-boggling,'' said Don Kerr of London's
International Institute for Strategic Studies.
   ``You only need to look at the U.S. airlift into Saudi Arabia to
get some idea of the logistics and equipment involved _ and the
Iraqis have nothing to compare with that,'' Kerr said in a
telephone interview.
   During the Berlin Airlift in 1948-49, the United States and its
allies flew more than 277,000 missions to haul nearly 2 million
tons of food, coal and other life-saving provisions into West
Berlin after the Soviets cut it off.
   At the peak of the 15-month operation, the allied air forces
were flying 1,200 missions a day that carried 13,000 tons of
supplies.
   The State Department reported last week that Iraq ``may
increasingly rely on air transport'' as a means of avoiding the
tightening naval embargo spearheaded by the U.S. Navy.
   The Washington Post reported Saturday that North Korea and Cuba
have been flying military-related materiel into Iraq.
   But Britain's Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said Sunday that
these flights are ``not a major problem at the moment ... One of
the calculations is that Saddam will run out of money to pay for
such air shipments because the oil trade will be blocked.''
   Kerr and other experts say Iraq may be able to maintain an
aerial lifeline, providing U.S. and other members of the
multinational force enforcing the U.N.-ordered embargo do not
decide to begin shooting down transport planes.
   U.S. and other warships have U.N. permission to use ``minimal
force'' to prevent ships supplying Iraq. That could be done without
causing casualties by shooting off the rudders of blockade-running
ships.
   But it's a different matter in the air.
   ``What do you do if you challenge an aircraft and it doesn't
turn away?'' said Kerr. ``The only alternative is to shoot it down
and that could cause an outcry with all kinds of moral and
political ramifications.''
   It is not clear whether U.N. rules of engagement for enforcing
the embargo permit firing on aircraft flying into Iraq.
   But Hurd said the British and others are ``considering how one
would set about'' blocking the flying embargo-busters.
   Iraq's state-run airline, Iraqi Airways, and Arab Air Cargo, a
freight line operated with neighboring Jordan, have more than 70
aircraft between them.
   These include Boeing 747 jumbo jets that can carry more than 100
tons and Soviet-built Antonov An-24 transports with payloads of
more than 80 tons.
   The Iraqi air force has 82 transport aircraft, including An-24s
and Ilyushin IL-76s. Each is capable of carrying 45 tons of freight
but many would probably be needed for military movements and might
not be available.
   Kuwaiti sources in the Persian Gulf say the Iraqis seized at
least 15 of Kuwait Airways' 21 airliners in the Aug. 2 invasion,
flying them to Iraq.
   In theory, Iraq has the capacity to fly in hundreds of tons of
cargo a day, provided it has friendly countries willing to provide
airfields and to covertly ship in supplies for Baghdad.
   Jordan is a close ally of Iraq and has said it will abide by the
U.N. sanctions. But the Jordanians, who depend heavily on trade
with Iraq, are quibbling about compensation before they lower the
boom.
   Yemen, another country with strong links to Baghdad, has said it
also will adhere to the sanctions. But Western officials suspect it
might be a conduit.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi declared Saturday that Tripoli
will also comply with U.N. efforts to block oil exports from Iraq
and occupied Kuwait. But he stressed that ``it is impossible for us
in the end to take part in starving ... people'' in Iraq.
   But Iraq is ringed by Syria, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran,
which if not downright hostile are not disposed to allow Iraq-bound
planes to fly through their airspace.
   Only Jordan to the west could provide an avenue for a Baghdad
airlift _ but would in doing so risk international reprisals.

<HEAD>Authors Divided on Killer in Quirky Mystery Series `Twin Peaks'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RADNOR, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four best-selling authors questioned by TV
Guide couldn't agree on who killed Laura Palmer in ABC's ``Twin
Peaks,'' but say the series better solve the crime in a hurry.
   Jackie Collins, Andrew M. Greeley, Tony Hillerman and Iris
Ranier Dart, were asked to pick the most likely villain of the
quirky show, directed by David Lynch and set in a sleepy logging
town in the Pacific Northwest.
   Their answers appear in the Sept. 8 issue of the magazine.
   The show that received 14 Emmy nominations began with the murder
of homecoming queen Laura Palmer and subsequent shows revolve
around the investigation of her death, with a dizzying number of
plot twists and turns.
   It offers an eclectic mix of characters ranging from FBI Agent
Cooper, a straight-laced law enforcement type who loves cherry pie,
to the Log Lady, a woman who walks around town carrying a log.
   Greeley, the author of the 1990 best seller ``The Cardinal
Virtues,'' believes the killer is Dr. Lawrence Jacoby, a
psychiatrist.
   ``Laura was driving Jacoby crazy,'' Greeley said. ``He was
attracted by her innocence and by her evil.''
   Ms. Collins, author of 12 best sellers that have sold 100
million copies, concluded the killer was Sheriff Truman's deputy,
Andy, ``because he appears to be the least likely.''
   Cooper was shot in the last episode of the past season, but Ms.
Collins said he has to survive.
   ``He's the whole show,'' she said. ``It's obvious he wears a
bulletproof vest because he needs one to hold in his stomach.''
   Hillerman, author of ``Coyote Waits,'' a current best seller,
believes the killer will turn out to be Leland Palmer, the victim's
father.
   ``It's possible that he could have bumped her off in a rage
after he found out she was working at One-Eyed Jacks (a
brothel-casino),'' he said.
   But Hillerman complained that he wasn't sure the show's writers
have even decided who the killer is.
   ``By normal standards the series is sloppy and inconsistent,''
he said. ```Twin Peaks' sets things up and then does nothing with
them.''
   Ms. Dart, whose best seller ``Beaches'' was made into a feature
film starring Bette Midler, came up with the idea that Laura was
the killer and not the victim.
   The victim, she believes, is really Madeleine, Laura's cousin.
   ``Laura wanted to come back as Madeleine so she could start
afresh and escape her tainted past,'' Ms. Dart theorized.
   Greeley, Ms. Collins and Hillerman all said the mystery has to
be wrapped up in the first episode of the fall season, a two-hour
show scheduled for Sept. 30.
   ``It's not going to be popular with a mass audience unless they
start coming up with answers,'' Ms. Collins said. ``But they should
find another murder victim when the killer is identified _ just to
raise some doubt.''

   Diplomatic exchanges between Iraq and Britain are
getting a touch personal.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has called President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq ``a person who has taken hostages, cruelly,
brutally, and a person who has hidden behind the skirts of women
and children.''
   ``This man is a loser,'' she added in an interview broadcast
Sunday on Britain's TV-AM network.
   The Iraqi News Agency fired back: ``The old hag Thatcher seems
to have been upset by the permission given women and children to
leave Iraq, as she had wanted to make an issue of them in her
electoral campaign.''
   ``Thatcher would do well to bear in mind that the empire on
whose possessions the sun did not go down has long been defunct,
and neither she nor any of her allies will be able to set the clock
back,'' it said.
   It referred to ``Thatcher's canine, harsh voice'' and ``empty
bluster.''
   The state newspaper al-Iraq called her a ``circus buffoon who is
dancing on American ropes ... vomiting poison like a spotted
serpent,'' waging an ``imperialist- Zionist-colonialist-reactionary
aggression against Iraq.''
   ``Thatcher, the frenzied and corrupt lady, does not frighten the
glorious Iraqi knights,'' al-Iraq editorialized.
   In London, interviewer David Frost asked Mrs. Thatcher whether
she thought Saddam was mad.
   ``Calculating, not mad,'' she replied. ``Fanatical in that his
personal ambitions must come before everything and everyone else.
And he has no regard for human life or liberty or justice.''

   The storm, which struck Friday, killed three people in Shanghai,
which just two weeks ago was suffering from a heat wave, the China

   Previous reports have said 48 people were killed in coastal
Zhejiang province by Abe, the sixth major storm to batter China's
southeastern coast this summer and the worst typhoon to hit
Zhejiang in 34 years.
   Heavy rainfall flooded most of urban Shanghai during the
weekend. One district registered 8.2 inches of rainfall in one day,
China Daily said.

<TEXT>
   Joseph Doherty, a folk hero in the
Irish-American community who has a Manhattan street named for him,
could soon be free on bail after seven years behind bars _ and in
legal limbo.
   Doherty's allegiance to the Irish Republican Army and its
control over his decision-making is the focus of a bail hearing
Tuesday. It was called by U.S. District Judge Miriam G. Cedarbaum,
who is considering a bail request for Doherty while he pursues
political asylum in the United States.
   ``She wants to know what his relationship is, if any, and if
he's still a member (of the IRA) and would he follow their orders
in violation of a bond if it were to be set,'' said Doherty's
attorney, Stephen A. Sommerstein.
   Doherty, 35, has been imprisoned in a Manhattan jail since his
1983 arrest in New York. He faces a life sentence in the United
Kingdom for the 1980 slaying of a British officer, and prison
escape.
   He won a series of court battles in the United States to avoid
extradition, some of which were later reversed by the Justice
Department.
   Doherty has acknowledged that the British officer was killed in
a gunfight between troops and Doherty's four-man IRA unit, but
claims the fighting was political.
   His lawyers argue he should be freed on bail, claiming his right
to due process has been violated by his lengthy imprisonment.
   ``The Constitution just doesn't permit indefinite imprisonment
under these circumstances,'' Sommerstein said.
   The U.S. government opposes Doherty's release. Assistant U.S.
Attorney Claude A. Millman argues the government can detain an
alien who entered the country illegally, as a convict.
   ``Given the government's substantial interest in assuring
Doherty's availability for deportation ... it simply cannot be said
that Doherty's detention has any constitutional dimension,''
Millman said in court papers.
   ``Unquestionably, Doherty's deportation case is of extraordinary
importance to our foreign relations,'' he said.
   Sommerstein has proposed a bail package that would allow
Doherty's release on a $100,000 bond posted by former City Council
President Paul O'Dwyer.
   The attorney also has arranged a $35,000-a-year job for Doherty
at a Long Island factory. Sommerstein said other supporters have
offered to post money and their homes to insure that Doherty won't
flee.
   In an effort to establish ties to the community, Sommerstein
described in court papers the wide support Doherty has received
from politicians, religious leaders and Irish-American
organizations.
   He said Doherty had received visits in jail from numerous
senators and congressmen, Roman Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor,
the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the Rev. Lawrence Jenco, a former
hostage in Lebanon.
   Doherty also has been designated honorary grand marshal at St.
Patrick's Day parades across the country. New York City gave his
name to a street near the jail where he is housed.
   ``I've never seen a group of people so incensed at what has
happened,'' O'Dwyer, an attorney, said of the Irish-American
community. ``The Constitution is violated in letter and in spirit.''
   Doherty fled to New York in 1982 after more than a year on the
run in Ireland. He was arrested by the FBI in 1983, and the British
government requested his extradition.
   Earlier this summer, Doherty won his latest legal victory when a
federal appeals court ruled that he is entitled to seek political
asylum in the United States.
   The U.S. government is appealing the decision, which said U.S.
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh was improperly influenced by
political concerns when he denied Doherty the chance to show he
would be persecuted if returned to the United Kingdom.
   Doherty last was questioned about his loyalty to the IRA at a
hearing in 1984. He indicated he still took orders from the IRA.
The judge then barred his extradition, ruling that the British
officer's killing was an act related to IRA's political goal of a
unified Ireland.
   When asked to characterize Doherty's mood going into the
upcoming hearing, Sommerstein said, ``Joe's got no fears stating
his position.''

   About 3,000 counter-demonstrators succeeded in
forcing the Ku Klux Klan to call off its planned march through the
capital, but Klansmen are vowing to return next Labor Day.
   But robed and hooded members of the Mount Holly, N.C.-based
Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan still held a brief rally on
the U.S. Capitol steps Sunday as a mob, held several blocks away by
police, shouted protests.
   Police escorted about 46 members of the white supremacist group
to the Capitol while a crowd estimated by police at 3,000 attempted
to move into the area.
   Officials said the klansmen called off their planned march after
learning that counter demonstrators were blocking the route.
   ``Officials conferred with the Klan and they were advised ...
anti-Klan protesters were blocking the roadway and it would be
difficult, if not impossible, for the Klan to march through
there,'' District of Columbia police spokeswoman Shannon Crockett
said.
   A Klan leader promised his group would return.
   ``We are coming back,'' Christian Knights Grand Dragon Horace
King said.
   An unidentified klansman said, ``We'll be back next year with
more. We'll be coming every Labor Day.''
   Police officers wearing helmets and carrying nightsticks, riot
shields and gas masks held the anti-Klan protesters about three
blocks from the Capitol grounds. Tin cans and rocks were thrown
from the surging throng.
   Police said three people were charged with disorderly conduct
and a juvenile was charged with inciting to riot after an incident
that sent one anti-Klan protester to the hospital with head
injuries even before the march was to kick off.
   Crockett said four police officers and four other persons were
treated for injuries, five of them at local hospitals.
   She said an undercover D.C. police officer was injured when a
rushing crowd trampled her, an officer was hurt when he was hit by
a rock, knocking him to the ground, and two other officers were
treated at the scene after sustaining minor injuries.
   Law enforcement officials said about 3,000 anti-Klan
demonstrators were in the area, but the All People's Congress, one
of the counter demonstration organizers, said it counted nearly
10,000 people.
   About 5,500 anti-Klan protesters took to the streets for a Nov.
27, 1982 Washington march by a different branch of the Klan.
Looting and violence followed that Klan appearance and police fired
tear gas in an attempt to break up crowds of counter demonstrators.
In the ensuing confrontation, 11 D.C. police officers were injured
and 38 persons were arrested on a variety of charges.
   Officials abruptly sealed off all access to the Capitol grounds
when it appeared the crowd would surge toward the building, said
U.S. Capitol Police spokesman Dan Nichols.
   Police declined to reveal the number of officers on duty.
   Meanwhile, the permit for the anti-Klan demonstration on the
Capitol grounds was revoked after the protesters arrived en masse,
in violation of the terms of the agreement, Nichols said.
   Among those attending the counter demonstration at the
Washington Monument were Effi Barry, wife of Mayor Marion Barry,
and their son Christopher.
   Mrs. Barry said Christopher was concerned about the Klan rally
and wanted to express his First Amendment rights.
   About 200 Klan members rallied in northeast Georgia on Saturday,
and a SWAT team broke up a small Klan rally in Louisiana.
   D.C. Police Chief Isaac Fulwood said city residents didn't want
the Klan to march and won.
   At one point, as authorities were attempting to break up the
demonstrators, Fulwood spoke to a group to explain what had
happened.
   A demonstrator, Matthew Pringle, told Fulwood ``They will never
march here _ not in my time.''
   Fulwood pointed to Pringle and said, ``Listen to the man, this
is why the Klan did not march.''

   As a young Chicago architect in 1902,
Frank Lloyd Wright got a dream job: build a house with no limit on
cost or creativity.
   Wright spent two years and $60,000, planning every detail from
walls to chairs. Now, nearly nine decades later, the state has
spent three years and $5 million restoring the vision of the man
who became America's most famous architect.
   The result goes on display Friday when the house Wright designed
for a wealthy widow opens to the public for the first time since
1987.
   ``This building is probably the most perfectly preserved of his
early buildings,'' said site manager Donald Hallmark. ``Literally,
almost everything he designed for it is still here.''
   The Dana-Thomas House _ named for its owners _ was one of
Wright's first large homes, said Wright expert Elaine Harrington,
curator at the Wright Home and Studio Foundation in Oak Park.
   By 1902, the architect was growing in prominence, but most of
his work was still small homes in Chicago suburbs.
   The building is an example of the ``prairie'' style of
architecture, which emphasizes horizontal lines and an open,
flowing floor plan. The two-story home looks vaguely like pagodas
joined by a low walkway. Copper-green rain gutters form a prominent
border to the sloping roof. A green plaster frieze runs near the
top of the walls, linking the roof to the pale brick below.
   Inside, low, dim rooms will suddenly give way to high ceilings
and shafts of sunlight. Rooms seem connected at random, with open
spaces here and sudden turns there.
   Hallmark said architects usually have limited control over a
home's furniture and decorations, but Wright designed everything,
like a composer writing music.
   ``It is a long symphony,'' Hallmark said. ``It is probably the
greatest symphonic collection of decorative art objects that you're
ever going to find from the early 20th century.''
   That collection of Wright lamps, stained-glass windows and
furniture makes the Dana-Thomas House stand out, experts say.
   ``Not all buildings are allowed to survive with all that
intact,'' Harrington said. ``If you're going to explain the work,
you need as much of that stuff as you can possibly afford.''
   Gov. James R. Thompson was a a chief supporter of the
restoration. The project spent $704,000 in privately raised money
to buy a lamp Wright designed for the house. The furniture is so
valuable that its location was kept secret while it was being
restored.
   Wright built the house for widow Sarah Lawrence Dana to hold
lavish parties. Poet Carl Sandburg sometimes read his work there,
and Dana once held a reception for conductor John Philip Sousa. She
threw frequent parties _ one with 1,000 guests.
   Eventually, Dana was hit with financial and health problems. The
Thomas Publishing Co. bought the house in 1944, using it as office
space but also taking care to preserve the building as Wright had
designed it. The house was sold to the state in 1981 for $1
million, a fraction of its value, Hallmark said.

<HEAD>Slim Prospects for Big Power Shift in 1990 Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans and Democratic challengers claim
they are on their way to upsetting senior senators, but the
prospects are slim that the 1990 elections will alter Washington's
balance of power.
   Barring an extraordinary political upheaval on Nov. 6, President
Bush will spend at least two more years dealing with a Congress
controlled by the opposition Democrats.
   Familiar faces may disappear, however. Democrats say this is the
year they can defeat Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. Republicans have high
hopes of unseating Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.
   Major changes are certain to occur in state capitals where 13
governors are retiring, including those in California, Texas,
Illinois and Ohio.
   When the dust settles in November, the most significant result
of the 1990 elections is likely to be which party won the political
control in key states to redraw congressional and state legislative
district lines to conform to the 1990 census.
   According to preliminary Census figures, population trends will
require shifting 19 House seats before the 1992 elections. Most of
the seats will move South and West with California picking up
seven, Florida four, and Texas three. New York will likely give up
three seats, and Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio will
probably give up two apiece.
   The political importance of controlling the redistricting
process has made the race to succeed Republican George Deukmejian
as governor of California the most important race of the year.
   Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican Pete Wilson are
spending millions of dollars to blanket California with television
appeals for support.
   The Democrats already control the California legislature. If
Feinstein is elected governor, the Republicans will have little
voice when lines are drawn for the state's seven new U.S. House
seats. A victory by Wilson would force the two parties to come up
with a compromise plan.
   Florida faces a similar situation, in which former Sen. Lawton
Chiles and Rep. Bill Nelson are competing for the Democratic
nomination to challenge Gov. Bob Martinez, rated by Democrats as
one of the most vulnerable Republican incumbents.
   One of the most closely watched Senate races is in North
Carolina, where former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt is running
neck-and-neck with Helms, the Republican conservative icon whose
latest crusade has been an attack against federal grants for art
work he deems obscene. So far, Gantt, who is black, has surprised
observers by the amount of support he has attracted in opinion
polls.
   All told, the 1990 numbers look like this:
   _ 35 Senate seats are up for grabs, 18 now held by Republicans
and 17 by Democrats. The Democrats now control the Senate by a
55-45 margin. The Republicans are given a good chance to narrow
that margin, but are considered very unlikely to regain the
majority they lost in 1986.
   _ The entire House faces re-election and the current Democratic
majority of 257 to 176 isn't expected to change much. Two seats are
now vacant.
   _ 36 states will elect governors. Twenty of those now have
Democratic governors, 16 Republicans. Nationwide, 29 states have
Democratic governors and 21 have Republicans. Eight Democrats and
five Republicans are not seeking re-election.
   _ Voters also will fill 6,262 state legislative seats and elect
hundreds of mayors, including a successor to Marion Barry, the
embattled mayor of the nation's capital. Awaiting sentencing on a
misdemeanor cocaine possession charge, Barry is running as an
independent for a seat on the District of Columbia City Council.
   All these campaigns are getting into high gear while the
public's attention is riveted on the Persian Gulf and the buildup
of American forces following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Pollsters and politicians agree there is no way of assessing
what impact the Middle East crisis will have on the November
elections. At the same time, they also agree that the threat of a
desert war is making it tougher than usual for candidates to get
the voters' attention.
   ``Iraq knocked everything off the radar screen,'' said Ed
Rollins, co-chairman of the House Republican campaign committee.
   ``I don't know where it goes from here,'' he conceded. Before
the Iraqi invasion, Rollins said he hoped Republicans would benefit
from ``an anti-incumbent mood that was starting to build,'' and was
being fed by public unhappiness over the political ties between
members of Congress and operators of savings and loan institutions.
   ``It's awful hard to talk about savings and loans when you're on
the verge of war,'' he said.
   Whether voters are listening or not, candidates are raising
other issues.
   Abortion, a major issue in the handful of races last year, is a
big concern throughout he country with politicians in both parties
scrambling to get on what they consider the safest ground.
   Typical of one approach is the television ad run in Ohio by
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tony Celebrezze.
   ``I believe you can be personally opposed to abortion,''
Celebrezze says in the ad, ``while recognizing as I do that
politicians shouldn't dictate to a woman what choice to make.''
   His Republican opponent, former Cleveland Mayor George
Voinovich, countered that Celebrezze was ``completely reversing''
his former strong anti-abortion position.
   In many high-profile races, the two candidates are on the same
side of the abortion question.
   Feinstein and Wilson, in California, are both pro-abortion
rights, as are Democratic Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois and his
rival, Republican Rep. Lynn Martin, and Pell of Rhode Island and
his challenger, Republican Rep. Claudine Schneider.
   Republicans say they think the popular 43-year-old Schneider has
a good chance to upset Pell, 71, the patrician chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

   Brains _ and beauty _ highlight this
week's Miss America Pageant, heralding a new era in the 70-year-old
contest better known for skin-tight swimsuits than generous college
scholarships, promoters say.
   Competitors for Miss America 1991 still spray glue on their
swimsuits to prevent skin spillover and swab their teeth with
petroleum jelly to ensure a shiny smile, but pageant executive
director Leonard Horn said change is coming. Horn eliminated
pre-competition photo opportunities featuring contestants in
swimsuits this year and for a second straight year the swimsuit
competition will account for 15 percent of pageant scoring, an
all-time low.
   ``The swimsuit competition is our Achilles' heel,'' Horn said.
``I find it difficult to rationalize putting a young college woman
in a swimsuit and high-heel shoes. ... But it would be folly for us
to eliminate it unless we can find an acceptable alternative.''
   The search for such an alternative goes on, he said, adding the
emphasis should not be on swimsuits, but rather on the $5 million
in scholarships awarded at state and national levels.
   Many contestants are working toward master's degrees or
doctorates, he said. They range in age from 19 to the pageant
maximum of 26. The winner receives a $35,000 scholarship.
   ``This program is involved in volunteerism and wholesome
American values that in a world teeming with negativism is one
little positive light,'' Horn said. ``In today's world, role models
are more important than ever.''
   The pageant is celebrating its seventh decade. It was created in
1921 by local merchants trying to squeeze in an extra tourist
weekend after Labor Day.
   Returning this year is 75-year-old Bert Parks, who was fired in
1980 for being too old to croon ``There She Is'' to the new Miss
America.
   Co-host Gary Collins will still fill that role, but Parks will
serenade 26 former Miss Americas with his trademark song during one
segment of the two-hour production. Miss America 1971 Phyllis
George joins Collins as co-host.
   Weeklong preliminary competitions culminate in nationally
televised finals Saturday. Judges allot 30 percent to an interview
with the contestants, 40 percent for talent, and 15 percent each to
evening gown and swimsuit.
   Celebrity judges this year include actresses Shirley Jones,
Delta Burke, Nell Carter and Cynthia Sikes; actor John Forsythe,
author Sidney Sheldon and talk show host Larry King.
   The winner will succeed Miss America 1990 Debbye Turner. Miss
Turner plans to return to the University of Missouri-Columbia
Veterinary School where she is six months short of her doctorate in
veterinary medicine.

<HEAD>Police: Serial Killer Left Clues</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With one day to go before classes
resume at the University of Florida, police are studying what they
vaguely described as ``messages'' left by the killer of five
college students.
   Investigators on Sunday also said they reduced their list of
prime suspects from eight to four, and clues left by the killer are
helping.
   The slayings have terrorized the campus, where students are on a
Labor Day break until Tuesday.
   ``The messages were given to us from the crime scenes,'' said
police Lt. Sadie Darnell. ``The messages are indirect that we're
interpreting to be messages of some importance.''
   The killer left no notes or other writings, she said, declining
to provide further details. Sheriff's Lt. Spencer Mann added that
no ``calling cards'' were found on the bodies. ``It's not a
signature-type homicide,'' he said.
   Autopsies on Tracy Inez Paules and Manuel Taboada, both 23,
showed they died of stab wounds similar to those that killed the
other victims, Mann said. Unlike the first three, the bodies of
Miss Paules and Taboada were not mutilated.
   Mann would not say whether the same weapon was used in all five
slayings.
   Police said an Ohio fugitive, 58-year-old Warren Virgil Tinch,
was dropped from their ``prime suspects'' list. Tinch is sought in
Ohio in the stabbing death of a 52-year-old woman and is suspected
of stealing cars in Ocala and Gainesville a week before the
killings.
   Mann would not say whether 18-year-old Edward Lewis Humphrey is
among the top four suspects and would not otherwise disclose who is
on the list.
   Humphrey, a part-time freshman at the university whom
authorities describe as emotionally troubled, is in jail on $1
million bail for allegedly assaulting his 79-year-old grandmother
and has been questioned as a suspect.
   Miss Paules and Taboada were found Tuesday at the apartment they
shared at a complex where Humphrey lived for a few weeks this
summer. A neighbor said Humphrey was romantically interested in
Miss Paules and often waited for her by the pool.
   Police took prints of Humphrey's feet in jail, and two officers
in hip waders Sunday used a metal detector to search a creek next
to his apartment complex, Darnell said. Police said all they found
was an old street sign.
   The victims were students at either the university or Santa Fe
Community College. Their deaths terrified classmates, including
about 100 who dropped out or transferred.
   University President John Lombardi said campus security was
tight.
   ``We believe this community to be as safe as any other
university community in America,'' he said. ``Would I send my child
back to the University of Florida? Yes, I would.''
   Student body President Michael Browne said that his classmates
are still afraid but that dropping out would be a mistake. ``Above
all, we must not be held hostage to our fears,'' he said. ``Giving
up will not solve anything.''
   Also slain were Christina Powell, 17, of Jacksonville; Sonya
Larson, 18, of Deerfield Beach, and Christa Hoyt, 18, of Newberry.
All lived in off-campus apartments and were discovered beginning
Aug. 26.
   A memorial service for the victims is scheduled for Wednesday at
the school's basketball arena.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has acknowledged that it is
instituting food rationing but says Iraqis would rather eat mud
than bow to foreign powers, who have isolated Baghdad as punishment
for its seizure of Kuwait.
   Government spokesman Naji al-Hadithi on Sunday denied reports
that the U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with Iraq had caused
shortages.
   He said, however, that as a precaution his government was
instituting steps to reduce food consumption.
   ``We have a war-tested society. We have a war-tested economy. So
even if we eat mud, we will resist pressure and not kneal down to
any foreign power,'' he said, referring to the eight-year war with
Iran that ended in 1988.
   Foreigners who left the country reported lines for bread and
other food.
   Last week, Iraqi sources said rationing was to begin Sept. 1,
but on Sunday a shopkeeper said he thought the rationing would
begin on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear whether the
measures affected all of Iraq at once.
   The embargo, backed by a U.S.-led armada of warships from
several countries, has halted nearly all of Iraq's vital oil
exports and food imports, aiming to force an Iraqi pullout from
Kuwait.
   Al-Hadithi and Information and Culture Minister Latif Nasaif
Jasim took a defiant stance in a meeting with reporters on Sunday,
saying Iraq wanted peace, but was prepared for war.
   Jasim said Iraq was not afraid of war with the United States,
which has deployed tens of thousands of troops in the Saudi desert
since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. He said his country has 1.5
million men under arms and 5.5 million volunteers ready to fight.
   ``During the war with Iran, hundreds of American-made planes
darkened our skies, and even our children used to throw rocks at
these planes,'' Jasim said. ``So if Bush wants to stay in power, he
will pull out his soldiers and not make war.''
   Under a plan organized by the ruling Ba'ath Party, stores will
limit the quantity of certain products that can be sold at one
time, al-Hadithi said.
   ``We need only bread and water. We need no more than that. We
can live for a long time,'' Jasim said. ``Dignity is more important
than food.''
   Earlier, sources said coupons had been issued to Iraqis
entitling them to a monthly allocation of 13 pounds of flour, 3.3
pounds of rice, 2.2 pounds of sugar, 3.5 ounces of tea, 1.1 pounds
of oil, 17 ounces of detergent and one bar of soap.
   Two food store owners in Baghdad said they were told the
rationing plan would limit purchases of such items as rice, sugar,
tea, cooking oil, baby food, detergent and soap.
   ``We really don't think about this. I'm not hoarding. Everything
is here. We are not worried about it,'' one shopper said on
condition of anonymity.
   Al-Hadithi said the plan was a precaution prompted by the U.N.
sanctions but not a response to any spot shortages.
   ``We are determined to live on our own cultivation,'' he said.
``Iraq reached self-sufficiency in vegetables and fruit during the
war with Iran.''
   He said production of rice and wheat were up significantly, and
that the government had taken steps to encourage farmers to put
more land into cultivation and to entice businessmen to take more
interest in the countryside.

   Lightning killed a man riding on the back of a
motorcycle and injured the driver when the bolt struck as they rode
down a six-lane highway, police said.
   The passenger was struck on U.S. Highway 95 outside of town
Sunday afternoon, said Nevada Highway Patrol dispatcher Patrick
McDonald.
   The woman motorcycle driver was injured and taken to a hospital
where she was treated and released, McDonald said. He said the
victims, whose names were not disclosed, were Las Vegas residents.
   In California, 10 campers huddled under an awning were injured
when lightning struck a nearby tree, authorities said.
   About 20 people staying at a San Bernardino National Forest
campground near Big Bear took shelter from a fast-moving storm
Sunday afternoon, said fire Capt. Ron Lee of the California
Department of Forestry.
   The awning was connected to a vehicle parked under a pine tree.
   ``What happened was the lightning hit a tree next to the
trailer, started to spiral down but then jumped onto the group,''
said CDF Capt. Bob Buhrle.
   One dog was killed and another injured.
   Lee said at least three people suffered burns but he was unsure
how severe injuries were. He said seven others had ``varying other
complaints.'' All were transported to area hospitals, where their
conditions were not immediately available.

   Americans enjoying the last gasps of summer sizzled hot dogs and
hamburgers on barbecues, frolicked on the beach, spread out picnics
and just plain had fun in Labor Day celebrations nationwide.
   Sobering current events take center stage tonight in Corpus
Christi, Texas, where a prayer service for U.S. military personnel
shipped to the Middle East was organized.
   A mock funeral in New York today will mark the unofficial demise
of summer with the burial of a coffin containing hot-weather items
like sunglasses and swim trunks.
   Virgina Beach saw no repeat of looting and violence that marred
last year's holiday, a $40 million aquarium complex on the
Mississippi River opened to record attendance in New Orleans and
annual clamshell-toss championships were held on the New Jersey
shore.
   Hordes flocked to the beach in California, where a body-building
competition was scheduled for today at famed Muscle Beach in Los
Angeles.
   In Texas, the annual Marfa Lights Festival ends its four-day run
today after celebrating the natural phenomenon that can always be
viewed about five miles east of Marfa, a city about 200 miles
southeast of El Paso.
   Scientists haved tried to explain the mysterious lights, first
documented more than 100 years ago by pioneer ranchers. Legend has
it the lights are the ghost of the Mescalero Apache Indian Chief
Alsate looking for his tribe.
   Gospel music Sunday at the Spirit Festival in Kansas City, Mo.,
gave way to rock 'n' roll from the group Santana Sunday night.
Controversy flared briefly at the festival when not everyone was
amused by live mice on a roulette wheel or the mule that jumped
through a blazing hoop.
   Animal-rights activists complained and the attractions were shut
down.
   Barbecue was alive and well in Ireland, where a team of four
Kansas City-area grill chefs were named grand champions at the 6th
Annual World Cup Barbecue Competition in Lisdoonvarna.
   The competition was waged over hot coals by 31 teams, including
representatives from the Soviet Union, Italy and Holland. A team
from Kansas City won last year, too.
   Sunday's crowd of 16,009 at the Aquarium of the Americas in New
Orleans was a single-day record, said spokesman Steve Schulkens.
The figure topped the previous high of 15,101 set in 1989 by the
National Aquarium in Baltimore.
   In Cape May, N.J., Betty Ann Saraceni of Philadelphia won the
women's singles in the 44th annual Clamshell Pitching Contest. She
also won a share of the women's doubles title.
   Contestants take turns tossing clam shells into holes in the
sand 25{ feet apart.
   Michigan Gov. James Blanchard was expected to join more than
70,000 people early today for the 4.5-mile Mackinac Bridge walk in
Mackinac City. The event traditionally kicks off statewide Labor
Day festivities.
   Elsewhere, state fairs, demolition derbies, union gatherings and
musical concerts were scheduled.
   Residents in western New York organized the mock funeral
procession along Lake Erie today. ``Mourners'' were encouraged to
bring summertime items for interment in a coffin.
   ``Everybody feels so awful at the end of summer, so why not say
good-bye with a funeral,'' said organizer Jan Reuther, of Tonawanda.

stories and no glory.
   Fed up with big-city newspapers missing all but the most
sensational crimes, a Florida man is publishing a tabloid listing
every local arrest, including those for alleged shoplifting and
drunken-driving, as well as murder.
   The Informer plans to fight crime by filling pages with a
blotter-style listing of every suspect _ even though they're
innocent until proven guilty.
   ``This is going to be a deterrent,'' said publisher Ray Aden.
``What is happening is the great majority of people violating our
laws are not known _ to their neighbors, their bosses, sometimes
even their family.''
   ``But nobody wants to get their name in the paper.''
   Some daily newspapers already print crime blotter information.
There's nothing unlawful about printing arrests from the public
record. But civil libertarians and attorneys say the tabloid is
treading dangerous legal ground and could trample the rights of the
accused.
   From a small office in this St. Petersburg suburb, Aden and a
handful of employees are busy preparing for the Oct. 3 premiere of
the twice-monthly, 89-cent publication.
   Aden, a 70-year-old marketing analyst, has spent nine months and
more than $150,000 getting ready to print the paper slated to be
about half advertising and half listings of arrests, along with
articles such as ``How To Deal With Obscene Phone Calls.''
   The area's big dailies report only a few arrests a day, focusing
on major murders and drug busts. But each issue of The Informer is
designed to bulge up to 48 pages and list hundreds of arrests in
St. Petersburg, Clearwater and surrounding Pinellas County
communities.
   All of them list only the standard booking information: name,
address, age and arresting charge.
   ``We're not crime reporting or editorializing _ that's not the
concept,'' Aden said. ``We give the community information. ... It
probably will evolve into more area crime watches, which will
benefit the community.''
   And on every page, beneath boldface headers reading ``Domestic
Violence'' and ``Shoplifting'' disclaimers in the newspaper's
tiniest type read, ``Note: being arrested does not mean the person
is guilty.''
   ``They have an absolute right to print arrests,'' said Robyn
Blumner, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union
in Florida. ``But I would only hope the public is smart enough to
know that arrests by themselves are legally irrelevant.''
   Patricia Anderson, a libel attorney whose clients include the
St. Petersburg Times, said publishing arrests is fine, but they had
better be accurate.
   ``One wrong first name or one wrong middle initial and you could
have a big lawsuit on your hands,'' she said.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
sharply today, and the dollar declined against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, the Tokyo exchange's most
closely watched indicator, plunged 557.94 points, or 2.15 percent,
closing at 25,420.43 points. A light 360 million shares changed
hands.
   Kazuhiro Nomura, a trader with New Japan Securities Co., said
the stock index had risen robustly in the morning along with bond
prices, but collapsed in the afternoon on a rumor of a price
increase for imported liquefied natural gas.
   ``If there is the slightest bit of news, traders are poised to
begin selling,'' Nomura said.
   A security dealer with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru Securities added
that shares were sold on a rumor that authorities were
investigating possible manipulation of paper company shares.
   The dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said buying
enthusiasm declined after a Japanese news report quoted a British
newspaper as saying the United States had decided to use military
force against Iraq.
   The price movement of the benchmark No. 119 10-year government
bond closely paralleled that of the Nikkei average. After a morning
rise, the price fell back at the finish to the same level as
Friday's close of 83.07. The yield also matched Friday's close of
8.105 percent.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 143.55 yen, down 0.95
yen from Friday's close of 144.50. It opened at 143.40 yen and
stayed in a narrow range between 143.32 yen and 143.70 yen.
   Exchange dealers attributed the lower opening to cross trading
between the yen and principal European currencies, especially the
British pound.
   ``There are no incentives to buy the dollar or to sell it,''
said Toru Kanai, exchange analyst for New Japan Securities. He said
many participants were staying on the sidelines becaued of the
Labor Day holiday in the United States and beginning-of-the-week
slowness in Tokyo.
   Sumitomo Bank's Sumio Fukushima added that weak consumer
confidence in the United States and expected poor U.S. employment
figures due out Friday also were stimulating Japanese dealers'
retreat from the dollar.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Move Tens of Thousands of Civilians Inside Cambodia</HEAD>

   Cambodian guerrillas have moved at
least 60,000 refugees from camps in Thailand back into Cambodia and
some have died from disease as a result, Western aid officials said
today.
   Most of the refugees were from camps run by the Communist Khmer
Rouge, said a senior aid official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The others were from a camp controlled by the allied
guerrilla forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   He said the movements began after the September 1989 pullout of
Vietnamese troops from Cambodia but most of the refugees had been
relocated in the past six months. They were moved apparently to
consolidate areas the guerrillas recently ``liberated,'' he said.
   The relocations continue amid stepped up efforts to end the
11-year Cambodian war.
   The Vietnamese-installed Phnom Penh government has accepted an
invitation to join the guerrillas in talks in Jakarta, Indonesia,
on Wednesday on an interim government and a new United Nations
peace plan.
   Its premier, Hun Sen, said in a statement broadcast on state
radio Sunday he hoped the meeting would ``open the way toward a
common solution for the Cambodian problem.''
   Hun Sen said he will attend if Sihanouk, the main guerrilla
leader, also attends. Otherwise, the government will be represented
by Hor Nam Hong, a minister in the prime minister's office in
charge of foreign affairs.
   The Khmer Rouge and the non-communist Sihanouk forces are allied
with the Khmer People's National Liberation Front against Hun Sen.
   The Khmer Rouge relocated millions during its brutal attempt in
the 1970s to turn the country into a radical agrarian commune.
Hundreds of thousands of people were executed or died of hunger and
disease before Vietnam's late 1978 invasion ousted the fanatical
regime.
   The aid official said some refugees fell sick after the latest
relocations and tried to return to U.N.-aided camps in Thailand for
treatment. But some were prevented or delayed from doing so and had
died, mostly from malaria and anemia, he said. He said he could not
give a figure.
   ``You have people who are going voluntarily, people who don't
mind, and people who are forced to go back,'' he said.
   ``Our officers in the field believe the total number to be close
to 100,000,'' he said. ``We believe we are facing a tremendous
problem.''
   International relief officials have seen trucks taking the
refugees to border crossing points, said another aid official.
   ``You can say that they died from a political decision ... that
brought them back inside Cambodia without providing them with the
minimum of medical care,'' he said.
   ``As well as medical supplies, we know there are shortages of
food, too, although no one is starving yet,'' he said.
   In the past month, some 1,000 people had returned to the Khmer
Rouge camp of Site 8 with malaria, tuberculosis and other diseases
rife in the border region, he said.
   Aid officials stressed they had an incomplete picture of the
movements. They said many refugees habitually cross the border and
later return to the U.N. camps in Thailand. They also raised the
possibility the Thai military had a hand in the movements.
   There are more than 300,000 refugees in camps along the Thai
border run by the guerrillas and given humanitarian aid by the U.N.
Border Relief Operation.
   However, most of those moved by the Khmer Rouge were from their
hidden ``satellite camps'' _ closed military and civilian
communities near the U.N. camps. The Khmer Rouge and the Thai
military do not allow Western aid agencies to work inside these
camps but have let many refugees there seek medical assistance
outside.
   The senior relief official said the satellite camps near Site 8,
the main U.N.-aided Khmer Rouge camp in Prachinburi province, and
those farther south, near the U.N.-aided Site K camp in Trat
province, were empty.
   Other movements were reported from areas along the northern part
of the border, near the U.N. camp of O'Trao in Sisaket province.
   The refugees from the satellite camps near Site 8 had to travel
only a few miles to the border, but those in the south had to walk
for several days to reach their new homes, where the medical
situation was very bad, the official said.
   He said Sihanouk's authorities moved between 10,000 and 20,000
people from Site B, a U.N.-aided camp along the northern border in
Surin province. They were being moved mainly to two new settlements
just across the border.

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Indians, including some from
Mexico and Guatemala, gathered for a long weekend of dance, song
and traditional rites at the American Indian Movement's 22nd Annual
Gathering of Nations.
   ``When I was growing up, Indian people were almost taught to be
ashamed of their heritage,'' said Clyde Bellecourt, who founded AIM
in 1968. ``We try to get our young people away from that John
Wayne, wild West, the-only-good-Indian-is-a-dead-Indian mentality.''
   The four-day event that ends today stresses fellowship to build
understanding between diverse tribes. Attendance should easily
surpass last year's mark of about 9,000, Bellecourt said.
   About 50 tribes were represented at Fort Snelling State Park.
   ``It's like we make one big city here that can speak to my
culture, to his culture, to your culture and everyone's culture,''
said Alfonso Perez, 41, who journeyed from Mexico City. ``We come
with peace and dignity to share our culture with everybody.''
   ``I'm here because I'm culturally awake and I want to stay that
way,'' said Mitch Walking Elk, 39, of Tahlequah, Okla. ``It's fun
and it's serious. It's rejuvenating.''
   Julio Revolorio, 32, of Guatemala City said he was following his
ancestors' footsteps by traversing a continent that once had no
national boundaries. All modern Indian people should take pride in
the accomplishments of ancient civilizations throughout the
Americas, he said
   ``The biggest thing is to thank the creator,'' said Revolorio,
who participated in a traditional peace pipe ceremony.
   Bellecourt said the political side of the event includes
discussions of such issues as environmental protection, desecration
of Indian burial grounds and fishing rights. On Sunday, there was
an open discussion of the conflict in Oka, Quebec, between Mohawks
and the government.
   AIM gained notoriety in 1972 when it seized the Bureau of Indian
Affairs building in Washington, D.C. In 1973, AIM activists rioted
in front of the courthouse in Custer, S.D.
   Also in 1973, the 71-day occupation at Wounded Knee on the Pine
Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota left two Indians dead and
a federal marshall paralyzed.

<HEAD>Execution Becomes Polical Issue For Arkansas Governor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The scheduled execution of a man
convicted in the rape and murder of a nurse has taken on political
overtones for Gov. Bill Clinton, who is seeking a fifth term this
fall.
   Civil rights groups want Clinton to delay the execution of Barry
Lee Fairchild, a black man who contends he was coerced into
confessing. They warn the Democratic governor could lose his
traditionally strong support in the black community if Fairchild
dies as scheduled Wednesday.
   ``There is too much uncertainty in this case for an execution to
take place,'' the Rev. Ellihue Gaylord, president of the state
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said at
a recent news conference.
   Clinton, 44, has nurtured a zealous anti-crime reputation the
past few years, supporting prison boot camps and the state's first
drug czar in a 1989 legislative package.
   ``He's in a tough spot no matter which way he turns,'' said
Mahlon Martin, one of several black appointees to Clinton's
Cabinet. Martin left the administration last year.
   The execution of Fairchild, 36, would be the third in Arkansas
this year. Cop-killer John Edward Swindler and mass murderer R.
Gene Simmons were white. Swindler was the first Arkansas inmate
executed since 1964.
   Fairchild was convicted in the 1983 rape and murder Marjorie
Mason, 22, a Little Rock Air Force Base nurse. A key for
prosecutors was two videotapes in which Fairchild unemotionally
detailed the abduction and rape of Ms. Mason. His head is bandaged
in the videotapes.
   The head wound was received during the arrest and he also was
bitten by a police dog, police said.
   On appeal, Fairchild said he was beaten by police and confessed
to a crime he didn't commit. U.S. District Judge G. Thomas Eisele
dismissed the claims Wednesday. He said nobody testified that they
saw Fairchild being beaten.
   The FBI is investigating alleged inmate abuse while U.S. Rep.
Tommy Robinson, R-Ark., was Pulaski County sheriff from 1980 to
1984. Little Rock is in Pulaski County. But the judge said he is
convinced the matter doesn't pertain to Fairchild.
   Eisele also rejected arguments that Fairchild's limited mental
capacity could cause a second jury to believe Fairchild was
coerced. He said the inmate ``wasn't so retarded that he confessed
to a murder he did not commit.''
   Opponents of the execution want Clinton to issue a reprieve
until the FBI inquiry is complete.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis will hear an
appeal Tuesday. That court and the Supreme Court have turned
Fairchild away twice.
   ``I'm going to try to depoliticize this as much as possible,
read the facts of the case against the law and, hopefully, make the
right decision,'' Clinton said Thursday.
   The case gained an added political dimension when the NAACP,
Amnesty International and the American Civil Liberties Union held a
news conference Thursday to pressure Clinton.
   Keith Jennings, deputy director of Amnesty International's
southern region at Atlanta, said national black leaders will
contact Clinton to ``let you know that should you have national
aspirations, the African community won't forget.''
   Clinton toyed with the idea of running for president in 1988.
   The governor may be worried about more than the black vote.
   ``There's another political issue here that makes it
different,'' said Martin, now president of the Winthrop Rockefeller
Foundation. ``We've had two executions this year and those were
white people.
   ``Unless the white community agrees there are unique matters in
this case and differences _ which I think there are _ I think they
may see a granting of a stay as strictly a racial issue.''
   Martin said that perception could hurt Clinton in the November
election.
   Arkansas' black population is about 16 percent, and Clinton is
already in trouble with some rural white voters who blame him for
the closing of their small school districts.
   Clinton appears willing to leave the matter in the courts'
hands. ``My leanings are to give great weight to the decisions of
the federal district court,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II decried today the
failure of development in Africa, blaming a thirst for power and
profit for plunging the continent into poverty and injustice.
   ``How many young people in Africa are deeply affected by the
lack of hope that overshadows their future,'' the pope said on the
third day of a 10-day African tour.
   John Paul flew from the country's commercial capital, the port
city of Dar es Salaam, 380 miles to southwestern Songea to
celebrate Mass.
   The pope was greeted by traditional dancers and music, people
singing hymns and ululating. About 25,000 people attended the
service, which was held in an open field in the African savannah.
   ``Certainly it is not easy for people, especially young people,
to be self-giving and generous when they see around them so much
poverty and suffering, so many instances of neglect and
injustice,'' he said in his homily.
   John Paul said the hopes of many Third World countries have been
dashed by hunger, malnutrition, crime and corruption.
   He compared the situation to the chaos discribed in the Book of
Genesis _ the world was a ``formless void and there was darkness
over the deep.''
   But he urged Africans to maintain hope.
   ``Many problems of development, no matter how overpowering, can
be solved if there is a new attitude diametrically opposed to a
selfish desire for profit and the thirst for power.''
   The pope was to fly to northwestern Mwanza, on the shores of
Lake Victoria, later in the day to bless 100 patients at an
Episcopal-run hospital, make a speech and dine with the archbishop,
Monsignor Anthony Mayala.
   On Sunday, the pontiff called for cooperation and brotherhood
between Christianity and Islam in Africa, where the world's two
largest religions have occasionally clashed in competition for
converts.
   The pope hailed good relations between the two faiths in this
largely Moslem country where Catholics are only 21 percent of the
population of about 24 million.
   The Moslem community contributed financially to the pope's
visit, according to Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro.
   The nation's Moslem president, Ali Hassan Mwinyi, attended an
open-air Mass Sunday morning. He also provided a small plane for
the pope to travel in from Dar es Salaam to Mwanza.
   John Paul winds up the Tanzania leg of his seventh trip to
Africa on Wednesday. He will go on to Burundi, Rwanda and Ivory
Coast, where he ends the trip Sept. 10 with the consecration of a
massive basilica.

   Skies were clear over much of the nation early today as the
holiday weekend came to a close.
   After a night of severe thunderstorms, sunny skies and cooler
weather were predicted for the Northeast today, with drier air from
offshore moving in. Highs in the region were expected to be in the
70s and 80s.
   The South was looking for hot, sticky weather with highs in the
90s and 100s. Scattered thunderstorms were possible in North
Carolina and Florida.
   Very muggy conditions were also expected across the central
Plains and the Southwest, thanks to a stalled high pressure system,
temperatures again reaching the 90s and 100s. Showers were possible
in western Texas, New Mexico and Arizona.
   Thunderstorms were forming over North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa
and Michigan, the highs in the 80s. Rain was also predicted for
Colorado and Utah. The Pacific Northwest was expecting sunshine and
low humdity, temperatures in the 70s and 80s.
   The high for the nation Sunday was 107 degress in Yuma, Ariz.

<HEAD>Emigration Jumps Almost 50 Percent As Fears Of China Loom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emigration from Hong Kong will leap almost 50
percent this year because of fears of Communist China's takeover in
1997, the British colonial government announced today.
   The government said 62,000 people are expected to leave the
territory in 1990, compared to 42,000 last year, an increase of
47.6 percent.
   Mike Rowse, head of a government task force on emigration,
predicted about 60,000 people a year _ or 1,150 people a week _
would leave the colony in 1991 and 1992.
   ``But after that you're getting into crystal ball gazing,'' he
said.
   Some analysts say emigration from Hong Kong will skyrocket after
1992, five years before China resumes control of the colony and the
year China's controversial Daya Bay nuclear power plant is
scheduled to come on stream 30 miles north of Hong Kong.
   Reports of numerous construction problems have dogged the plant,
causing worries about its safety.
   Rowse said most of the people leaving are members of Hong Kong's
vibrant, well-educated middle class, who have turned this
410-square-mile patch of islands and peninsula on the southern
Chinese coast into an economic powerhouse.
   Their departure has sparked fears of economic and social
problems in Hong Kong once China resumes control of the territory
in 1997.
   Interest in emigration has increased since China cracked down on
a movement for freedom in Beijing in June 1989. The crackdown
convinced many in the territory that China could easily break its
promise to maintain the colony's freewheeling economic and social
system for 50 years.
   London's refusal to give most of its Hong Kong colonial subjects
the right to live in Britain also played a role in encouraging
emigration. The British government has recently approved a package
that will give about 225,000 of Hong Kong's 5.7 million people the
right of abode in Britain.
   Only certain individuals, such as senior civil servants, top
businessmen, educators and highly-skilled workers, qualify.
   Rowse said applications for the package would begin to be acted
on in November and that the first passports under the plan would be
issued by spring.
   But, he said, the government has no way to predict whether
people who receive the passports will stay, as the plan intends, or
leave immediately for Britain.
   Horatio Cheung, an emigration specialist who has criticized Hong
Kong in the past for softpedaling the emigration problem, said he
thought the government's predictions were accurate this year.
   ``But it's significant that they didn't look past 1992,'' he
said. ``That's when I believe you'll see a mass exodus.''
   So far, the most popular destination has been Canada. Australia
will probably surpass the United States this year for the second
slot.
   But that lineup soon could change.
   A bill being debated by the U.S. Congress would raise Hong
Kong's immigration quota to America from 5,000 to 20,000 people.

   A triumphant Imelda Marcos hugged friends and
supporters and kissed children as she returned to her home-in-exile
to mark her late husband's birthday.
   The former Philippine first lady, clad in her customary black
dress and draped with flower leis, also took time Sunday to praise
U.S. courts after her arrival at Honolulu International Airport.
   ``The system works. God bless America,'' said Mrs. Marcos,
cleared in June of federal racketeering charges.
   More than 100 supporters waved U.S. and Philippine flags and
serenaded Mrs. Marcos with choruses of ``God Bless America,'' ``The
Mabuhay (long life) Song,'' and ``We Are Filipinos.''
   Mrs. Marcos left Hawaii in March to face trial in a New York
City federal court on fraud and racketeering charges alleging she
helped steal millions of dollars from her homeland to buy art and
real estate in the United States.
   A jury acquitted Mrs. Marcos and her co-defendant, Saudi
financier Adnan Khashoggi.
   Mrs. Marcos and her husband, Ferdinand, fled the Philippines in
February 1986 during a civilian-military revolt that propelled
Corazon Aquino to the presidency.
   Ferdinand Marcos died Sept. 28, 1989.

   Bags containing decapitated
animals and indications of ritual animal sacrifice were discovered
by hunters in Angeles National Forest, authorities said.
   The hunters found the bags Saturday near a U.S. Forest Service
station on Angeles Crest Highway, said Los Angeles County sheriff's
Sgt. Dan Cox.
   ``The animals were possibly used in a spiritual ritual. There's
no further information or suspects,'' he said.
   Authorities said one bag held a black rooster wrapped in a black
sheet bearing a pentagram, coconut shells, a handmade doll and
candles. A sheep and two roosters, all decapitated, were in a
second bag. A third contained a rooster and a goat, both
decapitated.
   The roosters' heads were in the bags but the goat and sheep
heads were missing.
   Deputies filed a cruelty-to-animals report and gave the case to
the county's animal control board.

<TEXT>
   Young people roamed the streets with
water guns this Labor Day weekend and police looked the other way
when large crowds gathered around boom boxes _ a far cry from last
year's rioting.
   Police spokesman Lew Thurston said 86 people had been charged
with misdemeanor offenses along the oceanfront as of 5 p.m. Sunday.
Last year, 158 people were arrested and taken into custody and 614
people were issued summonses for misdemeanors following two nights
of rioting and looting.
   City officials, who estimated the 1989 crowd at more than
100,000, put this year's crowd at 29,000.
   Troy Hazell and nine friends were among the water gun
brandishers, gathering at an oceanfront intersection Sunday night.
``People who don't have water guns seem to get mad but people with
water guns don't mind. They shoot us back,'' he said.
   Hazell, 21, of Queens, N.Y., chose his targets carefully.
   ``We're having fun,'' he said. ``I met about 27 girls. I got 27
numbers.''
   But some people said the party atmosphere was lacking for what
is usually the biggest holiday of the summer. Visitors complained
about streets closed to cars and the strong police presence.
   Cynthia Cramer, 25, of Washington, D.C., said people were being
harrassed when she arrived with friends Saturday night.
   ``We saw police make a young guy walk three straight lines, then
another one holding his foot,'' Ms. Cramer said. ``I feel like I'm
back in the '60s.''

<HEAD>Saudis to Boost Oil Output to 7.6 Million Barrels, Survey Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia will boost its daily oil
production by 2.27 million barrels this month to make up for the
loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti output, the Middle East Economic survey
reported today.
   In addition, the United Arab Emirates will boost output from
fields in Abu Dhabi by about 450,000 barrels a day, the respected
Nicosia-based oil industry newsletter said.
   Before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, Iraq's President Saddam
Hussein warned that he would retaliate for the violation of OPEC
quotas by Kuwait and the U.A.E. The extra oil on markets was
driving down crude prices.
   A United Nations economic embargo imposed on Iraq four days
after the invasion stopped Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil exports, slashing
available OPEC production by 4 million barrels a day and driving up
prices.
   The new increase in daily output follows an agreement by
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna on Aug. 29
to suspend quota restrictions and allow production to rise toward
22.5 million barrels a day.
   That was the production level set in Geneva by the oil cartel on
July 27, six days before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   The move to boost oil production by Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates will boost Saudi output to 7.65 million barrels
daily, and the Emirates' to about 2 million barrels a day.
   The newsletter estimates that OPEC production will reach 22.1
million barrels a day this month and rise to 23.1 million barrels
daily by year's end.
   The Vienna agreement was aimed at restoring market stability and
salvaging OPEC's credibility in the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The accord was seen as a major political victory for Saudi
Arabia, which had lobbied for a rapid production boost against
opposition from other OPEC members, notably Iran. The kingdom had
threatened to boost production unilaterally if necessary.
   The economic survey said Saudi Arabia will give priority to
supplying ``developing countries whose oil supplies have been
affected by the Iraq-Kuwait cut-off.''
   These include Turkey, Brazil, the Philippines, India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Taiwan and South Korea.
   Next on the list are the Japanese, the newsletter said. In last
priority are increases for U.S. and European buyers, it said.
   ``At the same time, Saudi Arabia is also to supply crude on a
commercial basis to two OPEC countries hit by the crisis,'' the
survey reported.
   The Kuwait Petroleum Co. ``will be receiving 150,000 barrels a
day of Saudi crude in September, rising to 220,000 barrels a day in
October,'' it said.
   ``Indonesia will be receiving Saudi crude to make up for a
30,000 barrel-a-day supply contract it had with Iraq,'' the
newsletter reported.
   The survey said 7.5 million barrels a day of the increased Saudi
production will come from Aramco fields. That is roughly the oil
giant's sustainable capacity, although it has a short-term surge
capacity of up to 8.5 million barrels a day.
   The rest of Saudi Arabia's output will come from its half of the
so-called ``neutral zone,'' which it shares with Kuwait.
   The land fields in the zone, whose production installations are
on the Kuwaiti side of the border, have been closed since Aug. 2.
But the offshore fields, which lie on the Saudi Arabian side,
remain in operation.
   All the United Arab Emirates' increase will come from Abu Dhabi,
the federation's main producer. Dubai, its other producer, will
maintain its current output of 400,000 barrels a day, the
newsletter said.
   ``Whether Abu Dhabi production goes even higher in the fourth
quarter ... will no doubt depend mainly on technical oilfield
factors,'' the newsletter noted.
   Venezuelan production is also expected to rise this month by
350,000 barrels a day, increasing another 150,000 barrels daily in
November to a total of 500,000 barrels a day.
   Newsletter editor Ian Seymour said the Vienna accord ``stands a
good chance of defusing the oil supply crisis in its present form _
that is to say, unless anything worse happens in the Middle East
arena.''

<TEXT>
   Tropical Storm Gustav sped out into open waters
this morning, churning away from Canada's Maritime provinces with
top sustained winds near 65 mph, forecasters said.
   Gustav could make its way across the Atlantic and pose a storm
threat later in the week to western Europe, said hurricane
specialist Bob Case of the National Hurricane Center in suburban
Coral Gables.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, Gustav was centered near 51.0 north latitude and
40.5 west longitude, or about 650 miles northeast of Cape Race,
Newfoundland, according to the hurricane center.
   Gustav was moving northeast at near 35 mph with storm force
winds extending up to 230 miles from its center. The storm was
expected to continue on the same heading with little change in
strength for the next 24 hours, Case said.
   Gustav dropped below hurricane-force winds of 74 mph on Sunday,
a day after the system boasted 100 mph winds, forecasters said.
   The Atlantic hurricane season lasts from June 1 to Nov. 30.

   The Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon turned 25
this year, shifting from Las Vegas to a revolving Hollywood stage
and retaining a very familiar host.
   Lewis kicked off the 21{-hour fund-raiser Sunday night for the
Muscular Dystrophy Association with a dedication to the late Sammy
Davis Jr., his voice breaking with emotion as he recalled the
entertainer's recent death.
   Lewis' role is somewhat smaller for this year's show, which he
didn't produce. That job went to veteran television producer George
Schlatter.
   The comedian will share time as host with ``Entertainment
Tonight's'' Leeza Gibbons and ``Tonight Show'' emcee Ed McMahon.
There also were to be frequent appearances by talk show host Sally
Jessy Raphael, comedian Norm Crosby and entertainer Ben Vereen.
   The telethon began in 1966 in New York City and was moved in
1973 to Las Vegas, where Lewis raised more than $500 million. Last
year's show tallied a record $42.2 million to fight 40
neuromuscular diseases that kill and cripple thousand of people
annually, most of them young people.
   The Star Search Theater on Sunset Boulevard, where McMahon
presents a glitzy talent show, was the home base for this year's
syndicated telethon, which was to be seen on 200 stations
nationwide.

   Americans freed from the U.S. Embassy in
Kuwait, after weeks as virtual prisoners of Iraqi soldiers outside
the walls, say the comrades they left behind face mounting hunger,
thirst and weariness.
   As the 47 Americans arrived Sunday, the few who met with
reporters painted a grim picture of life inside the eight-block
compound just across a six-lane highway from a Persian Gulf beach.
   ``The situation is deteriorating daily,'' former hostage Lloyd
Culbertson, 76, said today. He estimated that 20 to 25 Americans
remain at the embassy.
   ``The food is spoiling. There is no electricity,'' Culbertson
said on CBS ``This Morning.'' ``We have no means of communicating
with other people. Our ambassador is not allowed to talk with other
ambassador or to American citizens. He can't leave the compound.''
   ``These situations also prevail at the Canadian Embassy and the
Japanese Embassy and possibly others,'' he said.
   Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Mohamed al-Mashat, who
met the former hostages at Washington-Dulles International Airport
on Sunday, told them, ``I come to welcome our guests here.''
   His remarks got a cold shoulder.
   ``I wasn't a guest,'' said the white-bearded Culbertson, of El
Paso, Texas. ``I damned near starved to death.''
   Bonnie Anderton of Denver said, ``It is the only hotel I have
ever been a guest in that I don't intend to leave a tip. We were
sleeping on the floor, there was no water and no power and we were
being eaten alive by bugs.''
   Mrs. Anderton was accompanied by her daughter, Jennifer, 10, who
nervously twirled a red baseball cap as her mother spoke.
   Jennifer's father, Richard Anderton, an engineer, remained
behind in the embassy, where the family took refuge the day after
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Iraqi officials cut off power and water to the embassy after
Washington refused a demand to close it.
   Jesse Jackson, the American civil rights leader who arranged for
more than 100 foreigners to leave Baghdad and Kuwait City on
Saturday, urged the Iraqis to restore water and power, saying that
otherwise he did not believe the embassy could hold out more than a
few days.
   ``He doesn't know us,'' said Mrs. Anderton. ``We'll make it. I
think they'll stay as long as they have to.''
   D. Michael Cheers, a freelance photojournalist who accompanied
Jackson, said the Americans in the embassy were boiling water from
the swimming pool for drinking and breaking up furniture to burn in
wood stoves.
   Many of the hostages were greeted in their hometowns by joyful
relatives.
   ``Long live America!'' 16-year-old Sayyeda Mirza's father,
Masood, said after he, his daughter and his wife arrived at New
York City's La Guardia Airport on the last leg of their journey to
their Manhasset Hills, N.Y., home.
   Mirza said that when he learned he was being released, ``I was
happy. I was crying.
   ``And the next moment I thought, `What about the others?' ''
   Prabhavathi Murikpudi, 40, wept with joy when she and her
10-year-old daughter, Sylaja, were met at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport by her husband, whose monthlong effort to
gain their release included a videotaped plea sent to Saddam.
   Sylaja celebrated her 10th birthday while in Iraq.
   ``Some ladies mentioned (her birthday) to the cook and they
arranged a big celebration,'' including champagne, music, gifts and
a candlelight dinner, she said.
   ``We were really treated very well, physically,'' Mrs. Mirza
told television station WCBS-TV in an interview at the family's
Manhasset Hills home. Others disagreed.
   A U.S. official said 24 women, 11 men and 12 children arrived
Sunday but declined to identify them, citing privacy laws. About a
third of the women were reported to be pregnant. The State
Department said about 1,000 Americans remain in Kuwait, and about
500 are in Iraq.
   Among the men was Edward Johnson, 62, a vice president in the
St. Louis office of Fasco Industries, which makes electric motors.
   ``We don't want to leave the embassy,'' he said. ``It's American
ground.''
   Cheers said the men who were allowed to return after Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein announced he would free women and children
were chosen because of medical problems.
   Johnson, a diabetic, said he took refuge at the embassy Aug. 17
on the advice of an embassy official. Culbertson, who taught
electronics to the Kuwaiti military, had been in the embassy since
Aug. 10.
   Of the Americans aboard the green Iraqi jumbo jet who had been
held in Baghdad, only one spoke to reporters. She gave a markedly
different picture of her captivity than those from Kuwait City.
   ``I have had an enjoyable time,'' said Beth Krekeler of St.
Louis, a former English teacher in Baghdad. ``I have had a
cross-cultural experience.''
   Mrs. Krekeler, who spoke to reporters while cuddling her
two-year-old cat, Minutiae, also said she did not object to the
Iraqi policy of ferrying hostages to potential bombing targets to
serve as human shields.
   ``I think it is a very noble thing to be there, to stop the
bombing of cities and the bombing of people,'' she said.
   Culbertson criticized President Bush for vacationing during the
crisis and said, ``If it were not for the grace of God and Jesse
Jackson, we would not be here. The State Department has not lifted
a hand for us.''
   Asked if the people left behind feared for their lives,
Culbertson said, ``Yes, they certainly do.''
   Mrs. Anderton said Iraqi troops often fired shots near the U.S.
Embassy compound during the day.
   Jackson said at the airport, ``Now that the military has played
its role, diplomacy must work. If preconditions make talks
impossible, war is inevitable.''

   Three robbers, firing automatic weapons,
blasted their way through Hong Kong's main tourist center today and
escaped with about $1 million worth of jewelry, police said.
   The robbery was one of two major jewelry heists today in the
swank Central District, home of the famed Star Ferry terminal.
   Police, pointing to a trail of blood leading into a subway
entrance, said they believed one of the robbers was shot in the
firefight with officers.
   Authorities said three men, two armed with automatic weapons and
another with ``a grenade-like object'' burst into a watch shop on
Queen's Road late this morning. While one man stood guard, his
colleagues snatched about 85 expensive watches along with jewelry
and rings.
   A police sergeant arrived at the scene. The robbers shot at him
seven times while the officer fired three times, police said.
   Clutching their bag of goods, the thieves fled down alleyways
that wind through the business district, filled with high-rises and
expensive retail shops, police said.
   Police and the robbers exchanged fire once more before the
threesome ducked into a subway entrance and disappeared.
   Also today, a band of robbers smashed into a jewelry store on
another main commercial thoroughfare, Nathan Road, snatching about
$500,000 worth of gold, police said. They also escaped.

<HEAD>Former KGB General Wins Seat in Soviet Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former KGB general who was dismissed after
criticizing his employers has been elected to the Soviet
Parliament, Tass reported today.
   Oleg Kalugin received a majority of votes cast Sunday in a
run-off election for a seat in the Congress of People's Deputies,
the official news agency said.
   The Election Commission chairman in the southern Russian
province of Krasnodar, where the vote took place, would not confirm
or deny the report. Vladislav Busheyev said he would not comment
until after the commission met later today to approve the vote
count.
   Tass did not say how many ballots were cast, or how many people
voted for Kalugin compared to his opponent, Nikolai Gorovoi, an
agricultural official.
   Kalugin's election campaign focused on his allegations that the
KGB continues to tap telephones, infiltrate trade unions and the
Russian Orthodox Church and play dirty tricks abroad, despite a
campaign to shed its image as an instrument of purges and
repression.
   Kalugin was dismissed and stripped of his rank after going
public with his accusations in June. The Soviet prosecutor has been
investigating him since July 17 under a law against divulging state
secrets, but no formal charges have been brought brought against
him.
   As an elected lawmaker, Kalugin cannot now be prosecuted on
criminal charges without the agreement of the Soviet legislature.
   The 55-year-old former major general was a KGB agent in the
United States from 1958 to 1970, first while working as a Radio
Moscow correspondent and later as a first secretary in the Soviet
Embassy in Washington.
   The KGB and its supporters tried to discredit Kalugin before an
initial vote was held last month in Krasnodar, an agricultural
region along the Black Sea 750 miles south of Moscow. Kalugin
outpolled 20 other candidates but did not win the required majority.
   On Saturday, the KGB accused him of slander for saying that two
defectors had once worked as assistants to KGB Chairman Vladimir
Kryuchkov and his deputy chairman, Viktor Grushko. Kalugin made the
allegations Friday night on the popular television program
``Viewpoint.''
   The KGB called it ``another slanderous allegation by Oleg
Kalugin.'' In a statement released by Tass, the KGB also said ``it
is impossible to bypass the fact that many statements by Kalugin
betray striking affinity to numerous statements'' by one of the
defectors.
   The KGB said neither Kryuchkov nor Grushko have ever had
assistants who betrayed their country.
   Krasnodar's seat in the national Congress, which meets twice a
year, was vacated by Ivan Polozkov, who left to become the
Communist Party chief of the Russian federation, the largest of the
Soviet Union's 15 republics.

<TEXT>
   A shot was fired this morning as soldiers
moved closer to the last area under control of armed Mohawk
warriors.
   There was no immediate indication which side fired the shot, but
it did not appear anyone was hit. Both Mohawk and army spokesmen
denied firing.
   The incident took place as a 2-month-old standoff wore on today,
with troops surrounding about 30 Mohawk Indian militants who
refused to surrender and retreated to a drug and alcohol
detoxification center on Indian land.
   On Sunday, about 350 soliders demolished the last barricades
blocking access to the Kanesatake Indian reservation, and seized
control of most of it. Mohawks were confined to a small wooded area
around the center.
   Late Sunday, the militants issued a statement saying the army
had given them an ultimatum to surrender by 8 a.m. EDT today or
face attack. But an army spokesman, Maj. Jean-Paul Macdonald, said
that was ``absolutely wrong.''
   ``The Canadian Forces are not in the business of giving
ultimatums in such sensitive situations,'' Macdonald said.
   Native representatives, including three chiefs from the Six
Nations Iroquois Confederacy, met late into the night at the center
to discuss ways to end the standoff without violence.
   The Indians had errected the barricades at Kanesatake and
another Mohawk community, Kahnawake, in a dispute over plans by Oka
town officials to expand a golf course onto what they claim is
tribal land.
   The barriers had blocked traffic on an Oka highway and, about 20
miles away, on a bridge connecting Montreal to southern suburbs.
   On Sunday, the Warriors, a militant Mohawk organization,
periodically came out from the trees and stood face-to-face with
soldiers at Oka. On one occasion, a Warrior approached a soldier,
stood chest-to-chest with him and stared into his eyes as a group
of reporters watched.
   Finally, he let out a war whoop, turned and walked away. ``I
want to see their face before I kill them,'' the Warrior said.
   The Mohawks fortified their positions by using a front-end
loader to pile earth on a road near the two-story detoxification
center in the woods. Some crouched behind trees in wait for the
army.
   When asked whether the Warriors were prepared to shoot it out
with the army, one militant said ``definitely.''
   ``This is it. We can't be pushed any further,'' he said.
   However, no fighting broke out between the soldiers and Indians
Sunday. Military helicopters flew overhead and about 80 armored
vehicles were in the area, the army said.
   Mohawk spokesman Ellen Gabriel said the Indians are ``pretty
squeezed in right now. There's no way out really.''
   Last week, Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa ordered the army to
dismantle the barricades.
   The army moved into the Kanesatake Mohawk settlement in Oka, 18
miles west of Montreal, Saturday afternoon after factional fighting
broke out between moderate and militant Mohawks. Two Indians were
hurt before the army moved in.
   When the soldiers pushed forward, only one shot was fired by a
Mohawk on Saturday, said army commander Lt. Col. Pierre Daigle.
There were no casualties.
   The dispute over the golf course expansion was solved when the
federal government purchased the land and said it would give it to
the Indians.
   But the Mohawks seized the situation to publicize a much wider
range of grievances, including demands for sovereignty, and their
campaign caused numerous brief sympathy blockades across Canada.
   One week ago, provincial authorities gave the military the
go-ahead to end the armed standoff that began July 11 when the
Quebec provincial police attempted to storm the Mohawk barricade at
Oka. One officer was killed in that assault, but it is still not
clear by whose gunfire.

security and ``assure the integrity of Iraq,'' the Rev. Jesse
Jackson said today.
   Jackson returned from Iraq on Sunday with 47 freed American
hostages after he met for six hours with Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein.
   The civil rights leader and former Democratic presidential
aspirant urged President Bush to pursue a diplomatic solution to
reverse Iraq's takeover of Kuwait and cautioned against relying
solely on military pressure.
   ``Just as our generals are in Saudi Arabia with a military
presence, our politicians should be as evident in seeking
diplomatic solutions,'' he said on NBC-TV's ``Today.''
   Jackson, who met with Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan as well as
the Iraqi president, said a diplomatic solution must ``regain the
sovereignty of Kuwait, assure the security of Saudi Arabia and
assure the integrity of Iraq.'' He called for an end to the
``drum-beating hostile rhetoric.''
   Jackson, in an interview on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,''
said he challenged Saddam on his takeover of Kuwait, saying the
annexation and his threats against Saudi Arabia were errors.
   If war breaks out over the crisis, Jackson said, innocent people
will be killed and oil wells destroyed.
   Asked to respond to criticism that he was exploiting the
hostages' plight for his own political gains, he said, ``Suffice it
to say, blessed are the peacemakers, even when they are beguiled.''
   Jackson said he rejects the idea that Saddam's annexation of
Kuwait is the only problem in the crisis and that only a military
solution will work to resolve it.
   Jackson went to the Middle East with a journalistic team and
said he plans a series of broadcast reports on the crisis.

   U.N. chief Javier Perez de Cuellar says he's deeply disappointed
by Iraq's intransigence in two days of talks, and Baghdad is
starting to ration food and promising that Iraqis will ``eat mud''
before yielding to foreign pressure.
   Perez de Cuellar said Sunday that diplomatic efforts to resolve
the month-old standoff between Iraq and U.S.-led multinational
forces in the Persian Gulf should now be turned to the weekend
superpower summit in Finland.
   The first beneficiaries of tentative moves toward diplomacy in
the crisis returned to freedom Sunday in the first major airlift of
Western captives from Iraq. Some had been held at strategic Iraqi
sites to deter any U.S. attack.
   Despite attempts to find a peaceful solution to the crisis
Iraq's Saddam Hussein precipitated by having his troops seize
oil-rich Kuwait on Aug. 2, the Baghdad government seemed to be
settling in.
   It appeared intent on waiting out the roughly 100,000 American
troops now positioned in Saudi Arabia and on U.S. ships in the
region.
   But the round-the-clock deployment was continuing. Five U.S.
amphibious-warfare ships transited the Suez Canal today en route to
the gulf region to join the multinational armada.
   In order to withstand a U.N.-imposed economic embargo, Iraq
announced Sunday that it would begin rationing food. There have
been reports of food shortages in Iraq, although Iraqi government
spokesman Naji al-Hadithi has denied those claims.
   It was not immediately clear when the rationing would begin.
Some sources said it was to have begun over the weekend, but a
Baghdad shopkeeper said he was told the plan would take effect on
Wednesday.
   ``We have a war-tested society. We have a war-tested economy. So
even if we eat mud, we will resist pressure and not kneel down to
any foreign power,'' al-Hadithi told a news conference. Iraq's
8-year-war with Iran ended in 1988.
   Iraq appeared in no hurry to compromise on its Aug. 6 annexation
of Kuwait, or on its policy of holding thousands of Westerners as
hostages.
   After seven hours of meetings with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz in Jordan, Perez de Cuellar said he was ``deeply
disappointed'' because he had expected ``a certain flexibility'' on
the part of Iraq.
   ``What Iraq wants is to stay in Kuwait, which is unacceptable to
the international community, to the U.N. Security Council and to
its secretary-general,'' Perez de Cuellar told reporters Sunday in
Paris after arriving from Amman, Jordan.
   Perez de Cuellar's negotiations were the only direct talks held
with the Iraqi leadership since the early days of the crisis.
   The U.N. chief said he still held out hope that Iraq would
become more accommodating. ``I am available,'' he said. ``If, at
any given time, they wish to modify their position, I will be
delighted to listen to them.''
   The only major public talks on the Persian Gulf crisis now
scheduled are the Helsinki summit on Sunday between President Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The European Commission announced today that the foreign
ministers of the 12 European Community nations will meet in Rome on
Friday to discuss the crisis in the gulf. It will be their second
such meeting since the invasion.
   The superpower summit in Helsinki does not raise many hopes for
a speedy resolution.
   ``We have to settle down for a long haul, which will require a
good deal of steady determination on the part of all concerned,''
said British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.
   Hurd was in Yemen today, the fourth stop in a tour of the gulf
region. Yemen remains a weak link in the embargo, and Yemenis have
been demonstrating in the streets to display support for Saddam.
   In Bangladesh, at least 50 people, including six policemen, were
reported hurt today in a demonstration protesting the dispatch of
Bangladesh troops to the gulf, United News of Bangladesh reported.
   In Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, on Sunday, House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt said a lengthy U.S. military presence in Saudi
Arabia might strain the American public's patience but that time
will be a worse enemy for Saddam.
   ``There's a patience problem on the Iraqi side as well,'' said
Gephardt, D-Mo., who led a congressional delegation in a visit to
U.S. troops. ``It's the world against him _ it's not the world
against us.''
   But the standoff was taking its toll on the skeleton staffs of
embassies in Kuwait that are resisting Iraqi orders to close. At
the U.S. mission, diplomats were breaking up furniture for firewood
and boiling water from the swimming pool to drink, said a
photographer accompanying the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
   The U.S. Embassy, like many other missions in Kuwait, has had
its power and water cut by the Iraqis for defying the closure order.
   The photographer, freelancer D. Michael Cheers, traveled to
Kuwait and Baghdad with Jackson, who helped secure the release of
some American captives.
   Perez de Cuellar indicated that the Iraqi foreign minister gave
some indication of possible movement on the issue of foreign
embassies in Kuwait.
   ``Tariq Aziz promised me to do something, to display some
flexibility ... to avoid diplomats' expulsion,'' he said on French
television. But he added: ``I regarded it as unlikely.''
   Former hostage Lloyd Culbertson, 76, who had been among those
trapped in the U.S. Embassy compound in Kuwait, said today the
situation at the mission is ``deteriorating daily.''
   ``The food is spoiling. There is no electricity,'' Culbertson
said on CBS ``This Morning.'' ``We have no means of communicating
with other people. Our ambassador is not allowed to talk with other
ambassador or to American citizens. He can't leave the compound.''
   A diplomatic source in Brussels said on Sunday that the East
German ambassador to Kuwait was picked up by Iraqi authorities and
taken to Baghdad. He had ventured out of his embassy to visit the
West German mission.
   Jackson accompanied 300 Westerners _ mostly women and children _
on an Iraqi Airways Boeing 747 plane that carried them out of Iraq
and stopped in Paris, London and Washington. The plane left Baghdad
on Saturday along with two other planeloads of foreigners.
   For most of those freed, joy upon reaching safety was muted by
fears for husbands and fathers left behind. Bonnie Anderton of
Denver got out with her daughter Jennifer, 10, but Jennifer's
father, Richard, remained behind.
   They were among 47 weary Americans arriving at Dulles
International Airport outside Washington earlier Sunday.
   At Tokyo's international airport, 68 Japanese women and children
arriving on a Japan Air Lines flight were greeted by tearful
relatives and friends.
   A Lufthansa plane with 250 women and 61 children on board _
including 60 Americans and 71 Germans _ landed early Sunday in
Frankfurt, West Germany.
   The airlifts came after Saddam, in what he called a humanitarian
gesture, announced last week that women and children among the
foreign captives would be allowed to leave Iraq.
   However, the departure of others was apparently delayed Sunday
as Iraq withheld landing clearance for two special flights from
Britain and France.
   Western governments have demanded the release of all the
hostages, and denounced Iraq's footdragging in freeing the women
and children as promised.

   A young tourist from Utah was fatally stabbed on
a subway station platform after he intervened when muggers robbed
his father and punched his mother, police said.
   Brian Watkins, 22, of Provo, Utah, was in New York with his
family for the U.S. Open tennis tournament on Sunday when he was
attacked on a midtown subway platform, Transit Police spokesman
Sgt. Bob Valentino said.
   Watkins, along with his father, mother, 26-year-old brother and
his wife, ventured into the subway station at 53rd Street and
Seventh Avenue for a two-stop ride to a station near the Tavern on
the Green restaurant in Central Park.
   As the family waited on the northbound platform about 10:20
p.m., five young men, described as being between the ages of 16 and
20, approached. One brandished a knife, sliced open the father's
pants and took a money clip containing about $200 and some credit
cards, Valentino said.
   ``During the robbery, one of the assailants punched the mother
in the face and the two sons interceded,'' Valentino said. The
victim was stabbed during the fight.
   The robbers fled, Valentino said. Three men were questioned
early today, but no immediate arrests were made, police said.
   Watkins was the 18th homicide victim in the New York subway
system this year, Valentino said. The system moves more than 3
million riders a day.

   President Bush is returning to
Washington for a hectic few days of preparation before his third
summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   As aides scrambled to work out logistics and prepare an agenda
for the hastily called summit, Bush today was concluding a
three-week vacation in Maine that he took under the cloud of the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   He returns to Washington two days after announcing that he would
meet with the Soviet leader in Helsinki next Sunday.
   Meanwhile, administration officials said today that details are
still being worked out on the upcoming summit _ including the
possiblity of extending it by one day so that Bush can meet with
Finish President Mauno Koivisto.
   Deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk said that such a courtesy
session would likely come on Saturday, and that it could mean that
the president would leave for Helsinki on Friday instead of on
Saturday.
   Bush spent Sunday hosting his longtime friend, evangelist Billy
Graham, at his seaside vacation home. The pair went to two churches
for morning services.
   ``These are rather trying times and right now I would suggest we
get our strength from being one nation under God,'' Bush told the
congregation at the First Congregational Church.
   Officials said Bush's one-day summit with Gorbachev will likely
entail about five hours of talks, focusing on the Persian Gulf
crisis. They said the two men would also discuss conventional arms
reduction talks between the two nations and regional issues,
including Cambodia and Afghanistan.
   The president said he was pleased with Soviet cooperation on a
number of global issues.
   ``I think it is important at this juncture that we discuss
issues not just as they relate to Europe and try to update where we
can on these arms negotiations, but also to discuss the Middle
East,'' the president said.
   On the Persian Gulf, one official said of the two superpowers:
``We're comparing notes. We would be explaining where we think the
situation is, where we would go.''
   Side meetings between aides are not planned for this summit,
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Such
sessions usually are standard during summit meetings.
   Another official described the one-day session as more an
``informal meeting'' between the two leaders.
   On the subject of conventional arms talks, one official said the
two leaders discussion ``would just be a review'' of the continuing
negotiations to reduce Soviet and U.S. troop strength in Europe.
   Bush has said he does not expect the Soviet Union to mediate
between Iraq and the United States. But the administration would
welcome any pressure Gorbachev can bring against Iraq, a longtime
recipient of Soviet arms.
   Bush said he has not spoken to Gorbachev since Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2. He said he has not telephoned Gorbachev _
something he has done to many other world leaders _ ``Because I had
anticipated seeing him.''
   Bush proposed the meeting to Gorbachev a week ago. He held his
proposal so closely that several top White House staff members did
not know about it when they were in the Soviet Union last week.
   They were there with White House Chief of Staff John Sununu at
Gorbachev's request to explain the technical workings of the U.S.
executive branch. Sununu was informed of the arrangements for the
summit meeting but was not a key player in setting it up, aides
said.
   White House staff members met Sunday to begin working on
logistical details and plans for contacting their Soviet
counterparts.
   ``Everybody's scrambling to put their pieces together,'' one
official said.
   Sig Rogich, who oversees White House advance logistics and
imagemaking, ended his vacation early on Sunday to coordinate the
planning.
   Sununu was driving his family back to Washington from his home
state of New Hampshire on Sunday, a day after his arrival from the
Soviet Union.
   Bush's wife, Barbara, and Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, also will
travel to Helsinki.

   Americans freed from the U.S. Embassy in
Kuwait, after weeks as virtual prisoners of Iraqi soldiers outside
the walls, say the comrades they left behind face mounting hunger,
thirst and weariness.
   As the 47 Americans arrived Sunday, the few who met with
reporters painted a grim picture of life inside the eight-block
compound just across a six-lane highway from a Persian Gulf beach.
   Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Mohamed al-Mashat, who
met the former hostages at Washington-Dulles International Airport
on Sunday, told them, ``I come to welcome our guests here.''
   His remarks got a cold shoulder.

   Saddam Hussein has a fleet of more than
150 transport aircraft, including airliners plundered from Kuwait,
that could be used to beat the United Nations-ordered embargo on
trade with Iraq.
   But aviation experts stress that any attempt at airborne
blockade-busting is fraught with difficulties and dangers, for both
sides.
   They note, too, that an airlift would likely be little more than
a gesture of defiance because it could never carry enough supplies
to feed Iraq's 17 million people or enough military materiel to
make a serious difference in Saddam's confrontation with the West.
   ``The sheer amount of cargo that would be needed to resupply a
whole country by air is mind-boggling,'' said Don Kerr of London's
International Institute for Strategic Studies.

   Investigators on Sunday also said they reduced their list of

   The slayings have terrorized the campus, where students are on a

   The countdown began today for NASA's
third attempt to launch Columbia with the Astro observatory after
engineers solved the latest problem to befall the mission.
   Liftoff is scheduled for 1:20 a.m. EDT Thursday. It will be the
first shuttle launch in more than four months _ the longest gap
between missions since flights resumed following the 1986
Challenger disaster.
   ``It's been a long, hot summer, and we're just glad to be
getting back into the flight business,'' said NASA spokesman Dick
Young. The shuttle fleet had been temporarily grounded after
hydrogen leaks were discovered on two of the three orbiters,
including Columbia.
   NASA decided on a Thursday launch after re-establishing full
contact with the X-ray telescope inside Columbia's cargo bay. The
telescope is one of four that constitute the $150 million Astro
observatory.

   Thirty-seven of those convicted for S&amp;L crimes since Oct. 1,
1988, have not been jailed. But the 128 who received prison
sentences got an average of 3.2 years, according to department
statistics.
   That compares to an average 2.5 years for all federal fraud
cases, including embezzlement and forgery, according to a study
compiled last year by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice
Statistics. That study used figures from 1987, the most recent year

   The dollar rose against most major foreign
currencies Monday and gold prices were higher in thin trading.
   In Frankfurt, dealers said they did not want to get caught
without dollars in their portfolios if fighting broke out in the
Gulf.
   One noted that United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar failed to make any diplomatic progress this weekend in
talks to mediate the dispute.
   But a London trader said there was no fundamental reason for the
dollar's rise.
   ``There have been no large positions taken and nothing has
changed. It's just a lack of fresh ideas,'' he said.
   Without any fundamental news to guide the market, dealers said
most of the week would be spent predicting the outcome of Friday's
U.S. employment figures.
   But, the August jobs data will likely confirm other numbers
suggesting a slowdown in the U.S. economy, traders said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 143.55 Japanese yen from
144.50 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 143.54
yen.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8730 from $1.8900 late
Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday:
1.5837 German marks, up from 1.5758; 1.3158 Swiss francs, up from
1.3075; 5.3080 French francs, up from 5.2825; 1.7840 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.7685; 1,179.00 Italian lire, up from 1,169.00,
and 1.1535 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1552
   Bullion dealers said the Labor Day holiday in the United States,
where financial markets were closed Monday, and a lack of new
developments in the Gulf standoff left dealers with little to trade
on and markets were quiet.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $387.00 a troy ounce,
up from $384.45 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid of $387.50, up from
$384.00 bid late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.11 to close at a bid $386.61.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $4.83 a

   The foreign ministers of the European Community
nations plan to meet in Rome Friday to discuss the Gulf crisis and
U.S. President George Bush's appeal for more financial aid in
confronting Iraq, authorities said Monday.
   The 12-member Community will use the meeting to signal its
positions to Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev before
the superpower summit, an official said.
   ``The voice of the Community will express itself Friday, before
the (U.S.-Soviet) meeting on Sunday,'' Italian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Giovanni Castellaneta told a briefing.
   The one-day meeting Friday will be held under the chairmanship
of Gianni De Michelis, the Italian foreign minister whose country
currently holds the EC's rotating chairmanship.
   Castellaneta said the ministers will discuss aiding countries
damaged by their participation in the U.N. trade embargo imposed on
Iraq after its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. He mentioned Jordan,
Turkey and Egypt in particular.
   He also said the ministers would be ``taking into account the
request of Bush'' for more financial support.
   Bush appealed last Thursday to allied countries to help pay for
part of the U.S. military deployment in the Gulf and to assist
nations hurt by the trade embargo against Iraq.

   The Labor Day holiday in the United States and the unsuccessful
end of talks between the United Nations secretary general and
Iraq's foreign minister kept trading light in major financial
markets Monday.
   Stock prices were down sharply on thin trading in Tokyo, London
prices rose slightly and in Frankfurt stocks were down a bit also
on light trading.
   ``If there is the slightest bit of news, traders are poised to
begin selling,'' Kazuhiro Nomura, a stock trader with New Japan
Securities Co. in Tokyo.
   The dollar started its day with a decline in Tokyo, closing at
143.55 yen, down 0.95 yen from Friday's close. Later Monday in
London, the dollar was up against most major currencies.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, the Tokyo exchange's most

   Northwest Airlines will take delivery from Airbus
Industrie of 75 commercial jets, and has taken out options on 30
more planes, the company said Monday.
   The deal, announced at the Farnborough Air Show, is worth $4.6
billion, said Northwest and Airbus, a consortium of European
aircraft manufacturers and engine makers.
   The order for delivery of 75 of the A320 jets confirms a
tentative order placed by Northwest in 1989.
   At that time, the airline made 25 firm orders and took 75 other
orders subject to confirmation on a series of dates through 1994.
   The options cover the A321, a stretch version of the A320,
scheduled to enter service in the first quarter of 1994.
   Northwest is Airbus' biggest customer.
   Airbus Industrie also announced Monday that the Australian
airlines, Ansett, had signed a contract for 10 A321s in a $350
million deal.

   Asiana Airlines has ordered 27 Boeing
jetliners and taken options on 24 more in a deal that could be
worth up to $6 billion, the South Korean carrier and Boeing Co.
announced Monday.
   The contract was signed by Asiana chairman Hwang In-sun and
Boeing Commercial Airplane Group president Dean Thornton at the
Farnborough International Airshow in Farnborough, England, Asiana
said.
   In becoming Boeing's latest multibillion-dollar customer, Asiana
placed firm orders for six 747-400 Passenger-Combies, three 747-400
freighters, 10 767-300s and eight 737-400s. That order is worth $3
billion.
   Asiana, which began operating only two years ago exclusively
with Boeing planes, also took options on nine more 747-400s, eight
767-300s and seven 737-400s.
   If all the options are filled, the total order of the 51 planes
would be worth $6 billion.
   The first delivery is scheduled in late 1991 and the last in
1999, Asiana said.
   The Seoul-based carrier said it ordered the planes with the
intention of expanding its international flights, which are now
limited to Japan. Asiana plans to add Taipei and Hong Kong later
this year and add Singapore, Bangkok and some U.S. points next year.
   Asiana, South Korea's second-largest airline after Korean Air,
currently operates a fleet of 10 737-400s and two 737-500s, all
under lease.

<HEAD>Corry Discussed Sale Of Steel Units, Paper Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. Chairman Charles A. Corry has
explored the possibility of selling the company's steel operations
to foreign investors in the last few months, according to a report
published Monday.
   Corry told The New York Times he would be willing to sell the
steel unit at the right price, but said he did not expect such a
sale to occur soon because of a weakness in the industry.
   ``The company has been growing in the energy business and
reducing its exposure to the steel business,'' Corry said. ``And
that will continue to be the trend.''
   The discussions, with British Steel PLC and others, came on the
heels of a USX effort to defeat a similar proposal made by New York
financier Carl C. Icahn, who holds a 13 percent stake in USX.
Shareholders rejected Icahn's plan in May.
   USX executives whom the Times did not identify said Icahn's move
made it clear to the company that there was increased sympathy for
splitting the steel business from energy interests. Icahn had
advocated issuing shares in separate companies upon a split and
said the value would grow afterward.
   An economic forecaster said Corry opposed Icahn's proposal
because ``he thought the timing was wrong'' last spring.
   ``The market was still headed downward during the Icahn
situation,'' said Christopher Plummer of the WEFA Group of
Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. ``And USX would not be in the best position to
sell assets.''
   USX, which owns Marathon Oil and Texas Oil and Gas, was known as
U.S. Steel until 1986.
   Analysts told the Times another possible purchaser of the USX
steel units is Pohang Iron and Steel Co. The South Korean company
operates a joint venture with USX in Pittsburg, Calif.
   Neither Pohang nor British Steel would comment on the matter.

   The Soviet Union, hungry for hard currency, is
reaping a windfall from higher oil prices and would like to
increase exports to take advantage of shortages caused by the
Mideast crisis. But it can't.
   The problem is an antiquated and long mismanaged Soviet
petroleum industry unable to boost production. It may, in fact,
yield 500,000 fewer barrels a day this year than last, Western
analysts say.
   The Soviet Union produced about 12.1 million barrels of oil a
day last year, a sixth of the world's total and more than Saudi
Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait combined.
   It exported 3.7 million barrels a day _ more than Iraq _ with
about half going to the West.
   ``They are producing at maximum capacity and their production is
declining. There's no way they can get increased production,'' said
John Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation.
   Not only is the Soviet industry unable to boost production, its
problems with nuclear reactors have added to the domestic demand.
The Soviet Union's appetite for oil is second only to the United
States.
   ``There's no way that they can take advantage of what's
happening in the market,'' said Robert Ebel, vice president for
international affairs for the Enserch Corp., an engineering and
construction company.
   Ebel and other U.S. experts acknowledge that the Soviets are
expected to gain hundreds of millions of dollars in additional hard
currency in the coming months if the higher oil prices stand.
   It's estimated that every $1 a barrel increase could mean $1
billion a year in additional hard currency for the Soviet economy.
Last year, oil exports brought $20 billion in hard currency into
the Soviet Union, accounting for about 40 percent of the country's
hard currency earnings.
   As oil prices began to climb after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,
Soviet oil bound for exports also became more valuable. A Moscow
business publication, Kommersant, estimated recently that the
worldwide jump in oil prices could increase Soviet hard currency
revenue by $750 million by the end of the year.
   Some Western analysts suggested the increase could be twice that.
   If the Soviets export 1.3 million barrels a day to the West and
prices continue to hover at $25 a barrel, compared with $16 a
barrel before the Iraqi crisis, they stand to gain $1.5 billion in
additional hard currency this year.
   The Soviets also have said they want Eastern block countries,
where the other half of Soviet oil exports are sent, to begin
paying in hard currency next year, according to U.S. oil experts.
   But the Soviet windfall will be muted by declining production
that also will force down exports. Production at its Mammoth field
on the edge of Siberia reportedly has declined by one-fourth since
1988.
   Based on performance over the first seven months of the year,
the Soviets may average only 11.6 million barrels a day in 1990,
compared with 12.14 million barrels a day in 1989.
   ``That's a rather dramatic drop,'' said Ebel, the Enserch
executive and former U.S. intelligence expert. ``For what they have
to sell to the West, they're going to get more money. But the
amount of oil is going to be less.''
   Soviet oil reserves are estimated to be more than 60 billion
barrels, twice that of the United States. And the Soviets are
wooing Western petroleum companies in the hope of expanding
exploration and improving production facilities plagued by years of
mismanagement, outdated equipment, deteriorating pipelines and a
shortage of money for capital improvements.
   In the past, the Soviets shied away from seeking out foreigners
in developing its vast oil reserves. Even when oil prices were
declining, the Soviet government poured large amounts of funds into
oil development and boosted production. Revenue from oil exports
pumped up other areas of the economy.
   But the cost of exploration for Soviet oil has nearly tripled in
the last five years and the Kremlin last year began to reduce funds
for oil development.
   It also stepped up its search for outside technical assistance
and began negotiating possible joint exploratory ventures with
Western oil companies.
   Both Chevron Corp. and Texaco Corp. have reached preliminary
agreements with the Soviets on joint oil exploratory ventures. A
number of U.S. service companies also are involved in oil
exploration with the Soviets, as is Elf Aquitaine, France's largest
oil company.
   ``They want to get Western technology and capital,'' says
Lichtblau of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation. But, he adds, those new ventures are unlikely to have
an impact on production for years to come.
   ``They desperately need American technology and American
finances'' to boost oil exploration and production, said Henry
Shuler, a Soviet expert at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington.
   ``About all they can hope to do in the short to medium terms is
slow the rate (of oil production) decline.''

<HEAD>Drug Companies Offering Medicaid Discounts to Ward off Legislation</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Upjohn Co. and other pharmaceutical
firms are offering Medicaid discounts as they try to pre-empt
proposed legislation that would cap the cost of drugs sold to the
poor.
   Last week, Kalamazoo-based Upjohn followed other industry
leaders' discount offers by proposing a $1.35 rebate for each
Medicaid prescription filled with its drugs.
   ``I think it's a smart move to try to eliminate the need for
legislation,'' said Ronald Nordmann, an industry analyst with
Paine-Webber. ``It probably won't mean much in terms of losses,
either, since Medicaid sales represent only about 10 percent of the
market.''
   But there's a catch: Any state that accepts a company's discount
must offer all of the company's drugs to Medicaid patients, even
the expensive ones that some states now refuse. That's expected to
create virtual monopolies in some states by knocking competing
drugs off reimbursement eligibility lists.
   Most of the largest drug companies have refused in the past to
offer the same discounts to Medicaid programs that they have given
to the departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs as well as
hospitals and large health maintenance organizations.
   But earlier this year, the U.S. Health and Human Services
Department said it wanted to cut 1991 Medicaid expenditures by $300
million, prompting a legislative proposal that would restrict the
drugs covered by Medicaid, thereby forcing competitive bidding by
drug companies.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., who introduced the bill, said it would
save between $100 million and $200 million each year. Congressional
hearings on the plan will be held in mid-September.
   The cost of drugs sold to Medicaid totals $3.5 billion a year.
   At least 19 state Medicaid programs have already limited the
drugs they offer poor patients, often excluding more expensive,
patented drugs, as a way to get the drug companies to negotiate.
Medicaid officials say drug prices are the fastest rising segment
of their programs.
   The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association is adamantly
opposed to legislation that would restrict access to any drug. It
says a federally mandated program for competitive bidding would
lead to inferior health care for the poor.
   ``Under the bill, manufacturers of chemically different drugs
that treat the same disease would be required to bid against each
other and the cheapest medicines _ which are almost always the
oldest ones _ would win the bid,'' association spokesman Jeff
Trewhitt said Friday.
   ``Medicaid patients would be deprived of some medicines and in
many cases would be getting second-class care.''
   Trewhitt said many medical groups and advocacy groups for the
poor are also opposed to the legislation. The association has
remained silent on the individual companies' discount plans.
   Pryor, chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, said
last week that the current discount plans _ offered by Merck &amp; Co.,
Pfizer Inc., Glaxo Inc. and Upjohn _ aren't good enough.
   ``While I commend these four companies for offering national
proposals, the savings for Medicaid and the safeguards to assure
these savings are just not there,'' Pryor said.
   Merck, which has agreed to offer states the same discounts it
gives other health care providers, has already signed up about 20
states. Upjohn, which announced its plans more than three months
later, has signed up just Maryland so far.
   While the discounts could cost the participating companies a
significant amount in the short run, analysts say those losses
could be more than made up over time if the companies win enough
Medicaid contracts.

<TEXT>
   When Franklin D. Roosevelt told a nation mired in
the Depression that ``the only thing we have to fear is fear
itself,'' he was talking about the kind of economic fright that
turns rumors into reality.
   Bank of New England got a taste of just what kind of damage
false rumors can do in a nervous economic climate last week, when
talk hit Wall Street that federal regulators were preparing for a
takeover.
   Area economists said Massachusetts' souring economy _ and the
recent spate of federal bank takeovers nationwide _ have given
rumors a potency they might not hold in better times.
   ``I do think that the bad news sometimes can be cumulative and
indeed feeds on itself,'' said Wayne Ayers, chief economist at the
Bank of Boston.
   James Howell, a former Bank of Boston economist who now runs his
own consulting firm, agreed that rumors thrive during a faltering
economy.
   ``When things begin to turn sour there is sort of a notion that
`I hope the bad things that are happening to other people won't
happen to me.' Therefore, I respond to rumor as if some of it or
all of it may be fact,'' he said.
   In the Bank of New England flap, a congressional candidate gave
the rumor a substantial push. Democratic hopeful Ted Dimauro faxed
a statement to news organizations lamenting the supposed federal
takeover.
   The bank has been struggling to recover from a downturn in the
state's economy _ especially from a decline in the real estate
market _ and has operated under federal scrutiny since early this
year.
   Federal officials issued strong statements that reports of the
bank's demise were wrong. But there was some damage. Bank of New
England's stock plunged 38.5 percent to $1 a share Thursday on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   ``The problem is that irresponsibility like this press release
can kill a bank,'' Ellen Stockdale, a spokeswoman for the
Comptroller of the Currency in Washington, which regulates
federally chartered banks, said after Dimauro's statement appeared.
   Dimauro later apologized, blaming an aide for releasing a
statement without his final approval. And the bank's stock more
than doubled the next day, rising $1.12{ to $2.12{.
   The incident highlights just how jittery investors and others
watching the market have become. In particular, it demonstrates an
uncertainty about banks sparked by the savings and loan crisis and
the recent spate of bank failures nationwide. Banks traditionally
are considered conservative, reliable financial institutions.
   ``For the first time since 1933 ... people are wondering whether
or not they have their savings or deposits in the right bank, the
one that will not fail,'' Howell said. ``That is the most
significant change in thinking in the post-World War II period.''
   Howell and Ayers agreed that the recent problems in the banking
industry have been sparked, in part, because there are too many
banks, and the industry is adjusting.
   There are between 13,000 and 14,000 commercial banks in the
country, and about 4,500 savings banks, they said.
   ``We don't need any of the 4,500. Period. You can just mark them
off,'' Howell said.
   Rumors may threaten to become self-fulfilling prophecies until
the economy levels off, Ayers said.
   ``I think a lot will depend on the health of the economy,'' he
said. ``I think if we can sidestep recession nationally, these
rumors, this falloff in confidence, will gradually arrest itself.''
