   Convicted killer Winford Stokes was executed
by lethal injection Friday night for strangling and stabbing a
woman to death 12 years ago.
   Both the U.S. Supreme Court and the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in St. Louis denied last-ditch requests to block the
execution Friday.
   Stokes, 39, was pronounced dead at 9:39 p.m. CDT after receiving
separate lethal doses of sodium pentathol, Pavlon and sodium
chloride at the Potosi Correctional Center.
   He lifted his head to look at the IV bag as the first chemical
was being injected at 9:35 p.m. CDT, blinked his eyes rapidly and
lay back on the gurney.
   Stokes had no last words and had asked for no personal witnesses.
   ``Justice has been served. This regrettable event is necessary
to reaffirm the value the state of Missouri places on innocent
human life,'' Gov. John Ashcroft said in a prepared statement.
   Stokes was sentenced to death after being convicted of capital
murder in the February 1978 strangling and stabbing of 33-year-old
Pamela Benda of University City, outside St. Louis. Authorities
said Stokes, who had escaped from a mental hospital, killed Benda
after meeting her in a bar and going home with her to have sex.
   He also has served time for the 1977 slaying of an elderly St.
Louis woman and the fatal shooting of a St. Louis tavern owner in
1969.
   Stokes' wife, Evette, met with the condemned man for most of the
afternoon but left the prison shortly after 6 p.m., said Dale
Riley, prison spokesman.
   The full 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had refused Friday
morning to lift the stay. Attorney General William Webster promptly
turned to the Supreme Court.
   Even while the stay was in effect, prison officials continued to
prepare for the execution. Stokes ordered another last meal, his
second in two days.
   Riley said Stokes ordered catfish, french fries, cole slaw and a
two-liter bottle of Pepsi. He had had his first last meal of
sirloin steak, wild rice and Pepsi on Thursday.
   The Supreme Court issued its ruling lifting the stay about 7:15
p.m. CDT, and Sindel promptly asked both the 8th Circuit and the
Supreme Court to issue a second stay based on other arguments. Both
courts refused.
   An opinion concurring in the decision was signed by Justice
Anthony Kennedy, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and Justice
Antonin Scalia.
   Justice William Brennan was joined in a dissenting opinion by
Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun.
   Justice John Paul Stevens also dissented.
   Earlier Friday, another three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit
refused to lift the stay. That order was appealed to the full 8th
Circuit.
   Stokes' attorney, Richard Sindel, said U.S. District Judge
George Gunn Jr. granted the stay Wednesday on the basis of
arguments contending Stokes' trial court failed to differentiate
between felony murder and capital murder in its instructions.
   He was the third convict in Missouri and the 125th nationally to
be executed since the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing
states to resume use of the death penalty.

<HEAD>Sudanese Rebels Claim Capture of Nile Town</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In what would be a major victory for
Sudanese rebels, leaders said they captured the town of Melut,
defeated its army garrison and controlled traffic on the White Nile
river between two major towns.
   The capture would mark one of the Sudan People's Liberation
Army's northernmost advances in more than seven years of civil war.
   The Sudanese government has made no mention of fighting in
Melut, 350 miles south of the capital of Khartoum. There was no
independent confirmation of the report.
   In a clandestine radio broadcast monitored in Nairobi, the rebel
movement said it overran Melut on Thursday in an assault that began
the day before.
   ``The garrison has been wiped out and remnants are being mopped
up,'' the broadcast said.
   It said the city's capture ``is important to us because we now
control river transportation'' between the towns of Renk and
Malakal.
   Melut is roughly 100 miles from both Malakal to the south and
Renk to the north.
   The mainly Christian and animist rebels launched their rebellion
in early 1983, demanding greater autonomy and economic reforms in
the three southern provinces of Bahr el-Ghazal, Upper Nile and
Equatoria. The rebels claim discrimination by the government,
dominated by Moslems from the north.

<HEAD>Boeing Jet With Star Wars Sensor Makes First Test Flight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Boeing 767 jet outfitted with a ``Star Wars''
sensor designed to scan large areas of space and simultaneously
track hundreds of targets took its first test flight Friday.
   The modified 767 carried the world's most sophisticated
long-wave infrared sensor on a six-hour test flight about 45,000
feet above several western states.
   A crew of 17 Boeing and Hughes Aircraft Co. personnel checked
how in-flight vibration and sound will affect the sensor, contained
in an 86-foot-long cupola over the front half of the plane.
   Three months of flight testing over the continental United
States will be followed by tests using Air Force targets at
Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific Ocean.
   The project, called the Airborne Optical Adjunct-Airborne
Surveillance Testbed, is to determine if long-wave infrared sensors
can provide early warning and tracking of enemy ballistic missile
warheads by sorting them from decoys and debris.
   The program is intended to test sensor technology rather than
develop a prototype for an operational system.
   It is managed by the U.S. Army Strategic Defense Command for the
Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars.
   The program has already cost $600 million and will reach $700
million if it continues as planned until 1992, Col. Gary Stewart of
the Army Strategic Defense Command in Huntsville, Ala., said
Thursday.
   Steward said the program is two years behind schedule and well
above original cost estimates of $450 million to $500 million.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of an American convicted of spying for
Israel says she is sick and destitute, and accused the Israeli
government of abandoning her.
   Jonathan Pollard, a former U.S. Navy analyst, was sentenced to
life in prison in 1987 for supplying classified U.S. documents to
Israel. His wife, Anne Henderson Pollard, was sentenced to two
concurrent five-year terms for helping him. She was released six
weeks ago.
   ``I mean, my God, I gave up 40 months of my life to go to prison
over this. (The Israeli government) did absolutely nothing for
me,'' Mrs. Pollard, 29, said in an interview Friday with Israel
radio from the United States. The report did not give her exact
location.
   Mrs. Pollard denied published reports she and her husband
received a monthly stipend of $5,000 from Israel.
   ``If that was true, why am I sitting here in destitution, unable
to even afford a residence, a closet. I have no money ... there is
no money forthcoming,'' she said.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yossi Amihud refused to comment on
Mrs. Pollard's accusations.
   Israeli officials have denied reports about the monthly stipend,
but a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said last year
the government was working to have the couple freed on humanitarian
grounds.
   Mrs. Pollard said she had not visited her husband since her
release becaus she is too ill and too broke to travel. Jonathan
Pollard, 35, is in a federal prison in Marion, Ill.
   Mrs. Pollard, who complained of stomach pain throughout her
prison stay, said she also suffers from nerve, eye and skin
disorders.

<HEAD>Former Nazi SS Officer Arrested On Visa Violation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man identified on an immigration computer list
as a former Nazi SS officer was charged in federal court Friday
with failing to disclose his Nazi past when applying for a U.S.
visa.
   Joseph Aloysius Goertz, 76, traveling on a visa issued in
Stuttgart, West Germany, was ordered held without bail following
arraignment before U.S. Magistrate Bert S. Tokairin, who scheduled
a detention hearing for Tuesday.
   Goertz is in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service officials and will be given a medical examination after
complaining of a heart condition, said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Michael Burke.
   It was not known how Goertz managed to get a visa without
disclosing his Nazi affiliation, said Oscar Villa, an INS inspector.
   Goertz was arrested by immigration officers Tuesday after
arriving at Honolulu International Airport on a flight from New
Zealand, officials said.
   His Nazi affiliation was discovered when his name came up on an
INS computer that lists past and present members of the Nazi Party.
Burke said.
   Goertz told immigration inspectors he had been forced to join
the SS at the end of 1943 and remained a member until the end of
World War II in May 1945, officials said.
   However, a check of documents captured by U.S. forces in 1945
showed Goertz had been a member since he was 18 years old, joining
the party in 1932, and was an SS storm trooper until 1934,
according to the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Special
Investigation (OSI).
   Goertz then joined the SS political branch and in 1935 joined
the intelligence unit, according to the OSI.
   ``OSI believes that this group dealt with spying for the SS
leadership on `opponents of the regime,'' that is, Jews, gypsies
and others,'' Villa said in court documents.
   Former or current affiliation with the Nazi party makes a
foreigner ineligible for a U.S. visa without a special waiver,
Burke said.

   The late teen rocker Ritchie Valens, whose
life was portrayed by actor Lou Diamond Phillips in the movie ``La
Bamba,'' has been honored with a posthumous star on the Hollywood
Walk of Fame.
   The Valens star, the 1,913th dedicated along the celebrated
walkway, was the first given to a Hispanic rock 'n' roll star.
   ``Ritchie left a legacy of love,'' said Phillips, who joined
members of Valens' family and about 400 fans at Friday's unveiling
on Hollywood Boulevard.
   Valens became a 1950s sensation with the hits ``La Bamba'' and
``Donna,'' but died in a 1959 plane crash with rockers Buddy Holly
and J.P. ``The Big Bopper'' Richardson.
   ``Today, we lift a star higher into the heavens _ a star who
represents few of the known Hispanics in our community,'' said
actor Esai Morales, who was also in ``La Bamba.''
   Valens grew up as Richard Valenzuela in the San Fernando Valley
community of Pacoima, 15 miles north of downtown Los Angeles.

   Actor and wildlife conservationist Jimmy Stewart
toured the refurbished Zoo Atlanta and said why, it's a wonderful
zoo.
   Stewart, in town with his wife, Gloria, to attend a fund-raiser
for the zoo tonight, caused a stir as he moved through a crowd of
zoo visitors.
   Looking dignified in a grey suit, Stewart, 81, complimented Zoo
Atlanta, which six years ago was rated one of the worst in America
but now is under going an ambitious $50 million rejuvenation.
   ``The idea that you have here, what you're showing to people,
what you're showing the children, what you're showing everybody is
the wildlife of the world and the importance of conservation of
that wildlife,'' Stewart said.
   ``It's a wonderful thing to see,'' said the star of ``It's a
Wonderful Life'' and ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.''
   As Stewart looked at star gorilla Willie B., zoo Director Terry
Maple joked, ``You're the only primate I've seen who's more popular
than Willie B.''
   The actor gingerly handled a king snake and a rabbit displayed
in honor of the character in Stewart's 1950 film, ``Harvey.''
   Stewart credits his interest in wildlife issues to his wife, a
longtime friend of animals.

   Actor Don Johnson, who performed his own boating
stunts as Sonny Crockett on ``Miami Vice,'' said he plans to be on
familiar surf today.
   Johnson will appear with fellow actor Kurt Russell in the
Offshore Professional Tour race with Johnson driving and Russell
navigating their three-man, 50-foot catamaran in the 144-mile race.
   ``This is a very special occasion for me,'' Johnson said at a
news conference Friday. ``There's a part of me that's always going
to be with Miami, and a part of Miami that's always going to be
with me.''
   The $75,000 race will draw about 45 boats, including the tour's
biggest superboat driven by actor Chuck Norris, a newcomer to
offshore racing. The 50-foot catamaran, powered by four 585-cubic
inch fuel-injected engines, carried Norris to his first
professional victory April 14 in Long Beach, Calif.
   Johnson helped establish the OPT with the purpose of bringing
powerboat racing closer to the fans, and he says today's event
about 500 yards off shore will accomplish the goal.
   Johnson lives in Aspen, Colo., with his wife, actress Melanie

   The University of South Carolina has spent
more than $150,000 in salary and expenses for artist-in-residence
Robby Benson, and has unpaid bills from his recent movie, ``Modern
Love,'' a newspaper reported.
   The actor-director has a two-year contract to teach filmmaking
at the state-supported school's College of Humanities and Social
Sciences. His contract expires next week.
   Since 1988, the university has paid Benson $123,600 in salary,
and more than $30,000 for rent on his townhouse, utilities, travel
expenses and moving expenses, according to The State newspaper. The
newspaper obtained records from the school under the Freedom of
Information Act.
   The school also spent at least $28,000 on ``Modern Love,'' which
was filmed in Columbia and other location, and has yet to be
reimbursed for at least $21,000, the newspaper said Friday.
   School President James B. Holderman on Thursday defended Benson,
33, and the money spent on him but said he did not know whether the
actor's contract would be renewed after it expires Tuesday.
   ``I hope he will consider it,'' Holderman said.
   From its support for ``Modern Love,'' USC stands to receive
$25,000 and 2 percent of any profits.
   Benson, who lives here with his wife, actress-singer Karla
DeVito, and their daughter, Lyric, does not have a listed telephone
number and could not be reached for comment Friday night.
   He starred in ``Harry and Son'' ``Ice Castles'' and ``One on
One,'' and directed the film ``White Hot.''
   ``Modern Love'' was filmed for $1.5 million and stars Benson and
Burt Reynolds. It had a limited opening in April.

<HEAD>Naval Chief Hints at Possible Shift in Stance on Naval Arms Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is resisting Soviet
offers to cut tactical nuclear weapons at sea, but the Navy's top
admiral says such negotiations might be useful if the Soviets
accepted certain preconditions.
   The United States has long opposed arms control measures that
would limit the number of Navy ships or tactical weapons. And Adm.
Carlisle A.H. Trost, soon to retire as chief of naval operations,
told Congress on Friday he saw little prospect for change.
   Yet Trost said that under certain circumstances it might benefit
the United States to negotiate the elimination of short-range naval
nuclear arms. Arms in this category include anti-ship missiles,
depth bombs and torpedoes.
   ``Yes, it could be in our interests'' if the Soviets were
willing to also eliminate sea- and land-based aircraft assigned to
their naval fleets and if adequate measures were taken to guard
against cheating, Trost told the Senate Armed Services subcommittee
on projection forces.
   But Ronald Lehman, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency, testified that the administration is unwilling to consider
entering into negotiations on tactical nuclear weapons at sea. He
said it was doubtful that any such accord could include
satisfactory verification measures.
   ``We've come to the conclusion that now is not the time'' to
address the issue, he said.
   The top arms adviser to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev told the same subcommittee on Tuesday
that future talks on other categories of nuclear and conventional
weapons could be derailed by continued U.S. resistance to naval
arms talks.
   Lehman said that in current arms negotiations the Soviets had
not formally insisted on linking any agreements to future
discussions about naval nuclear arms.
   Gorbachev proposed at his last meeting with President Bush in
Malta last December that the superpowers undertake to negotiate
cuts in short-range naval nuclear arms, but the administration has
resisted.
   The United States has about 2,200 tactical nuclear weapons at
sea, compared with about 2,700 for the Soviets, according to
figures supplied by the subcommittee.
   Lehman said the elimination of tactical naval nuclear arms would
undermine the United States' traditional position as the
predominant naval force in the world, and it could hurt the
security of U.S. allies who depend on U.S. naval power.
   Trost, while expressing similar doubts, suggested that such
talks might be acceptable.
   ``If we could, with proper confidence in their willingness to
abide by an agreement, be sure there were no nuclear weapons that
threatened either side's ships at sea, I'm sure we'd both be more
comfortable that way,'' he said.
   Later, under questioning, Trost said he was referring only to
the tactical category of naval weapons, not to sea-based cruise or
ballistic missiles of longer range.
   ``Yes, it could be in our interests if all the `ifs' I
previously stated are included,'' he said. ``And you could label me
as a lifetime pessimist on the likelihood of ever concluding such
an agreement,'' he added quickly.
   Trost's description of an acceptable formula for negotiations to
eliminate short-range nuclear arms at sea appeared similar to that
offered Tuesday by Akhromeyev, who said his government was willing
to include related weaponry such as that carried on aircraft
carriers, submarines and land-based naval aircraft.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's ``Open Skies'' proposal to
lessen East-West tensions through aerial surveillance is snagged in
negotiations, and the State Department is blaming the Soviet Union
for the setback.
   In a statement Friday that confirmed reports from Budapest, the
site of the treaty talks, the department said several key issues
were in dispute.
   These include the territory to be overflown by unarmed aircraft
and the number of such surveillance flights.
   Today was the tentative deadline for signing the treaty.
   At least two other prospective East-West accords also are in
trouble.
   Treaties to curb U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear missiles and
to set lower troops ceilings in Europe have not been completed.
Negotiators are unable to settle their differences even under the
pressure of an approaching U.S.-Soviet summit.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is flying to Moscow on
Sunday night to try to overcome the impasse.
   Richard Boucher, a department spokesman, said the Soviets had
blocked agreement on most of the Open Skies issues because they
``favor a less intrusive regime.''
   Last year, when Bush reworked a proposal first made more than 30
years ago by President Eisenhower, Open Skies was promoted as a
U.S. contribution to ease East-West tensions.
   Bush was signaling his determination to match Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in overcoming Cold War suspicions.
   Last December, in Brussels, the 16 North Atlantic Treaty
Organization allies approved Bush's proposal to let unarmed Warsaw
Pact aircraft fly over their territory in search of military
activity.
   Then, in February, NATO and Warsaw Pact countries meeting in
Ottawa, Canada, agreed to set annual quotas for overflights and to
invite neutral nations to participate. Details were to be settled
in time for a treaty signing today.
   But the negotiations ``did not, as we had hoped they would,
reach agreement on an Open Skies treaty,'' Boucher said.
   ``Despite some progress, key issues remain to be decided,'' he
said.
   Among them were what sort of sensors would be permitted on the
overflying aircraft and the territory to be covered.
   The Soviets wanted to include non-participating countries in the
surveillance plan. There also was disagreement over how much
information would be shared between the two sides.
   The delay in concluding an Open Skies treaty is part of a
general slowdown on the arms control front.
   Negotiations in Vienna to reduce troops, tanks and other
non-nuclear weapons in Europe have stalled over aircraft,
helicopters and a system to verify compliance.
   Meanwhile, the United States and the Soviet Union are having
problems in Geneva trying to complete a treaty to reduce their
long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines.
   Baker hopes to reach an agreement in principle next week with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze for Bush and
Gorbachev to sign during their May 30-June 3 Washington summit.
Most observers rate his chances as poor.
   The talks, scheduled for Wednesday through Friday in Moscow,
have already been extended to Saturday _ a sign of the workload
facing Baker and Shevardnadze.
   However, Ronald Lehman, director of the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, told a Senate Armed Services subcommittee
Friday, ``We see no reason why we shouldn't be able to get an
agreement'' at the talks.
   The NATO allies saw an Open Skies treaty as a way to ensure
compliance with a troop-reduction accord. Each participating
country would have to permit at least one surveillance flight every
three months.
   The United States, the Soviet Union, Canada and the European
nations would participate.

<TEXT>
   Conservation groups say Interior Secretary
Manuel Lujan's call for re-examining protection of endangered
species is ``outrageous'' and recalls the Reagan administration's
pro-development policies toward the environment.
   Lujan sparked the criticism Friday after he was quoted as saying
that Congress should look at the federal law protecting endangered
species with an eye toward increasing its flexibility.
   Lujan cited as one example of how the Endangered Species Act
causes problems the controversy in Arizona over construction of a
$200 million telescope on a mountain inhabited by rare and
endangered red squirrels.
   ``Do we have to save every subspecies?'' Lujan suggested in an
interview Thursday with the Denver Post. ``The red squirrel is the
best example. Nobody's told me the difference between a red
squirrel, a black one or a brown one.''
   He said federal law protecting endangered species was ``just too
tough'' and added, ``We've got to change it.''
   In interviews with two other Colorado newspapers, Lujan vowed to
find a way to build the Animas-LaPlata water project in the state,
although its construction has been threatened by the endangered
squawfish. He said one option might be to move the fish elsewhere.
   As word of Lujan's comments circulated Friday, conservationists
reacted angrily.
   Michael Francis of the Wilderness Society said the remarks
showed ``Mr. Lujan's incredible lack of understanding of biology
and public policy.''
   ``I'd have to say he's getting pretty close to another Jim Watt.
... Mr. Lujan certainly is trying to better his mark,'' said
Francis, referring to the Reagan administration interior secretary
who was widely criticized by environmentalists for his
pro-development views.
   Jay Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation, said he
was incensed ``that the very Cabinet official whose job it is to be
the country's front-line protector of endangered wildlife would
make such outrageous statements.''
   Hair said the Mount Graham red squirrel _ the focus of attention
in the Arizona telescope dispute case _ ``is in the 11th hour of
existence on the planet.'' Fewer than 200 of the squirrels are left.
   Lujan's press secretary, Steve Goldstein, did not dispute the
quotes as reported. He said his boss had sought only to point out
some ``frustrations'' he has had with enforcing the Endangered
Species Act.
   Goldstein said Lujan wants Congress to re-examine when
subspecies should be protected under the federal law and what
protection should be afford when the same species exist in multiple
locations. He said Lujan does not believe those issues will weaken
the law.
   Conservationists and some members of Congress, however,
interpreted Lujan's comments as a clear attempt to weaken the law.
``Congress will strongly resist any attempt to weaken the

   While Lujan, a former Republican congressman from New Mexico,

   Former President Jimmy Carter and his wife,
Rosalynn, will lead a delegation of observers to the May 16
presidential elections in the Dominican Republic.
   The observers were invited by Froilan J.R. Tavares, president of
the Dominican Republic's Central Electoral Commission. The
Organization of American States also was sending a delegation.
   The delegates accompanying the Carters include Prime Minister
George Prince of Belize and Jennie Lincoln, associate director of
the Latin American Program at The Carter Center of Emory
University, according to a news release from the center.
   ``Our group will be accorded total access to the electoral
process,'' Carter said. ``This includes access to the polling sites
and permission to be present during the vote count.''
   Joaquin Balaguer, the blind, 82-year-old president, is seeking
his fifth term. He faces Juan Bosch, 80, the leftist former
president who has lost three elections to Balaguer but is favored
to win this time.

   A cab driver who pinned a mugger against a
wall with his car until police arrived has been sued by the robber,
who said he suffered a leg injury.
   Ocie J. McClure, 24, who is serving an 8-year sentence for
robbery, filed a $5 million personal injury suit against Holden C.
Hollom and Luxor Cab Co.
   ``His leg still has not healed,'' said James Rawlins, McClure's
attorney. ``My understanding from doctors is he'll never walk
correctly on that leg again.''
   Hollom, a part-time stunt driver who drove in the movie
``Bullit,'' said he chased McClure on May 2, 1989, after seeing him
knock a woman down and grab her purse.
   ``I yelled `Halt!' and rammed him against the wall of the corner
of the building'' at about 7 mph, Hollom said Friday.
   ``This was deadly force,'' said Rawlins. ``The police department
isn't allowed to use so much force.''
   Hollom's attorney, Joseph Breall, says the driver should be
``completely exonerated.''
   ``If you're being mugged, you would want people to step in to
help you,'' said Breall. ``It's an unfortunate situation in our
society when a mugger turns around and sues for personal injury.''
   Hollom said McClure walked to an ambulance after he was hit.
   ``I guess he's mad at me because I didn't send him a Mother's
Day card,'' the cabbie said.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II, concerned by the
growth of U.S.-based evangelical Protestant churches in Mexico,
pleaded with converts to return to the Roman Catholic faith that
shaped this country's modern history.
   ``The church awaits you with open arms to bring you back
together with Christ,'' John Paul said Friday, speaking to a
joyful, flag-waving crowd that topped 200,000. He spoke from an
altar atop a pyramid that resembled a Mayan temple.
   The pontiff was on the sixth day of an eight-day visit to
Mexico. Today he visits the provincial city of Zacatecas before
returning to Mexico City to address a gathering of intellectuals.
   The pope's homilies here and in Tuxtla Gutierrez, 90 miles to
the south, were directed to Mexico's Indians and reflected growing
alarm in the Vatican over the success of non-Catholic churches in
Latin America, particularly in Mexico.
   Protestant evangelical activity has been strongest in the
southeastern states of Tabasco, Chiapas and Oaxaca, as well as
across the border in Guatemala. Protestants have translated the
Bible into Indian tongues for the first time and found a receptive
audience among landless peasants and poor forced to migrate to
cities.
   Villahermosa is the capital of Tabasco, where an estimated 20
percent of the state's 1.4 million residents are non-Catholic _
twice the national average.
   ``I think again about those people who have distanced themselves
from the Catholic Church ... I would like to meet with each one of
you to say: return to the breast of the church, your mother!'' the
pope cried in his homily.
   In Tuxtla Gutierrez, the pope urged Mexico's downtrodden Indians
to fight to improve their lives.
   ``Don't be seduced by vices, like alcohol abuse, which causes so
many ravages, and don't cooperate with drug trafficking, which
causes destruction to so many people in the world,'' the pope told
a crowd of more than 150,000 in a field below Chiapas' misty green
mountains.
   The pope encouraged Indians not to ``lose hope in the face of
poverty or the continuous assalt on your cultural traditions.'' He
praised the traditional Indian emphasis on the paradise of the
afterlife, ``but you also have the obligation to improve your own
human situation.''
   John Paul also expressed concern for refugees fleeing political
persecution and death squads in Guatemala, which borders Chiapas
and Tabasco.
   The southeastern trip's main aim, however, was shoring up the
local Catholic Church in the face of competition. The churches
growing fastest in Mexico include Baptists, Jehovah's Witnesses,
Pentecostalists, Assembly of God and Mormons.
   Those who convert are often disenchanted with a political and
economic system that is destroying native culture and spreading
poverty and discrimination. Despite reform laws, many have lost
their communal lands to private farmers.
   The pontiff, wearing gold and red robes, said some people may
have turned to the evangelical churches because they felt ``more
welcome in a small group, among familiar people, who help each
other.''
   Others, he said, may have left the Catholic Church because of
``material worries'' _ an apparent reference to U.S.-based churches
that distribute aid among the Mexican poor, although most
proselytizing is now carried out by Mexican converts.
   In Tuxtla Gutierrez, John Paul addressed the crowd briefly in
two Indian tongues, Tzotzil and Zoque, drawing laughter when he
joked about his pronunciation. In Villahermosa, the pontiff tried
out Chontal and Cholco.
   Over six million of Mexico's 85 million citizens do not
understand Spanish, speaking only Mayan dialects or other Indian
tongues.
   Before the service in Tuxtla Gutierrez, John Paul prayed at the
cathedral and comforted the families of 28 pilgrims who died
Thursday in a plane crash while flying in to see the pope.
   ``Death is not the last word, because for those who have faith,
life does not end, it transforms itself,'' the pope said. He kissed
a cross on the coffin of Luis Miguel Canton Marin, the bishop of
Tapachula, who had worked closely with Indian groups.

<TEXT>
   Once again, students rioting in the
streets and angry workers jabbing fists in the air have marred
South Korea's public image and alarmed the government.
   For years, South Korea has been working hard to build an image
for itself as a safe, stable place to visit and invest. Its
economic boom has bolstered the picture of a strong, industrious
nation.
   Yet the South Korean government's popularity is at an all-time
low, and its export-fueled economy has sagged. Inflation is running
in double digits and the volatile stock market hit a two-year low.
   Foreign investors have besieged consultants, embassies, trade
offices and government ministries, seeking assurances of the
nation's stability.
   The latest wave of unrest has been sparked by workers, who are
demanding more rights and more say in management, and radical
students, who blame the government for a variety of troubles.
   In time-honored Korean fashion, complaints are registered with
protests, which often turn violent.
   Though the latest demonstrations have been far smaller than
those three years ago that forced electoral reforms, the government
is cracking down hard to save itself as well as its international
image.
   On Wednesday, about 100,000 students hurling firebombs and rocks
fought police in 17 cities, the largest anti-government protests
since 1987.
   Two weeks ago, tens of thousands of workers walked off their
jobs in sympathy after riot police charged into the nation's
largest shipyard and the state-run television network to end
strikes.
   So far this year, students and workers have not joined together.
But history suggests that an alliance of the two groups can have
grave results for governments.
   In 1987, protests by students and workers combined to force the
government to accept reforms. That eventually led to popular
elections for the presidency and the victory of Roh Tae-woo.
   In putting down this year's worker unrest, Roh's government
gambled that the labor turmoil would not become a wider political
issue. Wages have risen 50 to 60 percent in the last two years and
labor rights, not economics, were the workers' concern.
   Most workers returned to their jobs this week. But the
government's heavy-handedness in dealing with the workers angered
radical students, who have been accusing the Roh government for
months of being anti-reform and dictatorial.
   Students, dissidents and opposition politicians are also upset
about the merging of the ruling party with two opposition parties
earlier this year, which gave the government overwhelming control
of the National Assembly.
   Roh said the merger was needed for political and economic
stability, because parliamentary deadlocks had bogged down affairs
of state.
   Kim Dae-jung, leader of the opposition Party for Peace and
Democracy, said this week it was time for Roh ``to completely
revamp his thinking about everything in this country.''
   Kim said Roh should disband the new party, call new elections
and realize that labor and business problems cannot be solved with
a ``naked fist.''
   Roh's problems are reflected in a poll taken by his ruling
Democratic Liberal Party that indicated 88 percent of the voters
don't like the way things are going. Roh's popularity is at 12
percent, his lowest ever, the party said.
   But Roh said this week that things aren't so bad.
   ``The real problem is that a pervasive sense of anxiety is
making the situation more troublesome than it actually is,'' Roh
told a nationwide television audience.
   He acknowledged the economy was in trouble, but said it was
recovering. He admitted prices were up, but said inflation would
level off.
   Several Cabinet ministers held an unusual nationwide television
news conference aimed at showing government resolve to deal firmly
with violent protests.
   Prosecutors said student leaders and dissidents who incited
violence would be rounded up.
   The nation's newspapers, for their part, suggest that it's time
for both the demonstrators and the government to shape up.
   ``The performance of the Roh administration has not been very
satisfactory,'' said the Dong-a Ilbo newspaper. To the protesters
it advised: ``We must achieve solid democratic reforms only through
legal methods ... even if this may be rather time-consuming.''

<HEAD>Senate Leaders to Seek Possible Compromise of Rival Bills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate leaders will meet next week to explore
chances of reaching a compromise on widely contrasting bills that
would overhaul the way political campaigns are financed.
   Competing Republican and Democratic versions were brought Friday
to the Senate floor, where members of both parties spent most of
the day proclaiming that the other's version would only heighten
public cynicism about politics.
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, accused Republicans of
trying ``to open the floodgates to wealthy individuals financing
federal elections with almost unlimited money.''
   Democrats said the Republican bill would raise the amount that
wealthy individuals can now contribute openly to candidates and
their parties from $25,000 currently to more than $340,000 annually.
   GOP senators countered that Democratic-proposed spending
ceilings and partial public financing would preclude challengers
from raising funds needed to overcome incumbent lawmakers' name
recognition and freeze private business out of politics.
   ``You can bet the house that the American people are not
interested in the taxpayer financing of politicians,'' said
Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   Mitchell expressed a faint hope that a package agreeable to both
parties and President Bush could be drafted by the end of next week
after he and other Senate leaders meet. Dole suggested it will take
longer.
   ``No one should expect any miracles,'' Dole said. ``It's going
to take a lot of give and take on both sides. We are not close to
anything yet.''
   The biggest stumbling block will be the proposed ceilings on how
much candidates can spend. While expressing a willingness to
negotiate competing proposals on virtually every other issue,
Democrats insist that any compromise will have to include a
spending lid.
   ``A diet is no good without a limit on calories; likewise,
campaign reform is not real without a limit on cash,'' said Sen.
Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. ``Only spending limits will get the money
chase under control.''
   The proposed spending ceilings in the Democratic bill range from
$1.8 million in small states such as Wyoming and Alaska up to $9.6
million for the largest state, California, but Democrats are not
wedded to the specific amounts.
   But the notion of any ceiling is abhorrent to at least a
majority of the Senate's 45 Republicans. They rejected a bipartisan
task force's suggestion for a flexible ceiling, with limits on
out-of-state contributions but no lid on how much a candidate could
raise in small amounts from in-state residents.
   The recommendations of the task force, which was appointed by
Mitchell and Dole, also were a little too flexible for Democrats,
who still want a lid on in-state contributions.
   The Republicans' top objectives are to abolish or at least
greatly limit the role of special-interest political action
committees in campaigns and the estimated $45 million in unreported
expenditures by unions in get-out-the-vote drives aimed primarily
at benefiting Democrats.
   Democrats, sensing a vulnerability on the PAC issue, have
revised their proposal to include a ban on direct PAC contributions
to candidates. But they would still allow the national parties to
raise $3.5 million a year and their senatorial election committees
an additional $3.8 million from PACs.
   ``What we have here in effect is a big money-laundering
scheme,'' Dole said, ``apparently one that won't be around too
long.''
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., has acknowledged that Democrats are
willing to yield more on the PAC issue. But in getting their
colleagues to agree to give up contributions from PACs to their
individual campaigns, party leaders had to revive a partial public
financing mechanism to make up for the losses.
   And senators up for re-election in 1992 who have already
received PAC contributions would get to keep them. Their
challengers would be allowed to raise matching amounts from PACs,
but Republicans complain that the prospects they could are limited
since 80 percent of all PAC donations go to incumbents.

<TEXT>
   Director Nils Gaup made his first film _
based on a 1,000-year-old legend he heard from his grandfather _ in
the hopes it would be a hit among his native Lapp people.
   It was. Then the film, called ``Pathfinder,'' was nominated for
an Oscar as best foreign film, and won rave reviews in London and
at numerous film festivals. On Friday it opened in New York.
   The film is in Lapp, a language spoken by less than 40,000
traditional reindeer herders in the northern fringes of Scandianvia
and the Soviet Union.
   ``I made it for a Lapp audience, so when it was successful
elsewhere it was a big surprise to me,'' said Gaup, 35, back in
Oslo after a trip to New York to help promote the film.
   ``Pathfinder'' is based on the legend of a Lapp boy who saved
his people from a band of barbarians that had killed his family.
   It was filmed on the tundra in northern Norway, near Gaup's home
village of Kautokeino. In keeping with the legend, it was filmed in
the depths of artic winter, with temperatures plummeting to minus
40.
   Professional and amateur Lapp actors from Norway, Sweden and
Finland took part in the eight-week filming. It took at least as
long to make the reindeer-skin clothing and the tents. The film
cost $2.3 million, part of which came from a Norwegian government
grant.
   Sitting at a sidewalk cafe in Oslo, Gaup said he was not
concerned about how New York critics would react to the film.
   ``What they say doesn't really mean anything to me, because the
film has already done so much more than I ever hoped for,'' he said.
   He said he intends to write and direct other Lapp films to help
preserve his culture.
   He recalled his boyhood in arctic Norway, when Lapps swapped
tales and used reindeer for transportation.
   The intrusion of television and other modern conveniences has
begun to change that. Now, snowmobiles are as common as sleds, and
``people have stopped sitting around telling legends,'' he said.
   ``That's why it is so important to tell these stories. The Lapp
culture is one of the last left with direct ties to ancient ways of
thinking.''

   The rumor mill has New York and Cleveland as
the finalists for the 1992 Democratic National Convention, but
party officials insist nothing is set.
   ``People are hypothetically guessing that's what Brown's going
to do,'' party spokesman Michael McCurry said Friday of Democratic
Chairman Ronald H. Brown. ``But it's not true.''
   Cleveland, New Orleans, New York and Houston are still in the
running for the convention. The party's site selection committee is
scheduled to meet May 30 to narrow the field to two and Brown will
make the final choice in mid-June.
   Of the four, Houston is considered the longest shot.
   But party sources are quick to point out that no city is perfect
for the convention, expected to attract 35,000 people and worldwide
television coverage from July 13-16, 1992.
   The party's last convention was in Atlanta. Although the hall
was too small and Democrats had other complaints, Atlanta is
estimated to have reaped nearly $70 million in economic benefits.
   Here is how the four finalists stack up, according to the party
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Some members of the site selection committee called Cleveland's
presentation in March the best ever made by any city in any year.
   But the high praise didn't move hotel rooms any closer to the
prospective site, the I-X Center in suburban Brook Park, Ohio. The
city's own estimate is that more than 5,000 of the needed rooms
would be at least an hour away.
   James Ruvolo, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said,
``It's a decision by Ron Brown between message and comfort.''
   Ruvolo defined the message as ``Middle America.''
   ``It's the areas we need to be carrying. No president's ever won
the White House without carrying Ohio. It's (Cleveland) a town
that's made a comeback on its own.''
   New Orleans was host to the 1988 Republican convention. The food
was great and the hotels were close to the downtown Superdome,
which offered ample room for a convention.
   But New Orleans is having trouble coming up with the $15 million
in up-front money required by the Democrats. In addition, Louisiana
is regarded as a stronghold of the anti-abortion movement, which
puts it out of step with the mood of most Democrats.
   Money is no problem for New York, which has offered $22 million,
the most of any city. And the city has hotels galore. But Madison
Square Garden would again confront the Democrats with a hall
smaller than they would like.
   The last contender on the list, Houston, is unwilling to give
the Democrats access to the Astrodome for the long period the party
says it would need to set up for the convention. The stadium is
home to the city's baseball team, the Houston Astros.
   As an alternative, the city has offered the George R. Brown
Center, which the party considers too small.

<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia's Alexander Dubcek, hero of the
Prague Spring reform movement crushed by Red Army tanks a
generation ago, is voicing strong support for change in the Soviet
Union.
   ``It is our greatest hope'' that Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev ``will stay in power and succeed in his reforms,'' Sen.
Alan Cranston, D-Calif., quoted Dubcek as saying during a gathering
in the U.S. Capitol on Friday.
   Dubcek, on his first visit to the United States, echoed the
message voiced here three months ago by Czechoslovak President
Vaclav Havel. Havel said in a speech to Congress that the more
quickly and peacefully the Soviet Union moves toward genuine
political and economic reform ``the better it will be ... for the
whole world.''
   Dubcek began his first day in Washington meeting with Secretary
of State James A. Baker III for nearly an hour.
   The State Department said Baker and Dubcek agreed that regional
initiatives such as Havel's meeting a month ago with leaders of
Austria, Italy, Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia ``were a useful part
of the integration process for Europe.''
   While supporting Western proposals on German unification,
post-communist Czechoslovakia has been promoting gradual
replacement of the Warsaw Pact and NATO alliances with an
all-European security organization and seeking to re-establish
itself as a crossroads of Europe.
   Havel's meeting in Bratislava was unique in having
representation from both alliances and non-aligned countries.
   Cranston said that asked how America could most help
Czechoslovakia, Dubcek replied that it should grant trade
concessions. Czechoslovakia recently concluded a trade agreement
with the United States and is expected to gain coveted
most-favored-nation treatment in early summer, after passage of
legislation.
   Cranston said he couldn't ascertain if Dubcek, who headed the
Czechoslovak Communist Party at the time of the 1968 Soviet
invasion of Czechoslovakia, was still a communist, but ``he's
certainly a reformed communist.''
   ``We made an attempt 21 years ago to break the Stalinist
system,'' Dubcek recalled in a brief talk ttealing Confiscated Drugs

   An investigator in the Esseen indicted on charges that he stole more
than two pounds of cocaine and heroin and several weapons from area
police department property rooms, state officials say.
   Richard R. Del Guercio was charged in a 27-count indictment with
allegedly stealing 900 grams of cocaine, a quantity of heroin and
three handguns over a two-year period, officials said Friday.
   The drugs had a street value of at least $250,000, officials
said.
   Officials said Del Guercio took the drugs and weapons on seven
different occasions by signing them out of property rooms at the
Newark Police Department, the Irvington Police Department and the
Essex County Prosecutor's office, the indictment says. The drugs
and weapons were never returned, the indictment says.
   Del Guercio, who was arrested last July, could face a maximum
prison sentence of 207 years and $1.7 million in fines if convicted
on all counts.
   Del Guercio had worked in the prosecutor's office for five years
prior to his arrest, said Chuck Davis, spokseman for Attorney
General Robert Del Tufo.
   Davis said Del Guercio is out on bail. However, he said
information about Del Guercio's current residence was not available
Friday and no telephone number could be obtained.

<HEAD>Minnesota Law Rejects Federal Discrimination Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill allowing more leeway in job
discrimination complaints ``sends a signal'' that the nation wants
more protection than allowed by U.S. Supreme Court decisions last
year, the bill's author said.
   The bill that became law in Minnesota earlier this month takes
aim at three high court decisions last June. The decisions placed
the burden of proof on employees and interpreted a racial
discrimination law as applying to discrimination in hiring, not
discrimination on the job.
   The sponsor of the bill, Democratic Rep. Howard Orenstein, said
he hoped Congress would approve legislation similar to his.
   ``It sends a signal to Washington that the states will not stand
by while federal civil rights protections are cut back,'' Orenstein
said.
   The high court's three rulings have been deplored by civil
rights advocates, who say they make it tougher for discrimination
lawsuits to be pressed under federal law.
   The three rulings were among five decisions issued by the Court
last summer. All three were handed down by a 5-to-4 margin.
   The Minnesota measure would allow discrimination suits in hiring
decisions, as well as any time after the person was hired.
Subcontractors could make similar discrimination claims against a
contractor.
   The law requires employers to prove that a job requirement that
has the effect of screening out minority members or women is
justified as a ``business necessity.''
   A provision also would give plaintiffs more time to file a suit
alleging that an employer's seniority system was discriminatory.
   Congress is considering legislation proposed by Democratic Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. On Tuesday, the bill passed the
House Education and Labor Committee on a 23-10 vote. President Bush
has said he would veto the measure, which is opposed by business
interests.
   Julius Chambers, director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and
Educational Fund, told The New York Times that Minnesota is the
first state to confront the Supreme Court decisions so broadly. He
said Massachusetts has passed a much narrower bill.
   ``The Minnesota action closes a big gap,'' Chambers told the
newspaper. ``It has important lessons for people in Washington and
other states.''

   She had never heard him play. A year ago, he disliked music.
   ``I'm missing a lot,'' said Mrs. Phillips, who's serving a
14-year manslaughter sentence for killing her husband with a
shotgun.
   ``It's not just the big things. It's the day-to-day things. He's
got a new girlfriend and I don't know her. He's got new pets. He's
growing up, and I'm missing him,'' she said Friday.
   Sociologists who study crime say a mother going to prison is
much harder on families than a father going to prison. Often,
children end up living with relatives or foster families. Often,
siblings are separated.
   The problems can be compounded by prison systems designed to
better meet the needs of men, who make up the vast majority of the
inmate population. About 5 percent of the 645,000 people who were
in prison nationwide by mid-1989 were women, and 70 percent to 80
percent of them were mothers of dependent children.
   A researcher at the University of Southern Maine is looking for
ways to help all parents behind bars become better mothers and
fathers.
   Karen Tilbor, a research associate at the university's Human
Services Development Institute, said the program at the Maine
Correctional Center, where Mrs. Phillips is housed in nearby
Windham, is similar to a handful of prison parenting programs
around the United States.
   The Maine program includes eight-week training sessions for
parents and monthly meetings where children can visit in a room
designed to look something like a day-care center. Children can
play games and make artwork or crafts.
   ``One Saturday a month, a child will come in and do something
special with their parent, not something in the regular visitation
room, which is stark,'' Tilbor said.
   The program is financed mostly with a three-year federal grant.
   ``It gives them some quality time together,'' said the prison
superintendent, James R. Clemons.
   Mrs. Phillips recently joined the voluntary program. Her son,
Scott, visits about three times a month and she hopes to develop
better interpersonal skills to make the visits more rewarding for
both of them.
   ``It teaches you new ways of parenting,'' Mrs. Phillips said.
``It tries to help you communicate with your children. One segment
is how to listen. You talk for three minutes. Then you listen to
another person talk for three minutes.''
   The mother was anxious as she waited for her boy to visit today,
their first visit alone.
   ``Are we going to be able to find enough to do?'' she wondered.
``Is he going to be bored? I don't want him to sit here twiddling
his thumbs and wishing he wasn't here. I'm nervous. I want him to
want to come back for the next visit.''
   Seeing her son's life progress in bits and pieces shows Mrs.
Phillips how much she is missing. But most difficult about being
separated from her child is trying to help him with his troubles
without being fully informed, Mrs. Phillips said.
   ``Your child has a problem and you don't have the whole story,''
she said. ``My son's not the kind of person who'll say, `Ma, I
don't like the teacher because of this and this.'''
   Creasie Finney Hairston, professor of social work at Indiana
University at Indianapolis, said little has been done in the past
to help prison mothers, but the nation now has about a dozen
programs similar to the one in Maine.
   ``I think it is a very positive approach,'' she said. ``The
limited data that's available shows they have a positive impact on
the child and on the mother.''

<HEAD>Bush Names Los Angeles Judge to Head DEA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says he will nominate U.S.
District Judge Robert C. Bonner of Los Angeles to direct federal
law enforcement efforts against illegal drugs.
   Bush also said Friday that he would nominate William P. Barr to
be deputy attorney general, the No. 2 job at the Justice Department
   Barr would replace Donald B. Ayer, who resigned Friday to return
to private law practice. Department officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity said Ayer and Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh had clashed frequently, reportedly over Ayer's
resentment at lack of authority fitting the No. 2 job.
   If confirmed by the Senate, Bonner would succeed John C. Lawn as
director of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Lawn, a 27-year
government law enforcement veteran, ran the DEA from 1985 until his
retirement in March to become chief of operations for the New York
Yankees.
   Bonner, 48, has served on the federal bench in the Central
District of California, based in Los Angeles, since last year.
   Prior to that, he was U.S. attorney in Los Angeles for five
years.
   Barr, 39, is assistant attorney general for the Justice
Department's office of legal counsel.
   The nominations were announced in Columbia, S.C., along with
other Justice Department appointments, during a speech-making visit
by the president.
   Bush also said he would nominate:
   _J. Michael Luttig to be assistant attorney general for the
Office of Legal Counsel, succeeding Barr. Currently, Luttig is
principal deputy assistant attorney general in the same office.
   _Steven D. Dillingham to be director of the Bureau of Justice
Statistics. Since 1988, he has been deputy director for policy and
special programs for the Bureau of Justice Assistance.
   _Jimmy Gurule to be assistant attorney general for the Office of
Justice Programs. He has been an associate professor of law at
Notre Dame Law School since last year.
   _Charles M. House to be director of the Office for Victims of
Crime, a new position. House now is operations sergeant for court
services in Los Angeles and previously held various positions in
the Los Angeles County sheriff's department.
   Barr's principal assistant, Chief Associate Deputy Attorney
General Peter A. Nowinski, also announced his resignation. He and
his boss will leave on May 25.
   The Barr and Nowinski resignations came only a week after
Thornburgh's aides said the deputy attorney general had not cleared
with Thornburgh a letter expressing department support for proposed
sentencing guidelines for corporations convicted of criminal
offenses.
   Thornburgh ordered Ayer to withdraw the letter to the U.S.
Sentencing Commission after the White House inquired about the
position. Business groups had complained that the proposed
guidelines would be unduly harsh.

<HEAD>University President Charged with Making Indecent Calls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American University President Richard
Berendzen has been charged with two misdemeanor counts of making
indecent telephone calls, police say.
   A Fairfax County police investigator served Berendzen with the
summons Friday. Berendzen was released after agreeing to appear for
trial before a judge on June 28, said county prosecutor Robert
Horan.
   Police spokesman Michael Proffitt said an investigation found
that two women received obscene calls on March 28 and 29. Police
had evaluated about a dozen telephone calls, added Horan.
   Gerard Treanor, Berendzen's attorney, was not immediately
available for comment.
   Berendzen, 51, of Washington, resigned as the university's
president on April 8, citing ``exhaustion.'' His resignation takes
effect at the end of the school year.
   In a statement read by his attorney at the time, Berendzen said
he was embarrassed by unspecified actions he had taken and
apologized for any pain he may have caused.
   Proffitt said Friday that ``the investigation indicates that,
with the exception of one additional victim who is no longer in the
area, no other violations of criminal law by Berendzen were found
to have occurred.''
   Berendzen was a patient for about a month at Johns Hopkins
University Hospital in Baltimore. The hospital has a Sexual
Disorders Clinic, but the hospital would confirm only that
Berendzen was receiving psychiatric care.
   Allegations of unspecified ``improper behavior'' by the 10-year
university president first emerged April 23 in a letter to the
university community from Board of Trustees Chairman Edward R. Carr.
   Carr's letter did not specify the nature of the allegations, but
indicated they ``concerned personal actions.''
   Law enforcement sources, who asked not to be identified, have
said that the calls were placed to women advertising day-care
services and were traced to Berendzen's private office telephone.
The sources said the police have tape recordings of several calls
he allegedly made to the women.
   The maximum penalty for each count, if he is found guilty, is a
$1,000 fine and one year in jail.
   Berendzen, a former astronomy professor with degrees from MIT
and Harvard, came to American University in 1974 as dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences. He became provost three years later
and president in 1980.
   University officials had no comment.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The armed services are proposing to cut two
aircraft carriers and three new ballistic missile submarines and to
defer plans for mobile land-based intercontinental missiles,
according to published reports.
   The proposals were contained in classified memoranda submitted
to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in response to his instructions to
identify further cuts in the 1990s that will be submitted to a
major review this summer, according to stories in today's editions
of The New York Times and The Washington Post.
   The ``program memoranda'' cover the 1992 through 1997 fiscal
years, and often incorporate known decisions, such as Cheney's plan
for only 75 B-2 stealth bombers instead of the original 132.
   Another is the Army's determination that by 1997, it should have
580,000 troops, down from the current 781,000.
   Even though the Navy's memo calls for 12 deployed carriers, the
service still wants 14, according to the Post.
   Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett III was quoted as writing Cheney
that the forces ``best suited to perform reliably our enduring
missions ... in the coming decade is centered on 14 aircraft
carrier battle groups.''
   The Navy calls for 488 warships, the first time it has settled
on a number, according to both newspapers. There are 549 today.
   Among other reported plans was one to commission only 18
submarines to carry the Trident missile instead of 21.
   The Air Force calls for phasing out multiple-warhead missiles, a
decision fitting the arms control strategy advocated by many on
Capitol Hill.
   ``Deployment of the mobile missile programs can be deferred with
acceptable risk,'' said the Air Force Secretary Donald B. Rice's
memo quoted in the Post.
   The Times said the service proposed to develop the Midgetman
missile, long conceived of as based on special trucks, for silos.
The Post said some Minuteman missiles would be reduced from three
warheads to one.
   The Air Force was said to propose 28 ground attack wings,
compared with 36 now and 30 previously planned.

<HEAD>Taiwan May Not Let Pro-Democracy Ship Dock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taiwan may deny docking rights to the
Goddess of Democracy, thwarting plans for the ship to beam
pro-democracy broadcasts to China, organizers say.
   Officials at the northern port of Keelung on Friday granted the
ship docking rights to take on provisions before heading for
international waters, where it will is to begin broadcasts. The
vessel is expected to arrive Sunday.
   But Communications Minister Chang Chien-pang said that the ship
would not be allowed back if it makes unauthorized broadcasts.
   China has refused to rule out the use of force to stop the
planned broadcasts and has warned that any help Taiwan gives the
ship would be considered ``an open provocation.''
   Taiwan's military reported Friday that it had sighted a
submarine near the radio ship Wednesday, and restated earlier
pledges to protect the vessel if it is attacked near Taiwan.
   The official Military News Agency said the submarine, suspected
of belonging to the Communist Chinese, disappeared when a
Nationalist fighter tried to spot it.
   The ship is sponsored by a coalition of press organizations
headed by the French news magazine Actuel, with funds from several
overseas Chinese communities.
   It is named after the statue erected in Beijing's Tiananmen
Square last year during pro-democracy protests. The protests were
crushed in June by the military, and hundreds and possibly
thousands of people were killed.
   Pascal Dupont, a reporter with Actuel, said Chang's announcement
came as a ``big surprise'' and could force organizers to drop the
project.
   ``We came with a peaceful purpose,'' Dupont said. ``We are legal
and moral.''
   He said organizers ``do not agree with (the Taiwan) government's
position, but we respect it. We will try to convince the government
of our peaceful purpose and make it soften the position.''
   Dupont said the ship would have to take on provisions after a
planned three-week broadcast mission in international waters. There
do not appear to be any other viable ports in the region because
the nearby British colony of Hong Kong already has refused to allow
the vessel to dock.
   Although the Nationalist Chinese government of Taiwan is the
sworn enemy of the Communists in Beijing, relations have warmed in
recent months with increased business and civilian ties.
   Taiwanese fishermen planned to organize a flotilla of about 20
fishing boats to escort the democracy ship, although authorities
warned them that their boats should not be used for purposes other
than fishing.
   The Nationalists once governed China but retreated across the
Taiwan Straits to this island in 1949 after losing a civil war to
Communist forces.

   An associate U.S. attorney from New York will
oversee the investigation of package bombs that killed a federal
judge in Alabama and a city official in Georgia, the Justice
Department says.
   Louis Freeh, a former FBI agent, is being put in charge of the
investigation, the department said in a statement Friday.
   Judge Robert Vance of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was
killed Dec. 16 in his home in suburban Birmingham, Ala., when a
package delivered to his house blew up when he opened it.
   Two days later a similar device killed Robert Robinson, a civil
rights lawyer and a Savannah, Ga., city councilman.
   Package bombs also were found at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta and the NAACP office in Jacksonville, Fla.,
authorities have said. Those bombs were defused.
   The FBI and other federal agencies investigating the killings
have considered offering a $500,000 reward for information leading
to the arrest of a suspect, sources have said.
   FBI Director William Sessions told reporters leads in the case
``are consistently moving and progressing very well,'' though the
Justice Department statement made no reference to any progress.

<HEAD>Officials Promote Use of New AIDS Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials are recommending that
physicians use a recently approved drug as standard treatment for
recurrences of a life-threatening infection in AIDS patients.
   The drug fluconazole has proven so successful that a
government-sponsored comparative study has been stopped and the
drug offered to all participants, officials at the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said Friday.
   In the study, fluconazole was compared with amphotericin B,
which has been the standard treatment for the infection as well as
for recurrences.
   The infection, cryptococcal meningitis, affects the brain and
nervous system. About 10 percent of AIDS victims get the disease,
and after treatment for the initial infection, they need lifetime
maintenance therapy to prevent recurrence.
   The study was stopped April 30 and preliminary results were
distributed to physicians who treat patients with AIDS, officials
said.
   Patients in the study had been treated successfully with
amphotericin B when they first got the infection. Of the 106
patients who received fluconazole to prevent recurrence, two had
relapses. Of the 77 who received amphotericin B, 13 got the
infection again, NIAID said.
   Fluconazole, made by Pfizer Inc., has fewer side effects than
amphotericin B. Also, fluconazole can be given by mouth, while
amphotericin B must be given intravenously.
   Amphotericin B causes nausea, fever and can impair kidney and
bone marrow function. Fluconazole has few side effects, but in some
patients it can cause abdominal discomfort, nausea, skin rash and
sometimes liver damage.

<HEAD>Group Agrees to Toughen School Achievement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal agency will set national benchmarks
for student performance so officials and parents can determine what
students are really learning in school.
   The governing board of the National Assessment of Educational
Progress, known as the Nation's Report Card, voted Friday to
designate three achievement levels for students in grades four,
eight and 12 in each subject area it tests.
   The Report Card is the only national assessment of what American
students know and can do. Congressionally required assessments have
been conducted on nationwide samples since 1969 in reading,
mathematics, science, writing, history, geography and other
subjects.
   The board usually releases without judgment test results showing
the percentage of students performing specific tasks. For example,
a recent study found most fourth graders knew why Thanksgiving and
July 4 are holidays, but only 36 percent knew why Columbus sailed
to America.
   Under the plan approved Friday, the board will designate
achievement levels of ``proficient,'' ``advanced'' and ``basic.''

   Wally Etsekson's half acre of water-view
property looks pretty good on paper, but he'll need scuba gear to
get a real feel for the place.
   Etsekson, an investor from the Seattle suburb of Bellevue, was
the lone bidder for the surplus piece of state property. He bought
the parcel sight unseen and says he was ``quite surprised'' to
learn it is almost completely submerged in the Columbia River.
   ``It looked like a good location on a map,'' Etsekson said.
   The parcel, for which the state sought a minimum of $31,500, was
one of seven surplus properties it offered Wednesday. Etsekson paid
$33,150.
   ``I'm surprised somebody bought it,'' said Roy Heikkala,
director of property and development for the Port of Vancouver.
After looking at the land, officials had concluded the state
``would probably be stuck with it,'' he said.
   The Vancouver property is ``mostly level'' and covered with
``grass, gravel and asphalt,'' the sale announcement noted.
   But a map showing its location near the Interstate 5 bridge and
a motel offered one clue to the parcel's fatal flaw. One boundary
is labeled ``outer harbor limit.''
   Why doesn't the announcement note that the parcel is mostly
submerged?
   ``I'm not sure,'' said Paul Lovgren, a Department of
Transportation property manager in the state's capital, Olympia.
   ``Evidently it was obvious from walking out there and looking at
it. As a rule of thumb, you don't buy a piece of property without
looking at it.''

<HEAD>Son of Reputed Chicago Mob Patriarch Wins Share of Illinois Lotto</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They say that Anthony ``Big Tuna'' Accardo made
part of his fortune from illegal gambling proceeds. But his son
just became a millionaire on a perfectly legal, $1 bet.
   Anthony Ross Accardo, who stepped forward this week to claim his
share of a $5.9 million Illinois State Lottery Lotto jackpot, is
the son of the reputed gangland patriarch.
   Accardo, 54, of suburban Barrington, and his partner, Joseph P.
Cohen, 44, held a ticket that won half of the first prize from the
April 7 Lotto drawing. The two said they were forming the ``C &amp; A
Partnership'' to receive the payments.
   The Chicago Sun-Times revealed Friday that Accardo is the son
``Big Tuna'' Accardo, 84, of Barrington Hills.
   The younger Accardo, who has no criminal record, is a member of
the Motion Picture Projectionists' Union. He said he would use his
share of the winnings to take an early retirement.
   Jerry Gladden, chief investigator for the Chicago Crime
Commission, described the senior Accardo as ``the head, or
semiretired head, of organized crime in Chicago.''
   Accardo was an enforcer for Al Capone and Frank Nitti. He
reportedly stepped down as the head of Chicago organized crime in
the 1960s but was called out of retirement after the 1975 murder of
his successor, Sam ``Momo'' Giancana.
   Illinois Lottery director Sharon Sharp said she was not aware at
first that the winner was related to the mob figure.
   ``It just shows that anyone can win the lottery, I guess,''
Sharp said. ``They won it fair and square.''
   ``They both were very nice gentlemen, and they both were good
enough to come in person and claim their prize,'' she added.
   As winners, the younger Accardo and Cohen were presented with a
check for $150,591, and they will receive 19 annual payments of
$149,000 for a total of more than $2.9 million, lottery officials
said.
   The other winning ticket was held by an Indiana resident, Sharp
said.

<HEAD>Eighth Fatality Found in Jet Wreckage</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators today discovered an
eighth fatality in the wreckage of a Philippine Airlines jet that
exploded and burned before takeoff.
   The explosion and fire rocked the Boeing 737-300 Friday as it
was being towed to a runway at Manila's domestic airport for a
flight to Iloilo, 290 miles south. Eighty-two people were injured.
   The cause of the blast has not been determined. Officials say a
bomb may have been planted on the plane.
   Results of chemical tests on the wreckage will not be available
until Monday, said investigator Raffy Ragos.
   Philippine Airlines Vice President Enrique Santos said an eighth
body was found shortly after midnight after the plane was towed to
a nearby hangar. Seven bodies were discovered in the burned-out
cabin on Friday.
   At least 82 passengers of Flight PR143 were treated for injuries
at the airport clinic, an airline nurse said. She said 22 of the
injured were hospitalized, one in serious condition.
   Flight attendants were busy reading the routine emergency
instructions to passengers when the explosion occurred, survivors
said.
   Airline president Dante Santos said flames raced through the
plane in four minutes. He said there apparently had been only one
blast, near the center of the passenger cabin where most of the
bodies were found.
   Oscar Alejandro, director of the government's Air Transport
Office, said the blast occurred before the aircraft's engines had
been started.
   ``We're looking into the possibility that a bomb was placed
there,'' he said without elaboration.
   But an airport security officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the explosion could have been caused by faulty
electrical wiring and a malfunctioning air conditioner. He said
there were no signs of shrapnel, which would have resulted from a
bomb blast, in the plane's wreckage.
   None of the country's insurgent groups has a history of random
terrorism, such as bombing airliners.
   In 1976, a bomb carried by a would-be hijacker exploded in the
toilet of a Philippine Airines plane flying from Manila to Cebu.
The hijacker was sucked out of the aircraft, and it was not
determined if his motive was political.
   Friday's incident was the worst aviation disaster in Manila
since last July, when a Philippine Airlines jet overshot a runway
and slammed into a busy highway. Eight people, all on the ground,
were killed and 91 people were injured.

   An eighth-grade dropout convicted of
murdering a woman 12 years ago after meeting her at a bar was put
to death by lethal injection.
   Winford Stokes, 39, was pronounced dead at 9:39 p.m. CDT Friday
after receiving lethal doses of sodium pentothal, Pavlon and sodium
chloride at the Potosi Correctional Center.
   The U.S. Supreme Court and the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
had denied last-ditch requests to block the execution.
   Stokes was sentenced for the Feb. 18, 1978, strangling and
stabbing of 33-year-old Pamela Benda, a waitress from University
City, a St. Louis suburb.
   Stokes, who had escaped from a mental hospital, killed Benda
after meeting her in a bar and going to her apartment for sex.
   Stokes previously had been convicted in the 1977 slaying of an
elderly St. Louis woman and the shooting death of a St. Louis
tavern owner in 1969.
   His wife, Evette, met with the condemned man for most of the
afternoon, prison spokesman Dale Riley said. Stokes had no last
words and asked for no personal witnesses at his execution.
   After the curtains to the death chamber viewing area were
opened, Stokes lifted his head to look at the witnesses and the IV
bag from which the lethal chemical flowed. Then he blinked his eyes
rapidly and lay back on the gurney.
   ``Justice has been served. This regrettable event is necessary
to reaffirm the value the state of Missouri places on innocent
human life,'' Gov. John Ashcroft said in a prepared statement.
   Stokes was the third person put to death in Missouri since 1976,
when the Supreme Court ruled that states could resume carrying out
the death penalty. He was the 125th person in the nation executed
since then.

   Where does an 800-pound sea lion go when he
visits San Francisco?
   Anywhere he wants.
   Months after invading dozens of expensive berths at posh Pier 39
Marina, the huge, barking sea lions with bad breath continue to
swagger around their self-declared spa on San Francisco Bay.
   ``Oh, they're having a wonderful time, posing for the cameras,''
said marina spokeswoman Alicia Vargas. ``It's the longest bachelor
party we've ever had here. It's costing us up to $5,000 a month in
dock space.''
   Since January, sea lions have lived on runs of herring and
anchovy at the marina. They are now thought to be feasting on squid
and various fish.
   Vargas said management is searching for a way for the animals
and marina humans ``to coexist with each other. ... I wish we could
negotiate.''
   One thing the marina may not do is try to actively chase the
animals away. They are protected under federal law and may not be
harassed, hunted, captured or killed.
   ``I don't think you can even glare at them,'' said Sheila
Chandor, a manager of the restaurant-shops-amusement complex on the
edge of the bay.
   Friday morning, there were 50 to 60 of the aggressive creatures
on the docks, quarreling, wrestling and jumping up and down.
   The invasion has produced a touch of drama around a large bull
that has been named, ``Flea Collar.'' The animal, when younger and
smaller, dived for fish one day and came up with some kind of ring
of plastic or some other material around his neck, apparently from
some discarded trash.
   A group of animal lovers noticed that as the sea lion grew, the
neckpiece tightened and was cutting into the animal's blubber.
   ``Three people tried to approach Flea Collar from three
different directions to cut the ring away, but they couldn't do
it,'' said Vargas. ``He went into the water.''
   She expects that Flea Collar will be strangled on the piece of
trash one of these days.
   In February, at the height of the assault, about 400 pushy,
argumentative sea lions, some as hefty as 800 pounds, swamped the
docks around 20 slips in the west marina and scared boaters away.
They growled at boats going by and forced the marina to move boats
to other slips.
   The crowd of critters put the docks, including electrical
connections, under water. The sea lions have charged and snapped at
people and seem to take a dim view of boats that pass too close to
their enclave.
   With the exception of a few female juveniles, the animals still
at the marina are all males, said James Lecky, chief of the
Protective Species Environment Branch of the National Marine
Fisheries Service.
   The breeding-age males, over five years of age, will probably
leave soon for the usual sea lion mating areas in the Channel
Islands off Santa Barbara, he said. But some of the juveniles might
hang around all summer.
   ``They come and go,'' said Vargas, who would not estimate damage
from the animals since workers can't get close enough for an
examination of dock operations.
   Sea lions also are getting the last laugh in Seattle.
   Several of the creatures were trucked to the Channel Islands to
stop their feast on a run of wild steelhead trout at locks in the
city. But four of them have been spotted recently near Seattle,
after a 1,000-mile swim back that took them about a month, state
wildlife officials say.

   A homeless woman seized her 12-year-old daughter
from a hospital where she was being treated for heart disease
because the woman believes blood transfusions would damage the
child's soul, authorities said.
   State officials issued public pleas Friday to Caroline Winfield,
35, asking her to return her daughter, Kimberly, so the child can
receive the medical attention she needs.
   The mother, who lost custody of her three children last month
because she was homeless, opposes heart surgery because she is a
Jehovah's Witness and feels a blood transfusion would endanger her
daughter's soul, said Dave Schneidman, a spokesman for the Illinois
Department of Children and Family Services.
   He said the child needed open-heart surgery to survive. ``The
prognosis is she has anywhere from a week to a month to live
without the surgery,'' he said.
   The woman contacted her family about returning the child, who
left Children's Memorial Hospital about 1 a.m. Thursday, but was
afraid to do so, her estranged husband, Larry, said Friday.
   ``She wanted to return the child but she wanted to do it without
getting in trouble,'' Schneidman said. ``We're not real interested
in catching the mother if she doesn't want to be caught, but we do
want the child back so we can save the child's life.''
   The estranged husband said she contacted him by telephone and
had visited his mother, Mary Winfield, a short time after the
alleged abduction in an unsuccessful attempt to get her two younger
sons, who are in the mother-in-law's custody.
   Police obtained an arrest warrant for Caroline Winfield on a
charge of child abduction because Kimberly is a ward of the state,
said Chicago police Lt. Edmund Beazley.
   A hospital spokeswoman said Kimberly, who was admitted May 9,
was not critically ill.
   ``She was undergoing tests to determine the severity of her
heart problem,'' said spokeswoman Jean Benzies. ``Her doctor does
not believe her life is in immediate danger.
   ``However, it is clinically advisable that she be located and
treated within a month.''
   Kimberly was diagnosed as having an enlarged heart and possible
heart valve damage after a case of rheumatic fever, and had been
taking heart medication, family members said.
   They said they did not know if the girl had been receiving the
medication after the family returned to Chicago from Little Rock,
Ark., earlier this year.
   Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions as being against
the teachings of the Bible, citing the section of Leviticus that
reads, ``Whatsoever man ... eats any manner of blood, I will cut
him off from among his people.''
   ``You can't do surgery without a transfusion of blood,''
Schneidman said.
   The family services department waited about 34 hours after the
disappearance to notify the press so the police could check leads
on Mrs. Winfield's whereabouts, Schneidman said.
   Those leads had been exhausted, he said.
   The state was named temporary custodian of Kimberly and the two
brothers, ages 2 and 8, because Mrs. Winfield was unable to care
for them, Schneidman said.
   ``They were living on the streets without proper housing or any
evident means of support,'' Schneidman said.
   The boys' names were not released.

   Fans set up a telegram hotline for
get-well messages and kept vigil outside Sammy Davis Jr.'s home
today amid reports the legendary entertainer was near death from
cancer.
   Actress Cicely Tyson was among those who visited the 64-year-old
comedian on Friday. Floral arrangements were delivered to Davis'
home on a quiet, tree-lined street.
   Friends said the song-and-dance man was emaciated and obviously
losing his battle with throat cancer. Davis' weight had dropped to
about 60 pounds, said a source close to the entertainer who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Susan Reynolds, a spokeswoman for Davis, did not return repeated
telephone calls seeking an update on his health.
   A telegram hotline set up by fans was expected to generate up to
10,000 get-well messages over the weekend, said Virginia Reese,
manager of a local Western Union branch.
   Davis' health has deteriorated steadily since the
cancer-stricken entertainer left Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on
March 13 to recuperate at home. He was first diagnosed with
carcinoma of the throat last September.
   Friday was the 20th anniversary of Davis' third marriage, to
Altovise Gore.

<HEAD>President Orders Review of Sandinista Property Seizures; Workers
on Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government threatened to fire
about 60,000 public employees who held sit-in strikes to demand
that their wages be doubled and that a law protecting labor rights
be restored.
   Also Friday, President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro ordered a
sweeping review of property seizures during 10 years of Sandinista
rule.
   About 2,000 public workers, shouting ``Power to the People,''
broke through a cordon of 100 policemen late Friday and took over a
plaza outside the presidential offices.
   ``Workers on strike should retun to their jobs,'' said Labor
Minister Francisco Rosales. ``Otherwise we will declare the strike
illegal and apply the labor law and those who do not show up will
be fired.''
   Government officials refused to meet with union representatives.
The workers then asked for a meeting Monday and vowed to continue
the strike.
   Rosales, speaking at a news conference with Mrs. Chamorro, said
the government would negotiate wage increases, but not under
pressure.
   Government employees rejected a 60 percent pay increase Mrs.
Chamorro had ordered earlier this week, saying it did not keep up
with the steep price increases.
   In the latest round of price hikes, the government this week
doubled water rates, tripled electricity rates and raised the rates
of telephone services by 1,300 percent. The public transportation
subsidy was removed.
   The cordoba, Nicaragua's currency, was devalued for the fourth
time in less than a month. The devaluations make imports more
expensive and encourage exports by making them cheaper. The moves
have sent consumer prices soaring.
   ``Prices of clothes have shot up barbarously,'' said Clarissa
Gutierrez, 50, a janitor at the Education Ministry.
   Mrs. Gutierrez complained that a pound of sugar now costs 50
cents, rice 40 cents, beans 55 cents, and a quart of cooking oil $3.
   But Roberto Martinez, 40, who has a stall at Managua's sprawling
Eastern Market, hoped for better times. ``Things will change. The
new government is just getting started. We suffered more under the
Sandinistas.
   The civil service law suspended Thursday by Mrs. Chamorro
protects employees from firing and grants them the right to strike
and bargain collectively. Rosales has said it ``ties the hands of
the new government.''
   The union, called the General Confederation of Public
Admnistration Workers, maintains that the president does not have
the authority to change laws while the National Assembly is in
session.
   ``The strike is the only instrument the workers have to preserve
their rights,'' said Jose Angel Bermudez, secretary general of the
federation.
   Mrs. Chamorro told the news conference Friday, ``We have
inherited a country that was virtually sacked and in complete
bankruptcy and it is our responsibility to get it going again.''
   She announced her government would review all laws passed by the
leftist Sandinistas in their last two months in office. Mrs.
Chamorro took power on April 25.
   At the time, the Sandinistas had control of the National
Assembly, but Mrs. Chamorro's 14-party United National Opposition
took a majority in the parliament with its victory in the Feb. 25
elections.
   Mrs. Chamorro said all property seizures implemented by the
Sandinistas during their 10 years in power will be reviewed. During
their rule the Sandinistas confiscated some private businesses and
turned them into state enterprises.
   The preisdent said spring planting would start this month, and
she ordered that all agricultural and pasture land be opened
provisionally to rental to revive farm production.
   Gustavo Tabaldo, director of the Agrarian Reform Institute, said
that was a temporary measure to allow land to be worked while
property rights are clarified.
   Food production dropped so sharply under the Sandinistas _ and
during the U.S.-imposed economic embargo _ that Nicaragua was
forced to import crops it used to export and shortages occurred of
such staples as rice and beans. The Bush administration lifted the
embargo on the day Mrs. Chamorro was inaugurated.
   Another law being reviewed allowed senior Sandinistas to
confiscate homes of the wealthy.

   They were America's space pioneers,
the Mercury Seven who rode rockets into the final frontier. Three
decades later, they hope pieces of their past will encourage a
bright future for the space program.
   Evidence of the Mercury Seven's exploits fills the United States
Astronaut Hall of Fame, dedicated Friday by five of the surviving
six Mercury astronauts.
   The Hall of Fame represents ``what we can do collectively to
encourage youngsters to be involved in space and engineering,''
said Houston businessman Alan Shepard, 66, who was the first
American in space.
   ``After all, many of them are going to be astronauts in the
future,'' he said.
   None of the Mercury astronauts need an exhibit or memorial, said
Ohio U.S. Sen. John Glenn, 68, who made America's first manned
orbital mission.
   ``But if this can help inspire someone to better education and
to inspire some of our young people to do some research ... then
this will all be worthwhile,'' he said.
   The Hall of Fame, 13 miles from where the Mercury Seven rocketed
into history three decades ago, honors those ``first brave flyers
who journeyed into space, the ones who have since followed and
those who will follow in the future.''
   A large, blue sign with those words was unveiled at the
dedication ceremony. The Hall of Fame actually opened in March.
   Included in displays is an ``umbilical'' plug from the Freedom 7
spacecraft that carried Shepard on a 15-minute suborbital flight in
1961, making him the first American in space. There is a chunk of
the Atlas rocket that propelled Glenn into space in 1962, America's
first manned orbital mission.
   There is Walter Schirra's Mercury spacecraft, the late Virgil
``Gus'' Grissom's spacesuit, L. Gordon Cooper's spacecraft heat
shield, Malcolm Scott Carpenter's camera with which he photographed
Earth, and Donald ``Deke'' Slayton's food tubes from the 1975
Apollo-Soyuz mission.
   There are more personal items, too, salvaged from attics and
garages: medals, patches, flight helmets, goggles, gloves, jackets.
   ``By and large, the spaceman image has been a good one for
youngsters, and this will help it remain a good image,'' said
Carpenter, 65, who is an aerospace and oceanography consultant in
Palmer Lake, Colo.
   All of the surviving seven but Schirra were on hand for the
ceremony. Grissom died in 1967 aboard Apollo in a launch-pad fire.
His widow, Betty, attended in his place.
   The Hall of Fame shares the glass and gray metal structure just
outside Kennedy Space Center with U.S. Space Camp Florida, a space
education program for fourth- through seventh-graders. It is a
joint venture between the Mercury Seven Foundation and U.S. Space
Camp Foundation, non-profit organizations that raise scholarship
money.
   In addition to showcasing the Mercury Seven, the Hall of Fame
lists the crew members of 64 U.S. manned space flights. The last
two flights have yet to be posted. The more noteworthy astronauts
eventually will be enshrined in the Hall of Fame alongside the
Mercury Seven, the subject of a book by Tom Wolfe called ``The
Right Stuff.''

<HEAD>Fidel Pitching in to Help Noriega, Lawyers Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fidel Castro met with Manuel Noriega's defense
lawyers in March, and Castro said the information he provided will
clear the ousted Panamanian leader of drug charges.
   Castro discussed ``certain sensitive issues'' with the lawyers
and provided them with documentation, Noriega attorney Frank Rubino
said Friday. He gave no details on where the meeting was held.
   A Brazilian television reporter quoted Castro as saying: ``I
have all the proof which proves the falsehoods of the accusations.''
   The Cuban leader did not say what kind of evidence he gave the
lawyers, but claimed ``to have all the cards in my hands to
irrefutably prove the lies.''
   According to a February 1988 indictment, the Cuban leader
mediated a dispute in 1984 between Noriega and Colombia's Medellin
drug cartel over a raid on a drug lab the Panamanian leader had
supposedly been paid to protect.
   Meanwhile, assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan submitted a
list Friday of Noriega's 27 frozen bank accounts around the world,
but immediately asked the judge to seal it from both the defense
and the public.
   Defense attorneys have filed a motion to withdraw from the case,
saying they can't continue without some of the frozen $20 million
to pay fees and expenses.
   Sullivan said many of Noriega's assets _ including $5.8 million
in cash confiscated in his quarters during the December U.S.
invasion, along with his home, cars and other personal items _ have
simply been handed over to Panama's new government.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said he was disturbed that
no hearing had been held before the government surrendered the
money.
   ``Although it's not common to have $5 million or $6 million in
one's bedroom .... it appears the money was his,'' the judge said.
``That raises an interesting question about what right the
government had to give it away.''
   The defense has subpoenaed records of the CIA, the Drug
Enforcement Administration and other agencies seeking to show
Noriega received about $11 million in payoffs from the United
States government, as well as up to $7 million more from foreign
governments.
   The defense claims that money should not be frozen.
   Hoeveler questioned the defense contention that Noriega had no
information of his own about where his assets were. The judge said
he wanted the general to tell him by the next hearing whether he
has additional accounts.
   Defense attorney Jon May said Noriega had not told them about
any additional money, and added that his clients had no records
with him in jail.
   ``We are not talking about accounts as you or I might have,''
May said. ``These were handled by intermediaries, and certain
people who handled a lot of these matters are under indictment.''
That comment apparently referred to officials of the Bank of Credit
Commerce International, who are now on trial for money laundering
in Tampa.
   Noriega was indicted on February 1988 on charges of taking money
from Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to make Panama a save haven
for cocaine smuggling. He is being held at the federal Metropolitan
Correctional Center outside of Miami.

   Sikh militants burst into an engagement
party before dawn today and opened fire with automatic weapons,
killing five people and wounding eight, police said.
   The deaths in Jabhalla village, 70 miles east of the Punjab
state capital of Amritsar, brought to 790 the number of people
killed this year in the movement for a separate Sikh nation.
   Sikh separatists have been fighting since 1982 for a separate
state in the rich farming region in northern India, bordering
Pakistan. They claim discrimination by India's Hindu majority and
the government.
   In today's attack, six Sikhs with AK-47 automatic weapons
entered the house of Jurbachen Singh, who had thrown a party to
celebrate the engagement of his daughter, according to senior
police superintendent Suresh Arora.
   The militants sealed the exits and opened fire on the crowd,
which had been celebrating late into the night, Arora said. Three
of the dead were Hindus, and two were Sikhs.
   Hindus comprise 82 percent of the national population of 880
million, and Sikhs form only 2 percent. Sikhs comprise a slight
majority in Punjab state.
   Officials said the attack in Jabhalla village was unusual
because the area is known as one where Sikhs get along well with
Hindus.
   On Wednesday, militants bombed two buses at a city bus station
in Amritsar, killing four people and injuring 41 others. On
Thursday, two more people were killed in Sikh attacks.
   The Sikh religion, founded in the 15th century, opposes the
strict caste system found among Hindus. Under religious guidelines,
Sikh men never cut their hair or beards.

   Elizabeth Taylor will remain in the
hospital six more weeks due to complications in her fifth week of
treatment for pneumonia, doctors said.
   The recovery of Miss Taylor, near death two weeks ago with viral
pneumonia, was dealt a setback by bacterial pneumonia and a yeast
infection, her doctors said Friday.
   ``This secondary bacterial pneumonia often follows viral
pneumonia. Her condition is listed as stable and she is improving
significantly,'' they said in a statement released by St. John's
Hospital and Health Center.
   Earlier this week Miss Taylor's New York publicist, Chen Sam,
had said the 58-year-old actress was improving and would be
released from the hospital this week to recuperate at home.
   During a news conference last month, Miss Taylor's doctors
revealed she was near death on April 22.
   The Oscar-winning star of ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''
and ``Butterfield 8'' entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on
April 9 with a sinus infection, but her condition deteriorated and
she was moved to St. John's for treatment of viral pneumonia.

   Religious leaders vowed at a memorial
service to seek justice for the 11 people killed in the MOVE
firebombing five years ago, but the federal deadline to file
charges expires tonight.
   The Justice Department said it expected no civil rights charges
against police or the city before the statute of limitations runs
out in the firebombing at the headquarters of the radical group.
   Two dozen people attended a memorial service Friday night for
five children and six adult MOVE members killed when Philadelphia
police bombed the group's rowhouse, destroying 61 other homes and
leaving 270 people homeless in the process by letting the fire rage.
   ``We cannot rest at peace simply because it was not our houses
that burned, that it was not our children who were killed,'' Rev.
Robert Longenecker said at the service. ``We must rise up and see
that justice is done.''
   Longenecker and other religious leaders vowed to continue
seeking charges, but Justice Department officials said Friday they
had no plans to push for civil rights violations against the city
or police.
   The statute of limitations on federal civil rights charges runs
for five years. Sunday is the fifth anniversary of the fiery
confrontation, which means charges would have to be brought before
midnight tonight.
   ``We have been saying all week that we didn't expect anything to
be done,'' David Runkel of the Justice Department said. ``You never
say never, but it looks extremely unlikely.''
   On May 13, 1985, police dropped a firebomb on the MOVE rowhouse
in an otherwise quiet Philadelphia neighborhood to dislodge a
bunker atop the building after hours of gunfire. They aimed to
evict the group for harassing neighbors with foul-mouthed
revolutionary rhetoric blared through a bullhorn at all hours.
   The bomb started a fire that swept through the block.
   While many people disagreed with the politics of MOVE, no one
condoned the firebombing, the Rev. Paul M. Washington said at the
memorial service, held in a West Philadelphia church.
   ``Those poor children. ... All those people who lost their homes
and their belongings, that shouldn't have happened to them,'' he
said.
   The city's decision to let the fire rage shocked several members
of a special commission Mayor W. Wilson Goode appointed to
investigate the case.
   The Justice Department, after an 18-month investigation,
declined to present the case to a federal grand jury.
   Washington, who was a member of the mayor's commission, met with
Justice Department officials earlier this week.
   ``We raised questions of the amount of firepower used, the types
of military weapons used, the shrapnel in the bodies, the letting
the building burn. ... We thought that was the best evidence of
evil intent,'' he said Friday.
   ``But all they said was that they deplore what happened but they
can't prove evil intent.''
   Another commission member, Clarence Bullock, said of the Justice
Department, ``They said there was no evidence. Lives were lost.
That should be enough evidence that something bad happened.''
   Ramona Africa, the only adult to survive the blaze, remains in
prison, where she refuses to renounce the group, even though doing
so would mean freedom.

   A small chartered jet carrying local
political leaders home from a conference crashed in northern
mountains, killing all 11 people on board, rescuers said today.
   The plane, a Cessna Citation, went down Friday in a heavily
forested area 875 miles north of Brisbane and 35 miles southwest of
Cairns in the northern sub-tropical state of Queensland,
authorities said.
   It smashed into a steep slope near Mt. Emerald, 10 miles south
of the town of Mareeba. Rescuers were hampered in their efforts by
fog and a severe thunder storm.
   Greg Hoffman, secretary of the Queensland Local Government
Association, said the 10 passengers on the plane were council
members from five north Queensland towns and cities. Police said
the victims included Cairns Mayor Keith Goodwin.
   The aircraft was flying to Mareeba from Proserpine, 360 miles to
the south, when it dropped off radar screens, the Australian
Associated Press reported.
   A Weather Bureau spokesman said flying conditions in the crash
area were bad at the time.

   Fourteen Chinese died of suffocation while trying
to sneak into Hong Kong in the cargo hold of a ship, an official
newspaper said today.
   The Legal Daily said the nine men and five women hid in the
holds of a ship leaving the Guangdong province harbor of Huidong
for the 74-mile trip to Hong Kong on March 7.
   The newspaper said they planned their trip with the help of
unspecified ``illegal elements.''
   Vegetables and other goods were piled on the fugitives, and
wooden planks were nailed over the entrances of the holds,
depriving them of enough air, it said.
   Thousands of Chinese try every year try to smuggle themselves
into Hong Kong in search of better-paying jobs and better lives in
the British colony along China's southeastern coast.
   Every month, Hong Kong police return more than 1,000 illegal
immigrants to the mainland.
   The 14 victims were from Nanan in Fujian province and another
coastal city. Their bodies were returned to Huidong on March 12,
the report said.

   Seven months into its six-year, $1.35
billion journey to Jupiter, the Galileo spacecraft ignited its
rocket thrusters repeatedly so it can swoop near Earth in December,
NASA said.
   The tiny rocket thrusters were ordered to fire during a two-day
maneuver that ends late today, said Jim Wilson, a spokesman at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``We are changing both the speed and the aim point for our Earth
flyby. It's a very gradual change,'' mission director Neal Ausman
said Friday.
   On Dec. 8, Galileo will swoop past Earth in a gravity slingshot
maneuver designed to help expand the spacecraft's orbit around the
sun and hurl it toward its 1995 rendezvous with Jupiter, the solar
system's largest planet.
   The spacecraft will study Earth during the flyby and again
during another slingshot maneuver in December 1992. Galileo used
Venus as a gravity slingshot Feb. 9.
   When the maneuver started at 11:10 a.m. PDT Friday, Galileo was
96 million miles from Earth, but had traveled a looping path of 365
million miles since it was launched from space shuttle Atlantis
last Oct. 18, Wilson said.
   Its trip to Jupiter, the fifth planet from the sun, will total
2.4 billion miles.
   The $1.35 billion mission will take Galileo past one asteroid in
1991 and perhaps another in 1993. In July 1995, the spacecraft
separates into a 4,890-pound orbiter and a 760-pound probe. They
are scheduled to reach Jupiter on Dec. 7, 1995.
   The probe will plunge into the planet's atmosphere, relaying
measurements to the orbiter until it is destroyed by intense
atmospheric pressure. The orbiter will spend at least two years
studying and taking snapshots of Jupiter and its major moons Io,
Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.
   One or two more trajectory maneuvers are needed to get Galileo
to swoop about 1,000 miles from Earth in December, Ausman said.
Without the maneuvers, the spacecraft would miss Earth by 1.5
million miles.

<HEAD>Baltic Presidents Meet to Sign Cooperation Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TALLINN, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The presidents of the three Baltic
republics met today in the Estonian capital to forge a united front
against Moscow in their drive to re-establish independence.
   President Arnold Ruutel of Estonia invited leaders of the two
neighboring Baltic states _ Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania and
Anatoly Gorbunov of Latvia _ to a pink-and-white 18th century
palace for talks expected to revive a 50-year-old cooperation
agreement.
   ``We must give a hand to one another, these little nations of
Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, because in history during a
difficult period we always helped one another,'' Ruutel told
reporters before the meeting. ``That's the way it is today.''
   In brief opening remarks to reporters, delivered in their native
languages, the three presidents spoke of their ``common fate.''
They smiled for a horde of photographers before the closed meeting
at the Toompea Palace, overlooking Tallinn's Old Town.
   Ruutel said he and his counterparts would sign four documents:
one on political cooperation, a letter to Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, a letter to President Bush, and a joint statement.
   Gorbachev is scheduled to meet Bush in Washington at the end of
May. The Baltic republics' drive for independence is expected to be
a topic at that summit, as well at a meeting between U.S. Secretary
of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze in Moscow next week.
   The agreement will revive the Council of Baltic States _ the
presidents and senior ministers of the three republics. The council
will make non-binding recommendations on the governments, Estonian
officials said.
   Baltic state representatives set up the council in September
1934 in Geneva under an agreement of ``unity and cooperation.'' A
1971 Soviet history book called the alliance ``a hotbed of
anti-Soviet agitation.''
   The Baltic republics were part of the Russian Empire, but gained
their independence amid the turmoil of World War I and the
Bolshevik Revolution. They were absorbed into the Soviet Union by
Josef Stalin in 1940.
   Lithuania declared outright on March 11 that it was
re-establishing independence, and Latvia and Estonia followed with
declarations that they would resume independence after unspecified
transition periods.
   Gorbachev has opposed those moves, and demanded that the
republics observe Soviet law. A new law requires a referendum and a
waiting period of up to five years before secession.
   The Kremlin has slapped a tough economic embargo on Lithuania,
and signs of trouble continue to mount for the three republics.
   Landsbergis was quoted today by Vilnius Radio as saying up to
300,000 people soon will be unemployed if Moscow continues its
economic blockade against Lithuania, a republic of 3.8 million.
   Also today, the Information Bureau of the Lithuanian Supreme
Council legislature reported that a column of more than 100 Soviet
military vehicles rumbled through Vilnius, the capital, in the
early morning hours.
   It quoted witnesses as saying the convoy included 59 armored
personnel carriers.
   The move was reminiscent of military maneuvers conducted in the
weeks just after Lithuania's declaration of independence in an
apparent effort to unnerve residents.
   The Kremlin was reported Friday to have taken its first steps
against Latvia and Estonia, stopping transfers of hard currency to
those two republics as well as Lithuania.
   Soviet authorities stopped supplying the Baltic republics with
hard currency April 28 but confirmed it only Friday, the newspaper
Sovietskaya Estonia said.
   That means Baltic residents will not be able to exchange rubles
for foreign currencies to be used on trips abroad. Many Estonians
have been traveling to Finland and Sweden.
   Panic buying in Latvia forced authorities to begin rationing
flour, pasta, salt, matches and cereal as of June 1, said the
Baltia News Agency, a joint news operation of the three republics.
   Estonian sources said agreements among the three presidents also
would likely include joint efforts to control the draft of Baltic
residents into the Soviet armed forces.
   The agreement calls for the Baltic states to be included in
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe that produced the
Helsinki Accords in 1975, said Raul Malk, a spokesmand for
Estonia's parliament. The Baltic leaders want to be invited to a
follow-up Helsinki meeting proposed for Paris this year.
   Estonia's prime minister, Edgar Savisaar, met Friday with Soviet
Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov to discuss the spring military draft.
Yazov reportedly rejected a new Estonian law that allows youths to
perform alternative service in their home republic.
   Savisaar also met with populist Soviet politician Boris Yeltsin
about possible political and economic cooperation between Estonia
and the Russian republic.

   Clint Eastwood opened the competition at
the Cannes Film Festival with a screening of his film based on the
making of John Huston's Bogart-Hepburn classic, ``The African
Queen.''
   Eastwood's film, ``White Hunter, Black Heart,'' is one of 19
competing for the coveted Golden Palm award at the 43rd annual
festival.
   The American actor, known for his tough-guy acting roles, won
the festival's Special Grand Prize for Sound in 1988 with his film
``Bird,'' about jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker.
   He both directed and starred in this latest film, based on
Huston's 1952 classic matching of Humphrey Bogart and Katharine
Hepburn. The film was screened Friday to open formal competition.
   In the film, Jeff Fahey plays ``African Queen'' writer Peter
Viertel and Marisa Berenson plays the Hepburn character.
   The Cannes festival opened Thursday night with a gala ceremony
and a salute to Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, the Golden Palm
winner of 1980 for ``Kagemusha.'' His new film, ``Dreams,'' is not
competing for the prize but was shown as part of the Thursday
tribute.
   The crowd Thursday included director Bernardo Bertolucci,
president of this year's jury, past Cannes prize-winners and other
jury members, including actress Anjelica Huston _ John Huston's
daughter.
   Eastwood's offering this year, based on Viertel's novel of the
same name, shows the late director Huston to be selfish and
arrogant, but a charming man.
   The Huston character, named John Wilson, is obsessed with
killing animals. He neglects his cast, crew and production while he
searches the bush for an elephant to kill.
   ``This is not a picture about the making of a movie,'' Eastwood
told a news conference. ``It's about an obsession for killing an
elephant and a conflict between one man who doesn't like killing a
wild animal and the other man obsessed with killing.
   Eastwood never met the charismatic Huston but said he studied
many of the director's films and interviews.
   ``I tried to capture his energy, strength and enthusiasm about
life,'' said Eastwood.
   Viertel said he wrote the novel ``White Hunter, Black Heart'' as
a kind of therapy after facing Huston's egomania and demands in
Africa. In the movie Viertel (called ``Verrill'') is the writer who
hates killing wild animals.
   ``I loved John, but in this instance, he'd let his heart get
away from him,'' said Viertel. ``He felt he had to prove
something.''
   The film shows Huston not only as an egomaniac, but also as a
champion of minorities. He fights with his glamorous girlfriend who
makes slurs against Jews and with a hotel owner in Africa who
insults his black employees.

<HEAD>Chewing Gum At School Meals: A Sticky Controversy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A plan by Finnish health officials to
give school children chewing gum that prevents tooth decay is
causing a sticky dilemma.
   ``Where's all that gum going to end up? Imagine 500 kids coming
out of the school cafeteria chewing gum,'' said Pirkko Luoto of the
Helsinki School Board.
   Luoto, in charge of planning 42,000 school meals in Helsinki,
said Friday that giving kids chewing gum with meals is technically
feasible. But he added that the results would most likely end up
``under the desks and all over the place.''
   Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian dentists' associations have
recommended that people chew xylitol gum after meals. Test indicate
that gum containing xylitol, a natural sweetener, prevents tooth
decay.
   ``Our research showed that regular use of xylitol reduced
cavities by as much as 90 percent,'' said Arje Scheinin of the
Turku University Institute of Dentistry.
   Xylitol is found in the tissues of such plants as maple and
birch trees, corn cobs, and straw. It has been used commercially as
a sweetener since 1975.
   Mirja Savola, in charge of school nutrition in Turku, displayed
little enthusiasm for the proposal. ``I have read and heard a lot
about this research. But it's far too early to say if we would
include it on school menus,'' she said.
   Sales of chewing gum here have almost doubled in the past five
years as xylitol's popularity has grown. Finns now chew more
sugarless gum than anyone else in the world, its producers say.

   Rival Christian forces today fought

north of the capital, and four civilians were wounded, police said.
   Rebel Gen. Michel Aoun's command and Christian warlord Samir
Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia blamed each other for the clashes
in east Beirut's Badaro district and the bluffs above the Dog River
highway tunnel.
   The fighting kept all roads blocked for a fifth straight day

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Coast Guard overseer of Exxon
Corp.'s oil spill cleanup has formally approved the company's last
and final work plan, including use of chemical fertilizers.
   Rear Adm. David Ciancaglini approved the plan Friday, specifying
that Exxon notify landowners and federal and state agencies two
weeks before using the fertilizers.
   Exxon also must develop a program to protect ``cultural
resources'' such as archaeological artifacts in areas affected by
the March 1989 spill of nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil,
Ciancaglini said.
   ``I must take into account a host of considerations, including
eagle nesting sensitivities, spawning of a variety of species of
fish, wildlife considerations, land manager rules and restrictions,
weather and much more,'' Ciancaglini said in a statement.
   ``I believe that Exxon's plan, modified by me, addresses these
concerns as well as the inputs of the various agencies and
communities affected.''
   Exxon spokesman Joe Tucker said the company was pleased with
Ciancaglini's approval.
   ``While we have only just reviewed his letter, the conditions
accompanying his approval all appear to be appropriate for the 1990
program,'' Tucker said.
   Use of the fertilizers to speed the growth of oil-eating
bacteria has been opposed by some land managers, including the
National Park Service, who say not enough is known about the
possible toxicity of the fertilizers.
   Exxon already is working on plans to protect
cultural-archaeological resources, Tucker said.
   ``The admiral just wanted it in writing,'' said Coast Guard
spokeswoman Gail Williams. ``We're talking the same program, but we
just want to make sure it's done.''
   The tanker Exxon Valdez wrecked on a chartered reef on March 24,
1989, spewing North Slope crude into Prince William Sound. It was
the nation's largest oil spill, coating hundreds of miles of
shoreline and killing hundreds of otters and thousands of birds and
other animals.
   The tanker's skipper, Joseph Hazelwood, was convicted in March
of a misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil into state
waters, but was acquitted of more serious charges.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Trump To Offer Shares in Casino Empire</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS penultimate graf to note that Trump denies reports of
cash squeeze.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump plans to sell stock in his
casino empire in order to raise cash without taking on new debt or
giving up control, according to a newspaper report today.
   Trump would offer non-voting stock to raise cash as part of a
complex deal that includes swapping Trump Castle Hotel &amp; Casino for
the extremely profitable Flamingo Hilton in Las Vegas, The
Philadelphia Inquirer reported.
   The newspaper said several signs point in the direction of an
impending deal between Trump and the Hilton Hotels Corp., including
remarks made on Thursday by Chairman Barron Hilton after the
company's annual meeting.
   Hilton said he was ``looking into'' buying the Trump Castle,
which he built for $320 million. Trump bought it after the New
Jersey Casino Control Commission, worried about Hilton's ties to a
reputed mob lawyer, denied him a gaming license in 1985.
   Also on Thursday, the Inquirer reported, Trump executive Mike
Rumbolz told a Las Vegas television station that Trump would soon
make an investment in a Las Vegas casino.
   The newspaper said a Hilton-Trump swap would make it easier for
Trump to sell stock because profits would not depend on a single
gaming market. The recently renovated Flamingo Hilton, the nation's
largest hotel with 3,530 rooms, is across the Strip from two of Las
Vegas' top properties, Caesars Palace and the Mirage.
   Merrill Lynch, the brokerage that sold $675 million of bonds to
finance the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort, recently sent a team to
Atlantic City to begin the work required for a public stock
offering, the Inquirer reported, quoting Ed Tracy, Trump's gaming
chief.
   Tracy said no final decision has been made to offer stock and
that Trump continues to examine all options for restructuring his
real estate and casino empire.
   Trump has said he wants to raise cash by selling assets and
refinancing properties. Recent published reports have suggested
that Trump is squeezed for cash. He denies it, saying he wants to
have more cash on hand to acquire additional properties.
   Forbes magazine estimated that Trump's interest costs are $38.1
million per year greater than the cash his businesses generate.
Business Week pegged the annual shortfall caused by interest
payments at $60 million.

   A strong earthquake shook a large island in the
eastern Soviet Union today. No injuries or serious damage were
reported.
   The temblor overturned furniture in homes on sparsely populated
Sakhalin Island and was felt 900 miles to the south in northern
Japan, according to Japan's Central Meteorological Agency and the
Japan Broadcasting Corp.
   Police said they had received no reports of injuries in Japan.
   Meteorologists in Japan said the quake measured 7.7 on the
Richter scale and struck deep below the eastern coast of Sakhalin
island. The U.S. Geological Survey in Washington said the temblor
measured 6.7 on the Richter scale.
   The scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake, as
measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase
of one number means the ground motion is 10 times greater. A
magnitude 6.7 quake is considered capable of causing severe damage
in a populated area.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major party may withdraw from East
Germany's coalition government in a dispute over unification talks
with West Germany, a party official was quoted as saying today.
   Leaders of the Social Democrats were debating whether to
withdraw from the nation's first democratic government, said the
party's executive manager, Stephen Hilsberg.
   ``There are several leading members of the SPD faction who
advocate leaving the coalition,'' he said in an interview to be
published Sunday in the West German newspaper Bild am Sonntag. The
interview was released today to other news media.
   Hilsberg's comments were the latest and strongest sign of
widening cracks in the government of Prime Minister Lothar de
Maiziere.
   Social Democrats hold several key ministries. A decision to
leave the coalition would force the prime minister to forge a new
alliance with some of the smaller political factions in Parliament.
   De Maiziere's conservative alliance finished first in East
Germany's first free elections on March 18 and the left-leaning
Social Democrats finished second.
   Despite differences on the speed of German unification, the
parties agreed to form a coalition government to present a united
front to West Germany at the bargaining table.
   De Maiziere also wanted the broadest coalition possible to
ensure the two-thirds majority in Parliament needed to enact
constitutional changes necessary for unification.
   De Maiziere's party dominated the national elections by
promising voters prosperty through unification and a quick shift to
a free-market economy.
   There have been growing signs of worker unrest since then
because of predictions that East Germany will face wide
unemployment when many outmoded East German factories _ now
supported by the state _ are forced to compete.
   Hilsberg said the strikes are a sign that East German officials
must press for a better financial deal.
   Experts from both Germanys continued talks in Bonn, the West
German capital, today on a state treaty to go into effect on July
2, when the Germanys expect to merge their economies and social
institutions.
   De Maiziere is a free-market conservative who, like West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, believes a market economy will create jobs
and raise living standards for East Germans after unification.
   The Social Democrats want more social guarantees and limits on
price increases to ease the transition from a socialist system
where food, employment and housing are heavily subsidized.
   They also want protection from foreign imports.
   De Maiziere already has persuaded West Germany to agree to
convert salaries and pensions earned by East Germans to West German
marks at an equal 1-1 conversion rate.
   West Germany also has said it will convert at a 1-1 rate
personal savings of up to $3,500 for people over age 60 and $2,300
for other adults. Higher amounts would be converted at a 2-1 rate.
   Hilsberg said the Social Democrats want a $5,800 limit for older
people.
   Influencing the negotiations is the West German elections in
early December. West German politicians want to avoid alienating
West Germans who fear they may have less buying power and pay
higher taxes as the cost of bailing out the ailing East German
economy.
   The West German Social Democrats, Kohl's main threat in the
elections, told the government today not to forget West Germans in
the unification talks.
   Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier, a lawmaker and the party's financial
expert, warned of joblessness and social problems in West Germany
after unification.

   A federal ruling has struck down a
longstanding North Carolina law that exempted Bibles from state
sales tax.
   The North Carolina Civil Liberties Union argued the 1939 law was
a violation of the First Amendment. The amendment says the
government cannot favor one religion over another.
   In an unanimous decision, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Richmond, Va., issued the ruling on Thursday, overturning a
ruling by U.S. District Judge James C. Fox of North Carolina. Fox
had dismissed the case in January 1989 on technical grounds.
   The court said that exempting the Bible, but not other
literature, ``forces the state to discriminate on the basis of the
contents of a book, text, or other published work, which is
intolerable under the First Amendment.''
   One of the plaintiffs in the case, a retired Baptist minister,
said the ruling was victory for religious freedom.
   ``I think this is a victory for religious liberty and for the
equality of all faiths in our country,'' said the Rev. W.W.
Finlator, pastor emeritus of Raleigh's Pullen Memorial Baptist
Church.
   Finlator and four other people from the Hindu, Jewish and Hare
Krisna faiths joined the civil liberties union in filing the case
in January 1989.
   The state attorney general's office defended the practice,
saying the exemption also applied to sacred books from other
religions. But the plaintiffs argued that bookstores gave tax
breaks only to people buying Bibles.
   An employee at Waldenbooks in Raleigh confirmed that practice
Friday when asked if sacred books of other religions receive the
tax exemption.
   ``Only Bibles,'' said the employee, who declined to give her
name. ``This is the Bible Belt, baby.''
   North Carolina has exempted the Bible, along with a number of
other items such as false teeth, prescription eyeglasses and
livestock feed, from sales tax since 1939.
   Donald Laton, the assistant state attorney general who handled
the case, said he did not want to comment until he had read the
appeals court's ruling.

<HEAD>Former King Calls For Elections in Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The exiled king of Afghanistan today appealed to
Moslem guerrillas in his homeland to stop fighting the Marxist
regime and instead seek power through elections.
   Zaher Shah's call came a few days after Moslem rebels said they
would reject any U.S.-Soviet deal to end their 11-year-old fight to
oust Kabul's government.
   He issued his appeal in a written statement issued in Rome,
where he has lived in exile since 1973, when his cousin Mohammad
Doaud, staged a coup with the help of Afghanistan's Communists.
   Discussions about how to end the Afghan civil war are expected
to be high on the agenda when President Bush and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev meet in Washington later this month. The
United States sends arms and financial aid to the rebels, as Moscow
does for the Afghan government.
   Western diplomats and observers in Pakistan say one possible
peace agreement could involve free elections run by the United
Nations and the Organization of Islamic Conference, or by a neutral
body chosen by both organizations.
   Zaher Shah said the guerrillas ``should not now lay claim to
political leadership without preparing the opportunity of referring
it to the vote of the Afghan people.''
   Afghanistan's loose coalition of rebel groups is deeply divided.
   Adding to the political difficulties is Afghan President
Najibullah's refusal to step down before any elections _ a
condition set by even the most moderate guerrilla groups.
   Moderates have pushed for the restoration of the 75-year-old
king as the only way to avoid a bloody struggle among rival
guerrilla groups.
   But some radicals have accused the United States of plotting to
return Zaher Shah to Afghanistan to prevent the formation of an
Islamic government.
   The former monarch said today he has ``no personal consideration
or claim to any special privilege whatsoever. My sole objective is
the attainment of national unity and cohesion among the various
sides of Afghan society and the establishment of peace in the
country.''
   In the past, Zaher Shah has said he is ready to offer ``any
service'' in the search for a peaceful political settlement in his
homeland following the withdrawal of Soviet troops in early 1989.
   For nine years, more than 103,000 Soviet soldiers fought
alongside Afghan Communist troops trying to crush the rebels. The
Soviet troops were withdrawn in accordance with a U.N.-brokered
agreement.

   A 5-year-old girl allegedly abducted by her baby
sitter thought their 39-day trip to Florida was a vacation, her
parents say.
   Nicole Ravesi was found safe in a Florida Panhandle fishing
village Thursday night, and 24-year-old Kenneth M. Cole II was
arrested on a federal kidnapping charge.
   The girl's parents, Debra and Frank Ravesi, spoke to reporters
Friday at Boston's Logan Airport on their return from Florida with
their daughter.
   Ravesi said the family had learned from the ordeal not to ``let
anyone get as close to our family as we did before.''
   Authorities said Cole became ``obsessed'' with Nicole after
baby-sitting for her, and kidnapped her April 3 after Mrs. Ravesi
informed him he could no longer see the girl.
   During the time on the road, Cole had Nicole call him ``Dad''
and had asked her to dress up as a little boy, Mrs. Ravesi said.
The girl's hair had been trimmed during her disappearance.
   Mrs. Ravesi said Nicole did not understand what had happened to
her.
   ``She thinks she was on vacation with a friend,'' Mrs. Ravesi
said.
   Medical examinations showed Nicole had not been abused in any
way, her mother said.
   Cole could face life imprisonment if convicted on a federal
kidnapping charge. Prosecutors said he would also be charged in
Massachusetts and could face charges in any other state that he and
the girl traveled through.
   Cole could be flown back to Massachusetts over the weekend, with
a possible court appearance Monday, said Susan Spurlock, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Boston.
   The girl and her accused abductor had been living in a travel
trailer in East Port, Fla., since late last month after spending
time at the Pine Ridge Lodge in Panama City Beach, Fla.,
authorities said.
   Cole, a former co-worker of Mrs. Ravesi's, had lost his job as a
bus driver and frequently baby-sat for the family in the months
before the abduction, the Ravesis said.
   When Nicole was hospitalized last year for a hip infection, the
hospital staff reported Cole to the Department of Social Services
because they saw him kissing her on the lips.
   Social workers told the family in February that Cole's
attachment to Nicole seemed to be obsessive. The Ravesis obtained a
restraining order against Cole to prevent him from seeing or
speaking to Nicole.
   The couple says they allowed Cole to see the child twice after
the five-day restraining order expired because they thought he was
harmless.
   The Ravesis arrived in Tallahassee, Fla., on a private jet
provided by the FOX network television program ``America's Most
Wanted.''
   The case was featured on the show three times last month, said
James Cagnassola Jr., the FBI agent in charge for North Florida.
Tips from the program and other television broadcasts led to Cole's
arrest.

   Military helicopters rushed food and
water today to tens of thousands of people who were left marooned
by a cyclone that killed at least 299 of their countrymen.
   News reports said an estimated 90,000 farm animals died in
India's worst storm in a decade, reducing already sparse food
supplies in many areas.
   Press Trust of India said 20 navy and air force helicopters
dropped 15,400 pounds of food, medicine and water to tens of
thousands of people stranded in the low-lying coastal plain of
Andhra Pradesh state.
   Rainy weather prevented helicopters from reaching thousands of
other people, who passed a third day without food and water.
   The navy sent 50 boats to a small peninsula jutting into the Bay
of Bengal to evacuate thousands of people.
   Officials gave new damage estimates today from the storm, which
struck the southern coastal states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu
on Wednesday with winds up to 155 mph. Tidal waves struck the area
ahead of the storm on Tuesday.
   Officials said $300 million of crops had been destroyed,
including 435,000 acres of rice paddies. Huge tracts of mangos and
bananas were also lost.
   Flood waters continued to rise in some areas.
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh visited the coastal town of Annavarm
where a reservoir flooded, forcing many residents to seek shelter
in a nearby temple.
   Singh said the government would spend at least $52 million to
provide relief for those affected by the storm. But he also
appealed to the public for clothes, medicine and food to help
victims of the cyclone.

<HEAD>Iranian Official Calls for Freeing Hostages, Unfreezing Assets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A top Iranian official called for the
release of Western hostages in Lebanon and said Washington could
show good will by releasing billions of dollars in Iranian assets,
a newspaper reported today.
   The Tehran Times quoted Hussein Musavian, director-general of
Iran's Foreign Ministry, as saying the recent release of two
Americans held in Lebanon was due to his country's efforts.
   ``We believe that all countries, especially those that have
influence in Lebanon, should exert their maximum efforts for the
release of the hostages,'' he said.
   ``The criteria for these efforts should be to release all
hostages regardless of their nationality, solely for humanitarian
causes and without an preconditions or deals.''
   It was the latest in a series of conflicting statements by
Iranian officials on the 16 Western hostages in Lebanon, most of
whom are held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groups.
   The government of President Hashemi Rafsanjani has pressed for
freedom for the captives as a way to improve relations with the
West to thereby get help rebuilding Iran's economy.
   But radicals argue that holding the hostages is a means of
confronting the West, which they view as evil and working against
the interests of Iran.
   After the April release of Americans Robert Polhill, 55, and
Frank Reed, 57, Iran and the hostage-holders demanded a goodwill
gesture from the United States before further releases.
   President Bush has thanked Iran and Syria for their efforts in
securing the releases but has refused to negotiate for hostages.
   Musavian said that as long as the United States continues its
``hostile and negative'' attitude toward Iran, relations between
the countries will not improve.
   ``Their hands are free for taking positive practical steps, such
as the release of Iranian assets frozen by them for years,'' he was
quoted as saying in an interview in Vienna with Austrian
journalists.
   The United States and Iran agreed Wednesday on settling about
3,200 claims, together worth about $50 million, filed against the
Iranian government by U.S. citizens who were in Iran during the
Islamic revolution in 1979.
   Most of the claims involve loss of personal property, and their
settlement was believed to be a step toward settling a
multibillion-dollar dispute that began in 1979 after Washington
froze Iranian assets.
   Iran says the assets amount to $11 billion, but the United
States says the figure is exaggerated.
   The Western hostages in Lebanon include six Americans, four
Britons, two Germans, two Swiss, an Italian and an Irishman.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, 42, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   An explosion rocked a Panamanian tanker drydocked
in the Houston Ship Channel, setting the ship ablaze and injuring
at least three crew members before the fire was extinguished this
morning, authorities said.
   Authorities closed the channel after the fire aboard the Seta
was reported about 6 p.m. Friday to keep flames from spreading to
other ships. But the blaze was extinguished about 12 hours later
and ship channel officials allowed one-way traffic around the
drydocked tanker.
   ``All the significant fires are out on the tanker. But we are
posting a reflash watch, where firefighters make sure there are no
hot spots that might catch fire again,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Mary
Landry.
   Houston firefighters, working from fireboats in the channel, had
battled the three-alarm blaze through the night. At least three
firefighters who entered the burning ship were treated for heat
exhaustion.
   No deaths were reported aboard the 374-foot tanker, and
authorities believed most of its 20 to 25 crew members were
accounted for. But firefighters had been unable by early today to
enter the lowest compartments of the ship to determine whether all
had escaped.
   The flames apparently were confined to the ship's crew quarters
and had not spread to the cargo hold, which contained residues of
four explosive chemicals _ methane, acetone, kerosene and hexane _
said fire department spokesman Joe Phillips.
   ``None of the tanks are on fire,'' Coast Guard Lt. Robert said
late Friday. ``But that's a concern of ours. There's some very
flammable gas in those tanks. It is possible there could be
explosions, so we're spraying a lot of water on them to keep them
cool.''
   The injured crew members suffered burns, said Dr. Paul Pepe,
head of Houston's emergency medical services. Two were in good
condition and one in fair condition early today.
   The Coast Guard was investigating a report that combustible
acetone spilled into the channel from the Seta or another ship and
ignited, triggering the explosion.
   ``We had just finished eating dinner when we heard an explosion.
I just jumped off into the water. I don't know where it came
from,'' said Mandic Dusko, a Yugoslavian electrician on the Seta.
   ``I was sitting here in my camper eating supper and it sounded
like when a big, heavy slab of steel drops, like a crane falling,''
said Alabama Brown, 43, a Houston Ship Repair Co. welder working
nearby. ``I looked out and saw yellow flames about as high as that
yellow crane over there. It just kind of shook the place.''
   The Seta was in drydock to be cleaned, officials said.

<TEXT>
   East German authorities have
decided not to prosecute former hard-line Communist leader Erich
Honecker, citing his failing health, a top-ranking official said in
an interview published today.
   ``We had 40 years of injustice,'' East German Interior Minister
Peter-Michael Diestel told the Hamburg newspaper Welt am Sonntag.
``We don't want to build up democracy with yet another injustice.''
   Honecker, now 77 years old, ruled East Germany with an iron fist
for 18 years before his ouster by a pro-democracy revolution in
October 1989.
   Since then, he has become the focal point of public resentment
against the hard-line Communists, who controlled every facet of
life.
   Late last year, caretaker Communist authorities announced that
they would charge Honecker with high treason, a charge that carries
a life sentence. They said other officials from Honecker's regime
could also be prosecuted.
   Authorities later reduced the planned charges to corruption and
abuse of office. He was accused of embezzling state funds to build
vacation homes and buy luxuries.
   Honecker was arrested in January after undergoing surgery for
kidney cancer and was freed the next day.

   Floodwaters that wreaked havoc in Texas, Arkansas
and Oklahoma swelled into Louisiana today and forecasters said
residents in low-lying areas were not out of danger.
   Intermittent rains fell Friday in the region and were forecast
for the next few days.
   The crest of the Trinity River, which soaked North Texas after
heavy rains a week ago, headed for the Gulf Coast, and authorities
warned residents northeast of Houston to expect more flooding by
next week.
   About 7,000 lowland residents downstream of Lake Livingston Dam,
60 miles northeast of Houston, were told to evacuate their
subdivisions. Three subdivisions in Liberty County remained cut off
from main roads by rising water, said Jim Mitchum, the county's
emergency management coordinator.
   However, many homes in the area sit on nine-foot stilts and
``most people are riding it out,'' he said.
   Among the dangers of staying put are butane and propane tanks
floating downstream and smashing into homes, and fire ants ``by the
pound'' floating on debris into homes, along with racoons and
snakes, he said.
   ``Snakes and fire ants like to ride out the floods, too,''
Mitchum said. ``And there's nothing like seeing fire ants piled a
foot high coming right at you.''
   The Army Corps of Engineers said the volume of water expected to
move through northwestern Louisiana as the Red River drains along
the Texas-Oklahoma border and through Arkansas would exceed the
record floods of 1927 and 1957, but that levees and other flood
control systems built since then would prevent a flood disaster.
   However, about 20 people evacuated from a trailer park Friday as
the Red attacked levees near Shreveport's Downtown Airport.
   In Natchitoches Parish, La., contractors were building a ring
levee on Bayou Poisson, five miles east of Natchitoches, to keep
the Red from backing up into the Cane River and flooding parts of
the city.
   Elsewhere in the parish, in the Vick community, about 50
farmers, using bulldozers, tractors and plows, worked to build up
an earthen levee to keep the water from flooding all their fields.
   The Corps of Engineers said the makeshift levee was three to
five miles long Friday. ``That's a major undertaking to build
something that long that fast,'' said Michael Logue, chief of
public relations for the corps' Vicksburg, Miss., district.
   Along the Oklahoma border, nearly 200 National Guardsmen
continued working around the clock to reinforce levees in the
Texarkana area, where 40 homes were completely submerged.
   Twenty-five Texas counties have been designated as federal
disaster areas due to flooding, which has killed a dozen people in
Texas and one in Oklahoma.
   White House action on Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon's request for
federal aid for 36 of the state's 77 counties was expected next
week. Bellmon asked President Bush on Friday for the disaster
assistance.
   For days, Mike Cox and his family labored to build an earthen
wall to keep the rising Red River out of their convenience store in
Fulton, Ark. On Friday, the river won.
   Their dike crumbled, covering the family's main source of income
with water.
   ``It's very disheartening,'' said Cox, who also lost some nearby
farmland to floodwater.
   Texas Gov. Bill Clements flew over the Trinity and the Red
rivers Friday to view for himself the worst flooding in his state
since the early 1900s.
   Clements met with the president in Kingsville, where Bush
addressed the graduating class of Texas A&amp;I University. Clements
said Bush promised to do his best to aid flood victims.
   The governor, aboard a twin-engine airplane, watched National
Guardsmen and volunteers shore up levees near Texarkana, evacuees
leaving low-lying areas along the Trinity, livestock being moved to
higher, dryer ground and a Texas National Guard helicopter dropping
bales of hay to stranded cattle in north-central Texas.
   Clements also authorized use this weekend of a Texas Guard
helicopter and crew to drop hay to flood-marooned livestock along
the Red River in Arkansas. The Arkansas National Guard doesn't own
a helicopter, Clements' office said.
   ``He's done everything he can from Austin,'' said Clements'
press secretary, Rossanna Salazar. ``And out of concern for the
situation, he wanted to see it firsthand.''
   The Trinity River Authority, which normally releases less than
15,000 cubic feet per second of water at Lake Livingston, on Friday
released 39,300 cubic feet per second. It warned of record releases
as high as 85,000 cubic feet for five days next week.
   Maj. Jack Sherer of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers warned that
banks along the Red River are soft from so much water and pose a
threat.
   ``You could easily slide right into the river and there's not
much chance of surviving,'' he said.

   Squadrons of helicopters and support units
from the six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council began a
six-day joint exercise Saturday, one day before Iran planned naval

   The maneuvers in northern Oman were being supervised by senior
Oman Air Forces officers at Khasab air base, said a Minister of

   Khasab is on the tip of the Musandam peninsula, overlooking the
37-mile length of the Strait of Hormuz separating Oman from Iran.
   The cooperation council groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. Oman has two squadrons
of helicopters that operate across the rugged terrain
characterizing much of the sultanate.
   The council states, who seek collective security as well as
economic unity, have a joint rapid deployment force known as
Peninsula Shield, which is two brigades strong and based in the
northeastern Saudi town of Hafr al-Baten.

<HEAD>Deadline Looms In Canada's Constitutional Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>QUEBEC (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada's constitutional crisis, simmering on the
back burner for the past eight years, has come to a boil with the
approach of the June 23 deadline for bringing feisty,
French-speaking Quebec province into the fold.
   The 6 million Quebecois, who have struggled for two centuries to
preserve the ``difference'' between their province and the rest of
Canada, want that linguistic and cultural distinction acknowledged
in the constitution.
   Some English-speaking Canadians find the idea repugnant. The
disagreement over a constitutional amendment to address Quebec's
concerns has led to renewed fears that the province might opt for
independence and go it alone.
   Canada's new constitution was approved in 1982 over Quebec's
objections. It applies in the province, but the lack of unanimity
left what McGill University law professor Jeremy Webber calls ``a
rankling sore.''
   To remedy the problem, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and the
premiers of all 10 provinces met in April 1987 at a government
retreat called Meech Lake, near Ottawa. They agreed on a
constitutional amendment that addressed Quebec's five main concerns.
   A three-year deadline was set for ratification by provincial
legislatures, and all gave their approval except Manitoba and New
Brunswick. Newfoundland's legislature ratified the Meech Lake
accord, but withdrew the approval after a change of government.
   It's all off unless unanimous ratification is achieved by June
23.
   ``What we are doing now is completing what was done in 1981 and
1982,'' said Gil Remillard, Quebec's minister for intergovernmental
affairs.
   Despite frequently heated debate and constant press coverage,
few people seem to have read the Meech Lake agreement or know what
it contains. The only part virtually everyone is familiar with, and
where the major controversy lies, is the section that calls Quebec
a ``distinct society.''
   That would oblige the Supreme Court to take Quebec's
distinctiveness into account when considering specific laws whose
constitutionality was being challenged. It is an enormously
significant symbol to French-speaking Quebecois.
   Mulroney has said recognizing Quebec as a distinct society
``simply confirms the obvious. Quebec is different, and that
difference is very much worth conserving in the interest of all
Canadians.''
   Opposition is of two basic kinds: anti-French feeling that is
difficult to measure, and the belief that Canada is one country and
the rules should be the same for all.
   The concept of a single Canada is ``a strong argument,'' said
Webber, the McGill professor. ``That kind of position has a lot of
real gut appeal, even among those who are very favorable to the
French fact in Canada.''
   Premier Frank McKenna of New Brunswick, trying to break the
impasse, proposed a ``companion resolution'' to Meech Lake that now
is the subject of parliamentary committee hearings.
   It mainly involves the four other points in the agreement: the
role of the provinces on immigration, allowing provinces to opt out
of federal shared-cost programs, requiring annual conferences of
the prime minister and provincial premiers, and the formula for
amending the constitution.
   Quebec says it will not accept changes in the accord or discuss
related issues until it is approved.
   ``If Meech Lake doesn't pass, that means our five points have
been rejected,'' Remillard said, adding that Quebec's governing
Liberal Party was studying what action to take in that event.
   ``There are people who will feel profoundly affected if it
doesn't pass,'' he said. ``There will be consequences.''
   The widespread sentiment in Quebec and elsewhere is that a deal
will be made before June 23, perhaps to accept the accord as is and
convene a constitutional conference to devise companion measures.
   Remillard said a meeting of the prime minister and premiers
probably would be held this month.
   Polls indicate nationalist sentiment in Quebec is growing.
   ``Quebecois feel they were humiliated in 1982 and that they
cannot submit to a second humiliation, but nobody has an interest
in separation, except maybe the Parti Quebecois,'' said Vincent
Lemieux, a political scientist and analyst at Laval University in
Quebec.
   Businessmen in Quebec, always strongly federalists, support the
Meech Lake accord, but Guy Boulanger, vice president of the Quebec
Chamber of Commerce, said they were ready to take the separatist
road if the agreement was rejected.
   ``The businessmen of Quebec want to do business,'' he said. ``We
have talked enough. The time has come. We don't want a breakup of
Canada. That's the last thing we want, but we are ready to live
with it.''
   Little passion is evident in the nationalist sentiment.
Interviews with a range of Quebecois indicated few really wanted
separation from Canada and that it would be calm if it occurred.
   Neither the provincial nor national government wants separation.
As Mulroney put it: ``What is at stake is enormous, and what is in
dispute is modest.''

   Do television viewers need another program
showcasing the video gimmickry of video camera owners? NBC seems to
think so.
   The network will broadcast the premiere of ``Do-It-Yourself TV''
Sunday night, a slightly different but unmistakable hybrid of
ABC-TV's top-rated ``America's Funniest Home Videos.''
   Dick Clark, who is producing and serving as co-host of the new
show, says he thinks people love to watch the latest rave, no
matter how many times it's duplicated.
   He should know. When he did ``TV's Bloopers &amp; Practical Jokes''
for NBC six years ago, it started its own copycat bonanza. ABC
quickly announced it was doing a celebrity show called ``Foul-ups,
Bleeps &amp; Blunders.''
   How many video shows can the market stand?
   ``They asked the same question when `Bloopers' came to the
fore,'' Clark said Thursday in a phone interview from New York,
``and there were three on at the time.''
   ``Bloopers'' had some home video segments, ``but we weren't
smart enough to think of home video bloopers,'' Clark said.
   ``People in our office were somewhat exercised'' by the success
of ABC's home video show, which premiered as a series in January,
four years after ``Bloopers'' was canceled, Clark said.
   ``If you're not smart enough to think of a new angle, you can't
feel bad about it,'' he said.
   When NBC approached Clark about ``Do-It-Yourself TV,'' a new
angle was exactly what the network wanted.
   CBS had virtually owned Sunday evenings, beginning with the 7
p.m. broadcast of its venerable ``60 Minutes.'' But ABC, with a
program that showed America's warts and stumbles, was now No. 1 in
the time spot.
   For ```Do-It-Yourself TV,'' we came back with the idea of
sending these amateur videographers out on assignment,'' Clark
said. ``There's nothing socially redeeming about these assignments,
they're just crazy.''
   Like having six fully uniformed motorcycle cops singing
``Feelings'' and ``Stop in the Name of Love,'' taping how silly
people look and sound when they sing along to earphones on their
heads, and a pizzeria where the customers are invited to throw a
little dough.
   ``You're not going to learn anything. You're not going to retain
any of it,'' Clark said. ``It's like junk food. It's entertainment.
And I'm not ashamed of that.''

<HEAD>Art Thief Fined For Damaging Matisse Paintings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A burglar who broke into the former
apartment of artist Henri Matisse and stole a cache of paintings
has been fined $1.6 million for damaging the works.
   The Correctional Tribunal of Nice also handed down a three-year
suspended sentence Friday to Frank Cochet, 24, a drug addict who
scaled the building Dec. 22 and broke in through the fourth-floor
shuttered windows.
   Cochet came upon the Matisse apartment by random, police said.
He made off with $12.9 million in paintings.
   Police said Cochet damaged several works as he ripped them out
of their frames. All were recovered in the backseat of his car when
police arrested him two weeks later.
   Art restorers testified that most of the works were damaged and
would require the amount of the fine to repair. The damage to
``Pink Nude'' alone depreciated its value from $4.3 million to $1.2
million, they said.
   Police said there is little chance Cochet will ever be able to
pay the full fine to the heirs of Matisse, who died in 1954.

<HEAD>Democrats Wary of Upcoming Budget Parley</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like all savvy politicians, Sen. James Sasser
has his mind riveted on two different spots on the eve of next
week's budget summit: his adversaries and Peoria, Ill.
   The Senate Budget Committee chairman is among 21 lawmakers who
begin bargaining with President Bush on Tuesday on how to slash the
federal deficit. Going in, Sasser and the 10 other Democratic
negotiators have two major worries.
   Why spend weeks haggling over tax increases, spending cuts and
other politically perilous moves if the public is not demanding
action to shrink the budget gap, they ask.
   ``As far as the lady in Peoria is concerned, she doesn't see the
problem,'' Sasser, D-Tenn., said last week.
   Democrats want Bush to publicly explain how bad the deficit
situation is so an unconcerned public doesn't blame Democrats for
whatever painful measures emerge from the talks.
   They also see this as a way to spur Congress into approving any
deficit-reduction plan that is negotiated.
   ``Unless we do a better job convincing the American public this
is a serious problem, it will be difficult to get a package that
can be adopted by either House,'' said House Budget Committee
Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   Also troubling Democrats is the question of why the
administration is so eager to talk now about the deficit problem.
Some of them think they scent a whiff of politics in the air.
   Democrats agree with the White House's concern that an economic
slowdown could be on the way. Unemployment ticked upward last
month, and there is unease over whether interest rates may be
heading upward.
   Democrats also accept administration budget chief Richard
Darman's new projections that there's a need to find $60 billion to
$100 billion in savings for next year. That is the amount of cuts
necessary to reduce the 1991 deficit to $64 billion, the target set
by the Gramm-Rudman law.
   Even in a $1.2 trillion budget, $60 billion to $100 billion is
an enormous sum. It's also double the $37 billion in savings Bush
said would be necessary when he unveiled his 1991 budget last
January.
   This makes Democrats suspicious because the only thing new about
Darman's deficit forecast is that Darman is making it. Others have
been expecting the shortfall to be that high for months.
   Since January, Democrats have been complaining that the
administration was underestimating the size of the shortfall. They
argued that Bush was counting on a strong performance by the
economy that was unlikely.
   The same month Bush proposed his budget, the non-partisan
Congressional Budget Office estimated that $74 billion in budget
cuts would be needed next year. The private publication Blue Chip
Financial Forecast surveyed 50 economists and found a consensus
that $54 billion in savings would be necessary _ not including the
tens of billions needed to bail out the savings and loan industry.
   Many Democrats believe the administration simply wants to
administer whatever tough medicine the economy needs now, rather
than wait and risk a downturn close to Bush's 1992 re-election
campaign.
   ``There is some sense the economy is in trouble,'' Sasser said
last week. ``Even if it staggers through this year and the first of
next year, you might have a recession by the time the president is
getting his election campaign geared up.''
   Other theories abound among Democrats.
   Some think Republicans want to trap Democrats into backing an
election-year tax increase. Others think Bush was frightened by the
recent passage by the Senate Budget Committee and the full House of
Democratic-written budgets that slashed the president's defense
program.
   What's clear is if Bush and Congress do not agree to reduce the
deficit, the Gramm-Rudman law will do it automatically.
   Without a budget deal, the law will slash defense and domestic
spending on Oct. 1 _ the start of fiscal 1991 _ by whatever amount
is needed to shrink the deficit to $64 billion. Most in Washington
agree that such cuts would be unbearable for the millions of
Americans who rely on the government for aid and for business.
   ``The president thinks this is a good opportunity to get going,
that time's a wasting,'' said Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota,
ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee. ``We don't have a
lot of time to work this out.''

<HEAD>Senate Hopeful Lynn Martin Getting Little Help From Women's Groups</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women's groups are in a quandary over which
U.S. Senate candidate to back in Illinois, where the choice is
between sending a woman to the Senate and re-electing a longtime
ally who happens to be male.
   There has been no rush by women's groups to endorse five-term
Republican Rep. Lynn Martin in her bid to oust liberal Democratic
Sen. Paul Simon.
   The National Organization for Women, whose goals include
electing more women to the Senate, doesn't know whom to choose.
   The National Women's Political Caucus also is undecided. And the
Women's Campaign Fund, which has backed Martin in the past, plans
to stay on the sidelines.
   The race is one of the most closely watched Senate contests in
the country this year, with Simon, 61, leading in public opinion
polls thus far.
   ``Paul Simon has been there for us on a lot of occasions,'' said
Patricia Ireland, vice president of NOW. ``It's a very tough thing.
... I'm sitting here with big question marks over my head.''
   Martin, 50, is trying to convince voters that Simon, a
Democratic presidential nominee in 1988, is a tax-loving liberal
who is too concerned with issues outside the state. Like her
opponent, Martin supports abortion rights.
   Ireland said the Simon-Martin matchup creates a difficult choice
for NOW because the group is interested in the ``feminization of
power'' but also values Simon's stalwart support.
   ``There's a large part of our organization that feels very
strongly that women ought to be given the benefit of the doubt in
every case,'' Ireland said. ``A number of our people are very
interested in Lynn Martin's campaign for that reason, and also to
strengthen the pro-choice Republican part of the party.''
   Affection for Simon aside, NOW is concerned about Martin's
conservative record on economic issues. She has received high marks
from the pro-business U.S. Chamber of Commerce and low marks from
labor.
   ``There are people who look at Lynn Martin's various votes and
question whether she's going to be more pro-business in ways that
will mean she's not going to be able to support employee benefits
that we're looking for,'' Ireland said.
   Martin softened that image Thursday when she was one of only 39
Republicans to vote for a House bill that would grant unpaid leaves
to workers who have family emergencies _ legislation pushed by
women's groups.
   Martin says the only way to elect more women to the Senate is
for groups like NOW to give challengers a chance. Currently there
are two women in the 100-member Senate, Democrat Barbara Mikulski
of Maryland and Republican Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas.
   ``If part of your constitution says we need more women in
office, then they need to look at opportunities and say, `Hey,
we've got a chance for one,''' Martin said.
   ``If you say, `Well, this incumbent has been good to us,' it
means you'll never be supporting women because (women) are always
the challengers.''
   Several groups with female constituencies have decided to back
Simon or stay out of the race. Some, like the National Women's
Political Caucus, are simply waiting for Martin to show some
interest.
   ``We sent her a questionnaire and it has not been returned,''
said Beth Bourland, who heads the group's Illinois chapter.
   ``She has not solicited the caucus' endorsement,'' Bourland
said. ``I would think she would want to garner all the strength she
could get.''
   Martin said her campaign was trying to contact all groups. Her
campaign spokeswoman, Kathy Lydon, said Martin had no endorsements
to report but suggested it was too early.
   ``We'll be reaching out to as many as possible, especially
women's business groups,'' Lydon said.
   The Women's Campaign Fund, which helped Martin during her House
elections, is remaining neutral in the Illinois Senate race, but in
Rhode Island it is backing Republican Rep. Claudine Schneider's bid
to oust Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell.
   ``Lynn Martin is solidly pro-choice, no question about it,''
said the fund's Jane Danowitz. ``But we've traditionally had a
policy of not supporting women who challenge incumbents solid on
our issues.''
   The National Abortion Rights Action League credits Simon for
having ``consistently shown leadership'' and has contributed at
least $5,000 to his campaign, said NARAL spokeswoman Loretta Ucelli.

   Up to 50 Turkish demonstrators
Saturday threw bricks and fired an air pistol at their nation's
consulate to demand the establishment of a leftist government in
Turkey, police said.
   Four protesters were arrested, said police spokesman Otto
Beaujon. The demonstrators later continued their noisy protest
outside a nearby police station.
   The incident, in which six windows at the consulate were
smashed, followed last month's arson attack against the building,
when unknown vandals splashed gasoline on the consulate's front
door and torched it, he said.
   The building had been under permanent police guard since then,
Beaujon said.
   There are several Communist and other leftist political groups
among the approximately 150,000 Turkish nationals living in the
Netherlands.

   Battling a proliferation of racial and ethnic
tensions, Mayor David Dinkins called on New Yorkers to fight
prejudice where they live, and promised to do whatever is necessary
to quell public disturbances.
   Dinkins, who had been criticized for not acting forcefully
enough against a rash of race-related incidents, gave a half-hour
speech Friday night carried live by several local television and
radio stations.
   New York's first black mayor said the nation's largest city has
many problems, including expensive housing, crack and AIDS
epidemics, and a faltering economy.
   ``Unfortunately, some small-minded people prey upon these
pressures, spreading a message not of unity but of division. ... I
challenge all of the people of this city to reject these calls to
bigotry,'' he said.
   ``All of us want to live our lives in peace and dignity _ free
to walk any street and shop in any store, at any time, in any
neighborhood, without fear of force or violence.''
   A few hours before he spoke, scores of demonstrators jostled a
defense attorney outside a Brooklyn courtroom where juries are
weighing evidence against two white men charged in the August
shooting of a black teen-ager.
   Some have warned that violence is possible if the juries do not
return murder verdicts for Keith Mondello and Joseph Fama in the
death of 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins. The two juries, one for each
defendant, resumed work this morning.
   A banner hung between two trees outside the court read: ``Civil
rights or civil war.''
   Dinkins said violence was unwarranted despite frustrations, and
said he would do ``whatever is necessary'' to maintain security and
public order.
   He offered to personally negotiate an end to a 4-month-old
boycott against two Korean stores in the Brooklyn borough.
   The boycott began over a tussle between a black customer and a
storeowner, but picketing protesters have appealed to underlying
resentment against immigrants with ethnic slurs and calls for the
Koreans to ``go home.''
   Dinkins said: ``This is bigger than just one boycott in
Brooklyn.''
   A brawl erupted last week at a Brooklyn college during a speech
by a professor who believes in white superiority. A Columbia
University sports banquet was disrupted by a soccer player's verbal
attack on homosexuals and Jews.
   In a much-publicized case, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist
Jimmy Breslin was suspended for two weeks by New York Newsday after
slurring an Asian-American co-worker.
   Michael Kang, executive director of the Korean Produce
Association, called Dinkins' speech ``diplomatic, a cosmetic
treatment. Nothing more, nothing less.'' Of Dinkins' offer to
mediate the conflict surrounding the Korean markets, Kang said:
``We want it to stop immediately _ no more talking.''
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, who earlier this week said violence could
erupt if the Hawkins defendants is not found guilty, said the
mayor's speech was long overdue.
   ``I think it's three months too late,'' said Sharpton. ``The
fact that the mayor goes on television to say we're not in a
tinderbox situation shows that we're in a tinderbox situation.''
   Dinkins called bigotry ``an old story, a cycle of immigration
and discrimination that's as old as this city itself.''
   Blacks, Jews, and immigrants from Ireland, Italy and other
countries have all faced violence, he said.
   ``New times bring new Americans who become new targets,'' he
said.
   Dinkins outlined a plan to help heal divisions around the city,
including the formation of a law enforcement group to battle gang
activities and develop a new law against mob violence.
   He also called for the city to study discrimination in
bank-lending practices and create a new bias strike force.

   In recent months, the Soviet Union has
seen many hostile confrontations between crowds representing
opposite points of view, and in the southern republics such
confrontations have turned violent.
   In Latvia, a recent standoff turned into a sing-off.
   In the tense hours before the May 4 vote on independence, a
crowd of proponents and opponents of the measure stood toe-to-toe
outside the Supreme Soviet parliament. But instead of fisticuffs or
insults, they ended up trying to drown each other out with their
rendition of Soviet and Latvian songs.
   After independence was passed and thousands converged on the
Daugava River's bank for a celebration, it was time to sing some
more. Not just one song, but a whole concert: from ``On the Shores
of the Daugava'' to ``Not Through Laziness and Waste,'' a song
touting the virtues of diligence.
   ``We always sing this much,'' a Latvian said between refrains.

   It was two days after Latvia's declaration of independence, and
the Soviet army was trying to put on its best face at Riga military
stadium for the annual World War II Victory Day show.
   There were parachutists, prancing horses, motorcycle daredevils
and race cars competing for applause under the hot May sun.
   But if the exhibition this year could also be interpreted as a
show of force aimed at secession-minded Latvians, then the real
clincher was yet to come.
   A young soldier set up a pile of bricks, topped them with some
tiles, poured gasoline on them, and set them ablaze. The soldier
suddenly squatted and demolished the flaming foot-high pile _ with
his head.

   In the stands, Col. General Fyodor Kuzmin, commander of the
Baltic military district, steadfastly ignored two Western reporters
throughout the event.
   He also refused to be interviewed when the show was over.
   But maybe he just didn't want to stand up: as he stalked away,
the seat of his dress uniform revealed white stains from the new
whitewash on the stadium's benches.

   The signs usually seen at political protests in Soviet republics
condemn Moscow as an imperialist occupying power.
   But some of the die-hard Russians picketing outside Latvia's
parliament building had slogans asking for mercy for the Soviet
Union.
   One sign depicted ravenous dogs tearing off chunks of the Soviet
map. Another said: ``There have been worse times but none lower,''
implying a betrayal of Moscow.
   ``They're pulling the country apart like dogs,'' Svetlana
Marushchenko said. ``When things are bad in the country, you
mustn't do things like this.''

<HEAD>Corporate Backing of Huge Smithsonian Display Causes Concern</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Smithsonian Institution is drawing heavy
crowds _ and stirring some controversy _ with a huge new exhibit
that traces the information revolution from Samuel F.B. Morse's
first primitive telegraph to an arcade of bleeping computer screens.
   Criticism of the ``Information Age'' show, which opened
Wednesday for a permanent engagement at the National Museum of
American History, stems partly from the decision to let corporate
sponsors pick up the $10 million tab for the largest and perhaps
the most expensive exhibition in Smithsonian history.
   The Washington Post raised the issue of corporate sponsorship in
a lengthy critique of the exhibition, and a reporter questioned
museum director Roger Kennedy on the subject at a briefing last
week.
   Kennedy insisted that the show's content was not influenced in
any way by IBM, AT&amp;T, Unysis, Xerox and other industry giants who
completely bankrolled the exhibit.
   He said the Smithsonian was forced to rely on private support
because congressional budget cuts had left his museum without any
federal funds to mount major exhibitions.
   He dismissed the suggestions of corporate pressure, saying it
was like ``being pelted with beer cans from the bleachers.''
   His boss, Secretary of the Smithsonian Robert McC. Adams, hinted
at some personal misgivings over another aspect of the exhibition,
which climaxes with a daunting display of high-tech wizardry.
   ``I'm not satisfied we have the public well enough
represented,'' Adams said.
   Adams said ``we need to do better'' in dealing with the impact
of computer technology on human beings, such as the potential for
invasion of privacy, the hacker problem and the boredom of sitting
all day at a word processor.
   For all that, the exhibition is a undeniably a dazzler.
   Five years in the making, it boasts 700 artifacts and as many
graphics in 14,000 square feet of gallery space on the museum's
ground floor, which has been wired with more than 10 miles of extra
cable.
   The show includes 78 computers capable of handling a billion
instructions every second and storing the equivalent of a million
typewritten pages of information. There are 43 video monitors, 52
laser videodisc players, 20 ``touch screen'' displays and 24
bar-code scanners _ enough to equip checkout counters at a couple
of supermarkets.
   Visitors begin with a view of Morse's original telegraph
transmitter, conceived in 1832, and exit through a state-of-the-art
chamber of wonders where the sound of Billy Taylor's jazz piano can
be transformed into a cathedral choir at the touch of a button.
   In between, the exhibit includes a working, 2-ton robot once
used to weld automobile bodies at a General Motors plant in
Delaware, the R2-D2 and C3PO robots of ``Star Wars'' fame and the
first public display of the long-secret mechanical computers or
``bombes'' that enabled the Allies to decipher the Germans' vaunted
Enigma radio code in World War II.
   Along the way, there is a 1930s radio studio, a newsreel
theater, early phonograph records and the television camera used to
broadcast the historic Kennedy-Nixon presidential debate in 1960,
plus the UNIVAC I computer that predicted Dwight D. Eisenhower's
victory on election night of 1952.
   Smithsonian officials predicted that the ``Information Age''
will serve as a future model for other museums because of its
unprecedented opportunities for hands-on visitor participation at
computerized displays.
   Viewers can tap out the international distress signal at a
re-creation of the Titanic's radio room, talk over the same
telephone wire used by Alexander Graham Bell, punch in their
demographic profiles to retrieve 1890 census data and ``analyze''
their fingerprints using the FBI's early National Crime
Identification Center computer.
   Sitting at separate computer terminals, visitors can simulate
producing a TV news show, handling a 911 emergency call or trading
on the international currency market. After a few minutes of
frantic buying and selling, based on news flashes on the screen,
the computer informed one visitor that he'd just lost $28,312.
   ``This is the most ambitious, the most wide-ranging and most
prodigious show we have ever done, and it will stay here,'' Adams
said. Museum officials said the exhibit will be updated constantly
to reflect technological advances and suggestions from visitors.
   ``The movement, processing and storage of huge and rapidly
growing amounts of information is not something impersonal _ out
there,'' Adams said. ``The Information Age is probably the driving
force in what has already differentiated us sharply from our
grandparents.''

   Companions said Soe Win, a villager
kidnapped by Burmese troops, collapsed on a forced border trek, his
strength sapped by lung disease and the huge load of rice and
mortar shells on his back.
   Because he was no longer useful as a porter, they said, a
soldier of the 66th Infantry Division smashed Soe Win's head
against a rock half a dozen times and kicked his lifeless body down
the mountainside. Two other porters said they witnessed the death
and were able to escape.
   Many stories like theirs are heard along the frontier between
Thailand and Burma. A decades-old war between Burma's repressive
government and ethnic minorities seeking autonomy has turned the
frontier into region of brutality, deceit and despoiled
environment. And a growing tide of refugees is beginning to alarm
foreign aid agencies.
   The war initially attracted little attention because it was
remote and Burma kept foreigners out of the area, but the scale and
violence have grown dramatically in recent years.
   After brutally crushing a pro-democracy uprising in September
1988, the military rulers in Rangoon turned their attention to the
Thai border.
   Burma was bankrupt, but ethnic rebels were making millions of
dollars smuggling consumer goods, jade, antiques, timber and
sometimes narcotics across a porous frontier 1,350 miles long.
   Most of the world has shunned the Rangoon generals, who found
allies in powerful Thai military and business circles.
   Deals were made. The Thais got access to one of the world's last
great teak forests in exchange for hard currency, part of which
financed an army campaign to clear the border so the deals could be
carried out.
   Conservation groups and the U.S. Congress have criticized the
destruction of the forest.
   ``The scale of the logging is mind-boggling,'' a Western
official said on condition of anonymity. ``The Thais are hacking it
out as fast as they can. They know the honeymoon won't last
forever.''
   By most accounts, the Burmese army's border campaign has been
ruthless.
   Refugees, aid workers, escaped porters and guerrillas along the
frontier and in rebel-controlled areas of Burma told of villages
razed and rice stocks burned.
   They spoke of civilians tortured and shot, including children;
of whole village populations taken from their homes and herded into
areas controlled by the military.
   Two groups of porters, totaling 50 men and boys ranging in age
from a 57-year-old farmer to a 14-year-old cowherd, described
grueling marches, starvation diets and walking ahead of the
soldiers as human mine detectors.
   Others were shot down while trying to escape, they said. Several
of the survivors, who included ethnic minorities and majority
Burmese, had scars they said resulted from beatings.
   Wallace Yay, coordinator of aid to refugees from the Karen
minority in Thailand, said: ``The Burmese military has shown a
willingness to shoot down its own, but in minority areas it just
lets loose.''
   ``I don't think genocide is too strong a term to describe what
the Burmese military is doing,'' said Court Robinson of the U.S.
Committee for Refugees, a private group. ``It is clear they are
trying to eliminate the ethnics as a political and cultural
entity.''
   Burma has denied such allegations, including those Amnesty
International made in two detailed reports issued in 1988.
   Amnesty International, a human rights group based in London,
cited ``a consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights''
against the Karen, Kachin, Mon, Karenni and Shan minorities.
   It and other organizations also have noted the use of terrorist
tactics by guerrilla groups, but no evidence has emerged that the
scale or intensity of such acts approaches that of the army.
   The border campaign has spurred flight into Thailand, increasing
the number of refugees in the frontier area to at least 40,000.
Most are from ethnic minorities, but they also include Burmese
students and other dissidents, several thousand of whom joined the
rebels during the 1988 repression.
   Robinson and other aid officials believe tens of thousands more
may flee.
   Refugees say word that the Burmese are coming is enough to send
everyone in a village fleeing to the jungle.
   Thailand's government does not grant refugee status to people
who have fled Burma. Little aid has been forthcoming from foreign
agencies, in contrast to the enormous international effort made for
those from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos who have sought refuge in
Thailand.
   Over the years, the so-called ``forgotten refugees'' have
received modest help from the private French agency Doctors Without
Borders and a consortium of more than a dozen Christian groups.
   Now, the needs are greater.
   ``We cannot live on rice, salt and fish paste for long,'' said
Mya Thein, leader of 4,000 Karen civilians who crossed the border
early in February. He said some of the children had cholera.
   About 150 Burmese students and other dissidents live in a
section of what is called Mawke Camp. They ask why the world pays
so much attention to those who fled military repression in China
and so little to them, in their crude huts and malarial jungle.
   ``I think we will be here a long time,'' said Mya Thein, a high
school principal who lost his left leg to a Burmese mortar in 1987.
``In the past, the Burmese would take an area, hold it for a while
and then retreat when the rains came. Now I think they will stay
because of the logs.''
   Rebel officers claim Burmese troops have been allowed to use
Thai territory to surround Karen positions and have been taken
inside the teak forest in trucks owned by Thai logging companies.
   Burmese students say Thailand's actions will not be forgotten if
democracy comes to their country.

   President Bush today announced the
creation of a volunteer ``Citizens Democracy Corps'' to help
Eastern European countries rebuild political and economic
institutions on a western model.
   The corps would set up a clearinghouse for U.S. private
assistance programs that want to help the east Europeans ``to
stregthen the foundations of free society in Eastern Europe,'' Bush
told a graduation audience.
   ``We can help them build political systems based on respect for
individual freedoms, for the right to speak our mind, to live as we
wish, and to worship as our conscience tells us we must,'' he said
in a University of South Carolina commencement address.
   He also announced that the U.S. Export-Import Bank will begin
extending Poland a new line of medium-term export credits and loan
guarantees to purchase U.S.-produced machinery, technology and
supplies.
   The Citizens Democracy Corps will match European requests for
assistance with U.S. private sector groups that have expressed a
desire to help, the White House said in a statement.
   The program to be directed by a group of presidential
appointees, is expected to facilitate help in such areas as:
constitutional law and parliamentary procedures, English language
training, journalism and publishing, public health, market
economics and banking, business law, agriculture and commerces and
environemntal protection.
   The government will provide ``initial funding,'' the White House
said without giving a figure. The corps would then create its own
financial base.
   The system will be geared to ease the transformation for
countries that have seen ``a landscape of moral destruction'' under
repressive regimes that were based on the ``perversion of law,''
Bush said. The communist regimes all had laws and courts but those
were just ``the empty shell of liberty,'' he added.
   ``We've got to help the emerging democracies build legal systems
that secure the procedual rights that preserve fredom,'' he said.
``And above all, a system that supports a strict equality of
rights.''
   He said the new democracies ``will look to their own
parliamentary past, to Europe's example, and of course, to our own
American Constitution,'' as they form their governments. ``That is
why we must export our experience, our two centuries of accumulated
wisdom on the workings of free government.''
   The South Carolina appearance, the second in a trio of weekend
graduation speeches, came between an address Friday at Texas A&amp;I
University and a speech on community service later today at Liberty
University, a Lynchburg, Va., institution founded by television
preacher Jerry Falwell.
   His remarks on democracy today came on the heels of the
administration's decision to call home its ambassador from Romania
to protest the new government's reported tactics of intimidation
and harassment of political opponents.
   Ambassador Alan Green Jr. was recalled for consultations after
the ruling National Salvation Front, which assumed leadership after
the fall of communist President Nicolae Ceausescu, was implicated
in incidents of organized campaign-related violence.
   Bush on Friday talked to students at Texas A&amp;I in Kingsville,
Texas, about his vision of a manned mission to Mars within 30 years.
   With the government already deeply in debt, the president didn't
say how he might pay for the expensive program.
   ``Thirty years is a long time,'' he told reporters when asked
where the government would find money for his plan to return
Americans to the moon and send them on to Mars.
   But he said the United States will have to ``go fairly fast'' to
meet his timetable.
   ``It's time to open up the final frontier,'' he said in his
address. ``Thirty years ago, NASA was founded and the space race
began. And 30 years from now I believe man will stand on another
planet.''
   Bush later today was returning to Washington, where his
administration has been talking with congressional leaders about
negotiations on a 1991 budget and deficit reduction.
   The president told reporters Friday that he is sticking with his
pledge of ``no preconditions'' in budget talks, despite opposite
signals from his chief of staff, John Sununu.

   America's corporate leaders are
tempering their belief in moderate growth for the U.S. economy with
concern about sluggishness in banking, finance, real estate and
construction.
   None of the 100 leaders of the nation's top corporations at the
semiannual meeting this weekend of the Business Council were heard
to forecast a robust economy.
   Some, however, sprinkled their conversations with optimism about
their individual business sectors: aircraft, automobiles, heavy
electric machinery, pharmaceuticals and supermarket goods.
   The corporate leaders heard their economists forecast a
gradually accelerating U.S. economy during 1990 and 1991, erasing
fears of a recession projected at their last meeting at this
mountain resort in October.
   Overall, council economists said economic activity would grow 2
percent this year and 2.6 percent in 1991. This included a 1.9
percent expansion in the first half of this year and a 2.3 percent
gain in the second half.
   Roger B. Smith, council chairman and chairman of General Motors
Corp., indicated his belief the automobile industry was reviving
from the economic doldrums of the past year.
   Although sales incentives may hurt earnings, ``it does portend
to be a pretty good year,'' he said.
   Automobiles and other durable goods _ expensive items expected
to last more than three years _ have been hurt in the last year by
the Federal Reserve's high-interest policies. Consumers generally
must borrow to pay for those items.
   The council's economists, in a report Friday, raised the growth
forecast for industrial production this year to 2.1 percent from an
earlier estimate of 1.9 percent. ``And production growth is
expected to quicken to 2.8 percent during 1991,'' they said.
   John F. Welch Jr., chairman of General Electric Co., also said
the aircraft industry, which has huge backlogs of orders, and the
heavy electric machinery sector were very strong.
   Welch noted particularly ``an enormous worldwide need for power
generation equipment.'' He said the ``short-cycle'' sector _
lighting, appliances, plastic products _ was in moderate shape.
   John G. Smale, chairman of the Procter &amp; Gamble Co., said the
consumer products business was strong both in the United States and
abroad.
   And Edmund T. Pratt Jr., chairman of Pfizer Inc., described the
health care industry as being in another ``golden era.''
   ``There has been an explosion of new products in both
pharmaceuticals and medical devices,'' he said.
   But both Pratt and Welch deplored the rising costs of health
care, saying they would prefer, in Welch's words, ``a tradeoff: a
little weaker medical business in return for lower medical costs.''
   On the other hand, several corporate leaders told of continuing
weakness gripping their industries.
   ``The banking business in the United States is going to be
difficult, tough,'' said John S. Reed, chairman of Citicorp, the
huge New York bank.
   Part of the problem is a diminishing real estate market which,
he said, continues to weaken. Corporate banking business also is
not particularly strong, he added.
   Reed said that while credit card use continues to be strong, the
banking industry is seeing some consumers taking longer to pay
their debts.
   Another banking executive, Willard C. Butcher, chairman of Chase
Manhattan Bank, said the weakness in the corporate finance sector
is ``a sign of the collapse of the junk bond market.''
   S.D. Bechtel Jr., chairman of the giant engineering and
construction company bearing his name, said domestic construction
spending is down although improvement is forecast for next year.
   ``Internationally, there generally is more construction activity
now than a year ago and we think it's going to pick up,'' Bechtel
said.

<HEAD>Radio Messages From MARS? Just Soldiers' Way of Saying, `Hi, Mom'</HEAD>

   Messages from soldiers stationed overseas
are flooding the Army's military radio system here with love, best
wishes and hugs for their stateside moms.
   ``Happy Mother's Day. The money is on the way,'' an Army private
in West Germany said in his radiogram beamed from Europe to his
mother in Las Vegas. ``Love ya always. One great big Mommy hug.''
   The message was sent over the Army's Military Affiliate Radio
System, a network of 100 military stations and 4,000 amateur radio
operators who send and receive radio messages for soldiers
worldwide.
   It's faster than the mail and cheaper than the telephone.
   Mother's Day is the busiest day for MARS, which has a more
important role of providing radio training for soldiers and
emergency communications for military, civil or disaster officials.
   ``On Father's Day, you see a few, but everybody I guess feels
obligated to send to Mom,'' said Tom Moore, who directs MARS
traffic in the eastern third of the United States from Fort Detrick
in Frederick.
   ``Happy Mother's Day, Mom. You are the greatest. Wishing you to
keep strong,'' an Army captain stationed in West Germany said in
his MARS-gram to his mom in Utica, N.Y.
   The 400 messages a day received by Fort Detrick MARS operators
around Mother's Day exceed the number that soldiers send to their
sweethearts on Valentine's Day. Normally, the Fort Detrick station
receives about 100 messages a day.
   Soldiers can send messages free of charge from about 100 MARS
stations in a dozen countries. The MARS-grams then are bounced via
radio waves to the nearest ``gateway,'' or access station, Moore
said.
   The eastern area station at Fort Detrick is the busiest of six
gateway stations in the Army MARS network, which handles an
estimated 650,000 MARS-grams each year.
   The other domestic gateways are in bases near San Antonio,
Seattle, and Honolulu. The foreign gateways are in Seoul, Korea,
and Lohnsfeld, West Germany.
   The gateway station sends each message to a regional MARS
station, which relays it to the appropriate state affiliate
operator, he said.
   From that point, the messages are handled by ham radio operators
who volunteer a minimum 12 hours every three months to keep the
MARS network complete.
   The operators, who are licensed by the Federal Communications
Commission and trained in military communications, relay the
message among themselves until it is as close as possible to its
destination. The last radio operator picks up a telephone and calls
the appropriate party with the soldier's message.
   ``If it's a toll call, the operator is authorized to put it in
the mail and the Department of the Army covers the cost of the
postage,'' Moore said.
   A. Earl Vivino, a 75-year-old retired cardiologist from
Walkersville, has been handling MARS-grams for nearly 60 years.
   ``As a doctor, I know that the most important thing in life is
helping people. When you're sending a message, you're helping
people,'' said Vivino, who handles about 100 messages a month.
``They're so happy to have someone give them a message from
overseas.''
   There are some limits to the contents. ``It can't be commercial
and it can't be vulgar, but just about anything else goes,'' said
Moore. He said the most risque message probably would be rated
PG-13. ``You can't do business. You can't tell your broker to sell
30 shares of this and buy 40 of that.''
   The MARS network also allows soldiers stationed abroad to talk
with relatives or friends in the United States for a fraction of
the cost of an overseas call. Army MARS handles about 6,500 ``phone
patches'' a year.
   A soldier in West Germany, for example, could get a radio
connection with a MARS operator in Frederick. That operator could
call the soldier's family in West Virginia and connect the phone to
the radio hookup so the two parties could talk, Moore said.
   The soldier or family would be billed for a long-distance call
from Frederick to West Virginia, rather than one from West Germany
to West Virginia.
   ``Everything gets through,'' Moore said. ``An incorrect address
or phone number on the sender's part is the only thing that screws
it up.''

<HEAD>Senate Resolution Would Condemn Iran for Human Rights Violations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate is ready to vote on a non-binding
resolution that calls on President Bush to do something about the
persecution of an Iranian religious sect.
   Despite some improvement in the way Tehran treats members of the
Baha'i religious faith, many are still denied basic freedoms, their
representatives and lawmakers say.
   The Senate resolution, which could be considered as early as
Tuesday, expresses ``concern that the Baha'i community as a whole
remains an oppressed minority which is denied legal recognition ...
which would permit Baha'is to organize, hold property, operate
religious schools.''
   The measure asks that the United States work with other
governments to help the Baha'is and provide humanitarian assistance
for those fleeing Iran.
   The House passed a similiar resolution on a 404-0 vote in
February. House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., championed
the measure.
   Although the Senate resolution is non-binding, it comes at a
time when the Bush administration wants to see Iran use its
influence to help gain the release of American and other Western
hostages being held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon. Two Americans
have been released in recent weeks.
   Administration officials say there have been no deals to free
the hostages and have called for the unconditional release of the
seven Americans who remain in captivity.
   Nontheless, President Bush has said that in his dealings with
Iran ``goodwill begets goodwill.''
   The resolution's principal sponsor, Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., said the administration has not taken a position on the
measure.
   ``I haven't heard from them,'' Dodd said last week.
   But the 1989 State Department's human rights report cited Iran
as a ``major violator'' of human rights. Treatment of the Baha'is
was a big concern, the report said.
   Resolutions such as the one criticizing Iran have no legal
muscle, but they can have a broad impact on foreign affairs.
   Turkey, for instance, was so angry about a Senate resolution on
alleged Armenian genocide that it threatened to close U.S. military
bases. The measure, pushed by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., was defeated.
   Two months ago, a group of lawmakers, including Dodd and Sens.
John Heinz, R-Pa., and Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of a
House Middle East subcommittee, wrote a letter to the U.N.
Commission on Human Rights asking the group to act on behalf of
Baha'is.
   While ``conditions for individual Baha's in Iran have improved
somewhat in recent months ... the community as a whole remains an
oppressed minority,'' they said.
   ``We understand that Iranian representatives have lobbied
vigorously for the past decade against any U.N. consideration of
their country's human rights practices, and have opposed in
particular any references to the Baha'is,'' the letter said.
   The United States and Iran have no formal diplomatic relations.
They communicate through third parties and have face-to-face
contact at the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal at The Hague.
   Last week, negotiators announced the United States and Iran had
arrived at a tentative, $105 million settlement of more than 2,000
U.S. small claims pending since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
   Experts familiar with Iran say that country's leaders are eager
for better relations with the United States and the West in general
as they try to rebuild a country devastated by the eight-year-old
war with Iran.
   Meantime, Jeffrey Huffines, a spokesman for the Baha'is in the
United States, said the congressional resolution and U.N. concern
have focused attention on the Baha'is and resulted in some
improvement in their condition.
   For instance, he said only eight Baha'is remain imprisoned in
Iran in April, food ration cards are available and some Baha'is
have retrieved their confiscated property.
   Baha'i children are also allowed in secondary schools, but have
not been able to enroll in universities, he said. There have been
no executions of Baha'is since December 1988.
   The Baha'i faith is a worldwide religion that originated in Iran
in the 1840s. Their faith is in conflict with Islam which teaches
there can be no revelations after Mohammed, some 1200 years before
the Baha'is were organized.

   Sandra Schultz's worst nightmare came true
last week when the man convicted of killing her 19-year-old son and
his fiance walked out of jail.
   Now, her greatest dream is to see Dale Johnston behind bars
again. But prosecutors who dropped the case after a key piece of
evidence was thrown out say they would reopen it only if new
evidence surfaced.
   Johnston, 56, was released from prison Friday, one day after an
appeals court ruled inadmissible his statements to police linking
him to the 1982 mutilation deaths of 18-year-old Annette Cooper
Johnston, who was Johnston's stepdaughter, and her fiance, Todd
Schultz.
   The release shocked residents of this scenic southeastern Ohio
city of 6,000, where the couple's dismembered bodies were found in
October 1982, 10 days after they disappeared.
   Mrs. Schultz said Friday that she was angered by the ruling that
prompted prosecutors to drop the case against Johnston. Prosecutors
said they would reopen the investigation only if new, convincing
evidence is uncovered.
   ``I'm still in shock,'' she said. ``I'm afraid to leave the
house _ not because of him, but because I'm afraid I'll run into
somebody who thinks he's innocent. I just don't think I could take
that.''
   She is convinced Johnston shot the couple on his farm on Oct. 4,
1982, dismembered the bodies, threw their torsos into the Hocking
River and buried other body parts in a nearby cornfield.
   ``I saw him on TV last night and he kept saying that he wants
out so he can find the real murderer,'' she said. ``I guess they
don't allow mirrors in prison.''
   She said Johnston hated her son because he was a rival for Miss
Johnston. Prosecutors claimed at trial that Johnston had sexually
molested his stepdaughter.
   Johnston has repeatedly maintained his innocence. At a news
conference Friday, Johnston said finding the killer was ``the one
goal I have left.'' He had served more than seven years in prison
in the slayings and at one time was on death row.
   His ex-wife, Sarah Johnston, mother of the slain woman, voiced
relief at the news conference that Johnston was free.
   ``It's not going to bring her back. It's not going to ease the
pain of having lost a daughter, a future son-in-law,
grandchildren,'' she said. ``But it's a great day.''
   Johnston's first conviction was thrown out by the Ohio Supreme
Court in 1988, which ruled that a witness whose memory had been
refreshed by hypnosis had been improperly allowed to testify. He
remained in custody without bond pending the second trial.
   But that trial was put on hold last July after Judge William
Gillie ruled that Johnston's rights were violated when police
questioned him for 8{ hours without a lawyer present. Gillie also
ruled that boots taken from Johnston during the interrogation could
not be used as evidence.
   Some residents were reluctant to talk about the case Friday. One
woman who refused to give her name told a reporter to get out of
town. ``Why won't you people leave us alone? Go home. Just leave it
lie,'' she said.
   But Jerry Brown, sitting on a downtown park bench, was quick to
respond.
   ``I don't think the man's guilty,'' he said. ``I'm glad he's
getting out. A lot of people around here think he's innocent, but
they just aren't brave enough to say so.''
   Seated next to Brown, Kenneth Huffine shook his head. ``I don't
know who did it, but I think Dale Johnston knows who did it,'' he
said.
   Shopkeeper Marian Sinsel said she was surprised at Johnston's
release.
   ``We'll probably never know if he's guilty or not, but I do know
that I wouldn't open my home to him,'' she said.
   Mrs. Schultz finds no fault with the authorities, but hopes new
evidence is found that will send Johnston back to jail for good.
   ``I know Todd would tell me, `Just let it go. Forget it, Mom,
I'm happy now. There's nothing more you can do.' Can I live with
that? I don't want to, but I guess I have to.
   ``My daughter still dreams about Todd. She always has the same
dream that she's with some friends by a creek and suddenly the
water starts to rise.
   ``She and her friends try to run away, but she trips over a boy
that has fallen. When she turns the boy over, it's Todd. She asks
him what he's doing there and he tells her, `I'm allowed to come
back every once in a while and tell you I'm OK.'
   ``That's what keeps me going, that he's OK and nothing else bad
will ever happen to him.''

<TEXT>
   More than 13,000 riot police took up
positions around Seoul on Saturday in a massive show of force that
stopped most anti-government protests before they had a chance to
get started.
   However, the nation's largest car plant voted to strike for
higher pay, indicating that labor unrest might continue despite a
government crackdown.
   The government seemed determined to make sure security forces
were not overwhelmed by protesters, as they were Wednesday when
20,000 students and dissidents rampaged through Seoul in the
largest demonstrations since 1987.
   No serious disturbances were reported in Seoul or other cities
Saturday. Thousands of police armed with shields and clubs guarded
government buildings and foreign embassies to prevent possible
attacks by radicals.
   Uniformed and plainclothes police checked the identification of
pedestrians on streets and arrested people who attempted to gather
at parks, railway stations and plazas for anti-government protests.
   Police gave no figures on arrests or injuries.
   Officers surrounded 100 protesters near downtown Pagoda Park and
pushed them into waiting buses.
   About 300 dissidents and students shouting ``Punish (President)
Roh Tae-woo!'' briefly blocked an eight-lane street in Seoul after
an anti-government rally but police drove them into nearby Dongguk
University.
   Police fired tear gas to disperse a handful of people throwing
rocks in front of the school.
   Before the confrontation, 1,200 people gathered at a public park
near the school and heard dissident leaders demanding the ouster of
the Roh government, which they said has lost public confidence.
   ``We have no hope for this government, which favors only the
rich,'' dissident leader Paek Ki-wan shouted.
   The crowd enthusiastically clapped as Paek and other speakers
vehemently criticized the Roh government. The spectators also
shouted support for appeals by the speakers for the disbanding of
the new governing party created by the merger of three political
parties early this year. The speakers said the merger, which gave
Roh a parliamentary majority, would lead to a dictatorship.
   It was not immediately clear why the rally was allowed to take
place.
   Roh also is under mounting public criticism for a series of
economic failures that have caused inflation and pushed up land and
housing prices.
   Labor unrest also has been growing.
   The state-run Korea Broadcasting System began functioning again
Saturday after some of its 5,000 workers reported to work following
a decision by their union to end a walkout on May 18.
   The broadcast workers walked off their jobs April 12, demanding
the resignation of their new government-named president, Suh
Ki-won, who they believe opposes political reforms in South Korea.
   The government refused to accept the demand. After police
arrested leaders of the network's militant union, new leaders
assumed power and decided to fight for Suh's resignation while
working.
   Workers at the Hyundai Motor Co., the nation's largest car
maker, voted Saturday to strike after talks with management over a
pay raise broke down.
   The union said it would decide later when to start the strike.
The car plant South Korea's largest and makes 830,000 vehicles a
year.
   The Hyundai car plant reopened Monday after a weeklong sympathy
strike for workers at a Hyundai shipyard where a walkout was
crushed by a police raid.

   Far right-wing white leaders on
Saturday warned that South Africa is heading for ``a holy war'' and
their uniformed followers mounted their first display of military
training.
   Eugene TerreBlanche, head of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement,
said whites would have to defend themsleves against the African
National Congress, the main black nationalist group. He said ANC
leader Nelson Mandela was trying to impose Communist rule on South
Africa.
   ``We are sure we're heading for a black revolution and we will
meet it,'' TerreBlanche said. ``It will be a holy war.''
   ``We are preparing ourselves to meet the revolution that Mr.
Mandela's killers will start,'' he said.
   TerreBlanche claims his movement, known by its Afrikaans
initials as AWB, is forming military units or ``commandos'' around
South Africa to oppose any black government. ``Officers'' from
units across South Africa would receive training Saturday, he said.
   About 300 AWB members, most dressed in Nazi-style uniforms, put
on a show of military training at a farm outside Ventersdorp. It
was the first time the AWB had displayed its military capabilities
in such a way.
   Men marched in squads to the bark of drill instructors, and
women, in khaki uniforms, practiced with pistols and shotguns at a
firing range. The men also formed riot squads, practicing
dispersing opponents with truncheons.
   Many families attended the meeting, with mothers holding babies.
Young children, some dressed in AWB uniforms, imitated the adults.
The AWB's red, white and black flags, bearing swastika-like
symbols, adorned the area.
   ``If there are not enough soldiers and police to defend us we
will defend ourselves. We will become the policemen and soldiers
and no force on earth can stop us defending ourselves,''
TerreBlanche told his cheering supporters.
   But TerreBlanche declined to say how many members the AWB has or
estimate its military strength.
   The AWB members were heavily armed, but most removed their guns
before journalists arrived.
   The government and ANC have expressed concern about the AWB and
other extremist groups that have been arming themselves. Some
government ministers have demanded action against the groups.
   Asked about this, TerreBlanche said: ``No one can stop me when
I'm preparing to defend myself. The government started it.''
   President F.W. de Klerk legalized the ANC in February to clear
the way for talks on ending white-minority rule and sharing
political power with the 28-million black majority.
   TerreBlanche and other leaders denounced de Klerk as a traitor,
claiming he was selling out the 5 million whites to the ANC. They
demanded an election, claiming white voters would oust de Klerk.
   Jaap Marais, another extremist leader, told the meeting: ``I say
to the government that if you are going to sell out the whites to
the blacks in this unjust way, we are going to fight for what is
rightfully ours,'' he said.
   The AWB is thought to have a few thousand members at most. But
because it is armed, some government officials are concerned it and
similar groups could pose a threat to political stability.
   TerreBlanche said the AWB seeks a separate state for Boers,
whites of mostly Dutch ancestry. He denied he was a racist, saying
blacks should live in their own, separate states.
   He repeatedly asserted that Mandela and the ANC were Communists
seeking to confiscate white property and impose black rule. ``They
are a bunch of Communist murderers,'' he said.
   Afrikaners are about 3 million of the country's whites and are
generally more conservative than South African whites of British
descent.
   Also Saturday, police reported that a black youth and woman were
burned to death, a black policeman was stoned and two other black
youths were shot in township political violence across the country.
   They gave few details about the incidents, which occurred Friday.

   More than 500 would-be lawyers who took
the grueling state bar examination Feb. 28 and March 1 will have to
go through a few more weeks of nail-biting.
   The good news is an error made in grading was caught before
inaccurate grades were released. The bad news is that 527 very
anxious people who were expecting to find out their scores May 18
will have to wait until June 8.
   ``We're not very happy about it, believe me,'' said R. David
Stamm, director of the State Bar Examining Committee.
   Delay in releasing the grades will delay the bar association's
swearing-in ceremonies, usually scheduled about three weeks after
the grades are posted. It also could affect some jobs in cases in
which law firms don't want to wait three more weeks to fill slots
requiring membership in the bar.
   The grading error was made by one of 24 graders who used a
different system in converting points. It resulted in 259
examinations each receiving one extra point, and that had a domino
effect in determining average scores and hence the grading of all
the exams, Stamm said.

<HEAD>East Germans Rule out Prosecution for Ailing Honecker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German authorities have spared former
hard-line Communist leader Erich Honecker from prosecution on
corruption charges because of his rapidly failing health, a top
official said in an interview Saturday.
   ``We had 40 years of injustice in the GDR,'' Interior Minister
Peter-Michael Diestel told the West German newspaper Welt am
Sonntag. ``We don't want to build up democracy with yet another
injustice.''
   Also Saturday, the Hamburg-based newsmagazine Der Spiegel said
the Soviet Union was preparing a peace treaty it wants signed by
Germany and its former World War II enemies, including the Allied
powers.
   Honecker, 77, ruled East Germany with absolute power for 18
years before he was ousted in the peaceful revolution in October.
He since has become a main target of public resentment of the
hard-line Communists, who controlled every facet of life.
   Late last year, the caretaker Communist government that ruled
until elections in March announced it would indict Honecker on
charges of high treason, which carries a life sentence. Authorities
later reduced the planned charges to corruption and abuse of office.
   Honecker was arrested Jan. 29, freed the following day and sent
to live with a Lutheran pastor and his wife in the town of Lobetal.
   He is suffering from kidney cancer and is staying in a Soviet
military hospital in the town of Beelitz.
   ``I simply have to acknowledge that a seriously ill,
77-year-old, physically fragile man cannot be prosecuted,'' Welt am
Sonntag quoted Interior Minister Diestel as saying. ``Such a thing
is not possible in the Federal Republic (West Germany). And we
can't have it either.''
   ``This is for us an unfortunate legal situation, which we will
somehow have to accept,'' he said.
   The East German official also was quoted as saying there is a
good chance that corruption charges against former secret police
chief Erich Mielke also will be dropped. Mielke, now 82, headed the
once-dreaded Stasi.
   Diestel, who also is the country's deputy prime minister, said
he would not consider prosecuting Mielke simply as a means of
``appeasing the people's anger.''
   After the fall of the hard-liners, the self-professed reform
Communists fanned public outrage with non-stop revelations of
alleged corruption by Honecker and his cronies.
   They included allegations that the ousted leaders stashed tens
of millions of dollars in foreign bank accounts and lived
luxuriously.
   However, the leaders elected in March in East Germany's first
free balloting have been less interested in feeding public
resentment about the past than in preparing for unification with
the West.
   Members of the East German government are divided over how
unification should be accomplished, and the West German newspaper
Bild am Sonntag reported that the Social Democrats might withdraw
from the coalition government.
   It quoted the party's executive manager, Stephen Hilsberg, in an
interview that was to appear in Sunday's editions.
   They are dissatisfied with the negotiations with the West and
want more social guarantees and limits on price increases to ease
the transition from a socialist system where food, employment and
housing are heavily subsidized.
   More than 5,000 leftists in the West German city of Frankfurt
staged a noisy march to protest German unification, saying Bonn's
plans would amount to ``annexation'' of the East. Officials
reported several scuffles with police and said at least six
demonstrators were taken into custody.
   A peace treaty between Germany and its former enemies would be a
major step on the path to a united, fully sovereign Germany and is
especially important for the future of Berlin.
   The Allied powers _ France, Britain, the United States and the
Soviet Union _ will have final say on what happens to Berlin, which
after the war was divided into sectors overseen by the victors. A
peace treaty would abolish what in effect is an occupation nearly a
half century after the end of the fighting.
   Citing Soviet sources, Der Spiegel magazine said a peace treaty
would be signed by Germany and anywhere from 12 to 16 of its
one-time enemies.
   The Spiegel report is to appear in editions of the magazine that
go on sale on Monday. It was sent in advance to other news
organizations.

   Foresters say it will be decades before
more than 6,000 acres of charred northern Michigan woodland looks
whole again, after a fire that destroyed half the habitat of an
endangered species of song bird.
   Someone's brush fire ignited the northern woods of Michigan's
Lower Peninsula on Tuesday. The forest was tinder dry after two
years of drought and not yet green despite the early spring.
   A hot afternoon wind whipped the fire into a wall of flames that
advanced so fast, leaping roads, fire breaks and even the Au Sable
River, that the Crawford County sheriff evacuated the town of
Lovells, more than 15 miles away.
   In six hours, the fire was halfway to Lovells.
   During the night, the rain did what every available firefighter
in northern Michigan couldn't do and put out the flames. But by
then the fire had destroyed 86 homes, 130 other buildings and 12
square miles of woodland.
   It also consumed half of the nesting ground left for the world's
last 400 Kirtland's warblers.
   It will be half a century before the pine forests are whole
again, said Bill Mahalak, the Department of Natural Resources' area
forest manager.
   This week, the DNR will set out plans to cut down most of the
fire-killed timber so it doesn't incubate a plague of blight or
bark beetles. Then the state will begin replanting.
   Jack pines are already reseeding themselves. Within hours after
the fire, cones triggered by the heat began dropping their seeds to
the ashen ground.
   It is the only way a jack pine tree germinates. And it is the
only way the tiny, yellow-breasted Kirtland's warbler survives
since it will nest only on the ground beneath young jack pine trees.
   If the birds can survive another decade, this fire will have
opened a vast new nesting range for them.
   But Mahalak was uneasy about such things.
   ``I don't consider this fire in any way a positive thing,'' he
said. ``Generally, there's nothing positive to anything that comes
at such a high cost.''
   The fire will even affect some trout fishermen.
   Flames lapped right to the water's edge for a mile along the Au
Sable River, and Trout Unlimited will put up signs asking canoeists
and fishermen not to tread on the injured ground.
   Some homes survived in chance islands of green.
   Bruce Murray's mobile home still stood and along with it
survived three evergreen bushes, one nylon windsock, one red
rooster and one singed cat.
   The fire took everything else.
   His apple trees were black stubs. His raspberry bushes were
turned to ash. His wife's 100 rabbits were cremated in their cages.
   ``It's all dusted,'' Murray said Friday in disgust, wading
through an ash pile that used to be his barn, kicking cinder chunks
out of his way. ``It makes you so sick, you want to leave.''
   ``This is like a war zone.''
   At the end of Murray's driveway hung a sign: ``Bunnies For
Sale.''
   Beneath it he wrote ``Extra Crispy.''
   ``Well, you got to keep a sense of humor some way,'' he said.

<HEAD>Arens Disappointed Over U.S. Stand U.N. Resolution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The foreign minister Saturday urged the United
States to veto a United Nations resolution being drafted that would
oppose the settlement of Soviet Jews in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   The minister, Moshe Arens, said Israel was disappointed that
U.S. officials appear to be cooperating with Arab nations in
drafting the resolution.
   In another development Saturday, Palestinians and Israelis
joined hands near the closed gates of a university campus in
Bethlehem to protest the closing of Arab universities in the
occupied territories.
   For several weeks, the 15-member U.N. Security Council has been
negotiating the draft resolution, which also endorses the right of
Palestinian exiles to return to their homeland and calls Israel's
settlements in the occupied territories illegal and a threat to
regional peace and security.
   The United States views such settlements as an obstacle to
Middle East peace, but reportedly wants to water down the
resolution.
   About 50,000 Soviet Jews have arrived in Israel so far this
year, and the government expects up to 150,000 by the end of the
year. Israel says it has no policy on settling the immigrants in
the occupied territories, and so far only about 200 have settled
there, according to immigration officials.
   The Arab nations fear that Israel will encourage the immigrants
to settle in the occupied lands to give the government a stronger
hold on the areas.
   Arab sources close to resolution negotiations said Friday that
Arab states are seeking U.S. agreement on a new draft that focuses
only on settlements and sets aside larger political issues.
   Arens said the American stand on the resolution is ``a source of
disappointment for us.'' He said he hopes the United States rejects
the draft opposing the settlement of Soviet Jews in the occupied
territories or vetoes the resolution during the planned U.N.
Security Council vote.
   ``We were surprised and disappointed to see that the American
delegate at the U.N. Security Council had been working together
with none other than the delegate of the Democratic People's
Republic of Yemen, the country which I believe until recently was
on the State Department's list of countries engaged in terrorism,''
Arens said. ``Their delegate had been working together with the
American delegate in putting together the draft,'' he said on
Israel radio.
   In addition to the hand-holding protest in Bethlehem, 100 people
conducted a symbolic class near the campus of Bethlehem University,
listening to lectures by Israeli and Palestinian academics.
   ``We came here to engage in a symbolic act of teaching that
cannot go on in this building and many other educational
institutions in the West Bank,'' said Avi Temkin, a Tel Aviv
University political science lecturer. ``As a Jew, I'm ashamed of
the fact that we are preventing young people from studying.''
   ``We want to tell the Israeli public and the academic community
in particular that time has come to break the silence,'' said
Temkin, who is also a senior official within the leftist Citizens'
Rights Movement.
   Participants in the rally included members of Temkin's group and
other Israeli left-wing organizations as well as Palestinian
teachers and activists.
   Israeli authorities shut all six Palestinian universities for
security reasons shortly after the revolt against Israeli
occupation began in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip 29 months ago.
   The army views these universities as centers of unrest.

   Touched by a childless woman who thought her life
was worthless after she heard a Mother's Day sermon, a minister
will devote this year's sermon to women without children.
   ``My attitudes have changed towards the traditional Mother's Day
sermon that talks about how wonderful it is for every woman to have
children. It's depressing for those that can't,'' said Minister
Gerald Krick, pastor of the First Unitarian Church in suburban
Newton.
   Krick said women who do not bear children often feel like
outsiders, and ``their assumed inadequacy stands out like a missing
leg.''
   It is common for women's parents and friends to expect them to
give birth, said Krick, a clergyman for 30 years.
   ``I think they should also have the right to choose, and yet
tremendous pressure is brought upon women to bear children,'' he
said.
   Krick saw first-hand how women can feel burdened by this
pressure. Several years ago, a woman went to Krick's office after
his Mother's Day service.
   ``She was in tears. She and her husband were very upset about
not having children,'' Krick recounted. ``They were an older couple
and were not able to adopt either.
   ``She said that she often thought about whether her life was
worth living without being able to have children.''
   Krick announced last week that he would deliver a non-Mother's
Day sermon, and received a positive response from his congregation
of more than 450 members.
   ``Many women feel that they would not be good mothers,'' he
said. ``The result is unwanted children and mistreated children
that leads to delinquents, and a worse society.''
   Most members of the Unitarian church are concerned with
environmental issues and see overpopulation as a world threat,
Krick said.
   Krick, 56, is married and has two daughters, ages 7 and 22.
   He said his wife had some misgivings about the non-Mother's Day
service, ``but she began to realize what I was trying to accomplish
... that motherhood is great but it ought to be a choice.''
   Krick said he thinks the recognition and acceptance of
non-Mother's Day may gain popularity.
   ``There's an awful lot of childless women and men who support
them,'' he said.

   A barrage of rockets slammed into the
Afghan capital Saturday, killing at least four people and wounding
11, according to radio reports.
   This week, 11 other people were killed and 31 wounded during
four rocket attacks on the capital of Kabul.
   The official Kabul Radio, monitored in Islamabad, said 15
surface-to-surface rockets hit residential areas of the city of 2
million people.
   It said the rockets were fired by ``Pakistan-backed
extremists,'' the government's usual way of referring to Moslem
guerrillas fighting to overthrow the Soviet-supported government.
   The guerrillas, who call themselves mujahedeen or ``Islamic holy
warriors,'' have tried for 12 years to unseat the Communist
government that seized power in a 1978 coup. More than 1 million
people have been killed.
   The guerrillas, armed by the United States and Saudi Arabia and
based in Pakistan, say they target only military installations but
admit their rockets misfire occasionally and strike civilian
targets.

   Military helicopters rushed food and
water Saturday to India's southern coast, where the worst storm in
a decade left 322 people dead and swamped thousands of villages,
officials and news reports said.
   At least 90,000 farm animals also died when the cyclone roared
in from the Bay of Bengal on Wednesday, packing wind of up to 155
mph. Officials said 6.2 million people in 3,059 villages were
affected by the storm.
   So far, 312 people were killed in Andhra Pradesh state, worst
hit by the cyclone, and 10 died in neighboring Tamil Nadu state.
Most deaths occurred when houses of mud and palm thatches
collapsed. Several people were carried away by flooded rivers and
others died when live electric wires fell on them.
   About 20 navy and air force choppers dropped 15,400 pounds of
food, milk powder, medicine and drinking water into Andhra Pradesh,
the Press Trust of India reported.
   But rescue work was hampered by rain and thousands more people
passed a third day without food and water, officials in the state
capital, Hyderabad, said on condition of anonymity.
   The Ministry of Defense said 50 boats steamed to Machilipatnam,
a small peninsula jutting into the Bay of Bengal, to evacuate
thousands. About 470,000 coastal residents have been taken to 530
relief camps, the government said.
   Motor boats carrying water pumps and 300 medical teams fanned
out into the battered farming communities.
   Agriculture Minister Janardhan Reddy said $300 million in crops
were destroyed, including 434,720 acres of rice paddies. Huge
tracts of mangos and bananas also were lost.
   The news agency said flooding continued Saturday and one
reservoir in coastal Annavaram broke, forcing residents to take
shelter in a nearby temple.
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh, who visited the stricken area,
announced he set aside $52 million for relief operations.
   The storm began Tuesday, when 33-foot-high tidal waves and heavy
rains lashed the coast of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.
   On Wednesday, it roared into the densely populated plains of
Andhra Pradesh, flattening houses, sweeping away cattle and
uprooting crops, trees and electricity poles.
   Village wells filled with sea water. Power outages shut down
other water systems.
   Officials said the storm was stronger than a 1977 cyclone that
left 10,000 people dead. But the death toll was kept relatively low
by an early satellite warning and fast evacuation of 150,000 people
before the storm.

   Bus accidents claim scores of lives every year in Zimbabwe. Last
month, 19 people were killed when their bus collided with an army

   Bus owners say some of their vechiles are unsafe because of the

   The nation's military leaders open
negotiations this week with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on
pared-down spending proposals that by 1997 would cut six divisions
from the Army, slash dozens of warships and defer missile programs,
Pentagon sources said Saturday.
   The spending plans, which were drafted by the civilian and
military chiefs for the Army, Navy and Air Force, were formally
submitted to Cheney's office on May 1.
   ``There are no surprises here,'' said one source, who noted that
the proposals, which cover the years 1992-97, are far from being
finalized. ``It's a submission. The final decisions are up to
Cheney, up to the president.''
   All of the officials who spoke of the plans did so on condition
of anonymity, given that the plans are considered classified. The
Washington Post and The New York Times first disclosed details of
the documents in their Saturday editions.
   The chiefs' suggestions came as Capitol Hill is putting great
pressure on Cheney to clarify the Pentagon's long-range spending
goals in this time of reduced superpower tensions and reduced
chance of a major land war in Europe.
   Lawmakers complain they can't debate President Bush's $303
billion budget submission for fiscal 1991 without this guidance.
Some want to slash $15 billion to $20 billion from the single-year
spending plan, while Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., has set his limit at $298 billion, a number that makes
sharply reduced Pentagon spending a near certainty.
   Following a formal presentation on strategy Monday by Gen. Colin
Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, each of the
services will present their arguments about their recommendations
to Cheney over a period of several days, another source said.
   The secretary must make the final decisions about the proposals
sometime this summer as part of the Pentagon's complex budget
process. Bush will submit his 1992 budget to Congress next January.
   Cheney has ordered the service chiefs to cut spending by 2
percent below the rate of inflation in each year from 1992 to 1997,
and in that light, the plans are supposed to be the first thorough
review of the military's long-term needs.
   ``They are now in the secretary's hands, and now the real debate
begins,'' said one Pentagon source.
   Many of the proposals have been reported in recent weeks as the
service chiefs debated their options. The Pentagon sources said the
major points include:
   _Reducing active duty Army forces by six divisions, which would
cut the active duty force to 580,000 from 764,000.
   _Paring the Army's reserve force from the current 776,000 to
645,000.
   _Slashing the Navy's ship strength from 542 to 488.
   _Cutting carrier battle groups from 14 to 12, while seeking a
new aircraft carrier in 1996.
   _Stopping Trident submarine production with the 18th ship, but
with an option to build more in the future.
   Vice Adm. Daniel L. Cooper, the service's top submarine officer,
told Congress in March the Navy initially wanted 24 submarines, to
be built one a year at a cost of about $1.2 billion each. The Navy
also has considered stretching out production to boat every other
year, which would result in 21 ships built.
   _Paring 50,000 active-duty Navy slots and around 40,000 Air
Force active duty personnel.
   _Slashing nearly in half the Air Force's B-2 Stealth bomber
program from 132 to 75.
   _Putting off deployment of the MX rail garrison and the
development of the Midgetman single-warhead missile.
   _Retiring the 200 Minuteman II intercontinental ballistic
missiles.
   Even though the chiefs have been forced to suggest the cuts,
that doesn't mean they are happy with them or want to see them
finalized, several sources said.
   Despite the suggestion that the Navy's carrier fleet could be
reduced, Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett III still intends to argue
for 14 carrier battle groups, one source said.
   ``Cooper wants at least 21 (Trident) submarines. Garrett wants
14 carriers,'' the source said.
   The official said the Navy wants an option to readjust its
program so that it could switch funds around and ``buy back'' ships
in the future if world events sour, the source said.

   Pope John Paul II, sure of his direction,
strong in his faith, has thrust the church into moral and political
controversy in countries as diverse as the United States and
Nicaragua.
   He could do no different on his eight-day tour of Mexico, Roman
Catholicism's largest Spanish-speaking nation.
   For starters, the visit outlined in flashing neon one of
Mexico's most delicious contradictions _ a country 90 percent
Catholic, a constitution that forbids the church to own property,
educate children or peep about politics.
   The pope violated the constitution just by appearing in public
in clerical garb, not to mention saying Mass for 500,000 people
dressed in a golden chasuble on national television.
   The church was quick to say the vast crowds served as a virtual
plebiscite on the binding element, the notorious article 130.
   ``Only Albania has a constitution like that,'' said Javier
Navarro, in charge of the Vatican office for Latin America and
Spain.
   But the dance between church and state in Mexico is more
complicated than the lambada. The church bet on conservatives in
the Mexican Revolution of 1910; when liberals won, they took
revenge on their reactionary foe.
   Although its public role was circumscribed, the church retained
much of its strength. The motto of the papal visit is: ``Mexico _
Always Faithful.''
   Breaches of the constitution have been winked at for decades.
Politicians send their children to Catholic-run schools, even
universities, because they are better than public schools.
   ``The pope's visit proves that the problem with article 130 of
the constitution is not how to change it, but how impossible it is
to enforce,'' columnist Gaston Garcia Cantu wrote in Excelsior, an
influential newspaper.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has been winking hard. He
took office on Dec. 1, 1988, with the weakest mandate an
Institutional Revolutionary Party president ever had. His party was
accused of fraud. There was violence in the streets on Inauguration
Day.
   But Salinas surprised his opponents by locating a new
constituency. He invited Roman Catholic prelates to his
inauguration and hinted that the relationship between church and
state should be brought in line with reality.
   He sent a personal envoy to the Vatican, establishing diplomatic
relations of a kind for the first time since 1926. Salinas greeted
John Paul when he arrived and had the pope to morning coffee. The
president's office provided security and press arrangements for the
visit, including an extra plane.
   The church, sniffing the carrot of increased recognition, has
been grateful. ``I pray every day for President Salinas,'' said
Monsignor Genaro Alamilla, spokesman for the Mexican church.
   Salinas' opponents know it doesn't pay to attack the pope, and
the government has ruled out real constitutional change. So they
pick around the edges: the pope is talking politics, they say. The
government of a poor nation is spending too much on showtime for
the pope.
   ``We welcome this distinguished visitor, the spiritual guide to
millions of Mexicans,'' said Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, runner-up to
Salinas in 1988. ``But the government made it into politics.''
   But if the pope allowed himself to be used politically, he got
plenty back. Again and again he addressed controversial issues,
always pleading the church's cause.
   He demanded the freedom to provide education to the faithful _ a
role that would expand greatly if it were free of restrictions.
   He attacked contraception in a country with a rising population
of 85 million that suffers all the Third World problems of poverty
and malnutrition and where family planning is government policy.
   He attacked materialism and greed before Mexico's richest
businessmen, but in Monterrey found himself giving a homily flanked
by enormous Carta Blanca beer signs.
   He linked capitalist culture with contraception and abortion,
saying material lust makes people want to limit their families.
   He visited the Indian communities of southeastern Mexico in an
effort to fend off Protestant evangelicals who are learning the
native languages and converting the poor, the homeless and those
who lost their native culture to encroaching ``progress.''
   ``I think his visit could help revitalize the faith here,'' said
Benjamin Cruz, a 51-year-old psychiatrist among a throng of 200,000
at Villahermosa. ``Catholics here are disoriented. It's sad to
see.''
   It was almost forgotten amid the political wavelets, but to most
in the crowd, the pope's role was to focus shared faith. Hundreds
of thousands gathered to sing, to listen, to catch a glimpse.
   When he leaped off an isolated podium and charged through a
fence to mix with murderers and drug traffickers in a prison yard,
a prison chorus broke into Beethoven's ``Ode to Joy.''
   Municipal officials engaged in a game of one-upmanship over who
gave the best reception. Some Mexico City authorities claimed a
questionable 8 million to 10 million people lined the nine-mile
parade to the Basilica of Guadalupe; there were more like 250,000.
   In Aguascalientes, the city fathers were told the pope would
stop at the airport but wouldn't come into town. So they built
giant replicas of their finest buildings on the tarmac. They
claimed a crowd of 700,000; more mathematical minds calculated
50,000, tops.
   But whatever the crowd, the pope gave something back. In a
thousand ways, John Paul provided an experience people will recount
for years.
   In Tuxtla Gutierrez, he sparkled with jokes about his trouble
pronouncing Indian languages.
   In Durango, squads of bicyclists chased a waving, bemused figure
in the popemobile for miles.
   In Mexico City, 1,500 people outside his bedroom fell suddenly
silent when he told them he loved their singing but wanted to sleep.
   ``For us it is the ultimate to come here,'' said Aurora Hinojosa
Casillas, who rode 225 miles by bus from Ciudad Juarez to
Chihuahua. ``Since I was born, I've been a Catholic and it's
important. He is closer to God.''

   MOVE still stands for fear on Philadelphia's
Osage Avenue, a street of row houses sprayed with bullets five
years ago and then destroyed by fire as police tried to rid the
neighborhood of the radical group.
   The city has rebuilt the 61 homes that burned down by a fire
that started when police dropped a bomb on a house occupied by
heavily armed MOVE members on May 13, 1985. An adult and a child
escaped the house. Eleven others, including five children and
founder John Africa, died.
   But residents are afraid MOVE will resurface.
   Police Detective Edward Tenuto said Saturday that police don't
know how many MOVE members there are in the city. Fifteen are in
jail _ one is the adult survivor of the bombing and the rest were
convicted on unrelated charges.
   Along with fear, the residents are puzzled that no city or
police officials were charged in the incident. Sen. Arlen Specter
tried unsuccessfully last week to get a federal grand jury to
reopen the case before the statute of limitations on civil rights
violations expired at midnight Saturday.
   A memorial service was held Friday night for the victims, and
panel discussions and workshops on public policy and human
relations were running all day Saturday.
   Gerald Renfrow, who lives across the street from where the MOVE
house once stood, serves as spokesman for his neighbors on Osage
Avenue who are afraid to talk to reporters.
   ``I'm the block captain here. I'll answer your questions,'' said
Renfrow.
   Although some considered leaving this working-class neighborhood
after the fire destroyed their homes, the majority of the estimated
270 displaced residents eventually moved into the $130,000-plus
homes rebuilt by the city.
   But nobody has moved into the new home built where the MOVE
house once stood. It is empty, guarded by police around the clock,
steel bars protecting its windows and doors.
   Louise James, a MOVE sympathizer who owned the original house,
has fought the city for the new dwelling.
   The city gave her $2,280 in 1987, saying that was what the
property was worth when it was condemned. In 1988 she sued the
city, claiming title to the new house and $375,000 in damages, but
a federal judge dismissed it, saying the statute of limitations for
such a suit had expired.
   On several occasions, Ms. James, the sister of MOVE founder John
Africa, and sympathizers have paraded through the neighborhood,
decrying the city's action against the group.
   ``We are at the mercy of Louise James and the city,'' Renfrow
said. ``We urge the city to settle with her.''
   Tourists and reporters are also upsetting, Renfrow said. ``They
come on buses, limousines, taxis. Even helicopters fly low over
this area. We get a lot of crackpots shouting at us.''
   The 61 new red brick row houses clash with the older, uniform
colonial-revival row houses. They, too, have brought troubles.
   The new houses are smaller inside, have less yard space and no
enclosed porches. The first winter, 37 leaking roofs had to be
repaired. Renfrow also cited problems with wood siding splitting
and nails buckling.
   Residents had to fight off an effort by the city to triple the
real estate taxes from about $400 to $1,200.
   ``We hear all the time from people: `You got a new house. You
ought to be happy and satisfied. ... You should just shut up,'''
Renfrow said. ``The general public doesn't know what we're going
through.''
   What outsiders also fail to understand, Renfrow said, is that
Osage residents' problems didn't start with the fire. They have
been under duress since before 1982, when they first met with city
officials to complain about the garbage and excrement surrounding
the MOVE house and about the nightly barrage of insults and even
death threats the MOVE members broadcast through bullhorns.
   MOVE, whose initials don't stand for anything, began in the '70s
protesting peacefully against abuse of animals, the elderly and the
environment, its surviving members say. But followers became more
militant and began having scrapes with the law, and in 1978 a
police officer was slain while attempting to evict MOVE from a
house.
   In the Osage Avenue confrontation, the city tried negotiation
before force.
   May 13 began with a demand from police to evacuate the MOVE
house. A barrage of bullets followed. Firefighters tried
unsuccessfully to clear a fortified bunker on the roof with water
canons. The bitterly disputed decision was made to drop a bomb.
   ``We asked that they be evicted. We did not ask for them to be
killed,'' said Renfrow.
   A county grand jury was convened and brought no charges against
Mayor W. Wilson Goode, but found him ``grossly negligent'' in
handling the situation.
   The mayor has said less each year about the MOVE disaster and
this year declined to be interviewed by The Associated Press.
   ``I'm still very much troubled by what happened,'' Goode told
The Philadelphia Inquirer in an interview in Sunday's editions. ``I
continue to grieve for those who lost their lives and those who
lost their homes.''

   Rival Christian forces traded tank and
artillery fire in east Beirut and the surrounding countryside
Saturday, killing 10 people and wounding 30, police said.
   Several rounds of artillery strayed from the embattled region
and crashed in the Shiite Moslem neighborhood of Shiyah in Beirut's
southern slums, killing two people and wounding 10, including two
children, police said.
   Saturday's casualties raised the overall toll to 940 killed and
2,606 wounded in the battle for mastery of the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave, which erupted Jan. 30.
   Four cease-fire appeals by a three-man mediation committee went
unheeded as the combatants blasted residential areas and mountain
resorts.
   Fires blazed out of control in apartment buildings in east
Beirut's neighborhoods of Ashrafiyeh and Baabda, in villages in the
highlands of Kesrouan and pinewoods of the Metn mountains,
northeast of the capital.
   Radio stations broadcast urgent appeals for civil defense
workers to put out the fires and evacuate the wounded to hospitals.
But the intensity of the shelling hampered rescue efforts.
   The hostilities kept all roads blocked for a fifth straight day
between the Gen. Michel Aoun-controlled Metn province and the rest
of the enclave, held by Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said troops loyal to Aoun fired a dozen howitzer
shells at the ports of Beirut, Jounieh and Byblos.
   Geagea's Lebanese Forces controls the three harbors and most of
the enclave's 28-mile coast.
   Aoun on Wednesday declared the coast north of Beirut off limits
to international shipping in an attempt to clamp a sea blockade on
Geagea's 6,000-strong militia.
   Geagea's speedboats blockaded a three-mile beachstip at Dbaye,
between Beirut and Jounieh, where Aoun's 19,000 landlocked troops
set up a makeshift harbor to try to bring in spare parts and
ammunition.
   Both sides have been reported running low on ammunition.
   The confrontation has wreaked heavier destruction on the
Christian heartland than the 15-year-old civil war with the Moslems.
   The Chamber of Commerce and Industry has estimated material
damage to the enclave at over $1 billion.
   Police say more than 400,000 of the enclave's 1 million
population have sought shelter in Moslem areas or abroad.

   Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on
Saturday forged a united front they hope will crack Moscow's
resistance to their attempts to break away from the Soviet Union.
   At a Baltic summit, the presidents of the three republics
revived a 1934 political alliance and said they intend to hold
negotiations on independence with the Kremlin. They also asked
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush to put
their cause on the agenda of the superpower meeting in Washington
later this month.
   The appeal by all three republics for independence negotiations
represented a new tactic to bring the Kremlin to the bargaining
table. Soviet leaders have refused separate talks.
   Presidents Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania, Arnold Ruutel of
Estonia and Anatoly Gorbunov of Latvia also asked for their
republics to have full membership in the United Nations and to join
the Helsinki peace process.
   ``Now we are creating a united front against the Kremlin's
economic and military pressure, which threatens not only Lithuania
but all three Baltic countries,'' said Landsbergis, whose republic
has suffered under an embargo of oil, natural gas and other
resources for its pro-independence laws.
   The presidents signed four documents _ one on political
cooperation, a letter to Gorbachev, a letter to Bush and a joint
statement.
   Speaking at a news conference in the Estonian Supreme Soviet
chambers after the summit, Landsbergis cited a Lithuanian proverb
that one drop of water cannot break a stone but many drops can.
   ``This joint drop of water is really important,'' he said.
   Ruutel disclosed that he received a telegram Saturday from
Gorbachev that said the Federation Council, a group of advisers to
the Soviet leader, proposed to give all the Soviet republics
greater autonomy.
   Ruutel said he has had similar offers from Gorbachev before, and
this ``does not meet the aspiration of the Estonian nation.''
   Gorbunov said Gorbachev still has not responded to Latvia's
declaration of independence, adopted May 4.
   In the letter to Gorbachev, the presidents asked him to restore
their independence.
   ``Realization of universally recognized norms of international
rights, including in relation to the three Baltic governments,
former full members of the League of Nations, would create good
preconditions for strengthening peace, disarmament and development
of cooperation in all of Europe,'' a draft version of the document
says.
   Ruutel told reporters the presidents would like to meet jointly
with Gorbachev, but that each republic has its own problems and
could also negotiate separately with Moscow. ``Such an approach
could break the deadlock on the Baltic issue,'' Ruutel said.
   Before the 4{-hour summit meeting, Ruutel stressed the need for
cooperation among the Baltic republics, which together have a
population of only 8 million people.
   ``We must give a hand to one another, these little nations of
Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, because in history during a
difficult period we always helped one another,'' Ruutel told
reporters gathered in Toompea Palace, an 18th century
pink-and-white building on a hill overlooking old Tallinn,
Estonia's seaside capital.
   Gorbachev will travel to the Washington at the end of this month
for a summit with Bush. The Baltic republics' drive for
independence is expected to be a topic there, as well at a meeting
between U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Moscow this week.
   The Baltic presidents signed a document titled ``The Declaration
on Unity and Cooperation of the Lithuanian Republic, Latvian
Republic, and Estonian Republic,'' which re-establishes the Council
of Baltic States. The council's purpose will be to work toward
``the full restoration of governmental independence of the three
republics.''
   The declaration also said the presidents and other top officials
of the republics will meet regularly as part of the council, and
will make non-binding recommendations on the governments.
   The document was printed in five languages: Estonian, Latvian,
Lithuanian, Russian and English.
   The leaders of the republics want to have seats in the United
Nations and be included in the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe that produced the Helsinki Accords in 1975.
They also want to be invited to a follow-up Helsinki meeting
proposed for Paris this year.
   Baltic state representatives set up the Council of Baltic States
in September 1934 in Geneva under an agreement of ``unity and
cooperation.'' A 1971 Soviet history book said the alliance became
``a hotbed of anti-Soviet agitation.''
   The republics were part of the Russian Empire, but gained their
independence amid the turmoil of World War I and the Bolshevik
Revolution. They were absorbed by Josef Stalin in 1940 as
confrontation between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany loomed at
the start of World War II.
   Lithuania declared outright on March 11 that it was
re-establishing that independence, and Latvia and Estonia followed
with declarations that they would resume independence after
unspecified transition periods.
   Gorbachev has demanded the republics observe Soviet law,
however, and one requires a referendum and a waiting period of up
to five years before secession.
   Landsbergis was quoted Saturday as saying that up to 300,000
people soon will be unemployed if Moscow continues its economic
blockade against the republic of 3.8 million people.

   Teen-agers who admitted punching marchers in
last week's March of Dimes fund-raising ``walkathon'' say they were
holding a contest to see who could land the best punch on a
participant, police said.
   The winner was supposedly to have received a cardboard replica
of a prizefighter's championship belt, police said Friday.
   Members of the group of seven to 10 teen-agers have been linked
to attacks on at least 11 walkers at the May 6 charity event, the
police said.
   The only person charged so far is an 18-year-old man accused of
knocking out the front teeth of a 15-year-old marcher. Police said
at least two teen-agers admitted participating in the attacks and
implicated others in the gang of 16- to 19-year-olds.
   ``The problem is trying to match the victims with the
assailants,'' said police Sgt. Richard W. Barger. ``Originally, we
only had three assaults reported to us. Now we have 11 and possibly
several more. Since they struck and ran, it is difficult to
determine who did what.''
   The assaults apparently began about 1 p.m. and continued for
much of the afternoon. Police questioned some suspects and were
told that the gang had staged a ``contest'' to see who could hit a
walker the hardest.
   Barger said the group claimed to have been holding the contest
during the March of Dimes walkathon for two or three years and that
the attacks came to the attention of the police this time only
because of the increase in severity and frequency.
   Omar Sharrif Burrell, who was arrested Thursday on an assault
charge, was being held Saturday in lieu of $1,000 bail.
   The 20th annual walkathon raised more than $1.1 million in
pledges. Organizers said they plan to alter the 22-mile route next
year to avoid the northeast Baltimore neighborhood where the
attacks occurred.

   President Bush issued a bantering
challenge Saturday to the White House press corps to follow his
fitness example and shape up.
   ``You lazy guys get out there and run,'' Bush said to the pool
of photographers and reporters that recorded his early-morning jog
at a local stadium track. ``Arnold Schwarzenegger and I would like
this message to go out,''' he added in reference to the
body-builder-turned-actor who heads the president's fitness
commission. ``A fit America is a strong America.''
   Using his nickname for White House photographers, ``photo
dogs,'' he continued in a jocular tone, ``A fit America should
include photo dogs as well as print reporters who slovenly sit back
in the stands while some of us are running.''
   Some reporters were not amused by Bush's remarks. They resented
being called slovenly, some because their fitness routine includes
other sports such as swimming.
   One radio reporter complained that the president does not
realize the endurance required to follow Bush's frenetic schedule
and long hours, lugging heavy equipment all the while.
   After rousing the pool of journalists to assemble on 25 minutes'
notice for the early-morning run, Bush's staff issued an invitation
to any who wanted to return to their hotel rooms, change into
running clothes and join the president on his jog.
   One took him up on the offer.
   The president's affinity for physical exercise is well
documented. When on vacation he likes to squeeze in as much tennis,
golf, running, fishing and boating as he can.
   He said he hoped to play some tennis and golf Sunday back home
in Washington.
   Bush delivered a commencement speech at the University of South
Carolina on Saturday.

   Leila Hoss, the wife of Prime Minister
Salim Hoss and a social worker who cared for Lebanon's orphans and
elderly, died at American University Hospital on Saturday. She was
61.
   The premier's office said Mrs. Hoss was admitted to the hospital
on Thursday. Sources close to family, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said she had been suffering from lung cancer and
diabetes.
   Mrs. Hoss was a highly respected social worker. She supervized
an orphanage and a home for the aged in Moslem west Beirut. She
also was on the board of several schools that cared for needy
children.
   While many other politicians' wives fled Lebanon's vicious
15-year-old civil war, Mrs. Hoss never left the country, even
though her husband narrowly escaped death in three bombings between
1984 and 1989.
   Mrs. Hoss was born in Deir el-Kamar, a village in the mostly
Druse Moslem Chouf mountains of southeast of Beirut, and was raised
as a Greek Catholic. She converted to Islam to marry Hoss, a Sunni
Moslem, in 1957.
   The couple had one daughter, Wadad, 30, who was born in the
United States.
   Funeral services will be held Sunday at the Imam Ouzai mosque,
in south Beirut, according to the premier's office.

   East German authorities said Saturday
they will not prosecute former Communist leader Erich Honecker on
corruption charges. Here is a brief look at what has happened to
the hard-liners in formerly orthodox Communist East European
countries:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EAST GERMANY:
   Honecker, 77, was ousted Oct. 18 in East Germany's peaceful
revolution, after ruling his country with an iron fist for 18
years. He was briefly placed under house arrest, accused of
corruption and misuse of office. Prosecutors have declined to
prosecute, noting his kidney cancer and failing health.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ROMANIA:
   President and Communist Party leader Nicolae Ceausescu, 71,
whose 24-year rule was marked by repression unparalleled in the
Soviet bloc, was toppled by a popular uprising Dec. 22. He and his
wife, Elena, were tried in secret and convicted of causing the
deaths of thousands while in power. They were executed on Dec. 25
by firing squad.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BULGARIA:
   Todor Zhivkov, 78, was ousted as president and Communist Party
leader in November after 35 years of rule. The party then began to
profess democratic ideals and accused Zhivkov of a range of
transgressions. Authorities say they will complete their
investigation by Friday. Meanwhile, he is in detention and already
has been charged with misappropriating state property, inciting
ethnic hostility and grave abuse of power.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CZECHOSLOVAKIA:
   Milos Jakes, closely linked to the hard-line policies pursued by
the Communist Party since the ``Prague Spring'' reforms were
crushed in 1968, was ousted as party leader Nov. 24 during the
peaceful revolution that ended Marxist rule. Gustav Husak resigned
as president on Dec. 15. Both are said to be living on generous
pensions.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HUNGARY:
   Janos Kadar, who took power when Soviet tanks crushed the 1956
anti-Stalinist revolution, ruled until May 1988, when Hungary began
democratic reforms and he was replaced as chief of the Communist
Party. He later was stripped of the post of honorary party
chairman. Kadar, 77, died on July 6, 1989, just hours before the
formal rehabilitation of revolutionary Premier Imre Nagy, executed
in 1958 under his leadership.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   POLAND:
   Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who declared martial law in December
1981 to crush Solidarity, maintained his position after the
Communists agreed last summer to share power with the independent
labor union. The National Assembly elected him president July 19,
and he now works closely with the Solidarity-led government. He
also remains armed forces chief. His term runs until 1995, but
there are consitutional reforms under way that could lead to
elections for the president. Jaruzelski is unlikely to stand for
president.

   Singer Patti Page, whose 1950
recording of ``Tennesseee Waltz'' is one of the biggest-selling
records of all time, did the wedding waltz Saturday, marrying the
widower of her late best friend.
   Miss Page, 62, and Jerry J. Filiciotto, a 60-year-old retired
aerospace engineer, were married in a formal ceremony at Solana
Beach Presbyterian Church, said the singer's publicist, Alan
Eichler. Some 200 friends and family members were in attendance.
   The marriage was the third for Miss Page, who's been single for
20 years, and the second for Filiciotto.
   Eichler said Filiciotto's late wife, Katie, and Miss Page had
been best friends for years.
   ``She died two years ago and that's when Patti and Jerry started
going to social things together and then they started dating,''
Eichler said. ``Their romance just blossomed.''
   Miss Page's records have sold more than 100 million copies,
including 8 million copies of ``Tennessee Waltz.'' Her other hits
include ``Doggie In The Window,'' ``Old Cape Cod,'' ``I Went To
Your Wedding,'' ``Allegheny Moon,'' ``Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte''
and ``Gentle On My Mind.''

   For 43 high school students, Brenda Lee
didn't make much of an impression _ until they learned that Madonna
is one of her fans.
   The veteran singer told students Friday that she recorded two
songs for the soundtrack of the upcoming ``Dick Tracy'' movie.
   ``Madonna asked specifically that I sing the songs _ which are
brand-new numbers,'' Ms. Lee told the students. ``I had no idea she
was a fan of my singing, but I'm delighted she is.''
   Ms. Lee is appearing at the Opryland USA theme park for her
third straight year. A hit country and pop singer since she was in
her teens, she is known for such songs as ``I'm Sorry,'' ``Fool No.
1'' and ``Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree.''

   The Portland-based band Dan Reed Network
has been chosen to open this summer's European shows for the
Rolling Stones.
   The tour begins July 13 and 14 in London and ends Aug. 9 in
Copenhagen, Denmark. All of the shows are slated for stadiums with
capacities of 40,000 to 80,000 people.
   ``There is no limitation to what you can do in rock 'n' roll,''
bandleader Dan Reed said this week. ``It's very much a surreal
feeling. I don't think it will hit me until I hit the stage.''
   Reed said the legendary Stones' singer, Mick Jagger, personally
picked the Portland band for the tour.
   The Dan Reed Network is slated to go into the studio in June to
record its third album for PolyGram Records. Reed plans to produce
the album himself.
   Besides London and Copenhagen, the tour will stop in Dublin,
Ireland; Manchester, England; Rome; Turin, Italy; Vienna, Austria;
Gothenberg, Sweden; and Oslo, Norway.

   Former University of Arkansas
basketball star Sidney Moncrief reveals in his new book that he was
occasionally offered money by an alumnus or fan during his years as
a Razorback in the 1970s.
   But the former college All-American and NBA all-star with the
Milwaukee Bucks said he was not implying that the Arkansas athletic
program is tainted.
   ``Arkansas runs a straight program,'' he said in an interview.
   ``I can't say that during my time at Arkansas, I wasn't offered
anything extra,'' Moncrief wrote. The book, ``Moncrief: My Journey
to the NBA,'' was written with Myra McLarey. He retired from the
NBA last year.
   ``I can't say that occasionally an alumnus or overzealous fan
didn't walk up to me after a game and put a hundred-dollar bill in
my hand when he shook it,'' he wrote.
   He does not say whether he took the money.
   ``All I'll say is that the money was offered to me. I won't
confirm whether I took it or didn't take it,'' he said in an
interview last week with the Arkansas Democrat newspaper. ``I'll
let the people read the book and draw their own conclusions. They
can interpret what I wrote any way they would like to.''
   However, he did say that in no way was he trying to imply that
there were problems in the UA athletic program.
   ``All I was trying to convey was that it's difficult for a coach
and athletic department to control what goes on all the time,''
Moncrief said. He was interviewed in Dallas, where he now lives.

   Kerry and Kyle Beaver are identical
twins, but this is getting ridiculous.
   They earned identical grade point averages _ 3.96 out of a
possible 4.0 _ at Penn State. In fact, their only B came in the
same English class.
   Because of their top grades, the 22-year-old students from
Bloomsburg won the right to lead their fellow industrial
engineering graduates as student marshals at commencement
ceremonies Saturday.
   The similarities between them are nothing new to family, friends
and teachers. Some pals call both of them ``Beav'' to avoid getting
them mixed up.
   There were early attempts to channel the twins along separate
paths so they could develop their own interests, said their mother,
Jackie Starr.
   ``We tried, in a way. They even recommended that in elementary
school, but they just came together whatever we did,'' she said.
``They'd end up with the same grades on the test or the same
answers wrong.''
   As Penn State freshmen, they were ordered to sit apart after an
economics teacher suspected them of cheating when they both missed
the same question on the first test, winding up with identical
scores of 96. They then both got 100s on the next two tests, they
said.
   The two say their close relationship helps them academically
because engineering classes require group projects and they work
well together.
   ``Studying together helps a lot because if one of us can't
figure it out, the other can,'' Kyle said.
   The only class at Penn State they didn't take together was
speech, because each gets butterflies when the other gets up to
give a speech.
   Despite their similarities, they also have differences. Kyle is
right-handed, Kerry is left-handed. Kyle likes vanilla, Kerry likes
chocolate. Kyle describes himself as lazier than Kerry. He needs
his brother for competition to keep his grades high, he said.

   More than 37,000 people downed
flapjacks Saturday morning as this western Massachusetts city tried
to retain the crown as the world's big breakfast champion.
   The pancake bonanza was part of Springfield's annual duel with
Battle Creek, Mich., over which community can serve up the largest
breakfast.
   Tables filled several blocks of Main Street, and people waited
in lines up to a hundred yards long. For $1.50, adults got a
pancake breakfast and a chance to be part of gastronomic history;
the price was 50 cents for children.
   The event began around 8 a.m., and by the time it ended around
noon, 37,381 people were each served a short stack of two pancakes.
That exceeded the organizers' goal of 35,000 pancake breakfasts.
   Cereal capital Battle Creek, the rival in the annual battle for
``World's Biggest Breakfast,'' will answer the challenge June 9.
The town of 70,000 is home to the Kellogg Co., and also has Post
and Ralston Purina Co. plants.
   Battle Creek held the first free cereal breakfast in 1956 to
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of Kellogg. The
event was held four more times between 1958 and 1962. Then the
tradition was resumed in 1976, which prompted an unsuccessful
challenge from Springfield. The two cities have been battling
annually since then.
   The cities first competed for ``World's Longest Breakfast
Table,'' but after that became logistically difficult, the race
switched to feeding the most people.
   Battle Creek won in 1987 and 1988. But in 1989, Springfield won
with 33,869 breakfasts served. Battle Creek officials, who blamed a
cold, windy day, served only 32,856 people. A later challenge by
Springfield, Ore., also failed to topple Springfield, Mass.

<HEAD>Thousands Take U.S. English Test, Hoping To Study Abroad</HEAD>

   Thousands of Chinese nationwide bent their heads
over a 30-page examination booklet Saturday for a test many hoped
would be the first step toward going abroad to study.
   About 15,000 people took the test opened at 47 test centers from
coastal Shanghai to Kunming in western China, from northern Harbin
to southern Canton.
   The Test of English as a Foreign Language, is required of
foreign students applying to U.S. Universities. Some schools in
Canada and Europe also ask for the test scores to measure a foreign
student's proficiency in English.
   Students say that since last year's military crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement most are studying English in the hopes of
going overseas.
   But apparently, not all are confident enough to take the test
yet. Chinese officials say the number of test-takers has not
increased noticeably.
   About 400 students took the exam Saturday at the Beijing Foreign
Languages Institute.
   ``I'm so tested-out, I'm dizzy,'' said one 20-year-old man as he
left the exam room.
   The 2\-hour exam tests writing ability, reading and listening
comprehension and grammar. Out of a possible 800 points, most
American universities want a 575-point minimum for admission and a
higher score for a scholarship.
   The exam was first administered in China in 1981, to just 600
people at three test sites. It now is given four times a year. Last
year about 40,000 Chinese took the test.
   Students pay the equivalent of a month's salary to take the exam.
   And of those who can pay, not everyone can take the exam. Last
year, China began requiring a letter of approval from each person's
work unit or univeristy Communist Party secretary before
registering for the test.
   Students at some test centers have complained of rampant
cheating, ignored by proctors who sympathize with the students'
desire to leave China and want to help them out.
   But both the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J.,
which administers the exam, and the China International
Examinations Coordination Bureau, which supervises the test in
China, say cheating is not a problem.
   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing says last year it granted 6,301
study visas.
   China has said it will send 3,000 students abroad in 1990 but
has placed new restrictions on studying at foreign universities.
They include requiring students without scholarships to work five
years before going overseas.
   The measures were apparently prompted by fears students would
not return, especially after the June 1989 military crackdown on
student protesters in which hundreds, perhaps thousands, died.
   Authorities are clearly concerned about students being exposed
abroad to ideas and lifestyles that might make them rebellious or
inclined not to return.
   In the past 12 years, China has sent between 60,000 and 80,000
students to foreign countries. But nearly half have failed to
return. More than 20,000 Chinese students have gone overseas on
their own, and many stayed abroad.

<TEXT>
   About 3,000 people Saturday protested
the desecration of a Jewish cemetery and mutilation of a corpse
while police questioned four skinheads in connection with the crime.
   The protesters forcefully expelled a Jewish member of the
far-right National Front party from the demonstration.
   ``I am French before I am Jewish,'' declared Fernand Teboul, a
city council member from nearby Ile de Sourges, as he was led away.
``I regret there are not more Jews in the National Front.''
   Thirty-four graves were found vandalized at the cemetery on
Thursday. The body of a recently buried 81-year-old man was dug up
and impaled on an umbrella.
   Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the Front, has been accused by some
politicians of implicit responsibility for the crime by creating an
atmosphere of racial hatred against Jews and Arabs. Le Pen has
denounced the desecration.
   Le Pen favors expelling the 3.4 million Moslems living in France
and once called the Nazi Holocaust ``a detail'' of history.
   ``Stop this racist barbarism,'' Pierre Danquigny, a regional
anti-racism leader, said at the protest. ``We must stop playing the
game of democracy with those who flout it.''
   Some protesters wore yellow Stars of David to evoke badges the
Nazis forced Jews to wear during World War II.
   Police arrested the four skinheads at dawn in nearby Avignon. By
the end of the day all had been released without being charged. A
fifth youth was questioned and released Friday.
   One police officer said on condition of anonymity it was
unlikely the youths were responsible for the desecration and
speculated the vandals were members of far-right groups from nearby
cities.
   City council members in Carpentras announced a 15-minute ``city
death'' on Sunday during which shop owners will lower their
shutters and drivers will stop their vehicles, said Mayor
Jean-Claude Andrieu.
   Interior Minister Pierre Joxe and other prominent politicians
plan to attend the event. President Francois Mitterrand said he
would send a representative.
   Jews have lived in Carpentras for about 2,000 years. On
Saturday, the approximately 80 Jewish families now living there
celebrated the Sabbath behind closed doors.
   The Regional Council of Auvergne, presided over by former
president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, donated $17,000 to Carpentras
to repair the graves.
   Police have imposed a news blackout on their investigation, and
little was known about the detained youths. Skinheads sympathize
with neo-Nazi groups and generally have shaved heads or
closed-croped hair and wear bomber jackets and steel-toed boots.
Many also have swastika tattoos.
   The previously unknown Mohamed El Boukima Group on Friday
claimed responsibility in an anonymous phone call to a local
newspaper. Police said they were trying to authenticate the call.

   A school bus driver was about eight
minutes late on his route and the inside of his bus was splattered
with blood, but he may have saved a bank guard's life.
   The guard was shot in the face early Friday by a man apparently
trying to steal his gun, police said. The shooting took place while
the guard waited for the bank where he works to open.
   ``I was en route to pick up the kids so I didn't want to stop,''
said James Johnson, 40, a second-year driver for Ryder Student
Transportation. ``But when I saw the man collapse, I knew I
couldn't go on. I don't know how I would have lived with myself if
I had heard he had died later.''
   A witness who was standing nearby helped the guard lie down
after the shooting.
   ``He was talking,'' the witness said.
   The witness, holding the guard in his arms, yelled for passing
motorists to stop but none did until Johnson stopped on the
opposite side of the street.
   Johnson decided to radio for an ambulance so he wouldn't be late
picking up students. But then he noticed that blood had grown from
a spot on the guard's shirt to a pool on the pavement.
   He ran across two lanes of traffic to get the guard to his bus.
   Johnson then drove to a hospital a few blocks away as the guard
sat in a front seat. He walked the guard into the emergency room
and helped him onto a table.
   Then Johnson went back to work, picking up students and taking
them to their school. The bus door, steps, floor and front seat
were still covered with blood.
   Police had no suspect or motive in the case. The 49-year-old
guard, whose name was not released, was listed in stable condition
Saturday at a Kansas City hospital.

<TEXT>
   U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez De
Cuellar, the first U.N. leader to visit Albania, said the world
welcomes its plans for economic and social reforms, Albania's state
news agency reported Saturday.
   Perez De Cuellar made the comments Friday at a dinner in his
honor shortly after his arrival in Albania, the last hard-line
Communist nation in Eastern Europe.
   He planned to meet with Communist Party leader Ramiz Alia over
the weekend.
   Albania remains opposed to any form of multiparty politics, but
it has announced reforms that are expected to give more freedom to
citizens, who live in virtual isolation from the rest of the world.
   The government said last week it will loosen restrictions on
traveling abroad, difficult if not impossible for decades for most
Albanians.
   It also abolished the death penalty for those trying to flee the
country and announced its intention to join the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe after boycotting it since its
inception in 1975.
   As part of a general review of its foreign policy, Albania last
month indicated it was willing to resume diplomatic ties with the
United States and the Soviet Union and begin relations with the
European Economic Community.
   Albania's news agency, ATA, quoted spokesman Petraq Pojani as
saying Foreign Minister Reis Malile told Perez De Cuellar that
Albania ``will develop further relations with the European
community.''

   Authorities closed the University
of Dar es Salaam after students boycotted lectures for a week to
protest insufficient cash allowances, state radio announced
Saturday.
   Radio Tanzania said the 7,500 students were ordered home because
their behavior deteriorated each day after their lecture boycott
began Monday.
   The radio did not specify the students' behavior but witnesses
said in addition to boycotting lectures, the students had drawn
caricatures of several national leaders on campus walls.
   Last month, the students boycotted lectures for a day,
complaining of insufficient cash allowances for food, textbooks,
and travel to and from home. The students receive an annual cash
allowance equivalent to $272.
   They also complained of luck of guaranteed employment on
graduation in the impoverished East African nation now attempting
to abandon socialist economic policies it adopted at independence
from Britain in 1961.

<TEXT>
   The Sandinista daily newspaper on
Saturday accused President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of violating
the constitution by reviewing laws passed during the Sandinistas'
last two months in office.
   Mrs. Chamorro, who ended a decade of leftist Sandinista rule
when she took office April 25, announced the review Friday as about
60,000 government workers staged sit-in strikes, demanding 200
percent pay raises from the new government.
   There were no major rallies or marches Saturday in Managua.
   Among the laws being reviewed are an amnesty law that protects
former Sandinista government officials from prosecution for acts
committed while they were in the government, and another that
restricts ownership of broadcast media.
   Another allowed senior Sandinistas to confiscate homes of the
wealthy.
   The president's move is ``a violation of the constitution as
serious as a coup,'' the Sandinista daily newspaper Barricada said.
   It called the review of the property laws ``unconstitutional,
contrary to agrarian reform and repressive.''
   The present constitution, drawn up during the Sandinista years,
gives the executive branch significant powers to issue decrees in
fiscal and administrative matters.
   On Friday, 2,000 striking workers broke through a police
barricade and took over a plaza outside the presidential office.
The government refused to meet with the strikers and threatened to
fire them.
   Government employees have rejected a 60 percent pay increase
ordered by Mrs. Chamorro, who said her government cannot afford to
meet the employees' demands for bigger raises.
   Labor Minister Francisco Rosales charged that the strike is
being waged not for financial reasons but ``simply to provoke
chaos.''
   On Thursday, Mrs. Chamorro suspended a civil service law that
protects employees from firing and grants them the right to strike
and bargain collectively.
   On Saturday, 85 employees of the information and press
department of the president's office returned to work, said Jairo
Blandon, a spokesman for the workers.
   Workers are demanding cost of living raises to keep up with
inflation. In the latest round of price increases, the government
this week doubled water rates, tripled electricity rates and raised
the rates of telephone services by 1,300 percent. The public
transportation subsidy has also been removed.
   The cordoba, Nicaragua's currency, has been devalued for the
fourth time in less than a month.
   The government also has promised that a commission studying
charges of illegal land seizures will make decisions within seven
days. Only land confiscated after July 29, 1979 will be considered
for review, and all claims must be made within 180 days, the
government said.
   In Tegucigalpa, the Honduran Foreign Ministry said Saturday that
U.S. military helicopters will be used this week to move about
1,800 Nicaraguan Contra rebels and their families from the
Nicaraguan border to a U.N.-run camp in southeast Honduras.
   It cited humanitarian reasons for the approval by the government
and the United Nations for the transfer to the Las Vegas refugee
camp, 50 miles southeast of Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital.
   The camp already has some 10,000 Nicaraguan refugees, and the
government statement said the refugees will stay there until they
return to Nicaragua or go to a third country.
   About 12,000 Contras who fought the Sandinistas left their camps
last month for ``security zones'' within Nicaragua pending their
disarmament and demobilization, which is to be completed by June 10.

   President Bush, decrying ``the tragic
consequences of four decades of communist rule,'' proposed a
``citizens democracy corps'' Saturday to help Eastern Europe
rebuild its political and legal systems.
   He said the corps' first job would be to set up a clearinghouse
for U.S. private assistance and volunteer programs ``to strengthen
the foundations of free society in Eastern Europe.''
   The corps' mandate will be to deal with requests for help in
areas such as law, business, health and the environment.
   It would be started with federal funds. After that, it would be
expected to provide its own funding through private contributions.
   The president announced the program in a commencement address at
the University of South Carolina.
   Before returning to the White House, Bush also was the
graduation speaker at Liberty University, founded in Lynchburg,
Va., by the Rev. Jerry Falwell to emphasize Bible study and
evangelism.
   Departing from his prepared text, Bush underscored his support
for a constitutional amendment permitting school prayer in public
schools. He did not mention his advocacy of another amendment to
ban abortion, but Falwell introduced Bush as a politician who
thinks ``adoption is a better idea than abortion.''
   Emphasizing the need for volunteerism, Bush said the United
States must use its own ``generosity to combat such global problems
as hunger and health care, illiteracy and homelessness.
   ``Each of you can reject membership in a `me' generation,
proving that yours is the `we' generation,'' Bush said, winning
applause from the audience.
   ``In this more peaceful time, when our armies can become
smaller, we must mold a world where the armies of people helping
others can become bigger,''Bush said.
   With a series of five commencement addresses this month, Bush is
laying the foundation for summit talks with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev beginning May 30 in Washington.
   In large measure, the speeches have focused on changes in
Eastern Europe with the collapse of communism.
   ``Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary stand now, in the spring of
1990, as America stood in the summer of 1787,'' Bush told the South
Carolina audience.
   ``Who will be their Franklins, their Washingtons? Their
Hamiltons, their Madisons, their men and women of towering genius?
The nation-builders who will set in place the firm foundations of
self-government?''
   He said, ``We can help them build political systems based on
respect for individual freedoms, for the right to speak our mind,
to live as we wish and to worship as our conscience tells us we
must.''
   A statement released by the White House said the ``citizens
democracy corps'' would mobilize and coordinate American private
sector initiatives for Eastern Europe.
   In particular, the agency will deal with requests in the areas
of constitutional law and parliamentary procedures;
English-language training; journalism; public health and medical
support; banking, financial services and market economics; business
law, commercial practices and agriculture and environmental
protection.
   Bush also announced he was authorizing the U.S. Export-Import
Bank to provide medium-term loan guarantees and credit insurance
for Poland to purchase American machinery, technology and supplies.
   The new arrangement does not provide new money from Washington
but lengthens the terms for credit deals. Currently, Poland is
eligible only for short-term coverage, over a year's span. The new,
medium-term policy will provide guarantees for up to seven years.
   The president said Eastern Europe, under communism, was governed
by ``not the rule of law but the perversion of law: rules made not
to serve the will of the people but the whim of the party.''
   He said the result was a ``landscape of moral destruction. The
tragic consequence of four decades of communist rule: a breakdown
of trust. ...
   ``Fortunately, the moral destruction in Eastern Europe was not
complete,'' the president said. ``Individuals somehow managed to
maintain their inner strength, their moral compass.''
   He said the new leaders in Eastern Europe have ``begun to build
on the ruins of communist rule democratic systems based on trust.''
   The president said Americans can show Eastern Europe ``the
building blocks of a free society,'' such as trade unions,
professional groups and political parties.
   ``We've got to help the emerging democracies build legal systems
that secure the procedural rights that preserve freedom. And above
all, a system that supports a strict equality of rights.''

   Lynn Harwell volunteered at a Red Cross shelter
Saturday while her family prepared for the fifth and possibly worst
flood in a year that also featured a tornado and the total
replacement of the family's home.
   ``We're preparing for the worst and hoping for the best,'' said
Mrs. Harwell, 27, a mother of four and resident of the low-lying
Knight's Forest subdivision in Hardin, about 65 miles northeast of
Houston.
   The city is near a bayou that will be flooded by the rampaging
Trinity River in southeastern Texas. Flooding is expected to begin
Monday.
   ``We've lived here 11 years, but it hasn't been bad until the
last year,'' she said. ``We'd had minor floods, but you could move
in and out.
   ``But last year _ we'll never forget it. From October 1988 to
October 1989, we had four floods, a tornado and two babies,'' Mrs.
Harwell said. ``The tornado came right through my house the night I
came home from the hospital after having the second baby.
   ``But we've been well prepared. When the water starts getting
deep, we send the kids out to relatives. Then we stay a while,''
she said. ``We've got some older people out there who are stubborn
and won't leave and we help them get out because we have the
four-wheel drive.''
   It was only February when the family finished rebuilding their
four-bedroom home, which was damaged by a July flood. Mrs. Harwell
fully expects to lose the new home this year. Upstream, the Trinity
has been flooding to record levels in the past two weeks.
   ``This time when we rebuild, we'll be 10 feet in the air,'' said
Mrs. Harwell. ``I'm three foot up now and am one of the highest
homes in Knight's Forest.''
   The family farmed out furniture to nearby relatives and friends
in Hardin and Houston, leaving only two mattresses, a washing
machine and a microwave oven for the last load.
   ``We'll be out by Monday,'' Mrs. Harwell said. ``We'll head out
after the water rises at least by another foot to three foot. Right
now, we're just being prepared. All I'll lose is my house and I've
got flood insurance this time _ it didn't go into effect until 11
a.m. this morning, but we've got it.''
   Like her neighbors, Mrs. Harwell had been unable to get flood
insurance until the government permitted special disaster policies
to be written in the last week. To be insured, residents must have
purchased the policies at least five days before the flood strikes.
   Mary and Alvin Gregurek also live in Knight's Forest.
   ``We've lived out there since 1976 when we moved out of our home
in Houston and planned to semi-retire, but it hasn't been much of a
retirement,'' she said. ``We've had to fight the elements ever
since we've been out here and it looks like we're fighting a losing
battle.''
   But neither Mrs. Harwell nor Mrs. Gregurek, 59, said they would
consider leaving the area.
   ``We lived in Houston a number of years, but this is home,''
Mrs. Gregurek said. ``It's beautiful in our subdivision. We have
birds and wildlife and it's usually very pleasant.''
   ``It's a good neighborhood,'' Mrs. Harwell said. ``It's got good
schools and it's beautiful here.''

<HEAD>Anti-Communist Rally Draws 100,000 in Prague</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ONDREJ HEJMA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 100,000 people, some yelling
``Punish! Punish!'' demonstrated Saturday to demand ousted
Communist leaders be punished for crimes committed during four
decades of rule.
   The rally was the largest since November protests toppled the
hard-line Communist leadership and followed several recent
anti-Communist demonstrations, apparently designed to hurt the
party in June 8-9 election. The vote will be the first free polling
in four decades.
   The crowd shared downtown Prague's Wenceslas Square with 20
activists on a hunger strike since May 6. They want unjustly
acquired Communist property confiscated and the party archives
opened.
   Many in the crowd chanted ``Punish! Punish!'' during the
protest, organized by the 8,000-member Confederation of Political
Prisoners.
   ``We want people to hear the truth about communism, we demand
investigation of all Communist crimes and just punishment for those
who are found guilty,'' said 75-year-old confederation chairman,
Rudolf Pernicky.
   Former Communist leaders, including Milos Jakes, are living on
substantial government pensions in Czechoslovakia, and the new
leadership has made no moves to prosecute them, despite growing
public pressure.
   The keynote speaker, Vladimir Struska, told the crowd: ``The
Nazis preached racial hatred, the Communists preached class
hatred.''
   Another speaker, John Bok, a Radical Party candidate for
Parliament, said: ``The Communists were the biggest and best
organized Mafia in the whole world, using the traditional methods:
intimidation, pressure and blackmail.''
   President Vaclav Havel visited the hunger strikers late Friday
in a gesture of support for their demands, Czechoslovak televison
reported. Havel is a former dissident playwright who was often the
target of Communist persecution.
   Polls indicate the Communists, who now profess to favor
democratic reforms, may place third in the June election with 10-12
percent of the vote. About 700,000 Communists withdrew from the
party late last year, but it still claims a membership of 900,000
among the 15.5 million population.
   The undisputed favorite in the election is the Civic Forum, with
an estimated 22 percent, and the Christian Democratic alliance is
second with 15 percent, according to polls.
   The Civic Forum played a key role in organizing the November
protests.
   Public opinion surveys say 36 percent of the electorate is still
undecided, and most of those voters are expected to support the new
democratic parties.

   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov went on national
television Saturday night and sought to assure workers they will be
protected from high prices and unemployment as the Soviet Union
moves toward a market economy.
   The government will do everything it can _ including indexing
wages to prices _ to ensure that there will be as mild a transition
to a market economy as possible, Ryzhkov said in an interview with
a Soviet television journalist.
   He stressed several times that price reform would never be
introduced without discussing it with the people.
   ``For these radical measures, one would introduce them only with
the people's agreement,'' he said, adding that was the only way to
avoid a political and social crisis.
   Soviet leaders have been grappling with how to introduce the
radical reforms scheduled to go into effect this summer without
causing public opposition and social upheaval.
   Officials have sought in recent weeks to emphasize that a
Polish-style ``shock therapy'' approach to economic reform _
including a sudden freeing of prices, devaluation of the currency
and a rapid rise in unemployment _ was not planned. Ryzhkov's
appearance on television appeared aimed at underscoring that.
   The economic plan is being drafted by the Presidential Council _
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's advisory body _ and Ryzhkov said
it would be published in the press and debated in the Supreme
Soviet legislature after May 20.
   Ryzhkov said steps would be taken to protect the public from a
spurt in inflation. He said the government was working on an
indexing system to link salaries to price increases, but he gave no
specifics.
   A senior Gorbachev adviser, Alexander Yakovlev, said earlier
this month that prices must rise enough to sop up an estimated 500
billion rubles ($825 billion at the official exchange rate) that
Soviet citizens have stashed away because there are so few consumer
goods to buy.
   Ryzhkov said the government disagrees with those who believe
unemployment will help the process of economic development. He
emphasized that the Soviet Constitution guarantees the right to
work.
   Ryzkhov's remarks came one day after Gorbachev told workers that
it lags behind the West in terms of productivity.
   ``In our country ... two to three people are doing what in the
West only one person is doing,'' Gorbachev told workers Friday at
the ``Bolshevik'' confectionary factory.

   Texans who live along the 550-mile Trinity River
came out on the losing side of an annual gamble this year:
Reservoirs were kept full of water for the hot, dry summer, not
lowered for a chance of spring floods.
   Hundreds of angry landowners criticized the Trinity River
Authority for failing to provide a safety margin in the level of
Lake Livingston as water flowed downstream from record flooding in
northern Texas.
   About 300 people who attended an authority meeting two weeks ago
claim the agency could have prevented emergency heavy releases that
will add to flooding below the dam.
   ``I am fearful that push will come to shove on this thing.
People all up and down the river are adamant about it _ they're mad
and highly upset,'' said Liberty County Judge Dempsie Henley.
``They're making all kinds of threats, including wanting to file
lawsuits.''
   But TRA spokesman John Jadrosich said the flooding cannot be
controlled.
   ``To build a lake to provide proper flood control to the lower
Trinity would be of almost unimaginable size. It is doubtful you
could do it,'' he said.
   ``This is a flood plain,'' Jadrosich said. ``It will flood again
next year. It has done so since time immemorial, and there's
absolutely nothing the Trinity River Authority can do to provide
relief to these poor, beleaguered people downstream. We are doing
everything we can do at this point.''
   The discharge of water over the spillway at the Lake Livingston
dam, normally about 20,000 cubic feet of water per second,
increased Saturday as the leading edge of the flood arrived to
48,200 cubic feet per second, said Jim Mitchum, Liberty County
emergency management coordinator.
   But later Saturday, TRA officials increased that estimate to
90,000 to 100,000 cfs because of rain Friday night upstream and
said a flow above 75,000 cfs would be sustained for up to nine
days. Jadrosich said the previous record flow over the dam, built
in 1969, was 75,000 cfs in June 1973. Niagara Falls has a mean
annual flow of at about 212,200 cfs.
   Henley said a flow of 40,000 cfs is enough to cover an acre of
land one foot deep in one second.
   ``Tuesday through Friday, we will have the crest come in here
and we will have a major, dangerous flood _ the highest in the
history of the county since the lake built,'' Henley said.
   Henley issued an evacuation warning urging 7,000 people to
evacuate low-lying areas below the dam.
   Mitchum said most people felt that, although the dam is not
intended for flood control, water should have been released after
the heavy rain in the Dallas-Fort Worth area so the reservoir would
have had more capacity when the flood water arrived.
   But Jadrosich said that because Lake Livingston is so large _
with a surface of 90,000 acres _ it would have taken several weeks
to make a dent in the lake level.
   And, he added, considering the size of the Trinity's flood: ``If
Lake Livingston was completely dry like it was in 1969, it would
fill completely up and would still produce a flood downstream.''
   State Rep. Mark Stiles, who organized the TRA meeting two weeks
ago for his constituents, said he has not been pleased with the
authority's attitude and compalined that TRA Executive Director
Danny Vance went on vacation at the time of the flooding.
   ``It's not his fault that it rained, but I think we need to be
devising plans to give people relief,'' Stiles said.
   ``There's a lot of folk in the Legislature that don't like the
Trinity River Authority,'' he said. ``We're going to talk about the
way they're operating it.''
   Eight of the 23 artificial lakes along the Trinity River
watershed are managed by the Army Corps of Engineers. The area
drained by the river is nearly 18,000 square miles, or 6 percent of
the state's total area.
   Ron Ruffennach, public affairs officer for the corps' Fort Worth
district, said there's a tradeoff that Texans must accept.
   ``If it weren't for the lakes, we wouldn't have drinking
water,'' he said.
   And he added: ``The flood control projects that are built to
protect people downstream can only do so much if people keep
building in the flood plains.''

<HEAD>Arms Control Advocates Say Test Pushes Limits of ABM Treaty</HEAD>

   Arms control advocates said Saturday a newly
tested missile tracking device could violate the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty if deployed as part of the Star Wars
defense system.
   ``The test does not have all the capabilities would need, but it
is clearly intended to lead to a component which could be in
violation of the treaty,'' said Spurgeon M. Keeny, president of the
Washington-based Arms Control Association.
   Keeny said the six-hour test flight Friday of the Airborne
Optical Adjunct-Airborne Surveillance Testbed stopped short of
being a violation of the ABM treaty. But Keeny added that ``the
issue is whether the test is leading to a component which if
successful would be in violation.''
   The infrared tracking device was mounted on a Boeing 767 that
took off from Boeing Field in Seattle. It is designed to track
hundreds of targets, sorting missiles from debris and decoys.
   Three months of flight testing over the continental United
States will be followed by tests using Air Force targets at
Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific.
   The ABM treaty bans space-based systems designed to substitute
for radar in an ordinary system. The pact was approved on the
theory that anytime one side in the Cold War built an
anti-ballistic missile system the other would find a way around it,
causing the arms race to spiral.
   John Pike of the Washington-based Federation of American
Scientists issued a statement saying that the ``Airborne Optical
System performs a role similar to that of the Perimiter Acquisition
Radar (PAR) in the Sentinel-Safeguard system'' and that ``radars
such as the PAR were clearly considered to be ABM components and
subjected to strict limitations in the treaty.''
   ``Thus while A0A may not be able to perform all of the functions
that an ABM radar might be required to perform, it nonetheless is
capable of substituting for an ABM radar, and since it is air-based
it is banned under Article V of the treaty,'' Pike said.
   Pentagon spokesman William O'Connell said, however, that the
system has undergone a treaty compliance review and does not
violate the treaty in any respect. He said that it cannot scan wide
areas of space but must be told where to look and therefore cannot
be considered a substitute for radar.
   Friday's test, he said, was primarily to determine the effects
of vibration on new technology that has come into being since the
system was developed.
   The device tested Friday was described in Seattle as the world's
most sophisticated long-wave infrared sensor. It was contained in
an 86-foot cupola mounted atop the aircraft.
   Keeny is a former deputy director of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency. The Arms Control Association is a private,
Washington-based group, many of whose members have been arms
control officials, including former Secretary of Defense Robert S.
McNamara and Disarmament Agency Director Paul C. Warnke.

Seminar</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference led a court-ordered race relations seminar
Saturday for four former Ku Klux Klansmen, and said the response
was better than he'd expected.
   ``I didn't anticipate the tremendous experience we had,'' the
Rev. Joseph Lowery of Atlanta said after he and other SCLC
representatives met for two hours with the ex-Klansmen in a hotel.
   However, one of the ex-Klansmen, Roger Handley of Steele, called
the session ``a wasted two hours.''
   ``He didn't change my feelings,'' said Handley. ``I told Lowery
he ought to take his message of brotherly love into the projects
where there are drugs, rapes and murders.''
   Another former Klansman, Terry Tucker of Cullman, called the
session ``a learning experience.''
   ``We've got a lot more common ground than people would think,''
he said. ``I never have hated blacks and I don't think they hate
us.''
   The session was ordered last year by U.S. District Judge E.B.
Haltom Jr. as part of a settlement of a lawsuit stemming from Klan
violence against black marchers in Decatur on May 26, 1979, in
which gunfire wounded two whites and two blacks.
   Black marchers were protesting the conviction of Tommy Lee
Hines, a retarded black man found guilty of raping a white woman.
Klansmen attacked the marchers and shots were fired, wounding four
people.
   As part of the court settlement, the men were ordered to leave
the Klan, perform community service and pay varying fines.
   Lowery said he talked to the four ``about the oneness of the
human family, self-respect, the economics of race _ how all poor
people are taken advantage of, about the futility of violence and
violent resistance to racial progress, how darkness can't hold back
the dawn.''
   Cross-burnings have been a dreaded symbol of the KKK over the
years, but Lowery said he told them ``the cross is a symbol of our
faith, and we hope it would be used for that.''
   Tucker finished serving a two-month prison sentence for the
violence in March 1989 and said he's had no contact with the Klan
since.
   ``I feel there are different ways of going about things,'' he
said. As for his role in the Decatur melee, Tucker said: ``I
probably was just a young person sowing bad oats, that's all.''
   Another of the four attending the seminar, Doug Berryhill of
Huntsville, said it was ``a productive meeting and I learned quite
a bit.''
   Herbert Campbell of Tuscumbia, using a newspaper to shield his
face from news cameras, was asked if he learned anything. ``I
learned to keep a newspaper with me,'' he said.
   Handley said he would have no reservations about rejoining the
Klan.
   A fifth Klansman, Derane Godfrey of Wylam, was ordered to attend
the session but didn't show up. Elizabeth Johnson, a lawyer from
the Montgomery-based Southern Poverty Law Center, which brought the
lawsuit against the Klan, said she wasn't sure what would be done
about Godfrey's absence.
   Lowery said that at the end of the two-hour course, all but one
of those present held hands while prayers were offered. He declined
to say which one.
   Among the blacks at the session were Lowery and his wife,
Evelyn; an SCLC aide, Ralph Worrell of Atlanta; the Rev. John
Nettles of Gadsden, Alabama SCLC president, and the Rev. Abraham
Woods, president of the Birmingham SCLC chapter.

   A measure that would impose stiff fines or jail
sentences for insulting or slandering the Soviet president was
approved Saturday by one chamber of the Soviet legislature but
failed in the other chamber, Tass said. The bill will now go to a
committee to be reworked and introduced at another session, the
official Soviet news agency reported.
   The measure was introduced after an angry Red Square protest May
1 in which thousands of people shouted or displayed slogans
demanding the leadership resign. Some called President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev a dictator.
   Alexander N. Yakovlev, a close adviser to Gorbachev, said the
demonstrators had insulted Kremlin leaders, who left their
reviewing stand atop Lenin's Mausoleum after enduring about 20
minutes of the protest.
   The legislation appeared to have been brought up for debate
hastily, but it was not immediately clear whether it was directly
connected to the protest.
   There previously had been no reports that such a draft measure
existed, and as late as Thursday, legislative officials made no
mention of it on the agenda.
   Tass said the bill to protect ``the honor and dignity of the
Soviet president'' was approved by the Council of the Union, one
chamber of the legislature, but it failed in the other house, the
Council of the Nationalities.
   Speakers who favored the law said statements discrediting or
insulting the head of state can help destabilize society, the news
agency said. Other deputies insisted that the bill contain a
clear-cut definition of what constitutes an ``insult.''
   Yevgeny Sorokin, a spokesman for the Supreme Soviet, or
legislature, said the bill would impose a fine of up to $5,000, two
years in a labor camp or three years in jail for slandering or
insulting the president.
   Tass quoted Yuri Kalmykov, chairman of the Parliamentary
Legislation Committee, as saying the measure was necessary because
the head of state needed special protection.
   The bill would cover all public pronouncements containing
critical remarks concerning the activity of the Soviet president or
a policy pursued under his leadership, Tass said.
   Under the measure, an offense conducted with the help of the
news media could be punishable by a jail term of up to six years,
Tass said. It said a newspaper, radio or TV station carrying such
material could be fined up to $41,600 and be suspended from
broadcasting or publishing.
   The Soviet Parliament elected Gorbachev to a new, powerful
executive presidency on March 15.
   Gorbachev has said he wants to use the presidency to unite the
country. But criticism of his policies and pressure from some
republics for autonomy or outright secession have become more acute
since Gorbachev took the new post.
   Yakovlev said May 4 that the Soviet leadership was insulted by
the protesters in the unofficial May Day protest.
   ``I saw Stalin portraits, Nicholas II portraits,'' he said.
``Slogans were heard that Ceausescu's destiny is in store for some
people,'' referring to Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu, executed
after a summary trial Dec. 25.
   ``That was really unfortunate,'' Yakovlev said. ``Anybody would
treat these slogans as an insult.''

   Mexico's Congress on Saturday approved a
constitutional amendment to allow complete private ownership of
banks, eight years after they were nationalized.
   The measure now needs the approval of the Senate and 31 state
legislatures.
   The 339-54 vote came eight hours after the Chamber of Deputies
convened early Saturday to take up the issue. There were 12
abstentions.
   Passage was virtually assured after the conservative National
Action Party threw its support behind the amendment.
   The measure was proposed a week earlier by President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari and supported by his Institutional Revolutionary
Party.
   Members of leftist parties could not gather enough votes to
block the reform, which needed a two-thirds vote to pass. The
governing party and the conservatives together have 364 of the 500
congressional seats.
   The measure goes next to the Senate, where the governing party
has an overwhelming majority. A simple majority also is needed in
31 state legislatures.
   Banks were nationalized in 1982 by outgoing President Jose Lopez
Portillo following an economic downturn attributed to a fall in
price for oil, Mexico's leading export.
   Lopez Portillo's successor, Miguel de la Madrid, amended the
legislation to allow up to 34 percent private investment in banks.
   Under the proposal passed Saturday, commerical banks could be
100 percent privately owned, but some specialized development banks
would remain in government hands.
   Other details of the privatization remained to be worked out.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Saturday signed a
proclamation calling on China to ``respond positively'' to the
freedom aspirations of demonstrators Beijing violently suppressed a
year ago.
   Bush signed a congressional proclamation naming Sunday, May 13,
a national day in support of human rights. The proclamation asked
Americans to observe the day ``in the spirit of commemorating those
who died'' in Beijing's Tiananmen Square at the hands of the
Chinese government.
   It said people should observe the day, ``drawing inspiration
from the courage of those who held fast to their ideals in the face
of violent suppression, and urging the Chinese government to
respond positively to the fundamental aspirations for freedom
expressed in last year's demonstrations.''
   ``These are the same fundamental aspirations as profoundly
expressed by people around the world during the momentous events we
are still witnessing _ events that are daily advancing the cause of
freedom and human rights.''
   Congress passed the proclamation on Friday and sent it to the
president. Bush, the U.S. diplomatic representative to Beijing in
the mid-1970s, has been criticized for failing to take stricter
economic and political measures to show displeasure with China's
repressive and violent tactics.
   While Bush in the past has decried China's violence against its
pro-democracy demonstrators, he has also taken steps to renew
normal relations with Beijing following an initial cut off of all
high-level government contact.
   He secretly sent National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft to
meet with the Chinese two times in the summer following the
Tiananmen Square massacre of demonstrators.
   The proclamation notes the June 3-4 violent attacks on thousands
of Chinese protesters by tanks and armed forces.
   ``This action, far beyond the legitimate requirements of law and
order, resulted in the deaths of hundreds of unarmed citizens,''
Bush's statement said. ``In the months that followed, thousands
more were detained and otherwise punished for their peaceful
expression of political views.''
   However, he stated, ``Steps have been taken in recent months
that have resulted in some improvement.''
   China lifted martial law in Beijing and the Tibetan capital of
Lhasa, announced release of hundreds of political prisoners and
stated it would receive officially sponsored U.S. scholars and
Peace Corps volunteers, the statement said.
   ``The United States hopes that these steps will be followed by
others that will demonstrate China's return to the path of
reform,''Bush said.
   In the face of criticism that he has been too soft on China, the
president maintains that China has too much geopolitical importance
in the world to be isolated by the United States. He has stated he
is disappointed that Beijing has not fully reversed its destructive
policies, but maintains it is better to continue talking to the
Chinese about these matters than to shun the world's most populous
nation.

<HEAD>Virginia Governor Tells State Agencies to Divest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. L. Douglas Wilder urged all state
agencies and institutions Saturday to divest themselves of
companies with interests in South Africa.
   Wilder, speaking at commencement ceremonies at Norfolk State
University, said the freedom sought by blacks in South Africa ``is
no different from the freedom sought in East Germany, Poland and
Lithuania. Our support can be no less.''
   Wilder, the nation's first elected black governor, chose
predominantly black Norfolk State to make the divestiture
announcement. It followed reports earlier in the week that his
administration was quietly urging University of Virginia officials
to sell the school's holdings in companies with South African
interests.
   In addition to the university, the Virginia Supplemental
Retirement System has $400 million to $700 million in investments
in companies operating in South Africa, according to system
officials. Overall, the retirement system has almost $9 billion in
assets.
   Wilder does not have the power to order the university or the
retirement system to divest, but the governor makes appointments to
the trustee boards of both.
   Recent progress in South Africa against apartheid, the policy of
keeping whites and blacks separated, is a result of international
indignation and sanctions, the governor said.
   ``If we are to participate in the extension to all people
freedoms and liberties which we hold dear, we must take concrete
actions which reflect our support,'' he said.
   The University of Virginia, where students have staged protests
in recent weeks to push for divestiture, has reduced the South
African holdings of its endowment from $37 million to $15.5
million. The university's total endowment is $460 million.
   The finance committee of the school's board of visitors plans to
meet this week to decide whether to recommend elimination of the
remaining holdings. The entire board will meet May 24-25.

<HEAD>Thatcher Resolves To Fight On As Conservative Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABERDEEN, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
fighting to regain lost popularity, pledged Saturday to remain
leader of the Conservative Party and predicted victory in the next
election.
   ``There's a lot more to do _ a woman's work is never done,'' she
told flag-waving members of the Scottish Conservative Party.
   ``Radical policies have helped us to win three general
elections. And they will win us a fourth,'' she said.
   The next election must be held by mid-1992.
   Conservative popularity has been hit by high interest rates,
rising inflation and an unpopular new local government tax paid by
all adults, which replaces property taxes paid only by homeowners.
   But Mrs. Thatcher signaled her belief that the tide of public
opinion _ which had seen the Conservatives trailing the opposition
Labor Party by more than 20 points _ was turning.
   In the latest opinion polls, Labor's lead was cut to between 11
and 15 percent. Although the Conservatives lost in this month's
local elections, the results were not as disastrous as forecast.
   ``If we play as a team and keep our eye on the ball, we can make
it a Conservative grand slam,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   The prime minister's reiteration of her plans to lead the party
into the next election came two days after former defense secretary
Michael Heseltine, regarded as her main rival for the leadership,
criticized the new tax, dubbed the poll tax.
   He said most Britons regarded the poll tax as ``too high, unfair
or both, and it has created a lingering sense of injustice.''
   The prime minister never mentioned Heseltine, launching instead
into an attack on the socialist Labor Party. At the end, she was
cheered.

   Rain, some of it heavy, fell Saturday from the Plains and
Mississippi Valley up the Ohio Valley and around the lower Great
Lakes. Temperatures dropped to record lows in the Northeast.
   Overnight and morning thunderstorms produced locally heavy rain
across sections of the southern half of the Plains and lower
Mississippi Valley, hitting already-saturated areas in flooded
Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.
   At least two tornadoes touched down in northwestern Louisiana.
One ripped roofs off homes in Haughton, about 20 miles east of
Shreveport, but no injuries were reported, according to the Bossier
Parish sheriff's office. Another touched down near Florien, in
west-central Louisiana, but caused no damage, authorities there
said.
   Thunderstorms produced hail three-quarters of an inch in
diameter in Kansas near Wichita and southwest of Auburn. One-inch
hail fell in Oklahoma at Billings and Nardin and near Wichita, Kan.
Hail as big as golf balls fell at Goddard, Kan., and in Texas at
Groesbeck, Woden, Redland and Hemphill, the National Weather
Service reported.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued into the afternoon across
western Mississippi, much of Arkansas, western Tennessee, the
northwest half of Kentucky, southeastern Missouri, western
Pennsylvania, western West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, southern Lower
Michigan, Illinois, southern Wisconsin, Iowa, northern Missouri,
southeastern Nebraska and northeastern Kansas.
   Showers also extended over western and north-central Montana.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 1 p.m. CDT included
2.71 inches at Shreveport, La.; 1.38 inches at Monroe, La.; and
1.11 inches at Indianapolis.
   The temperature in Youngstown, Ohio, dropped to a record low of
just 31 degrees Saturday morning. Atlantic City, N.J., tied its
record low for the date at 34.
   Saturday's low for the Lower 48 states was 22 at Warroad, Minn.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 40
degrees in Cut Bank, Mont., to 96 in Beeville, Texas.

<HEAD>Report: CIA Condoned Plans For Training Camp In Antigua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel Television reported Saturday that the
CIA condoned a plan by an Israeli reserve colonel to set up a
training camp for Panamanian rebels in Antigua and equip it with
Israeli weapons.
   The CIA declined to comment on the report, which came as
Antiguan investigators were in Israel to inquire about the weapons
shipment.
   The camp project was never completed, and Antiguan investigators
say the Israeli arms later were diverted to a Colombian drug
chieftain.
   CIA representatives stationed on the Caribbean island did not
oppose the training camp project, the report said.
   ``We always decline to comment on reports of this nature,'' said
CIA spokesman Peter Earnest.
   The four-member Antiguan investigative team was assisted by U.S.
experts, the report said. It said the team completed its inquiry
Saturday and is to report back to the Antiguan government.
   On Tuesday, the Israeli Foreign Ministry gave the investigators
a file of documents, one signed by Antigua's top defense offical,
Vere Bird Jr. It assured Israel the arms would not be sent to a
third country and would be used exclusively by the Antiguan
military.
   The investigators also questioned reserve Col. Yair Klein, who
had wanted to set up the camp, the report said.
   The affair began when Klein, who runs a private security company
called Hod Hahanit, or Spearhead, approached the Antiguan
government with plans to create a military training camp, according
to the TV report.
   A senior Antiguan military official, who was not identified,
told CIA representatives on the island of the plan and they did not
oppose it, the report said.
   Klein told Israel Television the school was ``supposed to train
500 fighters'' opposed to Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega, who were
``supposed to use the weapons coming from Israel.'' But plans for
the camp fell through, the weapons ``were returned to the elements
who bought them in Panama,'' he said.
   Noriega was toppled in the December U.S. invasion of Panama and
was brought to the United States to face drug charges.
   Klein offered no explanation as to how the weapons reached
Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, a drug boss killed in a raid by Colombian
police in December.
   After Rodriguez Gacha's death, about 200 Israeli-made Galil
assault rifles were found on his ranch.
   The New York Times named Klein and Maurice Sarfati, an Israeli
owner of a produce business in Antigua, as responsible for the arms
diversion.
   Colombian officials say Klein is wanted for organizing, training
and equipping paramilitary groups. He has been declared a fugitive
from justice and may be tried in absentia.
   Klein says he provided self-defense training to Colombian
farmers at the time of the Antiguan camp project. But the
television report quoted him as saying the projects were not linked.
   Colombia on Friday suspended a 28-year-old agreement allowing
Israelis to enter the country without visas in protest over the
smuggling of Israeli weapons to cocaine traffickers.

   The Coast Guard reopened the Houston Ship Channel
Saturday after firefighters extinguished a blaze on a tanker that
injured three crew members and 10 firefighters, officials said.
   Firefighting crews extinguished the flames on the 374-foot Seta,
a Panamanian-flag vessel, about 6:30 a.m. Saturday, but two pumper
boats, a ladder truck and a firefighting team remained at the scene
to guard against hot spots flaring up.
   The fire was expected to continue smoldering for several days
because of insulation aboard the vessel, said Coast Guard Lt.
Robert Hennessy.
   The three-alarm blaze around 6 p.m. Friday prompted the Coast
Guard to close the channel to prevent the fire from spreading to
other vessels. The channel was reopened to one-way traffic after
the fire was put out.
   Representatives of Lario Maritime Inc., a Liberia-based firm
that owns the Seta, were examining the tanker Saturday, Hennessy
said.
   Two of the 13 people injured remained hospitalized Saturday. A
crewman was in fair condition with first- and second-degree burns
at Ben Taub Hospital and a firefighter was in good condition at
Hermann Hospital, spokespeople said.
   The fire started when a flammable liquid in the water somehow
ignited, said Hennessy. The blaze then spread to the Seta's living
quarters.
   He that earlier reports that the fire started in the engine room
or its unloaded cargo bays proved incorrect.
   ``The cargo tank never got involved, and none of the fuel tanks
nor engine room were involved,'' he said.
   The Seta has 20 to 25 crew members, but officials didn't know
how many people were aboard at the time of the fire.
   ``We had just finished eating dinner when we heard an explosion.
I just jumped off into the water. I don't know where it came
from,'' said Mandic Dusko, a Yugoslavian electrician on the Seta.
   The ship was empty, but residues of four combustible chemicals _
methanol, acetone, kerosene and hexane _ were in the cargo hold
when it exploded, said Dr. Paul Pepe, head of Houston's emergency
medical services.
   The ship was dry docked for cleaning at Newpark Shipbuilding &amp;
Repair Inc.'s shipyard on Brady Island, a fire department spokesman
said.

   Vice President Dan Quayle told graduates at
the University of Mississippi on Saturday that it's time to build
on the signs of freedom observed in Eastern Europe and the Baltic
States.
   ``Though we now have freedom-making advances, it will take this
generation's leadership to make sure that it is permanent and not
temporary,'' Quayle said.
   He told the 1,150 Ole Miss graduates that their generation must
help those in emerging democracies develop economic and technical
skills.
   ``Eastern Europe lacks these skills, yet the people of Eastern
Europe are determined to make the transition from a controlled
economy to a free-market economy,'' Quayle said.
   ``Helping them will require new strategies and creative
policies,'' he said. ``Freedom means peace. Tyranny brings
conflict. This generation of leadership is committed to freedom.''
   The vice president said Americans realize that a more democratic
world is likely to be a more peaceful world.
   But he said the United States must watch out for ``enemies of
democracy who will try to turn the clock back.''

   STARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) _ Honduran President Rafael Callejas
Saturday urged graduates of Mississippi State University, his own
alma mater, to make sure the barriers to democracy keep tumbling
down.
   Callejas shared his vision of a united Central America with the
1,450 graduates and their guests.
   ``I am working to pool economic and natural resources in order
to establish the foundation from which our young Central American
democracies can flourish,'' he said.
   ``I envision a Central America free of hostility, free of
violence, free of drugs, and free of barriers to trade and economic
cooperation.''
   Callejas cited his own election in November, which marked the
first peaceful transfer of power to an opposition party in Honduras
in 57 years, as just one among many recent democratic triumphs
around the world.
   He recalled his own Mississippi State graduations, with a
bachelor's degree in agricultural economics in 1965 and a master's
degree in 1966.
   ``Today my dream is to achieve for my country those wonderful
principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness _
principles I learned here at Mississippi State,'' Callejas said.
   ``I want my country to live in a world of democracy and peace,
in a world of economic stability and opportunity for every person.''

<TEXT>
   Indian leaders from five South American
nations returned to their rain forest homelands Saturday after
forming an alliance with international environmentalists to
cooperate to save the Amazon jungle.
   Thirteen leaders of 1.2 million Indians living in the Amazon
River basin in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil signed
a pact late Friday night with representatives of 14 international
conservationist groups.
   The agreement came after three days of meetings in this isolated
Amazon River port 715 miles northeast of Lima.
   The Indians convened the gathering to demand a voice in
environmentists' efforts to preserve the vast Amazon jungle from
destruction.
   ``Many times conservationists see only the pretty birds, the
pretty rivers, the pretty green trees,'' Evaristo Nugkuag, an
Aguaruna Indian leader from Peru, said in the closing ceremony.
``You forget that Indians live in this jungle, that we are its true
caretakers, its true protectors.''
   Nugkuag is president of the Coordinating Body for Indigenous
Peoples' Organizations of the Amazon Basin.
   The agreement was signed by representatives of such
organizations as Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund. It said
the group recognized the importance of the Indians' own proposals
for conservation of the Amazon.
   An estimated 50 to 100 acres of tropical rain forest is being
cleared in the Amazon every minute, according to ecologists for the
Smithsonian Institution.
   The Indians are battling to save their homelands from migrant
farmers, ranchers, loggers, gold prospectors, oil companies, and
other groups seeking economic gain from the jungle.
   Lately, they have also become concerned about the hundreds of
thousands of acres of forest being destroyed to grow coca leaves,
the raw material for cocaine.
   In their first meeting with environmentalists in Washington in
October, they expressed growing doubts about the debt-for-nature
swaps in which some of the foreign debt crippling South American
countries is traded for a commitment to set aside rain forest lands
as wilderness preserves.
   ``Without consulting us, you have traded our land for a debt we
did not incur,'' Nugkuag told the Washington gathering.
   In such arrangements, conservation groups assume a portion of a
country's debt to foreign banks in exchange for the country's
setting aside land for protection.
   Since 1987 in Latin America there have been debt-for-nature
swaps in Bolivia, Ecuador and Costa Rica.
   The Indians complain that the swaps have shown disregard for
their rights. They propose that Indian tribes be given stewardship
of their ancestral territories as part of the swaps.
   No accord was reached in Iquitos on the debt-swap issue. But the
Indian leaders and conservationists agreed to meet again in
Washington in September to pursue joint actions.
   Barbara Bramble, the head of the National Wildlife Federation's
international program, said the environmentalists realized the
Indians are important allies in the fight to save the Amazon.
   ``We're an organization dedicated to the wise use of
resources,'' she said. ``The people who are doing that best are
tribal people, not North Americans.''

<HEAD>Rebels Claim Road Cut Between Major Towns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sudanese rebels said Saturday they had cut
the only road between two government-held towns in the south and
threatened to shoot down aircraft flying to a garrison.
   The Sudan People's Liberation Army said it severed the route
between Yei and Juba, capital of Equatoria Province, after an
attack Thursday on a military convoy. They said 92 troops were
killed.
   The claim, made in a clandestine radio broadcast, could not be
independently verified.
   The rebels on Friday had said they had captured the town of
Melut and controlled traffic on a 200-mile stretch of the White
Nile. The claim also was not confirmed, and the Sudanese government
has made no mention of fighting in Melut, 350 miles south of the
capital of Khartoum.
   In the radio broadcast Saturday, monitored in Nairobi, the
rebels said ``any attempt to reinforce troops in Yei by air will be
met by our gunners now under maximum alert.''
   The garrison at Yei, which rebels say is under siege, is about
93 miles southwest of Juba and near Zaire's border.
   The rebels control most of the countryside in southern Sudan and
regularly bombard Juba and Yei with mortar and artillery.
   The rebels took up arms in 1983 to press for increased autonomy
for Christian and animist southerners. Traditionally, the
government in Sudan is dominated by Moslem northerners.

<HEAD>Iliescu Says Protester-Filled Square to be `Cleaned Out'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN PETREANU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interim President Ion Iliescu said
Saturday he expected a central square blocked for three weeks by
anti-government protesters would be ``cleaned out'' this week.
   Chances of compromise appeared to run out Saturday when
representatives of the anti-Iliescu rally spurned an invitation
from Iliescu to talk. Protesters want Iliescu to resign and all
former Communists out of politics.
   The demonstration in University Square entered its 21st day and
about 2,000 demonstrators had gathered by nightfall. They shouted
slogans and sang songs against Iliescu and his National Salvation
Front.
   The Front is the dominant force in the interim government and is
heavily favored to win May 20 elections, when voters will choose a
president and the first freely elected government in five decades.
   A December revolution toppled and executed hard-line Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. But the opposition says the Front, with
many former Communists including Iliescu, seeks to re-establish a
totalitarian system.
   On Saturday, Iliescu repeatedly set Thursday as the last day
political rallies could be held and indicated he viewed the
University Square demonstration as such a rally.
   ``I expect that by Thursday the square should be cleaned out,''
Iliescu said. When asked if he would order the police to clear the
square, he replied: ``We shall see.''
   Iliescu rejected charges the opposition was harassed during the
campaign.
   ``Compared to what happens in other democratic countries in
similar situations, I would say it has been pretty mild,'' he said.
``I understand in Italy they've had six deaths _ we've only had
threats.''
   In London, the British Foreign Office said it told Romania it
was concerned about reports of violence against opposition
candidates. Britain, however, did not follow the United States in
withdrawing its ambassador.
   On Thursday, the United States recalled Ambassador Alan Green
over concerns the election will not be free and fair. He is
expected to return before the elections.
   Iliescu said that if the Front wins an absolute majority in the
voting ``it will still be open to forming a coalition with other
political forces.''
   Iliescu and other members of the provisional Parliament, which
held its last session Friday, waited for about an hour Saturday for
a delegation representing the University Square demonstrators.
   Afterward, Iliescu spokesman Paul Financu issued a statement
saying the government was still ``open to dialogue.''
   On Tueday the first meeting between protesters and the
government broke down minutes after it began when Iliescu refused a
demand to videotape the discussions and broadcast them live on
television.
   Constantin Dumitrescu, spokesman for a main protest group,
appeared to rule out another attempt at talks, saying that since
the provisional Parliament no longer planned to meet, ``there no
longer exists the institutional framework for resolving our
demands.''
   Iliescu and other members of the Front are former Communists who
served under Ceausescu. All now profess democratic convictions and
several _ Iliescu among them _ turned against Ceausescu long before
he fell.

<TEXT>
   Jurors in the murder trial of a man accused in
the Bensonhurst racial slaying told the judge Saturday that they'd
reached verdicts on some charges, but couldn't agree on others.
   Judge Thadeus Owens instructed jurors in the trial of Keith
Mondello, 19, to retire for the evening, telling them to get a good
night's sleep and ``give it your best shot tomorrow.''
   Another jury considering murder and other charges against a
second defendant, 19-year-old Joseph Fama, ended another day of
deliberations without reaching a verdict in the slaying of Yusuf
Hawkins.
   Hawkins, a black 16-year-old, was shot to death Aug. 23 in the
mostly white Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn.
   More than 200 demonstrators rallied in Hawkins' memory Saturday
afternoon outside the Brooklyn courthouse where both juries were
deliberating.
   The Mondello jury began deliberating Monday evening and the Fama
panel late Tuesday.
   At 6:50 p.m. Saturday, jurors in the Mondello case sent Owens a
note saying, ``We the jury are unable to reach a unanimous
decision.''
   Owens asked jury forewoman Mimi Snowden whether the jury was
deadlocked on all the counts. She responded, ``No, some of the
things.''
   Mondello's attorney, Stephen Murphy, asked Owens to accept the
verdicts that had been reached, but the judge denied the request.
The jurors did not specify their verdicts or the charges.
   ``There seems to be a very hard deadlock there,'' Murphy said.
   Jurors had been instructed to start with the most serious of the
charges, murder. Murphy said he believed the jury's note indicated
it had found Mondello innocent of murder charges and was deadlocked
on lesser charges.
   ``If they had already convicted him of (the murder charges) then
there'd be no sense deliberating any further on any of the
others,'' he said.
   Both juries reheard testimony from trial witnesses Saturday
afternoon.
   Prosecutors say Mondello organized a mob of bat-wielding whites
that surrounded Hawkins and three black companions when they came
into Bensonhurst to look at a used car.
   Fama allegedly stepped from the mob and fatally shot Hawkins in
the chest with a .32-caliber automatic.
   Shortly after 6 p.m. Saturday, the Fama jury asked to have
Sunday off so they could sleep late then go bowling and see a movie.
   ``We understand this would be at our own expense. ... There's a
bowling alley near the motel,'' the jury said in a note to the
judge.
   The judge said he would allow them to sleep late Sunday, but
said they would have to resume their deliberations.
   Both juries are sequestered.
   Saturday's demonstration began with a march by about 500 people
from the intersection where Hawkins died.
   Local residents shouted ``Not guilty, not guilty!'' as the
marchers went by. ``Justice for Yusuf!'' countered the marchers.
   The atmosphere was tense, but the march was orderly and without
major incident. More than 200 police in riot gear walked with the
demonstrators.
   Later, about half the marchers took buses to the courthouse,
where they stood outside and chanted: ``What do we want? Justice!
When do we want it? Now!''
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, a community activist who organized the
march, calmed the crowd as members surged against police
barricades, declaring through a bullhorn: ``This is a dignified,
nonviolent march.''
   Sharpton then accompanied Hawkins' parents, Moses Stewart and
Diane Hawkins, to a fourth-floor courtroom to await the verdicts.

<HEAD>Exxon Cleanup Plan To Take Region's Archaeology Into Account</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Coast Guard approval of Exxon Corp.'s
final plan for cleaning up the Valdez oil spill includes a
requirement that the company protect sites that may have been
inhabited 7,000 years ago.
   The work plan for Exxon's final cleanup was approved Friday by
Coast Guard Rear Adm. David Ciancaglini.
   The approval requires that Exxon develop a program to protect
cultural resources such as archaeological artifacts in areas
affected by the March 1989 spill of nearly 11 million gallons of
crude oil in Prince William Sound.
   Exxon already had been working on plans to protect cultural and
archaeological resources before Ciancaglini made it a provision of
his approval, said company spokesman Joe Tucker.
   ``The admiral just wanted it in writing,'' agreed Coast Guard
spokeswoman Gail Williams. ``We're talking the same program, but we
just want to make sure it's done.''
   Three teams of archaeologists in helicopters have been surveying
Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska, Charles Mobley, an
Anchorage archaeologist overseeing those aspects of the cleanup for
Exxon, said Saturday.
   Mobley said the best way to protect the area's cultural
resources would be to stay clear of it altogether, even after the
spill.
   Second best would be stationing archaeologists to watch over
Exxon crews cleaning up beaches, as was done last year, he said.
   Exxon, federal and state land managers and representatives of
Alaska native corporations are working to reach agreement on how
best to preserve the archeologically important sites to satisfy the
Coast Guard.
   ``The entire oil spill area has archaeology in it,'' Mobley said.
   He said the area, reaching west from Prince William Sound and
south to the Alaska Peninsula, represents 7,000 years of habitation
by natives.
   Authorities say lack of research funds has left the region
largely unexplored.
   But Mobley said one spinoff of the attempt to protect
archaeological artifacts has been an increase in archeological
knowledge.
   ``Before the oil spill archaeology program there were maybe 300
known sites'' of archeological importance in the region, Mobley
said. ``We've more than doubled that now, including sites of
historic interest.''
   The tanker Exxon Valdez wrecked on a chartered reef on March 24,
1989, spewing North Slope crude in the nation's largest oil spill.
The spill coated hundreds of miles of shoreline and killed hundreds
of otters and thousands of birds and other animals.
   The tanker's skipper, Joseph Hazelwood, was convicted in March
of a misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil into state
waters, but was acquitted of more serious charges.
   Exxon and its Exxon Shipping Co. are charged with two federal
felonies and two misdemeanors in the spill. The trial in Anchorage
on charges that include allowing an incompetent crew to operate the
Exxon Valdez was postponed indefinitely last Sunday.

   The National Legislature on
Saturday ordered prosecutors to investigate alleged corruption
involving hundreds of millions of dollars during three military
governments that ruled between 1963 and 1980.
   The inquiry will involve the governments of Gens. Oswaldo Lopez
Arellano, Juan Alberto Melgar Castro and Policarpo Paz Garcia.
   The unanimous decision followed a report by opposition Liberal
Party member Gloria Mejia de Jalil on the bankruptcy of of the
National Investment Corp., a state credit institution founded in
1974 that folded this year.
   Mejia de Jalil alleged that military leaders, businessmen,
politicians and bankers used their influence to get unsecured loans
to buy other businesses that went into fraudulent bankruptcy, with
the owners not paying the debts but keeping the money.
   ``A long line of corrupt officials, in complicity with a small
circle of businessmen and military leaders, made use of the
national sovereignty after building debts of $300 million ... debts
they didn't pay and which they doubled through accumulated
interest,'' she said.
   She presented a stack of documents she described as ``clear
evidence of what I have stated publicly today.''
   Lopez Arellano, now the principal stockholder in an aviation
company, toppled President Ramon Villeda Morales in a 1963 coup and
stayed until Melgar Castro in turn ousted him in a coup in 1975.
   The armed forces chiefs of staff threw Melgar Castro out and
replaced him with Paz Garcia, who ordered legislative and
presidential elections in 1979 and 1980.
   The assembly put no time limit on the investigation.
   The administration of Roberto Suazo Cordova, a rural doctor
elected president in November of 1980, also is being investigated
in connection with $320,000 in funds reported missing.

   Fire struck a residential motel
Saturday, killing one elderly man and injuring three people,
authorities said.
   The midafternoon blaze at the two-story Lombardy Inn motel was
confined to two or three rooms and quickly contained by
firefighters, said police Sgt. Jim Mazer.
   The 66-unit motel had alarms but no sprinklers, Mazer said.
   The Lombardy is in an area of aging hotels and motels in Miami
Beach on historic Collins Avenue. It is 20 blocks north of the
well-known Fontainebleau Hilton and 40 blocks from the start of the
Art Deco district.
   It is also 40 blocks north of the Fontana Hotel, where an April
6 blaze killed nine people and left 100 others homeless.
   The elderly man killed in Saturday's fire was not immediately
identified. He apparently was overcome by smoke in his second-floor
apartment above the room where the fire was believed to have
started, Mazer said.
   Fire and police officials were still investigating the cause,
Mazer said.
   A 50-year-old man and a 77-year-old woman were in stable
condition at St. Francis Hospital, where they were being treated
for smoke inhalation, a nursing supervisor said. Another man, whose
age was not known, was in good condition at Jackson Memorial
Hospital in Miami, a supervisor said.
   Mazer said more than 40 apartments in the motel, occupied by
both young families and elderly residents, were evacuated.
   Officials did not plan to allow anyone to return Saturday
because of smoke damage and the investigation, he said.
   ``People will be allowed in to get their personal possessions
and valuables, but they won't be allowed to stay,'' he said. ``The
Red Cross is arranging emergency shelter.''
   The cause of last month's Fontana Hotel fire has never been
determined despite an investigation by more than 60 firefighters
and arson experts and interviews with more than 250 people.
   However, officials said lives could have been saved if the
Fontana had had sprinklers in each room. A Florida law requiring
hotels and motels to install them is scheduled to go into effect
Oct. 1, 1991.

<HEAD>Chile Signs Agreement with U.S. to Pay Compensation on Letelier
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chilean official said Saturday that his
government reached agreement with the United States to pay
compensation for the 1976 killing of a Chilean opposition figure
and a U.S. associate in Washington.
   The ``agreement in principle'' came Friday in a meeting between
Chilean and U.S. officials in Washington, said acting Interior
Minister Belisario Velasco.
   He gave few details on the agreement.
   Velasco said the payments would go to the families of Orlando
Letelier, a former Chilean foreign minister who fled to the United
States following a 1973 right-wing military coup, and Ronni
Moffitt, an aide to Letelier who also was killed when their car was
bombed in Washington.
   ``In the next few days, a complete announcement with details
will be made,'' said Velasco in an interview. He said the matter
must now be taken to President Patricio Aylwin, a civilian who
replaced Gen. Augusto Pinochet in March.
   Pinochet led the 1973 overthrow of elected civilian President
Salvador Allende, and his military government had blocked efforts
by U.S. courts and the government to seek compensation in the
killings.
   Velasco said the meeting in Washington was between Deputy
Foreign Minister Edmundo Vargas, Chile's ambassador to the United
States, Patricio Silva, and three U.S. officials _ Assistant
Secretary of State Bernard Aronson, Abraham Sofaer, the State
Department's legal adviser, and Charles Gillespie, the U.S.
ambassador to Chile.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Dillen said: ``I
can't confirm the agreement by the Chileans, but their deputy
foreign minister has been in town discussing bilaterial issues with
us and also meeting with the (Organization of American States).
   ``As of yesterday, what we were saying was that we're optimistic
our discussions would result in a satisfactory resolution to the
case.''
   The agreement was not expected to affect criminal cases in the
United States against former officials of Pinochet's secret police
indicted in the killings.
   Aylwin, who defeated a Pinochet-backed candidate in elections to
replace the military government, has promised full cooperation with
U.S. officials in the case.
   In Chile, the issue is seen as a key battle between Aylwin and
Pinochet, who remains as army commander and has promised to block
human rights investigations of the military.
   Letelier served as Chile's ambassador to Washington and was
foreign minister during the Allende government. In exile following
the 1973 coup, he became a severe critic of Pinochet's rule.
   At the time of the Sept. 21, 1976, Letelier and Ms. Moffitt were
working for the Institute for Policy Studies.

<HEAD>Italian Police Seize Parts for Alleged Iraqi `Super Gun'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>

   Italian authorites said Saturday they had seized
more than 90 tons of components believed to be parts for a huge gun
Iraq is allegedly trying to build.
   Italy's paramilitary police, the carabinieri, confiscated parts
and documents during raids in Terni, Naples, Rome and Brescia,
officials said.
   Authorities said at a news conference Saturday they believed the
Italian-made parts were for the rear portion of a giant artillery
piece. They said the weapon would be capable of firing projectiles
hundreds of miles, including nuclear or chemical warheads.
   Documents seized Friday along with the components indicate that
the parts were for oil field equipment ordered by Iraq's Ministry
of Industry.
   Italian law prohibits the sale or shipment of arms to Iraq.
   On April 12, British customs officer seized eight giant tubes
earmarked for shipment to Iraq. Military experts said they could be
used as the barrel of a giant gun.
   British customs officers have said the tubes built could be
assembled to make a 131-foot-long gun barrel with a 39-inch bore.
   Iraq has said the parts were for a petrochemical project and
denied it is building a ``super gun.''
   On April 20, Greek authorities confiscated some 30 tons of metal
tubing believed to be another component of the gun. Italian police
said Saturday that the metal tubing seized in Greece had been
shipped earlier through the port of Brindisi in Italy.
   The police on Friday confiscated 15 tons of components at a
foundry in Terni, 75 tons in containers being loaded at the port in
Naples, a ton and a half on a truck in Brescia.
   Many of the documents were seized during a search of a house in
Rome, officials said.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said Terni prosecutor Adriano
Rosellini and deputy prosecutor Carlo Maria Zampi are interrogating
the Italian officials of the foundry to determine if they knew the
purpose and destination of the components.
   Police said they have not yet made any arrests.
   The agency said Italian investigators are in constant contact
with other European police agencies in an attempt to determine if
Iraq has succeeded in importing other parts of the weapon.

   Award-winning novelist Walker Percy was
remembered Saturday as a man whose books were full of his faith and
charm.
   ``Walker has helped us show that the Word is in the words we
speak and write,'' Archbishop Francis Schulte told hundreds of
people who gathered at St. Joseph's Abbey in this southeast
Louisiana city for Percy's funeral Mass.
   Percy, whose books dealt with modern malaise in the New South
and the tenuous, often comic, search for human connection, died
Thursday of cancer. He was 73.
   The dozen priests who celebrated the Mass together included
former New Orleans Archbishop Phillip N. Hannan and the Rev.
Patrick Samway, who presented the Catholic Book Club's prestigious
Campion Award to Percy in 1986 and is working on Percy's biography.
   ``Walker Percy was a writer. He was, of course, many other
things: father, grandfather, Catholic, conversationalist, Saints
fan, golfer,'' the Rev. Tom Clancy, former president of WWL-TV in
New Orleans, said in his eulogy.
   ``But most of his energy was devoted to writing,'' Clancy said.
``In many ways his writings remind us of parables. Sometimes it was
hard to get his point. But for all their subtlety, his stories were
powerful and moving. Like Jesus, Walker loved humor and irony.''
   Clancy remembered the author of the 1962 National Book
Award-winner, ``The Moviegoer,'' as well as ``The Thanatos
Syndrome,'' ``Love in the Ruins'' and other works as a man who was
both stubborn and charming.
   ``He has probably already charmed his way into heaven,'' said
Clancy. ``He was a hard man to say `No' to.''
   Percy, who converted to Catholicism in early adulthood, always
played down the role of the church in his work, but Clancy said
Percy's books are deeply Christian.
   Percy was buried in a small cemetery set aside for the abbey's
Benedictine monks and for members of their confraternity, a lay
group which works closely with the abbey.
   Archbishop Hannan recalled Percy as someone who was gracious
even when it was hard for him _ for instance, when Hannan persuaded
Pope John Paul II to name him as the only American on the
Pontifical Council for Culture.
   Accepting the nomination meant that Percy had to go to Rome,
dress formally and give a speech, all things he disliked, Hannan
recalled.
   Although he never met Percy, Steve Kanaga flew from San Diego,
for the funeral. ``I'm just a fan,'' said Kanaga. He said he had
written once to Percy, and gotten a letter back.
   He said Percy's books affected him deeply. ``They're so true,''
he said.
   ``It was like Percy to have an open funeral,'' said Harry
Middleton, a senior editor with Time-Life Magazines who got to know
Percy when he reviewed books for the New Orleans weekly ``Figaro.''
   ``Walker used to hang out there. We were a bunch of nobodies,
and he loved us,'' said Middleton, who now lives in Birmingham, Ala.
   He said Percy helped him move up and had encouraged him to write
books. ``I didn't think I could write books, but he assured me I
could. Now I'm on my third one,'' he said.

   A British trawler and a 275,000-ton
Liberian-registered oil tanker collided Saturday in the English
Channel and an estimated 1,000 tons of oil spilled into the sea,
the government said.
   The spill threatened some of Britain's best holiday beaches.
   The Brixham Coast Guard said the tanker Rosebay was on its way
from the Persian Gulf to the Swedish port of port of Brofjorden
with its cargo of oil when the collision occurred about 14 miles
off the southern coast of England. No injuries were reported.
   The coast guard said the trawler, the English-registered Dionne
Marie, arrived safely at the port of Kingswear, about 10 miles
northeast of Start Point, Devon.
   The tanker was still at the scene of the collision with its crew
on board. Authorities said it might need repairs to continue its
voyage.
   Six Dakota aircraft operated by the Department of Transport's
Marine Pollution Control Unit sprayed the oil with dispersal
detergent for nearly four hours, the department said.
   A reconnaissance plane was to fly over on Sunday to see if more
spraying was needed.
   A Department of Transport spokesman said the tanker's master had
reported losing about 1,000 tons _ or about 294,000 gallons _ of
oil. The officer on the tanker was able to halt the spillage by
tranferring the remaining oil to another tank.

   Military authorities have released 127
military personnel detained in connection with an attempt to oust
Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, newspapers reported Saturday.
   They quoted an army bulletin as saying another 200 soldiers
still are being interrogated about the attempted coup April 22,
which was led by middle-ranking officers angered by Moslem
domination of politics in Africa's most populous country.
   Military authorities also released newspaper editor Chris Okojie
on Friday, but four other journalists still are being held for
reports on the failed coup that offended President Babangida and
his military government.
   Okojie was detained April 30 after his Vanguard newspaper
published a cartoon showing several men glumly listening to radio
reports that the coup had failed.
   Two newspapers shut down after the attempted takeover, Punch and
the Lagos News, remain closed and guarded by armed soldiers.
   Suspected coup plotters are being interrogated by a panel headed
by an unidentified army brigadier. It will recommend who should
stand trial for treason before a military tribunal.
   Several civilians are among those held, but it was not known how
many. The government has accused a millionaire businessman and
other civilian accomplices of financing the coup in a bid to grab
power.
   In the northern city of Kaduna, authorities appealed for calm at
a meeting with Christian and Moslem leaders after two days of
demonstrations by Christian clergymen and their followers.
   The Christians are protesting the detentions of two lay leaders
of the Christian Association of Nigeria, who were arrested after
they published pamphlets accusing Babangida and his aides of
stealing millions of dollars from state coffers.
   The pamphlets also accused the government of plotting to make
Islam the official religion of Nigeria, a nation of 100 million
people with a slight majority of Moslems.
   Government sources have said the pamphlets were inflammatory and
aimed at inciting hatred of Moslems at a time when officials were
trying to ensure that there was no religious strife in the wake of
the coup attempt.

<TEXT>
   Babe, the Asian elephant whose calf was
stillborn in an emergency Caesarean section last month, died
Saturday, said a Burnet Park Zoo official.
   The cause of death was unknown, said Bob Geraci, spokesman for
Onondaga County Parks, which operates the zoo.
   Geraci said the 36-year-old, 7,700-pound Babe died at 1:39 p.m.
with veterinarians in attendance.
   ``They let her lay down all on her own. She gave a sigh and then
she died,'' Geraci said.
   Babe's body was to be moved to the Cornell School of Veterinary
Medicine in Ithaca for an autopsy, Geraci said.
   Babe underwent an emergency Caesarean section April 23 in a
failed attempt to save her unborn calf. Experts said the 266-pound
bull calf died from trauma when it could not position itself
properly in the uterus.
   After the surgery, Babe's condition deteriorated and she was
kept alive with intravenous doses of dextrose and amino acids.
   On Friday, a team of experts had dismissed calls to have Babe
humanely killed, saying she did not appear to be in pain.
   The zoo's veterinarian, Carolee Wallace, said Babe appeared
stable, not critical, and had shown strength and a desire to live.
   The zoo world closely watched Babe's 22-month pregnancy because
of the rarity of births among Asian elephants in captivity. The
endangered species numbers less than 45,000 in the wild, and only
62 have been born in captivity.
   Babe would have been the oldest first-time elephant mother to
give birth in captivity.

   A former police officer who carried the only
child survivor from the burning headquarters of the radical group
MOVE five years ago said Saturday that memories of the day still
haunt him.
   ``I did not want to kill anybody. I did not want to get killed.
... I can look everyone in the face, eye-to-eye and say, `I did my
best out there. I regret what happened,''' said James Berghaier.
   Berghaier, a 17-year member of the city police force, spoke at a
forum on public policy and human relations relating to the violent
May 13, 1985, confrontation between MOVE and police.
   After MOVE refused to leave a fortified rowhouse, police sprayed
the home with bullets, then dropped a bomb on the roof.
   The ensuing fire rapidly spread through the neighborhood,
destroying 61 homes, displacing an estimated 270 residents and
killing six MOVE adults and five children.
   Berghaier said he thinks some people believe the police officers
on duty during the daylong confrontation do not feel remorse for
those dead or for the residents whose homes were destroyed.
``That's not true,'' he said.
   The former officer said he suffered bouts of depression after
the incident and decided recently to talk about it publicly to
insure the situation does not occur again.
   Berghaier carried 13-year-old Michael Moses Ward, then known as
Birdie Africa, to waiting rescue crews after the child and the only
adult survivor, Ramona Africa, fled to an alley behind the
flame-engulfed MOVE compound.
   Ramona Africa was convicted of riot and conspiracy charges in
the incident. She is serving a 16-month to seven-year prison term.
   Ward, 18, lives with his father in a Philadelphia suburb. The
boy's mother was a MOVE member who died in the confrontation.
   Berghaier, who works for a janitorial service, said he would
like his 15-year-old son to meet Michael Ward.
   The day of the MOVE confrontation was his son's birthday,
Berghaier said.
   ``When I saw Michael that day, I saw my own son,'' he said.
   There have been no charges in the incident except those against
Ramona Africa. An 11th-hour attempt by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,
to get a federal grand jury to reopen the case before the statute
of limitations on civil rights violations expired at midnight
Saturday has failed.
   MOVE spokeswoman Alberta Africa, who also spoke during the
forum, said the group never believed anything would come of
Spector's efforts.
   ``These are the same people involved in the same government that
was involved'' May 13, she said. ``We are not naive to think they
would do anything.''
   She said MOVE continues to seek the release of members serving
prison terms in a 1978 MOVE clash with police, which was at the
root of the May 13 conflict.
   Nine MOVE members were convicted of third-degree murder,
attempted murder and assault charges stemming from the 1978
gunfight, which left one police officer dead and seven others
injured.

<HEAD>U.S. Officials Ignore Reports of Drug-Trafficking by Afghan
Guerrillas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reports of drug trafficking by U.S.-backed
Afghan guerillas, including the mujaheddin, have been ignored by
American officials for several years, according to a published
report.
   The Washington Post said in its Sunday editions that unnamed
U.S. officials have received repeated first-hand accounts of heroin
smuggling by guerrillas under the command of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar
but decided against further investigation.
   ``I have absolutely no comment on that,'' said State Department
spokesman Mark Dillen when asked about the report Saturday night.
   ``These are stories that we will have to more formally respond
to later,'' Dillen added.
   Hekmatyar is an Afghan guerrilla commander with close ties to
Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence or military intelligence
agency. The ISI has funneled tens of millions of U.S. weapons to
Hekmatyar, according to the report.
   Afghan sources told U.S. officials the ISI cooperates with
heroin production and commanders led by Hekmatyar run heroin and
morphine production laboratories in southwestern Pakistan, the Post
reported.
   The heroin is then smuggled from Pakistan through Iran to
Turkey, the Balkans and Europe, the Afghans told the newspaper.
   The Bush administration has acknowledged that individual
mujaheddin commmanders may have condoned heroin opium production
but has refused comment on invovlement by Hekmatyar, who served in
the Afghan Interim Government, or the Pakistani military.
   The sources told the Post U.S. concerns about the Soviet
presence in the region and maintaining good relations with Pakistan
took precedence over drug-fighting efforts there.
   ``There has been very little debate'' on the issue, one source
told the newspaper.
   ``It has been terribly frustrating for the Drug Enfocement
Administration and others to weave narcotics matters more closely
into general policy'' in Afghanistan, said a senior U.S. diplomat.

<HEAD>Report: Hostage Terry Waite Alive and Well</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A published report on Sunday quoted a Lebanese
official as saying Terry Waite, an Anglican envoy missing in
Lebanon, is alive and well after more than three years as a hostage.
   The Mail on Sunday, a conservative British weekly, reported that
Waite is held in isolation by his kidnappers in the southern
suburbs of Beirut, according to its source, Akram Shehayeb.
   Shehayeb, spokesman for the Druse religious sect and an aide of
Druse leader Walid Jumblatt, was quoted as saying Waite is held
alone in superior surroundings because he is believed to be the
most important of the hostages.
   He was quoted as saying that Waite was physically well.
   The newspaper said Shehayeb, who was interviewed in Lebanon, is
in regular contact with the Iranian-inspired Hezbollah, or Party of
God and receives information at secret meetings and in coded
telephone calls.
   Hezbollah is regarded as an an umbrella organization for
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremist groups believed holding Waite
and other British and U.S. captives.
   The Druse spokesman was quoted as saying he spoke out because of
intense speculation about Waite after the recent release of two
American hostages, Robert Polhill and Frank Reed.
   ``Terry Waite is special to us. He came here on a humanitarian
mission, he was entrusted into our care, and he became our friend.
We have never given up trying to secure his release,'' Shehayeb was
quoted as saying.
   ``The Druse provided bodyguards for Waite and suffered
embarrassment for having allowed him to meet Hezbollah members
unaccompanied,'' The Mail on Sunday recalled.
   John Lyttle, public affairs adviser to the Archbishop of
Canterbury, the Most Rev. Robert Runcie, said: ``It is very
encouraging to know that the Druse believe Terry Waite is alive.''
   Waite is one of 16 Westerners still missing in Lebanon,
including three other Britons and six Americans. The longest held
is Terry Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Waite will be 51 on May 31. He helped to gain freedom for seven
Britons in Iran and Libya and three Americans in Lebanon before
returning to Beirut on his fifth mission Jan. 12, 1987, to try to
free others at Runcie's request.
   Waite, a tall, bulky, bearded man, was last seen by journalists
eight days later, on Jan. 20.
   The Mail on Sunday said other sources besides Shehayeb,
including cabbies in west Beirut, have reported seeing a man
resembling Waite on the balcony of an apartment block in the city.

<HEAD>Dutch Woman Hospitalized After Four-Year Chernobyl `Phobia'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANGEBOOM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 24-year-old woman has been
hospitalized after years of living under a plastic sheet and eating
only canned food out of fear of radiation from the Chernobyl
nuclear accident, police said Saturday.
   The woman spent at least two years wrapped in the sheet and left
her couch in the family home only to go to the bathroom, according
to National Police spokesman Arie van Turnhout.
   The Dutch woman was hospitalized last month with an inflamed
bladder after her parents contacted a doctor, said Van Turhout. He
said police began an investigation into the case only last week
after hearing of the case on the ``village grapevine.''
   The woman, who was not identified, suffered from severe
malnutrition and cramped joints, Van Turnhout said.
   An investigation found out the woman hadn't washed and had
refused to eat anything but canned goods since the April 30, 1986,
explosion of the Soviet nuclear power plant, Van Turnhout told The
Associated Press.
   Her parents had been told to humor their daughter until her fear
of being contaminated subsided, he said, but did not disclose who
gave the advice.
   ``It's just a miserable psychosocial case,'' he said, adding the
entire family from this southwestern Dutch village would be
undergoing therapy.
   Shortly after the Chernobyl accident, the Dutch government
briefly banned the sale of spinach and ordered the stabling of all
Dutch cattle as the cloud of radioactive fallout swept west from
the Soviet Ukraine.
   There were similar measures in several Western European
countries.
   According to official Soviet figures, 31 people were killed in
the explosion and fire, although a Soviet newspaper has speculated
the death toll could be as high as 250.

<DATELINE>CUAUTITLAN, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II declared Saturday
that the Mexican government should not consider the Roman Catholic
church a constitutional enemy, but rather an ally in the fight for
a more moral society.
   ``In a state of law, the full and effective recognition of
religious freedom should be the fruit and guarantee of civil
liberties,'' John Paul told Mexico's bishops in his strongest call
yet for legal recognition of the church.
   Despite being overwhelmingly Catholic, Mexico has harsh
restrictions on church activity that date to 1859.
   The church was for many years considered a reactionary force by
the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, but the rules,
which include bans on a church role in education and participation
in political life, have been winked at in recent years.
   ``A theme that certainly concerns us, as pastors of the church
in Mexico, is the present civil legislation about religious
material,'' the pope said.
   ``The church in Mexico wants to be considered and treated not as
something strange, nor as an enemy that must be confronted and
fought, but as an ally of all that is good, noble and beautiful,''
John Paul said.
   He made his remarks in an address dedicating a new headquarters
for the Roman Catholic Episcopal Conference of Mexico in this
industrial suburb 15 miles north of Mexico City.
   The pope said the church could help the Mexican government by
strengthening family life and giving young people _ the majority of
the population _ deeper moral values.
   John Paul also expressed ``profound satisfaction for the climate
of greater understanding'' with the government, illustrated by
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's recent naming of a personal
envoy to the Vatican.
   The move was seen as a step toward re-establishing diplomatic
relations broken in 1926.
   John Paul also reviewed for the bishops many of the themes that
he had already touched on during his stay in Mexico. He said the
bankruptcy of communism showed the futility of building a society
without God, but he also criticized capitalism for its materialism.
   He said family life should be strengthened with faith, attacked
artificial birth control and praised the bishops' work in dealing
with workers who migrate to ``El Norte'' _ the United States _
``full of illusions about making progress that corresponds to their
own expectations.''
   Later, the Polish-born pope attacked the mixing of Marxism and
Catholicism in so-called ``liberation theology'' before both the
bishops and in a later address to an audience of 10,000 priests,
nuns, seminarians and students at Christopher Columbus College, a
Catholic instituion in Mexico City.
   Referring to the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, he
said it was ``incomprehensible that some sons of the church in
these lands (Mexico) persist in presenting as viable models whose
disaster is obvious in other parts of the world.''
   In a final address to a gathering of 1,500 members of Mexico's
intellectual and cultural community at the National Library, the
pontiff took up the theme again, saying that while communism had
been discredited, the culture of materialism in the West has not
yet ``assured a civilization that dignifies man.''
   Earlier in the day, during a visit to the central Mexican
farming region of Zacatecas, the pope expressed sympathy for the
hundreds of thousands of workers who migrate to the United States
each year.
   ``I want to remember also those who, for different
circumstances, have had to emigrate from this land, obliged to seek
their living elsewhere,'' the pontiff told a flag-waving crowd of
over 200,000 spread across a rocky, red-clay mountainside.
   ``The Lord also suffered the injustice of having to abandon his
land.''
   John Paul spoke in a region of north-central Mexico once known
for silver mines but now dominated by farms and grinding poverty.
In recent years the state of Zacatecas has become one of the
centers of illegal migration to the United States.
   The pope told hundreds of thousands of people gathered for a
Mass on a rocky, red-clay mountainside outside Zacatecas that
manual work had dignity.
   He denounced exploitation and said workers needed ``adequate
forms of association to defend your rights,'' referring to unions.
   The pope was scheduled to leave Mexico Sunday morning, stopping
briefly on the Caribbean island of Curacao before reaching Rome on
Monday.
   It was John Paul's 47th trip outside Italy since becoming pope
and his 10th pilgrimage to Latin America.

   Car bombs on Saturday ripped through two
malls packed with last-minute Mother's Day shoppers, killing at
least 19 people and injuring 143, the Health Ministry said.
   Late Saturday, another car bomb exploded outside a crowded
restaurant in the southern city of Cali, killing six people and
wounding at least 20, the Caracol radio network reported. It gave
no further details.
   No one claimed immediate responsibility for any of the bombings,
but the RCN radio network quoted a police colonel as saying
authorities believed the bombs in the capital were the work of drug
traffickers. The government has blamed the traffickers for dozens
of bombings that have killed more than 200 people since August.
   A Health Ministry statement said 19 people were killed in the
Bogota bombings and at least 13 of the 143 injured were in critical
condition in local hospitals.
   Hundreds of policemen and soldiers swarmed into the area. The
Defense Ministry, in a communique, said it had ordered the police
and soldiers to search for more bombs and to try to find the people
who set the two bombs.
   Sirens of ambulances and fire trucks and the screams of people
could be heard in live radio reports from the scene. The injured
were taken to five hospitals and a Red Cross station, which were
issuing radio appeals for blood donations.
   RCN said the bombs went off within minutes of one another at
about 4:15 p.m. One was set at the Niza shopping center in northern
Bogota, and the other at the Cafam shopping center in the city's
northwest.
   The two shopping centers were packed with people making last
minute purchases for Mother's Day on Sunday, RCN said in a report.
   At the Cafam shopping center, many of the casualties appeared to
be aboard a crowded bus that was passing by, RCN said. The radio
quoted a police explosives expert as saying the bomb was made from
about 220 pounds of dyanmite.
   RCN radio network reported that four children, including a
4-year-old boy and a 7-year-old girl, were among the 13 dead found
there.
   The bomb at the Niza shopping center, in an upper-class
neighborhood, destroyed at least 41 cars and 200 homes and
apartments were damaged, police Col. Jose Camelo said in an
interview with RCN. The radio said 16 stores were damaged by the
100-pound bomb, which left a three-foot-deep crater.
   The Niza bomb exploded in a parking lot across from the new
three-level mall. Glass from 20-foot-high plate-glass windows
turned to shrapnel, the radio report said.
   President Virgilio Barco announced a major government offensive
against the drug traffickers in August, hours after the killing of
presidential candidate Sen. Luis Carlos Galan.
   Since then, his administration has extradited 14 drug suspects,
killed Medellin cartel leader Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha in a
shootout, and confiscated hundreds of properties belonging to the
cocaine chieftains.

   The Air Force's stealth fighter, cloaked in
secrecy for years, dazzled about 50,000 people Saturday afternoon
at an air show.
   The $42.6 million fighter, designed to fly undetected by enemy
radar, opened the show by soaring over the Westmoreland County
Airport, about 35 miles southeast of Pittsburgh.
   ``It's nice to see your tax dollars at work,'' said John Sarver,
38.
   ``I'd paid for it,'' said William Alexander Jr., 65. ``I wanted
to see what I'm paying for.''
   The dark-colored aircraft passed over the crowd, banked to the
right, circled over nearby St. Vincent College, then returned to
the airport's main runway with it landing lights on.
   It dropped to about 500 feet above the main runway, engines
screaming, before climbing and circling once again. The fighter,
known as an F-117A, repeated the maneuver before disappearing into
an overcast sky southwest of the airport.
   Air Force officials said the appearance of the aircraft
contributed to a near-record, one-day attendance.
   The fighter was flown from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.
Stealth fighters are scheduled to appear at several air shows this
summer, including Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, Langley and
McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey, said Capt. Kevin Baggett,
spokesman for the Air Force Tactical Air Command at Langley.
   The F-117A costs more than $100 million a copy, according to a
recent report by the General Accounting Office. The Air Force gave
a figure of $42.6 million _ the so-called fly-away cost of one
plane, without counting development costs for the program.

   Results of a government household survey released
Friday suggest the number of Dallas County residents infected with
the AIDS virus is lower than health officials had estimated.
   The random in-person survey last fall, which required residents
to undergo an AIDS test, showed that 0.4 percent _ or about 4,000
county residents _ tested positive for the virus.
   The survey, first requested by President Reagan in 1987, was to
be a blueprint for a possible national survey of adults carrying
the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS.
   After a small survey in Pennsylvania, the national Centers for
Disease Control asked Dallas County to be the final test for the
national survey.
   Previously, local and federal health officials had estimated the
number of people infected with AIDS in Dallas County at 5,600 to
16,000, based on trends in AIDS cases.
   Taking into account residents excluded from the survey, such as
institutionalized people, the number of infected persons is 7,500,
at the most, officials said. The study was conducted on 1,446
composing a representative sample of the county's population,
officials said.

   Steve Friedman, the brash former ``Today''
producer who later bombed with a TV version of USA Today newspaper,
is rejoining NBC as the new executive producer of ``NBC Nightly
News,'' NBC said Friday.
   The move, which portends a new look and direction for the
program anchored by Tom Brokaw, comes at a time when the broadcast
is slumping in the ratings, alternating with the ``CBS Evening
News'' in third place.
   Friedman helped ``Today'' become first in the ratings before he
left NBC in 1987.
   The New York Times quoted one unidentified NBC executive as
saying the appointment signaled that former ``Today'' co-host Jane
Pauley would soon become co-anchor of the newscast with Brokaw. The
executive predicted Ms. Pauley's addition to the broadcast would be
gradual, with no definitive move until the fall, Saturday's Times
reported.
   NBC News president Michael G. Gartner told The Times that adding
Ms. Pauley to the newscast was ``not on the table today'' and ``not
part of the reason Steve was brought in.'' He added: ``I'm not
saying it will never happen. Who knows?''
   Friedman will succeed Bill Wheatley, executive producer of ``NBC
Nightly News'' for five years. Gartner issued a statement praising
Wheatley but saying he thinks ``it's time to take the broadcast in
a different direction.'' Wheatley will remain at NBC News.
   In a brief interview, Brokaw called Wheatley ``one of the good
guys,'' a tireless worker and ``a great friend and colleague. I'm
going to miss him.''
   Friedman said he will start work the first week in June. That
also is when NBC affiliates will have their annual convention.
   His return to NBC will mark his third time working with Brokaw.
The two were colleagues in the early 1970s at NBC-owned KNBC-TV in
Burbank, where Brokaw was an anchorman. Friedman began his NBC
career there as a newswriter.
   Later, Friedman was executive producer of ``Today'' when Brokaw
was its co-host. The former left NBC in mid-1987 to join GTG, a new
company formed by the Gannett Co. and former NBC chairman Grant
Tinker.
   Friedman created for GTG a TV version of the USA Today
newspaper. ``USA Today on TV'' cost $40 million to start up. It
premiered in a blaze of publicity in September 1988 on 156
stations, with four anchors, short stories, a fast pace and a busy
assortment of high-tech graphics. It was thoroughly panned by
critics.
   Its ratings fell despite format changes and it went off the air
on Jan. 8. Friedman, who had been president of GTG's New York
branch, quit the company last May.
   The NBC newscast he now will take over often was first in
ratings the year he left the network. But in the just-ended season
of 1989-90, it was third, averaging a 9.9 rating.

   President Bush's ``Open Skies'' proposal to
lessen East-West tensions through aerial surveillance is snagged in
negotiations, and the State Department is blaming the Soviet Union
for the setback.
   In a statement Friday that confirmed reports from Budapest, the
site of the treaty talks, the department said several key issues
were in dispute.
   These include the territory to be overflown by unarmed aircraft
and the number of such surveillance flights.
   Today was the tentative deadline for signing the treaty.

   The Bush administration is resisting Soviet
offers to cut tactical nuclear weapons at sea, but the Navy's top
admiral says such negotiations might be useful if the Soviets
accepted certain preconditions.
   The United States has long opposed arms control measures that
would limit the number of Navy ships or tactical weapons. And Adm.
Carlisle A.H. Trost, soon to retire as chief of naval operations,
told Congress on Friday he saw little prospect for change.
   Yet Trost said that under certain circumstances it might benefit
the United States to negotiate the elimination of short-range naval
nuclear arms. Arms in this category include anti-ship missiles,
depth bombs and torpedoes.
   ``Yes, it could be in our interests'' if the Soviets were
willing to also eliminate sea- and land-based aircraft assigned to
their naval fleets and if adequate measures were taken to guard
against cheating, Trost told the Senate Armed Services subcommittee
on projection forces.

   The government threatened to fire
about 60,000 public employees who held sit-in strikes to demand
that their wages be doubled and that a law protecting labor rights
be restored.
   Also Friday, President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro ordered a
sweeping review of property seizures during 10 years of Sandinista
rule.
   About 2,000 public workers, shouting ``Power to the People,''
broke through a cordon of 100 policemen late Friday and took over a
plaza outside the presidential offices.
   ``Workers on strike should retun to their jobs,'' said Labor
Minister Francisco Rosales. ``Otherwise we will declare the strike
illegal and apply the labor law and those who do not show up will
be fired.''

   Battling a proliferation of racial and ethnic
tensions, Mayor David Dinkins called on New Yorkers to fight
prejudice where they live, and promised to do whatever is necessary
to quell public disturbances.
   Dinkins, who had been criticized for not acting forcefully
enough against a rash of race-related incidents, gave a half-hour
speech Friday night carried live by several local television and
radio stations.
   New York's first black mayor said the nation's largest city has
many problems, including expensive housing, crack and AIDS
epidemics, and a faltering economy.
   ``Unfortunately, some small-minded people prey upon these
pressures, spreading a message not of unity but of division ... I
challenge all of the people of this city to reject these calls to
bigotry,'' he said.

   A homeless woman seized her 12-year-old daughter
from a hospital where she was being treated for heart disease
because the woman believes blood transfusions would damage the
child's soul, authorities said.
   State officials issued public pleas Friday to Caroline Winfield,
35, asking her to return her daughter, Kimberly, so the child can
receive the medical attention she needs.
   The mother, who lost custody of her three children last month
because she was homeless, opposes heart surgery because she is a
Jehovah's Witness and feels a blood transfusion would endanger her
daughter's soul, said Dave Schneidman, a spokesman for the Illinois
Department of Children and Family Services.
   He said the child needed open-heart surgery to survive. ``The
prognosis is she has anywhere from a week to a month to live
without the surgery,'' he said.

   Conservation groups say Interior Secretary
Manuel Lujan's call for re-examining protection of endangered
species is ``outrageous'' and recalls the Reagan administration's
pro-development policies toward the environment.
   Lujan sparked the criticism Friday after he was quoted as saying
that Congress should look at the federal law protecting endangered
species with an eye toward increasing its flexibility.
   Lujan cited as one example of how the Endangered Species Act
causes problems the controversy in Arizona over construction of a
$200 million telescope on a mountain inhabited by rare and
endangered red squirrels.
   ``Do we have to save every subspecies?'' Lujan suggested in an
interview Thursday with the Denver Post. ``The red squirrel is the
best example. Nobody's told me the difference between a red
squirrel, a black one or a brown one.''
