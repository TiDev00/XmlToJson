   A man who admitted he tried to hijack an
America West jet to Cuba was convicted Wednesday by a federal jury
of air piracy and assaulting a flight attendant.
   Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Gonzalez, who claimed he was insane at the
time of the Jan. 16 hijacking, faces a maximum sentence of life in
prison and a $500,000 fine.
   U.S. District Judge James Nowlin said sentencing would be in 30
to 45 days. Bennie Ray, the lawyer for Gonzalez-Gonzalez, said he
likely would appeal the verdict.
   Gonzalez-Gonzalez, 39, testified Tuesday that he held a flight
attendant hostage with an earphone cord around her neck. When the
cord broke he gripped her around the neck with his arm, he
testified.
   He blamed his actions on prolonged cocaine use.
   ``I never intended to hurt that girl,'' Gonzalez-Gonzalez said.
   In his testimony, he also described fashioning a fake bomb from
a toothpaste container and flashlight.
   The plane, which took off from Houston bound for Las Vegas,
landed in Austin after the pilot told Gonzalez-Gonzalez he had to
refuel. Gonzalez-Gonzalez was apprehended by Austin police.
   Gonzalez-Gonzalez, who was born in Havana, said there was ``no
way'' he would have tried to hijack the plane to Cuba had he not
been using cocaine.
   Psychiatrists testified that Gonzalez-Gonzalez was legally sane
during the hijacking.

   With the gentle turning of earth in a
daisy-lined flower bed, ground was broken Wednesday for a memorial
to 21 people killed by a gunman who stormed a fast-food restaurant
six years ago.
   The ceremony was attended by about 100 people, including
relatives and friends of the dead. The groundbreaking came on the
sixth anniversary of the rampage.
   ``Jesus said unless the grain of wheat falls to the grain of
earth and dies, it remains just a grain of wheat. But if it dies,
it produces much fruit,'' the Rev. John Blethen told the crowd.
   ``On this site six years ago, 21 grains of wheat fell to the
earth and died. Today we break ground to build a permanent monument
in memory of these fallen ones,'' he said.
   Three mothers of shooting victims and several other relatives
pushed shovels into the ground where the McDonald's restaurant once
stood.
   James Oliver Huberty, a 41-year-old unemployed security guard,
was slain by a police sharpshooter after bursting into the
restaurant July 18, 1984. He was armed with an Uzi 9mm
semiautomatic rifle, a shotgun, a 9mm Browning semiautomatic pistol
and carried a bag full of ammunition.
   Huberty's victims ranged in age from 8 months to 74 years.
   The site is now the home of a satellite campus of Southwestern
Community College.
   McDonald's Corp. razed the restaurant soon after the tragedy and
donated the land near the U.S.-Mexico border to the city of San
Diego, which governs San Ysidro.
   Catellus Development, a San Francisco-area company, donated
$15,000 of the $50,000 cost of the memorial, which is to include 21
hexagonal granite pillars from 1 to 6 feet tall, representing
Huberty's victims.
   ``I feel both sadness and happiness today,'' said Adelina
Hernandez, whose 10-year-old son, Omar, was killed when Huberty
sprayed the crowded restaurant with gunfire.
   ``This helps all the families and future generations. I was very
depressed to see this place empty, to see no monument. It's a big
difference, to have a monument. But the sadness is still there,''
she said.
   The memorial, to be completed by the end of this year, also is
funded through donations from businesses, students and faculty at
the college.

   A barge leaving an Exxon refinery struck a
docked barge Wednesday and spilled about 37,000 gallons of oil,
closing the spill-plagued Arthur Kill waterway, officials said.
   At least half the oil escaped into the kill before booms could
be set up, said Rick Fulton, a spokesman for the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection.
   The barge Interstate 53, owned by Maritrans Operating Partners
LP of Philadelphia, was emptied by workers at the Bayway refinery
to stop the leaking, said Howard Hile, the company's vice president
for operations and contingency management.
   Hile said the 2.1-million-gallon capacity barge was nearly full
when it struck the other vessel, but only a 200,000-gallon tank in
the Interstate 53 ruptured. Coast Guard Petty Officer Jodi
Hoffmaster said the second barge did not spring a leak.
   Hile said the company is trying to determine how the accident
happened.
   Exxon officials did not return telephone calls.
   There were no injuries, said Linden police Lt. Calvin Kleinhans.
   Fulton said booms had been placed around the Port of Elizabeth
as well as the tanker, the refinery, the Rahway River, Prall's
Island and Prall's Creek.
   The spill is the fifth major spill this year in the Arthur Kill,
which separates New Jersey and New York's Staten Island, and the
nearby Kill Van Kull.
   A Coast Guard report on the Jan. 1 pipeline break that spilled
567,000 gallons of oil into the Arthurt Kill found that Exxon Co.
employees routinely ignored procedures for preventing oil spills at
the plant's Bayway refinery.
   The report also concluded the pipeline probably had been dented
before the spill by dredging equipment, which weakened it and
eventually caused the rupture, Coast Guard Cmdr. Philip Chase said
Wednesday.
   The final report on the spill, the worst in New York Harbor
history, indicated refinery workers ignored alarms that oil was
leaking from the pipeline, said Chase, executive officer of the
Coast Guard Marine Inspection Office in New York.
   ``Contrary to Exxon service manuals, the practice was to reset
the system when leak alarms shut it down because of a history of
false alarms,'' said Chase. That contributed to the spill's spread
because it delayed authorities' response, he said.

   Soviet citizens are more willing than
often perceived to accept a free-market economy, according to a
survey released Wednesday by a team of Soviet and American
researchers.
   A Yale University economist, Robert Shiller, joined with a
Soviet economist and a Soviet sociologist to conduct a telephone
survey of about 360 people each in New York and Moscow.
   The results, released at a National Bureau of Economic Research
conference in Cambridge, Mass., indicate some surprising
similarities in economic attitudes, Shiller said.
   ``The Soviets repeatedly answered in line with Americans on
questions about fairness in regards to free markets,'' he said.
   ``The theory that the Soviet public is not ready to accept a
free market economy because it is not `fair' is nowhere indicated
in our survey. Yet this supposed obstacle is often cited by Soviet
academicians and government officials as a reason not to initiate
such a system,'' he said.
   Shiller, with Soviet scientists Maxim Boycko and Vladimir
Korobov, asked their subjects 36 questions aimed at probing
attitudes on capitalist institutions.
   Americans and Soviets gave almost identical answers to questions
relating to such things as saving a portion of their annual
incomes, obtaining direct compensation for their work and accepting
price fluctuations in the market caused by supply and demand.
   Soviets appeared slightly more supportive of grassroots
enterprises than the Americans.
   Thirty-seven percent of the Soviets said they would invest in a
risky business started by a group of friends, compared with 33
percent of the Americans surveyed.
   The survey, conducted in May in both cities, found the Americans
and the Soviets differed widely on their willingness to risk
unemployment.
   Seventy-six percent of the Americans said they would trade job
security for a big raise and 49 percent of the Soviets said they
would do the same.
   Five percent of the Soviets polled said they would charge a
friend interest on a loan, compared with 27 percent of the
Americans who said they would.
   Soviets were more suspicious of the wealthy.
   About 54 percent of the Moscow residents surveyed agreed that
``people who try to make a lot of money will often turn out to be
not very honest,'' compared with 37 percent of the Americans.

   Prison officials don't have to help an inmate
father a child by artifical insemination, a federal appeals court
ruled.
   In the first case of its kind, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals on Tuesday turned down inmate Steven Goodwin's request for
an order requiring officials to help him impregnate his wife,
Sabrina.
   The three-judge appellate panel said that granting the request
would be too burdensome and costly for Bureau of Prisons officials
and could prompt female prisoners to demand that they be allowed to
have babies behind bars.
   ``According to the bureau's artificial insemination policy
statement, if the bureau were forced to allow male prisoners to
procreate, whatever the means, it would have to confer a
corresponding benefit to its female prisoners,'' said Judge Frank
J. Magill.
   Magill, of Fargo, N.D., was joined by Senior U.S. District Judge
William Hanson of Des Moines, Iowa. In a dissenting opinion, Judge
Theodore McMillian of St. Louis said requests such as Goodwin's
should be decided case by case.
   Goodwin's attorney, Ronald L. Kuby, denounced the ruling as ``a
perversion of the Constitution.''
   Goodwin, 34, is an inmate at the federal prison in Springfield,
Mo. He wants prison officials to provide a container for his semen,
which would be rushed to his 30-year-old wife.
   Goodwin, formerly of Cedar Hill, is eligible for parole on Sept.
2, 1991. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced in 1986 to 14 years in
prison for his role in a drug distribution ring based in Jefferson
County.
   In arguments before the appeals court in January, Kuby said Mrs.
Sabrena worried that waiting longer to get pregnant would increase
the chance that her child could have a birth defect.

<TEXT>
   Police have arrested a man who has pleaded
guilty to setting fire to Poland's holiest Orthodox shrine, the
17th-century wooden church of St. Mary in Grabarka, a newspaper
reported.
   The daily Gazeta Wyborcza said Tuesday that the man, identified
only as Jan S. and now serving an eight-year prison term, was on a
five-day leave from prison when he set the fire on July 12.
   It said Jan S. was arrested Monday and pleaded guilty to the
charges. He told police he hoped to steal a gold cross inside, but
could not break in and decided in his anger to burn the church, the
report said.
   The church, about 75 miles east of Warsaw, and all its contents,
including precious historical icons, were destroyed.
   The Orthodox Church in overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Poland
claims more than 800,000 followers, many of whom are ethnic
Byelorussians who live in Poland's eastern provinces.
   According to a report in the government daily Rzeczpospolita
over the weekend, the Grabarka church was the sixth Orthodox church
burned in Poland in the last five years.
   Keston College, a British organization that monitors the
observance of religious freedoms, has also reported a number of
recent arson attacks against Orthodox property in Poland.
   The Keston College report noted fears in Poland's Orthodox
community that the attacks could reflect religious intolerance and
national chauvinism.

<HEAD>16 Years After Turks Invaded, Cyprus Accord Still Distant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European barriers may be tumbling down
but there's little hope of ending the 16-year division of Cyprus.
   The Mediterranean island's division dates from a July 20, 1974
Turkish invasion, whose anniversary comes amid an upsurge in
political tension between the Turkish and Greek communities.
   ``The support of all concerned is now necessary if we're to
prevent the situation from worsening,'' U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar told the Security Council this month.
   Catherine Lalumiere, secretary-general of the Council of Europe,
said the situation was ``a gangrene threatening Europe.''
   After viewing the concrete wall that splits Nicosia, the
capital, into Turkish and Greek sectors, she declared early this
month: ``It's inconceivable that in today's Europe such a barrier
still exists.''
   The Turks invaded Cyprus five days after a coup by militant
right-wing Greek Cypriots that was intended to unite the island
with Greece. The president, Archbishop Makarios, had to flee for
his life.
   By mid-August, 40,000 Turkish troops had occupied the northern
third of the island 40 miles off Turkey's southern coast.
   Some 200,000 Greek Cypriots fled south. About 40,000 Turkish
Cypriots moved north.
   Ethnic tension in the country had increased after Cyprus gained
its independence from Britain in 1960 following a five-year
campaign by guerrillas who supported union with Greece.
   For the 120,000 Turkish Cypriots, who make up 18 percent of the
island's population, the invasion anniversary is a time to
celebrate their ``liberation'' from Greek Cypriot domination.
   They declared their northern enclave a breakaway republic in
1983, but only Turkey recognizes it.
   In the south, many of the 580,000 Greek Cypriots plan
demonstrations against the occupation of the north, branded illegal
by the United Nations. Some refugees are agitating to return to
their former homes in the north.
   In recent years, thousands have attempted to cross the 120-mile
dividing ``Green Line'' that runs from Famagusta in the southeast
to Morphou Bay in the northwest. That touched off clashes with
Turkish Cypriot troops.
   The line is patrolled by a 2,120-man U.N. peacekeeping force
originally deployed in Cyprus in 1964 to quell inter-communal
bloodletting in which hundreds of people were killed.
   U.N.-sponsored talks between President George Vassiliou, the
Greek Cypriot leader, and Rauf Denktash, president of the breakaway
Turkish Cypriot state, broke down in March.
   Denktash demanded recognition of the Turkish Cypriots' right to
self-determination. Vassiliou said that was tantamount to
recognizing the breakaway state.
   Communal rivalry sharpened earlier this month when Vassiliou's
government applied for membership of the European Community for the
whole island.
   An infuriated Denktash declared the application invalid without
Turs Golf Courses.
   ``I just didn't make any stupid mistakes today,'' said Williams,
who will be a freshman next fall at New Mexico State University.
``I hit the ball and made every putt under 6 feet. The key was that
I didn't make any bad mistakes. I stayed out of trouble.''
   Notah Ryan Begay III, 17, Albuquerque, N.M., was one stroke back
with a 4-under-par-68. Begay won the 13-14 age division in the 1987
tournament.
   Lisa Kiggens, from Bakersfield, Calif., took the lead Tuesday in
the girl's division with a 1-under-par-71. Kim Marshall of Bermuda
was second with a par-72.
   A total of 770 junior golfers in four age groups _ 10-and-under,
11-12, 13-14 and 15-17 _ are participating in the 23rd annual
event. The record number of players participating in the tournament
come from 36 states and 33 foreign nations. Twelve past champions
are entered in the contest.
   ``This is the biggest field we've ever had,'' said tournament
director Norrie West. ``We're positive there isn't a bigger
tournament _ pro or amateur _ anywhere in the world. We're trying
to figure out how to limit it next year.''

   Two strong aftershocks struck central
Luzon island early Wednesday and more bodies were found two days
after a devastating earthquake. The death toll topped 300.
   Officials said the aftershocks, which occurred before dawn,
could have caused further damage and may complicate rescue efforts
already hampered by lack of equipment and training to cope with a
natural disaster of such magnitude.
   In Golden, Colo., the U.S. Geological Service measured the
aftershocks at 6.3 and 5.8 on the Richter scale. Monday's
earthquake registered 7.7.
   Erlinda Amin of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and
Seismology said the aftershocks struck at 3:07 a.m. and 6:15 a.m.
The shocks were felt in Manila's suburbs and in Baguio, the
mountain resort most severely damaged by Monday's quake.
   The initial temblor cut off communications with Baguio, 110
miles to the north, and there were no new reports of damage there
Wednesday following the latest aftershocks. Officials predicted
aftershocks may persist two more weeks.
   President Corazon Aquino left by plane Wednesday morning for
Baguio to inspect the damage.
   On Wednesday, the Office of Civil Defense reported 309 people
were confirmed dead in the earthquake and hundreds more remained
trapped in the rubble. Nearly 700 were injured.
   Four more bodies also were recovered Wednesday in Cabanatuan
from the rubble of the collapsed Philippine Christian College.
   The U.S. military joined the search for survivors Tuesday. Japan
and other countries also sent aid and medical teams.
   Filipino reporters who visited areas of major damage said there
was little sign of a coordinated, comprehensive government rescue
operation.
   Most rescuers were private citizens organized by local civic
groups and lacked training to deal with the emergency. Reporters
also said rescuers lacked heavy equipment such as cranes to lift
debris.
   In Baguio, local Rep. Raul Roco, assistant House majority
leader, stood helpless in front of the Nevada Hotel after shouting
to his wife who was trapped inside.
   Frustrated, Roco urged cadets of the Philippine Military
Academy, located there, to help him rescue his wife.
   ``Sir, we want to help you but what can we do? How can we, with
our bare hands?'' a cadet responded.
   The military said it was unable to bring cranes, tractors and
other heavy equipment to Baguio because of landslides triggered by
the earthquake. The landslides also trapped hundreds of people in
passenger buses, trucks and private cars.
   Filipino officials and reporters who visited the city said
hundreds of the city's 120,000 residents have fled their homes and
pitched tents in the city's park or are living in their cars.
   Eighty-two people are known to have been killed in Baguio and
hundreds are feared missing.
   Food and fuel supplies in the city were reportedly running low.
Col. Bienvenido Liclican, spokesman for the military rescue team,
said the search for survivors had to be suspended at night because
there is no electricity to power searchlights.
   He appealed over Manila radio stations for tools, blood plasma,
medicine and doctors to care for the injured.
   Manila radio and television stations appealed to listeners to
contribute to a fund for the victims of the quake.
   ``This is developing into a national tragedy,'' said a reporter
for the ABS-CBN television network.
   Mrs. Aquino declared a state of emergency throughout central
Luzon island, which suffered the greatest damage during the
earthquake, the strongest temblor to strike the Philippines in 14
years.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, who visited Baguio on Tuesday,
said 50 people may have been killed in the Hyatt Terraces Baguio
hotel when the front section of the inner atrium collapsed.
   ``I never thought in my entire life that I could see such
destruction,'' said Ed Pangilinan, spokesman for the Defense
Department who accompanied Ramos to the city.
   A U.S. Air Force engineering team joined the search for up to
1,000 people believed trapped under 27 buildings in Baguio.
   About 1,500 Americans live in Baguio but there were no reports
of deaths or injuries among them, U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley
Schrager said.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman David A. Denny said
several Filipino employees of the U.S. Agency for International
Development were among those missing.
   In Dagupan, where 20 people were killed, cars were swallowed up
by fissures in the earth.
   The United States dispatched a Naval engineering team and a
field hospital to Cabanatuan, where at least 53 people were killed
when the six-story Philippine Christian College collapsed.
   Rescuers had pulled 179 people from the rubble as of late
Tuesday, and Mayor Honorato Perez said about 30 were still feared
trapped. Many of the victims were children.
   U.S. officials said the teams brought heavy equipment to
Cabanatuan to remove tons of debris.
   Also Tuesday, Japan sent doctors, nurses and $180,000 worth of
relief supplies to help the earthquake victims.
   Canada, Thailand, Switzerland and South Korea also offered
assistance.
   Monday's quake was the worst to strike the Philippines since
1976, when a quake measuring 7.8 killed 8,000 people.

   J. Edgar Hoover was hard on criminals
but mushy-soft over his dogs, say the folks at a local pet cemetery.
   Seven of the late FBI director's beloved pooches are buried
under the shady oaks of Aspin Hill Memorial Park in this Washington
suburb. The weathered headstone on the Hoover plot pays tribute to
the memory of one canine companion named ``Spee De Bozo.''
   The inscription reads: ``Our Best Friend.''
   Spee De Bozo departed for doggie heaven in May 1934. A couple of
months later, Hoover's private mourning dissolved in public triumph
over the news that federal agents had gunned down his nemesis,
gangster John Dillinger, outside a Chicago movie theater.
   Hoover was never known to have visited his dogs' gravesite,
although an FBI telephone operator whose dog was buried at Aspin
Hill would check on the Hoover plot occasionally to make sure it
was well-kept.
   While making life difficult for bank robbers, antiwar
protesters, civil rights activists, suspected subversives and
personal political enemies, Hoover was disarmed by the tail-wagging
entreaties of ``G-Boy'' and ``Cindy,'' his last two Cairn terriers.
   ``Naturally, they are spoiled,'' he once confessed. ``They boss
me around.''
   A few months before he died in 1972, Hoover sent a letter on FBI
stationery to the pet cemetery's owner, S. Alfred Nash. ``My dogs
have brought me much pleasure, relaxation and companionship, each
in his own way,'' wrote Hoover, a lifelong bachelor.
   Hoover's will included a request that Clyde Tolson, his chief
deputy and trusted confidant, find a suitable home for the two
terriers.
   The Hoover dogs are not the only celebrities at the 70-year-old
Aspin Hill cemetery, which is owned by People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, a non-profit animal rights organization.
   It is the final resting place of ``Jiggs,'' the canine mascot of
the old ``Our Gang'' comedies who died in 1938, and ``Timmie,'' a
cat who lived in Washington's National Press Building and counted
senators, judges and movie stars among his friends.
   Timmie's owner, the late newspaper correspondent Bascom N.
Timmons, buried 129 stray animals at Aspin Hill, including 80 cats.
   Most of the 35,000 to 40,000 animals interred at Aspin Hill are
dogs and cats with such names as ``Darling Skippy,'' ``Our
Fluffy,'' ``Tinker Bell,'' ``Lollipop,'' ``Sir Toby Belch,''
``Queenie'' and ``Mustard _ Mommie's Baby Boy'' inscribed on their
tombstones.
   There also are 17 horses and hundreds of pet rabbits, monkeys,
parrots, turkeys, goats, hamsters, guinea pigs, frogs, goldfish,
turtles and snakes. And there are graves of 13 human beings who
chose to be buried close to their pets. The ashes of one couple are
interred in front of a mausoleum containing the tomb of their
Boston bull terrier, Mickey.
   On the grounds is a shelter for live animals and a small
``funeral home'' where former owner Nash once offered
non-denominational prayers for the deceased and solace to their
owners. ``A little bit of Protestant, a little bit of Jewish, a
little bit of Catholic, mixed together with the religion thrown
out,'' he said.
   The current manager, London-born Gary Baverstock, 25, reads a
simple, all-purpose eulogy as part of a funeral package that
averages $400 to $600 for everything, including a small pine box
lined with ruffled white taffeta.
   James Thompson has been chief groundskeeper, gravedigger and
mortician at Aspin Hill for the past 22 years, and he loves his job.
   ``Animals give you true love,'' he said, ``and I feel sorry to
see people lose their pets after they've given so much love and
caring. What hurts most is when a little child breaks down and
cries. I get a little choked up myself.''

<HEAD>Mandate for HUD Investigation Broadened</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The special prosecutor investigating former
Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. is now authorized to probe
consultants and developers who dealt with the scandal-ridden
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Arlin M. Adams, the independent counsel appointed March 1 to
investigate Pierce's administration o the Moderate Rehabilitation
Program, was given the expanded authority Tuesday by a special
court that oversees his work.
   The court issued an order empowering Adams to investigate
Pierce's handling of two other programs from 1984 through 1988 _
Urban Development Action Grants, or UDAG, and the Secretary's
Discretionary Fund for technical assistance and special projects.
   Besides Pierce and other HUD officials, Adams was given
authority to ``fully investigate and prosecute all government
officials, or other persons and entities'' who dealt with those
programs.
   The order was issued by the independent counsel division of the
U.S. Court of Appeals, which appoints and supervises the work of
special prosecutors.
   The court appointed Adams on March 1 to investigate allegations
that Pierce and top aides illegally showed political favoritism in
the award of rent subsidies and tax benefits available under the
Moderate Rehabilitation Program.
   The expanded mandate not only adds two other programs to the
prosecutor's agenda but authorizes him to investigate and prosecute
any beneficiaries of political favoritism from those HUD programs
from 1984 through 1988.
   The court's order means that Adams and his staff could spend
several years combing through records of the HUD programs for
evidence of improper lobbying, ethics law violations or conflict of
interest.
   The addition of the UDAG and discretionary fund to Adams'
mandate was sought May 25 by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who
referred allegations by former Deputy Assistant HUD Secretary
DuBois L. Gilliam.
   Gilliam testified before the House Government Operations housing
and employment subcommittee that politics played an important part
in the award of UDAG and discretionary grants.
   Gilliam, who is serving an 18-month prison term for manipulating
the award of a grant and accepting $8,000 in illegal gratuities,
testified that on a number of occasions Pierce ordered him to
intervene for politically connected developers.
   Pierce has denied any wrongdoing. But Gilliam testified that,
among other things, he was ordered to award a $5.6 million UDAG
grant to a Florida development because Pierce's former executive
assistant, Lance H. Wilson, was a private consultant for the
project.
   Gilliam testified that he was ordered to intervene for projects
in Nashville, Cleveland and Miami because they were supported by
influential Republicans.
   Gilliam is cooperating with Adams' investigation under a grant
of immunity from prosecution, according to sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   In its lengthy investigation, the House subcommittee heard
testimony from Republican consultants and lobbyists who helped
clients get HUD grants.
   These included James Watt, interior secretary in the Reagan
administration, and Paul Manafort, a top campaign strategist for
President Bush.
   Watt said he met with Pierce to help developers win $28 million
worth of Moderate Rehabilitation Program subsidies for a suburban
Baltimore project.
   Manafort, a partner in the political consulting firm of Black,
Manafort, Stone &amp; Kelly, acknowledged that he engaged in
``influence peddling'' and that his firm charged $326,000 to help
developers win HUD backing for a New Jersey project.

   The government's official poverty line
underestimates the number of Americans that actually live in
poverty, a report by two advocacy groups said today.
   Based on polls asking how much money people need to avoid
poverty, the groups concluded in a report that 45 million people
actually live in poverty in the United States _ more than the 32
million that fall beneath the federal poverty line.
   The report was based on four Gallup Polls of 3,511 people
between July and October of last year. It was released by the
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which studies policies
affecting the poor; and the Families USA Foundation, an advocacy
group for the elderly.
   Their report concluded that the nation's poor are more likely to
be white, older and better educated than it would appear using the
federal government's more conservative definition of poverty.
   It said there are 53 percent more poor whites, 88 percent more
elderly and 48 percent more higher educated people living in
poverty than government figures show.
   ``The government poverty line is based on an arbitrary, arcane
and outdated formula intended to serve the needs of bureaucrats and
politicians,'' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA.
   The groups said their polls asked how much weekly income each
respondent would set as a poverty line for a family of four. The
average income given by respondents was $15,017. The government's
official poverty line for a family of four, including two children,
is $12,092, based on 1988 figures, the groups said. There is a
separate lower poverty line for the elderly.
   The report said 13 percent of Americans are said to be poor by
the government's figures, but 18 percent are poor by the report's
figures.

<TEXT>
   Two 1970s arms control treaties signed during
the depths of the Cold War are finally coming before the Senate for
ratification, their importance overshadowed by rapidly improving
East-West relations.
   The two agreements _ the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the
1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty _ are finally on a fast
track for approval because of verification steps agreed to on June
1 by President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Opening a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the
treaties on Tuesday, Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said he
regretted the ``dawdling'' that held up what he termed ``modest
controls'' on nuclear testing.
   The treaties, which limit the size of nuclear weapons tests and
the use of nuclear charges for peaceful purposes, lag far behind
current arms control discussions that contemplate massive
reductions in each side's nuclear arsenals.
   Since they were signed, the treaties ran into delays first
during the Carter administration, which sought a more comprehensive
ban on nuclear testing, and then during the Reagan administration,
which had misgivings over U.S. ability to prevent Soviet cheating.
   Government witnesses suggested that the new verification
protocols agreed to by Bush and Gorbachev during their Washington
summit, allowing on-site monitoring by both sides, could be
important as a model for the more sweeping START agreement in the
final stages of negotiation.
   The protocols virtually ensure that the two treaties will be
approved for ratification by the Senate before the current session
of Congress ends this year.
   The TTB treaty places a limit of 150 kilotons on the size of
weapons tests and provides detailed standards for the tests to
ensure that explosions can be measured accurately. The PNET places
identical limits on nuclear blasts for peaceful purposes, such as
seismic exploration or excavation.
   When the PNET was negotiated, nuclear explosions were believed
to have potential for digging canals or building dams, but test
results have been disappointing and environmental concerns have
largely eclipsed the idea. Now the treaty is important mostly as a
way of ensuring that large weapons tests are not carried out under
the guise of peaceful explosions.
   The verification protocols came about because while both sides
had agreed to abide by the 150 kiloton limit, the United States
believed the Soviets had violated that ceiling as many as 24 times
and sought more accurate monitoring methods.
   The protocols provide what State Department negotiator C. Paul
Robinson called ``unprecedented on-site and in-country verification
measures'' that give each side the right to establish three seismic
monitoring stations in the other's territory.
   Soviet sites are in Newport, Wash.; Tulsa, Okla., and in the
South Dakota Black Hills. The U.S. monitoring sites are in the Ural
Mountains, near Moscow and in Siberia.
   Robinson said that while the U.S. goal remains the total
elimination of nuclear testing, it will be years before that can
become a reality.
   ``Testing supports nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons support a
peaceful world, a stable world,'' Robinson said. ``Until we find
another formula, we have to preserve that posture in the best way
we know how.''

   West Virginians can fight the war on
drugs by filling out a coupon under a state police program hailed
as the new wave in citizen crimefighting.
   But civil libertarians warned that the program _ under which
tips can be mailed or phoned in anonymously _ will create a society
in which people spy on each other.
   ``This kind of program will not make us drug-free. It will just
make us unfree,'' said Bob O'Brien, spokesman for the American
Civil Liberties Union.
   The statewide program announced Monday encourages residents to
fill out coupons giving the name and address of suspected drug
users or dealers, the address of suspicious activity or the license
plates of cars in suspected drug areas. The coupon includes a
toll-free number and the address of state police headquarters.
   The coupons will be available at state police offices and will
be carried by troopers in their cruisers, Trooper Ric Robinson
said. They will also be passed out at the state fair in August, he
said.
   ``It's the first time that it's been done in recent memory on a
statewide basis,'' said Severin Sorensen, deputy director of the
Chiefs of Police National Drug Task Force in Washington. ``It's a
new wave in terms of citizen involvement.''
   ``The postcard is an encouraging idea. I haven't heard of any
other state or local police handing out those,'' said Gerald
Arenberg, executive director of the National Association of Chiefs
of Police, which represents about 10,000 federal, state county and
local law enforcement agencies in the United States.
   The program was adapted from one started by a newspaper in Mingo
County. Authorities received nearly 700 replies after the
Williamson Daily News printed coupons on its own and invited people
to mail them to state police.
   Last month, federal, state and local authorities arrested 46
people in Mingo County as a result of the coupon tips. Wally
Warden, editor of the Williamson newspaper, said six people have
been convicted so far.
   Some of the newspaper coupons contained comments such as
``Enough is enough,'' ``God bless you and anyone else who is
stopping drugs'' and ``Yes! I've had enough of drugs floating
around.''
   State police blame drugs for an increase in violent crime.
Robinson said the number of murders in West Virginia rose to 121
last year from 93 in 1988, and armed robberies rose to 793 from 644.
   ``It's the wrong way to fight the drug war,'' O'Brien said the
idea. ``It creates a paranoid atmosphere, just the way it was in
Germany in the '30s and '40s when people were encouraged to spy on
their neighbors.''
   Robinson said residents will only get the ball rolling.
   ``We don't expect the public to do the investigations for us,''
he said. ``You supply us with the names, we'll do the
investigation.''
   Tipsters are not compensated, and disclosure of their name and
address is optional. O'Brien said that gives participants ``false
hope of anonymity.''
   ``If the state police issues a search warrant on the basis of
one of these coupons, then the person at trial has the right to
confront his accuser under the Sixth and 14th Amendments,'' O'Brien
said.
   Last year, newspapers in Clinton, Iowa, and Milford, Conn.,
started similar coupon campaigns asking readers to anonymously list
the names of anyone they suspect of using or selling drugs.
   Law enforcement agencies in Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas,
Kentucky, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas have contacted the
Williamson newspaper for information about the program, Warden said.

<HEAD>Man Says He Still Loves Actress He's Accused of Killing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The man accused of killing actress Rebecca
Schaeffer says he's sorry, but still loves her a year after she was
gunned down at her apartment building, a newspaper reported today.
   ``I really feel kind of guilty about all that's happened. My
feelings for her were uncontrollable,'' Robert John Bardo told The
Oregonian. ``I was a fan of hers and I may have carried it too
far.''
   Bardo spoke to the newspaper by telephone from the Los Angeles
County jail psychiatric ward. It marked the first time he has
spoken with reporters since his arrest last July.He has pleaded
innocent.
   The 20-year-old high school dropout from Tucson, Ariz., told the
newspaper his obsession with Schaeffer began in 1986 with a fan
letter after he saw her co-star in the television comedy ``My
Sister Sam.''
   Bardo said his infatuation with Schaeffer dominated his life.
   He videotaped every episode of ``My Sister Sam.'' He clipped and
kept photographs of her. He wrote countless fan letters. He
composed musical lyrics about a fantasy relationship.
   ``I loved her, and I still do,'' Bardo said.
   But he never met her.
   Schaeffer, 21, died of a gunshot wound to the chest after
answering the security door at the entrance to her apartment
building on July 18, 1989.
   For her parents, Danna and Benson Schaeffer of Portland, today
marks the date their family became the innocent victims of what
they call Bardo's ``sick fantasy.''
   A judge in Los Angeles has ordered Bardo to stand trial but
repeated motions by his attorneys have slowed the process. His next
court appearance is scheduled for Aug. 2, to determine whether the
prosecutor will be allowed to seek the death penalty.
   In the year since their daughter's death, the Schaeffers have
become active in campaigning against handguns and have lent their
support to legislation to protect addresses listed in official
records.
   Police and prosecutors say Bardo paid a Tucson private detective
$250 to find Schaeffer's address. When he arrived in Los Angeles,
they say, Bardo stalked the actress' neighborhood for nearly four
hours.
   They claim he rang her doorbell and stood to one side. When she
answered the door, he allegedly leaped out and shot her at
point-blank range. She died a short time later.
   The Schaeffers initially declined to participate in a story
involving an interview with Bardo and strongly objected to The
Oregonian's plans to publish the story. They eventually agreed to
be quoted, with strong reservations.
   ``He feels sorry about it?'' Danna Schaeffer asked. ``The
magnitude of the evil he committed against our family doesn't even
match up to those tepid remarks. I think his comments are utterly
meaningless. We don't even want to dignify his remarks with a
comment.''
   Bardo was arrested in Tucson the day after the shooting as he
ran in and out of traffic on an interstate highway.
   ``I thought I owed it to Rebecca to kill myself after what had
happened,'' Bardo said.
   Bardo would not answer when asked directly if he shot and killed
Schaeffer.
   ``I am sorry that's she's gone, but I can't say anything
directly about the case because that could be incriminating to
me,'' he said.
   Schaeffer's friends and family took out a full-page
advertisement Tuesday in the entertainment trade paper, Variety, to
commemorate the anniversary of her death.

   A nationwide poll released today indicates
that one of five Americans would like to see a ban on the use of
agricultural chemicals.
   Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation,
said the poll of 1,000 adults showed that ``the public is
reasonable on food safety issues'' and that only 21 percent favored
a ban on farm chemicals.
   Nearly 80 percent said farmers should reduce the use of
chemicals or continue at current levels.
   Kleckner said most of the survey results were encouraging, while
``some were disconcerting.'' For example, 79 percent of those
polled said they believed farmers are adopting new methods to
reduce chemical usage. But 73 percent thought farmers use more
chemicals than necessary to boost profits.
   ``This apparent contradiction, we believe, is due to the fact
that the public has heard about the progress farmers are making,''
the Farm Bureau president said. ``At the same time, the public is
susceptible to negative suggestions. If you ask people whether
something is wrong, they tend to say yes.''
   Also, Kleckner said, the public has some misconceptions about
modern agriculture. Half of those surveyed said most farmers don't
work and live on their farms.
   ``If the public is thinking about corporate farms, it's
mistaken,'' he said. ``Only 3 percent of all farms are owned by
corporations. If the public is thinking about absentee ownership,
it's wrong about that, too. The amount of farmland owned by
absentee owners totals about 36 percent of all acreage.''
   Kleckner also announced a new program to tell people about food
safety. Three-fourths of those surveyed said farmers should educate
consumers and speak out on food safety issues.
   The Farm Bureau's program _ ``Today's Farmers and Ranchers:
Professionals from the Ground Up'' _ will begin this summer at
state and county fairs, where members will speak with people about
farming and food safety.
   The survey was conducted for the federation by Market Facts
Inc., on June 22-24. Officials said it has a margin of error of
plus or minus 3.1 percent.

   Beneficiaries who don't get results when they
telephone Social Security's toll-free number may have to way a long
time before receiving a promised follow-up call from a local
office, congressional auditors say.
   In fact, a report by the General Accounting Office concluded
that Social Security failed to follow through on callbacks in 42
percent of one type of case. In other kinds of calls checked by the
congressional investigative agency, beneficiaries were called back
in as many as 97 percent of cases.
   ``It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Social
Security 800 (area code) system is not a working number, or at
least that it is not working very well,'' said Rep. Andy Jacobs
Jr., D-Ind., chairman of the House Ways and Means Social Security
subcommittee.
   Since last Oct. 1, a Social Security beneficiary has been unable
to call a local office of the agency with a question or problem.
Instead, the first call must be made to the toll-free number,
800-234-5772.
   Jacobs, whose subcommittee has voted to require Social Security
to bring back local phone service, said Tuesday that the GAO survey
indicates the new system is not delivering the promised higher
level of service.
   ``It's said that `access' is the goal of lobbyists,'' Jacobs
said. ``For Social Security participants, access to their local
offices should be more than just a goal _ it should be a handy
reality.''
   He said 800-number operators lack training and expertise to
answer non-routine calls. Although it is now far easier to get
through to the 800 number than it was earlier this year, Jacobs
said, a caller still will get a busy signal 35 percent of the time.
   Social Security Administration spokesman Frank Battistelli said
the agency had not been given a copy of the GAO report and, thus,
would not comment on the findings. He said, however, that at least
80 percent of problems or questions posed in calls to the 800
number are settled on the spot without the need of any callback or
referral to a field office.
   Even after repeated unsuccessful attempts to get back to a
caller, Social Security offices do not let a case ``slip through
the cracks,'' Battistelli said. ``We then send a letter asking the
caller to get back in touch with us.''
   Social Security expects to receive as many as 70 million calls
this year. GAO estimated that only about 5 percent require
referrals.
   GAO acknowledged the difficulty in trying to get back to a
caller. In carrying out its survey, the agency said, its workers
were unable to make contact in five tries with many of those who
had called the 800 number.

   A new round of tests found that drivers and
front-seat passengers of the 1990 Isuzu Trooper II and Ford Club
Wagon likely would suffer head injuries in a collision, the
government says.
   Head injuries are possible but the risk is less for drivers of
the 1990 Isuzu Amigo, Chevrolet S-10 Blazer, Chevrolet S-10 Pickup,
BMW 325i and Volkswagen Passat, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration said Tuesday.
   The agency tested the vehicles by driving them head-on into a
fixed barrier, creating the same conditions as a frontal collision
between two identical vehicles driving at 35 miles per hour. The
conditions also are equivalent to a car moving at 70 mph striking
an identical parked car.
   Test results apply only to occupants using seat belts and, in
certain cars, air bags. The tests are conducted using dummies that
represent an average-sized adult male.
   According to the NHTSA index, a score of 750 or lower means head
injury is unlikely; 750-1,250 means head injury is possible; and
anything higher means head injury is likely.
   A separate scale records the possibility of chest injury, which
is considered likely when the score tops 60.
   The lower the numbers, the lower the potential for injury. But
for purposes of comparison, vehicles have to be of the same type
and weigh within 500 pounds of each other.
   The Trooper, a multipurpose vehicle weighing 4,302 pounds, had a
score of 1,564 for the driver and 1,952 for the front-seat
passenger. The Club Wagon, weighing 5,710 pounds, scored 2,613 for
the driver and 1,896 for the passenger.
   Chest injury scores were 60 for the Trooper's driver and 64 for
the passenger. For the Club Wagon, the scores were 59 for the
driver and 49 for the passenger.
   Other results released this week include:
   _BMW 325i scored 1,036 in the head injury category for the
driver. Data was not available for the passenger. In the chest
injury category, the score was 56 for the driver and not available
for the passenger.
   _Passat. Head injury: driver score 1,182, passenger 604. Chest

   Marion Barry twice snorted cocaine at the
Democratic National Convention in 1988, one of his longtime friends
says as the prosecution prepares to rest its case against the mayor.
   ``Mayor Barry stopped by my hotel in Atlanta twice'' during the
July 1988 convention and ``we used cocaine'' both times, Doris
Crenshaw told the jury Tuesday in the fifth week of testimony at
the mayor's drug and perjury trial.
   Crenshaw testified she and Barry snorted or smoked the drug
``maybe 15 times'' over a five-year span ending last fall, at her
home in Washington and at five hotels around the city.
   Crenshaw, a former aide in the Carter White House, is the 10th
friend of Barry's to testify to alleged cocaine use by the mayor.
Two others said they saw him smoke marijuana.
   Barry led the District of Columbia's delegation to the 1988
Democratic convention.
   The prosecution's last witness, an FBI agent, was expected to
testify briefly today about telephone records involving the
so-called Ramada Inn episode, in which Barry repeatedly visited the
hotel room of Charles Lewis, now a convicted cocaine dealer. Lewis
testified that he and Barry smoked crack at the Ramada on four
occasions in December 1988.
   When the government rests its case, Barry's lawyers say they
intend to seek a judgment of acquittal, a routine move midway
through major criminal trials.
   Defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy said his motion will focus on
the conspiracy charge accusing the mayor of joining with friends to
possess cocaine and then covering it up from authorities.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson will rule on Mundy's
motion.
   In addition to conspiracy, Barry is accused of 10 misdemeanor
counts of cocaine possession and three felony counts of lying to a
federal grand jury.
   Mundy said the defense plans to present 12 to 14 witnesses and
that his case will last at least through Monday.
   He said he plans to delve into whether Lewis, who testified
against Barry, is receiving any reward money from the government.
Lewis and an FBI agent discussed the subject as soon as Lewis
agreed to cooperate with the government last year, the lawyer said.
   Earlier Tuesday, a longtime Barry friend, Bettye Smith,
testified that she started giving cocaine to the mayor in 1983 and
last provided it to him a week or two before his arrest Jan. 18 in
an FBI sting operation.
   Smith was brought to Washington in the custody of deputy U.S.
marshals after trying to avoid testifying. Suffering from stress,
she checked in last week to a psychiatric hospital in Chattanooga.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Hits Campaign Trail After Rough Domestic
Month</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, the Republicans' $60 million
money man, is back to campaigning after a month's absence _ but
what a month. It saw the president reverse his 1988 ``no new
taxes'' pledge and the savings and loan scandal move closer to his
doorstep.
   Those issues, along with new signs of sluggishness in the
economy, loom as overriding political issues today as the president
resumes his whirlwind fundraising efforts for Republican
candidates, after time off for Western power summits in London and
Houston.
   The president's first stop is California, where Republican Sen.
Pete Wilson is locked in a tight race for governor with Democrat
Dianne Feinstein.
   Bush's visit comes two days after McDonnell Douglas Corp. said
in Los Angeles it would eliminate as many as 17,000 jobs _ a side
effect of recent cuts in Pentagon spending that can't help Wilson's
candidacy.
   After attending the dedication of the Nixon Library in Yorba
Linda and a GOP fund-raiser in Anaheim, Bush will help boost GOP
candidacies in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. He returns to Washington
on Friday.
   Next week, he campaigns for Republican candidates in
Philadelphia and New York City.
   A former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Bush has
been a traveling cash register for GOP candidates. As of late June,
Bush had raised a record $58.8 million for Republican campaigns _
$25 million of it in 1989 and the rest this year.
   So far, about 40 political events are on the president's
schedule _ and the list keeps growing. ``You can call it
unprecedented,'' said White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
   Bush's fund-raising prowess may be phenomenal. But it's not
clear how well it can be translated into votes, especially in
bucking a well-established trend that sees parties occupying the
White House lose congressional seats during midterm elections.
   And, while a new Gallup poll shows Bush's acceptance level at an
enviable 63 percent, it is down sharply from the 80 percent level
that he enjoyed after last winter's Panama invasion.
   Many Republicans are nervous with Bush's abandonment of his ``no
new taxes'' pledge and with Democratic efforts to blame the S&amp;L
crisis on them _ particularly with the recent attention given the
role of Bush's son, Neil, in the collapse of a Denver savings and
loan.
   Ed Rollins, a leading GOP strategist, told a Republican meeting
in Chicago last week that it was the Democrats who ``sold out the
taxpayers'' on S&amp;Ls. He urged Republicans to regain the offensive
on both the S&amp;L and the tax issues.
   Even speechwriter Peggy Noonan, who put ``read my lips: no new
taxes'' on George Bush's tongue, had some fresh, but unsolicited,
advice for the president on that very subject.
   ``People are becoming newly re-sensitized to taxes. From New
Jersey to California, they're starting to get clobbered again,''
she said in Chicago last week.
   She suggested Bush might want to consider ``push(ing) away from
the bargaining table, stand up, acknowledge what's happening,
declare that an impasse has been reached and tell the Democrats:
I'm taking it to the people.''
   And, quoting former President Reagan, for whom she also wrote
speeches, Ms. Noonan added: ``Sometimes you only make progress in a
negotiation when you end it.''
   That seemed to be the ast thing on Bush's own mind when he told
magazine publishers Tuesday that ``the time for game playing is
over'' and that it would take both higher taxes and deeper spending
cuts to ease the federal deficit.
   Bush said he was prepared to take a campaign for a
deficit-cutting compromise to the public as soon as one can be
struck with the Democratic-controlled Congress.
   Bush's last political trip was in mid-June, before his sea
change on taxes. It was also before the Fourth of July
congressional recess, when many lawmakers went home and found that
voters were outraged that taxpayers were expected to foot the bill
for the collapse of the savings and loan industry.
   Senators returned to Washington _ and voted 99-1 to give grand
new powers to federal investigators and prosecutors to crack down
on S&amp;L crimes.
   Meanwhile, Bush planned to campaign on. And on. And on.
   ``I don't think that was ever in doubt,'' said B. Jay Cooper, a
spokesman for the Republican National Committee. ``It's the way the
man is. He's available to do anything and everything that makes
sense.''

<HEAD>Social Security Disability System Said Swamped</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Social Security disability system, already
overburdened, is soon to be swamped with at least 280,000 old cases
that must be reprocessed as the result of a court decision,
officials say.
   The Senate Special Committee on Aging heard administrators and
beneficiaries describe problems Tuesday with the Social Security
Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
program.
   In 1989, more than 4 million disabled people, their spouses and
children got benefits through SSDI, which requires that
beneficiaries not work. Its SSI counterpart, which had 3 million
disabled beneficiaries, is specifically targeted at low-income
people.
   But the system is in dire need of reform, said committee
Chairman David Pryor, D-Ark., and ranking Republican member John
Heinz, R-Pa.
   One of the biggest problems may be the impact on the system of a
ruling by the Supreme Court last February that voided a government
regulation that gave children seeking benefits less protection than
adults.
   The decision in the class-action case of Sullivan vs. Zebley
will force officials nationwide to re-evaluate more than 280,000
benefit denials going back to at least 1983.
   ``We currently lack the resources that we expect to be required
by the new Zebley workload,'' Pennsylvania state disability
administrator Howard Thorkelson told the aging committee.
   Deputy Social Security Commissioner Louis Enoff said the
administration is bracing for the added workload.
   ``As soon as can assess what the cost will be on Zebley, we will
be asking for additional monies,'' Enoff said. He said he could not
estimate how much that will be. Government lawyers are still
haggling with plaintiffs' attorneys over exactly how many cases
must be reviewed under the decision.
   The Social Security Administration is charged with the
``delicate balancing act'' of protecting scarce trust funds while
ensuring that the disabled swiftly receive benefits, Pryor, the
committee chairman, said. ``Sadly, (it) is failing on both ends.''
   At one end, Pryor said 60 percent of all initially denied cases
are reversed on appeal by administrative law judges, meaning
lengthy delays for beneficiaries.
   At the other, he said, Social Security has periodically missed
filing required Continued Disability Reviews, designed to stop
paying beneficiaries who have recovered from disabilities.
   In a telephone interview, spokesman Frank Battistelli said the
agency had slowed, but not stopped, the disability reviews because
of budget constraints.
   He said the agency could resume its former pace if it fully
receives its 1991 budget request of $800 million for the
state-based agencies that handle claims.
   Enoff defended the 60 percent reversal rate by the law judges,
saying that disability determinations are ``not an exact science.''
   Individuals' conditions change over time and ``different
outcomes at succeeding steps in the appeals process are inevitable
to some extent,'' Enoff said.
   Staff shortages have meant waits of two to six hours for the
people seeking disability interviews in the Jamaica District Office
in New York City, said claims representative Harry P. Behret.
   The Senate hearing featured the use of a live satellite feed so
that Rita Hartley, 63, could testify from her Fort Smith, Ark.,
home.
   With her dog barking in the background, she told the panel that
she almost starved to death while waiting several years for
approval of her disability benefits. She suffers from lupus,
arthritis and back problems.

<HEAD>Bennett Lashes at Democrats for Cutting Drug Prevention Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ever since William J. Bennett became President
Bush's top aide in the war on drugs last year, he has been
chastised by Democrats as too concerned with law enforcement,
uncaring about drug treatment and education.
   Bennett, who pushed huge spending hikes for both treatment and
education, says he is not going to take that any more, particularly
since the Democratic-run House Appropriations Committee slashed the
administration's demand-reduction proposal in the fiscal 1991
budget.
   The move was ``cheap, dishonest and sneaky,'' the national drug
policy director said Tuesday in an interview. ``Bill Bennett will
take no more guff from these guys on his commitment to the drug
war.''
   According to an analysis provided by Bennett's office, the $170
billion measure covering budgets for the Labor, Education and
Health and Human Services departments next year includes a $21
million increase in funds for drug demand reduction. However, the
administration wanted a $252 million boost.
   The spending measure received bipartisan approval from the
Appropriations Committee last Thursday, with no ``nays'' heard from
Republican members. It is expected to come before the full House
for a vote Thursday.
   ``The conventional rap on us is that we're too much for law
enforcement,'' Bennett said. ``For a year now, we have been flogged
for this. Now they cut our damned budget proposal on the demand
side. Who are these clowns?''
   Rep. Neal Smith, D-Iowa, who sits on the appropriations
subcommittee that drew up the drug budget, said Bennett is ``way
premature'' in complaining about money for fiscal 1991, which
begins Oct. 1.
   ``It's not unusual to have numbers vary a great deal from where
they start,'' Smith said, citing the numerous legislative
contortions appropriations bills go through before they become
reality.
   ``Up to this point, he's always gotten more money than he
requested,'' Smith said of Bennett. ``If it comes Sept. 30 and he
doesn't get more money than he requested, then I'll be surprised.''
   Smith said one problem with increasing the amounts for education
and treatment quickly is that some programs are not prepared to
handle the money.
   The analysis by Bennett's office breaks down the Bush proposals
and the Appropriations Committee's bill covering the drug demand
reduction programs:
   _The administration had sought a $100 million increase in the
drug portion of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health
Administration block grants, mostly for treatment, from $477.3
million to $577.3 million. The House bill provides for no increase
at all. Bennett's office said this will result ``in a cut below
current levels because it provides no inflation increase.''
   _Bush proposed increasing treatment improvement grants by $46
million to a total of $85.5 million; the House bill adds $10.4
million.
   _The administration sought to increase Office of Substance Abuse
Prevention community partnership grants by $52.2 million, for a
total of $101.7 million. But the House bill cuts that to a $10.5
million increase.
   _Bush proposed increasing by $54 million the Drug-free Schools
and Communities Program of block grants and related projects for a
new total of $593.3 million. The House bill cuts the request by
$54.3 million.
   The $170 billion Labor-Education-HHS measure passed by the
Appropriations Committee represents a $17.3 billion hike over 1990
spending. It is $4.2 billion larger than Bush had requested.
   ``This wasn't an attack of fiscal responsibility,'' Bennett
said. ``They want to spend lots of money, but not on drugs.''
   Some programs slated to get increased funds are aimed at the
same people as those helped by anti-drug programs, such as
compensatory education and student assistance for the
disadvantaged, said a congressional source who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   ``They can be called effective anti-drug-abuse programs,'' the
source said. ``They don't have to be labeled `drugs' in order to be
a drug program.''

   Poland says it is now satisfied that a united
Germany will make no claims on its territory, and concurrence by
the four World War II Allies virtually assures that the two
Germanys will be one by year's end.
   Foreign ministers from the seven countries decided Tuesday that
the Allies will pull out of Berlin and give up other occupational
powers held since 1945 once a reunified Germany signs a treaty
guaranteeing the current borders.
   ``We are very happy with the results,'' Polish Foreign Minister
Krzysztof Skubiszewski told reporters after Tuesday's talks. ``The
border has been confirmed.''
   The Polish diplomat's meeting with his counterparts from the two
German states and the United States, France, Britain and the Soviet
Union came a day after Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
cleared the last great remaining obstacle to German unity by
endorsing its membership in the NATO alliance.
   In Tuesday's talks, the Germans agreed to give up any claim to
territory absorbed by Poland at the end of World War II and to make
that commitment part of the new Germany's constitution.
   A treaty to be signed by the new Germany and Warsaw shortly
after unification will accept the border the Allies set in 1945
between Poland and what later became East Germany.
   The Bonn government also agreed on Tuesday to talks with Poland
this summer designed to assure Warsaw that its contracts with East
Germany will be fulfilled after unification.
   The talks could result in German assistance to Poland's shaky
economy. Gorbachev ended his public reservations about German
reunification after the Bonn government promised financial
assistance as well as a limit on the troop strength of the future
German military.
   ``All agree that a unified Germany will consist of the Federal
Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and Berlin _ no
more, no less,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker III told a joint
news conference held by the foreign ministers after their meeting.
   ``Today will go down in history as the day in which the Polish
border has been settled to the satisfaction of our Polish
friends,'' said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Tuesday's talks were held in an international conference center
yards from the Arch of Triumph, the Napoleonic monument under which
the troops of Nazi Germany marched in victory 50 years ago last
month.
   A senior U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said: ``Germany will give up any claim to land now held by Poland
and will state it has no territorial claim to any other nation's
land.''
   Poland, which lost 6 million people in World War II, had been
concerned that its powerful neighbor once again would start eying
Polish territory. About one-third of today's Poland was part of
pre-war Germany, awarded to the Poles to compensate for territories
annexed by the Soviet Union.
   The virtually simultaneous acts of German unification and
concluding a border treaty with Poland will be followed by full
German sovereignty, with the Americans, Soviets, British and French
giving up all occupational powers.
   Another result of the successful third round of the
``two-plus-four'' talks, to which Poland was added on the issue of
its borders, is the increased likelihood of a 35-nation summit in
Paris in November. However, the United States has insisted on
completion of a treaty beforehand to reduce U.S. and Soviet troops,
tanks and other non-nuclear weapons in Europe.
   Those talks are being held in Vienna between NATO and the Warsaw
Pact.
   On Monday, in the Soviet region of Stavropol, Gorbachev and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany agreed that the army of a
united Germany would be limited to 370,000 troops. The two Germanys
now have about 600,000 men under arms, with 480,000 in West Germany.
   The Soviet Union and West Germany also agreed to begin
negotiations on the full withdrawal of Soviet soldiers from what is
now East German territory. The 380,000 soldiers should be pulled
out in three to four years.
   West Germany _ the richest nation in Europe _ is expected to
increase trade with Moscow. It has already backed a $3 billion bank
loan to the Soviet Union and pushed its allies for a comprehensive
plan to bail out Gorbachev's crumbling economy.
   All-German elections are scheduled for Dec. 2.

<HEAD>DEA Says Drug Dealers Running Short</HEAD>

   The Drug Enforcement Administration says
``cautious optimism'' is appropriate in the war against cocaine as
traffickers face shortages nationwide, sometimes even asking
undercover agents to supply the drug.
   Cocaine prices are high, purity is down and trafficking
organizations seem to be in such disarray that coca growers in
South America can't get enough for their crops to make a living,
Ron Caffrey, the DEA's deputy assistant administrator for
operations, said Tuesday.
   However, Caffrey added to the Senate Judiciary Committee: ``We
have not deluded ourselves into thinking that the cocaine threat
has subsided. ... This could well be a temporary situation.''
   Committee Chairman Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., who shared with
Caffrey the belief that the news was worthy of ``cautious
optimism,'' also stressed the need to remain vigilant.
   ``In my view, we are entering the most critical phase of the war
on drugs, a phase in which some policymakers may suggest that we
declare victory and go home,'' Biden, D-Del., said. ``That would be
a tragic mistake in my opinion.''
   Caffrey reported some victories in the war on drugs.
   Cocaine prices have reached their highest level since mid-1985,
he said, even though they remain far below the $55,000-$65,000
price per kilogram (2.2 pounds) of 1982. In addition, purity levels
have dropped. The combination of high price and low purity
generally indicates a shortage.
   Outside the hearing room, Caffrey said, ``There's plenty of that
(cocaine) down in the source nations such as Colombia, but it's not
getting here for whatever reasons _ stockpiling, the seizures that
have been made.''
   Law enforcement efforts here and abroad have disrupted the major
cocaine cartels. The havoc wreaked on those organizations has left
many coca growers in Peru and Bolivia without buyers willing to pay
the $30 per 100 pounds of leaf that is their break-even point,
Caffrey said.
   Dramatic increases in wholesale prices were found in Los
Angeles, New York City and Houston. In the Texas city, the price
rose from a range of $11,000 to $21,000 per kilo last December to
$20,000 to $30,000 in June.
   Increases were less notable in Chicago _ where the low price
remained $19,000 and the high price increased from $25,000 to
$32,000 _ and Miami, where the price only inched up from $16,000 to
$22,000 in December to $17,500 to $23,000 in June, Caffrey said.
   Meanwhile, the purity of kilos decreased from 90 percent two
years ago to 74 percent in June, and the purity of street-buy grams
dropped from 70 percent in 1988 to 55 percent last month, the DEA
reported.
   An unreleased survey of all 19 domestic DEA field offices found
the trend toward increased prices and decreased purity was ``almost
nationwide,'' Caffrey said outside the hearing room.
   ``Florida is a little bit different in the sense that, yeah,
prices have gone up since last year at this time, but I would say
that it is still fairly stable,'' Caffrey said. That, he said,
``would indicate to us that at least in Florida, there is a fair
amount of wholesale cocaine available.''
   The DEA had been unwilling to say there was a shortage or any
nationwide trend until Tuesday, even though some of the numbers
were reported publicly last month and national drug policy director
William J. Bennett hailed them as indicative of a shortage.
   Caffrey said the DEA had been unwilling to say more in June
because it had only ``anecdotal reporting.'' On checking further
with the field offices, he said, the agency found some drug
traffickers were so in need of cocaine that they were asking
undercover agents to provide the drug.
   ``Normally, when we do our undercover work, we go out and we buy
drugs at certain prices that are quoted to us,'' Caffrey said.
``When the market starts to dry up a little bit, suddenly people
are asking us to sell them drugs, and then sting operations occur.''

<HEAD>Bolshoi Dances `Ivan the Terrible'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An audience doesn't go to the Bolshoi Ballet's
``Ivan the Terrible'' for history. It goes first for drama, second
for dancing.
   The company's first performance here of the 1975 ballet, set to
music composed by Prokofiev for Eisenstein's film ``Ivan the
Terrible,'' was Tuesday night at the New York State Theater.
   Choreographer Yuri Grigorovich has hinged his story on domestic
drama _ a triangle. Ivan, danced by Aleksandr Vetrov, chooses a
wife, Anastasia (Lyudmila Semenyaka), from assembled maidens.
Prince Kurbsky (Gedeminas Taranda) loves her. Out of frustration,
he leads the rich boyars, who resent Ivan's rule, against the czar.
   Grigorovich gives Ivan and his bride three romantic duets. In
the final duet, in which Anastasia returns after her death to
console Ivan, Semenyaka was ethereal.
   The choreographer doesn't give Prince Kurbsky enough emotion in
what he dances just after Ivan has chosen his bride. But he makes
up for it later, giving Kurbsky great emotion when Anastasia is
being poisoned by the boyars and great athleticism in a chase scene.
   Grigorovich choreographs most effectively for groups of people
dramatically filling the stage _ peasants, boyars, armies preparing
for battle, women whirling scythes as symbols of death.
   The very effective staging, designed by Simon Virsaladze, at
first looked like three silos, the center one farther back than the
others. There was only a small space for dancing in front of them.
The three ``walls'' turned out to be cloth, seen through when
lighted a certain way, and easily pulled out of sight. Ivan's
throne was behind the center one. It would go into shadow while
dancers filled the stage from the two other walls.
   ``Ivan the Terrible'' isn't smooth and elegant. It's on the
heavy-handed, dour side. But the company is excellent and
Grigorovich's story is engrossing. And it's interesting to attend a
ballet that hasn't been dulled by overexposure.
   The Bolshoi is starting a seven-city American tour in New York.

   Twenty-three endangered gray whales
that washed up on the Trinity Islands probably died of natural
causes and no tissue samples will be taken, federal officials say.
   Environmentalists wanted the carcasses tested to determine
whether they ingested oil from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in nearby
Prince William Sound.
   ``We have no reason to think at this point that it's anything
other than natural mortality,'' Steve Zimmerman of the National
Marine Fisheries Service in Juneau said Tuesday.
   ``You have a large group of animals that have migrated all the
way from their feeding area in the Bering Sea last fall down to
Baja (California), which is several thousand miles ... and then
back again,'' Zimmerman said. ``Any that are physiologically weak
are going to have problems toward the end of that long migration.''
   Zimmerman said the number of carcasses, found on the islands in
the Gulf of Alaska, was high but the whales could have died of old
age, parasites, genetic defects, marginal feeding and exhaustion,
among other possibilities.
   Environmentalists expressed concern because gray whales feed on
the ocean's bottom, where weathered oil would sink and accumulate
in sediments.
   ``Grays are the first ones to get nailed if there are tar balls
on the bottom,'' said Cindy Lowry, Alaska director of the
Greenpeace environmental group.
   She urged federal officials to take stomach samples as well as
tissue samples. ``This is an endangered species _ they should be
taking it seriously. That's too many whales dying in the same
place.''
   Biologists from the fisheries service and the University of
Alaska, Fairbanks, landed on Tugidak Island, about 20 miles south
of Kodiak, on Sunday and Monday to examine 14 whales spotted there.
   Nine whales were sighted from the air on nearby Sitkinak Island,
but scientists weren't able to look at them, Zimmerman said.
   Of the 14 whales on Tugidak, one apparently was the victim of a
killer whale, he said. Two whales apparently had been dead since
last year. One of the 14 was a calf or yearling.
   Most were between 35 and 40 feet long, which is fairly average,
Zimmerman said.
   ``There wasn't much else to tell _ they were dead for a long
time,'' he said. ``The whales are far enough gone we're not really
sure what the tissues would have shown anyway.''
   The agency hopes to increase its surveillance of the area next
summer, he said.
   Randall Weiner, executive director of the environmental law firm
Trustees for Alaska, said he was surprised samples weren't taken.
   ``Given the large quantities of oil spilled in Prince William
Sound, oil should not be excluded as a cause of death,'' he said.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of
crude oil into the sound in March 1989, the nation's largest spill.
Currents carried it southwest into the Gulf of Alaska.
   This summer is the second straight for whale die-offs on the
islands. A few residents have spotted what they believe are more
carcasses than usual washing ashore since the spill.
   Zimmerman disagreed, saying the number of carcasses may be near
average. Before the oil spill, he said, nobody monitored the island
for carcasses.
   A few tissue samples were taken from dead whales on the Trinity
Islands last year, but few have been tested because of a backlog of
oil-spill samples, he said.
   The few samples that have been tested show no connection between
the oil and the whale deaths, Zimmerman said.

<HEAD>Opponents Seek to Block Northeastern Gas Pipeline</HEAD>

   Rare turtles and oil drillers stand in the way
of a Canadian gas pipeline project sought by six Northeastern
states as a solution to their energy drought.
   A consortium of utilities hopes to win the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission's backing next week for the 364.4-mile
Iroquois natural gas pipeline. The line is designed to pump
clean-burning fuel from Canada to the energy-hungry Northeast.
   But first the $583 million project must overcome an array of
opponents from rival oil drillers to environmentalists to pop
psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers.
   At a daylong FERC hearing Tuesday, the opponents contended the
gas isn't needed, that the project is environmentally damaging and
_ in Brothers' case _ that it will harm an endangered turtle
species and uproot an important archaeological site on her
property, which lies on the pipeline route.
   ``I have very sensitive, historically sensitive material on my
property,'' Brothers said after the hearing, referring to her
271-acre estate in the Hudson Valley town of Dover, N.Y.
   The documents on the case include photographs taken by Brothers
of the bog turtle, listed as endangered in New York state. She also
says that before the pipeline route is approved, FERC should
investigate initial findings of ``prehistoric pottery.''
   The pipeline project also has vocal backers, including Govs.
Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts and Mario Cuomo of New York.
   Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities Commissioner Susan
Tierney said that even if the pipeline is completed by Oct. 31,
1991, as planned, New England still will have room for growth in
its energy supply.
   ``Not only are the volumes to be supplied by Iroquois needed but
there is a need for more,'' said Tierney. Without the pipeline, she
said, ``New England will have to continue to have high reliance on
expensive energy supplements.''
   The plan by the Iroquois Gas Transmission System would supply
the natural gas equivalent of 30 million barrels of oil per year to
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York and New Jersey.
The pipeline would run from the St. Lawrence River through wooded
areas, along highways and rail lines, under rivers and through back
yards in upstate New York, western Connecticut and under Long
Island Sound to South Commack, N.Y., on Long Island.
   Mark Seifert of the Independent Petroleum Association of America
complained of ``an anti-competitive rate structure'' that could
cause a ``death spiral for the domestic pipeline systems.''
   A key issue was whether FERC should make a final decision next
week or call for a series of evidentiary hearings that would give
opponents more time to block the project. Iroquois backers said
they want an immediate decision.

   President Bush is expressing pride in the role
the United States has played in spurring democracy in Eastern
Europe and suggesting it can be the catalyst for change in South
Africa.
   Bush spoke by telephone Tuesday with West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and
afterward commended the ``exceptional qualities of leadership''
both exhibited in clearing the way for a unified Germany to join
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   The president was meeting with a Hispanic group today and later
holding a budget negotiating session with congressional leaders
before heading off to California on a three-day Western trip.
   He will attend Thursday's dedication of the Nixon presidential
library in Yorba Linda, Calif.; raise money for Republican
candidates in California, Idaho and Montana and attend a Frontier
Days celebration in Cheyenne, Wyo.
   In a question-and-answer session with members of the Magazine
Publishers of America, Bush said the nearly $169 billion deficit
now projected for fiscal 1991 was ``disturbing.''
   ``The time for game playing is over,'' he said, adding he will
prod congressional leaders to forge a budget ``in the next couple
of weeks.''
   ``I'm very serious about it and I will stay with them as long as
is required to get a sound deal,'' he said.
   Bush spent 40 minutes on the phone with Gorbachev after a
half-hour conversation with Kohl.
   He gave Gorbachev a personal report on both the NATO and Western
economic summits and congratulated the Soviet leader on the support
Gorbachev won at the contentious Communist Party Congress in Moscow.
   ``I must say I take pride in the way Europe is moving into this
new era of freedom. It's a goal that we Americans have long worked
to achieve,'' the president told the magazine executives.
   On South Africa, Bush said it was important for South African
President F.W. de Klerk to visit the White House now that African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela has completed his trip.
   ``It will be somewhat controversial,'' said Bush, but he called
de Klerk ``a new kind of leader in South Africa.''
   He said the United States will not ease its economic sanctions
against South Africa ``until there is more progress'' in
dismantling the apartheid system of racial segregation.
   ``I think more than any of the European countries we can be
catalytic. We were not a colonial power and we are united in our
opposition to apartheid,'' Bush said. ``Those ingredients make our
country uniquely able to serve as a catalyst between the various
factors in South Africa, and that's what I want to try to do.''
   Bush also met separately with Neil Kinnock, the British Labor
Party leader who heads the opposition to the Thatcher government,
and a bipartisan delegation of 11 members of the Japanese Diet, or
parliament.

<HEAD>Plan to Allow Off-Reservation Gambling Coolly Met</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF MEYER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FARGO, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government's plan that it would
allow Indian tribes to open off-reservation gaming houses met
resistance by some Western governors.
   Under proposed guidelines announced Tuesday by U.S. Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., tribes would have to prove they
explored other modes of developing their economies before they
would be allowed to buy non-reservation land for gambling purposes.
   He said tribes would be barred from buying out-of-state land
``so we don't have a whole chain of bingo parlors owned by a single
tribe throughout the country.''
   Lujan, who outlined the guidelines at the annual Western
Governors' Association meeting, said governors would have the final
say on tribal requests to purchase off-reservation land for gaming
sites.
   North Dakota Gov. George Sinner said he would not approve such a
request, and Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado said tribes should be
subject to state gambling laws.
   ``I don't think that we want islands of gambling or anything
else outside the reservations,'' Sinner said.
   He said Indian gaming parlors would have an unfair advantage
over non-Indian establishments, since tribes are not subject to
state gambling laws, including those limiting the size of bets.
   ``I think it is an outrage where we are getting to a place where
the people of a state cannot make its own decisions about gaming,''
Romer said. ``I am very uncomfortable with the direction the
federal government is going with these new regulations.''
   Lujan said the regulations are needed to ensure proper
management of tribes that want to establish gaming operations in an
attempt to pump life into tribal economies.
   Montana Gov. Stan Stephens said federal Indian policies are
creating ``an apartheid nation'' in the United States.
   ``The time has come in this country when the federal government
needs to re-evaluate its entire relationship with Native
Americans,'' Stephens said. ``Most of these programs are abject
failures on reservations all across this country.''
   Lujan, asked about Stephens' comments by reporters, said
governors must remember that Indian tribes are sovereign nations
and must be treated as such.
   ``I don't see a comparison of South Africa with the Indian
reservations,'' he said. ``The laws of the state do not apply
within an Indian reservation anymore than the laws of North Dakota
apply in Canada or in South Dakota. So they are different.''

   Installing a donut-shaped device on the
outside of the Hubble Space Telescope is one idea that NASA
scientists are discussing to partially correct the instrument's
focusing flaw.
   Officials said Tuesday that a ``donut'' could be installed by
spacewalking astronauts to partially close the eye of Hubble. This
would sharpen the telescope focus slightly, but could present other
problems, NASA experts said.
   Meanwhile, James Beggs, the NASA administrator during the era
that the Hubble Space Telescope was being built, testifies before
Congress today for the first time since it was discovered that the
$1.5 billion telescope is seriously flawed.
   Beggs, who headed the space agency from 1981 to 1986, is
expected to be questioned about tests that were conducted on the
space telescope when the instrument was being assembled during the
early 1980s.
   The Hubble was discovered last month to have a basic focusing
flaw in its two main mirror optics. This causes it to see the
universe as a blur instead of the sharp, crisp images of distant
stars that the space agency had claimed it would see.
   The New York Times reported today that NASA has a backup mirror
for the Hubble that could have been used to replace the telescope's
mirror if testing had been performed on the ground to find the
focusing flaw. The Times quoted experts as saying they believed the
backup mirror, now in storage, could have been optically superior
to the one that was used.
   Ed Weiler, chief scientist for the Hubble project, said Tuesday
that the blurry vision of the telescope could be slightly improved
if spacewalking astronauts were to place a device that would narrow
the light-gathering opening of the instrument.
   Weiler said it would be like ``putting a donut on the outside of
the tube'' with light going through the donut hole. This would
restrict the light entering the aperture and improve the focus. He
said, however, the improvement would only be by ``a factor of two
or three'' and would reduce the amount of light seen by the
telescope.
   The Hubble still would not focus as crisply as scientists had
expected, he said, adding that there also was a risk of making
things even worse.
   ``I don't think the scientists would want to take that risk for
a factor of two or three'' improvement, he said.
   In congressional hearings today, Beggs was appearing before a
subcommittee chaired by Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.
   As NASA administrator, Beggs was in charge when the Hubble
mirrors were being made. Engineers have said Hubble's problems
originated with a mistake in the mirror manufacturing process and
that the error could have been detected with proper testing.
   In a report published in Space Business News, an industry trade
journal, Beggs said the Air Force had a facility that could have
detected the Hubble flaw, but that NASA was not permitted to use
the facility for tests.
   Mikulski, who chairs the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on
independent agencies such as NASA, has said she is outraged about
the Hubble mistake. She ordered the hearings to find out what went
wrong.
   Appearing with Beggs were Richard Truly, the current NASA
administrator; Lennard Fisk, the space agency's top scientist, and
William Lenoir, NASA's director of space flight.
   For Fisk, it was to be the fourth appearance before a
congressional committee since the Hubble problem was discovered. He
has twice testified before another Senate subcommittee, and once
before a House committee.
   Truly has been quizzed several times by Congress about Hubble
and also about hydrogen leaks discovered in two space shuttles. The
leaks caused the shuttle fleet to be grounded.
   In a news conference on Tuesday, Lenoir said the source of the
leaks had been found and that shuttle flights could resume as early
as next month.

<HEAD>Defense Agency Requests Delay of Iraq-Bound Furnace Shipment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Defense Department request is delaying
shipment of an industrial metal-casting furnace from a New Jersey
manufacturer to the Iraqi government.
   Customs Service spokesman David Hoover said Tuesday that the
Office of Defense Technology Security Administration had asked his
agency to detain the furnace. But he and John Konfala of the
Pentagon agency declined further comment.
   ``All we can do as a furnace-building company is to follow the
laws that the government has laid down,'' Raymond J. Roberts,
president of Consarc Corp., of Rancocas, N.J., said in a telephone
interview. ``We don't have access to the intelligence sources that
the government has.''
   He said Consarc received government approval more than a year
ago to sell Iraq a type of furnace that can cast titanium, a
lightweight metal the Iraqis said they need to produce artificial
limbs.
   Titanium also can be used for weapons production.
   British and American officials have seized other Iraq-bound
cargoes this year, saying the shipments were for military use.
   State Department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said they expected a decision by Friday on whether to permit the
Consarc export.
   Roberts said Consarc, which sells about $20 million of
industrial furnaces each year to customers worldwide, followed U.S.
rules to the letter in arranging the sale.
   He said Iraq's Ministry of Industry and Minerals said it had a
great need for artificial hip and knee joints for people injured
during the Gulf war with Iran.
   The Commerce Department told the company more than a year ago
that there would be no problem with the sale, Roberts said.
   However, Customs officials delayed the furnace when it reached
the dock in Philadelphia on June 26.
   ``I'm totally confused,'' Roberts said.
   John Thomas, a Commerce Department spokesman, said the Export
Administration Act prohibited him from discussing any information
about specific cases or companies.
   Roberts said he knew of only two other furnaces like the furnace
stopped at Philadelphia _ one produced by another U.S. firm to make
pumps for the chemical industry and another produced in West
Germany for making implants.
   He declined to reveal the purchase price of the impounded
furnace ``for commercial reasons'' but said Consarc would be able
to find another customer.
   Consarc's British sister operation produced other types of
furnaces for Iraq that were used in the heat treatment of metals,
Roberts said.

<HEAD>Quake Ranks as One of Severest Ever on Philippine Island</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The earthquake that shook the Philippines this
week was heavily populated Luzon island's third most severe ever
recorded, the U.S. Geological Survey says.
   Monday's disastrous quake north of Manila, recorded at 7.7 on
the Richter scale, was the strongest in the Philippines since the
1976 earthquake of 7.9 magnitude and tidal wave that claimed up to
8,000 lives off the coast of Mindanao, the Survey said Tuesday
after checking records at its National Earthquake Information
Center in Colorado.
   The Philippines, located on what seismologists call the
``Pacific Ring of Fire'' encircling the ocean, has had 30
significant earthquakes in the 14 years since the Mindanao
disaster, an average of more than two annually, said Waverly
Person, chief of the center's monitoring unit. He defined a
significant quake as one that registers at least 6.5 magnitude or
causes casualties or heavy damage.
   Monday's quake was the third strongest on record for Luzon,
exceeded only by one of an estimated magnitude of 7.8 on Dec, 14,
1901, near Lucena, southeast of Manila, and one estimated at 7.9 on
Aug. 15, 1897, off Luzon's northwest coast, the center said.
   The latest Philippine earthquake had the same magnitude of 7.7
as the June 20 shocks that killed up to 50,000 people in Iran, it
noted. That was the deadliest earthquake since one in Northeast
China in July 1976, with a death toll estimated at from 246,000 to
700,000, the survey said.
   The Pacific ``Ring of Fire'' includes the San Andreas Fault and
Mount St. Helens in the western United States and numerous
volcanoes, said the Geological Survey. Its scientists believe
Monday's Luzon quake occurred on a fault similar to the San Andreas
Fault in which the two sides of the fault slide horizontally past
each other.

   A department store burglar was tracked down by a
print made from a slice of finger he cut off when he climbed
through a broken window.
   James Carol Grisby was sentenced Tuesday to 35 years in prison
after pleading guilty to the burglary and explaining in court how
he lost part of his finger.
   Had a slice of his finger not been left at Vivi's department
store, police say they might not have caught Grisby.
   In court, Grisby, 31, admitted that he broke into the department
store May 13. He said that as he climbed through a broken window, a
piece of glass cut through his finger.
   Although he was in severe pain and bleeding profusely, he said,
he searched the store for valuables anyway, rummaging through pairs
of pants and shoes.
   Police found part of a finger in a shoe box, made a fingerprint
from it and matched the print to Grisby, whose prints were on file
from previous arrests.
   He was arrested June 3 during a gasoline station burglary. He
also pleaded guilty in that break-in.
   Grisby also received a 35-year sentence in the gasoline station
case. State District Judge Faith Johnson ordered that the sentences
run concurrently.

   In an elegant house in the best section of
the city, a doctor from a prestigious hospital connected his wife,
two children and himself to intravenous tubes hung from picture
hooks on the wall and killed them all.
   A suicide note left by Dr. Anthony Paul, 49, at his office and
at the house referred to financial difficulty and to the medical
problems of his wife, Melanie, 47, and daughter, Medhina, 17,
police said.
   Mrs. Paul had severe arthritis and Medhina severe brain damage,
according to the note, which was several pages long.
   A copy of the note was discovered Tuesday morning at the Fox
Chase Cancer Center, where Paul had worked for 15 years, said
spokesman Eric Rosenthal. Officials there called police, who broke
into the three-story house.
   The bodies were found in a second-floor master bedroom. IV
solution bags were hung from picture hooks, and IV tubes were in
the arms of each victim, police said.
   The bodies of the daughter and the son, Rajiva, 12, were on
mattresses on the floor. Mrs. Paul's body was on a bed and Paul's
body was slumped on the floor, Detective Lt. Thomas Quinn said. All
four were in bedclothes, he said.
   The IV bags were not labeled and their contents were not
immediately known, Quinn said. Autopsies were expected today.
   Police said the deaths occurred sometime after 7 p.m. Monday.
Paul had been at work Monday. There was no sign of a struggle,
Quinn said.
   ``This was one of those issues of human existence that those of
us who are left don't really understand,'' said Dr. Robert Comis,
vice president for medical science at the cancer center.
   ``He was a gentle man, someone who was respected by his
colleagues. He was appreciated by his patients and we are all
saddened and astonished by what happened.''
   Paul was a gastroenterologist specializing in cancer treatment,
Rosenthal said. He said Paul's wife was a psychiatrist but no
longer had an active practice.
   ``The whole institution is shocked. Those who are closest to him
are devastated,'' Rosenthal said.
   The suicide note spoke of the doctor's despair, police said.
   ``He decided to take the family with him,'' Quinn said. ``He
indicated he didn't want to leave his son as a ward of the state.''
   Comis said Paul's wife was often sick and his daughter was
``non-functional for her whole life.''
   There was no explanation for why he would kill his son, Comis
said.
   ``The son was apparently a very bright child. That's the great
tragedy in addition to the whole thing,'' Comis said. ``The issue
of the boy is something that I personally can't reconcile, but it's
done.''
   The white stucco and stone house with an ivy-covered lawn is on
a corner lot, surrounded by high hedges and mature trees. The home,
bought for $267,000 in 1985, had about 10 bedrooms, police said.
   ``I think he got involved in issues relating to his family to
the exclusion of everything else,'' Comis said. ``When it came to
what had to be done, it had to include all the members of his
family.''

   Czechoslovakia's new ambassador to the United
States has an early form of leukemia and is trying to decide
whether to remain in this country for treatment or return to her
own.
   ``It's not that we don't have good doctors at home,'' Ambassador
Rita Klimova told The Washington Post. ``But we don't have the
ability to protect patients from infection. That requires a high
degree of sophistication in the hospitals.''
   The ambassador, who assumed her diplomatic post five months ago,
said her government will pay her medical bills, but she is
concerned about finances and does not want to run up a big bill.
   The paper reported in today's editions that the ambassador said
her decision on whether to stay in the United States will depend on
finding treatment that ``fits in with someone's research plans.''

   An unidentified man was beaten and taken away
by Cuban police as he tried to enter a U.S. diplomatic office in
Havana, the State Department says.
   ``While he was on interests section grounds but before he could
enter the building, he was seized, beaten and taken away by Cuban
police who entered U.S. diplomatic property,'' State Department
spokesman David Denny said Tuesday night.
   U.S. diplomats protested the action to the Cuban Foreign
Ministry, he said.
   The United States and Cuba have had no formal diplomatic
relations since 1960. Each has designated another country to be its
formal representative in the other's capital, Switzerland in Havana
and Czechoslovakia in Washington.
   In practice, U.S. diplomats work out of the old U.S. embassy in
Havana under the name of the U.S. interests section of the Swiss
Embassy.
   Cubans seeking asylum have invaded the Spanish, Italian and
Czech embassies in Havana in recent days. Denny said he did not
know whether the appearance of the man at the U.S. interests
section was connected with those other asylum-seekers.

<HEAD>Investigator Says Tougher Regulation of Medical Devices Needed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal inspector general says flaws in the
Food and Drug Administration's regulation of medical devices may
allow unsafe products on the market.
   Health and Human Services Inspector Richard Kusserow told a
House panel Tuesday that investigations by his staff suggest the
FDA's regulatory system may prevent the agency from detecting
device problems early and acting promptly.
   Kusserow said the problems with the medical device approval
process ``parallel what we encountered in our extensive reviews of
the generic drug division,'' which turned up evidence that generic
drug companies had cheated on tests required to win FDA approval
and bribed FDA officials.
   ``Although our findings here are similar, we have no evidence of
these vulnerabilities manifesting themselves in any detected
criminal wrongdoing,'' Kusserow told the House Energy and Commerce
health subcommittee.
   The inspector general said that in addition to needing more
internal controls over the approval system, the FDA also needs
stronger authority to remove defective devices from the marketplace.

<TEXT>
   A judge says he wants more
testimony from a U.S. Army officer whose information led to arrests
in the slayings of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her
daughter last year.
   Judge Ricardo Zamora said Tuesday that he told the Foreign
Ministry to ask the U.S. Embassy to allow Maj. Eric Buckland, a
U.S. military adviser, to speak on the November attack at Central
American University.
   Buckland has already given a deposition to the court that led to
the arrest of Col. Guillermo Benavides, at the time director of a
military school near the university, as well as three Salvadoran
lieutenants and four enlisted men.
   A fifth enlisted man also wanted has escaped.
   However, Zamora told reporters he wanted additional testimony
from Buckland. It was not immediately clear whether Buckland would
comply.
   Failure of the rightist government of President Alfredo
Cristiani to move more quickly against human rights abuses has
angered members of the U.S. Congress, which provides millions in
aid to El Salvador every year.
   Armed men in military uniforms roused the Jesuits and the two
women from their beds at their Central American University campus
home on the night of Nov. 16 and shot them to death.
   The Jesuits had long been accused by rightist elements of
sympathizing with leftist guerrillas waging a decade-old war for
power.
   The assassinations occurred at the height of a furious monthlong
rebel offensive in the capital and the area was under a
dusk-to-dawn curfew and military control at the time.
   According to Buckland's deposition, Col. Carlos Armando Aviles _
a key witness in the case _ informed him that Benavides had
confessed to him that he took part in the slayings.
   Aviles denied this when he appeared before the court.
   Lt. Col. Carlos Camilo Hernandez, the military school's deputy
director, has been charged with covering up the crimes and was to
appear before the court today. He is alleged to have destroyed the
school logbooks and other evidence. The logbooks would have shown
who left and entered the building at the time.

<TEXT>
   Television video footage taken not
far from the epicenter during Monday's earthquake show panic, grief
and destruction in a rural town where authorities say four people
were killed and 14 injured.
   Amateur video photographers were making a documentary about the
town of Gabaldon, about 60 miles northwest of Manila, shooting
scenes outside the town's elementary school.
   As the camera panned toward surrounding mountains, the ground
shook. Seconds later students and teachers rushed out of the
one-story school's classrooms, most of them crying and looking for
missing classmates or pupils.
   As teachers gathered their pupils outside, students hugged each
other and cried openly. Students and teachers later screamed as a
strong aftershock followed, sending more of them scurrying away.
   One woman identified as a mother of a missing pupil was shown
sitting on the ground, grief-stricken. She was later seen pleading
with a man to help her look for her child. The school was still
standing.
   The footage showed a student who was killed after she was hit by
portions of a wall that collapsed. Blood flowed from her face as
she lay face-down in the midst of the rubble. A man later picked
her up and rushed her away.
   Men were seen rushing to the school, some of them splattered
with mud. They appeared to have come from nearby farms.
   ``Let's leave, Papa, let's leave Papa,'' a girl pleaded with her
father, who was inspecting the damage to a building.
   The video also showed scenes from the town center and the
marketplace, where canned goods and other food toppled from stalls.
   The footage, made by the private People in Communications, was
broadcast by local television stations.
   The Office of Civil Defense reported four people died and 14
others injured in Gabaldon, which is about 25 miles east of the
epicenter.

   An Ice Age armadillo is undergoing $40,000 worth
of restoration for display in its native Texas.
   ``It's about 10,000 to 40,000 years old. It's about six feet
long. Well, it's a Texas armadillo,'' said Terrell Falk, a
spokeswoman for the Museum of Natural Science in Houston.
   The fossil of the armadillo, also known as Holmesina
septentrionalis and the official state mammal of Texas, was first
discovered in 1955 by a Houston teacher and her teen-age son as the
two amateur fossil collectors poked around the mud banks of Brays
Bayou.
   ``What is neat about this is, there have been bits and pieces
found, but only two fairly complete skeletons found in North
America of the armadillo _ one in Florida and one here,'' Ms. Falk
said.
   The fossil was given to the museum but was lent to Balcones
Research Center in Austin. Later, a fossil expert from Canada
borrowed the skull and leg bones.
   The remains are under restoration in Salt Lake City. The fossil
will return to Houston early next year for display at the museum.

   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen in Tokyo
on Wednesday, and share prices on the Tokoy Stock Exchange lost
moderately.
   The dollar closed at 147.25 yen, down 0.95 yen from Tuesday's
close of 148.20 yen. After opening at 147.56 yen, the day's high,
the currency moved as low as 146.98 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues fell 124.17

   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year

down from Tuesday's close of 86.87. The yield stood at 7.270
percent, up from 7.225
   A dealer with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank said the dollar's weakness
was in line with trends toward declining U.S. interest rates since
last week.
   ``It's somewhat difficult now to buy dollars'' over prospects
that a further decline in interest rates would be expected, said
the dealer, who spoke on condition of anonymiy.
   ``Everyone is anxious to know what (U.S.) interest rate
direction will be,'' said Yuichi Tsuchiko, another dealer with Fuji
Bank. He said the market is awaiting testimony by U.S. Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan before Congress later
Wednesday.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average fell back on
profit-taking that came after five days of continued rises in the
market's main barometer, securities dealers said.
   ``The market rested today, after the five consecutive days'
advance,'' said an analyst with Daiwa Securities, who spoke on

   A Nomura Securites dealer said the market generally remained
weak in part because of a bearish bond market.

<HEAD>Study Questions Progesterone Treatment for PMS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Progesterone suppositories, the most common
treatment for premenstrual syndrome, is not significantly effective
for the condition that afflicts up to 7 million American women,
says a study published today.
   ``Premenstrual symptoms were not significantly improved by
progesterone compared with placebo in any measure used in the
study,'' researchers said in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   The study by scientists at the University of Pennsylvania was
the largest to look at progesterone treatment of PMS. It included
168 women who reported various symptoms, including irritability,
mood swings and breast tenderness.
   Women in the 1988 study received vaginal suppositories
containing progesterone for two months, followed or preceded by two
months of treatment with a placebo.
   Progesterone suppositories are the most common medical treatment
for PMS, lead researcher Ellen Freeman said Tuesday in a telephone
interview. They must be prescribed by a doctor, she said.
   While a few women reported some improvement with progesterone
alone, the number was not statistically significant, Ms. Freeman
said.
   Forty-four percent of 121 women who completed the study reported
a decrease of 50 percent or more in PMS symptoms. But because all
the women had received both progesterone and a placebo, researchers
said the improvement could not be attributed to the hormone.
   ``Why did those women improve, we can only speculate,'' said Ms.
Freeman, of the university's Department of Obstetrics and
Gynecology.
   ``They may have improved because they were getting a lot of good
medical attention and they felt supported, they felt understood,''
she said.
   Ms. Freeman said the study should not be construed as an
endorsement of the view that PMS is a bogus disorder. ``The problem
is real,'' she said.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Howard J. Osofsky of Louisiana
State University Medical Center said the study pointed out ``in the
most convincing manner to date the lack of substantiation of
beneficial effects of progesterone treatment for PMS.''
   He urged with Ms. Freeman that more research be done and said
previous studies have questioned progesterone's benefit in treating
PMS.
   Osofsky said a 1985 study of 23 women found progesterone
administered orally helped alleviate PMS symptoms. Ms. Freeman said
her group plans to study the effects of oral doses on a larger
group of women.
   Mollie Kane, spokeswoman for the National Women's Health Network
in Washington, said the study supports her group's belief that
progesterone therapy for PMS ``has not been adequately tested.''
   ``We feel that it's not good to be giving a drug like
progesterone ... to women on a large scale when it's not been
proven effective,'' Ms. Kane said.
   ``We very strongly advocate more research,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Two top editors of the Southern Baptist
Convention's press agency were fired after they refused to resign
in a dispute over coverage of the nation's largest Protestant
denomination.
   The denomination's Executive Committee voted Tuesday to fire
Baptist Press editor Alvin C. Shackleford and news director Dan
Martin.
   Shackleford said they were not given exact reasons for the
dismissals, although he believed the denomination's ruling
fundamentalists felt they were biased against the majority view.
   A statement announcing the firings from committee Chairman Sam
W. Pace of Lawton, Okla., was read without elaboration by Ernest E.
Mosley, executive vice president of the committee.
   Committee members refused to comment, saying only that Pace had
ordered them to refrain from discussing the matter outside the
session, which was closed to the public. Some committee members had
charged Baptist Press with showing a bias toward the denomination's
moderate wing.
   Later Tuesday, Nashville attorney Jeffrey Mobley announced the
formation of a new, independent press agency to be called
Associated Baptist Press.
   ``It will not seek sponsorship or affiliation with the Southern
Baptist Convention,'' Mobley said. ``It will be a stand-alone news
agency that will report on issues to people interested in Southern
Baptist affairs.''
   Shackleford, 58, worked at Baptist Press for 3{ years. Martin,
51, had worked there for nearly a decade.
   About 200 of the editors' supporters stood outside singing
``Amazing Grace'' and other hymns during the vote to fire
Shackleford and Martin.
   ``The last thing the revolutionaries who've taken over the
palace want is a free press,'' Martin told reporters. ``I think we
were fired because they want their own minister of information.''
   The 44-year-old Baptist Press sends stories and press releases
to about 400 clients, including 38 independent Southern Baptist
weekly newspapers.
   The executive committee didn't say whether replacements had been
hired. It gave the two editors seven months' severance pay and
benefits.
   The terminations mark the latest skirmish between
fundamentalists, who have held sway for a dozen years, and
moderates, who claim their role in the denomination's
decision-making process has been steadily undermined.
   In a prepared statement announcing plans for the new press
agency, Mobley said the firings lead ``to no other conclusion than
Baptist Press will cease to be a fair and balanced news service
reporting the business and events of the Southern Baptist
Convention.''
   Asked whether the new agency, which he said would be in limited
operation in August, would hire the editors fired by the
convention, Mobley said hiring staff would be a job for the
directors who have not yet been named.
   The Southern Baptist Convention, headquartered in Nashville, has
14.9 million members.

<HEAD>Twins Turn Two Triple Plays In One Game</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Minnesota Twins became the first team in
baseball history to turn two triple plays in a game. They lost
anyway.
   The record-breaking feats came Tuesday night against the Boston
Red Sox. Both triple plays went from third baseman Gary Gaetti to
second baseman Al Newman to first baseman Kent Hrbek.
   ``It's never happened in 120 years or whatever,'' said Red Sox
infielder Jody Reed, who hit into one of the triple plays. ``We
were the first. It's like landing on the moon.''
   To set up the first triple play, Minnesota pitcher Scott
Erickson loaded the bases in the fourth inning on a walk to Wade
Boggs, a double by Reed and a walk to Carlos Quintana.
   Then, Tom Brunansky hit a sharp grounder to Gaetti, who stepped
on third for the first out. He threw to Newman, forcing Quintana.
Newman then threw to Hrbek, beating Brunansky by a full stride.
   Gaetti said he sensed Brunansky, a slow runner, might hit into a
triple play and even said so to Boggs.
   ``I said, `Wade, you're going to see a 5-4-3 triple play right
here,''' Gaetti said. ``I don't think he believed me.''
   In the eighth, reliever John Candelaria gave up a double to Tim
Naehring to lead off the inning, then walked Boggs. Reed hit a
one-hopper to Gaetti, who stepped on third to force Naehring, then
relayed to Newman, forcing Boggs. Newman then threw to Hrbek,
beating Reed by a full stride.
   But not even the two triple plays helped the Twins in the end.
Boston won 1-0.
   ``I can't believe it'' Newman said. ``After the second one, I
figured it's destiny. We've got to win.''

   NBC held the ratings crown for a ninth
consecutive week, but its margin of victory was shrinking. CBS,
boosted by baseball's All-Star game, was second by a tenth of a
rating point.
   The American League beat the National League 2-0 in the
midseason classic in a game distinguished by nine hits, nine walks
and an episode of ``Rescue 911'' broadcast during a 68-minute rain
delay in the seventh inning.
   The game averaged an 18.5 rating and a 33 share, according to
ratings released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. A rating point
represents 921,000 households. A share is the percentage of all TV
sets in use tuned to a show in its time period.
   The All-Star game was CBS' first showcase event in the network's
$1.1 billion deal with major league baseball, and 17 million
households tuned in.
   Its 18.5 rating was fractionally higher than NBC's 18.2 rating
last year. The best All-Star ratings in recent years were the 20.5
ratings and 36 shares ABC won in 1988 and NBC in '85.
   Overall, NBC narrowly won the week of July 9, its ninth
consecutive weekly ratings victory and its 40th in the past 43
weeks, with a 9.8 rating and a 19 share. CBS was one-tenth of a
rating point back at 9.7 and a 19 share.
   ABC came in third at 9.1, with an 18 share. The Fox Broadcasting
Co. had a 6.2 rating and a 12 share.
   ``The numbers are very close all over the place,'' said analyst
David Marans of the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency. ``Among
adults 25 to 54 it was a virtual tie for the three networks. You
can't get closer than that.''
   A rerun of NBC's ``Cheers'' was the top-rated entertainment
show, in second place with a 16.2 average. Fox's ``The Simpsons''
was third at 14.5.
   Rounding out the top 10 were fourth-ranked ``The Cosby Show,''
with a 14.4 rating; No. 5 ``Roseanne'' at 14.0; NBC's ``Sunday
Night Movie,'' the Canadian miniseries ``Love &amp; Hate: A Marriage
Made in Hell'' was No. 6, at 13.9.
   NBC's ``A Different World'' and the All-Star pregame show tied
for seventh at 13.6; CBS' ``Designing Women'' was ninth at 13.3 and
``60 Minutes'' was tenth with a 13.2 rating.
   Demographically, the Fox ``weblet'' continues to attract viewers
in advertisers' prime demographic groups.
   ``Among adults 18 to 34, Fox had three of the top five shows,''
Marans said. `The Simpsons' was No. 1, `Married ... with Children'
was three and `In Living Color' was four, even though Fox is still
not available in about 10 percent of the country.''
   The preview of ``Prime Time Pets,'' CBS' pet show, finished 19th
but the show itself debuted at a disappointing 60th place. The
network's ``Northern Exposure'' came in 46th, holding its own
against ``Primetime Live'' and a repeat of ``L.A. Law,'' Marans
said.
   NBC's ``Quantum Leap'' experimental five-weeknight showing of
reruns of the time-travel drama in late June has paid off. ``In the
past week, `Quantum Leap' was first among all key demographics in
its time period,'' he said.
   NBC, which plans to move the show to 8 p.m. Friday in its fall
schedule has to be pleased with its performance, Marans said.
   Another NBC experiment, the Friday night repeats of the early
'80s series ``Bret Maverick,'' with James Garner and ``Yellow
Rose'' with Cybil Shepherd and Sam Elliott, has been less
successful, he said.
   ``Yellow Rose'' was 64th and ``Bret Maverick'' was 57th.
   ``Those episodes originally aired when NBC was in last place,''
Marans said. ``Their premise must be that not that many people saw
them or remembered them. It's an interesting idea, considering the
high cost of programming.''

<HEAD>NASA to Attempt at Least One Launch Before October</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NASA will try and repair Atlantis'
leaky fuel line at the launch pad in an attempt to get that shuttle
and Columbia off the ground in the next two months.
   The chances of that happening are small, however, and the space
agency expects it will have to settle for one launch prior to
Discovery's flight with the sun-probing Ulysses satellite in
October, said William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program.
   Nonetheless, he said, this should demonstrate ``we are alive and
well and healthy, that we have a robust process that behaved as it
should have that gets flights off in a timely fashion when it's
safe.''
   ``Not only do we see the light at the end of the tunnel, but I
believe we are out of the tunnel,'' Lenoir said Tuesday.
   Not since the 1986 Challenger disaster, which killed seven
astronauts, has the space agency been hit by so much criticism. At
issue are the shuttle leaks, which had grounded the entire fleet,
and mirror imperfections on the Hubble Space Telescope that make it
impossible to focus clearly.
   President Bush on Tuesday expressed confidence in the space
agency and its administrator, Richard Truly. The day before, the
administration ordered a review by outside experts of the nation's
long-term space goals.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is under no
pressure to rush into flight, Lenoir said.
   ``We're all motivated I would say, more so than pressured, to
find what's wrong, to fix it and go fly, and that's exactly what we
have done,'' he said. ``We're not hurrying to do it, but on the
other hand we're not going to take a year off and study it to
death, either.''
   Atlantis would be the next shuttle to fly provided its hydrogen
leak can be corrected at the pad. Engineers believe the leak is
somewhere around a flange on the external tank side of a
17-inch-diameter valve. The valve is in a pipe that carries fuel
from the tank to the main engines.
   If the flange's seal is not cracked, workers will tighten the 48
bolts in that area, Lenoir said. A third tanking test will be
conducted next week to see if that was enough to resolve the
problem.
   Atlantis' leak was discovered during the first tanking test June
29, which prompted NASA to ground all three shuttles. Columbia's
leak was detected during fueling for a May 30 launch attempt.
   ``We will take our best shot at everything we can do on the
pad,'' Lenoir said. ``If that fails and we still have the leak,
honestly that's what we expect to be the case, we roll back'' to
the hangar, Lenoir said.
   Columbia consequently would be moved from the hangar back to the
launch pad for an early September liftoff with the Astro
observatory, Lenoir said.
   If Atlantis does not have to go back to the hangar, NASA will
attempt to launch that shuttle with a classified Defense Department
payload around August 10 or 12, Lenoir said. Columbia would follow
around Sept. 10 to 14.
   In either case, Discovery's flight with the Ulysses satellite
will remain on schedule, Lenoir said. Discovery must lift off
between Oct. 5 and 23 because of Earth's alignment with the sun and
Jupiter, or else the mission must wait 13 months.
   Whichever flight does not precede the Ulysses mission
immediately will follow it, Lenoir said.
   It's too soon to say what kind of an impact the delays will have
on the shuttle flight schedule over the next few years.
   ``We want to make sure we have a realistic schedule, and if that
requires the domino effect going farther than we're happy with,
that's just what's going to turn out,'' Lenoir said.

   The dollar slid against the Japanese yen today,
while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange suffered its first
setback in six trading day sessions.
   The dollar closed at 147.25 yen, down 0.95 yen from Tuesday's
close of 148.20 yen. After opening at 147.56 yen, the day's high,
the currency moved as low as 146.98 yen.
   ``It moved narrowly, and the day's trading volume didn't amount
to much,'' said Koichi Amaya, a dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   Spot transactions totaled $11.74 billion, up from $8.56 billion
the previous day.
   Amaya said many market players retreated to the sidelines
awaiting U.S. economic data, including the U.S. consumer price
index for June, to be released in Washington later today.
   Other dealers say planned testimony by U.S. Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan on monetary policies to the U.S.
Congress, slated for later today, discouraged some traders from
taking major positions. They were waiting for further indications
of declining U.S. interest rates.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues shed 124.17 points, or 0.37 percent, to close at 33,048.11.
   Wednesday's decline ended a 1,019.85-point surge that began last
Tuesday.
   ``There was no specific reason to explain the index's slip, if
anything, it could have been the bearish bond market. It's not
surprising that the market would take a rest now,'' said Chizuko
Hayashi, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co.
   In bond dealings, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds edged down to 86.70 points as of 4 p.m.
(3 a.m. EDT), down from Tuesday's close of 86.87. The yield was
7.260 percent, down from 7.225 percent.

<HEAD>Israeli Historians Welcome Revision Of Auschwitz Death Toll</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli historian today welcomed Poland's
decision to lower the official death toll at the Auschwitz-Birkenau
death camp from 4 million to under 2 million and acknowledge that
most of the victims were Jews.
   ``It's a positive change that the Poles decided not to play
politics with the victims anymore,'' said Shmuel Krakowski, head of
the archives at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem.
   Krakowski said that until recently Poland had clung to the
higher figure of 4 million victims, including more than 1 million
non-Jews, to back claims that Poles and other gentiles suffered as
much as Jews at the hands of the Nazis.
   Revised findings by the Auschwitz State Museum said the number
of victims in the Nazi death camp in southern Poland actually was
1.1 million to 1.5 million, the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza
reported Tuesday.
   Of that number, at least 960,000 were Jews.
   The report cited by Gazeta Wyborcza is to be published next year
by the state museum and Yad Vashem memorial. The paper said plaques
carrying the inflated death toll have been removed from a memorial
at the camp, the largest built by the Nazis.
   Krakowski said the revised figures were in line with Yad Vashem
estimates that fewer than 2 million people were killed in
Auschwitz-Birkenau, among them up to 90 percent Jews.
   ``We always knew and published the right number,'' he said.
``The Poles didn't want to correct theirs until now because of
political considerations.''
   Krakowski said because Yad Vashem had always stuck to the lower
figure, the new death toll out of Poland did not affect the total
of 6 million Jews who perished in the Nazi Holocaust.
   Of the 6 million, just under 4 million were gassed to death in
Nazi death camps, the largest of which were located in
Nazi-occupied Poland, including Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka and
Majdanek.
   Krakowski said the figure of 4 million victims at
Auschwitz-Birkenau alone was first mentioned by Rudolf Hoess, the
death camp commander, during his trial in Poland after World War II.
   The figure was also cited by a Soviet commission that came to
the camp in February 1945, one week after its liberation. It later
submitted its findings to the Nuremberg war crimes trials.
   Based on the numbering of inmates, letters linked to transports,
and statistical lists made in Jewish ghettos, the number of victims
that can be documented is 1.1 million, about 90 percent of whom
were Jewish, Franciszek Piper, head of the Auschwitz State Museum's
history department, said in an interview with Gazeta Wyborcza.
   Poland has pressed the Soviets since the 1970s to grant
historians access to World War II camp records, which were packed
up and taken to the Soviet Union soon after the liberation, Piper
said.
   The Ministry of Culture of Poland's new Solidarity-led
government has appointed a committee to review the state of the
Auschwitz-Birkenau memorial and museum.
   The review wants not only to repair the physical deterioration
of the camps, but to correct exhibits dating from the 1950s that
the ministry says distort history by concealing the main reason the
camps existed was to exterminate Jews.

stolen, Beaver County sheriff's deputies said Tuesday.
   The teen-agers, ranging in age from 17 to 19, dropped the items
more than 300 feet on three occasions in May, deputies said.
   They said they were trying to prove the velocity of the balls,
bags and barrels was the same when dropped from the bridge, despite
the different weights, deputies said.
   The deputies would not identify the teen-agers or say what led
to their apprehension.
   Deputy James Mann said the sheriff's department is not pursuing
charges against the teen-agers because they have no criminal
records and because their parents agreed to pay for the damage.

   A sequel to the hit movie ``Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles'' is to come out of its shell next year to lure kids
on spring break, a distribution company said.
   New Line Cinema Corp. said Tuesday it received North American
distribution rights for the sequel to handle releases for theaters,
television and the home video market.
   ```Cowabunga' doesn't really begin to express our enthusiasm
about the distribution rights,'' said Robert Shaye, New Line's
president and chief executive officer.
   The sequel, starring the same pizza-loving, crime-fighting
turtles as the original, has an estimated budget of more than $20
million and a tentative release date of March 15, 1991.
   It was produced by Golden Harvest Productions of Hong Kong.
   The first film, released last March, has grossed $129 million,
making it the highest-grossing independent film in movie history.

<HEAD>State's Highest Court Paves Way for Governor to Sign Tax Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state's highest court said a proposed tax on
services is constitutional, clearing the way for Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis today to sign a $1.3 billion tax increase.
   In a 4-3 advisory opinion Tuesday, the Supreme Judicial Court
rejected arguments that the Massachusetts Constitution allows a tax
on commodities but not services.
   The court said the word commodities ``is not limited to tangible
personal property.''
   The tax increase bill approved earlier this month by the
Legislature would expand the 5 percent sales tax to 594 business
services, including legal fees, athletic club memberships and even
fortune tellers.
   ``This decision is about change. It's about the future of tax
policy in Massachusetts,'' said state Sen. Patricia McGovern. ``We
can shift the burden from middle and lower class people to people
of great means, the wealthy.''
   After months of grappling with the state's financial and
economic woes, Dukakis said the tax package should help restore
fiscal stability to Massachusetts.
   Opponents said they will continue to fight the measure.
   Massachusetts ended its last fiscal year with a more than $1
billion deficit. Proponents of the tax plan said the state needs
more money to pay off that debt and help balance the proposed
budget for the current fiscal year.
   The tax bill included an income tax increase and a
10-cent-a-gallon boost in the gasoline tax to raise about $1.9
billion annually after the first year, when $1.3 billion would be
raised. The expanded sales tax would raise about $500 million of
the total each year.
   Lawyers were among the strongest opponents of the plan, saying
it would intrude on attorney-client privilege by turning them into
tax collectors.
   Business leaders argued the bill would significantly boost the
operating costs of companies that purchase accounting, engineering
and electricity services, among others. They said it could lead to
layoffs and higher prices for consumers.
   House Minority Leader Steven Pierce said the tax plan would be
``a serious economic blow to the state.''
   ``You don't jump start the economy with a dead battery,'' said
Pierce, a Republican gubernatorial candidate.
   Another GOP gubernatorial candidate, William Weld, said the
issue was not the constitutionality of a services tax, but its
wisdom.
   ``This tax will cost the Massachusetts economy far more than it
will bring in in revenue,'' Weld said.
   But James Braude, executive director of the Tax Equity Alliance
of Massachusetts, a taxpayer group, said the services tax would put
some of the increased tax burden on businesses instead of working
people.
   ``It is good news for the average taxpayer,'' Braude said of the
court's decision.
   The state is expected to create certain exemptions for small
businesses and also address the tax on commercial use of energy.
   The bill would exempt the first $20,000 in bills for legal,
architectural, accounting and engineering services.
   Among the other services that would be subject to the sales tax
would be out-of-state telephone calls, photographic services,
general repairs for businesses and landscaping over $100.

<HEAD>Summonses Filed Against Empire State Building Management</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city fire department has filed two
code-violation summonses against managers of the Empire State
Building, claiming defects in an alarm system slowed firefighters'
response to a blaze that injured 38 people.
   The exact amount of time firefighters lost in getting to
Monday's fire at the 102-story landmark was not clear, said John
Mulligan, a fire department spokesman.
   One summons, filed Tuesday, charged that the 59-year-old
building's alarm system failed to flash word of the fire to a
central alarm station, which would have notified the fire
department, he said.
   The second summons, Mulligan said, charged that the building's
fire safety director, who was supposed to brief arriving
firefighters, was nowhere to be found when the first fire companies
arrived in the lobby of the building.
   Each summons, for alleged violations of the city's
administrative code, is punishable by fines of $500 to $10,000.
They must be responded to by Sept. 6 in Manhattan Criminal Court,
Mulligan said.
   The building's alarm system, operated by AFA Protective Systems
Inc. of Manhattan, had not been connected to AFA's central alarm
station, which normally would have flashed the alarm to the fire
department, he said.
   Instead, the department was notified by telephone. It was not
clear who made the call, Mulligan said.
   A spokesman for Howard Rubenstein Associates, which represents
the building management, Helmsley-Spear Inc., said the fire was
spotted before it could set off alarms.
   The spokesman, who did not want his named used, said a member of
the building's fire response team was notified of the fire, went to
the floor to check it out, saw the smoke and pulled the fire alarm.
   In response to the second summons, the building spokesman said:
``The person who discovered the smoke was the fire safety director.
He pulled the alarm and went down the 51 floors to be present when
firefighters arrived.''
   ``The building has very clearly demonstrated that there was an
effective response, an appropriate evacuation and there is computer
documentation to underscore that,'' he said.
   Fire alarms sounded on only two floors during the blaze because
the system is designed to avoid panic in the skyscraper, where
10,000 people work, Fire Commissioner Carlos Rivera said.
   Most of the people who work in the building had gone for the
day. About 1,000 people, including tourists, were evacuated by
stairways and elevators, Mulligan said.
   Rivera said despite limited alarms and a public address system
that failed after an initial announcement, people were ``never in
any serious danger.''
   The fire broke out in offices on the 51st floor _ exactly
halfway up the tower that for decades was the world's tallest
building and still symbolizes New York to millions around the world.
   Chief Fire Marshal John Stickevers said investigators had not
found the cause, but were ``leaning toward an electrical fire.'' He
said there were ``no suspicious circumstances.''
   Gary Lewi, a spokesman for the building management, said the
alarm system worked as intended. It goes off only on the fire floor
and the floor above ``so as not to induce panic,'' he said.
   Charles Guigno, manager of the building, and engineering
director Albert Goffe said that system is in accordance with fire
department regulations.
   Thirty-four firefighters and four civilians were injured in what
Rivera called ``an extremely difficult fire because of the intense
heat and intense smoke.''
   Except for a few open or boarded-up windows and some smoke and
water damage on floors above and below the burned area, the
building operated normally Tuesday, said Robert Udowitz, a
spokesmen for the managers.

<HEAD>China Institutes Severe Penalties for Pornographers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's highest court has set severe
penalties, including the death penalty, for people who deal in
pornographic materials.
   Items considered pornographic include audio and video tapes,
records, books and magazines, playing cards, and photographs and
pictures describing sexual behavior or directly depicting
licentious images, official media reported.
   The regulation, announced Monday by the Supreme People's Court,
is the latest in the campaign launched last fall against the ``six
evils:'' pornography, prostitution, gambling, feudal superstition,
abducting and trafficking women and children and drugs.
   Lin Zhu, vice president of the Supreme People's Court, said that
artistic and literary works that have some obscene content,
paintings depicting the beauty of the human body and materials on
medicine and natural science would not be considered pornographic.
   Lin's comment was one of the first to give some guidance on what
will be considered pornographic. There is no legal definition of
pornography, and in China anything showing a naked body or even
kissing can be regarded as obscene.
   The new regulation stipulates that punishment for the production
of, trafficking in, transporting or smuggling of pornographic
materials will range from jail terms, including life imprisonment,
to death, the reports said.
   The regulation applies, for example, to those found producing
more than five to 10 videotapes, 10 to 20 cassette tapes, 10 to 20
playing cards or books and 50 to 100 photographs or pictures.
However, it does not clarify what penalty would be applied.
   In a separate commentary, the official Xinhua News Agency hailed
the ``bold move to stamp out pornography.''
   It noted that ``the rampancy of pornographic matierals'' has
been a major factor in the rise of juvenile crime in China. Last
year, 290,000 juveniles were sentenced, up 36 percent from the
previous year, the commentary said.
   Sixty percent of sex-related crimes committed by juveniles can
be traced to the influence of pornography, it said.
   Since China launched its anti-pornography drive in August, more
than 1,100 people involved in more than 700 cases have been tried,
and tens of millions of pornographic books and videotapes
confiscated, Xinhua said.
   Last fall, the evening news was filled with nightly reports
showing mountains of books and videotapes going up in flames.
   Several thousand centers for producing and selling pornographic
materials have also been destroyed, Xinhua said.
   After the Communists came to power in 1949, pornography and
prostitution were virtually eliminated, but they have made a
comeback during the past decade as China has opened its doors

<HEAD>Study Finds Borderline High Blood Pressure Can Damage Heart</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Stevo in 2nd graf is cq.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Borderline high blood pressure, often ignored by
doctors, can increase the chance of heart attack, researchers said
in a study released today.
   ``I think what we can conclude from this study is that a
condition that clinical practicioners tend to ignore ... can really
lead to much more serious problems,'' said the lead researcher, Dr.
Stevo Julius, chief of the division of hypertension at the
University of Michigan.
   Results of the study were published in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   Health records of nearly 1,000 people in Tecumseh, Mich.,
between the ages of 18 and 38 were examined for high blood pressure
since childhood. Of those studied, 124 had borderline high blood
pressure and also displayed slight damage to heart and blood
vessels.
   Doctors long have held that high blood pressure, or
hypertension, damages vital organs and can lead to heart attacks,
kidney failure and strokes. But the new study is the first
indication that borderline high blood pressure also can cause organ
damage.
   The report suggests that doctors need to re-examine the way they
treat patients with borderline high blood pressure, Julius said in
a telephone interview Tuesday from Ann Arbor, Mich.
   ``Today the practice is to wait until a patient already has
developed hypertension and then treat it (with drugs),'' Julius
said. ``But high blood pressure is really only part of the
problem.''
   Julius said doctors need to prescribe exercise and dieting for
people with borderline high blood pressure who also are overweight
_ another symptom that usually precedes heart problems.
   ``These people who we tend to disregard seem to have other
problems as well,'' he said. ``We need to look at ways to treat
them without committing these people to pills.''

<TEXT>
   Troops battling for control of
rebel-held areas in the north and east have killed nearly 150 Tamil
guerrillas in the past two days and freed 200 besieged soldiers,
the army said today.
   The casualties push the death toll past 2,500 since the
7-year-old civil war flared up again a month ago between Tamil
separatists and the Sinhalese-dominated government.
   A large but unknown number of civilians also have been killed.
   Military officials said said at least 98 rebels and 7 Sinhalese
soldiers were killed in two battles Tuesday at the village of
Manakulam, 25 miles north of Vavuniya.
   Vavuniya, 130 miles north of Colombo, has been a major scene of
fighting in the 37 days of fighting between government forces and
separatist rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
   The advancing soldiers also rescued about 200 soldiers trapped
by a rebel siege at an army camp in Manakulam since June 11, said
the officials.
   Helicopter gunships strafed guerrilla positions at Mandur
village Tuesday in the eastern district of Ampara, killing 51
militants, said the officials.
   The latest deaths bring to 2,549 the number of troops and rebels
killed since June 11, when a 13-month cease-fire fell apart. There
was no immediate rebel comment on the army's report.
   On Monday, Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said
``several battalions'' of troops were moved from the east to the
north after the rebels overran a key army camp in the region.
   He did not give the number of troops moved. A battalion of Sri
Lankan army consists of about 850 soldiers.
   Tamil Tigers captured the Kokkavil army camp July 11 after
killing 46 of the 60 defending soldiers. They also blew up a
government-owned television relay station near the camp.
   Officials said the reinforcements started their operation
Tuesday, pushing the rebels back and recapturing a government
hospital in Manakulam, just south of Kokkavil.
   Further north, rebels shot at and badly damaged a car belonging
to the International Committee of Red Cross that was escorting 12
trucks, said the officials. The trucks were about to collect food
and medicine in Jaffna, where the Tigers are headquartered, for
transportation elsewhere on the Jaffna peninsula, officials said.
There were no casualties.
   At least 290,000 people are reported to have left their homes on
the Jaffna peninsula and sought refuge in temples, mosques and
churches.
   The guerrillas have seized control of most of the north and some
areas in the east.
   Tamil militants launched a war for an independent nation in
1983, claiming their community was being discriminated by the
majority Sinhalese in jobs, education and the use of Sinhala
language.
   The insurrection has cost more than 13,500 lives.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population and control the
government and the military.

<HEAD>ZELL MILLER</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Zell Miller, 58, has been lieutenant governor of Georgia for 16
years. He has spent three decades in Georgia politics, as a
small-town mayor, a state senator and parole board member before
winning the state's No. 2 job.
   Miller, a native of the north Georgia town of Young Harris,
served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1953 to 1956. He is a 1957
graduate of the University of Georgia and was elected mayor of his
hometown in 1960.
   Miller served as a state senator from 1961-65 and executive
secretary to then-Gov. Lester Maddox from 1968 to 1970. He was
elected lieutenant governor in 1974.
   Miller opposes new limits on abortion. He supports sex education
in Georgia schools, the death penalty and a state lottery, with the
proceeds to be spent on education.
   Miller said he wants to create a voluntary pre-kindergarten
program and favors creating military-style boot camps for young,
first-time drug offenders.

   Young served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1972 to
1977 and as U.N. ambassador from 1977 to 1979. He was mayor of
Atlanta from 1982 to 1990.
   When campaigning, Young downplays race, pointing instead to his
ability to attract industry and development as Atlanta's mayor.
   He personally opposes a lottery but does not object to letting
voters decide the issue. He opposes new limits on abortion.

   Isakson graduated from the University of Georgia in 1966 and
entered the Air Force, where he served until 1967. Isakson then
entered the Georgia Air National Guard, serving from 1967 to 1972.
He has been a legislator since 1977.
   He lives in Marietta in Atlanta's northwest suburbs and is the
head of a large Atlanta real estate brokerage firm built by his

   Isakson opposes further state restrictions on abortion and
supports a state lottery for education.
   Isakson, minority leader in the House since 1983, paints himself
as a pro-business candidate seeking to build rural economies and
improve the state's school systems.

<HEAD>Convicted Anti-Castro Terrorist Released</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government released convicted anti-Castro
terrorist Orlando Bosch to virtual house arrest and said he would
be deported if a host country can be found.
   Among strict conditions the Justice Department imposed on Bosch
in exchange for his release Tuesday was that he keep a log of
everyone he comes into contact with and have his telephone
monitored.
   Bosch said he would speak with whoever wanted to talk to him
during the ``three miserable hours'' a day the 14-point agreement
allowed him to leave his house.
   Despite what he called his unfair imprisonment in the United
States, the Cuban exile many in Miami consider a hero said he
wasn't bitter.
   ``I love this country,'' he said. ``It is one of the greatest
countries.''
   Bosch called the conditions of his release ``ridiculous'' and
said he would get around the demand to keep a visitors' log by
hanging a banner on his door telling callers to go away because
``there are no informants living here.''
   Bosch, 63, has spent the past 14 years in prison in Venezuela
and at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center outside Miami.
   Bosch's attorney Hank Adorno refused to discuss details of the
agreement, but took pains to say his client abandoned his violent
opposition to the government of Fidel Castro.
   ``He has renounced terrorism in any form whatsoever as a means
of political action and as a means to free Cuba from communism,''
Adorno said.
   Bosch said that in his long history of fighting for the freedom
of Cuba, ``the government of the United States has built up a
voluminous file against me titled `terrorist.'''
   ``Nonetheless, the government of the United States has never
wanted to go into the depths of that file to understand that my
persistence, my insistence and even my intransigence, are the
product of a past, a sinful past, wherein the sovereignty and the
freedom of my country were put in the balance and the right to
belligerence was sacrificed in order to liberate Cuba from its
tyrannous oppressors,'' he said.
   An earlier agreement to free Bosch fell through last week when
he refused to keep a log of all visitors, saying it would make him
an informant.
   Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian in Washington said
Bosch was released because he had renounced violence and said there
had been no changes in the government's conditions.
   The other conditions allow Bosch to leave his home only between
11 a.m. and 2 p.m. He must wear a monitoring device, allow
unannounced searches of his home and must avoid any contact with
militant anti-Castro groups.
   Bosch was convicted of the 1968 homemade bazooka attack on a
Polish freighter in the port of Miami. After serving his sentence,
he violated parole by leaving the country without permission.
   Venezuelan authorities later arrested him for allegedly
masterminding the bombing of a Cuban airliner in 1976, killing all
73 aboard. They held him for 11 years, but failed twice to convict
him and finally freed him to return to the United States.
   Bosch was arrested on his arrival in Miami as an ``excludable,''
or undesirable alien. The INS released a report linking him to
right-wing terrorist groups responsible for 50 bombings in Miami,
New York and Latin America.
   Government attorneys told a federal judge this year they tried
to deport Bosch to 31 countries, but all refused. Cuba demanded
Bosch be returned for trial, but U.S. officials dismissed that
possibility.
   ``Legally he's still excludable. And if we can find a country to
deport him to, we will do so, except for Cuba,'' Eramian said.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower As Market Awaits Greenspan Testimony, Gold Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was lower in calm European trading as
investors waited for U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's
testimony before Congress later today. Gold prices were lower in
light dealing.
   Dealers said attention has shifted to the British pound, which
continued to rise on expectations the government will keep interest
rates high.
   Manfred Totzauer, senior trader at Citibank in Frankfurt, said
Greenspan's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee will be a
key indicator of the dollar's next movements.
   ``If he mentions inflation and puts weight on that, then I can
imagine the dollar will go higher. But if he should put more weight
on things like the economy and the banking situation and hints at
further reduction in U.S. interest rates, then I think we'll see a
lower dollar,'' Totzauer said.
   A trader with a major U.S. bank in Milan thought Greenspan would
be ``cautious regarding statements on interest rate movements.''
   ``In my view, following last week's adjustment in the federal
funds rate, he's going to say interest rates should stay where they
are for the time being. We're not seeing the signals from the
economy that they should move lower,'' the trader said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.95 yen to a closing 147.25 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 147.28 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.6440 West German marks, down from 1.6455
   _1.4075 Swiss francs, up from 1.4065
   _5.5180 French francs, down from 5.5210

   _1,204.35 Italian lire, down from 1,205.12

<HEAD>Man Executed for Killing Man He Said Made Homosexual Advances</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A convicted male prostitute with a
criminal record that began at age 12 was executed by injection
early today for killing a man he claimed had made homosexual
advances.
   Mikel Derrick, 33, was pronounced dead at 12:17 a.m., six
minutes after the injection.
   He was executed for the Oct. 10, 1980 killing of 32-year-old
Edward Sonnier, stabbed 19 times in the victim's Houston apartment.
   A medical examiner testified that any one of 16 wounds could
have killed Sonnier. Derrick said he was provoked by a homosexual
attack.
   ``I just ask everybody I ever hurt or done anything wrong to, to
just forgive me for whatever wrongs I done to them,'' Derrick said
in his final statement.
   Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to halt the
execution in a 5-4 vote. On Monday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals rejected his request for a stay, noting that he had
confessed both orally and in writing to the slaying.
   While serving four 10-year terms on an unrelated robbery
conviction, Derrick wrote a letter to the Harris County District
Attorney's office saying he had committed the murder, stolen
Sonnier's car and stripped it for parts.
   Derrick said that he had heard one of his brothers could have
been charged for the car theft. The brother, who was caught with
parts stolen from the car, implicated him and split a $1,000 reward
with other family members, he said.
   ``I'm not bitter,'' he said in a recent interview. ``I feel
sorry for everybody. They're not deterring crime by this. They're
not stopping anything by executing. Each time they execute one guy,
they've got four or five capital cases waiting right on behind. And
it ain't going to stop.''
   Derrick said his troubles with the law began at age 12 when he
served time in a juvenile detention center for petty theft.
Following his release, he went to Missouri to live with his mother,
but she refused to accept him.
   He was convicted of auto theft in Beaumont and placed on four
years probation. He also had a prostitution conviction from New
York.
   Derrick's family members testified against him at his trial.
   The execution was the 37th in the state since Texas resumed
capital punishment in 1982. It was the 134th nationwide since the
Supreme Court allowed states to resume executions in 1976.
   In Florida, the execution of Jerry White was pushed back to 7:01
a.m. Thursday after the state Supreme Court gave him a second
24-hour stay. He was originally scheduled to die Tuesday morning.
His appeal is now before the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta.

   Showers fell early today in parts of the South as clear skies
and mostly dry weather prevailed over the rest of the nation.
   Unseasonably warm weather was expected across the nation today
thanks to a strong jet stream flowing along the Canadian border.
   In the Northeast, a stationary high pressure system is expected
to bring hazy sunshine and high humidity.
   Temperatures were forecast in the upper 80s and 90s.
   Today's forecast called for thunderstorms in the Great Lakes
region and scattered showers are expected in the eastern Dakotas
and Minnesota.
   It was raining today in southern Florida and central Georgia.
   Heavy thunderstorms today could produce more flooding in parts
of eastern Texas and Louisiana.
   In the West, scattered showers were likely in the Sierras and
parts of the central Rockies.
   Dry and warm weather was expected along the California coastline.
   A state of emergency was declared Tuesday for drought-plagued
Santa Barbara in Southern California.
   The nation's high for Tuesday was 111 degrees at Borrego

<HEAD>No Charges Filed Against Earth First! Activists</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two environmental activists injured in a
pipe bomb blast two months ago will not be charged in the
explosion, prosecutors said.
   ``This takes a big weight off my shoulders,'' Earth First!
activist Judi Bari said after Alameda County prosecutors announced
Tuesday that charges will not be filed against Bari and Darryl
Cherney in the car bombing.
   ``We're not filing charges. Our decision is based on the
evidence presented and we determined it's insufficient to obtain a
conviction,'' Alameda County Deputy District Attorney Chris
Carpenter said.
   Carpenter declined to elaborate on the evidence.
   However, Mike Roselle, a founder of the radical environmental
group, said he understood one reason for not filing charges was
that nails used to construct the homemade bomb did not match those
found at the home of one of the injured activists.
   Defense lawyers for Bari and Cherney said the decision not to
charge the pair exonerates their clients of wrongdoing in
connection with the May 24 explosion in Oakland.
   ``I can't speak for the prosecutors, but we view their action as
confirmation of Judi and Darryl's innocence,'' said Douglas
Horngrad, a lawyer for Cherney.
   Bari and Cherney have contended that the car bomb blast on May
24 was in retaliation for their work in organizing ``Redwood
Summer'' protests against the lumber industry.
   However, they were arrested for investigation of explosives
possession and transportation because police suspected they were
carrying a device that went off accidentally.
   ``From the moment the bomb went off under Judi's seat, the
Oakland Police Department launched an investigation directed at
them solely because they are political activists,'' according to a
joint statement issued by Horngrad and Susan Jordan, a lawyer for
Bari.
   Bari, who suffered a broken pelvis in the explosion, was
released from Oakland's Highland Hospital last week but continues
to be treated at an undisclosed ``medical facility,'' a hospital
spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   Although authorities have not publicly identified any other
suspects, Oakland Homicide Lieutenant Mike Sims said the
investigation will continue.
   ``No one has been cleared and we haven't excluded anyone,'' Sims
said.

<HEAD>Crew Has Problem Entering Capsule After Spacewalk</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds 3 grafs of comment at end by U.S. expert, Soviet space
official.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Two cosmonauts who walked in space to fix their
spacecraft had to use an emergency hatch to re-enter the Mir space
station when the normal hatch failed to close completely, Soviet
media reported today.
   The two, Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander Balandin, spent seven
hours outside the spacecraft Tuesday repairing thermal insulation
that had partially ripped apart and threatened to interfere with
their safe return to Earth, Tass said.
   The official news agency said the crew, after leaving the space
station, inspected the torn insulation on the Soyuz TM-9 capsule
and, ``with the help of metal clamps, fixed the two loose shield
fragments.''
   When the repair work was finished, the cosmonauts faced a new
problem: the outer door to the entrance chamber would not close,
preventing them from achieving the hermetical seal needed to open
the inner door.
   Tass said Solovyev and Balandin entered through a hatch in one
of the space station's two scientific modules. ``They sealed it
hermetically and took off their space suits,'' the news agency said.
   The entire operation took about two hours longer than scheduled,
Tass said. Ground controllers expressed confidence there would be
no problems when the two cosmonauts return to Earth on Aug. 9.
   ``According to the results we have gotten so far ... we can
almost definitely state that it (the thermal insulation problem)
will not affect the landing,'' said flight controller Vladimir A.
Solovyev in an interview from the Baikonur Space Center in Soviet
Central Asia.
   The report by the flight controller, who is a former cosmonaut,
was broadcast live Tuesday night by the evening news program Vremya.
   The program showed a fuzzy picture of the Soyuz spacecraft with
what appeared to be flapping thermal insulation. Part of the
insulation has been flapping uselessly for months. Soviet officials
extended the cosmonauts stay in space so they could make the
repairs. They had been scheduled to return July 30 after nearly six
months in space.
   The emergency repairs were the latest in a series of problems in
the Soviet Union's manned space program, which for decades has been
a source of national pride. For the past two years, the program has
been plagued by docking equipment malfunctions, cosmonaut errors
and budget cuts.
   The damage probably occurred during the Soyuz capsule's launch
Feb. 11, when a ground rescue structure apparently scratched the
thermal blanket, according to Deputy Flight Director Viktor Blagov.
   Soviet officials have minimized the danger, saying the capsule
could withstand such damage to its thermal blanket, the newspaper
Izvestia reported.
   ``No one is concerned here. It is an abnormal situation but
controllable,'' said Vsyeva Latyshev, a spokesman at the Soviet
Mission Control Center in Kaliningrad, north of Moscow. He spoke in
a telephone interview.
   But James Oberg, an American specialist on the Soviet space
program, said that although the cosmonauts managed to climb back
into Mir safely, the hatch problem could complicate future
spacewalks.
   ``The general crisis was not fully resolved,'' Oberg, author of
several books on the Soviet space program, said in a telephone
interview Wednesday from his Texas home.

<TEXT>
   Richard Sagness has a double-dipped
career _ during the school year he's a college professor but during
the summer he's a scooper.
   That's why they call him Dr. Ice Cream.
   ``It's a real tough way to spend the summer,'' Sagness chuckled
as he leaned over his ice cream cart at downtown Pocatello's
Simplot Square. ``I suppose some people think it's beneath my
dignity to be doing this, but I think that's nonsense.''
   Sagness, who trains the teachers of tomorrow as a professor in
Idaho State University's College of Education, says he's not in it
for the money. He does it, he says, to help his wife keep her cool.
   ``He's doing this very willingly,'' maintained Donna Sagness,
who owns the local ice cream shop. But she conceded the cart has
been a good way to keep her husband out of trouble.
   ``He's worth what I pay him, which is nothing,'' she said.
``He's good with the cart, but we have to watch him when he's in
the store. He'll eat everything, including the flavors that nobody
else will eat, like brandied fruitcake.''
   Sagness admits his love of ice cream, especially when it's free,
keeps him on the job.
   ``When I was a kid, I worked at a soda fountain. The owner said,
`Eat all you want, because eventually you'll get tired of it,''' he
recalled. ``I was his only employee that never got tired of it.''

<HEAD>India Imposes Direct Rule in Kashmir</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DILIP GANGULY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today imposed direct
federal rule in Kashmir, where Indian security forces are battling
to put down a rebellion by Moslem separatists.
   The action follows the killing Tuesday of at least 29 Moslem
militants by Indian security forces.
   In the Pakistani capital of Islamabad, meanwhile, India and
Pakistan opened negotiations today aimed at repairing relations
threatened by the rebellion in the disputed northern region.
   Relations between Pakistan and India worsened in January when
Indian soldiers cracked down on Moslem militants in Kashmir who are
seeking independence from India or union with Pakistan. At least
792 people have been killed in Kashmir since then. India has
accused Pakistan of arming and training the militants, a charge
Pakistan has denied.
   Before direct federal rule was imposed today on Jammu-Kashmir
state, it was administered temporarily by a governor, a federal
representative, since Jan. 18. The announcement of federal rule
reflected the belief that Jammu-Kashmir state was too unstable to
be run by an elected local government.
   On Tuesday, at least 29 militants were killed by Indian security
forces in Kashmir, the Moslem-dominated northern part of
Jammu-Kashmir state and the center of the secessionist campaign.
   Officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules, said
21 militants were killed in a battle with the Border Security Force
in Poonch, 400 miles northwest of New Delhi. Hours later in the
same area, troops killed eight militants who slipped across the
border from Pakistan, said the officials.
   The guards also arrested four militants and seized 14 automatic
rifles, two machine guns and two rocket launchers, the officials
said.
   Indian officials maintain that Kashmiri militants regularly
cross over to Pakistan through the border and return by the same
route after reciving arms training. Pakistan denies it is training
or helping the militants, but calls the separatist struggle a fight
for self-determination.
   India and Pakistan have fought two previous wars over Kashmir,
in 1948 and 1965. Both were won by India.
   About 65 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people are
Moslems, making it India's only Moslem majority state. Nationwide,
Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people. Hindus
make up 82 percent of the population.
   Kashmiri separatists earlier demanded union with Pakistan, an
Islamic country, but they have recently been fighting for total
independence and the status of a neutral country.

<TEXT>
   Feuding Shiite Moslem militias fought with
artillery and rockets in the south today, at times hitting a PLO
force that had wedged between them in a bid to halt the fighting.
   The 3-day-old battle has left 63 people dead, police said.
   PLO officials said their fighters would attack the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah if it did not withdraw from the strategic
hilltop village of Jarjou, which Hezbollah seized from the rival
Shiite Amal militia on Tuesday.
   The deployment of the 600-member Palestine Liberation
Organization force Tuesday placed it close to Israel's ``security
zone'' in southern Lebanon and has raised fears that the Israeli
army also will intervene.
   Hezbollah _ or Party of God _ and the more secular,
Syrian-backed Amal ignored a call by the Red Cross for a six-hour
truce so casualties littering the battle zone could be evacuated.
   By police count, 63 people have been killed and 218 wounded
since Monday, when Hezbollah attacked Amal's main stronghold in
Jarjou.
   It is the fiercest clash in six months between Amal and
Hezbollah. They have been fighting on and off for three years for
control of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest
sect. More than 1,100 people have been killed and more than 3,350
wounded in the inconclusive conflict.
   Zeid Wehbe, PLO chief Yasser Arafat's representative in Lebanon,
said today that the Palestinian force would enter Jarjou if
Hezbollah did not withdraw from it within 24 hours.
   Hezbollah said Tuesday that it would confront the PLO, and a
party official warned that the Palestinian deployment would trigger
``large-scale violence.''
   The Palestinians formed a 4-mile-long buffer between Amal and
Hezbollah in the villages of Sarba, Houmine and Arab Saleem west
and south of Jarjou.
   The PLO force, drawn mainly from Arafat's mainstream Fatah
faction, moved in after Hezbollah fighters overran Jarjou, 10 miles
southeast of the port city of Sidon.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said today's clashes centered on a hill separating
Hezbollah-held Jarjou from Amal positions in Arab Saleem.
   Amal fighters were shelling the hill with rockets, howitzers and
mortars ``in an apparent effort to prevent Hezbollah from
controlling it,'' he said. Hezbollah pounded Arab Saleem, two miles
south of Jarjou in the panhandle of the so-called Apple Province.
   Police said shells were crashing around the PLO force's
headquarters in a mansion at the eastern edge of the village.
   The PLO wants to prevent Hezbollah from gaining a badly needed
coastal outlet while its supply lines through the Syrian-controlled
Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon remain vulnerable.
   The PLO also does not want its reviving strength in the region
or bases near Sidon threatened by Hezbollah.
   Lebanese leaders and newspapers said today that the PLO's
intervention could provoke an Israeli thrust into southern Lebanon.
   Communist Party leader George Hawi said: ``The current
developments are expected to invite Israeli intervention at a time
when Israel is looking for a pretext to strike at the PLO and
re-establish control over south Lebanon.''
   Israeli warplanes flew repeated reconnaissance missions over the
embattled region on Tuesday after the PLO deployed.
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 to crush the PLO, which had
become a virtual state-within-a-state in Lebanon. Arafat's
guerrillas were forced to evacuate the south and Beirut.
   But the PLO has sent back at least 5,000 guerrillas into the
refugee camps around Sidon, the region's provincial capital 25
miles south of Beirut.

<HEAD>Three Imprisoned Arabs Killed as Suspected Collaborators</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Palestinian man strangled three fellow Arab
prisoners today in an Israeli detention camp, authorities said.
Arab reports said the slain men were suspected of collaborating
with prison authorities.
   In another development, police today arrested six activists in
the anti-Arab Kach movement of U.S.-born Rabbi Meir Kahane on
suspicion they vandalized an office of the socialist Mapam party.
   The killings at the detention camp at Ketziot in the southern
Negev desert were discovered when the three men, all from the
Zaytoun quarter of Gaza City, failed to report for roll call this
morning, the army said in a statement.
   It said the Palestinians were under detention ``until the end of
legal proceedings against them'' but did not say if they had been
charged with specific crimes. Family members said they wee detained
five months ago on suspicion of anti-Israeli activities.
   The deaths raised to 26 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs in Israeli jails since the December 1987 start of the
Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the
army spokesman's office said. Most have been slain on suspicion
that they collaborated with Israeli authorities.
   About 10,000 Palestinians are imprisoned by Israel, including
about 1,500 held without charge or trial under ``administrative
detention'' regulations.
   Since the uprising began, 239 Palestinians have been killed by
fellow Arabs. A total of 723 Palestinians have been killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians, and 45 Israelis have been slain by
Palestinians.
   The slain prisoners were identified by the army and family
members as Fahmi Azzam, 22; Arafat Abu Thuraya, 24, and Bassam
Saqer, 30.
   The army identified the prisoner accused in the killings as Wael
Abu Famouna, 18, also from Gaza City.
   Also today, a military court in Lod sentenced a man from Arab
east Jerusalem to 11 years in prison for setting fire to 12 cars in
1988 and 1989.
   Mohammed Khader Abu Houmus, 24, pleaded guilty to the arson and
admitted it was ``with the express intention of causing damage to
Jewish property,'' the court said. Houmus also was found guilty of
throwing a firebomb at a military jeep in July 1988. No one was
hurt in any of the incidents, the court was told.
   Today's arrests of the anti-Arab activists came a day after
vandals broke into the Jerusalem office of the Mapam Party,
smashing furniture, tearing up documents and spraying painting the
walls with slogans.
   Jerusalem police spokesman Uzi Sandori said three of those
arrested were senior Kach officials and three were minors. Police
did not identify them.
   The Kach Party calls for the ouster of the 2.5 million Arabs who
live in occupied lands. It also has attacked liberal groups such as
Peace Now and Mapam which advocate territorial concessions in
exchange for peace.
   Israel radio said the six detainees would also be investigated
in connection with an arson attack two months ago on the office of
the Peace Now Movement in Jerusalem.
   The Brooklyn-born Kahane moved to Israel in 1971 and founded
Kach two years later. He served in Israel's Parliament but was
denied permission to seek re-election in 1988 when Israel's Supreme
Court ruled his party's platform was racist.

<HEAD>James Meredith: Black Leaders Are Puppets</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 4 grafs to note that Helms is running against a
black former mayor. Picks up 4th graf, `Meredith, who...'.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MATT BIVENS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prominent black government officials are
puppets for an elite group of powerful white men, said James H.
Meredith, a black civil rights pioneer who now works for
conservative U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms.
   Meredith, a special assistant to the Republican and the first
black to attend the University of Mississippi, said Tuesday 15
white men pull the strings for many black leaders, including ``the
chairman of the Democratic party, the mayor of any city, city
councilmen in most cases in the big cities, any high level position
in city government.''
   He said he knew the names of the 15 men, but refused to divulge
them.
   Helms is being challenged in his re-election bid by Democrat
Harvey Gantt, the black former mayor of Charlotte.
   Meredith, who was wounded during a freedom march in Mississippi
in 1965, has become in recent years a harsh critic of the
civil-rights establishment. He has said a ``liberal elite'' wants
to keep blacks in a second-class position under the pretext of
helping them.
   ``When we went to Mississippi my enemy was the white
supremacists. My enemy now is the white liberal,'' he said earlier
this year.
   On Monday, Meredith issued a news release printed on Helms'
Senate stationery announcing that many of the 3,000 delegates who
attended an NAACP convention last weekend in Los Angeles are
involved in drug use, crime and immoral activities. Meredith stood
by the allegation Tuesday.
   He also charged a cadre of white men control American black
leaders.
   ``The truth of the matter is that the liberal elite _ with
knowledge and full thought on the part of the black elite _ have
deliberately set up a phenomenon as part of their political power
control, of taking a handful of selected blacks, giving them high
rewards and using them to control the black population,'' Meredith
said.
   Helms stood by his aide Tuesday, despite protests by leading
black officials.
   ``We call on Sen. Jesse Helms ... to disavow this statement and
to take appropriate disciplinary action against Mr. Meredith,''
said Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People.
   In a statement, Helms said, ``It is his right to express his
opinion and I would think the press would respect that _ even if he
does not espouse the liberal ideas the press supports.''
   Helms said he did not authorize Meredith's release, but his only
fault with his assistant was using Senate stationery and free
mailing privileges.
   Hooks refused to respond to Meredith's charges.
   ``It would serve no useful purpose to address such ludicrous
accusations from one who has obviously lost touch with reality,''
Hooks said.
   Meredith also accused black leaders _ and especially those in
the leadership of the NAACP and the Democratic party _ of not
caring.
   ``I bet you there were not 10 people in that (NAACP) convention
who lived near the black community,'' he said. ``Three thousand
people don't have the right to sell the interest of 30 million
people.''

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's foreign minister today accused
neighboring Kuwait of violating Iraq's border and stealing $2.4
billion worth of its oil.
   The accusation by Foreign Minister Tareq Aziz marked a sharp
escalation in Baghdad's campaign against fellow OPEC members who
have been producing more oil than allowed by the oil cartel's
quotas. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been the main
targets of the Iraqi campaign.
   Kuwait today dispatched officials to other Arab nations to seek
support.
   Aziz's comment came in a letter to Arab League Secretary-General
Chadli Klibi. It was read over official radio and television
stations.
   ``Despite our sincere efforts to continue our brotherly dialogue
with them, the Kuwaiti officials are attempting to harm Iraq and
weaken it in a premeditated and deliberate way,'' the letter
declared.
   In Kuwait City, the emirate's capital, the crown prince and
prime minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, called the
75-member National Council to a special session to discuss the
Iraqi allegations. During the Iran-Iraq war, Kuwait was one of
Iraq's staunchest allies.
   The Kuwaiti foreign minister, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed, later flew
to Saudi Arabia to discuss the Iraqi accusation and said he would
visit other members of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council to
seek support. The council groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar,
Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.
   Other top Kuwaiti officials will visit Egypt, Sudan, Djibouti,
Somalia, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria,
Morocco and Mauritania, the official Kuwait News Agency reported.
   The collapse of oil prices, blamed largely on the
over-production, has cost Iraq billions of dollars in lost revenue
at a time when it is financially strapped because of the 1980-88
war with Iran.
   Its foreign debt runs at an estimated $60-$70 billion, including
$30 billion provided mainly by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia during the
Persian Gulf war.
   Aziz warned that the alleged Kuwaiti encroachment in southern
Iraq was tantamount to military aggression. He did not say whether
Iraq would retaliate.
   Aziz claimed Kuwait has set up military posts and drilled oil
wells in Iraq's southern Rumaila field and has pumped $2.4 billion
worth of oil since 1980. Aziz said Baghdad now expects Kuwait to
pay Iraq that amount.
   He said the Iraqis have compiled a record of alleged Kuwaiti
encroachments along the 80-mile border.
   Aziz accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of undermining
Arab unity by cheating on the quotas set by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to bolster prices. He called it ``a
premeditated and deliberate plan to weaken Iraq and undermine its
economy and security.''
   ``This is a short-sighted, selfish and dangerous view which
causes great harm not only to Iraq, but to the whole Arab nation,''
Aziz said. President Saddam Hussein also criticized the two nations
over the same issue Tuesday.
   Kuwait has a quota of 1.5 million barrels a day but in recent
months has been producing as much as 1.9 million barrels a day.
   The United Arab Emirates has produced as much as 2.1 million
barrels a day in recent months, more than double its quota of 1.09
million barrels a day.
   This has helped drive prices down from the OPEC benchmark of $18
a barrel to below $14 in recent weeks. The Iraqi president said a
$1 fall in the price of a barrel of crude costs Iraq $1 billion a
year. He said Iraq has lost $14 billion because of the price slump.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Asks South Korea to Send Delegation to Moscow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By C.W. LIM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has
asked South Korea to send an economic delegation to Moscow,
officials said today, but it was unclear if talks would include the
establishment of diplomatic ties.
   The Soviet request was made in a letter to President Roh Tae-woo.
   Also today, a member of South Korea's leading, internationally
acclaimed musical family said the group has been invited to perform
in Communist North Korea and will go if the Seoul government
approves.
   Presidential spokesman Lee Soo-jung said the South Korean
delegation would leave for the Soviet Union next month.
   Gorbachev's letter, dated July 6 and received Monday, was in
response to an earlier letter from Roh offering to send a
high-level delegation to Moscow to discuss the normalization of
relations between the two countries.
   Roh and Gorbachev met in San Francisco last month and agreed in
principle to establish diplomatic relations between their once
hostile countries. The Soviet Union is an ally of South Korea's
rival, Communist North Korea.
   South Korea has been eager to open formal relations with the
Soviet Union in an effort to isolate Communist North Korea and
increase its motivation to ease tensions on the divided Korean
peninsula.
   A leading South Korean newspaper, The Joongang Daily News, said
this week that the Soviet Union is using Seoul's desire for
normalization of relations to press for economic aid. Quoting
unidentified government sources, the paper said the Soviet Union is
requesting a $15 billion economic package from South Korea,
including a $5 billion loan.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into North Korea and South
Korea in 1945.
   Later this year the prime ministers of the two Koreas plan to
hold a historic first meeting. An agreement on the premier's
meeting is to be signed July 26.
   In late August, South Korea's leading musical family is
scheduled to play together in South Korea for the first time in 16
years.
   Chung Myung-whun, musical director and conductor of France's
National Paris Bastille Opera and Orchestra, and his sisters in New
York and London have also been invited to perform in North Korea's
capital, Pyongyang, the family said.
   No date has been suggested for a visit to the North, and the
South Korean government has not been formally asked for approval.
But a source close to the family said it should be considered
timely that the three Chungs will be together in South Korea at the
end of August.
   South Korean musicians have performed in North Korea only once
in the last four decades. That was in 1985 and there have been no
cultural or people exchanges since.
   With his sisters, cellist Myung-wha Chung of New York City and
violinist Kyung-wha Chung of London, Myung-whun Chung is widely
regarded as one of the world's leading Korean-born classical
musicians.
   Chung said the family would not go without approval from Seoul,
even though as residents of the United States they technically do
not need permission.

   The State Department today urged U.S. citizens
traveling to Nepal to exercise caution in view of strikes and
demonstrations in the troubled Himalayan country.
   The department said incidents of violence that occurred in the
Nepalese capital of Katmandu in the spring have diminished, but
strikes and demonstrations by various groups continue.
   ``Because of the unpredictability of local conditions, American
citizens should closely monitor local events before traveling to
Nepal,'' the department said. ``Once in Katmandu, American citizens
are strongly urged to register with the American Embassy.''
   The department said the advisory would continue in effect until
next May 15.

<HEAD>Math, Science Education Bill Approved by Senate Committee.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee today approved a $125
million bill aimed at improving math and science education for
schoolchildren and increasing the number of persons seeking
advanced degrees in the subjects.
   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee voted unanimously
for ``The Excellence in Math, Science and Engineering Education Act
of 1990'' that Chairman Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., described as a
down payment on the nation's future.
   ``I believe this bill is an excellent start on improving the
nation's math-science education,'' said Kennedy, pointing to the
national education goal of making American students first in the
world in math and science by the year 2000.
   ``Upgrading elementary-secondary education, training graduate
level scientists and engineers, and increasing the participation of
women and minorities are all central issues that urgently need our
attention,'' he said.
   Committee statistics showed that four-fifths of elementary
school mathematics teachers are not fully qualified to teach math
and two-thirds of elementary school science teachers are not fully
qualified to teach science.
   A third of American high schools offer no physics course, and
many others offer no chemistry course. U.S. high school seniors
ranked ninth in advanced physics in a survey of 13 countries, and
11th in advanced chemistry. American students were last in advanced
biology, a study showed.
   At the college level, statistics showed less than 1 percent of
last year's freshman class planned to major in math, compared with
4 percent, 20 years ago. Currently only 5 percent of U.S.
undergraduates earn bachelor of science degrees, compared to 20
percent in Japan and 37 percent in Germany.
   In U.S. graduate schools, 50 percent of the engineering
doctorate degrees are earned by foreign students.
   The legislation, estimated to cost $125 million in 1991, would
create a national clearinghouse to collect and distribute
instructional and program materials in science, mathematics and
technology. It now goes to the full Senate.
   Regional education programs also would be authorized under the
bill, as well as the math-science teacher corps and a science
scholars program. The National Science Foundation would be allowed
to double its graduate fellowship program and a traineeship program
would be established so that graduate schools that do not currently
have a large number of graduate fellows can attract highly talented
students.

activists. Pickup 2nd pvs, `The incident...' Minor editing to TRIM.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Cuban court convicted 11 human rights
activists of counterrevolutionary crimes today and meted out
sentences ranging from three to 15 years, the official Cuban news
agency Prensa Latina reported.
   The convictions came one day after U.S. officials in Cuba
protested the police beating and arrest of a man who entered the
U.S. diplomatic post in Havana. It was not immediately clear
whether the man sought to join a dozen Cubans seeking asylum in
foreign compounds.
   The sentences were announced early today after a 15-hour trial
before a provincial court, Prensa Latina said in a dispatch
monitored in Mexico City.
   It said the crimes ranged from terrorism and rebellion to having
contacts with U.S. officials in Cuba.
   The defendants were identified as members of Pro-Human Rights
Youth, a group organized in 1989. Prensa Latina said they were also
linked to the outlawed Pro-Human Rights Party.
   Prensa Latina said the defendants had planned to steal
explosives to blow up the National Library and the Cuban Institute
of Radio and Television.
   The agency said Luis Enrique Linacero, Ivelise Camejo, Jose Luis
Martinez, Miguel Fernandez and Juan Carlos Sierra were sentenced to
15 years in prison. It said Francisco Rosado was sentenced to 10
years and Ares Nasco and Guillermo Campos were given eight-year
terms. Maria Garcia, Moises Vialart and Guillermo Santos were
placed under house arrest for three years, Prensa Latina said.
   The incident Tuesday at the U.S. interests section of the Swiss
Embassy occurred just eight days after small groups of Cuban
asylum-seekers first began taking refuge in embassies.
   Twelve Cubans voluntarily abandoned the Czechoslovak Embassy on
Monday, and Prensa Latina said they would be allowed to go home
after questioning.
   The agency also quoted a Foreign Ministry statement as saying
Fidel Castro's Communist government would never yield to ``pressure
or blackmail'' by people seeking to leave the island.
   The incidents at the embassies have attracted attention because
similar moves by asylum-seekers in East German embassies last year
helped precipitate the fall of the hard-line Communist government
in that country. Albania, which like Cuba has refused to adopt
democratic reforms, recently allowed hundreds of people who entered
embassies in its capital to leave for new lives in the West.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman David Denny said he
did not know whether the appearance of the man Tuesday morning at
the U.S. interests section was connected with the other cases of
asylum-seeking.
   ``While he was on interests section grounds, but before he could
enter the building, he was seized, beaten and taken away by Cuban
police who entered U.S. diplomatic property,'' said Denny.
   U.S. diplomats protested the action to the Cuban Foreign
Ministry, he said.
   The United States and Cuba have had no formal diplomatic
relations since 1960. Each has designated another country to be its
formal representative in the other's capital, Switzerland in Havana
and Czechoslovakia in Washington.
   Officials and news reports said three Cuban asylum-seekers who
took refuge last week remained at the Spanish Embassy, four were at
the Italian ambassador's residence, and five Cubans were in the
apartment of Czechoslovak Charge d'Affaires Jan Doemoek.
   An official at the Italian Foreign Ministry in Rome said today
that Italy does not expect Cuba to allow the four to leave the
country but does expect guarantees for their safety.
   The Cuban Foreign Ministry said in the statement carried by
Prensa Latina that the 12 Cubans who left the Czechoslovak Embassy
on Monday would not face prosecution. It also indicated they would
not be allowed to leave Cuba.
   Cuba and Czechoslovakia were close allies until last fall's
democratic upheaval toppled Prague's hard-line Communist leaders.

<TEXT>
   Public schools should be declared
``commercial-free zones'' to protect children from the increasing
prevalence of advertising disguised as educational materials, a
consumer group says.
   In a study, Consumers Union warned Tuesday that many purported
teaching aids donated by businesses contain pitches for those
businesses' products. Some of the come-ons are direct, others
surreptitious, it said.
   Schools often acquiesce to the handouts because they can't
afford to buy unbiased new materials, the report said. Students
fall victim, it charged, because they are unlikely to question
advertising disguised as schoolwork.
   ``The result: Schools are becoming heavily sponsored by
corporations marketing products,'' the report said. ``They're
`selling' the kids entrusted to them to any bidder.''
   The study also criticized other forms of advertising aimed at
children, including ads in children's magazines that are disguised
as editorial copy, the use of celebrities to promote products, ads
camouflaged as entertainment, and licensing deals that put popular
symbols on a vast array of products.
   Interest in the issue of advertising in schools was heightened
last year by the advent of Channel One, a video news program for
pupils that includes commercials. Schools receive the program and
viewing equipment free.
   The report called Channel One ``the tip of the iceberg'' and
listed examples of self-promotion in corporate-supplied teaching
materials. It said such materials reach more than 20 million
students a year, although it did not estimate what proportion
include advertising.
   One example was the ``Polaroid Education Program,'' which the
report said ``mentions `Polaroid' in every lesson and assignment.''
Another was a ``Good Nutrition'' program from Chef Boyardee that
``names its products in all recipes; and just encourages kids to
eat pizza. (No nutrition education.)''
   Polaroid spokesman Harry Johnson said its program was designed
by educators to use instant photos as a teaching tool _ for
example, by having children take pictures and write about them. The
aim is ``to teach kids,'' he said, although the program does make a
profit through camera and film sales.
   ``There's no question that it is out of our marketing division,
and we have no embarrassment about that,'' Johnson said.
``Obviously, it is a market to which we sell.''
   At American Home Products, owner of the Chef Boyardee brand,
spokeswoman Linda Mulrenan said she wanted to see the report before
commenting.
   Among other issues it raised, the report criticized children's
shopping clubs. ``Kids voluntarily join (and usually pay for) a
vehicle that will do little more than advertise to them
regularly,'' it said.
   It suggested that children join such clubs because ``they like
the idea of `belonging to.''' Generally, it said children are not
sophisticated enough to spot hidden advertising or to reject goods
that are overpriced, poorly made or of little use.
   ``Advertising to kids should be designed to respect their
special nature _ their openness, inexperience and vulnerability to
peer pressure,'' said Charlotte Baecher, a Consumers Union official.
   The report proposed designating schools as ``commercial-free
zones,'' having children's magazines refuse ads disguised as
editorial matter, improving regulation of children's shopping clubs
and banning liquor and tobacco companies from paying to place their
products in movies.
   Consumers Union publishes Consumer Reports magazine and a
similar publication for children, Zillions. Neither accepts ads.

   Commuters raced through the Hollywood Freeway
today over part of a subway tunnel that was devastated by a blaze.
Officials say they may have to excavate the site to find what
sparked the fire.
   The state Department of Transportation opened three out of four
southbound lanes Tuesday afternoon and the five northbound lanes
opened earlier Tuesday. The last lane will probably remain closed
for several days because it was closest to the Metro Rail tunnel
that burned and collapsed last week, said Margie Tiritilli, a
Caltrans spokeswoman.
   ``We have to be sure the workers are safe,'' she said.
``Vibrations from the traffic could cause crumbling. It's still a
little unstable.''
   The 1{-mile section of U.S. 101 remains closed to large trucks,
Tiritilli said. California Highway Patrol officers were stationed
to enforce the rule.
   Meanwhile, investigators with the district attorney's office and
the city fire department said they may have to excavate a 100-foot
collapsed section of the tunnel to determine the cause of Friday's
fire.
   The Metro Rail tunnel's prime contractor, John Tutor, said
Tuesday that repairs would cost between $500,000 and $1 million and
delay completion of the structure by 60 to 90 days. The original
deadline was Sept. 16.

Spira's lawyer. A longer version also moved on sports wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner told
the baseball commissioner he paid a gambler $40,000 because he
feared the man would harm him or his family, a newpaper reported
today.
   The National sports newspaper, quoting from a transcript of
Steinbrenner's hearing with commissioner Fay Vincent on July 5-6,
said Steinbrenner also feared gambler Howard Spira would reveal
information about two employees who stole from the team and on
alleged gambling habits of former Yankee player, manager and
general manager Lou Piniella, who now manages the Cincinnati Reds.
   The newspaper said Vincent repeatedly chastised Steinbrenner for
failing to contact either legal authorities or the commissioner's
office depite his avowed fear of Spira and his concern about making
a payment to a known gambler against the advice of his own legal
advisers.
   Steinbrenner said he gave Spira the money ``to get out of town.''
   Spira's lawyer, David S. Greenfield, said today that
Steinbrenner's account was unbelievable. ``This guy changes the
story about what happened more often than he changes managers,''
Greenfield said.
   Vincent said Tuesday he would cof an AM-FM radio,'' said Jason
Richards of the Ohio-based Radio Association Defending Airwave
Rights, or RADAR.
   James Baxter, head of the National Motorists Association in
Dane, Wis., which defends radar detectors and opposes the 55
mile-per-hour speed limit, said the petition is part of an effort
to get all radar detectors banned.
   Tom Donohue, president of the American Trucking Associations,
which represents 4,500 truck companies, said his group backs police
efforts to catch speeding truckers and opposes radar detectors.
   ``The only reason you'd want to have one in a truck is to drive
faster than you ought to,'' said Donohue.
   Steve Campbell, a former Louisiana state trooper who is now
safety director for the trucking group, said all major truck
companies have policies against radar detectors, although
independent operators may be using them.
   ``We want to get all the bad guys off the highways, because they
make it bad for our good guys,'' Campbell said.
   Chuck Hurley of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said
opponents of the detectors have little hope of an all-out ban but
believe the Bush administration might support a ban for commercial
vehicles under statutes that allow the federal government to
regulate equipment on interstate trucks.
   ``We think there is a much more enlightened attitude'' on the
part of Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and other
officials, he said.
   Also signing the petition were the Advocates for Highway and
Auto Safety, Public Citizen and the National Association of
Governors' Highway Safety Representatives. Hurley said the
inclusion of state safety officials should overcome any
administration view that detector bans should be left to the states.
   The Reagan administration turned down a similar petition in
1988, citing that argument.
   Hurley acknowledged that there is no study linking detectors
directly to accidents. But he pointed to studies tying speed to
highway deaths and a new institute survey finding that truckers
using radar detectors are more likely than those without detectors
to drive faster than 70 mph.
   The study was based on the use of a new detector that can
identify vehicles using the units.
   The institute's checks of highways in seven states showed usage
of detectors by tractor-trailer trucks ranging from 37 percent in
Virginia, where detectors are outlawed, to 52 percent in Delaware.
   Other results included 38 percent in Maryland and New York; 40
percent for Connecticut, where they also are outlawed; 41 percent
in New Jersey and 46 percent in Pennsylvania.
   All of the surveyed states have a 55 mph speed limit for trucks.

<HEAD>West German, Czechoslovak Presidents to Meet Waldheim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The presidents of West Germany and
Czechoslovakia will meet with Kurt Waldheim on July 26, ending four
years of virtual isolation for the Austrian head of state from
foreign leaders, officials said today.
   Cypriot President Georgios Vassiliou has been the only Western
head of state to officially visit the Austrian president, who has
been shunned by foreign officials for concealing his past as a
German intelligence officer in World War II. The meeting with
Vassiliou occurred early in July.
   President Richard von Weizsaecker of West Germany and his
Czechoslovak counterpart, Vaclav Havel, will see Waldheim during
the opening of the annual Salzburg Festival, said Kurt Skalnik,
Waldheim's spokesman.
   Havel comes to Salzburg as a ``writer and private person'' to
act as keynote speaker at the festival's opening ceremony, a
festival organizer said.
   Havel's arrival had been in doubt. The Prague daily Lidove
Noviny reported today he would refrain from the trip to Austria.
But the Czechoslovak state news agency CTK said the report was
incorrect. It quoted Havel's press spokesman as saying the
president would visit Salzburg as planned.
   Both Skalnik and a presidential spokesman in Bonn said von
Weizsaecker and Waldheim were expected to meet on the occasion.
   Waldheim, a former U.N. secretary-general, came under fire at
home and abroad for initially concealing his wartime service in
Yugoslavia and Greece as an intelligence officer serving with the
invading army of Nazi Germany.
   An international commission of historians, in a report issued in
February 1987, did not confirm allegations Waldheim was implicated
in war crimes, but said he must have known about wartime atrocities
committed by his unit.
   Waldheim has consistently denied any wrongdoing. He has insisted
the charges, made by the World Jewish Congress and other
international critics, were designed to prevent his election as
president and, later, to force him to resign.
   The Vienna daily Die Presse reported von Weizsaecker and Havel
will travel by helicopter to Salzburg from Bayreuth, where they
will attend the music festival associated with the composer Richard
Wagner.

<HEAD>Alison Leggatt, British Avant-Garde Actress, Dead at 86</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alison Leggatt, an actress of London's avant-garde
movement who won renown portraying characters in plays by John
Osborne and Harold Pinter, has died, her family said today. She was
86.
   She died in London on Sunday. No cause of death was given.
   Alison Joy Seetah Leggatt became an actress against the wishes
of her well-to-do parents. Her mother refused ever to see her act,
considering the stage unsuitable for a well-bred young woman.
   Her performance in Miles Malleson's ``The Fanatics'' in 1927
established her as one of the most promising theatrical newcomers
of her generation.
   Though never a romantic actress, Leggatt knew how to wring tears
and smiles from the audience. From portraying upper-crust young
ladies, she branched into a wide variety of roles. The Times of
London obituary described her as ``a statuesque and formidably
funny character actress.''
   During the 1930s, she appeared in Noel Coward's ``Cavalcade,''
playing a honeymooning wife on the Titanic just before it struck
the iceberg. She also toured with six Coward one-act plays
collectively entitled ``Tonight at 7:30,'' playing six very
different young girls and old women. She also acted in plays by
Clifford Bax and J.B. Priestley.
   After World War II, she was Lavinia in T.S. Eliot's ``The

   Five bomb-squad experts trying to dig up and
destroy a cache of World War II artillery shells were killed today
when plastic explosives they were using detonated accidentally.
   The men were part of a special security force unit dispatched to
help dispose of more than 2,660 German shells found this month
along a roadway outside Epervans, south of Dijon in east-central
France.
   Investigators said the plastic explosives were to be used to
destroy the latest batch of shells dug up from the site. It was not
immediately known what caused the blast of the plastic explosives.
   A civilian driving a bulldozer suffered slight burns and was
hosptialized. He was reported in good condition.
   Interior Minister Pierre Joxe said he would visit the mortuary
where the victims were taken to pay his respects. The names of
those killed were not immediately released.
   A 20-year-old man from the town was killed by a shell on May 21,
and authorities began to investigate whether more of the 20mm and
37mm shells might remain buried in the area.
   On July 9, a major clearance operation was launched. Since then,
according to town officials, 2,668 have been dug up and destroyed.
   Most of the shells were in a concentrated area, and a security
fence had been erected to keep the public away.
   According to official records, 608 members of the special
explosives unit have been killed since it was created in 1945 to
dispose of mines, bombs and shells left over from the war.
   About 500 of the deaths, along with 800 injuries, occurred in
the first two years of the unit's operations. During those years,
the unit neutralized roughly 13 million mines, 6 million shells and
90,000 bombs.
   The unit, made up of 125 men at 19 regional centers, also has
been used to defuse explosives placed by terrorists.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in a letter made
public today, said that even though the United States has broken
off direct contact with the PLO, it has urged Britain to maintain
ties with the group.
   ``We do not think it would be wise to break off our contacts
with the PLO. Indeed, the Americans have urged us to maintain
them,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in a letter to British Jewish leaders.
   The United States suspended its dialogue with the Palestine
Liberation Organization after it failed to explicitly condemn a
Palestinian raid on an Israeli beach in May.
   The president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews had urged
Mrs. Thatcher to do the same. The group made public the letter she
wrote in response.
   It said the PLO had failed to condemn the attack and punish
those behind it, but added: ``They have dissociated themselves from
the attack and reaffirmed their strategy of moderation.''
   ``We are no less opposed than the United States administration
to terrorism,'' she wrote.
   But the prime minister said that in order for progress to be
made toward Mideast peace, Israel will have to talk to ``credible
representatives of the Palestinian people from inside and outside''
the Israeli-occupied territories, including the PLO.
   ``Too many Palestinians owe their allegiance to the PLO for a
solution which excludes them to be durable,'' she wrote.

<HEAD>Sudan Laying off 10 Percent of Government Work Force</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudan, struggling to fight a huge budget
deficit and move toward a market economy, said today it will lay
off about 50,000 government workers within a month.
   The move, which will reduce the government work force by 10
percent, is part of a three-year economic reform program launched
last month.
   The package included increases of up to 50 percent in the prices
of commodities including gasoline, tea and cigarettes.
   Sudan's economic woes have been compounded by a 7-year-old civil
war that is costing the government an estimated $1 million a day.
The country owes about $13 billion to foreign creditors.
   In 1986, the International Monetary Fund declared Sudan
ineligible for further loans. At the time, it was $220 million in
arrears to the IMF.
   Sudan has since tried to get back into the IMF's good graces
through belt-tightening reforms, including the new economic
program. But the government insists the reforms are not due to
international pressure.
   Finance and Economic Planning Minister Abdel-Rahim Hamdi said
the layoffs of government workers will save about $130 million a
year.
   He told a meeting of government economic experts that the
workers to be laid off will come from all government ministries
except public health, education and security.
   He said the government also was considering plans to encourage
early retirement and leaves without pay.

<TEXT>
   Another co-defendant of former Panamanian leader
Manuel Noriega was in custody today after Panamanian authorities
extradited him to face drug-trafficking charges.
   Amet Paredes, son of former top Panamanian military official and
Noriega rival Gen. Ruben Dario Paredes, arrived Tuesday in Miami,
but federal authorities refused to release further details.
   Paredes' attorney, Joel Rosenthal, said his client turned
himself over to Drug Enforcement Administration officials in Panama
on Tuesday morning.
   ``Basically it's time to get this thing behind him one way or
another,'' Rosenthal said.
   A February 1988 indictment alleges that Paredes smuggled cocaine
from Panama to the United States and arranged protection for other
drug trafficking activities with Noriega. If convicted on all
counts, he faces 95 years in prison and $1,025,000 in fines.
   Amet is the seventh defendant arrested in the Noriega case. One
has pleaded guilty and the others, including Noriega, are awaiting
trial.
   Noriega surrendered Jan. 4 to the U.S. force that invaded Panama
and is being held on charges of accepting $4.6 million in bribes
from Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to turn Panama into a way
station for U.S.-bound cocaine.
   Published reports in March said federal authorities were trying
to negotiate with Paredes' father for testimony against Noriega,
and were offering a plea bargain for the son, but the U.S.
attorney's office refused comment.
   Rosenthal did not deny negotiations had taken place, but said
there was no plea bargain and that his client would plead innocent.
   Rosenthal said Paredes had been living at home until he turned
himself in Tuesday. Asked why U.S. authorities had not arrested
Paredes in the seven months since the U.S. invasion of Panama,
Rosenthal said: ``ask the DEA.''
   DEA spokesman John Fernandes said that by policy the federal
government refuses any comment on the Noriega case.
   In 1983, the elder Paredes attempted to become the leader of
Panama, but Noriega derailed the effort by withholding the
military's support.
   According to the indictment, Amet Paredes used his connections
with Noriega and another man, Cesar Rodriguez, to obtain protection
for drug shipments to the United States.
   Rodriguez and Amet's brother, Ruben Dario Paredes-Jimenez, were
killed outside Medellin, Colombia, in 1986. The two men were trying
to make arrangements with the Medellin cartel to acquire a load of
cocaine, the government says.

   African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela returned home today after declaring his
six-week tour of three continents a ``tremendous success.''
   He arrived on a Mozambique Airlines Boeing 737 more than two
hours late at Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport, where about 100
supporters waited to greet him on his 72nd birthday.
   Mandela visited 14 nations in Europe, North America and Africa.
He told reporters in Mozambique that he had achieved all his goals:
urging foreign governments to maintain sanctions against South
Africa, raising funds for the ANC and explaining the goals of his
movement.
   The Mozambican national news agency, AIM, said the two-hour
delay in returning home was caused by technical difficulties with a
Soviet-made aircraft loaned to Mandela by Mozambican President
Joaquim Chissano.
   Mandela and his entourage left for Johannesburg aboard a Boeing
737 of the Mozambique national airline, LAM.
   Mandela, the ANC's deputy president, was freed by the South
African government in February after 27 years in prison. He was
serving a life sentence for plotting sabotage to overthrow the
white government.
   Mandela has defended the ANC's policies of armed struggle and
majority rule. But he also said everything was negotiable with the
government of President F.W. de Klerk, which recently began a
reform program aimed at improving the lot of the nation's black
majority.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the
United States and abroad.
   July 15
   From The Providence (R.I.) Sunday Journal on the economic summit:
   For years, the United States, Canada and some other big food
exporters have battled to get Europeans to reduce or eliminate the
web of tariffs, export subsidies, price supports and other
protections that maintain the jobs of millions of their small and
inefficient, but politically powerful, farmers.
   The European Community's agricultural system costs Europeans as
much as $100 billion a year, and seriously distorts world trade,
but it is politically almost sacrosanct _ a kind of Fortress
Europe. ...
   Leaders at the allied summit in Houston agreed, more clearly
than ever before, that agriculture subsidies and other protections
should be phased out. Especially important is that for the first
time, Europeans specifically promised to reduce their price
supports, export subsidies and tariffs. And all the participants
said they would go to a common instrument of measure, which should
make it easier to reduce and regulate agricultural protectionism.
...
   The First World, including Europe, desperately wants these
changes, and the fact that Europeans have just now agreed to
specific revisions in agricultural policies is no coincidence. For
without a major reduction in agricultural protectionism,
(international trade negotiations) may very easily collapse. ...
   The Houston summit may have well be seen as a major step toward
draining the EC Wine Lake, tearing down its Cheese Mountain, and
creating the groundwork for a prosperous decade.

   Philadelphia Daily News on the federal death penalty:
   If you ever need an idea reduced to absolute idiocy, run it
through the United States Congress.
   The Honorables have been reading polls showing that Americans
care very little about government, even about thievery on the
grandest scale ever.
   The polls also show there's only one thing we care about. We are
frustrated and want to act on that frustration. So we want to
execute somebody. Anybody.
   The Honorables ... tacked the death penalty onto virtually
everything that's illegal. The so-called omnibus crime law should
lead to wholesale slaughter unseen since the Romans dragged
unfortunates into lion cages for the entertainment of the populace.
   Don't fear a veto, death fans. George Bush has never been a man
to let principles stand in the way of a few cheap votes. This could
mean many cheap votes.
   He may even pull the switch to open the annual execution
festival.

   Long Beach (Calif.) Press-Telegram on the Senate's anti-crime
bill:
   What's so bad about the Senate's Omnibus Crime Bill? Mainly that
it proposes to fight crime with symbols and half-steps and
temporary twitches. It bans, for example, the sale or manufacture
of nine kinds of semiautomatic weapons for three years, language
that is touted as a major defeat for the National Rifle
Association. ... But a temporary ban must be only a temporary
solution, and in any event the Senate list is too short. ...
   Some provisions are indisputably laudable. One specifically
targets the crooks behind the S&amp;L crisis. Another provides
scholarships for students who will agree to work in law enforcement
for four years after graduating from college. Another provides $900
million in extra funds for state and local law enforcement
agencies. ...
   To control crime effectively, you must control more than nine
kinds of semiautomatics. You must control all weapons, especially
their sale and ownership.

   The Record, Hackensack, N.J. on Mayor Marion Barry:
   No matter how many witnesses the defense calls in the month-old
drug and perjury trial of Mayor Marion Barry of Washington, D.C.,
it will be hard to erase the images called to mind with the
devastating testimony of prosecution witnesses. The mayor taking
drugs in hotel rooms, restaurants, and private homes; the mayor
having drugs delivered to his office; the mayor of the nation's
capital at the mercy of a devouring addiction that went on for
years.
   Maybe Barry was too far gone to help himself long before he
ended up in a hotel room surrounded by federal agents. The question
really isn't whether the government's sting operation was
justified. The question is why all these so-called friends of the
mayor didn't help him sooner. He didn't need their drugs. He needed
help.

   Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail on prosecuting prominent black
politicians:
   NAACP Director Benjamin Hooks has called for an end to what he
labels a campaign of ``harassment'' and selective prosecution of
prominent black politicians, including Washington, D.C., Mayor
Marion Barry.
   He cites a list of investigations of other black leaders,
including Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, New York Mayor David
Dinkins and Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania. ...
   It would be nice to think that no elected officials, black or
white, would go astray. But the odds are that some will, no matter
what race, color or sex they are. There are plenty of white
officials who have been investigated and found guilty of wrongdoing.
   In making his charge, Hooks shows no evidence that black leaders
are being singled out for scrutiny. There probably is an argument
that prosecutors like to go after big names and certainly being the
mayor of New York, Los Angeles or Washington, D.C., constitutes
being a celebrity.
   However, that in itself shows progress in civil rights. These
black leaders were chosen by a racially mixed population. There was
a day when that wouldn't have happened.
   There is a responsibility that goes with holding high government
positions. Some leaders live up to what is expected and others
don't. Indeed, there is a long list of successful black politicians.
   But when Hooks makes a racial issue out of those few who falter,
he tends to detract from the many other blacks who have entered
politics and succeeded.

   The son of a former Wesleyan University
faculty member and cousin of a man accused of killing a school
activist has been charged with firebombing an office at the elite
private school.
   Sudhama Ranganathan, 18, of Middletown, was identified by police
sources as the suspect in the April 7 firebombing, one of two in
the past three months. Ranganathan's father, Tanjore Ranganathan,
who died in 1987, was an artist in residence at Wesleyan for more
than 15 years, teaching South Indian music.
   According to the federal arrest warrant, which was seen by two
reporters before it was sealed, Ranganathan is accused of
maliciously damaging and destroying and attempting to damage the
office of Wesleyan President William Chace. The warrant also
accused him of receiving and possessing a firearm that was not
registered to him.
   Ranganathan was a friend of Nicholas Haddad, a 21-year-old
Wesleyan student who was found shot to death July 6 in his car with
a cache of semiautomatic weapons and ammunition. Police said
Haddad, a militant minority rights activist on campus, was killed
by his two partners in a drug distribution ring.
   One of the men charged in Haddad's death, Kumar Viswanathan, is
Ranganathan's cousin. Viswanathan's father, Tanjore Viswanathan,
has been on the faculty at Wesleyan since 1975, also as an artist
in residence in South Indian music.
   The first bombing burned the rug and floor of Chace's office and
caused extensive smoke damage. The second firebombing, on April 29,
caused slight damage to the outside of the Wesleyan boathouse.
Police have not revealed whether they believe Ranganathan was
involved in the second firebombing.
   Ranganathan was arrested Tuesday in Middletown and taken to
federal court in New Haven, and was later released.
   All court proceedings were closed, and all papers in his case
sealed, because he was 17 at the time of his alleged crime.

   The Hubble telescope has a blind spot, the shuttle fleet is

one for reckless behavior by participating in a pylon race in New
Braunfels (Texas) in which an accident cost a racer his life.
There's not been much good news for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration lately. A lot of that is NASA's fault, not for
errors of commission so much as for errors of omission.
   After getting over the shock of the Challenger disaster, it
appeared that the agency was again a going concern. But NASA is now
coming under political fire and experiencing a loss of public
trust. It certainly cannot afford either. ...
   Something is basically amiss at the space agency, and more
hearings are certainly warranted. Perhaps it's time to ``stand
down'' and take a hard look from the outside and find the problems
before proceeding. Social problems are here and now. Space can wait
until we learn to do it right.

   A federal government study concludes that an occasional
in-flight nap helps pilots to cope with the tensions of landing

no one relishes the idea of the pilot sawing wood up there in the
cockpit of a jetliner trundling 300 people through the sky.
   Reflection suggests that maybe it's not so bad, after all,
encouraging the pilot to catch 40 winks now and again to keep his
brain alert and his reflexes sharp. One consideration does come to
mind _ call it a caveat addressed to the cabin crew: Don't take
your naps all at the same time, boys; leave someone awake to mind

   Joplin (Mo.) Globe on AIDS funding:
   Every once in a while there is a demonstration protesting
governmental neglect of AIDS, like the one that was staged in
Washington in June. But the federal government has not been
neglectful. Actually, response by Washington to the AIDS outbreak
has been unprecedented. Billions of dollars have been spent for
treatment, research and testing.
   This year alone, $1.69 billion has been requested, which far
exceeds budgets of other diseases claiming many times more lives as
AIDS. Expenditures since 1981, when the disease was first
identified, have been huge and hugely disproportionate. AIDS has
killed 83,000 Americans in nine years. Heart disease kills that
many every six weeks. ...
   AIDS victims deserve care and treatment. But it is hard to see
from where they derive the claim to be first in line, ahead of
those dying of leukemia and breast cancer and stroke, for the
resources and compassion of a nation.

   The Greenwood (Miss.) Commonwealth on the Soviet Union:
   For 11 days, 4,700 delegates to the Soviet Communist Party
Congress met. The party leader and Soviet president, Mikhail
Gorbachev, has been catching it from all sides. ...
   These Communist Party meetings used to be behind closed doors.
They have become much more interesting to Americans now that
they're open to the world's press. Soviet politicians are speaking
out and Soviet people are arguing and squabbling just about like
everybody else.
   As the party meeting began, criticism against Gorbachev came
from those who oppose his reforms. The old party hacks gave him
unshirted hell, and it began to appear that he was going to be
dumped.
   Then Gorbachev ... was re-elected general secretary by an easy
3-to-1 margin. The party was intact again, one reason being there
was no real challenger to Gorbachev, and no alternative to the
Communist Party which has tightly ruled the country since 1917. Or
so it seemed.
   Then came Boris Yeltsin's bombshell _ Yeltsin the one-time
Gorbachev protege and former Politburo member who Gorbachev fired
as Moscow party leader three years ago. ...
   Yeltsin announced ... he was quitting the Communist Party. He
said he no longer could be guided by the party alone. ``I must obey
the will of the people.'' ...
   Gorbachev, we'd say, continues to live dangerously, walking a
tight rope between change and stability. How will it all turn out?
Stay tuned. Mother Russia is proving to be more impervious to
sweeping change than Eastern Europe.

   It's hard to draw any other conclusion given the events of the

   Again, (Soviet President Mikhail) Gorbachev seems almost to be
preparing the way, as in his lifting ... of the party's grip on the
state-run media. ... The state of the Communist Party is such that
it's not even a certainty it can survive thus being deprived of
such an important propaganda tool.
   Place on top of all this the deteriorating economy, and
communism's fate is uncertain indeed. The Soviet Union rapidly is
moving beyond the need for more reform. What the Party Congress and
its aftermath really have been about is revolution.

   President George Bush is not in the habit of asking China to
eliminate its more serious human rights abuses, so he probably
won't like the bill sponsored by Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell that would tie human rights to the continuance of
most-favored-nation status for China.
   The president appears determined to ignore how badly misguided
are the current U.S. policies toward the government of China,
despite ample evidence of China's brutal human rights record, its
arms sales to the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, and its refusal to allow
free emigration. By defending the most-favored-nation status for
China, the president betrays the courageous Beijing protesters who
sought democracy and tells the world that the United States places
economics above human rights.

   A man who spent three weeks adrift in a
small boat says his girlfriend apparently died while trying to swim
to safety.
   Lawrence Majid returned to Darwin on Wednesday, his 33rd
birthday, on a flight from Indonesia.
   He and Polly May Namai had set out more than two months ago in a
13-foot aluminum dinghy for the short trip from Cape York to
Thursday Island. Their boat ran out of fuel and drifted for three
weeks before it washed up hundreds of miles away on Indonesia's
remote Aru Islands.
   ``We found that our spare fuel had been stolen and we could do
little else but drift,'' he said in a statement released by his
attorneys. ``We had nothing with us. No food, just the clothes we
had with us.''
   He said Ms. Namai, 29, jumped overboard in a bid to swim to
shore after potential rescuers left them to drift.
   ``Eleven days out, we came across a Taiwanese boat traveling
east,'' Majid said. ``They gave us a bit of food and drink, but no
fuel we could use. They refused to take us on board.
   ``Just before sunset, Polly jumped overboard saying she wanted
to swim to Bamaga. I threw rope to her, and tried to call her back
but she didn't stop.''
   He said that afterward, he lived on fish until he finally
arrived in Indonesia. Majid said he was exhausted and wanted a long

   Authorities say they have seized about 41.8 tons of pure cocaine
so far this year. The figure for all of 1989 was 36.3 tons.
   U.S. officials say cocaine street prices in the United States
have gone up in recent months, indicating a drop in supply.
Colombia's Cali and Medellin cocaine cartels supply an estimated 80
percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States.

   Police launched a nationwide manhunt for
seven gunmen who seized about $220,000 in a daring suburban bank
robbery Wednesday.
   The robbers, posing as customers, entered the Peristeri branch
of the ErgoBank at 8:50 a.m. and pulled off the raid in less then
10 minutes, a police official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity in line with practice.
   ``Nobody suspected a thing until one of them pulled a gun. They
had their weapons hidden in travel bags,'' an employee of the bank
told police.
   The robbers, brandishing automatic weapons and pistols, quickly
rounded up the bank's 25 employees and 10 to 15 customers and then
emptied cash drawers and the safe, police said.
   They stashed the money in their travel bags and sped off in a
van.
   Police declined to speculate on who could be responsible, but
another branch of the ErgoBank had been robbed last year. Police at
that time blamed an urban terrorist group.

   Five members of a gang that befriended young
women at dance halls, abducted them and then sold them into
marriage have been executed in the southwestern city of Chengdu,
said official reports seen Wednesday.
   In east coast city of Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, eight people
were sentenced to death for robbery and murder.
   The death sentences were among hundreds handed down so far this
year as China goes through one of its periodic anti-crime
campaigns. The campaigns have failed to halt a rising crime rate.
   China Women's News said the Chengdu gang sold 55 women, ages 14
to 20, netting more than $11,915. All but six of the women were
rescued by police from villages hundreds of miles away in northern
China's Shanxi province, where they were sold into marriage.
   Of the 19 gang members, 17 were arrested and 15 were put on
trial. Five were given death sentences on June 28, and they were
immediately executed with a bullet to the back of the head, it
said. Ten others were given sentences ranging from life in prison
to three years.
   Last fall, authorities ordered a crackdown on what they labeled
the ``six evils'' _ selling women and children, gambling,
prostitution, feudal superstition, pornography and drugs.

   A clothing vendor was sentenced to
death by the High Court Wednesday for trafficking in 30 ounces of
cannabis.
   Yusof Zulfi, 27, was convicted of committing the offense at a
coffee shop in Pasir Mas, 240 miles northeast of here on July 27,
1986, the national news agency Bernama reported.
   Justice Idris Yusoff said the court had no doubt that Zulfi was
guilty and the court had no alternative but to impose the mandatory
death sentence, Bernama reported.
   Since laws were passed in 1975 requiring the death sentence for
drug trafficking, 257 people have been sentenced to death. Of
these, 92 people have been hanged. Others are awaiting dates for
hanging or appeals.

   A murder defendant who suddenly slugged his
attorney as stunned jurors watched was granted a new trial by a
judge who warned: ``This is going to be the one and only time you
can pull this shenanigan.''
   Jeffrey Jason Miller, 29, had been on trial Tuesday for
first-degree murder in the Oct. 27 slaying of a rural restaurant
owner.
   During opening arguments, when attorney Craig Alldredge was
returning from the judge's bench to the defense table, Miller
jumped from his chair and knocked his attorney into an easel.
   A bailiff grabbed Miller in a headlock and dragged him out of
the courtroom.
   Judge Robert Bonanno later declared a mistrial.
   ``The next time that you pull something like this, you will be
restrained and if you continue to cause a disturbance, you will sit
it out in the lockup,'' the judge said.
   Miller was charged in the slaying of Minerva Lou Connell, 55,
who was abducted from her Crystal Springs restaurant during an
apparent robbery. Her body was found three days later.

<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 12 grafs to UPDATE weather better in Idaho, Utah
fires almost out. Picks up 11th graf, `The blaze...' SUBS last graf

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Reduced wind gave firefighters in eastern Oregon a boost in
battling forest fires and better weather today helped their
counterparts in Idaho hold the line against blazes there.
   The largest blaze in Oregon was the 1,060-acre Corral Basin fire
22 miles southwest of John Day but officials were confident of
stopping it.
   ``It's been a lucky day for us. We were really worried the
erratic winds would whip up the fire but they died down and
actually helped us in spots,'' Heidi Bigler of the U.S. Forest
Service said Tuesday.
   Forests also burned in Montana and Washington state and a new,
small fire was reported in Yellowstone National Park. More than 100
fires continued in the vast interior of Alaska. But fires in Utah
were reduced to hot spots.
   The Corral Basin fire was 60 percent contained with fewer spot
fires than Monday, when gusty wind sent flames shooting nearly 150
feet into the air, Bigler said. The blaze was burning in forests of
lodgepole and ponderosa pine and spruce mixed with meadows in steep
terrain.
   ``The grass is still green so the spread has been from treetop
to treetop, and hasn't really affected efforts on the ground,''
Bigler said.
   About 800 firefighters were assigned to the blaze.
   In the rugged backcountry of west-central Idaho, hundreds of
firefighters dug in today as fire bosses tried to take advantage of
improving weather conditions.
   After wind-whipped flames obliterated fire lines early Tuesday,
crews managed to hold their own against the wildfire over night.
   ``It looks like it laid down pretty well and there's a little
more humidity today,'' Boise National Forest spokesman Ken Kiser
said.
   The nightly mapping flight with infrared cameras showed no
growth in the fire that nearly quadrupled in size 24 hours earlier,
driven by high temperatures, low humidity and gusting winds.
   The blaze was started by a lightning strike Sunday.
   About 75 mostly small fires started last week by lightning
continue to burn this week in Oregon and Washington, said Ralph
Satterberg of the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center in
Portland.
   The largest fire in Washington state was the 900-acre
Yellowjacket fire in a remote area of the Gifford Pinchot National
Forest, Satterberg said.
   In Montana, more than 1,000 firefighters remained on the fire
line as officials try to minimize damage from the Gird Point fire
to a scenic mountain roadway between Hamilton and Philipsburg.
   The wind slackened Tuesday after more than quadrupling the size
of the fire the day before and by evening the 2,500-acre fire had
slowed considerably, said Bitterroot National Forest fire
information officer Bill Rockwell.
   Elsewhere, while nearly a week of rain in Alaska's interior gave
firefighters a needed break, the return of warm and dry conditions
had state and federal lands officials warily watching the weather.
   Despite the rain, 115 fires continued to burn in Alaska, down
from a high of more than 200 last week, said Sue Mitchell, a
spokeswoman for the federal Bureau of Land Management.
   In Utah, firefighters remained on the scene of a brush fire in
the foothills of the Oquirrh Mountains today in case winds
rekindled a 1,500-acre blaze that previously threatened homes in
the area.
   ``Basically, everything has been taken care of. All we're doing
is keeping crews there to monitor and watch for any hot spots that
might flare up in the wind. We just want to be sure it doesn't
rekindle,'' said Assistant Salt Lake County Fire Chief John Corak.

   The printing press and ornate lobby are real,
and so is the city editor's desk. The gunshots and blood are not.
   Movie makers are finding a bonanza in the unusual settings of
the Spanish Renaissance landmark that once housed the Los Angeles
Herald Examiner.
   At least a dozen productions, not counting commercials, have
been filmed at the domed building since the newspaper folded on
Nov. 2, 1989, according to city permit files.
   Clint Eastwood moved in for Warner Bros.' soon-to-be-released
movie ``The Rookie.'' So did Universal's ``Murder, She Wrote.''
   ``It's really an ideal place for filming,'' said Ken Johnson,
site coordinator for The Hollywood Location Co. ``There's such a
wide variety of spaces and looks ... directors of photography just
love the windows in the mail room.''
   Completed in 1915, the faded pink palace was designed by Julia
Morgan, who created William Randolph Hearst's Castle at San Simeon.
It sprawls over more than half a city block.
   Movie and commercial making will continue at least into the
fall, said Maxwell McCrohon, the former Herald Examiner editor. He
said the parent Hearst Corp. had no plans to sell it but was
considering renting it to full-time tenants.
   The ornate lobby has been an exclusive men's club and a hotel. A
stenciled notice to inmates makes a newsroom pass for a prison
dayroom. Around the corner, there's a detective squad room; you can
tell by the ``Robbery-Homicide'' plate on the city editor's desk.
   Sometimes the building shapes a movie.
   ``Occasionally they'll still be writing when they scout a
location and see something with such good production values that
they'll rewrite the script to get it in,'' said Johnson.
   He said a look at the row of hulking presses was enough to send
script writers back to work on the TV movie ``Rainbow Drive.'' The
bad guy wound up meeting his end being crunched in Press No. 9,
still grimy with Herald Examiner ink.

   The Mahopac automobile dealer provided a 1990 Lincoln Town Car

   Saturday, he won the car.
   DeFranco, who had sold the car to the department at a reduced

startled by this win: He had bought 200 raffle tickets.
   A bemused Fire Chief Thomas Tornatore turned over the keys to
DeFranco, who drove off in the $30,000 car. The dealer said he will

   Just 90 minutes into his new job, a car salesman
was accosted at knifepoint by his first customers _ 19-year-old
twins who stole the car they wanted to test-drive, police said.
   The thieves led police on a 12-mile chase before they were
stopped and arrested on suspicion of armed robbery.
   ``It's sure a different way of starting a job,'' said the
salesman, Steve Sacry.
   Sacry took the two young men on a test drive in a car they
liked, then stopped a half-block away and got out to let one of
them behind the wheel.
   One of them pulled a 6-inch blade and told him: ``You're not
getting back in the car.''
   The police pursuit of the two ended with a chain-reaction
collision on Interstate 5 that backed up traffic for three miles.
   After talking to police, Sacry took the rest of the day off.
   ``I guess it can only get better from here,'' Sacry said.

   Czechoslovak embassies are
spy-free but have been so only since June 30, Deputy Foreign
Minister Lubos Dobrovsky said Wednesday.
   Dobrovsky, reacting to reports that two Czechoslovaks were
expelled from the Netherlands earlier this year for trying to get
NATO documents, said all Czechoslovak missions were free of
intelligence agents as of the end of last month.
   Under the Communists, East European countries used their
missions as espionage centers. Dobrovsky said the situation was the
same in Czechoslovakia, but ``one of the first acts of Foreign
Minister Jiri Dienstbier was the decision to recall all those
officials.''
   The recalls were gradual, but ``non-diplomatic activities,''
were stopped immediately, Dobrovsky stressed.
   ``Now, there are only employees of Foreign Ministry at our
embassies,'' he said.
   He did not go into details on the activities of the two
Czechoslovaks removed from the Netherlands, but said their
departure was a Czechoslovak decision and was not prompted by a
Dutch request.
   A Dutch Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said earlier this week that
one of the diplomats left early this year and the other in early
June after their recall was requested by the Dutch government.

   President Bush met with Republican senators
today and gave his backing to a new GOP proposal that would avoid
quotas in a major civil rights bill against job discrimination, the
lawmakers said.
   ``The president wants to sign a bill and he wants us to work it
out,'' said Sen. John C. Danforth, an author of the proposed
compromise.
   Danforth said Bush has supported his plan, but he refused to
give specifics.
   Bush met with Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, Danforth and
Sens. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and James Jeffords of Vermont
in an effort to rekindle the negotiations with Democrats led by
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and civil rights leaders.
   ``The whole message here was, `Do it. Get it done.' If there is
any possible way to work out an agreement for a bill that the
president can sign, we are supposed to do that,'' said Danforth.
   On Tuesday, the White House renewed a veto threat against the
Kennedy civil rights bill unless it is shorn of what Bush regards
as quotas.

<TEXT>
   Bush, in a speech before the National Council of La Raza, told
the Hispanic group, ``We renew the fight for a civil rights bill
today. I need your help to make the changes needed to ensure a bill
that does not result in quotas.''
   Quoting Frederick Douglass's words from 1871 that ``equality of
numbers has nothing to do with equality of attainment,'' Bush said,
``We all know quotas aren't right. They're not fair. They divide
society instead of bringing people together.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Specter told reporters, ``Our instructions from the president
were to go back to work and solve the problem and we are determined
to do that.''
   He said all sides agree on the need to overturn last year's
Supreme Court ruling in the Wards Cove case that narrowed
protection against job bias and to return to the earlier Supreme
Court interpretation that had prevailed since 1971.
   Bush has said the Kennedy bill would force employers to resort
to job-hiring quotas to protect themselves against discrimination
suits by disgruntled workers.
   The heart of the dispute is over defining when business
necessity justifies hiring practices that may result in low numbers
of minority workers.
   The Senate, after a bitter debate Thursday, voted 62-38 earlier
to limit debate on the civil rights bills. That brought an angry
reaction from Dole, who said Republicans were being muzzled. The
two sides later returned to the bargaining table.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu scurried to Capitol Hill
Tuesday night for talks with Kennedy and others that stretched past
midnight, but failed to produce a compromise.
   Sununu complained Tuesday that Kennedy had reneged on a deal
struck with the administration last week. Kennedy denied they had
signed off on a deal.
   Provisions of the bill range from a ban on racial harassment in
the workplace to punitive damages for victims of intentional
discrimination.
   Most controversial has been a provision that would make it
easier to bring a court challenge to any company with an employee
work force that does not mirror the racial and ethnic makeup of the
local labor pool.
   A company then would have to prove that its hiring practices
were justified by business necessity. That would overcome the most
controversial of five 1989 Supreme Court rulings on job bias
addressed by the bill.
   The high court, in a case involving a salmon cannery in Alaska,
ruled that it was up to the plaintiffs to prove the practices were
not motivated by business necessity.
   Critics, including the administration and business groups, say
the bill would encourage employers to use hiring quotas to avoid
being sued.

   A prostitute quoted in Newsweek as saying
she continued selling sex despite being infected with AIDS was
released from jail after prosecutors chose not to pursue attempted
murder charges.
   ``End of case,'' said a public defender, Donald Greenberg, after
his client Linda Kean was freed Tuesday.
   Kean, 36, was ordered released after admitting in municipal
court to violating probation in a prostitution case. Under a plea
bargain, she was sentenced to 23 days in jail, with credit for time
already served.
   Kean, who didn't appear at the hearing, had been jailed in lieu
of $1,500 bail since her June 25 arrest in Oakland.
   The arrest came after she was featured in a Newsweek article on
AIDS. The article included a picture of the self-confessed heroin
addict posed provocatively against a lamppost. The caption quoted
Kean as saying she contracted the AIDS virus from contaminated
needles, but continued to sell sex.
   She has denied the comments but after she was released, she told
a reporter she made up the story about being infected with the AIDS
virus.
   ``I was dope sick,'' Kean told The Tribune of Oakland. ``What
did you want me to do? I needed the money.''
   A Newsweek spokeswoman today confirmed that Kean was given $60
despite a magazine policy of not paying for stories. The magazine
has stood by the story.
   ``In this case, after the photo was shot, the subject was given
$60,'' Karen Wheeler said in a statement from New York.
``Immediately after this was discovered by the top editors, they
reminded all concerned of the magazine's commitment to that
policy.''
   From the start, prosecutors were reluctant to pursue attempted
murder charges against Kean who said she now plans to move to Los
Angeles.
   ``We never really wanted the attempted murder (case), but it
kind of got laid at our doorsteps,'' said Deputy Alameda County
District Attorney James Casey. ``For one thing, it's always nice to
have a victim. And we just didn't.''
   Greenberg said, ``Even if police keep bringing cases like this I
don't think we're going to see any attempted murder charges filed
against any (AIDS infected) prostitutes unless there are some
bizarre set of facts.''
   Oakland police had pushed the case by asking a judge to force
Kean to take a test for the AIDS virus.
   The case renewed debate over a California law that requires AIDS
testing of prostitutes as a condition of probation.
   Alameda County health officials have criticized the law, which
took effect last year but has not been enforced here. San
Francisco's Municipal Court began enforcing the law on Tuesday.
   ``This is a wrongful use of a medical test,'' said Dr. Robert
Benjamin, director of the communicable disease division of the
Alameda County Health Department. ``It's punitive rather than being
preventative or educational.''
   Under the law, if prostitutes on probation test positive for the
AIDS virus and are later arrested for prostitution, they may be
charged with a felony and face several years in prison if convicted.
   Usually, prostitution is a misdemeanor that can bring jail time
if there are prior convictions.
   ``The policy is discriminatory as well,'' Benjamin said. ``If
the goal is to stop the spread of AIDS shouldn't we be testing the
`johns' too? They could be spreading AIDS even easier than the
prostitutes.''

<TEXT>
   Fierce battles raged Wednesday in the
south between rival Shiite Moslem factions, and the PLO warned it
will evict the pro-Iranian Hezbollah from a hilltop village unless
it withdraws in 24 hours.
   Police said at least 64 Shiites have been killed and 218 wounded
in three days of fighting between the fundamentalist Hezbollah, or
Party of God, and the more secular Amal, backed by Syria.
   Six Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas were wounded by
Hezbollah fire on a Palestinian force that intervened to halt the
intra-Shiite bloodbath, a police spokesman said.
   The Palestinian deployment in the disputed region placed Yasser
Arafat's guerrillas close to Israel's self-proclaimed ``security
zone'' and raised fears of Israeli reprisals.
   The Shiite factions ignored a Red Cross appeal for a cease-fire
to remove the bodies in the Apple Province. Shells exploded all day
near the hilltop village of Jarjou, shrouding the wooded slopes
with smoke and fire.
   The 600-member PLO force moved in Tuesday after Hezbollah
overran Jarjou, stripping Amal of a major stronghold.
   On Wednesday, Zeid Wehbe, Arafat's representative in Lebanon,
gave Hezbollah 24 hours to withdraw from the village or ``we will
find ourselves obliged to enter Jarjou by our means.''
   He said the intervention, ordered by Arafat, ``enjoys the
blessing and support of all the Arabs.'' Wehbe spoke in the
southern provincial capital of Sidon, 10 miles northwest of Jarjou.
   Hezbollah had rejected the Palestinian deployment, and
threatened to confront the PLO. A Hezbollah official warned that
the PLO move would lead to ``large-scale violence.''
   Hezbollah and Amal shelled each other over the PLO force,
manning a 4-mile-long buffer that stretches from Sarba to Arab
Saleem, just south of Jarjou.
   The Shiite factions fired howitzers, mortars and multi-barreled
rocket launchers that fire 32 rounds a minute.
   The fighting is the fiercest in six months between the two
factions, which have been battling on and off for three years for
control of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites. The Shiite make up the
country's largest sect.
   So far, 1,112 people have been killed and 3,369 wounded in the
inconclusive conflict.
   Scores of cars packed with children, mattresses and suitcases
could be seen speeding out of the region.
   Ali Hujeij said he was taking his wife and four children to
``stay with relatives in Sidon until this is over.''
   ``We don't care who controls what, just let them stop the
shelling,'' Hujeij said.
   The Communist Party leader, George Hawi, warned: ``The current
developments are expected to invite Israeli intervention at a time
when Israel is looking for a pretext to strike at the PLO and
re-establish control over south Lebanon.''
   ``We call on the warring factions to stop fighting in light of
the prevailing serious situation and we plead with our brothers in
the PLO not to get involved further and realize that their
deployment could lead to Israeli repercussions.''
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 to crush the PLO. Arafat's
guerrillas were forced to evacuate the south and Beirut.
   At least 5,000 PLO guerrillas have returned into the refugee
camps around Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.
   Israeli warplanes flew reconnaissance missions over the
embattled region Tuesday, after the PLO deployed.
   On Monday, Israel's air force commander, Maj. Gen. Avihu Bin-Nun
said he may launch a pre-emptive strike to eliminate reported
Palestinian preparations for air attacks on the Jewish state.
   ``I would advise all those who threaten us, like Abul Abbas and
his friends, to guard their training bases and sources of equipment
and to think well before using such threats,'' Bin-Nun said.
   The Palestine Liberation Front, led by Mohammed Abbas, also
known as Abul Abbas, carried out an abortive seaborne raid on
Israel on May 30. President Bush suspended an 18-month-old dialogue
with the PLO when Arafat stalled on meeting Washington's demand for
expelling Abbas from the PLO's ruling Executive Committee.

<HEAD>Euripedes meets Hawaii Five-0 in Manson Opera</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Take a notorious mass murderer, add references
to a Greek tragedy and the 1970s television show ``Hawaii Five-O,''
throw in a little ``Twin Peaks'' surrealism and you have the
makings of a very strange evening.
   ``The Manson Family,'' by John Moran, is billed as a ``music
drama'' but it has no formal plot.
   It premiered Tuesday night at the Lincoln Center's Alice Tully
Hall and was to be repeated Wednesday.
   The multimedia theater piece takes off from, but does not
exactly depict, the August 1969 murders of actress Sharon Tate and
six other people by members of Charles Manson's cult ``family.''
   Images flash across screens behind and besides the performers _
a monotonous animation of the center line of a road, quick gruesome
still shots of bodies drenched in red light, a hippie bed of
flowers. Above, cryptic words appear, sometimes pertaining to the
scene below: ``Here is a Manson girl'' and sometimes not: ``It's a
train, Dad.''
   The piece is scored by 25-year-old Moran, who studied with
composer Philip Glass. The actors sing, speak and pantomime amidst
the shifting backdrops and quirky music.
   Moran and director Bob McGrath, 35, compared the Manson murders
to the ``Bacchae,'' the fifth-century B.C. Greek drama in which the
god Dionysus leads the women of Thebes in frenzied _ and deadly _
religious rites.
   ``The Manson Family'' isn't subtle about drawing the connection:
The investigator is called Steve Pentheus after Euripides'
Pentheus, Dionysus' antagonist.
   The character is also Steve McGarrett from ``Hawaii Five-0.''
Played by M.K. Harris, he is a stunning look-alike of a young Jack
Lord.
   Pentheus also is a stentorian version of Kyle McLachlan's
Special Agent Cooper on ``Twin Peaks,'' saying things like, ``To be
respectful of reality is to be law enforcement'' and ``Well,
welcome to reality, you drugged-out hippie.''
   Manson, played by Daniel Harnett, harangues his ``family'' of
spacy women in a high-pitched voice that recalls the real Manson's.
His babble is somehow believable in the stoned-out context that
it's delivered but ridiculous if excerpted.
   At one point, a young Manson is sentenced by a Florida judge
wearing boxer shorts. At another, during the Tate murder trial, he
lunges at the judge, a scene that is repeated over and over and
over and over.
   The theater piece is performed by the Ridge Theater company as
part of the Lincoln Center's Serious Fun series.

<HEAD>Study: Warfarin Saves Lives After Heart Attacks</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Pal in 4th graf is cq; For release at 6 p.m. EDT, time set by
source</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The blood thinner warfarin significantly reduces
the risk of heart attacks and death in people who survived an
initial heart attack, a study concludes.
   The research, conducted in Norway, found that the drug reduced
the risk of death by 24 percent and the risk of subsequent heart
attacks by 34 percent.
   Since the study began seven years ago, doctors who treat heart
attack patients have begun widely prescribing aspirin, which does
essentially the same thing. No one knows for sure which is better.
   ``Personally, I would recommend warfarin, because I find it more
effective than aspirin,'' said Dr. Pal Smith, who directed the
study. However, he noted that no head-to-head comparisons of the
two medicines has been conducted.
   The latest study was conducted at Ulleval University Hospital in
Oslo and published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   In the study, 1,214 people were randomly assigned to take either
warfarin or placebos starting about a month after their heart
attacks.
   One concern of warfarin is that it might trigger bleeding,
including one form of stroke. The study found that this was rare.
Fewer than 1 percent of the patients experienced seriously bleeding
each year.
   Strokes can result from either blood clots or uncontrolled
bleeding inside the head. Overall, those getting warfarin suffered
55 percent fewer strokes. However, there were four fatal bleeding
strokes, all of them in people getting warfarin.
   Warfarin is sold as DuPont's Coumadin brand, as well as in
generic form. Treatment costs between $10 and $15 per month.
   Besides its medical uses, warfarin is a common ingredient in rat
poison.

   Andrew Young, seeking to become Georgia's first
black governor, finished second in a five-way primary for the
Democratic nomination, landing him in a runoff with Lt. Gov. Zell
Miller next month.
   Miller, lieutenant governor for 16 years, rode an issue of
growing popularity _ legalization of a state lottery _ into first
place in Tuesday's primary.
   ``Tonight I believe I can hear Georgia singing,'' Miller told
supporters. ``I hear Georgia singing a new song full of hope and
harmony ... a new song full of dreams and the determination to make
them come true.''
   This morning, however, he heard the sounds of an empty war chest.
   ``We're pretty broke, because we wanted to make sure we did all
we could (before Tuesday),'' Miller said in a telephone interview.
``So we have got to start (fund raising) this morning, and I feel
pretty good about getting the necessary funds.''
   State Rep. Johnny Isakson, 45, a real estate executive, won
nearly three-quarters of the vote against three challengers in the
Republican primary.
   With 98 percent of 2,446 precincts reporting today, Miller had
421,040 votes, or 41 percent, to Young's 295,589, or 29 percent.
State Sen. Roy Barnes had 212,647 votes, or 21 percent; state Rep.
Lauren ``Bubba'' McDonald 61,876, or 6 percent; and former Gov.
Lester Maddox 30,497, or 3 percent.
   Barnes conceded defeat today and said he will make no
endorsement in the runoff.
   At a news conference today, Young was asked about his apparent
failure to rally as many blacks as Jesse Jackson in Georgia's 1988
presidential primary. Young said he had not bragged about his work
to help blacks in Atlanta but ``now I think we need to go back and
remind people of what we've done to make their lives better.
   Miller and Young quickly served notice of an aggressive campaign
leading to the Aug. 7 runoff, but both men said they expected the
race to remain gentlemanly.
   Even before the last votes were counted Tuesday night, Miller
warned Young to expect questions about his record as Atlanta's
mayor _ a subject he has raised before. Miller criticized Young for
Atlanta's record as big-city crime capital of the nation for his
last two years as mayor.
   ``I don't think it's in any way ungentlemanly for him to
challenge my record,'' said Young, who has said the record is
partly attributable to better reporting of crime statistics by the
city. ``I'd love for him to challenge my record. ... I can account
for my last 20 years in office and I challenge him to do the same.''
   Young, a one-time aide to slain civil rights leader Martin
Luther King Jr. who went on to be a congressman, ambassador to the
United Nations and mayor of Atlanta, stressed his experience
traveling the world to bring business to Atlanta and said economic
development was a cause that could bring blacks and whites together.
   In the Republican primary, with 95 percent of 2,446 precincts
reporting, Isakson had 85,455 votes, or 74 percent.
   ``The question is no longer whether a Republican can be elected
governor of Georgia. We tonight have laid that question to rest.
For the first time in centuries, Georgians will have a choice in
the governor's race,'' Isakson said.
   The only congressional incumbent with primary opposition,
Democratic Rep. Doug Barnard, trounced journalism student Scott A.
Starling of Athens by a 3-1 margin. Barnard, who serves on the
House Banking Committee, was accused by opponents of being too cozy
with savings and loan officials.
   J.B. Stoner, a white supremacist who served time in prison for
the bombing of a black church in Alabama, ran seventh in a nine-way
race for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor. State
Sens. Joe Kennedy and Pierre Howard will be in a runoff.

<HEAD>Vestiges of Allied Control Over Germany Disappearing Quickly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An era in which even the size of a kitchen
knife was once decided by foreign military powers is coming to an
end in Berlin, the last occupied city of World War II.
   The Soviet Union's agreement to gradually remove its troops from
East Germany and allow a united Germany to join NATO effectively
eliminates the last major barriers to unification.
   It also marks the virtual end of the control the four World War
II Allies _ the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union
_ have exerted over Germany since they conquered and divided it
four decades ago.
   Nowhere is the influence of the war more evident than in Berlin,
which could become the capital of a unified Germany but still is
technically under military occupation.
   The Four Powers have said they will relinquish their rights to
Berlin immediately upon unification, which is expected in early
December.
   While West Germany was shaped into a democracy and East Germany
became a model of Soviet-style communism, the capital of the old
German empire was given special status under the Four Powers
Agreement after the war.
   Britain, France and the United States remain the supreme
authority in West Berlin and can, if necessary, control the
telephone and mail services and police department.
   West Berlin is governed by a senate that must clear matters
concerning security, foreign affairs and police questions with the
Allies. In practice, the Allies have permitted city authorities to
govern virtually on their own for many years.
   Hundreds of West Berlin ordinances enacted by the Allies after
World War II are still on the books, but most of these laws are not
enforced.
   An Allied committee, advised by the city, has been meeting for
the past six years to throw out many of the outmoded laws.
   Last year, it repealed the Allied-ordered death penalty that had
been on the books in West Berlin. West Germany has never had
capital punishment.
   In the mid-1980s, the committee repealed a law that forbid West
Berliners from owning kitchen knives longer than 12 inches _
another relic from the postwar years when household knives were
regarded as potential weapons.
   As an enclave city 110 miles inside East German territory, West
Berlin is linked to the West by air corridors and autobahns.
   The Four Powers still control the airways to Berlin, and only
their airlines can fly to the city. Even the West German airline,
Lufthansa, cannot land in Berlin. But this will change once the
city becomes part of a unified Germany.
   West Berliners are exempt from serving in the West German armed
forces, and young men will likely become eligible for the draft
once the city passes into the German government sphere. This would
effectively end West Berlin's popularity as a haven for draft
dodgers from West Germany.
   The Allies' postwar rights can still occasionally rankle.
   The Berliner Morgenpost newspaper reported Tuesday that the
Allies had rejected a local government proposal to require visas
for East Europeans who now can travel freely to West Berlin.
   But Biddy Brett Rooks, spokeswoman for the British military
government, called the report ``absolutely false'' and said the
Allies had made no decision on the visa requirement.
   Ansgar Voessing, a spokesman for the Christian Democrat
delegation in the city senate, said East bloc residents need a visa
to go to West Germany, but none to travel to West Berlin.
   He cited that as an example of how the Four Powers Agreement has
led to a ``clear inequality'' in laws.
   East Berlin was named the capital of Communist East Germany, an
action never recognized by the Western allies.
   In East Berlin, the Soviet Union exercised little direct
administrative control over the city because of the iron-fisted
rule of its surrogate, East Germany's Communist government, and the
presence of 380,000 Soviet troops in East Germany.
   ``The mayor had no power whatsoever. His sole function was to
follow party directives,'' said Klaus Haetzel, spokesman for the
East Berlin city council.
   The West German democratic constitution is as much a product of
the Allies as the status of Berlin. Its system of 11 states, the
nation's laws against extremism, were all drafted by the victors.
   In the long term, the only vestige of the war after German
unification would be the Allied troops and their nuclear arsenals
stationed in the country under the NATO alliance.
   Now that the Soviets have agreed to end their military presence
on German territory in three or four years, the Western allies may
be asked to withdraw some of their troops and weapons from West
Germany.
   Demands for the removal of NATO nuclear weapons in West Germany
could be the next step, according to Klaus Becher, a foreign policy
analyst in Bonn.
   ``The West German populace favors the removal of nuclear
weapons, at least offensive weapons,'' Becher said. ``Almost all
political forces in Germany are especially sensitive to this.''

<HEAD>U.S. Help in Quake Shows Philippine Dilemma Toward U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN GUERRERO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CABANATUAN CITY, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops from a U.S. base
arrived with cranes and a field hospital a day after Monday's
earthquake, highlighting the cooperation and friction between the
United States and the Philippines.
   Many Filipinos said the U.S. relief effort shows the benefit of
having American troops based in the Philippines. Other people,
including most senators, have demanded the bases close, saying the
Philippines must wean itself from its dependency on its superpower
ally.
   Next month U.S. and Philippine officials are scheduled to resume
talks on extending the lease on the six U.S. bases, home to 40,000
American servicemen, civilians and dependents. The current lease
expires in September 1991.
   After the earthquake, U.S. troops arrived in Cabanatuan City,
one of the hardest-hit areas, with equipment and trained engineers.
   Before they arrived, rescue efforts were conducted by volunteers
who had little more than jackhammers and their hands to move tons
of debris.
   On Wednesday, the U.S. Embassy said it was flying in an
earthquake expert and fiber optic gear to enable rescuers to see if
anyone remained alive beneath the rubble of the collapsed buildings.
   ``The really ironic thing is when (the quake struck) ... the
first people the radio stations thought of were the Americans with
their helicopters,'' commentator Luis Beltran wrote in The Manila
Standard.
   ``The fact remains that the Americans were the first to arrive
... and that they spelled the difference between life and death for
the victims,'' Beltran said.
   But critics said this reliance inhibits national development by
fostering a ``colonial mentality,'' where Filipinos look up to the
Americans and down to themselves.
   ``The government again had to send an SOS to Clark and Subic for
the much needed equipment ... to prevent an even higher toll of
casualties,'' columnist Alvin Capino wrote in the Daily Globe
newspaper. Clark is a U.S. air force base and Subic is the main
U.S. naval base in the Philippines.
   Socorro Diokno, chairman of the Anti-Bases Coalition said:
``Just like any child who will ultimately move out of his parents'
home and live his own life, we Filipinos need to live our own lives
too. If in the process we stumble and fall, then we just have to
get up and heal our bruises.''
   The Philippines often relies on U.S. resources during disasters.
Military planes from Clark and the Cubi Point naval air station
often fly maritime search and rescue missions.
   Air Force meteorologists share information with the Philippine
weather service on approaching typhoons. About 20 of them strike
this island nation every year.
   For many Philippine nationalists, the first step in achieving
what they call ``genuine independence'' will be to close the bases,
regardless of the price.
   But in Cabanatuan City, 60 miles north of Manila, American
troops working with Philippine volunteers made the difference
between life and death for many victims.
   The teams rescued 137 people, most of them trapped under the
ruins of the Philippine Christian College.
   Before the soldiers arrived with cranes and a field hospital and
engineers, the rescue operation seemed disorganizad, led mainly by
untrained volunteers.
   When they tried to drill into the massive concrete slabs of
debris, survivors cried out that the effort was only shifting
rubble onto them.
   Once the troops arrived, most residents watched the rescue
operation, unable to offer help.
   ``Now it's certain,'' one man said. ``The bases are here to
stay.''
   Others in the crowd nodded in agreement.

   Pop star Madonna turned down an invitation to help
launch a charity record for Romanian orphans Wednesday and went
jogging in Hyde Park instead.
   Olivia Harrison, chairwoman of the Romanian Angel Appeal,
invited Madonna to join her husband, former Beatle George Harrison,
and his fellow ex-Beatle Ringo Starr, at a Hyde Park Hotel luncheon
to introduce the record ``Nobody's Child.''
   But Madonna, who is staying at the hotel, went for a run in the
park surrounded by eight burly bodyguards. She was followed by a
posse of reporters, photographers and fans.
   Proceeds from the record will provide food and clothing and
improve training and care at orphanages in Romania, Mrs. Harrison
said.
   Madonna's ``Blonde Ambition'' tour starts its British leg Friday
night at Wembley Stadium.

   Dimitrios I, spiritual leader of 250

service in the Ukrainian Orthodox Church's oldest American parish.
   A crowd stood three deep on the sidewalk outside St. Mary's
Ukrainian Orthodox Church to greet Dimitrios, the first Orthodox
patriarch to come to the United States, home of 6 million Eastern
Orthodox Christians.
   Dimitrios, 75, waved to the crowd as he walked slowly up the
steps to the church, which was built in 1917. Young girls dressed
in traditional Ukrainian and Greek clothing scattered rose petals
in his path.
   ``We're really excited. It's the equivalent of the pope showing

came from the Ukraine.
   Dimitrios began his monthlong tour of the United States July 2

   `It's real hard to maintain a marriage and do the work at the
same time,'' said Wilson. ``I was never there for her.''
   Wilson, whose plays chronicle black experience in 20th-century

flight and encouraged more international cooperation in space.
   On July 17, 1975, an Apollo spacecraft docked with a Soviet
Soyuz craft, orbiting the Earth in tandem at speeds of more than
18,000 mph. Four of the mission's five veterans met Tuesday to
commemorate the history-making event.
   Apollo-Soyuz ``showed it is possible for people who have great
differences to cooperate in space,'' cosmonaut Valery N. Kubasov
said at a news conference at the Museum of Science and Industy.
   Also present were retired Lt. Gen. Thomas P. Stafford, commander
of the Apollo mission, astronaut Donald K. ``Deke'' Slayton and
Maj. Gen. Alexi Leonov, the Soyuz commander. Leonov was the first
person to walk in space and is chief of cosmonaut training in
Moscow.
   Astronaut Vance Brand missed the reunion.

<DATELINE>BAGUIO, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong aftershocks jolted
earthquake-devastated areas in the north today as crews worked to
clear a road in this hard-hit mountain resort. More bodies were dug
out, raising the death toll to 376.
   The number of dead was expected to rise sharply in Baguio, where
hundreds of people were believed still trapped in rubble because of
a lack of heavy equipment and emergency training.
   The city was cut off by landslides in Monday's quake.
   President Corazon Aquino flew in today to assess the damage.
   She ordered officials to give top priority to clearing the roads
so medicine, food and heavy equipment could be brought in. She also
ordered city schools closed for a month.
   At Baguio's Hyatt Hotel, which collapsed in the earthquake,
Clarita Gonzales tearfully called out with a megaphone for her
5-year-old daughter trapped in the rubble with her nanny.
   ``If you are still alive please tap,'' Mrs. Gonzales sobbed.
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Aquino declared a state of emergency throughout
the quake-stricken area north of Manila on the archipelago nation's
main island, Luzon.
   Two aftershocks early today measured 6.3 and 5.8 on the Richter
scale, according to the U.S. Geological Service in Golden, Colo.
Two more were reported later but precise readings were not
immediately available.
   No new damage was reported.
   Figures compiled by the Office of Civil Defense and the Red
Cross showed 360 people were killed and 773 injured from Monday's
earthquake, which registered 7.7 on the Richter scale.
   In addition, the Philex Mining Corp., reported 16 people were
also killed at its residential compound in Benguet province, but
they were not included in the official tallies. The company said 13
of the dead were children.
   Officials said at least 82 of the fatalities died in Baguio,
where four luxury hotels and 23 other buildings were severely
damaged.
   But presidential Press Secretary Tomas Gomez said Mrs. Aquino
was told that 142 people died in Baguio, including two Americans,
one South Korean, a Taiwanese and a Chinese. He gave no names.
   U.S. officials could not confirm the report but said an official
of the U.S. Agency for International Development was missing. About
1,500 Americans live in the town.
   One Baguio funeral director, Filemon Relis, said his mortuary
alone received nearly 70 bodies of quake victims. Bodies covered
with blankets were lying outside his funeral parlor; there was no
room inside.
   Monday's quake, the strongest to strike the Philippines in 14
years, damaged Baguio's airport and triggered landslides which
blocked the four highways leading to the resort.
   Highway crews used bulldozers and dynamite today to clear some
of the dozens of landslides blocking one of the roads to Baguio.
Officials said they hoped to clear the debris later today so that
much-needed supplies, including cranes, food and medicine, could
reach the city.
   The city of 120,000 people had no electricity and was running
out of food. Only one service station was open and gasoline was
being rationed.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said a 14-member
military search and rescue team arrived today from Andrews Air
Force Base near Washington, D.C., and would travel by helicopter to
Baguio to join the search.
   He said about 20 people injured in Baguio and Cabanatuan City
were flown to a U.S. military hospital at Clark Air Base. More than
50 people were killed in Cabanatuan City, 60 miles north of Manila,
when a six-story school collapsed.
   Japan sent doctors, nurses and $180,000 in relief supplies, and
Canada, Thailand, Switzerland, Singapore, Australia and South Korea
also sent assistance.
   In Dagupan, where 20 people died, firetrucks began delivering
drinking water to 31 outlying villages whose water lines were
destroyed by the quake.
   Officials in the city of more than 100,000 inhabitants, 100
miles north of Manila, said it also was without electricity and
that food and drinking water were running low.
   Dagupan's business district sank one to two yards during
Monday's quake, and mud and sea water were seeping out through
fissures in the street.
   Col. Bienvenido Liclican, spokesman for the military rescue
team, appealed over Manila radio stations for tools, blood plasma,
medicine and doctors to care for the injured.
   Monday's quake was the worst to strike the Philippines since
1976, when a quake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale killed 8,000
people.
   The scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.

<HEAD>Garbo's Collection to be Auctioned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greta Garbo's art and antique collection will be
offered in November for a targeted $20 million, the auctioneer said
Wednesday.
   Garbo's estate authorized the Nov. 13-15 sale of about 250 lots.
Her personal effects are not for sale.
   Garbo, who died April 15 at age 84, kept the paintings,
including three Renoirs; 18th-century French furniture; decorative
rugs; rare books, and Continental, English and Chinese ceramics in
her seven-room Manhattan co-op.
   The Renoirs and perhaps 20 other paintings were hung in the
drawing room, said John L. Marion, chairman of Sotheby's in North
America, the auctioneer, and an acquaintance of Garbo since the
1960s.
   Garbo bought the Renoirs in the 1940s and continued collecting
through the 1960s. Marion said the reclusive actress frequented
exhibitions and galleries at Parke-Bernet, which merged with
Sotheby's in 1964.
   The Renoirs are an 1889 portrait of the artist's nephew, Edmond;
the 1906 ``Gabrielle and Coco Lisant,'' depicting Renoir's youngest
son, Coco, and a family friend; and ``Confidence,'' an 1893 study
of a young woman and a formally attired man.
   Highlights of the collection will be displayed in Paris and
Tokyo before the auction is held in New York.
   The Swedish-born actress performed in 27 movies, including
``Anna Christie,'' ``Mata Hari,'' ``Grand Hotel,'' ``Queen
Christina,'' ``Anna Karenina,'' ``Camille'' and ``Ninotchka.''
   She left her entire estate to her niece, Gray Reisfield of
Milltown, N.J., and Mrs. Reisfield's four children.

   No one matched Dr. Karl Menninger for
breadth of interests, concern for humankind and obsession to leave
the world better than he found it.
   Few matched his intellect or his ability to apply a friendly
needle when he wanted to make a point.
   His causes were many: humane treatment of those society must
incarcerate for their wrongs, eradication of child and wife abuse,
handgun control, saving the planet from man's seeming penchant to
destroy it, the plight of native Americans and caring for the
mentally ill.
   He also was driven to make others think, and his thirst for
knowledge was unquenchable.
   His desire to learn was the main reason he started a weekly
luncheon gathering with a few close friends. It was called the
Gingersnap Club because one of its charter members, Andy Gray,
always brought a bag of fresh gingersnap cookies. Dr. Karl, as he
was known, insisted everyone eat at least one _ before lunch.
   He liked to call himself a ``writin' man,'' a carryover from his
teen-age days as a fledgling reporter for the old Topeka Daily
Capital, and liked to talk current events with newsmen.
   If he liked you, he was lavish in his praise. If he didn't like
you, you became a non-entity.
   He tended toward hyperbole. In autographing ``Sparks,'' his 1973
book, he wrote this description: `` ... a writin' man friend of
mine who has helped many unknown helpless ones, without credit or
reward, except the appreciation of some readers, such as Karl A.
Menninger.''
   Invitees to the Thursday luncheon meetings included favored
politicians and state officials. If they had transgressed in his
judgment, he let them know it _ subtly yet pointedly.
   One such guest was Rep. Jim Slattery, R-Kan., whose visit was
ill-timed. It followed Slattery's vote with the National Rifle
Association on a gun control bill before Congress.
   Dr. Karl said nothing about the vote during lunch, but near the
end quietly rose from his chair, crossed the room and picked up a
framed poster comparing the number of gun-related deaths in the
United States and other Western countries. It emphasized the fact
the U.S. total exceeded 9,000 a year.
   Menninger leaned the poster against a wall directly in front of
Slattery, not needing to say a word.
   After Slattery somewhat sheepishly tried to explain how he
wanted to avoid a controversy with gun control opponents, Dr. Karl
looked at him and said, ``That's all right, Jim. We still love you
even if you vote wrong sometimes.''

<HEAD>Police Arrest Two in Missing Manhole Covers Case</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with arrest of two men trying to sell
manhole covers today. No pickup.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Police figured out the motive in the case of
the missing manhole covers and today they arrested two suspects.
   Some of the more than 185 purloined covers turned up at a scrap
metals yard Tuesday, and today police arrested two men who showed
up at the same yard with another truckload.
   Detective Bob Readheimer said the men and their truck matched
the description of suspects spotted earlier lifting a manhole cover
in Santa Monica. ``They drove to the right place at the right
time,'' he said.
   Some of the cast-iron covers ranging in weight from 50 pounds to
200 pounds were buried in truckloads of higher grade iron sold to
the Downtown Metal Center to fetch a higher price, said center
manager Robert Kelman.
   ``The manhole covers are pretty flat so they can hide them
well,'' Kelman said Tuesday. ``Basically, they just used them to
weigh down the load.''
   The discovery of Los Angeles City manhole covers in piles of old
pipes, truck bodies, and reinforcement bars solved the biggest
mystery in the disappearance of some 30 manhole covers a day since
early last week _ what use were the things?
   Since the covers by themselves were only worth $1.50 each at
scrap yards, police and city officials could not figure out why
anyone would bother trying to steal the heavy, unwieldy covers.
   The thief was dubbed ``Manhole Man,'' but police didn't know
whether a single person or a gang of thieves was responsible.
   Most of the covers reported stolen were 2-foot diameter cast
iron covers placed over sidewalk storm drains, but the metals
center received even larger, middle-of-the-road covers. Officials
were worried a pedestrian could fall into the 2-foot holes, but so
far no injuries have been reported.

<HEAD>Soviet Union, Hungary Want to Establish Diplomatic Ties With NATO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a sharp break with the past, the
Soviet Union and Hungary have accepted NATO's offer to establish
diplomatic ties with the Western military alliance, officials said
Wednesday.
   The decisions _ the first by Warsaw Pact nations _ came less
than two weeks after President Bush and other NATO leaders extended
``the hand of friendship'' to their former adversaries in Eastern
Europe.
   Hungarian Prime Minister Jozsef Antall announced his
government's plans after paying a visit to the headquarters of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the first by a leader of a
Warsaw Pact nation.
   ``With this, the official resumption of contacts has taken
place,'' he told reporters.
   Later, NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner, just back from a
trip to Moscow, said the Soviet Union also intended to set up
diplomatic exchanges.
   ``The Soviet Union and Hungary are the first two countries with
which we are establishing a form of diplomatic contact,'' said NATO
spokesman Robin Stafford.
   NATO had not yet created a system for accrediting diplomats to
the alliance, he said. No nations outside the 16 members have
official status.
   Antall, who met for nearly an hour with Woerner, said he had
asked that Hungary's ambassador to Belgium also be accredited in
the future to NATO.
   ``We agreed that if the Soviet Union and Hungary wish to make
any contact ... this is the way to do it _ through the ambassador
who is accredited to Belgium at the moment,'' Stafford said.
   Earlier this month, Bush and the other NATO leaders wound up a
critical summit in London by pledging to reduce their conventional
and nuclear defenses in Europe and reassuring the East of their
peaceful intentions.
   They also invited Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to
address a NATO meeting and suggested Moscow and other governments
in Easter Europe establish ``regular diplomatic liaison with NATO.''
   ``This will make it possible for us to share with them our
thinking and deliberations in this historic period of change,'' the
leaders said in their final statement.
   Woerner, who talked to Gorbachev on Saturday in Moscow, said
Gorbachev did not give a date for his visit but ``he clearly
accepted the invitation.''
   It was the first time in the 41-year history of the Western
alliance that its top official had traveled to the Soviet Union.
   ``I think we opened the doors for a new era of cooperation,''
Woerner said.
   ``I explained to the Soviet leadership we wanted to have a
sincere partnership in the future ... not only with them but with
all countries of Central and Eastern Europe,'' he said.
   Antall's visit symbolized the new turn in relations, he said.
   The Hungarian leader said he supported the ``Atlantic idea,'' a
reference to the political links drawing together the United States
and Canada with nations in Europe.
   ``Two world wars and a cold war have proved that Europe and
North America are inseparable,'' Antall said in brief remarks in
the main lobby of the alliance headquarters.
   He said NATO should form ``a basis for European security and
this is not directed against the Soviet Union.''
   ``The Soviet Union must just as much be part of the European
security system as should the United States of America,'' he said.
   Antall invited Woerner to travel to Budapest in November.
   Hungary's Parliament voted overwhelmingly last month to withdraw
from the Eastern military alliance by the end of 1991. Antall made
no mention of those plans.
   In December, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
became the first foreign minister of a Warsaw Pact nation to visit
NATO. The foreign ministers of Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and
East Germany have since visited.

<HEAD>Sullivan Says FDA Should Remain Part of HHS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the Food and Drug Administration is made an
independent agency, its work and the coordination of the
government's health programs will suffer, the secretary of health
and human services said Wednesday.
   Secretary Louis Sullivan said the FDA should remain under the
umbrella of his department because its activities are intertwined
with those of other health agencies he manages.
   ``I believe very strongly that this kind of interaction ...
would be disrupted, (and) it would be to the detriment not only to
the FDA but also to our citizens in having a comprehensive,
coordinated health program,'' Sullivan told the House Energy and
Commerce investigations subcommittee.
   But Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said cutting FDA loose from the
bureaucracy of the massive Cabinet department would distance the
agency from political battles within the White House and make the
agency more responsive.
   The suggestion that FDA be removed from the Health and Human
Services Department is being talked about more on Capitol Hill,
where the agency has been under criticism for its handling of the
generic drug scandal.
   ``The agency is now bogged down in muck,'' Wyden said. ``The FDA
doesn't have the resources or authority to protect the public.''
   Subcommittee members questioned Sullivan for more than two hours
about what they consider to be major problems at FDA, including
tardiness in drafting regulations to implement laws passed by
Congress and weaknesses in the agency's control over approvals of
drugs and medical devices.
   Sullivan assured panel members that he is putting the FDA's
house in order, restructuring its management and adding resources
in the wake of the generic drug fraud and corruption scandal.
   The subcommittee pioneered the investigation of the generic drug
industry that has resulted in 13 criminal convictions of former FDA
employees and drug company officials. More than 100 drugs have been
removed from the market, many by companies that cheated on tests
required for FDA approval.
   While the pace of approvals of generic drugs dropped sharply
during the last year while the generic drug division reorganized,
approvals should begin increasing within months, Sullivan said.
   ``We still have much work to do at FDA,'' Sullivan said, adding
that the generic drug approval process ``is still not what it
should be.'' But, he said, the slowdown in approvals was necessary
to assure the safety of generic drugs.
   Sullivan announced the appointment of an FDA ombudsman to
resolve grievances in the drug-approval process. He also said he is
adding 80 people to the FDA's current 15-person force of criminal
investigators. The department also has proposed legislation to
bolster FDA's authority over drug companies.
   ``I believe our response in this crisis has been vigorous,
responsible and credible,'' he said.
   But Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said he was concerned that the
agency's ``continuing paralysis'' would hurt the business of honest
generic drug companies.
   ``The generic drug program is a program in crisis because of
caution and inertia at HHS and a status-quo leadership,'' Dingell
said. ``HHS efforts to reform FDA management problems and provide
direction have been ... tepid at best.''

<HEAD>Gov't Announces End to 25-Year-Old State of Emergency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANGUS SHAW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced Wednesday it
will lift a quarter-century-old state of emergency next week
because of easing regional tensions and political harmony at home.
   The announcement followed repeated demands by church, student,
labor and human rights groups for an end to the emergency powers.
It was the latest move toward democratic reform in sub-Saharan
Africa, where traditional one-party rule and broad government
powers have come under increasing attack.
   ``We are really overjoyed,'' said Nicholas Ndebele, head of the
Roman Catholic Justice and Peace Commission in Harare. ``Now our
people are going to experience real independence, real freedom.
   ``We are sure normal laws will suffice,'' he said.
   The state of emergency, enforced by four different governments
since its introduction by white minority leader Ian Smith in 1965,
was scheduled for renewal by the 150-seat House of Assembly next
week.
   However, the home affairs minister, Moven Mahachi, told
legislators that the government and security services no longer
felt the emergency powers were necessary. Mahachi said the
government will lift the emergency at midnight July 25.
   Since the two main rival political parties merged in December
1987, Zimbabwe had enjoyed peaceful conditions that Mahachi called
``the best for a long time in the history of this country.''
   Zimbabwe was often criticized for keeping its own emergency laws
while denouncing the state of emergency in neighboring South
Africa. On June 7, South African President F.W. de Klerk ended four
years of emergency rule in all but one province, Natal, where
factional violence has cost more than 3,000 lives.
   Zimbabwe often cited the threat of destabilization from South
Africa as a reason for its state of emergency, but Mahachi told
legislators that conditions in South Africa had changed following
reforms by de Klerk.
   In Zimbabwe, the emergency was frequently invoked to allow for
the detention without trial of political opponents and alleged
subversives.
   Church groups said these provisions of the emergency were
frequently abused.
   The emergency also gave the authorities the power to impose
price controls, seize assets owned by ``enemies of the state'' and
intervene in labor disputes.
   The emergency was used in recent months to declare a wave of
strikes illegal. In June, a nationwide strike by disgruntled
teachers was outlawed under the emergency laws and more than 1,000
strikers were fired.
   Since the former British colony of Rhodesia became independent
Zimbabwe in 1980, the emergency has been renewed by a parliamentary
vote every six months.
   In the past, the government also had cited cross-border raids by
rebels fighting to overthrow the government in neighboring
Mozambique and the activities of armed dissidents in Zimbabwe's
western province of Matabeleland as reasons for keeping emergency
laws.
   Mahachi said incursions by Mozambique National Resistance rebels
were now ``under control'' and Zimbabwe hoped current peace talks
between the rebels and the Mozambican government would succeed.
   The state of emergency was first introduced by Smith to crack
down on black nationalists. It remained in force during a
seven-year guerrilla war waged by the black nationalists against
Smith's white minority government.
   A coalition of Smith and moderate black leaders kept the
emergency laws, as did British governor Lord Christopher Soames in
the months before independence.
   Soames headed a temporary British administration that oversaw a
cease-fire in the guerrilla war and independence elections. The
elections swept Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic
Front) party to power.

   The U.S. policy shift on Cambodia
improves the prospects for a negotiated peace settlement, but also
could fuel the fighting in a land that has known only war for 20
years.
   The U.S. decision to withdraw recognition of the Cambodian
resistance isolates the Khmer Rouge _ one of three factions in the
coalition _ even further and likely will harden the group's
determination to win the war.
   The coalition of the Khmer Rouge and the guerrilla forces of
Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Son Sann recently made its biggest
gains of the war against the Vietnamese-backed government, seizing
hundreds of Cambodian villages.
   But in Paris on Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State James A.
Baker III announced the United States was changing its policy to
withdraw recognition of the guerrillas and open a new dialogue with
Vietnam on the Cambodian war.
   Baker's announcement reflected a growing conviction within the
U.S. administration that the Khmer Rouge forces dominate the
resistance coalition, and are on the verge of taking over Cambodia.
   The dramatic about-face also comes after a shift in superpower
relations, with the United States and Soviet Union declaring their
decades-long Cold War at an end. Vietnam is Moscow's main Asian
ally, and China's chief rival in the region. At the same time,
U.S.-Chinese relations have chilled in the past year following
Beijing's harsh crackdown on its democracy movement in June 1989.
   For years, negotiations on ending the Cambodian war have been
hampered because the United States and the resistance coalition's
other key backers, China and the non-Communist Southeast Asian
nations, had no dialogue on the subject with Vietnam.
   The United States has no diplomatic ties with Vietnam and
contact between the two countries has been limited to talks on
refugees, accounting for missing American soldiers and other
humanitarian issues.
   Vietnamese officials have stressed in recent interviews with The
Associated Press that they would try to create a climate conducive
to establishing diplomatic ties with Washington. Such ties are seen
as crucial to Vietnam's economic development and attempts to break
out of its international isolation.
   The U.S. shift meets Vietnam's demand for a halt to recognition
of the guerrillas. It raises the possibility Vietnam will return
the favor by using its influence on Phnom Penh to pressure the Hun
Sen government to agree to a peace settlement.
   Phnom Penh already is under heavy pressure because of the
guerrilla battlefield victories, internal dissent, and a drastic
reduction in aid from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   The resistance coalition, which the United States helped
non-Communist Southeast Asian nations create in 1982, is dominated
by the Khmer Rouge.
   The Khmer Rouge is blamed for the deaths of hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians during its rule of the country from 1975 to
late 1978, when Vietnam invaded and installed the Hun Sen
government.
   The U.S. shift brings the country into agreement with nations
such as Australia and some members of the European Community, which
already had adopted anti-Khmer Rouge policies.
   The U.S. shift also should be welcomed in Phnom Penh, which has
adamantly rejected any significant Khmer Rouge role in the
country's future.
   Phnom Penh's official news agency SPK said Wednesday that in a
talk this week with former U.S. Ambassador John Gunther Dean, Prime
Minister Hun Sen ``laid stress on measures to prevent the return of
the genocidal Pol Pot clique.'' Pol Pot led the Khmer Rouge during
the group's bloody rule.
   Sihanouk, the leader of the guerrilla coalition, says he hates
the Khmer Rouge, but joined forces with the group because of its
military punch.
   The U.S. shift may prompt some initial anger from Sihanouk, but
also could allow him gracefully to disentangle himself from the
Khmer Rouge and pursue a greater range of negotiating options.
   However, Sihanouk and the third guerrilla coalition leader,
former Prime Minister Son Sann, have often said that freezing the
Khmer Rouge out of a peace settlement could strengthen the group's
resolve to take power on the battlefield.
   ``It is better to have the Khmer Rouge in the settlement than to
have to fight them in the jungles,'' a Western relief official once
remarked to an Associated Press correspondent.
   Son Sann recently insisted that the Khmer Rouge be represented
on a ``supreme national council'' that Sihanouk and Hun Sen agreed
to form in order to arrange a truce.
   The effort to arrange a truce appears to be failing, largely
because the Khmer Rouge felt it was not treated with respect in
peace talks last month in Tokyo. As a result, it has boycotted the
Sihanouk-Hun Sen agreement.
   Whatever the U.S. position, China has not reduced its support
for the Khmer Rouge, which includes large arms shipments.
   Last month, talks between China and Vietnam collapsed because
both countries refused to back off their support for their allies
in Cambodia.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Wednesday
gave the Soviet Union an outline of the areas in which the Bush
administration is ready to offer technical help.
   A senior U.S. official said that includes technical assistance,
banking and tax-administration techniques and housing construction
advice.
   Baker made the offer in a meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze at the U.S. ambassador's residence.
   The official, who insisted on anonymity, disclosed the U.S.
offer on Baker's flight home.
   President Bush has ruled out direct U.S. assistance to the shaky
Soviet economy unless three conditions are met.
   These are the adoption of free-market procedures, a decrease in
spending on the Soviet military and less involvement with countries
accused of promoting regional unrest, such as Cuba.
   Baker gave the printed outline to Shevardnadze. The official
said the Soviet foreign minister is expected to respond when the
two next meet Aug. 1 in Irkutsk, Siberia.
   On another subject the official said the Soviet foreign minister
responded favorably to a proposal by Baker to establish contact
with some of President Gorbachev's sharpest critics.
   ``He had no problem with that,'' the official said of
Shevardnadze's reaction.
   But Shevardnadze told Baker the idea of political opposition is
only beginning to be understood in the Soviet Union.
   ``He said there are younger people who are emerging right now
who are quite serious,'' the official said.

   The remains of two U.S. Army soldiers killed
in an aircraft crash in southern Laos during the Vietnam War have
been identified, the Pentagon announced Wednesday.
   The remains, found during a joint U.S.-Laotian excavation effort
last January, will be sent from Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii on
Thursday with a full military honors ceremony, the Pentagon said.
The remains will be flown to Travis Air Force Base, Calif., for the
final journey home.
   The Pentagon identified the remains as those of Keith A. Brandt,
an Army captain from Bellingham, Wash., and Alan B. Boffman, an
Army first lieutenant, of Norfolk, Va. Brandt was 30 years old at
the time of the fatal crash on March 18, 1971; Boffman was 24.
   A Pentagon statement said the Laotian government was
instrumental in recovering the remains and that its cooperation was
deeply appreciated. The recovery lowers to 2,300 the number of
American servicemen and women still listed as missing in action or
otherwise unaccounted for from the Vietnam War.

<HEAD>28 Killed, 56 Injured When Gunmen Shoot At Bus, Van in Natal</HEAD>

   Gunmen shot at a bus and van
Wednesday, sending the vehicles plunging down an embankment and
killing at least 28 blacks, authorities said. Fifty-six were
injured.
   Police said the bus driver was shot, forcing the vehicle out of
control as it carried rural blacks to work through an area in Natal
Province marked by violence between black political factions.
   The van, traveling in front of the bus, also fell down the
embankment when its driver was frightened by the shots, police
said. All those killed were on the bus.
   Rival black factions had been fighting in the area a few hours
earlier, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity. Police
were hunting for the attackers but had made no arrests.
   Natal has been hit by fighting in recent years between the
African National Congress, the main black nationalist group, and
Inkatha, a conservative Zulu political movement. The two groups
oppose apartheid, but differ over plans for a future South Africa.
   A local journalist, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
fighting Tuesday night and early Wednesday was between ANC and
Inkatha factions. The two groups had been shooting across the road
at each other when the van and bus were hit, she said.
   Spokesmen for both parties denied their followers were
responsible for the killings.
   Also Wednesday, police said two men were stabbed to death in
black factional violence in a separate incident in Natal.
   A police patrol wounded two men when it was attacked by blacks
with guns and rocks Tuesday near Port Shepstone in Natal, police
said.
   At least 4,000 people have died in the Natal violence since 1986.
   In other developments, a bomb probably planted by right-wing
extremists exploded outside a building just minutes after a protest
against military conscription was moved to another site, police
said Wednesday.
   The blast late Tuesday in the southeast city of East London
damaged a wall in the building where the End Conscription Campaign
was to have held a meeting, but there were no reports of injuries,
police said.
   The meeting had been moved because more people than expected had
attended.
   Police said no group had claimed responsibility for the blast,
but it was probably the work of right-wing white extremists opposed
to government plans to abolish apartheid and share political power
with the black majority.
   Right-wing groups have claimed responsibility for a series of
bombings in recent weeks.

   Controversy raging over art in much of
the country centers on obscenity, but on the high-tech MIT campus
the argument is whether a big hairy thing is thought-provoking or
just an eyesore.
   Cambridge artist Mags Harries proposed using hair from students
of all backgrounds to create the four-pronged hat of a shaman, or
tribal magician, from Lapland.
   The work, of human hair woven onto a form, was commissioned last
year to hang in an atrium of the Stratton Student Center on the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus.
   ``I was trying to think of ways that students could involve
themselves,'' Harries said. ``Little did I know.''
   Students balked last spring when they got wind that the hairy
hat was destined to hang in the center next to a cafeteria.
   ``Word got out that a giant hairball was going to be hung in the
atrium,'' said Katy Kline, director of MIT's List Visual Arts
Center. ``Opposition arose.''
   Several hundred students opposed to the $70,000 construction met
with administrators, signed petitions and penned letters to the
student newspaper.
   ``People said, `This is revolting, it's dirty, I don't want it
near my food, it's like what my cat vomits up,''' said Mark
Roberts, 24, a graduate student in technology and policy studies.
   Pranksters in April even placed a fully functional, 8-foot-long
slide rule in the spot where the hat was supposed to hang.
   The display is on hold but the debate goes on.
   Harries says she chose the shaman hat as a subject because the
shaman was an observer of nature, and an early scientist.
   Opponents say it would be a brooding, dark mark on a spot where
open space and light abound. They also worry that the hair would be
unsanitary so close to a cafeteria.
   ``We don't know about having all that dead organic matter
hanging in the atrium,'' said George Madrid, 20, a computer science
major.
   ``But they can hang it in the faculty club.''
   Art placed in a student union, students say, should be fun and
uplifting, not confrontational and repellent.
   ``The big objection is that it conjures up horrific images, and
the student center isn't the place for it,'' said Andrew Greene,
21, a physics major. ``Something light and humorous would be more
appropriate. The slide rule was kind of funny, and it was
functional.''
   Supporters say the hairy hat is a challenging work.
   ``It's very valuable to have something that's absolutely outside
the rational, empirical world that holds sway at MIT,'' said
Roberts.
   ``Art that pleases everyone is deadly,'' he added. ``If it
doesn't have some prickles in it then there's something wrong with
it.''
   Nationally, controversy erupted recently over photographs by the
late Robert Mapplethorpe and works by other artists that some
consider obscene, but most people at MIT agree that's not the point
here.
   ``This has to do with public art,'' says Ellen T. Harris,
associate provost for the arts. ``The questions are, whose space is
this? And if the art is public, who is that public and who gets to
choose that art?''
   The issue will be taken up again in the fall. University
officials seem confident the sculpture will eventually be accepted,
while most students seem to have dug in their heels in opposition.
   Harris says whatever the outcome, the debate the work has
stirred is valuable.
   And even MIT's computer whizzes and physics geniuses admit the
issue is not one with easy answers.
   ``On one hand you can be arrogant and say, `We know about art,
and this is good for you,''' said Roberts. ``On the other hand, you
can use a democratic process to select art and end up with
something dull and insipid.''

   While Richard Nixon was on the West Coast to
open his presidential library, actor Jim Cooke did what he could
here Wednesday to revive the reputation of another maligned
president, Calvin Coolidge.
   He brought his one-man show, ``More Than Two Words,'' to the
National Archives auditorium to repeat the wit and words of a chief
executive who is usually pictured as possessing little of either.
   The show's title comes from a Coolidge story, perhaps apocryphal.
   ``Oh, Mr. Coolidge!'' a dinner partner is said to have gushed to
a president known for his taciturn tendencies. ``I've made a five
dollar bet that I can get more than two words out of you.''
   Said he to her: ``You lose.''
   Cooke, 53, like Coolidge a flinty Vermonter, tried to hide his
dismay when he was reminded in an interview that history has not
been kind to Coolidge.
   Samuel Eliot Morison, in his ``Oxford History of the American
People,'' said this of the man who served as president for six
years during the tumultuous 1920s:
   ``A mean, thin-lipped little man, a respectable mediocrity, he
lived parsimoniously but admired men of wealth, and his political
principles were those current in 1902. People thought Coolidge
brighter than he was because he seldom said anything. ...
   ``Mrs. Coolidge was a handsome and gracious lady, without whom
the formal parties at the White House would have been unbearably
grim. She helped this dour, abstemious and unimaginative figure to
become one of the most popular American presidents.''
   Cooke flinched when reminded.
   He said maybe historians had been so enamored of Franklin D.
Roosevelt ``that they got into the habit of denigrating anyone who
came before him.''
   Maybe it was the mad-dog midday heat that brought them in, but a
lunchtime audience of Washingtonians spent an hour with Cooke and
Coolidge. By coincidence, the performance occurred on the same day
that Nixon, another former president with a rotten reputation, was
in Yorba Linda, Calif., for a ceremony opening his presidential
library to the public.
   Cooke recited lines from Coolidge's twice-weekly news
conferences, from his speeches, from his autobiography first
serialized in Cosmopolitan magazine in 1933, and from his letters
to his father, always signed, ``Your son, Calvin Coolidge.''
   Coolidge, Cooke said later, delivered his humor deadpan, almost
with a scowl, so effectively that people didn't know he was joking.
   At a news conference, talking about retirement and twitting his
reputation for parsimony, he said: ``I would like to report that
there is no foundation to the rumor that I have been offered an
opportunity to teach a course in thrift at Scotland's University of
Aberdeen.''
   And hidden deep within a paragraph of his autobiography: ``The
pressure to speak is constant and intolerable. However, I resisted
most of it.''
   ``I have found in the course of a long public career,'' said
Coolidge and recited Cooke, ``that the things I did not say never
hurt me.''
   For the occasion, Cooke wore a starched, high-collared shirt, a
tight double-breasted suit and high-lace shoes.
   He used to teach theater at Boston's Emerson College, has done
Coolidge 40 or 50 times over the last five years and hopes to do it
in each of the 48 states in the union when Coolidge was in the
White House.
   ``I've come to like him a lot,'' said Cooke. He also likes what
Coolidge's son, John, 83, said _ Coolidgelike _ when he took in
Cooke's first performance in Coolidge's hometown, Plymouth, Vt.:
``I thought he did quite well.''
   After the show, Fran Wells, who came here in 1939 and worked for
the old War Production Board and for the Federal Trade Commission
and the Postal Service, hurried up to Cooke and said, ``I have to
tell you, I have a better opinion of that man.''
   Coolidge might have frowned. Cooke beamed.

   Two spacewalking cosmonauts had to use an
emergency hatch to re-enter their spacecraft because their normal
porthole malfunctioned and their life support supplies were running
out, Soviet media said Wednesday.
   The incident, which Soviet television called life-threatening,
occurred while Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander Balandin were trying
to fix thermal insulation on the outside of their spacecraft.
   It was the latest in a series of problems plaguing the
cosmonauts' six-month mission.
   Despite the danger, the cosmonauts joked about it afterward.
Solovyev quipped that flight controllers ``need to put road signs
there'' on the outside of the huge craft, Soviet television's
evening news program Vremya said.
   ``Midnight Emergency in Outer Space,'' was the headline of a
front-page story in Wednesday's Izvestia newspaper. The article
raised the possibility human error could be behind the hatch
problem and that the cosmonauts might have to take another
spacewalk for more repairs before they can return to Earth safely.
   ``Was there a threat to the crew's lives? Yes, there was,''
Vremya said.
   A U.S. specialist on the Soviet space program said the hatch
problem may prevent Solovyev, the 42-year-old flight commander, and
Balandin, the 36-year-old engineer, from taking another spacewalk.
   The Soviet Union's manned space program, which for decades has
been a source of national pride, has been plagued the past two
years by equipment malfunctions, mistakes by cosmonauts and budget
cuts.
   The cosmonauts on Tuesday left Mir, the space station orbiting
for four years, to fix thermal insulation around the capsule they
must use to return to Earth.
   Nearly half the insulation on the Soyuz TM-9 capsule, which is
docked to Mir, has peeled off, news reports have said.
   After repairing some of the damaged insulation, the cosmonauts,
who were working without tethers or hoses connected to the ship,
encountered the hatch problem.
   ``During their return to the spaceship, the crew experienced
unexpected difficulties,'' Radio Moscow said. ``The cosmonauts
failed to shut the door of the entrance chamber and had to make use
of an emergency door to enter the station.''
   James Oberg, author of several books on the Soviet space
program, said although the cosmonauts managed to climb back into
Mir safely, the hatch problem could complicate future spacewalks.
   ``The general crisis was not fully resolved,'' Oberg said in a
telephone interview Wednesday from his Texas home.
   He said the cosmonauts may be unable to take another spacewalk
because equipment needed to recharge their spacesuits with air and
other vital supplies is now inaccessible in the damaged airlock.
   Soviet officials at the Soviet Mission Control Center in
Kaliningrad, north of Moscow, tried to minimize the problem.
   ``No one is concerned here. It is an abnormal situation but
controllable,'' Vsyeva Latyshev, a center spokesman, said in a
telephone interview.
   Izvestia said it took Solovyev and Balandin three hours to reach
their damaged capsule after crawling out of Mir and scampering
along its outer skin using fasteners like mountain climbers. They
managed to fold part of the damaged insulation using clamps but
another damaged piece wouldn't budge.
   Radio Moscow reported the cosmonauts determined the insulation,
which protects the capsule while in space, was damaged during
launch of the Soyuz on Feb. 11. The thermal blanket, flapping
uselessly in space for months, could have interfered with the
cosmonauts' safe return to Earth.
   Izvestia said life support resources of the cosmonauts'
spacesuits approached their six-hour limit.
   They were running so low on air that they had to ``feed'' their
spacesuits outside the ship, Izvestia reported, apparently drawing
oxygen from the vessel.
   In their rush, the cosmonauts apparently did not remove their
ladders from the outside, Izvestia reported. It said ground
controllers ``cannot rule out'' that Solovyev and Balandin will
have to take another spacewalk in the next few days. It did not say
whether the walk would be needed to remove the ladders or to repair
the balky hatch.
   The malfunctioning hatch is on Kvant-2, a module attached to
Mir, and must be closed so the cosmonauts can pressurize the
chamber.
   The cosmonauts apparently closed an inner hatch to seal one end
of the airlock that leads to the troublesome outside hatch. That
airlock apparently contains equipment they use for their spacewalks.
   On Tuesday, the spacemen were unable to close the hatch after
they entered the airlock ``either because of the rush, tiredness or
some other unknown reason,'' Izvestia said.
   Tass said Solovyev and Balandin had to re-enter through another
hatch on Kvant-2 that leads into a compartment for scientific
equipment.
   The repairs and re-entry took seven hours, about two hours
longer than scheduled.
   Latyshev said ground controllers planned to bring the two
cosmonauts home in the Soyuz capsule as scheduled Aug. 9.
   A replacement crew for Mir is to be launched Aug. 1.

<HEAD>Ruling To Allow Accidental Harm To Whales During Arctic
Exploration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil companies exploring in the Beaufort and
Chukchi seas north of Alaska won exemption Wednesday from a federal
law protecting whales and seals from even accidental harm.
   The ruling by the National Marine Fisheries Service allows each
company involved in oil and gas drilling or seismic exploration to
apply for letters of authorization allowing what is called ``a take
of marine mammals incidental to exploration.''
   The rule, published Wednesday in the Federal Register, will be
in effect for five years, although the authorization letters will
have to be renewed each year. The exemption stems from 1986
amendments to the Marine Mammals Protection Act and the Endangered
Species Act.
   The Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission plans to file suit in
federal court to block the ruling, said Lynn Sutcliffe, a lawyer in
Washington for the commission.
   ``The industry can't be authorized willy-nilly to go out and do
what they want,'' Sutcliffe said. ``No one knows how much that
harassment will disrupt the reproductive cycle or end up killing
whales.''
   He said Alaska natives, who are allowed to take 41 bowhead
whales each year to maintain their traditional culture, fear that
oil exploration during the sensitive migration months could disrupt
the hunt or lead to international pressure for a lower whaling
quota.
   Until now, the oil companies have had to restrict their
explorations while whales were migrating through the Beaufort and
Chukchi seas, because they were prohibited from even incidental
harassment of the affected species.
   Sutcliffe said the commission would continue negotiations with
the oil industry for a negotiated settlement of the dispute, while
pursuing court action as well.
   Besides the bowhead, species covered by the ruling are the gray
whale, beluga whale, bearded seal, ringed seal and spotted seal.
   Margaret Lorenz, a spokeswoman for the National Marine Fisheries
Service, said oil companies will be required to have a program to
monitor any effects of their activity on the whales and other
marine mammals, and also a plan of cooperation with the native
communities involved in the whale hunt.
   Wednesday's ruling, authorized by the Marine Mammal Protection
Act of 1972, was requested in February 1988 by the oil companies
Amoco, Chevron, Exxon, Shell, Unocal and Western Geophysical Co. of
America. ARCO Alaska Inc. joined the petition in January 1990.
   The National Marine Fisheries Service, an agency of the Commerce
Department, held public hearings in Washington and in Barrow,
Alaska and prepared an environmental assessment that found there
would be no significant impact on the populations of marine mammals.

   San Francisco has begun enforcing a state
law that requires convicted prostitutes be tested for AIDS, despite
concerns that the law violates confidentiality rights.
   Under the 1989 law, which San Francisco Municipal Court began
enforcing Tuesday, anyone convicted of prostitution or solicitation
must be tested for the HIV virus and receive counseling.
   If they test positive and are arrested again for prostitution or
solicitation, the usual misdemeanor charge may be upgraded to a
felony, increasing the sentence if convicted.
   Many judges and health officials are concerned that the
requirements violate confidentiality rights and discriminate
against defendants who test positive.
   ``The concern is if a person is designated with AIDS and (that
information) leaks out, how is it going to affect that person in
everyday life _ in housing, in employment,'' said Judge Ronald
Quidachay, assistant presiding Municipal Court judge.
   According to the law, the defendants and the court will be
notified of the test results. The court will tell the Department of
Justice which defendants tested positive for the human
immuno-deficiency virus, which causes AIDS.
   Those who refuse to be tested could be jailed until they submit.
   When it approved the law, the state Legislature left it up to
local governments to design and enforce testing programs.

   A Republican lawmaker urged President Bush on
Wednesday to press for an international Middle East peace
conference sponsored only by the United States and the Soviet Union.
   Israel has always objected to an international conference that
would be sponsored by the five superpowers, so Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., said he suggested that the United States call for an
conference convened only by the United States and the Soviet Union.
   ``With the five, it would be 4-to-1 against Israel,'' Specter
said. ``At one time, Prime Minister Shamir agreed with an
international conference and it is my thinking that it's worth
going back to pursue that.''
   Specter said Bush indicated the idea was worth exploring, but
``raised the question as to whether Israel would go along with it.''
   Specter and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., met with
Bush to discuss ways of defusing the rising tensions in the Middle
East, inflamed in part by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's threat
to use chemical weapons against Israeli if Israel attacks Iraq.
   ``What we are searching for from Iraq is a clear-cut statement
of no first strike,'' Specter told reporters afterward.
   Specter said he and Dole would meet next week with National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and his deputy, Robert Gates.

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told
Congress on Wednesday the central bank is ready to push interest
rates lower to keep the country out of a recession _ once
policy-makers agree on a deficit reduction package.
   But the head of the central bank tempered his pledge by
insisting that he sees no signs of a recession. He also indicated
the Federal Reserve is not contemplating any immediate follow-up to
a small credit easing move it made last Friday.
   Testifying on the Federal Reserve's midyear assessment of the
economy, Greenspan found himself caught between the opposing forces
of a sluggish economy and still high inflationary pressures.
   On the one hand, he wanted to provide support for the budget
negotiations between the administration and Congress by allaying
fears that a tax increase and big cuts in spending could topple the
country into a recession.
   The administration is counting on the Fed to lower interest
rates to stimulate economic growth as a way of offsetting the
adverse effects of higher taxes and spending cuts.
   Shortly before Greenspan testified, the Labor Department
reported that consumer prices shot up 0.5 percent in June and so
far this year, inflation has been rising at an annual rate of 5.9
percent, far higher than the central bank would like to see.
   Greenspan sought to play down the June inflation report,
contending it was the result of temporary factors and not an
indication that inflation was taking off again.
   While generally agreeing with that assessment, private
economists said that the Fed could not give any sign that it was
relaxing its guard against inflation for fear of spooking financial
markets.
   ``Greenspan is walking a tightrope. Inflation is not going away,
but the Fed clearly wants to support the budget negotiations,''
said David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill.
   In delivering the Fed's economic report Wednesday, Greenspan
said that ``a major cut in the budget is unquestionably the right
thing to do.'' He said the latest efforts by Congress and the
administration to come to grips with the problem had been
``enormously heartening to all who are concerned about the long-run
health of the U.S. economy.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater welcomed
Greenspan's comments, saying it was ``helpful just in knowing that
others see the goal of this process the same as we do, which is to
get interest rates down and to keep the economy growing.''
   While Greenspan said that the specific details of any Fed
response to a deficit-reduction package would depend on economic
conditions at the time, he left no doubt that the central bank
would move to offset any adverse effects on growth from spending
cuts and tax increases during a period of sluggish growth.
   ``I can only offer the assurance that the Federal Reserve will
act, as it has in the past, to endeavor to keep the economic
expansion on track,'' Greenspan said.
   The administration has been complaining for months that the Fed
has been overly concerned about inflationary pressures and was
keeping interest rates so high that economic growth was being
slowed to dangerously low levels.
   The Fed took a modest step toward easing last Friday. It
supplied enough additional cash to the banking system to push a key
interest rate, the federal funds rate, down from 8.25 percent to 8
percent, the first decline since last December.
   The drop in this rate, which banks charge each other for
overnight loans, triggered a big rally on Wall Street, pushing the
stock market to record highs, as investors expressed the hope that
further rate declines would be forthcoming. The market fell back
somewhat Wednesday.
   In his testimony, Greenspan confirmed that the Fed had eased
slightly last week, saying the action was taken to offset the
effects of banks becoming overly cautious in making loans.
   While refusing to characterize the situation as a full-scale
``credit crunch,'' Greenspan did say that the tougher loan policies
were ``beginning to have very real, unwelcome effects'' on economic
growth.
   Based on Greenspan's comments Wednesday, many analysts predicted
that the Fed would push the federal funds rate down by another 0.25
percentage point perhaps by Labor Day if Congress and the
administration have agreed on the outlines of a package cutting the
deficit by $50 billion to $60 billion by that time.
   In the Fed's economic forecast, the central bank showed a
willingness to tolerate lower economic growth than the
administration.
   The administration's revised economic forecast on Monday put
growth, as measured by the gross national product, at 2.2 percent
this year, increasing to 2.9 percent in 1991. The Fed's forecast
projected slower growth of between 1.5 percent and 2 percent this
year and between 1.75 percent and 2.5 percent in 1991.
   In assessing current developments, Greenspan said ``the
likelihood of a near-term recession seems low, in part because
businesses have been working hard to keep their inventories in line
with sales trends.''
   He said the country had an ``economy which is not on the edge of
either falling apart into a recession or about to take on highly
inflationary characteristics.''

   In New Jersey, at least, trash is sacred.
   The state's highest court, despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling
in the other direction, says police need a search warrant to
rummage through someone's garbage cans, even those at the curb.
   ``Garbage reveals much that is personal,'' the state Supreme
Court said Tuesday.
   Supreme courts in about a dozen other states have agreed with
the U.S. Supreme Court that garbage is part of the public domain.
   Rubbish!, said the New Jersey court, joining only Hawaii in
requiring warrants before the law may get within arm's length of a
person's trash.
   ``Undoubtedly many would be upset to see a neighbor or stranger
sifting through their garbage, perusing their discarded mail,
reading their bank statements, looking at their empty
pharmaceutical bottles, and checking receipts to see what
videotapes they rent ...,'' the court said over the objections of
law enforcement officials.
   Garbage, which New Jersey produces at the rate of 10 million
tons a year, should ``remain private from the meddling of the
state,'' the justices said in the 5-2 ruling.
   Law enforcement officials say the ruling will offer new
protections to criminals. Civil libertarians praised the court's
stance.

<HEAD>U.S. Judge: INS `Underhanded' Against Haitians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge criticized U.S. immigration
officials for ``underhanded tactics'' to deny asylum to Haitians.
   U.S. District Judge Eugene Spellman issued the opinion Tuesday
in the case of Haitian immigrant Noel Molaire, who had filed suit
saying he was deprived of his rights during an immigration appeals
hearing that ended with a deportation order against him.
   Spellman found the Immigration and Naturalization Service had
never told Molaire about free legal services available to him.
Spellman also said the immigration judge did not explain to Molaire
the purpose of his asylum hearing.
   ``INS has routinely engaged in underhanded tactics in dealing
with Haitians seeking asylum in this country, and has singled them
out for special discriminatory treatment,'' the judge wrote.
``Repeatedly this court and other federal courts have found that
INS has engaged in illegal practices and policies with respect to
Haitians.''
   Spellman, whose 1981 decision resulted in the freeing of 2,000
Haitians pending their immigration status hearings, ordered a new
hearing for Molaire.
   Cheryl Little, attorney for the Haitian Refugee Center here,
hailed the decision as another victory for those who complain that
Haitians are being subjected to tougher immigration standards than
are other refugees.
   Haitian activists have complained bitterly that Cubans and
Nicaraguans have been welcomed in Miami and other parts of the
United States, while Haitians are intercepted at sea and either
returned to Haiti or held at detention centers.
   ``We have never asked that they change the law with respect to
the Haitians,'' Ms. Little said Wednesday. ``We have only asked
that they enforce the laws on the books _ this decision tells them
that they have to follow the law.''
   She said her office has several similar cases in federal court,
and will bring Spellman's decision to their attention.
   But she added that federal courts have often ruled for Haitians
before.
   ``Our track record in federal court is pretty darn good because
the judges are usually outraged when they learn the extent to which
the Haitians' rights are violated,'' she said. ``But we don't have
the resources to go into federal court on every case.''
   In Washington, INS spokesman Duke Austin emphasized that
Spellman's decision applied to immigration judges, who are employed
by the Justice Department, not the INS.
   The Justice Department did not immediately return calls from The
Associated Press.
   Austin did take issue with Spellman's broad condemnation of the
INS.
   ``The question of discrimination against Haitians has been
litigated ... to the Supreme Court of the United States, and in no
forum was it found that there was discrimination against
Haitians,'' Austin said.

<TEXT>
   Operators of the long-delayed Seabrook
nuclear power plant prepared Wednesday for its first full-power
operation, with work unaffected by an accident in which a plant
employee was slightly injured.
   Full-power operation could come as early as Thursday morning,
``but it could be another day after that, too, so there's kind of a
wide window,'' spokesman David Scanzoni said.
   The $6.6 billion, 1,150-megawatt plant has been conducting tests
and gradually increasing power since receiving its federal license
in March. It was operating at 75 percent power Wednesday.
   Scanzoni said the worker was injured when an inch-thick
inspection window on a high-pressure steam tank shattered.
Fragments of glass flew about 12 feet, cutting his face and
striking one eye.
   The worker, whose name was not released, did not require
stitches and suffered only a slight eye injury, Scanzoni said. He
said the worker was treated by plant medics and at Exeter Hospital,
but returned to the plant to drive his car home.
   The window, 18 inches by one inch, was one of two in a tank
filled with steam at about 1,000 pounds per square inch of
pressure, Scanzoni said. He said the blown window released ``a
quick puff'' of non-radioactive steam before the tank was
automatically isolated.
   Scanzoni said the window would be replaced Wednesday.
   The tank, on the plant's non-nuclear side, is one of four that
collects steam after it has driven turbines to generate
electricity. The spent steam is condensed to be recycled through
steam generators to drive the turbines again.

<TEXT>
   It seemed an unlikely scene: in
a Palestinian village, local leaders were exchanging cordial words
with the defense minister of Israel's new right-wing government.
   But Moshe Arens aims to make such meetings commonplace.
   Arens is trying to reduce friction between with the 1.7 million
Palestinians in the occupied territories while at the same time
providing increased security for 70,000 Jewish settlers living in
their midst.
   It's a balancing act, and Arens knows it.
   Shortly after his friendly visit with Palestinian leaders in
Dura, a village of 14,000 people, he was with Jewish settlers in
Kiryat Arba, a fenced Israeli enclave overlooking the Arab town of
Hebron.
   In the background is the constant concern that a single violent
incident could re-ignite the 31-month-old Palestinian uprising and
further unsettle Israel's relations with the United States.
   Arens, a former foreign minister, is sensitive to the damage
done to Israel's public image abroad by the long, violent uprising,
a senior defnse official said.
   He believes a more sympathetic international attitude _ plus
calm in the occupied lands _ could open the way to Israel's
proposed Palestinian elections, followed by talks on autonomy.
   So Arens has embarked on a series of confidence-building
gestures. He released more than 400 prisoners, began a gradual
reopening of Palestinian universities closed during the uprising,
eased some travel restrictions for elderly Palestinians, and held
meetings like the one in Dura.
   ``This is one in a series of visits that I hold, with the
purpose of learning, hearing and making my opinions heard. The
effort is to stop the circle of violence and reach agreement about
peace,'' the defense minister said after meeting with Abdel Fata
Dudein, the Israeli-appointed mayor of Dura.
   Another change is in the priorities of the army.
   He ordered troops redeployed along main roads in the occupied
lands to protect settlers against stone throwers. At the same time,
army sources say, troops are not going as often into refugee camps
and small villages in an effort ``to disengage.''
   Arens seeks ``cessation of degrading treatment and superfluous
friction with the security forces ... a pinpoint method, without
need for collective punishment,'' according to Ron Ben-Ishai,
military commentator for the Hebrew daily Yediot Ahronot.
   Arabs already have noticed a difference in troop behavior. They
say soldiers are not as prone to force removal of outlawed
Palestinian flags or the painting over of anti-Israeli slogans.
They are even willing to ignore stone-throwing Palestinian youths.
   Last week in Palestine Square, the center of occupied Gaza City,
a Palestinian journalist watched a group of youths hurling rocks
and empty bottles at soldiers from the distance of about 30 yards.
   ``The soldiers totally ignored the youths _ it was amazing,''
the journalist said.
   During a recent visit to the Rafah refugee camp in Gaza, AP
reporters saw Palestinian flags and slogans, but were told troops
have not entered Rafah during daytime for the past month.
   ``We have no particular interest in keeping high concentration
of Israeli troops in the territories,'' Arens said in Dura. ``If we
can bring about a process whereby we can decrease the military
presence while at the same time also bring about a reduction of
violence, then that is certainly a policy I intend to pursue.''
   A clear result is the reduction in casualties. Not a single
Palestinian has died in a stone-throwing clash since June 25.
   Arens already has had some disappointments, however, and many
Palestinians are skeptical of his motives.
   After Arens met with three Palestinian mayors last month, two of
them announced they'd told the defense miniser Israel would have to
talk to the PLO. That's exactly what Israel wants to avoid.
   In Rafah, a 19-year-old activist named Subhi Abu Dahi was asked
about Israel's new policy.
   ``Arens only wants to improve the image of Israel in the world.
When he achieves this, he will go back to the old ways,'' the
teen-ager replied.

<HEAD>Cheney Says Soviets Have Begun Process of Reducing Military Size</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN WOLMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Wednesday
that the Soviet Union had ``begun the process of reducing the size
of its military,'' but predicted Moscow would hold fast to its
nuclear weapons capability even in the face of economic crisis.
   ``That's what makes them a superpower, and they won't give it
up,'' he told a group of journalists.
   Cheney was asked if the United States was ``still No. 1'' in the
world.
   ``We are No. 1. We're now enjoying the fruits of years of
effort,'' he said at a luncheon at the American Enterprise
Institute. ``There is only one true superpower left in the world. I
would argue it's the United States.''
   Soviet military retrenchment is one of several conditions
imposed by Bush before the United States will consider sending
direct aid to help Moscow's ravaged economy. Cheney said the United
States accepts the estimate that 25 percent of the Soviet economy
has been utilized for military spending.
   He said the Soviet economy is so weak that high rates of
military spending are ``no longer sustainable.''
   The United States, Cheney said, already has noted reductions in
Soviet military spending for tank production and general
procurement. He said the Soviets were ``scrapping old naval units
and parking old military hardware.''
   Cheney said Europe would be ``relatively free of Soviet troops''
by 1995. That, he said, will ``radically alter our own force
deployment in Europe,'' which is to say it would decline.
   Mikhail Gorbachev's decision to drop his opposition to a unified
Germany in NATO ``removed the last roadblock'' to getting two arms
agreements, he said. Gorbachev and President Bush have pledged to
conclude a conventional forces agreement and a U.S.-Soviet
strategic arms treaty.
   Cheney noted that the Soviets are on a timetable to pull troops
out of Hungary and Czechoslovakia by the end of 1991 and agreed
earlier this week to abandon its positions in East Germany by 1994.
That would leave Soviet troops only in Poland and Cheney said he
assumed there also would be a pullout agreement covering Poland.
   Asked about Gorbachev, Cheney said he thought the Soviet
president had been in ``big trouble this spring,'' but was
strengthened by the Washington summit with Bush, the NATO summit in
London and the Communist party Congress that just ended in Moscow.
   ``I've watched the guy with absolute fascination,'' Cheney said.
``He's like the guy you see in the log-rolling contests in the
Northwest. He has this amazing ability to stay on top of the log.''

   A replica of the brigantine Niagra, flying a
15-star American flag and Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's ``Don't
Give Up The Ship'' banner sailed Lake Erie Wednesday in its first
sea trial.
   The 182-foot, 278-ton Niagara sailed out of its Erie port onto
the waters where Perry's nine-ship squadron defeated six British
ships during the War of 1812.
   The replica contains 42 pieces of Perry's flagship, mostly
metal, but those parts make up just 20 percent of the present-day
Niagra. It is owned by the state of Pennsylvania, which paid part
of the $3.8 million restoration cost and plans to spend $5 million
on a dock and museum.
   Sailboats and powerboats escorted the Niagara into the lake,
where a crew of 30 handled the ship's 15 sails and executed turns
on placid waters near Presque Isle State Park.
   The crew, led by marine architect Melbourne Smith, wore blue
jeans and red T-shirts. The ship's cannons, cast in steel during
1813's Battle of Lake Erie, were made of aluminum to save weight on
the top deck.
   The Niagara's formal commissioning is scheduled for Aug. 18.
   On Sept. 13, 1813, Perry's first flagship, the USS Lawrence, was
disabled by British fire and Perry moved to the Niagara, where he
flew his famous blue-and-white battle flag and attacked again.
   The Niagara helped break British Commodore Robert Heroit
Barclay's battle line, forcing him to surrender.
   Perry reported to his superiors: ``We have met the enemy and
they are ours.''

<HEAD>Administration Opposes Bill for LaGuardia, Kennedy, O'Hare and
National</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said Wednesday it
opposes Senate legislation aimed at fostering airline competition
by increasing use of four hevaily used airports and by banning the
sale of takeoff and landing rights.
   ``We oppose its enactment for a variety of practical reasons,''
Assistant Transportation Secretary Jeffrey N. Shane told the
aviation subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science
and Transportation.
   The ban on sales of takeoff and landing ``slots'' in the bill
would restrict competition instead of enhancing it by making it
harder for new operators to compete, he said.
   A takeoff or landing slot at a busy time can command up to $1
million in inter-company trading. Critics say small airlines are
shut out now because they find the price too high. At many
airports, one airline controls most of the slots.
   Legislation backed by the subcommittee chairman, Sen. Wendell H.
Ford, D-Ky., would lift the ``high-density rule'' at Kennedy
International and LaGuardia airports in New York, O'Hare
International in Chicago and Washington National and make slots
available to new companies in those markets.
   ``Getting rid of the high-density rule does not mean that
thousands more flights will be going into these airports every
day,'' said Ford. ``It does mean that traffic will no longer be
constrained by artificial numbers, and entry for new carriers will
no longer be blocked.''
   The 21-year-old rule has limited the number of flights per hour
to manage traffic flow and, in Washington, to curb noise. The limit
varies from airport to airport.
   ``The justification for the rule today is largely the same as in
1969,'' said Shane: Controllers could safely handle traffic but
could not guarantee that flights would take off and land on time.
   LaGuardia is the worst U.S. airport for delayed flights,
followed immediately by O'Hare, and Kennedy is ranked fourth, Shane
said. Those airports have 30 percent of all air traffic delays in
the country even though they account for only 4 percent of total
operations.
   Further operations at those airports would add to delays
elsewhere, by causing connecting flights to fall behind schedule,
he added.
   Although National is not as troublesome, ``any substantial
increase in jet operations could quickly increase the number of
operating delays to an unacceptable level,'' Shane said.
   The Air Transport Association of America, which represents 22
scheduled air carriers, supports the proposed legislation but said
its two members operating shuttle service in Boston, New York and
Washington oppose the change.
   Officers of Pan Am and Trump Shuttle say ending the rule would
make reliable scheduling impossible for their heavily used hourly
flights.

<HEAD>Death Toll in Kirghizia Unrest Climbs Over 200</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethnic rioters burned buildings and attacked a
police officer in the Central Asian republic of Kirghizia
overnight, leaving four people dead, the Tass news agency said
Wednesday.
   The latest violence between ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks _ both
Sunni Moslem groups _ brought the death toll to 204 since fighting
began June 4, the official news agency said.
   Ethnic unrest continued along the Armenian-Azerbaijan border in
the Caucasus, meanwhile, and Soviet television reported armed bands
of Armenians were making forays across the frontier.
   At least 200 people have died the past two years in ethnic
violence in the Caucasus Mountain republics of Azerbaijan, which is
predominantly Shiite Moslem, and Armenia, which is predominantly
Christian.
   Clashes Tuesday night in Osh, Uzgen and other towns in western
Kirghizia left about 100 people injured, including more than 30
people who suffered gunshot and stab wounds, the Komsomolskaya
Pravda newspaper called.
   Most of the violence took place in Osh, on the republic's border
with Uzbekistan, and in its suburbs, following unsanctioned
rallies, Tass said.
   ``In Osh itself, transport is at a standstill, and industrial
enterprises and shops are closed,'' the news agency said.
``Military helicopters are patrolling the city and armored vehicles
are posted on crossroads.''
   During the night, Tass said, buildings were set ablaze, a
policeman was beaten and a submachine gun was taken during an
attempt to break up a fight. The weapon was later returned to the
military, the news agency said.
   According to Tass, the chairman of the Osh regional Executive
Committee and the local police chief were replaced Tuesday by the
regional authorities. The officials were not identified.
   The violence stems from a land dispute between ethnic Kirghiz
and Uzbeks in the densely populated region around Osh, where
housing is scarce.
   Damage from the unrest has been put at $64 million,
Komsomolskaya Pravda said.
   A state of emergency is in effect in the Osh region, and
reinforcements of police and Interior Ministry troops have been
sent to the region to quell the violence.
   ``Today, many towns and settlements look like small military
fortresses,'' Komsomolskaya Pravda said.
   The newpaper said barbed wire has been placed around settlements
to prevent soldiers and police from entering.
   ``The regional military commandant gave several orders for these
fortifications and barbed wire to be destroyed, but no one seems in
a hurry to obey these orders,'' the newspaper said.
   Soviet Central Asia, with high levels of poverty and
unemployment, has been hit repeatedly by violence since President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev began to relax central controls.

   Pop star Madonna went jogging in Hyde Park on
Wednesday and missed out on an invitation to join fellow pop stars
launching a charity record for Romanian orphans.
   Madonna arrived in London on Wednesday and went for a run in the
central London Park, surrounded by eight bodyguards and pursued by
reporters, photographers and fans.
   When the crowd got too close the bodyguards stepped in and the
singer, wearing skin-tight yellow cycling shorts, a T-shirt and
baseball cap, said: ``Uh oh, this is going to get rough.''
   Olivia Harrison, chairwoman of the Romanian Angel Appeal, said
she invited Madonna to join her husband, former Beatle George
Harrison, and his fellow ex-Beatle Ringo Starr for the launch of
the record ``Nobody's Child.''
   The lunch-time event was held at the Hyde Park Hotel where
Madonna is staying for her ``Blonde Ambition'' tour, but she did
not show up.
   Mrs. Harrison said the Romanian Angel Appeal raised $1.8
million, which will go to improve food, clothing, care and training
at orphanages in Romania.

<TEXT>
   Five bomb-squad experts were killed Wednesday when
plastic explosives they were using blew up as they were trying to
deactivate a buried cache of World War II artillery shells.
   The men belonged to a special unit assigned to help dispose of
more than 2,660 German shells found this month along a roadway
outside Epervans, in east-central France.
   Investigators said the plastic explosives were to be used to
destroy the latest batch of shells extracted from the site, which
is south of Dijon. It was not immediately known what caused the
plastic explosives to detonate.
   A civilian driving a bulldozer suffered slight burns and was
hospitalized. He was reported in good condition.
   The names of the five victims, who came from different parts of
the country, were not immediately released.
   Interior Minister Pierre Joxe visited the mortuary where the
bodies were taken, saying he wanted to pay homage to ``five men who
participated in a very dangerous mission.''
   After a 20-year-old man from Epervans was killed by a shell on
May 21, authorities began investigating whether other 20mm and 37mm
shells might be buried nearby.
   A large-scale clearing operation was launched July 9, and 2,668
shells have been dug up and destroyed.
   A new team of bomb disposal experts arrived on the scene
Wednesday afternoon, within three hours of the blast, and was
expected to continue the operation for at least two more weeks.
   Most of the shells have been found in a concentrated area, and a
security fence has been erected to keep the public away.
   Epervans' mayor, Daniel Malot, said he was distraught at the
deaths but stressed the clearing operation must continue ``because
there's a time bomb under our community.''
   According to official records, 608 members of the special
explosives unit have been killed since it was created in 1945 to
dispose of mines, bombs and shells left over from the war.
   About 500 of the deaths, along with 800 injuries, occurred in
the first two years of the unit's operations. During those years,
the unit neutralized about 13 million mines, 6 million shells and
90,000 bombs.
   The unit, made up of 125 men at 19 regional centers, also has
been used to defuse explosives placed by terrorists.

   About 1,600 county workers will be switched
to a four-day work week in the latest move to cut traffic and thin
the smog that sits over Southern California.
   The county Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to close the
headquarters of the Department of Public Works in suburban Alhambra
on Fridays, and put its employees on a 10-hour, four-day week. It
is the latest effort to meet demands by the regional air-quality
authority for big employers to reduce travel by their employees.
   Public Works Director Thomas A. Tidemanson said that in addition
to reducing smog, the change would save the county $1.7 million a
year and wouldn't affect the department's efficiency.
   But Supervisor Pete Schabarum, the only one on the five-member
board to vote against the plan, wasn't so sure.
   He said the change sends a message to the public that ``the
county of Los Angeles is only in business four days a week.''

<TEXT>
   Spain's historically warm relations with
Cuba, its former colony, are souring as Cubans seek refuge in
foreign embassies on the island that Madrid once called its ``pearl
of the Caribbean.''
   But diplomatic sources say Spain wants to keep communications
open with Cuba, despite the increasingly bitter exchanges between
Cuban officials and Spain's foreign minister, Francisco Fernandez
Ordonez.
   On Wednesday, Spain recalled its ambassador to Cuba in the
latest friction between the two countries.
   It made the move after the Communist government of Cuba issued a
statement calling Fernandez Ordonez an ``anxious colonial
administrator.'' It said he was guilty of ``historical amnesia,
paternalism and scandalous ignorance.''
   Cuba's was reacting to remarks by the foreign minister earlier
Wednesday. Referring to the role played in the collapse of
Communist governments in Eastern Europe last fall by asylum-seekers
at Western embassies there, Fernandez Ordonez indicated to
reporters Castro knew he risked the demise of his own government if
he opened Cuba's doors to all who want to leave.
   An editorial comic strip Wednesday in the leading daily, El
Pais, showed Castro calling Fernandez Ordonez ``irresponsible'' and
the foreign minister turning the other cheek and offering asylum to
Castro ``whenever you need it.''
   Many Spaniards believe Cuba will inevitably undergo a transition
to democracy. The strip suggested that Spain could eventually play
a mediating role.
   In a sign of displeasure over Castro's threat to ship all the
island's undesirables to European Economic Community countries,
Spain has canceled a meeting of the Spanish-Cuban commission on
economic and industrial cooperation.
   Spain is Cuba's leading Western supplier of goods and, after the
Soviet Union, its leading creditor. Cuba owes it $800 million-$900
million.
   According to the Economy Ministry, much of the debt dates to the
right-wing authoritarian government of Gen. Francisco Franco, who
maintained close ties with Castro despite their ideological
differences.
   Spain ruled Cuba as a colony from the 16th century to 1898.
Castro's father came from northwestern Spain, and Castro still has
relatives there.
   Castro made his threat Saturday following criticism from
European Economic Community nations. They said Cuba should respect
international conventions governing the inviolability of embassies
and the right to asylum.
   The Spanish Foreign Ministry's reaction was low-key when three
Cubans sought refuge in the Spanish Embassy in Havana last week
after another group of Cubans had entered the Czechoslovak Embassy.
Officials said Spain would not force the Cubans to leave and would
try to negotiate their departure.
   When armed Cuban police stormed the Spanish Embassy on Friday in
pursuit of a fourth Cuban seeking refuge and dragged him away, the
ministry protested _ and got backing from the European nations.
   Another Cuban sought refuge in the Spanish Embassy on Wednesday,
bringing to four the number of Cubans inside the mission, the
Spanish news agency EFE reported from Cuba's capital.
   That would bring to at least 13 the total number of Cuban
asylum-seekers in the Havana embassies or residences of
Czechoslovakia, Spain and Italy.
   Fernandez Ordonez told a parliamentary commission Wednesday that
Spain would continue to offer refuge to all Cubans seeking asylum
and would keep on negotiating ``with patience and firmness.''
   Cuba's Communist Party ideology chief, Carlos Aldana, criticized
Fernandez Ordonez on Tuesday in a conversation with foreign
reporters in Cuba, saying Cuba would never negotiate over the fate
of the Cubans seeking refuge in foreign embassies.
   ``The Spanish government is going to have to raise its operating
budget for its Havana embassy to feed them (the refuge-seekers) for
an indefinite period of time,'' he said. He added if European
Economic Community nations are so eager to receive Cuban
asylum-seekers, the government would be happy to draw up an
agreement to make this possible.
   Castro, Aldana and official Cuban government statements refer to
the asylum-seekers as troublemakers and social misfits.

   The Army on Wednesday reaffirmed plans to ship
several hundred tons of U.S. chemical weapons from storage sites in
West Germany to a Pacific atoll for destruction in incinerators now
being tested.
   To meet federal environmental requirements the Army had
considered several alternatives, including leaving the chemical
weapons in Germany or moving them to the United States for
destruction at incinerators now on the drawing boards.
   In announcing its decision to stick to its original plan for
destroying the chemical agents on Johnston Island, the Army said
the operation ``is expected to have minimal public health, safety
and environmental effects'' on Johnson Island and the Pacific area.
The island is about 700 miles southwest of Hawaii.
   The Army began testing the $240 million Johnston Atoll Chemical
Agent Disposal System on June 30. It halted the tests on the same
day after encountering what Army officials called minor problems;
testing resumed last weekend.
   The plant is expected to start full-scale operations in 1992.
   Congress ordered the Army in 1985 to destroy its arsenal of
older chemical weapons, including those in West Germany, by 1997.
The size of the stockpile is classified but is believed to be about
30,000 tons.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed
at their meeting in Washington in early June to reduce their
nation's stockpiles of chemical weapons by 80 percent over the next
decade.

<TEXT>
   Two senators proposed an expansion in the
nation's educational exchange program Wednesday so American
students can learn more about the new democracies budding
throughout the world.
   Democratic Sens. David Boren of Oklahoma and Claiborne Pell of
Rhode Island introduced a bill that in four years would send $200
million to offer 5,000 scholarships to American students and
another 5,000 to foreign students interested in a two-way
educational exchange program.
   The new program would focus on countries currently
underrepresented by the United States, such as the Soviet Union and
areas in Eastern Europe, said Pell, chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
   Pell, who was instrumental in doubling the exchange programs
between from 1981 to 1985, said ``the time has come for another
quantum leap in our exchange programs'' with the end of the Cold
War.
   The program, Pell said, helps to open minds of future leaders
and pointed to Alexander Yakolev, Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev's architect for perestroika, who spent a year in the
United States in the late 1950s on the Fulbright program.
   ``Our isolationist approach to education has rendered us
woefully ignorant of the international community in which we
live,'' agreed Boren. ``And that ignorance severely limits our
ability to enter into global exchange.''
   Boren said all Japanese high school students speak fluent
English, mainly because they are required to take six years of it
to graduate. In comparison, 2@100 of 1 percent of American students
studied Japanese in the United States. Fewer than 25 percent of
American high school students study a foreign language.
   More than 10 times as many foreigners study in the United States
as Americans study in foreign countries. In 1988, 356,000 foreign
students studied in America, with more than 50 percent from Asia.
In the same year, only 33,000 American students studied abroad for
a semester or more. Almost 50 percent went to Great Britain, West
Germany, and France.
   The U.S. Information Agency would administer the program
providing the 10,000 exchange scholarships by 1994. The bill would
authorize $50 million in fiscal 1991, adding $50 million increases
each year through 1994.

<HEAD>Young Looks for Support Among White Leaders, Says Miller Unfit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Andrew Young made overtures to white leaders
Wednesday as he began his uphill battle to become the first black
governor of Georgia after a disappointing second-place finish in
the first round of the primary.
   Young stepped up his attacks on opponent Lt. Gov. Zell Miller,
who led the five-man primary field Tuesday. He said Miller was
temperamentally unfit to be governor.
   Miller said his campaign was nearly broke, and called on Young
to abide by a new state law that puts a $3,500 cap on individual
campaign contributions. Young said he would ignore the law, which
won't take effect until it is approved by the U.S. Justice
Department.
   The exchange appeared to fulfill both candidates' forecasts that
the gentlemanly veneer of the campaign was likely to be marred by
the scuffling of elbows and bare knuckles in the campaign for the
Aug. 7 runoff.
   Nearly complete returns from Tuesday's voting _ 2,417 of 2,446
precincts _ showed Miller with 424,750 votes, or 41 percent, to
Young's 297,137, or 29 percent.
   Political analysts were skeptical that Young could overcome
Miller's lead. A candidate with over 40 percent of the first
primary vote and leading his closest rival by more than 5
percentage points will ``never lose the runoff,'' said Merle Black,
professor of political science at Emory University and an authority
on Southern politics.
   Can Young pull of a victory? Black was asked.
   ``Naw,'' he said. ``He's a goner.''
   State Sen. Roy Barnes, who finished third with 215,128, or 21
percent of the vote, has refused to endorse either of his former
rivals.
   But Barnes played down speculation that his conservative
supporters would bolt to the Republican Party in November and
support nominee Johnny Isakson. Isakson, a state representative,
won 65 percent of the votes in the GOP primary, easily defeating
three challengers.
   Young told reporters Wednesday morning that he placed calls to
Barnes and other white Democratic leaders, including state House
Speaker Tom Murphy, U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn and former Sen. Herman
Talmadge, hoping to enlist their support.
   He said he had not specifically asked for endorsements, and that
none were offered.
   Young used his news conference to repeat a theme that he
unveiled Monday: that Miller won't be able to deliver on a promise
to allow Georgians to vote on legalizing a state lottery because he
can't get along with legislators.
   Despite serving 16 years as Georgia's lieutenant governor,
Miller ``still lacks the ability to convince his own colleagues in
the Legislature that the voters of Georgia demand the right to vote
on this issue,'' Young said.
   ``On the other hand, I have a record as a negotiator ... and I
think I have the leadership skills to get that lottery vote out of
the Legislature and onto the ballot.''
   Young, the former Atlanta mayor and U.N. ambassador under
President Carter, has said Georgians should have a right to vote on
the lottery question, although he personally does not like
lotteries.
   Miller aide Bill Stephens showed up at Young's news conference
and handed him a letter in which Miller said, ``I implore you one
last time to abide by the reform's $3,500 cap. ... We cannot afford
to concede the ethics issue to the Republican Party.''
   Young said he would not abide by the law, passed by the 1990
Legislature. Young has noted that Miller had the most campaign
funds early in the race.
   Young acknowledged that black voter turnout appeared to be lower
than in previous elections, and promised to concentrate on bringing
out black voters in the second round.
   Returns from some precincts indicated Young had drawn fewer
black voters than Jesse Jackson did in the 1988 presidential
primary. Miller, meanwhile, said the 10-12 percent of the black
vote he won had ``exceeded our expectations.''
   In one virtually all-black precinct in Young's hometown of
Atlanta, Miller picked up 25 percent of the vote to Young's 73
percent.
   In a black precinct in Savannah, where Jackson polled 93
percent, Young won 89 percent _ and the turnout was more than 100
votes lower than the 1988 primary, which Jackson won.

   A Senate subcommittee Wednesday approved $318
million, the amount requested by President Bush, for the super
collider atom smasher in the next fiscal year.
   The energy and water subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations
Committee granted the money without conditions on foreign
participation made by the House.
   The full committee will vote Thursday on the collider money
contained in a $20.9 billion appropriations bill.
   The $8 billion, 54-miles-around underground tunnel to be built
south of Dallas has met few problems gaining financing approval
this year.
   The House approved $318 million last month, $169 million of it
for beginning construction.
   Another House bill would limit federal participation to $5
billion, with the balance of funds to come from the state and
foreign participants, and would bar participation by foreign
companies in more than one-third of any component of the project.
This House bill may not be taken up by the Senate.
   Nearly all government appropriations are subject to the final
spending goal of the budget summit between administration and
congressional leaders.

   The deep, resonant voice, so familiar
to generations of Americans, booms through the tiny room,
accompanied by the mournful whistle of a train in the background.
   ``I never thought of being the president of the United States,''
says the recorded Richard Nixon. ``My goal was to become a railroad
engineer.''
   But president he did become, the most controversial one of his
century.
   Now admirers or detractors will be able to visit his first home,
the bed in which he was born, the high chair where he sat and the
piano he played.
   The guide to the 900-foot square house, built by his father from
a kit, is Nixon himself.
   ``The living room was the center of our life,'' his voice tells
the visitor. The parents discussed current events at dinner,
soliciting, in turn, the opinions of the four Nixon boys _ Richard,
Donald, Harold and Edward, all the names of British kings.
   ``My father believed that no one was too young to have an
opinion,'' Nixon says.
   Nixon was born in his parents' bedroom, the only one in the
house, on Jan. 9, 1913. Then, the view was of citrus groves. Now,
the nine-acre site is in the midst of urban sprawl, as easy to pass
by as the real estate office across the street and its hastily
erected sign: ``Welcome U.S. presidents.''
   The architects worked to recall the pastoral feel of the area in
Nixon's youth by ordering 44 citrus trees planted near the
reflecting pool which separates the library from the Birthplace.
   Nixon slept with his brothers in two beds in a room upstairs,
reaching it by a stairway two feet wide. The furnishings were
sparse; along one wall, a small niche served as a study desk.
   While the library fairly crackles with the controversies that
shaped Nixon's political career, the house is a reminder of a
simpler past. Outside the front door is a plaque erected by his
neighbors: ``We are proud of our native son, a man who has spared
nothing of himself to help build a great nation.''
   On the bed is a coverlet _ the visitor is assured it is the one
on which Nixon was born _ bearing the date 1837. The Crown upright
piano has sheet music Nixon used as he learned to play. There is
the violin he played, and the clarinet on which he tootled.
   His mother's Bible is on a dresser. Over the bed are two
pictures inside a frame made by the young Nixon. In the living room
is a composite picture of the Nixon sons.
   The sewing room _ more of a closet _ has a Singer sewing machine
and a basket filled with knitting and a box of J.P. Coats thread.
The kitchen has a St. Clair stove and an ice chest.
   Nixon's narrative talks of his mother's baking prowess _ ``her
specialty was angel food cake'' _ and he winds up by referring to
the modest nature of the home.
   His family's time spent in that house, he said, ``made up in
love for what it lacked in size.''

   The Atlas 1 rocket is scheduled to lift off from Cape Canaveral

   Friday's launch, announced Wednesday, is three days later than
planned. NASA last week postponed Tuesday's scheduled launch
because of what appeared to be a problem with the satellite's

   The system later tested fine, however, and it was determined
radio interference had affected the primary command decoder, said
NASA spokesman George Diller.

   A government spokesman reacted strongly Wednesday
to Bush administration plans to open a dialogue with Communist
Party opponents, telling U.S. officials not to offer opponents
``encouragement or assistance.''
   The warning came amid new defections from the ruling party:
seven prominent Soviet parliamentarians announced that they were
following the lead of reformers such as Boris N. Yeltsin, who quit
the party last week.
   And editor Vitaly Korotich of the glasnost weekly Ogonyok said
his newspaper will announce Thursday it was severing ties with the
Communist Party, which publishes the magazine.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Monday he thought it
would be appropriate for the Bush administration to ``touch base''
with the Soviet opposition as it has with the opposition in other
countries in Eastern Europe.
   Organizations in the United States have given millions of
dollars to the cause of the non-Communist opposition movement in
Poland.
   Although it is not clear yet whether such assistance would be
given to opposition groups in the Soviet Union, Arkady Maslennikov,
a spokesman for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, clearly drew the
line at aid.
   ``I think the limit is if you meet people and discuss whatever
matters you wish, that is your business,'' Maslennikov said at a
briefing.
   ``But if it is a kind of encouragement or assistance ... (like)
to some other countries, Poland and so on, that will be
interference in the internal affairs of the Soviet Union and would
hardly be tolerated.
   ``I think to finance in any form ... political forces that are
striving to come to power would be quite immoral from the point of
view of international relations, illegal from the point of view of
international law.
   ``It's one thing when you donate money for charity business, to
fight disease or to help people in need, say after earthquake or
any other disaster, and another thing when you are financing
political forces,'' he said.
   Maslennikov said Baker's comments about opening a dialogue with
radical reformers who quit the party last week ``cannot but raise
questions and bewilderment.''
   Baker had said it wasn't clear whether Yeltsin and the others
who quit the party ``are going to develop any kind of multiparty
democracy.''
   ``We don't know yet if that is going to happen,'' Baker said in
Paris after a meeting on German unification. ``If it does happen,
we ought to approach it as we have in other countries.''
   As Central and Eastern European states have broken with Moscow,
Baker said, the Bush administration has established a dialogue with
opposition groups that showed democratic traits.
   ``We have taken care to touch base with the opposition, to make
sure that we understand where the opposition is coming from, that
they understand where we are coming from. And I don't think that's
inappropriate just because it's the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Yeltsin, president of the Russian republic, said he could not
stay in the Communist Party at a time when a multiparty system is
emerging. Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov and Leningrad Mayor Anatoly
Sobchak also quit the party.
   The latest to quit were parliamentarians Sergei Stankevich, a
leader of the Democratic Platform bloc in the Communist Party;
Vladimir Tikhonov, a leader of the cooperative small business

   Korotich, whose magazine is known for its hard-hitting criticism
of the bureaucracy, said Wednesday night Ogonyok would publish a
historic announcement Thursday.
   ``Tomorrow, our magazine will publish a decree on the separation
of party and state,'' he said, announcing the break from the party.
   Ogonyok is published by Pravda, the newspaper of the party
Central Committee. It was not clear whether the party would
continue to publish the magazine.
   Bocharov announced he was quitting the party on Sunday at a huge
anti-Communist rally outside the Kremlin.
   The seven legislators said they were quitting ``to facilitate
the process of democratizing the country.''
   Gorbachev said last week he has nothing but ``contempt'' for
prominent Communists who left the party.

   Logging would be banned across half of the
old-growth forests currently unprotected in the Pacific Northwest,
a total of more than 2.7 million acres, under a bill introduced on
Wednesday.
   ``It is hypocritical for our nation's leaders to dictate that
other countries stop destroying the fragile ecosystems of rain
forests when we are destroying the fragile ecosystems of our
ancient forests,'' said Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., author of the
bill.
   Vento, chairman of the Interior Subcommittee on National Parks
and Public Lands, said the measure represents a long-term solution
to the Northwest's timber supply crisis as a ``bitter controversy''
rages over protection of the rare northern spotted owl.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service declared the owl a threatened
species on June 22. A panel of government scientists led by Forest
Service biologist Jack Ward Thomas said in April that the owl is on
the road to extinction unless logging stops on 3 million acres of
old-growth forests currently open to timber harvests.
   The government estimates such vast set asides would reduce
harvests on federal lands in the region by nearly 50 percent at a
cost of more than 20,000 timber jobs.
   Thomas, testifying before another House panel on Wednesday, said
experts on the owl tried without success for six months to develop
a different strategy to protect the endangered bird. A new
government timber task force is now trying to do that same job in
six weeks.
   Vento, who listed Interior Committee Chairman Morris Udall,
D-Ariz., as a cosponsor of the bill, was sharply critical of
President Bush's failure to provide substantive proposals to make
good on his promise to strike a balance between the needs of the
owl and the Northwest's timber industry.
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., was the sole Northwest lawmaker to
announce his support for the bill on Wednesday.
   ``The bill helps shift the focus of debate from protection of
one species, the spotted owl, to protection of the old growth
ecosystems that support owls and other species. It also recognizes
the need to reduce timber sales to sustainable levels,'' McDermott
said.
   Vento's bill also includes a number of provisions for economic
relief to the Northwest in the form of technical assistance to
modernize mills, improve wood utilization techniques, develop more
efficient harvesting methods and accelerate reforestation.
   He also proposed special programs to build recreational and
facilities and trails, implement new forestry techniques and
enhance new wildlife habitat and watersheds. He said the
combination of such efforts eventually could add as much as 10,000
jobs and 2 billion board feet in timber harvests to the region.
   The proposed Ancient Forest Act of 1990 will receive a hearing
before Vento's subcommittee on Tuesday.
   In all, it would create a 6.3 million acre ancient forest
reserve system on 17 national forests and six Bureau of Land
Management districts across Oregon, Washington and northern
California. All but 2.7 million acres of that land already is off
limits to logging as national parks, wilderness areas and other
areas set aside under current forest management plans enacted by
the Forest Service and BLM.
   The boundaries of the system would be designated within three
years by the Forest Service and BLM after receiving recommendations
from a newly proposed Ancient Forest Scientific Committee.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Order Bone-Marrow Transplant Tests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Wednesday refused to order 3-year-old
twins to undergo tests that would determine if they could donate
bone marrow to their leukemia-stricken half-brother.
   The children's father had asked the court to force the twins to
have the blood tests and donate bone marrow if they are compatible
donors. Tamas Bosze argued that bone-marrow transplantation is the
only hope for his 12-year-old son, Jean-Pierre.
   But Circuit Judge Monica Reynolds sided with the twins' mother,
who said the tests would be an invasion of privacy.
   ``It is the finding of this court that an order forcing the
twins to submit to a blood test and possibly to a bone marrow
harvesting at a later date would be an invasion of their
constitutional rights of privacy,'' Ms. Reynolds said in a written
ruling.
   The plight of Jean-Pierre, Bosze's son by another woman,
``evokes sympathy from all who've heard the story, but the court
has no authority to grant plaintiff's motion,'' the judge said.
   ``To subject a healthy child to bodily intrusions, against the
will of the custodial parent in order to attempt to save a diseased
child ... is not a duty the courts can impose upon a child or
anyone else,'' she said.
   Bosze said he would appeal the ruling.
   Nancy Curran, the twins' mother and Bosze's former girlfriend,
was not in court. Ms. Curran has sole custody of the twins, a boy
and a girl.
   ``I'm still hoping she's going to change her mind,'' said Bosze.
   Jean-Pierre's physician, Dr. Jong J. Kwon, said the potential to
save the boy's life outweighs the slight risks _ including pain,
possible anemia or infection _ involved in testing and then
extracting bone marrow.
   Jean-Pierre, who was diagnosed with leukemia in 1989, lives with
his father and attends school. But his condition is not improving
and he must undergo several doses of chemotherapy a week, said
Kwon, of Lutheran General Hospital in suburban Park Ridge.
   ``Even though he's a very strong boy, he is sometimes wishing to
give up,'' Kwon said.
   The boy's parents and other family members are not compatible
donors.
   Publicity about the case prompted hundreds of people to offer to
donate bone marrow, and so far, four potential donors ``may have
similar typing with Jean-Pierre,'' Kwon said.

<HEAD>Manufacturer Of Flawed Hubble Mirrors Certified By Air Force,
Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former NASA Administrator James Beggs said
Wednesday that the manufacturer of the flawed Hubble Space
Telescope mirrors was certified by the Air Force and that the space
agency was assured the work would be properly tested.
   Beggs, NASA administrator from 1981 to 1986, said that Perkin
Elmer, the Danbury, Conn., company that made the mirrors, had done
similar work in the past for the Defense Department of and the Air
Force had assured the agency the work would be done properly on
Hubble.
   ``NASA had every right to expect the contractor to grind that
lens to the right figure (prescription),'' Beggs told a Senate
appropriations subcommittee. ``We had been assured that the Perkin
Elmer people were competent,'' he said, noting that their work had
been ``certified by the Air Force.''
   Beggs said Perkin Elmer was chosen for the Hubble job ``because
they had done this many times in the past.''
   Perkin Elmer, now Hughes Danbury Optical Inc., has been
identified in published reports as a major contractor in the
manufacture of spy satellites optics. It has been paid about $451
million for its work on the Hubble telescope.
   Because of national security considerations, Beggs said, NASA
agreed to put only a limited number of supervisors in the Perkin
Elmer plant while the Hubble mirrors were being made.
   He said that the NASA work in the Perkin Elmer plant was split
into different parts of the facility and that access to some areas
by NASA supervisors was limited.
   ``NASA was put in the position of not having as much visibility
of the project as it normally does,'' said Beggs. ``It was a very
awkward way to do it.''
   But, in an apparent reference to the Air Force, Beggs said, ``we
were assured by a lot of sources that adequate oversight was in
place'' to make sure the mirrors were made and tested properly.
   The Hubble Space Telescope, built at a cost of $1.5 billion, was
discovered last month to be incapable of focusing as planned. NASA
said it appears that an error was made in the manufacture of the
94-inch primary mirror. Although the mirror cannot be replaced in
the orbiting telescope, NASA plans to fix the problem starting in
1993, when the space shuttle will be used to install instruments in
Hubble that have optics that will correct the focus flaw.
   Beggs became NASA administrator after the mirrors had been
ground and polished, but before they had been coated, the final
step in their manufacture.
   He testified that he was concerned about the Hubble work and
went to the Perkin Elmer plant in Danbury where he was assured then
that proper tests would be run to check the accuracy of the mirrors.
   The former administrator said NASA officials discussed a final
test of the Hubble, after the mirrors were installed in the
telescope, but decided it was not necessary.
   ``We were assured that it (an assembled test) would not yield
anything that was not determined by tests of the individual
mirrors,'' said Beggs.
   NASA has come under criticism by some in Congress for not
conducting a fully-assembled test of the Hubble telescope. NASA
engineers have said that such a test would have cost hundreds of
millions of dollars because a special facility would have had to be
built to protect the telescope from contamination.
   Beggs' testimony was before the senate appropriations
subcommittee on independent agencies, chaired by Sen. Barbara A.
Mikulski, D-Md.

<TEXT>
   Fresh from giving the new U.S.-backed
government a political drubbing, the Sandinistas have taken charge
of celebrating the 11th anniversary of the Nicaraguan revolution.
   July 19 is a national holiday, but the party will be pure
Sandinista.
   Banners, red-and-black party flags and Sandinista posters were
being trucked over to a downtown plaza Wednesday.
   Workers were nailing together the platform where dancers and
musicians will entertain Thursday and former President Daniel
Ortega will speak.
   Ortega, intent on capitalizing on his party's most recent
political victory, has been behaving as though he were still in
office, presiding at public rallies, inaugurating water pipes and
roads, and speaking at induction ceremonies for new Sandinista
militants.
   Barricada, the party newspaper, has been feasting on the party's
apparent resurgence. It has been running a banner at the top of its
front page proclaiming: ``The Revolution Continues ... Not one step
back!''
   Stronger and more defiant than at any time since losing the Feb.
25 elections, the Sandinistas have been exhibiting their superb
knack for organization.
   Neighborhood parties complete with clowns, musical groups and
speeches have preceded Thursday's big bash by the Sandinistas, the
only organized public event marking the 1979 fall of the Somoza
family dictatorship.
   ``It's not their holiday,'' said Zoila Lara, an anti-Sandinista
domestic worker. ``If everybody hadn't helped them (in 1979), they
wouldn't have done anything.''
   The new government has limited itself to declaring July 19 a
national holiday commemorating ``the Nicaraguan people's triumph
over the Somoza dictatorship, an undeniable fact of the unity of
all social, political and economic sectors of Nicaragua.''
   The Sandinistas quickly consolidated their power after the
revolution ousted dictator Anastasio Somoza and held onto it until
voters rejected them for a conservative, pro-U.S. coalition.
   The Sandinistas have waged a campaign of labor unrest since the
April 25 inauguration of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro that
has forced her to make broad concessions.
   The last strike stopped just shy of civil war between Sandinista
sympathizers and government supporters. It ended when the
government agreed to negotiate even before Sandinista-manned
barricades reminiscent of the 1979 revolution had come down in
Managua, the capital.
   The 10-day Sandinista-led strike was settled with an agreement
that grants hefty wage hikes to government employees, pledges no
mass firings of public sector workers and puts some key elements of
the new adminstration's plan to return Nicaragua to a free-market
economy on hold.
   The Sandinistas hailed the settlement as a victory. Mrs.
Chamorro said it had prevented bloodshed and unrest. The business
community and some leaders of the governing coalition said it had
set back the new administration's economic recovery program.
   A week after the strike's end, work crews were still replacing
paving stones uprooted for the barricades and traffic was jammed at
key intersections.
   The Sandinista celebration will be held at what the leftist
party still calls the Plaza of the Revolution despite the fact that
Mrs. Chamorro's government has changed its name to the
pre-revolutionary Plaza of the Republic.

   On the flip of a coin, paralegal Rosemary
Mulligan was declared the winner Wednesday in her bid to unseat
anti-abortionist Penny Pullen for the Republican nomination in a
suburban state House district.
   Pullen's attorney said he will appeal a court ruling that led to
the coin toss. The ruling said the candidates had received an equal
number of votes in the March 20 primary.
   ``I don't think the coin toss is a biggie,'' Pullen said. ``It
just determines who's going to take the appeal to court.''
   Mulligan's attorney had said she would appeal the ruling if she
lost the flip.
   The primary contest gave voters a clear choice on abortion.
   Pullen, a leader of anti-abortion forces in the General
Assembly, has represented the wealthy northwest suburban district
for seven terms.
   Mulligan, who supports abortion rights, said polls of voters in
the district indicate 70 percent support her stand on the issue.
   ``I think this reflects what's going to happen across the
country eventually,'' she said, after the ``tails'' landing of the
Eisenhower silver dollar gave her victory.
   Michael Lavelle, Pullen's attorney, said he plans to go before
the Illinois Supreme Court on Thursday to ask the justices to take
the appeal directly.
   Circuit Judge Francis Barth had ruled the race a tie on Monday,
giving Pullen and Mulligan 7,387 votes each. The count immediately
after the election gave Mulligan the victory, 7,431 to 7,400.
   Both candidates claim Barth was mistaken in his ruling on which
contested ballots should be counted.
   ``I feel we won on election night by 31 votes,'' Mulligan said,
adding she's confident of ultimate victory in court and in the
November election against Democrat Robert R. Mucci.
   ``Our margin will widen as it goes through court,'' said Burton
Odelson, her attorney.

<HEAD>Study: Abortion Issue Matters But May Not Be Deciding Factor for
Voters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abortion was an important issue in the 1989
New Jersey and Virginia governor's races, but people did not
necessarily base their votes on that issue, according to an
academic study released Wednesday.
   The Eagleton Institute of Politics, a unit of Rutgers University
in New Brunswick, N.J., based its conclusions on an analysis of the
1989 gubernatorial and legislative races in those two states.
   The gubernatorial races were won by pro-choice Democrats James
Florio in New Jersey and Douglas Wilder in Virginia. They ran in
the first statewide races after the Supreme Court's Webster
decision gave states more authority to restrict abortions.
   The study said one out of five New Jersey voters and two out of
five Virginia voters mentioned abortion as particularly important
to them in the governor's race.
   ``Voters say abortion is an important issue, but that doesn't
guarantee that they will base their votes on it,'' said Ruth B.
Mandel, a professor at the institute and one of the study's
authors. ``Someone has to make them see how pulling the lever for a
particular candidate can affect abortion policy.''
   The authors said there was a greater level of interest and
awareness among Virginia voters on the abortion debate than among
New Jersey voters. They attributed that to Wilder's greater use of
the abortion issue in campaign advertising.
   The study said that in both states, more voters identified
themselves as ``pro-choice'' than as ``pro-life.''
   The polling found that 54 percent of New Jersey respondents gave
consistent pro-choice answers supporting abortion rights while 24
percent gave consistent pro-life answers opposing abortion. The
survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
   In Virginia, the comparable pro-choice figure was 44 percent,
and the pro-life figure was 30 percent.
   The study was based on pre-election telephone polling of 4,400
registered voters, and post-election interviews with candidates and
abortion activists in the two states.

   Typical summer weather prevailed Wednesday, with plenty of heat
and humidity to go around. As the Northeast baked in its first heat
wave, Texans began to look for higher ground.
   Rainshowers and thunderstorms remained over parts of Texas.
Storms brought locally heavy rains to areas that have been soaked
with recent rainfall and brought a threat of more flooding.
Flooding closed many roads in Edwards, Real and Kerr counties.
   On Wednesday afternoon, showers and thunderstorms extended from
Texas and Oklahoma, east through Louisiana, and Arkansas and from
the Florida peninsula north to Vermont.
   A cold front produced showers and storms extending from Michigan
across the midwest and plains states to Colorado. Southwest Oregon
and northern California also received a summer dose of rain.
   Heavier rainfalls included 2.07 at Houghton Lake, Mich., and
1.18 at Galveston, Texas.
   Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 41 at Cut Bank, Mont.
   Temperatures in the Lower 48 states at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56
at Arcata, Calif. to 106 at both Palm Springs and Thermal, Calif.

<HEAD>France Probes Police Sale of Arms to Criminal Gangs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France ordered an investigation Wednesday following
charges that French police were part of an arms smuggling operation
that brought in weapons from Lebanon as diplomatic mail and sold
them to local criminals.
   Interior Minister Pierre Joxe directed that security be
investigated at French diplomatic missions in a widening probe of
arms-trafficking by police serving as embassy guards in Beirut, the
Lebanese capital.
   Investigators meanwhile rounded up more police officers and
civilians suspected of smuggling arms from Lebanon since 1986.
Lebanon, a former French mandate, has been embroiled in civil war
for more than 15 years.
   Police officials disclosed few details about the probe, which
was revealed to the public Tuesday.
   Newspapers quoted various sources as suggesting the smuggling
operation could have involved dozens of police officers assigned as
embassy guards in Lebanon.
   Investigators believe the ring made millions by purchasing
handguns, assault rifles and grenade launchers from Lebananese
militiamen.
   The arms reportedly were resold to French criminals, including a
gang that specialized in armored car robberies. One holdup with
assault rifles left two security guards dead in Marseille in March.
   The Parisian daily Liberation said at least one U.S.-made
Stinger missile may have been among the consignments. The
shoulder-fired weapon can down low-flying aircraft.
   Two officers wanted for questioning presently serve at the
French Embassy in Washington, said a police source, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   A third is a police brigadier at the Beirut embassy. Two
officers already charged with arms trafficking identified him as
the ring's main organizer.
   The brigadier was expected to arrive in Marseille this week to
appear before Judge Patrick Ardit. His identity was not disclosed,
nor were those of some others said to be involved.
   On Wednesday, several police from a 90-member unit recently
returned from Lebanon were taken into custody and their homes
searched. An unregistered handgun was found.
   In Bandol on the French Riviera, five people _ including three
municipal employees _ were arrested. Three were released after
handguns they apparently purchased from the ring were confiscated.
   A police search at the villa of an officer in Etiolles, south of
Paris, turned up three rocket launchers, handguns and much
ammunition. Police said the rocket launchers were of a type used in
attacks on armored cars.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse said the home
belonged to the brigadier.
   In Mulhouse, investigators seized 15 assault rifles,
machine-pistols and handguns in dawn raids. The parents, brother
and two colleagues of riot policemen Patrick Schaller were taken
into custody for questioning. His mother was released later.
   Police found 200,000 francs ($36,230) and 18 weapons believed to
originate in Beirut at Schaller's house Tuesday, including assault
rifles and machine-pistols.
   Ardit charged Schaller and fellow officer Pierre Bessonat with
criminal conspiracy and arms-trafficking Tuesday.
   Former riot officer Philippe Nino, who is serving a prison
sentence for heading a car-theft ring, said the two belonged to the
ring. Nino has also been charged with arms-trafficking.
   Nino and Schaller served as embassy guards in Beirut. The
mission's security team normally comprises 100 to 150 men, serving
tours of duty ranging from three months to three years.
   Nino said the weapons were purchased from militiamen or dealers,
then shipped via Cyprus to France in moving crates belonging to
embassy security staff. The crates, classified as diplomatic mail,
were not searched by customs. Hundreds of weapons are believed to
have entered France this way.
   According to investigators, a U.S-made M-16 rifle bought for
$360 in Beirut could bring eight times that amount in the French
underworld.

   Guerrilla leaders said Wednesday the
U.S. decision to withdraw its recognition of the Cambodian rebels
will force the guerrillas closer to China and strengthen the Khmer
Rouge.
   Vietnam's ambassador to the United Nations hailed the decision
as a ``positive'' step that could eventually lead to the
normalization of relations with the United States.
   Vietnam supports the Cambodian government in its war against the
tripartite resistance coalition dominated by the Communist Khmer
Rouge.
   ``In the future, to survive, to go on fighting, we will have to
accept more aid from China,'' Prince Norodom Ranariddh, son of
resistance coalition leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk said. Ranariddh
is also commander of his father's non-Communist army, which is
allied with the Khmer Rouge.
   He said if the United States suspends the $7 million in aid it
gives the non-Communist guerrillas, China would give the guerrillas
twice that amount in compensation.
   ``I don't like any blackmail but I want to let you know that
China had let us know that they are ready to replace the United
States,'' he said.
   ``It is up to you. Do you want to push us closer to China? The
Khmer Rouge don't depend on (the United States). They depend on
China,'' he said.
   Wednesday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III announced in
Paris that the United States was withdrawing recognition of the
guerrillas in an effort to isolate the Khmer Rouge. He also said
the United States would open a dialogue with Vietnam.
   The change was prompted by fears of a resurgence of the Khmer
Rouge, which is the strongest faction in the tripartite rebel
coalition and has after 11 years of civil war scored a string of
recent battlefield victories.
   The Khmer Rouge was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians during a four-year reign of terror that
ended with Vietnam's 1978 invasion.
   Cambodian Prime Minister Son Sann, leader of the third guerrilla
faction said Wednesday in Paris he hoped the resistance coalition
could hold an emergency meeting as soon as possible in Bangkok or
Paris to discuss the U.S. shift.
   He said the United States was ``playing the game of Hanoi.''
   Vietnam's U.N. Ambassador in New York, Trinh Xuan Lang hailed
the U.S. decision saying it ``represents progress in U.S.-Cambodia
policy. This decision is late but positive.''
   ``The danger of the return of (Khmer Rouge leader) Pol Pot is
real and imminent, and therefore we welcome all efforts aimed at
preventing the return of Pol Pot to power,'' the Vietnamese
ambassador said.
   Vietnam has long demanded the United States drop diplomatic
recognition of the guerrilla coalition.
   China, the main supporter of the Khmer Rouge, had no immediate
response to the U.S. announcement.
   The six-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which has
supported the coalition, will formulate a common response at its
meeting next week in Indonesia, Thai government spokesman Suvit
Yodmanee told The Associated Press in Bangkok.
   ``We will consult with our ASEAN partners and reappraise our
position in the light of the development,'' he said.
   ASEAN also includes Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines
and Singapore.

   The prosecution concluded its drug and perjury
case against Mayor Marion Barry on Wednesday, and the judge quickly
rejected most of the defense's motions for acquittal of the 14
charges.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said he would
rule Thursday on whether to acquit the mayor on three misdemeanor
cocaine possession charges _ including the one arising from an FBI
sting operation at a local hotel _ and a misdemeanor cocaine
conspiracy charge.
   Barry's attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, argued that witnesses who
testified concerning those charges could not confirm the dates on
which the government alleged crimes took place. Prosecutors said
the witnesses estimated closely enough.
   In concluding a case in which they portrayed Barry as a city
leader distracted constantly by illegal involvement with drugs,
prosecutors questioned a city police detective who has spent months
compiling records of Barry's telephone logs.
   The detective, James Pawlik, testified that more than 2,000
calls were placed from Marion Barry's car phone over a four-year
span to homes or businesses of friends who have admitted or been
accused of drug involvement with Barry.
   The list covered calls, beginning in early 1986, to 10 people
who have testified _ or been accused in other witnesses' testimony
_ of supplying drugs to Barry, using drugs with him and seeing him
use them, District of Columbia Detective James Pawlik said.
   His testimony came as prosecutors neared an end to their
month-long case in which they have portrayed the mayor as a regular
drug user who lied to cover up illegal narcotics activity. R.
Kenneth Mundy, Barry's attorney, has promised ``lots of surprises''
from the dozen defense witnesses he plans to call.
   On cross-examination, Mundy attempted to put the calls into
context by getting Pawlik to testify that Barry made at least
20,000 car telephone calls during the period for which the records
were examined.
   Pawlik also testified that the records do not make clear that it
was Barry who actually placed the calls, or, in cases when calls
were placed to a business, whether Barry was speaking to witnesses
who have testified against him.
   The detective said the records did not include local calls made
from Barry's home. And there were also four months in 1986 for
which the telephone company could not produce records for Barry's
car telephone, the detective testified.
   Pawlik told the court that Barry made 358 calls to former model
Rasheeda Moore, 573 to former girlfriend Theresa Southerland, and
508 to another woman, Bettye Smith.
   Moore, who cooperated with the Jan. 18 FBI sting operation that
led to Barry's arrest, has testified that she used drugs with him
over 100 times.
   Southerland has testified that she used drugs repeatedly with
Barry, and Smith, who described the mayor as ``a close personal
friend,'' made similar statements in court Tuesday.
   The telephone records also show that Barry made 243 calls to
restaurateur Hassan Mohammadi and 148 calls to local attorney Lloyd
Moore. Mohammadi has testified that he and Barry used cocaine,
marijuana and opium together, and Moore also outlined a history of
cocaine use with Barry.
   Pawlik also said Barry had made several calls to the Washington
hotel room of Charles Lewis in December 1988. Lewis, now a
convicted drug dealer, testified that he and the mayor smoked crack
cocaine repeatedly during that month.
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor counts of
cocaine possession, one misdemeanor charge of conspiracy, and three
felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug use.
   The judge, responding to a defense request that all the charges
be dismissed, refused in regard to the three perjury charges and
eight of the possession charges. He said he would deliberate on
charges involving the testimony of Bettye Smith and Doris Crenshaw.
The judge also reserved judgment on Mundy's request that the
possession charge resulting from the sting operation be dropped
because of what the defense called illegal entrapment.
   Mundy argued that charges stemming from Crenshaw and Smith's
allegations about using drugs with the mayor should be dismissed
because neither could remember the precise dates that the
government listed in its indictment.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Roberts argued that each
provided enough details to satisfy the legal requirements of the
``on or about'' reference included with each date listed in the
indictment.
   Mundy reviewed his argument that Barry was entrapped the night
he was arrested at the Vista Hotel, but Roberts insisted that
testimony in the case revealed Barry had a predisposition to use
drugs before he was arrested.
   Robert Mance, another of Barry's attorneys, argued that the
mayor should be acquitted on the conspiracy charge, saying the
government failed to prove that the mayor headed a single
conspiracy. Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin argued that
Barry ``was the only one who had contact with every government
witness.''

   The Justice Department said Wednesday it was
changing the system for granting asylum to foreigners who fear
persecution in their native lands.
   ``The regulations ... will ensure that those who seek the
protection of this country encounter a fair and sensitive legal
process,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in announcing the
reform.
   Asylum requests currently are handled at Immigration and
Naturalization Service district offices by examiners who handle
many kinds of immigration and visa applications. Under the reform,
which will be effective Oct. 1, asylum requests will be handled by
specialists in Washington.
   The INS will designate between 70 and 90 examiners who will be
trained in international law and in conditions existing around the
world so they may better decide upon asylum requests, Commissioner
Gene McNary said at a news conference.
   He said the INS also would open a documentation center that will
have updated reports on conditions in various countries for
examiners to use as reference.
   Supporters of the reform say that by having its own
documentation center, the INS will rely less on the State
Department and thus may increase the number of asylum requests it
approves.
   ``The State Department has infused the asylum process with
foreign policy considerations, and the INS has been unable to rise
above its law enforcement ethos in order to examine the claims
fairly,'' said Arthur C. Helton, head of the refugee project of the
Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy called the announcement
``a significant step toward fairer and more generous rules of
asylum for those seeking refuge from persecution in their own
lands.''
   McNary said the number of asylum requests had increased from
19,000 in 1986 to a projected 65,000 for 1990. Of those requests,
28 percent are approved on the average every year, he said.
   About 85 percent of those seeking asylum in the United States
are from Latin America. Most of the remainder are from Asia and
Ireland.
   Foreigners seeking asylum in the United States must be able to
prove that, if they are returned to their homeland, they are likely
to face persecution based on their political views, their race or
religion.
   McNary said the INS did not know if the new system would
increase or lower the approval rate. ``It will be a more accurate
adjudication,'' he said.
   The system will cost between $7 million and $9 million a year
and will be paid for mostly from fees the INS collects on various
applications.

<TEXT>
   Iran's parliament speaker lashed out at
the U.S. Congress Wednesday, saying its threats were ``not worth
even an iota to us'' after 162 representatives sent a letter of
support to Iranian rebels.
   The letter called Tehran's hierarchy a ``medieval dictatorship''
and expressed support for the Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy
Warriors, based in Iraq. It was signed by 100 Democratic and 62
Republican representatives and was sent Tuesday to Mujahedeen
leader Massoud Rajavi.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency and Tehran Radio
quoted speaker Mahdi Karrubi as telling parliament, ``It is not
known how foolishly members of the U.S. Congress think or how far
they are from realities.
   ``The threat of the U.S. Congress is not worth even an iota to
us and the United States and its Congress cannot do a damn thing.''
   In their letter, the U.S. lawmakers said ``decisiveness is
required to confront Tehran's medieval dictatorship.''
   They asked Rajavi ``to assure your countrymen that we support
their peaceful and democratic aims'' of replacing the government.
   Karrubi referred to the Mujahedeen guerrillas as a terrorist
group.
   IRNA and the radio, both monitored in Nicosia, quoted him as
saying that ``when the United States and its Congress speak highly
... on that day we must shed tears.''
   Also Wednesday, parliament approved a bill that calls for the
death sentence for ``economic saboteurs.'' The measure was passed
in an effort to control burgeoning bureaucratic corruption.
   Teheran radio said the legislation will empower courts to order
the execution of defendants convicted of ``grand'' frauds, and to
impose prison terms ranging from five to 20 years for minor
offenses.
   The bill still must be approved by the 13-member Council of
Guardians, a parliamentary watchdog committee which screens
legislation to determine whether it conforms to Islamic teachings
and the constitution.

<TEXT>
   A national Hispanic organization initiated a
two-year campaign Wednesday to ensure that the 500th anniversary
celebration of America includes contributions of Hispanics.
   The National Hispanic Quincentennial Commission Inc. announced
its ``Five Centuries of Pride'' campaign to research Hispanic
contributions throughout the past decades and to educate Americans
about those achievements with advertising campaigns, conferences
and books.
   The group also plans to establish regional offices in states
with large Hispanic populations to organize local quincentennial
events.
   ``We want to make people aware of the contributions,'' said
actor Ricardo Montalban, who is of Mexican descent and is the
commission's honorary chairman. ``The contributions speak for
themselves.''
   Commission officials said Hispanic contributions are
``overlooked'' by almost all institutions in this country, despite
achievements dating back to the Spanish explorers.
   ``In our schools, we don't learn about our history,'' said
Elaine Coronado, the commission's executive director. ``We also
need to learn about contemporary contributors.''
   Commission Chairman Raul Yzaguirre said Hispanic youths aren't
proud of their heritage because they see only negative stereotypes
of Latinos.
   ``I'm interested because I see kids getting into drugs, failing
in school, feeling alienated without hope, without a goal,'' he
said. ``Our youth, as generations before, acts this way in part
because they don't have very positive self-concepts.''
   Yzaguirre also is president of the National Council of La Raza,
a Washington-based civil rights organization.
   Several Hispanic leaders said the 1992 quincentennial is an
important way to educate ``all Americans'' of Hispanic
contributions to the development of the United States. They created
the commission in 1982.

   An unusual Plains earthquake rattled dishes and
shook houses but caused no damage or injuries, state officials said.
   The earthquake, centered near Ord in central Nebraska, struck
about 9:47 p.m. Tuesday and measured 3.0 on the Richter scale, said
Ray Burchett, a research geologist of the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln conservation and survey division.
   Residents reported rattling dishes and vibrating furniture in
the communities of Burwell, Sargent, Ord, North Loup, Comstock,
Elyria and Arcadia.
   Burchett said 51 earthquakes large enough to be felt by people
have been recorded in Nebraska history.
   ``There's also been 91 baby earthquakes that have been measured
by instrumentation,'' he said.
   Tuesday's quake was the first felt in Nebraska since Feb. 8,
1989, when a temblor measuring 3.5 was felt in Cherry County,
Burchett said. An earthquake measuring 5.3 on the Richter scale
struck in 1964 in the northwest county.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, and 5 considerable
damage.

   FBI Director William Sessions said Wednesday he is
``strongly optimistic'' that the terrorists who blew up Pan Am
Flight 103 more than 1{ years ago will be caught.
   British and U.S. officials have said they believe Palestinian
terrorists planted the bomb on the airliner, but do not have enough
evidence to prosecute anyone.
   In his remarks to senior police and business leaders at London's
historic Guildhall, Sessions spoke of the ``abominable crime'' of
terrorism.
   The bomb aboard the Pan Am airliner exploded over Lockerbie,
Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing all 259 people on the Boeing
747 and 11 on the ground.
   ``I continue to be strongly optimistic that this horrendous
crime will be solved and those responsible brought to justice,''
Sessions said Wednesday.
   He said the level of international cooperation involved in the
investigation was ``unprecedented.''
   Sessions warned that international criminals could benefit from
Western Europe's dropping internal borders in 1992 to make way for
a single European market.
   ``We must somehow learn to contend with new computer
technologies that allow criminals in one country to steal data or
launder millions of dollars from another country and transfer the
funds to third countries on the push of a computer key,'' Sessions
said in delivering the 1990 Police Foundation Lecture.

<TEXT>
   The Voice of America station in Liberia has
been swamped by about 11,000 refugees fleeing the country's tribal
war, a VOA official said Wednesday.
   The facility in Careysburg, about 20 miles from the capital
Monrovia, is now behind rebel lines but continues to relay U.S.
government programs to Africa, said VOA Deputy Director Robert
Coonrod.
   The station has been run by 100 Liberians since the last of the
American staff was evacuated four weeks ago, Coonrod said.
   ``They're doing a remarkable job, keeping it going under
incredible circumstances,'' he said.
   The station relays 20 hours of VOA programs each day to various
African countries in Swahili, Portuguese, French and English.
   Fighting broke out in recent weeks around the station between
forces of Charles Taylor, a former government official seeking to
topple President Samuel Doe, and renegades who broke away from
Taylor's army.
   Taylor has been sending refugees to the VOA facility because he
considers it a neutral site and because the station has its own
water sources that the refugees are using, Coonrod said.
   The refugees are camping on the grounds of the station, located
on a 2,000-acre jungle clearing.
   The insurgency began in December and has escalated into a tribal
conflict. Most rebels come from the Gio and Mano tribes, while
government supporters are mostly Krahns and Mandingos. Doe is a
Krahn.
   Rebels accuse Doe of corruption and rights abuses. Doe took
power in a violent 1980 coup that ousted the incumbents,
descendants of American immigrants who historically monopolized
power and discriminated against indigenous Liberians.
   Liberia was founded in the 19th century by freed slaves from the
United States.

   The firing of two top Southern Baptist
newsmen had some editors fumbling to meet their deadlines Wednesday
and wondering about the future of Baptist journalism.
   ``This is kind of like the day after the funeral,'' said Don
Kirkland, associate editor of South Carolina's Baptist Courier, one
of 38 state Baptist weeklies.
   ``They move a lot of stories ... stories that we need, and we
assume they will continue to move those as we have,'' Kirkland said.
   The denomination's fundamentalist-dominated executive committee
fired Alvin Shackleford, 58, and Dan Martin, 51 on Tuesday during a
closed meeting attended by 61 committee members. The newsmen
weren't allowed inside, nor were about 200 supporters who packed
the halls outside the doors guarded by off-duty police officers.
   Shackleford, 58, worked at Baptist Press for 3{ years. Martin,
51, had worked there for nearly a decade. They were accused of
producing a news report biased against fundamentalists, who control
the 14.9 million-member denomination.
   The two were given a week to clean out their offices at the
44-year-old news agency, which sends stories and press releases to
about 400 clients, including 38 independent weekly newspapers.
   Monday's news report was the latest one that went out, and
editors were left pondering the future of Baptist Press, which has
bureaus in Richmond, Va., Dallas, Atlanta and Washington, D.C.
   Kirkland, who said his Greenville, S.C.-based paper has a
circulation of 124,000, had doubts about who might replace the
journalists.
   ``Personally, you have to have some question as to what kind of
journalist would walk into a situation like that, after they just
fired two reputable journalists,'' Kirkland said.
   Nashville attorney Jeffrey Mobley has announced formation of a
new, independent press agency, Associated Baptist Press Inc. He
pledged Wednesday the new agency would be independent.
   Mobley said he did not know if Shackleford and Martin would be
asked to join.
   ``We're going to hire the best Baptist journalists we can find.
There has been no decision yet as to who those persons will be,''
he said.
   The election of the Rev. Morris Chapman, of Wichita Falls,
Texas, as president at last month's Southern Baptist convention
consolidated fundamentalist control of the nation's largest
Protestant church body and led to a renewed purge of moderates.
   The ouster of Martin and Shackleford spurred moderates to call a
meeting in Atlanta next month to plan a financial strategy to route
funds away from fundamentalist causes, the Rev. Jimmy Allen of Fort
Worth, Texas said Wednesday.
   Allen said Shackleford and Martin were conscientious journalists
who kept their politics out of the news report. Their firings
``were a tragic thing,'' he said.
   ``The firings show an arrogance of power that says, `We will
control the flow of information,'' said Allen, who heads the
moderate-backed group Baptists Committed to the Southern Baptist
Convention.

<TEXT>
   The son of a former military ally of Manuel Noriega
was brought to the United States and pleaded innocent Wednesday to
drug smuggling charges.
   Amet Paredes, son of retired Gen. Ruben Dario Paredes, arrived
Tuesday in Miami after surrendering to Drug Enforcement
Administration officials in Panama, said his attorney, Joel
Rosenthal.
   Gen. Paredes was the commander of the Panamanian National Guard
from 1982 to 1983, with Noriega as his intelligence chief. Noriega
gradually gained power and in 1984 was able to oust Paredes.
   In 1987, Gen. Paredes gave interviews in which he charged that
Noriega was involved in corruption, drug smuggling and political
assassination. According to the February 1988 indictment of his
son, Amet Paredes at that time was using Noriega's protection to
smuggle drugs into the United States.
   Rosenthal said Amet Paredes, in his late 20s, had been living at
home until he surrendered. Asked why U.S. authorities had not
arrested Paredes in the seven months since the U.S. invasion of
Panama, Rosenthal said ``ask the DEA.''
   The DEA refused comment, but published reports in March said
federal authorities have been negotiating with Gen. Paredes to gain
his help in shoring up the case against Noriega.
   U.S. Attorney's spokeswoman Diane Cossin was asked about the
delay in arresting Paredes and responded: ``That's a good question,
but I have no comment.''
   Rosenthal acknowledged reports of negotiations with Gen.
Paredes, but said there was no plea bargain.
   ``There is no deal, there is no arrangement, there is no
understanding,'' Rosenthal said. ``He will be treated as any other
prisoner.''
   In a quick hearing Wednesday afternoon before U.S. Magistrate
Peter Palermo, Paredes pleaded innocent to the drug indictment and
was ordered released on $200,000 bond to be put up by relatives in
Miami. He also must observe an 8 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew and wear an
electronic monitoring bracelet.
   Amet is the seventh defendant arrested in the Noriega case.
   Noriega surrendered Jan. 4 to the U.S. invasion force and is
being held on charges of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to turn Panama into a way station
for U.S.-bound cocaine.
   Paredes' two children already are in Miami, Rosenthal told the
magistrate, and his pregnant wife, Monica, is on her way here.
   According to the 1988 indictment, Amet Paredes, using his
connections with Noriega and another man, Cesar Rodriguez, smuggled
cocaine from Panama to the United States and arranged protection
for other drug trafficking activities. If convicted on all counts,
he faces 95 years in prison and $1,025,000 in fines.
   When Gen. Omar Torrijos, the charismatic Panamanian leader, was
killed in 1981, Noriega and Paredes made a deal to share power,
with Paredes scheduled to become president in 1984. But Noriega
reneged by withholding the military's support.
   Amet's brother, Ruben Dario Paredes Jimenez, was killed with
Rodriguez outside Medellin, Colombia, in 1986. The two men were
trying to make arrangements with the cartel to acquire a load of
cocaine, the government says. Gen. Paredes blamed Noriega for his
son's death.

   A New York toymaker on Wednesday recalled
7,600 ``Bead Coaster'' toys because the wooden beads may become
detached and pose a fatal choking hazard to young children.
   The three metal blue, yellow and red wires of the toys form a
hill and valley roller-coaster shaped vertical field attached to a
wooden base to create what a spokeswoman for the Consumer Product
Safety Commission called ``an activity toy.''
   Wooden beads of various shapes and colors are threaded through
and move easily about the wires. It is these beads that may become
detached and pose a potentially fatal choking hazard, said the
commission.
   The toy was imported from Taiwan by Associated Merchandising
Corp. of New York and sold nationwide from September 1989 to March
1990 under the trade name ``Creative Years,'' which appears on the
wooden base.
   Neither the commission nor the company are aware of any injuries
associated with the toy but consumers are advised to take it away
from children immediately and return to the store where purchased
for a refund.

<HEAD>EPA Says Diesel Fumes Probably Cause Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Tuesday it plans to classify diesel exhaust as a probable cause of
lung cancer in humans.
   The cancer-causing power of the exhaust was estimated to be
slightly less than what the EPA has calculated in the past.
   The agency has long acted on the assumption that diesel exhaust
causes cancer. It has published estimates that somewhere between
178 and 860 lung cancers in 1986 were the result of exposure to
diesel exhaust, a medical burden that it expected to be roughly
halved by 1995 (92 to 443 cancers) as stricter vehicle exhaust
standards took effect.
   The EPA opened a two-day workshop at its laboratories in
Research Triangle Park, N.C., on a new assessment of the health
risks of diesel exhaust reviewing the latest scientific studies.
   Comments from the workshop will be used to revise the assessment
for presentation to outside scientific advisers before formal
adoption as agency policy.
   Diesel exhaust contains hundreds of compounds, many of them as
fine coatings of tiny soot particles and many of them known causes
of cancer.
   ``It is clear that diesel exhaust is carcinogenic in animals,''
the new assessment said. ``This contention is suported by positive
results in numerous, independent studies, in males and females of
at least two species, and by several routes of administration
including inhalation, intratracheal administration, skin painting
and subcutaneous injection.''
   The review of recent work on human exposure by miners, railroad
workers, truckers, equipment operators and others concluded that
excess lung cancer was seen in nine out of 18 studies, but ``due to
the lack of actual data on exposure to diesel exhaust in these
studies and other mehtodological limitations ... the evidence of
carcinogenicity in humans is considered to be limited.''
   Americans probably were exposed to 302,000 tons of diesel
exhaust in 1986, a figure expected to fall to 138,000 to 170,000
tons in 1995, the EPA said. The average exposure was estimated at
2.6 micrograms per cubic meter of air in 1986, probably falling to
1.2 to 1.6 micrograms in 1995.
   For every million people exposed to 1 microgram over a lifetime,
20 to 100 would get lung cancer that they wouldn't otherwise get,
and the number extra cancers would rise with exhaust concentration,
the agency said in 1987.
   The new assessment presented several new estimates, both higher
and lower, but said the best is that 13 of every million exposed to
one microgram would get lung cancer that otherwise wouldn't occur.
   About 130,000 people die from lung cancer every year, most of it
caused by smoking.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Confirms Stay Blocking Florida Executions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday
refused to lift a stay that could block Florida executions for
months while the courts consider arguments that the electric chair
is in torturously poor condition.
   The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, which issued the
stay, postponed another execution scheduled for Thursday, and its
statement indicated it would bar executions in Florida until the
issue of the chair's functioning is settled.
   Flames and smoke erupted from under the headpiece worn by Jesse
Tafero when he was electrocuted in the 66-year-old electric chair
May 4. Witnesses said Tafero didn't stop moving and breathing until
after the third jolt of electricity.
   Defense attorneys argue their clients face the same fate, which
they characterize as cruel and unusual punishment, barred by the
Eighth Amendment.
   In late June, the appeals court stayed the execution of
spouse-killer Judi Buenoano. On Monday it postponed the execution
of James Hamblen, and said both stays were based on the same issue:
``whether the execution machinery of Florida is operating
properly.''
   On Wednesday, the court called off Thursday's execution of Jerry
White, saying: ``We believe it is likely that this court will grant
stays in cases involving death by electrocution in Florida until
Buenoano is decided by us.'' The Florida attorney general's office
appealed Monday's order to the nation's high court Wednesday, but
the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously refused to lift the stay.
   Carolyn Snurkowski, the state's lead attorney in death
sentences, said the Hamblen stay makes it doubtful any execution
will take place in Florida until the court makes a decision.
   Larry Spalding, head of the state office of attorneys that
represent indigent death row inmates, agreed. But he noted that
death appeals are decided by three-judge panels of the 11th Circuit
that rotate, and that one panel might rule differently.
   The next test would come in appeals for Anthony Bertolotti,
scheduled to die next week for a fatal stabbing.
   Defense attorneys say a broken electrode lowered the voltage
during Tafero's execution from a swiftly fatal level of 2,400 volts
to a torturous level as low as 90 or 100 volts.
   The state Department of Corrections and Gov. Bob Martinez have
maintained that Tafero, who killed two policemen, died instantly
and that a synthetic sponge under Tafero's headpiece was what
smoked and flamed. The sponge has since been replaced with a
natural sponge used in previous executions.
   ``There's no malfunctioning of the electric chair,'' Martinez
said Tuesday during a re-election campaign stop in St. Petersburg.
``And once we get someone to sit there again, I guess will be the
best test of it.''
   White, 42, was the fifth condemned murderer in the last month to
get a stay within hours of execution. He was condemned for shooting
shopper James Melson in the back of the head during a grocery store
in Taft in March 1981.
   Twenty-two men have been executed in Florida since the state
resumed capital punishment in 1979.

   Shirley Richter appealed to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein on Wednesday for clemency for her husband, who is serving a
life sentence in Iraq.
   Businessman Ian Richter worked for a water treatment company
before he was arrested in Iraq and accused of using commissions for
bribery. Richter, now 44, was sentenced in 1986.
   His wife said she was happy for the family of British hospital
administrator Daphne Parish, 53, who returned to London on
Wednesday after Saddam released her from her 15-year prison
sentence.
   ``Naturally I was absolutely delighted that she was released,
but my thoughts naturally were also with Ian who is now entering
his fifth year in imprisonment and I'm just hoping that a similar
gesture will be made by the Iraqi government to now release Ian,''
Mrs. Richter told Independent Television News.
   In her first interview since Richter was sentenced, she said,
``Until Ian was sentenced he always felt that this was a terrible
mistake and that he would be released so it was a terrible shock to
him to realize that in fact he was facing a life sentence.''
   The Foreign Office said Wednesday it had appealed to Iraq for
clemency in the case.
   Saddam released Mrs. Parish after pleas from Zambian President
Kenneth Kaunda. She had served four months of the jail term imposed
last March for helping Farzad Bazoft, 31, an Iranian-born
journalist for a London newspaper, The Observer, who was convicted
of spying and executed by Iraq.
   She was arrested last September after driving Bazoft to a
military installation where he was trying to check out reports of
an explosion.
   The Observer said Bazoft was simply an enthusiastic reporter
after a story.

   After 16 years in political no man's
land, Richard Nixon returned to his birthplace Wednesday to prepare
for the formal opening of his library.
   Nixon and his wife, Pat, arrived at the $21 million library at
mid-afternoon for his first look at the exhibits and at the
restored home where he was born in 1913.
   He was applauded by a handful of tourists. Mrs. Nixon, who
seldom appears in public, was handed a bouquet of flowers by some
Girl Scouts who had planted a rose garden on the library grounds.
   Nixon met with some former members of his administration.
   ``I've never been concerned about his place in history,'' said
Bruce Whelihan, who had worked in the Nixon White House press
office.
   Ken Khathigian, who wrote speeches both for Nixon and Ronald
Reagan as president, was asked whether he ever expected such an
edifice to be built honoring Nixon.
   ``I always knew it would happen, that it was just a matter of
time,'' Khathigian said.
   Nixon originally planned to have his library in San Clemente but
the project got bogged down. Khathigian said the opening ``was in
keeping with the boss' career _ perseverance.''
   Nixon began his memoirs by saying, ``I was born in the house my
father built.''
   The formal opening Thursday, to be attended by the three
Republicans who followed him into the presidency, is another step
back toward public life for Nixon, who resigned in 1974 when his
Watergate burdens engulfed him.
   ``If anything, the opening of the library and the birthplace
will draw more attention to Watergate because that is what most of
those who are covering the event for the media are most interested
in,'' Nixon told the Los Angeles Times.
   ``Over time, as their interest fades, and if the public
continues to visit the museum, I would think that all the events
covered will be seen in a more objective perspective,'' Nixon said
in a written response to the newspaper's questions.
   The exhibits span a public career of nearly a half century,
beginning in 1946 when Nixon ran successfully for Congress from
this Orange County district, through two years in the Senate, eight
years as vice president and 5{ years as president.
   They touch on Watergate, the scandal that began in 1972 with the
burglary by White House agents of Democratic Party headquarters in
Washington's Watergate office building and led to a cover-up of
White House involvement.
   Nixon, who was named an unindicted co-conspirator, resigned Aug.
9, 1974, when it became apparent he could not avoid impeachment by
the House and conviction by the Senate.
   Nixon shares with Franklin D. Roosevelt the record of being five
times on the national ticket. That counts Roosevelt's unsuccessful
try for vice president in 1920 and Nixon's failed attempt to beat
John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election.
   President Bush was flying in to attend Thursday's ceremony.
Former Presidents Reagan and Ford also planned to make speeches.
The only other living president, Democrat Jimmy Carter, said he
couldn't make it.
   H.R. Haldeman, who was fired as chief of staff when Watergate
heated up, is expected to be a guest. Library officials did not
release a list, but it was made clear John Dean, the former Nixon
counsel who revealed the Watergate scandal to prosecutors, was not
on it.
   Among presidents dating back to Herbert Hoover, Nixon is the
only one who has not had a museum to house the artifacts of his
career or the papers of his presidency. Reagan's, 50 miles away in
Simi Valley, is scheduled to be opened next February.
   Unlike the others, however, Nixon's will get no federal funds,
by choice of the former president. He is also the only one among
them to eschew Secret Service protection, saying the cost to the
taxpayer is too high.
   Nixon contributed $2 million to the library and has pledged the
proceeds from the sale of his eighth and latest book, ``In the
Arena.''
   For the foreseeable future, the library will have no
presidential documents, and when it does acquire them, they will
only be copies. Congress seized the 42 million pages generated by
the Nixon presidency, looking for Watergate evidence, and they
remain in a nondescript National Archives warehouse in Alexandria,
Va.
   Nixon assistant John Taylor said the library may join with the
Archives in putting 1.5 million pages of the so-called White House
Special Files on digital discs. Those files, which are available to
scholars in Alexandria, contain the most sensitive information,
including much on Watergate. But they were heavily censored when
thousands of pages were removed at Nixon's request.
   When ordinary people are admitted to the library Friday, at a
cost of $3.95 for adults, they will see a sizable Watergate exhibit
that includes an audio presentation of the most famous White House
tapes.
   They also will see one of the most telling photographs
associated with the end of the Nixon presidency, his defiant wave
good-bye from the steps of the helicopter that carried him out of
the White House and the highest office in the land.
   Pat Nixon, the former president's wife of 50 years, is expected
to make a rare public appearance at the ceremony. So will the Nixon
daughters, Julie Eisenhower and Tricia Cox with their husbands, and
the Nixons' four grandchildren.

   The Senate prepared to vote on a major civil
rights bill Wednesday after the Bush administration and Democratic
sponsors failed to agree on a plan to fight job discrimination
without leading to hiring quotas.
   The failure of last-minute talks brought warnings that the
measure was doomed to a veto if it reached the president's desk in
its current form.
   ``We are now proceeding on the road to a certain veto,'' Sen.
John C. Danforth, R-Mo., said. ``This is a bill that can do a lot
of good for a lot of people and it is going nowhere.''
   Senators said the hangup in the negotiations was one that had
plagued the two sides for weeks _ how to define ``business
necessity,'' crucial words in court cases concerning job
discrimination.
   ``Every combination of words has been tried,'' Danforth said
glumly. Hours earlier, he had served as a messenger in taking
Bush's last offer from the White House to the Senate.
   The behind-the-scenes negotiating involved the bill at the top
of civil rights groups' agenda for the year. The measure would
overturn five Supreme Court rulings.
   Provisions of the bill range from a ban on racial harassment in
the workplace to punitive damages for victims of intentional
discrimination.
   Most of the controversy, however, has surrounded a provision
making it easier to challenge employment practices whose effects
fall disproportionately on minority groups.
   The Supreme Court's decision in a case involving hiring at a
salmon cannery in Alaska held that such practices do not violate
the law unless those filing suit can show they were not motivated
by business necessity.
   The bill, sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., would
require the companies to prove that the practices involved did
represent business necessity.
   The Bush administration and other critics of the Kennedy measure
say it would guarantee that businesses would turn to minority
hiring quotas to avoid the costs of civil rights lawsuits.

<HEAD>Suit by Wife's Heir Is Lies, Armand Hammer Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrialist Armand Hammer said Wednesday a
$700 million lawsuit that seeks his prized art collection was full
of lies, generated by the greed of his late wife's sole heir.
   Hammer, the 92-year-old chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp.,
responded in an interview to the lawsuit filed in state court by
Joan Weiss, the niece of his late wife Frances. Through a
spokesman, he had refused to comment when the suit was filed last
week.
   The suit says Hammer's fortune, and that of Occidental, was
built on money provided by Frances, his third wife. It contends he
tricked her into signing away her rights to property amassed during
33 years of marriage.
   But Hammer said that waivers dating back to 1974 and tax returns
from even farther back will clearly show a court his wife intended
to give up her joint property rights under California law.
   ``This complaint is full of falsehoods, it's completely untrue
and I'm sure that if and when the case reaches court we'll be able
to prove to the satisfaction of the court that this is all
contrived,'' Hammer said in the interview at Occidental's
headquarters in Westwood.
   ``My attorney tells me that when lawyers find the documents are
against them, they claim fraud,'' he said. ``It's the only way they
can re-open the case, otherwise there would be summary judgment.''
   ``Obviously we disagree with all that,'' said Richard D. Cleary,
the lawyer who filed the suit for Joan Weiss. ``We plan and expect
to prove otherwise in court.''
   He declined further comment.
   Frances Hammer died in December, leaving her $15 million estate
to Joan Weiss. Weiss' husband, Robert Weiss, was named executor and
brought the suit.
   In addition to the $700 million in damages it asks for
unspecified punitive damages. It also seeks, among other things, to
have Mrs. Weiss awarded at least half the art collection, which has
been estimated to be worth $250 million to $400 million.
   Hammer and his lawyer, Jay Goldberg, said the Weisses already
had showed their greed by selling Mrs. Hammer's jewelry collection
at auction and would do the same if they got part of the art
collection.
   Goldberg said in a telephone interview from New York that
documents and witnesses ``will show that for a period of 33 years
this woman proceeded on a basic philosophy that she was
relinquishing any share of property attributable to Armand Hammer's
efforts.''
   He said Mrs. Hammer clearly and repeatedly acknowledged that
donations to Hammer's foundation, with which the art was purchased,
were from him, not from her or from them jointly.
   ``She not only said this to countless people but she executed a
number of documents going back to 1974 reflecting this, and in each
and every one of the tax returns filed from 1968 on she evidenced
(the same) by her signature,'' Goldberg said.
   The suit seeks $400 million in damages from Hammer and the law
firm that advised him and his wife on tax matters. It asks for $300
million from his foundation, the museum he is building to house his
art, and Occidental.
   By challenging his sole ownership of the art, it further clouds
the future of his museum, being built beside Occidental's Los
Angeles headquarters and due to open this November.
   Suits already filed by shareholders, challenging the museum,
contend that Occidental is squandering $100 million in company
money to fund a project designed for Hammer's glory.
   Occidental President Ray Irani defended the contributions as a
legitimate corporate expense, contending Hammer's world-famous
collection of art helps promote the company by association with it.
The money spent on the museum is a small fraction of Occidental's
annual cash flow of $1.8 billion, he said.
   Mrs. Weiss' suit says Frances Hammer was a multimillionaire
widow and Armand Hammer was nearly broke when the couple married in
1956. It says Hammer used his wife's fortune to build Occidental
into an oil giant and amass a huge personal fortune.
   Hammer borrowed funds at 2 percent for speculative ventures and
often failed to make interest payments to her, its says. When he
did repay her, it was with money that was their joint property, it
contends.

<TEXT>
   Farm bills being debated in Congress will
drive more family farmers from the land, country music star Willie
Nelson said Wednesday.
   Nelson, organizer of four large benefit concerts called Farm
Aid, said 400,000 family farmers quit the business since the last
farm bill in 1985.
   ``We're not giving our family farmers enough to make a living,''
Nelson said at a news conference before going to Capitol Hill to
lobby for changes in the bill.
   The Senate may take up its version of the farm bill Thursday.
Debate in the House is likely next week.
   Nelson and Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream,
joined several farm groups in criticizing the bill.
   ``Farmers don't want handouts or subsidies,'' Cohen said. ``They
want a fair price for their products and a rational production
policy.''
   Ben &amp; Jerry's has started carrying the Farm Aid logo on its ice
cream cartons to increase support for family farmers, Cohen said.
The company is trying to ``protect the livelihood of our suppliers
and the health of our consumers,'' he said.
   ``Family farmers are independent, small businessmen working the
soil with respect for the land and neighbors,'' Cohen said.
   David Senter, national director for the American Agriculture
Movement, said farmers will be squeezed by the farm bills' freeze
on target prices, higher excise taxes and little assistance for
rural development, health care, research and education.
   He criticized Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter's threat to
urge a veto of the bill because of its high cost.
   Yeutter on Tuesday said the five-year cost of the new bill would
be $59 billion, compared with the Senate Agriculture Committee's
estimate of $55 billion _ and that's too much, he said.
   ``Apparently they (the administration) think it's too good,''
Senter said. ``I guess they want to get rid of us quicker.''
   Much of the nation's farm program amounts to manipulation of
supplies to raise prices, such as limits on imports and planting
restrictions. EConomists say such measures represent costs to
society just as direct subsidies do.
   Farm Aid, the Cambridge, Mass. group that administers funds
raised by Nelson's benefit concerts, has distributed $9 million
since 1985 to more than 100 farm organizations, churches and
service agencies in 41 states, the singer said.
   He said the concerts have failed to keep farmers from leaving
the land, but said they have drawn attention to the problem and
raised some relief money.
   ``As far as saving farms, only this farm bill can do that,''
Nelson said. ``It would be nice if didn't need another Farm Aid. It
would be nice if the people in this city who can help solve this
problem would do that.''
   Nelson, 57, has testified previously before congressional
committees on behalf of small farmers.

<HEAD>Labor Department Examining Possible Leak Of Unemployment Figure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department is looking into the
possibility that its June unemployment report was leaked to traders
in financial markets by a news service, an agency spokesman said on
Wednesday.
   The matter involves a monthly report released July 6 on
unemployment in June, the government's first comprehensive look at
economic activity for that month, said Bob Zachariasiewicz.
   Zachariasiewicz said the department's action was not a formal
investigation. It is merely studying a report that the information
had been leaked early and caused a fluctuation in market activity.
   ``We had no way of telling that the market fluctuation was
caused by a premature release of the information,'' Zachariasiewicz
said.
   Just before the figure's release, one trader on the Chicago
Board of Trade began selling bond futures heavily, according to a
report Wednesday by Dow Jones. The selling spree could have been
the result of a lucky guess or could indicate a premature leak, the
service said.
   When the report is released each month, news organizations are
given copies at 8 a.m. on the condition that they not be released
until 8:30 a.m. Markets can rise or fall based on this information,
and its release even a minute prematurely has drawn the
department's ire in the past.
   Zachariasiewicz declined to say which news organization was
being reviewed but another Labor Department source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said it was a Japanese service.
   The department last week cautioned Japanese news organizations
in advance of the release of its report on producer prices, the
source said.
   ``We've been having some trouble with the Japanese,'' the source
said, without elaboration.

<TEXT>
   Johnny Wayne, one of the kings of comedy of
Canadian radio and television as half of the Wayne and Shuster
team, died Wednesday of cancer. He was 72.
   Wayne and Frank Shuster had a long career as Canada's best-known
cut-ups, starting with a Boy Scout fundraising show they did on
radio in 1930 and a touring army act during World War II on TV and
in London and New York.
   A CBC spokesman who announced the death said the funeral was
scheduled for Friday in Toronto.
   In 1950, Wayne and Shuster began appearing as guests on various
American TV programs, including 67 performances on The Ed Sullivan
Show.
   Although their wideranging skits _ an amiable mixture of
slapstick, pantomime, sheer corn and sometimes ingenious twists on
classic situations _ did not always win critical acclaim, they
remained popular.
   While they were regulars on The Ed Sullivan Show in New York,
they always remained Toronto-based, resisting invitations to move
to New York or Los Angeles.
   Shuster, 73, lamented the loss, saying Wednesday night, ``I
really can't believe he's gone. ... I was with Johnny two days
ago.''
   An early break came during their college days when Canadian
songwriter Ruth Lowe recommended them to a talent agency as
potential professional funnymen.
   ``Actually,'' Wayne said later. ``we don't know why she was
enthusiastic. She wrote `I'll Never Smile Again' after catching our
act.''
   Of their experiences entertaining wartime troops, Wayne said:
``We had the distinction of being the only military unit in World
War II that was fired on deliberately by all sides.''
   Leonard Starmer, executive producers of the Wayne and Shuster
CBC-TV show since 1970, said Wednesday that to know Wayne ``was to
be challenged by his sense of humor and his general being _ I've
lost a real friend.
   ``It's been very difficult for Frank. Both of us feel drained.''
   He said Wayne died of cancer that developed in April. Starmer
was working with Wayne and Shuster on a new show looking at the
first 50 years of the comic partnership. Starmer said the show will
be completed as planned.
   Born May 28, 1918, John Louis Wayne, one of seven children of a
Toronto clothing manufacturer, teamed with Shuster at Toronto's
Harbord Collegiate where they wrote, sang and acted in an annual
revue.
   They continued their partnership at University of Toronto and
developed a radio program called Wife Preservers that dispensed
household hints with humor. At university, Claude Bissell, then an
English lecturer and later the university's president, said to
Wayne: ``What I like about you is you don't let studies interfere
with your education.''
   What did interfere with their early career was the war and both
enlisted in the army. But soon after, impresario Jack Arthur
arranged to have the two transferred to Montreal where they became
headliners in the weekly Canadian Army Radio Show.
   Their success led to a Canadian tour and later to Britain,
France, Belgium and Holland. Their group was said to be the first
to entertain troops in Normandy after D-day.
   ``This was a toughening-up process,'' said Wayne. ``If the men
could survive us, they could survive anything.''
   By 1947 Wayne and Shuster had a regular CBC show with a live
audience. Ed Gould, in his book Entertaining Canadians, says the
pair threatened to quit if they had to play to canned laughter.
   After numerous guest appearances on American TV, the pair was
offered control of their U.S. programming if they would move south.
   ``Why should we leave all this to live on airplanes?'' Wayne
replied from his comfortable home in Toronto's Forest Hill district.
   They started their regular CBC-TV program in 1954, building an
array of characters such as the Brown Pumpernickel, Professor
Waynegartner and Tex Rorschach. In 1985, Wayne and Shuster Comedy
Specials began playing on television in 22 countries, dubbed in
French, German, Spanish and Italian.
   Wayne is survived by three sons. His wife, Bea, died in 1982.

   Two Lutheran congregations were suspended
Wednesday for ordaining homosexuals.
   But the punished churches said the ruling was fair because the
church disciplinary committee postponed an even worse penalty _
explusion _ for five years while the denomination wrestles with the
issue of homosexuality.
   Both officials of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and
members of the two churches said the ruling recognized a continuing
debate about whether gay men and lesbians should have to take a vow
of celibacy to be officially ordained.
   ``The discipline imposed is severe,'' said a report by a
disciplinary committee that ordered the suspensions. ``At the same
time, the committee's decision affords a much needed opportunity
for study, dialogue, reconciliation, and progress toward a more
unified understanding.''
   Under the ruling of the 12-member disciplinary board, the St.
Francis Lutheran Church and First Lutheran Church won't be expelled
until Dec. 31, 1995, and then only if church policy has not changed.
   But the two San Francisco congregations won't be permitted to
send official delegates to regional church meetings and cannot vote
on official church policies until reinstated.
   Ruth Frost, one of three homosexual pastors whose unauthorized
ordination led to a three-day church trial on the issue, said the
decision was a defeat for gay men and lesbians.
   ``The positive aspect of this is that the dialogue will
continue,'' Frost told a news conference. ``It is not (a victory)
from the perspective of gay and lesbian people because we have
waited too long for recognition in the church.''
   Kathy Kelly, co-chairwoman of the disciplinary board, was among
four panel members who issued a minority report objecting to the
expulsion of the congregations on principle.
   ``Even if we are unwilling to embrace diversity on this question
of conduct as a permanent part of our church's life, we should at
least be prepared to accept such differences,'' the minority report
said.
   Bishop Lyle Miller, who called for the investigation that led to
the suspension, said the issue deserved more study before the two
congregations are kicked out of the Lutheran church.
   ``The complicated issues surrounding sexuality, homosexuality
and ministry cannot be resolved by a discipline committee,'' said
Miller. The Chicago-based denomination has started a study of
church homosexuality that could lead to new rules, he said.
   The disputed policy prohibits sex outside marriage. Since
homosexuals aren't allowed to marry in the Lutheran church, the
Evangelical church will only ordain homosexuals who take a vow of
celibacy.
   Frost, 42, and her lover, Phyllis Zillhart, 32, have both
refused to make such a promise. St. Francis ordained the pair on
Jan. 20 without official permission and in violation of
congressional rules.
   Jeff Johnson, a homosexual who is assistant pastor at First
United, was ordained during the unauthorized ceremony and has
refused to take a vow of celibacy. Johnson and Zillhart were both
in Chicago on Wednesday and unavailable for comment.
   The pastors of the two suspended churches both vowed to try and
change the rules during the next five years so they aren't expelled.
   ``We don't want to leave the church. We love the church,'' The
Rev. James DeLange of St. Francis said.
   ``We are heartened by part of this decision,'' added the Rev.
John Frykman of First United.
   The Evangelical Lutheran Church, with 5.3 million members, is
the largest Lutheran group n the United States.

<HEAD>Japanese Official Denies Sexism in His Carla Hills Remark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Politician Koko Sato said on Wednesday he was
complimenting U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and not
dismissing her when he referred to her as ``a woman after all'' at
last week's Houston economic summit.
   Sato, deputy secretary-general of Japan's governing Liberal
Democratic Party, said he was trying to combat what he said was the
prevalent image here of the U.S. trade representative as being
tough, cold and even scary.
   Japanese newspapers and wire services quoted Sato this week as
describing Hills as ``a woman after all'' in his remarks on a
two-hour conversation with her at Houston.
   ``I was just saying that when (we) switched from talking about
business to talking about (our) families, she would suddenly become
a housewife and mother,'' he told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview.
   ``That's why I said it. When I said woman, I meant a family
person.
   ``Many seem to be afraid of Hills, but if you talk to her, you
realize she is a wise, fine person.''
   Sato, 61, also bridled at being quoted in newspapers as having
said the 56-year-old Hills was ``charming and cute'' as well as
``getting on a bit in age.''
   He said he had, in fact, complimented the U.S. trade
representative for seeming quite young despite being a grandmother.
He was merely repeating her own response to the compliment, Sato
said.
   Sato, a nine-term legislator from the northern island of
Hokkaido, holds an influential position in the governing party. He
made a political comeback after being given a suspended sentence in
Japan's Lockheed bribery scandal in the 1970s.

   Former Beatle Paul McCartney said Wednesday he
never planned to get caught up in a beef over meat-eating during
his first concert in Iowa.
   ``We haven't come out on this tour to preach against meat,''
McCartney said at a news conference before the concert. ``We're
pro-corn, very pro-corn.''
   The concert created a stir throughout pork and beef country,
along with a massive traffic jam in this central Iowa city of
45,600. Organizers expected the concert Wednesday night to draw
55,000.
   But an animal rights group's ``Meat Stinks'' campaign attracted
most of the attention.
   McCartney and his wife, Linda, a keyboard player in his band,
are vegetarians. No meat or fish is served to the 180 people
traveling with McCartney.
   ``This whole tour is vegetarian,'' Linda McCartney said.
   The Maryland-based People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
planned to have an informational booth at the concert and to offer
tofu ``not dogs'' as an alternative to the meat-based hot dogs.
   Country singer k.d. lang's ``Meat Stinks'' television ads taped
for the organization led to a ban of her music from some Midwest
radio stations last month. Paul and Linda McCartney came to lang's
aid and have taped a message for the animal rights group's hotline.
   Iowa is the nation's leading pork producing state and ranks
fourth in the cattle being fattened for market.
   Before the concert, McCartney was more interested in talking
about environmental issues and his work with Friends of the Earth
than about meat. The environmental group hopes to win allies among
Iowa farmers for a campaign to protect groundwater quality.
   Iowa cattlemen said Tuesday they were urging their supporters to
concentrate on extolling the benefits of eating beef.
   ``The Iowa Cattlemen's Association does not endorse any type of
protest or demonstration at the McCartney concert and will not be
participating in any such activities,'' Marshall King of Boone, the
association's president, said in a statement.
   ``We urge all livestock producers and agriculture groups to
channel their energy instead to working together to provide the
public with accurate information about our industry,'' King said.
   The Iowa Pork Producers Association said it will not try to
counter the animal-rights group's efforts at the concert.
   ``The reason they are doing that is clearly to provoke some
reaction from livestock producers,'' said Andy Baumert, a pork
producers staff member. ``That would serve their purpose more than
ours. We are not going to participate in that.''
   Linda McCartney has written a vegetarian cookbook called ``Linda
McCartney's Home Cooking,'' already out in England and to be issued
Oct. 31 in this country by Arcade Publishing.
   She said she and her family became vegetarians one Sunday 20
years ago when they looked out their kitchen window as they ate
lunch and saw their sheep in the field.
   ``If animals could speak, I think they'd tell us not to eat
meat,'' Linda McCartney said in an earlier interview. ``We are such
a pompous race of humans. We're so destructive, so sad. People
dream of heaven and, you know, we're living in heaven, but we make
it hell.''

   Vice President Dan Quayle on Wednesday
strongly defended President Bush's son Neil, who is under fire for
his role in the demise of a Colorado savings and loan.
   ``The only reason that he is taking a few lumps and the only
reason that he is being scrutinized the way he is, is because he's
the president's son,'' Quayle said during a visit to Texas to stump
for GOP candidates.
   ``I know Neil Bush. He's a man of integrity. He's hard working.
He's got a bright future, and I think it's most unfortunate that he
has to go through this ordeal,'' Quayle said.
   Neil Bush, one of President Bush's four sons, is a former
director of Denver-based Silverado Savings &amp; Loan, seized be
federal regulators in December 1988. Its failure is expected to
cost taxpayers more than $1 billion.
   David Beckwith, Quayle's press secretary, said the vice
president had taken up the younger Bush's defense while others in
the administration skirted the issue because ``he feels strongly
about it.''
   Speaking during a stop in San Antonio, Beckwith said Quayle had
planned to talk about Neil Bush even if reporters had not asked him.
   Thrift regulators say Bush violated conflict-of-interest rules
by accepting a loan from a businessman who later received a
$900,000 line of credit from Silverado. Bush has denied wrongdoing
and will appear at an administrative hearing in September to defend
himself.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said this week he had no
indication Neil Bush broke laws in his handling of the bank.
Congressional Democrats are seeking an independent counsel to
investigate Silverado.
   Neil Bush has become a symbol in the burgeoning S&amp;L crisis,
expected to cost taxpayers $500 billion.
   Earlier in the day, in Raleigh, N.C., Quayle campaigned for Sen.
Jesse Helms and spoke to North Carolina tobacco farmers, telling
them that with growing health advice against smoking in the United
States, they should think about exports.
   Quayle defended Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan, who has attacked smoking and tobacco advertising.
   ``Secretary Sullivan comes at it from the health aspect. He
feels as a physician himself, he should speak out,'' Quayle said.
``He's got reports that indicate quite strongly that smoking is
injurious to one's health.''

   A Cuban delegation headed by the son of
President Fidel Castro on Wednesday signed three agreements to
cooperate on peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
   ``I think there will be a type of collaboration and cooperation
that will benefit both countries,'' said Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart,
speaking at a news conference in Mexico's capital.
   He said the accord showed that Cuba is not as isolated as
critics of its hard-line Communist government have alleged since
the democratic changes in Eastern Europe and the election defeat of
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistas.
   The younger Castro, Cuba's executive secretary for nuclear
affairs, said the agreements would promote cooperation in areas
ranging from nuclear power to medicine and industry. But no
specific projects were mentioned.
   Each country has a single nuclear power plant. Mexico's troubled
Laguna Verde plant along the Gulf of Mexico uses U.S. technology,
while Cuba's nuclear plant in Cienfuegos, about 180 miles southeast
of Havana, uses Soviet designs.
   In response to questions, Castro said Cuba planned to expand its
use of nuclear technology throughout its economy, and intended to
build more nuclear power plants.
   He noted that Cuba has virtually no oil or coal. ``Practically,
we don't have options'' to nuclear power, he said.
   Critics say Mexico's Laguna Verde plant uses outdated and
dangerous technology, and a U.S. plant based on similar technology
has been closed.
   Soviet designs such as those used in Cuba have come under
increasing criticism both within the Soviet Union and in Eastern
Europe, especially following the Soviet Chernobyl nuclear plant
disaster in 1986.

   Dr. Karl Menninger, the dominant figure in
American psychiatry for six decades and a major influence in prison
and mental health reform nationally, died Wednesday of cancer. He
would have been 97 on Sunday.
   Menninger, who argued that insane people could be treated, died
at Stormont-Vail Regional Medical Center, said Judy Craig,
spokeswoman for Menninger, the psychiatric center he helped found
in 1925. He was admitted to the hospital June 12 and diagnosed with
abdominal cancer two weeks later.
   Funeral plans were incomplete, but services were expected to be
here on Saturday.
   Menninger was one of the first psychiatrists to integrate
psychoanalytic theory into their practice, said Dr. Elissa Benedek,
president of the American Psychiatric Association of Washington,
D.C.
   ``He wrote and spoke the language of the average American,
making mental illnesses more understandable and less feared,'' she
said.
   Dr. Gertrude Ticho, a member of the American Psychoanalytical
Association, also said from Washington, ``His greatest contribution
was the pioneering of psychoanalytical principles and thoughts.''
   A nephew, Dr. Walter Menninger, said, ``He consistently conveyed
a message of hope for the mentally ill.''
   ``He was curious about everything imaginable and unimaginable on
this planet,'' said a close friend, Andrew J. Gray of Topeka.
   Menninger was once hailed by the American Psychiatric
Association as the nation's ``greatest living psychiatrist.'' A
forceful, outspoken maverick, he jolted popular thought with his
theories on crime, prisons and child abuse.
   He was credited with convincing the American public that mental
disorders could be treated and cured. And he wrote ``The Crime of
Punishment'' in 1968 to argue that ``you don't rehabilitate a man
by beating him.''
   The Menninger Clinic, which he founded with his father in
Topeka, is one of the world's most famous hospitals for the
mentally ill. He co-founded the Menninger Foundation, a non-profit
organization for training, research and public education in
psychiatry and psychology. Its name was shortened to just Menninger
in 1989.
   Norman Cousins, a longtime friend of Menninger who has written
on health for the layman, explained the psychiatrist's choice of
the midwest rather than a more stylish big city.
   ``I think in going out to Topeka, he was able to demonstrate the
fact that ideas can come out of the heartland and not just the
periphery,'' Cousins said in an interview from Los Angeles. ``He
inspired me in that respect. When we edited the Saturday Review, we
saw as the intellectual center as the Midwest, rather than either
coast.''
   Cousins said Menninger explained that mental and physical health
problems are inseparable and must be treated that way.
   ``He showed the aim of the wise physician is to help the patient
achieve a `vital balance'... that what could go wrong in the mind
could affect the body and what could go wrong in the body could
affect the mind.''
   Menninger received the nation's highest civilian honor, the
Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1981. The inscription read, in
part: ``With the wisdom of his years, he truly does represent the
ideas of another generation _ the future, rather than the past.''
   In recent years, he still went to his office daily, meeting with
students, having lunch with friends, receiving guests and sometimes
fretting about his place in history.
   He took no credit for attaining age milestones: ``I thank God I
lived as long as I did. It's more his doing than mine. And I had
good parents, you know.''
   Karl Augustus Menninger was born July 22, 1893, in Topeka, the
eldest of three sons of Dr. Charles F. Menninger. He considered
newspaper work or banking, then decided to join his father in
medicine and in 1917 graduated with honors from Harvard Medical
School.
   He interned in Kansas City and taught briefly at Tufts Medical
School. In 1919, after the death of Dr. Ernest Southard of Boston
Psychopathic Hospital, ``one of the great inspirations of my
life,'' Menninger joined his father's practice.
   He soon became what was then called a nerve specialist.
Menninger once recalled that he and his father established their
clinic in 1925 because ``I saw you couldn't do psychiatry alone;
you needed others around you.''
   ``My chief purpose in the beginning was to show you could treat
`insane' people. Everybody thought they were untreatable. But I
said they were being treated every day. We demonstrated you could
treat people in a better way.''
   In December 1925, his brother, William, returned from New York
and joined the clinic in a two-story frame home in west Topeka. The
building was designated a national landmark in 1974.
   In 1941, the Menningers set up the Menninger Foundation. Karl
Menninger served as its president from 1941-43, director of its
education department for a time and chief of staff from 1952-1956.
He became chairman of the board of trustees in 1954.
   Menninger was hot-tempered and excitable, and the force of his
personality frequently startled those meeting him for the first
time.
   ``I guess I always have been a bit of a curmudgeon, but I liked
things done right,'' he once said.
   His greatest ambition was to do what he could to help mankind.
   ``I've always believed in amelioration, improving the lot of
man,'' he said.
   By his own admission, he sometimes ``tilted at windmills,''
especially in his criticisms of the nation's prison system. Yet, he
lived to see prison reform becoming reality, much like the changes
that swept through the nation's mental institutions in the 1940s
and 1950s.
   Crime and reform dominated his thinking in later years.
   He moved to Chicago in 1966, serving as a consultant on prison
affairs and helping set up a mental health center in downtown
Chicago. He moved back to Topeka in 1974.
   As he grew older, he turned to painting and studying
American-Indian history for relaxation. He also wrote 14 books,
including ``Sparks,'' ``The Human Mind,'' ``Love Against Hate'' and
``The Vital Balance.''
   In December 1976, he underwent surgery at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., for removal of a brain tumor. It left a portion
of his face paralyzed and his speech slurred. However, he amazed
associates by bringing both back to nearly normal through
biofeedback and exercise.
   Survivors include his second wife, Jeanetta Lyle Menninger, whom
he married in 1941; a son, three daughters and nine grandchildren.
   Funeral services were scheduled Saturday at the First
Presbyterian Church, near the state Capitol, followed by a private
graveside service.

   Fearing victory by the Khmer Rouge, the Bush
administration abruptly announced Wednesday it is ending
recognition of rebels battling the Vietnamese-backed government of
Cambodia and instead opening talks with Vietnam.
   ``We want to do everything we can to prevent a return of the
Khmer Rouge to power,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
in announcing the policy reversal. He said it did not mean the
United States was normalizing relations with Vietnam.
   The Khmer Rouge was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians during a four-year reign of terror that
ended with Vietnam's 1978 invasion. After 11 years of civil war,
the Khmer Rouge controls large sections of northwestern Cambodia.
   ``We had a goal of seeking Vietnamese withdrawal from
Cambodia,'' Baker said in describing the reversal. ``We have
realized that.''
   Vietnam contends it removed the last of its troops from Cambodia
in September.
   A senior administration official said the United States is still
seeking verification of this claim. The official said there are no
Vietnamese combat units in Cambodia, but there may still be as many
as 10,000 Vietnamese military advisers in Cambodia.
   ``Another policy goal was to prevent the return of the Khmer
Rouge to power,'' the secretary of state told reporters. ``We've
not been able to achieve that goal and, in fact, it would appear
that the risks are greater as we move forward that that might, in
fact, occur. So we want to do everything we can to prevent a return
of the Khmer Rouge to power.''
   On Capitol Hill, Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell called
past administration policy ``a dismal failure'' and said further
steps are needed beyond Baker's announcement.
   ``With widespread reports of increasingly effective Khmer Rouge
military actions inside Cambodia, there is simply no excuse to
delay additional action'' such as direct talks with the Cambodian
government, he said.
   Baker's announcement came three weeks after the Senate
Intelligence Committee, according to sources who requested
anonymity, voted in closed session to end a $13 million-a-year
covert military aid program for the resistance coalition.
   The senior administration official, speaking on condition he not
be identified, said the administration will continue to press for
aid to the anti-government forces.
   Baker said the decision to begin discussions with the Hanoi
government ``does not constitute a decision to normalize relations
with Vietnam. It is a decision simply to begin a dialogue with
Vietnam about Cambodia.''
   He called Khmer Rouge control of the country in the mid-1970s
``extraordinarily tragic.'' The rebels had tried under the
leadership of Pol Pot to force the country into a primitive
agrarian commune.
   Baker spoke after meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, whose government supports Vietnam. The two were in
Paris for talks with European leaders on German unification.
   Shevardnadze, standing next to Baker, commented that ``our
approaches on the Cambodian problem in principle have become much
closer.''
   The administration official said the talks with representatives
of the Hanoi government will be held in New York, where Vietnam has
a U.N. mission. He said Ken Quinn, a deputy assistant secretary of
state who deals with Southeast Asia, would represent the United
States.
   Under U.S. pressure, the United Nations has awarded a seat to
the Cambodian resistance coalition and denied formal recognition to
Cambodian Premier Hun Sen.
   Baker, who revealed the policy change in answering a question
about a Los Angeles Times article, said the United States was also
changing its policy toward the Cambodian U.N. seat.
   The senior administration official said that the United States
will no longer support seating a member of the resistance
coalition, as long as it includes the Khmer Rouge, but would not
support awarding the Hun Sen government the seat either.
   ``Our feeling is that the Hun Sen regime is unelected, was
installed by force and doesn't merit seating at the U.N.,'' he said.
   Beijing, the chief backer of the Khmer Rouge, had no immediate
reaction to Baker's announcement.
   Telephone calls to the Beijing resistance of Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, the leader of the rebel coalition, went unanswered.
   Sihanouk's son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, commander of his
father's non-Communist army allied with the Khmer Rouge, said the
U.S. move would force the guerrillas closer to Beijing.
   ``In the future, to survive, to go on fighting, we will have to
accept more aid from China,'' he told reporters in Bangkok.
   The development was welcomed on Capitol Hill.
   ``With the Khmer Rouge at Phnom Penh's gate, the president is
finally reacting,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif. He said Bush
needs to open direct talks with the Hanoi-backed government of Hun
Sen.
   The senior official said the administration is considering ``the
question of talking to the Pnom Penh regime at some appropriate
level, but we want to do so only if it can be done to advance us
toward the goal of free and fair elections in Cambodia. Right now
we do not yet see that opportunity presenting itself.''
   The talks with Vietnam could be the first step toward
normalization of relations 17 years after the United States
withdrew its troops from Indochina and accepted the Communist
victory over U.S.-backed South Vietnam in 1975.
   Baker said the progress of the dialogue over Cambodia, as well
as what Vietnam does about helping locate Americans who may be
missing in action in Southeast Asia, ``will have a lot to do with
whether or not we can move toward normalization.''
   President Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, also said the
dialogue would be confined to Cambodia.
   ``It really doesn't go any further than that,'' the White House
press secretary said. ``We're not considering normalization or any
other moves.''
   In Cambodia, the guerrillas said they retained firm hold over
the strategic town of Stoung in the center of the country. Also,
the Khmer Rouge said in a radio broadcast today its fighters had
launched a five-pronged attack over the weekend on the country's
second-largest city, Battambang, in the northwest.

   Kory Albert was lucky to be alive Tuesday
after his car was hit by two trains as he tried to race across the
railroad tracks.
   The 19-year-old bakery worker's car was struck about 2:25 a.m.
by a westbound coal train and dragged about 365 feet, according to
the Cass County Sheriff's Department.
   He escaped just before another train struck the car from the
opposite direction, dragging it another 500 feet.
   Albert, who was treated for cuts to his head, face and shoulder,
said he drove around a crossing gate.
   ``I'd seen the train coming from the west and I knew I could
beat that train,'' Albert said. ``I looked to the east and I saw
that train ... about a second later I was rolling out of my car.''
   The coal trains were traveling between 50 and 55 mph, police
said.

recommended Wednesday that the full Senate denounce Sen. Dave
Durenberger for his ``unequivocally unethical'' financial conduct.
   The panel proposed he make restitution of up to $124,050 for
exceeding Senate limits on speaking fees and accepting improper
reimbursements.
   The committee's recommendations for punishment of the Minnesota
Republican go to the full Senate. Leaders of both parties said they
would try to schedule action before senators leave for their August
recess.
   The committee said Durenberger should reimburse the Senate
$29,050 plus interest for accepting reimbursements for use of a
condo he partially owned and pay charities $95,000 for exceeding
speaking fee limits in 1985 and 1986. The amount would be lowered
by taxes Durenberger paid on the money.
   The panel's most serious recommendation could have been
expulsion, a penalty usually reserved for serious criminal
violations. But the committee did not find any criminality on
Durenberger's part.
   The committee said Durenberger had ``knowingly and willingly''
violated federal civil law as well as Senate rules and cited as
``reprehensible'' Durenberger's behavior on virtually every
allegation of financial misconduct that was part of the panel's
investigation.
   That behavior ``has brought the Senate into dishonor and
disrepute,'' the committee said. The panel referred its findings,
without making any recommendations, to Senate Republicans, who
could strip Durenberger of any positions of party responsibility.
The findings also will go to federal agencies including the Justice
Department and Federal Election Commission.
   Durenberger said that ``of all the thousands of words that have
been written or spoken during 23 months of investigation, news
coverage and commentary, only three are appropriate today: I am
sorry.''
   He strongly indicated he has no intention of resigning his seat,
commenting, ``I intend to spend the next four years being the best
senator I can.''
   Durenberger added that he accepted the committee's direction to
make restitution ``as a tangible sign of my regret and continuing
commitment to the people of Minnesota.''
   He said his outstanding or unbilled legal fees total $377,000
and he has already paid $211,934 for previous legal costs. The
senator said he has raised $121,337 so far for his legal expenses.
The money was raised from political supporters.
   The committee passed a resolution saying that Durenberger, 55, a
senator since 1978, should be ``denounced by the United States
Senate.''
   Senate historians have said this would amount to a censure, a
punishment that would have no practical effect on Durenberger's
duties. It could, however, seriously damage him in Minnesota, where
his popularity has suffered since the case began a year ago.
   The committee criticized Durenberger's ``clearly and
unequivocally unethical'' conduct in connection with:
   _His arrangement with Piranha Press, in which Durenberger
contended he made speeches to promote two books that he said were
not subject to the Senate's limits on honoraria. The committee
found, however, that these were normal honoraria speeches and were
subject to the limits.
   _The senator's failure to report the receipt of travel expenses
in connection with his book-promotion appearances and dual-purpose
trips to the Boston area. In the later trips, Durenberger made
speeches timed to coincide with trips to his marriage counselor's
office there.
   _Durenberger's real estate dealings involving his Minneapolis
condominium, so he could continue to receive questionable
reimbursements from the Senate for his stays there.
   _His pattern of discussing the condominium with the trustee of
his blind trust.
   _Repeated acceptance of free limousine service in violation of
Senate gift limits.
   _Conversion of a campaign contribution to personal use.
   Committee Chairman Howell Heflin, D-Ala. and Vice Chairman
Warren B. Rudman, R-N.H., said their findings will be referred to
the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission. Rudman,
however, stressed at a news conference there was ``no finding of
criminality anywhere in the report.''
   Rudman told reporters that the panel found a pattern of
misconduct in his book and condominium deals and ``Taken in their
totality, the committee decided unanimously that they merited,
regretfully, this severe punishment.''
   The committee's report should go to the Senate in seven to 10
days.
   The senators said they intentionally did not recommend any
specific action to Republican senators.
   ``That is not a proper matter for the Ethics Committee. That is
a Republican Party matter. They can read. They can look at the
sanction,'' Rudman said.
   In Minnesota, the chairman of the Democrat-Farmer-Labor Party,
Todd Otis, said Durenberger had ``brought a black cloud to
Minnesota politics and should resign,'' or submit himself to the
voters in a special election this year instead of waiting to 1994.
   But Barb Sykora, chairwoman of the Independent-Republican Party,
rejecting any suggestion that the senator should resign, said
Durenberger would ``work very hard to get himself back into'' the
good graces of the voters in the next four years.

   Two teen-age brothers and their friend
drowned when a sudden storm flooded the culvert where they were
playing Wednesday, officials said.
   Flint fire officials said } inches of rain fell in less than 20
minutes as thunderstorms swept across the Michigan's Lower
Peninsula.
   ``We had three teens swimming in Gilkey Creek when the heavy
rains came,'' Battalion Chief John Balser said. ``All the rain
water in the area converges in the one culvert. The water pressure
pinned them against a steel grate.''
   When rescue crews arrived at 6:10 p.m., the boys had been
trapped in the 6-foot diameter tunnel for 20 minutes, Balser said.
   Killed were two brothers, ages 14 and 17, and their 17-year-old
friend.

<TEXT>
   A bankruptcy judge Wednesday tentatively
approved the sale of the remaining assets of Jim Bakker's failed
religious empire to a California evangelist for $45 million.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Thurmond Bishop approved the sale to
Morris Cerullo of San Diego on the condition that two creditors
owed $5.55 million by Bakker's former PTL ministry resolve their
terms by next Tuesday.
   The bankruptcy trustee overseeing PTL's assets said he believes
the sale will go through.
   ``I think it's going to happen,'' trustee Dennis Shedd said.
   Last month, Morris Cerullo World Evangelism Inc. of San Diego
bought PTL's religious cable network for $7 million.
   With the additional $45 million, Cerullo would gain ownership of
Heritage USA, the Fort Mill religious theme park that includes a
500-room hotel, a shopping mall, five restaurants, a $10 million
water park and 1,700 acres of undeveloped land.
   Under the deal, secured creditors will get about $38.68 million
of Cerullo's offer. Some of the remainder will pay for
administrative costs, with what little is left over going to
unsecured creditors.
   The unsecured creditors include the ``lifetime partners'' of
Bakker's ministry, who are owed an estimated $160 million.
Thousands of Jim and Tammy Bakker's fans paid $1,000 each in
exchange for promises of lodging at the theme park. The Bakkers
spent much of that money on houses, jewels, fancy vacations and
other luxuries.
   PTL has been in bankruptcy proceedings since Bakker's
spectacular downfall in 1987 following a sex-and-money scandal
involving former church secretary Jessica Hahn. Bakker is serving a
45-year federal sentence for conspiracy and fraud.
   The sale to Cerullo was applauded by several Bakker followers
who attended the court hearing. One ``lifetime partner'' said she
thought Cerullo was sent by God to take over Heritage USA.
   ``We're going to win souls for Jesus Christ,'' said Edie Stern,
75. ``We will win one billion souls worldwide in the decade of the
'90s. It will be better and bigger than ever.''
   Cerullo, who did not appear in court Wednesday, will have until
Oct. 19 to close the deal, Shedd said. The first step will be
obtaining the agreement of the two holdout creditors, First
Mortgage Investment and the Resolution Trust Corp., the government
agency that takes over the business of failed savings and loans.
   Cerullo spokesman Alan Elias attempted to dispel concerns that
Cerullo would not have the money to finance the deal.
   ``The bankruptcy court and Dennis Shedd would not have gone
forth with the deal if they were not confident about the
financing,'' he said.
   Cerullo plans to repay the loans with a ``major fund-raising
campaign'' that will get under way in September, according to a
statement from his office.
   Secured creditors are those who possess a deed to parts of the
PTL estate as collateral against their investments or loans.
   Last year, Toronto businessman Stephen Mernick failed to close
on a $65 million deal to buy PTL when he failed to title insurance
because of the Catawba Indian Nation's claim to 144,000 acres of
ancestral land that includes the Heritage USA site.
   On Wednesday, another federal judge released some of that land
from the claim, but attorneys were not sure if all was exempt. The
Catawbas said they would appeal the decision.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Takes Stand to Defend Return of Gambling Sheets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   District Attorney Harry Connick testified
Wednesday at his federal racketeering trial that it wasn't illegal
or unusual for him to return seized gambling records to an arrested
bookmaker.
   ``It is my opinion that individuals accused of a crime have a
right to examine those things that can be used against them,'' he
said under questioning from his attorney.
   Connick, 63, is charged with racketeering and knowingly aiding
an illegal gambling organization by returning betting sheets seized
in a December 1988 raid. Connick has long contended that he was
required to return the records under Louisiana rules of criminal
procedure.
   Bookie Walton Aucoin and Aucoin's lawyer, Patrick Fanning, are
among Connick's six co-defendants. Connick said he decided to
return the records at the urging of Aucoin, Fanning and others.
   Connick said Fanning told him Aucoin needed the seized records
to file federal income tax returns.
   Connick said prosecutors routinely, and legally, return seized
items to defendants unless the items are drugs, weapons or other
things that cannot legally be possessed.
   State discovery laws have been changed ovet the past 20 years to
allow easier access, he said.
   Connick said he stuck by his decision to give back copies of the
records despite pressure from Capt. Craig Jennings, head of the New
Orleans Police Department's intelligence division, who wanted them
withheld.
   ``One thing he said, he seemed to insist that returning them
would be aiding and abetting a gambler. I said, `that's not my
interpretation of the law, and I want to give them back,''' Connick
said.
   During cross-examination, James Cole, a prosecutor from the
Justice Department's public integrity section, tried to weaken
Connick's claim that gambling cases were not a high priority for
his office.
   ``You understood that gambling is harmful to the public, didn't
you?'' Cole asked.
   ``I think it can be harmful, yes,'' Connick replied.
   Cole attacked Connick's argument that since other seized items,
such as fishing nets used illegally by fishermen, can be returned
to the accused, the betting records should have been returned as
well.
   ``Nets can be used for legal or illegal fishing, can't they?''
Cole said. ``People can't use bookmaking records to conduct a legal
business, can they?''
   ``Not that I can think of,'' Connick said.
   Connick faces up to 25 years in prison and $250,000 in fines if
convicted of two counts against him. The trial began June 11.
   Connick, the father of jazz musician Harry Connick Jr., has been
district attorney in New Orleans since 1974. He is up for
re-election in October.
   Among the others on trial in U.S. District Court are actor Paul
Burke, a boyhood friend of Connick's who starred in the 1960s
television series ``The Naked City.'' Burke is charged with one
count of racketeering, one count of aiding an illegal gambling
operation and one count of lying to a federal grand jury.

   President Bush returned to the campaign
trail Wednesday to stump for Republican candidates and lash out at
Democrats, although he went out of his way to praise one, House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt.
   Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One, Bush paid
particular tribute to the Missouri Democrat's role as chairman of
congressional budget negotiators.
   Gephardt, with whom Bush in the past has clashed, ``is doing I
think a first class job'' in trying to ``hold this big group
together and lead it. And I think we all owe him a vote of thanks
for the way he's proceeding as chairman of the process,'' the
president said.
   The president had met immediately before the trip began with
congressional leaders, including Gephardt, in an effort to prod
efforts to reach a budget compromise.
   ``Every time we sit down, we get rid of some of the
differences,'' Bush said. However, he said that there is ``a lot of
work still to be done'' and that some major areas of disagreement
remained to be bridged.
   Bush's kind words for Gephardt came as he began what some aides
said would be a high-key political trip to raise funds for GOP
candidates here and in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.
   ``Over the next few days, you'll see an attack dog,'' one aide
said of Bush's three-day trip through four western states.
   One early version of a Bush speech accused Congress of ``making
a mockery of good government'' with its budget process, according
to aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity. However, White
House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that particular phrase
would not be included in the final text.
   The trip is Bush's first campaign excursion since he reversed
his 1988 ``no new taxes pledge'' earlier this month. That, and the
growing savings-and-loan scandal, loomed as major political issues.
   The president planned to heed the recent advice of Republican
strategists to ``take the offensive'' in an effort not to let
Democrats get the upper hand on these issues, White House aides
said.
   ``Everywhere he goes, there will be tough language,''
spokeswoman Alixe Glen said before Bush's midafternoon departure
for California.
   Bush, who took a month off from campaign appearances to attend
summit meetings in London and Houston, headed first to California
with his wife, Barbara.
   The president met late in the day at the Marine Corps Air
Station in El Toro, Calif., with Orange County recipients of his
``point of light'' award. Bush honors an individual or group each
day for exemplifying his ``thousand points of light'' theme of
volunteerism.
   On Thursday, the president was to attend the dedication of the
former President Nixon's library in Yorba Linda and to speak at a
GOP fundraiser in Anaheim.
   Nixon's daughter, Tricia, her husband Edward Cox and their son
travelled with Bush on Air Force One.
   Bush also planned to raise cash for GOP candidates later in the
week in Boise, Idaho; Billings, Mont., and Cheyenne, Wyo. Next
week, he is scheduled to attend fundraising events in Philadelphia
and New York.
   Since becoming president in January 1981, Bush has raised $58.8
million for GOP candidates. A former chairman of the Republican
National Committee, Bush plans to make at least 40 appearances
around the country by election day.
   ``It's the way the man is. He's available to do anything and
everything that makes sense'' to help elect Republicans, said B.
Jay Cooper, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee.

   Indin leaders asked the Canadian government and
the United Nations on Wednesday to begin an inquiry into a Mohawk
land dispute in Quebec that has left a provincial police officer
dead and prompted an anti-Indian backlash.
   Mohawk spokeswoman Ellen Gabriel said Wednesday that Mohawks
want to take their arguments ``relating to sovereignty and land
rights'' to the U.N.'s International Court of Justice in The Hague.
   Flanked by U.S. lawyers William Kunstler and Stanley Cohen,
Gabriel said the Indians also want a moratorium on land development
in the disputed area until a ruling by the court. Kunstler has
defended Indian rights in the United States.
   Indian leader Walter David made the latest appeal for federal
involvement in the confrontation that has taken one life and sorely
tested Quebec provincial officials.
   In his remarks Wednesday, David made an appeal for calm in the
week-old standoff. ``We'll resolve this very soon,'' he said, ``but
the feds have to get out here and get out here soon.''
   For four months, the Mohawks have blocked access to a golf
course in Oka, a town 18 miles west of Montreal. The municipality
had been trying to build an addition to the golf course on land the
Mohawks claim as ancestral territory.
   On July 11, police stormed the Indian barricade. One officer was
killed, but it is unclear if he was killed by Mohawks or fellow
officers. The armed Indians remained there Wednesday.
   Since the shootout, Mohawks at the nearby Kahnawake reservation
have been demonstrating their sympathy by blocking a bridge between
Montreal and its southern suburbs. Related demonstrations have
occurred in British Columbia and New York.
   Local residents have vented their anger at the bridge blockade
with protests and racist slurs. On Tuesday, the residents broke
through police barriers there but stopped when confronted by 100
officers standing shoulder-to-shoulder. No injuries were reported.
   The International Centre for Human Rights in Montreal and the
Canadian Human Rights Commission issued a joint statement Wednesday
condemning such signs of racism as the burning of Mohawks in effigy
at Chateauguay near the Montreal bridge.
   Federal Indian Affairs Minister Tom Siddon defended Ottawa's
record in the Mohawk dispute and said the federal government has
tried several times to purchase land at Oka to set up a reservation.
   He didn't explain what prevented the government from doing so.
   On Tuesday, Yvon Picotte, Quebec minister of municipal affairs,
accused Siddon of being ``blind, deaf and dumb'' in the dispute and
shirking his responsibilities.
   Siddon has monitored the standoff the past week while leaving
negotiations up to Quebec Native Affairs Minister John Ciaccia.
Indian leaders Wednesday were reviewing that provincial official's
undisclosed proposal for an agreement.
   The federal minister had been personally involved in the past.
Last month, he met with Mohawks, Oka municipal politicians and
Ciaccia. At that time, he suggested the government buy the golf
course land for the natives, if it was for sale.
   One of the major stumbling blocks in negotiations has been
Mohawk insistence that those behind Indian barricades be immune
from prosecution.
   At a Quebec City news conference Wednesday, provincial Premier
Robert Bourassa rejected the idea of amnesty for anyone found
guilty of committing a crime at Oka.

   The contractor building a subway tunnel that
collapsed during a devastating blaze near a busy freeway has been
cited six times for serious safety violations, federal officials
said Wednesday.
   Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration
authorities said Tutor-Saliba Corp., the Metro Rail tunnel's prime
contractor, was fined $2,820 for violations discovered during 11
inspections between Jan. 21, 1988 and Sept. 30, 1989.
   Those violations included lack of guards on grinding equipment,
lack of backup alarms on equipment and lack of lifelines and
improper storage and distribution of flammable material, OSHA
spokesman Joe Kirkbride said. The violations involved the Metro
Rail project.
   The federal agency defines a serious violation as one in which
there is probability that death or serious physical harm could
result, and the employer knew or should have known of the hazard.
   ``I don't consider any of those violations serious, but in the
nomenclature of OSSA they are considered serious,'' Tutor-Saliba
President Ron Tutor said Wednesday. ``The safety record of that job
and of our company has been just excellent.''
   No injuries were reported in the Friday fire that gutted 750
feet of unfinished subway tunnel and paralyzed traffic on the busy
Hollywood Freeway, which is part of U.S. 101.
   The fire's cause was still under investigation Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, the county District Attorney's Office announced this
week its criminal probe into the fire will focus on possible safety
violations, including allegations the safety engineer overseeing
tunnel work was unqualified.
   The county Board of Supervisors this week also said it would
consider asking the grand jury to investigate the fire's cause.
   Tunnel repairs have been progressing slowly. Tutor has estimated
that repairs would cost between $500,000 and $1 million and delay
completion of the structure by up to 90 days. The original deadline
was Sept. 16.
   Southern California Rapid Transportation District officials
earlier estimated damage to the $10 million tunnel at $2.5 million
to $5 million.
   The state Department of Transportation opened all but one lane
of the freeway this week.

<DATELINE>BAGUIO, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of people fled
their homes Wednesday after four strong aftershocks shook the
country's north, which is digging out from an earthquake that
killed at least 376 people.
   Officials feared the death toll could rise sharply as isolated
communities report damage from Monday's quake. About 150 workers at
a factory in the northern city of Baguio were missing and may have
been killed in a fire that broke out after the quake.
   Authorities also began plans to evacuate tourists and others
from Baguio, which has a population of about 119,000. Baguio is 110
miles north of Manila.
   Many people bitterly complained that rescue efforts were poorly
organized and ineffective.
   ``People are losing hope, simply because they haven't received
any assistance from the national government,'' said Ronnie del Moro
of the GMA television network, reporting from the town of Agoo in
La Union province.
   In La Union and Tarlac provinces, thousands of people slept in
cars and in their yards because of damage to their homes and fears
of another quake. Huge fissures of up to a half-mile cut highways
throughout the area.
   In the mountain resort of Baguio, where at least 82 people were
killed by Monday's quake, one woman approached visiting military
Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa and complained about the rescue
efforts.
   ``These are all piecemeal measures!'' the unidentified woman
shouted as President Corazon Aquino's spokesman Tomas Gomez tried
to pacify her with promises that help was on the way. ``Why now,
why only now?'' she asked. Gomez gave no answer.
   The aftershocks delayed the search for survivors in several
hard-hit areas.
   Two measured 6.3 and 5.8 on the Richter scale of ground motion,
according to the U.S. Geological Service in Golden, Colo. There
were no precise readings for the other two. Monday's quake measured
7.7, the worst to hit the Philippines since 1976.
   In Baguio, hardest-hit by the earthquake, thousands of people
began fleeing after the aftershocks. They carried their belongings
with them like war refugees.
   Scores of people jammed the airport in hopes of leaving the city
aboard military helicopters that were ferrying supplies from an air
base in a nearby province.
   Thousands remained camped in city parks, many with only
umbrellas for shelter in the frequent thunderstorms.
   ``We will just walk,'' one woman said. ``It's dangerous on the
road because of the landslides. But it would be much safer than
staying indoors. We will be spending the night on the road.''
   At the Hyatt Hotel, which collapsed in the earthquake, Clarita
Gonzales tearfully called out with a megaphone for her 5-year-old
daughter trapped in the rubble with her nanny.
   ``If you are still alive please tap,'' Mrs. Gonzales sobbed.
   In all, eight hotels and 19 other major buildings were destroyed
or heavily damaged in Baguio.
   Rescuers found the body of an official of the U.S. Agency for
International Development in the ruins of the city's Navada Hotel,
but had not yet recovered it Wednesday. The victim, who had been
attending a conference at the hotel, was identified as Richard
Finley, according to Eddie Teal, a fireman from Fairfax, Va. Teal
was one of the Americans sent by the U.S. government to help in the
rescue effort.
   About 1,500 Americans live in Baguio.
   Manila television stations reported that hundreds of thousands
of people in central Luzon island lacked electricity, drinking
water and food and were camped along highways for fear of
aftershocks.
   In Baguio, funeral director Filemon Relis, said his mortuary
received nearly 70 bodies of earthquake victims. Some bodies were
covered with blankets and were lying outside his funeral parlor
because there was no room inside.
   Mrs. Aquino flew to the area Wednesday to inspect the damage.
   She ordered officials to give top priority to clearing roads so
medicine, food and heavy equipment could be brought in. She also
ordered city schools closed for a month.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said a 14-member
military search and rescue team arrived from Andrews Air Force Base
near Washington, D.C., and would travel by helicopter to Baguio to
join the search.
   Health Undersecretary Mario Taguiwalo warned that disease may
soon break out because of fresh water shortages.
   Figures compiled by the Office of Civil Defense and the Red
Cross showed 360 people were killed and 773 injured from the
earthquake.
   In addition, the Philex Mining Corp., reported 16 people were
also killed at its residential compound in Benguet province but
they were not included in the official tallies. The company said 13
of the dead were children.

   A coroner who dropped a dead baby
head-first and used his observations of the result in court
testimony has been sued by the family of the infant.
   Dr. Charles Odom, former deputy coroner for Lafayette Parish,
said Wednesday he dropped the dead 4-month-old girl on a concrete
floor during an autopsy to determine what damage would result. Odom
maintained the experiment was proper.
   The infant's parents, Dwayne and Ellen Arnaud, have sued Odom
for $2 million in damages for emotional suffering they claim they
suffered because of the experiment on their daughter, Christina.
   The infant died Dec. 22, 1986, as a result of Sudden Infant
Death Syndrome. Odom's autopsy was conducted the same day.
   The Arnaud's parents became suspicious when they were preparing
the body for burial and noticed disfiguration. Two months later,
after consulting with lawyers, the parish coroner acknowledged the
child had been intentionally dropped.
   Odom used information from the experiment while testifying later
in a manslaughter trial in Hawaii. As a result of the testimony,
the charge was dismissed.
   ``There are many, many purposes and objectives for autopsies,''
said Odom, who is now working as an assistant medical examiner in
Dallas. One purpose is ``to gain medical knowledge and use that
medical knowledge in the service of the living,'' he said.
   Odom said skin, bone, eyes, heart valves and kidneys are often
removed from bodies and used elsewhere, without the knowledge of
the dead person's family.
   ``All of these tissues are harvested from corpses to help the
living,'' he testified.
   On Tuesday, Jefferson Parish Coroner Robert Treuting testified
that pathologists have the legal right to do anything they want
with the body if they have a legitimate research reason.
   Under questioning from the Arnaud's lawyer, J. Simon Minos,
Treuting said it would be callous for the survivors to be told
specifically about the experiments because it would compound their
anguish.

   Residents voluntarily evacuated part of an Alaskan village
Wednesday because of heavy smoke from a nearby forest fire, and
crews in Montana worked to catch up with a blaze threatening the
view from a scenic highway.
   Forests also burned in Oregon, Idaho and Washington state, but a
15-acre fire in Yellowstone National Park was contained. A fire in
Utah was reduced to hot spots.
   The return of hot, dry weather in eastern Alaska rekindled a
low-grade fire south of the town of Tok, which was threatened
earlier this month, and the blaze quickly spread over more than
2,000 acres, said Steve Waterman, a U.S. Park Service spokesman at
Tok.
   The fire produced smoke so thick that all but about 15 of the 90
residents of Tetlin village, about seven miles away, fled,
officials said.
   The fire was in a roadless region and work must be done by crews
using shovels on the ground or by aircraft dropping chemical fire
retardant, Waterman said.
   The size of the Gird Point fire in southwestern Montana was
recalculated Wednesday at 1,980 acres, 20 percent less than earlier
thought, but some 1,170 firefighters continued to battle the blaze
near Hamilton.
   Firefighters discovered old trench lines in the area that they
hope will help them to control the blaze. They reported gaining
ground late Wednesday.
   But the fire in the Bitterroot National Forest continued to
threaten the vista from the scenic Skalkaho Highway, with some spot
fires burning within 50 feet of the road, said fire information
officer Tim Elridge. Officials had earlier closed the road and
evacuated several campgrounds in the area.
   Fire information officer Bill Rockwell said the hot, dry, windy
weather of recent weeks may be a harbinger of a long fire season in
southwestern Montana.
   ``In another couple of weeks, if we continue with these hot days
and precipitation, we'll be in a similar situation as we were in
'88,'' he said, referring to the summer when hundreds of thousands
of acres burned in Yellowstone and other areas of Montana and
surrounding states.
   Cooperative wind Wednesday helped crews battle two fires in
eastern Oregon that had burned across 1,550 acres.
   Oregon's largest blaze was the 1,200-acre Corral Basin fire 22
miles southwest of John Day. But Malheur National Forest
spokeswoman Heidi Bigler said shifting wind blew the fire back on
itself Tuesday and it grew by only 140 acres as it burned through
steep terrain.
   The Bear fire on the Wallowa Whitman National Forest near
Anthony Lakes ski resort grew by just 50 acres to 350 acres.
Firefighters expected to have it and the Corral Basin fire
contained late Thursday.
   Improved weather in central Idaho let 400 firefighters gain the
upper hand on the 430-acre Mormon Creek Fire just east of the South
Fork of the Salmon River about 17 miles east of Cascade. Officials
said that blaze could be contained as early as Friday evening.
   ``There are low temps, high humidity, and it's overcast,'' Boise
National Forest spokeswoman Sue Peece said. ``They did get a little
bit of precipitation up there so that helped too.''
   About 100 miles to the east in the Challis National Forest,
trees burned out of control along the North Fork of Big Creek some
30 miles east of Challis. Sixteen firefighters moved into the
primitive roadless area and fire bosses were moving an additional
160 more men onto the lines.
   Forest Service spokesman Frank Carroll said the Idaho forests
were as dry now as they were a year ago when fire claimed 200,000
acres in the state.
   ``It's like bread,'' Carroll said. ``You put it in a toaster and
you get toast.''
   In Washington, a fire in the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area, about
60 miles northeast of Seattle in the Wenatchee National Forest,
grew to 550 acres, authorities said.
   In Wyoming, the only fire still burning in Yellowstone was the
15-acre Stonetop fire, north of Yellowstone Lake. The fire, started
by lightning on July 12, was 95 percent contained, according to
park spokeswoman Sandra Robinson.
   In Utah, firefighters remained on the scene of a brush fire in
the foothills of the Oquirrh Mountains in case wind rekindled a
1,500-acre blaze that previously threatened homes in the area.

   A balanced budget constitutional amendment
came within seven votes of passing the House as lawmakers showed
frustration over Congress' inability to strike a deficit-reduction
deal with the White House.
   Meanwhile, President Bush planned another meeting with
congressional leaders this afternoon on the budget talks, which
have shown scant progress. ``The time for game playing is over,''
he said Tuesday.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu, asked about today's
meeting, said: ``The agenda's a very simple one: let's get a
solution to the deficit, get a package to come out of the summit
and move forward.''
   Democrats were sure to deliver the message that they need more
leadership from Bush, especially in selling to the public the
prospect of pocketbook-painful decisions on taxes and program cuts.

   The Senate, jarred by the bitter tone of its
civil rights debate, is mounting a fresh effort to compromise with
the White House on plans to combat discrimination in the workplace.
   ``I think everybody agrees it's worth one last shot, one last
effort,'' Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Tuesday after both
sides agreed to a renewed round of negotiations.
   The Senate voted 62-38 earlier to limit debate on the measure's
provisions to 30 hours. But that brought an angry reaction from
Dole, who said Republicans were being muzzled. The two sides sought
to resolve the problem with a new round of bargaining.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu told reporters that the
sponsors and the administration had struck a deal last Thursday but
``they (the sponsors) reneged on it.''

   The special prosecutor investigating former
Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. is now authorized to probe
consultants and developers who dealt with the scandal-ridden
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Arlin M. Adams, the independent counsel appointed March 1 to
investigate Pierce's administration o the Moderate Rehabilitation
Program, was given the expanded authority Tuesday by a special
court that oversees his work.
   The court issued an order empowering Adams to investigate
Pierce's handling of two other programs from 1984 through 1988 _
Urban Development Action Grants, or UDAG, and the Secretary's
Discretionary Fund for technical assistance and special projects.
   Besides Pierce and other HUD officials, Adams was given
authority to ``fully investigate and prosecute all government
officials, or other persons and entities'' who dealt with those
programs.

   West Virginians can fight the war on
drugs by filling out a coupon under a state police program hailed
as the new wave in citizen crimefighting.
   But civil libertarians warned that the program _ under which
tips can be mailed or phoned in anonymously _ will create a society
in which people spy on each other.
   ``This kind of program will not make us drug-free. It will just
make us unfree,'' said Bob O'Brien, spokesman for the American
Civil Liberties Union.
   The statewide program announced Monday encourages residents to
fill out coupons giving the name and address of suspected drug
users or dealers, the address of suspicious activity or the license
plates of cars in suspected drug areas. The coupon includes a
toll-free number and the address of state police headquarters.

   The decision to have the census count overseas
U.S. military personnel at their ``home of record'' is expected to
be a boost for many inland states.
   ``I am genuinely pleased ... over a million Americans who are
living abroad temporarily while serving our country will now be
represented fairly in Congress,'' said Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio.
   And Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., termed the decision ``good news for
many ... states that wouldn't have gotten a fair count under the
previous policy.''
   Kohl had pressed for the change, contending that the original
plan to count service people based on their last duty station hurt
the Midwest while giving an unfair advantage to states with
military ports of embarkation such as California and Virginia.

   Mohan Lal fled his village 13 years ago
to escape the insults that were part of life as a Hindu without a
caste.
   When he returned home last month, Lal found that his family and
other casteless people still were pariahs of the village in
Rajasthan state.
   Caste Hindus do not allow ``outcastes,'' as they are called, to
wear shoes, ride bicycles, use umbrellas, drink from the main
village well or hold their heads up while walking in the street.
   Dozens of other rules ostracize the 100 million people in this
nation of 880 million who are Harijans, untouchables who do not
belong to any of the four castes recognized by the Hindu religion.
   ``We are treated worse than dogs,'' said Lal, 28, now a
construction supervisor in New Delhi.
   Harijans have suffered for centuries under the rigid Hindu caste
system, and the oppression is compounded by poverty and illiteracy.
Most Harijans are agricultural laborers who are lucky to earn
enough for two meals a day.
   ``There is a lack of awareness and coordination among the
Harijans,'' said T.K. Oomen, a sociologist. ``There is no mass
consciousness. Harijans are a group by itself, but they are not a
group for itself.''
   Sociologists and social activists say the subjugation of
Harijans is perpetuated by politicians because the untouchables
provide useful ``vote banks'' during elections.
   Harijans means ``children of God,'' in Hindi. Mohandas K. Gandhi
gave untouchables the name in hopes it would provide them some
respectability.
   The practice of untouchability was declared illegal after
independence from Britain in 1947, but continued unchecked.
   Politicians rarely talk about the problems of untouchables.
Welfare Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, a Harijan himself, acknowledged
in Parliament in May that he did not know how many Harijans who
were victims of violence had been aided by the government.
   Paswan said authoritied had been ``asked to take appropriate
action both to punish the perpetrators or crimes and to provide
appropriate relief and rehabilitation to the victims.''
   No minister or welfare official has made a public statement
about the lack of progress in solving the problem of
untouchability, but many say privately it is endemic, and too big
to be solved by the government.
   The four Hindu castes, which determine a person's social
position by birth, are the Brahmins, or priests; Kshatriyas, or
soldiers, governors and landowners; Vaishyas, or tradespeople and
farmers, and Shudras, or craftspeople and menial workers. Each
caste has many subdivisions.
   According to Hindu belief, caste Hindus are defiled by touching
a Harijan and water becomes polluted if a Harijan walks past the
well.
   Such beliefs took root about 2,500 years ago and remain
widespread in Indian villages, where 75 percent of the people live,
according to sociologists.
   ``In villages, they can't use umbrellas, wear new clothes or
ride bicycles in the presence of caste Hindus,'' said Kailash
Satyarthi, a social activist. ``Harijans are beaten up for this,
their women raped and men sometimes killed.''
   Last month, the government said 14,269 cases of atrocities
against Harijans were recorded in 1989, including 759 rapes and 479
murders.
   One crime was the burning to death of a Harijan laborer April 5,
allegedly by his uppercaste village landlord. The case was
publicized because Dhanraj was a resident of Prime Minister V.P.
Singh's constituency of Fatehpur in the northern state of Uttar
Pradesh.
   The landlord belonged to Singh's subcaste, the Thakurs, who are
part of the Kshatriya caste.
   Members of the opposition Congress Party raised the issue in
Parliament and brought the victim's widow to New Delhi.
   ``V.P. Singh should be sent to jail because he is trying to
protect the killers,'' said Kanshi Ram, president of the Majority
People's Party.
   Ram, born into the Sikh religion, said the crime in Fatehpur was
not unusual.
   His party is the only one in India that speaks for the Harijans.
He said they and and tribespeople, who also are outside the caste
system, make up 25 percent of the population and the lower castes
are another 50 percent.
   Despite such a large reservoir of potential support, the
Majority People's Party is strong only in some districts of
northern India. Harijans, uniformly distributed through the
country, do not have a common political organization.
   Social activists say politicians use of the lack of leadership
to perpetuate divisiveness among those of no caste.
   ``The Harijans are splintered across political parties and each
group is something like a politician's personal borough,'' Oomen
said.
   Politicians guard the status quo because economic and
educational progress would ``open the eyes of the Harijans,'' said
Satyarthi, the social activist.

<TEXT>
   Children smacked together their hands as
they tried to ``pop'' bubbles that appeared to float toward them.
Other viewers ducked as balloons seemingly burst in their faces.
   The movie they were viewing at the Osaka Expo '90 was a new film
technology that seems to pull moviegoers right into the screen.
   The film, which shows simulations of microscopic life processes
beginning with photosynthesis in plants and ending with blood
sugar's dizzying trip through human veins, is being shown to
thousands of viewers each day at the Expo's Fujitsu Pavilion. It is
one of several high-tech works produced by the Canadian firm Imax
Systems Corp. in cooperation with Japanese partners.
   Fujitsu's film, ``Echoes of the Sun,'' shows strong imprints of
both partners. Many of the visual images in the movie were produced
with computer graphics developed by the major Japanese electronics
firm.
   A Fujitsu supercomputer _ a computer that handles extremely
large inputs of data at very high speeds _ was used to make the
stunning images of plant cells, muscle fibers and atoms that float
at the audience from the bowl-shaped screen overhead.
   It was also used to synchronize the two separate images used to
produce a vivid sense of the three-dimensional.
   Imax is a pioneer of giant-screen film technology. Its films all
use a 70 mm film format, with each frame 10 times the size of
conventional 35 mm films, special projectors and six-channel sound
systems. Its new technologies involve the use of multiple or
custom-designed screens to give viewers a sense of leaving their
seats to travel with the camera.
   The Fujitsu theater is premiering the first full-color film
using IMAX Solido, a bowl-shaped screen like that of a planetarium.
Viewers wear goggles with lenses made of liquid crystal diodes,
like the face of a watch or computer screen, that react to sensors
in the two projectors used to show the left- and right-eye views of
each scene.
   Since vision usually involves the combining of separate views
from each eye into a single, three-dimensional image, the 20-minute
Solido film gives a very vivid 3-D impression. The screen extends
beyond the peripheral vision of the audience and seems to disappear.
   Water seems to splash into the seats, feathers from a pillow
fight float through the air, and the finale _ showing a
loincloth-clad Kodo drum troupe from Sado Island in the Japan Sea _
thunders muscularly through the theater.
   Another IMAX film that made its debut at the Osaka exposition is
IMAX Magic Carpet. It does not require goggles, but it involves two
18-by-25-meter (59.4-by-82.5-foot) screens _ one in front of the
audience and the other underfoot, but visible through a transparent
floor.
   In keeping with the theme of the Osaka International Garden and
Greenery Exposition, ``Flowers in the Sky'' at the Sanwa Midori-Kan
(Green Hall) documents the migration of monarch butterflies from
Canada to Mexico, where they winter.
   While it isn't a 3-D film, synchronized images above and below
also give viewers a strong sense of floating through the air along
with the butterflies over lakes and forests, above Niagara Falls
and across the Gulf of Mexico on their 1,900-mile journey.
   Helicopters and other aircraft used to track the monarchs
carried two synchronized cameras _ one facing forward and another
facing downward _ to capture the feeling of flying through the air.
   But the 15-minute film, which is sponsored by a group of
companies led by the Sanwa Bank, often uses only the upper screen
to follow the life cycle of the butterflies and has a less dramatic
visual impact than the 3-D Solido film.
   Japanese audiences saw the premiere of Imax's first high-tech
film 20 years ago at the Osaka 1970 exposition, and the latest
films are among the most popular attractions at the 1990 exposition.
   Organizers at both pavilions said their theaters were filled to
capacity for every performance, with many viewers waiting several
hours for a chance to float through the air while still safely
seated.

<TEXT>
   After being kicked out of China for his
blistering attacks on the Beijing leadership, Taiwan folk singer
Hou Dejian wants to head back to the recording studio away from the
political limelight.
   ``I used to be an amateur dissident in China. Now I want to
resume my career as a professional musician,'' Hou, 33, said in a
recent interview, just weeks after Chinese authorities placed him
on a fishing boat bound for this offshore island.
   His deportation last month ended an eventful sojourn in China
that began seven years earlier with his defection from Taiwan, the
seat of the Nationalist Chinese government that rivals the Chinese
communists. He left behind a wife, a two-year-old son and irate
Nationalist officials.
   Hou led a comfortable, generally apolitical life of celebrity in
China after the defection, symbolized by the maroon Mercedes sedan
he drove through the impoverished streets of Beijing. But all that
changed in 1989, when he went on a fast in Tiananmen Square in
support of the pro-democracy movement.
   When troops were called in to crush the massive pro-democracy
protest, Hou negotiated an evacuation of students from the square
and then fled himself to the safety of the Australian Embassy. He
emerged two months later and became one of the few Chinese willing
to openly condemn the government.
   He then disappeared May 31, just before he was to issue an open
letter calling for the release of political prisoners. He surfaced
in Taiwan three weeks later, saying Chinese authorities forced him
to choose deportation or jail.
   The lean, bespectacled songwriter is now free on bail while
prosecutors investigate whether he illegally entered Taiwan. His
case is expected to be treated leniently because of his role in the
pro-democracy movement.
   The ambivalence of the government toward Hou, whose 1983
defection was a stinging propaganda blow to the Nationalists, is
reflected in the Taiwanese public at large.
   One-third of the respondents to a recent survey in the China
Times newspaper said they welcomed Hou's return, while one-quarter
said they did not. Some of the people surveyed referred to Hou as
an ``opportunist'' or ``grass on the fence'' that bends whichever
way the wind blows.
   But publisher Chen Pai-chung looks at the singer in a different
light. ``Opportunists are those who cater to both sides, but Hou
has said things that pleased neither.''
   Hou, who claims he does not care much about the poll results,
would no doubt agree with Chen's evaluation. He is busy writing a
100,000-word autobiography titled ``The Real Troublemaker.''
   The chain-smoking singer, who lives with his two younger
brothers in a quiet suburban community, also plans to record an
album of songs written during the past two years. One cut tells of
his wife in China who left him for another exiled dissident,
student leader Wu'er Kaixi. ``You are a little rock in my shoe,''
go the lyrics. ``You kill me wherever I go.''
   In his television talk show appearances, interviewers seem
particularly interested in Hou the jilted lover. They also pepper
him with accusatory questions about his statement last year to the
official Chinese media that he saw nobody killed in Tiananmen on
June 4, 1989, and believed fewer than 1,000 people died in the
crackdown.
   Hou's answers on television tend to be brief and abstract, but
in an interview with the AP he spoke plainly about his generally
pessimistic view of China's future.
   Hou is particularly gloomy about the prospects for democratic
change in China. The liberalization already under way in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union won't come to China soon because the
peasantry, which accounts for the bulk of the population, is too
conservative and unreceptive to revolution, he said.
   He also believes that the fractured groups of exiled Chinese
dissidents are ``doomed to collapse, just like ice that melts into
water on a hot day.''
   The dark portrait of China painted by Hou represents a
fundamental change for a writer who's first hit and still most
memorable song, ``Heir of the Dragon,'' in 1978, was filled with
nostalgic admiration for the Chinese people living on both sides of
the Taiwan Straits.
   The song was published when the United States announced plans to
switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing and helped
boost confidence in Taiwan's future. ``I wrote the song because I
believed Chinese could solve the problem on our own,'' he recalled.
   The singer now acknowledges that when he finally arrived in
China he ``realized Chinese culture was helpless ... because it was
a culture that served emperors for 3,000 years. Chinese are slaves
who need masters.''
   Hou has become an admirer of Western civilization, which he says
does not have such a servile past. Once his legal problems are
resolved, he hopes to move to Australia to study English.

<HEAD>When They Say No New Taxes in New Hampshire, They MEAN No New
Taxes</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In New Hampshire, where George Bush learned
lip reading, taxes are a prime issue in a state campaign mirroring
the financial squeeze that finally forced the president to swallow
his no-new-tax vow.
   Gov. Judd Gregg says Bush made a mistake when he dropped the
barrier against raising federal taxes. Gregg, seeking a second
term, isn't budging from his own pledge against a state sales or
income tax, although he presided over a round of increases in most
existing levies.
   ``He has raised taxes more than any other governor in history,''
said J. Joseph Grandmaison, a former Democratic state chairman, one
of three candidates for the nomination to oppose Gregg.
   The governor said the New Hampshire tax system works to keep a
rein on government by restricting state revenues. ``It has served
us well ...'' Gregg said in an interview. ``We continue to be the
lowest taxed state in the country on the basis of personal income.''
   New Hampshire has neither general sales nor income tax, and the
pledge to keep it that way has become standard in state campaigns,
a line breached only by losers.
   Most campaign years, the pledge against a broad-based tax has
been unanimous among the contenders in both parties. Robert
Preston, minority leader of the state Senate, has taken that pledge
in his bid for the Democratic nomination for governor.
   The other two Democratic candidates in the Sept. 11 primary are
talking of tax change. Grandmaison said the system should be
reviewed and reformed, ending the era of no general sales or income
tax, although he isn't proposing a specific formula. Paul
Blacketor, a state representative and college professor, recommends
a state income tax.
   Those are perilous campaign positions. That lesson was
reinforced when John Sununu, now the White House chief of staff,
was elected governor in 1982, upsetting a Democrat who eased away
from the orthodox ban against sales or income tax, just as a
wavering Republican was ousted in a primary a decade earlier.
   In 1988, when Vice President Bush limped into the New Hampshire
presidential primary campaign after losing his first campaign test
in Iowa, the no-tax issue was tailored to his needs. Sununu ran the
campaign in which Bush and his barrage of campaign commercials
depicted Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas as a pro-tax Republican. The
tactic helped Bush overtake Dole to win the primary; he had no more
trouble on his way to the GOP nomination.
   The tax pledge became a staple of the Bush campaign, and
eventually a one-liner:
   ``Read my lips: no new taxes.''
   That gave way late last month to a Bush concession that there
will have to be ``tax revenue increases'' to cope with a swollen
federal budget deficit. Bush said he'd had to rethink his position
in changing circumstances. Sununu resisted the tax retreat.
   Gregg, a former House member, said Bush made a mistake when he
dropped the tax bar without a Democratic commitment to slash
spending. ``My experience in Congress is that they'll take all the
taxes you'll give them, and spend it,'' he said.
   He said Bush's concession on taxes muted a basic Republican
theme. ``It blurs the distinction between the parties,'' Gregg said.
   But the governor said it won't hurt the GOP in New Hampshire,
where conservative Republicans are absolutists on the tax issue,
federal and state. Gregg said he'll try to cope with slumping state
revenues and an increasing deficit with spending curbs, not with a
broad-based tax.
   New Hampshire already has raised the rates on its assortment of
state taxes, and imposed a new 5 percent communications tax.
   Property taxes have spiraled upward, stirring signs of the kind
of tax rebellion that has hit elsewhere. It shows in town votes to
turn down local school budgets. Rising property taxes have become a
staple of talk radio programs. A poll conducted this spring by
American Research Group of Manchester showed that 57 percent of
those surveyed were opposed to a state sales tax _ but 58 percent
would favor one if it came with a guarantee that the revenues would
be used to cut property taxes.
   Grandmaison is banking on those attitudes as he proposes
changing a system in which more than 60 percent of combined state
and local revenues come from property taxes. The national average
is 20 percent.
   ``Our reliance on the property tax is inherently unfair,'' he
said.
   He said any proposed tax bill would have to provide for the
return of revenues to the towns to ease the property tax burden, or
it wouldn't stand a chance of enactment.
   Gregg said that won't work and New Hampshire voters know it.
   ``You don't reduce taxes by raising taxes,'' he said. ``That's
medicine man politics.''

   United Methodist clergy are ``consistently
more liberal'' than lay members, according to research by the
denomination's general council on ministries.
   It found among those not attending the denomination's last
governing conference, 62 percent of the laity and 25 percent of the
clergy consider the Bible the ``literal word of God,'' while only
26 percent of the clergy and 26 percent of the laity who were
conference delegates did so.
   Response to that question was found to be an indicator of
responses on 45 other issues surveyed in the 9 million-member
denomination.
   ``We have heard for years that the local church appeared to be
more conservative'' than elected delegates, said the Rev. Mearle
Griffith of the council's research office. The data seemed to
substantiate it.
   Sixty-nine percent of non-delegates said they are more
conservative than the general conference actions. Greatest degree
of agreement was found with the conference statement that
``homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching.''

   Roman Catholic Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk and
other leaders of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops may
meet this fall with members of a group of Roman Catholic
homosexuals, according to a spokesman.
   The conference is considering whether to grant the request of
the homosexual group, Dignity-USA, for a meeting, Pilarczyk
spokesman Ray George said. Pilarczyk of Cincinnati is president of
U.S. bishops.
   The meeting would be conducted in Washington just prior to the
start of their scheduled November meeting there, George said.
   Dignity-USA claims 4,200 members in 90 chapters nationwide. The
church has barred its chapters in various cities from meeting or
holding special religious services in Catholic churches.
   Patrick Roche of Seattle, president of Dignity-USA, said he is
encouraged that Pilarczyk has indicated he would be receptive to
some sort of discussion.

   An appeal of Jews who formerly lived in
Mannheim, Germany, has been presented at embassies both of East and
West Germany urging them to recognize a ``special relationship''
with Jews and Israel.
   A resolution asking such a step had been approved earlier at a
reunion in Monticello, N.Y., of 350 Jews and their spouses who
formerly lived in Mannheim. The resolutions asked that the
following steps be taken in moves to reunite the two Germanies:
   That they make clear ``they will not condone anti-Semitism'' and
will be ``forever vigilant'' against the ``horrors of the past'';
that German schools teach about the Holocaust, and German leaders
commit themselves to a ``special relationship between Germany, the
state of Israel and the Jewish people.''

<HEAD>Church ``Storm'' Fades As Clergy And Laity Find More Accord</HEAD>
<NOTE>With Laserphoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Once diagnosed as heading into a stormy
collision, mainline Protestant clergy and lay people now have
shifted into closer accord. They still show some differences, but
in intermingled ways.
   Both sides have modified their stances, sometimes switching
positions with each other.
   ``There has been movement on both parts,'' says sociologist
Donald A. Luidens in describing results of an extensive study.
``Collectively, they now have more that knits them together than
separates them.''
   Some surprising reversals turned up, including these:
   Lay people, who used to criticize the clergy as lax on doctrine,
now are the most flexible about it. Clergy, once accused of
neglecting doctrine to meddle in politics, now are the most devoted
to it.
   ``Clergy have become the defenders of doctrine,'' Luidens said
in an interview. ``Lay people are more flexible about it. They tend
to see personaal piety and experience as touchstones of faith
rather than the creeds and traditional standards.
   ``My sense is that the theological speculation of the clergy has
been bought by the laity.''
   Politically, the clergy remain more liberal than the laity, the
study found in regard to a variety of issues, while lay people are
more likely to take more conservative positions.
   The study involved completed questionnaires from 1,756 lay
people and 579 clergy in the Reformed Church in America, generally
considered a middle-course denomination among mainline Protestants.
   ``Case studies have indicated it is quite exemplar, with the
same ebb and flow that most of the mainline denominations have,''
Luidens said. ``My sense is that mainline churches in general
likely would show the same patterns.''
   The denomination is America's oldest Protestant body with a
continuous ministry. It is rooted in Dutch Reformed, Presbyterian
traditions. Medium sized with about 340,000 members, it
participates in major ecumenical organizations.
   Luidens, who chairs the sociology department at the
denomination's Hope College in Holland, Mich., and another
sociologist there, Roger J. Nemeth, conducted the study.
   It was prompted by questions about the relative calm in the
churches nowadays in contrast to indications found in a study 20
years ago that clergy-laity differences were propelling them toward
a shattering clash.
   In that 1969 study, ``The Gathering Storm in the Churches,''
sociologist Jeffery Haden saw evidence that the clergy's liberal
theology and social activism was dividing them from a socially and
theologically conservative laity.
   But the new study finds that the signs of storm have passed and
that ``a form of rapprochement has taken place.'' Most lines of
division no longer were found between clergy and laity but within
those groups.
   Moreover, Luidens said much of the past ``liberal agenda'' seems
to have become the ``mainstream agenda'' that is generally accepted
by clergy and laity.
   They both now largely ``accept women's rights and support the
poor and minority rights, are critical of the arms race and
sometimes of U.S. foreign policy,'' he said.
   ``We don't have the old divisions on these things between clergy
and laity. Rather there are some of both on either side.''
   However, on political issues such as increased social programs,
homosexual rights, defense spending, the death penalty, banning
abortion and school prayer, clergy were found more liberal than
laity. It was more conservative.
   At the same time, lay people were found more liberal than clergy
on theological beliefs such the Apostles' Creed, the Heidelberg
Catechism, Nicene Creed and other historic doctrinal statements. On
these, the clergy were more conservative.
   Nemeth said that ``in contrast to a single-minded conservativism
among the laity and a single-minded liberalism among the clergy,''
some clergy and laity were liberal on both politics and beliefs,
while some clergy and laity were conservative on both fronts.
   A ``pluralist patchwork of perspectives'' apparently has
developed, the researchers aid, making for ``more grounds for
agreement than existed in the 1960s and 1970's.
   ``As a consequence, the church is not as factionalized as it
was, and stability is more likely.''
   While clergy generally remained politically more liberal, as
found by Hadden two decades ago, the clergy now ``are more
conservative theologically than are the laity,'' the report says.
   Hadden had speculated that as a result of the past conflict, one
side or the other might capture control of the churches, or that
the more radical clergy would leave the church to push their causes
elsewhere.
   Luidens and Nemeth speculate some of the latter happened, but
their data don't deal with that aspect. In any case, they found the
storm had receded. The report says:
   ``In effect, the current status quo seems possible in part
because the groups `cross-rough' each other. ... It would appear
that a pluralist mode of adaptation has taken place which permits
collective cohesion in the face of divergent and overlapping
theological and political opinions.''

   Filmmakers forever proclaim that theirs is a
collaborative craft, but rarely has there been such a close
partnership as the one that produced ``Quick Change.''
   The partners: Bill Murray and Howard Franklin. Murray starred,
along with Geena Davis, Randy Quaid and Jason Robards, and
co-produced with Robert Greenhut. Franklin wrote the script.
Together they directed.
   Co-directors of major films are a rare breed. Unless they are
brothers, such as the Zuckers (``Airplane!''), co-directors usually
end up not talking to each other. In the case of Murray and
Franklin, they were not only talking, they sat down for a joint
interview.
   Murray is the ``Saturday Night Live'' graduate who hit with
low-budget comedies ``Meatballs'' and ``Stripes,'' then moved on to
the bigger stuff: ``Ghostbusters,'' ``Tootsie,'' ``Scrooged.''
Screenwriter Franklin (``Someone to Watch Over Me'') makes his
debut as a director with ``Quick Change.''
   Franklin was more straight in his responses, Murray more
whimsical. Here are their comments:
   Q. (To Franklin) Did Murray ever bark at you as a writer?
   A. Does he bark? Never. He's a gentleman and a kind soul. I just
ruined his image, I guess.
   Q. (To Murray) Does Franklin ever bark at you as an actor?
   A. He doesn't bark. But he doesn't always use the newspaper.
He's well-behaved, but he does have fleas. He has problems, big
problems, but nothing that couldn't be solved in one of the finer
obedience schools.
   No, he was lion-hearted. Because he showed up for work expecting
to work. The rest of us showed up expecting to have fun.
   Q. (To Franklin) Did Bill look over your shoulder when you were
writing the script?
   A. No, he was 3,000 miles away when I was writing. A couple of
times I tried writing when Bill was there, so I limited my writing
to the West Coast. One of the questions people have been asking is:
Was there a lot of improvisation on the set? In fact there wasn't.
   A lot of that went into the script itself. Bill is naturally
funny and comes up with funny things. Because we were dealing with
the script for so many years, he was able to come up with
contributions.
   Q. (To Murray) You wear three hats _ actor, co-director,
co-producer. Why?
   A. I had more jobs because I felt the more I had, the better
chance of achieving one of them. I dunno, I have no explanation.
I'm usually not this ambitious. I don't know what came over me. I
think it's because of all these processed foods I've been eating.
There's a kind of chemical imbalance.
   Q. Do you have a desire to maintain more control over your films?
   A. You don't worry about (a project) until you see it go wrong.
Then you say you'd just as soon make your own mistakes. Everyone
makes mistakes.
   Living with other people's mistakes is harder.
   Q. Were you both planning to direct from the beginning?
   A. (Franklin): Neither of us was in as director from the
beginning. We both liked the material, we worked on the script, and
eventually we got very proprietary about the script. Since each of
us was considering other projects to direct, we decided, why defer
our plans? Why not take this thing we liked a lot and do it
ourselves? It was just an idea whose time had come I guess.
   Q. (To Murray) As co-producer, how did you decide on casting
Geena Davis and Randy Quaid?
   A. Well, none of my relatives came through; they just couldn't
deliver. Randy Quaid I wanted from the first time I read the book
(by Jay Cronley). I kept after him, wheedled him, and he basically
held us up for a lot of money, saying, ``It's impossible for me to
do the part due to prior commitments.''
   We read a few people for the Geena Davis part, and we liked the
way she looked the best. We talked about the script a bit and asked
her to come back. She came back and had the part nailed, knew every
beat, exactly how it should go. We could not not hire her.
   She was a real delight, a dream to be around, loose, smiling,
professional, not a whiner, looks good, always got a smile. And her
mother brought brownies to the set. You couldn't ask for more.

<HEAD>``Wish You Were Here'' Not CBS' Funniest Home Video</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hmmm, say the Hollywood executives, ABC's
``America's Funniest Home Videos'' is now, it's happening, it's a
Nielsen knockout, it's ... fresh.
   ``Hey, kids,'' cries one mogul. ``Let's be creative. Let's get a
video camera!''
   Ergo, we face three more network shows starring video cameras
next season, including ABC's ``Going Places,'' about TV newcomers
working on a ``candid video'' TV series.
   But CBS is getting the jump on everyone Friday night. It is
starting ``Wish You Were Here,'' a summer sitcom that also stars a
video camera, plus some supporting actors.
   Its main supporting actor is Lew Schneider. He plays Donnie
Cogswell, a high-spirited, Tom Hanks-like yuppie who tapes himself
doing such things as:
   _ Buying a home video camera.
   _ Quitting his well-paying Wall Street stockbroker's job.
   _ Learning his apartment got flooded because he left the shower
on.
   _ Losing his yuppie girlfriend, Janet (Leah Lail), who wants to
break up even though he has told her, on bended knee, ``let's be
roomies'' until his apartment is fixed.
   He also tapes himself fleeing the New York rat race to become an
amateur videotaper of the world. He starts by using the last of his
money to fly to Paris to tape the sights and sounds of that fair
city.
   Flying to Paris isn't a bad idea.
   But it is a bad idea for him to send the tape of all this back
to his former girlfriend in New York, complete with a nonstop,
high-speed babble of narration in which he often says he wishes she
were with him.
   It also is a bad idea that she watches the tape. This is not
just because it has the herky-jerky, video verite style popularized
in the early 1970s by college students who realized they couldn't
write and went into TV.
   It also is because she has _ stand back, now _ a second yuppie
boyfriend (his name is Dave, but he really looks like a Jeff. This
may be because studies show most male yuppies are named Jeff).
   When Swain No. 2 drops by her apartment, says ``Hi,
Muffin-face,'' then notices Donny vowing eternal love on the
videotape, he gets cranky, even though she says Donny is a case of
past tense.
   He reluctantly agrees to watch the tape with her.
   ``Thank you, Mr. Bunny-nose,'' she playfully says.
   But when the taped Donny again pines for her and says, ``I can
even hear you calling me your little Bunny-face,'' Swain No. 2
objects. Take a shower, she says. Okay, he says, but wants her to
join him.
   ``Five minutes,'' he says. ``Be there. Dress optional.''
   This is sophistication for the '90s.
   Anyhow, a lovers' tiff erupts when she continues watching the
tape, which shows Donny chatting up a beautiful Frenchwoman in a
restaurant. That happens after a lover's tiff in which her beau
angrily stomps out.
   Things get worse for Janet when Donny reports a tiny fling with
this beautiful Frenchwoman.
   Mes etoiles, as they say in Paris.
   Is this adieu for Donny and Janet? Is he just trying to make her
jealous through the magic of what he calls his Donny-cam? Has he
realized the world is his oyster and he the Great Clam?
   Only those who love home-video shows or want to see the world's
longest 30-minute situation comedy will care. The writing and
direction of this epic in VCR are none too ept. It resembles the
work of film-school graduates.
   Be that as it may, five more video letters from Donny will
arrive after Friday's installment. Next week's electronic epistle
is from Budapest.
   Incidentally, ``Wish You Were Here'' may hold the record for the
most executive producers of a sitcom. It has six.

   CONNIE CHUNG STARTS SEMI-ANEW: The CBS News star, who got high
ratings with two ``Face to Face with Connie Chung'' Monday night
specials in May, will sort of start her new ``Face to Face'' series
next Monday. Her show then will repeat two earlier interviews and
offer a new interview with ``Die Hard 2'' star Bruce Willis. CBS
says this will be the pattern _ two repeat interviews and one new
one per show _ until Sept. 10, when ``Face To Face'' officially
gets under way with nothing but first-run interviews.
   ONLY IN LOS ANGELES: Public television station KCET in Los
Angeles reports that it's starting construction of a planned
Broadcast Center Complex that will be built in three phases. Phase
one is a four-story parking structure.

   True or false:
   a) Interest rates in the United States are painfully high right
now;
   b) The Federal Reserve has just promised to lower them.
   If you've been keeping up with the big money-management issues
of the day, chances are you didn't find that quiz very difficult.
   If you answered True to both statements, you would get plenty of
agreement from the ranks of the so-called ``opinion leaders'' in
places like the Bush administration and Congress.
   But that view of things isn't exactly unanimous. The way some
financial analysts see it, neither statement a) nor b) is
absolutely supported by the evidence.
   They suggest that if you are planning to make some decision
about what to do with your savings and investments based on those
assumptions, you could be making a mistake.
   The cost of credit and the difficulty of getting a loan at all
are indisputedly posing big problems for a good many people right
now. Interest rates, however, remain in the same range where they
have hovered for several years, says Paul Boltz, financial
economist at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore.
   ``The record shows that interest rates are not unusually high
for the long business expansion that began in late 1982,'' Boltz
observed.
   By his reckoning, the interest rate on one-year Treasury bills
averaged 8.20 percent in the first half of 1990, compared with an
average of 8.33 percent from 1983 through 1989.
   Thirty-year Treasury bonds carried interest rates of 8.55
percent, against a 1983-89 average of 9.74 percent. Fixed mortgages
stood at 10.08 percent, vs. a 1983-89 average of 10.76 percent.
   These comparisons are especially striking, Boltz adds, when you
consider that consumer-price inflation has lately been running at a
little more than a 5 percent annual rate, up from 3.6 percent to
3.7 percent on average through the '80s.
   As for the Federal Reserve, surely there was no mistaking
Chairman Alan Greenspan's statement a week or so ago that the Fed
stood ready to soften its credit policy in order to offset the risk
of a credit crunch.
   Indeed, Greenspan did say that, and the Fed moved the very next
day to lower the federal funds rate, the interest rate on overnight
loans between banks. On Wednesday he reaffirmed that he was seeking
to prevent a squeeze on the economy.
   But that is by no means the same thing as promising to reduce,
as if by pushing a button, the interest rates consumers and
businesses pay.
   Indeed, Greenspan has frequently insisted that the Fed doesn't
have the power to dictate on its own whether open-market interest
rates will rise or fall. Analysts like Boltz agree with him.
   The Fed can stimulate the flow of money through the banking
system, tipping the balance of supply and demand for credit in
favor of lower rates. Then traders in the bond and short-term money
markets have to do the rest.
   Their judgment can be influenced by a variety of other
influences, including interest rates overseas and potential changes
in inflation they foresee as a result of the Fed's policy.
   Said Boltz, ``the last time the Federal Reserve tried to help
out the economy with a lower federal funds rate was in December
1989, and things did not work out well. Market interest rates
immediately moved up smartly.''

<HEAD>Putting It to the Elderly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just a few years ago some critics were beginning
to view the elderly as a privileged class, with their rising Social
Security benefits, Medicare and lower income taxes.
   Moreover, some had sizable capital gains to rely on, a result of
surges in stock and real estate prices in the previous decade. As
asset owners, some benefited from the inflation that hurt younger,
asset-poor generations.
   They also had a powerful lobby that sought to protect the
improved position they occupied in economic society, and their
numbers were growing too. Some critics even referred to the threat
of Gray Power.
   Times have changed. The improved condition of the elderly was a
long time developing, mainly because the elderly had occupied so
feeble a position in economic society. It might take less time to
undo.
   Once relatively free of federal income taxes, some retirees now
could become among the biggest percentage taxpayers in American
society, according to a background paper prepared by the National
Center for Policy Analysis.
   The Dallas-based center, a nonprofit think tank that claims
neutrality, takes issue with a proposal under consideration in
Congress to raise taxes on some Social Security benefits.
   That proposal would lower to $12,000 from $25,000 the amount of
income a person could obtain without losing full Social Security
benefits. For couples, the comparable figures would be $18,000 and
$32,000.
   By doing so, according to the Center's paper, Congress would
effectively tax many older folks more than younger ones. Those in a
15 percent bracket, it says, might go to 22.5 percent; those at 28
percent might leap to 42.
   Nobody in Congress is conceding that point. Instead of raising
income taxes, they say, they are raising the benefits tax.
   Not so, says John Goodman, Center president. He declares it is a
tax on income, and he sets out to demonstrate.
   The first thing to understand, he says, is that no tax is
incurred unless a taxpayer's income reaches a certain level. When
that income level is reached _ $25,000 for an individual now,
$12,000 as proposed _ two things happen:
   1. For every dollar of income beyond that point the affected
person loses 50 cents of Social Security benefits.
   2. Simultaneously, that person pays taxes on the income that
caused them to lose the benefits.
   The result is this, according to the analysis: ``Since 50 cents
of benefits is taxed for each additional $1 of income, when elderly
taxpayers earn $1 they pay taxes on $1.50.''
   That is, those affected pay a tax rate 50 percent higher (22.5
percent) than other people in a 15 percent income tax bracket, and
50 percent higher (42 percent) than other taxpayers in a 28 percent
bracket.
   That's the beginning. Add in items such as the Social Security
FICA tax, a Social Security earnings penalty and state and local
taxes (some based on the Federal rate) and the elderly wage earner
can face an 80 percent tax.
   As presented in Congress, there would not be an income tax
increase for the elderly, only a lowering of the threshhold at
which earnings would be taxed. But, says Goodman, the impact is of
greater consequence than the intent.
   One of the arguments for taxing Social Security benefits is that
beneficiaries paid only a small portion of their benefits through
payroll taxes.
   But, says Goodman, if that argument is accepted, wouldn't it be
more reasonable to include a portion of Social Security benefits in
with ordinary income and tax the sum at rates of 15 percent to 28
percent?
   He suggests the young pay attention.
   Income levels today are relatively low enough to exclude many
retirees from the worst effects of the proposed tax, but the
inevitable rising of income standards in years to come eventually
would include everyone.

<HEAD>Traditional Dress Is Back After Years of Suppression</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnamese women once again are
wearing the ao dai, the sensual, elegant traditional dress that
rigid Communists suppressed for years in favor of drab shirts and
black trousers.
   Students alight from bicyles in pure white ao dais whose fabric
clings to the body and flows over the legs.
   The ao dai, which literally means ``long dress,'' had been worn
for at least 13 centuries, but virtually disappeared after the
Communists won the war in April 1975 and imposed their spartan
ethos on what had been South Vietnam.
   It is slit on both sides from the waist down and is worn with
loose white trousers. It usually is made of a blend of silk and
nylon and costs about 110,000 dong ($22), which is expensive in a
country with one of the world's lowest per capita incomes.
   Color and fashion began returning in late 1986, when the
authorities allowed a more open society and adopted Western-style
economic reforms.
   Now the ao dai graces high school students, hotel receptionists,
airport staff, and workers at the foreign trade bank, central post
office and textile mills in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.
   It also is said to be regaining popularity in other areas of
southern Vietnam.
   Tran Phuoc Chan, owner of the city's largest ao dai factory,
said his workers made only 10 a day in the years immediately after
the war and had to work second jobs.
   His 20 full-time employees now make 25 garments a day and work
extra hours to keep up with orders during the Christmas season and
Tet, the Vietnamese new year.
   Wives of Communist Party Politburo members have begun wearing ao
dais at receptions, said Nguyen The Thanh, editor of the magazine
Ho Chi Minh Women's Weekly.
   A Miss Ao Dai contest the magazine sponsored in March 1989 was
the greatest impetus for the revival. It was the first beauty
pageant in the city since 1975 and the most popular event in recent
years.
   ``The ao dai has immortal beauty; no one can kill it,'' Ms.
Thanh said. ``Even without this contest, it would have reappeared.''
   For five nights, a gymnasium that seats 6,000 was jammed with
people cheering their favorites among the 165 contestants, she
said. Do Thi Kieu Khanh, a 20-year-old hairdresser, won in a bright
yellow ao dai embroidered with roses.
   Despite the more liberal atmosphere, the mayor and local
Communist Party chief refused to attend the contest and older
officials found the swimsuit competition offensive, Ms. Thanh said.
   Some derided the ao dai as symbolizing luxury and laziness, she
said, and the party has rejected the magazine's application for a
another Miss Ao Dai contest this year.
   The ao dai's return to the classroom has been received
enthusiastically, but some parents complain of the cost and
students say it is difficult to ride a bicyle while wearing the
dress, said Ho Thieu Thung of the Education Department.
   He said the department made it the required uniform in 10 senior
high schools this year in response to student requests, and for all
senior highs next year.
   ``When the girls started wearing the ao dai, the male students
suddenly became very polite with them,'' and boys took over such
messy classroom chores as cleaning the blackboards, Thung said.
   Chan, the ao dai maker, said white fabric embroidered with birds
and flowers is the most popular.
   Some ao dais are sequined. Other variations recently seen in the
city include leopard-skin patterns and bare-shoulder styles.
   A history published by Women's Weekly said the ao dai's origins
were uncertain but that temple carvings showed wealthy women of the
7th century wearing them.
   Women in the cold north wore several ao dais at a time and the
wives of 19th century kings wore as many as 18 at once, the history
said.
   In the 1930s, city people followed European style with a tighter
fit and higher slits. They experimented with several styles, but
the traditional one prevailed.

<DATELINE>SHABURA REFUGEE CAMP, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Subhi Abu Dahi
proudly displays his trophies: the scars of four gunshot wounds
from encounters with Israeli soldiers in nearly 32 months of the
Palestinian uprising.
   A 7-year-old sister, Lulu, sits in a wheelchair, eyes dull and
head tilted against a brace. She has been paralyzed, unable to
speak, since a soldier fired a rubber-coated steel ball that struck
her in the head 18 months ago.
   Their father and an older brother were killed by Israeli forces
over the years and a 14-year-old brother was shot in both legs.
   Subhi is tall and muscular with big, broad hands, and looks like
a high school basketball player, but life has left him little time
for sports.
   In the dusty, garbage-strewn streets of Shabura, young men his
age are more likely to throw stones at Israeli soldiers than shoot
balls through hoops. The soldiers often respond with bullets, and
Subhi has his scars to show.
   The toll on his family has been dreadful even by the standards
of Shabura, where nearly every home has a tale of suffering from a
generation of Israeli occupation.
   About 25,000 Palestinian refugees are crowded into the camp's
small concrete-block houses. Residents say 37 people in Shabura
have died in clashes with the Israeli army since the uprising began
in December 1987.
   Shabura is part of the town of Rafah, on the Egyptian border.
Palestinian flags, outlawed by Israel, fly throughout the camp and
slogans written on walls declare hatred and anger for the Israeli
presence in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, which Israel captured
from Egypt and Jordan in 1967.
   ``Stopping the intefadeh is like killing the Palestinian
people,'' reads one slogan, using the Arabic word for the uprising.
   An extended Abu Dahi family of 29 people lives in eight small
rooms under a corrugated tin roof. Similar spread-out shacks are
close by, separated by sandy paths used for dumping garbage and
dishwater.
   Cousins and brothers in the Abu Dahi household told the family's
story in the heat of a July afternoon. They cursed the soldiers,
accusing them of firing needlessly, and said the family would
continue fighting Israeli occupation.
   ``If things don't change, the uprising will go on, with rocks,
firebombs and killing collaborators,'' Subhi said. ``Perhaps there
will be weapons. Some people have guns. We have seen collaborators
killed with shots.''
   His mother, Kamilya, said of the Israelis: ``When they leave,
the uprising will end. If they stay forever, we fight forever.''
   Kamilya is 40 and has borne nine children. She said her first
husband, Subhi's father, was killed as a guerrilla leader in 1970.
Her oldest son, Osama, was shot to death when he attacked an
Israeli border guard with a knife in October 1988.
   The paralyzed child, Lulu, is from her second marriage. In
Moslem fashion, Kamilya married the brother of her slain husband.
   Lulu was shot when she ran outside during a riot in February
last year, Kamilya said.
   At the time, the army said Lulu was wounded in a stone-throwing
riot. Military officials have accused Palestinians of putting
youngsters in the front of protests because wounded children are
bad publicity for Israel.
   Kamilya said Lulu ``saw a boy she knew being arrested. She
grabbed at him, trying to tug him away from the soldiers. One
soldier opened fire.''
   She looked at the girl's frail, twisted body and said: ``We
sacrificed too much.''
   Her glance moved to Subhi, the oldest surviving son, scarred by
bullets on the face, one arm and both ankles.
   ``People here call him the suspended `shaheed','' she said.
Shaheed, Arabic for martyr, describes the Palestinian dead of the
uprising.
   ``That's why I am afraid,'' she said. ``That's why he got
married so young. Now he has to support his family. He shouldn't do
anything illegal.''
   Subhi's wife, Hanan, also 19, blushed when Subhi was asked if he
was ready to give up revolution for a job and children.
   ``I am studying the situation,'' he said. ``I will manage to
combine work, everything.''
   Three days earlier, Subhi was freed after 180 days in Gaza
Central Prison, his third jailing of the uprising. He was convicted
of ``offering services to an illegal organization,'' the mainstream
Fatah guerrilla faction led by PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.
   According to Subhi, the services were ``distributing leaflets,
writing graffiti, carrying money.''
   He has worked as a welder and house painter, but said it would
be difficult to find jobs in the economic shambles of Gaza. He is
not allowed to work in Israel because of his jail record.
   Two men who have jobs in Israel support the Abu Dahi clan. One
is a construction worker, the other a pizza cook. The family also
gets United Nations food aid and, Subhi said, a PLO ``stipend'' for
the members killed or wounded in the uprising.
   Subhi's grandfather, Ahmed, complained that, like many
Palestinians, his family had become used to living on handouts
since fleeing their village of Qubeiba near Ramle when Israel was
founded 42 years ago.
   ``In Qubeiba, there were rich and poor,'' he said. ``Now we are
all beggars.''
   Ahmed, 65, wears the white knit cap of a religious Moslem and is
known as Sheik Ahmed for his role as a mosque prayer leader.
   He said the family fled Qubeiba on May 23, 1948, then joined
thousands of other Palestinians in moving from place to place for
months to escape the Israeli army. They reached the Gaza Strip in
early 1949.
   Why did the family leave Qubeiba?
   ``There were clashes all around and we were afraid after Deir
Yassin,'' he said, referring to a Palestinian village where Jewish
irregulars massacred more than 200 men, women and children in April
1948.
   Israeli historian Benny Morris wrote that Israeli soldiers
captured Qubeiba and drove out the remaining inhabitants on May 27,
1948, four days after the Abu Dahis fled. The army demolished most
of the houses and Jewish immigrants took over what remained.
   ``I think my house was destroyed,'' said Ahmed Abu Dahi.
   From a cupboard, a grandson pulled a deed issued to Ahmed's
father in 1930, when Britain ruled Palestine. It described the
house as made of stone, built in 1910 and having a common wall with
another family's home.
   ``They live next to us here, too,'' Ahmed said.

   An appeal of Jews who formerly lived in
Mannheim, Germany, has been presented at embassies of both East and
West Germany urging them to recognize a ``special relationship''
with Jews and Israel.
   A resolution asking such a step had been approved earlier at a
reunion in Monticello, N.Y., of 350 Jews and their spouses who
formerly lived in Mannheim.
   The resolutions asked that the following steps be taken in moves
to reunite the two Germanys:
   _That they make clear ``they will not condone anti-Semitism''
and will be ``forever vigilant'' against the ``horrors of the
past.''
   _That German schools teach about the Holocaust, and German
leaders commit themselves to a ``special relationship between
Germany, the state of Israel and the Jewish people.''

   Roman Catholic Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk and
other leaders of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops may
meet this fall with members of a group of Roman Catholic
homosexuals, a spokesman said.
   The conference is considering whether to grant the request for a
meeting from the homosexual group Dignity-USA, Pilarczyk spokesman
Ray George said. Pilarczyk, the bishop of Cincinnati, is president
of U.S. bishops.
   The meeting would be conducted in Washington just prior to the
start of the bishops' scheduled November meeting, George said.
   Dignity-USA claims 4,200 members in 90 chapters nationwide. The
church has barred its chapters in various cities from meeting or
holding special religious services in Catholic churches.
   Patrick Roche of Seattle, president of Dignity-USA, said he was
encouraged because Pilarczyk had indicated he would be receptive to
some sort of discussion.

   United Methodist clergy are ``consistently
more liberal'' than lay members, according to research by the
denomination's general council on ministries.
   It found among those not attending the denomination's last
governing conference, 62 percent of the laity and 25 percent of the
clergy consider the Bible the ``literal word of God,'' while only
26 percent of the clergy and 26 percent of the laity who were
conference delegates did so.
   Response to that question was found to be an indicator of
responses on 45 other issues surveyed in the 9 million-member
denomination.
   ``We have heard for years that the local church appeared to be
more conservative'' than elected delegates, said the Rev. Mearle
Griffith of the council's research office.
   The data seem to substantiate it.
   Sixty-nine percent of non-delegates said they are more
conservative than the general conference actions. The greatest
degree of agreement was found with the conference statement that
``homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching.''

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the late 1960s, the Cowsills were the
quintessential American family, a sweet, pop rock group of five
siblings and their mini-skirted mother who later became the model
for TV's ``The Partridge Family.''
   By 1971, they had virtually vanished, the victim of a fickle
public and poor management. Their $30 million fortune disappeared
in bad investments. The breakup was so acrimonious, many members of
the family did not speak until their mother's funeral in 1985.
   ``It wasn't just the end of a business, it was the end of a
family,'' said group leader Bob Cowsill, 40.
   Several of the Cowsills spent the last two decades battling
drugs, alcohol and severe depression. The family declared
bankruptcy in 1977.
   Now they're planning a comeback _ both as a group and as a
family. They reunited for the first time in 20 years in Boston in
early July, in a concert dedicated to their mother. In attendance
at a packed club for the concert were singer Paula Abdul and two of
the Beach Boys.
   At their concert, the Cowsills sang the old hits as well as new
material, in a surprisingly smooth, polished set reminiscent of
such groups as Fleetwood Mac. They have a new manager and are
shopping a tape of new music at different record labels.
   The Cowsills had three No. 1 hits, including ``Hair,'' ``The
Rain, the Park and Other Things'' and ``Indian Lake,'' and two
other Top 10 singles from a total of eight albums. They starred in
their own NBC-TV special, headlined in Las Vegas, did milk
commercials and were plastered on the covers of teen magazines.
   ``We were the first family of rock 'n' roll,'' said Susan
Cowsill, 30, who joined the group when she was 7, later sang backup
for other artists and now collaborates with former Bangles member
Vicki Peterson.
   But the Cowsill brothers, who wanted to do serious music in the
tradition of the Beatles, Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones,
resented the bubble-gum image foisted on them by record companies.
   ``We'd worked hard to be a real creative band, and instead they
had us tap dancing on the Ed Sullivan show,'' said Barry Cowsill,
36, who now lives in Carmel, Calif. ``We didn't want to be these
cute guys on posters for lonely girls in the Midwest.''
   Several of the Cowsills considered changing their names in an
effort to be accepted as serious musicians. All have held a
succession of day jobs in recent years and performed solo in small
clubs.
   The band consisted of Bill, now 41, Bob, 40, Paul, 38, Barry,
36, John, 32, little sister Susan and their mother, Barbara. Bob's
twin brother, Richard, was excluded from the band by their father.
Bill was later kicked out of the band after a fight with his father.
   The wholesome-looking family from Newport, R.I., who shot to the
top between 1967 and 1970, fell as fast as they had risen.
   As their fame evaporated, so did the facade of the happy family.
Years under the iron rule of their father, and manager, Bud
Cowsill, took a toll.
   ``My dad was a seventh grade dropout who joined the Navy and he
ran his family like the military, too,'' said Bob Cowsill. ``We had
spent our whole lives together, 24 hours a day. When it came apart,
it was kind of an explosion.''
   At the time of their mother's death from emphysema, she was
working the night shift in a Rhode Island nursing home, estranged
from several of her children.
   ``She just wanted to be our mom, she never really wanted to be
up on stage,'' said Barry Cowsill. ``Her knees were rattling
together up there.''
   Bud Cowsill, whom his children say has ``mellowed,'' now lives
alone in Rosarita Beach in Mexico.
   The Cowsill kids were recruited for the ``Partridge Family'' TV
show in 1970, but refused to sign on when producers rejected their
mother in favor of actress Shirley Jones.
   The Cowsills got their start very early in Newport. Bill and Bob
taught themselves how to play guitar and Barry and John later
joined in. By 1965, they had a regular gig at a local club and were
spotted by a producer for NBC-TV's ``Today'' show who booked them.
   The ``Today'' show led to a record deal and Bud Cowsill decided
to add Barbara and Susan Cowsill to the band.
   ``Whatever Dad said, went,'' said Bob Cowsill, who has performed
solo for the past decade in small Southern California clubs. ``He
wasn't the kind of guy you argued with.''
   That rule extended to the arbitrary exclusion of Bob's twin
brother from the band.
   ``It was hard, man,'' said Richard Cowsill, who showed up
backstage at the Boston concert. ``People would say, `Oh, are you a
Cowsill?' and I had to say, yes, but it was hard to explain why I
wasn't in the band. Dad had his own reasons, I guess.''
   Bill and Richard are both recovering alcoholics and several
others have had serious problems with drugs. Many of the brothers
saw each other no more than a few times in the past 20 years and
rejected offers to go on ``oldies'' tours.
   But after deejay Barry Scott, who hosts a ``Lost 45s'' program
on WZLX-FM in Boston, taped an interview with Bob last year, the
group decided to get back together.
   The Cowsills hope to find a record company that will allow them
to do the kind of music they envisioned in the early days in
Newport. Only four Cowsills performed in Boston but the plan is to
add the other three, including Richard, once they get more bookings.
   ``We all love each other very much,'' said Barry Cowsill. ``It
was just like the molecules got too close. I think if people just
put away their prejudices, we can really come back again.''

   The 45th anniversary of Hiroshima is
commemorated Monday with an NBC drama that tells of personal
tragedies suffered in the first city destroyed by a nuclear bomb.
   ``Hiroshima: Out of the Ashes'' tells the stories of a postman,
his pregnant American daughter-in-law, a doctor and his new bride,
a young mother and her son, as well as that of a German missionary
and two American fliers held prisoner in the doomed city.
   Max Von Sydow stars as Father Siemes, a German Jesuit priest,
and Judd Nelson is Lt. Pete Dunham, an American POW. The movie also
features Kim Miyori as the mother, Pat Morita as the postman,
Tamlyn Tomita as his daughter-in-law and Stan Egi as the doctor.
   ``It's the drama of the bomb,'' said Von Sydow. ``It's an
ensemble film. It deals with a number of people. We follow what
happens to them before, during and after the bomb. I have first
billing, but my part is no bigger than the others.''
   The screenplay for ``Hiroshima: Out of the Ashes'' was written
by John McGreevey. Peter Werner directed.
   The B-29 Superfortress Enola Gay dropped an atomic bomb
nicknamed ``Little Boy'' on Hiroshima on Monday, Aug. 6, 1945. The
bomb devastated 4.1 square miles of Hiroshima, a city of 343,000
people, and killed thousands _ the estimates range from 80,000 to
200,000. The victims continued to die for years afterward of
radiation sickness.
   ``There was a German Jesuit missionary school at Hiroshima, and
I play one of the priests,'' said Von Sydow. ``He was in the city
when the bomb exploded, but not in the center. I've been reading
about the priests and what happened to them. The one my character
is based on lived until 1977. He suffered from radiation sickness.
   ``Father Siemes starts out as a very strict man who goes by the
book. After the disaster he opens his heart.''
   Von Sydow has been an incredibly busy actor. He had just arrived
from Australia, where he had completed a feature film called
``Father,'' in which he plays a post-World War II German immigrant
who buys a pub in Australia. Years later, his wife dies and his
daughter and her husband take over the pub.
   ``Suddenly, out of the blue, the father is accused of being a
war criminal,'' he said. ``It deals with loyalty, loyalties within
a family and wider loyalties.''
   Earlier this year, Von Sydow was seen in ``Red King, White
Knight,'' a spy thriller for Home Box Office. He played an East
European agent who comes out of retirement to help an American
agent prevent an assassination.
   Last summer, he co-starred with Keith Carradine in ``Dr.
Grassler,'' which was filmed in Budapest, Hungary. He describes
that role as a ``kind of crazy retired opera singer'' whose
daughter is hurt in a love affair with Carradine. ``That was fun
because the character was lighter than I'm used to doing in films.''
   He was nominated for an Academy Award as best actor in 1989 for
his role as the aging Swedish laborer in ``Pelle the Conqueror,''
which won an Oscar as best foreign-language film.
   After ``Hiroshima,'' he went to London to star with Matt Dillon
and Sean Young in ``A Kiss Before Dying.'' He is now in Australia
working on ``Until the End of the World,'' which also stars William
Hurt, Jeanne Moreau and Sam Neill. After that, he returns to Sweden
for an as-yet-untitled play about American playwright Eugene
O'Neill.
   Von Sydow's home is in Stockholm in his native Sweden, but he
has a summer home on the Swedish island of Gotland and an apartment
in Paris.
   ``I try to spend as much time at my summer home as possible,''
he said. ``I seem to spend most of my time making films around the
world _ Australia, Denmark, Hungary, Italy, the United States. I
live in airports. I go where the roles are. I'm a gypsy.
   ``I'll try to take it a little easier in the future if I can.
The trouble is I'm easily tempted. I like to work if the work is
interesting.''

  Blue jeans, for decades the uniform of rebels and
conformists alike, are fading from the fashion forefront as aging
baby boomers opt for new _ and more flattering _ looks.
   To put it bluntly, ``as their pocketbooks have gotten thicker,
so have their waists,'' said Alan Millstein, publisher of the New
York-based newsletter Fashion Network Report.
   Jeans don't fit the lives of the thirtysomething generation,
which is starting to confront the flab of middle age and facing the
fact that ``gravity is the reality,'' Millstein says.
   The biggest fans of jeans, traditionally tight-fitting,
youth-oriented fare, are those between the ages of 14 and 24, a
segment of the population that has been shrinking for the past
decade, said Dan Chew, marketing manager for Levi Strauss &amp; Co.,
headquartered in San Francisco.
   Jeanswear Communications, a New York-based fashion industry
group, said in a study released in June that total domestic jeans
sales dropped from a 1981 peak of 502 million pairs to 387 million
pairs in 1989.
   Deborah Bronston, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., estimates the number of jeans sold declined by 6 percent
during the first three months of this year alone.
   The decline of jeans has forced manufacturers to scramble for
ways to protect their domain, often with other products ranging
from children's sweat gear to sexy lingerie. They have met with
varying degrees of success. Some have been wounded because they
responded to changing tastes too late.
   VF Corp., a Wyomissing, Pa., jeans maker that markets Lee and
Wrangler brands and holds about 25 percent of the U.S. market,
recently announced it would close four jeans factories by September.
   The costs of that cutback will be reflected in the company's
second-quarter financial report and probably result in a 50 percent
earnings decline from a year earlier, VF Chairman Lawrence R. Pugh
said. He blamed a ``continuing shortfall in jeans orders resulting
from weak consumer demand.''
   Levi Strauss, on the other hand, is riding high. The company has
dramatically improved sales and profitability since it became a
private company five years ago in a debt-financed takeover. The
improvement has come from much more than just sales of the 501, its
classic 5-pocketed blue jeans.
   Levi's created Dockers, a cotton twill pant for ``maturing''
baby boom men. As one of retailing's brightest success stories,
sales of Dockers went from $35 million in 1986 to a projected $500
million-plus this year. The product line has been expanded to
include men's shirts and sweats as well as active wear for women
and children.
   ``Dockers have helped offset the basic softness in men's
jeans,'' Chew said.
   For VF, however, diversification has been far rockier. The
company purchased a North Carolina maker of men's cotton twill
pants in 1984 but closed the unit two years later to focus on its
acquisition of Blue Bell Holding Co., parent of Wrangler jeans,
Jantzen swimwear and Jansport sports clothes.
   The move shoved VF ahead of Levi as the nation's biggest jeans
maker. ``When jeans are booming, every age group is wearing them,''
said VF's chief financial officer, Jerry Johnson. But these days,
he said, there's ``a lack of fashionability attached to the
product.''
   This year VF has introduced a line of T-shirts and sweats under
the Lee label in an effort to exploit its best brand name. So far
sales are going ``very well,'' and the sweat shirts have sold out,
Johnson said.
   Still, the company hopes to reduce dependence on jeans, partly
by strengthening its intimate apparel offerings. VF, which sells
Vanity Fair and Lollipop brands, purchased the lingerie concern
Vassarette for $12 million earlier this year.
   Johnson said VF foresees growth of 10 percent annually in
intimate apparel and is seeking to acquire ``additional brands or
trademarks in that area.''
   Analyst Bronston predicted intimate apparel will account for 15
percent of VF's estimated 1991 sales of $2.73 billion, up from the
current 13 percent, while jeans will bring in 53 percent of annual
revenue, down from the current 55 percent.
   Many experts said jeans makers are hoping to strengthen their
dungaree business by exporting. While interest may be waning in the
United States, jeans still retain considerable allure in the Soviet
Union, parts of Europe and the Far East.
   Levi's Chew said international sales accounted for roughly a
third of the company's $3.6 billion in revenue last year, up from
about 20 percent from five years ago.
   But Levi's strategists also say the U.S. market can't be
ignored. The average American teen-ager still buys four to six
pairs of jeans a year. So Levi's is spending heavily on a fresh
advertising campaign directed by and featuring Spike Lee, acclaimed
director of ``Do the Right Thing.''
   Designer jeans, from Calvin Klein, Gloria Vanderbilt and others,
are partly responsible for expanding the acceptance of blue jeans
as appropriate dress for many occasions. But even at their peak in
1984, designer products accounted for less than 4 percent of the
total blue jean market, Chew said.
   Nonetheless, some designer labels have managed to adapt to a
changing marketplace. Guess? Inc., for example, which sells a basic
$56, 3-zip jean (one zipper on the fly, one on each ankle because
the pants are so tight), continues to drum up interest in its
broader array of clothes.
   Expensive skin-tight jeans were the cornerstone product when
Guess? was founded in 1981. But the company now sells everything
from miniskirts and suede cowboy shoes to fragrances and eyewear in
an effort to ``capture the customer who has needs other than
denim,'' said spokeswoman Leah Levy.
   The company is pushing its new Georges Marciano line of career
clothes for women, which appear in stand-alone boutiques in major
department stores.
   Still, Guess? derives about 80 percent of its estimated $400
million in annual sales from the denim collection. Rather than
allow its fortunes to rest on a single jean design, Guess?
continues to push ahead.
   This fall the silhouette of Guess? jeans change dramatically _
from excruciatingly tight to very baggy, ``anti-fit'' pants. Levy
said part of the reasoning behind the shift is that today's jeans
``don't have to fit.''

<HEAD>Conference Committee Considers Host of Clean Air Disputes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional negotiators must resolve a host
of disputes over how far government and industry should go to clean
the air, from placing emission restrictions on small factories to
helping workers laid off because of tougher pollution controls.
   The sheer size of the 148-member House-Senate conference
committee, more than a quarter of the Congress, points to the high
stakes in the political battle. The legislation is expected to cost
more than $21 billion a year in new pollution controls.
   ``There will be clean air legislation this year. I don't think
anyone disputes that,'' asserts Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman
of the conference.
   Baucus said in an interview that he considers separate clean air
bills passed by the House and Senate ``by and large very similar''
with identical goals of significantly cutting urban smog, reducing
acid rain and curtailing the industrial release of toxic chemicals
by the end of the decade.
   But there remains much dispute over details of the two bills.
   While environmentalists express concern the clean air package
may be weakened, industry lobbyists argue the next few months of
congressional negotiations could determine if some factories will
be forced to close because of the high costs of compliance.
   Industry is looking to allies on the House negotiating team, led
by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., to soften the legislation. Dingell
has protected automakers from tough pollution controls for years.
   The House named 139 members to the conference, ranging from
Henry Waxman, D-Calif., a longtime champion of tougher pollution
controls, to William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., the only congressman to
vote against the clean air bill in the Energy and Commerce
Committee.
   The Senate negotiators, on the other hand, number only nine.
Four of them _ Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
Baucus, Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., and Sen. David Durenberger,
R-Minn. _ led the Senate battle for clean air legislation. Seven of
the nine are members of the Senate Environment Committee and they
are expected to balk at any proposals that would significantly
weaken the legislation.
   The separate bills that breezed through both the House and
Senate last spring would impose stiff new requirements on industry
to control toxic chemicals, on factories to reduce smog-causing
pollution, and on electric power plants to curb sulfur dioxide,
which causes acid rain. They also would direct automakers to build
cleaner cars and oil companies to provide cleaner fuels to reduce
urban smog.
   But the House and Senate versions often differ on how far
companies should go to control toxic releases, what polluters
should be covered, or in some cases what measures should be taken
to comply.
   The final negotiations on these details will determine ``whether
you have a good clean air bill or a bill that's not very good at
all,'' said Richard Ayres, chairman of the National Clean Air
Coalition, an environmental umbrella group.
   Industry, meanwhile, makes no secret that it will push the
congressional negotiators to scuttle some of the strongest
requirements in either bill.
   ``We know the goals of the two bills are about the same. We're
trying to make it the most affordable to the American business
community and to the consumer,'' said William Fay, executive
director of the Clean Air Working Group, the industry's lobbying
coalition.
   Fay calls the government's estimated $21.5 billion price tag for
the clean air bill unrealistic and maintains the cost will be much
higher if some of the provisions found in either the Senate or
House bills survive.
   According to lawmakers, congressional aides and lobbyists, here
are a number of the most contentious issues that will have to be
resolved by the House and Senate negotiators:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>REQUIREMENTS ON NEW AUTOMOBILES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Both the House and Senate bills would require tougher tailpipe
emission controls. But the Senate bill would trigger a second round
of even tighter requirements automatically if air quality did not
meet federal health standards in a dozen pollution-plagued cities
by the end of the decade.
   The automakers argue they cannot meet the second phase of
controls with current technology and hope the House version will
prevail. They have a strong ally in Dingell.
   At the same time, however, the automakers plan to fight another
House provision _ not in the Senate bill _ that would require them
to build and market at least some alternative fuel cars.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONTROLS ON INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION
   Both bills would require large polluters emitting more than 100
tons a year to install new equipment to reduce smog-causing
emissions. But the House would include factories that pollute much
less _ as little as 10 or 25 tons a year _ in cities with the
dirtiest air.
   Industry and the Bush administration have argued that the more
sweeping controls in the House bill would force businesses to
close, put people out of work and jeopardize economic growth.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CLEAN FUELS
   Both bills call for cleaner motor fuels to be used in cities
with serious smog problems, but the language is under attack from
the oil industry, which says the government is trying write its own
recipe for gasoline. The oil companies and their congressional
allies have vowed to get the provisions changed, arguing the
requirement is aimed to boost the sale use of ethanol, which is
made from grain.</HEAD>
<HEAD>TOXIC INDUSTRIAL RELEASES
   Both bills would require that industry adopt new technology to
curb industrial releases of toxic chemicals into the air. But the
Senate bill would go another step by establishing minimum cancer
risk levels that would be allowed after the new equipment was
installed. If those risks could not be achieved a plant could be
ordered shut down.
   The House version, favored by industry and opposed by
environmentalists, would leave it to the Environmental Protection
Agency to establish ``an ample margin of safety'' beyond
installation of the new equipment.</HEAD>
<HEAD>JOBS PROTECTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The House bill calls for a three-year, $250 million program to
help workers who lose their jobs because of tougher pollution
controls. The Senate bill would provide no assistance.
   While Senate leaders have expressed support for the House
measure, the White House has threatened to veto legislation
containing assistance for workers, saying it would be difficult to
control the cost. While it is doubtful to many in Congress that
Bush would sacrifice clean air legislation because of the labor
assistance, the administration is expected to argue vigorously
against the provision.

about $3.3 million for three former executives.
   The ruling Tuesday by Judge Howard C. Buschman means the three,
who stepped down after the troubled retailer filed for protection
from its creditors, will have to line up with other unsecured
creditors if they want to collect anything they say is due them
under the contracts.
   They would recover the same percentage of what is owed them as

0.4 percent in June, the Federal Reserve reported.
   Last month's 0.4 percent gain, reported Tuesday followed a rise

   A bracelet eaten by an alligator. A wedding

Aruba.
   Those are some of the items Citibank says it has replaced since
it began offering buyers protection insurance to its 22 million
holders of Visa and MasterCard a year ago.
   Citibank, the nation's largest credit card issuer, said it has
paid ``several million dollars'' in claims to its cardholders
through the program, although it won't release specific numbers.
   In a survey released today, Citibank said that eyeglasses,
contact lenses jewelry and car stereos were the most frequent lost,
stolen or damaged items that have been replaced for credit-card
customers in the past year. It said the average claim paid was
between $150 and $175; the lowest was $1.29 for a bottle of
hairspray.
   The alligator-eaten bracelet, soiled wedding dress and banged-up
casket were among the more bizarre claims. Others include a shower
stall lost on a highway when it fell off a trailer and a set of
orthodontic braces misplaced on vacation.
   But Citibank said it has drawn the line on certain items like
theater and movie tickets, golf balls and living things.
   They said one customer tried to mail a dead gold fish as proof
of purchase, while another sought reimbursement for grass seed
eaten by birds.

   Keeping U.S. securities markets competitive in
a world of globalized, 24-hour trading cannot be left entirely to
the private sector, according to a congressional report.
   The Office of Technology Assessment said in a report to be
issued today that Congress may have to urge regulators to prod
market officials into taking a longterm view of market development.
   ``It is by no means certain that U.S. markets will remain in the
forefront of the movement toward 'round-the-clock global securities
trading,'' the OTA said.
   Last month, several securities exchanges in New York and Chicago
announced plans to phase in overnight trading over the next several
years in an attempt to regain some of the business lost to foreign
competitors during those hours.
   But the OTA, an arm of Congress that analyzes science and
technology, says the change may be too slow in coming.
   In addition to existing competition from exchanges in London and
Tokyo, the report said, Swiss, German and French exchanges ``are
making vigorous efforts to increase their volume, automate their
activities and modernize their regulatory regimes'' by 1992 when
Common Market trade barriers are eliminated.
   ``While U.S. futures exchanges and our over-the-counter market
are acting aggresively to put worldwide electronic networks in
place, the U.S. stock exchanges have been slower to act,'' read the
106-page report, ``Trading Around the Clock: Global Securities
Markets and Information Technology.''
   Officials at the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock
Exchange said they hadn't seen the report and thus, could not
comment.
   The report said Congress needs to address how to combine
international cooperative efforts to achieve regulatory harmony
while keeping the United States competitive.
   ``U.S. stock exchanges are so far slow to show any interest in
adopting automated trading systems that bypass or compete with
traditional dealer intermediaries or that operate around the
clock,'' the report concluded.
   Vary T. Coates, project director of the study, said the report
stated that as international securities trading increases Congress
should look at both whether American markets are competitive
globally and what are the addititional risks to American investors.
   ``And on the first point about being competitive, although we
say that our markets are the fairest and most liquid and most
efficient in the world, probably, they are not very well positioned
yet for international trading,'' Ms. Coates said.
   ``They've been slow to move in that direction _ at least the
exchanges are.''
   While the New York Stock Exchange announced plans last month to
begin limited after-hours trading next year, Ms. Coates said the
study found 24-hour trading ``won't be ready for 10 years and we
think (globalization) is going to move a lot faster than that.''
   The OTA acknowledged the report was the first _ and least
controversial _ section of a two-part report on technology in the
securities markets.
   The second part is expected to be released in the fall when
Congress is expected to conduct hearings on the matter.
   In January, a draft version was sent back to the drawing board
after some sharp criticism by a blue-ribbon advisory panel.
   The earlier study described the specialist trading system at the
New York and American stock exchanges as ``faltering'' and possibly
``irredeemably obsolete.''
   Under the specialist system of trading, stock can only be traded
through certain designated exchange members that are charged with
maintaining an orderly market in that security _ even if it means
buying or selling the stock because no other takers can be found.

$8,333 each from the financially ailing Manville trust, the first
installment of compensation for their father's 1986 lung cancer
death.
   But a federal judge in Brooklyn on Monday formally halted
payments pending a restructuring of the trust, which was created as
part of Manville Corp.'s 1988 bankruptcy reorganization but has run
out of money to pay new claims.
   The move at least temporarily delays payments to potentially
hundreds of people who have settled their cases and are awaiting
payments.
   In addition, another federal judge on Monday ordered more than
100,000 lawsuits involving asbestos nationwide lumped into a class
action to ease a backlog of cases and speed payments to victims.
   Some victims and their families already have been waiting for up
to a decade for compensation. The Manville trust, which has 130,000
claims pending, announced recently that some new claims would not
be paid until the year 2025 or later. Average payments to date have
been about $43,000, much higher than the $25,000 expected initially.
   Attorneys for plaintiffs and asbestos manufacturers agree that
steps are needed to get people money and reduce litigation costs.
But they doubt the initial plan presented by Thomas D. Lambros,
chief judge of U.S. District Court in Cleveland, to create a class
action can survive.
   ``I think a lot of the individual needs, the individual
strengths, the inidividual weaknesses are lost in the mixture,''
said Richard Glasser, a Norfolk, Va., attorney representing 1,100
shipyard workers.
   To create a class, the judge must show that all defendants lack
the money to pay claims, which attorneys said will be difficult to
prove. In addition, the federal Anti-Injunction Act prevents a
federal court from interfering with a state court. About half of
the asbestos docket is in state courts.
   ``The legal barriers presently are insuperable,'' said Andrew
Berry, a Newark, N.J., lawyer representing several asbestos
defendants.
   At issue is a flaky, white mineral used widely and without
safeguards in shipbuilding, construction and other industries from
the turn of the century. Asbestos since then has been determined to
cause lung cancer and other often-fatal diseases.
   Product liability lawsuits have driven Manville and several
other asbestos manufacturers into bankruptcy court protection. Now,
more than 100,000 lawsuits are on file in every federal court and
some 500 state courts, and the tide of filings shows no signs of
abating.
   Judges would like to simplify the method by which attorneys
investigate individual claims, reduce delays by defendant companies
that claim they can't afford to pay asbestos settlements and limit
money being spent on litigation rather than compensation.
   ``The amount of money being expended on defense costs is
enormous and the amount of money that's going to plaintiffs lawyers
by way of contingency fees also is enormous,'' said Lawrence
Fitzpatrick, president of the Center for Claims Resolution, a
Princeton, N.J., consortium of 20 asbestos defendants that has
resolved 36,000 claims in 18 months.
   A class action most likely would force both sides to sit down
and reach a settlement for all victims creating a single pool from
which to divvy up claims.
   That would require defendant companies to quit stalling
settlements and avoid payments, as some lawyers charge they have
done. In turn, plaintiffs lawyers could reap a smaller percentage
of individual settlements and quit filing claims for people not
injured by asbestos.
   But the asbestos litigation may defy a class action because of
its complex nature.
   Other large product liability settlements, such as those for the
Vietnam-era chemical Agent Orange and A.H. Robins Co.'s faulty
Dalkon Shield birth-control device, involved just one product with
a limited time exposure and consistent injuries.
   But about 40 separate companies made asbestos, using it in
differing amounts in widely divergent products. About a dozen
diseases stem from exposure, with effects ranging from negligible
to death, and symptoms have not even begun to show up for many who
were exposed. Also, asbestos was used in countless projects in
varying industries across the country for decades.
   ``The issues, the exposure, the disease mixes are so different
in every part of the country that I think it defies a nationwide
resolution by class,'' said Richard Scruggs, a Pascagoula, Miss.,
lawyer representing 4,000 former Mississippi shipyard workers.
   But lawyers said dividing the case into sub-classes organized by
region, or applying a standard for conducting legal investigations
in each case might work in a class action. Judge Lambros' order
left open such steps.

   Attorneys representing more than 1,100 asbestos
victims from Virginia have asked a federal appeals court to
overturn a temporary halt in payments from the Manville trust.
   The move Tuesday came a day after U.S. District Judge Jack B.
Weinstein formally stopped disbursements until a plan is drawn up
to overhaul the financially ailing trust, which was created to
compensate thousands of victims of asbestos-related disease.
   But lawyers for former shipyard workers in Virginia said they
have settled claims for more than $60 million and don't want the
money held up by Weinstein's order.
   The individual settlements range from $12,000 to $200,000 and
primarily involve workers from the Newport News, Va., and Norfolk,
Va., shipyards exposed to asbestos from the 1940s through the
1970s. The settlements were reached with the trust in federal court
in the eastern district of Virginia.
   ``The judgments are going to people who have lost a loved one
due to asbestos ... those who are literally dying as we speak and
those who are suffering with various stages of disability,'' said
Richard Glasser, a Norfolk attorney representing the workers.
   ``They are entitled to their funds,'' he said. ``Our court has
overseen the process. We do not feel another court in another
jurisdiction should be authorized to upset the work that has been
done.''
   Weinstein announced the order last week and formally signed it
on Monday to preserve the trust's assets as a reorganization
proposal is prepared. The stay is due to expire Aug. 6.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals scheduled a hearing on the
matter, but not until the week of Aug. 13. However, Glasser said he
believed the appeals court may expect Weinstein to extend the
payments halt.
   The payment stoppage placed in limbo potentially hundreds of
claims that already have been settled but not actually paid.
Manville recently reported it had settled $112.8 million in claims
but has only $93.2 million to pay out.
   The appeals court motion also challenges Weinstein's authority
to order a reorganization of the trust, saying that ``even if the
trust does ultimately run short of current funds, that is a
consequence of the design of the plan.''
   Under Weinstein's order, the trust still can pay victims who
show they would not survive more than six months without treatment
and relatives who can demonstrate hardship.
   The trust, created as part of Manville Corp.'s 1988 bankruptcy
reorganization, is out of money to pay new claims. The trust, based
in Washington, has 130,000 claims outstanding but does not expect a
new infusion of cash until late 1991.
   Weinstein is involved in the matter because he is supervising
571 asbestos cases involving workers from the old Brooklyn Navy
Yard.

<HEAD>Congress, Bush Head for Veto Showdown Over Bill to Limit Textile
Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress and President Bush appear headed
toward a veto showdown over rapidly rising textile imports that
displace hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs but, some say, also
hold clothing prices down.
   Reopening a six-year battle that Congress lost twice to
then-President Reagan, the Senate voted 68-32 Tuesday to limit
increases in textile, clothing and footwear imports to 1 percent a
year. That vote would be more than enough to override a
presidential veto.
   Supporters said the bill is needed to halt the past decade's
loss of about 400,000 American jobs and the closing of more than
1,500 U.S. plants in the three industries.
   Since 1980, the import share of the U.S. textile and clothing
market has climbed from 28 percent to 60 percent. Imported shoes
now account for four of every five pairs sold here, up from their
one-half share of that market five years ago. Last year alone,
clothing imports climbed by 12 percent.
   ``Extrapolate that through the 1990s and by the year 2,000,
rather than the loss of 60 percent, we will have the loss of 92
percent and the textile industry will be gone,'' said Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., the bill's chief sponsor.
   Opponents contended the bill would raise the price of shoes and
clothing to U.S. consumers by $25 billion to $27 billion a year.
   ``You do not notice it much,'' said Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.
``Just 50 cents a shirt here; a dollar ... two dollars a pair of
shoes there. But add that up by 250 million consumers in this
country; that is a lot of money.''
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., made an unsuccessful appeal to Bush
on Tuesday to disavow the administration's promise to veto the bill.
   ``I can't do that,'' Bush replied. ``I can't say that I think
the answer to the problem of textiles is further protection.''
   Administration officials have vehemently opposed the bill,
saying it would derail their efforts under the Uruguay Round of
talks on the 100-nation General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade to
reduce foreign barriers to U.S. exports of farm products, computers
and services such as banking.
   Critics, however, said they fear the talks will produce only a
further erosion of the U.S. textile industry under the guise of
free trade.
   ``I think of Will Rogers every time I think about GATT,'' said
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. ``Will Rogers said _ and of course that
was before Vietnam _ that the United States has never lost a war or
won a negotiation. And that just about sizes it up.''
   A sustained presidential veto on the bill could pose significant
political damage to Helms, who faces a tough re-election battle
this November in North Carolina, the nation's largest
textile-producing state. Reagan's veto of a similar bill in 1985
was widely credited with helping Democrat Terry Sanford unseat
then-Republican Sen. James Broyhill of North Carolina in 1986.
   This year's bill, virtually identical to ones Reagan vetoed in
1985 and again in 1988, still faces a rough road in the House.
   Although similar legislation there enjoys the sponsorship of 243
of the House's 433 members, it is opposed by Rep. Sam Gibbons,
R-Fla., chairman of the Ways and Means Committee's trade
subcommittee.
   Supporters of the bill said they doubt it will re-emerge until
after Congress returns from its August recess, when the plan is to
bring the Senate bill directly to the House floor and bypass
Gibbons' subcommittee.
   In 1988, House supporters fell 11 votes short of overriding
Reagan's veto. The Senate that year passed by the bill by only a
59-36 margin, well short of the two-thirds needed for an override.
   This year, bill supporters picked up backing from several farm
state lawmakers by including a provision to raise quotas beyond the
1 percent growth restrictions on foreign textile and apparel
producers who increase their imports of U.S. farm products.

<TEXT>
   Field Publications, the educational
publishing company that puts out the Weekly Reader and the Funk &amp;
Wagnalls encyclopedia, may be changing hands.
   Bruce Seide, president of Field Publications, said Tuesday that
the company's parent, Field Corp. of Chicago, is searching for
buyers for the Middletown-based firm.
   The firm employs 300 people at its Middletown headquarters, 60
at its Funk &amp; Wagnalls affiliate in Ramsey, N.J., and another 600
at its distribution center in Columbus, Ohio.
   Seide said Field Corp. has retained the investment banking firm
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. to negotiate with potential buyers.
   ``There are any number of publishing and direct marketing
organizations who are looking for the possible opportunity for
growth or synergy with their own companies,'' he said. ``We will
evaluate all of them initially and should have the group narrowed
down in a few weeks.''
   The privately held company publishes and sells a variety of
publications to schools, students and individuals. Its principal
products are book clubs for children and adults and the Weekly
Reader, a 61-year-old classroom newspaper read by more than 10
million schoolchildren.
   The sale of the company would be its fourth.
   Founded in Ohio in 1902, it was known as American Education
Publications in 1949 when it was bought by Wesleyan University for
$8.2 million.
   Wesleyan brought the company's editorial offices to Middletown
in 1952, and sold the company to Xerox in 1965, reportedly for
between $54 million and $56 million.
   Xerox, seeking cash to expand its office systems and financial
research units, sold its educational publishing unit to Field Corp.
in August 1985.
   In 1988, Field Corp. expanded into the encyclopedia market by
purchasing New Jersey-based Funk &amp; Wagnalls Inc., which sells
reference books through supermarkets.
   Seide said Field Publications' revenues were about $300 million
in 1989 and were expected to be about the same in 1990.
   Field Corp., founded in 1984 by Marshall Field V, also owns
Seattle-based Muzak and Manistique Papers, a newsprint manufacturer
based in Manistique, Mich.
   The Field family sold its interest in the Chicago-based Marshall
Field's department stores in the 1960s.

<HEAD>Money Complicates Efforts to End European Farm Export Subsidies</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS to EEP from EEB throughout. This also moved on
general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is keeping the pressure on
the European Economic Community to negotiate an end to export
subsidies, but Agriculture Department officials say money may
become a problem.
   One of the favored weapons in the U.S. trade arsenal is the
5-year-old Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, which provides
``bonuses'' or subsidies to make U.S. commodities cheaper for
selected foreign buyers.
   But Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Tuesday the U.S.
subsidy program is modest compared with the $10 billion annually
spent by the 12-nation European trade bloc on farm export subsidies.
   Further, he said, the House Appropriations Committee recently
cut the subsidies under EEP to $500 million from the $900 million
the administration had requested for the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1.
   Yeutter said export subsidies are ``probably the most important
part'' of the ongoing trade negotiations under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
   The 97-member GATT is scheduled to conclude the current Uruguay
Round of talks by the end of this year.
   Despite a possible cutback in EEP funding, Yeutter said he is
optimistic the trade talks will conclude favorably. Many in Europe
are beginning to view export subsidies as to large a financial
burden, he said.
   ``If we can have a successful negotiation on export subsidies, a
lot of countries around the world will benefit, including the
United States,'' Yeutter said in a telephone news conference with
farm broadcasters.
   Undersecretary Richard T. Crowder, who directly oversees
international and commodity programs in the Agriculture Department,
said EEP programs are ``in place for all the major targeted
customers and markets'' of American farmers.
   Crowder said the subsidy programs serve a dual purpose: for
achieving and maintaining a market share for U.S. agricultural
exports, and ``for the trade policy effect that it will have on the
(Europeans), particularly as we enter the critical phase'' of the
trade talks.
   ``So, we are prepared to use EEP as aggressively as possible to
ensure our competitiveness in the world market against those $10
billion of export subsidies,'' he said.
   Yeutter, asked if European community policies had changed as a
result of trading pressure over the years, said there has been
``very little'' so far.
   ``They have been bringing their (domestic) price support levels
down in a modest way over the last two or three years, but not
enough to have very much effect on production thus far,'' he said.
   ``We've been pointing out to them they need to bring those
stratospheric supports down much closer to world market prices.''
   The high supports stimulate production, and the surpluses are
dumped on the world market through European community export
subsidies, Yeutter added.
   The agriculture secretary was asked if the United States had
backed off at last week's economic summit in Houston from an
earlier position calling for the elimination of export subsidies.
Now, the questioner said, it appears the United States would settle
for a reduction.
   ``We have by no means altered the U.S. position,'' Yeutter
replied. ``We did not have to change it one iota in Houston.''
   The key language used in the Houston agreement was worked out a
year or so ago and remained unchanged, he said. It calls for a
``substantial, progressive reduction'' in subsidies.
   ``We believe that calls for ultimate elimination,'' Yeutter
said. ``The (European community) knows that's our interpretation.''
   But how long that might require is another matter, he said. The
United States has proposed a five-year phaseout of export
subsidies, but the (European community) ``objects vigorously'' to
that timetable, Yeutter said.

   A suggestion by Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter that the 1990 farm bill be delayed until negotiators finish
working on overall federal budget cuts is being met with harsh
criticism in Congress.
   ``The administration is hiding behind the budget and trying to
kill the farm bill,'' Sen Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the
Senate Agriculture Department, said Tuesday.
   ``Since the budget summit may take months to complete, the
administration's proposal sets the stage for a one-year farm bill
extension, so that American farm policy would be written in
Geneva'' at international trade talks, he said.
   Leahy said the administration was ``conspicuously absent'' from
the negotiations in Congress that led to the draft of the farm bill
set to go to the Senate floor this week.
   ``Now that every member of the Agriculture Committee has voted
on the farm bill, the administration still wants to duck and delay
action for the indefinite future,'' said Leahy.
   Yeutter said he was not trying to delay the farm bill to enhance
the U.S. negotiating position at the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade talks in Geneva.
   ``That's nonsense,'' he said. ``Whether we have a one-, three-or
five-year farm bill is fundamentally irrelevant to the GATT
process.''
   Yeutter said his suggestion was based strictly on budget
considerations.
   ``We have no idea what we will be able to spend over the next
five years,'' he told reporters Tuesday. ``It's totally up in the
air because we still do not have a budget agreement with Congress.''
   Yeutter said delaying the farm bill would be the ``most
propitious way to handle the matter.''
   Otherwise, Congress might have to write two farm bills, he said,
indicating that the eventual agreement reached on the overall
federal budget might require changes in farm programs not
anticipated in the pending legislation.
   He said he has not asked any members of Congress directly to
delay farm bill action, however.
   Senate leaders have said they would like to begin floor debate
on the bill this week, probably Thursday. In the House, the Rules
Committee meets that day to determine the procedures that will be
used during House debate, which could begin next week.
   Meanwhile, budget negotiators who have been working since
mid-May have indicated little significant progress toward reaching
an agreement. Some have suggested that Congress will have to return
after the November election to get a budget passed.

<HEAD>Report Says IBM Considering Sale Of Low-Tech Businesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. is
considering selling its low-technology businesses, which include
former mainstays like electric typewriters and keyboards, according
to a report published today.
   The businesses could fetch around $3 billion through a proposed
leveraged buyout, the Wall Street Journal said, quoting
unidentified Wall Street and industry executives.
   IBM already has been negotiating with a potential buyer and a
deal could be worked out by the end of the month, the newspaper
said.
   In a statement issued today from its Armonk, N.Y., headquarters,
the world's largest computer company said it ``has not concluded
any transaction like the one speculated on ...''
   ``IBM is in the process of considering many options as it moves
to sharpen its strategic focus and remain on the leading edge of
the information processing business.''
   The computer giant added that any future action taken would not
disrupt its ``full-employment policy.''
   IBM has a tradition of no layoffs. When it sold businesses in
the past, it has tried to allay employee fears of job losses.
   Buyouts, however, are often followed by layoffs to cut costs and
help the acquirer repay the debt used in the purchase.
   IBM has been paring its operations and payroll since the mid
1980s, when growth in the computer industry began to slow. In
December, IBM announced another round of employee reductions
through early retirement programs.
   The company also has been looking for ways to get out of
businesses considered marginal since the proliferation of desktop
computers and other word processing systems in the 1980s.
   The executives quoted anonymously by the Journal said IBM has
admitted it simply cannot make some of these low-margin items as
inexpensively as its competitors.
   Besides typewriters and keyboards, IBM also could sell its
low-end computer printer line, all three of which are produced at
IBM's recently modernized Lexington, Ky., plant, the executives
said.
   Earlier this week, IBM reported that its second-quarter profit
rose 5 percent to $1.41 billion over a year ago as revenue grew by
8 percent to $16.5 billion.

   The stock market declined broadly today, faced
with renewed worries about inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 12.37 to
2,987.38 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 3 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 232 up, 783
down and 476 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.40 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Before the market opened the Labor Department reported that the
consumer price index rose 0.5 percent in June, surpassing many
estimates by brokerage-firm economists.
   The news raised new worries about the choices facing the Federal
Reserve, which has taken steps in the past week to relax its credit
policy.
   Greater-than-expected inflationary pressures would stand to
restrict the Fed's options in its efforts to keep the economy
growing and cushion it from the effects of a squeeze on the
availability of bank credit.
   Interest rates climbed in the credit markets following the CPI
report, and the Dow Jones industrial average pulled back from the
verge of the 3,000 level, which it had briefly crossed in each of
the past three sessions.
   Philip Morris led the active list, down &lsqb; at 50&rsqb;. The company
reported higher second-quarter earnings, but some traders seemed
intent on cashing in on the stock's recent gains.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.08 to 199.41. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.67 at 363.72.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 2,999.75,
unchanged from Monday.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 643 up, 877 down and
519 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 176.79 million shares, up from 149.43
million Monday.

   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. on Wednesday posted a
21 percent jump in its second quarter earnings as strength in
pharmaceuticals pushed companywide sales to a record level.
   The company earned $417 million, or 79 cents a share, in the
three months ended June 30, up from $345 million, or 66 cents a

   Quarterly sales rose 11 percent to $2.5 billion from $2.2

   Richard L. Gelb, chairman and chief executive officer of the New
York-based drug and consumer products company, said growth in its
pharmaceutical business was particularly strong during the quarter.
   He said exchange rate fluctuations had a favorable effect on
sales of about 1 percent for the quarter.
   By midyear, Bristol-Myers earned $826 million, or $1.57 a share,
up 20 percent from $689 million, or $1.32 a share, in the first
half of 1989. Half-year sales grew 10 percent to $4.9 billion from
$4.5 billion.

   MCI Communications Corp., the nation's

   The company said it earned $170 million, or 67 cents a share, in
the quarter ended June 30, up from $142 million, or 56 cents per
share, in 1989's second quarter.
   Revenue totaled $1.9 billion, up from $1.6 billion a year
earlier.
   The report contrasts sharply with that issued Tuesday by United
Telecommunications Inc., majority owner of US Sprint, the
third-largest long-distance carrier.
   United Telecom reported a 55 percent drop in second-quarter
earnings. It also said it would eliminate 1,000 jobs nationwide and
that it had postponed its purchase of GTE Corp.'s 20 percent stake
in Sprint.
   The news sent United Telecom's shares sliding on the New York
Stock Exchange to close at $29.50, down $8.75. It was the
exchange's most-active issue.
   Analysts said the company wasn't achieving the revenue growth
needed to keep pace with costs.
   MCI, meanwhile, attributed its growth to gains in both
residential and corporate accounts.
   ``These positive results, coupled with our progress in ensuring
the company's growth in such key areas as the general business
market, clearly demonstrates MCI's ability to return value to
stockholders while investing for the future,'' said Bert C. Roberts
Jr., president and chief operating officer, in a statement.
   The growth was led by the success of the Premier Calling Plans,
which allow residential customers to buy long distance service by
the hour, rather than the distance of the call, the company said.
   During the quarter, Washington-based MCI also won its largest
pay phone contract to date _ a $375 million contract to provide
operator and pay phone services at U.S. Navy, Marine Corps and
Coast Guard sites in the U.S., Hawaii and Puerto Rico.
   The company's planned merger with Telecom USA, the nation's
fourth-largest long-distance carrier, was approved the Telecom
stockholders on June 29. State and federal regulators still need to
approve the deal, MCI said.
   In May, MCI said it would begin issuing its first dividends on
common stock, 5 cents a share twice a year.

<HEAD>General Dynamics Reports Big Loss, McDonnell Douglas Improves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Dynamics Corp. today reported a $240
million, or $5.75 a share, loss for the second quarter because of
half a billion dollars worth of cost overruns in two defense
programs.
   The $500 million charge included $450 million of estimated
higher costs for the A-12 aircraft program for the Navy and $50
million in higher costs for the SINCGARS radio contract for the
Army.
   The quarterly loss for the nation's second largest defense
contractor compared with a profit of $58.4 million, or $1.39 a
share, for the same period a year ago.
   Sales for the quarter, which ended June 30, were up slightly at
$2.6 billion compared with $2.5 billion.
   Meanwhile, the nation's largest defense contractor, McDonnell
Douglas Corp., reported a profit of $57 million, or $1.49 a share,
for the second quarter. That compares with a loss of $48 million,
or $1.25 a share for the same period last year.
   The good news comes in the wake of Monday's announcement that
the company was planning to cut its work force by up to 11 percent
this year and trim other expenses in an effort to save $700 million.
   Sales for the quarter were $4.12 billion compared with $3.37
billion in last year's second quarter.
   Both McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics worked together on
the Navy's A-12 program, but apparently when it came to estimating
costs they parted ways.
   While General Dynamics took a big loss for the program,
McDonnell Douglas didn't report any cost overruns and said General
Dynamics was being too cautious in its estimate.

<HEAD>Toyota Asks Suppliers to Streamline Parts to Save Fuel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp. has asked its suppliers to
streamline the parts they sell Toyota to improve the fuel
efficiency of its automobiles, a company official said Wednesday.
   The move was taken partly in response to pressure by a bill
presented to the U.S. Senate that will require auto manufacturers
to improve the gas efficiency of their vehicles by 40 percent
within 10 years.
   Toyota asked its subcontractors, who provide roughly 70 percent
of the parts used in its vehicles, to reduce the weight of their
products by at least 10 percent, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The company will not switch immediately to using lighter
materials, such as aluminum, because of their cost, but will try to
improve existing designs, he said.
   Toyota will consider switching to aluminum, however, if the
United States passes the Bryan bill, which requires auto
manufacturers to raise their fuel efficiency by 20 percent before
1995 and by 40 percent before 2001.
   Japanese automakers have opposed the legislation. They say
increasing efficiency will be much more difficult for them than for
American manufacturers because they are already highly efficient.
   But the Toyota official said the company's request to its
suppliers was not just a response to the American threat.
   ``Whether or not the Bryan bill is passed, Toyota intends to
make its cars compatible with the environment,'' he said.
   Toyota's request to lighten parts is typical of its relations
with its more than 100 subsidiaries and affiliated suppliers. It
often applies pressure on the smaller companies to cut prices and
improve quality.
   Such pressure on parts suppliers has been criticized as a reason
for hasty production and a spate of defects in recent Japanese
cars, but Toyota has said it will provide all possible assistance
to help its suppliers make the necessary changes.
   Other Japanese car manufacturers including Nissan Motor Co. have
also asked their affiliated parts suppliers to trim parts as a way
to improve efficiency.

<HEAD>Fast-Talking Auctioneer Finds Profits In S&amp;L Collapse</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The worst of times could be the best of times for
Jim Gall and his auctioneers.
   With the nation's savings and loan system in shambles and
regulators anxious to unload seized assets, Gall says his
11-year-old auction house is poised for profits and fame.
   ``I'm as upset about the S&amp;L crisis as anyone. We're all in for
thousands of dollars per person for the bailout,'' said Gall,
chairman of Miami-based Auction Co. of America. ``But around here,
we couldn't be busier.''
   Gall _ part savvy executive, part slick showman _ is striving to
become the principal gavel-basher for the Resolution Trust Corp.,
the agency established last year to dispose of insolvent thrifts.
It appears his quest is paying off.
   Last month in Miami, Gall raked in more than $300,000 for the
RTC in an auction of dinnerware and other luxury items from the
failed CenTrust Savings Bank. More than 1,000 bidders filled a
marble hall in the CenTrust tower to compete for items such as a
rare book collection and the personal mahogany humidor of ousted
CenTrust chairman David Paul.
   Gall's next big RTC auction appearance is planned for early fall
when he will bring about $300 million in commercial properties to
the block. Bidders from around the nation and in Tokyo and London
will participate via a special satellite hookup.
   With auction company commissions ranging between 5 percent and
10 percent, Gall's firm stands to make millions off the real estate
sale _ billed by Gall as ``the largest auction in the history of
the world.'' He said he plans to ask for recognition in the
``Guinness Book of World Records.''
   ``Yeah, but we also look at it as the taxpayers gain as well,''
he said. ``The better price we get for the properties, the less the
taxpayers' burden for the bailout.''
   During a recent interview in Gall's office, the telephone rang.
It was the RTC calling from Washington. Gall slumped into his
leather chair.
   ``Today?'' he asked, gazing out at a 23rd-floor view of the
Atlantic Ocean. ``All right, we'll be ready.''
   Gall put down the receiver and winced. The RTC was preparing to
release a list of the 100 to 125 properties in the fall auction and
wanted to use Auction Co. of America as a contact number for the
press.
   ``This kind of took me by surprise. We don't even have a special
phone ready,'' he said. ``But, hey, life's full of surprises.''
   Gall, 44, is no stranger to the unexpected. He and the company's
senior vice president arrived unannounced in Washington last year.
They were loaded down with 50-page information packets designed to
persuade congressmen to include auctions in S&amp;L bailout legislation.
   But few lawmakers took interest in the pair, who would show up
in offices without appointments and ambush congressional aides.
Finally, they gave up and dumped the folders.
   ``Besides, they weighed too much,'' said Gall.
   Before they left town, they typed a one-page position paper that
caught the attention of U.S. Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., who
sponsored a successful auction amendment.
   The RTC will watch the response to the fall auction before
deciding whether to use Gall or other companies for future
nationwide auctions, said agency spokeswoman Nancy Schertzing.
   ``I would not doubt it if we see other auctions,'' she said.
``We're still taking assets under RTC control.''
   As of mid-July, the RTC had 247 thrifts under conservatorship
and had sold or liquidated 209 others, she said.
   ``This S&amp;L crisis has turned out to be a wonderful opportunity
for the auction industry,'' said Ann Wood, executive vice president
of the 740-member Certified Auctioneers Institute in Overland Park,
Kan. ``It's showing the nation that auctions are a way to dispose
of property quickly and efficiently ... People are learning there's
more to being an auctioneer than just being able to talk fast.''
   But Gall talks fast, anyway. A paper sign in his office reads:
Do It Now.
   In the early 1970s, he peddled office furniture and novelties
such as key chains before his first taste _ or whiff _ of the big
time.
   Working with special highly concentrated oils developed by
Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co., Gall and his sister developed
scratch-and-sniff T-shirts in a Miami kitchen in 1976.
   The T-shirts _ a short-lived fad _ had a moment of national fame
when former ABC sportscaster Alex Karras donned one during a
``Monday Night Football'' broadcast from Miami. Gall had tracked
down the broadcast's co-anchor Howard Cosell earlier in the day to
give him the shirt.
   ``The T-shirts went up then down and out of sight,'' said Gall.
``But it taught me how to do national and international marketing.
It taught me how to think big.''
   In 1979, Gall began classes at a Kansas City, Mo.-based
auctioneer school. ``I found my niche,'' he said.
   He returned to Miami and began looking for clients. Within a few
years, he was holding estate auctions at some of Palm Beach's most
exclusive addresses.
   More recently, Gall won the right to auction the contents of
Nelson Bunker Hunt's ranch outside Dallas in one of the nation's
largest personal bankruptcy liquidations.
   Gall does not discuss the company's finances, but he noted that
during one week this July he auctioned more than $10 million in
property. The itinerary: a marina in Davenport, Iowa; 85
foreclosures in Louisiana; townhouses in New York; 103 condominiums
at Waterville Valley, N.H., then more townhouses in Atlanta.
   ``Of course, all weeks are not that good,'' he said. ``But
considering what the RTC holds, that's nothing.''

   The stock market lapsed into a broad decline
today, retreating from record highs amid renewed worries about
inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 14.11 to
2,985.64 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 3 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 317 up, 959
down and 505 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 58.92 million shares at
midmorning.
   Before the market opened the Labor Department reported that the
consumer price index rose 0.5 percent in June, surpassing many
estimates by brokerage-firm economists.
   The news raised new worries about the choices facing the Federal
Reserve, which has taken steps in the past week to relax its credit
policy.
   Greater-than-expected inflationary pressures would stand to
restrict the Fed's options in its efforts to keep the economy
growing and cushion it from the effects of a squeeze on the
availability of bank credit.
   Interest rates climbed in the credit markets following the CPI
report, and the Dow Jones industrial average pulled back from the
verge of the 3,000 level, which it had briefly crossed in each of
the past three sessions.
   Recent standout performers hit by profit-taking today included
Wal-Mart Stores, down } at 34}; Waste Management, down 2{ at 43,
and Eli Lilly, down 3\ at 85|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.49 to 199.00. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.09 at 362.30.

   A ceremonial handshake today on the fifth floor
of the massive General Motors Corp. building began a process that
some observers predict may end in a strike of at least one Big
Three automaker this September.
   Negotiations between the giant automaker and the United Auto
Workers union for a new national labor contract got under way
following a 10-minute photo opportunity in which negotiators
reached across a table to shake hands.
   UAW talks with Ford Motor Co. begin Thursday, with Chrysler
Corp. negotiations to open Friday. The three contracts expire at
midnight Sept. 14.
   As negotiators smiled inside, about 2,000 demonstrators gathered
outside to demand increased cost-of-living allowances for UAW
retirees. Union leaders earlier rejected an effort to make COLA a
key issue of the talks.
   The demonstrators today chanted ``Millions for Roger; peanuts
for us,'' referring to Chairman Roger Smith's hefty retirement plan.
   No single issue in the talks is seen as likely to bring a
strike. But union anger remains from the last talks at GM and
Chrysler during which the UAW thought it had won broad job security.
   The two automakers have combined to close six assembly plants
and lay off 17,000 workers since the contracts were signed in 1987
at GM and 1988 at Chrysler. Both used a clause that allowed plant
closings only because of slow sales of the products made there.
   The union's top priority again is protecting current jobs of the
more than 450,000 Big Three workers it represents.
   The companies' top goal is getting the union to agree to
flexibility in how vehicles are built.
   Analyst Ron Glantz of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in San Francisco
calls a strike against GM likely.
   ``The odds of a strike are probably the highest that they've
been in 20 years,'' said analyst John Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody &amp;
Co. of New York. The last general strike against one of the Big
Three was a 12-day stoppage in 1985 against Chrysler.
   ``I think it's a key set of talks. It will likely shape labor
relations in the auto industry for the '90s,'' said labor analyst
Harley Shaiken of the University of California at San Diego. ``I
think it is taking place against a backdrop of an industry that has
gone through some very large structural changes.''
   During the 1980s, the Big Three rode a financial roller coaster.
In 1981, the companies lost a combined $1.2 billion. In 1988, the
combined earnings were a record $11.2 billion.
   The turnaround came partly because of surging car and truck
sales and largely because of cost-cutting and plant closings.
   ``The corporations, in the union's view, have a credibility
problem going into the talks,'' Shaiken said. ``There will likely
be a lot of watching of the fine print in the job security this
time around.
   Auto industry observers are split over which company the union
is likely to choose as a target for setting a model contract for
the other two.
   ``We still think the odds greatly favor Ford being the target,''
Kirnan said. ``I think the UAW knows full well that as far as job
security is concerned, Ford is in the best position to grant that.''
   Shaiken said the union's strategic needs and internal politics
point to GM.
   UAW Vice President Stephen Yokich, seen as the likely successor
to union President Owen Bieber in the mid-1990s, will lead his
first set of negotiations as director of the UAW's huge GM
Department. He led the negotiating effort in 1987 when the union
targeted Ford.
   Ernest Lofton was chosen a year ago to succeed Yokich as head of
the union's Ford Department. He has served on national bargaining
committees before, but has never led in negotiations.
   The Aug. 1 promotion of GM President Robert Stempel to succeed
Smith could spare GM a strike. Call it a honeymoon.
   ``It would not be the way he would want to start his tenure,''
Shaiken said. ``There would be some motivation to start it without
a strike.''

<HEAD>FAA Audit Turned Up 21 Violations at Boeing's Everett Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal inspectors found 21 violations of
FAA-approved quality assurance procedures in an audit of The Boeing
Co.'s production plant in Everett, Wash., last year, records show.
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Dave Duff said none of
the violations posed a safety risk to the flying public. Boeing,
which has been under the gun to deliver airplanes, said all the
violations have been corrected.
   Details of the violations were reported today by the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer. The FAA, responding to a Freedom of Information
Act request, made available to the newspaper part of a ``Quality
Assurance Systems Analysis Review'' it conducted at the plant in
February 1989.
   The Everett plant is where Boeing makes its widebody 767 and 747
jetliners.
   Inspectors said violations included failure to:
   _Check approved engineering drawings in the manufacture and
inspection of parts.
   _Use proper methods and tools to cut composite and titanium
parts.
   _Document and check reworked parts.
   _Use the proper torque to tighten tubes and latches.
   _Document parts used in areas for which they were not originally
intended.
   The report also said workers were not properly protected from
airborne dust while drilling holes in graphite composites.
   ``All area personnel are completely unaware of the safety
consideration of cutting and drilling advanced composites,'' the
report said. ``Great amounts of cutting and countersinking are
being conducted without vacuums or the wearing of respirators.''
   A report of a similar January 1989 inspection done at Boeing's
Renton facility, where 737 and 757s are manufactured, documented
five similar violations, the Post-Intelligencer said.
   Boeing, which is now producing a record 34 airplanes a month,
said the problems have been fixed.
   ``We have corrected all the items in that audit to the
satisfaction of the FAA,'' said spokeswoman Elizabeth Reese. ``For
a facility like Everett, 21 (violations) was not a bad number, but
it's not something you want to rest on.''
   FAA officials in Seattle who oversaw the audits declined to be
interviewed, the newspaper said.
   Duff said the FAA did not fine Boeing, as it had in the past.
Between 1985 and 1989, Boeing paid 14 fines to the FAA totaling
$245,000 for quality control violations found in previous
inspections, which are done every 18 to 36 months.
   ``In the past we relied on legal enforcements as the primary
action after the quality assurance review,'' Duff said.
   But under the philosophy of FAA Administrator James Busey, who
was appointed by President Bush last year, ``there is less emphasis
on time- and manpower-consuming legal proceedings and more on
assuring compliance,'' Duff added. ``Enforcement is now the last
resort to ensure compliance.''

<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan sent a
strong signal today that the central bank will act decisively to
keep the country out of a recession by lowering interest rates once
policy-makers agree on a deficit-reduction package.
   In his strongest comments to date, Greenspan sought to reassure
members of Congress that the Fed will do its part in any effort to
significantly attack the huge federal budget deficit.
   Many Republican critics of tax increases have charged that
President Bush's reversal on the tax question threatens to push the
country into a recession by increasing the tax burden at a time
when the economy is already growing at a sluggish rate.
   However, Greenspan, delivering the Fed's midyear economic report
today, said that ``a major cut in the budget is unquestionably the
right thing to do.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater welcomed
Greenspan's comments. ``Clearly we have said that one of the
reasons we need to get the deficit down is to take pressure off
interest rates and to help bring them down,'' he said.
   ``Certainly, that's the direction we'd like to see,'' said
Fitzwater. He also said it was ``helpful just in knowing that
others see the goal of this process the same as we do, which is to
get interest rates down and to keep the economy growing.''
   While Greenspan said that the specific details of any Fed
response to a deficit-reduction package would depend on the
performance of the economy at the time, he left no doubt that the
central bank would move to offset the adverse effects on growth
from government spending cuts and tax increases by lowering
interest rates.
   ``Major, substantive, credible cuts in the budget deficit would
present the Federal Reserve with a situation that would call for a
careful reconsideration of its policy,'' Greenspan said. ``I can
only offer the assurance that the Federal Reserve will act, as it
has in the past, to endeavor to keep the economic expansion on
track.''
   The administration on Monday dramatically boosted its estimate
of the size of the 1991 budget deficit to $168.8 billion, far above
the $64 billion deficit limit set by the Gramm-Rudman balanced
budget law.
   In presenting the new estimate, Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady and other administration officials said they were counting on
the Fed to do its part to lower interest rates. The administration
has been complaining for months that the Fed has kept interest
rates too high and thus slowing economic growth to dangerously low
levels.
   After keeping interest rates unchanged since last December, the
Fed took a modest step toward easing them last Friday. It supplied
enough additional cash to the banking system to push a key interest
rate, the federal funds rate, down from 8.25 percent to 8 percent.
   The rate fell further today, trading at 7 15-16 percent by
midday in the credit markets.
   The drop in the federal funds rate, which banks charge each
other for overnight loans, has helped push the stock market to
record highs as investors speculated that further rate declines
would be forthcoming. Stock prices largely were lower at midday
today, however.
   In his testimony today, Greenspan confirmed that the Fed had
eased slightly last week, saying the action was taken to offset the
effects of banks becoming overly cautious in making loans.
   Greenspan refused to characterize the developments as a
full-scale ``credit crunch,'' but he did say the tightness this
year was ``beginning to have very real, unwelcome effects'' on
economic growth.
   The Fed released its new estimates of economic growth this year,
indicating that the central bank is willing to tolerate slower
growth than the administration is counting on.
   The administration's revised economic forecast on Monday put
growth this year at 2.2 percent, as measured by the gross national
product, and 2.9 percent next year. But the Fed's new estimate
projected growth this year of between 1.5 percent and 2 percent and
put GNP growth in 1991 between 1.75 percent and 2.5 percent.
   The Fed also released new growth targets for the money supply
today, putting the most closely watched measure of the money supply
at growth of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent for 1991, slightly lower
than the previous target.
   Greenspan said this narrowing of the range for the money
aggregate known as M-2 did not indicate a desire to tighten down on
money growth, but rather reflected the fact that the money supply
has been growing more sluggishly this year.
   In assessing the economy, Greenspan said despite pockets of
weakness, it appeared that growth was continuing.
   ``On balance, the economy still appears to be growing, and the
likelihood of a near-term recession seems low, in part because
businesses have been working hard to keep their inventories in line
with sales trends,'' he said.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly

   William Biedermann, research director with the commodities
brokerage Allendale Inc. in Crystal Lake, Ill., said the lower
prices had stimulated foreign demand for U.S. grain.
   But forecasts for continued good growing weather in the Midwest
helped keep a lid on gains, resulting in two-sided trade and little
price movement.

   The chairman of the Federal Trade Commission
said today that health warnings on alcoholic beverage ads may help
curb alcohol abuse but that the agency was taking no stand on
whether they should be required by law.
   FTC Chairman Janet Steiger told a House panel that ``the
evidence is inconclusive'' whether beer, wine and liquor
advertising on television and elsewhere encourages consumption.
   She said requiring advertising warning labels, like those now
required on alcohol cans and bottles, ``can be an effective
component of a multi-faceted effort'' against alcohol abuse. But
she said in a formal statement that the Bush administration wasn't
taking sides over the ads, which are strongly opposed by the
alcohol industry.
   ``The decision whether to require the proposed rotating health
warnings in alcohol advertisements is a question of public policy
that is most appropriately decided by the United States Congress,''
she said.
   She spoke at a hearing on a bill to require the labels sponsored
by Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., and Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn.,
held by the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
transportation, tourism and hazardous materials.
   Kennedy told the panel that beer and other alcoholic beverage
ads are glamorizing drinking and are aimed at young people.
   ``Like it or not, beer ads educate Americans, particularly
younger Americans, that taking a drink is needed in order to win
that race, or make it down the ski slope, or land that account or
score with that new girl or guy,'' he said.
   Preparing for the hearing, the Beer Institute launched an
offensive against the legislation and released a poll purporting to
show that a majority of Americans don't think warnings would curb
alcohol abuse.
   James C. Sanders, president of the Beer Institute, said Tuesday
that if the bill passed, he expected beer companies would withdraw
advertising that underwrites sports events or television coverage
of the sports. With such a mixed message, he said, the ads would be
no longer effective.
   Bud Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers baseball team, said,
``Passage of this legislation could spell the end of family
entertainment across the country.''
   But Pat Taylor, director of alcohol policy for the private
Center for Science in the Public Interest, said there was no
evidence the ad warnings would bring an end to sports sponsorship.
She said the bill does not limit sports sponsorship by beer or
other alcohol products.
   ``Clearly there is a veiled threat here,'' Ms. Taylor said.
``It's impossible for me to imagine the alcohol industry in America
will stop advertising if this bill goes into effect.
   ``Their undertaking this kind of campaign indicates the bill ...
will probably be an effective part of what needs to be done to
control the alcohol problems,'' she said.
   The bill would require five rotating warnings with messages that
drinking during pregnancy may cause birth defects, that drinking
and driving is dangerous, and that drinking may become addictive.
   Backers of the bill say television and other types of ads
encourage drinking.
   Fred Meister, president of the Distilled Spirits Council of the
United States, countered that alcohol advertising is aimed at
encouraging drinkers ``to switch from one brand to another, but it
does not enlarge the drinking population.''

   Consumer prices, fueled by sharp increases oline costs, shot up 0.5
percent in June, more tin
food and gashan
double the rate of the past two months, the government said today.
   The unexpectedly steep rise in the Labor Department's Consumer
Price Index followed moderate 0.2 percent increases for both April
and May.
   Through the first six months of the year, consumer prices have
been rising at an annual rate of 5.9 percent, well above the 4.6
percent for all of 1989.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, meanwhile, sent a
strong signal today that the central bd renewed worries about
inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 11.63 to
2,988.12 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 377 up,
1,003 down and 497 unchanged.
   Before the market opened the Labor Department reported that the
consumer price index rose 0.5 percent in June, surpassing many
estimates by brokerage-firm economists.
   The news raised new worries about the choices facing the Federal
Reserve, which has taken steps in the past week to relax its credit
policy.
   Greater-than-expected inflationary pressures would stand to
restrict the Fed's options in its efforts to keep the economy
growing and cushion it from the effects of a squeeze on the
availability of bank credit.
   Interest rates climbed in the credit markets following the CPI
report, and the Dow Jones industrial average pulled back from the
verge of the 3,000 level, which it had briefly crossed in each of
the past three sessions.
   Recent standout performers hit by profit-taking today included
Wal-Mart Stores, down 1{ at 34; Waste Management, down 1\ at 42},
and Eli Lilly, down 2&rsqb; at 86{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.41 to 199.08. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.17 at 362.22.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 84.32 million shares at
noontime, against 81.81 million at the same point Tuesday.

   House Republicans today declared their
opposition to any deficit reduction plan that includes new taxes, a
position Democrats said would cripple budget talks with President
Bush.
   The resolution was approved by voice vote at a meeting of the
House GOP only hours before congressional leaders were to meet Bush
for what his spokesman said would be an effort by the president to
``nudge'' the talks forward.
   ``If they want Republican votes, they'd better come up with a
package that Republicans believe in,'' said Rep. Mickey Edwards,
R-Okla. He said he would rather have the talks collapse than ``a
deal that excludes House Republicans.''
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said the resolution
would not undermine the nearly-stalled budget talks, but Democrats
disagreed.
   ``To have one party say revenues are off the table would really
cripple this negotiation,'' said House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater downplayed the
House Republicans' vote, which rejects Bush's reversal on his ``no
new taxes'' pledge. ``They don't need to pass a resolution to make
us aware of that,'' he said.
   Rep. Richard Armey, R-Texas, sponsor of the resolution, and
other Republicans said it was aimed at the Democrats and not the
president. It included a clause attacking Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, who said last week he would not support a cut in
the capital gains tax unless tax rates on the wealthy were
increased.
   Democrats were sure to deliver to the president today the
message that they need more leadership from Bush, especially in
selling to the public the prospect of pocketbook-painful decisions
on taxes and program cuts.
   The Oval Office meeting was scheduled a day after a balanced
budget constitutional amendment came within seven votes of passing
the House, a sign of lawmakers' frustration over slow progress on
striking a budget deal.
   Eight years ago, the House defeated a balanced budget amendment
by a comfortable 46 votes. On Tuesday, it fell just seven votes shy
of the two-thirds margin needed in a 279-150 tally. The measure had
Bush's endorsement.
   Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, said he had opposed a balanced budget
amendment all his political life, but he voted for it Tuesday.
   ``I don't like this constitutional amendment,'' he said. ``But
we must ... figure out how to have the courage to raise the
revenues or cut the expenditures'' or expand the already
unfathomably large debt burden on the next generation.
   The government's debt topped $3.1 trillion this year and would
well exceed $4 trillion before the amendment took effect.
   The amendment starting in 1995 would prohibit government
spending from exceeding revenues, or any increase in government
borrowing, unless the requirements are waived by a three-fifths
vote of each chamber of Congress.
   The White House asked for the effective date of 1995, rather
than 1993 as originally proposed by Reps. Charles Stenholm,
D-Texas, and Larry Craig, R-Idaho, the chief sponsors.
   The administration said cutting the deficit too quickly would
hurt the economy. Doing it by fiscal 1993 would put spending cuts
or taxes before the public right before Bush's re-election date.
   Opponents said the amendment's requirements could easily be
dodged through accounting gimmickry, and delaying the effective
date to 1995 amounted to passing the buck.
   ``This so-called balanced budget amendment is the amendment for
the truly religious because the balance to which it refers occurs
only in the hereafter,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.
   But supporters said it was their best hope of returning the
government to fiscal balance.
   ``It's obvious we need a more compelling force to restrain
spending,'' said Rep. Tim Penny, D-Minn. ``This could not hurt, and
in fact might help.''
   Bush, like Ronald Reagan before him, has never proposed a
balanced budget but has touted the amendment. But faced with a new
surge in red ink, the president abandoned his pledge not to raise
taxes.
   The White House budget office on Monday projected that the
deficit in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, would reach $168.8
billion _ not counting the tens of billions needed to bail out
insolvent savings and loans.
   White House and congressionl negotiators are looking to reduce
that figure by at least $50 billion, but in the two months since
Bush called the budget summit an agreement hasn't been close.
   On Tuesday, congressional Democrats continued their series of
private meetings on possible spending cuts and tax increases.
   With the talks moving so slowly, congressional committees are
moving ahead with their legislative responsibilities in the
meantime.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee voted Tuesday to limit
defense spending next year to $294.9 billion, $8.4 billion less
than Bush wants but more than Democratic liberals support.

   Stock prices ended lower on London's Stock
Exchange Wednesday, pressured by a poor showing on Wall Street.
Trading was active.
   The market opened higher but rapidly lost ground on expectations
of a drop on Wall Street, due to an anticipated poor U.S. consumer
price index for June.
   The inflation fears were borne out, with the index showing a
rise of 0.5 percent, compared with an expected 0.3 percent.
   However, traders said some of London's losses also could be
attributed to profit-taking after a recent rally.
   The strong pound also pressured the London market, raising fears
of poor overseas earnings for British companies.
   But sentiment overall remained optimistic, one dealer said, with
``people looking for buy ideas rather than sell ideas.''
   ``People are using bad news to pick up cheap stock,'' he said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 13
points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 2,402.0. The session high was
2,424.8 and its low was 2,401.7
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed off 12.3 points at
1,900.6. The Financial Times 500-share index was down 6.95 points
at 1,291.50 at the close.
   Volume was 595.2 million shares, compared with 374.9 million
shares on Tuesday.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   DeSoto Inc. Wednesday announced an agreement to
sell its domestic consumer paint business to Sherwin-Williams Co.
of Cleveland for $80 million.
   The sale, which is subject to stockholder and regulatory
approval, would complete a partial liquidation by Des Plaines,
Ill.-based DeSoto in hopes of avoiding a takeover by the New York
investment group Sutton Holding Corp.
   DeSoto surprised Sutton late last week by announcing plans to
sell its industrial coatings and solvents businesses for $200
million.
   The sale of those assets and the paint business, which is a
major supplier to Sears, Roebuck and Co., would reduce DeSoto to a
manufacturer of household detergents.
   The proposed sales of assets will be submitted to shareholders
at a meeting in mid- or late September, DeSoto said in a statement.
   DeSoto has pledged to distribute proceeds from the sales to
shareholders.
   As of Tuesday, Sutton had not given up on its $200 million,
$50-per-share acquisition bid. The investment group said it had
extended the expiration date of its longstanding cash tender offer
to July 23. The offer was to have expired at midnight Monday.

Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. said Wednesday its
second quarter profit fell 18.2 percent, reflecting lower revenue
and higher costs at its domestic credit services segment.
   The business information marketer, whose products include
Nielsen television ratings, Donnelly telephone directories and
Moody's investment services, said it still expected to earn in the
range of $2.80 a share for the full year compared with $3.14 in
1989.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet said it had a profit of $123 million, or 67
cents per share, for the three months ended June 30 compared with
$150.4 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Second quarter revenue rose 13.1 percent to $1.20 billion from
$1.06 billion.
   The company's U.S. credit services business was stung last year
by complaints from some customers that they had been overcharged.
   The company said it took remedial action, but the repositioning
the division was expected to depress revenue and boost costs for
the year.
   Operating revenue from the risk-management information business
fell 1.8 percent to $235.2 million for the quarter, mainly because
of a high single-digit decline at U.S. credit services.
   But revenue was up overall because of increases ranging from 2.2
percent to 33.7 percent at the company's directory, marketing and
financial information units and its business services segment.
   Overall operating costs and other expenses climbed 20.5 percent
to $998.1 million in the quarter, due to the impact of the credit
services actions, accelerated investment at the Nielsen Marketing
Research and the impact of the acquisition of Managament Science
America late last year.
   For the first six months of the year, Dun &amp; Bradstreet said it
earned $233.3 million, or $1.27 a share, down 20.6 percent from
$293.7 million, or $1.57 a share, a year earlier.
   Six-month revenue rose 10.8 percent to $2.35 billion from $2.12
billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>Gannett Suffers First Quarterly Earnings Drop in 22 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROSSLYN, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gannett Co. announced today that second
quarter earnings were off more than $6 million from the previous
period last year, its first quarterly drop since the media giant
went public 22 years ago.
   The nation's biggest newspaper company announced earnings for
the second three months of 1990 were $105.26 million, or 66 cents
per share, compared to $112.10 million or 70 cents per share for
the same period in 1989.
   The drop was not unexpected. Earlier this month Gannett
officials confirmed published reports that earnings for the
April-June period were expected to be off.
   Gannett, which publishes USA Today, said paid advertising pages
at the national newspaper were down from 1,054 in the 1989 second
quarter to 929 in the same period this year.
   Total revenues for this year's second quarter were down 1
percent to $893.79 million, compared to $904.17 million in 1989.
Operating income was down 10 percent, from $215.59 million to
$193.06 million.
   For the first half of 1990, net income declined 4 percent to
$180.26 million, or $1.13 per share, from $187 million or $1.16 per
share in the 1989 period.
   In a letter to shareholders, Gannett blamed ``continuing
restructuring in the retail industry and a deteriorating consumer
economy'' for stalling sales growth this year.
   Newspaper advertising revenues were down 4 percent in the second
quarter, reflecting a 7 percent decline in run-of-page advertising
volume and reduced newspaper advertising in Detroit, where a joint
operating agency started up last November. Retail ad lineage was
down at most newspapers, and classified volume declined, reflecting
lower demand for auto, help wanted and real estate advertising,
Gannett said.
   The media company also said normal cyclical lows in retailing
``have been exaggerated by bankruptcies and consolidations of some
major department stores, which traditionally have been among the
company's largest advertisers.''

   Soybean futures prices rose Wednesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade for only the second time in the last 10
trading sessions, responding to higher soybean meal prices in
Europe.
   Grain futures closed mostly lower on weather-related selling
that also limited gains in the soybean market, analysts said.
   Despite the gain in soybeans, which have fallen in almost every
trading session since July 5, weather conditions remain an
overwhelmingly bearish influence in the crop futures markets, said
Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   ``You've got a situation here for the corn and beans where

   In the corn market, he said, ``There was talk today of possible
yield hikes, possibly close to a record.''
   Soybeans closed near the middle of the day's trading range and

<HEAD>European Commission Fines Six Steel Companies For Price Fixing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Commission on Wednesday
fined six steel companies for forming an illegal price-fixing
cartel from May 1986 to October 1988.
   French Ugine Aciers de Chatillon et Gueugnon, German Krupp Stahl
and Italian Ternie Accial Speciali were each fined 100,000 European
currency units, the equivalent of $126,000; German Thyssen
Edelstahlwerke and British Steel were each fined 50,000 ecus, or
$63,000; and Belgian ALZ was fined 25,000 ecus, or $31,500.
   Spanish Acerinox, Swedish Avesta and Finnish Outokumpu were also
members of the cartel, the commission said, but the European
Commission has no authority over the Scandinavian businesses, and
the Spanish company was not fined because Spain was still in the
early stage of EC membership at the time and thus limiting its
steel exports to other EC countries.
   The commission said the nine companies had shared a 17-country
market _ the 12 EC countries plus a majority of European Free Trade
Area countries _ where they had agreed on quarterly production
quotas.
   This cartel ``helped keep prices at a higher level than what
would have take place if competition had normally functioned,'' the
European executive said.
   It added, however, that the fines were low because EC officials
had not properly coordinated their job. It admitted that some
officials in charge of controling the cartel ignored it.

<HEAD>AMR Corp. Earnings Drop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AMR Corp., parent company of American
Airlines, reported Wednesday that second quarter earnings were down
27.4 percent from last year and off by almost $170 million for the
first six months of the year. The company blamed increasing
expenses.
   Second quarter earnings were $129.2 million, or $2.05 per share,
down from $177.9 million or $2.83 a share for the same period in
1989. Revenue during the quarter rose to $2.97 billion from $2.71
billion a year earlier.
   First half earnings were $109.9 million, or $1.75 per share,
down from $278.9 million, or $4.43 per share for the same period
last year. Revenue during the six months rose to $5.66 billion from
$5.17 billion.
   The company said passenger yields _ the average amount one
passenger pays to fly one mile _ increased by 4.7 percent to 12.74
cents.
   But the increases were not enough to offset increases in fuel,
maintenance, engineering and rentals, which ``all increased faster
than our growth in capacity,'' AMR Chairman and President Robert L.
Crandall said.
   ``As a result,'' he said, ``we have launched a corporate-wide
drive to curtail costs and enhance revenues in both the near and
longer term.''
   AMR spokesman Ed Stewart said the company has put a hold on
hiring new employees in some departments, but vacancies are being
filled and no layoffs are planned.
   ``Obviously, crucial positions will not go unfilled,'' he said.
   Most of the cost-cutting measures are ``simple things,'' such as
cutting down on photocopying, he said. Crandall also has urged
employees to send cost-cutting ideas to an internal program that
has saved $94 million in three years, Stewart said.
   AMR said it recorded a 2.9 percent increase in revenue passenger
miles and a 12 percent increase in cargo revenue ton miles. It
scored its biggest traffic day ever on June 28 with more than 282
million revenue passenger miles.

   The stock market lapsed into a broad decline
today, retreating from record highs amid renewed worries about
inflation.
   Before the market opened the Labor Department reported that the
consumer price index rose 0.5 percent in June, surpassing many
estimates by brokerage-firm economists.
   The news raised new worries about the choices facing the Federal
Reserve, which has taken steps in the past week to relax its credit
policy.
   Greater-than-expected inflationary pressures would stand to
restrict the Fed's options in its efforts to keep the economy
growing and cushion it from the effects of a squeeze on the
availability of bank credit.
   Interest rates climbed in the credit markets following the CPI
report, and the Dow Jones industrial average pulled back from the
verge of the 3,000 level, which it had briefly crossed in each of
the past three sessions.

   Job security loopholes that allowed General
Motors Corp. to close four plants in the last three years must be
closed before a new labor contract can be signed, UAW President
Owen Bieber said Wednesday.
   ``We told the corporation that disappointment is far too mild a
word to describe our feelings about how they perceived their job
security commitments they made to us three years ago,'' Bieber said
at a news conference after negotiations began with the giant
automaker.
   Talks between the union and Ford Motor Co. open Thursday in
Dearborn. Negotiations start Friday at Chrysler Corp.'s
headquarters in Highland Park.
   The contracts cover more than 450,000 hourly workers and nearly
as many retirees. Each of the agreements expire at midnight Sept.
14.
   The talks are between a U.S. auto industry that is reeling from
the competition of Japanese automakers and a union that has seen
thousands of its workers laid off or idled indefinitely due to
plant closings.
   In addition to eliminating plant closings, Bieber said the union
would seek company commitments to:
   _Recall laid-off workers.
   _Review executive compensation before deciding to lay off
workers. Bieber declined to say whether the union would try to link
executive bonuses to profit-sharing payments, similar to a formula
used at Chrysler.
   _Reduce hours worked without cutting wages.
   Each of the automakers is expected to seek more flexibility in
operating their plants in addition to finding ways to contain
health care costs.
   GM and Chrysler controlled costs in a sagging auto market by
shutting plants that made poorly selling products. Such indefinite
idling was allowed in the most recent contracts, and 17,000 UAW
workers lost their jobs because of it.
   ``I accused them of performing the cynical, semantic maneuver
represented by the term `idling' plants,'' Bieber said.
   Ford, which uses its assembly plants more efficiently, has cut
back by trimming overtime for hourly workers.
   Chief GM negotiator Al Warren said the company's goal is to
preserve current jobs, but that employment levels depend on market
conditions. Car and truck sales through July 10 of this year were
down 3.1 percent from the same period a year earlier, although
there has been a slight upswing since late June.
   Much of Bieber's and Warren's news conferences Wednesday
centered on health care costs. The companies have said health care
expenses boost vehicle prices, putting the Big Three at a
disadvantage with Japanese companies that make vehicles in the
United States.
   Warren said GM spends $622 in employee health care costs for
every one of the cars and trucks it sells compared with $50 to $100
per car for Japanese assembly plants in the United States.
   Bieber said endorsement of a national health care system is the
only way GM and other employers can cut their health care costs.
   Dick O'Brien, GM's vice president for personnel, administration
and development, dodged the question of whether the huge automaker
would back the union's call for national health insurance.
   ``We're looking at all solutions to the health-care question at
GM,'' O'Brien said.
   Although no single issue is seen as a harbinger of a strike,
some analysts have said a strike is more likely now than at any
time since 1970, when the UAW struck GM for seven weeks.
   Before the talks began Wednesday morning at GM, about 2,000 UAW
members and their families marched around the massive building in a
demonstration demanding protection for retired workers against the
rising cost of living.
   The union and the companies have said that linking cost of
living payment adjustments for pensioners to the inflation rate
could cost billions of dollars.

retirees is an emotional issue for the union. However, it also is
expensive. A lump sum payment is seen as more likely than linking
cost-of-living adjustments to inflation.
   _Health care. The union will defend the current health-care

management decisions. However, a proliferation of joint

spends $622 per car in health-care costs for hourly workers.

<HEAD>First Interstate, PNC Financial Post Quarterly Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   First Interstate Bancorp reported Wednesday that its second
quater profit fell 8 percent over a year ago, while another large
banking company PNC Financial Corp. said earnings fell 13 percent.
   Both companies blamed problem real estate loans for the drop in
income, becoming the latest among the nation's largest banks to
suffer from regional declines in real estate prices.
   First Interstate netted $95.1 million, or $1.42 per share, in
the three months ended June 30, compared with earnings of $103.1
million, or $2.02 a share, in 1989.
   PNC Financial earned $108.9 million, or $1.14 a share, during
the quarter, compared with $125.5 million, or $1.30 a share, last
year.

<HEAD>First Interstate</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   First Interstate blamed its drop in profit largely on its
troubled bank in Arizona, which lost 3.5 million during the quarter
after breaking even the first three months.
   In late 1989, the Los Angeles-based bank took hundreds of
millions of dollars in special charges to cover real estate losses
in Arizona and Texas, where it has another bank subsidiary.
   Edward M. Carson, chief executive officer, said the company was
making progress in reducing its exposure to bad loans.
   ``Our operations in Texas have been showing increasing
profitability during the past two quarters and are meeting
expectations,'' Carson said in a statement. ``Our operations in
California, Oregon, Washington and Nevada continue to perform
well.''
   For the first six months, First Interstate's net income fell 6
percent to $222.3 million, or $3.60 per share, from $235.3 million,
or $4.83 a share.

   Pittsburgh-based PNC said it wrote off $40.1 million as it
adjusted the value of real estate.
   The company said it took $168.3 million in net charge-offs,
including $70.7 million related to loans to developing countries.
   Despite the drop in net income, PNC Chairman Thomas O'Brien,
said, ``These results are in line with our earlier projections and
show the strength of our core earnings which continue to allow PNC
to address the problems facing our industry.''
   For the first half of 1990, PNC's earnings fell 26 percent to
$183.4 million, or $1.91 a share, from $249.1 million, or $2.59 a
share.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar ended mostly higher in choppy trading
Wednesday after falling overseas, as congressional testimony from
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan failed to erase marketwide
confusion over U.S. interest rates.
   Gold prices declined. On the Commodity Exchange in New York,
gold bullion for current delivery settled at $361.60 a troy ounce,
down 40 cents from late Tuesday. Republic National Bank in New York
quoted a late bid for gold at $361.10, off 60 cents.
   In discussing monetary policy before the Senate Banking
Committee, Greenspan sent a strong signal that the central bank
would lower interest rates. But he indicated that would only happen
after lawmakers agreed on a deficit-reduction package.
   Some currency dealers said they interpreted the remarks to mean
that a drop in rates was forthcoming. However, others said the
remarks confused the markets.
   ``We're not quiet sure what Greenspan is up to,'' said a London
dealer. ``He appears to be playing with words which could be
dangerous.''
   Adding to the confusion was a Wednesday report from the Labor
Department that indicated inflation may not be under control, a
condition that would keep interest rates higher. Consumer prices
climbed 0.5 percent in June, more than double the rate of the past
two months, the department said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell to a closing 147.25 Japanese yen from
148.20 yen at Tuesday's close. It traded at 147.45 yen in London,
and at 147.765 yen in New York, down from 147.80 yen.
   The dollar was mixed against the British pound compared to late
Tuesday. Sterling traded at $1.8205 in London, up from $1.8115, and
at $1.81525 in New York, down from $1.8165.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.6480 German marks, up from 1.6440;
1.41585 Swiss francs, up from 1.4048; 5.5285 French francs, up from
5.5155; 1,207.00 Italian lire, up from 1,204.25; and 1.15425
Canadian dollars, up from 1.15295.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Tuesday: 1.6440 German
marks, down from 1.6455; 1.4085 Swiss francs, up from 1.4065;
5.5160 French francs, down from 5.5210; 1.8522 Dutch guilders, down
from 1.8552; 1,203.75 Italian lire, down from 1,205.12; and 1.1530
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1562.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $360.25 an ounce from
$361.25 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold fell to $359.85 an ounce
from $361.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.71 to close at a bid $360.15
an ounce.
   Silver prices were up. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $4.884 a troy ounce, up 7 cents from
late Tuesday. Silver rose in London to $4.84 an ounce from $4.83.

<HEAD>Drexel Restructures Board; Shad Out as Chairman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. said Wednesday
that John S.R. Shad had resigned as chairman as part of a
restructuring at the Wall Street firm during its bankruptcy court
proceedings.
   The restructuring includes the addition of three new outside
directors. It comes as creditors are challenging Drexel's attempts
to maintain control over asset sales as it reorganizes under
Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law.
   Drexel hired Shad, a former Securities and Exchange Commission
chairman, in April 1989 as part of its settlement of securities
fraud charges with federal regulators.
   In a statement, Drexel said Shad resigned ``because the
principal purposes for which he joined the firm have been
substantially achieved or obviated by the firm's Chapter 11
filing.''
   Drexel filed for protection from creditors Feb. 13. The firm has
said it plans to emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings but has not
said what business it would conduct.
   Drexel soared to Wall Street's heights in the 1980s largely
because of its command over the junk bond market but never
recovered from its guilty plea in the government's insider trading
probe. Drexel agreed to pay $650 million in penalties and pleaded
guilty to six felonies.
   Drexel chief executive John F. Sorte said the restructuring ``is
tangible evidence of our determination to protect the creditors and
preserve equity values.''
   Creditors have filed a motion with U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard
C. Buschman III seeking to stop Drexel from selling securities and
other assets without additional outside supervision.
   The firm has said liquidation is a matter of routine bankruptcy
procedures and it has granted adequate input.
   Under the restructuring, Drexel's board also elected Ralph S.
Saul to succeed Shad as chairman.
   The firm said Roderick M. Hills, also a former SEC chairman,
resigned from the board because of a conflict of interest with a
client of his law firm, Donovan Leisure, that ``made it
inappropriate for him to continue as a director.'' Drexel did not
specify the conflict.
   Shad, Saul and Hills joined Drexel as outside directors to help
oversee the company after it settled the SEC charges, which
included allegations of insider trading, fraud and lax compliance
with securities laws.
   The three new outside directors are Fletcher L. Byrom, former
chairman and chief executive of Koppers Co.; Deborah Hicks Midanek,
a managing director of Solon Asset Management Corp. and a former
Drexel executive; and Frederick W. Zuckerman, vice president and
treasurer of Chrysler Corp.
   Drexel has until November to draft a reorganization plan. The
firm and creditors last month agreed to try to draft a plan
together.

<HEAD>Mercedes Introducing Overtime Shifts to Meet Demand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STUTTGART, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German automaker
Mercedes-Benz AG said Wednesday it was introducing Saturday
overtime shifts to meet rising demand for its cars.
   The auto-making arm of Daimler-Benz AG said that special
Saturday shifts will be added on several Saturdays beginning in
September. The overtime shifts will affect the company's plants in
Stuttgart-Untertuerkheim, Sindelfingen and Bremen.
   The move comes after the company's workers' council gave its
agreement to the overtime shifts.
   Mercedes-Benz had tried to introduce the overtime shifts at the
start of the year, but the company could not reach an agreement
with the workers' council.
   In a brief statement, Mercedes-Benz said the extra shifts will
be added ``so that the company can react flexibly to the heightened
demand.'' It said growth rates in Europe and other foreign markets
for Mercedes-Benz cars in general, along with lively demand for
certain models and upgraded equipment, had prompted the need for
extra shifts.
   ``The increasing globalization of the markets, the
internationalization of the supply and changes in customer behavior
make it ... necessary to react more flexibly and faster to take
advantage of market chances,'' the company said.
   It said demand for its ``sportline'' equipment, which can be
added at extra cost to lower- and middle-priced cars, was
especially strong. Demand was also keen for the company's cheapest
car, the new 190 E 1.8-liter model that can be purchased in West
Germany for about 34,000 marks, or $20,600.
   The company said its operations in Italy, France, and Spain had
recorded sales increases of 7 percent to 15 percent in the first
half of 1990. Sales in Japan jumped 44 percent, and the company
indicated solid sales in the important U.S. market had played a key
role in the decision to boost production.
   A spokesman for Mercedes-Benz said sales figures for the U.S. in
the first half were not available, but said the company expects to
sell about 75,000 cars in the U.S. this year.
   Although the projected figure would be roughly the same as last
year, the spokesman described it as successful in light of tough
competition in the U.S. market.
   ``We are doing comparatively well in the U.S.,'' the official
said, referring to other luxury carmakers that have been
experiencing sales declines.
   The spokesman said the extra Saturday shifts will enable the
company to produce 570,000 cars this year, up from an earlier
forecast of 556,000.
   Mercedes' record production year was 1987, when its output
reached 580,000 cars.

   Surging food, housing and gasoline costs sent
consumer prices soaring 0.5 percent in June, more than double the
inflation rate of the past two months, the government reported
Wednesday.
   In other bad economic news, housing construction fell in June
for the fifth consecutive month, pushing the level of building
activity to its lowest point since the depths of the last recession.
   ``If you view it as a two-front war, we're getting hammered from
both sides ... both on inflation and the growth front,'' said
Martin Regalia, chief economist for the National Council of Savings
Institutions.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan called the June
inflation report ``higher than we would like to see'' but said much
of the increase was due to a temporary jump in housing and gasoline
costs and did not reflect an upturn in underlying inflationary
pressures.
   Greenspan said that despite some problems, the economy was
performing reasonably well at present and ``is not on the edge of
either falling apart into a recession or about to take on highly
inflationary characteristics.''
   He confirmed that the central bank had eased credit slightly
last week and indicated the Fed stood ready to do so again to
deflect any adverse effects on the economy from tax increases and
spending cuts under consideration to reduce the huge budget deficit.
   The inflation news caused jitters on Wall Street by raising
fears that higher inflation will limit the Fed's ability to lower
interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 18.07
points to close at 2,981.68.
   The unexpectedly steep rise in the Labor Department's Consumer
Price Index followed 0.2 percent increases in both April and May.
   Through the first six months of the year, consumer prices have
risen at an annual rate of 5.9 percent, well above the 4.6 percent
for all of 1989.
   The Commerce Department reported on Wednesday a drop of 2.3
percent in housing starts last month, with new homes and apartments
being built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.18 million
units. The June decline followed decreases of 0.9 percent in May,
6.9 percent in April, 12.2 percent in March and 5.1 percent in
February.
   Analysts called the June inflation figure a worrisome increase
that demonstrates entrenched inflation. They had expected prices to
keep recovering from a jolt early in the year when a cold snap sent
the costs of fruits, vegetables and energy skyward.
   ``This was the time when we were supposed to be getting a good
number in response to the surge from the first of the year. But the
message is, inflation is very much still part of the scene, and
there's no sign that it's abating,'' said Robert Dederick, chief
economist at the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   Michael K. Evans, who heads an economic forecasting firm in
Washington, said there was no reason to hope for better news any
time soon on either inflation or sluggish economic activity.
   ``The problem is endemic _ low productivity, lack of investment
and a high budget deficit. These problems are not going to change
overnight,'' Evans said.
   In the inflation report, grocery store food prices, which had
fallen in each of the past two months, rose 1 percent in June as
prices went up for all of the major food categories.
   Gasoline prices, which generally increase during the
heavy-driving summer months, jumped 2.5 percent last month after
falling 1.6 percent in May.
   Housing costs climbed 0.6 percent, the largest increase in such
costs since a 1 percent rise in May 1985.
   Within the food category, which rose 0.7 percent overall, there
was a sharp turnaround in the price of fruits and vegetables, which
rose 1.5 percent after falling 2.4 percent in May.
   Pork prices, up 4.0 percent in June, have risen sharply over the
past nine months, climbing at an annual rate of 26.2 percent during
that period. Poultry prices were up 1.3 percent while dairy prices,
after dropping the past three months, rose 0.2 percent in June.
   Energy costs overall were up 0.6 percent. The price of natural
gas shot up 2.7 percent, but fuel oil dropped 4.2 percent and
electricity fell 1.6 percent.
   Prices for items outside the volatile food and energy sectors
jumped 0.4 percent in June. Analysts consider this so-called
``core'' rate a better indicator of underlying inflation pressures
in the economy.
   New car prices edged down 0.2 percent, the fifth straight
decline in the face of sluggish sales.
   Clothing costs, which jumped sharply earlier in the year when a
warm February got spring sales off at an early start, fell 0.1
percent last month. That had been expected as merchants marked down
summer sale clothing.
   Medical care costs soared 0.7 percent in June for the fifth
straight month, pushing those costs 9.0 percent higher than a year
ago.
   The various changes put the index for all consumer prices at
129.9 in June. That means a hypothetical selection of goods and
services costing $100 in the 1982-84 base period cost $129.90 last
month, up from the $124.10 a year ago.

<HEAD>Analysts Not Surprised By Report That IBM To Sell Low-Tech Product
Lines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industry analysts said Wednesday they weren't
surprised by a reported plan by IBM to sell several of its
low-technology product lines, including its well-known Selectric
typewriters.
   ``My guess is the market has not been very attractive,'' said
Barry Bosak, who follows IBM for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
``I've been wondering what the fate of the typewriter plant would
be for some time.''
   International Business Machines Corp.'s typewriter lines in
particular face an uncertain future as word processors increasingly
gain favor in offices and homes, analysts said.
   Also said to be under consideration for sale are IBM's low-end
computer printer and computer keyboard lines. Analysts said the
keyboard business increasingly is being dominated by low-cost Asian
manufacturers.
   According to unidentified sources quoted by the Wall Street
Journal, IBM is considering selling the three product lines in a
leveraged buyout valued at about $3 billion.
   IBM has been negotiating with a potential buyer and a deal could
be worked out by the end of the month, the newspaper said.
   IBM shares lost 87{ cents Wednesday to close at $119.87{ on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   In a statement issued from its Armonk, N.Y., headquarters, the
world's largest computer company said it ``has not concluded any
transaction like the one speculated on ...''
   ``IBM is in the process of considering many options as it moves
to sharpen its strategic focus and remain on the leading edge of
the information processing business.''
   The company also said it had no plans to modify its
``full-employment policy'' of no layoffs.
   When IBM sold businesses in the past, it has tried to allay
employee fears of job losses. Buyouts, however, often are followed
by layoffs to cut costs and help the acquirer repay debt used in
the purchase.
   IBM has been paring its operations and payroll since the mid
1980s, when growth in the computer industry began to slow. In
December, IBM announced plant consolidations and another round of
employee reductions through voluntary early retirement.
   The company also has been getting out of businesses it considers
marginal or requiring investments that would crimp profits.
   In the past few years, IBM sold its Rolm telephone business to
Siemens AG of West Germany and most of its copier business to
Eastman Kodak Co. Last week, IBM said it would transfer its
automated teller line to a joint venture with Diebold Inc.
   IBM does not disclose revenue and profit from individual product
lines, but analysts said the three lines in question probably make
up less than 5 percent of its overall business.
   The typewriters, keyboards and low-end printers are produced at
IBM's Lexington, Ky., plant. In the early 1980s IBM spent hundreds
of millions of dollars automating the plant in a bid to compete
with lower-cost foreign manufacturers.
   In retrospect, that decision appears to have been a mistake,
analysts said. However, Smith Barney's Bosak added, ``Not all that
was as obvious when the (modernization) plans started.''
   IBM spokesman Peter Thonis said the Lexington plant is ``a
state-of-the-art facility that's been profitable and a very
effective operation.'' The plant, IBM's only domestic typewriter
manufacturing site, employs about 5,000, he said.
   Analysts questioned whether the product lines could fetch the
reported $3 billion. One analyst said he believed $2 billion was a
more realistic price.
   Bosak speculated that the product lines would be most attractive
to a foreign buyer, given that the typewriter business is
concentrated overseas and that the U.S. leveraged buyout business
has dried up in the past year.
   Earlier this week, IBM reported its second-quarter profit rose 5
percent from a year ago to $1.41 billion as revenue grew 8 percent
to $16.5 billion.

<HEAD>Gannett, NY Times Post Profit Declines for Second Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gannett Co. Inc. posted a 6.1 percent profit decline on
Wednesday, its first quarterly earnings dip in 22 years as a public
company, and the New York Times Co. reported a 35 percent drop in
its second quarter earnings.
   A weak advertising market hurt both media companies.
   ``It's the same problem the whole industry has _ the ad linage
numbers continue to be disappointing,'' said Peter Appert, media
industry analyst for the investment firm C.J. Lawrence, Morgan
Grenfell.
   Retail advertising, which accounts for about half of the typical
newspaper's ad revenue, has been hurt because of industry
consolidation and severe financial woes at some major department
store chains.
   Classified advertising, which makes up another 40 percent of
newspaper ad revenue, has fallen as the economy has deteriorated in
parts of the country.
   ``That's a combination that makes for a very tough climate for
newspaper companies,'' Appert said.

<TEXT>
   Gannett, the newspaper, broadcasting and billboard giant based
in Arlington, Va., indicated recently that it expected to report
its first year-to-year earnings decline in the three months ended
July 1.
   Gannett reported Wednesday that it earned $105.3 million, or 66
cents a share, in the quarter, down from $112.1 million, or 70
cents per share, a year earlier.
   Second quarter revenue slipped 1 percent to $893.8 million from
$904.2 million a year earlier.
   Operating income fell 10 percent to $193.1 million from $215.6
million a year earlier.
   Gannett said continuing restructuring in the retail industry and
a deteriorating consumer economy had stalled its revenue growth in
1990.
   Newspaper advertising revenues were down 4 percent in the second
quarter, reflecting a 7 percent decline in run-of-press advertising
volume and reduced newspaper advertising in Detroit, where a joint
operating agency started up last November.
   It said normal cyclical lows in retailing ``have been
exaggerated by bankruptcies and consolidations of some major
department stores, which traditionally have been among the
company's largest advertisers.''
   Gannett said newspaper ad revenue fell 4 percent to $497.5
million in the quarter. The company said retail ad linage fell at
most of its newspapers and classified ad volume also fell.
   Gannett publishes 83 daily newspapers, including USA Today, and
54 non-daily newspapers.
   Paid advertising pages at USA Today, Gannett's national
newspaper, dropped 12 percent to 929 pages for the quarter and 9
percent to 1,780 for the first half, the company said. But it said
rate increases and higher readership helped boost ad revenues at
the newspaper by 3 percent for the first half.
   Broadcasting revenue slipped to $108.6 million in the quarter
from $109.8 million a year earlier. Gannett owns 10 television and
15 radio stations.
   Outdoor ad revenues rose 6 percent to $72.4 million for the
quarter.
   For the first six months of the year, Gannett said it earned
$180.3 million, or $1.13 a share, down 4 percent from $187 million,
or $1.16 a share, a year earlier.
   Six-month revenue slipped 1 percent to $1.71 billion from $1.72
billion.

   Lower advertising linage at the New York Times due to weakness
in the region's economy, higher depreciation and interest expenses
for new plants and the impact of the 1989 purchase of McCall's
magazine were cited for the profit decline at New York Times Co.
   The company earned $26.8 million, or 35 cents per share, in the
three months ended June 30 compared with $41.3 million, or 53 cents
a share, a year earlier. The 1989 results included $2.1 million, or
3 cents a share, from cable operations sold last August.
   Second quarter revenue rose 2 percent to $468.9 million from
$460.3 million a year earlier.
   Operating profit at the newspaper group, which includes the New
York Times, 35 regional newspapers and a one-third interest in the
International Herald Tribune, fell 25.2 percent to $50.1 million
from a year earlier.
   Ad volume at the New York Times fell 13.4 percent for the
quarter and 12.7 percent for the first half. About 60 percent of
the decline in ad linage was in classified advertising, the company
said.
   ``Classified is continuing to fall precipitously,'' said Ed
Atorino, media analyst for the investment firm Salomon Brothers.
``That reflects the very severe economic depression in New York
along with a lot of other Northeast cities.''
   Ad volume at the regional newspapers rose 2.5 percent for the
quarter and 0.2 percent for the first half, the company said.
   The magazine group had an operating profit of $500,000 in the
quarter, down from $4.2 million a year earlier. The decline stemmed
from costs associated with the McCall's purchase last August.
   Results were steady at the broadcasting and information services
segment, but equity in earnings of the forest products group fell
to $1.5 million from $3 million in the second quarter of 1989.
   For the first half, the company said it earned $43.4 million, or
57 cents a share, down 42 percent from $74.8 million, or 95 cents a
share, a year ago.
   First half-revenue rose 1.9 percent to $900.1 million from
$883.4 million a year earlier.

   Crude oil prices closed slightly lower Wednesday
after advancing earlier in the session on rumors that Iraq was
planning military action against Kuwait.
   The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, fell 10 cents to $18.55 a 42-gallon barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange after having risen as high as
$18.85 earlier in the day.
   Iraq accused Kuwait Wednesday of stealing oil worth $2.4 billion
from Iraqi territory near their border. The accusation marked a
sharp escalation in Iraq's campaign against fellow members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries who have exceeded
production limits set by the cartel.
   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been Iraq's main
targets.
   During Wednesday's trading, rumors circulated that Iraq was
massing troops at its border with Kuwait. Investors snapped up oil
contracts amid fears that a war could break out between the two
countries and curtail the supply of oil coming out of the Persian
Gulf region.
   But as the session wore on, the rumors were not substantiated,
the market calmed and the price of crude fell back.
   Prices for refined products traded on the mercantile exchange
ended the day mixed. Unleaded regular gasoline for August delivery
fell 1.45 cents to 62.67 cents a gallon. Home heating oil picked up
0.03 cent to settle at 56.11 cents a gallon.
   In natural gas trading, the August contract closed at $1.450 per
1,000 cubic feet, down from $1.462 on Tuesday.

   The nation's two largest defense contractors
reported very different second quarter earnings on Wednesday
primarily because of different accounting approaches to the same
problem.
   The problem is development of the A-12, the Navy's new bomber
for its aircraft carriers.
   General Dynamics Corp., the country's second biggest defense
company, said it lost $240 million, or $5.75 a share, in the second
quarter primarily because of a $450 million cost overrun for the
A-12.
   The quarterly loss for the St. Louis-based company compared with
a profit of $58.4 million, or $1.39 a share, for the same period a
year ago. Sales for the quarter, which ended June 30, were up
slightly at $2.6 billion compared with $2.5 billion in the 1989
period.
   Along with the $450 million, General Dynamics said its SINCGARS
radio contract with the Army would cost an additional $50 million,
bringing the total one-time charge against second-quarter earnings
to $500 million. That's the largest one-time quarterly charge in
company history.
   General Dynamics' partner on the A-12 program, McDonnell Douglas
Corp., didn't take any charges for the project and reported a
profit of $57 million, or $1.49 a share, for the quarter.
   That compares with a loss of $48 million, or $1.25 a share, for
the same period last year. Sales for the quarter were $4.8 billion
compared with $3.37 billion in last year's second quarter.
   The good news comes in the wake of Monday's announcement that
McDonnell Douglas, also headquartered in St. Louis, was planning to
cut its work force by up to 11 percent this year and trim other
expenses in an effort to save $700 million.
   General Dynamics' stock price closed at $31.50, down 12.5 cents
in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday.
McDonnell Douglas' stock closed up $1.75 at $43 on the NYSE.
   Who's right about the A-12?
   ``Neither is wrong. Each company is using its own consistent
accounting approach. This is not a scheme by McDonnell Douglas to
try to fool anybody,'' said Howard Rubel, a stock analyst for C.J.
Lawrence in New York.
   McDonnell Douglas said its partner was using an inflated cost
estimate for McDonnell's share of the work on the half-finished
program and did not include estimates of claims for additional
bills above the agreed-upon $4.8 billion contract price.
   ``We are confident that our costs will be lower and that these
claims are valid and will result in payment,'' said company
spokesman Andrew Wilson.
   Paul Nisbet, a stock analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities in
New York, said the different directions in earnings were expected
on Wall Street as were the profit reports.
   ``General Dynamics earnings were fairly strong except for the
A-12. McDonnell Douglas was right on expectations,'' Nisbet said.
   Rubel said there were some good signs for McDonnell Douglas
including improved profits in its missiles, space and electronic
systems division and much lower losses in commercial aircraft.
   ``The results aren't as bad as the worst fears,'' said Rubel.
``If you will, this should dispel the worst fears.''

<TEXT>
   B-2 bomber maker Northrop Corp. said
Wednesday it earned $29.3 million during its second quarter,
compared with a $78.1 million quarterly loss a year earlier due to
cost overruns on a classified project.
   Per share earnings were 63 cents, compared with a loss of $1.67
in the second quarter of 1989. Sales were virtually unchanged at
about $1.4 billion.
   Northrop's backlog of orders increased 27 percent, from $5.15
billion on June 30, 1989, to $6.54 billion on June 30 this year.
   About half of Northrop's revenue comes from the B-2 stealth
plane. The aerospace company said its prototype B-2, now being
tested in flights above the California desert, had met or bettered
all its initial test objectives.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney wants to cap production of the
radar-dodging planes at 75, down from 132 that once had been
planned. Some congressional opponents would like to stop the planes
at the current level of 15 already in the pipeline.
   The second-quarter 1989 loss stemmed from a $150 million loss
provision Northrop was forced to take on a fixed-price research and
development program in its missiles and unpiloted vehicle systems
division. Like several other defense contractors, Northrop has
stopped accepting such fixed-price research projects because costs
are so unpredictable and hard to contain.
   For the first six months, Northrop earnings totaled $125.3
million, $2.67 per share, compared with a loss of $68.4 million,
$1.46 per share, during the same period last year. The 1990
earnings include an after-tax gain of $67.1 million, or $1.42 per
share, from the first-quarter sale of the company's headquarters
buildings in Century City.
   Sales for the first six months were $2.69 billion, up
fractionally from the $2.68 billion in revenues in the first half
of 1989.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rise in unemployment in East Germany is
quickening now that the country has merged its economy with that of
West Germany, the government reported Wednesday.
   At mid-July, the number of East Germans registered as jobless
rose to 223,876, or 2.5 percent of the labor force, said Regine
Hildebrandt, East German minister for labor and social affairs.
   At the start of the month, there were 150,000 registered
unemployed in East Germany. That total that was up from 45,000 in
April.
   Economists say unemployment could hit 3 million within a year as
uncompetitive East German companies go bankrupt because they cannot
make the adjustment from a centrally planned ecomomy to free-market
capitalism.
   Earlier this month, Hildebrandt said the biggest problem facing
East Germany was that Western companies were not investing as
quickly as expected. She also said the number of new smaller and
medium-sized companies expected to stimulate new jobs in the future
hadn't been rising as quickly as the government would like.
   The two Germanys joined their economies and monetary systems on
July 1 and are expected to merge into one nation by the end of the
year.

   The stock market retreated from its recent
record highs Wednesday, posting a broad loss in the face of new
worries about inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had closed Monday
and Tuesday just fractionally below 3,000, dropped 18.07 points to
2,981.68.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
483 up, 1,030 down and 522 unchanged.
   Before the market opened the Labor Department reported that the
consumer price index rose 0.5 percent in June, surpassing many
estimates by brokerage-firm economists.
   The news raised fresh questions about the choices facing the
Federal Reserve, which has taken steps in the past week to relax
its credit policy.
   Greater-than-expected inflationary pressures would stand to
restrict the Fed's options in its efforts to keep the economy
growing and cushion it from the effects of a squeeze on the
availability of bank credit.
   Interest rates climbed in the credit markets following the CPI
report, and the Dow Jones industrial average pulled back from the
verge of the 3,000 level, which it had briefly crossed in each of
the past three sessions.
   Recent standout growth-stock performers that were hit by
profit-taking Wednesday included Wal-Mart Stores, down 1} at 33};
Waste Management, down 1\ at 42}, and Eli Lilly, down 3~ at 85.
   Polaroid fell 3\ to 36. Late Wednesday the company posted lower
second-quarter earnings and said its operating profit for the year
would be about the same as or a little lower than its 1989 results.
   AMR dropped 2~ to 61|, also on lower quarterly earnings.
   United Telecommunications led the active list, down 2\ at 27\ on
volume of more than 10 million shares. The stock fell 8} points
Tuesday when the company posted a 55.1 percent decline in its
second-quarter earnings.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down ~ at 119~; Philip Morris, down &rsqb; at 50&lsqb;; Procter &amp;
Gamble, down } at 89, and DuPont, down \ at 39}.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 168.76 million
shares, against 176.79 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 208.32 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $28.95 billion, or 0.83
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.66 to 198.83.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 4.05 to 431.53, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 3.30 at 364.22.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market

<HEAD>Non-Contract Employees to Accept Wage and Benefit Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new agreement appears to have broken an impasse
between union and non-union UAL Corp. workers over the proposed
buyout of United Airlines' parent company, employee spokesmen said
Wednesday.
   Under the agreement, the non-contract employees would accept
$50.5 million in wage cuts in exchange for more than 14 percent of
UAL Corp. if the union-led attempt to buy the airline succeeds.
   Settlement of the conflict between the union and non-union
employees represents another step toward putting together the
financing package needed to complete the $4.38 billion buyout
proposal, spokesmen for both groups said.
   ``I think this is a significant step forward,'' said Stephen
Fraidin, an attorney representing United's 25,700 non-contract
employees. ``It is an attractive and fair offer.''
   The United Employees Acquisition Corp., the entity formed by
employees to handle the buyout, has until Aug. 9 to secure
financing for the deal. A previous employee takeover effort ended
in failure in October.
   The agreement calls for the non-contract employees to own 14.26
percent of UAL.
   Previous reports indicated the non-contract employees would have
to accept wage cuts of about 7.7 percent, but Fraidin said the
$50.5 million in concessions represented a ``significantly lower''
percentage. He declined to provide the exact percentage.
   Unions representing the airline's pilots, mechanics and flight
attendants have all agreed to accept wage and benefit cuts in
exchange for stock in the company _ if their buyout bid succeeds.
The acquisition group said $2 billion in annual cost reductions is
needed to help offset buyout costs.
   UAL stock closed at $162.50 a share Wednesday in composite New
York Stock Exchange trading, up 50 cents.
   The non-contract employees, who make up one of the largest
segments of the airline's 71,000 employees, had objected to the
buyout proposal, saying they were not consulted. At the company's
annual shareholders meeting in April, non-contract employees called
their exclusion from the buyout plan ``rude, illegal and
undemocratic.''
   If workers succeed in this attempt to buy UAL, it would make the
company the nation's largest employee-owned firm.
   UAL is the parent of one of the nation's largest airlines,
headquartered in Elk Grove Village, a Chicago suburb.

   The Commodity Exchange on Wednesday named David
A. Halperin, executive vice president of the New York Mercantile
Exchange, as its new president.
   Halperin, 47, spent eight years at Comex before moving to the
energy exchange last December.
   Comex is the nation's largest gold, silver and copper exchange
but only the fourth largest futures exchange behind the Chicago
Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Nymex.
   Halperin most recently was an executive vice president at Comex
in charge of economics and research, new products development, the
exchange's computer center and other areas.
   He arrives at a time when Comex and Nymex are trying to work out
a merger and reportedly has been privy to negotations.A merger plan
is expected within months.
   Halperin succeeds Arnold Staloff, a former senior official at
the Philadelphia Stock Exchange who resigned May 1 after less than
a year at Comex. Before becoming an executive vice president at
Comex, Halperin served as a senior vice president and vice
president for finance and administration. Before joining Comex in
1981, he was controller of Columbia University for nine years and a
supervising accountant with Coopers &amp; Lybrand for six years.

   News Corp. said in a statement that it was told the Justice
Department would file court action seeking to block the deal on
antitrust grounds.
   But News Corp. and Rank Organisation will ``defend vigorously
against this action and expect, upon review of the facts, to
prevail so that the sale may go through,'' the statement said.
   The Rank Organization PLC, a British firm, operates The Film
House Group Inc. of Toronto, Canada, which prints feature-length
motion pictures for Hollywood studios.
   Deluxe Laboratories, based in Hollywood, is a unit of News
Corp's Fox Inc. subsidiary, which is involved in producing films
and television shows.
   The government said Film House and Deluxe would control 51
percent of the North American market if they were combined, based
on 1989 production figures.
   ``If permitted, the acquisition would eliminate competition
between two of the three leading laboratories in the North American
market for wide-release prints and dramatically increase
concentration in that market,'' said James F. Rill, assistant
attorney general for antitrust.
   Technicolor is the nation's largest movie printing laboratory.
The industry had sales of more than $140 million last year, the
department said.

   Prozac probably will continue to be widely
used for treating depression, despite a lawsuit charging that the
drug produced by Eli Lilly and Co. prompts suicidal behavior,
analysts said Wednesday.
   ``It's hard for me to see it destroying the potenial for the
product,'' said Mark Mayer, a drug analyst for the New York-based
investment firm Sanford C. Bernstein. ``I think this is still a
breakthrough antidepressant.''
   But others said the lawsuit may cast doubts on Prozac's
projected use as a ``wonder drug'' for obesity, smoking and other
obsessive-compulsive behaviors, analysts said.
   Prozac has helped Lilly enjoy record earnings this year and news
accounts have fueled speculation that the drug one day will be used
for a variety of human behavior problems.
   Rhonda Hala of New York sued Lilly on Tuesday for $150 million
in damages claiming she became suicidal and self-desctructive while
taking Prozac for depression following back surgery in 1988. She
also alleged the suicidal impulses disappeared after she stopped
taking the drug.
   On Tuesday, Lilly announced separately that the rapid growth of
Prozac was a primary reason its profit rose 26 percent to a record
$274 million in the second quarter.
   Prozac has been approved only for the treatment of depression.
However it is representative of a class of drugs, called
psychotropics, that experts believe could someday provide cures for
personality disorders such as overeating, smoking, alcoholism and
obsessive-compulsive disorders.
   Lilly spokeswoman Marie Abbot would not comment on the lawsuit's
implications for Prozac sales. However, she did note that more than
2 million patients have taken the drug for depression and that ``it
has been found to be a useful addition to the number of treatment
options available to physicians to treat their patients with
depression.''
   Abbot also said the company is not removing Prozac from the
market and said it has not been shown that the drug causes suicidal
thoughts.
   Ronald Nordmann, a drug industry analyst for the investment firm
PaineWebber Inc. in New York, said that given the annual suicide
rate for depression patients was 22 percent to 36 percent higher
than for the general population, it was not surprising that some
who took Prozac for depression might think about suicide.
   ``In my opinion, the lawsuit filed yesterday is trivial in
nature and won't cause any change in prescribing habits for this
drug,'' he said. ``I anticipate that this drug will continue to be
prescribed prudently for depressed patients who have found the
product to be very helpful and in whom the benefits greatly
outweigh the risks.''
   Nordmann and other analysts said they believed Lilly has been
candid about information linking Prozac to suicidal thoughts.
   ``They are being very cautious. They are reporting every single
side effect to the FDA. In May, Prozac's package insert was changed
to include six cases of suicidal ideation, or the increased
thoughts of committing suicide,'' Nordmann said.
   He also said the incidence of problems was fewer than three per
million patients.
   Prozac is used for about 25 percent of the nation's
prescriptions for antidepressants, the highest market share for any
product of its kind, Mayer said.
   ``It's a huge product and it's going to be a huger product,'' he
said.
   But Mayer said the suit may give the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration some concern about approving the drug for other
uses, such as treatment of obesity or alcoholism.
   Barbara Ryan, drug industry analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities in New York, also said she expected the FDA would act
much more cautiously in giving approval for use of Prozac to treat
other disorders.
   ``If there is a safety concern at the FDA, and there doesn't
appear to be one now, then the indications will have to be
medically important ones,'' she said.
   Ryan does not believe Lilly sales will suffer because of the
lawsuit and subsequent publicity about the drug. Some analysts have
predicted Prozac sales could reach $1 billion if treatment for
obesity were approved.
   Ryan said Prozac sales are expected to reach $750 million this
year, mainly because of treatment for depression.
   ``I still think that you can make a good strong case why this
would be a billion-dollar drug even without the other
indications,'' she said.

<HEAD>Merck Announces Second Quarter Earnings Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RAHWAY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merck &amp; Co., a leading pharmaceutical maker,
announced a 19 percent rise in second-quarter earnings Wednesday,
attributing the strength to higher sales of drugs to lower blood
pressure and cholesterol.
   Earnings for the three months ended June 30 totaled $470.2
million or $1.20 a share on sales of $1.9 billion, vs. earnings of
$396.6 million or $1 share on sales of $1.6 billion for the same
quarter last year.
   The average number of outstanding shares for the second quarter
declined to 391.3 million from 396.6 million in the same quarter
last year.
   For the first six months, earnings totaled $874 million or $2.23
a share on sales of $3.7 billion, up from $737 million or $1.86 a
share on sales of $3.2 billion for the same period in 1989.
   Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive officer, said
the sales growth for the first half was led by newer products, such
as Vasotec used in the treatment of high blood pressure and
congestive heart failure and Mevacor, a cholesterol-lowering drug.
Mevacor holds more than 60 percent of the U.S. market, the company
said.
   The six-month figures were boosted by sales of M-M-R II, the
company's combination vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella,
reflecting revised guidelines for vaccinations against measles.
   Ivermectin, Merck's drug for the prevention of heartworm disease
in dogs, ``continues its strong performance as the world's leading
animal health product,'' the company said.
   Merck has 34,000 employees, 17 research centers and
manufacturing plants in 18 countries.

<TEXT>
   Iraq warned fellow OPEC members on
Wednesday it viewed violations of the cartel's production quotas as
virtual acts of war, and accused neighboring Kuwait of stealing its
oil for the past decade.
   After meeting in emergency session, Kuwait's National Council,
or Parliament, issued a statement rejecting what it called the
Iraqi ``policy of violence, threats and blackmail.''
   It was the latest instance of bellicose behavior by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, although until now his muscle-flexing has
been aimed mainly at Israel and its chief ally, the United States.
   The accusations also represent a dramatic escalation in
Baghdad's campaign against fellow members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries who violate production quotas.
   OPEC, beset by disputes over production levels and prices, opens
its mid-year meeting in Geneva next Thursday.
   The collapse of oil prices, blamed largely on overproduction,
has cost Iraq billions of dollars in lost revenue at a time when it
was involved in the costly 1980-88 Persian Gulf war with Iran.
   Kuwait, which was one of Iraq's staunchest allies in that war,
called the emergency legislative session to discuss the Iraqi
accusations, and quickly began a diplomatic offensive. Iraq and
Kuwait have long disagreed over their border.
   Iraq's foreign minister, Tareq Aziz, claimed Kuwait had drilled
oil wells in Iraq's southern Rumaila field and pumped oil worth
$2.4 billion out of it since 1980. He said Baghdad expects Kuwait
to pay it back.
   ``We showed patience and prudence,'' Aziz said in a letter to
Arab League Secretary-General Chadli Klibi, which was read over
official Baghdad Radio and on state television. ``But things have
developed to a level which we can no longer ignore.''
   The Iraqi foreign minister renewed Iraq's accusations of
overproduction by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates and said such
actions were tantamount to ``military aggression against Iraq.''
   ``The attempts by the governments of Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates to flood the oil market ... is a premeditated and
deliberate plan to weaken Iraq and undermine its economy and
security,'' he declared.
   On Tuesday, Saddam threatened to retaliate against Kuwait and
the U.A.E. with force if necessary for quota violations. Iraq has a
1 million-man army. Kuwait, with only 1.7 million residents, has
20,300 members of the armed forces.
   In Kuwait City, the emirate's capital, the 75-member National
Council legislature was called into closed-door session to discuss
the Iraqi allegation.
   In its statement, the interim Parliament, formed earlier this
month, said Iraq should abide ``by the style of consultation,
understanding and conducting dialogue ... before hastening to
spread charges against Kuwait, or attempting to cast doubt on
Kuwait's national and humanitarian stands.''
   The statement recalled that Kuwait had suffered at the hands of
Iranian-backed terrorists for its support of Iraq in the Gulf War.
   Later, Kuwait's foreign minister, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed, flew to
Saudi Arabia, carrying a message for King Fahd. He also planned to
visit other members of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council that
groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and the United
Arab Emirates, the official Kuwait news agency reported.
   Two other government ministers were dispatched to 12 other Arab
League countries, including Egypt, Syria, Libya and Jordan, the
news agency said.
   It said Kuwait had begn a ``wide-scale campaign on the Arab
level to explain its viewpoint on the Iraqi complaint against it.''
   Gulf diplomatic sources, insisiting on anonymity, said Saudi
Arabia was considering summoning the Gulf Cooperation Council to an
emergency meeting over the issue.
   The sources said King Fahd had conferred by telephone with
Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, late Wednesday. Fahd
was expected to lead efforts to defuse tensions.
   Overproduction has helped drive prices down from the OPEC
benchmark of $18 a barrel to below $14 in recent weeks.
   Kuwait's quota is 1.5 million barrels a day, but it has been
producing as much as 1.9 million barrels daily. The U.A.E. has
produced up to 2.1 million barrels a day in recent months, more
than double its daily quota of 1.09 million barrels.
   Iraq, with oil reserves estimated at 110 billion barrels, wants
to eventually double its own production capacity to 7 million
barrels a day and push prices up to the $25 level.
   Saddam said Tuesday Iraq had lost $14 billion because of the
price slump. Iraq's foreign debt is estimated at $60 billion to $70
billion.
   In recent months, Saddam has been stridently critical of the
United States and its allies for what he perceives as a concerted
campaign to curb his effort to build an arsenal of high-technology
weapons, including long-range missiles.
   He claimed in April that Iraq has binary chemical weapons and
threatened to use them against Israel if it tried to attack Iraq.
   Iraq and Kuwait have never agreed on the demarcation of their
80-mile border since Kuwait gained its independence from Britain in
1961. At the time, the Iraqi government of Gen. Abdul Karim Kassem
refused to recognize Kuwait and the emirate called in British
troops for protection.
   Kassem was deposed in a February 1963 coup by the Baath Arab
Socialist Party, which insisted Kuwait was part of Iraq.

   Philip Morris Cos. Inc. said its second quarter
earnings soared 27.2 percent as all of its divisions chalked up
revenue gains.
   The food and tobacco company said it earned $948 million, or
$1.03 per share, up from $745 million, or 80 cents per share, in
the same period a year earlier.
   The company said its revenue rose 11.6 percent to $12.7 billion
from $11.4 billion in the second quarter of 1989.
   Philip Morris did not break down operating results for each of
its divisions, but it reported higher revenue and operating income
for each.
   The company's divisions include Philip Morris U.S.A. and Philip
Morris International, its cigarette businesses; Kraft General Foods
and Oscar Mayer, its food businesses; and Miller Brewing Co.
   Philip Morris recently announced plans to buy the candy and
coffee businesses of the Swiss firm Jacobs Suchard AG for $3.8
billion.
   For the first half, Philip Morris said its earnings rose 29.1
percent to $1.7 billion, or $1.86 per share, from $1.3 billion, or
$1.44 per share, in the first six months of 1989.
   First-half revenue rose 9.5 percent to $24.1 billion from $22
billion in the same period a year earlier.

<HEAD>Volcano, Weather Fears Fuel Coffee Rally</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Snow in Chile and a volcano in Guatemala helped boost coffee
futures prices Wednesday on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange, although neither event was believed to have damaged
coffee plants.
   On other commodity markets, near-term gasoline futures plunged
while other energy futures were mixed; most pork futures fell
sharply; cattle futures gained; grains and soybeans were mixed; and
precious metals were mixed.
   Raw coffee futures settled 1.5 cents to 1.7 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in September up 1.7 cents at 87.95 cents
a pound. The July contract expired at 85.8 cents, up 1.6 cents.
   Coffee futures rose from the opening bell amid reports of
volcanic activity in Guatemela that was initially believed to have
caused severe damage to the Central American nation's coffee crop.
   Subsequent reports contained lower damage estimates. Esther
Eskanasy, a coffee analyst with Cargill Investor Services Inc. who
was raised in Guatemala, said there could have been no crop damage
because Guatemalan growers harvested all their coffee earlier this
year.
   ``The volcano had some activity, but this is normal during this
period of time,'' she said.
   Eskanasy said coffee futures also were supported by technical
buy signals and by news that it had snowed in Santiago, Chile, for
the first time in many years.
   Chile is not a major coffee producer. But the wintry weather
fueled fears of frost damage to coffee crops in other South
American countries, notably Brazil, the world's largest producer.
   Crude oil futures slipped and wholesale gasoline for near-term
delivery dropped more than a penny a gallon following an industry
report that showed unexpectedly large stocks of both commodities.
Heating oil futures ended mixed.
   Energy futures rose sharply early in the day amid reports of
rising tensions between Iraq and Kuwait after the former accused
the latter of stealing its oil over the past decade.
   But profit-taking eroded the gains and the energy markets ended
at levels that reflected the supply levels reported Tuesday by the
American Petroleum Institute.
   The weekly API report showed an unexpected 4.7 million barrel
increase in U.S. stocks of crude oil, an unexpected 2 million
barrel increase in gasoline stocks and a 2.1 million barrel build
in distillate supplies.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 10 cents lower to 2
cents higher with August at $18.55 a barrel; heating oil was .25
cent lower to .15 cent higher with August at 56.11 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was 1.45 cents lower to .15 cent higher with
August at 62.67 cents a gallon.
   Frozen pork bellies for July and August delivery fell the
2-cents-a-pound daily limit on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on
selling prompted by slack demand for frozen bellies in light of the
lower prices being asked on the fresh market.
   Selling interest spilled over to the adjacent hog futures pit.
   Cattle futures ended mostly higher, reflecting stronger cash
markets.
   Live cattle futures settled .08 cent to .20 cents higher with
August at 76.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent lower to
.22 cent higher with August at 87.35 cents a pound; live hogs were
1.45 cents lower to .33 cent higher with July at 63.95 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .68 cent to 2 cents lower with July
at 48.50 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures rose on the Chicago Board of Trade for only the
second time in the last 10 trading sessions, reflecting to higher
soybean meal prices in Europe.
   Grain futures closed mostly lower on weather-related selling
that also limited gains in the soybean market, analysts said.
   A National Weather Service six-to-10-day forecast issued after
the close precicted mild, wet weather in the Corn Belt during the
period July 24-28.
   Wheat futures settled 1{ cents lower to 1\ cents higher with
July at $3.01 a bushel; corn futures were { cent to 2{ cents lower
with July at $2.72 a bushel; oats were unchanged to } cent lower
with July at $1.19 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 5 cents higher
with July at $6 a bushel.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold futures ended 50
cents to 90 cents lower with August at $362.50 a troy ounce; silver
was 6.7 cents to 7.4 cents higher with July at $4.884 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>API Says Oil Imports Reach All-Time High in First Six Months of

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation was more dependent on foreign oil
imports in the first six months of 1990 than ever before, the
American Petroleum Institute said Wednesday.
   From January to June, the United States got 49.9 percent of its
oil from other countries, API said. The previous six-month high was
48.8 percent during the first six months of 1977.
   In June, the United States imported 52.3 percent of its oil.
   The group said the country was relying on imports more because
domestic crude oil production had declined and a inventories were
built up.
   Edward Murphy, finance and statistics director of the petroleum
group, said the figures signal ``worrisome, even potentially
ominous trends in the American energy environment.''
   ``This situation is bad and is going to get worse,'' said Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas. ``Realistically, we cannot expect to
eliminate our trade deficit as long as our dependence on foreign
oil is increasing at this rate.''
   The United States produced 6 percent less oil than it did during
the same six months of 1989. About 7.3 million barrels of oil per
day were produced from January to June, the lowest level in 29
years.
   Without Alaska, oil production from January to June fell to 5.5
million barrels per day, the lowest level in 40 years.
   While the country is relying more on oil imports, it is
consuming less oil overall. Consumption fell 2.5 percent compared
to the same period a year ago, the institute said.
   Part of that is due to unusually warm weather nationwide, the
institute said. But Murphy added, ``This size of this decrease is
larger than we would have expected, given the slow but positive
growth in the economy and the fact that petroleum product prices
remain low relative to the levels of several years ago.''
   The institute said demand increased for only one oil product,
kerosine jet fuel.

   Safety and police groups asked the government
Wednesday to bar radar detectors in interstate trucks, citing new
evidence suggesting that as many as half the truck drivers in some
states use the detectors as a defense against being nabbed for
speeding.
   Eight groups, including the nation's largest trucking group,
signed a petition to the Federal Highway Administration to ban what
they called electronic ``partners in crime'' in all commercial
vehicles in interstate commerce.
   ``The only reason you'd want to have one in a truck is to drive
faster than you ought to,'' said Tom Donohue, president of American
Trucking Associations, which represents 4,500 truck companies.
   Groups supporting the use of detectors criticized the petition,
saying the dashtop units protect motorists against speed traps and
police errors.
   ``The government can't limit a citizen's use of a radar detector
any more than it can limit the use of an AM-FM radio,'' said Jason
Richards of the Ohio-based Radio Association Defending Airwave
Rights, or RADAR.
   A study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which
drafted the petition, found that between 33 percent and 47 percent
of all trucks, and 37 percent to 52 percent of semitrailers in a
recent seven-state survey were using radar detectors.
   Tom Larson, federal highway administrator, said the agency had
received the petition and would review it.
   The Reagan administration rejected a similar move in 1988,
saying that such laws should be left to the states. But the new
petition includes a representative of state highway safety
officials: Peter O'Rourke, chairman of the National Association of
Governors' Highway Safety Representatives.
   ``The climate has changed considerably,'' said Brian O'Neill,
insurance institute president. A meeting on highway safety called
by Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner earlier this year in
Chicago endorsed action against radar detectors, he said.
   ``Increasing speed is occurring on our highways, and it is
getting increasingly difficult for police to enforce speed
limits,'' O'Neill said. ``When a big truck or bus crashes, the
results are disastrous, usually affecting other motorists.''
   Other groups signing the petition were the American Automobile
Association, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the
National Safety Council, the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety
and Public Citizen.
   Only Connecticut, Virginia and the District of Columbia outlaw
detectors in all vehicles; New York has passed a law banning them
in larger trucks. They are legal in all other states, with about 2
million sold each year.
   James Baxter, head of the National Motorists Association in
Dane, Wis., which defends radar detectors and opposes the 55
mile-per-hour speed limit, said the petition was part of an effort
to get all radar detectors banned.
   He said there was no evidence directly linking radar detectors
and accidents.
   Chuck Hurley of the insurance institute said no study had been
made of the detectors' involvement in accidents, but he said
studies do tie speed to highway deaths and the new institute survey
shows that truckers using radar detectors are more likely than
those without detectors to drive faster than 70 mph.
   The study was based on the use of a new detector that can
identify vehicles using the units.
   The institute's checks of highways in seven states showed usage
of detectors by tractor-trailer trucks ranging from at least 37
percent in Virginia, where detectors are outlawed, to 52 percent in
Delaware.
   Other results included 38 percent in Maryland and New York; 40
percent for Connecticut, where they also are outlawed; 41 percent
in New Jersey and 46 percent in Pennsylvania.
   Another 7 percent to 27 percent of the truckers, depending on
the state, were possibly using the units, the study said.

   The Senate approved a landmark civil rights
bill Wednesday night after the Bush administration and Democratic
sponsors failed to reach a compromise plan to fight job
discrimination without inviting hiring quotas.
   ``Quotas, schmotas! The issue is job discrimination,'' exclaimed
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., as the Senate approved the
measure, 65-34, over threats of a veto.
   All 55 Democrats voted for the bill. Republicans voted against
34-10 with one not voting.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, traveling with
President Bush in Anaheim, Calif., said the administration was
disappointed by the vote.
   ``We'll work to change it in the House. We still want a bill we
can sign,'' Fitzwater said.
   In a written statement later, Fitzwater also said, ``The
president wants a bill that ends discrimination, not one that
starts a quota system.''
   The measure is the top priority of the civil rights movement in
Congress this year and would overturn five Supreme Court decisions.
   The House Judiciary Committee is expected to take action on its
version of the measure within days.
   Kennedy told reporters after the vote that the strong support on
the floor for the bill suggested that the Senate might ultimately
override a veto. ``This is not quota legislation, this is
anti-discrimination legislation,'' he said.
   Bush has said a number of times that he wants to sign a civil
rights bill but would not do so if it would lead to hiring quotas.
   Tempers frayed again on the floor Wednesday night as they had
earlier in the week, underscoring lingering Republican bitterness
over the success of Democratic sponsors in cutting short debate.
   GOP leaders retaliated with an adroit tactical move that blocked
action on amendments sought by moderate Democrats, such as a plan
to cap the amount of punitive damages that could be recovered by
discrimination victims.
   Kennedy said he still would like to make a deal with Bush and in
any case hopes that the president will relent and sign the bill.
   Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas again complained that the
bill was ``being shoved down my throat'' and renewed his warning
that the measure would inevitably lead to hiring quotas for members
of minority groups.
   Provisions range from a ban on racial harrassment in the
workplace to punitive damages for victims of the most serious forms
of discrimination.
   Most of the controversy, however, came over a provision makaing
it easeier to challenge employment practices whose effects fall
disproportionately on minority groups.
   The Supreme Court's decision in a case involving hiring at a
salmon cannery in Alaska held that such practices do not violate
the law unless those filing suit can show they were not motivated
by business necessity.
   The bill would require the companies involved, if challenged in
court, to prove that the practices were prompted by business
necessity.
   The Bush administration said the definition of business
necessity in the bill _ having ``a significant relationship to
successful performance of the job'' _ would prompt employers to
adopt minority hiring quotas to insulate themselves from lawsuits.
   Kennedy and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu were hung up
for weeks in efforts to reach a compromise on the definition.
``Every combination of words was tried,'' Sen. John C. Danforth,
R-Mo., said glumly.
   ``We are now proceeding on the road to a certain veto,''
Danforth declared. ``This is a bill that can do a lot of good for a
lot of people and it is going nowhere.''
   Nothing in the bill requires the use of hiring quotas. But many
Republicans business critics say companies would be fearful not to
use quotas under the measure. ``It is a bad bill because it is a
quota bill,'' said Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif.
   He said company lawyers would tell executives: ``Better make
certain that your percentage of the workforce matches the
percentage of available applicants.''
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., raised the possibility that companies
might ``rush like lemmings into an ocean of quotas.'' He also said
the damages provision ``makes sure there are plenty of bucks out
there to satisfy a few very, very greedy lawyers.''
   Kennedy said, however, that the measure would merely return the
law to what it was before the Supreme Court's decision last year
and it had not caused companies to use quotas in the past.
   ``The false hue and cry of quotas is a disservice to the
president of the United Stateds, a disreputable tactic by those who
don't care about civil rights for women and minorities,'' Kennedy
said.
   Bush had said repeatedly that he wanted to sign legislation to
combat discrimination in the workplace. But he said he would not
sign ``a quota bill.''
   The last negotiating session between Kennedy and Sununu broke up
on Capitol Hill at midnight on Tuesday and Bush himself enlisted
Danforth and two other moderate Republicans to take a final
compromise offer to the Senate on Wednesday morning.
   Conservatives also had sought to rally around an alternative
version sponsored by Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum, R-Kan., but Dole
said that it became clear that the measure ``didn't have the
votes.''
