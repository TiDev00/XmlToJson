<TEXT>
   President Bush on Friday claimed
progress in the war on drugs, saying ``The days of the drug lords
... are numbered,'' and asking TV producers to help portray the
destructive potential of narcotics.
   Bush compared anti-drug efforts to nations casting out
oppressive governments, saying, ``people across America are casting
off the oppression of drugs.''
   ``Week by week, day by day, millions of Americans in thousands
of towns are standing up to make the same courageous choice:
drug-free neighorhoods, drug-free schools. Drug-free kids,'' he
told several thousand school children at a rally sponsored by
Orange County's ``Drug Use is Life Abuse'' program.
   Earlier, in Los Angeles, Bush urged television industry
producers to make anti-drug themes part of their programming.
   He called on the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences to make
TV ``a force for positive change.''
   At the celebrity-studded Santa Anna rally attended by 15,000
people, movie star Chuck Norris pledged to conquer drug traffickers
in his next film.
   The president broke the news of a massive local drug bust,
nearly a half ton of cocaine worth $30 million on the street. The
Orange County sheriff's office said it would not be able to release
details on the street, but according to Lt. Dick Olson, Bush's
remarks would not hurt the prosecution.
   Bush told the Santa Ana rally that the ``Drug Abuse is Life
Abuse'' message ``is beginning to sink in.''
   ``Recently we have seen some scattered but hopeful new signs of
progress against the horror of drugs,'' he said, citing anti-drug
community efforts around the country.
   He said cases against 14 accused international drug traffickers
are pending in U.S. courts following their extraditions.
   ``The days of the drug lords may not be over yet. But their days
are numbered,'' Bush said.
   Bush's optimistic assessment on drug-war progress comes as his
administration seeks $10.6 billion from Congress to combat drugs in
fiscal 1991.
   Administration officials including Bush's drug policy director,
William Bennett, recently have been claiming there are signs of a
turnaround in the country's drug abuse problem.
   ``We've covered a lot of ground in the drug war. But tough
challenges remain,'' Bush told the Santa Ana rally. ``Drug abuse in
this country is still far too widespread.''
   Continuing his lobbying for widespread community support, Bush
praised the television industry for anti-drug commercials and for
programming that portrays the negative side of drugs.
   ``Thank goodness the days when popular culture glorified and
glamorized drug use are fading fast,'' he said.
   He said he did not seek TV depiction of ``a fantasy world where
drugs don't exist,'' but rather treatment of drugs ``with the same
degree of realism TV brings to so many other subjects ... To show
in the real world how drugs destroy.''
   Bush sandwiched the anti-drug events into a four-day California
trip that was primarily oriented to Republican Party politicking
and a meeting with Japan's Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   Friday's rally featured appearances by Los Angeles Rams
cheerleaders and remarks by TV evangelist Robert Schuller.
   The anti-drug events Friday followed Bush's appearance at a
California Chamber of Commerce dinner Thursday night where he
called on businesses to pre-screen job applicants for drug use.
   ``We need to make it very clear, to every American, that if you
do drugs, you don't get hired,'' he said.
   ``So-called casual users and their money keep these merchants of
death in business,'' he said.
   ``America now condemns what has too long been condoned. The
country has had enough,'' he declared.

<HEAD>Housing Authority To Change Policies Regarding Unmarried Couples</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS lead, 8th graf, `Brown hailed...,' to clarify that
policy affects all public housing.</NOTE>

   A housing policy that denied an
unmarried couple a place to live because of their relationship will
be revised, the state's American Civil Liberties Union chapter said
Thursday.
   The tentative agreement with the Woonsocket Housing Authority,
which needs the approval of U.S. District Judge Ronald R. Lagueux,
would consider unmarried couples a ``family'' if they meet certain
criteria, including the length of the relationship, whether the
applicants have children together, and the existence of joint bank
accounts.
   ``We're going to review our policies and make some changes,''
said Ernest Lafond, the housing authority's director, who rferred
other questions to his attorney.
   The new policy stems from a lawsuit filed by Susan Arseneau and
Dana Dagnese, who sued after they were denied emergency housing in
December 1988 following their eviction from an unsafe apartment.
   ``A married couple in the same building was given emergency
housing by the WHA, while the plaintiffs were turned down for such
housing solely because the agency did not consider them a
`family,''' said Steve Brown, executive director of the ACLU's
Rhode Island affiliate.
   Arseneau and Dagnese had lived together for six years and were
expecting their third child when they were evicted.
   The case drew national attention when Lagueux, at a hearing a
year ago at which he denied an emergency restraining order against
enforcement of the policy, said, ``Here's a couple in an illicit
relationship who are creating children for the welfare rolls, while
others who qualify for housing are shunted aside.''
   Brown hailed the pending agreement, which affects all public
housing, as a blow to discrimination against unmarried couples.
   ``Resolution of this lawsuit will simply affirm a growing trend
across the country, in which housing authorities are recognizing
that discrimination on the basis of marital status is unfair and
inappropriate,'' he said.
   But the attorney for the housing authority, Steve Rodio, said
the main reason the couple was evicted was because Dagnese was
legally married to another woman at the time.
   Rodio said Dagnese's marriage to someone else prompted Lagueux
to cite the state's criminal statute against bigamy, and said if
the agency had let the couple stay in the apartment it would have
``encouraged'' a potentially bigamous relationship.
   ``Whether he was single or not wouldn't have mattered,'' said
John Dineen, the couple's lawyer. ``The existing rule is you have
to be married to each other'' to live together.
   Dagnese was awaiting his divorce in Massachusetts after having
been ``separated for many years'' when he and Arseneau were
evicted, said Dineen.
   The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and Rhode Island Legal Services
on behalf of Arseneau and Dagnese, claimed the agency's action
violated the couple's constitutional rights to freedom of
association, family privacy and equal protection under the law.
Dineen also said the policy was in violation of federal and state
housing laws.
   Dineen and Rodio didn't know when Lagueux would rule on the
agreement, nor whether the couple still wanted to live in city
housing.
   ``They're still seeking housing, and they continue to want to be
together,'' Dineen said.

   President Bush, opening a two-day
desert summit, assured Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu on
Friday that a cutback of U.S. troops in Asia will not undermine
stability or security there, an official said.
   The two leaders avoided discussing Japan's huge trade surplus
and the growing trade tensions between the world's largest economic
powers, leaving those subjects for Saturday.
   ``Welcome, sir,'' a smiling Bush said as he shook hands with
Kaifu across a conference table at a posh country club.
   Despite the economic conflicts, Bush emphasized the positive in
his opening remarks, noting, ``There are so many areas of common
interest where we have such a strong relationship with Japan.''
   The very fact that Kaifu responded to his invitation for the
hastily arranged meeting was an ``important display of your
feelings about our relationship,'' Bush said.
   ``Certainly my inviting you here is a strong indication from us
about the importance of this relationship,'' Bush said.
   The two leaders met for an hour before gathering again for
dinner at the heavily guarded estate of millionaire publisher
Walter Annenberg.
   Emerging from a one-on-one meeting, Bush said, ``We had a very
good discussion.''
   There was no sign of friction, although White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush would warn the prime minister
that Congress was in ``very tough mood'' in insisting that Japan
lower barriers to U.S. goods and services.
   In a statement afterward, Fitzwater said the opening session was
devoted to security issues.
   The United States is considering reducing its 120,000 troops in
Asia by about 10 percent. That would mean a reduction of 5,000
troops in Japan.
   In addition, Washington is pressing Tokyo for a sizeable
increase in Japan's $2.4 billion annual support for American troops
stationed in the country.
   Bush told Kaifu that the changes in the U.S. defense posture
``will not affect either deterrence or stability, nor its
commitment to its Asian allies,'' Fitzwater said.
   Referring to U.S. hopes that Japan will increase defense
spending, Fitzwater said, ``The two leaders discussed the issue of
burden sharing, noting the need for suitable arrangements for
balanced cost-sharing.''
   Fitzwater said Kaifu ``stressed the importance to coordinate our
policies and tackle the issues from the standpoint of mutual
cooperation.''
   Shigeo Takenaka, deputy spokesman for the Japanese foreign
ministry, said that to solve the difficult trade issues, ``We must
continue to strengthen cooperation in other areas,'' such as aid to
Latin America and the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe.
   ``We certainly didn't sense any ambush here,'' he said when
asked whether the Americans were coming down hard on Tokyo over
trade.
   The meeting room at Morningside Country Club was decked out in
two large floral arrangements and overlooked landscaped gardens and
manicured lawns that contrasted sharply with the barren nearby
desert and snow-covered mountains in the distance.
   The meeting room at Morningside Country Club was decked out in
two large floral arrangements and overlooked landscaped gardens and
manicured lawns that contrasted sharply with the barren nearby
desert and snow-covered mountains in the distance.
   Bush and his guest were to dine informally at the sprawling,
heavily guarded estate of millionaire publisher Walter Annenberg.
   Bush and Kaifu both arrived in nearby Palm Springs Los Angeles
within minutes of each other and rode in from the airport together
in the president's armored limosine.
   During the 25-minute ride Bush congratulated Kaifu on his
election victory last month and ``emphasized the importance of our
security relationship,'' Fitzwater said.
   The president will stress the importance of opening Japan's
markets and emphasize the possibility of U.S. sanctions if action
isn't forthcoming to cool tensions between the world's largest
economic powers, Fitzwater said.
   In Los Angeles earlier, Bush himself said of Kaifu, ``We've got
to convince him that we've got to move forward with some of the
tough problems.''
   Still, there was concern in both Washington and Tokyo that the
hastily arranged meeting had raised unrealistic expectations about
a breakthrough in trade conflicts.
   Economists of all persuasions and the administration admit that
even if Japan abolished all trade restrictions of which the United
States has complained, the major part of Japan's $49 billion annual
trade surplus with the United States would remain because of
American appetites for cars, electronics and other high-quality
Japanese goods.
   ``I don't think we expect any action on the major issues before
us,'' Fitzwater said. ``I could be surprised.''
   U.S. business leaders also said they expected no breakthrough
but raised the possibility that the discussions could set the stage
for a full-fledged trade summit between the two leaders later in
the year.
   Congressional sources said they understood Kaifu might be
prepared to offer some small concessions in an effort to show
progress in the trade talks.
   One congressional source, who spoke on condition that his name
not be used, said that Kaifu was expected to propose lower tariffs
on a portion of U.S. finished wood products although the reduction
would cover only a small portion of U.S. lumber sales to Japan.
   Wood products, satellites and supercomputers are three key areas
where negotiators have been focusing their attention in an effort
to lower Japanese barriers to sales of American products.
   Kaifu flew to Palm Springs in response to an invitation issued
by Bush during a middle-of-the-night telephone call last Friday.
   Asserting itself, Congress has imposed deadlines for talks on a
dozen issues ranging from supercomputers to lumber and even the
cultural foundations of the two societies.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said this week the
U.S.-Japanese relationship was ``at a difficult point and needs to
have the highest level of attention.''
   For its part, Japan wants the United States to reduce its huge
budget deficit and increase Americans' savings rate, thus reducing
demands for Japanese imports.
   Kaifu's standing in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is
considered tenuous, and a successful summit could bolster his
status.
   Last May, the United States put Japan on a trade ``hit list''
for alleged unfair barriers to American wood products, satellites
and supercomputers.
   The administration has until June 16 to negotiate a removal of
the barriers. If negotiations fail, the administration can impose
retaliatory tariffs which Japan argues would violate international
rules on fair trade.

<HEAD>Ceausescu's Planned Headquarters Open to Public</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN PETREANU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The doors of deposed dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu's palatial planned headquarters were opened to the public
for the first time, evoking awe and outrage from the visitors.
   About 2,000 Romanians paid about 25 cents each on Thursday to
enter the unfinished, monumental House of the Republic, one of the
world's largest buildings, situated on a man-made hill in the heart
of the capital.
   In groups and individually, they shuffled through the mammoth
ballrooms, meeting halls, amphitheatres, living suites and offices.
   They gawked at hundreds of marble columns, red velvet drapes,
extensive gold ornamentation and diamond-studded chandeliers,
including one said to be the biggest in Europe, in 800-seat Column
Hall. Ushers urged visitors not to touch the elegant furniture.
   The massive building, built entirely with local materials, was
meant to house the leading bodies of the state and Communist Party,
and included imperial suites for the dictatorial couple, Ceausescu
and his wife, Elena.
   The municipality has not yet decided what to do with the
building, which has cost $1 billion over six years of construction.
   One of the reasons for the open house, which is to last two
months, is to solicit suggestions from the public.
   So far, according to Chief Engineer Alexander Baumgarten, ``The
most popular suggestions are making it an international conference
and exhibition center, or a sort of home for Romania's artists.''
   Some people, finding the building's extravagance offensive in
this impoverished country, have also proposed destroying it.
   But Baumgarten, who headed the building's quality-control team
until construction ceased when Ceausescu was overthrown Dec. 22, is
lobbying hard for the building to be finished.
   He said it can be completed in two years with another $200
million to $250 million.
   ``In addition to food and shelter, we need beauty in our lives.
What would the world be without art museums and palaces?''
   ``We admit the exterior is less attractive, because the former
president imposed his views on the architects,'' sighed Baumgarten.
``But if you take an architecture textbook and inspect the
ornaments and columns in the interior, you will see that this is,
in fact, a monumental work of art.''
   He proudly reeled off the building's vital statistics: two huge
halls, two amphitheatres, 60 large salons, 540 offices, and another
thousand-odd smaller rooms. Including its three underground levels,
the building reaches a maximum height of 100 yards.
   The total surface area of the sprawling structure, at 360,000
square yards, is ``three times bigger than the Versailles Palace
and also bigger than the Pentagon,'' said Baumgarten.
   The palace, wryly dubbed the House of the People by the Romanian
press, is only one of several unfinished buildings in an area known
as the Civic Center, encompassing several square miles where 15,000
buildings once stood. They were razed over the past decade by
Ceausescu's master builders.
   At the height of the construction, 20,000 workers a day entered
the building, with en estimated million workers in the project over
the past six years.
   But for the average citizen, the building site was strictly
off-limits.
   On Thursday, they shuffled through on wooden planks laid out on
the wall-to-wall carpeting, most staring in silent awe at the
extravagant luxury, which evoked both angry indignation and
patriotism.
   In the vast, empty Romania Hall, an old woman commanded foreign
journalists to ``write more, take more pictures ... to show what
beautiful things we, Romanians, can create.''
   Others were less enthusiastic.
   One middle-aged man silently shook his head in Ceausescu's huge
``relaxing room,'' last visited by the dictator on Dec. 10.
   ``While we starved, while we had no heating at night, he built
this unbelievable monument to himself and Elena.''
   Mrs. Ceausescu's adjacent room was slightly smaller but more
ornate, with lace curtains and elaborate wood carvings rimmed with
gold studs.
   ``Monstrous,'' said another man. ``He must have hated us
horribly.''
   ``No, it wasn't hate,'' said another woman. ``We were in the
grip of an unspeakable insanity.''

<TEXT>
   An economist who favors selling off
state enterprises and cutting the number of public employees has
been named to Brazil's most powerful Cabinet post.
   The newly created Economy Ministry was created by merging the
finance and planning ministries.
   Zelia Cardoso de Mello, an advocate of free-market reforms, was
named Thursday by President-elect Fernando Collor de Mello. The two
are not related.
   ``This is a sign of confidence, not only in me personally but in
a new generation,'' said Ms. Cardoso de Mello, 36.
   At a news conference called to announce the appointment, the
president-elect said, ``This is an unprecedented challenge. For the
first time in Latin American history, a woman will steer the
economic destiny of a great nation.''
   He said her top priority will be to fight inflation, now running
at more than 70 percent per month.
   Ms. Cardoso de Mello said the new administration's economic
program will include cuts in government subsidies, selling off of a
number of state-run companies, cracking down on tax cheats and a
tough new law to punish ``abusers of economic power.'' She gave few
details.
   Ms. Cardoso de Mello said the number of ministries would be
reduced from 23 to 12, and an undisclosed number of public
employees would be fired.
   She said Brazil's $114 billion foreign debt, largest in the
Third World, could be reduced through ``debt-for-equity swaps,''
whereby creditors receive shares in publicly owned firms in
exchange for debt.
   She promised better relations with the International Monetary
Fund and a renegotiation of debt payments ``based on new
instruments of reducing debt service, refinancing of late interest
payments and new money.''
   Brazil stopped paying capital on the debt in 1983 and quietly
suspended interest payment last September to protect its
international currency reserves.
   Her appointment was widely expected. Cardoso de Mello was the
president-elect's chief economic adviser during last year's
campaign and has headed a team preparing economic measures to be
put into effect after he takes office March 15.
   She has no previous government experience except a brief stint
at a midlevel post in the Finance Ministry during the
administration of Jose Sarney.

<TEXT>
   An ex-Air Force pilot who admitted selling
high-level secrets to an FBI undercover officer posing as a Soviet
agent has pleaded guilty to espionage charges.
   Authorities said Ronald Craig Wolf, 34, received only a partial
payment before his arrest in Dallas. He entered the plea Wednesday
to the federal charges of selling secrets in mid-1989 to a
government agent he knew by the code name ``Sergei Kitin.''
   U.S. District Judge Sidney Fitzwater has set sentencing for
April 20.
   Discharged from the Air Force in 1981 for ``financial
irresponsibility,'' Wolf had earlier pleaded innocent to the
charges.
   Wolf, a Waco native, agreed to plead guilty in exchange for a
reduction in the severity of the charges. He now faces a maximum of
10 years in prison but could have received life imprisonment before
the plea bargain.
   The former pilot was arrested nine months ago after contacting a
man he thought represented the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C.,
more than 15 times between March 9 and May 5. Federal court records
show Wolf relayed classified documents concerning top-secret signal
intelligence.
   Wolf told the purported Soviet agent that he wanted to sell
classified military documents ``for monetary gain and to get
revenge for his treatment by the United States government,''
according to an affidavit filed in connection with the case.

   Here are some facts about the Seabrook
nuclear plant:
   PROJECT ANNOUNCED: After shelving an earlier proposal in 1969,
Public Service Company of New Hampshire announced Feb. 1, 1972,
that it planned to build two nuclear reactors at Seabrook, the
first to start operating commercially in 1979, the second in 1981.
The utility initially estimated the entire project would cost less
than $1 billion.
   LOCATION: On land surrounded by marshes less than two miles from
Hampton Beach, little more than two miles north of Massachusetts
and about 40 miles north of Boston.
   CONSTRUCTION BEGAN: July 7, 1976.
   CONSTRUCTION COMPLETED: Unit 1: July 31, 1986, at cost of more
than $4.3 billion; Unit 2: canceled 1986, 25 percent complete.
   NUCLEAR FUEL LOADED: October 1986.
   COST TO DATE: $6.5 billion as of Thursday; post-completion costs
have been for financing and operations.
   DESIGN: Pressurized-water reactor.
   MANUFACTURERS: Reactor and steam supply system: Westinghouse.
Generator: General Electric.
   OUTPUT: 1,150 megawatts, enough electricity for about 1 million
homes.
   WORK FORCE: During peak construction, more than 8,000; now,
1,475, including some contract employees.
   DEMONSTRATIONS: Began before ground-breaking in 1976, peaked in
late 1970s, continue to present. Overall, there have been more than
3,200 arrests in anti-Seabrook protests.

   Despite the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's decision to issue a
license to the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear plant, many other reactors
in the United States remain candidates for closure. No utility has
planned a new plant since the 1970s.
   Here is a list of some other troubled nuclear plants in the
United States:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SHOREHAM: A fully licensed plant on heavily populated Long
Island about 50 miles east of New York City, Shoreham has never
operated commercially. The plant would be scrapped without ever
operating under an agreement reached in May 1988 between New York
State and the Long Island Lighting Co. The Bush administration,
fighting the plan, wants Shoreham mothballed _ left intact with
radioactive material in place _ rather than torn down.

   THREE MILE ISLAND: Cleanup operations continue on TMI's damaged
reactor more than 10 years after the nation's worst commercial
nuclear accident. The undamaged sister reactor, TMI Unit 1, which
was shut down during the March 1979 accident, was restarted in 1985.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SHIPPINGPORT: The nation's first commercial reactor, which began
operations in 1957, has become the world's first commercial reactor
to be dismantled. Federal officials intend to remove all
radioactive material so the site in western Pennsylvania can be
returned to unrestricted use. The reactor was sealed in concrete,
loaded aboard a barge and sent on a 8,100-mile journey via the Ohio
and Mississippi Rivers and the Panama Canal to a disposal site in
Hanford, Wash., last year.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PILGRIM: This Massachusetts plant, cited by the NRC in April
1986 as ``one of the worst-run'' nuclear plants in the country, was
authorized to begin a gradual restart in December 1988, more than
two years after the NRC shut the facility due to maintenance and
management problems. State officials since have asked the NRC to
suspend the plant's operating license, citing inadequate evacuation
plans and potential health problems for nearby residents.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   RANCHO SECO: Voters in the Sacramento, Calif., area decided in a
June 1988 referendum to close the long-plagued Rancho Seco plant
and the operating utility shut down operations a day later. Recent
proposals to revive the reactor by selling the plant to another
operator have been rejected.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PEACH BOTTOM: The two Peach Bottom reactors in Pennsylvania were
shut down by the NRC in March 1987 after federal investigators
found plant operators sleeping on duty. A month earlier, a nuclear
industry watchdog group had called the plant a national
embarrassment, citing poor procedures and management. The
Philadelphia Electric Co. overhauled plant operations and the
reactors went back into service in last year.

<TEXT>
   TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY: All five of TVA's operating reactors
were shut down in 1985 for safety improvements and the first one
back in operation, Sequoyah Unit 2, did not restart until May 1988.
TVA had to cancel plans to build eight other reactors and
construction already under way on four others was slowed.

   PALO VERDE: Licensed in 1985, Palo Verde was the first nuclear
plant of what was hoped would be a standardized design that would
speed the regulatory process. But management and training
deficiencies led to problems that have shut down the three reactors
almost as often as they have been running. The NRC has fined the
Arizona Nuclear Power Project $810,000 since 1983 for deficiencies
in plant operations, and sent a special diagnostic team last fall
to study the facility's problems.

   The opposition victory in Nicaragua
strips El Salvador's leftist rebels of their only government ally
in Central America and tests the mettle of the regional peace
process.
   The Nicaraguan conflict has absorbed most of the energy of the
negotiations since their outset in 1987. Suddenly the war is all
but over _ and that leaves El Salvador in the spotlight.
   The full implications of the Sandinista defeat remain to be
seen, but it is clearly a blow to the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front.
   El Salvador's rightist president, Alfredo Cristiani, was elated
by the outcome of the Nicaraguan election.
   ``The FMLN is going to be left isolated like Mr. (Fidel) Castro
in Cuba,'' he said of the rebel front that has been battling a
series of U.S.-backed governments in El Salvador since 1979.
   The FMLN has long counted on Managua for logistical and
political support.
   The Salvadoran rebel front has offices in Managua, uses
Nicaragua for safe haven and, according to U.S. officials,
maintains a vital radio installation that serves as a command and
control center for guerrillas in the field.
   Nicaragua, which has the only leftist government in Central
America, is also a source of arms for the FMLN, although the
details are hotly debated.
   The United States and the Salvadoran government insist that
Nicaragua is a crucial source of weapons. The Sandinistas and the
FMLN dispute this.
   The FMLN, one of the best-organized and highly motivated rebel
forces in the world, can fight on if Nicaragua's new, pro-U.S.
government evicts them after taking office April 25. But the battle
will be harder.
   ``The loss of the only sympathetic government in the region
clearly is serious for the FMLN,'' Richard Fagen, the director of
Ltin American Studies at Stanford University and an international
observer during the election.
   Some observers say the end of the Nicaraguan war and the
electoral loss of the Sandinistas might pave the way for a
negotiated solution in El Salvador, where a decade of war has
claimed an estimated 73,000 lives. Others say it might make the
situation even more intractable.
   ``Maybe there will be a new focusing of attention, a high
priority on Salvadoran peace prospects,'' said former President
Jimmy Carter, another election observer.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said he was afraid the
Sandinistas would pour arms into El Salvador before leaving office
on April 25.
   Dodd, an election observer, also said he feared hard-liners in
the Salvadoran military and government might abandon the idea of
negotiating, assuming the Sandinista loss was such a blow to the
FMLN that battlefield victory is now possible.
   Much depends on Washington, which has poured $4 billion into El
Salvador in a decade to fend off an FMLN victory.
   Fagen said the United States will have to pressure the rightist
government into serious talks with the FMLN.
   ``The only way to do this is to take a very active role with the
Salvadoran army,'' he said.
   ``The United States in Central America has never been able to
exercise its full power over local governments when it didn't have
substantial control over the army.''
   One good sign for the peace process is the prospect of better
relations between Honduras and Nicaragua if the 10,000-man
U.S.-financed Contra army in Honduran border camps demobilizes.
   If the new Nicaraguan government manages to exert control over
the Sandinista army _ a 150,000-member giant armed by the Soviet
bloc _ regional tensions also should cool.
   Another strong motivation to continue the process is economic
recovery. War has sapped the regional economies and frightened away
investors, condemning millions of people to poverty.
   New Honduran President Rafael Callejas has been hoping get his
nation's staggering economy going again, but like everyone elese in
the region, the fundamental condition is peace.
   The prime mover of the Central American peace process, Costa
Rican President Oscar Arias, will be leaving office soon, but a
peaceful transition of power in Nicaragua could go a long way
towards helping the region reach the goal for which he won the
Nobel Peace Prize.
   After the election, Arias said El Salvador should follow
Nicaragua's example and seek a negotiated solution to the war that
has claimed an estimated 73,000 lives.
   He said events in Nicaragua should ``send a message to El
Salvador: there is no sympathy in the world for those seek power
through violence.''
   Both the Cristiani government and the FMLN have said they are
willing to talk but they are poles apart. The last attempt at
negotiations ended in mid-November when the rebels launched a
month-long offensive.
   The FMLN high command has praised the Sandinistas and President
Daniel Ortega for holding the election here and advancing the cause
of democracy.
   ``We will redouble our struggle for an authentic democracy in El
Salvador, for which so much blood has been shed by our people,''
the high command said after the election.

<HEAD>Kids to Supreme Court: `You're Better Than `Night Court''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court is even better than ``Night
Court'' on TV, and it would be neat to be a member, say some of the
hundreds of school kids who wrote to the court to help celebrate
its 200th anniversary.
   The court received multicolored and hand-printed cards from
elementary school students around the country as it marked its
bicentennial last month.
   ``Roses are red, violets are blue. Supreme Court is great, and a
happy birthday to you,'' wrote Brandi Bryant, a fourth-grader from
Grafton, Va.
   Classmate Billy Francavilla told the justices, ``You're better
than `Night Court,''' a television show.
   And Grafton fourth-grader Kristi Downs, who probably doesn't
know anyone who's 200, wrote to say, ``You're lucky to still be
around.''
   Perhaps the biggest compliment came from Blytheville, Ark.,
where Presbyterian Christian Academy sixth-grader Scott Green
wrote: ``It would be neat to be in the highest court. Even though
she's a girl, I would still want to be Sandra Day O'Connor.''

   Even a Supreme Court justice can slip up when offering an
off-the-cuff summary of a 7-year-old ruling.
   O'Connor recently erred in describing a free-speech decision
stemming from demonstrations at the court's imposing building on
Capitol Hill.
   O'Connor's mistake came during oral arguments over a federal
regulation that bans soliciting donations on Postal Service
property, and was sparked by Justice Antonin Scalia's questioning
of a lawyer.
   After the lawyer contended that the areas outside all post
offices are free-speech zones, Scalia asked, ``What about us? Would
we have to let people demonstrate outside'' on court property?
   In what seemed to be an effort to get back to the case at hand,
O'Connor interrupted to say the court already has ruled ``there is
no right to picket on court property'' but only on the surrounding
public sidewalks.
   Well, not exactly. Whether federal law can make the court's
property off limits to demonstrators remains an open question.
   In a case called United States vs. Grace, the court in 1983
unanimously struck down as unconstitutional part of a federal law
that banned demonstrators from court property and the public
sidewalks surrounding it.
   The court said the public has a constitutional right, guaranteed
by the First Amendment, to use a city sidewalk as one long soapbox
subject to reasonable time, place and manner regulations.
   But the decision specifically left unanswered whether the
federal law's ban on demonstrators could be applied to the court's
property within the city sidewalks.
   ``We need not make that judgment at this time,'' Justice Byron
R. White wrote for the court back then, ``because (the ban imposed
by Congress) covers the public sidewalks as well as the building
and grounds inside the sidewalks.'' O'Connor joined White's opinion.
   The Supreme Court is infallible when interpreting the
Constitution because no one can second-guess it, but the court's
nine justices are only human _ sometimes they make mistakes.

<HEAD>New Poll, Same Results: Americans Don't Know Much About Court</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The National Law Journal recently polled 805 citizens and
concluded, as have previous polls, that Americans do not know very
much about their highest court.
   Fewer than one-fourth of those asked knew that the court has
nine members. Only one in three could name one of the nine.
   Among the justices, John Paul Stevens is the least known by
Americans. Only 1 percent of those asked could name him. O'Connor
is the best-known justice, with a 33 percent rating.
   The polling was conducted among people over 18; the results
might have been more encouraging if elementary schoolchildren were
included.

<HEAD>Fowler Says Bush Tree Planting Rhetoric Outrunning Reality</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The administration is letting ``rhetoric
outrun the reality'' by proposing spending cuts in forestry
programs needed to implement President Bush's plan to plant a
billion new trees, Sen. Wyche Fowler says.
   The Georgia Democrat, chairman of the Senate agriculture
subcommittee on conservation and forestry, told administration
officials Thursday that Bush's ``America the Beautiful''
tree-planting proposal won't succeed without the support of private
landowners.
   Those landowners, he said, won't support the program if they're
hit by new expenses that were covered by the forestry assistance
programs the administration wants to cut.
   ``One thing we cannot do is let the rhetoric outrun the
reality,'' Fowler said. ``If we tell people we're going to plant a
billion trees, the resources have to be there.''
   Patricia M. Kearney, acting assistant secretary of agriculture
for natural resources and environment, said Bush's $175 million
initiative ``will help demonstrate America's commitment to address
worldwide concerns about deforestation and global climate change.''
   She said it includes $110 million to provide matching funds to
private rural landowners for tree planting and forest improvements,
$30 million for a community tree-planting program that will rely on
volunteers, and $35 million to start a private foundation to
promote tree planting.
   But Fowler argued that the program cannot be reconciled with
other proposals in the administration's fiscal 1991 budget, such as
a nearly 50 percent cut in state and private forestry assistance
funds _ including a reduction funding for the seedlings and nursery
program.
   ``With all the new tree planting, where are you going to get the
trees?'' he asked.
   Dale Robertson, chief of the U.S. Forest Service, said most of
the seedlings for the Bush initiative will come from commercial and
state programs. The federal program provides only about 5 percent
of the nation's tree seedlings, he said.
   The administration budget also would reduce funding for pest
management on private forests from $51.4 million this year to $41.7
million next year, and would slash fire protection spending for
private forests from $13.3 million to $4 million.
   ``It's hard to see how that would be consistent with increased
tree planting and maintaining healthy forests,'' Fowler said.
   Robertson said the proposed spending cuts for pest and fire
protection were consistent with past administration efforts to
shift those costs to the states and to private landowners.
   ``We need to do the job with fire protection and insect
protection, but it gets down to the question of who pays for it,''
he said.

<HEAD>Seabrook: Last Hurrah or New Beginning For Nuclear Industry?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The two-decade battle over the Seabrook,
N.H., power plant helped cripple the nuclear power industry.
   Pro- and anti-nuclear advocates agreed on that much Thursday as
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved Seabrook for commercial
operation. What remained unclear was whether the approval would
mark the industry's last hurrah or bring about a second life for
nuclear power.
   The facts are plain enough. No utility has applied for a nuclear
power license since 1978 and more than 100 reactor orders have been
canceled in that time. Accidents at Three Mile Island in
Pennsylvania and Chernobyl in the Soviet Union spread concern about
nuclear power from activists to the general public.
   ``The industry is so much in defeat that there's not likely any
utility that's ever again going to want to order one of these
machines,'' said Robert Backus, counsel to the Seacoast
Anti-Pollution League, a New Hampshire-based group opposed to
Seabrook.
   ``We feel like we have been instrumental in the collapse of
nuclear power in this country and perhaps even around the world,''
Backus said.
   Seabrook owners waited 17 years from their application for a
construction permit to the approval of a full-power license. And
junk bonds used to help finance the plant through the long wait
likely will not be available in future nuclear projects.
   Still, there were optimists Thursday after the NRC's 3-0 vote in
favor of a Seabrook license.
   ``As our demand for electricity keeps growing, we fully expect
that we'll get back to building more new nuclear plants,'' said
Harold B. Finger of the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, an
association representing the nuclear industry. ``Today's vote means
utilities can look with more confidence to nuclear energy as a part
of their total strategy for providing America's fast-growing
electricity needs.''
   Seabrook's own top executives were either uncertain or downright
pessimistic about the industry's future.
   New Hampshire Yankee President Edward Brown said ``I can't
predict'' whether Seabrook will become ``a bellwether for the
future of the entire nuclear industry in the United States.''
   Brown's top deputy, Ted Feigenbaum, said the two-decade
regulatory gauntlet run by Seabrook must be changed if nuclear
energy is to grow. ``It's taken too long,'' he said.
   The NRC has tried to address the problem with a new set of rules
enacted last year. They would allow a utility to receive advance
approval if it chose a pre-approved site and used a standard
reactor design that had passed NRC muster, said commission
spokesman Frank Ingram.
   But, NRC Chairman Kenneth Carr said, ``I don't have any orders
for new plants.'' And he said the decline of nuclear power could
lead to darker days and nights ahead.
   ``As a private citizen, it worries me that nobody's building
power plants out there of any kind,'' Carr said. ``Power in the
United States is not going to be sufficient in the next 10 years
and we'll see the rolling blackouts that we saw in Florida and
Texas over the winter. They'll spread.''
   Organized opposition was one key ingredient that discouraged
utilities from building nuclear plants, Carr said. The other was
public utility regulators' refusal to allow construction costs to
be passed on to ratepayers until a plant was finished.
   Such a ruling in New Hampshire led Public Service Company of New
Hampshire, owner of the largest Seabrook share, to abandon one of
two reactors in 1986 and declare bankruptcy in 1988.
   Some members of Congress appear to be moving in the direction of
even tougher rules. A House subcommittee plans to open hearings
March 15 into the NRC's procedures in reaching the Seabrook
decision.
   Members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation called the
hearings after accusing the NRC of running roughshod over its own
regulations to ram through the Seabrook approval.
   Thursday was a day of mixed emotions for combatants in the
Seabrook fight. Proponents celebrated the licensing decision and
worried about the nuclear power industry. Opponents hissed the NRC
as it issued its ruling but declared victory in the war on nuclear
power.
   For pro-nuclear activists, there is the hope that the Seabrook
experience will lead to a streamlined licensing process. The
attitude of opponents was typified by Scott Denman of the Safe
Energy Communication Council, a Washington-based group.
   ``Seabrook is the last hurrah for a crippled industry,'' Denman
said. ``The nuclear power industry has failed to rally support on
Wall Street or Main Street.''

<TEXT>
   A new agreement on sweeping air pollution
controls is expected to ease Senate passage of the measure,
although the accord with the White House is prompting criticism
from environmentalists and industry _ not to mention some senators.
   Senate leaders and the Bush administration announced agreement
Thursday on the most contentious parts of the bill, including
controls on acid rain, automobile emissions and toxic chemical
releases by industry.
   ``We have reached agreement on sound and comprehensive
legislation that expands and strengthens the clean air laws and
have done it in the most cost-effective way possible,'' declared
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Mitchell said he plans to bring the bill to the Senate floor
Monday.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole called the proposal a ``giant
step forward'' in improving federal air pollution laws for the
first time in 13 years.
   President Bush urged senators to move swiftly to pass the
measure. He had called the original Senate clean air bill too
expensive and at one point suggested he might veto it if Congress
passed it.
   ``President Bush is extraordinarily pleased with the agreement.
It is a milestone, an enormous step forward,'' said Roger Porter,
the president's chief domestic policy adviser and head of the
administration team that helped negotiate the agreement.
   Although not as tough as the original Senate bill, the
compromise calls for broad-ranging new air pollution controls on
automobiles, factories and electric power plants. It aims to:
   _Cut in half the acid rain pollutants from coal-burning electric
power plants by the end of the decade. Annual sulfur dioxide
releases would be cut by 10 million tons by 2000.
   _Tighten automobile emission controls so that hydrocarbon
emissions are cut by one-fifth and nitrogen oxides by nearly
two-thirds. The two emissions are key components of urban smog.
   _Require industry for the first time to install the best
available technology to control the release of 192 toxic chemicals
including a variety of carcinogens. Plants would have to impose
further controls to meet new ``health based'' requirements if the
cancer risks are at a certain level to people living near a plant.
   _Require a broad range of industry to curb smog-causing
pollutants.
   However, environmentalists complained that the compromise
weakened major portions of the original Senate bill.
   ``The back-room dealing has generated bad deals for the American
people,'' complained Richard Ayres, chairman of the National Clean
Air Coalition, which is lobbying on clean air issues for various
environmental organizations.
   Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense
Fund, added, ``Powerful special interests have succeeded in rigging
the game in their favor.''
   The agreement eliminated an automatic second round of tailpipe
emission controls for cars, although such controls still could be
used under some circumstances. It exempted thousands of small
businesses from tougher smog-control requirements in the original
bill, and it removed a provision in current law requiring the
federal government to impose an air pollution reduction plan if
local officials fail to do so.
   There was criticism from the Senate as well.
   ``The agreement fails to require the controls we need to provide
clean air in the nation and in New Jersey,'' said Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J.
   Midwest senators were concerned about the high cost of acid rain
controls, although some new provisions were aimed at holding down
those costs.
   ``It's a better bill, but we'll have to continue the fight for
fairness on the Senate floor,'' said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said the compromise still threatens
thousands of his state's coal miners. He promised to seek
additional changes but added, ``I'm not going to engage in any
filibuster.''
   Speaking of the difficulties Midwest senators face on the acid
rain provision, Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., told reporters: ``We
did not have a choice between the good, the bad and the ugly. We
had a choice between ugly, uglier and ugliest.''
   The Edison Electric Institute called the accord ``unnecessarily
costly'' for utilities, while the Chemical Manufacturers'
Association contended the tougher toxic chemical controls were the
product of politics and not science.
   The agreement is ``far from what business and industry would
consider acceptable,'' said William Fay, administrator of the Clean
Air Working Group, industry's lobbying organization on clean air
issues.

<TEXT>
   An alderman was accused of pushing the
``politics of violence'' after announcing he would revive the Black
Panther Party and train an armed cadre of street gang members to
advance minority causes.
   Alderman Michael McGee made his announcement at a City Hall news
conference he described as a ``State of the Inner-City Address.''
   McGee, 40, was an active member of the militant Black Panthers
in the 1970s and has been an outspoken inner-city representative
since his election to the Common Council in 1984.
   ``We want complete liberation and control of our communities and
our destiny,'' McGee said in an interview Thursday, a day after
announcing his plans. He added he would begin assembling the
militant activists by the end of the year.
   Common Council President Thomas P. Donegan, who is white, said
he was neither frightened nor shocked by McGee's speech, which he
said ``enunciates the anger and frustration of the most estranged
class of people'' in Milwaukee.
   But Donegan said: ``I personally don't believe in the politics
of intimidation or the politics of violence. If he actually means
it .. it'll be a totally useless effort and it will set progress
back for the poor community.''
   McGee said he would call the group the Black Panther community
militia and those recruited would undergo weapons training,
education and ``survival programs.''
   He said he would begin his recruitment among the city's many
street gangs and the group would formally take up arms in 1995 if
conditions for the city's minorities aren't improved by then.
   He gave no details of operations the force might undertake.
   ``They're just shooting each other and dying for no reason at
all,'' he said. ``I'm giving them a reason to die. ... I'm going to
show them who the enemy is: the government, the big private
interests, the multi-millionaires.''
   He called for creation of an emergency $100 million job training
program for blacks and equal representation of minorities in all
bodies of city government.
   McGee in the past has staged numerous peaceful protests,
including whistle-blowing demonstrations aimed at white
politicians, but said the lack of response to those protests
convinced him of the need for violence.
   He said he, his three teen-age sons and others would be unafraid
to die fighting for ``liberation and freedom for our community.''
   State Rep. Gwendolynne Moore, a black Democrat representing the
inner city, said McGee's threat was an attempt to highlight the
serious problems of poverty, unemployment, teen-age pregnancy,
school dropouts and crime in the black community. She stopped short
of endorsing the call to arms.
   ``When you reduce people to nothing, they'll want to survive by
any means necessary,'' she said. ``I have sons 10 and 12 years old
and I am not eager to see them go into the streets to die.
   ``I am not interested in burying my black sons. But I think what
Michael is saying is a barometer of the degree of frustration.''
   Mayor John Norquist was out of town, but his chief of staff, H.
Carl Mueller, issued a brief statement that ``violence or the
threat of violence are not the answer.''
   McGee's previous protests included hanging a black baby doll on
a tree, saying it symbolized racism in Milwaukee, and wearing a
paper bag over his head during a photo session of the city council
to protest lack of funding for minority programs.

   A computer list of 80 drought payments to
farmers in excess of the $100,000 limit contained a number of
errors that were subsequently corrected, according to Agriculture
Department officials.
   The department's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service said such errors and corrections were not unusual.
Officials denied the mistakes were the result of sloppy bookwork in
county offices.
   ``No, no evidence (of sloppiness) that I'm aware of,'' said
William E. Penn, assistant deputy administrator of the USDA agency.
``Anytime you've got an organization as large as ours, with 3,000
field offices, there's going to be some problems.''
   The 80 names headed a list of more than 600 compiled by the
department's National Computer Center at Kansas City, Mo., on Jan.
4, officials said. The payments were made under the Disaster
Assistance Act of 1988.
   As of Dec. 31, payments of more than $3.88 billion had been made
to 805,152 recipients.
   The 80 payments listed Jan. 4 as exceeding the $100,000 limit _
about half were over by less than $100 each, and many of those by
only a dollar _ comprised only 0.01 percent of the total recipients.
   According to the agency, the Office of Management and Budget had
requested information on the ``top 50'' payments under the 1988
drought law. The computer search resulting in the Jan. 4 listing
disclosed hundreds of ties among the top 50 dollar rankings, which
ranged from $380,092 to $99,990.
   For example, the top 43 payments were made to the 80 farms
listed as having received more than the $100,000 limit. There were
more than 600 recipients tied for 44th place at exactly $100,000.
Finally, there were 24 farms listed as sharing the remaining six,
with the 50th payment totaling $99,990.
   A copy of the payment list was made available upon request to
The Associated Press, which ran the names and amounts of the top 80
on Feb. 20. Almost immediately, there were complaints that some
errors were made.
   Some within ASCS were irked that the AP ran the list in the
first place, although the agency has a history of being
comparatively open about subsidy payments to farmers.
   One ASCS official, who demanded anonymity, said the list should
not have been given out without a formal Freedom of Information
request, which would have resulted in checking to see if all the
names and amounts were correct.
   ``We ought to clean up our list before we give it to you, that's
all,'' the official said, adding that he knew of no ``clean'' list
that would be available now. ``We would have to go to the county
offices.''
   Penn, who helps directly supervise the agency's field
operations, said he did not have the full details about the Jan. 4
computer report.
   ``Anytime data is found to be in error, that data is
corrected,'' he said. ``So, if you had January numbers they're
probably not accurate, compared to what they are today. There are
going to be errors that take place.''
   But Penn, who was head of the ASCS state office in Michigan
before coming here, said he felt ``very comfortable in saying that
in general, no, there's no evidence that there's widespread sloppy
work'' at the county level.
   ``We've got nothing to hide,'' he said.

<HEAD>Once-Banished Indians Seek Comeback with Iowa Casino</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banished to a remote prairie 130 years
ago, the Santee-Sioux Indians are rising again, this time with
playing cards in their hands.
   The tribe plans to build a $67 million hotel-casino in Council
Bluffs that would dwarf all other gaming operations between Nevada
and New Jersey.
   ``I'm tired of government handouts and dependency,'' said Don
LaPoint, the tribal council's chairman. ``One of the things we do
have going for us is gaming. I'm very optimistic this is going to
succeed.''
   The tribe has hired Harveys Resort and Casino near Lake Tahoe,
Nev., to run the casino, which with a convention center and 450-bed
hotel would employ up to 1,000 people.
   Gov. Terry Branstad opposes the casino, and much legal wrangling
lies ahead. But local officials said the 1988 Indian Gaming Act, a
federal law providing preferential treatment for Indians, could
help the casino become a reality.
   ``The governor feels there is sentiment among Iowans that we've
gone far enough in gambling,'' said Dick Vohs, a Branstad spokesman.
   Chuck Shearer, vice president of finance for Harveys, said the
casino would push ahead with its plans ``until we have exhausted
all the legal opportunities available or until the city of Council
Bluffs asks us to get out of town.''
   The Santee-Sioux have an option to buy a 50-acre tract for the
casino in Council Bluffs, across the Missouri River from Omaha,
Neb. Proponents expect the casino also would lure customers from
Des Moines, 120 miles to the east, and Kansas City, 200 miles to
the south.
   Few employees are likely to be Indians, but the tribe's share of
the income would go back to the reservation, some 200 miles to the
northwest in Nebraska, where about 60 percent of the 2,300 tribe
members live.
   The Sioux-Santee were banished to the 12-by-17-mile reserve by
President Lincoln after the bloody Minnesota Uprising of 1862.
   ``We're isolated here,'' LaPoint said in a telephone interview
from the reservation. ``Nobody comes here. There are no airports,
no industries. We need to come back with pride, dignity.''
   The Council Bluffs City Council and business community have not
taken a formal position on the casino, but the general sentiment is
favorable, said city attorney Richard B. Wade.
   ``People fear that if we don't do everything to get it, next
year it will either be in Des Moines or Chicago or Kansas City,''
Wade said.
   That the casino is possible at all stems from the Iowa
Legislature's decision last year to allow low-stakes casinos aboard
riverboats beginning in the summer 1991.
   The riverboat casino law opened the door to other gambling. The
Mesquakie Indians, who already hold high-stakes bingo games on
their settlement near Tama, are nearing agreement with the state on
adding video lottery games and slot machines.
   Indian tribes nationwide, faced with cutbacks in federal money
and a limited tax base, have instituted gambling to raise revenue.
The 1988 act helps them set up operations off their reservations,
in more easily visited areas.
   The act states that such gaming is permitted if officials agree
it is in the best interests of both the community and the Indians.
   But Vohs said his reading of the law is that the governor has
final say on the establishment of any high-stakes casino.
   ``Obviously, that's not how we see it,'' said Shearer.
   Joel Starr, a U.S. Interior Department gaming expert, said
casino advocates would have little room to maneuver if the governor
turned them down.
   Seven Midwest bishops have issued a statement criticizing the
casino, saying gambling can shred families and hurt communities.
   But Wade said: ``We've already devised several ways you can lose
your paycheck. A lot of people feel the moral issue has already
been decided.''

<HEAD>Chemical Companies Say Legislation Too Extreme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chemical companies say proposed legislation
outlawing the export of pesticides banned in the United States goes
too far in trying to control other nations.
   ``I don't think U.S. regulators should make decisions for other
countries about what they do and do not need,'' said Donna
Jennings, spokeswoman for Velsicol Chemical Corp.
   Her company, the only manufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor,
was criticized Thursday by Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., who referred to
the products as ``deadly poison.'' The products are not registered
for use in the United States.
   Gore's comments came as he and four other lawmakers announced
legislation that would prevent U.S. chemical manufacturers from
selling products abroad that can't be used in the United States.
   ``If the EPA says it is too hazardous to be used on U.S. grown
foods, then it is too hazardous to be used on foreign grown
foods,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee.
   He said the legislation he and Gore are sponsoring in the Senate
would close a legal loophole that allows U.S. chemical companies to
manufacture here and sell abroad pesticides that are probable
carcinogens.
   Reps. Mike Synar, D-Okla., Leon Panetta, D-Calif., and Dan
Glickman, D-Kan., are the House sponsors of the same bill, known as
the Pesticides Export Reform Act.
   The lawmakers said that banned and unregistered pesticides made
in the United States are showing up on foreign food imported to the
United States.
   ``These chemicals are killers. We know that,'' Gore said.
``Velsicol has the same responsibility of every manufacturer to act
in a responsible way and to protect public health.''
   But Jennings said chlordane and heptachlor are only temporarily
off the U.S. market during a review by the Environmental Protection
Agency.
   She said the products are used to kill termites and protect
germinating seeds from other pests. While alternative chemicals
exist for use in the United States, there are some regions of the
world, such as the tropics, where weather and pest conditions
prevent other products from being effective, she said.
   Those same conditions, she said, also cause the chemicals to
break down faster than in the United States, creating less danger
to human health.
   Synar, who chairs the House Government Operations subcommittee
on environment, energy and natural resources, said that information
from the United Nations showed many countries, especially in the
Third World, lack the ability to assure safe pesticide practices.
   Business in the chemical industry in this country could take a
downturn if the legislation is passed, said National Agricultural
Chemicals Association president Jay Vroom.
   ``A unilateral approach to a global issue does no good and only
puts U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage, and may drive importing
countries to suppliers that may supply far less environmental
stewardship with their products,'' he said.
   Other key provisions in the bill include:
   _A ban on imports that have been treated with outlawed chemicals.
   _Listing by importers of chemicals used to grow foods shipped
from abroad.
   _Labeling of exported U.S.-made chemicals in the language of the
receiving country.

   It is falling to the Prime Minister of
Ireland, in this season of rapid change, to see what can be done to
anchor the emerging new and more powerful Germany in a democratic
European Community.
   Ireland is the only neutralist country in the 12-nation
community. But Charles J. Haughey, the prime minister, is not
neutral about the task at hand.
   Like most Europeans, he considers unification of East Germany
and West Germany inevitable _ and a good thing. But he knows a lot
of people are anxious, and Haughey feels the best way to allay
those concerns _ especially economic ones _ is to wrap Germany into
the European Community, which is on a fast track to economic union.
   He also favors stronger U.S. ties to Europe.
   As the president of the European Council, a job that rotates
every six months, Haughey called on President Bush this week and
held other meetings around town that, for a change, were not
focused on the trouble in Northern Ireland.
   To begin with, West Germany is an economic colossus, accounting
for 25 percent of the gross national product of the 12 Community
countries. East Germany will integrate its currency with its
wealthy cousins in West Germany and thereby unleash a wave of
purchasing power that could touch off inflation as East Germans
reach into their savings to acquire long-denied consumer goods.
   The fact that Germany will be even stronger militarily is
another source of worry to its neighbors, although Haughey said any
European concerns ``would be directed most at German economic might
and possible domination.''
   Haughey, who has served three unconnected terms as Irish prime
minister, is pleased that Germany would remain in the European
Community after unification, participating in the transition to a
Europe of shared interests and cooperation.
   ``A Germany remaining a full and committed member of the
European Community is a great reassurance,'' he said.
   Still, Haughey admits the turn of events is unprecedented.
   ``There are no rules or texts that can guide us on how to handle
it,'' he said.
   Haughey is counting heavily on the good sense of West German
officials and a European determination to pull together.
   While West Germany will bear most of the burden of
rehabilitating East Germany, the 11 other European Community
members intend to provide assistance with trade and investment
programs.
   ``In short,'' he said, ``there will be very big costs to bring
East Germany in, and to bring it up to West European standards.''
   A European Community development bank will be ready to make
loans to all the East European countries as they switch to
non-Marxist systems, and to the Soviet Union as well.
   ``Fortunately,'' Haughey said, ``Germany is the member ablest
most easily to bear this burden. It can handle it with the greatest
skill and determination.''
   Moreover, Germany is anchored by the 35-nation European Security
Conference. This is the grouping of the Soviet Union and its
allies, West Europeans, neutralists and the United States and
Canada with a common commitment to human rights.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal for a summit
later this year to promote a common European home has U.S. support
provided human rights are enshrined at the summit as a fundamental
principle.
   The summit was to have been held in 1992.
   ``Moving it up reflects everyone's anxiety to deal with the
German issue,'' Haughey said. ``There are anxieties _ concerns may
be a better word. I think, on the whole, people will be relieved by
these factors.''
   A strong nationalist who has worked as a barrister and an
accountant, Haughey is considered a canny analyst. His analysis of
European integration is that it is unstoppable, despite British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's reservations.
   In seeking stronger U.S. ties to the Community, Haughey worked
out with Bush a plan for semiannual meetings of the presidents of
the United States and the European Council, as well as meetings
twice a year between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and the
12 Community foreign ministers.
   All this is fine with the Bush administration. The ``new
architecture'' Baker has proposed for Europe includes closer U.S.
ties.
   But that doesn't mean Haughey favors U.S. membership in the
Community. ``There cannot be a 13th seat at the table,'' he said.
The Europeans intend to make integration decisions themselves.

<HEAD>Low Speed Bumper Crashes Bring Big Repair Bills</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Small cars that should be protected from
damage by their bumpers at low speeds cost between $769 and $3,838
to repair after four test bumps, an auto safety institute reports.
   The most damaged among 16 new cars tested at 5 mph by the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety was the 1990 Daihatsu
Charade SE and the least damaged was the Honda Civic DX, said
institute president Brian O'Neill.
   ``Every bumper we tested this year did a poor job of preventing
damage, and some were downright lousy,'' O'Neill said in releasing
the results of the annual testing Thursday.
   The institute, funded by the insurance industry, buys the cars,
runs each one into flat barriers, front and back, into a front
angle barrier and then backward into a pole _ all at 5 mph.
   He said bumper performance has deteriorated since 1982, when the
Transportation Department rolled back federal requirements that car
bumpers be able to sustain 5 mph crashes without damage to the
vehicle.
   Manufacturers have weakened bumpers without the federal rules
and consumers need to know which cars will require the biggest
repair bills, O'Neill said.
   A 1981 Ford Escort sustained no damage in any of the institute's
four tests, O'Neill said, while damage to a 1990 Escort totaled
$1,718.
   Hyundai Excel bumpers were weakened during the 1990 model year,
he said. An Excel tested before the change sustained $561 damage in
the rear-into-pole test, while the same model with the weaker
bumpers cost $721 to repair.
   Eight cars that sustained no damage when run forward into a flat
barrier, were badly damaged costing between $200 (for the Honda
Civic) and $718 (for the Mazda 323 Protege SE) when run into an
angled barrier, the institute said.
   Among seven cars with no damage in rear barrier tests, damage in
the rear-into-pole test ranged from $479 for the Dodge Shadow to
$1,404 for the Ford Escort, the report said.
   The institute said it found that Toyota Corollas manufactured in
Japan and exported to the United States have more protective
bumpers than Corollas built in California or a nearly identical Geo
Prizms built in the same California plant.
   The Prizm had $267 worth of damage in the front barrier test,
while the Japan-built Corolla, whose bumper assembly weighs two
pounds less, had none, the institute said.

   For the second time in her
life, Arab-Israeli strife has driven Fatima Sufarin from her home.
   ``This is the price we have to pay for our homeland,'' the
70-year-old Palestinian said Thursday. She said she was first
displaced when she fled from her home in the village of Lifta near
Jerusalem during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.
   On Wednesday, Israeli troops blew up her two-story house, and
Mrs. Sufarin's 12-member family carried what was left of their
possessions to a nearby shack.
   The six-room house was demolished to punish the family for the
alleged crimes of Mrs. Sufarin's 25-year-old son Imad, who is
accused of throwing a firebomb that wounded an Israeli soldier.
Family members say Imad, who is awaiting trial, is innocent.
   According to the army, more than 450 houses have been destroyed
or sealed in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip since the
beginning of the Palestinian uprising in December 1987.
   On Thursday, troops sealed three houses in the village of Tamoun
in the northern West Bank, the army said. Palestinian reporters
said the sealings made 16 people homeless.
   The houses belonged to the families of three Palestinian men who
allegedly carried out acts of sabotage in nearby Jewish settlements
and threw firebombs on homes of several Tamoun residents suspected
of cooperating with Israeli authorities.
   The United States and other Western nations have criticized
house demolitions and sealings, saying the practice was a form of
collective punishment and violated the right to due process. In
nearly all cases, houses are destroyed or sealed before a suspect
has been tried.
   Israeli military officials say the practice is an effective
deterrent and is legal under emergency regulations dating to the
pre-state British mandate period.
   The demolition of Mrs. Sufarin's house left 12 people homeless,
including herself, her daughters, Jamile and Wedad, and their
teen-age children.
   Wedad, 42, suffers from schizophrenia and has been kept in a
locked room for the past 15 years because family members said
otherwise she might harm herself and others.
   Wedad found refuge in the Bethlehem Mental Hospital, which
earlier had refused to take her in because of her violent
outbursts. But hospital officials said she would have to leave soon
because she was too much of a burden.
   On Thursday, Mrs. Sufarin's family gathered around the rubble of
the house, at the foot of the Judean Hills and near the site where
the Bible says Jesus was tempted by the devil.
   Mrs. Sufarin, her white headscarf soaked by driving rain, wept
as she found chickens buried under the rubble and looked for
anything to salvage.
   The Sufarins spent the night in a nearby shack into which they
had piled all their possessions, including blankets, carpets,
wicker chairs, a grandfather clock and a refrigerator.
   Mrs. Sufarin said Thursday she was waiting for U.N. officials to
deliver an emergency tent that would be her new home.
   Since the beginning of the uprising, 659 Palestinians have been
killed by Israeli soldiers and civilians. Forty-three Israelis have
also died in the violence.

<HEAD>Study of Twins Links Stress Disorder to Combat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study of twins who served in the military
during the Vietnam era offers new evidence that post-traumatic
stress disorder is more a product of combat than of any inborn
susceptibility to stress.
   The findings indicate the disorder _ marked by painful memories,
flashbacks and nightmares _ is three times more common among
veterans who served in Southeast Asia than among their identical
twins who served elsewhere.
   The twins who saw heavy combat in Vietnam _ 179 servicemen _
were found to suffer nine times as often from the problem as their
identical twins who served in the armed forces in other parts of
the world.
   ``Identical twins are more similar than any two individuals,''
said lead researcher Jack Goldberg, an assistant professor of
epidemiology at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
   ``And so you have two guys with 100 percent of the same genes,
who grew up together, and one guy goes to war and one doesn't. And
15 years later, one has post-traumatic stress disorder and one
doesn't. That sort of debunks the idea of predisposition.''
   A popular myth holds that ``just the bad eggs were sent to
Vietnam,'' Goldberg said in a telephone interview Thursday.
``That's not the story. ... The average Joes went to Vietnam.''
   The study, published in today's Journal of the American Medical
Associaiton, was developed from a specially designed registry of
2,092 male twins in military service during the Vietnam War era,
from 1965 to 1975.
   The registry was established to further scientists'
understanding of health problems believed to be partly due to
genetic traits and partly to environment, including alcoholism,
drug abuse and heart disease, he said.
   When the survey was conducted in 1987, 16.8 percent of the twins
who served in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam era had symptoms of
post-traumatic stress disorder. Just 5 percent of their identical
twin brothers who didn't serve in Southeast Asia had the symptoms.
   Terence M. Keane, chief of psychology at the Boston Veterans
Administration Medical Center, said the study ``represents a major
advance in our understanding of post-traumatic stress disorder.''
   The findings closely match those of a congressional study
estimating 15 percent of Vietnam veterans suffer from
post-traumatic stress disorder, Goldberg said. That means 450,000
veterans are afflicted with it, he said.
   ``These guys are hurting,'' he said. ``They're not psychotic.
They're not crazy. They have nightmares. They have problems. But
our sense is that a lot of these guys function very well.''

<HEAD>Report: Pentagon Must Provide Realistic 5-Year Spending Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon must provide a realistic
five-year spending plan because the current budget indicates that
$138 billion in spending cuts are needed to meet President Bush's
defense goal, a congressional report says.
   ``The Congress is faced with budget decisions that will have
long-term implications, but without an updated five-year defense
plan, it does not have the information necessary to fully assess
alternatives,'' Comptroller General Charles Bowsher told the Senate
Armed Services Committee on Thursday.
   Bowsher presented the General Accounting Office's assessment of
defense spending. The investigative arm of Congress found that
Bush's budget for fiscal 1991 includes a five-year program that
projects spending of $1.5 trillion.
   That total is $212 billion less than the recent five-year plan
that the administration prepared in fiscal 1989. However, the
Pentagon has come up with only $74 billion in reductions from the
1989 projections.
   ``The Defense Department is still faced with decisions on how
and where to make reductions of another $138 billion between fiscal
1992 and fiscal 1994,'' Bowsher said.
   The Pentagon, he said, has said the dramatic changes in Eastern
Europe and the lessening Soviet threat to the West has made it
difficult to decide where and how the reductions will be made.
   The comptroller general said the GAO does not expect the
Pentagon to act hastily, but the decisions must be made soon.
   Bowsher suggested that the administration ``rethink our entire
weapon system acquisition strategy,'' starting with the B-2 stealth
bomber and the multiple-warhead MX nuclear missile.
   Repeating testimony he gave last week to the House Armed
Services Committee, Bowsher suggested slowing down production of
the costly stealth bomber until critical tests have been completed
on the radar-evading aircraft.
   According to the GAO, the current schedule calls for spending
more than $48 billion and ordering 31 bombers before critical
performance tests have been conducted.
   The GAO also found that the Air Force plans to make an initial
production decision on moving the MX missile from fixed silos to
railroad cars before operational tests and evaluations have been
done on the completed system.
   Shortly after the production decision, the Air Force plans to
buy about 73 percent of the launch cars for the MX.
   Bowsher said that during the 1980s, the strategy of concurrent
production and testing ``was designed to get systems in the field
more quickly, but it often resulted in making extensive _ and
expensive _ changes after the systems were fielded.''
   The B-2 bomber and the MX rail-garrison program are following
the same path, he said.
   Overall, the comptroller general painted a dire financial
picture as he accused the Bush administration of spending
projections that are ``the result of creative bookkeeping; they do
not portray the real situation.''
   According to Bowsher, the government is using surpluses in the
federal trust funds for Social Security, highways and other
divisions to cover up the real budget deficit.
   ``If we continue along this same path, we can expect the
national debt to increase to $4.5 trillion by fiscal year 1995,''
Bowsher said. ``A debt of this magnitude would require annual
interest payments of over $335 billion and would represent the
largest single item in the federal budget.''

   The National Right to Life Committee says
abortion opponents should withhold contributions or drop their
memberships in three environmental organizations because the groups
support abortions.
   The anti-abortion group says the National Wildlife Federation,
the National Audubon Society and the Sierra Club support abortions
by backing legislation that would allow broader use of federal
money for birth control in Third World countries.
   Wildlife Federation and Audubon Society officials say their
organizations have no position on abortion.
   Nancy Walker, director of the Sierra Club's population program,
said her group supports a woman's right to an abortion and has been
targeted by the right-to-life group before.
   ``We believe the true pro-life position supports population
stabilization,'' she said.
   The National Abortion Rights Action League called the
controversy bewildering.
   ``It's this kind of activity that shows how extreme they are,''
Loretta Ucelli, spokeswoman for the abortion-rights group, said
about the National Right to Life Committee.
   The anti-abortion group issued a call in the March edition of
its magazine, National Right to Life News, for its members to drop
out or withhold donations to the three groups.
   Doug Johnson, the group's legislative director, said the step
was taken because all three groups have endorsed a bill that would
reverse Bush administration policy denying aid to family planning
organizations that provide abortion information or services in
less-developed countries.
   ``It is wrong to solicit people's contributions to protect
wildlife and then use the money to lobby for pro-abortion
policies,'' Johnson said.
   Officials of the three groups said they support global birth
control efforts because overpopulation threatens the environment.
   ``Singling out environmental groups is taking it to an
extreme,'' said Stephanie Sklar of the National Wildlife
Federation. ``It's trying to make an issue out of something that's
not an issue for these groups.''
   She said the dispute was touched off last year when
environmental groups jointly issued a report that urged a
modification of the administration policy, which was left over from
the Reagan administration and embraced by the Bush White House.
   Hope Babcock, counsel for the Audubon Society, said her group
opposed the administration policy. But, she said, ``we have
absolutely no position'' on abortion.
   ``We are about educating the world about the relationship
between population and the environment, and the stress put on the
environment through population growth,'' she said.
   None of the targeted groups said they expected to lose much
money or many members as a result of the action.

<HEAD>Lithuania Speeds Up Elections For Fear of Stronger Gorbachev</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuanians scrambled to move up elections to
allow their parliament to vote on independence before Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev gains new power they fear could
thwart their drive.
   Activists in the Baltic republic were making the moves while
Soviet authorities also came under pressure Thursday in neighboring
Latvia and in Moldavia.
   In the neighboring Baltic republic of Latvia, the parliament
gave some youths the right to refuse conscription in the Soviet
army. In the southwestern republic of Moldavia, Communist leaders
admitted their party's past mistakes and agreed to talks with
popular political movements, the official news agency Tass said.
   Already, 22 local election boards in Lithuania have moved up
their runoff elections from March 10 to Sunday, Tass reported
Thursday. Others are expected to follow, said Vitoris Radjavichus,
a spokesman for the Lithuanian people's front, Sajudis.
   That will allow the new Lithuanian parliament to meet _ and
possibly vote on independence _ before March 12, Radjavichus said.
That is the opening day of the Soviet Congress of People's
Deputies, which is scheduled to vote on creating a more powerful
presidency, expected to be occupied by Gorbachev.
   The bill would give Gorbachev the power to declare a state of
emergency and suspend a republic's parliament. He could also send
troops into a locality and even declare war without asking the
Soviet parliament. Radjavichus described the powers as
``dictatorial.''
   Candidates backed by Sajudis, which favors independence, won 70
of 90 seats filled in the first round of the election Saturday. But
94 of the parliament's 140 seats, or a two-thirds majority, must be
filled before the body can begin to act, Sajudis secretary Andryus
Kubilyus told the Radio Moscow news service Interfax.
   Kazimieras Motieka, a Sajudis leader and member of the national
parliament, appealed on Lithuanian television for the republic's
new legislature to take office by March 11, Tass said.
   In the December session of Congress, Motieka asked Kremlin
leaders to begin negotiations on the Lithuanian demand for
independence from the Soviet Union, which forcibly annexed
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in 1940.
   In its decision Thursday, the Latvian parliament said local
youths will be allowed to choose three years of alternative public
service work to the military, if they have pacifist or religious
convictions, Tass said.
   The decision contradicts Soviet law, which requires all
18-year-olds to serve two years in the army.
   All three Baltic republics adopted constitutional amendments in
the past 16 months giving their parliaments the right to overturn
Soviet laws. The Kremlin has denounced these actions as violating
the Constitution, but so far there has been no direct confrontation.
   In Moldavia, the Communist Party Central Committee agreed to
talks with mass movements in hopes of calming tensions between
Russians and Moldavians, who are ethnically related to Romanians.
The party leaders, apparently in a debate over some activists'
calls for independence or reunification with Romania, voted to
support ``independence within the framework of a renewed Soviet
federation.''
   ``Leaders of the Moldavian Communist Party intend to start a
democratic and open dialogue with rank-and-file Communists and the
broad public,'' Tass quoted Moldavian party chief Pyotr Luchinsky
as saying.

<HEAD>Feld Ballet `Mother Nature' Opens</HEAD>

   ``Mother Nature,'' an amusing ballet which mixes
the Garden of Eden and Greek mythology _ mainly as an excuse for
dancing about in light-hearted fashion _ received its premiere
Thursday night by Feld Ballets NY.
   Eliot Feld choreographed ``Mother Nature'' and the other three
ballets on the program at the Joyce Theater.
   Jeffrey Neeck and Buffy Miller were the man and woman in brief,
flower-bedecked costumes. At first he was asleep inside a cosy
fenced enclosure; she was piled up with four furry female sheep.
Darren A. Gibson as Cupid shot arrows at the two and Amoretto _
Joan Tsao, dancing as Cupid's partner _ dropped an apple into the
hands of Neeck.
   When he tossed aside the core, the ballerina sheep scampered for
it.
   James Sewell as a satyr entered and pursued Neeck, not Miss
Miller. The sun, moon and clouds were carried across the stage,
depicting days passing. Scott Rink did one-hand cartwheels across
the stage, while carrying the sun in his other hand. Everybody
gamboled about and did amazing controlled things with their bodies
while balancing on their shoulders or their lower arms.
   The couple married and had a wedding night, behind a big leaf.
   The music was several pieces by Monteverdi, including
``Madrigali Erotici.'' It was all jolly and our only complaint is
that nearly every section went on until the audience's delight was
diminishing.
   The evening was all on the light-hearted side. It began with the
smile-producing ``Excursions'' from 1975, to music by Samuel
Barber, continued with ``Asia'' from 1989, in which Lynn Aaron does
many slinky Orientalisms to Ravel's ``Sheherazade.'' Willa Kim's
chiffon trousers for the five women were graceful and sexy.
   Then James Sewell performed ``Medium:Rare,'' using eight slant
boards and a small trampoline. Sewell needed to be an athlete and
an actor to vary moods and he was both. The music was minimalist,
by Steve Reich.
   All evening, dancers looked in top form. Eliot Feld has
choreographed 63 ballets since 1967, giving Feld Ballets NY a big
repertoire. It really is a brilliant company.

   U.S. and Japanese negotiators face a series of
deadlines on contentious trade issues, and the rhetoric is heating
up on both sides of the Pacific as President Bush meets with Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   Japanese officials are complaining of high-handed U.S. demands,
while American officials are warning of retaliatory measures if the
Japanese do not grant concessions to reduce the huge trade
imbalance between the two nations.
   The trade dispute was expected to be at center stage when Bush
welcomed Kaifu in Palm Springs, Calif., this afternoon for two days
of talks.
   While no significant breakthrough was considered likely, U.S.
officials hoped the Bush-Kaifu discussions would at least lay the
groundwork for progress as the negotiations proceed at a lower
level in coming months.
   There is a growing U.S. impatience with Japan, especially among
Democrats in Congress who point to new government figures showing
that Japan accounted for almost half of America's $108.6 billion
trade deficit last year.
   The deficit with Japan remained stuck at $49 billion, little
changed from a $51.8 billion imbalance the year before.
   ``Congress is getting tired of the games they play. We can't
crack their markets,'' Rep. Marty Russo, D-Ill., told U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills at a hearing this week.
   ``I remain optimistic that Japan will see the need to open up
the second largest market in the world,'' Hills told reporters on
Thursday.
   The Japanese are upset about being singled out for America's
trade problems, many of which they believe are a product of U.S.
inability to compete on international markets. On the campaign
trail, Kaifu blasted Congress for ``raising a sword'' against the
Japanese on trade issues.
   Hills conceded that the U.S.-Japanese relationship was ``at a
difficult point and needs to have the highest level of attention.''
   Speaking to a gathering of economists on Thursday, Hills
suggested that ``it would be extremely helpful politically'' for
Japan to make some trade concessions so she could point to progress
in a report she must send Congress by March 30.
   The Bush administration is facing a series of deadlines to
resolve disputes over a variety of products, ranging from lumber to
super computers.
   Among the issues in contention:
   _The United States last May put Japan on a trade ``hit list''
for its alleged unfair barriers against the sale of American wood
products, satellites and super computers. The administration, which
acted under a section of the 1988 trade law known as Super 301, has
until June 16 to negotiate a removal of the barriers. If the
negotiations fail, the administration can impose retaliatory
tariffs against Japanese products.
   _The United States and Japan are engaged in an ambitious effort
aimed at tackling the underlying causes of the trade deficit such
as Japanese exclusionary business practices and also the low U.S.
savings rate. American negotiators have expressed disappointment
that three rounds of discussions in the so-called Structural
Impediments Initiative have produced little progress. An interim
report is expected this spring and the final report is due this
summer.
   _Japanese barriers to the sale of American telecommunications
products, a primary source of tension between the two countries in
recent years, also are being discussed. Negotiators met last month
in Tokyo with the American side demanding more freedom for Japanese
companies to decide which telephone products to buy.
   _Negotiations are going forward on other issues from
construction to shipbuilding to protection on U.S. patents and
copyrights.
   Even as the talks continue, some in Congress are laying the
groundwork to force the administration to take a tougher line
unless the Japanese grant concessions.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., has introduced legislation that would
require retaliation if Japan does not liberalize its markets for
super computers, satellites and wood products by June 16.
   Referring to that legislation, Hills said there was an urgency
in Japanese officials moving quickly ``before Congress takes an
action that would limit our discretion.''

<HEAD>Congress Spends $100 Million to Honor Former Members</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What do Hubert H. Humphrey, Everett McKinley
Dirksen, Mike Mansfield, John Stennis, Barry Goldwater, Claude
Pepper, Henry M. Jackson, Margaret Chase Smith, Sam Rayburn, John
W. McCormack and Joe Martin have in common?
   The answer is not the simple one that all are retired or
deceased members of Congress.
   It is, rather, that all are political eminences whom Congress
has chosen to honor by paying out millions of federal dollars to
establish foundations bearing their names.
   Total price tag over the last 15 years: more than $100 million.
   The practice, according to an article by Julie Kosterlitz in
this week's issue of the National Journal, goes far beyond merely
naming a building for a distinguished congressional statesman.
   The name of Sam Rayburn, the late speaker of the House, already
was carved in marble on the walls of the Rayburn House Office
Building when, in 1974, Rep. Wright Patman, D-Texas, an old friend,
got a bright idea.
   Patman noted that Congress was about to give $10 million in
proceeds from the sale of the Eisenhower commemorative dollar coin
to help out financially ailing Eisenhower College, named for the
late president.
   Patman attached an amendment requiring the college to transfer
$1 million of the Eisenhower money to the Sam Rayburn Library in
Bonham, Texas. It was opened with private money in 1957 to house
the papers of the speaker who died in 1961.
   The bright idea soon became an established idea.
   The most recent example: $10 million added to a defense
appropriations bill to endow a foundation to be named for the late
Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla. and his wife, Mildred, to carry on his
work on behalf of the elderly.
   Other examples:
   _The 1986 Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in
Education Foundation set up to honor the retired GOP senator from
Arizona by providing a record-breaking $40 million to aid college
students studying mathematics and the natural sciences.
   _The 1986 Henry M. Jackson Foundation in Seattle got $10 million
to honor the Democratic senator from Washington who died in 1983.
Additionally, the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement
of Military Medicine in Rockville, Md., got $1 million to endow a
chair in dermatology.
   _The Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the
University of Minnesota received $5 million in the late 1970s to
honor the late Democratic senator and vice president. At the same
time, an institute named for the late Sen. Everett McKinley
Dirksen, R-Ill., received $2.5 million.
   _Former Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, D-Mont., who also
served for nearly a decade as U.S. ambassador to Japan, was honored
in 1983 by the creation of a $5 million foundation at the
University of Montana in Missoula to study the nations of the
Pacific Rim.
   _A $3 million federal grant was approved in 1982 to create a
John W. McCormack Institute of Public Affairs at the Boston campus
of the University of Massachusetts. McCormack retired as speaker of
the House in 1971.
   _A grant of $4 million in the late 1980's created the Joseph
Martin Institute for Law and Society at Stonehill College in
Northeastern Massachusetts to honor the late GOP speaker of the
House.
   _The John C. Stennis Center for Public Service Development was
opened in Starkville, Miss., in honor of the recently retired
Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. It
received $7.5 million.
   _In 1989 Congress approved $2.5 million for the Margaret Chase
Smith Foundation which operates a library attached to the
Skowhegan, Maine, home of the 92-year-old former Republican senator.
   Sometimes Congress is asked to honor a former member _ and says
no.
   For various reasons, it turned down requests to finance
institutes and foundations to honor the late Senate Republican
leader Robert Taft of Ohio, former House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip''
O'Neill Jr., D-Mass., and the late Sen. Warren G. Magnuson, D-Wash.
   Still pending is a $5 million request by Maine's Bates College
to house the archives of Democrat Edmund S. Muskie, a former Maine
governor, U.S. senator and secretary of state.

<HEAD>CBS Returns Andy Rooney to `60 Minutes'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andy Rooney is bringing his weekly gripe session
back to ``60 Minutes'' on Sunday after CBS lifted his suspension
early with the blessing of the NAACP.
   ``I'm very pleased,'' Rooney said Thursday after CBS News
president David Burke reinstated the 71-year-old humorist, whose
curmudgeonly commentary has been a show-ending ``60 Minutes''
feature since 1978.
   Burke on Feb. 8 had suspended Rooney for three months without
pay after The Advocate, a gay magazine, quoted him as saying that
blacks had ``watered down their genes'' _ a remark Rooney denied
making.
   On Thursday, the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People said it believed Rooney was misquoted, didn't object
to his return to work and considered the matter closed, spokesman
James Williams said.
   Rooney also had drawn fire from homosexuals for a Dec. 28 CBS
special in which he cited ``homosexual unions'' as among things
that cause ``self-induced'' death, and for a letter to The Advocate
in which he said he found male homosexual acts ``repugnant.''
   Burke said of the suspension, ``Painful though these events have
been, we have all learned a great deal about how sensitive and
fragile our society is _ how thoughts and words can be
misunderstood.''
   He said Rooney ``has consistently stated publicly that he is not
a man who holds prejudice in his heart and mind towards any group
in our society. Those of us who know him and work with him know two
things _ first, that is true, and second, it is time that Andy
returned to his proper place on `60 Minutes.'''
   Rooney, who said he would address the uproar Sunday on ``60
Minutes,'' said it had sensitized him to some of the problems faced
by homosexuals.
   ``I think they have really made their point,'' he said. ``I
believe they are in a more difficult position than I understood.''
   In a statement, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation
complained that Rooney ``has yet to make amends with the gay and
lesbian community regarding the series of homophobic comments he
made in the last few months.''
   During his three weeks away from ``60 Minutes,'' the program,
while still top-rated, has slipped in the ratings, dropping to 18th
last Sunday, when it was beaten by a special rerun of ABC's hit
``America's Funniest Home Videos.''
   Some CBS executives and researchers at the networks said
entertainmnent programs at other networks had more to do with the
ratings drop than did Rooney's absence.
   CBS has received more than 5,000 viewer calls for Rooney's
return.
   ``We all get the bittersweet in our lives,'' Rooney said of the
matter, adding that he likes a quotation attributed to ABC newsman
Sam Donaldson: ``Only the amateurs stay mad.''

<HEAD>Baker Awaits Israel Response on Talks With Palestinians</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX6</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is
looking for a response this weekend from Israel on whether it will
accept his proposal for talks with a Palestinian delegation about
elections in the occupied territories.
   ``We've really done pretty much all we can do, we think, from
our end, and we are waiting for a response from the Israeli
government,'' Baker said Thursday at a hearing before the House
Appropriations foreign aid subcommittee.
   ``We're coming very close to the time when we will know one way
or the other'' whether Israel will accept a proposal for talks
concerning elections among the 1.7 million Palestinians in the
territories, Baker said.
   Baker has been expressing growing impatience with Israel's
failure to respond to his proposals, aired during his meetings with
the foreign ministers of Egypt and Israel. Two issues he raised at
the hearing seemed certain to add pressure on Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir.
   The secretary said the Bush administration could endorse a move
to give Israel $400 million in loan guarantees to build housing for
an influx of Soviet Jewish refugees, but only if Israel promises
not to put any new settlers in the occupied territories of the West
Bank and Gaza strip.
   There might be support ``if there were some assurance from the
government of Israel that it would not be engaging in any new,
additional settlement activity in the territories,'' Baker said.
   The money is expected to be added to an upcoming supplemental
appropriations bill and is likely to win congressional approval
because of Israel's strong support on Capitol Hill.
   Israel has declined to provide such assurances about future
settlement, but has contended in the past that about 1 percent of
refugees have settled in the territories.
   ``Settlements are not conducive to the peace process'' because
they aggravate tensions with Palestinian residents, Baker said.
``It is not unreasonable to ask some assurances these funds will
not be used to create new settlements or expand old settlements in
the occupied territories.''
   Baker also said the Bush administration may support cutting U.S.
aid to Israel and Egypt if similar cuts were applied to other
nations to free money for emerging democracies.
   ``We're willing to stand up and be counted'' on such a plan
because it would allow foreign aid money to be distributed where it
is most needed, Baker said. He said administration support for the
cuts would ``depend on whether we do it in a non-discriminatory
manner.''
   Baker said he has not found any significant reduction in
tensions in the Middle East. But he added: ``At the same time, we
must find a way to respond to changes in Eastern Europe, in Panama
and in Nicaragua.''
   ``If these leaders are not able to produce for their people, we
will rue the day'' that the United States fell short in providing
aid, he said. ``We are talking about supporting an extraordinary
outbreak of freedom and democracy.''
   Baker also said he did not want to see a repetition of the
current year's budget crunch, in which some friendly countries that
expected U.S. aid got little or nothing because 90 percent of the
aid budget was already earmarked by Congress for other recipients.
   Economic aid to all of Africa totaled just $14 million this year
``because there's no one up here lobbying for them,'' he said.
   His comments were the clearest indication yet that the
administration would accept cuts to Israel and Egypt, which get the
largest slice of U.S. aid as a result of their participation in the
Camp David Middle East peace accord a decade ago.
   Israel is receiving $3 billion this year and Egypt $2.1 billion
from an overall aid budget of roughly $10 billion. The
administration has asked Congress for the same amounts for both
countries next year.

   The administration's choice of education aide
Robert Sweet to head $70 million in juvenile justice programs is
coming under renewed fire from Democrats as Republicans try to ease
him into the post.
   ``You're in a tough spot,'' Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph
Biden, D-Del., said Thursday after Sweet answered questions from
the panel for more than two hours at his confirmation hearing.
   Biden said the administration probably would not have tapped
Sweet for the post if he had refused to support a 90 percent cut in
the program from $70 million to $7.5 million proposed by President
Bush this year. Sweet is a firm supporter of the cut.
   Biden added, however, that support for the proposed slash in the
budget might just sink Sweet's chances of winning Senate approval
because the program is popular with lawmakers.
   The comment came on top of numerous complaints from Democrats
that the 52-year-old former White House adviser lacked the
experience to be administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice
and Delinquency Prevention in the Justice Department.
   The office distributes millions of dollars in federal grants to
state and local agencies to combat juvenile delinquency.
   ``I am troubled that an individual apparently without the
requisite credentials would be nominated for this important
position,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   Sweet, one-time head of the New Hampshire Moral Majority, has
drawn critics ranging from the National Parent-Teacher Association
to People for the American Way, a liberal Washington group.
   At least some opposition appears to stem from fierce political
infighting at the Department of Education while Sweet was an aide
there in the early 1980s. Former Education Secretary Terrel Bell
was highly critical of Sweet in his memoirs, ``The Thirteenth Man.''
   Those urging confirmation of Sweet range from the Boys Clubs of
America to Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who has been pointing out
that many opponents are financial beneficiaries of the government's
juvenile justice programs.
   ``It's understandable, may I observe, that the grantees would
like one of their own to be head of this office, but that may not
be such a good idea from the standpoint of prudence,'' Humphrey
told the committee.
   Sweet, a former high school teacher and textbook salesman, told
the panel that he had devoted his life to young people. He said his
background in education should meet a federal law requiring a
juvenile justice administrator with experience in the juvenile
justice field.
   ``I want to be an advocate of helping young people have a better
shot at life than they otherwise would have,'' Sweet said, adding
that he has been studying juvenile justice issues and would be ``a
quick study'' once he was in the post.
   ``I believe that Bob Sweet is fully qualified for this
position,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. ``I know him personally
and I support him.''
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., however, asked for written answers to
a number of questions about juvenile justice issues. He said the
replies should be more complete than the ones Sweet gave verbally.

   The U.S. Senate thinks it's time to play ball.
   Expressing dismay at baseball's lockout, the Senate voted 82-15
Thursday to urge an end to the dispute. But one senator called the
action a waste of time.
   ``Quite frankly, we are wasting everybody's time and we just
look like fools,'' said Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., describing it
as one of an ever-expanding number of ``irrelevant'' resolutions.
Owners and players, he said, don't care what the Senate thought of
the problem.
   His colleagues applauded him warmly but went ahead to adopt the
resolution sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and seven others.
   As the lockout reached its 15th day, Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho,
said the dispute showed baseball had forgotten ``those of us who
buy tickets and make billionaires out of owners and millionaires
out of players.''
   Negotiations between the owners and the players union have
stalemated over when the players become eligible for salary
arbitration. The union wants the time reduced to two years while
management is trying to keep it at three.
   The resolution called on ``baseball owners, players and their
negotiators to settle their differences promptly and begin a
complete spring training and regular season as soon as possible.''
   ``The negotiators in this dispute have an obligation to baseball
fans,'' the resolution said.

<TEXT>
   A $125 million bill to kindle the spirit of
volunteerism will get Americans away from ``the values of Wall
Street and go back to the values of Main Street,'' a lawmaker says.
   The measure is aimed at encouraging activities ranging from
teaching reading to cleanup drives in the nation's forests and
parks. It goes to the House after being approved Thursday in the
Senate after four days of intense bickering and maneuvering.
   It would authorize $125 million for volunteer programs through
the end of the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.
   ``What we do in this bill is begin to get away from the values
of Wall Street and go back to the values of Main Street, of
neighbor helping neighbor,'' Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., said
after the 78-19 Senate vote.
   The bill would earmark $25 million for school-based programs,
involving teachers' aides, tutoring and teaching reading. It also
would provide $35 million for a youth service corps, involving park
and forest cleanup programs for volunteers 16 to 25 years old.
   Included would be a full- and part-time national service program
for individuals 17 and older that would focus on service in
education, human services, environment and public safety. It would
be authorized at $25 million.
   Also included would be a $25 million Points of Light Foundation
sought by Republicans in keeping with President Bush's campaign
remark that the needy in America would be helped through volunteer
efforts from ``a thousand points of light.'' The foundation would
encourage volunteerism.
   Under the plan, states would bid for grants and the money would
be distributed by a $4 million Commission on National and Community
Service established by the bill.
   Some of the volunteers would receive living allowances and other
stipends as well as education and housing benefits under the bill.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the bill's floor manager,
needed four days to shoehorn it through a balky Senate as lawmakers
kept attempting to pile on amendments, some unrelated to
volunteerism.
   The Senate fought for two days over an amendment sponsored by
Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo., to allow Big Brothers and other
volunteer groups in the District of Columbia to bar homosexuals
from activities involving minors.
   The lawmakers finally adopted a Kennedy substitute version that
would allow the volunteer groups to bar homosexuals from such
activities if they had been convicted of a crime or were currently
faces charges.
   The amendment applied only to the nation's capital.
   ``It's just plain wrong for any arm of government to force
private volunteer groups to unite adult homosexuals with minors as
companions and role models,'' Armstrong said.
   Even after that issue was resolved, the debate dragged on for
hours as lawmakers sought to attach provisions concerning the
Nicaraguan elections and the repression of dissent in China.
   As the final vote neared, however, Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.,
took the floor to condemn the notion of paying volunteers.
   He said benefits paid to some volunteers under the program,
including living allowances and health insurance, were ``not in
keeping with the spirit of volunteerism.'' Sponsors replied that
poor people needed stipends because they felt the spirit of
volunteerism as much as the wealthy.

<HEAD>U.S. Says Mexico Funded Sandinistas Covertly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials say Mexico offered upward of
$11 million in covert assistance to Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega's campaign, far above the acknowledged U.S. donations to the
victorious opposition coalition.
   Mexican officials acknowledged that donations had been made but
said the U.S. figure was highly exaggerated, sources said Thursday.
   Under the laws governing Sunday's Nicaraguan election, foreign
contributions were required to have been reported to the Supreme
Electoral Council. Half of the cash contributions were to have been
shared with the council.
   The U.S. contribution to the campaign of President-elect Violeta
Chamorro was about $3.3. million. More than $5 million in
additional funds were provided for non-partisan activities, such as
registration and poll watching.
   Efforts to reach the Mexican Embassy on Thursday for comment
were unsuccessful but Nicaraguan Vice President Sergio Ramirez
denied the U.S. allegation when asked about it by the Los Angeles
Times.
   Ramirez said the Sandinistas reported all donations. The State
Department said media accounts indicated that foreign contributions
acknowledged by the Sandinistas totaled $300,000.
   According to Ramirez, no funds were received from the Mexican
government or the ruling PRI party. The information obtained by
U.S. officials indicated the contributions came from the PRI. The
initial report of the donation appeared in Newsday.
   While expressing irritation over the Mexican contribution, the
officials said it was not clear whether President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari was aware of it.
   The purported donation, which included cash, T-shirts, posters
and other items, was consistent with the support Mexico
historically has provided to the Sandinista government.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
moderately Friday, while the U.S. dollar fell slightly against the
Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
762.41 points Thursday, recouped 227.98 points, or 0.67 percent to
close at 34,057.56.
   The dollar closed the week at 149.75 yen, down 0.03 yen from
Thursday's close of 149.78 yen. After opening at 150.35 yen, the
currency ranged between 149.50 yen and 150.50 yen.
   In the bonds market, the yield on the No. 119 benchmark 10-year
bond closed at 7.125 percent, up from Thursday's close at 7.090
percent.
   A stock dealer for Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru Securities Co., who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said buying picked up in
midmorning, centering on blue-chip stocks such as high-tech issues.
   A stock trader at Nomura Securities, who also spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the Tokyo exchange has not yet recovered from
its continuing weakness during the last two weeks, but he said
there was no reason to fear a big collapse in the near future.
   ``Stock dealers have begun to understand the techniques of
arbitrage'' and other sophisticated trading techniques used by
foreign securities companies, which some have blamed for pulling
stock prices down during recent weeks.
   In arbitrage trading, traders aided by computers spot price gaps
between the stocks and stock-index futures and seek to profit from
them.
   On the foreign exchange market, Sumitomo Bank's Sumio Fukushima
said the dollar opened strong following its gains overnight in New
York.
   Buyers pushed the U.S. currency even higher to the mid-150 yen
range, he said, but intervention by the Bank of Japan stopped the
rise.
   Foreign exchange dealers said Japan's central bank engaged in
strong dollar-selling to bolster the yen. The bank does not confirm
or deny its market activities.
   But despite the government's efforts, there was still a
tremendous demand for dollars, said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange
analyst at New Japan Securities Co. The increased demand reflected
the rapid increase of Japanese firms investing abroad in real
estate and securities, he said.
   ``Also the (West German) mark weakened yesterday, which
strengthened the dollar and, in turn, weakened the yen,'' Kanai
said.
   ``The question is how far will the dollar be bought,'' given the
Bank of Japan's determined dollar-selling, he said.

   A Secret Service agent Thursday fired on a
skydiver who parachuted into a parking lot behind a hotel where
President Bush was staying. The man, who was not hurt, was later
arrested near his home, police said.
   Charles Sweeney, 47, of Newhall, hopped from a 36-story building
under construction, sailed across the street under his canopy and
landed behind the Century Plaze Hotel around 6 a.m. while the
president was inside, said Lt. Al Moen.
   A police officer on security detail for the president's arrival
saw the man land and alerted other officers and Secret Service
agents over the radio, Moen said.
   ``The parachutist then scooped up his parachute and ran to a
waiting car, which he drove in circles at a high rate of speed,''
said Moen. He said Sweeney drove near a Secret Service officer, who
fired a couple of rounds at the car.
   A police cruiser tried to seal off the parking lot, but
Sweeney's car bore down on the police car, and the officer got out
of the way, said Moen.
   Sweeney was later arrested near his home, booked for
investigation of assault with a deadly weapon on an officer and
freed on $3,000 bail, Moen said.
   Sweeney did not immediately return a telephone call late
Thursday.
   Secret Service agents in Los Angeles declined to comment,
referring calls to the Washington office, which was closed.

<HEAD>Strike for Multiparty Democracy Shuts Shops, Halts Traffic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shops closed, traffic halted and students
stayed at home today to support a nationwide strike called by two
outlawed parties to push a movement for multiparty democracy in the
Himalayan kingdom.
   The strike was the second called by the Nepali Congress Party
and the Communist Party of Nepal since they launched the campaign
Feb. 18 for restoration of the multiparty system in the national
assembly, called the Rashtriya Panchayat.
   A Feb. 19 strike sparked widespread violence throughout Nepal,
leaving at least three people dead by police gunfire, according to
the government. Activists claimed five people were killed and 12
were injured.
   The government says at least nine more people died since then in
sporadic violence but the activists claim at least twice as many
died.
   Ganesh Man Singh, a top leader of the Nepali Congress, said the
government ``is bent upon unleashing widespread violence to provoke
the peaceful agitators like they did on Feb. 19.''
   No violence was reported today as police patrolled Katmandu's
nearly deserted streets. A few private vehicles and motor rickshaws
were seen on the roads.
   Buses leaving Katmandu, the capital, were escorted by armed
police in jeeps, but few passengers traveled. Buses coming into
Katmandu were half empty.
   ``Nobody wants to travel because of the strike,'' said a
passenger who arrived from Dani, 115 miles northwest of the
capital. He did not wish to identified.
   The Communist Party and the Nepali Congress Party demand an end
to a 29-year-old royal decree that banned all political parties in
the kingdom, one of the world's oldest monarchies.
   A Home Ministry statement said, ``It is common knowledge that
extremist communists ... have been active in disruptive force since
Feb. 18.''
   The ``government would never lag behind legal action against
those who attempt to disrupt public life,'' the statement said.
   Power in Nepal is shared between the king and the Rashtriya
Panchayat. One-fifth of the assembly's 140 members are nominated by
the king. The rest are elected.
   The government of King Birendra says the campaign to lift the
ban on political parties runs counter to a 1980 referendum which
narrowly voted for retaining the Panchayat's system of nonpartisan
membership.
   Former Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, one of the earliest
advocates of the non-partisan system, said today: ``Nepal's current
problem should be solved with mutual understanding.
   ``The government has, however, decided to end political crisis
with the use of force and repression. Such an animal instinct will
not do,'' said Thapa, an assembly member.
   Nepal's two-year experiment with Western-style democracy ended
in 1961 when King Mahendra, father of the present monarch,
dissolved the government of the Nepali Congress Party, accusing it
of corruption and poor administration.

<HEAD>Senate Inaction Prompts Turkey to Lift Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turkey lifted restrictions on U.S. military
personnel there after the U.S. Senate refused to pass a resolution
commemorating the alleged genocide of Armenians seven decades ago.
   The Turkish government notified the U.S. ambassador of the move,
saying senators had acted ``in a statesmanlike manner'' to quash
the resolution, which the government considered ``a distortion of
the historical facts.''
   The restrictions, imposed after the Senate Judiciary Committee
approved the resolution last Oct. 18, barred certain kinds of
meetings on defense cooperation and U.S. activities at the Konya
bombing range, suspended visits by U.S. ships and denied permission
for new construction at four major U.S. military facilities in
Turkey.
   The resolution, sponsored by Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., would have
marked April 24 as a day to remember the Armenian genocide in
1915-1923. Dole shelved the measure late Tuesday after the Senate
refused to break a filibuster against it.
   Armenians claim the alleged massacre killed 1.5 million people
during the Ottoman empire, but Turkish officials dispute that
assertion. They say some 600,000 people died during the period,
including Muslims and Christians, as a result of civil strife and
marauding bands.

   Despite concern by food companies, truckers
continue to alternate garbage hauls with shipments of beef and
other edible products, according to lawmakers.
   Truckers, senators and the Bush administration could not agree
at a hearing Thursday on how best to stop the practice, which is
known as ``backhauling.''
   It has been 10 months since a central Pennsylvania newspaper
reported that refrigerated food-hauling trucks known as ``reefers''
were being loaded with municipal solid waste at a transfer station.
   In October, truckers told a House panel about the related
practice of hauling chemicals and juice back to back.
   ``While there has been almost universal agreement on the need to
end these most egregious practices, unfortunately, garbage
backhauling is still legal and is still occurring every day,'' Rep.
Chris Smith, R-N.J., told a Senate Commerce subcommittee Thursday.
   The House Public Works and Transportation Committee and the
House Energy and Commerce Committee are trying to reconcile
differences between bills they have approved to end backhauling.

   Israel announced today that it will renew
diplomatic relations with Bulgaria after a 23-year hiatus, when
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens visits Sofia in the near future.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yosef Amihud said the date of Arens'
visit has not been determined yet, but Israel radio said relations
would be renewed within a month.
   ``The initiative came from the government of Bulgaria, and we
praise it,'' Amihud said.
   Bulgaria would become the fourth East European country to renew
diplomatic relations with Israel.
   The Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries, except
for Romania, severed relations with Israel in 1967 to protest its
occupation of land belonging to Moscow's Arab allies in the Middle
East war of that year.
   Hungary was the first to re-establish relations in September,
followed by Czechoslovakia Feb. 9 and Poland on Tuesday.
   The Soviet Union and Israel have exchanged consular offices but
the Kremlin says renewal of full diplomatic relations is
conditional on progress in the Middle East peace process.
   Israel has been also negotiating the establishment of ties with
East Germany following its acceptance of some responsibility for
the genocide of Jews during the years of the Nazi rule.
   East Germany's previous stand of denying any responsibility for
Nazi deeds has prevented the two countries from having any
relations.

<HEAD>West German Politicians Dominate East German Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ERFURT, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German politicians are enjoying
celebrity status in East Germany's first free election campaign in
40 years.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
and former Chancellor Willy Brandt have been among the visiting
campaigners who have drawn crowds of up to 100,000 at election
rallies.
   Some Communists and members of other leftist groups say the Bonn
leaders should stay out of the campaign being waged by their sister
parties for the March 18 parliamentary elections.
   But most East Germans seem to welcome the support, saying Kohl,
Genscher and Brandt are providing their nation with a crucial
lesson in democracy.
   ``The questions being addressed here concern the people in West
Germany too,'' said Karl-Heinz Gandre of Erfurt. ``We are one
people, and we belong together,'' Gandre said.
   Gandre was in a crowd of 60,000 people waving West German flags
and chanting ``Germany, united fatherland'' as they greeted
Genscher at a rally for the centrist Association of Free Democrats
in Erfurt.
   Politicians in East Germany's new pro-democracy movements are
relatively unknown and inexperienced. They benefit from the
reflected fame of the visiting West German politicians, who are
well-known from West German television broadcasts that blanketed
the country even before the frontiers were opened last fall
following a popular movement for democratic reforms.
   For the West German leaders, the campaign is an opportunity to
shape the future of a new Germany and perhaps establish a power
base in this nation of 16 million now that uniting the two
countries appears inevitable.
   Open politicking is new in East Germany, and some campaign
posters have been torn down and defaced. Under the old Communist
regime, political signs were virtually sacrosanct.
   ``Partly, this is still a very undisciplined campaign,'' said
Ulli Mueller, another Erfurt resident who came to hear Genscher.
``There's no experience in making democracy work here, because
we've been ruled by one man for so many years.''
   He referred to former Communist leader Erich Honecker, who was
ousted in October after 18 years of hard-line rule.
   Communist Premier Hans Modrow remains the most popular
politician in East Germany, despite the party's fall from power,
according to West German media polls.
   Despite his personal prestige, Modrow's party is expected to
finish no better than a distant third in the March vote, trailing
the Social Democrats and the conservative Alliance for Germany.
   Brandt, the architect of the 1970s period of detente between the
two German states, kicked off the East German Social Democrats'
campaign in Leipzig.
   Kohl chose Erfurt to make his debut on East Germany's campaign
circuit, addressing a cheering crowd of 100,000. The rally was
organized by a three-party coalition, including the East German
version of Kohl's Christian Democrats.
   Some people in the audience chanted ``Helmut! Helmut!'' There
were also a few hecklers, and fliers reading ``Kohl, do your
campaigning at home'' were pasted over campaign posters throughout
the city.
   ``What Mr. Kohl is doing is just party politics,'' said
Hannelore Tauer, an East Berlin supermarket clerk. ``It's not doing
the West or East German people any good.''
   But that seemed to be a minority view.
   ``The politicians in West Germany ... have done a lot for East
Germany before, so I think it's right they come to the election
campaign here,'' Gandre said.

<HEAD>Soldiers Deserting; Army Reportedly Hiding Weapons</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Draftees in the Sandinista-controlled
army are deserting their ranks and the military is reportedly
hiding arms ahead of next month's swearing in of an opposition
government.
   Sandinista officials on Thursday acknowledged the desertions but
denied weapons and ammunition were being squirreled away.
   Also Thursday, President Daniel Ortega called on the United
States to resume aid on the day he steps down to the opposition
coalition that upset his leftist party in Sunday's election.
   ``The best that could happen would be for the Contras (rebel
guerrillas) to be demobilized by April 25 and for the United States
to lift the embargo and send the aid it has promised starting that
day,'' Ortega told Nicaraguan journalists.
   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who is due to succeed Ortega as
president on April 25, has echoed Ortega's call for the Contras to
lay down their weapons.
   Her United National Opposition (UNO) and Ortega's Sandinistas
are beginning to discuss the process of transition. The Sandinistas
staked out a tough set of positions Tuesday, including the
dismantling of the U.S.-supported Contra rebels from their Honduran
jungle camps.
   Honduran officials today were expected to join Sandinista and
UNO officials on shutting down the Honduran rebels camps.
   The Sandinistas, who receive Soviet and Cuban aid, have also
demanded the army and the Interior Ministry security forces remain
intact, at least until the U.S.-backed rebels disband.
   The close link between the Sandinista party and army and
security forces has been a source of strength for the Sandinistas,
but the army's integrity was questioned as reports of desertions
circulated.
   The deserters _ draftees doing two years of compulsory military
service _ apparently have decided not to wait for the inauguration
of Mrs. Chamorro, who is committed to banning the draft.
   ``They took our weapons away on Monday and didn't give them
back,'' Juan Carlos Medina, 18, told The Associated Press. ``Maybe
they didn't trust us.''
   Medina said 40 out of 60 young draftees in his unit, stationed
at the main air force base in Managua, deserted this week. He said
the officers seem to want to ignore the problem.
   The desertions are ``normal under the current situation,'' said
Lt. Col. Rosa Pasos, Defense Ministry spokeswoman.
   ``We definitely don't want to have people who don't want to be
with us,'' Ms. Pasos said. ``And anyway, we're going to reduce the
army.''
   The deserters also reported weapons stored by the military.
   One deserter told of tunnels being dug in an army post in San
Nicolas, near the northern town of Esteli, in which to hide weapons.
   A government official said 600 weapons, including
Soviet-designed AK-47 assault rifles, were taken from the regional
military headquarters in Juigalpa to the remote town of El Rama, in
central Nicaragua near the Atlantic Coast, on Monday.
   On Wednesday, a witness saw trucks from the Ministry of
Construction taking about 600 boxes of ammunition out of an army
depot. An army source said the ammunition was going to be hidden at
Construction Ministry facilities.
   UNO leaders have expressed concern to international observers
about weapons being taken by boat across Lake Nicaragua into the
southern province of Rio San Juan.
   But Capt. Nelba Blandon, spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry,
denied the reports.
   ``Those are just rumors to try to affect the dignified image of
the Sandinista Front,'' Ms. Blandon said.
   ``Just the fact that for us it (losing the elections) was an
enormous surprise means we could not have set up a plan to
transport weapons,'' she added.
   The Episcopal Conference of Nicaragua, the top Roman Catholic
religious leaders, called for a peaceful transition and said the
Sandinistas must give up all power.
   ``The current government must give up each and every one of the
powers that correspond to the new democratically elected
government,'' said the bishops' statement, released Thursday.
   Juan Cueva, special representative of Honduran President Rafael
Callejas, was in Managua on Thursday to meet with Mrs. Chamorro,
Ortega and Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto.
   Cueva said the meetings were scheduled to start today and that
his job was to help hasten the rebels' demobilization from Honduran
jungle camps.
   Israel Galeano, the Contras chief of staff, has said his forces
will not disperse until the Sandinistas are out of power.

<HEAD>Former Official Wanted In Camarena Case Arrested, But No Plans To
Extradite</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities arrested a former Mexican
Interpol chief on drug and weapons charges, but they said there
were no plans to extradite him to California for trial in the
slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena.
   Federal agents arrested Miguel Aldana Ibarra at a restaurant in
Mexico City on Wednesday, the attorney general's office said
Thursday.
   Aldana, 44, and four others were indicted Feb. 1 by a federal
grand jury in Los Angeles on charges of participating in the 1985
murder of Camarena, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, and a
Mexican pilot.
   When asked whether the Mexican government planned to extradite
Aldana, a spokesman at the Mexican attorney general's office said,
``No.''
   There was no immediate word from U.S. officials regarding
Aldana, who until four years ago headed Mexico's Interpol, the
international law enforcement agency.
   Camarena's slaying strained U.S.-Mexican relations amid
allegations of corruption among Mexican police officials.
   The Mexican attorney general's spokesman, Arturo Antelmo, said
Aldana was arrested in connection with a huge operation to smuggle
marijuana to the United States five years ago.
   The 9,000 tons of marijuana seized at the Buffalo Ranch, in the
northern state of Chihuahua near the Texas border, was the biggest
drug bust in Mexican history.
   ``He was picked up on a warrant for involvement in the 1985 case
at the Buffalo Ranch, and also for the cocaine and six AR-15
automatic rifles found at his Cuernavaca home,'' Antelmo said in a
telephone interview.
   Agents raided Aldana's house in Cuernavaca, 50 miles southeast
of Mexico City, after the Wednesday arrest, the attorney general's
office said in a statement.
   The government confiscated 2.3 pounds of cocaine, six automatic
rifles, two pistols and ammunition, the statement said. Seven other
people are being held for questioning in the case, it said.
   Aldana told reporters in January that Camarena had been in
league with drug smugglers and was never killed. He alleged the
slain drug agent had plastic surgery and was living off drug
profits in California.
   The statements were made after the January broadcast of the NBC
mini-series ``The Drug Wars'' about the Camarena killing.
Government officials were outraged by the program, saying that it
painted a distorted picture of Mexican law enforcement efforts
against drug smuggling.
   Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, were killed after
the agent led a series of raids on marijuana plantations allegedly
operated by Rafael Caro Quintero, who ran the drug ring.
   The bodies, showing signs of torture, were found March 5, 1985,
on a ranch 65 miles southeast of Guadalajara, 360 miles northwest
of Mexico City.
   The indictment in Los Angeles charged Aldana along with Manuel
Ibarra Herrera, the former head of the Mexican Federal Judicial
Police, and three others participated in the killing to protect the
operations of a Guadalajara drug cartel, according to the U.S.
Department of Justice.
   Aldana resigned from his Interpol post on Jan. 2, 1986, after
serving 24 years as a law enforcement officer. He quit after the
weekly magazine Proceso said a drug defendant had testified that a
shipment of Colombian cocaine seized at the Mexico City airport was
for Aldana.
   The defendant later recanted, claiming his testimony was made
under duress.
   Since then, Aldana has been a working as a lawyer.

   Greyhound's 6,300 drivers went on strike early
Friday against America's only nationwide bus company. The union
said its drivers would take passengers to their next scheduled stop
before joining the 50-state walkout.
   ``We went on strike because the company has refused to bargain
in good faith, and we have struck because the company insisted on
imposing'' its original offer, said union spokesman Jeffrey Nelson
said in Scottsdale, Ariz.
   The strike began at 12:05 MST after talks broke off in
Scottsdale despite the arrival late Thursday of a federal mediator.
No new talks were scheduled.
   Also on strike were 3,075 of the company's office and
maintenance workers in the union, the Amalgamated Council of
Greyhound Locals, whose old, three-year contract with Greyhound
Lines Inc. expired at midnight Thursday.
   ``This is a damn pure shame to have to do business like this.
All we want is some of what we've given up over the last few
years,'' said a driver early Friday at a Greyhound terminal in
Phoenix. He would not give his name.
   In Dallas, pickets forced two Greyhound buses to stop just
outside the downtown terminal, about two blocks from the skyscraper
where the company's corporate offices are located. The pickets
cheered as the drivers left their buses, which were then taken over
by company officials. In one instance, passengers got off a bus and
helped guide it past pickets into the terminal.
   Greyhound, which says it serves 9,500 U.S. communities and is
the only public intercity transportation in about 9,000, had
arranged schedules so that no new runs would begin after the strike
deadline, and Nelson said working drivers would continue to their
next stop at that time, then join picket lines.
   ``While we regret the decision of the (union) to strike, we will
be in operation to serve our passengers,'' said Greyhound vice
president P. Anthony Lannie, chief negotiator.
   Lannie said Greyhound would operate with replacements and any
employees who come to work. He said the company would give
preference to routes connecting major urban centers and plans to be
at full service by the end of the month.
   Greyhound has ``declared a war on the members of this union,''
said Harold Mendlowitz, president of Local 1202 in New York City,
which also covers Albany, N.Y.; Hartford, Conn., and Montreal.
   ``If it's a fight that they want it's a fight they are going to
get,'' said Mendlowitz. ``They want to force us out. They want to
bust this union.''
   Elizabeth Hale said the company advised passengers this week of
the possibility of a strike and worked to reduce the number of
buses on the road at midnight. About 22 million people rode
Greyhound last year, the company said.
   ``We'll do our best to get that person to their final
destination and take care of his or her needs in the interim,'' Ms.
Hale said.
   The company has been advertising for drivers, and as of last
week had 600 in training. Ms. Hale did not have an updated number
of new hires.
   Amtrak, meanwhile, told ticket agents to honor Greyhound tickets
when buses are not available, railroad spokeswoman Sue Martin said
in Washington, D.C. She said no additional fare would be charged,
but added that some trains require reservations and that bus
passengers may find no space on crowded routes.
   The 3-year-old company earned its first profit last year after
being created in a buyout of Phoenix-based Greyhound Corp.'s bus
operations.
   Drivers' wages were the main unresolved issue, with the company
offering a 6.9 percent first-year raise and 13.5 percent during the
three-year contract. Drivers earned an average of $24,743 last
year, according to the company.
   The company says the union wants a 33 percent first-year raise,
a figure Nelson called ``false and ... misleading.''
   Dallas-based Greyhound Lines Inc. was formed when an investment
group led by Fred G. Currey paid $270 million to buy the Greyhound
bus system from Greyhound Corp. Four months later, the group paid
$80 million for Trailways Lines Inc., the country's largest
operator of Trailways buses.
   As part of the deal, the union agreed to a 22 percent wage cut,
and Greyhound said the drivers were trying to win back the entire
amount at one time.
   The company expects to earn a profit of about $730,000 on $1
billion in revenue. In the previous two years, the company lost $20
million.

   When Violeta Barrios de Chamorro told
an audience of peasants last year that she was going to Europe to
``bring you back a piece of the Berlin Wall,'' she drew
disbelieving laughter.
   Few in the rural town of Nandaime had ever heard of the Berlin
Wall. Why would someone bring them a piece of a wall?
   Although in recent months Mrs. Chamorro and other United
National Opposition (UNO) politicians frequently portrayed
themselves as riding the tide of democracy that swept Eastern
Europe last year, that theme had little resonance inside Nicaragua.
   ``Eastern Europe? You mean, the people who gave us aid?'' said
Mario Ramirez, a Sandinista party activist, when asked if he
thought Eastern Europe had affected the voting.
   ``I think when people went to the polls, they voted with their
stomachs. And I think they thought about the empty stomachs of
their children,'' said Paul Reichler, a Washington lawyer who
advises President Daniel Ortega.
   Sunday's vote for change from a fractured economy and the strain
of civil war against the U.S.-supported Contras swept Ortega's
leftist Sandinistas from power in favor of Mrs. Chamorro, who takes
office April 25. It marks the end of Sandinista government, which
began with the ouster of dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979.
   But while the example of Eastern Europe did not reach the
average voter, the forces that caused change there affected the
atmosphere and structure of the campaign, as well as the
Sandinistas' decision to hold and accept the consequences of a free
vote.
   ``They had to change because the world was changing,'' said
Mauricio Diaz, secretary-general of the Social Christian Party.
   The Bush administration credits the Soviet Union and President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev with encouraging Nicaragua's move to democracy.
   Additionally, reductions in East bloc aid and the visible
failures of socialism affected the Sandinistas' own economic and
political policies.
   ``The Sandinistas started out trying to build a nation on the
Cuban model, but they really gave up on that by 1984,'' Diaz said.
   He and other analysts say the Sandinistas were driven to
democracy and a mixed-economy theory by the hostility of the United
States and the horrible state of their own economy.
   The process was gradual, both impeded and propelled by the war
against U.S.-supported Contra guerrillas _ impeded by the need to
maintain wartime political discipline, propelled by the damage the
war did to the economy.
   Real change did not take place until the United States halted
lethal aid to the Contras in early 1988.
   Shortly after the U.S. Congress voted to cut off aid, the
Sandinistas put in place an economic austerity plan, ``An IMF
(International Monetary Fund) plan without the IMF,'' as Ortega put
it.
   While some of the plan's more Draconian proposals for firing
public employees were not carried out, enough was done to hurt poor
people badly, according to Patricia O'Kane, a researcher at the
Regional Coordinator for Economic and Social Research in Managua.
   The Sandinistas began wooing the private sector and acknowledged
errors in some of their confiscation and expropriation policies.
   ``It was tropical perestroika. They tried to reform the
revolution, but it was too late,'' Diaz said.
   Still, there were noticeable changes in the last year. Private
advertising in newspapers and on radio and television picked up.
New cars began to appear on the streets; also new streetlights, and
some street repairs were made.
   In a strange conjunction that also occurred in Poland under
Wojciech Jaruzelski's government, the country held its first beauty
pageant in years.
   ``They're very pragmatic. I think they began those moves as pure
tactics _ the opening towards democracy, a mixed economy,
non-alignment. But somehow it became more than tactics,'' said Diaz.
   ``They took a big gamble and they really thought they were going
to win. They totally underestimated the effects of the economic
crisis,'' O'Kane said.
   Ortega and other Sandinistas insist their party is not anything
like the communist parties of Eastern Europe.
   Ortega has said the comparison is invalid because he won 40
percent of the vote _ much more than any communist party in Eastern
Europe is likely to gain.
   Diaz noted that Nicaragua was never ruled by an all-encompassing
single party.
   ``There were always independent unions, though weak, there was
always a private sector, there was always a political opposition,''
he said.
   He believes the influence of a nearby and very interested United
States was a factor.
   ``People were tired of always fighting the United States,'' he
said. ``Now, everyone's waiting for the first McDonald's to open.''
   The Sandinistas are not complete democrats, however, said Diaz.
   ``They linked the party, the army and security forces and the
government in a kind of triangle,'' he said.
   They've lost the government, but they are currently fighting in
negotations with the opposition to hold on to the party-army link,
their last hold on power.
   Diaz said he thought there was real irony in the Sandinista
evolution.
   ``Just as they were becoming democratic, they lost an
election,'' he said.

<HEAD>Army Seeks Repayment of Scholarship That Went to Homosexual</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ROTC is seeking to recover a $25,000
scholarship it gave to a star recruit who lost his commission after
disclosing he's gay.
   James Holobaugh, 24, was to have been commissioned by the Army
in May, when he disclosed his homosexuality. The military withdrew
the commission and moved to make Holobaugh reimburse the Reserve
Officers' Training Corps for the scholarship at Washington
University.
   The Pentagon regards homosexuals as unsuitable for military
service and does not knowingly permit them to serve.
   Its policy, stating that the presence of homosexuals ``would
seriously impair discipline, good order, morale and security,'' was
upheld by the Supreme Court in two decisions Monday.
   It is not unusual for homosexual cadets to be removed from ROTC,
but this is apparently the first case in which the Army had asked
for its scholarship money back, said William B. Rubenstein,
Holobaugh's attorney.
   Holobaugh was rated one of the top performers in his ROTC class
and was selected by the Army to be in a nationwide advertising
campaign to attract students.
   Holobaugh, who expects to graduate in the spring, said that he
was dating women when he began college in 1984. It wasn't until
late 1988 or early 1989 that he realized he was homosexual,
Holobaugh said.
   Holobaugh said he was ``appalled at the prejudice'' in the
military against homosexuals. ``It's kind of blowing my mind,'' he
said.
   ``I will without a doubt fight to not have to pay back my
scholarship,'' he said.
   His case is being reviewed by the commander of the Army Second
Region at Fort Knox, Ky.
   At an informal hearing in December, the Army questioned whether
Holobaugh was masquerading as a homosexual to evade his service
obligation, but later ruled that no such evidence existed, said
Rubenstein, who is also staff counsel for the Lesbian and Gay
Rights project of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   After completing the ROTC program, students commissioned as
officers must serve in the military for four years of active duty
or eight years in reserves.
   Washington University supports Holobaugh. Its provost of the
university, Edward S. Macias, wrote to Lt. Col. Robert L. Bates,
the ROTC commander, saying the ban on homosexuals was
``inconsistent with the nondiscriminatory values of this _ and I
should think virtually all _ universities.''

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Stocks Rise Moderately in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar closed slightly lower against the yen
today, pushed back by rumors that Japan's central bank will raise
its official discount rate. Share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange gained moderately.
   The dollar closed the week at 149.75 yen, down 0.03 yen from
Thursday's close of 149.78 yen. After opening at 150.35 yen, the
currency ranged between 149.50 yen and 150.50 yen.
   It was the first time that the dollar's trading range rose to
the 150-yen level since June.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, commenting on the dollar's rise,
told reporters that Japan's economic fundamentals remain solid and
that the ``situation is not such that we are coming to a crisis,''
Kyodo News Service reported.
   But Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told a regular news
conference that he was ``extremely worried'' about the yen's
continued decline against the dollar, though there has been no
adverse effect on the country's economy and prices.
   Both Kaifu and Hashimoto said the situation must be watched
carefully.
   Currency dealers said the dollar continued to rise in the
morning session, despite the reported dollar-selling intervention
by the Bank of Japan, but the dollar was sold because of the
interest rate rumors.
   The rumor was found later to be groundless.
   ``Many market players consider the dollar's underlying sentiment
basically remains bullish because of the currency's actual
demand,'' said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, who spoke
anonymously.
   There has been speculation for weeks that the central bank will
raise its official discount rate, the rate charged on its loans to
commercial banks, in a range of 0.5-1.0 percent. The rate is
currently 4.25 percent.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which lost 762.41 points Thursday, recouped 227.98 points,
or 0.67 percent, to close at 34,057.56.
   A total of 570 million shares changed hands, down from 620
million shares traded on Thursday.
   Securities dealers said the Tokyo market is showing a gradual
recovery, despite rising interest rates on Japanese bonds and the
yen's relative weakness. Declining bond prices were partly
responsible for the sagging stock market over the last two weeks.
   ``Today, the market proved its strength in spite of such
negative factors,'' said Masahiro Umemori, an equity analyst with
Nomura Securities.
   In the bonds market, the yield on the No. 119 benchmark 10-year
bond closed at 7.125 percent, up from Thursday's close at 7.090
percent.

<HEAD>Costa Rica Asks For Extradition Of American Linked To Bombing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Costa Rica will ask the United
States to extradite an Indiana man for the 1984 bombing of a news
conference in which four people were killed, a Foreign Ministry
source said.
   The source, who did not want to be identified by name, said the
Costa Rican Embassy in Washington will present the extradition
request Monday for John Hull, who skipped bond and fled to the
United States last July after living 20 years in Costa Rica.
   In an interview Thursday from his home in Patoka, Ind., Hull
said the charge of planning the bombing is ``completely false and
it's completely politically motivated.'' He said the Costa Rican
government objects to his ties to an American religious
organization.
   Hull, who owned a ranch near the Nicaraguan border, was accused
of supplying weapons to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   The May 31, 1984, explosion in a house in Penca, Nicaragua,
killed three reporters _ American reporter Linda Frazier, two Costa
Rican journalists and a Nicaraguan rebel. They were attending a
news conference by Eden Pastora, a Contra rebel commander at the
time who had defected from the Sandinista government.
   Pastora, who was believed to be the target of the bombing, and
about a dozen other people were injured.
   Prosecutor Jorge Chavarria said Hull and Felipe Vidal, a Cuban,
planned the bombing to avenge Pastora's statements linking Hull to
the CIA. The whereabouts of Vidal and the man who placed the bomb
have not been determined.
   Hull said he had not heard from either U.S. or Costa Rican
officials by Thursday night.
   ``As I understand it, before they can extradite a U.S. citizen,
they have to prove the charges in a U.S. court,'' he said. ``They
could have proved the charges in a court down there because you can
manipulate judges and everyone else in the judicial system, but you
can't do that here in the United States.'' Maximo Esquivel, a judge
in northern Costa Rica, was quoted in Thursday's editions of The
New York Times as saying he signed the extradition order last
month. Esquivel's office said the judge would not make any
statement about the matter when The Associated Press contacted his
office by telephone Thursday in Quesada, about 100 miles north of
San Jose.
   The status of Hull's nationality is unclear. While the Costa
Rican government claims he has acquired Costa Rica citizenship,
Hull referred to himself as an American on Thursday.
   Hull was released from a hospital Thursday in Evansville, Ind.,
where he had been treated for heart problems. He said recently
returned from a trip to El Salvador for the Toledo-based Americans
Helping America organization, providing Bibles and securing
chaplins for the military there.
   Hull was jailed last year in Costa Rica, accused of drug
trafficking to help the rebels and of violating Costa Rica's
neutrality. He fled to Indiana after his release on $37,000 bond.

   The Seabrook nuclear plant overcame two
decades of protests, legal challenges, ballooning costs and the
financial ruin of its chief investor to capture the ultimate prize:
a license to operate.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted 3-0 Thursday to grant
the $6.5 billion reactor a full-power license. But the appeal
process will hold up the license for at least two weeks, and
Seabrook opponents pressed on.
   About 125 anti-Seabrook demonstrators waved signs, chanted and
blocked plant gates after the decision. More than 70 were arrested.
   At the NRC meeting in Rockville, Md., utility executives hugged
each other after the ruling, and maintenance workers at the
1,200-plus employee plant hoisted a sign reading, ``Startup '90: We
Have the Power.''
   ``It's a milestone in the lives of our employees, more than just
mortar and bricks,'' said Edward Brown, president of Seabrook
operator New Hampshire Yankee.
   Seabrook, perhaps the nation's most hotly contested nuclear
plant, became a symbol of the anti-nuclear movement, and its foes
claimed a broader victory, contending that as a result of the long
fight against Seabrook, no utility would risk the costs of trying
to build and open another nuclear plant.
   Conceived in 1968, it was proposed in 1972 as a twin-reactor
plant costing less than $1 billion. Construction delays and cost
increases forced the cancellation of one reactor in the mid-1980s
and plunged lead owner Public Service Co. of New Hampshire into
bankruptcy reorganization in 1988.
   The plant was held up largely by concerns over whether the area
could be evacuated in an emergency. The NRC ruling ratified
recommendations by its staff and several lower-level boards that
the plant is safe and that evacuation plans would work.
   ``I would be happy to live within two miles of this plant and I
wouldn't worry about it at all,'' said NRC Chairman Kenneth Carr.
   Weeks before Thursday's licensing, plant operators raised
temperatures and pressure in the 1,150-megawatt reactor to ready it
for nuclear fission.
   ``We're going to stay at temperature and pressure and as soon as
we get the license in hand, we're ready to go,'' said Brown.
   The decision gives opponents seven days to file an appeal; seven
days after the filing the license becomes effective unless a judge
issues a stay. If the appeal fails, ascension to full power could
take two to three months.
   Seabrook opponents remained undaunted, saying the final battles
now move into an arena more likely to rule in their favor.
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon and two
environmental groups planned to ask for a stay of the license next
week in the federal appeals court in Washington.
   ``It's correct to say there has never been a case where the
court has overturned an NRC license, but it's also correct to say
that there has never been a license issued which has been so
legally vulnerable,'' Shannon said.
   Those vulnerabilities include what opponents consider the NRC's
violation of its own procedures in rulings on emergency evacuation
plans for the densely populated New Hampshire and Massachusetts
communities near the plant.
   One of Seabrook's most prominent opponents, Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, refused to summit emergency plans in 1986 after
declaring that safe evacuation was impossible. The NRC then
accepted utility-drafted plans for Massachusetts.
   In Boston on Thursday, Dukakis held George Bush, who defeated
him in the 1988 presidential election, partially responsible for
the NRC action. Bush's support of the plant ``has made a
significant difference here,'' he said.
   Bush supported Seabrook while campaigning for New Hampshire's
1988 presidential primary, with John Sununu, then New Hampshire's
governor and now White House chief of staff, leading his campaign.
Sununu is a staunch Seabrook supporter.
   Overall, there have been more than 3,200 arrests in
anti-Seabrook protests, which peaked in the mid-1970s during
construction and picked up again last summer as the plant drew
closer to a full-power license.
   Carr on Thursday defended the commission's handling of the
Seabrook license.
   ``We see nothing at present that persuades us that Seabrook
cannot be operated safely,'' the NRC chairman said. ``This is one
of the most closely scrutinized and safely built plants in the
world.''

   The 70 mushers in this year's Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race will face some of the worst weather in the
race's 18-year history.
   ``Conditions are as bad as they possibly can be,'' said race
manager Jack Niggemyer. ``Nature is throwing everything at us it
can. It might slow things down a bit.'' The race begins Saturday.
   Wind chill readings to 60 degrees below zero, the deepest snow
in a quarter-century, ash from Redogale-force winds
are combining to make things extremely difficult for trailbreakers
who on snowmachines are trying to groom the 1,100-mile
Anchorage-to-Nome run.
   At leaubt Volcano and st 30 inches of new snow on the south side of
the Alaska
Range has virtually smothered hundreds of miles of trail, and winds
in the desolate Farewell Burn have shaped 8-foot drifts that
threaten to turn another 100 or so miles into a frozen pattern of
furrows.
   ``Your nightmare has come true,'' Niggemyer said.
   ``Shades of '85,'' said Iditarod veteran Dee Dee Jonrowe of
Willow, referring to the year in which deep snow stalled the race.
``I think this should be our goal: The Idit-a-made-it.''
   Among the mushers entered this year are four-time winner Rick
Swenson, of Two Rivers; three-time winner Susan Butcher, of Manley;
defending champion Joe Runyan, of Nenana, and 84-year-old Norman
Vaughn, of Trapper Creebaum, the spiritual leader of the Satmar sect,
was a weekly target of the paper, whose circulation was estimated
at from 500 to 2,000 copies.
   ``This was worse than yellow journalism,'' Rabbi Chaim Stauber,
an associate of Teitelbaum, told The New York Times. ``He stopped
short of nothing. There was absolutely no moral code, no bounds.''
   Officials said that Teitelbaum's secretary, Rabbi Moses
Friedman, told the district attorney about the extortion threat and
offered to cooperate.
   Yiddish-speaking investigators eavesdropped Wednesday when
Shaulson visited Friedman's house in Brooklyn, officials said.
Police said Friedman gave Shaulson $1,000, then signed a contract
with Shaulson that the negative attacks would cease. Shaulson was
arrested minutes later.

   The Fox network will broadcast the Emmy
Awards for the next three years, the Academy of Television Arts and
Sciences announced.
   Published reports have indicated that Fox Broadcasting Co. will
pay the Academy around $9 million for the rights to the show, which
will be seen on 129 Fox affiliates. Fox has broadcast the Emmy show
for the last three years.
   The contract requires Fox to broadcast the previously
non-televised presentation of Emmy awards for creative arts
categories from 1990 to 1992.

   A drug dealer was convicted of murder for
supplying the cocaine that caused a college student's death.
   ``We like to think this would put people on notice that there
are other consequences to selling drugs besides distribution
charges,'' said Dan Connally, assistant district attorney.
   A jury Wednesday convicted Brad Noble Palmer, 34, in the 1984
overdose death of Ryan Richardson, an 18-year-old freshman at
Panhandle State University.
   Connally said prosecutors charged Palmer with murder because he
knew an earlier dose taken by Richardson had made him so ill that
he was hospitalized.
   Jurors recommended a 25-year prison term. Sentencing was set for
March 19.

   A businessman who played a role in the
Iran-Contra scandal admitted taking part in a scheme to sell
confidential Ashland Oil Co. documents to an Iranian company
involved in a dispute with Ashland.
   Roy M. Furmark, 58, an oil broker, pleaded guilty Thursday in
federal court to conspiring with former Ashland chairman Orin
Atkins to provide secret information to the National Iranian Oil
Co. about Ashland's decision not to pay NIOC for $283 million worth
of crude oil purchased in 1979.
   Furmark, a friend of the late CIA director William Casey,
testified before Congress during the investigation of the
Iran-Contra scandal that he was involved in the sale of arms to
Iran.
   Atkins, who resigned as Ashland chairman in 1981 but remained a
consultant until 1988, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and wire fraud
in September. He faces up 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine at
sentencing June 7.
   Furmark faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine at
sentencing June 15.
   He told U.S. District Judge Miriam Cedarbaum at that he, Atkins
and a lawyer, Charles Barnett, conspired to sell 259 documents
Atkins had obtained from a source at Ashland in 1982.
   The conspirators reached an agreement with NIOC in 1984 that
they would receive 25 percent of any damages the company might
receive in a lawsuit against Ashland for the unpaid oil shipment,
prosecutors charged.
   ``Though I tried to deceive myself as to the propriety of my
actions, I knew in my heart it was wrong,'' Furmark said.
   The Iranian company never completed the deal to buy the
documents, prosecutors said. The legal dispute were settled in
September with Ashland agreeing to pay $325 million.
   Barnett, of Palm Beach, Fla., whose law firm once worked for
Ashland, goes on trial in April.

   A man who used fake tax returns, a fictitious
herd of cattle and a non-existent salary from a bull sperm bank to
obtain more than $1 million in loans was sentenced to 12 years in
prison.
   U.S. District Judge George S. White on Thursday also ordered
Lowell Abbe, 47, to repay $413,000 to seven Ohio lenders. Abbe had
pleaded guilty to 22 counts of fraud.
   Prosecutors said Abbe used fake tax returns, property, farm
equipment, automobiles and Black Angus cattle he didn't own in
obtaining the bank loans.
   Court documents said he also buried an expensive sports car and
a horse trailer on his family farm in an attempt to hide assets.
FBI agents dug up the car.
   ``He did things a banker would never dream a borrower would
do,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Ann Rowland. ``I've never had a
bankruptcy trial where assets were buried.''
   Abbe changed attorneys six times since his indictment four years
ago, tried to withdraw his guilty plea and fainted in court at his
sentencing Monday, forcing a postponement.
   Carolyn J. Strouse, whom Abbe married in December, was sentenced
to four years in prison Monday on 14 counts related to the fraud.

   Tomato seeds exposed to the rigors of
space travel for six years seem to be germinating normally,
scientists say.
   The first small batch of seeds recently returned from a NASA
satellite were displayed Thursday _ apparently sprouting normally
in a germination test that began Saturday, said Dr. Jim Alston of
Park Seed Co.
   ``Everything looked fine. No little green critters came flying
out,'' joked Alston, whose company provided the 12.5 million seeds
for the experiment aboard the space agency's Long Duration Exposure
Facility.
   At a news conference called to display the germinating seeds,
officials also cracked open one of eight unopened canisters of
seeds launched into space in April 1984.
   The satellite was supposed to be picked up by space shuttle
astronauts and returned to Earth 10 months after it was launched,
but scheduling difficulties and the 1986 Challenger disaster
delayed its retrieval. They were retrieved in December by the
shuttle Columbia.
   The seeds _ most of them in sealed, insulated canisters _
appeared to have survived their long space journey, said officials
working on the project with NASA.
   In addition to the 12.5 million tomato seeds _ of the Rutgers
California Supreme variety _ there were 120 types of seeds
including corn, onion, cucumber and sunflower.
   Scientists will look for mutations caused by the heavy radiation
they were exposed to in space. Plants grown from the seeds will be
examined for differences in color _ indicating a loss of
chlorophyll _ and for differences in leaves, stems, flowers and
fruit.
   The results may be significant in determining whether food can
be grown in outer space.
   Opening the canister is something less than high-tech. After
undoing its 36 screws, Alston first tried to pop the top off with a
chunk of wood and a hammer, but he ended up prying it off with a
rusty butcher knife, a pocketknife and a putty knife.
   Some of the samples will be analyzed at the seed company, but
most will be shipped to colleges and elementary and high schools
across the country for experiments.
   The results of those experiments will be sent to Oklahoma State
University, which is scheduled to publish a report this fall on the
findings.

   Wanted: Salesclerk for tobacco shop _
no smokers need apply.
   One might think a tobacco shop would be safe haven for those
puffing pariahs already persona non grata in restaurants,
elevators, trains, planes and automobiles.
   But Tobacco Emporium owner Lindsay Heine, who advertised for the
non-smoking clerk this week, believes even smoke shop customers
have the right to be exposed to smoke on their own terms.
   ``I can see how that that might be a little contradictory,'' she
said.
   Of the shop's six employees, only one smokes, and she smokes
only at home, Ms. Heine said. A smoker would disrupt the smoke-free
working environmment.
   ``I wear contacts,'' she said, ``and you know how smoking is on
those.''

<HEAD>Studies: Cholesterol Screenings by Portable Machines Often
Inaccurate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The accuracy of cholesterol screening tests
varies widely, with portable testing machines used by poorly
trained operators giving highly inaccurate results up to one-fourth
of the time, researchers said.
   Poorly set instruments and inadequate training were mainly to
blame for misleading readings, which can cause people to seek
unneeded medical treatment or falsely reassure them they don't need
it, researchers said in a study today.
   Even under the best of circumstances, ``cholesterol is a lot
like blood pressure,'' said one of the researchers, Michelle J.
Naughton, a sociologist at the University of Minnesota School of
Public Health in Minneapolis. ``It will vary by the time of day you
take it, and it will vary from day to day.''
   Excess cholesterol in the blood is one of the three main
modifiable traits linked with increased likelihood of developing
heart disease, the nation's No. 1 killer. The two others are high
blood pressure and smoking.
   In the Journal of the American Medical Association study, Ms.
Naughton's group said cholesterol screening results were within an
acceptable range of accuracy in only one of four public screenings
they analyzed.
   In the three other screenings, readings often strayed from true
values by more than 14.2 percent, the largest range of error
allowed under guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education
Program, researchers said.
   True values were established on samples from the same subjects
measured in a nationally standardized laboratory, the researchers
said.
   The highest rate of unacceptable results was 23.5 percent, among
tests done by a cholesterol-screening company at an unidentified
worksite, the researchers said.
   Other testing groups had rates of unacceptable error ranging
from 6.9 percent, at a retail store; to 3.6 percent, at a grocery
store; to zero percent, at the Minnesota State Fair, the
researchers found.
   At the unidentified worksite, where accuracy was worst, testers
had received only one day of training and no apprenticeship or
refresher courses.
   At the retail store and the grocery store, testers had undergone
two days of training and an apprenticeship, the researchers found.
   At the Minnesota State Fair, testers had undergone four days of
training, an apprenticeship and three-hour refresher courses every
three months, the researchers said.

   An attorney for a co-defendant of Manuel Noriega
said his client cannot get a fair trial in South Florida because
the drug-trafficking case against the deposed dictator is linked to
Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
   South Florida is ``dominated'' by people who fled their
homelands to escape communist dictatorships, especially Cuba and
Nicaragua, said Samuel Burstyn, the attorney for former Noriega
aide Luis del Cid.
   Calling Castro an unindicted co-conspirator in the
drug-trafficking indictment, Burstyn said the trial should be moved
to San Francisco, New York or Puerto Rico. He asked for a change of
venue Thursday in federal court.
   The February 1988 indictment alleges that Castro mediated a
dispute between Noriega and Colombia's Medellin drug cartel.
   The indictment alleges that del Cid handled a drug payoff for
Noriega.
   In his motion, Burstyn noted that during del Cid's unsuccessful
attempt to get bail, prosecutors released a photo of del Cid,
Noriega and Castro meeting in Cuba.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Exclusion of Women From Jobs Involving Lead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state appeals court has struck down a
company policy prohibiting women capable of bearing children from
working around lead.
   The court ruled that the ``fetal protection program'' by Johnson
Controls Inc., which owned a battery manufacuter in Fullerton,
assumed that all fertile women would become pregnant and was
nothing more than sex discrimination.
   ``We are in an era of choice. A woman is not required to become
a Victorian brood mare,''the court said in the ruling, released
Thursday.
   Catherine Ruckelshaus of San Francisco Legal Aid's Employment
Law Center, which represented the woman in the case, Queen Foster,
said it was the first appellate decision in the country to overturn
a fetal protection policy.
   The ruling was based on California civil rights law and lacks
direct effect outside the state but could be a model for courts
elsewhere, Ms. Ruckelshaus said.
   ``We're ecstatic,'' she said. ``Employers can no longer
discriminate on the basis of one's ability to have children.''
   Gerald Griffin, a lawyer for Johnson Controls, referred
questions to corporate officials, who did not return a call
Thursday. The company makes batteries for some of the nation's
biggest retailers under their house brands.
   Ms. Foster had been denied a battery assembly job in 1983 at a
Johnson plant under a nationwide policy the company had started
three months earlier.
   High concentrations of lead, which is used in automobile
batteries, have been found to affect adult and child health and
have been linked by some researchers to birth defects.
   In 1987, the state Fair Employment and Housing Commission
ordered Globe Battery to hire her, give her back pay and additional
amounts to be determined later, and rescind its policy. The company
appealed and won in 1988 in Superior Court.
   The appeals court ruling rejected the reasoning of the 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the company's policy in a
Minnesota case last year. The United Auto Workers has appealed the
Minnesota ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The policy apparently presumes that ``the employer is better
suited to safeguard the interests of a woman's future offspring,
should there be an unexpected pregnancy, than is the woman
herself,'' said the California court in the 3-0 decision.

   A warm front that set record highs in the upper Plains lingered
across the region today, while heavy snows were expected this
weekend in the Sierra Nevada.
   Thunderstorms extended from the Texas Gulf Coast on Thursday in
a swath that cut across Louisiana, Mississippi, northern Alabama,
Georgia, the western portions of the Carolinas, Kentucky and
central Tennessee.
   Almost an inch of rain soaked Lafayette, La., and two-thirds of
an inch fell at Houston and Palacious, Texas.
   As much as 1{ feet of snow is expected from the winter storm
returning to the Sierra Nevada.
   Winter storm watches for tonight have been posted in the higher
elevations of the range, from north of Yosemite, Calif., to the
California-Nevada border along the Lake Tahoe-Truckee area.
   Another storm is likely to sweep across the area on Sunday,
bringing with it much colder temperatures.
   The northern Plains basked in unseasonably warm weather
Thursday, with temperatures as much as 30 degrees warmer than usual.
   In South Dakota, Aberdeen registered 64 degrees, breaking by 3
degrees the record set in 1901 for March 1. Bismarck, N.D., hit 62,
breaking the record of 1905 by 1, and Fargo, N.D., tied the 1918
temperature of 58.
   Minneapolis-St. Paul set a new high of 59, topping the high of
45 registered in 1964 and again in 1985. Also in Minnesota, Cloud
had 58 degrees, bettering the 1918 mark of 55, and Duluth was 48,
topping the 1956 record by 5 degrees.
   In Michigan, Marquette was 52, bettering the 1964 mark of 45,
and Alpena tied the 1923 high of 48. And in Washington state,
Olympia bettered the 1986 mark of 61 by 1, and Tacoma tied the 1968
record of 62.
   A winter storm warning was posted beginning tonight for the
upper Kobuk and Yukon valleys of Alaska. As much as a foot of snow
was expected by Saturday.
   The high for the nation Thursday was 89 degrees at Yuma, Ariz.

   A federal appeals court reversed a $632,814 award
to a serviceman's family who challenged the military's finding
their loved one was killed in action during the Vietnam war.
   The ruling Thursday by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
went against the first American family to refuse to accept the
remains of a casualty of war.
   The court reversed the decision of a U.S. District judge in
Florida, who in 1988 ordered the government to pay $632,814 to the
family of an Air Force officer whose gunship was shot down in Laos
in 1972. The judge ruled that the Air Force recklessly caused the
family emotional distress by declaring Lt. Col. Thomas Trammell
Hart III dead.
   The appeals court found the government acted within its
authority and ruled that the lower court both lacked jurisdiction
and decided wrongly on the merits of the case.
   Hart, 32, was one of 16 crewmen aboard the gunship. Two crew
members parachuted to safety; the others, initially listed as
missing in action, eventually were determined by military experts
to have been killed.
   Hart's wife, mother and daughter challenged the techniques used
to identify the remains, and charged that the methods violated
military policy. Anne Hart also wanted her husband returned to the
``unaccounted for'' list.
   She said the decision to label him killed in action without
positive identification could doom him if he were still alive and
being held as a prisoner of war.
   The appeals court noted that searchers reconstructed the downing
of the plane and dug around the accident site to a depth of 14
feet, unearthing 50,000 bone fragments, identification tags and
personal effects.
   In reviewing the government's handling of the case, the appeals
court said, ``Clearly in cases where the total evidence indicates
the persons involved in the incident were in fact killed, and where
recovery efforts were thorough and complete, we must conculed that
the individuals have been accounted for.''
   The government, according to the court, ``made its
identification as best it could, and when that proved to be
insufficient, it complied with every request made by the Harts
except their request that Lt. Col. Hart be returned to
unaccounted-for status.''
   The appeals court said the family could pursue its case through
other channels, such as the Armed Forces Board, but added that the
courts shouldn't second-guess discretionary policies.

   East German authorities have taken another
step toward the introduction of capitalism by announcing the
nation's state-owned industries will be sold off to private
investors starting March 15.
   However, land and fixed assets will not be on sale to foreigners
in what is seen as a move to prevent a huge sellout to West Germany.
   Also Thursday, the East German Foreign Ministry proposed that
experts from both Germanys meet soon to work out a common position
on German unification for presentation to the World War II allies _
the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France.
   In Poland, demonstrators rallied Thursday in three cities to
support their government's demand that it also be included in the
talks. Poland says it needs access to the talks to win assurances a
united Germany would not claim prewar territory that is now part of
present-day Poland.
   Details are sketchy on the economic measures by the interim
government of Premier Hans Modrow, which were announced by economic
reform commissioner Wolfgang Krause.
   The program to sell off East Germany's huge industrial combines
mainly to East German nationals begins three days before
parliamentary elections scheduled March 18, the first free vote
this Communist-led nation has seen in 40 years.
   The new parliament would supervise the program and could even
make substantial changes. It could exempt some foreign investors
from the purchasing ban if that is deemed in line with the public
benefit, Krause said.
   The privatization plan is a compromise between the concerns of
West German investors, who want full integration of the two
nations' economies, and worries in East Germany of a complete
takeover by the West.
   Government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said the interim step toward
privatization would give industry managers more autonomy while
hindering ``arbitrary sale of assets and property.''
   The lack of specifics apparently reflected the Modrow
government's reluctance to go ahead with major reforms without a
parliamentary mandate.
   Modrow, however, also faces immense pressures to quickly restore
confidence in his nation's ailing economy as up to 3,000 people a
day continue to leave for West Germany.
   That haste was also reflected by East Germany's proposal to form
a joint committee of experts to work out a German line in the
reunification talks with the allies who defeated the Nazis in 1945.
   Under the plan announced last month in Ottawa, the two Germanys
will first discuss their common approach to unification and submit
that to the four World War II allies.
   According to the official news agency ADN, a Foreign Ministry
memorandum said Germany's neighbors should play some role in the
unification process where their security interests were at stake.
   This was an apparent reference to Poland.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, who faces pressure from
a conservative constituency in December elections, has continued to
hedge on Polish demands for guarantees that Germany won't reclaim
territories it lost to Poland.
   East German parliamentary secretariat chief Herbert Krause
meanwhile told the Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland on
Thursday that 35 parties have so far registered for the March 18
vote, although no candidate lists are available yet.
   Despite Modrow's great personal prestige, recent opinion polls
predict East Germany's Social Democratic Party will finish first,
followed by the conservative Alliance for Germany, a three-party
coalition including the Christian Democratic Union as well as the
Democratic Awakening group.

   Alan Kiepper wanted to start off his first day
as president of the Transit Authority on the right foot. Instead,
he started it on the wrong train.
   The new subway chief got lost on the F line and ended up in
Queens Thursday morning instead of the TA's headquarters in
Brooklyn.
   But Kiepper, 10 minutes late for a staff meeting, showed his
managerial sense of direction by launching a review of train and
station cleaning standards and asking his staff to brainstorm on
how to speed up a station restoration program.
   Still, Subway Map Reading 101 might be useful.
   Before boarding the wrong train in Manhattan, Kiepper took time
to stop and give directions to a man looking for the No. 6 train.
   ``I found out later I gave him the wrong directions,'' Kiepper
said.

   A Secret Service agent opened fire on a sky
diver who parachuted into the parking lot of President George
Bush's hotel and sped away in a car, police said.
   Bush was staying at the Century Plaza Hotel during the Thursday
morning episode that ended with the arrest of Charles Sweeney, 47,
of Santa Clarita.
   Sweeney, arrested at his home hours after the incident, was
booked for investigation of assault with a deadly weapon on a law
officer and freed on $3,000 bail, said police Lt. Al Moen.
   Police and the Secret Service wouldn't comment on what motivated
the sky diver.
   Sweeney did not immediately return a telephone call.
   The sky diver hopped from a 36-story building under construction
near the hotel about 6 a.m., sailed across the street and landed in
the hotel parking lot, Moen said.
   A police officer on security detail for the president's stay saw
Sweeney land and alerted other officers and Secret Service agents,
he said.
   ``The parachutist then scooped up his parachute and ran to a
waiting car, which he drove in circles at a high rate of speed,''
Moen said.
   The driver passed near a Secret Service officer who opened fire,
the lieutenant said.
   ``I don't know whether the car was hit or not,'' Moen said. The
driver was not wounded.
   A police cruiser tried to seal off the lot, Moen said, but ``it
soon became apparent that he was closing in on the officer at a
high rate so the officer accelerated out of the way and the suspect
was able to get away.''
   Detectives tracked Sweeney to Santa Clarita, about 30 miles from
downtown Los Angeles.

   Gov. Bill Clinton announced he will
seek a fifth term. If successful he could become the
longest-serving governor in Arkansas history.
   Clinton, 43, made the announcement Thursday before about 500
supporters at the Capitol rotunda.
   Clinton was first elected governor in 1978, lost a re-election
bid to Republican Frank White in 1980 and beat White in a 1982
rematch. He was re-elected in 1984 and won a four-year term in 1986
after the gubernatorial term was changed.
   Education has been the cornerstone of Clinton's administrations.
He has been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate.
   The longest serving Arkansas governor, Orval Faubus, held office
for 12 years, from 1955 through 1966.
   Congressman Tommy Robinson and Sheffield Nelson, a lawyer and
businessman, are seeking the GOP nomination.

   The man whose recanted testimony led to
the release of ``The Thin Blue Line'' defendant Randall Dale Adams
has been sentenced to die by injection for an unrelated slaying.
   District Judge Larry Gist on Thursday set an April 3 execution
date for David Ray Harris of Vidor, who first implicated then
cleared Adams in the slaying of a Dallas police officer.
   Harris killed Mark Mays, 30, of Beaumont during a 1985 shootout
after Harris allegedly attempted to kidnap a woman from the man's
apartment.
   Harris testified he shot Mays in self-defense.
   The Adams case became the subject of Errol Morris' 1988
documentary ``The Thin Blue Line,'' which suggested Adams had been
wrongly convicted. Adams spent 12 years in prison for the 1976
shooting death of Robert Wood before being freed last March.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against most major foreign
currencies today in quiet European trading.
   Gold prices were lower.
   Dealers said the dollar is strong, largely ignoring any bad
economic news and taking favorable reports as an excuse to advance
further.
   The currency was boosted by continued weakness in the yen and
the West German mark, traders said.
   A senior dealer at the Bank of Montreal said the dollar could
weaken on expectations that the West German central bank, the
Bundesbank, will intervene to keep the mark from falling too low.
   ``We have to be careful about the Bundesbank. It has made a
policy decision that it wants a strong Deutsche mark,'' the Bank of
Montreal's Mark Sexton said.
   Other dealers disagreed and predicted the Bundesbank would not
intervene until after the East German elections March 18.
   ``Intervention wouldn't make any sense at this point,'' said
Manfred Totzauer, a vice president at Citibank AG in Frankfurt.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.03 yen to a closing 149.75 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 149.90 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:
   _1.7172 West German marks, up from 1.7145
   _1.5067 Swiss francs, up from 1.5060
   _5.8017 French francs, up from 5.7935
   _1.9342 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9307
   _1,266.50 Italian lire, up from 1,266
   _1.1915 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1899
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6629, compared with $1.6655 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $406.50 a troy ounce,
down from $407.75 bid late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of 406.40 dollars.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $406.25, down from $407.75 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.02 to close at a bid $406.61.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.14 a troy ounce, from
Thursday's $5.16.

<HEAD>Western Ideas Banned From Chinese Journalism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese reporters will never again be allowed to
disseminate Western ideas and those who try to change the socialist
system will be punished, Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin said in
a speech published today.
   Editorials, commentaries and speeches on the correct role of
journalism in China have appeared regularly since the leadership
cracked down on last year's massive pro-democracy movement.
   The full text of Jiang's speech, made Nov. 28 at a seminar
organized by the party's propaganda department, took up nearly a
full page in the official party newspaper, the People's Daily. The
speech was the lead item in all major newspapers.
   There was no explanation for the delayed release of Jiang's
speech, but it is not unusual for leaders' talks to be published
months or even years after they were given.
   In the speech, Jiang reminded reporters they should serve as the
``mouthpieces'' of the party to ``give publicity ... to the party's
basic line.''
   From April to June, all major newspapers ran detailed, lively
and accurate reports of the student-led movement for political
reforms, displaying an autonomy rarely seen in Chinese journalism.
The military later crushed the pro-democracy movement.
   Jiang accused those newspapers of being controlled by advocates
of bourgeois liberalism, or Western ideas, saying they ``became
tools for arousing sentiments against the party and the socialist
system.''
   He singled out for criticism Shanghai's World Economic Herald,
China's most liberal newspaper. The paper has not been allowed to
publish since May, and sources say it is being disbanded. Before
the protests last spring, the paper often printed thoughtful essays
on the need for political and economic reforms.
   Jiang warned ``from now on, newspapers, magazines, radio and
television stations will never be allowed to disseminate bourgeois
liberalization.''
   Instead, the mass media ``must fight firmly and persistently
against bourgeois liberalization.''
   Journalistic activity ``aimed at altering the socialist system''
would be punished, Jiang said without elaboration.
   Jiang claimed there is ``no absolute and unlimited press freedom
in any country,'' and argued the work environment for reporters in
other countries was not much better than China.
   He added that Western countries have always punished
journalistic activity aimed at changing the capitalist system, but
did not give any examples.
   Jiang also called for greater party control over reporters.
   ``Leadership of the press should be firmly held by Marxists,''
he said.

<HEAD>Toothpaste Brand Switches Name To Appease Critics</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ``Darkie,'' a popular brand of toothpaste in
Hong Kong, has been changed to ``Darlie'' in response to
accusations the old name was racist, a company spokeswoman said
today.
   However, the new brand, which first appeared on local counters
Thursday, still has Chinese print that reads ``Black Man
Toothpaste.''
   Hawley and Hazel Chemical Co. Ltd. renamed the brand ``Darlie''
after the U.S.-based Colgate-Palmolive Co., which bought a 50
percent share in the company in 1985, faced pressure at home to
make the change.
   In addition to keeping the old Chinese name, the company also
continued using the brand logo of a grinning black minstrel with
sparkling white teeth.
   Mary Kwan, spokeswoman for Hawley and Hazel, said the entire
label will eventually be replaced in a further bid to improve the
product's image.
   To many Chinese, ``the name does not carry any racist
connotations,'' she said. ``We believe local customers prefer the
original name as concluded from our previous intensive market
research.''
   A representative of the African National Congress visiting Hong
Kong to discuss trade matters still expressed outrage over the
product.
   ``If this company found itself in South Africa it would not be
used,'' Eric Molobi was quoted by the English-language South China
Morning Post as saying. ``There would be a permanent boycott.''
   Miss Kwan predicted that the change of names would have minimal
effect on sales. The brand now has a market share of more than 30
percent.
   The toothpaste is distributed only in Asia and already has been
renamed in Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore, she said.
   In 1987, the Taiwan government warned the public not to carry
``Darkie'' toothpaste abroad to avoid trouble or misunderstanding.

   Rosalie Searles may be the luckiest woman
ever to have been run over by two cars in one day.
   Searles escaped without broken bones or other serious injuries
early Thursday when she was accidentally run over, first by her
husband, then by a fireman responding to the accident, state police
said.
   Both drivers were charged with driving while intoxicated.
   Searles' misfortune began around 2:30 a.m. Thursday when she and
her husband, Gary Searles, 37, were arguing in their car in this
central New York town, according to a state police arrest report.
   Mrs. Searles, 30, had her passenger-side door open and somehow
fell out onto the road, police said. Searles accidentally hit the
gas pedal and ran over his wife's right leg.
   Mrs. Searles lay in the road waiting for an ambulance with
police when the fireman, Eric J. Barnes, 22, drove around the
police cars and ran over both of her feet.
   She was taken to a hospital in nearby Sidney, treated for
bruises and scrapes and released, police said.

<HEAD>Smokers Lose Ability To Smell With Every Passing Puff</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A smoker's sense of smell recedes with every
passing puff, according to researchers at the University of
Pennsylvania who conducted scratch and sniff tests.
   ``The majority still have a sense of smell, but not as acute as
if they weren't smoking,'' said Richard Doty, director of the
university's Smell and Taste Center.
   Both current and former smokers lose their ability to smell all
kinds of odors in proportion to the amount of cigarettes and length
of time they had smoked, the researchers reported today in the
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   The researchers used the scratch and sniff tests to evaluate the
ability of 638 volunteers to smell 40 different odors. Of the
subjects, 262 had never smoked, 197 were ex-smokers and 179 were
current smokers. In addition, 14 people said they also smoked
cigars or pipes.
   ``A person who smoked two packs of cigarettes a day for 10 years
has less of an ability to smell, on average, than someone who had
smoked two packs of cigarettes for five years,'' said the report's
lead author, former research associate Richard Frye. Frye is now a
graduate student at Drexel University.
   Current smokers are nearly twice as likely to show a loss of
smell than those who never smoked, according to the researchers.
   A medical psychologist studying the effects of smoking and
nicotine called the study's results ``very intriguing.''
   ``It could help explain why a lot of the old studies connected a
loss in the sense of taste to smoking,'' said Neil Grunberg of the
Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, in Bethesda,
Md. Grunberg pointed out that the sense of taste is linked to the
sense of smell, and the study could shed light on what component of
cigarettes affects both senses.
   The loss appears to be reversible, Doty said, but two-pack-a-day
smokers would have to quit for as many years as they smoked to
regain the essential sense, he said.
   ``Smell is our primary sense for detecting such environmental
dangers as leaking natural gas, spoiled food and smoke,'' Doty
said. ``In addition, it may be of diagnostic value for the early
detection of a number of neurological disorders, including
Alzheimers' disease and Parkinsonism,'' in which the diseases'
victims lose some of their sense of smell.
   Doty said that the cause of the smell loss was not known, but he
believed that a chemical in the tobacco smoke may kill nasal cells.
   ``The loss of the sense of smell is yet another good reason to
quit smoking,'' Doty said. ``Smoking creates the possibility of
losing, at least in part, the ability to appreciate flowers, good
food and good wine. So, if one likes those things, one should think
twice about smoking.''

   Miners in the Ukrainian coal capital of Donetsk
walked off the job today to press demands that the local Communist
Party leadership resign, a city official said.
   About 1,500 miners waving banners calling for the resignations
gathered in front of party headquarters, and 24 miners announced a
hunger strike until the party leaders quit, said Nikolai
Ponomarenko, a regional strike committee member.
   The walkout followed a six-hour ``warning strike'' Thursday.
   Strike leaders in the city 500 miles south of Moscow said they
believe the party leadership will interfere in the campaigning in
the Ukraine for Sunday's multiparty elections, which also will take
place in Russia and Byelorussia.
   They also said there is dissatisfaction that promises made after
coal strikes in the region last summer are not being implemented
quickly enough. Miners had demanded better living and working
conditions as well as local autonomy.
   Yuri Smirnov, the chairman of the Donetsk city council, said on
local radio that the walkout shut down two shafts and partially
idled a third, an action he described as a ``political strike.''
   The warning strike affected the Thursday afternoon shift at a
number of mines in Donetsk, according to the TV news show
``Vremya.'' But the official news agency Tass said many miners at a
strike committee meeting were reluctant to go along, saying the
walkout would aggravate the grave economic situation.
   Ponomarenko said that at the rally outside party headquarters,
city officials refused to allow the use of loudspeakers because the
gathering was not approved and speeches could spark disorder.
   ``This is a provocation,'' Ponomarenko said in a telephone
interview. ``There have never been any disorders during strikes,
because miners themselves keep the discipline,'' he said.
   Radio Moscow said the local party committee put off
consideration of the miners' demand that they resign at least until
a regional party conference, scheduled April 6-7.
   ``The party committee spoke in favor of holding a conference
next month which would be authorized the give a vote of confidence
or elect new party leaders,'' the radio said.
   On Feb. 7, a mass rally held in Donetsk forced the resignation
of the local party chief, A. Vinnik. The miners held another rally
a week later to demand that the entire party leadership of Dontesk
resign.

   Twenty-one officials of toppled
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's hated security police faced a military
court today on charges related to the deaths of as many as 1,000
people in December's uprising.
   The defendants are accused of either complicity in genocide or
facilitating genocide _ charges arising from the shooting of
unarmed demonstrators in mid-December opposed to Stalinist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   National outrage over the shooting helped spark the bloody
revolution that subsequently swept Ceausescu and his followers from
power and resulted in the execution of the dictator and his wife,
Elena, on Dec. 25.
   The proceedings are the first in Timisoara, about 180 miles west
of Bucharest, and the first against those suspected of trying to
throttle the uprising before it spread.
   It follows similar trials in January in Sibiu of several police
officers accused of firing on demonstrators in that city, about 120
miles northwest of the Romanian capital.
   Fighting was particularly fierce in Sibiu, stronghold of
Ceausescu's son Nicu, who is awaiting trial on various charges.
Sentences of up to 19 years were meted out there.
   In Bucharest, four Politburo members were convicted in January
of complicity in genocide and sentenced to life in prison after
they testified that they went along with the dictator's orders to
fire on demonstrators.
   Initially, as many as 4,000 people were reported killed by
Ceausescu loyalists in Timisoara, but no authoritative final count
has been published. The actual figure is more likely in the
hundreds, and expectations are that a final toll will be disclosed
at the trial.

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu left for California
today for talks with President Bush after telling Parliament he
will strive to overcome Japan's chronic trade problems with the
United States.
   In his first speech to Parliament since his re-election as prime
minister, Kaifu said Japanese efforts to create a new international
``age of hope'' will be based on ``firm relations of cooperation''
between Tokyo and Washington.
   ``The solution of the trade and economic issues between Japan
and the United States is one of the main policy issues facing Japan
today,'' Kaifu said. He said talks between the two nations on
causes of their trade imbalance were ``an urgent and important
issue.''
   The talks ``are intended to improve the Japanese standard of
living and to strengthen America's competitiveness,'' he said. ``I
intend to make every possible effort for progress in these talks.''
   Hours after delivering the speech, Kaifu left Tokyo on a special
flight for Los Angeles.
   Although Kaifu and Bush have agreed not to set a specific agenda
for their talks later today and Saturday in Palm Springs, the trade
issue is expected to be a major topic.
   The United States is pressing Japan to restructure fundamentals
of its economy, including its convoluted distribution system, high
savings and investment rate, and land use policies, which
Washington claims are protectionist.
   Two days of talks last week ended with negotiators doing little
more than agreeing to disagree, and on Thursday Democrats in the
U.S. Congress urged Bush to take a hard line against Japanese trade
barriers.
   The $49 billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan last year was
little changed from $51.8 billion in 1988.
   Kaifu indicated a willingness to compromise. ``I intend to work
for streamlined distribution, strict enforcement of the
anti-monopoly law, import promotion ... and other improvements,''
he said.
   Kaifu said Wednesday that he also hoped to discuss with Bush
issues such as the environment, the drug and international debt
problems, and technology transfer to the Third World. He was to
leave Japan by special jet this evening.
   In elections Feb. 18 for the powerful House of Representatives,
or lower house, Kaifu led the governing Liberal Democratic Party to
a majority.
   Governing party politicians said the victory, following the
Liberal Democrats' disastrous showing in upper house elections last
year in the wake of a series of bribery scandals, was a public
vindication of the party.
   Kaifu, who was vaulted from obscurity to the premiership six
months ago to lead the party out of its scandals, pledged to
continue reforming politics.

   A legislator contends that R.J. Reynolds is
using a T-shirt promotion to hook youngsters on cigarettes, a
charge the tobacco company denies.
   ``I'm 41 and I wear T-shirts,'' R.J. Reynolds spokesman Dave
Fishel said in a telephone interview from Winston-Salem, N.C.
   Rep. Jim Slattery, D-Kan., attacked the company's T-shirt
promotion Thursday at an Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
transportation and hazardous materials hearing on a bill to
restrict tobacco advertising.
   ``I contend that when you give away T-shirts you are targeting
children, not targeting adults,'' Slattery said, adding that to
deny that youngsters are being targeted ``is an insult to people's
intelligence.''
   Slattery was referring to an R.J. Reynolds campaign that offers
free T-shirts with a cartoon version of the longtime Camel
cigarette mascot, ``Old Joe.''
   Opponents of the bill to restrict advertising argue that the
campaign against so-called ``targeted advertising'' is an elitist
and patronizing affront to the judgment of those being targeted,
including blacks, Hispanics and women.
   Recent marketing documents surrounding a new R.J. Reynolds brand
talked about targeting the ``Dakota'' cigarette to so-called
``virile females,'' young white women who watch television sitcoms
and go to tractor pulls.
   Rep. Alex McMillan, R-N.C., criticized anti-smoking advocates
who say target groups ``are victims and that these people do not
have the intelligence or wisdom to make their own decision whether
or not to smoke.''
   ``You don't hear cries of outrage over housewives being targeted
by detergent makers or yuppies being exploited by exposure to
American Express commercials,'' said Tino Duran, president of the
National Association of Hispanic Publications.
   ``Why is that? Because, unlike Hispanics, nobody would dare
suggest that those people need to be `protected' from advertising.''
   Duran said many Hispanic publications would collapse if the
government bans tobacco and alcohol advertising.
   Anti-smoking advocates say the tobacco industry is preying on
Hispanics, blacks, women and youngsters to make up for the lost
market from people who quit smoking.
   Under the Reynolds promotions, people may call a toll-free
number for the ``Old Joe'' T-shirt. Those who call later receive a
brochure in the mail offering them free cigarettes.
   Fishel denied that minors were taking advantage of the promotion
and said that parents must bear some responsibility in keeping
their children from doing so.
   Slattery displayed a brochure that was sent to a 14-year-old boy
who had ordered the T-shirt.
   The boy's mother, contacted by The Associated Press, said she
found the offer when she sorted the mail. The brochure offered free
packs of cigarettes, but required signature on a card stating that
the person placing the order smokes and is over 21.
   ``My son knows of at least four kids who received the coupons
other than him,'' said the woman, who spoke on the condition she
not be identified by name.
   She said she was particularly upset because her father recently
died from emphysema, blamed on years of smoking.
   Fishel said company records indicated that the boy had given his
age as 24 and said he smoked Marlboro Lights.
   ``We don't want kids on our mailing list,'' Fishel said.
``Anytime anybody has complained about something like this, the
name automatically comes off the mailing list.''
   The legislation sponsored by Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, would
limit tobacco print advertising to text, ban advertising directed
at minors and restrict tobacco advertising on billboards.

<HEAD>Man Under Investigation in Judge Bombing Files Contempt Motion
Against Media</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man under investigation for two mail bomb
deaths in December is asking the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
to find news organizations in contempt of a court-imposed gag order.
   Details of the request were unclear because the attorneys
representing the man, Walter Leroy Moody Jr., of Clayton County,
refused to give lawyers for the news organizations copies of the
contempt motion.
   Moody's attorneys, who obtained the gag order last month, also
refuse to comment on any aspect of the case.
   Terry Adamson, attorney for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and
WSB-TV, said he received a letter Thursday notifying him that a
contempt motion had been filed, but it did not give any details.
   ``Any suggestion that we or our clients have violated any court
order is sadly ludicrous and patently frivolous,'' said Adamson,
who has appealed the order sealing records and barring official
comment on the Moody case.
   Meanwhile, the White House confirmed that Moody has written to
President Bush about the investigation.
   Cheryl Kienel of the White House media relations office said a
letter from Moody was received Feb. 23.
   ``We had received guidance from the FBI if we received any
correspondence from Mr. Moody we should forward it to them, which
we did,'' Ms. Kienel said.
   Bruce Harvey, one of Moody's attorneys, declined to discuss the
letter beyond saying, ``It involves the investigation.''
   Moody is one of three men in Georgia and Alabama whose
properties have been searched in the bomb investigation.
   Federal agents have been working since mid-December to solve a
series of bombings, two of which claimed the lives of 11th Circuit
Judge Robert Vance and Savannah lawyer Robert Robinson.
   The judges of the 11th Circuit have removed themselves from
hearing matters related to the Moody case and the bombing
investigation.

   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge was flat in January, the Commerce Department said today in a
further indication that the economy's current sluggishness will
extend into midyear.
   The lack of change in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators,
designed to forecast economic activity six to nine months in
advance, followed a revised 0.6 percent gain in December and a 0.1
percent advance in November. The index fell 0.4 percent in October.
   Many economists had expected a slight increase in the January
index.
   Three of the 11 forward-looking statistics contributed to the
gain, led by a sharp increase in building permits during the
warmest January on record.
   Others showing strength were slower business delivery times and
an increase in the backlog of manufacturers' unfilled orders.
   The biggest drag on the index in January was a decline in orders
for consumer goods.
   Other negatives were a drop in the money supply, a decline in
plant and equipment orders, lower stock prices, a decrease in the
price of raw materials, a drop in an index measuring consumer
confidence and an increase in weekly unemployment claims.
   One indicator, the length of the average work week, was
unchanged.
   The various changes left the index at 145.3 percent of its 1982
base of 100. The index rose 0.8 percent from August through January
after falling 0.7 percent the previous six months.
   The December index orginally was reported to have risen 0.8
percent, but was revised downward to 0.6 percent, largely because
of lower orders for consumer goods.
   Despite the sluggishness, recent surveys indicate that business
executives and economists generally believe the Federal Reserve is
driving the economy down the right road, steering it away from a
recession while braking the growth of inflation.
   Seventy-two percent of the professional forecasters responding
to a poll by the National Association of Business Economists said
the central bank was on the right track.
   And 56 percent of the business leaders participating in a survey
by the National Association of Manufacturers said Fed policies are
``just about right.''
   But most of the business leaders and economists surveyed project
continued sluggish growth in 1990 as the Fed keeps interest rates
relatively high to slow the economy and keep prices under control.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress this week that the
economy would avoid a recession, although it would grow only at a
modest annual rate of 1.75 percent to 2 percent this year.
   But he added: ``Whenever you have economic growth as low as
this, you are vulnerable.''
   Greenspan was referring to the latest report on the gross
national product, released Wednesday, that showed the economy
slowing in the fourth quarter of 1989 to a 0.9 percent growth rate,
down from 3 percent in the third quarter.
   In the opposite lane is a minority of economists who believe the
economy is about to cross into negative growth _ if it isn't
already there.
   Paul Getman, an economist with Regional Financial Association in
West Chester, Pa., said the economic slowdown has not passed and
``we may be just in the middle of it. ... The question is whether
the weakness in manufacturing will spread to other sectors of the
economy.''
   Nevertheless, the two surveys completed last month showed
guarded optimism.
   The business economists poll found that 60.6 percent of the
forecasters thought the economy, while in a ``danger zone,'' would
avoid a recession during the next three years.
   The manufacturers' survey found that 82 percent of the
executives questioned saw sluggish growth but no recession in 1990.

   Police today fired tear gas and
turned fire engine hoses on hundreds of young student protesters
who demanded that President Felix Houphouet-Boigny resign.
   Businesses closed and government employees stopped work. Streams
of workers left government ministries, although some said they were
merely leaving to collect their children from schools closed by
demonstrators.
   Protesters are angered by harsh austerity measures proposed to
rescue this once-prosperous West African nation from the worst
economic crisis in its 30 years of independence.
   Armed soldiers and paramilitary police patrolled the city and
suburbs. In some areas of the city center, business continued as
usual, and sidewalks were filled with vendors.
   In downtown Abidjan, police hurled and fired tear gas grenades
at more than 100 protesters who shouted: ``Houphouet, we are fed up
_ resign!''
   They chased fleeing protesters and beat them with batons.
   Reporters watched half a dozen paramilitary forces fire tear gas
at hundreds of uniformed high school pupils protesting outside the
offices of Fraternite Matin, the state-controlled newspaper that
has not reported on the protests that began Feb. 19.
   The pupils fled in the direction of Adjame, the capital's
most-populous district.
   Troops and police sealed off the district of middle-class and
working-class neighborhoods that houses the capital's biggest
outdoor market, and turned away all traffic.
   At the campus of the National University of Ivory Coast, in the
luxury Cocody suburb, a dozen paramilitary forces periodically
fired tear gas at about 500 unarmed students.
   Each time the students regrouped, the helmeted troops opened
fire, preventing them from marching into downtown Abidjan.
   Trucks of armed troops and police guarded the presidential
palace and the state television station, both near the Cocody
campus.
   More paramilitary forces were posted around the Roman Catholic
Cathedral of St. Paul's, which 200 students occupied for 10 hours
Feb. 23-24 in the most dramatic of the protests.
   They were beaten and detained for two days when they peacefully
ended their protest. Police also beat and briefly detained a priest
who accompanied the students to guarantee their safety. Their
action angered Catholic Church officials who negotiated the
detainees' release.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group,
today denounced the police action and said students were beaten for
merely pressing political demands.
   Militant students said they were not satisfied by a government
response to their lesser demands this week. The government halved
costs of university board and lodging and named a new education
minister.
   But Houphouet-Boigny has rejected demands for a multiparty
democracy, which he argues would endanger national unity in a
country still wrought by tribal rivalries.
   The president also is fighting unexpected opposition from trade
union leaders angered by plans to cut government employees'
salaries, frozen for eight years, by between 15 percent and 40
percent as well as impose a 10 percent solidarity tax on all wage
earners.
   Houphouet-Boigny has postponed a meeting to discuss the
proposals from today until Monday.
   The Ivory Coast economy is suffering the cumulative effects of a
10-year recession caused by slumping cocoa and coffee prices, its
main exports. Salary cuts, unemployment and inflation have brougth
mounting discontent among the nation's 11 million people.

   A Cuban Foreign Ministry adviser says Fidel
Castro's Communist government is considering political and economic
reforms but will not veer away from one-party rule.
   Rolando Rodriguez Garcia also said Thursday that the electoral
defeat four days earlier of the leftist Sandinistas in Nicaragua _
a longtime ally _ does not mean the end of the revolution there.
   ``It is not a bankruptcy,'' the official told a news conference
at the Cuban Embassy. ``It is only a bitter blow, a transitory
setback.''
   Rodriguez said Cuba is ``in solidarity with all the revolutions
of the world. Cuba is not alone. We continue to have many friends
at our side.''
   He said the Caribbean island nation, led by Castro since a
revolution in 1959, began to undergo changes before Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's call for perestroika ignited
changes in other socialist countries.
   ``We undertook transformation before perestroika,'' he said.
   He said restructuring began in the 1960s after Cuba found social
systems it copied did not work.
   At the Cuban Communist Party's third congress in 1985, the
country's system underwent ``an exhaustive analysis,'' and a fourth
congress planned for next year will continue to review Cuba's
socialist trajectory, he said.
   ``We are not perfect. We have various problems. We are the first
to say we have defects,'' he said.
   Recent installation of young leaders in high government posts is
``a guarantee that they will continue transforming,'' he said
without elaboration.
   Still, he maintained that Cuba is not contemplating doing away
with its one-party system.
   ``We are are going to maintain our unity through one single
party,'' Rodriguez said.

<HEAD>Minority Region Leader Reports `Hot Spots' in China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party secretary in a sensitive
minority region said there are many ``hot spots'' of unrest in the
area that could blow up if not resolved quickly, according to a
report seen in Beijing today.
   Song Hanliang, the top party official in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region in China's far northwest, made his remarks after
touring portions of Xinjiang near the border with Soviet Kazakhstan
and Kirgizia.
   ``Every place and every work unit now has some problems with hot
spots,'' Saturday's Xinjiang Daily quoted Song as saying in his
report Feb. 23. The newspaper arrives in Beijing one week late.
   ``Although they are only `contradictions among the people,' if
they are not paid attention to and resolved ... They can become the
fuse of an outburst,'' he said. In Marxist ideology, a
contradiction among the people is less serious than one between the
people and an enemy class, such as landlords or the bourgeoisie.
``We must ... Handle the problem while it is still in the embryonic
stage,'' he said.
   The newspaper did not explain what ``hot spots'' or problems
Song was referring to. His statement was the clearest indication
yet that longstanding ethnic tensions in Xinjiang have resurfaced
recently in unrest.
   Xinjiang is home to several Central Asian ethnic minorities,
including the Uygurs and Kirgiz, many of whom are devout Moslems.
They are closely related to groups living across the border in the
Soviet Union, which has seen several bloody outbursts of ethnic
rivalry in recent months. Soviet Kazakhstan and Kirgizia, just west
of Xinjiang, have been quiet.
   Chinese authorities have refused to comment on the possible
impact of the Soviet unrest on China's minorities but have markedly
stepped up public calls for ethnic unity. Xinjiang officials also
have held special meetings to discuss the problem, and ordered
police to improve their anti-riot training and intelligence work
among minority groups.
   Earlier this week, police in Xinjiang expelled a French
television reporter and her French translator for allegedly
conducting interviews without permission, reflecting the
sensitivity of officials in the region to visits by outsiders.
   ``In regard to the possible appearance of disturbances this
year, it is better to over-estimate a little and absolutely not
relax vigilance or be off our guard,'' Song said in his Feb. 23
remarks to top party and government officials in Xinjiang.
   He also called for tighter supervision of religion, to ``stop up
loopholes, remove hidden perils and not allow religious activities
or religious places to be used ... For separatist activities.''
   Religion is a key element of the traditional cultures of many
minority groups, including the Uygurs, and nationalist protests in
the past often have taken on a religious tinge.
   During the last confirmed unrest in Xinjiang in May, young
Moslems stormed government offices to protest a book they said
slandered Islam. An alleged leader of the protest was sentenced to
life in prison, and nine other participants to lesser terms.

   About 1,000 Moslems wearing death shrouds
tried to march to Srinagar today, one day after troops opened fire
on pro-independence rallies in Kashmir and killed at least 49
Moslems, police said.
   A senior police official said that police deployed to enforce a
curfew blocked the march in Sumbal, 15 miles north of Srinagar.
``They were forced to return back,'' said the officer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Witnesses contacted by telephone said the demonstrators wore the
shrouds to symbolize their willingness to sacrifice their lives for
the movement demanding independence for Kashmir, a Moslem-dominated
region of India.
   The shrouds are the large swatches of material in which the
corpses of Moslems traditionally are draped before burial. Only the
protesters' heads were visible through holes cut in the fabric that
flowed down to their ankles.
   The police officer said at least 49 people were killed and
between 45 and 100 were injured Thursday when Indian forces fired
on two separate processions marching toward Srinagar, demanding
secession from predominantly Hindu India.
   In both cases, some marchers tried to seize guns from soldiers
and paramilitary police and the troops opened fire, according to
witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity. An estimated 1
million people participated in Thursday's demonstrations in
Srinagar.
   A curfew confining people to their homes was imposed at 4 a.m.
today in Srinagar and other towns in the northern Kashmir Valley.
   The government in neighboring Pakistan, which is mainly Moslem
and has fought two wars with India over Kashmir, today condemned
the killings as ``wanton shooting by Indian security forces.''
   Pakistan's official news agency said the shootings were a
``brutal Indian response ... to the people of Kashmir, who were
asking only for their right of self-determination, a right assured
them by the Untied Nations.''
   By this morning, the streets of Srinagar, a city of nearly 1
million people, were deserted except for heavily armed army and
paramilitary police, other witnesses said, also speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The loudspeakers on mosques, which often blare Islamic and
pro-independence slogans, were quiet at midmorning today, the
Moslem weekly holy day, which is often a flashpoint for trouble.
   Thursday's shootings brought to at least 162 the number of
people killed in Kashmir's latest bout of secessionist violence
that began Jan. 20 following a government crackdown on the
militants. One person died when he fell to his death in a cold lake
while troops chased protesters, the officer said.
   Also Thursday, Pushker Nath Handoo, an assistant director of the
Jammu-Kashmir state information department, was assassinated in
Srinagar. Handoo, a Hindu, in 1986 was the private secretary to
Jammu-Kashmir Gov. Jagmohan during Jagmohan's first term as
governor of the northwestern state.
   Jagmohan, who uses only one name, was reappointed governor in
January.
   Big pro-independence processions have been staged around
Srinagar for the past week, with crowd estimates ranging from
20,000 to 400,000. But those processions were generally orderly,
and witnesses said the leaders seemed to be trying to keep their
followers from provoking government troops.
   The Kashmir issue has been simmering for more than four decades,
following Britain's 1947 partition of its former colony into India
and Pakistan.
   The division left the former princely state of Kashmir in
dispute. Srinagar and the surrounding Kashmir Valley became part of
the Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir. The western slice of Kashmir
came under Pakistan's control.
   The two nations have gone to war three times since partition,
twice over Kashmir. Pakistan has denied Indian charges that it is
inciting the unrest.
   The Kashmir portion of Jammu-Kashmir state is mostly Moslem,
while the southern Jammu segment is heavily Hindu. About 65 percent
of the state's 6 million people are Moslems, who nationwide make up
only 12 percent of India's population. Hindus account for 82
percent of the 880 milion Indian citizens.

<HEAD>SEC Chairman Says Drexel Situation Does Not Indicate Unsound
Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The slide of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. into
bankruptcy court is not an indication that U.S. securities markets
are unsound, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission
said today.
   ``Drexel was uniquely concentrated among large securities firms
in high-yield securities and that concentration proved to be fatal
when these securities became unmarketable and unpledgeable,''
Chairman Richard C. Breeden told a Senate hearing.
   Drexel's insolvency ``should not be taken as an indication that
U.S. securities markets, or other major participants in those
markets are financially unsound,'' he testified before the Senate
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.
   Breedon noted that Drexel's $28 billion business has been
reduced by about 75 percent since its parent company, Drexel
Burnham Lambert Group, filed for bankruptcy protection, ``and the
public was not called upon to pay the creditors of Drexel's
unregulated operations.''
   He called for passage of a market-reform act which would give
federal regulators information on the holding companies of
securities firms such as Drexel which are not now subject to
government oversight. Such legislation, he said, would go a long
way toward preventing situations similar to Drexel's.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle, Jr., chairman of the Senate committee,
has said he wants to know what lessons can be learned from Drexel's
situation and whether it calls for regulation of the funds flowing
between a broker-dealer and its parent company.
   On Thursday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told
another congressional committee that Wall Street's ho-hum reaction
to Drexel's collapse showed regulators were right to let the
securities firm fail.
   ``Our concern was not with the fortunes of a particular firm''
but with ``the orderly operation of the financial markets,''
Greenspan said.
   Drexel, once the fifth-largest securities company in the nation,
sought bankruptcy protection in the wake of a sharp drop in the
value of its high-yield, high-risk junk bond portfolio and its
admission of securities law violations in a plea bargain with
federal prosecutors.
   Its parent company sought court protection from creditors under
the federal bankruptcy law on Feb. 13 after defaulting on $100
million in short-term debt. It has listed more than 2,000 creditors
and nearly $3 billion in liabilities.
   Despite Drexel's once towering position on Wall Street, the
stock market took its troubles in stride. The Dow Jones average of
30 industrial stocks fell 29.06 points to 2624.10 on Feb. 12, the
day Drexel announced its distress. It rose 4.96 points the
following day, when Drexel's parent filed for bankruptcy.
   ``This market reaction tends to validate the judgment that the
failure of Drexel, while a tragedy for the many involved, did not
present undue risks to the orderly functioning of the financial
system or the economy,'' said Greenspan in testimony before the
House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on economic and commercial
law.

<TEXT>
   In a change of policy, the government says
monthly Soviet immigration figures must now be submitted to
Israel's military censor prior to publication in the media.
   The release of such figures in the past has led to mounting Arab
protests over the influx of Soviet Jews to Israel.
   The Associated Press was not allowed to report the new
restriction when it was imposed Thursday, but that order was lifted
today after the daily Maariv carried a story on the new censorship
procedure on its front page.
   An announcement from the censor's office said today that ``all
material pertaining to immigration of Soviet Jews must be submitted
to the censor prior to publication.'' The censors are not expected
to release the data, so the screening process is expected to amount
to a ban. Previously, the media reported the figures without
checking with the censor first.
   Robert Slater, the head of the Foreign Press Association in
Israel, said the new procedure was pointless because the
immigration story has already been reported in great detail. ``We
are extremely disappointed at the use of military censorship for
political purposes,'' Slater said.
   Maariv said the move was recommended by senior government
officials and approved by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. A Shamir
aide, however, said it had ``nothing to do with the prime
minister.''
   The newspaper said the government acted after a government
official estimated this week that up to 230,000 Soviet Jews are
expected to immigrate this year, as opposed to previous estimates
of 80,000 to 100,000.
   The new estimate was made by Yasha Kazakov, deputy head of the
Liaison Bureau, a once-secret government unit that deals with
Soviet immigration, Israeli media reports said.
   Maariv said the figure ``created panic in the Arab countries,
and the protests coming from these countries endanger immigration.''
   Shamir's top aide Yossi Ben-Aharon agreed, saying: ``There is so
much talk of numbers and forecasts that it caused damage. Why say
230,000 or whatever?''
   Ben-Aharon, interviewed Thursday night, said he was not aware of
any order to the censor but added: ``I know there is a campaign by
all the Arab world against the immigration, so what's the wonder.''
   The latest immigration surge began last year, when 12,000 Soviet
Jews came to Israel. In January 1990, 4,700 Soviet Jews immigrated.
Israeli leaders have said they expect up to 750,000 this decade.
   The Hebrew-language daily Davar reported today that 5,500 Soviet
Jews arrived in Israel during February.
   Concern in the Arab world arose after Shamir suggested that
Israel needed to retain the occupied lands to settle the immigrants.
   Israel has denied that it would direct the flow of immigrants to
the occupied lands, where some 200 Soviet Jews settled in 1989, but
Arab leaders view even mass immigration to Israel proper as a grave
threat.
   Western nations and the United States have strongly opposed any
plan to settle the Soviet immigrants in the occupied lands.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said on Thursday that
Israel's request for U.S. aid for Soviet immigrants should be
linked to a pledge to suspend all Jewish settlements in the
occupied territories.
   Bassam Abu-Sharif, a top adviser to PLO chief Yasser Arafat,
told reporters Feb. 21 in Tunis that the movement of immigrants to
disputed lands was ``an act of war against the Palestinian people
and the Arab nation.''
   ``Such an act can only cause similar action on our part, that is
to say acts of war,'' Abu-Sharif said.
   On Feb. 23, Israeli newspapers warned of a possibility that Arab
guerrillas could target immigrants for a retaliatory attack.
   The Jerusalem Post daily quoted a ``reliable'' source as saying
Israel had stepped up security for immigrants because of these
fears.

   The sister of hostage Terry Anderson says a
2{-week trip on behalf of her brother has left her cautiously
optimistic _ something three previous journeys failed to do.
   ``That isn't to say my optimism means there's going to be a
release today or next week or next month,'' an exhausted Peggy Say
said Thursday shortly after stepping off a plane from Zurich at
John F. Kennedy International Airport.
   ``I think we all hope this will be resolved soon for all of
them,'' Mrs. Say said.
   She was referring to 18 Western hostages missing in Lebanon _
eight Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an
Irishman and an Italian.
   Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest held of the hostages. He was kidnapped in
Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Since then, Mrs. Say has traveled four times to the Middle East
and worked relentlessly on behalf of the hostages.
   But she said this trip, which included meetings with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, Pope John Paul II and
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat, was the
first to leave her hopeful.
   She traveled with a delegation from the AP to the Middle East,
Europe and Africa.
   She has said her optimism stems partly from reassurances by U.S.
officials that they are doing all they can, and partly from
statements from Iran, recent changes in nations around the globe
and pledges that the Syrians want to help.
   ``The Syrian commitment is 100 percent,'' she said.
   NBC News on Thursday quoted a senior administration official it
did not identify saying that Syria's foreign minister will travel
to Iran in a few days to press for the hostages' release.
   Say's comments and the NBC report came even as President Bush
called ``ridiculous'' news reports saying there was movement in the
hostage situation.
   ``I hope the hostages will be released. If I see an opportunity
for talks in private or in public about this to get them released,
I'll do it,'' he said as he left his hotel to visit a new Los
Angeles County jail.
   As to how she believed U.S. officials were working toward a
solution, Mrs. Say said, ``I assume they're talking as they always
have done through third parties.''
   She added: ``I was reassured that my government is doing what it
should be doing in a positive way to bring this to an end.''
   She said she was confident that when the hostages are released
it will be ``without conditions. There will be no ransom.''
   Mrs. Say was accompanied on her trip by Larry Heinzerling,
deputy director of World Services for the AP, which supports her
efforts financially and logistically while pressing its own efforts
for Anderson's freedom.

   Scottish bagpipes, English horns and ``The
Battle Hymn of the Republic'' set an appropriately unconventional
tone as relatives, celebrities and Hell's Angels bid farewell to
millionaire publisher Malcolm Forbes.
   ``He was so many things to so many of us,'' said Forbes's son,
Robert. ``Boss, bon vivant, raconteur, balloonist, columnist,
happiest millionaire, leader of the pack ... source, mentor,
friend, super this, mega that, father, grandfather, father-in-law,
uncle, cousin and sparkling, naughty boy.''
   Former President Nixon, actress Elizabeth Taylor and
motorcyclists were among 1,700 mourners who gathered at Thursday's
memorial service.
   Forbes, 70, who died of a heart attack Saturday at his 40-acre
estate in Far Hills, N.J., also was eulogized by his other
children: Timothy, Christopher, Malcolm Jr. and Moira Forbes Mumma.
   Nixon sat in a front pew next to Miss Taylor, who was a frequent
companion of Forbes; next to them were Nixon's daughter, Tricia
Cox, and former Mayor Edward I. Koch. Chrysler Chairman Lee
Iacocca, entrepreneur-daredevil Rocky Aoki, Barbara Walters, Joan
Rivers, David Rockefeller, Ann Landers and Mrs. Douglas MacArthur
also were present.
   Amid tears, the mourners smiled at their memories.
   ``He loved to laugh and to make people laugh _ a gift that is
one of life's most magic spices,'' said Robert Forbes.
   Forbes, whose worth was estimated at $400 million to $1 billion,
enjoyed his fortune by owning 68 motorcycles and globe-trotting
with royalty and celebrities aboard his gold-fixtured,
helicopter-equipped yacht. He celebrated his birthday last
September with a celebrity-studded, $2 million party in Morocco.
   He made the first free flight in a hot air balloon over Beijing
_ after the Chinese government denied permission, Timothy Forbes
recalled. ``It landed about 20 minutes later _ smack in the middle
of a Red Army base.''
   ``A balloon is not meant to be tied down. It's meant to be free,
to float with the wind,'' his father explained later.
   ``You see, for Pop, a balloon was _ and is _ an apt symbol of
the human spirit,'' Timothy said.
   At the landmark, Byzantine-style St. Bartholomew's Episcopal
Church on Park Avenue, worshipers sang ``The Battle Hymn of the
Republic,'' the words copied from Julia Ward Howe's original
manuscript in the Forbes collection. The Scottish bagpipes and
English horns _ the latter played by eight French musicians in red
and black hunter's costumes _ were mixed with traditional songs
from a white-robed choir.
   ``If you and your siblings had had to go to church every Sunday
dressed in kilts, with your friends snickering ... you could begin
to understand why all of us are so close,'' Christopher said.
   Forbes had directed that his body be cremated and the ashes
interred on Lauthala, his South Pacific island. He asked for this
inscription on his tombstone: ``While alive, he lived.''
   ``It's been a hell of a party, Pop, my special friend, and such
fun,'' said Robert. ``Thanks for the trip.''

<HEAD>Christians Object to Restaurant's Buddha Statue as `False God'</HEAD>

   An 8-foot, gold-colored statue of
Buddha outside a Chinese restaurant represents a ``false god'' and
should be removed, says a woman who complained to town officials
and drafted a petition.
   Eleven Harford County residents signed the demand for the
statue's removal, but San Lin Garden restaurant owner Yu-Pin Cass
says Buddha is staying.
   ``I'm really disappointed,'' she said. ``This has nothing to do
with religion. I wanted something to stand out for my business.''
   Nancy J. Collins of nearby Aberdeen, who describes herself as a
``Bible-believer,'' wrote town officials last week to complain
about the statue.
   ``A false god should not be thrust upon the public on the edge
of a national highway,'' Collins said.
   The smiling Buddha figure, with its robes open to display a
round belly, overlooks U.S. 40 in this city about 30 miles
northeast of Baltimore.
   ``All of my customers love it. I've got all these compliments.
People love the Buddha,'' Cass said. ``That's what's so great about
America. It doesn't matter if you're a Catholic, a Buddhist or
what. I will not move it.''
   Havre de Grace code inspector Clovis R. Bolen said the presence
of the 1,000-pound fiberglass Buddha does not violate any city
regulation.
   ``We have no law against it,'' Bolen said. ``I'm a Christian,
too. But it's an ornament she put in her yard for business
purposes.''
   Cass, who was born in Taiwan into the Buddhist faith, said the
flap reminded her of what she learned when studying the Bill of
Rights for her U.S. citizenship test.
   ``It says freedom of religion and freedom of speech,'' she said.

   The World Health Organization said today that
7,596 new cases of AIDS were reported last month, raising the total
by 3.5 percent to 222,740 cases listed worldwide since registration
began in 1979.
   The United States continued to account for more than half of the
global figure, with the number of cases up 3.3 percent in one month
from 117,781 to 121,645.
   Zimbabwe, updating a 3-month-old report, listed one of the
sharpest upward trends, with a new total of 1,632, a 42 percent
increase. Australia reported its number went up 7.3 percent in one
month to 1,707, while Canada listed a 6.9 percent increase to 3,509.
   Updates were lacking from most African countries with some,
including Zaire, Congo, and the Central African Republic, not
having filed new reports for more than a year.
   In Europe, France reported a total of 8,883 cases, 10 percent
more since the end of September. During the same period, the number
of Spanish cases went up by 16.8 percent to 4,633.
   Spain thus replaced West Germany as the European country with
the third-largest total, trailing Italy which has not yet updated
its latest list of 5,307 cases.
   West Germany, with a case number up 2.8 percent in one month to
4,433, and Britain, up 1.8 percent to 2,830, were among European
countries reporting below-average increases.
   The situation in Asia, the region with the lowest reported
incidence rate, remained largely unchanged. Japan was the lone
exception, reporting 182 cases by Dec. 31, 1989, a 68.5 percent
increase in three months.
   The World Health Organization estimates that the actual
accumulated total of AIDS cases may be as high as 600,000,
including about 300,000 fatalities. The director of the WHO's AIDS
program, Dr. Jonathan Mann, has predicted that the case total may
reach 6 million by the year 2000 and has warned that even this
estimate may be too low if infection with the AIDS virus
accelerates.

   NASA's plan to establish a base on the moon
and launch expeditions to Mars appears reasonable, but other
strategies should also be studied, the National Research Council
said today.
   President Bush endorsed the basic elements of the plan in a
speech last July 20, marking the 20th anniversary of the landing on
the moon of American astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.
   The proposal called for a base, to be established early in the
next century, that would have a full-time, long-term staff.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's strategy
calls for frequent flights to the moon and construction there of
living quarters, laboratories and power stations. The lunar soil
would be mined to extract oxygen, which then could be turned into
rocket fuel.
   Bush outlined no details in his proposal and said he was leaving
it up to NASA and to Vice President Dan Quayle, as head of the
National Space Council, to come up with timetables.
   Putting a space station in orbit has already been scheduled for
after 1995.
   NASA scientists say a moon base would be a laboratory for a
voyage to Mars. Bu others have questioned this, saying the moon is
not sufficiently like Mars and that establishing the moon base
would delay the Mars exploration.
   The National Research Council, an arm of the congressional
chartered National Academy of Sciences, was asked by Quayle to
evaluate NASA's strategy for the Mars exploration.
   David Beckwith, the vice president's press secretary, said,
``It's a very interesting report, and we are pleased and grateful.''
   ``The NASA report addresses a reasonable set of technological
and strategic approaches, but not all of the technically credible
approaches have been analyzed,'' the council said.
   It said any program for exploring the moon and Mars ``must
incorporate ideas from a variety of concepts, some that now exist
and others that will arise in the future.''
   ``Certainly more intense scrutiny and evaluation of the options
must take place before decisions are made regarding mission
architecture,'' said H. Guyford Stever, who chaired a 14-member
committee named by the council to perform the study.
   ``This is an initial discussion to offer direction for helping
the program get under way,'' said Stever, a former presidential
science adviser.
   The committee said that, although NASA does not discuss eventual
phaseout of the space shuttle in its report on its 90-day study of
moon-Mars exploration, the shuttle fleet will have to be replaced.
   ``Continued access of humans to space will require that planning
begin soon for a new transportation system that will first
supplement and then assume the shuttle's role ... sometime between
2000 and 2010,'' the committee said.
   The panel disagreed with the contention of scientists at the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory that humans could be placed
on Mars by the year 2000. It said that ``underestimates the many
practical and difficult engineering and operational challenges
involved.''
   The NASA plan calls for placing humans on the moon in 2001 and
on Mars by 2011 at the earliest.
   The Research Council study said even those dates depend on
accelerating completion of the planned space station, which could
result in higher risks and costs.
   In addition to replacing the space shuttle, a new generation of
launch vehicles will be needed to lift massive equipment into
lower-Earth orbit, the committee said.

   The Supreme Court today ruled that an
American held in solitary confinement in a hospital room for the
past five weeks should be allowed to meet friends and attorneys of
her choice, news reports said.
   Patricia Munday, 39, is being treated under police guard at a
Calcutta hospital for injuries sustained when she was attacked by
villagers in Purulia, near Calcutta.
   Ms. Munday, who was part of a United Nations team that won the
1981 Nobel Peace Prize, is being held for links with a mysterious
Hindu cult called the Ananda Marg, or the Path of Bliss, which is
based in the Purulia district.
   Membership in the cult is not a criminal offense, but police are
deeply suspicious of the order, claiming it practices black magic.
Ms. Munday has not been charged.
   The Supreme Court order said Ms. Munday, who is from Waitsfield,
Vt., could see friends and attorneys, but a policeman would be
present during the meetings, according to the Press Trust of India.
   Arguments on the legality of her detention have been set for
March 16.
   In Calcutta, a prominent politican who unsuccessfully attempted
to visit Ms. Munday on Thursday called her detention ``inhuman and
uncivilized.''
   Mamta Banerjee, a member of the opposition Congress Party, said
West Bengal state officials ``cried themselves hoarse for Nelson
Mandela. But what are they doing to this helpless foreign lady? She
will go mad in this condition.''
   Miss Banerjee, who said she visited the Belle Vue Nursing Home
in an attempt to meet Ms. Munday, said she saw the American woman
briefly before police pushed Miss Banerjee away from the door of
the hospital room.
   ``I raised my voice and told her that I would like to offer any
help that she might need,'' Miss Banerjee said. ``She thanked me.''
   West Bengal state, of which Calcutta is the capital, is ruled by
the Communist Party of India-Marxist, which in the past has often
clashed with followers of Ananda Marg.
   Ms. Munday, who was a member of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees team that won the Nobel Peace Prize for
its work in Somalia, arrived in India from Nepal on a private visit.
   Villagers attacked her and a female companion when they were
traveling in the Purulia district on Jan. 26. Ms. Munday suffered a
gash on her forehead and was arrested when she tried to lodge a
complaint about the attack.
   Ananda Marg is a secretive cult which claims to have branches
around the world. Little information about the group's activities
is available because members are bound by an oath of secrecy.
Indian newspapers have said the group uses skulls and daggers in
its ritualistic dances.
   The group says it wants to create a social, economic and
spiritual order that will replace both capitalism and communism and
rid society of sectarianism and parochialism.

<TEXT>
   A man who waited five hours on his
front porch for his Social Security check opened fire on the
postman with a shotgun when the mail finally arrived, authorities
say.
   Gerald Pawloski, 42, wounded a substitute mail carrier and at
least three other people in the assault Thursday, police said. He
was scheduled for arraignment late today in Grand Rapids District
Court on four counts of assault with intent to murder, Police Chief
William Hegarty said.
   ``I would not think of those shots as being random,'' Hegarty
said.
   Mail carrier Kenneth Peek was listed in fair condition today at
Butterworth Hospital, hospital spokesman Tim Bulson said. At least
one pedestrian and two passing motorists were hit by pellets but
not seriously injured, police said.
   Pawloski, forced out of his house by tear gas, surrendered to
police about 8:30 p.m. after a five-hour siege.
   Hegarty had made a television appeal to Pawloski, saying police
would solve problems he had with his Social Security check.
   Rose Sheck, who managed the apartment building where Pawloski
lived for six years, said he had been awaiting his Social Security
check. ``On check day he'd always be out on the front porch waiting
for it,'' she said.
   Neighbor Alan Peckham said he was walking down the street when
he heard shots.
   ``He was shooting like crazy at the mailman and at the car in
front of him, filling the car full of holes,'' Peckham said. ``I
walked up to about 15 or 20 feet away from him and asked him what
he was doing. He said he was shooting at the postman.
   ``He kept shooting at that car and at any car that came past.
The mailman was hiding behind the car. Jerry was mumbling to
himself. It was just like it was his job or something. He wasn't
sweating, shaking or nothing. It was like he was skeet shooting.''

<HEAD>Death Toll Rises to 17; Three Americans Reported Among Dead</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Another body was found today in the burned
rubble of a luxury hotel, bringing the death toll in the
fast-moving fire to 17. At least three of the victims were
Americans, police said.
   One of the dead U.S. citizens was identified by a relative as
67-year-old Robert D. Cresap of Houston. His sister-in-law, Mrs.
Alfred Cresap of Sioux City, Iowa, said Cresap and his wife had
been in Egypt one day when the blaze broke out Thursday at the
Heliopolis Sheraton near Cairo's international airport. The
identities of the other Americans were not known.
   Meanwhile, questions continued to be raised about the tent in
which the fire began. The government newspaper Al-Akhbar reported
today that preliminary inquiries show that Cairo officials ``sent
several warnings to the hotel management to remove the tent because
it was a fire hazard.''
   The newspaper said the tent, which housed a restaurant and was
attached to the hotel, was erected in violation of rules requiring
that the Ministry of Tourism be informed of such construction.
   The head of Cairo's fire brigade, Maj. Gen. Adel Nigm, said
Thursday such canvas tents are fire hazards and the Sheraton put it
up without consulting the fire department.
   A man at Sheraton's national headquarters, who refused to give
his name, denied the hotel chain had been warned about the tent.
``If that's true, then why didn't the authorities come and remove
it?'' he said.
   Asked if there was fire-safety equipment in the tent, he said
yes but could provide no details.
   Fire spread quickly through the T-shaped, 630-room room hotel
early Thursday after sparks from an oven caught the canvas on fire,
and strong winds fed the flames.
   The six-story hotel had neither fire alarms nor sprinklers _
they are not mandatory in Egypt _ and guests tied sheets together
or jumped from windows to escape. Many of the injured suffered
broken bones.
   At least eight people remained hospitalized.
   Harb said the dead victims identified so far were three Finns,
three French, three Americans and a Greek. Seven people were not
identified, he said. The director of Cairo's central morque, Dr.
Kamal el-Saadani, said the victims also included one Briton and one
Chilean. Most died of burns, he said.
   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman would only confirm one American dead,
and she said three were unaccounted for. There was no explanation
for the discrepancy.
   The injured included Cresap's wife, Helen, who was reported in
good condition at Heliopolis Hospital.
   The Heliopolis Sheraton, about two miles from Cairo
International Airport, was a favorite of airline crews, and airline
workers were among the victims. Several flights were reported
delayed on Thursday, some for hours, because of disruptions
involving the crews.

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Sen. Lowell P. Weicker, a
crusading liberal Republican who said he was out of politics for
good when he lost his 1988 bid for a fourth term, announced today
he will run for governor as an independent.
   Weicker announced his plans to reporters at a packed news
conference at the state Capitol, ending months of speculation about
a political comeback.
   ``Both political parties, in Washington and in Connecticut,
don't want to handle the tough answers and the tough problems
because they are afraid of the heat. ... I'm willing to go ahead
and take that kind of heat,'' Weicker said.
   Sixteen months ago, when he conceded defeat to state Attorney
General Joseph Lieberman, Weicker appeared to rule out any return
to politics.
   The narrow loss to Lieberman was Weicker's only electoral defeat
in a 26-year career during which he constantly flirted with
disaster by antagonizing Republican leaders.
   ``In 1988, you all took me down a peg or two. And probably
deservedly so,'' Weicker said today.
   His decision to seek the governor's job had been a well-kept
secret; only his family and a handful of friends were told.
   Weicker apparently made no courtesy calls to top Republicans,
including Connecticut's three GOP congressmen, to tell them of his
plans. One of those congressmen is John G. Rowland, the perceived
front-runner for the GOP gubernatorial nomination.
   Republican leaders had said it would be a mistake for Weicker to
jump in, either as a Republican or an independent, because Weicker
has no clear base of support since he lost in 1988. He always
enjoyed strong support from Democrats and unaffiliated voters and
was the only Republican to win statewide office since 1970.
   Democrats had been hoping Weicker would run, since he could
split the GOP and threaten what many view as the Republicans' best
shot in 20 years at winning the governor's chair.
   During his 18 years in the Senate, Weicker was constantly at
odds with his party, starting with his opposition to President
Nixon during the Watergate scandal.
   Democratic Gov. William A. O'Neill, who plans to seek a third
term, said Thursday that a Weicker candidacy would make it ``a very
spirited contest.''
   Since his 1988 defeat, Weicker has headed a group promoting
medical research called Research! America, based outside Washington.
   Besides Rowland, three Republicans are seeking the GOP
nomination: state Senate Minority Leader Reginald Smith of New
Hartford, New Haven developer Joel Schiavone and Fairfield banker
Joseph McGee.

   An elderly white couple
received a rousing welcome today when they became the first exiled
members of the African National Congress to return to South Africa.
   ``Down with white supremacy, up with people's power,'' shouted
Jack Simon, 83, upon his arrival at Jans Smuts Airport in
Johannesburg.
   Simon, a university professor, and his 76-year-old wife Rachel
Alexander, a trade union organizer, previously were banned in South
Africa and fled the country in 1965 for the ANC's exile
headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia.
   Several hundred activists, black and white, cheered the couple
at the airport and sang ``God Bless Africa,'' the anthem of the
anti-apartheid movement.
   ``This is a great and joyous occasion after 25 years of exile,''
Mrs. Alexander said. ``We must see to it the breakthrough in South
Africa is widened and our people take over power in a peaceful and
orderly manner.''
   President F.W. de Klerk last month legalized the ANC and more
than 60 other opposition groups. The ANC, the largest group
fighting the white-led government, had been banned since 1960.
   The ANC has an estimated 15,000 members in exile, and they are
expected to begin returning in large numbers shortly. The ANC also
announced today that it will move its headquarters to Johannesburg.
   The government has said that ordinary members of previously
outlawed groups are free to return. However, the government has not
clarified the position of exiles suspected of involvement in
guerrilla attacks.
   Some members of the other recently legalized groups, such as the
Pan Africanist Congress, already have begun to return to South
Africa.
   ``We decided in 1965 to ... emigrate to Lusaka, the closest
independent base from which to work for the liberation of South
Africa,'' Simon and Mrs. Alexander said in a joint statement. ``We
return home to continue the struggle for liberation.''
   In another development, about 1,000 people peacefully marched on
Parliament in Cape Town today to express support for some 350
prisoners on a 5-day-old hunger strike.
   Friends and family members of the hunger strikers have marched
in Cape Town every day this week, and dozens have been arrested,
although there were no incidents today.
   The inmates at the Robben Island Prison off Cape Town stopped
eating Monday, saying they consider themselves political prisoners
and should be released under reforms initiated last month by de
Klerk.
   De Klerk said people imprisoned simply for belonging to those

   Minority groups hailed the conviction of five
white supremacist ``skinheads'' for racially motivated crimes
against Jews, blacks and Hispanics.
   An all-white jury found all five men guilty Thursday of two
counts of conspiring to violate the civil rights of minorities.
   The defendants, members of the Confederate Hammerskins, were
accused of defacing a synagogue and Jewish community center in 1988
and roughing up and chasing blacks and Hispanics from Robert E. Lee
Park that same year.
   During the trial, former ``skinheads'' testified that the
Confederate Hammerskins planned to pump cyanide gas into the air
conditioning system at Temple Shalom in a reminder of the
Holocaust, in which millions of Jews perished.
   A 21-year-old skinhead who was a prosecution witness in the
trial was arrested, along with six others, following a
confrontation with a black woman, police said today.
   The woman complained skinheads yelled racial slurs at her after
breaking her car's windshield.
   Michael Thornton, 21, of Center Hill, Fla., was jailed in
Richardson, a north Dallas suburb, on several charges, including
disorderly conduct, criminal mischief and public intoxication, said
police Sgt. Ray Pennington. Thornton is a former member of the
Confederate Hammerskins.
   The New York-based Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith called
the verdict ``a major victory in the continuing battle against
hate-inspired violence by skinheads around the country.''
   ``This should send a warning across the nation that young
racists cannot commit crimes of hate,'' said Barry Kowalski, a
prosecutor with the U.S. Justice Department's civil rights
division. ``They can believe what they want and say what they want,
but they better not vandalize or commit acts of violence.''
   Each of the charges carries up to 10 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine. Sentencing was set for April 19.
   Defense attorneys contended that the men, known as skinheads
because of their close-cropped hair, were being tried for their
beliefs. They said their clients merely were exercising free speech.
   ``It is very unpopular, the things they believe,'' said Leon
Carter, a Dallas lawyer who defended Jordan. ``But they have the
right to believe it.''
   The defendants are Jon Lance Jordan, 19, of Garland; Sean
Christian Tarrant, 20, and Daniel Alvis Wood, 20, of Dallas;
Christopher Barry Greer, 25, of Irving, and Michael Lewis Lawrence,
22, of Tulsa, Okla.,
   Rabbi Kenneth Roseman of Temple Shalom praised the verdict but
added, ``Just because five people have been convicted, doesn't mean
there aren't more radicals and bigots around.''

   The head of the military tribunal that
condemned Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife to
death has committed suicide, officials said today.
   Maj. Gen. Gica Popa shot himself in the head Thursday at his
office in the Ministry of Justice, Justice Minister Teofil Pop told
a news conference.
   Popa was rushed to the Bucharest military hospital, where he
died two hours later with his wife and daughter by his side, Pop
said. The military officer left a suicide note that asked for
forgiveness, but did not explain the motive for his act.
   Pop said the suicide was the result of a ``very grave
depression'' and said ``it is possible'' that it was related to the
Ceausescu trial.
   A source close to the family, however, said that Popa had been
troubled by anonymous death threats, apparently from Ceausescu
loyalists, for the past two months.
   Pop said that he had recently asked Popa if he had been
threatened after the trial, and the major-general said no.
   The justice minister also confirmed that Popa's voice was the
one heard on the video-recording of the Dec. 25 trial of Ceausescu
and his wife, Elena, which was broadcast repeatedly on Romanian and
international television.
   The angry voice was heard interrogating the pair and then
announcing that they had been sentenced to death for crimes against
the Romanian people. The couple was then executed.
   The identity of the person was not made public earlier ``to
protect the judges while there were still terrorists around,'' Pop
said. He used the word ``terrorists'' to refer to members of
Ceausescu's secret police force, who fought revolutionary forces
for about a week after the dictator was toppled Dec. 22.
   Pop said Popa, who was the head of the Military Territorial
Tribunal, ``had extraordinary prestige and was one of our best
judges.''
   The prosecutor-general's office and police were investigating
Popa's death, officials said.
   News of the suicide coincided with the start of a trial in
Timisoara of 21 former secret police officers charged in connection
with scores of deaths in that city, where the revolution began.
   It was the first trial of ex-officials accused of trying to
crush the revolution before it spread across the country.

   The African National Congress today named
Nelson Mandela as its deputy president and welcomed him and two
others to leadership positions they held when they were arrested in
South Africa in the 1960s.
   Mandela, released Feb. 11 after 27 years in prison, becomes the
No. 2 official in the ANC, behind president Oliver Tambo, who is
recuperating from a stroke in a Swedish clinic. The post of deputy
president is a new position.
   Mandela effectively becomes the ANC's top leader, because the
ailing Tambo is widely believed to be unable to resume an active
political life as the ANC sets about establishing a political
framework in South Africa.
   The ANC, the main black group fighting South Africa's white-led
government, also reaffirmed its intention to meet soon with South
African President F.W. de Klerk and said it would soon open
headquarters offices in Johannesburg.
   While the ANC was outlawed in South Africa, its political and
guerrilla leaders operated their headquarters from Zambia. De Klerk
lifted the 30-year ban on the ANC on Feb. 2.
   Mandela and fellow longtime political detainees Walter Sisulu
and Govan Mbeki resumed seats they held on the National Executive
Committee when they were arrested more than two decades ago, said
an ANC statement read at a news conference by acting president and
meeting chairman Alfred Nzo.
   Sisulu, 77, and Mbeki, 79, were sentenced to life in prison
along with Mandela in 1964. Mbeki was released in 1987 and Sisulu
was freed in October. The committee is the ANC's main policy-making
group.
   Mandela gave few details on his new role in the ANC.
   ``I am prepared to serve in any role the national executive
instructs me to fill,'' he said.
   Mandela will visit neighboring Zimbabwe on Sunday and then
``move swiftly'' to see Tambo in Sweden, Nzo said.
   Mandela is known to have invitations to visit several other
countries, but ANC officials indicated the organization will be
selective about accepting foreign trips and future engagements for
him out of concerns for his health.
   The 71-year-old black nationalist, treated in prison for
tuberculosis two years ago, receives a daily checkup from a
physician, said a senior ANC official, who asked not to be
identified.
   ``For someone who has been isolated in prison for so long, it's
incredible. He hasn't stopped. We all want to be sure he isn't
overworking,'' the official said.
   ``We have just got him back (from prison). The last thing he
should see now is hospital walls,'' the official added.
   Mandela told reporters he was optimistic about a political
settlement but said he was unwilling to predict any time frame for
negotiations or the return of exiles.
   ``We are already making progress. There is no reason why we
should not be able to make further progress,'' he said. ``I am
optimistic that the process of removing all obstacles (to
negotiations) is on. I will be surprised if we don't succeed in
removing the obostacles.'''
   The ANC reiterated that it will not enter formal negotiations
with the South African government until it lifts the state of
emergency and releases all political prisoners.
   De Klerk has said he plans to lift the 3{-year-old state of
emergency and will free prisoners convicted of belonging to
previously outlawed organizations that he legalized last month.
However, the government has said it will not free people convicted
of violent acts.

   Hundreds of people demonstrated in six
cities to support Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's demand that
Poland be allowed to take part in international talks on a reunited
Germany, organizers said.
   The demonstrations Thursday in Krakow, Katowice, Poznan, Lublin,
Rzeszow and Belchatow were organized by an anti-Communist group,
Confederation for an Independent Poland.
   The state-run PAP news agency said some protesters carried
banners reading ``Nothing About Central Europe Without Poland'' and
``Yalta Never Again,'' a reference to the 1945 conference at which
the leaders of the four Allies reworked Poland's borders.
   The confederation's leader, Leszek Moczulski, told a news
conference that Poland deserves access to the ``two-plus-four''
talks on German reunification that would involveg West and East
Germany as well as the United States, Soviet Union, Britain and
France.
   Poland wants to be a part of the talks to guarantee that former
German land it received after World War II remains in Polish hands.
   ``Personally, I see no real threat to our western border,'' said
Moczulski. ``But such a situation cannot be ruled out.''
   Mazowiecki will visit Paris and Washington this month in his
effort to win international support for a treaty confirming the
present Polish border.
   The Paris trip will take place March 9, while Mazowiecki will
fly to the United States in the last 10 days of March, government
spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska told reporters today. In
Washington, he will meet with President Bush and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, she said.
   Mazowiecki also will visit Canada.
   Krzysztof Krol, another leader of the confederation, said more
than 2,000 people participated in the demonstrations Thursday. He
said the largest one was in Krakow, where about 1,500 people
gathered.
   The confederation is a nationalistic party that often stages
demonstrations along with extreme anti-Communist groups. It has
been active for more than a decade, founded with the aim to seek
total freedom for Poland from Moscow.
   The precise extent of its support is not known, but it failed to
win any elections to parliament last year.

<TEXT>
   The government Finance Committee approved $14.8
million in funding for a new detention center to house 10,000 more
Vietnamese to relieve overcrowding at existing camps.
   The panel voted 26-11 to build the camp on outlying Tai A Chau
Island. Public anger over spending more money had delayed approval
by a month.
   About 55,000 Vietnamese live in this British colony's squalid
camps, which are filled to near capacity. Hong Kong considers most
of the Vietnamese illegal immigrants subject to deportation, but
Hanoi so far has accepted the forced repatriation of only 51 people.
   More than 25,000 Vietnamese sailed into Hong Kong between last
March and July, the season when winds over the South China Sea blow
toward the colony.
   Officials say the new camp will enable temporary and
unsatisfactory camps to be closed and will ease overcrowding at
remaining centers. They said other measures will be needed if a new
influx of Vietnamese arrive.
   Construction of the Tai A Chau camp is expected to begin soon
and take six months, with Britain matching the Hong Kong
expenditure.
   During debate Friday, some Finance Committee members suggested
the United States and the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees, which oppose forced repatriation, pay for the facility.

<HEAD>Draft Plan Seeks $65 Billion in New Health Benefits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A draft proposal to spend $65 billion on two
of the nation's biggest health care problems is running into
behind-the-scenes White House opposition even before it comes up
for a vote.
   The U.S. Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care
planned to vote today on a proposal to provide health insurance to
more than 31 million uninsured Americans and help 9 million
Americans pay the high cost of long-term care.
   The commission's closed meeting stretched past three hours this
morning and continued into early afternoon. Several sources said
Thursday that approval was not guaranteed, noting that the White
House had been pressuring Republicans on the 15-member commission
to withhold their support.
   Rep. Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, a California Democrat who is a
member of the commission, predicted its recommendations to Congress
would be a ``dead letter'' because of opposition from the White
House.
   ``The postmaster in this case is President Bush and ... they
don't want a plan which would embarrass them in the next
election,'' Stark said.
   The commission's draft plan would require all businesses with
more than 100 employees to provide private health insurance to
their workers, or to contribute to a public plan for employees and
non-working dependents.
   When fully implemented, all Americans would be provided health
insurance through their employer or the public plan.
   It also would offer all Americans coverage for long-term care in
their homes and for the first three months in a nursing home.
Federal benefits for additional time spent in a nursing home would
be greatly improved.
   The draft plan did not recommend how to pay for the benefits,
saying ``the commission is committed to raising whatever additional
revenues are necessary.''
   The commission _ including 12 members of Congress and three
White House appointees _ was created by Congress in 1988 to tackle
the thorny questions of how to ensure quality, affordable care for
the uninsured and for those devastated by the high costs of
long-term care.
   The panel is commonly known as the Pepper Commission in honor of
its first chairman, the late Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., an
outspoken advocate for the elderly and disadvantaged.
   Stark criticized the draft plan, saying it would not guarantee
health coverage for all Americans, particularly those employed by
small businesses. He noted it provided extended nursing home
protection only to those of limited income and assets, and
complained that it failed to recommend how to pay for the $65
billion program.
   But two advocacy groups for the elderly said the proposed plan
recommended important improvements in the nation's health care
system.
   John Rother, legislative director for the American Association
of Retired Persons, called it ``a promising start.''
   ``We're pleased to see that the plan is for all Americans,
regardless of age, and that it addresses both the needs of those
without health insurance coverage at the same time it addresses the
long-term care problem,'' Rother said.
   Ronald Pollack, executive director of the Families USA
Foundation, a non-profit advocacy group for the elderly, said the
plan ``meets the crucial goals of health-care reform _ protection
from the devastation of long-term care costs at home or in a
nursing home as well as affordable health care for all Americans,
regardless of income or job status.''
   Stark proposed an alternative plan that would require more
comprehensive insurance coverage and nursing home benefits, to be
paid for by broad new taxes on personal and corporate income.
   He conceded that with a $120 billion-a-year price tag, his plan
``is apt not to be very popular.'' However, he said an agreement on
how to meet the nation's health care needs will come only after
people recognize the extent of the problem and the costs for a
complete solution.

   Neptune, the Roman god that stirred
up storms to sink mariners who ventured to sea, has caused a storm
of another sort at a condominium complex.
   Three weeks ago, the Island Club condo association spent $1,300
for a 1,400-pound, 6-foot-10 concrete statue of Neptune for the
entrance of the building.
   Neptune is nude, except for a strategically located fish tail.
Trouble is, some residents are complaining that even the fish tail
is too graphic.
   The condo board decided to let residents vote on the issue, but
for now a mesh fishnet covers the problematic parts.
   Linley Ray, owner of Paramount Concrete, the Pompano Beach
company that sold Neptune to the condo, is aware of the controversy.
   Ms. Ray said one woman who lives at the complex swore at her as
she was painting the cream-colored Neptune.
   ``There's nothing obscene about it,'' Ms. Ray said. ``It's a
classic standard Neptune statue. His behind is semi-exposed, but on
the front it's really a fish tail and it's very obvious it was put
there to hide everything.''
   Gary Berletic, president of one of the condo's association, said
he doesn't find Neptune offensive because the fish tail hides all.
   ``It's not really lewd,'' he said. ``I think it looks nice.''

<TEXT>
   South Korea's foreign minister said
Friday his top diplomatic priority for 1990 will be establishing
formal ties with the Soviet Union.
   Speaking to South Korean diplomats, Foreign Minister Choi
Ho-joong also said Seoul will try to join the United Nations as a
full member in two or three years.
   South Korea, which is staunchly anti-Communist, has recently
established formal ties with Hungary and several other socialist
nations but it has yet to normalize relations wnion
and China, close allies of North Korea.
   The Soviet Unith the Soviet Uion and China basically limited their
contact with
South Korea to non-political areas but the communist nations also
have shown interest in expanding their links further with Seoul.
   Because of its rivalry with North Korea, South Korea's past bids
to enter the United Nations have been blocked by the Soviet Union
and China.
   North Korea opposes a separate entry into the United Nations by
the two Koreas, contending that would perpetuate the division of
the peninsula.
   After some years of improved relations with the Soviet Union and
China, Seoul is increasingly confident they would not oppose
Seoul's separate U.N. membership in two or three years.
   The foreign minister reported to President Roh Tae-woo lastnt
or wholly owned ventures in computer manufacturing and coal and
natural gas development.
   Hyundai earlier signed a formal contract to build a soap plant
and develop forest in the Soviet Far East.
   Two-way trade between the Soviet Union and South Korea reached
$700 million last year and is expected to reach $1 billion this
year.

<TEXT>
   Rep. James Courter, a six-term Republican who
lost a bid for governor of New Jersey in a bruising battle last
year, will not seek re-election to a seventh House term, sources
said today.
   Courter, 48, scheduled an afternoon announcement at his
Morristown, N.J., headquarters to dicuss his plans.
   The decision by the northern New Jersey congressman, ranking
Republican on the House Armed Services subcommittee on procurement
and military nuclear systems, comes three weeks after he changed
his position on abortion and announced he would support a woman's
right to choose whether to have an abortion.
   Courter's anti-abortion position during the gubernatorial
campaign drew national attention, with pro-choice women's
organizations targeting him for defeat and supporting his opponent,
former Rep. Jim Florio.
   After Courter announced the switch, anti-abortion colleagues
criticized him for changing sides and Democrats accused him of
waffling on the issue for political purposes.
   Courter built his reputation in Washington on defense issues
such as the Strategic Defense Initiative and was a defender of
Oliver North during the Iran-Contra hearings.
   Democrats have pinned their hopes for winning back the House
seat on Marguerite Chandler, a wealthy businesswoman and
philanthropist from Somerset County, N.J. She has amassed more than
$200,000 for a Democratic bid and is expected to announce her
candidacy this month.

<HEAD>Six Language Services Saved at Voice of America</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Voice of America, responding to pressure
from its managers and listeners, has decided to save six language
services slated for elimination by budget cuts.
   VOA Director Richard Carlson informed employees on Friday that
the Lao, Greek, Turkish, Swahili, Slovene and Uzbek language
programs would remain on the air and their 57 broadcasters and
producers would keep their jobs.
   The announcement came just one month after Carlson informed
employees the services would go off the air April 1 to save the
government's radio network $3 million.
   ``We will be given the money to keep the services on the air,''
Carlson said. But it was unclear where the money would come from.
   Bruce Gelb, the director of the U.S. Information Agency, which
oversees VOA, wants the money taken out of the construction account
used to build transmitters and upgrade technical services.
   But Congress, which must approve such a transfer of money, is
opposed, Carlson said.
   He said Gelb had assured him that if Congress rejects the move,
money would be found elsewhere in USIA's budget.
   Carlson's announcement that the six services would be eliminated
triggered a clash with Gelb, who reportedly claimed he knew nothing
about the plan even though he had signed the cuts proposal.
   The controversy resulted in both men, who are presidential
appointees, holding talks with White House officials and being
urged to bury their differences.
   Greek-Americans and other supporters of VOA have been lobbying
Congress to prevent the cuts.

<TEXT>
   Despite the failure of
communist regimes around the world, the South African Communist
Party remains an influential and popular force that has not given
up its goal of a socialist state.
   While its actual membership is tiny, many blacks respect the
South African Communist Party because of its prominent role in
opposing the country's white-minority government. Red communist
flags and slogans are common in black townships and at
anti-government demonstrations.
   Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader released
Feb. 11 after 27 years in prison, hailed the party in his first
speech on the day he left prison.
   ``I salute the South African Communist Party for its sterling
contribution to the struggle for democracy. ... We are heartened by
the fact that the alliance between ourselves and the party remains
as strong as it always was,'' he said.
   The party's call for a socialist state and a redistribution of
wealth also appeals to many poor blacks who see the white-dominated
capitalist economy as a pillar of apartheid. Communists claim that
whites, who make up less than 15 percent of the population, control
98 percent of South African's wealth.
   Joe Slovo, the white secretary-general of the party, says the
biggest question facing South Africa beyond ending white-minority
rule is how to handle the economy.
   ``The fundamental aim of economic policy must be the
redistribution of wealth,'' he said in a recent statement.
   President F.W. de Klerk legalized the Communist Party and other
anti-government groups Feb. 2 to help start talks on ending
white-minority rule and sharing political power with the black
majority. The party, founded in 1921, was banned in 1950, but
operates underground in South Africa with headquarters in Zambia.
   For years the South African government vehemently denounced the
party, portraying its members as Soviet agents plotting to build a
Marxist slave state. Government officials routinely claimed that
black nationalist groups were communist fronts.
   Little is known about the highly secretive party. Estimates of
its strength range from a few hundred members to a few thousand
members with the Communists refusing to give any detailed
information on the party.
   The secrecy makes it difficult to assess the party's strength or
evaluate what role it may play in South Africa's future. It appears
to have considerable influence within some black political and
labor groups.
   The main source of strength is its close ties to the African
National Congress, the main anti-apartheid black force, and the
group most likely to form a future government after the end of
white rule. Senior Communist Party officials also hold important
ANC posts and play key roles in its affairs.
   While the Communists have few members in South Africa, the party
reportedly has been able to recruit many black political leaders
and intellectuals. At least half the members on the ANC's ruling
National Executive Council are party members or sympathizers,
according to independent South African press reports.
   The Communist Party's ``strategic position within the ANC, its
commitment to socialism and the tendency of township radicals to
link capitalism with racism, means it will not necessarily be
confined to a minor role in the dramatic years ahead,'' The Star
newspaper of Johannesburg said recently.
   The party also served as the link between the ANC and the Soviet
Union and as a conduit for Soviet aid. But that role has diminished
following a decline in Soviet aid because of Moscow's internal
political problems.
   The ANC denies it is Marxist, saying it works with any group
that fights apartheid. But ANC economic programs lean toward
socialism and it favors some degree of economic nationalization to
redistribute wealth.
   Critics contend Slovo and the Communists remain hard-line
Marxists who have simply adopted new language to conceal their true
intentions. White right-wing groups contend any black government
will be taken over by Communists.
   Slovo, a former head of the ANC's military wing, says the
Communists will launch a recruiting drive in South Africa to build
up their strength. He says the party also will send a delegation
for independent talks with the government on the future of South
Africa.
   Slovo has tried to moderate the party's position following the
collapse of Eastern Europe's Communist regimes. He has stressed the
need for democracy and pledged to seek a socialist state through
peaceful means.
   ``We also believe that if there is real democracy in the
post-apartheid state, the way would be open for a peaceful
progression towards our party's ultimate objective _ a socialist
South Africa. This approach is consistent with the Marxist view ...
that the working class must win the majority to its side,'' he said
recently.
   But Slovo still talks in traditional Marxist terms of the state
serving the working class, and people abandoning the pursuit of
personal gain and working for the common good.
   ``For our part we firmly believe in the future of socialism; nor
do we dismiss its whole past as an unmitigated failure,'' he said.
   Communists and other activists shrug off questions about the
failure of communism elsewhere, saying they won't repeat the
mistakes of others.
   ``The socialist countries have only been in existence for less
than a century. They have overcome serious problems and will do so
in the future,'' said Ahmed Kathrada, an ANC leader.

   Former federal judge Arlin M. Adams was
appointed today to investigate allegations that former Housing
Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. and top aides illegally steered
government rent subsidies to politically connected developers.
   Adams was appointed an independent counsel by a special court to
investigate allegations that Pierce and top aides at the Department
of Housing and Urban Development conspired to defraud the Moderate
Rehabilitation Program.
   Adams, who served 17 years as a member of the 3rd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Philadelphia, is now a private lawyer in that
city and chairman of the board of directors of the University of
Pennsylvania Law School.
   The appointment had been sought by Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh following a 90-day preliminary inquiry into the
allegations by the Justice Department's public integrity section.
   ``We're glad that an independent counsel has been finally
appointed and the investigation can proceed,'' said Robert Plotkin,
a lawyer for Pierce. ``We have every reason to expect that Judge
Adams will conduct the investigation in a fair and impartial
manner.''
   Adams, 68, has been affiliated with the Philadelphia law firm of
Schnader, Harrison, Segal and Lewis since retiring from the court
in 1986.
   A former state secretary of public welfare, he also chaired the
Pennsylvania Trade Association Commission from 1967 to 1971.
   In 1988, Adams was approached by Justice Department officials
about the possibility of becoming deputy attorney general in the
waning days of the tenure of Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
Adams said he had other professional commitments and was could not
consider taking the post.
   Asked about what preparation he has had for his new appointment,
Adams recalled in an interview today that as state welfare
secretary in the 1960s ``I got involved'' in looking into alleged
misuse of various government programs.
   In a statement, the Special Division of the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals here said that Adams ``brings to this investigation the
judgment, experience and ability acquired by many years of service
as a federal circuit judge, as a private practitioner and as a
recognized leader of the courts and the bar of the nation.''
   Under the jurisdiction set by the court, Adams is empowered to
determine whether Pierce ``and other department officials may have
committed the crime of conspiracy to defraud the United States or
any other federal crimes ... relating to the administration of the
selection process of the department's Moderate Rehabilitation
Program from 1984 through 1988.''
   The special court's order also empowers Adams to investigate any
allegations of ``perjury, obstruction of justice and destruction of
evidence and intimidation of witnesses'' during the course of the
investigation.
   Under the Moderate Rehabilitation Program, developers receive
tax credits and rent subsidies for performing a moderate amount of
rehabilitation on housing for low-income citizens.
   In his Feb. 1 application to the court for appointment of an
independent counsel, Thornburgh cited reports of a ``widespread
perception among developers'' and municipal officials that ``funds
were being disbursed in disproportionate amounts to projects backed
by prominent Republicans acting as consultants or by former HUD
officials.''
   The Justice Department's preliminary inquiry included a review
of voluminous reports compiled by HUD's inspector general as well
as testimony before a House Government Operations subcommittee that
held hearings on the agency last year.
   The original request for an independent counsel was made by
Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee. They cited
allegations of political favoritism as well as charges that Pierce
had lied under oath during congressional testimony last spring.
   Thornburgh found there was no basis for further allegations that
Pierce lied under oath.
   Pierce refused to answer further questions when called back
twice to give additional testiony before the subcommittee. He
invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.
   Under the special prosecutor law, the three-judge panel, chaired
by Senior Circuit Judge George MacKinnon, is required to appoint an
independent counsel after receiving a request to do so from the
attorney general.

   The government's main economic forecasting
gauge was unchanged in January, the Commerce Department said Friday
in a report that analysts said points to an aimless economy with
little growth but little chance of a recession either.
   Economist Kevin Logan of the Swiss Bank Corp. in New York said
the Index of Leading Economic Indicators means the economy ``is
moving sideways ... There is not a lot of strength but neither is
there pervasive weakness.''
   ``January's report ... shows that the economy has no clear
direction,'' said William K. MacReynolds, forecasting director for
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   ``I would regard the leading indicators for January as
suggesting that we continue to be in a period where we're not
likely to tip into recession, but where growth will continue at a
sluggish pace,'' added Richard Peach, an economist for the Mortgage
Bankers Association.
   The index, designed to forecast economic activity six to nine
months in advance, followed two months of increases. However, the
December figure paled somewhat in the latest report, being revised
downward from an 0.8 percent gain to 0.6 percent because of lower
orders for consumer goods.
   The index rose a weak 0.1 percent in November after falling 0.4
percent in October. The flat January report means the index
remained at 145.3 percent of its 1982 base of 100.
   Economists had been expecting a moderate increase.
   In another bit of bad news, the Commerce Department also
reported Friday that sales of new homes plummeted 7.1 percent in
January to the lowest level in nearly a year.
   Both the housing and the manufacturing industries have borne the
brunt of Federal Reserve efforts to contain inflation by keeping
interest rates high and thereby slowing the economy.
   The leading indicators index is heavily weighted toward
measuring manufacturing health. The service economy, such as health
care and education, generally are regarded as healthy.
   Three of the 11 forward-looking statistics provided positive
contributions to the index, including a big increase in building
permits.
   But Peach, the Mortgage Bankers' economist, said the
``transitory'' gain in permits was concentrated in the multifamily
sector. It was expected, he explained, because of extremely mild
weather and because of the rush by many builders to beat a deadline
for expensive new building standards.
   The standards, required by 1989 fair housing legislation, are
designed to make apartment buildings more accessible to the
handicapped.
   Also showing strength were slower business delivery times, since
that indicates strong demand for products, and an increase in the
backlog of manufacturers' unfilled orders.
   However, a decline in orders for consumer goods led the
statistics, providing a drag on the index.
   Other negatives were a drop in the money supply, a decline in
plant and equipment orders, lower stock prices, a decrease in the
price of raw materials, a drop in an index measuring consumer
confidence and an increase in weekly unemployment claims.
   One indicator, the length of the average work week, was
unchanged.

<TEXT>
   A senior U.N. official Friday appealed for more
relief funds for war-torn Afghanistan, and urged Communist
authorities and Moslem rebels to set up non-combat zones to
encourage refugees to return home.
   Sadruddin Aga Khan, coordinator of the U.N. economic and
humanitarian assistance program for Afghanistan, said $88 million
in cash contributions was still needed to meet this year's planned
aid target of $650 million.
   He said that without additional cash contributions the United
Nations would find it difficult to make effective use of the
material and food aid donated to Afghanistan.
   He said the funds were also needed to continue a program that
already has trained 20,000 Afghans to detect and remove the vast
number of unexploded anti-personnel mines that were planted during
the country's long conflict.
   Non-cash assistance accounts for about 70 percent of the
international contributions to the U.N. program known as Operation
Salam, he said.
   Sadruddin said Operation Salam's 1990 program would concentrate
on agriculture, food and health assistance, as well as mine
clearance.
   He appealed to Kabul's ruling Communist government and the
Moslem rebels to reach agreement on the formal establishment of
non-combat zones which could absorb some of the estimated 5 million
Afghan refugees who fled their country after the Soviet invasion in
1979.
   Sadruddin said he would discuss U.N. plans to designate a number
of areas as so-called ``zones of tranquility'' when he visits
Afghanistan this month.
   In order to qualify as such a zone, an area must be peaceful and
local authorities must accept a U.N. presence, he said.
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Thorvald Stoltenberg,
is also due to travel to Kabul with Sadruddin.
   Despite last year's Soviet military withdrawal from Afghanistan
and the subsequent reduction in hostilities, only about 100,000
refugees are believed to have returned home, Sadruddin said.
   Some 3 million Afghans are estimated to remain in refugee camps
in Pakistan and another 2 million in Iran. They account for about
40 percent of the worldwide total of refugees, according to U.N.
figures.
   ``The refugees have spent their 11th winter in exile. We don't
want to see them spending another year away from their country,''
Sadruddin said.
   ``I am reasonably confident that with the necessary contribution
from the international community ... the number of returnees this
year could be quite substantial,'' he added.
   But he warned of a continuing exodus of Afghans into Iran to
escape chronic food shortages in northern provinces where last
year's harvest was ravaged by insects and disease.
   He said that despite efforts to assist the stricken areas, the
situation in the north could worsen without extra international
funds.

<TEXT>
   About 50 South American
Indians who converted to Judaism celebrated their first Sabbath in
this West Bank settlement Friday after immigrating from Peru.
   The tribe's move to the occupied lands comes at a time of
growing U.S. pressure on Israel to stop building or expanding
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and demands
that Israel not settle Soviet Jews in those areas.
   The Indians who call themselves the ``Sons of Moses'' became
interested in Judaism 40 years ago while living near the town of
Cajamarca in northern Peru, said Israeli Rabbi Eliahu Aviahil.
   Two tribal elders began studying the Old Testament at the time,
and about 20 years later the whole tribe abandoned Christianity and
began living a Jewish lifestyle, the rabbi said on Israel radio.
   Aviahil said he learned of the Indians three years ago and
initiated their formal conversion and immigration.
   The tribe's men underwent ritual circumcision before everyone in
the group was converted six months ago by a special rabbinical
court according to Orthodox Jewish law.
   Aviahil heads Amishav, a society that researches Judaism's 10
lost tribes which according to legend disappeared after the exile
of the Jews to Babylonia in 722 B.C. The Israeli newspaper Hadashot
quoted the rabbi as saying the Peruvians were descendants of one of
the lost tribes, but did not elaborate.
   The Indians arrived in Israel late Wednesday night and were
greeted by Elon Moreh settlers who drove them in a convoy of trucks
Thursday to their new home, the daily Maariv reported.
   Elon Moreh, home to some 500 observant Jewish settlers, is
located on a windswept and rocky mountaintop four miles from
Nablus, the West Bank's largest city and a hotbed of anti-Israeli
violence. Elon Moreh is reputed to be the site where the biblical
patriarch Abraham first entered Canaan.
   Aviahil said the new immigrants asked to settle in Elon Moreh
because if its religious atmosphere. ``They asked and they are
happy to live in a religious settlement like Elon Moreh,'' the
rabbi said.
   The settlers turned away journalists Friday, saying they wanted
to give the new immigrants some privacy before allowing interviews.
   Elon Moreh settlers, meanwhile, were preparing for the Jewish
Sabbath which begins at sundown Friday with the lighting of candles
and a special blessing said before the evening meal.
   Settler Shoshi Ilan, who is in charge of the new immigrants,
told The Associated Press the tribe consisted of about 15 families
and they would live in houses that have been vacant for some time.
   ``We worked very hard to get them here and don't want anyone to
bother them,'' Mrs. Ilan said. She said some of the Indians spoke
Hebrew and that all would take language classes in the settlement.
   Another settler, who would not give his name, said the new
arrivals ``are not Indians, but Jews in every way.''
   Aviahil said the Peruvians were aware of the Palestinian
uprising that has been raging in the occupied lands since December
1987. ``They are ready for it,'' he said. ``They want to fulfill
the commandment of living in the Land of Israel (Eretz Israel),''
the rabbi said. The Hebrew phrase ``Eretz Israel'' is a reference
to the biblical land of Israel that also includes the West Bank.
   Two Elon Moreh children have been killed since 1987, including
15-year-old Tirza Porat who was inadvertently shot by a Jewish
settler guard firing wildly during a confrontation with Palestinian
villagers. In the second case, 8-year-old Rami Chaban was found
slain near Elon Moreh, and settlers blamed Palestinians.
   Aviahil, meanwhile, said the Peruvian Indians were not a unique
case, and that other communities around the world were adopting a
Jewish way of life.
   ``There is an interesting phenomena today in Latin America where
many Christians leave their religion and turn to the Old Testament,
and some of them become Jews,'' he said. ``Judaism today is a
magnet for people seeking the truth.''

   The Navy's inquiry into the USS Iowa disaster
failed to prove its contention that Gunner's Mate Clayton Hartwig
probably set off the explosion that killed himself and 46 other
crewmen, a congressional panel said today.
   ``By the standards of this subcommittee _ and the standards that
we think should have been applied in the Navy's investigation _
there is only a hypothesis, and a tenuous one at that,'' said the
report by the House Armed Services investigations subcommittee.
   The Navy, in its report on the blast, concluded that Hartwig
``most likely'' caused the explosion by inserting some type of
detonator between bags of gunpowder in one of the ship's 16-inch
guns.
   Navy officials did acknowledge that their evidence was
circumstantial in light of the fact that all the witnesses,
including Hartwig, were killed in the blast in the battleship's gun
turret No. 2.
   Navy spokesman Cmdr. Mark Baker, asked about the panel's
criticism, responded, ``We stand by our original report.''
   The panel found fault with four aspects of the Navy's
investigation into the April 19, 1989, explosion as the battleship
sailed near Puerto Rico.
   Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman,
said the flaws were the structure of the probe, the technical
tests, police work and psychological analysis.
   ``First, the Navy convened a one-man investigation without the
use of formal hearings,'' Mavroules said in a statement
accompanying the report. ``If the Navy had convened a board of
several members operating through formal hearings, the theories and
hypotheses that evolved would have faced more rigorous questioning.
   ``Instead, there was an excess of certitude,'' he said.
   On the technical inquiry, Mavroules said that when Navy
investigators were told that Hartwig owned a timing device, the
tests ``proved'' that a timer was used to trigger the blast.
   Later, he said, when the timer information proved to be false,
the technical tests ``suddenly found a chemical detonator to be the
logical igniter.''
   Mavroules also criticized FBI psychologists who took part in the
investigation, calling their analysis the ``real villain of this
case.''
   Last December, three FBI psychologists testified that Hartwig _
based on his letters, interviews with the seaman's family and
friends and his personal history _ was ``egocentric, shy ... not
sufficiently aggressive, had a low self-esteem.''
   The psychologists cited various bits of information that when
pieced together, according to their assessment, form a picture of
an individual bent on self-destruction.
   Mavroules said the FBI analysis was used as a substitute for a
thorough investigation.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the full Armed Services
Committee, said the Navy probe ``leaves us with something of a bad
taste in our mouths.''
   ``We are concluding that the Navy hasn't definitely found the
culprit. But we haven't found the culprit ourselves,'' Aspin said.
``Yet, I don't think reopening the original investigation will get
us anywhere.''

<HEAD>Non-Official Exchanges Surge While War of Words Continues</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Official efforts to mend U.S.-China relations
appear to have stalled, but recent days have seen a surge in
people-to-people exchanges despite the still-intense political war
of words.
   The same week that saw daily Chinese expressions of outrage over
a critical U.S. State Department human rights report also saw the
arrival of more unofficial American delegations at one time than
any other week since June.
   That was when the Chinese army opened fire on crowds protesting
in Beijing for democratic reform, killing hundreds and possibly
thousands. Hundreds of bilateral programs for exchanging students,
scholars, artists and scientists ground to a halt.
   This week it was almost like old times.
   First, a team of 17 Americans arrived to climb Mount Everest,
the world's highest peak, together with Chinese and Soviet
mountaineers.
   Then, a dozen delegates from five states arrived to explore
trade and investment opportunities.
   A dozen more came with the National Committee for U.S.-China
Relations for three days of talks with Chinese scholars and
policy-makers on topics from the global environment to bilateral
ties to the problem of Chinese students staying in the United
States.
   The biggest group of all, nearly two dozen people from
Washington state, reached agreement to hold a huge economic and
trade seminar in Seattle in October, complete with a Chinese food
fair, a business exhibit and Chinese acrobats.
   The organizer, Norman Swanson of People to People's Citizen
Ambassador Program, said as many as 500 Chinese might attend,
making it their largest delegation ever to the United States in the
11 years since relations were normalized.
   The week ended with U.S. Industrialist Armand Hammer, chairman
of Occidental Petroleum, appearing on Chinese TV with President
Yang Shangkun to express his willingness to invest more money in
China. Occidental already has invested $200 million in a Chinese
coal mine.
   David Lampton, president of the National Committee on
U.S.-Chinese Relations, said individual U.S. Scholars also are
coming back for short periods to renew contacts and research
projects.
   ``There are whole areas of exchange that we probably won't
engage in at the moment,'' Lampton said. ``I don't want this to be
construed as business as usual.''
   But he said groups such as the committee, which sponsors a range
of scholarly and other non-official exchanges, oppose shutting down
contacts during times of political strife.
   He said the committee's symposium with the Chinese People's
Institute of Foreign Affairs was the fourth in a periodic series of
such meetings planned ``to build close personal relations so that
when times get bad there will be a fabric of relations.''
   Although the U.S. report critical of human rights abuses in
China prompted an angry Chinese response, China made no move to
halt any of these or other planned unofficial exchanges, as it did
several times in the early 1980s when governmental relations
deteriorated.
   Nor, by week's end, had China tightened surveillance around U.S.
Embassy compounds or otherwise put pressure on American diplomats,
as it did in the months after June. The downward spiral in
government relations may coast to a halt, Lampton said _ but there
are no prospects for improvement, either.
   ``Both sets of leaders think that any further compromise is
going to be very costly in terms of their domestic position,'' he
said, stressing that he did not speak for the committee.
   The United States sent National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft, resumed government trade credits and approved airplane
and satellite sales. China lifted martial law, released a small
portion of arrested protesters and agreed to resume Fulbright
scholarly exchanges.
   ``Each believes that the other must take the next step,''
Lampton said. But he said he found no evidence that any significant
faction of Chinese leaders want to reduce or cut bilateral ties.
   ``I see a deadlock of indefinite length,'' he said.

   Joseph Hazelwood got the flu today,
stopping his trial at a point where the defense was trying to
puncture an expert witness' claim the Exxon Valdez skipper
recklessly tried to refloat his grounded tanker.
   ``It seems we're missing the star player _ Captain Hazelwood has
the flu,'' attorney Dick Madson told Superior Court Judge Karl
Johnstone.
   The judge canceled today's session and ordered jurors to be
especially careful about avoiding publicity about the case during
their long weekend recess. Lawyers said Hazelwood should be ready
to resume Monday.
   William Milwee Jr., a marine salvage consultant, remained
adamant Thursday as attorney Michael Chalos challenged his
assertions that Hazelwood risked losing his tanker and the lives of
his crew when he ordered the ship forward after it hit a reef.
   But the witness also agreed that in a grounding, the captain's
first instinct would be to get his ship afloat.
   Chalos suggested the ship's engines did not have enough
horsepower to extricate the massive tanker from the reef.
   ``There is absolutely no question this ship would not have moved
using its engines alone,'' said Milwee.
   ``No matter what Captain Hazelwood did?'' asked Chalos.
   ``No matter what Captain Hazelwood did,'' responded the witness.
``But Captain Hazelwood did nothing to try and determine that.''
   Repeatedly, Milwee insisted that Hazelwood should have had more
information before he attempted any maneuver in the wake of the
grounding.
   The retired Navy salvage expert said a captain should take
soundings, by dropping a piece of lead with a line attached to it
over the side, to ascertain how deep the water is and how the
vessel is grounded.
   But he acknowledged that soundings might have been inaccurate in
water thick with oozing oil.
   The 987-foot tanker spilled nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska
crude in little more than an hour after it ran aground in Prince
William Sound on March 24. It was the nation's worst oil spill,
killing countless birds, fish and other wildlife and blackening
hundreds of miles of rocky shoreline.
   The prosecution claims that Hazelwood's actions after the ship
hit jagged Bligh Reef worsened the problem and risked more damage
to the tanker.
   The 43-year-old skipper from Huntington, N.Y., is charged with
criminal mischief, reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while
intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil. He could receive 7\
years in prison and fines of $61,000.
   Milwee, the third expert witness for the prosecution this week,
said he has a $25,000 contract with the state for his work on the
case.
   Chalos confronted Milwee with a book on seamanship containing 14
points of advice for the skipper of a grounded vessel.
   As Chalos read off the points, Milwee acknowledged that
Hazelwood followed almost all the recommended procedures, including
alerting the engine room, lowering lifeboats, sending a distress
message and remaining calm.
   On each of those points, Chalos asked him: ``Was that a correct
action?''
   ``Correct action,'' answered the witness.
   ``A good action?'' asked the attorney.
   ``Good action,'' said the witness.
   But Milwee faulted Hazelwood on two points: failing to sound a
general alarm to wake the crew and not taking soundings before
activating the engines.
   ``You shouldn't attempt to move a ship in any way until you have
knowledge of the water that lies around it,'' he said.
   Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole asked how certain a
captain should be of a situation before he attempts refloating.
   ``Dead certain,'' said the witness.
   As far as Hazelwood's failure to sound a general alarm, other
officers have said the skipper didn't want to incite panic among
the crew members, most of whom were asleep. Milwee ridiculed that
reasoning.
   ``I can't imagine a crew that sounding the general alarm is
going to panic,'' the witness said. ``If it does, they're not much
of a crew.''

<TEXT>
   Battle plans were drawn Friday as
this spring break mecca prepared for the annual invasion of 400,000
college students that's worth perhaps $1 billion to the region.
   ``Party Smart'' is the theme this year as community leaders
attempt to try to tone down the free-for-all party that has
accompanied the annual rites of spring here in recent years.
   ``Be smart, be legal or be caught,'' said Ty Wilson, vice
chairman of the Spring Break Festival Task Force, a committee
formed after severe problems developed last year, when police made
1,200 alcohol-related arrests.
   ``It's going to be a great spring break,'' chairman Ray Eddy
said as last-minute preparations were discussed. ``The message is
that the students are welcome.''
   Concerts, sports events, beauty pageants are among the planned
promotions.
   The task force has created 1,000 new parking spaces near the
beach, will install more than 100 portable toilets and has more
carefully scheduled events to lessen the impact of the crowds. Laws
also will be more strictly enforced.
   Many residents complained last year that traffic was at a
virtual standstill and students were urinating in public and
passing out drunk.
   The task force was created to solve some of those problems and
to make students welcome because of the tremendous economic impact.
   Chamber of Commerce officials estimate students will spend $120
million from early March through mid-April. The first group of
20,000 students arrived this week just as 240,000 ``bikers''
arrived for motorcycle races at Daytona International Speedway.
   By using a multiplier, officials estimate spring break has
almost a $1 billion impact on the area's economy.
   Daytona Beach became the nation's spring break capital about
three years ago after Fort Lauderdale tightened law enforcement,
signaling that students weren't welcome. Gulf Coast beaches are
expecting some of the overflow from Daytona Beach.
   The Daytona Beach police department and the Volusia County Beach
Patrol are pledging more stringent enforcement of drinking laws.
   ``We're proud of spring break, but it has to be managed
better,'' said Police Chief Paul Crow. ``It will be a much more
organized event.''
   Contrary to percepitions, Crow said, ``Our problems haven't been
with the college kids.''
   About two-thirds of last year's arrests were Florida youngsters,
many of them underage high school students.
   ``We have to deal with the day trippers,'' he said.
   This year, Crow said exits to Daytona Beach off Interstate 95
will be closed when the beach is full to prevent gridlock.
   ``We are going to close the gate,'' Crow said.
   Volusia County Beach Patrol chief John Kirvan, whose agency is
responsible for law enforcement on the beach, said his officers
will take ``a no-nonsense approach to drinking and rowdyism.''
   ``We hope they have a good time, but we are going to enforce the
laws,'' Kirvan said.

   Twenty-one crewmembers of a South Korean fishing
were rescued Friday after their boat sank in the South China Sea,
but their captain still was missing, Japan's Maritime Safety Agency
said.
   Another South Korean vessel found the crew floating in a life
raft, agency officials said. The officials believe that the
captain, taking responsibility for the accident, decided to go down
with his ship.
   The 100-ton fishing boat Hanaho sank Thursday afternoon about
300 miles west-northwest of Naha in Japan's southernmost prefecture
of Okinawa.
   Japanese officials said the cause of the accident was unknown
but said it was believed the Hanaho was hit by large waves.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal authorities have taken over two Bronx
apartment buildings described as ``veritable `Macy's' of crack
sales.''
   An affidavit supporting Thursday's seizures said drug dealers
who worked out of the buildings terrorized the neighborhood,
including a nearby drug rehabilitation center.
   The affidavit said numerous gunshots were fired at the center
and that on one occasion, a resident barely missed being hit by a
bullet. It also alleged that dealers frequently surrounded the
rehab center and taunted the recovering addicts by dangling vials
of crack through the fence.
   The seizures were announced by U.S. Attorney Otto G. Obermaier,
whose office brought the action, and Bronx District Attorney Robert
T. Johnson, who investigated the drug activity.
   They said more than 150 drug arrests had been made in the past
14 months at the two six-story, 53-unit apartment buildings, where
police officers had observed up to 100 people lining up outside to
buy drugs.
   The seizures were made under a provision of the federal
narcotics law that allows the government to take over property
known to be the site of drug activity.
   The buildings' owner was identified as John Dino and his Phelan
Corp. in Queens. Authorities charged that Dino had not taken
reasonable action to rid the buildings of drug traffickers and to
make the building safe for legitimate tenants who occupied a small
percentage of the apartments.
   Efforts to get comment from Dino were unsuccessful because there
were no telephone listings for him or his company.
   The affidavit said as many as 10 different drug organizations
used the buildings as ``veritable `Macy's' of crack sales, with
selling occurring on the street, in the lobby, in the stairwells
and in apartment doorways.''
   Authorities said 19 people were arrested on drug charges during
the seizures Thursday. The other tenants _ no exact number was
available _ were allowed to stay in their apartments, said Deborah
Corley, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office.

   ABC said Friday it is putting four new series on
its spring schedule and taking two others off temporarily. Those
two, ``China Beach'' and ``Anything But Love,'' will go on a
production hiatus.
   Three of the new series, including ``Twin Peaks,'' are one-hour
shows. Each will have a two-hour premiere before the start of its
regular weekly run.
   ``Twin Peaks,'' a dark-humor series set in a small town in the
Northwest, will begin in its regular Thursday time period on April

   ``Riders'' will move to Monday on April 16, joined then by the
new ``Capitol News,'' a one-hour series set in a newspaper in
Washington, D.C. The mid-season switch will end ABC's usual Monday
movie fare this season.
   ``Equal Justice,'' the third new one-hour series, is a drama set
in the office of a big-city district attorney. It will debut in its
regular Wednesday time period on March 28, displacing ``China
Beach.''
   ABC's fourth new show, a situation comedy called ``The Marshall
Chronicles,'' is about teen-age life. It will premiere in its
regular Wednesday time period on April 4, displacing ``Anything But
Love.''

<HEAD>New Home Sales at Lowest Level in Nearly a Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of new homes fell 7.1 percent in January
to their lowest level in nearly a year, the government said Friday,
surprising analysts who had expected a rebound from a steep plunge
in December.
   The Commerce Department said new, single-family homes were sold
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 589,000 units in January,
the worst performance since sales had fallen to 556,000 homes on an
annual basis last March.
   ``Frankly, it's a bit of a surprise,'' said David Seiders, chief
economist for the National Association of Home Builders. ``I
thought the weather would give us at least as good a month as
December.''
   Sales in December totaled 634,000 units, down 8.4 percent from
November.
   January sales also were down from the 704,000 units purchased in
January 1989, and marked an ominous start for the new year. Despite
the healthy pace at the beginning of 1989, the year itself ended on
a slack note, with sales down 3.8 percent from 1988 to the lowest
level since 1984.
   John A. Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association
of Realtors, attributed the January decline to a rise in mortgage
rates, which he expects to taper off in the spring.
   Tuccillo also blamed rates, as well as a usual January buying
lull, for a 2.2 percent drop in existing home sales in January.
   Interest rates rose, on average, from 9.83 percent to 10.05
percent in January, according to surveys by the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. Rates continued to rise last month, reaching 10.31
percent by Feb. 23 before dropping to 10.23 percent Friday.
   But Richard Peach, deputy chief economist for the Mortgage
Bankers Association, said rising rates often boost sales because
buyers want to lock in on loans before mortgage costs go up even
more.
   The housing industry slowed dramatically early in 1989 as the
Federal Reserve sought to contain inflation by keeping interest
rates high and thereby slowing the economy. Mortgage rates fell
during the summer, spurring sales, but moved back into the
double-digit range in January.
   Seiders said a recent survey by the Home Builders found 50
percent of its members offering incentives to offset the industry
weakness. They include optional equipment at no extra cost and
builder payment of closing costs.
   ``It doesn't seem to have worked,'' he admitted.
   In its report, the Commerce Department said the median price of
a new home continued to climb in January, rising 1.4 percent to
$127,000. The median means half of the homes cost more, half less.
   On the other hand, the average price of a new home in January
fell 2.9 percent to $152,600.
   The South suffered the largest sales drop, down 18.9 percent to
202,000 units at an annual rate. Sales in the West were off 5.9
percent to 190,000 units.
   But sales in the Northeast, where housing activity had been
slow, rose 13.5 percent to 109,000 units. Sales also rose in the
Midwest, up 1.1 percent to 88,000 homes at an annual rate.

<TEXT>
   A 10-member U.S. congressional
delegation met President F.W. de Klerk and anti-apartheid leaders
Friday to assess the rapidly changing political climate in South
Africa.
   The delegation, led by Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., described the
talks with de Klerk and other government leaders as ``candid'' but
made no substantive statements.
   The lawmakers met Friday night with members of anti-apartheid
United Democratic Front. More meetings were planned for the weekend.
   The bipartisan group arrived Friday in South Africa after talks
in Zambia with the African National Congress, the main black group
fighting the white-run government.
   The ANC urged the congressmen to keep in place the limited U.S.
sanctions against South Africa as a means of putting pressure on
the government.
   President Bush has said he would consider lifting the sanctions
if de Klerk continues with reforms aimed at negotiating a new
constitution that would include the 28 million-member black
majority.
   Last month de Klerk legalized more than 60 opposition groups,
including the ANC, and freed ANC leader Nelson Mandela.
   The U.S. delegation includes: Howard Wolpe, D-Mich.; Dean Gallo,
R-N.J.; Steny Hoyer, D-Md.; Ron Dellums, D-Calif.; Steven Solarz,
D-N.Y.; Mike Andrews, D-Texas; Beverly Byron, D-Md.; Victor Fazio,

   President Bush said today the glamorization
of drug use in popular culture is ``fading fast'' and urged
television producers to show how illegal drugs destroy lives.
   Bush's anti-drug speech was interrupted when a man in the
ballroom audience of TV industry members leaped up and shouted,
``Why don't you ever talk about AIDS? Why don't you lead the
country on AIDS?''
   Bush, smiling slightly, stopped speaking and looked at the man
as he continued shouting from his table and was joined by a second
protester.
   Some in the audience shouted for them to sit down, and the two
submitted to hotel security people who briskly led them from the
room. As they left, Bush said his administration has increased
federal funds ``to an all time high,'' for AIDS programs ``to try
to help people who are concerned, and we will continue.''
   He then said, ``I've come a long way in my own political
maturity. This guy's intervention doesn't bother me one little bit
and I'm glad we live in a country where we can all speak up even if
it takes advantage of the hospitality of you all.''
   Bush's speech to the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences
came a day after he urged business people to screen job applicants
for drug use.
   He called on the academy to make TV ``a force for positive
change'' through anti-drug education.
   The president praised an upcoming cartoon program called
``Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue,'' in which several cartoon
producers collaborated on a story about a boy who says no to drugs.
   ``Never before in cartoon history have Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck
worked with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Muppets, the
Smurfs and all the other stars of the cartoon world,'' Bush told a
breakfast meeting of the academy before heading to Santa Ana for an
anti-drug rally.

   Bush said people around the country ``in thousands of towns are
standing up to make the same courageous choice: drug-free
neighborhoods, drug-free schools, drug-free kids.''
   ``We have seen some scattered but hopeful new signs of progress
against the horror of drugs,'' Bush said in remarks for the Santa
Ana rally, recounting examples of communities that banded together
to drive out drug pushers.
   ``The days of the drug lords may not be over yet but their days
are numbered,'' he said.

   ``Thank goodness the days when popular culture glorified and
glamorized drug use are fading fast,'' Bush said.
   ``I'm not asking you to compromise your art'' by portraying ``a
fantasy world where drugs don't exist,'' he told the elevision
academy members. Rather, he said, he was entreating them ``to show
in the real world how drugs destroy.''
   On Thursday night, Bush called on business leaders at a
California Chamber of Commerce dinner to ``help us turn the tables
against the dealers, turn them forever.''
   ``So-called casual users and their money keep these merchants of
death in business,'' he said.
   ``America now condemns what has too long been condoned. The
country has had enough,'' he declared.
   Noting that many businesses already conduct pre-employment drug
screening, Bush told the group: ``We need to make it very clear, to
every American, that if you do drugs, you don't get hired.''
   He said every city should have a safe house on each block where
youths can go for help, information about drugs and ``refuge from
dealers.''
   Bush later was flying to Palm Springs where he invited Kaifu for
a round of talks focusing mainly on trade issues that have left the
United States with a $49 billion trade deficit with Japan.
   Bush told former President Reagan about his upcoming meeting
when he paid a courtesy call Thursday in Los Angeles.
   ``It's going to be an interesting meeting. I've mentioned we've
got to move forward on some of the tough problems we have,'' Bush
said.
   The president told the Chamber of Commerce gala on Thursday
night his meeting with Kaifu would entail ``very important
business.''
   He said it was fitting that he will see the prime minister in
California, a reference to the state's interest in U.S.-Japan
relations because of the many areas of industrial competition,
including autos, agriculture and electronics.
   Kaifu said on the eve of his visit that he hoped to convince
Bush that Japan is making progress in opening its markets and
cutting its trade surplus with the United States.

   Rival Christian forces battled room to
room in a high-rise building Friday as Gen. Michel Aoun's troops
surged toward the waterfront for control of Lebanon's crumbling
Christian enclave.
   Outside, as the city shook from artillery exchanges, Maronite
Patriarch Nasrallah Butros Sfeir threatened to excommunicate Aoun
and Samir Geagea of the Lebanese Forces militia if they continued
fighting.
   Sfeir urged both commanders to ``have mercy on the population
and observe a cease-fire immediately.''
   ``Whoever gives the order to shoot and whoever obeys such orders
will be excommunicated,'' Sfeir warned, including their troops in
the threat. Geagea's militia has 6,000 members; Aoun commands
19,000 men.
   Shortly after Sfeir's appeal, Aoun said he ordered his forces to
observe a cease-fire. Fighting continued all day, although the
intensity of the artillery duels decreased noticeably, police said.
Smoke billowed from the contested neighborhoods in the
310-square-mile enclave.
   A casualty figure was not available from the fierce clashes in
the low-income residential districts of Nabaa and Sin el-Fil,
strongholds for Geagea's militia. At least 46 people were killed
and 77 wounded overnight.
   Aoun appeared to be trying to take the neighborhoods in a drive
toward Beirut port to cut off Geagea's headquarters from a key
stronghold. Aoun's U.S.-made tanks fired at close range at
apartments, cars and ``anything that faces them,'' the police
spokesman said.
   ``They are applying scorched earth combat tactics. The whole
district is on fire,'' the spokesman said.
   Police said Aoun's troops fought the militiamen from room to
room for control of the 12-story Shalouhi building that commands
the street linking the embattled districts with the seaside
boulevard.
   A spokesman said the strategic building repeatedly changed hands
throughout the day. It was occupied by Aoun's commandos in a swift
attack at first light, said the spokesman, who cannot be identified
in line with regulations.
   Geagea's men, he said, launched a counteroffensive about 10 a.m.
and regained control of the building.
   The army attacked again at noon ``and the battles have been
going on inside the building. Both forces are there,'' the
spokesman said.
   The building housed the offices of a number of foreign
corporations and prominent Lebanese firms. These included The
American Express bank, the Dutch airline KLM and the Reuters news
agency. Reuters has another office in west Beirut.
   Lebanese couturier Choueiter, who has a shop in Paris, had his
east Beirut offices in the building. Most clients evacuated in the
early days of the battle when the neighborhood was first shelled,
starting a fire on the building's ninth floor.
   Syrian-backed President Elias Hrawi said his government, based
in Moslem west Beirut, ``would intervene in the proper time'' to
end the bloodshed, which has killed 754 people and wounded 2,061
since it broke out Jan. 30.
   Hrawi, addressing a news conference at his temporary residence,
said he soon will tour Arab nations to enlist support for plans to
halt the Christian battle.
   He urged Aoun's men to join Gen. Emile Lahoud, appointed by
Hrawi to replace Aoun as commander of the armed forces a few hours
after he was elected president Nov. 24.
   Aoun, Geagea, Hrawi and Lahoud are Maronites, the Catholic
community that has dominated Lebanon since independence from France
in 1943.
   Hrawi also sharply attacked a mediation effort by the Palestine
Liberation Organization, saying, ``They have come to rescue us
after they caused our war. They started Lebanon's tragedy. ... We
don't need their advice.''
   He was referring to the nearly 15-year-old civil war which
started as a clash between Arafat's guerrillas and the Christians
in April 1975.
   Aoun has rejected parliament's election last fall of Hrawi, who
has pledged to enact a peace pact. Aoun says he opposes the peace
plan because it does not require the pullout of 40,000 Syrian
troops, deployed under a 1976 Arab League mandate to keep the peace
in the civil war.
   Hrawi fired Aoun as army commander, but Aoun refused to step
down.

   Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile announced from
jail Friday that he intends to run for president in 1992 if he is
cleared of criminal charges related to the December coup attempt
against Corazon Aquino.
   Enrile has been in custody since Tuesday, when he was charged
with ``rebellion with murder'' in connection with the sixth and
most serious attempt to overthrow President Aquino.
   He said he will accept the presidential challenge if the
opposition Nationalista Party, of which he is the
secretary-general, nominates him, and if he is acquitted of the
charges.
   Mrs. Aquino's popularity remains high among many Filipinos, but
the constitution bars the president from seeking a second term.
   Also Friday, hotel owner Rebecco Panlilio and his wife Erlinda,
who were charged Tuesday with Enrile, surrendered to the National
Bureau of Investigation, officials said.
   Enrile and the Panlilio couple were among seven people so far
indicted in the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt.
   One of the seven, who remains at large, is cashiered Lt. Col.
Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, Enrile's former chief security aide
who led an August 1987 mutiny against Mrs. Aquino.
   The Panlilios were allegedly at Enrile's home on Dec. 1, when
witnesses claimed they saw Honasan and about 100 rebel soldiers
also at the senator's residence. Enrile claims he has not seen
Honasan since 1987.
   Enrile was defense minister under President Ferdinand Marcos but
turned against the autocratic ruler in February 1986 in the
military mutiny that swept Mrs. Aquino to power. He was fired as
defense minister in November 1986, after his followers tried to
oust Mrs. Aquino.
   The Supreme Court has set a hearing Tuesday on a petition by
Enrile's lawyers questioning the legality of the charges. Enrile
says they were filed to punish him for opposing Mrs. Aquino.
   The high tribunal also ordered government lawyers to answer
within 10 days the Panlilio couple's petition challenging the
validity of the charges against them.
   Meanwhile, about 300 supporters of Mrs. Aquino picketed the
Senate on Friday protesting ``special treatment'' they say is being
considered for Enrile.
   Senators have been debating since Wednesday a proposal to ask
the court to put Enrile under the custody of the Senate's
sergeant-at-arms so he could attend sessions.
   Enrile's lawyers said they will ask the court handling the
charges to delay a scheduled arraignment Monday pending a decision
on the petition for freedom.
   Under the law, rebellion is punishable by up to 12 years
imprisonment, and murder carries a maximum sentence of life in
prison.
   About 3,000 mutinous troops, many of them from the army's elite
Scout Ranger Regiment, launched the December coup attempt in which
at least 113 people were killed and more than 600 injured.

   The mother of a toddler who died after
repeatedly being dunked headfirst into a toilet struck a deal with
prosecutors today, pleading no contest to a second-degree murder
charge.
   Under the plea accepted by Circuit Judge Dale Durrance, Sheryl
McGee Coe, 21, will face no more than 30 years in prison for her
role in the July 28 death of 2-year-old Bradley McGee.
   The Lakeland woman had been charged with first-degree murder and
aggravated child abuse charges, which could have brought a life
prison term.
   Her husband Thomas Edward Coe, 22, faces trial on the same
charges this summer in Fort Lauderdale, and prosecutors have said
they intend to seek the death penalty.
   Bradley died July 28 after he was dunked head first into a
toilet for soiling his pants, authorities charge. The toddler had
spent most of his life in foster care after he was abandoned at a
Lakeland mall.
   The boy's death prompted an indictment against four state social
workers and a special legislative session to boost state spending
for child protective services.
   Charges have been dismissed against one social worker, and a
second won an acquittal Tuesday when a Polk County judge threw out
a misdemeanor charge.
   Kenneth Houk, the acquitted 18-year veteran of the state
Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, called the whole
experience a nightmare.
   ``I kept thinking I was going to wake up and never did,'' Houk
said Thursday. ``Children are sacred to me. ... They have always
been and they will continue to be _ Bradley McGee or any child.''
   The pain of the boy's death and the criminal charge haunted
Houk. He said he lost 23 pounds and was bothered by nausea and bad
dreams.
   Houk was an administrator in the division supervising Bradley
when the toddler died. Houk voluntarily took a demotion and now
finds jobs for single mothers.

<HEAD>Communist Leader Excludes Return to One-Party Rule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Communist Party leader declared
Friday that his party now supported democracy and opposed any
attempts to restore its former monopoly on power.
   Communist Party First Secretary Vasil Mohorita said the party
was willing to play the role of a constructive opposition if, as
expected, it loses in free elections scheduled for June 8.
   ``Our main priority is to convince the people that we do not
wish a return to the old days, not to win the elections,'' said
Mohorita, who became first secretary after the party's hard-line
leadership was ousted during last year's democratic revolution.
   ``A return to the thesis of one-party rule must not be allowed,
this monopoly on power must be prevented,'' he added.
   After 41 years of orthodox, one-party Communist rule,
Czechoslovakia underwent a peaceful revolution last November and
December that introduced political pluralism.
   Mohorita said the communists should not be concerned about
winning the elections, but rather must convince Czechoslovaks that
they now support democracy.
   ``We have to show the people that we have been participating in
these (democratization) processes from the beginning, and if we
have to be in opposition, it will be a constructive one,'' he said.
   Despite losing its hold on power, the Communist Party still has
some 1 million members ``or maybe a little less,'' Mohorita said.
   The party claimed 1.7 million members before the start of last
year's revolution. Some 1.3 million of those people joined the
party after the purge of half a million members that followed the
1968 Soviet-led invasion that crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reform
movement.
   Mohorita indicated that party members who do not support the new
pro-democracy policy would be dropped from the ranks.
   He admitted that an unspecified number of party members still
favor orthodox one-party rule, but stressed that ``we have to part
with these people.''
   Mohorita said there was a need for ``deep, critical but very
serious analysis'' of the past four decades of communist rule, but
he complained of what he called increasingly sharp attacks against
the party in the media it once controlled.
   A career Communist official, Mohorita led the state-controlled
Socialist Youth Union until tumultuous changes in the party
propelled him into the position of first secretary in December. At
the same time, Ladislav Adamec was named chairman of the party.

   Before carrying out President Bush's proposal
for a base on the Moon and a manned mission to Mars, the space
agency needs to study new technologies and eliminate ``unacceptable
risks to the crew,'' the National Research Council said Friday.
   In a report requested by Vice President Dan Quayle, the council
said the exploration plan by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration ``addresses a reasonable set of technological and
strategic approaches, but not all of the technically credible
approaches have been analyzed.''
   The council, an arm of the congressionally chartered National
Academy of Sciences, also said:
   _Operation of a U.S. space station by the late 1990's as
scheduled is a ``reasonable assumption,'' but present plans for the
station are not adequate for a Moon-Mars mission. The station ``may
not be the most appropriate staging base for the Moon and Mars,''
or, two stations may be needed.
   _Nuclear power ``eventually will be essential'' for the Moon and
Mars bases. Also, nuclear propulsion of spacecraft, included by
NASA as an option, should be tested. ``The use of nuclear
technology in space faces formidable barriers of public acceptance,
however, especially if employed in Earth orbit. Therefore, issues
of safety are paramount in research and development.''
   _Although the NASA proposals envision bases on Mars ``it appears
that a station in Mars orbit requires a less demanding
infrastructure than a surface base and might serve a useful purpose
in the early stages of human space exploration.''
   _Possiblities for international cooperation should be explored
because breakthroughs have been made in Europe, Japan and elsewhere
and ``most importantly, the USSR has substantial relevant
capability, demonstrated continued inerest in Mars, and an apparent
strong desire for cooperation with the U.S. in Mars exploration.''
   The council's study, made by a 14-member committee named in
January, said it was vital to the Moon-Mars mission that the United
States have ``the capability to send humans into space, maintain
them in a physical condition that permits them to work
productively, and return them to Earth in good health.''
   However, it added, ``it has not been demonstrated after
long-duration spaceflight individuals can readjust rapidly to
gravity without serious physiological consequences.''
   It said research into this problem was ``critical'' to the
design of the bases and vehicles. It said this should include study
of artificial gravity, not included by NASA in its list of critical
technologies for the mission.
   ``With the current state of knowledge, a multiyear exposure to
weightlessness, even with on-board exercise and countermeasures and
an intermediate stay on the surface of Mars, presents unacceptable
risks to the crew,'' the committee said.
   Bush announced a U.S. commitment for humans to return to the
Moon and journey to Mars in a speech last July 20, the 20th
anniversary of the 1969 moon landing.
   He asked Quayle, chairman of the National Space Council to come
up with recommendations for carrying out the initiative. NASA made
a 90-day study, and Quayle asked the National Research Council to
evaluate it.
   NASA Administrator Richard Truly said in a written statement
issued by the space agency's public affairs office, ``NASA is
pleased that, after careful consideration, the NRC panel found the
material developed in NASA's 90-day study accurate and appropriate
to the human exploration initiative at this stage in its
development.''
   David Beckwith, the vice president's press secretary, said,
``It's a very interesting report, and we are pleased and grateful.''
   The council said costs of the program ``are uncertain _ and
likely to remain so for some time.''
   It said it appeared unlikely ``for technical and cost reasons''
that the space station could be built in time so that Americans
could reach Mars by 2011, as envisioned in the most ambitious NASA
plan. The other NASA option calls for exploration in 2018.
   The panel disagreed with the contention of scientists at the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory that humans could be placed
on Mars by the year 2000. It said that ``underestimates the many
practical and difficult engineering and operational challenges
involved.''

   Billy Joel says he didn't start the fire,
but he certainly helped fan one under Cloquet High School freshman
Kevin Shutes.
   Shutes correctly identified and described 116 of the 119 people,
places and events in Joel's hit song, ``We Didn't Light the Fire,''
in a trivia contest sponsored by the Carlton County Historical
Society.
   His reward included the $25 top prize, a year's membership in
the society, free pizzas, car washes and movie passes.
   ``I thought all the entrants really did a great job,'' said the
society's director Ellen Quinn, who organized the contest to help
broaden the students' knowledge of history.
   ``I was surprised by the amount of time they put in and how
complete their answers were,'' she said Thursday. Shutes ``had very
complete answers and even went into a little commentary.''
   Shutes described ``Woodstock,'' a word in the song, as ``a
massive rock 'n' roll orgy that involved 500,000 young people out
for a good time. They completely took over the area and indulged in
sex and drugs freely. The sanitary conditions were said to have
been disgusting.''
   He identified ``Studebaker'' as ``a short-lived product of the
car industry. A free pony was offered to consumers who purchased
the car.''
   For extra credit, Shutes noted singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, who
gets a mention in the song, was born Duluth and reared in Hibbing.
   The three references he stumbled on were: ``Sugar Ray,'' ``Pope
Paul,'' and ``Santayana.'' He incorrectly identified boxing
champion Sugar Ray Robinson as a baseball player; he confused Pope
Paul VI of Italy with John Paul II, as the first Polish pope, and
misidentified philospher George Santayana as the 1960s rock band
Santana.

   A woman who alleges she was sexually
assaulted by author Hunter S. Thompson admits she produced X-rated
movies in the 1970s. But she claims not to know where the ``gonzo''
journalist got the idea that she's now in the sex-aids trade.
   Gail M. Palmer-Slater of St. Clair, Mich., alleged she went to
Thompson's Woody Creek home on Feb. 21 to conduct a ``professional
interview'' because she idolized him, she said in an interview
Thursday with the Aspen Times Daily.
   She said when she refused to join him in his hot tub, he
allegedly punched her and grabbed her breast.
   Thompson, the author of ``Fear and Loathing on the Campaign
Trail,'' told the newspaper that Palmer-Slater ``was real drunk,
sloppy drunk'' and pressured him to have sex with her.
   ``I pushed her away from me,'' he said. ``She went backward and
one hand brushed her breast.''
   Thompson, who lives near Aspen, was arrested Monday on sex
assault and simple assault charges, and later freed on $2,000 bond.
He is expected to enter a plea at a March 13 hearing.
   He said Palmer-Slater came to his house to talk about a new
business venture.
   ``She wanted me to help her get publicity for her business,
which is women's lingerie and dildos,'' Thompson said.
   Thompson said he had seen porno videotapes of Slater made in the
mid-1970s, when she was in her 20s. Slater said she was a video and
film producer in the 1970s and that she sometimes appeared in the
productions.
   Jim Holliday, author of ``Only the Best,'' a history of the porn
film industry, said a woman named Gail Palmer produced and directed
porn films in the 1970s, including ``The Erotic Adventures of
Candy'' and ``Candy Goes to Hollywood'' in 1978.

<HEAD>Communist Leaders Meet March 11; May Drop Party Control of
Institutions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party Central Committee will meet
March 11 to consider new party rules that drop the requirement for
party officials to monitor administrators of virtually every
factory and institution, it was reported Friday.
   Communist Party leaders in February agreed to give up their
monopoly on power, and compete in a multiparty system. But
reformers say the change will be ineffective unless the party also
abolishes its committees in virtually every factory and institution
in the country.
   In a related decision, the ruling bureau of the Communist Party
of Lithuania decided to suspend the activities of party members in
the affairs of the Interior Ministry, KGB, customs, Ministry of
Justice, prosecutor's office, courts, and the economic inspection
department, the Interfax service of Radio Moscow reported.
   The Lithuanian Communists broke off from the national party in
December. They have led the way on a number of key reforms.
   The national party leaders also will prepare for the March 12
opening of the Congress of People's Deputies, which is expected to
approve the party's proposal for a more powerful presidency.
   Interfax said the Central Committee will return to its session
to nominate its candidate for president after the Congress passes
the appropriate constitutional amendments. Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev is expected to be elected to the post, probably by the
Congress during that same week.

   Actor William Shatner, who commanded the
starship Enterprise on the television show ``Star Trek'' to boldly
go where no man has gone before, took a stroll recently _ and got
lost.
   Jennifer Watson, an advertising copywriter for radio station
WSM, said Friday she gave Shatner a ride two months ago when he
showed up at the station, lost on foot after leaving his nearby
hotel for an appointment.
   She recalled driving the actor a mile from the station to the
studios of The Nashville Network cable station. She said Friday she
was embarrassed because her old car had a banana peel in it. She
has since traded her old car in for a newer model.
   Last week, she received an envelope with a letter inside on
Shatner's stationery. The letter said, ``For your new car...'' and
had a banana peel wrapped in plastic.
   Watson said the appreciative actor had apparently been alerted
about her new car by some of her friends at the station.
   ``I just kind of yelled,'' she said about her reaction to his
note. ``I ran up and down the hall yelling, `Look what I got.'''

   The city has a message for the mascot of a
restaurant called Lotta-Bull: it's no bull _ no bull.
   City officials say the restaurant that uses a strolling bull to
promote its carnivore-friendly menu is ranging beyond the limits of
the law.
   When the Lotta-Bull mascot _ actually a man in a $300 bull suit
_ roams through parking lots and waves to passing cars, code
enforcement officers say he violates Rockville's ban on outdoor
signs.
   Paul Tibolla, owner of Lotta-Bull, who often is the man inside
the suit, was unrepentant. ``When I send the bull out, business
goes up,'' he said.
   Tibolla received warnings from the city before being fined $75
last week.
   The city's 1984 sign ordinance, designed to curb the number of
signs on an already cluttered retail landscape, strictly forbids
``freestanding signs which have the shape in the form of any
person, animal, vegetable, product or animation of any of the
foregoing.''
   Lawyer Stanton Gildenhorn decided to take the bull by the horns
and advised Tibolla not to pay the fine and take the matter to
court.
   ``I couldn't conceive how any jurisdiction could bust this
bull,'' Gildenhorn said. The lawyer said he would argue in court
that Tibolla's use of the bull costume is an exercise of his First
Amendment rights.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Politicians Line Up To Confess Former Pot Use</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a remarkable mass mea culpa, Massachusetts
politicians are lining up to confess their past dalliance with
marijuana, an urge to repent that began when the attorney general
fessed up to using the demon weed.
   State Attorney General James Shannon, 37, went to the
``confessional'' first during a mid-week television interview,
where he was being queried about his tough stance on casual drug
users. Within 24 hours, more politicians lined up at the booth.
   Allegations of drug use may have locked federal appeals Judge
Douglas H. Ginsburg out of a U.S. Supreme Court seat, but in
Massachusetts the new political wisdom seems to dictate that there
is safety in numbers.
   On Friday, the Boston Herald, under the Page One headline ``Pols
who have gone to pot,'' lined up thumbnail photos of some who
acknowledged dabbling in marijuana use. The politicians made their
admissions when asked by the newspaper.
   The growing list includes six Democrats _ U.S. Sen. John Kerry,
U.S. Reps. Joseph Kennedy and Richard Neal; Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy,
who is a candidate for governor; state Auditor Joseph DeNucci; and
state Sen. William Golden, who is running for lieutenant governor.
There are two Republicans, both running for lieutenant governor _
Paul Cellucci and state Rep. Peter Torkildsen.
   The admissions all sound a similar theme. They contain
references to youthful indiscretion, lessons learned and reason
that comes with age. Most of those coming forward point out that
they grew up in an era when drug experimentation was as common as
doing the twist and wearing Beatle haircuts.
   Kennedy, 37, said in a statement: ``Like many people my age, I
tried it when I was younger, but I certainly believe that there is
no benefit to drug use and there can be terrible consequences.''
   And Ms. Murphy, 49, who acknowledged using marijuana once or
twice, said the public will have to judge the conduct of those now
admitting prior drug use. ``I think we're much wiser about the
damage drugs have done,'' she said.
   There are, of course, staunch holdouts who say they never smoked
marijuana. A former U.S. attorney accused his predecessor, William
Weld, of smoking pot at a party. Weld, now a GOP gubernatorial
candidate, was exonerated of that charge. His spokesman, Ray
Howell, reiterated Friday that the 44-year-old Weld has never tried
drugs.
   At a shopping center near the Statehouse, several people seemed
positively underwhelmed by the news that their elected officials
had smoked pot in college.
   ``I really think it shouldn't be a big deal,'' said Bruce Hall,
a 39-year-old construction worker.
   His buddy, Jim Mooreside, 41, agreed: ``I think it might hurt
their image, but I don't see why.''
   And one 40-year-old woman, Sherry Flashman, who works in
planning, chastised the politicians for decrying their past drug
use.
   ``I really think it's a problem with this society that there
can't be an acknowledgment that a lot of people did it and it
wasn't a terrible thing,'' said Flashman. ``I think that's the real
shame.''

<HEAD>Reform Hurts Readiness of Once-Feared Warsaw Pact Frontline Force</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's army has suffered a loss of
morale, readiness and nearly a quarter of its troops since the
borders were opened and the perception of a threat from the West
began to diminish.
   East German troops have deserted, sold their uniforms in the
West and some even refused to take part in a military exercise last
month with Soviet troops.
   Defense Minister Theodor Hoffmann has conceded that reform has
inflicted ``many difficulties'' on the once-feared frontline force
of the Warsaw Pact.
   ``We are practically without subordinates,'' a senior army
officer said. ``The officers themselves have to walk patrols and
service tanks.''
   The officer, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said
the army has been hit hard by the departure of thousands of
soldiers through the open borders with the West.
   Col. Gerd Aperz of the Defense Ministry information office said
reports of the East German army's diminished defense capability
have been exaggerated in the West, but confirmed the emigration to
West Germany has taken its toll on the force.
   He also noted that more than 10 percent of the National People's
Army troops are deployed in factories, municipal maintenance crews
and in other public works to keep crucial industries and services
operating despite the daily departure of thousands of workers.
   More than 40,000 soldiers have left army service since Jan. 26,
when a military reform was announced to cut what was then a
200,000-troop force to 110,000 by the end of the year, Aperz said.
   But other Defense Ministry sources said only about half of the
departures were due to the planned reduction that was to be phased
in over the year.
   Increasing numbers have deserted to seek their fortunes in the
West, or failed to report back from furloughs amid a noticeable
decline in discipline and readiness, the sources said.
   Capt. Olaf Marks said nearly half of the 2,000 soldiers
stationed at his 23rd Rifle Regiment based in Bad Salzungen had
left in recent weeks.
   They join more than 400,000 East Germans who have fled to West
Germany since last summer, having abandoned hope that their living
standards will improve.
   Reform is being blamed for much of the decline in what was once
viewed as the strongest fighting force in Eastern Europe and the
most strategically located, due to its border with NATO member West
Germany.
   Improved relations between the two Germanys, as well as between
the two military alliances to which they belong, have changed
perceptions of Westerners from enemies to friends and greatly
reduced East German fears of a military threat emanating from
across the border.
   A young officer at this week's session of political talks
between Communists and opposition parties said many East German
soldiers can no longer conceive of circumstances that would prompt
them to take up arms against their West German brothers.
   Hoffmann, the defense minister, also addressed the session,
appealing to politicians not to make the army a campaign instrument
in the March 18 balloting, East Germany's first free elections.
   Expectations of imminent unification of the two Germanys has
encouraged the East German force to seek means of cooperating with
the West German Bundeswehr, rather than planning for counterattacks
that seem increasingly unlikely to be needed.
   Military strategists from East Germany and West Germany have
been discussing ways of sharing defense burdens in the event the
nations are unified.
   A joint East German-Soviet exercise near Berlin in early
February had to be scaled back after some East German troops
refused to take part.
   Aperz confirmed some soldiers objected because they ``considered
the exercise to be in conflict with the new reform character'' of
the army, but denied reports the soldiers refused to work with the
Soviet troops.
   East Germany is host for the bulk of the Soviet Union's 565,000
troops deployed in Eastern Europe, which has long been a matter of
resentment among residents of the regions where the Soviets are
stationed.
   The Kremlin has not yet faced significant pressure from East
Germans to pull out its troops, but a large withdrawal is expected
to be negotiated soon at the Vienna-based negotiations on
conventional armed forces.
   In the meantime, signs abound that the army has been taking its
responsibilities less seriously.
   In search of hard currency to buy consumer goods during Western
visits, some soldiers sell their uniform jackets, hats and ensignia
at the thriving West Berlin flea market near the Checkpoint Charlie
border crossing.
   On a recent afternoon, one brown-clad soldier approaching a
ditch-digging brigade drew a crowd of impressed fellow soldiers
around him when he displayed what two passing American reporters
mistook for a grenade launcher.
   ``It's a muffler,'' the soldier corrected the foreigners as his
fellow troops broke into howls of laughter. ``I just bought it over
in West Berlin.''

   The ex-model who helped the FBI arrest
Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion Barry on a drug charge pleaded no
contest to drunken driving Friday and was sentenced to three years'
probation and fined $927.
   Hazel Diane Moore, 38, of Burbank, known while modeling as
Rasheeda Moore, was not at the Van Nuys court. Defense attorney Ron
Lewis entered the plea for her, said Ted Goldstein, a city
attorney's office spokesman.
   Court Commissioner Mitchell Block assessed a fine of $390 and
penalties that boosted the total to $927.
   Ms. Moore also was ordered to attend a 90-day alcohol education
school. A 90-day restriction was placed on her driver's license
allowing her only to drive to and from work, and to and from the
school.
   She was stopped by north Hollywood police on Jan. 1 at 11:40
p.m. because she was driving with her headlights off.
   Ms. Moore, a friend of Barry, worked as an undercover informant
for the FBI, calling the mayor to a Washington hotel room where he
was arrested Jan. 18 for investigation of possessing cocaine.

   The president of the city's Transit Authority

   Alan Kiepper also said he gave another subway rider the wrong
directions.
   ``Needless to say, I was somewhat embarrassed,'' Kiepper said.
``I got off to a rocky start.''
   Kiepper, who started his job Thursday after heading transit
systems in Houston and Atlanta, began his day with a subway map in
hand at a station near his midtown Manhattan home.
   ``I always have a subway map, but I was distracted by the
gentleman asking about the (other) train,'' Kiepper said. He then
saw what he thought was his train and got aboard to go to the
Transit Authority headquarters in Brooklyn.
   ``As I hopped on the train, I noticed it was not full,'' he
said. ``I got on a train going to Queens.''
   He said the mix up made him 10 minutes late for a staff meeting.

<HEAD>BBC to Expand in US, Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British Broadcasting Corp. announced plans
Friday to expand its news programs in the United States and Eastern
Europe.
   ``One of the main principles behind the success of our
international broadcasting is that we broadcast to our friends as
well as those who _ until recently _ were enemies,'' said John
Tusa, managing director of the BBC World Service.
   ``We talk to open as well as to closed societies,'' he said.
   Tusa said that later this month, Americans will be able to dial
up the latest BBC news program by telephone at any time ``for less
than a dollar a minute.'' One cable television service, C-Span, is
devoting an audio channel to a 24-hour relay of BBC news and Tusa
expects it to grow from its present 1 million subscribers.
   He said he also hopes for growth in an arrangement with American
Public Radio that permits any of its stations to relay all BBC
world service material from midnight to six in the morning.
   Tusa, who was born in Czechoslovakia, said Eastern European
countries still need to hear controversy, comment and news from a
broad international viewpoint. He said non-Communist leaders in
Eastern Europe have asked the BBC to continue its programing and
are giving it facilities for local rebroadcast.
   To show the influence BBC broadcasts have had, Tusa held up a
photograph taken last June in Tiananmen Square before Chinese tanks
put down the pro-democracy movement. Students were carrying the
Chinese flag and a sign in both English and Chinese. In English it
said, ``Thank you BBC.''
   Tusa added that BBC officials are asking Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government for more money but declined to say how much.
He insisted that government financing does not lessen BBC
independence.
   ``The Foreign Office does not even attempt to tell us what to
say,'' Tusa told reporters.

<DATELINE>UPLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wide area of Southern California rolled
today with another aftershock of Wednesday's big earthquake,
triggering a rockslide on a mountain road but no reports of
significant damage or injuries.
   The quake shook Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and San
Diego counties. It also hit Orange County, where President Bush was
addressing a noon anti-drug rally.
   The aftershock measured 4.7 on the Richter scale at 9:26 a.m.,
said Robert Finn, spokesman for the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena.
   It was preceded today by a 2.5 quake at 2:52 a.m. and followed
within two hours by about 10 quakes under magnitude 2.5, including
a 2.4 at 10:41 a.m., according to Caltech.
   A rockslide closed Mount Baldy Road in the mountains north of
Upland and only residents were allowed through, Caltrans spokesman
Anthony Hughes said.
   ``It was scary and I'm shaking. But nothing fell or flew this
time,'' said Melina Manning of Ontario, two miles south of the
epicenter. ``All the pans and the lights swayed back and forth. It
was mild compared to the other day but very scary especially
because your nerves are shot from the other day.''
   ``I was under the desk again. It was very strong here,'' said
state Office of Emergency Services spokesman Michael Guerin in
Ontario.
   The aftershocks came as Southern Californians bounced by the
largest quake to hit the region in more than two years were
sweeping up after millions of dollars in damage.
   City council members in Pomona _ hardest hit of several areas
struck by Wednesday's earthquake _ said they would meet today to
request that Gov. George Deukmejian assist them in obtaining
federal or state funds to repair an estimated $10 million in damage
in their city.
   The state Office of Emergency Services said Thursday the quake,
measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale, caused at least $12.7 million
damage in the cities of Claremont, Pomona, La Verne, Chino,
Ontario, Rancho Cucamonga, Montclair and Upland and the counties of
Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino.
   The figure ``is very preliminary, based on information provided
by cities and counties,'' said Guerin.
   The quake, felt along the coast from San Diego to Santa Barbara
and as far east as Las Vegas, was centered on an unnamed fault
three miles northwest of this city 40 miles east of Los Angeles. It
toppled scores of chimneys, shattered hundreds of windows and
collapsed one building's wall, but remarkably, caused no major
injuries or deaths.
   Dozens of smaller aftershocks have rattled the area since.
   There was no official estimate of the number of injured other
than ``several dozen'' from the OES. The most serious injuries,
officials said, were a few broken bones.
   Only one person, a Pomona man, was known to have been left
homeless by the quake.
   But the temblor spurred renewed calls for Southern Californians
to prepare for the so-called ``Big One,'' a catastrophic earthquake
measuring between 7.5 and 8 on the Richter scale of ground motion.
A 1988 U.S. Geological Survey report said that a quake that size is
at least 60 percent likely by the year 2018 on the southern San
Andreas Fault.
   ``This is the handwriting on the wall and we better start
looking at the design of some of our buildings,'' Pomona Vice Mayor
Clay Bryant said Thursday. ``We've already been put on notice by a
5.5.''
   Pomona Mayor Donna Smith said city inspectors were compiling a
list of how many unreinforced masonry buildings remain in the city,
which has several landmark structures more than 100 years old.
   She said 301 buildings in Pomona were damaged and 17 were
declared uninhabitable.
   Pomona, Claremont and La Verne all declared local states of
emergency Wednesday, but the La Verne City Council withdrew its
declaration Thursday after determining damage was not as bad as
first believed.
   The destruction was widely scattered throughout the region.
   In Pomona, for example, part of the south face of the
58-year-old brick-and-concrete Trinity United Methodist Church
collapsed while the brick Pilgram Congregational Church a block
away withstood the quake.
   At the city's historic Phillips Mansion, built in 1875, a
chimney toppled onto a roof, causing an estimated $500,000 damage,
but surrounding buildings were unscathed.
   Despite the damage, the quake was far less serious than the one
that struck the Whittier area on Oct. 1, 1987. That one measured
5.9 and, together with a 5.3-magnitude aftershock on Oct. 4, killed
eight people, injured more than 200 and caused $358 million in
damage.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. An earthquake of 5 can cause considerable damage and
6 severe damage.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Moslem separatists dressed in
death shrouds tried to march to Srinagar on Friday, a day after
government troops shot to death 49 Moslems, but soldiers blocked
the rally, police said.
   The march was to have begun in Sumbal, 15 miles north of
Srinagar, said a senior police official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. He said at least 1,000 Moslems gathered in the town but
were stopped by soldiers before they could leave for Srinagar.
   Witnesses contacted by telephone said the demonstrators had
draped themselves in white burial shrouds to show they were willing
to die in the fight for secession.
   A police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at
least 49 people died and between 45 and 100 were injured Thursday
in two incidents related to the Moslems' campaign. The government
said the officers fired in self-defense.
   The militants want independence for the Moslem-dominated Kashmir
region, a part of India's Jammu-Kashmir state. It is the only
Moslem-dominated state in India, where the majority of the
population is Hindu.
   The latest shootings prompted authorities to impose an
indefinite curfew at 4 a.m. Friday on Sringar, which is the
capital, and six other towns.
   It prevented Moslems from attending the weekly Friday prayers,
which in the past have been flashpoints for trouble.
   Police said one group of separatists defied the curfew and
gathered along Dal Lake, but they were chased away by paramilitary
troops.
   An officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said one of the
protesters fell to his death in the cold lake. The victim was not
identified.
   The death brought to 162 the number of people killed in Kashmir
since the current round of secession-related violence flared Jan.
20 following a government crackdown on Moslem militants.
   The violence brought criticism from neighboring Pakistan, a
Moslem nation that disputes India's right to govern Kashmir. Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto's government said it condemned the ``brutal
Indian response ... to the people of Kashmir, who were asking only
for their right of self-determination.''
   The Kashmir issue has been a point of contention between
Pakistan and India since 1947, following the partition of the old
British colonial Asian Subcontinent into two independent nations:
mostly Hindu India and overwhelmingly Moslem Pakistan.
   Kashmir became a subject of dispute because its population was
mostly Moslem but its ruler was a Hindu who wanted to join India.
   A brief war between the two countries left a slice of the valley
under Pakistani control and the rest of Kashmir as part of the
Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir. A second war in 1965 did not change
the situation.

<HEAD>US Calls For Contra Demobilization, With Assurances</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Friday that
immediate steps should be taken to encourage the demobilization of
the Nicaraguan Contras but that the rebels must have ``full
assurances'' beforehand for their personal and economic security.
   ``It is important that their legitimate needs be met,'' said
department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, noting that Central
American presidents have signed agreements stating that the Contra
concerns must not be ignored. The bulk of the Contra forces have
spent most of the last two years at camps in Honduras.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the admnistration has dispatched veteran envoy
Harry Shlaudeman to Honduras to confer with the Contras about their
concerns. Shlaudeman served as ambassador to four South American
countries and was called out of retirement last year to deal with
the Nicaraguan issue.
   Ms. Tutwiler said that equally important to the Contra
demobilization is the ``full and unequivocal transfer'' of civil
and military power to the new Nicaraguan government.
   Both President Daniel Ortega and the victorious opposition
candidate in Sunday's election, Violeta Chamorro, have said the
Contras should be disbanded. Ortega has indicated that
demobilization is necessary if a peaceful transition is to be
carried out on April 25, inauguration day.
   But State Department officials said that a former Contra
regional commander who went back to Nicaragua to join the election
process several weeks ago accused the Sandinistas of mistreating
returning Contras.
   The Contra officer, known as Comandante Johnson, said that of 41
rebels who had returned in peace, 27 were in prison, 12 were dead
and only two were free. State Department officials, insisting on
anonymity, said they believe Johnson's figures are essentially
correct.
   About 10,000 rebels are at camps in southern Honduras, surviving
on food and other necessities provided by the United States. The
total number being cared for in the camps, including family
members, is 60,000.
   The demobilization of the Contras and civilian control over the
military, now under Sandinista party control, have dominated the
political debate in Nicaragua since Mrs. Chamorro's election
victory.

   The government on Friday ordered a
25 percent increase in fuel prices, which have nearly tripled since
the first of the year.
   The price of gasoline rose from $2.15 a gallon to $2.93 a
gallon. The prices for diesel fuel, kerosene, alcohol fuel and
cooking gas also rose one-fourth.
   The government subsidizes alcohol to make it 25 percent cheaper
than gasoline, although it costs twice as much as gasoline to
produce. About one-third of Brazil's 13.5 million vehicles run on
alcohol made from domestically grown sugar cane.
   The increase was the sixth since January, and 15 days after a 48
percent price hike. Fuel prices have risen 281 percent this year.
   The government adjusts fuel prices for inflation, which hit a
record 73 percent for February. It raised prices 17 times in 1989,
when inflation was 1,765 percent.

<TEXT>
   Disabled Iranian war veterans staged a
pro-government rally in Tehran on Friday in an apparent attempt to
counter protests of the administration reported in the capital and
other cities.
   Tehran radio said ``a large group'' of disabled veterans marched
about 1{ miles through the capital from the former U.S. Embassy to
the Tehran University campus.
   Residents of the capital have reported a number of angry or
violent protests last week sparked by popular resentment over
continued economic hardships faced by most Iranians.
   Friday's marchers, chanting pro-government slogans, joined the
weekly prayers at the university campus. They called on judicial
officials to crack down on opposition group members, profiteering
shopkeepers and drug smugglers, the radio said.
   Although Iranian officials have kept reports of any unrest under
wraps, a senior Iranian cleric Friday hinted at the trouble.
   Hojatoleslam Emami Kashani, addressing the weekly university
prayer session, admitted that ``of course we have many economic
problems, which the government is trying to solve.''
   But he added, ``Some people ... say things out of ignorance such
as `This (government) program cannot be pursued,' or `This program
cannot solve the economic hardships.'''
   The state-run radio, television and the Islamic Republic News
Agency, all monitored in Nicosia, have not reported any unrest in
Iranian cities, apart from an IRNA report that 30 people were
arrested Feb. 16 when soccer fans protested the cancellation of two
matches.
   An Iranian newspaper, the Farsi-language Resalat, reported that
some of the sports fans had ``taken advantage'' of the
cancellations to voice other concerns.
   The country is plagued by soaring inflation, shortages of most
commodities and high unemployment despite President Hashemi
Rafsanjani's attempts to revitalize the economy.
   An Iranian opposition group, the Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq,
has reported that security forces killed several hundred people
while putting down recent anti-government protests in Tehran and
the provincial centers of Isfahan, Shiraz, Tabriz and Mashad. The
reports could not be independently confirmed.
   Iranian travelers to Cyprus have reported demonstrations in
Tehran calling for stricter control of the Islamic dress code and
expressing dissatisfaction with Rafsanjani's attempts to liberalize
the tightly controlled society.
   A leading Iranian cleric, Ayatollah Ahmad Azari Qomi, said in a
sermon last Friday that some agitators were stirring up relatives
of those killed in the Islamic revolution, to convince them the
state-run radio and television were airing un-Islamic programming.
   Such rhetoric about anti-Islamic moves has been voiced by
radicals in the Tehran hierarchy who are locked in an intensifying
power struggle with Rafsanjani's so-called pragmatic camp.
   The radicals, led by former Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, believe Rafsanjani's economic policies calling for
foreign investment and ties with the West, plus his attempts to
ease the government controls on the society, will dilute the fervor
of the Islamic revolution.

   Atlantis' astronauts, silent to the
world because of their military mission, put in a final day of work
in orbit Friday on their hush-hush assignments before preparing for
a Sunday landing.
   NASA said Atlantis is scheduled to land Sunday at Edwards Air
Force Base, and a spokesman said this means the five-member,
all-military crew probably will spend most of Saturday packing up
for the return to Earth.
   No information was released about the crew's activites in orbit,
but Jeff Carr, a spokesman at the Johnson Space Center, said that
if the Atlantis crew follows shuttle mission routine, then Friday
was the final full day to complete the secret objectives.
   Typically, the day before landing ``is a day to clean up and
start cabin stowage,'' Carr said. He said astronauts usually must
spend their pre-return day in orbit dismantling and putting away
equipment used during the mission.
   Carr said the astronauts on Saturday also must test fire the
reaction control jets and check other critical systems that
Atlantis will need during its fiery plunge through Earth's
atmosphere.
   Workers, meanwhile, started inspections of the solid rocket
boosters that were used to put Atlantis in orbit. The spent
boosters were recovered from the sea, where they fell after the
launch and towed to the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The
boosters will be disassembled and refurbished for later use.
   NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone said a general inspection of the
rockets didn't reveal any abnormalities, but noted, ``we really
won't know until they're taken apart.''
   It was a failed solid rocket booster that caused the 1986
Challenger accident that killed seven astronauts.
   The silence from Atlantis on Friday was good news, said NASA
spokesman Bruce Buckingham.
   As long as there is no announcement from Mission Control, said
Buckingham, ``we can safely assume there are no problems.''
   A Pentagon-imposed blackout on mission details is to be broken
sometime Saturday for an official NASA announcement of the precise
landing time. This announcement usually comes 24 hours before
landing.
   Sources at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
said the astronauts accomplished the major objective of their
mission Thursday.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
astronauts successfully cast into orbit a $500 million spy
satellite that will take detailed pictures of the Soviet Union,
including areas not seen by previous shuttle-launch satellites. The
spy craft also is able to tune into electronic communications all
over the world, the sources said.
   Atlantis' mission began early Wednesday with a spectacular
launch in darkness from the Kennedy Space Center. The liftoff came
on the sixth attempt. Five earlier countdowns were halted due to
weather, the illness of an astronaut and a failed computer.
   The mission is commanded by Navy Capt. John O. Creighton. Others
in the crew are Air Force Col. John H. Casper, the pilot, and
mission specialists Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, Air Force
Col. Richard M. Mullane and Navy Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.
   Atlantis' flight is 34th shuttle mission and the sixth dedicated
solely to the military.

   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis rested at home Friday
after undergoing surgery for a broken hand he suffered while
helping push his father-in-law's car from a snowdrift, his press
office said.
   Dukakis fractured the fourth and fifth metacarpals, the bones
between the fingers and the wrist.
   During a two-hour operation at Brigham and Women's Hospital,
done under local anesthesia, doctors used a plate and screws to set
the bones in his left hand.
   The unsuccessful presidential candidate also tore the ligament
on the inside of his right thumb during the Feb. 24 accident, and
was expected to undergo minor surgery on that hand later.
   The governor was wearing a plaster splint, which will be
replaced next week with a removable one. Healing will take up to
six weeks, his doctors said.

<HEAD>Fear of Arab Backlash Over Soviet Immigration Leads to Censorship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel on Friday ordered journalists to submit
all stories containing monthly Soviet immigration figures to the
military censor, apparently because of fears the numbers will
increase Arab opposition to the influx.
   In its announcement, the military censor said ``all material
pertaining to immigration of Soviet Jews must be submitted to the
censor prior to publication.''
   The censor is not expected to release the data, so the screening
process could amount to a ban. Previously, the media reported the
figures without checking with the censor.
   The new restrictions were imposed after it was estimated this
week that up to 230,000 Soviet Jews may immigrate this year, as
opposed to earlier estimates of 80,000 to 100,000, the Maariv
newspaper reported.
   Maariv said the higher figure was predicted by Yasha Kazakov,
deputy head of the Liaison Bureau, a government unit that deals
with Soviet immigration.
   The estimate ``created panic in the Arab countries, and the
protests coming from these countries endanger immigration,'' the
daily said.
   Yossi Ben-Aharon, Prime Minister Yizhak Shamir's top aide,
agreed, saying that ``there is so much talk of numbers and
forecasts that it caused damage. Why say 230,000 or whatever?''
   Robert Slater, the head of the Foreign Press Association in
Israel, said the restrictions are pointless because there already
have been many detailed reports on Soviet immigration.
   ``We are extremely disappointed at the use of military
censorship for political purposes,'' Slater added.
   Yossi Olmert, head of the Government Press Office, called the
restrictions ``very limited'' and denied they were imposed for
political reasons, such as to silence debate on whether Soviet Jews
can settle in the occupied territories.
   Israel denies it directs the flow of immigrants to the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, where Palestinians are fighting for their
own state.
   The United States and Soviet Union oppose new settlements in the
occupied lands, saying they are an obstacle to making peace with
the Palestinians. Arab leaders view even mass immigration to Israel
proper as a grave threat.
   The latest immigration surge began last year, when 12,000 Soviet
Jews came to Israel, in part because of relaxed emigration rules in
the Soviet Union. In January 1990, 4,700 Soviet Jews immigrated.
Israeli leaders have said they expect up to 750,000 this decade.
   Israel is hoping for $400 million in loan guarantees from the
United States to help house the immigrants, and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III said Thursday the Bush administration may link
that aid to assurances that no new Jewish settlements would be put
in the occupied territories.
   The proposal brought angry responses from Israeli leaders Friday
and concerns the disagreement could further delay Middle East peace
talks.
   Shamir of the right-wing Likud bloc called the Baker proposal
``completely unneccesary'' and urged Washington to reconsider what
he called the ``maddening idea.''
   Shamir also criticized the timing of the remarks, noting that
Baker is trying to persuade him to accept compromises to get
U.S.-mediated peace talks started.
   ``No pressure, whether internal or external, will be able to
influence me when it comes to vital national issues,'' Shamir told
Israel television.
   In a rare show of unity, his rival, Labor Party leader Shimon
Peres, joined in the criticism of Baker's proposal.
   Diplomatic sources in Washington said Friday the dispute over
the U.S. aid, combined with other comments Baker made Thursday
about the PLO, could set back the peace process even more.
   The sources, who refused to be identified, said Shamir had been
prepared to recommend the Israeli government approve in principle a
three-way meeting of Baker and the Egyptian and Israeli foreign
ministers. But now, the sources said, that would be ``almost
impossible.''
   In addition to the aid proposal, Baker said Thursday in
Washington he was satisfied that PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat was
adhering to his December 1988 renunciation of terrorism against
Israel. Baker said there was no evidence of Arafat's complicity in
terrorism since then.
   Shamir is under pressure from Washington and from legislators at
home to accept compromises so that preliminary peace talks with a
Palestinian delegation can be held.
   Labor politicians want him to compromise, but hard-liners in
Likud oppose any concessions. The country's top leaders are to meet
Sunday on the issue.
   Baker said Thursday he expects a decision soon from the Shamir
government on the peace process.
   ``We have done pretty much all we can do, we think, from our
end, and we are waiting for a response from the Israeli
government,'' he said.

   A mild earthquake shook people awake
early Friday, generating dozens of calls to authorities but no
reports of damage or serious injuries.
   The tremor, centered about 10 miles south of Vandalia, struck at
1:02 a.m. and registered 3.4 on the Richter scale, said Waverly
Person, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey's National
Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.
   A quake of magnitude 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage.
   Person said small earthquakes occur frequently in the area. He
said aftershocks were unlikely and the quake was too mild to extend
outside Illinois.
   Southern Illinois rests on several fault lines, including the
New Madrid Fault, which generated one of the most powerful
earthquakes in U.S. history _ measuring an estimated 8.3 on the
Richter scale _ near New Madrid, Mo., in the early 1800s.
   That fault, which extends from Cairo to Marked Tree, Ark., was
not a factor in Friday's tremor, authorities said.
   The Marion and Clinton County sheriff's departments received
about a dozen calls.
   ``One lady that lived in a government housing unit said the
whole building shook,'' said Pauline Bliss, a Marion County
corrections officer. ``One called us and thought they'd had a
prowler in the house ... and another wanted to know if the (grain)
elevator had collapsed or something.''
   ``I was asleep and it kind of woke me up and I thought it was a
big truck. We live right beside the interstate,'' said Martha
Wilkes, a convenience-store employee in Sandoval.
   ``My husband told me, ``Something _ I don't know what it was _
but the whole house shook,''' she said.

   Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's
battered Congress Party was voted out of power in five of eight
state legislatures this week, election results showed Friday.
   But it retained control in the western state of Maharashtra and
awaited election results from the crucial state of Bihar, where it
faced stiff competition from the Janata Dal party of Prime Minister
V.P. Singh, Gandhi's arch political foe and successor.
   Elections, marked by widespread violence and allegations of vote
fraud, were conducted Tuesday for 1,610 seats in the eight states
and the federally administered Pondicherry region in the south.
   The Congress Party had controlled all nine legislatures.
   The defeats came three months after Gandhi's party lost power in
national parliamentary elections. Political analysts and newspapers
have attributed the defeats to alleged corruption and incompetence
in the party's federal and state governments.
   At least 80 people were killed in Bihar, India's poorest state,
in bomb blasts, police shootings and clashes since voting began
this week. Nationwide, 98 people died in election-related violence.
   Results of Tuesday's elections showed the Congress Party had
lost Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and
Rajasthan to the Janata Dal and the right-wing Bharatiya Janata
Party, or the Indian People's Party. Few results from the eighth
state, Arunachal Pradesh, had come in.
   The Congress also lost the Pondicherry assembly.
   ``It would clearly take a superhuman effort by the party to
recover the lost ground in the coming days,'' said The Statesman, a
Calcutta-based independent daily.
   ``The results from Maharashtra came as a morale booster to the
Congress, which had been stunned by its second debacle in three
months,'' said another newspaper, Patriot.
   The Congress Party won 142 seats in the 288-member Maharashtra
assembly. The Bharatiya Janata Party won 39, Janata Dal took 25 and
the rest were splintered among smaller parties and independents.
   But overall, the Congress Party has only 343 of the 1,367 seats
declared so far in the eight states and Pondicherry.
   In the eastern state of Bihar, which has the largest assembly
among the nine territories, results of 136 constituencies had been
announced, with the Congress getting 23 seats, the Janata Dal 52
and the Bharatiya Janata Party 15. The rest went to smaller parties
and independent candidates.
   The Election Commission ordered repolling in 1,000 voting
centers in Bihar after complaints of ballot stuffing, voter
intimidation and widespread violence.
   On Friday, soldiers patrolled the streets of Meham town in
Haryana state, where at least 13 people were killed during a
by-election for the state legislature.
   The violence was blamed on supporters of Om Prakash Chauthala,
the Janata Dal candidate in Meham and the chief minister of Haryana.
   Newspapers said violence erupted when supporters of Chauthala
tried to stuff ballot boxes and scare voters in areas where he was
not expected to get many votes.
   Chauthala, who was appointed to the chief minister's elected
post, was required under Indian laws to seek voters' mandate to
ratify his position.
   Janata Dal spokesman Jaipal Reddy said the party will take
disciplinary action against Chauthala if he was found guilty of
violence.
   ``Nobody will be above this process,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A former deputy prime minister accused of
receiving a $2 million bribe resigned from the Socialist party on
Friday, three days after Swiss authorities sent his bank records to
Greek investigators.
   Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas, 68, said he was resigning temporarily
until he cleared his name. He was indicted by Parliament in
September on charges of accepting a bribe from banker George
Koskotas.
   A former aide, Yannis Mantzouranis, told a parliamentary inquiry
that Koutsogiorgas received a $2 million bribe in 1988 after
passing legislation allegedly hindering Central Bank audits of
Koskotas' privately owned Bank of Crete.
   Koskotas has been charged with embezzling $210 million from the
bank. He fled to the United States in November 1988 where he is
imprisoned in a Boston area jail fighting extradition to Greece.
   Papandreou and three other senior Socialist officials have also
been indicted in connection with Koskotas' allegations that they
authorized and took part in the embezzlement scheme. They face
possible prison sentences of 10 years to life if convicted. No
trial dates have been set.
   The contents of Koutsogiorgas' Swiss bank account, held jointly
with his wife, have not been made public.
   Koutsogiorgas served in Andreas Papandreou's 1981-89 government
in several posts. In 1974, he was one of the founders of the
Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK, and was Papandreou's
personal lawyer and closest aide.
   The Socialists lost inconclusive elections in June and November,
and participated in an all-party coalition from November to
February. Koutsogiorgas and former Transport Minister George Petsos
were barred by PASOK from running for Parliament in 1989.
   Petsos resigned from the party last year.

   The Soviet Union will withdraw all of its troops
from Mongolia by 1992, Tass said Friday.
   Previously, the Soviets had said they would remove about
three-quarters of their troops and all of their aircraft in the
sparsely populated republic on the Chinese border. It was part of a
move to normalize strained relations with China.
   The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies
yearbook for 1989-90 estimated the Soviets had 60,000 troops in
Mongolia, including one army headquarters unit, two tank divisions
and two motor rifles divisions.
   Tass said the main combat units would be withdrawn in 1991 and
equipment support units would be removed in 1992.

   Senators told Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins on Friday to speed up opening the Yucca Mountain
underground storage site for nuclear power plant waste but said his
new timetable may be too optimistic.
   ``We can't continue simply to speculate on what we might or
might not find there,'' Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., told
Watkins, in urging that underground exploration begin. ``It is time
to start making some of those controversial decisions.''
   Johnston presided over a hearing of the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee in its first review of Watkins' plan,
which was released in November 1989.
   The timetable calls for above-ground studies to begin next
January at the Nevada site, which was selected by Congress to hold
the spent fuel from the nation's 100 nuclear power plants.
   The spent rdioactive fuel is currently being stored on site, but
that capacity is limited and 27 sites will run out of storage,
according to the Energy Department. Congress enacted the Nuclear
Waste Policy Act in 1982 and amended it in 1987 to deal with that
problem.
   In the meantime, according to testimony, utility customers are
paying extra for on-site storage and the federally mandated plan.
Johnston also noted that the longer the delays, the less money the
plan will receive from Congress and the more difficult it will be
to ``scale up'' spending later.
   The original date for the first testing had been in May 1989,
but that schedule has been delayed because of objections in Nevada
to the state's being the repository for radioactive waste from
power plants nationwide.
   Watkins' timetable called for the underground repository to
begin accepting spent fuel in 2010, at least seven years behind
schedule. The first step in that process is the above-ground tests
that would begin in early 1991.
   The above-ground tests are needed to make a preliminary
determination of whether underground storage is even feasible.
   But the big ``if'' in the schedule is the outcome of two
lawsuits filed this January: one by the state of Nevada against the
Energy Department; and one by the department against Nevada.
   Both cases deal with the refusal of Nevada to grant the
necessary permits to begin exploration of the site, which was
chosen by Congress as a solution to the spent fuel storage problem.
   Sen. James A. McClure, R-Idaho, said now that the issue is in
the legal system there is little control over it.
   ``I do know enough about that profession to be pessimistic,''
said McClure, a lawyer.

<HEAD>Judge Says Elizabeth Morgan Can Have Passport Returned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, involved in an
international custody battle over her daughter, can have her
passport back so she can go to New Zealand to fight a lawsuit filed
by her former husband, an appeals court panel ruled Friday.
   A three-judge District of Columbia Court of Appeals panel freed
her to travel to New Zealand and visit her daughter, Hilary.
   Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon had seized the passport in
August 1987 when he jailed Morgan for failing to reveal the
whereabouts of Hilary, whom Morgan said had been a victim of sexual
abuse by the girl's father.
   He has denied the charges and claimed Morgan was mentally ill.
Morgan and Foretich separated before Hilary was born.
   On Thursday, Dixon said he was satisfied that the return of the
passport was ``in the best interests'' of Morgan's daughter, who is
now 7. However, he was unable to return it because it was in the
possession of the appeals court.
   The girl, who has been living with her maternal grandparents in
Christchurch, New Zealand, was the subject of a 2{-year search by
her father. Her whereabouts became known Feb. 23.
   Dixon had ordered Morgan to jail for contempt of court in August
1986 for refusing to allow Foretich to visit the girl. Morgan was
released three days later by the appeals court, which required her
to surrender the deed to her house as bond and turn over her
passport.
   In February 1987, Dixon sent her to jail again, but she was
released three days later after agreeing to allow Foretich's visits.
   In August 1987, Dixon jailed Morgan for a third time. She
remained imprisoned until September 1989.
   In his order of Thursday, Dixon noted that Morgan remained in
contempt of court.
   Elaine Mittleman, Foretich's attorney, has not ruled out the
possibility of taking further legal action against Morgan.

   Portraying Elvis Presley is a lot of fun, says
actor Michael St. Gerard, it's hearing all those stories about the
King of rock 'n' roll that wears him out.
   ``There are times where if one more person tells me one more
thing about Elvis, I'd like to punch him out,'' said St. Gerard,
who portrays a young Presley in the ABC series ``Elvis.''
   While the Presley persona is well known, St. Gerard says he
doesn't feel bound to simply imitate Elvis when doing the show.

go for the truth of the scene. Here's a 19-year-old guy. What would

issue.
   ``I can't always be bogged down with mannerisms, because I would
fall into the danger of playing a caricature of him.''
   St. Gerard's taste in women is a bit different from the King's

``Margaret Thatcher. I love Margaret Thatcher.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers who signed up in a new ``0-25''
program for 1990-crop soybeans will be allowed to plant all of
their requested acreage, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Keith Bjerke, executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., said that under 0-25 provisions producers
could request permission to plant soybeans on as much as 25 percent
of their 1990 permitted acreages of wheat, feed grains, cotton and
rice.
   The signup was held Jan. 16 through Feb. 16. Sunflowers and
safflowers also were permitted but did not require a formal signup.
   Farmers participating in the program will not have the oilseed
acreage charged against farm acreage bases or individual crop
bases. Instead, the land planted to soybeans, sunflowers and
safflowers will be considered as planted to the program crop for
crop history purposes.
   However, Bjerke said no program benefits other than soybean
price support loans and purchases will be available on the
production from the acreage planted under the 0-25 option.
   When the program was announced on Dec. 29, it was specified that
USDA would estimate how 1990 soybean prices may respond. If prices
were indicated at less than $4.98 per bushel _ 110 percent of the
price support loan rate of $4.53 _ the department would reduce or
eliminate the acreage to be allowed for soybeans.
   Bjerke said a review of anticipated additional soybean plantings
showed the 0-25 program will not result in 1990 prices dropping
below the specified level.
   In all, about 1.92 million acres of additional soybeans were
enrolled in the program, along with 10,161 acres of sunflowers and
87.1 acres of safflowers.
   Some of the biggest soybean enrollments included: Illinois,
293,155 acres; Indiana, 121,722; Iowa, 261,617; Kansas, 229,028;
Minnesota, 169,576; Nebraska, 255,178; and South Dakota, 116,123.

<HEAD>Swiss to Receive $3.9 Million for Soviet Assets Nationalized in
War</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has agreed to pay
Switzerland $3.9 million to compensate for assets nationalized by
Moscow in World War II, officials said Friday.
   The compensation agreement relates to property owned by about
900 Swiss companies and individuals in areas of the Soviet Union
that were formerly part of East Poland, East Prussia, the Baltics
and Bessarabia, a foreign ministry statement said.
   The deal however does not include Swiss assets seized after the
Communists came to power in 1917.
   Switzerland has already signed similar accords with Poland and
Hungary.
   The Swiss government will decide how to distribute the funds
after ratification of the agreement, the date of which was not
divulged following a meeting in the Swiss capital.
   Switzerland has pressed for compensation ever since it resumed
diplomatic relations with Moscow in 1946. Bilateral talks started
in 1972.
   The two countries also concluded an investment guarantee accord
to encourage the establishment of joint ventures and improve the
investment climate by strengthening legal protection.
   Igor Feodorovich Koslovski, a vice-minister in the Soviet
finance ministry, attended the meeting in Bern.

   A man angry that his Social Security
check was late wounded a postman and three passers-by in a 25-round
barrage of shotgun fire, authorities said Friday.
   One neighbor likened the violence to a bizarre skeet-shooting
session.
   Gerard Pawloski was arraigned in Friday in Grand Rapids District
Court on eight counts of assault with intent to murder for the
shooting spree that erupted Thursday when he spotted a substitute
mailman, who was running about five hours behind schedule.
   ``He was shooting like crazy at the mailman and at the car in
front of him, filling the car full of holes,'' said neighbor Alan
Peckham, who recalled that despite the violence, Pawloski appeared
strangely calm.
   ``I walked up to about 15 or 20 feet away from him and asked him
what he was doing,'' Peckham said. ``He said he was shooting at the
postman.
   ``Jerry was mumbling to himself,'' Peckham said. ``It was just
like it was his job or something. He wasn't sweating, shaking or
nothing. It was like he was skeet shooting.''
   Mailman Kenneth Peek, hit three times, was in fair condition
Friday. A pedestrian and two passing motorists sustained minor
wounds; the remaining charges covered people who were in the area
but who weren't hit.
   ``We've substantiated from witnesses who he talked to at the
time of the shooting or afterward that he indicated his displeasure
over the absence or tardiness of the check,'' said police Lt.
Victor Gillis.
   Pawloski, 42, who neighbors said often waited on the front porch
for his government disability check, fired 25 rounds from a
12-gauge, double-barrel shotgun when he spotted Peek across the
street, according to Gillis. The officer didn't know the nature of
the disability for which Pawlski got payments from the Social
Security Administration.
   After the shooting spree, which Gillis said lasted three or four
minutes, Pawloski holed up inside his home, keeping police at bay
for five hours. He surrendered about 8:30 p.m. after being forced
out by tear gas.
   Pawloski, who has a history of mental illness and spent time in
psychiatric institutions, doesn't have criminal record, police said.
   Pawloski also was charged with felony use of a firearm. He was
ordered held at the Kent County Jail on $250,000 bond and a
preliminary examination was set for March 12.
   If convicted he could be sentenced to life in prison.

<HEAD>Aspin Asks Bush to Cut Troops in Europe Before Treaty Signed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee called on the Bush administration Friday to consider
reducing the number of troops in Europe and not wait until a
U.S.-Soviet conventional arms treaty.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., cited the testimony of CIA Director
William Webster, who told the panel Thursday that reversing the
radical changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet threat to the West
is highly unlikely.
   ``What Judge Webster was saying is we've seen a lot and
regardless of whether we get a conventional forces agreement or not
there has been a fundamental shift in the threat to Europe,'' the
chairman said Friday at an Armed Services hearing.
   But Gen. John R. Galvin, the commander of U.S. forces in Europe,
said he opposed any cuts in American troop levels until a
U.S.-Soviet pact is reached to reduce conventional forces.
   ``Let's keep our chips on the table here until we get the
agreement,'' said Galvin.
   He said the administration's plan to reduce forces in the
Central Front of Europe to 195,000 will take about three years.
Aspin questioned why cuts couldn't be part of the president's
budget for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
   ``If you believe clearly what Judge Webster was saying, we
shouldn't have to wait and put the whole 1991 budget on hold in
Europe. We ought to be making some changes starting next fall,'' he
said. ``I see this 1991 budget as essentially a hold budget in
Europe.''
   Although Webster said a resurgence in the Soviet threat is
unlikely, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney warns that a hardline
government could present problems to the United States.
   In testimony Thursday, Cheney stood by the administration's plan
to cut troop levels in Europe, allowing 195,000 in the central zone
and 30,000 troops elsewhere in Europe.

<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, in a
letter to the dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust
Studies, said anti-Semitism will not be tolerated in a reunited
Germany.
   Rabbi Marvin Hier said Friday that he's not ``applauding the
rush toward German reunification'' despite Kohl's assurances, which
came in a reply to a letter Hier wrote Feb. 9. In it, the rabbi
urged that a united Germany ban anti-Semitic organizations and take
pains to remember its Nazi past.
   Kohl, in a response dated Feb. 28, said hate crimes are not
tolerated in West Germany and do not go unpunished.
   He acknowledged ``the untold suffering inflicted on those people
in the name of Germany and by Germans,'' and added, ``I understand
the anxiety expressed by some victims ... in view of the prospect
of German unity.''
   However, he told Hier, ``It needs to be asked whether such
anxiety is essentially justified, whether its roots lie not only in
the past but also in the present. In this respect, our views
evidently differ.''
   On Thursday, the East German Foreign Ministry proposed that
experts from both Germanys meet soon to work out a common position
on German unification for presentation to the World War II Allies _
the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France.
   In his letter, Hier outlined a 10-point plan that he said would
``reassure those who bear the scars of Nazism that a united Germany
will never again heed the call of a dictator.''
   The rabbi said a unified Germany should establish a federal
agency to monitor hate groups and prosecute violators, and a
national education task force that would emphasize teaching of the
Holocaust.
   Concentration campsites should be turned into museums ``that
would depict the horrors of Nazism,'' Hier said. He called for a
ban of anti-Semitic organizations and pushed for restitution
payments and a government commitment to rebuild synagogues and
Jewish learning centers in East Germany.
   Kohl has said West Germans are taught about Nazi oppression
through schools, church groups and the media.
   ``To my mind, there is no doubt that these provisions will also
apply in a united Germany,'' Kohl wrote. ``This certainly does not
require any special demand!''
   Hier said Friday that the victims of Nazi Germany should have a
say in planning of a new Germany.
   ``Those who suffered have paid dearly for the right to voice
their concerns,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``They deserve
as much attention as issues being raised by world leaders.''
   ``It's kind of naive for Kohl to suggest, `Trust me on this,'''
Hier said. ``There's no reason to accept that trust.''

<TEXT>
   Contra commanders on Friday again spurned a plea by
Nicaragua's President-elect Violeta Chamorro to lay down their arms
immediately, and instead proposed negotiations with the new
government.
   The Sandinistas, defeated in Sunday's elections in Nicaragua,
have threatened to keep control of the country's military and
secret police as long as an estimated 10,000 Contras remain armed
and mobilized.
   Mrs. Chamorro and, more recently, President Bush have called on
the rebels to surrender their arms to achieve a national
reconciliation and end a decade of civil war, but at a news
conference here they again refused.
   ``We demand the total demilitarization of the Sandinista Front,
and the disappearance of the state-party-army that support it,''
said spokesman Juan Fernando Ramirez. ``There can be no disarming
of the resistance without a transfer of command to the new
government.''
   He also said Contra leaders want an explanation of comments by
Sandinista party officials that they will ``govern from below''
even after the U.S.-backed government assumes power on April 25.
   ``That could mean terrorism, extortion and assassination,'' he
said.
   Fernando released a letter written to Mrs. Chamorro by top
Contra leader and commander Israel Galeano, proposing negotiations
with the new government. He said she has not formally replied, but
has indicated willingness to take part in talks with the Contras.
   Commander Jose Rivas, representing the Contra's largest force,
the northern front operating from Honduras, said his troops wanted
peace, but not at the price of immediate surrender of their arms.
   ``Our position is that when the Sandinista front surrenders its
arms, we will surrender ours,'' Rivas said.
   Maritza Herrera said many of her 2,500 Costa Rica-based rebels
on Nicaragua's southern front felt they were betrayed by the
leftist government during the amnesty.
   She said 50 of the rebels who turned themselves in were arrested
and 28 were killed.
   ``There is no international organization, there is no
government, that can guarantee our safety,'' she said. ``This
process will take time.''
   Asked if the Contras were providing a pretext to the Sandinistas
to stay in power, Rivas said the rebels had learned ``through blood
and tears'' not to trust their enemy's promises.
   Following the election, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
ordered his troops to cease attacks on the Contras, and there have
been no major reported military confrontations since then.

<HEAD>American Bankers Association Endorses Deposit Insurance Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest banking trade group on
Friday endorsed a plan to reform deposit insurance and force
uninsured depositors to accept some losses in bank failures.
   The American Bankers Association's plan would continue $100,000
per account coverage, but it would eliminate the current de facto
practice of treating some banks as ``too big to fail.''
   Accounts over the $100,000 limit would be subject to an
immediate ``haircut'' based on the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.'s experience with past bank failures.
   The haircut would change, probably once a year. But if the plan
were in effect now, uninsured depositors would probably lose 12
cents on every dollar, the trade group estimates.
   Currently, depositors are guaranteed nothing beyond $100,000.
But, in practice, regulators have guaranteed all deposits at large
institutions because they're afraid a collapse of a major bank
would ripple through the financial system, causing runs on banks
generally.
   As a matter of fairness, regulators also usually protect all
deposits when a small institution fails.
   The American Bankers' proposal is similar to one advanced last
summer by former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman William
Issac, now a private banking consultant.
   The idea is to encourage safe banking by giving large depositors
an incentive to put their money only into sound institutions.
Reform proponents attribute at least part of the savings and loan
crisis to the fact that depositors had little reason to care
whether they're institution was well or poorly run.
   Robert Dugger, chief economist of the banking group, argued that
the reform proposal would prevent banks and S&amp;Ls from embarking on
fast-growth, risky investment strategies. The deposits wouldn't be
available to do that.
   Also, regulators, because of the threat of deposit withdrawals,
would be forced to step in immediately when a bank fails,
minimizing the losses, he said.
   However, others warn that tinkering with deposit insurance
coverage could destabilize the financial system, leaving it
vulnerable to lightning-quick runs.
   ``The signal would pass that funds over $100,000 are at risk. I
think that signal is potentially dangerous, not only for little
banks, but for big banks,'' said Kenneth Guenther, executive vice
president of a rival trade group representing smaller banks, the
Independent Bankers Association of America.
   The American Bankers' proposal, approved by the group's board of
directors and a 400-member leadership conference, is being
forwarded to the Treasury Department, which is studying deposit
insurance.
   Treasury's recommendations, due next February, are expected to
form the basis of major banking legislation in 1991.
   Deposit insurance was enacted in 1934 as part of the financial
reforms put in place after the 1929 stock market crash and the wave
of bank failures in the early 1930s.

   Thousands of teachers chanting, ``Pay
raise or strike!'' skipped school Friday for the second time in two
weeks for a protest at the Capitol over pay and benefits.
   About 5,000 teachers, their ranks swelled by members of the
United Mine Workers and other unions, rallied in a steady drizzle
on the Capitol steps, then moved inside to attend Senate and House
of Delegates floor sessions and lobby individual legislators.
   At one point, about 100 teachers surrounded Education and Arts
Secretary Steve Haid in a hallway outside the governor's office,
peppering him with questions and complaints.
   Unlike a Feb. 15 rally, in which state police were called after
teachers pounded on the House of Delegates doors and demanded to be
let in, there were no reports of trouble Friday.
   Several teachers said they are willing to strike if the
Legislature does not approve a pay raise this session, which ends
March 10.
   ``We have been ignored for many years, and we're not going to be
ignored any more,'' said Gwen Taylor, a teacher at Hurricane High
School in Putnam County.
   The West Virginia Education Association says the average West
Virginia teacher is paid $21,904, ranking the state 49th in the
nation. Teachers received a 5 percent pay raise effective last
month.
   Other concerns include pensions and health insurance.
   The association said 21 counties canceled Friday classes because
of the rally. Pickets in Mingo County turned away buses at three
schools, forcing officials to cancel classes. Two county schools
closed for the same reason on Thursday.
   Association President Kayetta Meadows complained that the state
this week granted 5 percent to 25 percent pay raises to Division of
Highways engineers, and the Legislature is considering a plan to
give state troopers raises up to $7,000 a year.
   At the same time, she said, Gov. Gaston Caperton says there's no
money for higher teacher pay.
   ``Do they think we're so dumb that we can't read the paper, that
we can't tell what's going on?'' Meadows asked.

<HEAD>Army Seeks Repayment of Scholarship That Went to Homosexual</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Army is seeking repayment of a $25,000
scholarship from a student who says he is homosexual.
   James Holobaugh, 24, won a full four-year ROTC scholarship to
attend Washington University in St. Louis and was featured in a
nationwide recruiting campaign. He was scheduled to be commissioned
an Army officer last May through the Reserve Officer Training
Corps, but after his acknowledgement, the military moved to refuse
his commission.
   Under a Department of Defense policy, homosexuals are considered
unsuitable for military service and are not permitted to serve. The
policy says their presence in the military ``would seriously impair
discipline, good order, morale and security.''
   William B. Rubenstein, a staff counsel for the Lesbian and Gay
Rights project of the American Civil Liberties Union and
Holobaugh's attorney, said Thursday it was not unusual for
homosexual cadets to be removed from the ROTC. But he said this was
the first case the ACLU knew of where the Army had asked for its
scholarship money back.
   At an informal hearing in December, the Army questioned whether
Holobaugh was masquerading as a homosexual to evade his service
obligation, Rubenstein said. After completing the ROTC program,
students commissioned as officers must serve in the military for
four years of active duty or eight years in reserves.
   In January, the Army ruled that no evidence existed that
Holobaugh was trying to evade service, Rubenstein said.
Nonetheless, the Army recommended against commissioning Holobaugh
and in favor of forcing him to reimburse the military for his
scholarship.
   The case is being reviewed by the commander of the U.S. Army
Second Region at Fort Knox, Ky.
   Holobaugh was rated one of the top performers in his ROTC class
at Washington University and was selected by the Army to be in a
nationwide advertising campaign to attract students.
   It wasn't until late 1988 or early 1989 that he realized he was
homosexual, Holobaugh said. Last April, he sought the advice of a
ROTC captain, who told him to tell the Army he was homosexual then,
rather than wait until after his commission.
   Holobaugh said he was ``appalled at the prejudice'' in the
military against homosexuals. ``It's kind of blowing my mind,'' he
said.
   He said he wanted to be an Army officer. If he cannot be
commissioned in the Army, he said, ``I will without a doubt fight
to not have to pay back my scholarship.''

   Four people pleaded guilty in the
smuggling of five illegal aliens who died of exposure to poisonous
chemicals while they were locked inside a truck trailer on a train.
   The aliens, from Mexico, Honduras and El Salvador, died Oct. 9
from inhaling Phostoxin, which had been applid to the tortilla
flour in the trailer before they boarded it, authorities said.
   They were locked inside the trailer on a flatbed rail car on a
train bound from the Lower Rio Grande Valley to Victoria, officials
said.
   The four Victoria residents pleaded guilty Thursday in U.S.
District Court in Brownsville. In exchange for the guilty pleas,
other charges in the 13-count indictment were dropped, said U.S.
Attorney John Crews.
   ``They weren't river bandits,'' Crews said. ``They were callous,
but they didn't intend to kill the aliens.''
   Eleutorio Amaya-Torres, 35, and Magdaleno Arcos-Soriano, 34,
each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to transport illegal
aliens. The charge carries a maximum punishment of five years in
prison and $250,000 in fines.
   Jane Amaya, 39, pleaded guilty to one count of tampering with a
witness, which carries the same penalties. The charges stems from
allegations the smugglers returned money to relatives of the dead
in exchange for silence.
   Mary Ann Martinez, 24, pleaded guilty to a charge of failing to
report a felony to authorities. The charge carries a maximum
penalty of three years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela set sentencing for May 15.
   A fifth person accused in the case, Renato Avila Botello,
remains at large on charges of conspiracy to transport illegal
aliens and witness tampering.

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief of the military tribunal
that condemned Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife to
death has committed suicide, Justice Minister Teofil Pop announced
Friday.
   He told a news conference Maj. Gen. Gica Popa, 57, shot himself
in the head with his standard-issue Makharov pistol at 1:15 p.m.
Thursday in his Justice Ministry office.
   The announcement coincided with the opening of the trial of 21
former secret police officers charged in connection with scores of
deaths in the December revolution that overthrew Ceausescu. The
trial is being held in downtown Timisoara, the western city where
the revolution originated.
   Pop said that Gen. Popa was rushed to the Bucharest military
hospital, where he died two hours later with his wife and daughter
by his side. The general left a suicide note that asked
forgiveness, but did not explain the motive for his act, he
reported.
   Pop called the suicide the result of a ``very grave depression.''
   But Popa's wife, Eleonora, told The Associated Press her husband
had been receiving anonymous threats ``beginning with the 25th of
December,'' the date of the Ceausescu trial.
   ``For two months, he didn't sleep in his own house,'' she said.
   She said Popa tried to discuss the threats Thursday morning with
the justice minister, but ``was turned away.''
   ``They didn't support him in any way,'' she said.
   She also said her husband wrote he was ``frustrated and scared''
in his suicide letter, which was ``taken away by the justice
minister.''
   Pop told reporters Popa had suffered serious depression related
to family problems 10 years ago. He said he recently asked Popa if
he was threatened after the trial, and the general said no.
   The justice minister said Popa, chief of the Military
Territorial Tribunal in Bucharest, ``had extraordinary prestige and
was one of our best judges.''
   He confirmed that Popa's voice was the one heard on the
video-recording of the trial of Ceausescu and his wife, Elena,
which was broadcast repeatedly on Romanian and international
television.
   The angry voice was heard interrogating the pair and then
announcing they had been sentenced to death for genocide and other
crimes against the Romanian people. The couple were subsequently
executed by firing squad. None of the military judges was shown on
the tape.
   The identity of the person speaking at the trial had not been
made public ``to protect the judges while there were still
terrorists around,'' Pop said, referring to members of Ceausescu's
secret police who fought revolutionary forces for about a week
after the dictator was toppled Dec. 22.
   The other judge at Ceausescu's trial was his deputy, Maj. Gen.
Ioan Nistor. Both Popa and Nistor were colonels at the time of the
trial, officials said.
   Three other career officers completed the five-man tribunal:
Capt. Corneliu Sorescu, Lt. Maj. Daniel Condrea, and Lt. Ion Zamfir.
   The trial was held in Tirgoviste, 45 miles northwest of
Bucharest.
   The prosecutor-general's office and police were investigating
Popa's death, officials said, without divulging more details on its
circumstances.
   In Timisoara, 180 miles west of Bucharest, armored personnel
carriers and soldiers surrounded Casa Tineretului theater, now
converted into a courtroom.
   The proceedings are the first against those suspected of trying
to crush the uprising before it spread across the country.
   The defendants, headed by Maj. Gen. Emil Macri, sat glumly in
their striped brown prison suits as the indictment was read.
   Macri and six others are charged with genocide and face life in
prison if convicted. The 14 others face up to 20 years in prison if
convicted on lesser charges stemming from the shootings of unarmed
civilians who took to the streets of Timisoara in December to
demonstrate against Ceausescu.
   In opening statements, the chief prosecutor, Col. Vasile Kozma,
said 94 people died in the Timisoara violence, 300 were injured and
20 were missing.
   Early in the revolution, reports in Timisoara spoke of up to
4,000 people dying there.
   On Friday, the ruling Provisional Council of National Unity
decided to remove the 15-foot-high bronze statue of Lenin from
northern Bucharest.
   The council, which acts like a miniparliament until May 20
elections, also expanded its membership to 259. It will absorb
three members each from the Federation of Jewish Communities in
Romania and the Democratic Romani (Gypsy) Union. About 2 million
Gypsies and 20,000 Jews live in Romania, according to official
figures.

   A retired federal judge was appointed

favoritism to developers, a special court said Friday.
   Arlin M. Adams, 68, a Philadelphia lawyer who served for 17
years on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, was sworn in
Thursday as independent counsel to investigate the allegations
against Pierce and former aides at the Department of Housing and
Urban Development.
   The appointment, made by the special three-judge panel, was
announced Friday. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh had requested
the appointment last month.
   Adams was given jurisdiction to investigate whether Pierce or
other HUD employees had ``committed the crime of conspiracy to
defraud the United States or any other federal crimes'' in the
administration of the department's Moderate Rehabilitation Program
from 1984 through 1988.
   The program qualified developers for lucrative rent subsidies
and tax breaks for performing a moderate amount of repairs on
low-income housing units.
   As a result of the HUD scandals, Congress voted not to
appropriate money for the program this year. In 1989, Congress had
appropriated $225 million, but HUD Secretary Jack Kemp suspended
the disbursement of $167 million pending a review of the grant
awards.
   Thornburgh's request to the special court said that the Justice
Department's preliminary inquiry had found reports of a
``widespread perception'' by developers and local officials that
money was awarded ``in disproportionate amounts to projects backed
by prominent Republicans acting as consultants or by former HUD
officials.''
   Adams said in an interview Friday that he was already at work on
the case. ``In these assignments, you start promptly and work very
hard,'' he said.
   ``I've called on the FBI for assistance and I have begun to make
arrangements for facilities in Washington, which will be my base,
and for staff,'' Adams said.
   He declined to estimate how long the investigation will take,
saying ``there is no deadline.''
   Robert Plotkin, one of Pierce's defense lawyers, lauded the
appointment, saying, ``We have every reason to expect that Judge
Adams will conduct the investigation in a fair and impartial
manner.''
   ``We're glad that an independent counsel has been finally
appointed and the investigation can proceed,'' Plotkin said.
   Pierce was HUD secretary throughout the eight years of the
Reagan administration, the only member of Reagan's Cabinet to stay
in office through both terms.
   The attorney general's request for an independent counsel
followed a preliminary inquiry by the Justice Department's public
integrity section into allegations of favoritism that were
presented by Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee.
   The allegations were based on hearings conducted by the House
Government Operations education and housing subcommittee into
mismanagement at HUD during Pierce's tenure.
   Thornburgh rejected the lawmakers' request for an independent
counsel to investigate allegations that Pierce had lied under oath
when he denied having ``hands on'' involvement in running the
Moderate Rehabilitation Program.
   Pierce was called back to testify on two other occasions, but
refused to answer questions, invoking his Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., who chaired last year's congressional
hearings on HUD, welcomed the appointment, saying he will meet with
Adams next Wednesday in Washington to discuss the probe.
   As Pennsylvania secretary of public welfare from 1963 to 1966,
Adams said, he examined alleged misuse of government programs.
   In a statement, the Special Division of the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals here said that Adams ``brings to this investigation the
judgment, experience and ability acquired by many years of service
as a federal circuit judge, as a private practitioner and as a
recognized leader of the courts and the bar of the nation.''
   Frank Keating, general counsel at HUD, also praised the
appointment and pledged that the department would cooperate with
the investigation.
   A Republican, Adams chaired Richard Nixon's Pennsylvania
presidential campaign in 1968. A year later, as president, Nixon
apponted Adams to the 3rd Circuit, where he sat until 1986.
   Adams was also considered for Supreme Court appointments by both
Nixon and President Ford.
   In 1988, Adams rejected overtures to be deputy attorney general
in the last days of the tenure of then-Attorney General Edwin Meese
III.

   The government will build a cathedral
in the capital to honor those who died in December's democratic
revolution, Bucharest Radio reported Friday.
   The state radio said the cathedral would be called All
Saints-St. Anastasia. The feast of St. Anastasia is celebrated in
the Romanian Orthodox church on Dec. 22, which also is the date
when longtime Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was toppled in a
popular revolution.
   The Ministry of Religious Affairs intends to build the church
near Liberty Park in southern Bucharest, a ministry official said.
   The church would be the first built in Bucharest in years.
Religious activity was suppressed under Ceausescu and 22 Romanian
Orthodox churches were pulled down in Bucharest the past six years
to make way for a huge project that included a tree-lined boulevard
and a government palace.
   In the revolution, there were reports of up to 4,000 dead in the
western city of Timisoara alone, where the uprising began.

<HEAD>High School Students Clash With Officials Over Anti-Gang Dress
Code</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALMDALE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High school students enraged by a new
anti-gang dress code boycotted classes, staged noisy demonstrations
and pelted rocks at a a sheriff's patrol car.
   Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies in this Mojave Desert
community north of Los Angeles said they arrested two students
during protests at three high schools, and were seeking two others.
   At Palmdale High, about 200 pupils staged a noisy walkout as a
ban took effect Thursday on all but official school baseball caps.
The new policy authorizes school officials to prohibit any clothing
they consider gang-oriented.
   But most students returned to classes after three hours when
police threatened arrests for disturbing the peace.
   At Antelope Valley High, hundreds of students rushed a sheriff's
sergeant who had detained four men off campus, hurled rocks and
debris at his car and chanted, ``Let Them Go,'' sheriff's Sgt. Ron
Shreves said.
   The four were not linked with the demonstrations, and were
apparently mistaken by the crowd for fellow students, Shreves said.
   The board of trustees of the Antelope Valley Union High School
District adopted the dress code last month. Students who violate
the code will be warned for a first offense, then suspended and
possibly expelled for subsequent offenses, the board said.
   ``People should be able to dress the way they want at a public
high school,'' said Scott Welcome, a 16-year-old junior at Palmdale
High.
   ``They're just trying to turn this school into a prison,'' said
Jason Oster, a 15-year-old sophomore. ``Why should we suffer for
what the gang-bangers do?''

   Police who inspected a house for a possible
burglary this week say they saw objects fly around inexplicably.
They had a priest bless the house but filed no official report on
the strange occurrences.
   Patrolman Stan Anderson and Sgt. William Clark were called to
the home after Virginia John returned from work Sunday night to
find everything in disarray.
   ``Dishes were smashed, several windows were broken, a lamp
exploded in the living room, and eggs lined up in the refrigerator
all had exploded,'' Anderson said Thursday.
   ``A vase flew across the room and two objects flew right by my
head,'' said Anderson, a 13-year veteran of the Indianapolis Police
Department.
   Residents of the house couldn't have thrown the things, he said.
   Clark said he saw a large radio leap from a desk and slide under
a bed.
   ``The house was completely destroyed,'' Anderson said. ``She
said objects had been moving around all day and strange things had
been happening.''
   The police officers called the police department chaplain, the
Rev. Wilbert A. Cunningham, and a Catholic priest who asked that
his name not be made public.
   The priest blessed the home and its occupants, which included
Ms. John's father, brother and 3-year-old son.
   ``He sprinkled holy water throughout the house while performing
the standard blessing,'' said Charles Schisla, director of the
Catholic Communications Center.
   Police said a 14-year-old relative from Puerto Rico who had been
living at the home was believed to have been involved in devil
worship. He had been sent back to Puerto Rico, said Sgt. Gregory P.
Bieberich.
   Police did not file an official report on the investigation.
   ``How would we classify this case?'' Anderson asked. ``It wasn't
a burglary, but it was close to a vandalism. Even if we could
classify it, who would we consider as a suspect _ a spirit?''
   The family could not be reached for comment Friday. Their number
is not available through directory assistance and Ms. John was not
at her job at Wishard Memorial Hospital.

<TEXT>
   Iran-Contra prosecutors moved Friday to stop a
court appeal by Richard Secord until a lower court judge decides
whether to reinstate 11 other criminal charges against him.
   Secord, a retired Air Force major general, pleaded guilty Nov. 8
to making a false statement when he told congressional
investigators he was unaware of any money that went to benefit
Oliver North.
   But Secord announced his intention to appeal after his
sentencing Jan. 24 and the government says he is trying to
circumvent his plea agreement with the government. Under that plea
agreement, the government agreed not to pursue 11 other criminal
charges against Secord.
   The appeal is based on a contention by Secord's lawyers that
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh lacks jurisdiction to prosecute
for an offense arising out of Secord's testimony to Congress.
   Iran-Contra prosecutors Feb. 5 asked U.S. District Court Judge
Aubrey Robinson to reconsider his decision dismissing the 11 other
charges.
   ``While the District Court has before it important questions
relating to the effectiveness of the plea agreement in this case,''
the appeals court proceedings should be stopped, prosecutors said
in a court filing.
   Secord agrees the appeal should be suspended until the lower
court rules, said the court filing.
   The government has said it is ``an act of bad faith'' to plead
guilty with the undisclosed intent of challenging the validity of
the plea.
   Secord, who was placed on two years' probation, paid for a
$13,800 security system at North's home out of proceeds from the
Enterprise.
   The Enterprise was the network of offshore companies and secret
accounts which Secord and business partner Albert Hakim used to
move money in the Iran-Contra affair.
   The 11 other charges against Secord included obstruction and
perjury counts based on his testimony to Congress.

<HEAD>Gun Law Crackdown Will be Mounted in 8 Cities</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal task forces to crack down on people
who violate federal gun laws calling for mandatory prison sentences
will be launched in eight cities later this month, officials said
Friday.
   The Project Achilles task forces will be in place by March 26 in
New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Detroit,
Washington and Phoenix, said Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms spokeswoman Dot Koester.
   The ATF conducted a similar, four-month Armed Career Criminal
operation in Washington last year as a prelude to the upcoming
project, and ``made quite an impact,'' she said.
   In addition to making numerous arrests, ``because they kept
hitting certain areas again and again, the neighborhood people
started coming out and cheering the agents on,'' Koester said.
   ``Out of that developed a hotline which the neighbors then used
to call us when something was going on,'' she said. ``It created a
whole new interest in the neighborhoods where we went.''
   The neighbors, she said, ``would invite (the agents) in for
coffee after they made their raids.''
   Congress last year included $4.5 million in the ATF's budget for
1990 specifically as salaries for 75 full-time workers in the
Achilles task forces in five cities, but the ATF expanded that
number to eight, said a spokesman for Sen. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., who chairs the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on
Treasury, Postal Service and General Government.
   The agents will work with state and local law enforcement
officials.
   The task forces, working for the Armed Career Criminal Program,
will be targeting people under two sections of federal law that
call for mandatory sentencing.
   One says anyone convicted of a felony crime of violence or drug
charge who is carrying a gun automatically is sentenced for at
least five years on the weapon-possession charge.
   The other section says that a person who has three previous
felony convictions for a violent crime or drug offense will be
sentenced to at least 15 years on the firearm charge.
   The task forces are being launched at the same time that ATF
faces cutbacks under the Bush administration's proposed 1991 budget
of 185 positions created by the 1990 Anti-Crime Initiative.
   The cutbacks will be required because of the need to offset
administratively uncontrolled overtime pay and inflation, according
to DeConcini's spokesman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   To cope with the additional expenses, the ATF is proposing to
reduce firearms-law enforcement personnel not specifically
connected to drug cases by 122 people next year, according to
congressional documents.

   About 200 members of a nationalist group
marched through the capital Friday to support Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki's demand that Poland take part in international
talks on a reunified Germany.
   It was the second day of such marches organized around Poland by
the Confederation for an Independent Poland.
   The group often holds demonstrations with extreme anti-communist
groups. It has been active for more than a decade, founded with the
aim to seek freedom for Poland from Moscow.
   Marchers demonstrated Thursday in Krakow and five other cities,
said leaders of the group.
   Friday's protesters in Warsaw marched to the embassies of the
four powers that occupied Germany at the end of World War II: the
United States, Soviet Union, Britain and France. They are to hold
talks with the two German states leading to reunification.
   At each embassy, marchers carried banners saying ``We Were
Cheated Once'' and ``We Don't Want a Second Yalta and Potsdam,''
referring to the 1945 conferences where the victorious Allies
agreed to change Polish borders without Poland's participation.
   Poland says it should take part in reunification talks to win a
treaty guaranteeing its present border with East Germany. Polish
officials fear a reunited Germany might press claims to Polish
lands that were transferred from Germany at the end of the war.
   On Friday, the West German government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl
offered an eventual treaty guaranteeing Poland's western border,
but it said Poland must abandon any claims to war reparations.
   The Polish government reacted sharply to the offer, saying the
two issues should not be linked.

   About 15,000 students defied rain, cold
and a ban on city marches on Friday to denounce the ruling
Communists as a ``mafia'' and demand that they step down.
   The students gathered near Vasil Levski Stadium, site of a rally
by 70,000 Communists Thursday, and then paraded 2{ miles downtown
to a square in central Sofia, shouting their support for the
democratic opposition.
   Thousands of Bulgarians along the route cheered as the students
marched past, chanting ``Down with the BKP!'' _ the initials of the
Bulgarian Communist Party _ and ``Then and now _ the Communist
Party a mafia!''
   People waved and clapped from windows and balconies. Hospital
nurses left their ward to watch the procession, punctuated by
rhythmic jumping and chanting of ``SDS!'' _ the Bulgarian
abbreviation of the opposition.
   The activists carried placards reading, ``Freedom or
Socialism,'' ``Communism is a Drug for People'' and ``The Communist
Party must go to the Belene jail'' _ an infamous prison for
political prisoners.
   Miners in 26 pits meanwhile went on strike Friday to press for a
cut in working hours and that demands made in a miners' strike in
January be fulfilled. The independent Podkrepa trade union
organized the job action.
   Strikers interviewed on state television said they wanted a
36-hour work week, and a 30-hour week for those mining for minerals
causing silicosis, a chronic lung disease caused by continued
inhalation of silica dust.
   Also Friday, Zhelyu Zhelev, leader of the Union of Democratic
Forces, called on all non-Communist groups to join a UDF conference
in Plovdiv to work out opposition strategy for the first multiparty
elections, likely by June.
   Bulgaria was known for years as one of the Kremlin's most loyal
allies, but was caught up in the reform changes sweeping Eastern
Europe and last November replaced its Communist leader, Todor
Zhivkov, after 35 years in power.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government on
Friday offered an eventual treaty guaranteeing Poland's western
border after German reunification but said Poland must abandon any
claims to war reparations.
   Such a pact also would be linked to Poland's pledge to protect
the rights of its German minority, according to West German
government spokesman Dieter Vogel.
   Polish Premier Tadeusz Mazowiecki said he was ``especially
astonished that the question of the German minority has been
brought up. We have settled this matter, and we keep our word.''
   In his his remarks on West German television, the premier added,
``There are mutual obligations here, which also concern the Polish
minority in Germany.''
   Earlier, Polish government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska
told Polish television news, ``Poland did not wish to link the
problem of treaty regulation of the border on the Oder and the
Neisse with any other problems.''
   ``But if the West German side wishes to broaden these subjects,
we will raise the problem of compensations for over a million
Polish citizens who were forced to work in the Third Reich during
World War II,'' she said.
   Kohl has come under intense criticism abroad and at home for his
stance on lands east of the Oder and Neisse rivers ceded to Poland
after Nazi Germany's 1945 defeat.
   Poland wants reassurance that a reunited Germany will not seek
to reclaim those lands, which make up one-third of present-day
Poland.
   Kohl repeatedly has said Germans have no designs on that
property, but has insisted that, legally speaking, final say can
only come from a future united German government.
   Kohl has been reluctant to run the risk of angering
arch-conservative voters needed to help his Christian Democrats win
re-election in federal elections this December.
   But at the same time, his statements have drawn negative
responses in Poland and a number of other countries, including the
United States, the Soviet Union, France and Britain.
   Kohl for the first time on Friday openly said a treaty would be
possible recognizing Poland's western border after a united Germany
government comes into being.
   But at the same time he demanded that Poland's 1953 decision on
war reparations be an element of such agreement, as well as
Poland's assurance last year that the ethnic rights of its German
minority would be guaranteed.
   In the statement delivered by Vogel, Kohl again carefully
avoided stating outright that a united Germany would never lay
claim to land ceded to Poland.
   According to Vogel, Kohl reiterated his support for both German
parliaments passing an identical declaration pledging to respect
the current borders after East Germany elects its first freely
chosen parliament on March 18.
   Vogel said ``such a declaration must at the same time make clear
that the Aug. 23, 1953, declaration of the Polish government, in
which reparations against Germany are renounced, continues
unchanged.''
   The Western powers ended reparation collections from West
Germany in 1952. The Soviet Union did the same for fellow Communist
state East Germany a year later, while Poland said it, too, would
not seek reparations.
   Vogel said that on the basis of such a border resolution by the
German parliaments, ``a treaty between an overall German government
with the Polish government should be concluded and be ratified by a
united German parliament.''
   In Poland, meanwhile, hundreds of people demonstrated in several
cities Thursday and Friday to support Mazowiecki's demand that
Poland be allowed to take part in international talks on a reunited
Germany.
   Poland says in order to win an ironclad guarantee of its western
border, it needs access to the so-called ``two-plus-four'' talks
involving West Germany and East Germany as well as the United
States, Soviet Union, Britain and France.
   In Madrid, West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
reiterated that the borders of a reunified Germany would be those
fixed at the end of World War II.
   ``We have no claims as far as Poland is concerned, not now or in
the future,'' Genscher said.
   Genscher, in Madrid to allay Spanish concerns about plans for
German unification, also said he and Kohl were in ``total accord''
on the issue.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said Secretary of State James A. Baker III sent a letter to all
NATO foreign ministers inviting their views on German reunification.
   ``As you know, all of us have agreed that Germany's continued
membership in NATO, including participation in NATO's integrated
military structure, and the continued commitment of NATO forces to
the security of Germany is of enduring importance to stability and
security throughout Europe,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   The publisher of a Las Vegas newspaper seeking
to form a joint operating agreeement with its competitor sought
Friday to prevent the disclosure of its advertising and circulation
revenues by the Justice Department.
   Donrey of Nevada Inc., publisher of the Las Vegas
Review-Journal, asked Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to
reconsider his Feb. 16 order requiring the newspaper to publicly
disclose its advertising and circulation revenues.
   Donrey, owned by the closely held Donrey Media Group, submitted
the figures ordered by Thornburgh but they were placed under seal
pending a ruling on the company's request they be kept private.
   Thornburgh, who rules on requests for joint operating
agreements, had given the company until Friday to submit the data.
   Donrey is seeking a partial merger of the Review-Journal with
the Las Vegas Sun under the anti-trust exemptions provided in the
Newspaper Preservation Act.
   Both newspapers say that the Sun, owned by the Sun Co., is in
``probable danger of financial failure'' and therefore should be
allowed to merge its production and commercial departments with the
Review-Journal.
   Donrey argued there is much financial information already on the
public record to document the Sun's claim of impending financial
trouble without disclosing ``statistical detail about the inner
workings of the Review-Journal.''
   ``Access to the aggregate revenue data, coupled with the data in
the record and the information available generally about the
economics of the newspaper business would enable a competitor or
potential competitor to make a close approximation of the single
most sensitive piece of intelligence about a closely held company:
its profits,'' the company's lawyers said in a legal brief.
   An affidavit signed by Fred W. Smith, president of Donrey Media
Group, said ``public disclosure of such information would be
detrimental and damaging to Donrey in its relationships with
customers, suppliers and labor unions and would provide an unfair
advantage to its competitors, not only in the Las Vegas market but
in the other 73 markets in 21 states in which Donrey operates.''

<HEAD>Highland Peasants Send the Heads of 13 Guerrillas to Army
Commander</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUANCAYO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Outraged Highland peasants armed with
sickles and homemade shotguns captured 13 Shining Path guerrillas,
killed them and sent their heads to the local army commander,
police said Friday.
   Police said 200 peasants who organized into a village defense
group because of their fears of reprisals by the Maoist-inspired
insurgents ambushed 20 Shining Path rebels Thursday near Cochas, a
town 30 miles northeast of Huancayo.
   Using machetes, sickles, lances and homemade shotguns, the
peasants overpowered the better-armed but outnumbered guerrillas,
capturing and decapitating nine of them.
   The incident occurred three days after peasants from the
neighboring village of Comas captured four Shining Path guerrillas,
including one woman, and cut off their heads.
   Police in Huancayo, 120 miles east of Lima, said the peasants
put the heads into bags and sent them to the provincial army
commander in Concepcion, 12 miles northwest of Huancayo. They also
sent weapons and propaganda confiscated from the rebels.
   Military officials in Concepcion would not comment.
   The civil defense groups, called ``rondas,'' are organized by
the army to defend remote villages from guerrilla incursions. Often
the peasants are armed only with crude weapons and are no match for
the guerrillas, many of whom carry automatic weapons and explosives.
   Many of the peasant groups complain they receive little support
from the army. Confrontations between the rondas and rebels have
become more frequent in recent months, and dozens have been killed
on both sides.
   The Shining Path says it wants to create a worker-peasant state
patterned on the ideas of Mao Tse-tung, but in its 10 years of
armed struggle it has not gained wide support among Peru's peasants.
   Police said the villagers in Comas and Cochas complained the
rebels had been harassing them, stealing their food and ordering
them to stop shipping farm produce to the cities.
   Part of the rebels' announced strategy is to choke off food
shipments from the Huancayo region, Peru's breadbasket, to the
population centers on the coast, mainly the capital city of Lima
and its port, Callao.
   The Shining Path guerrillas began fighting to overthrow Peru's
elected governments in 1980, launching its first attack in the
southern Andes highlands.
   The rebels now operate through most of the Andes and the
coca-producing jungles of the northeast, where drug traffickers pay
them for permission to operate.
   The guerrillas also occasionally launch attacks in Lima and
other cities along the coast where the majority of Peruvians live,
conducting hit-and-run assaults and dynamiting electrical
substations.
   The government says more than 18,000 people have died in the
decade of violence, most of them unarmed civilians.

<HEAD>Banned Parties Stage One-Day Nationwide Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A one-day nationwide strike called by two
banned political parties to press demands for multiparty democracy
ended Friday with little of the violence that marked earlier
protests.
   The strike was the second called by the Nepali Congress Party
and the Communist Party of Nepal since they began their campaign
Feb. 18 for restoration of a multiparty system in the national
Assembly.
   State-run radio reported that life was ``almost normal'' in the
Himalayan kingdom but did not elaborate.
   In Katmandu, riot police patrolled the nearly deserted streets
of the capital, shops were closed and students stayed away from
school.
   Buses leaving Katmandu were escorted by armed police in jeeps,
but few passengers traveled. Buses coming into the capital were
half-empty.
   Witnesses said demonstrators set a car on fire downtown and
smashed the windshields of some state-owned buses during the
protest, but there were no other reports of violence.
   A one-day strike called by the banned parties on Feb. 19 led to
violence throughout the country and several people were killed.
   The government says at least 12 people have died in clashes
between police and demonstrators since the protest campaign began
last month. Opposition activists say the death toll is nearly
double the government figure.
   ``The government is bent upon unleashing widespread violence to
provoke the peaceful demonstrators like they did on Feb. 19,''
Ganesh Man Singh, a top Nepali Congress Party leader who is under
house arrest, said in a telephone interview.
   A Home Ministry statement said the government ``would never lag
behind legal action against those who attempt to disrupt public
life.''
   It said communist extremists have been active in the protest
campaign.
   The banned parties are demanding the lifting of a 29-year-old
royal decree that prohibits all of the political parties in the
kingdom, one of the world's oldest monarchies.
   Membershiop in the national assembly, known as the Rashtriya
Panchayat, is non-partisan.
   Nepal's two-year experiment with Western-style democracy ended
in 1961 when King Mahendra, father of the present monarch, King
Birendra, dissolved the government of the Nepali Congress Party,
accusing it of corruption and poor administration.
   The government of King Birendra says the campaign to lift the
ban on political parties runs counter to a 1980 referendum that
narrowly retained the Rashtriya Panchayat's system of non-partisan
membership.
   It also says the country already has its own form of democracy
and does not need a multiparty system.
   Power in Nepal is shared between the king and the assembly.
One-fifth of the Panchayat's 140 members are nominated by the king
and the rest are elected.

   A skydiver who was fired at by a Secret
Service agent after parachuting into the parking lot of the hotel
where President Bush was staying may not have known the president
was in town, authorities said Friday.
   Bush was inside the Century Plaza Hotel during the episode
Thursday that ended with the arrest of Charles Sweeney, 47, of the
Los Angeles suburb of Santa Clarita.
   Sweeney, arrested at his home hours after the incident, was
booked for investigation of assault with a deadly weapon on a law
officer, said police Lt. Al Moen. He was freed on $3,000 bail on
the charge, which stemmed from alleged attempts to run down
officers in the getaway car.
   ``There was no threat to the president. He didn't know the
president was in town,'' said Secret Service Agent Jim Miller. He
said his information was based on a Los Angeles police interview
with Sweeney attended by a Secret Service agent.
   Miller said he didn't know if anyone told Bush about the
incident.
   A Secret Service agent fired two shots at the car as the man
sped away after jumping from a 36-story building under construction
near the hotel about 6 a.m. Thursday.
   After landing, Sweeney packed up his parachute, jumped into a
car and sped through the parking lot, ignoring orders to stop,
Miller said.
   ``I'd estimate there was about 60 feet of rubber. Then he made a
U-turn and headed right for the officer,'' he said. ``The agent
fired two shots and the vehicle swerved to the right and missed the
officer.''
   The parachutist, who was alone in the car, was uninjured.
   Illegal urban skydiving from highrises is an occasional practice
among some parachutists.
   Bush was in Los Angeles for two days of politicking and
anti-drug speeches before heading to Palm Springs for his summit
meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu on Friday.

   The government Friday
promised a public inquiry into why a passenger train struck a car
at a crossing northwest of Belfast, killing three people and
injuring 27.
   Two of the three cars on the Belfast-to-Londonderry train
derailed after it sliced the car in half Thursday night at the
crossing 25 miles from Belfast, police said.
   Kevin and Marion Fowler, who were in the front-seat of the car,
were crushed to death under the front of the train. Mrs. Fowler was
six months pregnant.
   Their two young sons in the back seat were badly injured and
reported in serious condition Friday at Waveney Hospital in nearby
Ballymena.
   A passenger in the train, 17-year-old Julie Rock, died after
being trapped in the wreckage for three hours. Fourteen of the 27
people injured remained hospitalized.
   It was not known why the car was on the crossing.
   Northern Ireland's transport minister, Peter Bottomley, visited
the scene of the crash and met with accident investigators. He
pledged a thorough inquiry and said its findings would be made
public.
   There have been four accidents at Northern Ireland's
grade-crossings in recent years. The mayor of Londonderry's city
council, Tony Carlin, demanded an immediate review of crossing
standards, particularly those with no gates.
   ``Obviously the time is now for an urgent review because there
cannot be a continuation without some sort of inquiry,'' he said.

<BYLINE>Hazelwood Nurses Flu While Prosecution Seeks Admission of More
Evidence

<TEXT>
   Joseph Hazelwood's flu forced
postponement of his trial Friday, while prosecutors petitioned the
judge to reject the Exxon Valdez skipper's claim that evidence
about his ship's potential sinking is irrelevant.
   Lawyers defending Hazelwood on criminal charges stemming from
the nation's worst oil spill have contended it was impossible for
the skipper to move his giant tanker off a reef once it was impaled.
   Thus, they say, it makes no difference whether he tried to move
it. They seek to bar evidence on what might have happened if the
ship moved.
   Expert witnesses have speculated that the ship could have sunk,
but the state has not yet offered specifics. The prosecution wants
to present the results of accident simulations it conducted to show
scientifically why the tanker was in danger of capsizing or sinking.
   Friday morning, the judge summoned jurors, told them of
Hazelwood's illness and ordered them to be especially careful to
avoid news reports on the case during the weekend recess. Lawyers
said Hazelwood should be ready to resume Monday.
   ``It seems we're missing the star player _ Captain Hazelwood has
the flu,'' attorney Dick Madson told Superior Court Judge Karl
Johnstone. He reported that Hazelwood got dressed to go to court,
but felt too sick to leave his hotel room.
   The 43-year-old Hazelwood from Huntington, N.Y., is charged with
criminal mischief, reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while
intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil. He could receive 7\
years in prison and fines of $61,000.
   The Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef on March 24, spilling
11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound, killing
countless birds, fish and other marine animals and blackening
hundreds of miles of rocky shoreline.
   On Friday, Johnstone told lawyers to begin thinking about jury
instructions in the case, although he said the trial's end might be
two to three weeks away.
   Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole then said he was filing a
legal memorandum asking Johnstone to admit testimony that the Exxon
Valdez might have sunk if Hazelwood had succeeded in moving the
grounded tanker.
   ``Captain Hazelwood is arguing that because it was impossible
for the Exxon Valdez to come free, there was no risk involved,''
said the memorandum. But it argued that the defense reliance on
``the impossibility doctrine'' was misplaced.
   ``The issue is not whether it was possible for the vessel to
come free, but whether Captain Hazelwood's mistakes in not
realizing the vessel was firmly aground and not recognizing the
danger in refloating were reasonable,'' the document said.
   It argued that Hazelwood made a mistake in thinking he could
remove the impaled tanker from Bligh Reef.
   ``In fact, the vessel would have sunk had Captain Hazelwood been
successful,'' Cole argued.
   A parade of prosecution experts testified this week that
Hazelwood's orders in the hour after the disaster indicated he was
trying to drive the tanker back into the sea. The skipper's lawyers
maintain he was trying to stabilize the vessel on the reef.
   The spill of crude oil killed countless birds, fish and other
marine animals and blackened hundreds of miles of rocky shoreline.
   The prosecution memo suggested that Hazelwood's intent would be
a key issue in the jury's deliberations.
   ``The state agrees that it was not Captain Hazelwood's intent to
damage property of another when he tried to remove the vessel,''
said the document. ``However, at the time he was attempting to
remove the vessel he had sufficient information to know that such
action would risk damaging property of another.''
   To be found guilty of second degree criminal mischief, the
felony, the jury must determine that Hazelwood recklessly risked
the property of another in an amount exceeding $100,000.

<HEAD>Relatives of Polish Victims Demand Truth From Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relatives of some of the 15,000 captive
Polish officers killed at Katyn and elsewhere in the Soviet Union
in World War II demonstrated at the Soviet Embassy Friday demanding
the truth about the deaths.
   Soviet Ambassador Vladimir Brovikov met with a three-member
delegation from about 40 relatives of the Katyn victims who
gathered outside the embassy gates. They gave him a letter
demanding to know how the soldiers died.
   ``We were received very kindly. The ambassador expressed
understanding for the families ... and said the Katyn crime had to
be explained thoroughly,'' said Zdzislaw Dyduch, one of the three
delegates. His father died at Katyn.
   The killing is believed to have taken place at the end of April
or early May 1940. The demonstration Friday was in preparation for
the 50th anniversary.
   The Katyn massacre was long blamed officially on Nazi Germany,
although most Poles believed it was carried out by the Soviet
secret police.
   The officers had been interned at three camps in the Soviet
Union after Poland was partioned between Nazi Germany and the
Soviet Union early in the war.
   An official panel of Polish historians agreed last year with the
popular conclusion of Soviet guilt. A parallel group of Soviet
historians has made no public assessment, saying it lacks proof.
   The invading German army found the remains of about 4,300 Polish
officers at Katyn, near Smolensk, in 1943. Nazi Germany immediately
made the crime public for propaganda purposes.
   The final resting place of the remaining officers, who had been
held at two other camps, is unknown to this day.
   ``We would like to discover the truth and for them to admit what
they have done, and apologize,'' said demonstrator Krystyna
Kryszkowiak, whose father was interned at Ostaszkow.
   Relatives of the murdered officers have formed an organization
called the Katyn Family, which has about 1,000 members in Warsaw
alone.
   ``We feel moral satisfaction that at least we can talk about it
openly now,'' said Maria Osieja, whose father was killed at Katyn.
``It is only a pity that my mother did not live to witness this.''

   Doctors said a retired naval officer
was in a coma Friday after he was shot in the head and neck during
an attack blamed on Basque separatists.
   Lt. Aureliano Rodriguez, 65, was shot Thursday by two men
outside his home in this northern Basque city. Police suspect the
attackers belong to the armed Basque separatist group ETA, Spanish
National Radio said.
   Rodriguez suffered brain damage and remained in ``very serious''
condition after five hours of surgery, doctors said at San
Sebastian hospital.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people
in its 21-year-old drive for independence of the three-province
Basque region.
   A single ETA member is believed to have mailed four package
bombs this week, including those that seriously wounded a national
court judge Tuesday and an employee at Madrid's main post office
the next day, the daily El Pais said.
   The initials ETA stand for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language.

<TEXT>
   A strong aftershock to this week's big
Southern California earthquake triggered rock slides onto a
mountain road, forced evacuation of a college dormitory and jarred
already tense nerves.
   The morning tremor, which measured 4.7 on the Richter scale, was
widely felt in Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego
counties. It also shook Orange County three hours before President
Bush delivered an anti-drug address there.
   ``It was scary and I'm shaking. But nothing fell or flew this
time,'' said Melina Manning of Ontario, two miles south of the
epicenter near Upland, which is 35 miles east of Los Angeles.
   ``It was mild compared to the other day but very scary,
especially because your nerves are shot from the other day,'' Ms.
Manning said.
   In addition to the big aftershock, which struck at 9:26 a.m., at
least two other noticeable temblors were recorded Friday, according
to scientists at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   They measured 2.5 and 2.4 on the Richter scale and were among
dozens of aftershocks to rattle Southern California since
Wednesday, when the region was hit by a 5.5-magnitude quake
centered three miles northwest of Upland.
   Wednesday's quake, the biggest to hit the region in more than
two years, toppled scores of chimneys, shattered hundreds of
windows and collapsed one building's wall. Nobody was killed but
the big quake did at least $12.7 million in damage in the largely
residential region that straddles the Los Angeles and San
Bernardino county lines east of the city.
   Friday's tremor caused rock slides that closed two sections of
little-traveled Mount Baldy Road, in the mountains about 35 miles
northeast of downtown Los Angeles, said Anthony Hughes of the
California Department of Transportation.
   Students were evacuated from a dormitory at La Verne University
after the jolt ruptured a natural gas line, said assistant La Verne
City Manager Jeff Allred. Several water lines elsewhere in the city
a few miles from the epicenter also broke, he said.
   In Pomona, the landmark First Baptist Church, already hard-hit
by Wednesday's quake, may have sustained more damage Friday, Police
Sgt. Ron McDonald said.
   Engineers were examining the bell tower and support columns of
the church, which was built in 1910, McDonald said.
   Los Angeles County declared an emergency that made all cities
eligible for state emergency assistance, said Constance Romero,
assistant manager of the county's Office of Emergency Management.
The proclamation also could allow victims to apply for Small
Business Administration loans or property tax relief, Romero said
Friday.
   Wednesday's quake spurred renewed calls for Californians to
prepare for the so-called ``Big One,'' a catastrophic earthquake
measuring between 7.5 and 8 on the Richter scale of ground motion.
A 1988 U.S. Geological Survey report said there is a 60 percent
chance of a quake that size on the southern San Andreas Fault by
the year 2018.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. An earthquake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable
damage and a 6 can cause severe damage.
   The earthquake that did widespread damage in the San Francisco
Bay area in October measured 7.1 on the Richter scale. The great
San Francisco quake of 1906, which occurred before the Richter
scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter scale.

   Paramilitary troops broke up
peaceful protests Friday with tear gas and smoke grenades, and
students retaliated by hurling firebombs, stoning cars and looting
a supermarket.
   Hundreds of civil servants went on strike and joined university
students outside downtown ministry offices yelling: ``Houphouet:
thief! Houphouet: corrupt!''
   Prices for coffee and cocoa, this West African country's two
primary exports, surged Friday in London and New York exchanges as
traders worried about the unrest and fears of a general strike.
   Demonstrators calling for President Felix Houphouet-Boigny to
step down pose the strongest challenge the 84-year-old leader has
faced since he took control of this nation of 11 million when it
gained independence from France in 1960.
   The government announced Friday evening it was closing all
schools and the university in Abidjan, along with boarding school
dormitories and student residences.
   University students have been boycotting classes since they
began protesting Feb. 19, and pupils from schools joined them in
demonstrations Friday morning.
   Hundreds of university students packed their belongings and
waited for taxis after the government said it was closing schools
for ``security concerns'' and that police would enforce the decree.
A few armed soldiers and police stood about, but no violence was
seen.
   The government accused an unidentified ``group of individuals''
of ``spreading trouble'' and said students responsible for
vandalism would be ``severely punished'' under the law.
   The student protests have gained support since the government
proposed pay cuts and higher taxes to defuse an economic crisis
that has grown over the past 10 years.
   The recession came with slumping prices of cocoa, Ivory Coast's
main export. The Ivory Coast is the world's largest producer of
cocoa and fifth-largest producer of coffee.
   Student protesters also blame lavish lifestyles of government
officials and corruption. They are demanding the repatriation of
millions of dollars they charge have been skimmed from state
coffers and banked abroad.
   A similar call was made this week by the General Union of
Workers. The usually docile federation is affiliated with the
ruling Democratic Party but is posing unprecedented opposition to
the proposals to cut civil servants' salaries by 15 percent to 40
percent and increase a tax on all wage earners from 1 percent to 11
percent.
   The civil servant strike has put even more pressure on
Houphouet-Boigny, who already had postponed from Friday to Monday a
National Council meeting to discuss the austerity measures.
   World Bank officials say the government has little choice but to
carry them out. In addition to a foreign debt of $12 billion,
unserviced since 1987, the government has run up an internal debt
of more than $14 million.
   In London, cocoa prices went up from $1,052 a ton two weeks ago,
to $1,127.44 a ton Thursday and $1,183.81 Friday. Cocoa futures
sold in New York ended $35 to $50 higher for March delivery at
$1,123 a ton.
   Futures in coffee settled 2.25 cents to 5 cents higher at 99
cents a pound.
   Brokers were reported concerned about the delivery of Ivory
Coast's 800,000-ton crop of cocoa _ nearly a third of world
supplies. It has nearly all been sold and awaits delivery.
   The worst violence Friday was in Yopougon, a working-class
suburb seven miles from downtown where the protests began Feb. 19.
   A peaceful protest by several hundred students and civil
servants in the city center was halted by paramilitary forces who
fired tear gas and smoke grenades.
   Witnesses said students then hurled homemade firebombs at police
who attacked with tear gas and smoke grenades. Reporters at the
scene later found burned tires and shards of glass from stoned cars
and buses.
   Protesters who may have been joined by criminals also ransacked
a Yopougon supermarket, smashing its windows with rocks while the
store was closed for the lunch-hour siesta.
   Women with stalls nearby blamed ``thugs and hooligans.''
   Youths from high schools, wearing distinctive khaki pants and
navy skirts, stoned cars on a highway into the city after they fled
tear-gas grenades. Police and soldiers dispersed them with tear
gas, a stun grenade and smoke grenades.
   Paramilitary forces also used tear gas and smoke grenades to
break up other protests in at least four suburbs of the capital.
   Banks and other businesses closed Friday, and it was not clear
whether more workers were joining the strike. Many of the cities
open-air markets were shut. Others did a half-hearted business.

   American business leaders said Friday they
expected no major breakthrough on contentious trade issues in the
weekend talks between President Bush and Japanese Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu.
   However, they held out hope that the discussions could set the
stage for a full-fledged trade summit between the two leaders later
in the year.
   The hastily arranged two days of talks between Bush and Kaifu in
Palm Springs, Calif., were being viewed by many industry officials
as a promising development for separate trade talks which had
bogged down in recent weeks.
   The talks, known as the Structural Impediments Initiative, aimed
to attack the underlying causes of the huge $49 billion trade
imbalance between America and Japan by dealing with such areas as
Japan's exclusionary business practices and America's low savings
rate.
   However, the discussions so far have produced no movement and
American negotiators were openly pessimistic about the chances of
success following the conclusion of the third round of talks last
week in Tokyo.
   Economists of all persuasions and the Bush administation agree
that even if Japan eliminated all restrictive practices about which
the United States has complained, most of the $49 billion imbalance
would remain because of the American appetite for Japanese cars,
electronic equipment and other goods.
   Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of
Manufacturers, the largest trade group for U.S. manufacturing
companies, said Bush deserved a lot of credit for trying to get the
stalled discussions back on track.
   ``Bush has put his prestige on the line to emphasize the
importance of these talks,'' Jasinowski said. ``We were dead in the
water and this is an opportunity to breathe some life back into the
effort.''
   Jasinowski said that while the meeting between Bush and Kaifu
was not expected to resolve any of the major issues between the two
countries it would serve to highlight the importance both leaders
saw in making progress.
   He said Kaifu may offer at the session to appoint a high-level
official of his government to oversee the discussions in Japan and
to coordinate responses in the massive Japanese bureaucracy.
   He said another possible outcome was agreement by both Bush and
Kaifu to meet again in the fall for a longer session examining the
whole range of trade disputes between the two countries.
   Separately from the summit, in addition to the review of
underlying trade barriers, there are talks about specific products
which the Bush administration has charged are being unfairly
restricted. These talks cover American lumber products,
supercomputers and satellites.
   John Swenson, a spokesman for Cray Research Inc., the leading
manufacturer of supercomputers, said his company had heard of no
breakthrough in the discussion on supercomputers.
   A congressional source, who spoke on condition that his name not
be used, said that Kaifu was expected to announce on Saturday lower
tariffs on a portion of U.S. finished wood products although the
reduction would cover only a small portion of U.S. lumber sales to
Japan.
   William Archey, top trade expert at the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, said that Kaifu would be following the pattern of past
Japanese leaders if he offered small concessions in trade.
   ``The historical approach of other Japanese heads of government
has been to offer these limited morsels. We then get excited
because they threw us a nibble,'' he said.
   Pressure is growing in Congress to see results in the Japanese
discussions.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, in a
letter to Bush last week urged the president ``to press (Kaifu)
with all the formidable persuasion at your command to open the
Japanese market.''
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont. and the chairman of a Senate trade
subcommittee, prepared legislation that would force the
administration to retaliate if there has been no progress by the
June 16 deadline in the talks covering wood, supercomputers and
satellites.
   Baucus scheduled a hearing of his subcommittee for Monday at
which time various administration witnesses were scheduled to
appear to report on the developments in the discussion to date.

   Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash told reporters that
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar found out after four days
of U.N.-sponsored direct talks ``that both sides are not ready to
proceed on these talks because of several difficulties.''
   Denktash said his demand for self-determination for the Turkish
Cypriots on the northern part of the Mediterranean island was not
why the talks collapsed.
   He called that ``an excuse created by the Greek Cypriot side''
led by Cypriot President George Vassiliou.
   ``The same game which has been played over the years, having
talks, continuing talks, and then destroying it and saying the
Turks are guilty,'' Denktash said.
   Earlier, Vassiliou reported no progress in the talks. When asked
if the talks were near collapse, he responded by saying: ``Did the
talks start?''
   The two sides have met four times since the first round of talks
under U.N. auspices in August 1988.
   Cyprus has been divided since the Turkish army invaded in 1974
following a short-lived, Athens-backed coup by supporters of union
with Greece. The Turks seized the northern third of the island.
   The General Assembly has recognized the Greek Cypriot side as
Cyprus' legitimate government. Only Turkey recognizes the breakaway
Turkish Cypriot region.

   A lawyer representing 7-year-old
Hilary Foretich, the American girl caught up in an international
custody battle, obtained an injunction Friday to prevent broadcast
of a TV documentary on her.
   In Washington, a three-judge appeals court panel ruled Friday
that Hilary's mother, plastic surgeon Elizabeth Morgan, can have
her passport back so she can come here to fight a lawsuit filed by
her former husband.
   Morgan went to prison for 25 months for refusing to reveal
Hilary's whereabouts and refusing to comply with a court order
allowing the father, dentist Eric Foretich, unsupervised visits
with his daughter.
   Morgan contended that the girl was sexually abused by Foretich
during their marriage. He denied it and claimed Morgan was mentally
ill. Morgan and Foretich separated before Hilary was born.
   Christchurch lawyer Peter Woolley said he asked the High Court
to bar the TV program from being broadcast on instructions from
Isobel Mitchell, the lawyer appointed to represent Hilary's
interests.
   Television New Zealand (TVNZ) has not decided whether it will
appeal the decision that kept it from presenting ``Hilary's in
Hiding'' on Friday night on its ``Foreign Correspondent'' program.
   In granting the temporary injunction, the judge ruled that
showing the TV documentary could amount to a case of invasion of
privacy.
   He noted that the application for an injunction was supported by
an affidavit from Foretich, who is now in New Zealand.
   ``I look with some degree of suspicion as to what is said by
either parent at this present stage in relation to this dispute
where it appears that both parents have for some years participated
in a public exposure to the news media of allegations and
counterallegations in their disputed claims for custody of the
plaintiff (Hilary),'' the judge said.
   Foretich traced his daughter to Christchurch last week. The girl
has been living there with her maternal grandparents for nearly two
years and attending school under the assumed name of Ellen Morgan.
   The District of Columbia Court of Appeals panel released
Morgan's pasport on Friday, freeing her to travel to New Zealand to
visit Hilary.
   Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon had seized the passport in
August 1987 when he jailed Morgan for failing to reveal Hilary's
whereabouts.
   On Thursday, Dixon said he was satisfied the return of the
passport was ``in the best interests'' of the little girl. He
noted, however, that Morgan remained in contempt of court.

<HEAD>Norwegian Study: Coffee Drinking Increases Risk of Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy coffee drinking, especially by men,
increases the risk of dying from heart disease, according to a
Norwegian study published Friday in the British Medical Journal.
   The study of 38,564 men and women by the National Health
Screening Service in Norway found that coffee drinking by men was
``significantly related'' to death from coronary heart disease,
even after allowing for other important risk factors such as heavy
smoking and high blood pressure.
   Women were at risk but to a lesser extent, the researchers said.
   Heavy coffee drinkers had higher levels of cholesterol than
those who drank moderately, but the researchers concluded that
``coffee may affect mortality from coronary heart disease over and
above its effects in raising cholesterol concentrations.''
   The Norwegian researchers studied 19,398 men and 19,166 women
ages 35 to 54 from 1977 to 1982. They reported no symptoms of
cardiovascular disease or diabetes and later were followed until
the end of 1986.
   During the follow-up period, 168 men and 16 women died of
coronary heart disease, the researchers said.
   Of the men, 130 drank between five and nine cups of coffee a
day. There were six deaths among men who drank one or two cups a
day and three deaths among men who drank less than one cup, the
study found.
   Among women, the researchers said, an excess risk was found only
for those who drank seven or more cups of coffee every day.
   The researchers said the major uncertainty in previous studies
has been whether the apparent relation between coffee and death
from coronary heart disease might be caused by lifestyle.
   A related study showed that dietary habits and lifestyle could
not explain the association of coffee and cholesterol. The
researchers said a follow-up study relating dietary habits and
lifestyle to death from coronary heart disease has not yet been
done.
   ``We conclude that coffee consumption is fairly strongly related
to death from coronary heart disease, but a potential causal role
is weakened by the varying strength of the relation in different
groups,'' the researchers said.
   ``To verify the observed effect of coffee on deaths from
coronary heart disease over and above the effect on cholesterol
concentration, cholesterol concentration must be determined more
accurately than by a single measurement,'' they said.
   The researchers from the National Health Screening Service were
epidemiologist Aage Tverdal, research fellow Inger Stensvold,
deputy director Dr. Per Lund-Larsen and director Dr. Kjell
Bjartveit. Kari Solvoll of the Institute of Nutrition Research and
Dr. Olav P. Foss, deputy director of Ulleval Hospital, Central
Laboratory also participated.

<HEAD>Auditors Cite Risk of Earthquake Damage at Nuclear Arms Site</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Savannah River nuclear weapons plant in
South Carolina is inadequately protected against severe earthquakes
and won't be fully protected for several years, federal auditors
said Friday.
   The report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress, said the vulnerability to earthquake damage at
Savannah River has been known for many years. But it said the
government only recently made serious corrective efforts.
   The plant, situated along the Savannah River near Aiken, has
nuclear reactors to produce tritium, a radioactive gas needed to
make nuclear warheads. The installation also contains other
nuclear-related buildings, including a fuel processing center for
the Navy and a radioactive waste treatment building.
   The three reactors have been closed for nearly two years because
of safety problems. One of the three is expected to resume
production by the end of this year.
   The auditors, in a report requested by Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla.,
chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on the
environment and energy, said seismic improvements at Savannah River
would not be completed for several years.
   Planning of improvements is under way, but ``it will take
several years to accomplish adequate seismic protection at Savannah
River,'' the report said.
   ``Numerous systems and structures in the reactors and other
nuclear facilities may not withstand the worst earthquake
reasonably expected at the site and, in the event of such an
earthquake, could threaten employees and the public with releases
of radiation,'' the report said.
   Catherine Kaliniak, an Energy Department spokeswoman, said the
department had not seen the report and would not comment until it
had reviewed the conclusions.
   The earthquake potential at Savannah River is based mainly on
the fact that a large earthquake _ estimated to have been the
equivalent of about 7 on the Richter scale _ occurred in South
Carolina in 1886. It was centered about 80 miles from where the
weapons plant now stands, and it caused extensive damage and loss
of life.
   The San Francisco earthquake last October was measured at about
7.1 on the Richter scale.
   Each whole number increase on the Richter scale means an ground
motion increase by a factor of 10.

<TEXT>
   People gathered Friday at Fowle's Soda
and Cigar could say this much about their two decades of opposition
to the Seabrook nuclear power plant: Popular sentiment doesn't
always win, but it dies hard.
   ``It's frustrating to fight the odds, but we think of the
children and then keep on,'' said David MacWhinnie, a longtime
resident who stopped off at the store Friday to reminisce about
past battles over the plant 6 miles up the coast and wonder what
the future holds.
   Over the years, a vocal core of citizens in about a half-dozen
cities clustered around the New Hampshire border have signed
petitions, held bake sales and marched against the plant.
   But despite their protests, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
approved licensing for the reactor.
   The federal panel's long-awaited decision Thursday came as no
surprise to residents here. Some have supported the facility, whose
start-up is 11 years behind schedule, and the promise of clean and
efficient energy for 1 million homes.
   ``The government wants to do it, so we have to put up with it,''
said Everett Bridges, 87.
   For others, the fight continues. Opponents, including officials
of the state of Massachusetts, have pledged to appeal the decision
in the courts.
   ``We never got a vote or any influence,'' said Jane Wickers, one
of a few dozen regulars gathered for morning coffee at Fowle's, a
fixture here since 1940. ``You start to feel like you can't make
any difference ... but you've got to try.''
   People around here say they don't regard themselves as the
protesting kind. They live quietly in old coastal towns where
boarded up ice cream stands are part of the off-season charm.
   No one much wants to get arrested or stand with picket signs in
the shadow of Seabrook, which is perched on a bluff over one of
several popular summertime beaches.
   But many citizens have joined the Clamshell Alliance and have
been united since the early 1970s behind an anti-nuclear banner.
They say the government hasn't established an effective evacuation
plan and fear there would be chaos on the narrow streets out of
town if a nuclear emergency occurred.
   ``Seabrook has been the acid test for the national agenda for
nuclear power,'' said James Dougherty, a vocal Newburyport realtor
and father of two. ``We are the caretakers of our own safety. ...
We have to keep driving the issue.''
   Seabrook was proposed in 1972 as a twin-reactor plant costing
less than $1 billion. Construction delays and cost increases forced
the cancellation of one reactor in the mid-1980s and plunged lead
owner Public Service Co. of New Hampshire into bankruptcy
reorganization in 1988.
   The plant became a symbol of the anti-nuclear movement, and its
foes claimed a broader victory, contending that no utility would
now risk the costs of trying to build and open another nuclear
plant.
   In the early going, a lot of area residents saw a silver lining
in the Seabrook plan. There was talk of new jobs, lower taxes and
cheaper energy.
   And some people still stand by those things.
   ``I live right here on the beach,'' said Diane Burke of
Seabrook, N.H. ``I prospered when the nuke was being built and I
think a lot of locals felt that was good. I still don't really see
the problem.''
   Burke and other proponents said they might feel differently if
an accident occurred, but for now they're willing to wait and see.
   Diehard opponents said, however, they would not willing to
concede defeat despite the NRC's decision. Massachusetts Attorney
General James Shannon has promised to take the activists' case to
the courts.
   ``It's begun to wear people down. Life has to go on. You can't
just keep picketing,'' said Marie Capello, a Seabrook resident.
   But she said she would probably end up doing just that.
   ``We've been trying to buck something so big and so powerful _
not only the plant itself but all the muckety-mucks who run it,''
she said. ``But I don't see how I can stop doing any little thing
until the bitter end.''

<HEAD>Weicker Running As Independent For Governor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDD EVERHART</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Republican Sen. Lowell P. Weicker
Jr., the maverick lawmaker who made a career of bucking his party
and championing liberal causes, said Friday he would run for
governor of Connecticut as an independent.
   ``You're going to get one hell of a race,'' declared the former
three-term senator. ``I think I'm going to win it. I don't think
it's any gamble at all.''
   Weicker, 58, told reporters, supporters and onlookers in a
packed Capitol conference room that his unsuccessful bid for a
fourth Senate term in 1988 ``took me down a peg or two and probably
deservedly so. I've taken my licks.''
   ``It's now 1990 and I believe that, as never before, we need
each other,'' he said.
   The announcement capped weeks of intense speculation about
Weicker, who in 28 years of political activity cultivated a
reputation for aggressive, independent Republicanism.
   He became a national figure in the mid-70s as one of the first
Republicans to take on President Richard M. Nixon during the
Watergate scandal.
   Weicker would say nothing negative about Democratic Gov. William
A. O'Neill or Rep. Bruce A. Anderson, a four-term congressman
challenging O'Neill for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.
Nor would he criticize any of the four Republicans now in the
running.
   Weicker was elected to the Senate in 1970 in a three-way race in
which the Democrats were badly split. Of his bid to make it a
three-way race in the November election, he said: ``The ironies are
not lost on me, I can assure you.''
   Weicker said he expects he'll need campaign funds of $1 million
or $2 million, less than half of what the other major party
candidates are talking about spending. The Greenwich millionaire
said he wouldn't spend any of his own money on the race.
   Democrats hailed his decision to run, saying it would divide the
GOP and throw the party into chaos. State GOP Chairman Richard
Foley said that with Weicker's announcement, ``the race is over. We
just won,'' but his voice didn't carry conviction.

   The swimsuit worn by Marilyn Monroe in the 1954
movie ``There's No Business Like Show Business'' sold for $5,810 in
London Thursday at an auction to help Vietnamese boat people, the
organizers reported.
   Rock singer Elton John, who collects such stage and movie items,
donated the black-sequined swimsuit to the auction of show business
memorabilia.
   The event raised more than $19,920 to help Vietnamese boat
people held in camps in Hong Kong, the charity Rock Against
Repatriation reported.
   Model Jerry Hall, the girlfriend of Rolling Stones singer Mick
Jagger, was the auctioneer for the event.
   The auction was held at Sticky Fingers, a cafe owned by Bill
Wyman, another member of the Rolling Stones, in west London's swank
Kensington district.
   The swimsuit was bought by a record company promoting the music
career of a 22-year-old Monroe lookalike, Pauline Bailey.
   Rock Against Repatriation was launched by guitarist Steve
Hackett of the rock group Genesis to raise money for boat people.
   The group, which recently released a single of the old Rod
Stewart hit ``Sailing'' for the appeal, opposes the British
government's policy of forced repatriation of the boat people to
Vietnam. The policy has been temporarily suspended following
objections from Vietnam, the United States and elsewhere.

   Here is a look at Greyhound Lines Inc., the Dallas-based company
that operates the only nationwide bus system. The company's 6,300
drivers are on strike principally over wage issues.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HISTORY:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Greyhound Lines Inc. is the descendant of a bus operation that
began in 1914 when Swedish immigrant Carl Eric Wickman established
the Jitney Line in Hibbing Minn., charging 25 cents for a round
trip on the company's lone Hubmobile between Hibbing and the Alice
saloon.
   The current company was formed in 1987 through a leveraged
buyout of the bus operations of Phoenix-based Greyhound Corp. Fred
G. Currey, a career bus executive, led an investment group that
paid $270 million for Greyhound. Four months later, Currey's GLI
Holding Inc. bought Trailways Lines Inc. of Dallas for $80 million
and merged the two bus lines.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>UNIONS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Most of the company's 11,825 employees are represented by the
striking Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions. The union
has all 6,300 drivers, plus 1,660 office workers and 1,475
maintenance workers. There are another 690 maintenance employees
represented by the International Association of Machinists, who
agreed to a four-year contract last fall. The United Auto Workers
also represents employees at the company's Eagle Bus Manufacturing
Inc. in Brownsville, Texas. There are 1,700 employees not subject
to collective bargaining.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>STRIKE ISSUES:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The main issue revolves around pay. Before Currey's group bought
the company in 1987, the union agreed to a 22 percent wage cut,
although the company says its drivers are the highest paid in the
industry, except for some small regional companies in the Northeast.
   The company says drivers averaged $24,743 in 1989, a $1,080
increase over 1987. The 1,500 highest paid averaged $33,218 and its
highest paid driver made $48,800.
   Greyhound says its offer would give drivers a $14.1 million, or
6.9 percent, raise in the first year and 13.5 percent over the life
of the 3-year contract.
   The union says those figures are misleading, because of the
inclusion of incentive bonuses. The union claims its offer would
cost $17 million in the first year and $15 million each of the next
two years. The company, however, says the union's offer would cost
more than $200 million.
   Other issues involve pension plan contributions, and regional
pay rates for mechanics.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>OPERATIONS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Greyhound operates three businesses: intercity passenger
service, charter service and small package delivery. Its 3,938
buses serve about 9,500 locations, and are the only public
intercity transportation in about 9,000 of those areas.
   The company says it has improved each year since the buyout,
with revenue passenger miles, the most meaningful traffic measure,
rising from 6.09 billion in the year before the buyout to 7.48
billion last year. In all, about 22 million passengers traveled an
average of 335 miles each on Greyhound last year.
   The company says its traffic has grown faster than other modes
of transportation, up 9.8 percent last year, versus 4.3 percent for
cars, 4.2 percent for Amtrak and a 0.1 percent loss for airlines.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FINANCES:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   After losing $20 million in its first two year, Greyhound
expects a $730,000 profit for 1989 on $1 billion in revenue.
   The company has about $340 million in long-term debt, but no
significant principal payment due until 1992. Greyhound plans to
spend $103 million over the next three years to upgrade equipment
and terminal operations. Capital expenditures have totaled $183
million in the last three years.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department filed a
sex-discrimination lawsuit Thursday to try to force the all-male
Virginia Military Institute to admit women.
   Federal authorities filed the lawsuit on behalf of an
unidentified female high school student from northern Virginia who
complained last spring that she had been prohibited from attending
the 150-year-old, state-supported school in nearby Lexington.
   The lawsuit argues that the school's male-only admission policy
violates the Civil Rights Act and the 14th Amendment. It urges the
U.S. District Court in Roanoke to order the state of Virginia and
the school ``to remedy fully their discriminatory policies and
practices.''
   The Justice Department also is reviewing complaints from two
women who want to attend The Citadel in Charleston, S.C., the
nation's only other public military college that admits males only.
   Among those named in the lawsuit were Virginia Gov. L. Douglas
Wilder and the state Council of Higher Education, along with the
institute's superintendent, John W. Knapp, and board of visitors
president, Joseph M. Spivey.
   The Justice Department wrote Wilder and Knapp last March warning
them they would face a lawsuit if they did not agree by Feb. 20 to
begin admitting women.
   But state Attorney General Mary Sue Terry and the school's
private fund-raising organization came back with two lawsuits
asking the federal court in Roanoke to declare the college's
admission policy constitutional.
   The Justice Department also filed motions Thursday asking the
court to dismiss the lawsuits filed by the state and the foundation.
   Spokesman Tom Joynes said school officials would have no comment
on the federal government's action. The governor's and state
attorney general's offices both declined to comment.
   The lawsuit said the institute is a public body and ``the
defendants have engaged in discrimination on the basis of sex'' by
refusing to consider qualified females for admission to the
four-year undergraduate degree program.
   The institute received $11 million in state aid this year,
almost half of its $25 million budget.
   Congress decided in 1976 to begin admitting women to the federal
service academies.
   All of the school's 1,200 cadets live in a three-story dormitory
in spartan rooms with standardized cots, shelves and desks. They
wake to reveille and shower in common stalls. Freshmen, referred to
as ``rats'' by other students, go through a year's initiation of
psychological and physical pressure.
   The VMI foundation lawsuit argued that ``the forced admission of
women will eliminate the option of a unique undergraduate
experience for men, while providing no increased educational
opportunities for women.''

<TEXT>
   Crack cocaine dealers have put out
a $10,000 ``contract'' to kill anti-drug crusader C.W. Roddy, a
60-year-old woman shot in an attack at her home New Year's Day, the
FBI said Friday.
   Roddy, who has been speaking out against drugs at schools and
urging police to rid her neighborhood of crack dealers, said she
asked the FBI to make the latest threat public.
   The small woman defiantly refused to move from her home and
promised to continue fighting drug dealers.
   ``I have no fear. I am concerned, but I am not fearful,'' Roddy
said at the FBI news conference in front of City Hall. ``It won't
do them any good to kill me.
   ``There are people in the community and the surrounding
communities who have decided they are going to speak out against
drugs. And if they kill me that will just (put) more pressure on
the people who are picking up the baton, so to speak,'' she said.
   William E. Smith, who heads the FBI's Palo Alto office, said the
agency and the nearby Menlo Park Police Department received
information there was a $10,000 contract on Roddy's life because of
her anti-drug efforts.
   ``The contract was put out by those involved in drug activity in
and around this particular city,'' Smith said. ``They're street
dealers. We're talking about local talent.''
   The FBI _ which got the tip more than a week ago _ is working
with local authorities because of the violation of Roddy's civil
rights.
   In the New Year's Eve attack, gunmen sprayed her small stucco
home with at least 35 rounds of semiautomatic weapons fire, but the
retired telephone company worker suffered only a minor wound to her
abdomen.
   For two years, Roddy has complained about drug dealers in the
neighborhood where she's lived for 22 years. She appealed to the
City Council repeatedly and even ordered dealers to move their cars
away from her home.
   News of the shooting brought promises of manpower and money to
help local police cope with pushers in the drug-plagued and
financially strapped community. Members of the Guardian Angels
crime-fighting group have been standing watch outside her home.
   East Palo Alto Police Chief Dan Nelson said investigators have
pursued a number of leads in the attack. His department put up a
$5,000 reward and San Mateo County added $5,000 to the pool.
   ``So far we've had zilch information,'' Nelson said.
   ``We've had fairly decent leads,'' Smith said. ``The difficulty
we've had is this community has been paralyzed by the drug activity
and the fear of coming forward.''
   The FBI's Smith appealed for help from the public, adding he was
appalled that ``someone would have the audacity to say they're
going to take the life ... of a 60-year-old woman who says, `this
is my right, don't sell drugs in front of my home, my kids, my
nieces, they have a right to feel free from drug activity.' I think

   Nelson said his department and the Menlo Park Police are
patrolling Roddy's block as much as possible, and he has given her
a police radio for her home.

   A winter storm brought rain and snow to northern and central
California and snow to the Sierra Nevada on Friday, while rain fell
across much of the South.
   Snow was expected to continue into Saturday in the Sierra range
in California and Nevada, with winter storm warnings posted
overnight and accumulations up to 18 inches forecast for some spots.
   Rain extended from southern Oregon across the northern half of
California.
   A few snow flurries fell in northern Michigan.
   In the South, rain fell across a broad area from northern
Mississippi and Tennessee east to northern Florida, the Carolinas
and Virginia.
   The weather front that brought the rain was forecast to move out
toward the Atlantic Saturday, leaving sun in its wake in the South
but bringing rain to most of the East Coast.
   Residents of Valdez, Alaska, finally got a break from unusually
heavy snow that piled up 21 inches deep on Thursday. The season's
accumulation is 40 feet.
   It was a cold February in Nome, Alaska, even by Nome standards.
The average temperatures was 21 degrees below normal, and the low
dipped to 10 below zero every day but one.
   The Northeast was unseasonably warm Friday. The high temperature
in St. Johnsbury, Vt., was 52 degrees, breaking by three degrees a
record that had stood since 1902.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 17 at
International Falls, Minn., to 81 degrees at Key West, Fla.
   The low temperature for the nation Friday was 2 degrees below
zero at West Yellowstone, Mont.

   Nelson Mandela on Friday took over the
second most senior post in the guerrilla-backed African National
Congress after a two-day meeting of the organization's top
policy-making body.
   The 35-member national executive committee said it elected
Mandela as deputy to President Oliver Tambo, who is recuperating
from a stroke in a Swedish clinic.
   The statement said the committee resolved to make contact with
the South African government to settle dates and details for a
preliminary meeting to clear obstacles in the path of full-scale
constitutional negotiations.
   The ANC also indicated it was concerned about Mandela's health,
and would be selective about accepting foreign trips and future
engagements for the 71-year-old black nationalist leader.
   Mandela, along with fellow longtime political detainees Walter
Sisulu and Govan Mbeki, resumed seats on the national executive
they held when they were arrested more than two decades ago, said
the statement read at a news conference by acting President Alfred
Nzo.
   Nzo said the ANC leaders, meeting with Mandela for the first
time since President F.W. de Klerk lifted a 30-year ban on the ANC
on Feb. 2, also decided to open headquarters offices in
Johannesburg, South Africa immediately.
   While the ANC was outlawed in South Africa its political and
guerrilla leaders have operated their headquarters from Zambia.
   Asked to elaborate on his new role in the ANC, Mandela was
non-commital.
   ``I am prepared to serve in any role the national executive
instructs me to fill,'' said Mandela, who was freed Feb. 11 after
27 years in prison.
   He said he was optimistic about a political settlement but said
he was unwilling to predict any time frame for negotiations or the
return of exiles.
   ``We are already making progress. There is no reason why we
should not be able to make further progress,'' he said. ``I am
optimistic that the process of removing all obstacles (to
negotiations) is on. I will be surprised if we don't succeed in
removing the obostacles.''
   The ANC is demanding the lifting of the state of emergency and
the release of all political prisoners as preconditions to talks
aimed at ending the apartheid system that denies South Africa's 28
million blacks a vote in national life.
   On Feb. 16, the ANC said it was prepared to send a delegation to
South Africa for talks with de Klerk on how to proceed.
   Mandela said the ANC welcomed wide-ranging reforms so far by de
Klerk but the ANC sought only to negotiate on an equal footing with
the ruling National Party.
   ``As long as political prisoners are not released and the state
is emergency is not lifted in its entirety, we are not on equal
terms,'' he said.
   Of his own release, Mandela said ``the release of one prisoner
when there are 3,000 others can't be such an important
development.''
   The veteran black leader said the national executive would ``in
due course'' announce the names of delegates it wants to travel to
Cape Town for the preliminary talks with de Klerk.
   South Africa says it wants the ANC to abandon its commitment to
guerrilla hostilities and there have been calls from South African
church leaders and President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia for
guerrillas to suspend their operations inside South Africa.
   ``If the government gives us the opportunity, we will move away
from confrontation ... but it is up to the government to decide,''
Mandela said.
   The ANC has waged a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 but
there have been few attacks recently and the guerrillas have had
little military impact.
   By his election as the ANC's No. 2, Mandela effectively becomes
the organization's top leader.
   Tambo suffered a stroke in August and is widely believed unable
to resume an active political life as the ANC sets about
establishing a political framework in South Africa for the first
time.
   Amid concerns for the health of Mandela, ANC officials said he
had a full schedule and been followed everywhere by hundreds of
journalists since his release from prison. Mandela has received
many foreign invitations.
   A senior ANC official said Mandela, treated in prison for
tuberculosis two years ago, receives a daily checkup from a
physician.
   ``We have just got him back'' from prison, the official said.
``The last thing he should see now is hospital walls.''

<HEAD>Senators Urge East, West German Leaders To Merge Treaties On
Poland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A third of the Senate appealed to the leaders
of East and West Germany on Friday to merge their countries'
existing border treaties with Poland in order to allay Polish fears.
   The bipartisan group of 34 senators called on West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow
to come up with a single treaty that would bind a unified Germany
to honor the present border with Poland along the Oder and western
Neisse rivers.
   The joint treaty would be initialed by the two leaders now but
would only be ratified by a united German parliament once
unification is achieved, the senators proposed.
   ``We believe, as you do, that inviolability of the post-war
European borders is a cornerstone for world peace and
stability...,'' the senators wrote. The move was initiated by
Senator Paul Simon, D-Ill., a member of the Foreign Relations
Committee.
   ``Any remaining ambiguity about German intentions concerning the
present German borders with Poland should be eliminated as soon as
possible,'' the senators said.
   As steps toward uniting East and West gather momentum, Poland
has become increasingly nervous that the territory it was given
after World War II, comprising one-third of present-day Poland,
might be claimed by a united Germany.
   Kohl has dismissed such fears as groundless and said this week
that he would favor the two German parliaments making formal
statements that recognize Poland's western border.
   But despite repeated pressure from opposition parties at home
and from foreign leaders, he has refused to commit himself to a
binding position on the subject, saying only a unified German
government and parliament could make such a pledge. Some analysts
have seen his reluctance as motivated by a desire to avoid giving
an issue to the very small extreme nationalist groups in West
Germany.
   Each Germany has a separate treaty with Poland defining their
borders.
   In their cable to the two leaders, the senators said a unified
treaty would ``put to rest legitimate concerns of Poland and would
facilitate the process leading to German unification.''
   ``It also would respond to Chancellor's Kohl's concern that the
present treaty between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany
could not be legally binding on a united Germany,'' the cable said.
   President Bush has also urged Kohl to commit a unified Germany,
of which he might be the first leader, to an agreement about
Poland's existing borders. The two leaders discussed the problem at
a summit meeting last weekend in the presidential retreat at Camp
David.
   The Potsdam conference of July 1945 of the principal victors
over Hitler's Germany _ the United States, France, Britain and the
Soviet Union _ put German territory under Polish administration,
pending a final peace treaty, as compensation for Polish territory
further East claimed by Russia.
   The German provinces of Pomerania and Silesia and half of East
Prussia were given to Poland, and millions of Germans fled to
Germany.
   Much of the area in question had been seized from Poland in the
18th century extinction of Poland by Prussia, Austria and Russia.

<HEAD>Drifter Gets 10 Years for Robbing Disabled Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drifter from Minnesota was sentenced to 10
years in prison for robbing $25 from a disabled mute who is bound
to a wheelchair and forcing him to drink cheap wine.
   Scott Johnston, 25, an English major at Palo Alto College who
suffers from cerebral palsy, pointed to words and letters glued to
a board on his wheelchair to communicate at a non-jury trial
Thursday.
   He testified he was on his way to a K mart store last July to
make a payment on a radio when Curtis Claymore and a second man
came up to him and Claymore allegedly robbed him of the cash and
payment receipts for the radio.
   He alleged that Claymore, a 31-year-old drifter from Guthrie,
Minn., then wheeled him to a nearby Handy Andy grocery store,
bought a bottle of cheap wine and tried to pour the wine down
Johnston's throat.
   Johnston claimed he was bundled out of his wheelchair and his
communication board was tossed aside. He said he spent six hours
with Claymore and was afraid of leaving because Claymore had a
lock-blade knife in his knapsack.
   Claymore claimed he did not harm Johnston but was protecting him
from another man. The student said the second man threatened him
but did not help Claymore take the money.
   Claymore denied he showed Johnston the knife but admitted he
used it to clean his fingernails in front of him. ``That's not
showing a knife,'' he said.
   When Johnston's father and two neighbors arrived at the shopping
center that night, they called police. A police officer said when
he came on the scene, Johnston pointed out two words on his board _
``book him.''
   State District Judge Sharon MacRae took only moments to convict
and sentence Claymore, denying his request for probation.

   Local police said no casualties or damage were reported.
   The quake occurred at 12:22 a.m. and the agency located its
epicenter at 32 miles beneath the earth's surface in southwestern
Ibaraki state, about 38 miles northeast of Tokyo.
   The temblor had a preliminary reading of 4.5 on the Richter
scale.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
A quake that measures 4 can cause moderate damage, and one which

   The body of a 31-year-old American was found
Friday in the debris of a luxury hotel fire, bringing to at least
17 the number of people killed, officials said.
   Sheraton Corp. said in a statement issued from its headquarters
in Boston that according to unconfirmed reports, 18 people were
killed in Thursday's fire at the Heliopolis Sheraton Hotel. It gave
no details.
   Morgue officials said 17 people died in the blaze, ignited by
sparks from a clay bread oven in a tourist restaurant tent next to
the hotel.
   A 67-year-old retired accountant from Houston was among the dead
and a third American was reported killed. Two others and three
Britons remained missing.
   The fire raged for nine hours through the lobby and many of its
630 rooms. About 70 people were injured.
   Authorities blamed strong winds, common this time of year in
Egypt, and the lack of an alarm system or sprinklers for the fire's
rapid spread.
   Sheraton said in its statement that there were fire alarms in
the building. ``The alarm was sounded, and fire fighting
authorities were promptly contacted,'' it said.
   Frantic guests at the six-story hotel jumped out windows and
slid down bedsheets that were tied together.
   Maj. Gen. Adel Negm, chief of the Cairo fire brigade, charged
that Sheraton officials broke the law by erecting the tent. ``They
are illegal because they are fire hazards,'' he said.
   Sheraton's statement said the hotel ``had received all required
permits to operate the hotel and restaurants. The Heliopolis
Sheraton was in compliance with all local codes and regulations.''
   The hotel chain's director of Middle East operations, Sami
Zogbi, said in Cairo that the hotel was never warned about using
tents.
   ``If that's true, how come the authorities didn't pull it
down?'' he said. ``We had firefighting equipment, at least 20 large
extinguishers in the tent, but the winds were very strong.''
   Canvas tents and marquees are used widely in Egypt for weddings,
funeral gatherings and entertainment.
   Sheraton's statement said unconfirmed reports put the number of
deaths at 18, but the director of Cairo's central morgue, Dr. Kamal
el-Saadani, said he had received 17 bodies, including five women
who had not been identified. He said the others included a Greek, a
Briton, a Chilean and three each from France, Finland and the
United States.
   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said only two Americans were
confirmed dead and that two remained unaccounted for.
   She said she could neither confirm nor rule out the death of a
third American, as claimed by police Col. Harb. At the morgue, the
third American victim was said to be an elderly man.
   The embassy spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity that
American authorities were ``pretty certain'' the body found Friday
was that of Stephen Mohnike, 31, of California. His hometown was
not immediately available.
   El-Saadani said the remains of another American, Robert D.
Cresap, 67, of Houston, had been identified at the morgue.
   The embassy spokeswoman said it was possible that the two
missing Americans also had died, but documented proof was lacking
and some bodies were too badly burned for prompt identification.

   A part-time employee of the University of
Pennsylvania library was charged with stealing more than 100 books
and documents, including a 1611 copy of Shakespeare's ``Hamlet''
worth $1 million, authorities said Thursday.
   The works, valued at more than $1.45 million, were recovered,
officials said.
   City police Wednesday night charged Kathleen Wilkerson, a
part-time worker in the Van Pelt Library's rare books department,
with one count each of theft and receiving stolen property, said
Wayne R. Gilbert, the FBI's top agent in Philadelphia.
   If convicted, Wilkerson, 33, would face three to five years in
prison on each count.
   No other arrests were imminent, but the investigation was
continuing, said James Clark, first deputy commissioner of the
Police Department.
   The books were spotted Saturday at the Bauman Rare Books store
in Philadelphia by book dealer Steven Lowentheil of Baltimore.
Suspecting they were from the library, he notified university
officials and the FBI.
   Nineteen of the books and documents, including the slim
``Hamlet'' volume, were recovered Tuesday and Wednesday at the book
store, officials said. More than 100 others were found Wednesday at
Ms. Wilkerson's home and her parents' home, authorities said.
   The store cooperated in the investigation, Gilbert said.
   Ms. Wilkerson had worked in the rare books department for
several years, Gilbert said. He did not know whether she had any
association with the bookstore.
   There was no answer at her home telephone Thursday. The
bookstore's owner, Natalie Bauman, was believed to be at a book
show in Texas, police said.
   It was not clear whether Ms. Wilkerson had acted alone, how long
the books had been missing and whether other books had passed into
private hands.
   ``There may be other books missing, but that's part of the
continuing investigation,'' Gilbert said.
   ``Apparently this has been going on for a while,'' said Paul
Mosher, the Ivy League university's vice provost and director of
libraries.
   At a news conference, the FBI displayed the 19 books found at
the bookstore. Besides ``Hamlet,'' one of eight such copies known
to exist, other Shakespearean works were a 1600 edition of
``Merchant of Venice'' valued at $100,000; a 1608 edition of
``Henry V,'' $100,000; and a 1664 folio, $35,000.
   Works by other authors included a 1491 edition of Dante's
``Divine Comedy,'' $25,000; a 1719 edition of Isaac Newton's
``Optice,'' $25,000; three copies of Thomas Paine's ``Common
Sense,'' worth $10,000, $5,000 and $2,500; a 1542 edition of
Geoffrey Chaucer's ``The Canterbury Tales,'' $1,000; and a 1497
Bible, $25,000.
   The remainder were books and letters by the English romantic
poet, Lord Byron, the most valuable of which was an 1807 copy of
``Hours of Idleness'' valued at $15,000.
   The FBI originally believed the case involved interstate
transportation of stolen books, but investigators later determined
the case was limited to Philadelphia, Gilbert said.
   Mosher said the investigation was hampered by the theft of index
cards used to keep track of many books and documents along with the
works. About 60 percent of the library's 20 million volumes and
documents are cataloged by computer, but the rest are on cards
dating back to the 19th century.
   Mosher said the library has been reviewing security procedures,
and has removed its most valuable items from shelves and put them
in a vault. The procedures for hiring part-time employees in the
library also have been strengthened.

   The parents of a black teen-ager slain in a
racial attack in Brooklyn said Thursday that the disappearance of
an important witness in the case makes them feel betrayed by
prosecutors.
   ``They can take that sign down in the courthouse that says, `And
Justice for All,''' Diane Hawkins, the mother of 16-year-old Yusuf
Hawkins, said at the Apollo Theater in Harlem after appearing on a
WLIB radio program.
   Hawkins was shot to death Aug. 23 when he and three black
friends were surrounded by a gang of young whites shortly after
arriving in the predominantly white Bensonhurst neighborhood to
look at a used car.
   On Wednesday, District Attorney Charles J. Hynes announced that
John Vento, 21, has been missing since Christmas.
   Vento, who allegedly participated in the attack, had agreed to
testify before a grand jury and at any trial as part of deal in
which he would not be charged.
   The trial was to start Monday, but prosecutors plan to ask state
Supreme Court Justice Thaddeus Owens to adjourn the proceedings for
a month if Vento is not found in the next few days.
   Vento's attorney, Gerald DiChiara, said Thursday that his
client's brother told him that the family was also looking for
Vento. ``They don't know where he is,'' DiChiara said.
   The brother said the family wants to persuade Vento to give up,
the lawyer said.
   Hawkins' father, Moses Stewart, said he felt betrayed by former
District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman, who was replaced in January
by Hynes.
   ``So he was given immunity by Holtzman and slipped through the
fingers of Hynes,'' Stewart said.
   Hynes spokesman Patrick Clark said the district attorney was
prepared to meet with the family.
   ``He's a father, too, and knows how much the Stewart family is
grieving,'' Clark said. ``He regrets they are disappointed, but
he's going to do everything in his power to do justice to their
son.''
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, one of the family's advisers, said Mrs.
Hawkins would lead a rally through Bensonhurst on Saturday.

<HEAD>South African Minister Visits Angola on Peace Mission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha of South Africa
held talks with Angolan officials Thursday, officially ending 15
years of rancor between their countries.
   Botha's one-day swing was the first official visit to Luanda by
a South African minister since Angola gained independence from
Portugal in 1975 and South Africa sent troops to back guerrillas
fighting its new Marxist government.
   The visit is the latest move in a diplomatic offensive by the
white-dominated government of South Africa to improve relations
with its black neighbors.
   Diplomatic sources in Luanda said President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos pressed Botha during a one-hour meeting to use South
Africa's influence with Angolan guerrillas to bring them to the
negotiating table.
   South Africa agreed to withdraw its troops after 13 years of
combat against government forces and to halt aid to the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ UNITA_ in a
1988 peace accord signed in New York.
   Botha called on Thursday for cooperation and improved commerical
links between Angola and South Africa and said, ``Unless we can put
aside the ideological differences and do so quickly, Africa is in
for a terrible economic situation.''
   Botha's talks here also covered recent political reforms in
South Africa, including legalization of anti-apartheid
organizations and last month's release of African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela after 27 years in jail.
   Foreign Minister Pedro de Castro van Dunem met Botha for 90
minutes. He praised South Africa for Mandela's release and for
reforms of the apartheid system of racial segregation that were
initiated by President F.W. de Klerk.
   Since assuming power in August, de Klerk has traveled to Zambia,
Zaire, Mozambique and Ivory Coast to explain planned reforms of
apartheid.
   South African-Angolan relations have improved since the New York
accords, in which South Africa also pledged to accept a U.N. plan
to grant independence to Angola's southern neighbor, Namibia.
   Under the accords, about 50,000 Cuban troops supporting the
Luanda government are leaving Angola, with a complete pullout set
for mid-1991.
   In Johannesburg, de Klerk pressed ahead with reform Thursday,
saying he will not tolerate coverups and promising a thorough
investigation into charges that security forces have killed
anti-apartheid activists.
   ``The truth about crimes and malpractices has to be established
and made public,'' de Klerk told Parliament in Cape Town. ``I am
not asking anybody to cover up anything, let alone condone any
crime.''
   More than 60 unsolved killings of anti-apartheid figures have
occurred in the past decade. Activists have long accused security
forces of involvement in the deaths.
   A judicial commission appointed by de Klerk is to begin
investigating next week the alleged police and military involvement
in assassination squads.
   Twenty people were arrested Thursday in Cape Town while
demonstrating in support of about 350 inmates on a 4-day-old hunger
strike, activists said.
   Inmates at Robben Island Prison near Cape Town stopped eating
Monday, saying they consider themselves political prisoners and
should be released under the reforms.
   Many of the hunger strikers are supporters of the African
National Congress or the Pan Africanist Congress, the two groups
that wage guerrilla campaigns against the government.

   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will
meet officials of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization next week
to discuss the situation in Germany, the alliance announced
Thursday.
   In a brief statement, it said Kohl will meet on March 8 with
NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner and ambassadors from the 16
NATO nations.
   It said the purpose of Kohl's visit was ``to inform and consult
about the position of the Federal Government (West Germany) on
Germany and security matters.'' It did not elaborate.
   But the visit apparently stems from Germany's desire to keep the
allies up to date on the rapid pace of events in Central Europe.
Some smaller countries, like Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium,
have complained about being left on the sidelines.
   Elections will take place on March 18 in East Germany and are
expected to spur the drive for reunification of the two Germanys.
   NATO officials have said a united Germany should remain part of
the Western alliance, but that Soviet troops could be temporarily
stationed on the current territory of East Germany. More than
380,000 Red Army troops are assigned there now.
   The Soviet Union has said the new state should be neutral,
belonging to neither military alliance. East Germany now is a
member of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   West Germany's foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, has
proposed that a united Germany continue in NATO but only the
territory of West Germany would be tied to its military structure.
NATO would not extend its forces into East Germany.
   NATO ambassadors on Thursday discussed the 35-nation summit
expected to be held late in the year on the future of a new Europe,
including unification of the two Germanys.
   Raymond Seitz, assistant U.S. secretary of state, presented the
American views of the meeting of the 35-nation Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe. The discussion centered on the
preparation and mechanics of the conference and not on the
substance of the proposed meeting, according to a NATO official,
demanding anonymity.
   The alliance said in a statement that the talks ``provided
momentum to consultations among the allies in preparation for the
summit. Allies are working intensively to develop basic elements of
a common approach.''
   No date or place has yet been set for the summit, which will
draw together leaders from the United States, Canada and Eastern
and Western Europe.
   At the gathering, leaders of the 16 NATO nations and the seven
Warsaw Pact countries are expected to sign an arms control treaty
to reduce troops, tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear forces in
Europe.

<HEAD>$45,000 Reward Posted in Minister's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has offered a $45,512
reward for information leading to a conviction in the death last
month of Kenya's foreign minister.
   Police Commissioner Philip Kilonzo said Wednesday any
information on Robert Ouko's mysterious disappearance and death
would be treated confidentially.
   Robert Ouko's partly burned body was discovered four miles from
his family farm in western Kenya on Feb. 8, three days after he was
reported missing. He had been shot in the head.
   Ouko's death led to violent demonstrations by university
students and mourners demanding an impartial investigation.
President Daniel arap Moi has invited three British detectives to
join Kenyan police in the investigation, apparently to allay fears
of a coverup.
   The minister was the fourth politically prominent figure to die
violently since Kenya gained independence from Britain in 1963. In
each of the previous three deaths, the government of the late
President Jomo Kenyatta was accused of a coverup.
   Ouko was the highest-ranking politician from the Luo tribe, one
of four major ethnic groups that vie for power in Kenya's
single-party government and engage in ancient rivalries. Some
students protesters have suggested Moi should resign to take
responsibility for Ouko's death.

<HEAD>Trio Reindicted in Howard Beach Race Assault Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three youths convicted of riot in the 1986
Howard Beach racial attack were arraigned on the same charge
Thursday, two months after an appeals court overturned their prior
convictions because of trial judge error.
   A grand jury in the borough of Queens also indicted the trio on
a civil rights violation charge, said Matthew Greenberg, spokesman
for state Special Prosecutor Helman R. Brooks. Both are misdemeanor
counts carrying a possible one-year jail term.
   The three suspects were arraigned Thursday before state Supreme
Court Justice Charles J. Thomas and released on their own
recognizance.
   The charges stem from the second of two trials after the Dec.
20, 1986, attack in a predominantly white Queens neighborhood. A
gang of bat-wielding local teens chased a 23-year-old black man to
his death on the Belt Parkway and badly beat another black.
   Three teens were convicted of manslaughter in the first trial
after the incident, and those verdicts were not overturned.
   Three defendants in the second trial _ William Bollander, Thomas
Farino and James Povinelli, all 18 and from Queens _ were convicted
in 1988 of the misdemeanor riot count and acquitted of a more
serious felony riot count.
   State Supreme Court Justice Thomas A. Demakos sentenced the
three on Sept. 19, 1988, to 34 days in jail to be served on
weekends over a four-month period. But they were granted a stay
pending appeal and spent no time in jail after their conviction.
   The Appellate Division of state Supreme Court ruled Dec. 27,
1989, that Demakos had made two errors in charging the jury.
   Demakos, ``over strenuous defense objections,'' furnished the
jury with verdict sheets that improperly described some of the
alleged crimes, the panel said. The judge also erred by refusing a
defense request to instruct the jury on disorderly conduct as a
lesser offense of second-degree riot, they said.
   On Feb. 1, Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals Sol Wachtler
rejected a prosecution motion for the state's highest court to rule
on the lower court reversal.

   Massachusetts' attorney general, who advocates a
tough approach toward casual drug users and is up for re-election,
said Thursday that his confession to using marijuana in college had
caused no political fallout.
   ``It's a generational thing,'' said Attorney General James M.
Shannon, 37, the state's top law enforcement officer.
   On Wednesday, Shannon said in an interview with television
station WHLL in Worcester and a subsequent news conference in
Boston that he had used marijuana while in college but didn't use
it in law school. Shannon graduated from Johns Hopkins University
in Baltimore in 1973 and from George Washington University in
Washington in 1975.
   Shannon, a Democrat who has called for stronger penalties for
casual drug users, said he believes voters this year will respect
his candor.
   ``I think people will see it for what it was. An honest answer
to a legitimate question,'' he said.
   Shannon said college friends had called him. ``Their main
concern was that I'm not naming names,'' he said.
   Following Shannon's disclosure, two leading Republican
candidates for lieutenant governor, state Rep. Sen. Paul Cellucci
and state Rep. Peter Torkildsen, said in interviews that they, too,
had smoked marijuana in college.
   State Rep. Marjorie Clapprood, a Democratic candidate for
lieutenant governor, said in an interview Thursday night that she
had not smoked it.
   She said she was distressed that the issue was being raised
about candidates so long after the fact. ``It seems to be me to be
out of context,'' the lawmaker said.
   Political analysts said they doubted the disclosures would hurt
candidates. They said voters probably accept the fact that a
generation of young politicians who grew up when drug use was
common on college campuses experimented with drugs.
   ``Clearly, you've got several issues here. One is a question of
morality, which, if it was done 15 or 20 years ago, I find to be
ridiculous,'' said Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise
Institute, a public policy research organization in Washington, D.C.
   In 1987, Douglas Ginsberg withdrew as President Reagan's nominee
for a Supreme Court seat when former colleagues said he smoked
marijuana.
   But subsequent admissions of student drug use by Sen. Albert
Gore, D-Tenn., and former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt had little
impact on their 1988 presidential campaigns, political analysts
said.
   ``I didn't see it making much of a difference,'' Ornstein said.
   Todd Domke, a Republican political consultant, agreed. ``Based
on poll results following the Doug Ginsberg revelations, it would
seem that most poeple just aren't interested,'' Domke said.
   ``I think people are willing to forgive the indiscretions of
youth,'' Domke said.

   The head of the military tribunal that
condemned Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu to death has
committed suicide, officials said today.
   Lt. Gen. Gica Popa killed himself Thursday at the Ministry of
Justice, said Nicolae Dide, the spokesman for the interim
government. A source said he had received death threats, apparently
by Ceausescu loyalists, for more than two months.
   Dide said he did not know how Popa died, but other sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said he had shot himself in the
head.
   News of Popa's death came on the first scheduled day of trials
in Timisoara of army and police officers accused of complicity in
the shooting of anti-Ceausescu demonstrators there.

   Sandinista officials on Thursday acknowledged the desertions but

   The Seabrook nuclear plant overcame two

financial ruin of its chief investor to capture the ultimate prize:
a license to operate.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted 3-0 Thursday to grant
the $6.5 billion reactor a full-power license. But the appeal
process will hold up the license for at least two weeks, and
Seabrook opponents pressed on.
   About 125 anti-Seabrook demonstrators waved signs, chanted and
blocked plant gates after the decision. More than 70 were arrested.
   At the NRC meeting in Rockville, Md., utility executives hugged

   Those landowners, he said, won't support the program if they're
hit by new expenses that were covered by the forestry assistance

   ``One thing we cannot do is let the rhetoric outrun the

   The latest edition of Crisis is a first-class
comic book _ readable, graphic and vibrant _ but it deals in human
rights, not jokes or superheroes.
   The twice-monthly publication, with a print run of up to 40,000,
was launched a year ago and has become one of Britain's most
popular comic books, telling stories of animal rights, the
environment and racism.
   For its latest issue, Crisis joined forces with Amnesty
International, the human rights organization based in London, to
bring youngsters the grim reality of such as the ``Upington 14'' in
South Africa.
   ``We are going after a new, younger audience,'' said Dan Jones,
head of campaigns at Amnesty. ``Part of our problem is that Amnesty
International produces the most extraordinary stories, and then
they are put into an inaccessible form.''
   Most previous stories in Crisis were fictional, but the Amnesty
International edition is presented as straight fact.
   ``The comic book tells the story clearly and dramatically
without lowering Amnesty International's high standards for facts
and details,'' Jones said. ``Our name is on the paper and our
reputation goes with it.''
   Life-like color drawings tell the story of the ``Upington 14''
and their confinement on death row in Pretoria Prison.
   Fourteen blacks were sentenced to death for the mob killing of a
black policeman in Upington, northwestern South Africa, in November
1985. They were not proved guilty as individuals, but were
sentenced under a doctrine called ``common purpose,'' which held
them responsible as part of the mob.
   On the last page of the story are statistics of executions in
South Africa and a statement that says:
   ``Amnesty International is opposed to the death penalty. ... In
the case of South Africa it asks that a judicial enquiry be
appointed to look into the use of the `Common Purpose' doctrine.''
   Jones said a paragraph was added at the last minute to inform
readers that President F.W. de Klerk of South Africa suspended the
death penalty Feb. 2.
   Pat Mills, a senior Crisis scriptwriter, and artist Sean
Phillips, prepared the edition, using Amnesty files.
   ``When Amnesty International came along with specific cases, I
realized I didn't have to hide behind fiction,'' Mills said. ``I
could come straight out with it because it is based on real life,
not made up in any way, and it blows away any movie.''
   The second story in the Amnesty issue is about the humiliation
and suffering of young Palestinians engaged in the uprising against
Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``Amnesty International has recorded a wide range of severe
violations of human rights by the Israeli security forces,'' says
the message at the end. ``Over 540 Palestinians have been shot dead
by the military, including many children.''
   In the last story, a young woman is shown trying to stir an
apathetic comic-strip addict into caring about human rights.
   ``I didn't know you were into lefty political groups,'' he says,
with a sneer on his face.
   She retorts: ``The whole basis of Amnesty International is that
it's a non-political organization! And we get results. What do you
ever do except complain about how screwed up the world is?''
   The comic book tells readers how to write de Klerk and what
points to make about the death penalty. ``Although you might feel
angry,'' it suggests, ``it is more effective if letters are
courteous.''
   On the back cover is an advertisement for Amnesty International
socks, T-shirts and posters sold by mail.
   Britain is the primary market for Crisis, but it also goes to
North America and Australia, publishing director Jon Davidge said.
It costs $1.70.
   Jones said future editions will contain other human rights cases.
   ``Issue No. 44 will illustrate Amnesty International's cases of
asylum seekers from Sri Lanka and a later issue will include the
case of a tortured Iraqi,'' he said.

   The whistling winds off the Atlantic
once carried sailing ships to this tiny island and the welcoming
sight of the Sankaty Lighthouse.
   Now those winds are ripping away the sand and soil that anchor
the beacon, and soon its light, like the whalers, will be gone.
   But Sankaty may have a savior in a 75-year-old painter named
Robert Perrin. The pink-cheeked, silver-haired maverick, who has
made the island his home, has painted the lighthouse and is
donating 20 percent of the proceeds from the sale of each $150
print to an effort to save the lighthouse.
   His fund raising may amount to little more than a drop in an
ocean, but to Perrin, it doesn't matter. His time as a painter is
running short. Glaucoma has claimed most of the sight in his right
eye, and weakened blood vessels in his left may steal what sight
remains.
   With his fading vision, he has seen many Nantucket landmarks
torn down to make way for developers wanting to open up the island
for more summer visitors and tourists. Sankaty's light, he said,
won't be extinguished.
   ``Everyone says it can't be done,'' Perrin said of his efforts
to save the lighthouse. ``But I'm a stubborn cuss.''
   The odds against him are daunting. The 140-year-old lighthouse
must be moved back from its eroding 110-foot bluff or be swept out
to sea in the next decade. A U.S. Army Corps of Engineers study
estimated it will cost $840,000 to move Sankaty.
   So two years ago, Perrin painted a majestic seascape of the
beacon rising over the stormy Atlantic.
   The undertaking was no piece of cake. Perrin wanted the work to
be a view from the sea, but after clambering down the bluff to the
beach, easel and brushes in hand, he realized the lighthouse wasn't
visible from that vantage point. Visiting seabirds didn't make the
task any easier.
   ``I got divebombed by terns when I was walking along the
beach,'' Perrin recalled. ``Then I couldn't see anything when I got
there. Boy, was I mad.''
   The painting, in the end, had to be created from the artist's
imagination. So far, sales have been slow. But Perrin also plans to
lobby Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who secured $1.2 million in
federal money to reconstruct Nantucket's Great Point Lighthouse,
which washed into the sea in a storm in 1984.
   Sankaty is one of a handful of the 139 New England lighthouses
run by the U.S. Coast Guard that will fall into the sea in the next
decade if steps aren't taken to save them, according to Coast Guard
Lt. Paul Reid in Boston.
   Reid said despite modern navigation systems, lighthouses still
help ships at sea find their way to shore.
   ``Lighthouses are major aids to navigation. They're on all
navigational charts,'' Reid said. ``And even in the biggest ships,
electronics can always go on the fritz. Sailors like to have the
lighthouses there, something that's always dependable.''
   Pottering around his gallery, scattered with easels, canvasses,
yellowing photographs and artifacts from the island, Perrin jokes
about his fading sight and his work.
   ``I could be a great abstractionist with my right eye. Or I
could turn to sculpture. Of course, I'd have to do it by feel, and
it would have to be with female models,'' said Perrin, still a
bachelor.
   His Nantucket paintings, many filled with half-visible,
ghostlike images of people and landmarks long gone, provide a sort
of visual history of the old Nantucket.
   ``You can go anywhere and see brand-new buildings, brand-new
this, brand-new that,'' Perrin said. ``But old places and things
have their own character.''
   Like, he hastens to add, the Sankaty Lighthouse.
   ``I could say, to heck with it, and not take my medication, and
maybe I'd be blind in a few years,'' Perrin said. ``But the
lighthouse is still there. Let's save it before something happens.''

<HEAD>Securitate Chief Arrested After Failing Loyalty Tests, Brucan Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief of Nicolae Ceausescu's
secret police changed sides at the height of the rebellion against
the communist dictator, but was arrested after failing loyalty
tests, a leader of the uprising says.
   Silviu Brucan, a member of the army war council that fought
Ceausescu, said his greatest contribution to the December
revolution was exposing the treachery of Gen. Iulian Vlad, who had
been Brucan's own most cunning interrogator when he was under
arrest in 1989 for criticizing the dictator.
   Brucan, a Stalinist who became a dissident, spoke of events in
the days when the revolution's outcome remained in doubt.
   He said he went to the Defense Ministry on Christmas Eve, as
Securitate secret police and snipers attacked strategic targets in
Bucharest, and found Vlad to be one of two men directing military
operations for the rebellion.
   ``What a shock!'' he said in an interview.
   Two days earlier, Vlad had offered to cooperate with the army,
which was supporting the popular uprising against Ceausescu, Brucan
said. The dictator was overthrown Dec. 22 and executed Dec. 25.
   ``I was afraid he might use his attributes to deceive, to take
in the generals,'' said Brucan, 74.
   ``So we decided to test him, asking him to make a public
statement on the radio and TV, and the key sentence of the
statement was _ and I wrote it with my hands _ an explicit order to
his troops and snipers to cease fire and surrender themselves.''
   Vlad did not include that sentence in the statement he read, and
at a meeting of the war council that night, Brucan demanded to know
why.
   ``Gen. Vlad showed once more his slippery manner,'' Brucan said.
``He insisted that his statement was a categorical commitment to
the revolution and that this was much more important because it
gave a new political orientation to his troops.''
   When Brucan persisted, Vlad ``got very irritated, angry, and
said it was the first time that someone questioned his loyalty to
the revolution.''
   After Brucan reminded Vlad of his ``brutal methods'' in forcing
Brucan to repudiate his letter challenging Ceausescu, he asked why
Vlad had not told the army immediately about Securitate ammunition
dumps, communications centers and underground tunnels.
   ``Everyone around the table could then see how Gen. Vlad grew
red,'' he said. ``He asked for a glass of water and took some
pills, and finally he denied the existence of such a plan.
   ``But since I put the screws on him, he eventually retorted that
if there ever was such a plan, he didn't know about it. I then said
that it is inconceivable that in a military organization the
commanding officer should know nothing about the plan involving the
troops under his command.
   ``I asked the other generals to say whether this was
conceivable, and all of them answered negatively.
   ``At last, Gen. Vlad asked for a final test, a final trying to
prove his loyalty to the revolution. He promised to organize an
action the next day that will end with the capture of a great
number of terrorists under his command.
   ``The generals decided to give him that last chance, but in
fact, the important result of that meeting was that the generals
lost confidence in that man. The next day, since the actions
promised by Vlad did not materialize, the commanders of the army
decided to arrest him.''
   No date has been set for Vlad's trial.
   Gen. Stefan Guse, who had shared command responsibility with
Vlad, was sent to a provincial city because his support for Vlad
had made him suspect, Brucan said, and ``Thus, the most dangerous
chapter in the war against terrorism was closed.''
   Anti-government protesters have claimed the Securitate still
operates in another guise, supported by a government either unable
or unwilling to clean out Ceausescu's vast security apparatus.
   Brucan said an unknown number of Securitate agents remain at
large. He also said he did not consider the 700,000 people who
acted as Securitate informers to be dangerous.
   The National Salvation Front, which took power during the
revolution, decided the army should merely weed out the worse of
the group ``because it didn't make sense to consider all these
700,000 as lawbreakers,'' he said.
   Most of the 15,000 Securitate operatives served throughout
Ceausescu's 24 years in power and were retired after the
revolution, Brucan said, and ``the most dangerous ones are the
snipers who are still at large.''
   ``They usually have keys to two apartments,'' Brucan said.
``They have two identities. They have in their apartments civilian
and military clothes, plenty of food in their freezers and
refrigerators, and they can endure.
   ``Snipers wait for the occasion, and they are not going to waste
their ammunition on second-class people.''

ban on abortion in the constitution of Ireland, which is 93 percent
Roman Catholic, it has become a censorship issue.
   In December, the national student union had to stop circulating
its official handbook because it contained information on abortion
services.
   Student leaders talk of defying a Dec. 19 court injunction and
smuggling copies in from Northern Ireland. Abortion is banned in
the British province too, but not information on abortion.
   Ruth Riddick, a feminist who ran a pregnancy counseling service,
still gets anxious calls at home, most of them from men with
pregnant girlfriends.
   ``The debate has become both more one-sided and more trivial,''
said Ms. Riddick, a 35-year-old arts administrator.
   ``It has shifted from deep moral issues about whether women have
a right to choose. ... A woman's abortion experience is being
reduced into a simple question of `Where the hell do I get a phone
number?'''
   Marie Vernon, a campaigner against abortion, countered: ``You
don't have an absolute right to information. A primary right is the
right to life, and all other rights are secondary.''
   Abortion always has been illegal in Ireland. The ban was
reinforced by the 1983 decision to write it into the constitution.
   In March 1988, and again last December, the Supreme Court ruled
that giving information on how to get an abortion in a foreign
country violates the constitution.
   That does not make it a criminal offense, but it enables
anti-abortionists to win injunctions. Violators of the injunctions
can be jailed for contempt of court.
   Now the battle has moved to European courts, which must rule
whether the ban violates the rights of the 3.5 million people in
Ireland to get the same information as other West Europeans.
   The Irish rulings climaxed lengthy civil actions brought by the
Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child, the main
anti-abortion lobby outside the Catholic Church, against two
pregnancy counseling services and the student union.
   Ms. Riddick closed her counseling service, but still provides
information from home, risking contempt proceedings. The Dublin
Well Woman Center, a general health clinic that ran the other
counseling service, no longer gives information.
   Ireland is the only European country with a total ban on
abortion.
   Divorce and homosexuality also are illegal, contraception was
banned until a decade ago and the church runs most schools and
hospitals.
   In Ireland, the abortion issue seems at once starker and more
complicated than the customary arguments about women's rights and
respect for human life.
   Even liberals don't expect to see abortion legalized within a
generation, and acknowledge the opposition is deep-rooted and
widespread.
   They say the controversy about informaton has increased women's
fear and guilt, prevented proper counseling and made late abortions
more likely.
   ``In 1983, we packed halls with people fighting publicly for
legal abortion; now many are afraid to call for a right to
information,' said Pauline Ryder, head of the Well Woman Clinic,
which is privately financed.
   Each year, at least 4,000 Irish women go to Britain for
abortions. Most pay about $340 at private clinics.
   The annual figure, based on abortions performed in Britain on
women who gave addresses in Ireland, has changed little in five
years.
   Moving the dispute into the realm of free speech has increased
support for the pro-choice lobby.
   An attempt last year by the Society for the Protection of the
Unborn Child to jail four student leaders over the handbook
provoked large demonstrations outside the court.
   In January, students voted 3-1 to support the Union of Students
in Ireland, which has 60,000 members, in its refusal to stop giving
information on abortion clinics in the handbook or by telephone.
   ``I wouldn't say the population supports abortion, but there is
sympathy for our fight against censorship,'' said Karen Quinlivan,
a 23-year-old law graduate who is the women's rights officer at the
student headquarters.
   ``In the ballots, the students voted contrary to what we've been
taught all our lives,'' she said. ``There's a feeling that SPUC is
carrying things too far. ... these people are extreme and
dangerous.''
   Mrs. Vernon, spokeswoman for the Society for the Protection of
the Unborn Child, is a cheerful housewife in her mid-40s with five
children.
   Her youngest child, 8-month-old Sean, is adopted. His natural
mother, an unmarried teen-ager, lived with the Vernon family during
pregnancy.
   ``He's just the sort of baby who might have been terminated, as
they like to call it.'' Mrs. Vernon said, then laughed and added:
``But I feel a bit guilty using him as a sales point.''
   On the walls of the society's one-room headquarters in a
well-to-do Dublin suburb are a disturbing picture of a late-term
abortion and one of Pope John Paul II cuddling a baby.
   The society, founded in 1980, says it is non-sectarian and ha itself
a policeman of
the constitution, and sends agents posing as abortion-seekers to
check on the Well Woman Clinic and other suspect organizations.
   Cosmopolitan was censored after a citizen complained to the
Censorship and Publications Board, a government agency. The board,
which can ban any publication it feels ``advocates the procurement
of abortion,'' told Cosmopolitan last year to drop the ads.
   ``We agonized over it,'' said Simon Kippon, the American
magazine's publisher in Britain. ``In the end, we decided ... we'd
make the point with the blank space.''
   The magazine, owned by the Hearst Corp., sells 13,000 copies a
month in Ireland.
   Another Hearst women's magazine, Company, pulled an eight-page
supplement on abortion from the March issue of its Irish edition
because it included clinic addresses.
   ``The Cosmopolitan initiative was serious and Company's
self-censorship was even more so,'' Ms. Riddick said. ``Once you
put those kind of precedents in place, they can be applied across
the board.''

<HEAD>Nation's Snowiest Town Awaits Spring At Bottom Of Drift</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of the nation's snowiest town
are proud of how they've shoveled, burrowed and bulldozed through
this winter's record snowfall of more than 40 feet.
   But after more than three months of steady snow, even the most
devoted fans of winter start pining for that distant rumor called
spring.
   ``I don't think it's ever going to melt,'' airplane scheduler
Nettie Pike said recently while waiting out yet another storm at
the Valdez airport. ``This is the new Ice Age.''
   Streets have become trenches, walled in by 10-foot snowbanks so
enduring that kids paint graffiti on them. Drifts reach halfway up
second-floor windows, and six snow-heavy boats have capsized in the
harbor.
   Valdez, crowded onto a narrow plain by Prince William Sound,
forms an ideal catch basin for the ocean-spawned snow storms that
stall against the steep-walled Chugach Mountains behind town.
   At last official count, snow on the ground measured 105 inches,
though depths vary throughout town. In the lee of hills, the
branches of buried trees claw up through snowdrifts. Downtown,
bulldozers push icy boulders a ton at a time into mountains 45 feet
high.
   Residents don't let it keep them from their business. Interrupt
their shoveling for a moment and most will say, a bit defensively,
that they don't mind the snow.
   ``At least it's not cold,'' Gene McDaniel said as he tried to
start his snow-blower at 20 degrees. ``Over the mountains in the
interior, it really gets cold. I'd much rather have this snow than
45 below.''
   That's not to say there aren't inconveniences.
   McDaniel figured it was time to shovel his roof one night when a
mass of snow sloughed off, blocking his front door and trapping him
and his guests. His snow-clearing bill this season stands at $700.
   Workers at the state Department of Environmental Conservation
office ran out of room while plowing the parking lot, so they
started pushing snow up onto a nearby pile. An angry neighbor soon
arrived, shouting: ``You're putting your snow on my pile. Take it
off!''
   Ed Nielsen, maintenance man at the Village Inn motel, said he's
been shoveling steadily for a month, tunneling down to fire exits
and fighting a losing battle to keep drifts from walling up the
windows.
   ``It feels like you're in a dungeon,'' Neilsen said. ``People
start getting itchy feet and getting cranky at each other.''
   ``People are kind of schizophrenic,'' said Bob Donald, director
of the Valdez National Health Center. ``In the summer, everyone's
busy as a bee. In the winter, a lot of people sleep longer. They
come home from work, eat, watch some TV and are in bed by 9
o'clock. And they still feel like they're not getting enough rest.
It's kind of a self-imposed hibernation.''
   Attendance is up at the public library, where travel books about
Hawaii are popular.
   Last fall, many Valdez residents were looking forward to the
slower pace winter brings. The town's population of 3,000 more than
doubled last summer after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the largest
in U.S. history. But when Exxon suspended its cleanup Sept. 15, the
crowds thinned, and Valdez was left to face its snow alone.
   The first measureable snow fell Oct. 23. By the end of December,
it was halfway up first-floor windows. January's snowfall of 158
inches broke the local one-month record, and on Feb. 13, when
snowfall topped 384.7 inches, it erased the modern-day seasonal
record set in 1987. The National Weather Service didn't start
recording the town's snowfalls until 1972.
   Last week, another storm pushed the snowfall toward the 500-inch
mark, said weather service spokesman Lynn Chrystal.
   Chrystal, who doubles as Valdez' mayor, concedes the town's
snows don't match nearby Thompson Pass, considered Alaska's
snowiest spot. Nor does Valdez compare to Paradise Ranger Station
at Mount Rainier, Wash., which set the nation's seasonal snowfall
record with 93.5 feet in the winter of 1971-72.
   But those are isolated outposts, Chrystal said. Valdez, with an
annual average snowfall of about 25 feet, qualifies as the nation's
snowiest town, he said.
   For now, many residents hide in taverns like the Pipeline Club,
where they can play a round of darts (a wintertime obsession here)
or hear Louie the bartender brag for the hundredth time about the
halibut he caught last spring.
   Ah, yes, spring _ when cars lost for the winter rise out of
melting snowbanks and the mountains turn from white to brown to
green.
   Chrystal's forecast, both as weatherman and mayor: ``There's
optimism in the air. We know that winter is not too much longer.''
   It stops snowing by May, and most on the ground melts by June,
though patches persist well into July, Chrystal said. While that
may seem a chilly springtime, it's the sweetest time of year to the
snow-weary people of Valdez.
   ``There's something about April,'' Chrystal said dreamily. ``The
sky is the bluest of any time of year. It's just breathtaking. I
can't wait until the ice melts off my boat.''

<HEAD>Martin Mull Fine, His New CBS Sitcom Not</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There are times you wish CBS would put on a
Monday series with nothing but saxophone and violin concertos. Then
critics could again gripe about all the sax and violins on TV.
   But no, it keeps putting on lame situation comedies, such as
``His &amp; Hers,'' which premieres tonight. The show stars Martin
Mull, whose last CBS sitcom, ``Domestic Life,'' expired after a
short run in 1984.
   Here, he plays a marriage counselor beginning his second
marriage after one ex-wife and two kids. His bride, played by
Stephanie Faracy, also is a marriage counselor. They work together,
trying to save marriages.
   Mull is a funny guy whose dossier of far better work includes
``The History of White People in America,'' the movie ``Serial,''
and ``Fernwood 2-Night.'' He's also a fine guitarist with a good
ear for jazz.
   Were CBS wise, it would give him a half-hour variety series,
tell him to do whatever the spirit moves him to do each week in
music, comedy, art or just putting on airs, and then stand by.
   But no, it gives him another routine sitcom.
   The only really good thing about this one is that at dawn and at
bedtime, he usually throws Fluffy the cat out the bedroom window.
The bad part is that the bedroom is on only the second floor.
   It's easy to tell the show is set in Los Angeles. The premiere
concerns the ceaseless craving of Mull's much younger second wife
for a baby. This is not unusual. Hollywood is baby-crazed these
days.
   Make-me-pregnant plots keep popping up on TV, in shows like
NBC's new ``Grand'' and earlier in ``L.A. Law.'' The desire for
tykes almost has replaced the plight of the Brazilian rain forest
as Hollywood's No. 1 concern.
   Here, baby lust leads to a trip to a fertility clinic,
predictable jokes about a low sperm count and wifely lines like:
``Your little guys aren't swimming. They're just kind of
dog-paddling in place.''
   Tonight's epic starts with our couple awakened at dawn by a
phone call from a anguished patient. Seems he caught his wife
messing around ``with Manuel, the pool man.''
   They offer advice, hang up and the show gets to the plot point.
Mull is pressed by his wife to render her pregnant. He says they've
been trying for six months and ``you can't say it hasn't been fun.''
   Says she: ``That's the trouble. You're not supposed to have fun.
You need to concentrate when you're trying to have a baby.''
   Right. We also learn that his teen-aged son (Blake Soper) lives
with them, that his teen-aged daughter (Lisa Picotte) lives with
his ex-wife (Randee Heller), and that the ex-wife comes by for
dinner and one-liners.
   Also loose here is Mull's best friend (Richard Kline), a divorce
lawyer who has five kids and cheats on his spouse _ although not
with the wife of Manuel, the pool man.
   In all fairness, the debut show, written by the series'
executive producers, Patricia Jones and Donald Reiker, does give
Mull one good line.
   His predictably flaky secretary (Blair Tefkin) says one of his
patients just called to report that her husband is a pervert. He
likes to wear women's garter belts and stockings under his National
Guard uniform.
   Mull shrugs. ``Well,'' he says, ``I suppose that's OK during
peacetime.''

   TWO MORE REASONS TO KEEP BREATHING: On March 21, CBS will
premiere a pair of new comedy series. One is ``Sydney,'' starring
Valerie Bertinelli as a private eye ``trying to meet the challenges
of being young and single in Los Angeles.''
   The other show is ``Normal Life,'' about ``a slightly off-center
but very real household in the Hollywood Hills.'' Its stars include
Dweezil and Moon Unit Zappa. They're offspring of rock star Frank
Zappa, who last week did a three-day guest-host gig on a Financial
News Network show.

<TEXT>
   Silviu Brucan put it in writing more
than two years ago: By 1990, a new generation would be leading
Eastern Europe.
   As he watched the dominoes tumble last year, however, the
Stalinist-turned-dissident feared he had been wrong about his own
country.
   ``When December came, I got frightened that I have only one
month, and when Dec. 22 came I was relieved,'' he said with a broad
smile. ``We did it.''
   Brucan, 74, is the ``eminence grise'' of the National Salvation
Front, which took over when Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu
was overthrown Dec. 22 and executed Dec. 25.
   He has resigned from its leadership but remains in his large
office, giving advice and planning the Front's campaign for the May
20 election.
   Two months after a popular uprising ended Ceausescu's 24-year
reign, the revolution in little Romania is having an impact on the
two Communist giants, the Soviet Union and China, Brucan said.
   Millions of Chinese whose pro-democracy uprising was crushed by
the army in June are fixated on the success of Romanian uprising,
which the army supported, he said in an interview.
   ``It's a Romanian obsession in China, and that will topple'' the
Communists, he said. ``And not only in China. I think it affected,
perhaps even more so, the Soviet Union.''
   Before December's events in Romania, he said, the decisions of
the Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee, including
relinquishing its monopoly on power, ``were inconceivable.''
   Brucan has been a journalist, academic and ambassador _ to the
United States in 1956-1959 and the United Nations in 1959-1962.
Once a Stalinist and ranking Communist Party member, he broke with
Ceausescu in 1965.
   Ceausescu put him under house arrest in March 1989, along with
five others who signed an open letter criticizing the dictator.
   His re-emergence in revolutionary Romania has been
controversial. Brucan has been denounced both as a Stalinist and as
an advocate of the economic policies of Mikhail Gorbachev.
   By his own definition, Brucan rejected Stalinism long ago and is
committed to multiparty democracy.
   Communist parties in Eastern Europe ``are doomed to extinction''
by a scientific and technological revolution that created distinct
social groups and virtually destroyed the working class that was
their base of support, he said.
   In an article published in September 1987 by the Boston monthly
WorldPaper, and reprinted in the International Herald Tribune, he
foresaw the collapse of the Soviet bloc dictatorships.
   ``Conservative leaders clinging to economic orthodoxy face a
formidable challenge that is bound to accelerate the changing of
the guard,'' he wrote. ``By 1990 a new political generation will be
in command all over Eastern Europe.''
   Brucan said the power of Romania's revolution was a surprise.
   ``I didn't expect a popular explosion of such magnitude,'' he
said in the interview. ``Especially, I didn't expect the youth in
Romania to have such a high political and civic conscience.''
   As he watched the rise of Solidarity in Poland and signs of
democratization in other Soviet bloc countries, Brucan said, his
main concern was to keep from being killed by Ceausescu.
   Brucan was first put under house arrest after criticizing the
dictator's handling of riots in Brasov in 1987.
   In October 1988, unexpectedly, he was offered a passport to go
to the United States. Fearing a trap, Brucan said, he decided to
stop in London and Moscow ``and make my name known so much
internationally that the price of killing me was so high that
Ceausescu could not pay.''
   Pressure from the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union
saved him from arrest on his return in late November 1988, he said.
   The Soviets made ``a very reluctant'' promise of support if
Ceausescu fell, Brucan said, but he described Western press reports
of a conspiracy to oust the dictator as ``trash.''
   ``If there was a plot and we succeeded ... don't you think we
should have boasted about it and made political capital about
it?,'' he asked. ``It would have strengthened considerably our
legitimacy, and political modesty has no place, particularly at a
time of revolution.''
   The National Salvation Front, a group of 150 intellectuals,
dissidents and workers, initially pledged to stay out of the coming
election, but reneged last month.
   Daily protests culminated in its agreement three weeks ago to
share power with 37 political groups in a Council of National Unity
that will govern until the election.
   Brucan said the most difficult thing ``was to convince people to
share power with the other political parties and to get across the
point ... that a strong opposition is essential in a democracy.''

<TEXT>
   Robert E. Lee is plotting an offensive this
spring in Tennessee. But instead of leading a fight between
Confederate and Union troops, Lee's battle involves spirits.
   Bob Lee IV, great-grandson of the Civil War general, is in the
liquor business.
   As chairman of the tiny, privately owned A. Smith Bowman Inc.
distillery, Lee is taking on a much bigger foe on the opposition's
home turf _ Tennessee-based Jack Daniel _ in a bid to double sales
of Bowman's Virginia Gentleman bourbon in that state.
   Lee, 65, says his company isn't setting out to become an
industry giant, but in Virginia, it's as big as his family's name.
   ``We are the No. 1 alcoholic beverage label in the state,'' he
said.
   That ranking was achieved largely because of Bowman's Virginia
Vodka, which sells about 150,000 cases a year in the state. Bowman
also has just gone international with an order from Poland for
50,000 cases of vodka, the largest single order for one product in
the company's history.
   Bowman's mainstay, Virginia Gentleman bourbon, is No. 2 in the
state behind national leader Jim Beam. Virginia Gentleman also is
sold in seven other states from Pennsylvania to North Carolina and
a pocket in Atlanta.
   Two years ago, Bowman introduced its own gin, which accounts for
about 12,000 cases a year.
   Lee is a born salesman whose accent reflects his New York roots.
His father was a Columbia University-educated doctor who practiced
in the city.
   But Lee was sent to private school in Virginia and in 1949
graduated from Washington &amp; Lee University in Lexington, where his
great-grandfather served as president after the Civil War.
   After college, he moved to the West Coast and became an
advertising executive for the San Francisco Chronicle. Twenty years
ago, he joined Bowman when his brother-in-law, A. Smith Bowman Jr.,
asked him to take over sales and marketing duties at the company
founded in 1935 by Bowman's father, A. Smith Bowman Sr.
   ``I basically like sales,'' said Lee, whose first decision at
Bowman was to hire a public relations executive and begin traveling
the state to give civic club speeches and newspaper and television
interviews to promote Virginia Gentleman.
   ``I went down to Lynchburg one time and was on a cooking show,''
he said. ``I'd never cooked in my life. But we did it for half an
hour and gave away recipes. It was fun.''
   Lee, who eventually succeeded the Bowmans as chairman of the
nation's oldest family-owned independent bourbon distillery, also
played a role in the decision to diversify the firm's products.
   ``Here we had one product _ bourbon,'' he said. ``Nationally,
bourbon was not going anywhere.''
   Bourbon's share of the liquor market dwindled from 14 percent in
1978 to 10.8 percent in 1988. But the trend was evident early on,
and Bowman got into the vodka business in 1982, Lee said.
   When the company's vodka went on the market, it got a boost from
then-Gov. Charles S. Robb, who launched his ``We Have it Made in
Virginia'' campaign at the same time. ``That was pure luck,'' Lee
said.
   The company's gin came out two years ago. While Lee has been
searching for new directions to take the company, Bowman is not
ready to become a major national player in the liquor field, he
said.
   Although sales of bourbon are slumping nationally, Lee said
there still are plenty of bourbon drinkers to woo away from
competitors.
   A dozen years ago, Bowman entered into a partnership with a
wholesaler in Florida and Texas and attempted for 18 months to sell
Virginia Gentleman in those two states. ``It just didn't work,''
Lee said.
   ``So having done that, we realize we can't go big league like
Jim Beam,'' he said. ``We never would have known if we hadn't
tried.''
   Lee keeps a small bust of Gen. Lee in his office, but most of
the family decorations are related to his children,
   He said people always want to hear stories about his
great-grandfather.
   ``But we don't have any special anecdotes in the family about
General Lee,'' he said. ``One of the major reasons is that
everybody got married late in life. My father never knew his
grandfather, and my father was in his 50s when I was born.
   ``We had a sense of history, but we didn't have anybody sitting
in someone's lap telling about something that wasn't in Dr.
Freeman's or Bruce Catton's books,'' Lee said of the Pulitzer
Prize-winning biography of his great-grandfather by Douglas
Southall Freeman and works by Civil War historian Catton. ``That's
just the way it was.''
   What Lee has in mind for the Tennessee offensive is a taste
test, a battle of the bourbons.
   ``It's going to be Kentucky vs. Tennessee vs. Virginia,'' he
said.
   How far is he willing to go to win?
   ``A Southern gentleman will go to any lengths to maintain the
family honor,'' according to a Bowman brochure. ``A Virginia
gentleman will go only to honorable lengths.''

   _Feb. 22 _ Eastern and unsecured creditors announce agreement on
a new reorganization plan that would require Continental to step in
and make some payments to the creditors. The plan would pay the
creditors about 50 cents on the dollar.
   _March 1 _ A bankruptcy court examiner says Texas Air unfairly
drained assets from Eastern and it has agreed to pay the subsidiary
$280 million in compensation. The examiner's report supports a
longstanding contention by Eastern unions that Texas Air was
bleeding the airline.

   Dan Webb, the Iran-Contra prosecutor handling
the case against John Poindexter, is described by colleagues as one
of the finest trial attorneys in the country.
   When he was U.S. attorney in Chicago, he won convictions against
crooked cops and corrupt judges.
   Webb's trademark, as former President Reagan found out two weeks
ago, is his skillful cross-examination of witnesses.
   In videotaped testimony for Poindexter's trial, Reagan suggested
it might have been all right to destroy documents in the
Iran-Contra affair. Webb countered by pulling out a written answer
Reagan had given two years ago to a federal grand jury saying that
no destruction of documents had been authorized by the president.
   When one of Reagan's answers strayed far afield from the
prosecutor's question, Webb angered the former chief executive by
interrupting him to announce he had been unresponsive.
   ``If they wanted to find one of the best trial lawyers in
America, they did,'' Republican Gov. James Thompson of Illinois,
who has known Webb for 19 years, said of last summer's decision by
Iran-Contra prosecutors to hire Webb for the Poindexter case.
   Webb, 44, is a partner at the Chicago law firm of Winston &amp;
Strawn.
   He grew up in Bushnell, Ill., and applied to become an assistant
U.S. attorney in Chicago in 1971. An interviewer wrote the letters
NBBR on his application, which stood for ``nice boy, but rural,''
recalls then-U.S. attorney William Bauer, who hired him immediately.
   Webb ``was highly motivated, sincere and he desperately wanted
to be an assistant U.S. attorney; the combination made it so you
couldn't turn him down,'' recalls Bauer, now chief judge of the 7th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago.
   While running the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago, Webb
personally tried the ``Marquette 10'' case. Ten Chicago police
officers were accused of taking bribes from drug dealers to protect
drug activity; and all 10 were convicted.
   ``I think that had not Dan Webb gotten involved, we would have
had a better chance of convincing a jury'' that the police officers
should be acquitted, said Chicago defense attorney Daniel J. Pierce.
   As a defense attorney, Webb developed a novel strategy in the
fraud case of two sports agents who were representing college
athletes. Through skillful cross-examination, Webb drew the jury's
attention away from his client and focused it on the gross
disregard some of the nation's major universities have had for NCAA
rules and academic standards.
   Webb ``has a baby face which has every mother on the jury
nodding when he talks,'' says Thompson.
   The governor of Illinois calls the prosecutor in the Poindexter
case ``smart ... tough ... he very strongly believes in the
integrity of law and the integrity of law enforcement.''

   Richard Beckler, who is defending John
Poindexter in the Iran-Contra affair, has handled some of the most
high-profile cases Washington has had to offer.
   At the Justice Department in the 1970s, Beckler supervised
criminal investigations of major U.S. corporations making overseas
payoffs to get business with foreign governments. A number of
companies entered guilty pleas in connection with the bribes.
   As a defense attorney, Beckler represented Reagan campaign
official and subsequent CIA director William Casey in the
controversy known as Debategate, in which aides to Ronald Reagan
gained possession of documents from the camp of then-President
Carter in 1980.
   During the congressional hearings into the Iran-Contra affair,
Beckler was seen on national television forcefully defending
Poindexter.
   Beckler has obtained videotaped testimony from Reagan for
Poindexter's trial. He also won a court ruling that limits the
scope of potentially damaging testimony by Oliver North,
Poindexter's former subordinate who ran the secret Contra resupply
network and was at the heart of the Iran arms-sale initiative.
   Beckler's handling of Poindexter's case is typical of the
lawyer's style _ ``a thoughtful, carefully planned defense in which
he is paying a lot of attention to detail,'' says Washington
attorney John J. Cassidy.
   Beckler, who grew up in Brooklyn, is characterized by colleagues
in the defense bar as a ``scrapper'' and a ``street-fighter.''
Detractors say he is unnecessarily bombastic.
   But ``if I were in a tough situation and I had an opportunity to
put together my team, he'd be on it, and I wouldn't want him to be
on the other side,'' said Hank Schuelke, a partner in a Washington
law firm.
   ``Assuming he's got the skills and the intellect, which he does,
Dick Beckler is my notion of what a trial lawyer ought to be,''
said Schuelke.
   Beckler has operated effectively in defending corporate clients
in grand jury investigations. He is cast with some frequency in the
role of trying to persuade the government not to bring criminal
charges.
   ``If one word describes Dick Beckler it's `relentless,''' said
Washington attorney A. Raymond Randolph. ``He turns over every
stone and never gives up.''
   ``He is a man of very high integrity and he has a reputation for
that,'' said Randolph. ``If he deals with government officials,
they know they are dealing with a straight shooter.''
   A product of Williams College and Fordham Law School, Beckler
spent four years as a prosecutor in the office of then-Manhattan
district attorney Frank Hogan and worked for six years in the
Justice Department's fraud section, eventually becoming its chief.
   In 1979, he joined the Washington office of Fulbright &amp;
Jaworski, specializing in white-collar criminal defense work,
although he has handled some civil litigation as well.

   The U.S. manufacturing economy slowed in
February for the 10th consecutive month, according to a survey of
the nation's purchasing managers.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said Thursday
its index rose to 48.3 percent in February from 45.2 percent in
January. A reading below 50 indicates the U.S. manufacturing
economy generally is declining; above 50, that it generally is

<HEAD>Strong February Sales Gains For Some Major Retailers</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Retail Sales-Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Respectable sales growth last month at some of the country's
leading chain stores partly reflected unusually warm weather and a
good response to new spring merchandise.
   But industry analysts foresee another tough time for retailers
in 1990 as competition continues to eat into profitability.
   Fewer general merchandise chains, discounters and department
stores issued their results Thursday than usually do on the first
Thursday of the month because of differences in sales-reporting
calendars.
   Monroe Greenstein, an analyst at Bear Stearns &amp; Co. Inc., said
retailers probably will have a mediocre year in 1990, similar to
1989. February marks the start of the fiscal year for many
retailers.
   Jeffrey Feiner of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc., said: ``We remain
somewhat cautious'' given continuing high consumer debt levels and
sluggish trends in the financial and real estate markets.
   Some analysts believe ``rolling recessions'' have been rippling
through parts of the manufacturing sector, such as the automobile
industry.
   A widely watched barometer of manufacturing health showed a 10th
straight monthly decline in the sector during February. The
National Association of Purchasing Management's index stood at 48.3
percent in February, up from 45.2 percent in January. A reading
below 50 indicates that the U.S. manufacturing economy is generally
declining.
   Analysts were reluctant to attach too much significance to the
retail results because February is typically a slow time for
business. January and February are transition months as winter
merchandise is cleared out to make room for fresh spring lines.
   In contrast to the chains that did well last month, Sears,
Roebuck and Co., the country's biggest retailer, continued to
struggle.
   The giant Chicago-based general merchant, which began a new
merchandising strategy a year ago hoping to reverse years of
market-share losses, had a ho-hum February. Sales were virtually
flat, at $2.127 billion in the four weeks ended Feb. 24, vs. $2.126
billion a year earlier.
   Sales at Sears stores open a year or longer edged up only 1.5
percent.
   Retailers and industry analysts prefer to focus on sales
comparisons for stores operating at least a year, called same-store
or comparable-store results. Newly opened stores typically enjoy a
period of unusually brisk business that isn't sustained over time.
   One standout among the retailers reporting Thursday was Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. The big Bentonville, Ark.-based discount chain said its
February sales surged 33 percent to $1.95 billion from $1.47
billion a year earlier. Sales at Wal-Marts open a year or longer
posted a healthy 17 percent gain.
   By either measure, Wal-Mart consistently has been a star
performer as it expands across the country.
   Currently ranked No. 3, there is widespread speculation in the
industry that Wal-Mart this year could overtake Sears and K mart
Corp. in merchandise sales volume in the United States.
   K mart, based in Troy, Mich., recently stepped up efforts to
respond to the challenge.In a bid to boost sales and profit, K mart
will accelerate its store opening and renovation program, taking a
$422 million after-tax charge to carry out the plan.
   K mart's report on last month's sales will be released March 8.
   Many of the retailers who in recent years have reported their
monthly results on the first Thursday of every month will be
reporting later in March. There is an effort being made within the
industry to reach a compromise on a single monthly reporting date
for the rest of 1990.
   Here are some reports released Thursday:
   Dallas-based department store operator J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said
sales at its stores and through its catalogs rose 8.1 percent in
February to $880 million from $814 million a year earlier. Sales at
stores open for at least a year were up 7.2 percent.
   Melville Corp., the Harrison, N.Y.-based owner of off-price and
other retailers, said February sales rose 11.7 percent to $503.2
million from a year earlier's $450.6 million.
   Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., based in Chicago, reported a 2.5 percent
February sales gain to $299 million from $291.8 million. Last
year's figures were restated to exclude discontinued lines.
   Woolworth Corp., the New York-based parent of numerous specialty
stores including the Foot Locker sports shoe chain, said its
domestic February sales jumped 13.7 percent to $330 million from
$291 million. Same-store sales rose 11.7 percent.
   Harold E. Sells, chairman and chief executive officer, said:
``February's double-digit percentage gains in total and domestic
sales were the highest for that reporting period in over 10 years.''

   Here are the domestic sales reported Thursday by some of the
nation's largest general retailers for February, the first month of
their fiscal years.
   Due to differing calendars, many of the major companies that in
recent years issued monthly results on the first Thursday of each
month will report later in March. K mart Corp., The Limited Inc.,
and some other major retailers will report on March 8, for example.
   Several top retailers do not report their sales monthly at all,
including: Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores
Corp., the Campeau Corp. units; R.H. Macy &amp; Co.; and Batus Inc. Not
all retailers have the same fiscal year.

   For Mary Rodas, playing with toys is
just another day at the office.
   But as vice president of a company that expects more than $20
million in sales this year, the 14-year-old Ms. Rodas is not just
playing around.
   The eighth-grader is an executive for Catco Inc., a
Manhattan-based company that develops and licenses toys.
   Other companies use kids to test their products, but Catco says
none of them have reached the executive ranks like Ms. Rodas.
   She takes taxis or limousines from Union City to her office in
nearby Manhattan three times a week. Her high school and college
education is already paid for. And she has a stock portfolio that
includes investments in IBM, Walt Disney Co., General Electric Co.
and the Hershey Co.
   ``If an idea's good enough, I say so,'' Ms. Rodas said,
explaining her job. ``If there's something to improve, I say what
needs to be done to fix things up.''
   Kidstuff?
   ``It's more than that,'' said Catco president Barbara Carver.
``Most kids can't say specifically what their problem with the toy
is. They'll just say `I don't like that,' or `This isn't fun.' With
Mary, she'll say it needs more colors or more of this or that.
   ``She's just very bright,'' Ms. Carver said. ``She's very
perceptive and willing to speak her mind.''
   Ms. Rodas said her consulting career began at age 4 when her
father, a Salvadoran immigrant working as a custodian, brought her
along as he made repairs to a neighbor's apartment. There, she
noticed a man laying tile.
   ``Since I was a little kid my father used to take me from
apartment to apartment so I used to see how it was done,'' Ms.
Rodas said. ``I knew my father never put tiles in that way. I
criticized him and told him he wasn't doing the job right.''
   The man was Donald Spector, who lived in the same building as
the Rodas family.
   Spector struck up an acquaintance with the girl and became so
impressed with her ideas, he decided to make her vice president
when he founded Catco, a subsidiary of Catalyst Applied
Technologies, which he co-founded.
   Ms. Rodas won't say how much her stock is worth, but it's more
than she would make setting up a lemonade stand. She doesn't draw a
salary, and she can't touch the stock Catco has put in trust for
her until she turns 18.
   For Catco, paying for the stocks and limousines and the office
is worth it.
   ``She's able to tell us which way to develop things early on,''
Ms. Carver said. ``That way we don't get all the way to the end of
the road and find we should have done something different.''
   Her latest project is Balzac, a balloon in a patented cloth sack.
   It can be hit with a racket, bat or stick, and can even be sat
on without busting.
   When Ms. Rodas first bounced it around, the sack was made of
white muslin.
   ``I told them it was too plain,'' she said. ``They needed
something to liven it up. I told them to put on some neon colors.''
   The sack now is a patchwork of brilliant colors.
   The job aside, Ms. Rodas said she's like any other 14-year-old
girl.
   ``I still have an ordinary life,'' she said. ``I'm an ordinary
kid. The only thing different is I have a job.''

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Probe Finds Texas Air Victimized Eastern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp. has agreed to pay Eastern
Airlines more than $280 million to settle a bankruptcy examiner's
findings that it bought the subsidiary's assets at unfairly low
prices.
   The findings released Thursday by examiner David I. Shapiro
supported a key contention by striking Eastern workers, who claimed
Texas Air stripped their company of its most valuable assets to
bolster the parent's non-union carrier, Continental Airlines.
   However, Shapiro did not agree with the union's request that
Eastern be run by an outside trustee. The unions had sought the
move as protection against further predations by Texas Air during
Eastern's bankruptcy reorganization.
   Texas Air rejected Shapiro's findings about the sale of assets
but said it would make the settlement payment in order to help
bolster Eastern.
   ``Texas Air and Eastern categorically reject any conclusions in
the Shapiro report that intercompany transactions between Eastern
and its affiliates formed the basis for any material liability,''
the two companies said in a statement issued after a court hearing
on the report.
   The statement said Shapiro's report is full of ``faulty
analyses, hearsay evidence, statements taken out of context and
misstatements of fact.''
   Union attorneys said the report vindicated the workers'
position, but they insisted that a trustee still needs to be named
to run the company.
   ``The wrongdoers are simply to be slapped on the wrist,'' Bruce
Simon, an attorney for the Air Line Pilots Association, told the
hearing.
   Approval of the settlement by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R.
Lifland could remove a main obstacle in the airline's effort to
emerge from bankruptcy, because some of the compensation would help
satisfy creditor claims against Eastern.
   Lifland said the proposed settlement can be viewed, in some
ways, as ``Texas Air buying Eastern again.''
   The proposed settlement includes $150 million to $250 million
that Eastern would recover from Texas Air for the transfer of the
System One computer reservation system, and $61 million for Texas
Air's acquisition of Eastern in November 1986.
   In addition, Eastern would receive a 25 percent share in System
One and the right to buy 40 Boeing 737-300 jets at cost from sister
carrier Continental. The settlement's total value is estimated at
more than $280 million and includes $133 million in cash.
   Separately, Lifland approved Eastern's request that $60 million
be taken from escrow funds to help finance its operations this
month. The funds contain about $550 million raised by the sale of
Eastern assets since it sought bankruptcy court protection last
March 9.
   Shapiro issued his findings following a lengthy investigation
into the dealings between Texas Air, Eastern and Continental as
part of Eastern's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case.
   The company sought protection from creditors five days after the
beginning of a strike by machinists, flight attendants and pilots
that virtually grounded it. Eastern has been reorganizing as a
smaller carrier and has hired replacements for many of the strikers.
   The pilots and flight attendants unions abandoned the strike in
November but Machinists remain on strike.
   In the 300-page report, Shapiro said that in 12 cases out of 15
there was substantial evidence Texas Air transferred ssets worth
between $285 million and $403 million from Eastern without
adequately compensating the airline.
   In Miami, where Eastern has its headquarters, President Phil
Bakes said the settlement would help expedite the airline's
emergence from bankruptcy court protection, which he expected by
the end of June.
   The unions had long demanded the bankruptcy court appoint a
trustee to run Eastern instead of Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo,
but Shapiro said in his investigation that the request might
cripple the airline.
   Nonetheless, Shapiro recommended the appointment of a special
monitoring committee, with much less authority than a trustee, to
scrutinize how Texas Air deploys assets among its businesses.
   The examiner had been investigating Eastern, its finances and
relationships with Continental and Texas Air since early September
because of conflict of interest questions raised by the unions and
Eastern creditors.
   This issue became particularly significant after Eastern
proposed a reorganization plan that did not include full repayment
for its creditors.
   If Texas Air had taken Eastern planes, routes and other assets
from the airline and given them to Continental, they theoretically
would be out of reach of Eastern's creditors.
   Eastern sold the System One computerized reservation system to
Texas Air in April 1987 for about $100 million. Last week, Texas
Air said it would sell half of System One to a General Motors
subsidiary for $250 million, suggesting it was worth far more than
what Texas Air had paid to Eastern.
   As part of the settlement worked out by Shapiro, Eastern would
get a 25 percent share in System One, with 50 percent to be owned
by the GM subsidiary, Electronic Data Systems Corp., and the
remaining 25 percent by Continental.

<HEAD>Bank To Withhold Dividends, Submit to Tight Government Control</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of New England Corp. is now working under the
official guidance of the federal government, with orders to tighten
lending practices, withhold stock dividends and review the
competence of senior managers.
   Federal regulators had been scrutinizing the bank for months
because of its mountain of bad real estate loans, which forced the
company to post massive losses last year.
   On Thursday, Bank of New England announced it had signed federal
consent orders outlining steps the bank must take to restore its
financial health.
   ``We regard these orders as cooperative plans we undertake in
partnership with federal regulators,'' said H. Ridgely Bullock, the
bank's interim chairman. ``They all speak to running a better
bank.''
   The consent orders do not include plans to cut the company's
work force, but Bullock confirmed the bank expects to lay off
thousands of workers, saying, ``We have to downsize our operation
considerably.''
   Under the orders, Bank of New England will need federal approval
to declare stock dividends, conduct financial transactions with its
subsidiaries and pay benefits to former employees.
   The bank also is required to tighten its lending practices and
not make any commercial real estate loans without following
prescribed guidelines.
   Furthermore, the bank must review the performance of its senior
managers and report any proposed changes to the government.
   The bank's board already has dismissed several top executives,
including former chairman Walter Connolly, who presided over the
bank's rapid growth before its problems surfaced last year.
   Bullock said the bank hoped to name a permanent chairman within
a week.
   Lawrence Fish, a former Bank of Boston Corp. executive, was
expected to be named the new chairman, but Bullock declined to
confirm that.
   The consent orders cover the bank holding company and its
Boston-based subsidiary, Bank of New England NA. Bullock said the
company's four other affiliate banks, which are based elsewhere in
New England, were expected to sign consent orders soon.
   The Boston branch also was ordered to raise its equity capital
to 3 percent of total assets by May 31, and develop a plan to reach
5 percent.
   The bank, however, has told the federal Comptroller of the
Currency that it does not expect to meet the May 31 deadline, and
Bullock said the bank hopes to get an extension. Bullock said he
expects the bank to operate under the consent order for a year or
more.
   Until late last year, Bank of New England was the region's
second-largest bank behind Bank of Boston. But the company took a
dramatic fall as a real estate slump forced the bank to boost its
reserves against bad loans.
   Bank of New England reported 1989 losses exceeding $1 billion,
and the company says it is studying whether it should have made
larger provisions against bad loans earlier in the year.
   In the meantime, Bank of New England has lost an estimated $5
billion worth of deposits, forcing the company to borrow money from
the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston while it tries to sell assets to
raise cash.
   The bank's borrowing is estimated above $1 billion, but Bullock
said he hopes Bank of New England ``will be out of the Fed by
April.''
   ``People look at borrowing from the Fed as a trend line to
obscurity. I disagree,'' he said. Instead, Bullock described the
borrowing as ``bridge financing'' as the bank sells about $6
billion worth of assets.
   Because of the cash crunch, the bank cannot afford to pay stock
dividends, Bullock said, adding that he would have expected the
bank to withhold payments regardless of the federal consent order.
   ``I don't expect to be able to pay dividends on common stock or
preferred stock for some time,'' he said.
   Bullock said the bank still hopes to find buyers for its
troubled loan portfolio, but he added, ``they have been harder to
find than buyers of other assets.''

<HEAD>Saab, Wall Street Journal Pick New Ad Agencies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The importer of Saab automobiles has picked one of the newer
advertising agencies, while The Wall Street Journal picked one of
the oldest in a pair of high-profile moves on Madison Avenue.
   Saab-Scania of America Inc. said Thursday it had selected
Angotti Thomas Hedge Inc. of New York to handle its $25 million
advertising account.
   The agency was created only five years ago, and the new job
boosts its total billings by more than 50 percent from about $45
million.
   Its other clients include KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Wild Turkey
bourbon, Kirin beer and Barron's, the weekly business and financial
publication that, like the Journal, is published by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
   Barrie Hedge, president of the agency, said the agency would get
to work immediately on advertising for the model 9000S that Saab
plans to introduce in mid-April. The appointment is effective April
2.
   Saab-Scania, based in Orange, Conn., said it picked Angotti
Thomas over two other New York-based agencies, Kirshenbaum &amp; Bond
and Slater-Hanft &amp; Martin.
   The account had been handled for the past 2{ years by the agency
Lord Einstein O'Neill &amp; Partners, an even younger agency that got
the account shortly after it was created.
   Lord Einstein is headed by several executives who abruptly quit
their old agency, Lord Geller Federico Einstein, in March 1988
after it was acquired by the British advertising conglomerate WPP
Group PLC.
   ``It was time for a change,'' said Roy Steinwolf, ad manager at
Saab-Scania, said Thursday in explaining why Saab-Scania launched a
search for a new agency in January.
   He said Saab sales in the United States have slipped over the
past three years, including a 12 percent decline in 1989, after
showing steady gains for the previous six years. Sales of European
imports generally have been weak.
   Saab-Scania has been using the ad slogan, ``The most intelligent
cars ever built,'' for several years and Steinwolf said whether to
continue that slogan is under discussion.
   The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, said Thursday it had
selected an agency that celebrated its 125th birthday last year, J.
Walter Thompson, to handle its advertising sales and circulation
advertising account.
   The daily newspaper declined to disclose how much it planned to
spend on advertising this year, although one trade publication
estimated it was $7.5 million.
   Thompson, also owned by WPP Group, was ranked the eighth-biggest
U.S. ad agency in 1988, handling worldwide advertising billings of
more than $3.8 billion and creating advertising for products such
as Kodak film and Kellogg cereals.
   The Journal's former ad agency was GSD&amp;M of Austin, Texas, which
had been hired in August 1988. Recent ads from GSD&amp;M described the
Journal as ``Faster, Tougher, Smarter.''
   GSD&amp;M had been hired to handle advertising during the Journal's
centennial celebration in 1989 and to promote and posiution the
newspaper's reorganized, three-section format in 1988.
   ``As business becomes ever more global, we foresee enormous
opportunities for the Journal in the '90s and beyond,'' said
publisher Peter Kann.
   He said Thompson ``has demonstrated that it can help us to
capitalize on these opportunities in the years ahead.''
   Thompson was believed to have been one of two finalists
considered for the job. Insiders who spoke on condition that they
not be identified said the other agency was Lord Einstein O'Neill &amp;
Partners, the agency that broke away from WPP Group.

<HEAD>Futures Regulators Approve Stricter Rules on Trading Cards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal commodities futures regulators have
taken another step to blunt the congressional criticism they have
weathered in the wake of a fraud scandal at the nation's two
largest futures exchanges.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the
industry, unanimously approve a change in rules governing the
trading cards that brokers and traders use to record commodity
futures and options transactions.
   The tougher rules will make it difficult to fabricate or alter
trading records, one of the allegations made in the fraud scandals
that rocked the two largest Chicago futures exchanges last summer.
   More than 40 traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the
Chicago Board of Trade were indicted on charges ranging from
racketeering to fraud for numerous alleged schemes to defraud
customers.
   During hearings for a CFTC reauthorization bill last fall,
members of Congress were very critical of the CFTC for allowing the
exchanges to police themselves on recording trades and other
record-keeping functions.
   A General Accounting Office study of four futures exchanges last
September found that at three of them, much of the record-keeping
is left to the traders and brokers themselves.
   The rules changes will require:
   _ the collection of trading records within a specified schedule;
   _ time-stamping the cards;
   _ using pre-printed, sequentially numbered cards that will be
unique to each exchange member
   _ recording trades on both trading cards and order tickets in
non-erasable ink.
   One of the allegations in the Chicago probe was that traders
would illegally alter records to correct costly errors or change
the time of a transaction to take advantage of a later, more
favorable price.
   The new rules also would require each exchange to submit a
written report to the commission _ no later than nine months after
the effective date of the regulation _ detailing the systems they
have put in place to meet the new requirements.
   Exchanges could seek exemption from the new rules if they can
demonstrate members are using hand-held computer terminals or other
automated means to recrod trades and eliminate fraud.
   Both the BOT and CME are developing hand-held computer terminals
that will replace paper trading cards but they are not expected to
be operative in the near future.

<TEXT>
   The departing president of Exxon Shipping Co.
called the wreck of the Exxon Valdez a tragedy that never should
have happened but said the huge Alaskan oil spill did not prompt
him to leave Exxon.
   Frank J. Iarossi said Thursday that although environmental
concerns for Prince William Sound were justified, criticism of
Exxon's cleanup efforts were sometimes unwarranted.
   ``One regret I had in that first week or so is that we didn't
have the opportunity to really show the human side of what people
were doing to try to bring that situation under control,'' Iarossi
said. ``There were people out there working for 22 hours.''
   In a telephone interview from his home in Houston, Iarossi said
he was leaving Exxon to become president of the American Bureau of
Shipping, an international ship classification society. He had been
in charge of the shipping division since 1982.
   In the first few days after the spill, Iarossi said press
coverage was ``reasoned and really trying to understand what had
happened. But somewhere after day five or six, when it hit the
beaches ... there was no way to balance or bring rationale to the
story.''
   News reports didn't emphasize that Exxon offloaded 1 million
barrels of oil from the Exxon Valdez ``without spilling a drop,''
he said. ``We were told by the state that the priority was to save
five hatcheries, which, in fact was done.''
   Exxon was unable to do much about the oil that had already
spilled out of the ship and fouled shorelines, though.
   ``It was clear that we won a lot of the battle, but as far as
the public was concerned, we lost the war,'' said Iarossi, who was
the first high-level Exxon official to arrive on the scene to
coordinate cleanup after the spill.
   The announcement of Iarossi's departure comes two days after a
federal grand jury in Anchorage indicted Exxon Shipping and its
parent, Exxon Corp., on criminal felony and misdemeanor charges
stemming from the March 24, 1989, spill.
   If convicted on all five counts, the company could face fines
exceeding $600 million. Exxon says it already has spent more than
$2 billion to clean up the effects of the nation's worst oil
disaster, which spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude into
Prince William Sound.
   The skipper of the Valdez, Joseph Hazelwood, is on trial in
Anchorage on felony, criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges that
include operating the vessel while intoxicated. If convicted, he
faces up to 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   Les Rogers, a spokesman for Exxon in Houston, said Iarossi's
departure from the company was unrelated to the spill.
   ``In answer to the question, did Exxon fire him, no we did
not,'' Rogers said.
   Iarossi said he received ``a whole bunch of nasty letters''
about the spill, condemning him as anti-environmentalist.
   ``I think there was a very emotional side to some of the
reaction that didn't benefit anybody except for a venting of
anger,'' he said.
   ``It certainly was a tragic incident and it never should have
happened. But I think Exxon Valdez became the lightning rod for a
lot of emotion that was already there, a lot of energy that was
already there,'' he said.
   Because of the spill, several members of Congress are proposing
that some tankers be required to have double hulls to protect
against oil spills.
   But Iarossi said double-hulls diminish tankers' capacity, which
would require the building of more tankers and possibly increase
environmental risks.
   Iarossi had been negotiating with the shipping bureau for
several months and was elected by the New Jersey-based group on
Feb. 26 to the posts of chairman of the board and president, Rogers
said. Iarossi's last day at Exxon will be March 30.
   After serving in the U.S. Coast Guard, Iarossi joined Exxon's
tanker division in 1968. From 1972 to 1976, he managed a tanker
construction program for Exxon in Japan. He later was a marine
advisor to Exxon and became assistant manager of Exxon's corporate
planning department in 1981.

<HEAD>London Shares Higher at Midday</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   LONDON (AP ) _ London shares were higher at midday Friday,
assisted by gains made on Wall Street and renewed confidence
following the successful sale of a large number of brewery shares.
   At about noon London time, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was 12.9 points, or 0.6 percent, higher at 2,251.3.
   The index was above its morning low of 2,240 and off its high of
2,252.7.
   Volume came to a moderate 378.9 million shares by midday,
compared with 193.7 million shares at the same time Thursday.
   The biggest event in Friday morning's session was the sale of
86.7 million shares in Scottish &amp; Newcastle breweries. The stake
was previously owned by Elders IXL Ltd., an Australian conglomerate.
   Traders said, however, that interest in London equities remains
disappointing, with many of the large institutional investors
holding off while fears of higher global interest rates prevail.
   ``I would not be putting large amounts of money in this
market,'' said one dealer.
   In the absence of substantial market-stirring news, traders said
London shares are again likely to follow Wall Street's lead.

<TEXT>
   The State of California today accused Charles
H. Keating Jr., the central figure in the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan
scandal, of casting a web of fraud to snare investors who paid $200
million for now-worthless ``junk bonds.''
   The civil investment-fraud lawsuit, which also names two Keating
associates, is the toughest action yet against Keating, whose
high-flying lifestyle and soured investments came to symbolize the
excesses of the S&amp;L industry in the 1980s.
   The lawsuit seeks repayment for the investors, many of them
elderly people who lost their life savings in the high-yield,
high-risk bonds. It could lead to millions of dollars in civil and
criminal judgments and years of prison time, officials said in
remarks prepared for a news conference today.
   They said files supporting the lawsuit had been turned over to
the district attorneys of Los Angeles and Orange counties for
possible criminal prosecution.
   Keating's Los Angeles attorney, James Ham, did not immediately
return a phone call seeking comment on the lawsuit.
   ``This is a shocking story of predatory sales practices
engineered from the top and carried out in Lincoln Savings branches
where every promotion and every bonus earned by employees created
an atmosphere of `sell, sell, sell,''' said Christine Bender,
commissioner of the state Corporations Department.
   Keating headed Lincoln's parent company, Phoenix-based American
Continental Corp. The lawsuit was filed late Thursday in Los
Angeles Superior Court.
   It is the first such charges filed against Keating by any
federal or state agency, said Ms. Bender.
   Lincoln's collapse is expected to be the most costly S&amp;L failure
ever, with taxpayers footing a $2 billion bailout bill. Keating
already was targeted in a class-action lawsuit on behalf of 22,000
Lincoln investors. That action, like the state's lawsuit, contends
they were led to believe their investments in ACC bonds were
federally insured, like regular deposits at S&amp;Ls.
   Ms. Bender said interviews with more than 100 American
Continental bondholders and Lincoln employees and analysis of
thousands of documents showed:
   _That prospectuses describing the bonds were routinely withheld
from customers;
   _That investors, many of them elderly, disabled and on fixed
incomes, were never told the bonds were uninsured;
   _That many investors were told the junk bonds were insured and
risk free.
   Ms. Bender said it may be hard to collect restitution because
American Continental is mired in bankruptcy proceedings in Phoenix,
but she said her department would ``pursue every avenue in seeking
restitution.''
   Also named as defendants are Judy J. Wischer and Andrew Ligget,
both of Phoenix, who held a variety of titles at American
Continental. The lawsuit also listed 200 ``John Doe'' defendants,
to be named later if additional evidence surfaces.
   The defendants are accused of fraud and misrepresentation in
connection with the offer and sale of securities; making false
filings with the Corporations Department; using unapproved
advertising in connection with the securities; and selling the
bonds in clear violation of the qualification requirements of state
law.

<TEXT>
   Workers at Campbell Soup Co.'s oldest
manufacturing plant pick up their final paychecks today as
production halts at the 121-year-old birthplace of condensed soup.
   The last can of pork and beans was scheduled to roll off the
production line at midnight.
   ``By 3 o'clock it will be a ghost town after 121 years,'' said
company spokesman James Moran.
   A skeleton crew will remain to dismantle equipment and ship
inventory from the warehouse. Moran said it's likely that the
plant, too, will be razed, along with the four huge soup cans that
have long dominated the skyline on the Delaware River across from
Philadelphia.
   The closing is part of a worldwide restructuring Campbell
announced last August that will eliminate 2,800 jobs in Camden and
at plants in Maryland and Tennesee. The move is expected to save
the company $15 million during fiscal 1990 and $150 million during
the next four years.
   The closure comes at a crucial time for this city of 85,000
residents, which is struggling to revitalize its business sector.
Many of the blue-collar employees at the plant have worked for
Campbell most of their lives and their future is uncertain.
   Employees, some garbed in drab green Campbell uniforms, gathered
in front of the eight-story building Thursday, shaking hands and
bidding farewells.
   ``Today is the funeral. Tomorrow is the burial,'' said Alvin
Apple Still, president of Local 80 of the United Food and
Commercial Workers, which represents about 640 of the hourly
employees in the plant. ``We've been let down.''
   Still, who worked at the plant for more than 40 years, is among
about 230 employees who qualify for a pension plan. The others
aren't as fortunate, he said.
   ``The rest of them will have to root for what they can find,''
Still said. ``There's no job market in the city.''
   The union and Campbell have agreed on severance payments, but an
arbitration hearing still has to be held on the pact. Production
from the plant will be moved to facilities in Napoleon, Ohio;
Paris, Texas and Maxton, N.C.
   ``I'm glad I worked here. Campbell Soup has given us a lot,''
said 57-year-old Merliane Parker, who worked at the plant for 25
years. ``But I'm glad I'm leaving.''
   Mrs. Parker and a handful of other workers who lingered outside
the building Thursday said they plan to take advantage of early
retirements, although they said they'll have to curb their spending.
   ``They have to go _ they have to go,'' Lucy Dematao said
shrugging her shoulders. ``They were good to everybody.''
   Campbell said it would have cost millions to renovate the plant.
The company is trying to improve its performance and pacify some
members of its founding family who are pushing for a sale of the
entire food-products giant.
   During its heyday in the 1930s, the Camden plant produced 10
million cans of red and white labeled soup varieties daily. In
recent times, output has averaged about one million cans a day of
Prego spaghetti sauce, Franco-American pasta and beans.
   For years, John T. Dorrance Jr., son of the
chemist-turned-entrepreneur who invented condensed soups, was
reluctant to close plants or lay off workers.
   But Dorrance Jr. died last April and since then, the company has
undergone major changes, including a split in the founding family
that has sparked speculation about the company being sold.
   Earlier this year, David Johnson became the first outsider
brought in to head the company.
   Despite the internal upheaval, Campbell has said it will
maintain its economic commitment to Camden. The plant had an annual
payroll of $48 million and pumped about $13 million worth of goods,
services and supplies into the regional economy yearly.
   Campbell has said it will build a $35 million headquarters on
the city's waterfront, but some state and local officials are
skeptical.
   Johnson said this week that between 100 and 500 employees would
be cut from the headquarters staff within the next several months,
Moran said. The spokesman also said the plans for the 200,000-foot
international headquarters remain under review.

<HEAD>Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola Classic Going Nationwide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first shipments of a caffeine-free version of
Coca-Cola Classic, the drink that appeared following the ``new
Coke'' uproar five years ago, will begin hitting stores this week.
   The nationwide rollout follows a successful market tryout in 10
cities, Coca-Cola USA officials said Thursday. Spokesman Bob
Bertini said the new product should be available across the nation
by the end of the month.
   An advertising campaign with the slogan, ``It's the real thing
... only caffeine free,'' also is under way, Bertini said.
   Caffeine-free Coke Classic is the Atlanta-based soft drink
company's fourth caffeine-free version of an existing product.
There are already caffeine-free versions of Coca-Cola, diet Coke
and Tab.
   ``The caffeine-free cola segment is one of the fastest growing
in the soft drink industry,'' Bertini said. Coke's best-selling
caffeine-free product is Caffeine-free diet Coke, which currently
has a 7.8 percent market share.
   Bertini said the appearance of caffeine-free Coke Classic did
not mean the company was giving up on Caffeine-free Coca-Cola,
which is a companion to the ``new Coke,'' that was introduced in
1985 to a wave of consumer complaints over the disappearance of the
original formula Coke.
   The company subsequently brought back the original formula under
the Coke Classic label, which became the nation's No. 1 soft drink
and overwhelmingly outsold new Coke.
   Caffeine-free Coke similarly has been a relatively weak
performer. Bertini said it has a ``very small share'' of the market.

   American Express and Primerica executives held discussions over
the weekend about a variety of combinations of the two Wall Street
firms _ including Shearson acquiring Smith Barney.
   But American Express Chairman James D. Robinson III and Shearson
Chief Executive Howard L. Clark Jr. reportedly told Shearson's
10,000 brokers in a conference call Thursday that talks were
terminated.
   An American Express spokesman confirmed that talks had been held
between Robinson and Primerica Chairman Sanford I. Weill about
various combinations of the firms. Officials said the talks were
conceptual and the executives never came close to a deal.
   A deal would have reunited old colleagues. Weill built up
Shearson in the 1970s before selling it to American Express in
1981. He left American Express in 1985 and took over Primerica, a
diversified financial services company, three years later.
   Shearson recently has been wracked by turmoil that culminated
with the ouster by Robinson of chairman Peter A. Cohen in January.
   American Express this week said it would pump $750 million in
capital on top of $250 million announced earlier to shore up the
firm and avoid a credit downgrading. Shearson also announced it
would lay off 2,000 of its 35,500 employees by the end of March as
part of a broad reduction program.
   ``We are proceeding with our $750 million capital infusion plan
for Shearson Lehman Hutton. Shearson Lehman Hutton is proceeding
with its strategic review,'' American Express said in a statement
late Thursday. Officials declined further comment on the Primerica
talks.
   Shearson has 10,000 stockbrokers in about 600 branches while
Smith Barney has 2,600 brokers in 95 branches.

   The stock market headed higher across a broad
front early today as the blue chips extended this week's advance.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which has gone up 71.40
points over the past four sessions, added an additional 21.62,
rising to 2,657.21 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues outdistanced declines on the New York Stock
Exchange by about 7 to 3, with 853 up, 370 down and 519 unchanged.

   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index gained

   Market analysts said today's advance was made possible by
momentum built up during four straight winning sessions.
   A new government reading on the economy released before the
start of trading had little direct impact on stock prices. But it
did reinforce the feeling that the economy isn't about to slump
into a recession, analysts said.

   K mart Corp. said Friday it has acquired
Sports Authority Inc., a sporting goods and apparel chain of Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla., for an undisclosed amount.
   K mart said Sports Authority, which currently has eight stores
featuring brand name apparel and sporting equipment, will operate
as a separate subsidiary.
   At least 10 additional Sports Authority stores are planned for

   Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
   ``The financial resources of K mart will support an aggressive
expansion program for the Sports Authority,'' said Jack Smith,
president of the sporting goods store chain.
   Two Detroit-area Sports Giant stores, which K mart opened last
year, will become part of the Sports Authority group this year.
Sports Authority now operates seven stores in Florida and one in
Woodbridge, Va., near Washington.
   K mart has more than 4,000 outlets nationwide and in Puerto Rico
and Canada operating as K mart stores, Pay Less Drug Stores,
Builders Square, Waldenbooks and PACE Membership Warehouse Clubs.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade with wheat
higher, corn fractionally lower and soybeans narrowly mixed.
   The wheat market appeared to be recovering from Thursday's steep
drop, partly in reaction to the Agriculture Department's approval
of a sale of 140,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat to China at
subsidized prices.
   Wheat for March delivery fell 4 cents a bushel Thursday amid
concerns about slack export demand and improved crop weather for
U.S. winter wheat.
   A slow export pace continued to weigh on corn and soybean
prices, with further selling linked to the beginning of the South
American harvest season. The corn harvest in Argentina is underway
and producing better yields than last year. Soybean harvesting in
Argentina and Brazil will begin later this month.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to 3 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.92\ a bushel; corn
futures were unchanged to } cent lower with March at $2.46\ a
bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with March at $1.44 a
bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to } cent higher with March at

   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were .07 cent lower to .18 cent higher with

<HEAD>BBC to Expand in Eastern Europe, US</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Broadcasting Corp. announced plans on
Friday to expand its programs in eastern Europe, especially
Romania, and in the United States.
   ``One of the main principles behind the success of our
international broadcasting is that we broadcast to our friends as
well as those who, until recently, were enemies,'' said John Tusa,
managing director of the BBC World Service.
   Tusa, who was born in Czechoslovakia, said eastern European
countries still need to hear controversy, comment and news from a
broad international viewpoint. He said non-Communist leaders in
eastern Europe, including Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki,
have asked the BBC to continue and are giving it facilities for
local rebroadcast of its programs.
   Mazowiecki is a former contributor to BBC programs.
   Broadcasts to Romania were increased by two hours during the
Christmas uprising that overthrew the government of President
Nicolae Ceausescu. Tusa said another hour and a quarter will be
added soon.
   ``We have reallocated funds to eastern Europe through the
internal budgeting process _ more money for Russian, Bulgarian,
Romanian,'' he said.
   He explained that special emphasis has been put on broadcasting
to Romania because of the intensity of the crisis there last
Christmas and difficulties now in finding stability and a way
toward transition to a new political system.
   To show the influence British broadcasts have had, Tusa held up
a photograph taken last June in Tiananmen Square before Chinese
tanks put down the pro-democracy movement. Students were carrying
the Chinese flag and a sign in both English and Chinese. In English
it said:
   ``Thank you BBC.''
   Tusa added that BBC officials are asking Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government for more money but declined to say how much.
He insisted that government funding does not lessen BBC
independence.
   ``The Foreign Office does not even attempt to tell us what to
say,'' Tusa told reporters. ``If they did, they know from long
experience what the answer would be.''
   In the United States, Americans later this month will be able to
dial up the latest BBC news program by telephone at any time ``for
less than a dollar a minute,'' he said. One cable television
service, C-Span, is devoting an audio channel to a 24-hour relay of
BBC news and Tusa expects it to grow from its present 1 million
subscribers. He said 150,000 have been added recently in a suburban
Washington area.
   He added that he also hopes for growth in an arrangement with
American Public Radio that permits any of its stations to relay all
BBC world service material from midnight to six in the morning.

<HEAD>FDIC Sues Ernst &amp; Young in Failed Thrift Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators have filed a suit against the
Ernst &amp; Young accounting firm, seeking $560 million regulators say
was lost because the auditors failed to detect illegitimate
activities of Dallas-based Western Savings Association.
   The suit, filed Thursday by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
means the nation's largest accounting firm becomes ineligible for
most work with the FDIC, an agency spokesman said.
   The FDIC can only use Ernst &amp; Young if there is a ``compelling
argument'' for doing so, said agency spokesman Alan Whitney.
   Ernst &amp; Young general counsel Carl Liggio was out of town this
morning and unavailable to comment, a woman answering the phone in
his office said.
   Western Savings' September 1986 failure is expected to cost the
government more than $1 billion. The government continues to own
and operate Western Savings, which was combined with seven other
failed Texas thrifts in 1988 to form Sunbelt Savings of Dallas.
   Between 1982 and 1986, Western Savings operated under the
control of developer Jarrett E. Woods Jr., who bought Gatesville
Savings and Loan Association, renamed it Western Savings and began
making high-risk loans for construction and development.
   Federal regulators became interested in the thrift when they
noted its high rate of growth, and in 1984, supervisors for the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board forced Western to agree to a series of
restrictions, including the hiring of a new outside auditor, Arthur
Young &amp; Co.
   Arthur Young merged with Ernst &amp; Whinney in 1989.
   Young performed outside audits for Western Savings in 1984 and
1985, but failed to ``plan and conduct its audits in accordance
with (generally accepted accounting standards) in numerous
respects,'' the FDIC alleges.
   The agency said Arthur Young failed to assess the risks of
irregularities, assigned personnel with inadequate training, and
relied unreasonably on the representations of Western Savings'
management.
   Specifically, the FDIC said Arthur Young should have reported
bogus profits from property sales, including property foreclosed by
the thrift, with many of the sales going to parties who received
their entire financing from Western Savings.
   It also alleged the accounting firm should have reported
inadequate provisions for losses from loans and investments.
   The suit names Arthur Young &amp; Co. and Ernst &amp; Young.

<TEXT>
   A federal court jury today awarded
Liggett Group Inc. of Durham $148.8 million in an anti-trust case
against Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. over generic cigarettes.
   The verdict came after more than seven months of testimony in
U.S. District Court.
   ``The jury fully evaluated the case on the merits and ruled in
favor of fair competition,'' said Liggett President K. v.R Dey.
``The message is clear: unfair competitive conduct in the
marketplace is contrary to American law.''
   The lawsuit was brought in 1984 by Liggett, which had introduced
generic cigarettes in 1980. Liggett charged that B&amp;W tried to bring
about the demise of Liggett's low-price cigarettes by illegally
copying Liggett's trademark and trying to prevent expansion of
generic sales.
   B&amp;W said the case was one that should be tried by the
marketplace and not the courts.

<TEXT>
   Greyhound's 6,300 drivers went on strike early today at the
country's only nationwide bus company, stopping their buses outside
terminals and stranding thousands of travelers.
   The walkout over wages began after contract talks in Scottsdale,
Ariz., between Greyhound Lines Inc. and the Amalgamated Council of
Greyhound Local Unions failed to reach an agreement by the 12:01
a.m. MST strike deadline.
   No new negotiations were scheduled.
   Stranded passengers complained that they were unaware that a
strike was looming and criticized Greyhound for selling them
tickets when it was likely they wouldn't be able to complete their
trips.
   ``They haven't even apologized,'' said Lisa Olkon, who was stuck
in Atlanta while trying to get home to St. Paul, Minn., from
Florida. ``I called about an hour before I went to get on the bus''
and was told nothing.
   About 200 passengers had been stranded at the Atlanta terminal
early today, but by late morning only three dozen or so remained.
The others apparently got out on the few buses that did depart or
on a southbound Amtrak train that left at midmorning, or found
lodging to wait out the strike.
   ``We went on strike because the company has refused to bargain
in good faith, and we have struck because the company insisted on
imposing'' its original offer, said union spokesman Jeffrey Nelson.
   Besides the 6,300 drivers, the strikers include 3,075 of the
company's office and maintenance workers whose three-year contract
expired at midnight.
   Dallas-based Greyhound carried 22 million passengers last year,
an average of about 60,000 a day. The union told its drivers to
continue only as far as their next destination as the strike
deadline passed. The company said it didn't know how many
passengers were stranded, but estimated the number in the thousands.
   Greyhound said it would operate a limited schedule today using
replacements trained during the past few weeks.
   ``We are starting with our main line schedule first, and
continue to add routes as drivers become available,'' spokeswoman
Liz Hale said from the company headquarters.
   She said at least 16 of the 60 bus schedules that the company
normally runs in Dallas were operating as of 6 a.m.
   Hale also said some drivers had crossed picket lines, but didn't
know how many. Later, she said she had received ``spotty reports''
of harassment on picket lines, but ``nothing involving
passengers.'' She said she could not confirm any of the incidents.
   Amtrak told ticket agents to honor Greyhound tickets when buses
are unavailable, said railroad spokeswoman Sue Martin in
Washington, D.C.
   Greyhound serves about 9,500 destinations, including about 9,000
where it is the only intercity transportation.
   It offers a $68 one-way ticket anywhere in the country and
generally caters to people seeking the cheapest form of mass
transit.
   Only nine of the normally scheduled 40 Greyhound buses left the
Port Authority terminal in New York City between 6 p.m. and
midnight, so that all passengers would reach their final
destinations, said Greyhound spokesman Bill Kula.
   In Dallas, more than 40 pickets encircled the downtown bus
terminal and blocked two incoming Greyhound buses, cheering when
the drivers abandoned their vehicles.
   A handful of pickets blocked a departing bus for about 20
minutes in Minneapolis.
   The bus, marked ``charter,'' pulled out of the terminal onto a
side street just before 8 a.m. when one picket, Mike Vervanac,
pulled open the door and told the driver, ``We can't guarantee your
safety down the road.''
   Another picket, Joyce Wegener, called the driver a scab. She
said later, ``The man's got my job.''
   A security guard said police would be called and told the driver
to continue. The bus halted again when pickets walked in front of
it and didn't step aside until they saw police arriving. No arrests
were made.
   Rob Wilkins, 22, of London, said the strike had disrupted his
plans to tour America by bus. He was trying to get from Minneapolis
to Memphis, Tenn.
   ``I'm not going to see Elvis,'' he lamented. ``I come to bloody
America and they're on strike.''
   Several buses also were delayed in Cleveland, where pickets
jeered and pounded their fists on departing and arriving vehicles.
Police blocked pickets from approaching two buses that left the
Philadelphia station without passengers. Company officials would
not say where the buses were going.
   In Pittsburgh, where violence broke out during a bus strike
seven years ago, six workers picketed peacefully while stranded
passengers snoozed.
   Sharon Kois, a senior at West Virginia University in Morgantown,
W.Va., was trying to get to Bozeman, Mont., for a job interview
Saturday.
   She said a ticket agent asked her, ``Don't you read the
papers?'' when she arrived to catch her bus. She then reserved
seats on an Amtrak train bound for Montana.
   The company said it was unsure if the picket lines would be
honored by other unions, including drivers at urban mass transit
systems the company operates in various cities.
   Greyhound drivers, who according to the company earned an
average of $24,743 last year, took a 22 percent pay cut three years
ago in negotiations prior to a leveraged buyout of the company.
   The company is offering a first-year raise of 6.9 percent, but
the union says this is misleading. The company says the union is
demanding a 33 percent increase in the first year; the union says
that is a distortion.
   Greyhound Chairman Fred G. Currey led an investment group that
paid Phoenix-based Greyhound Corp. $270 million to buy out the
company in 1987. The group later bought Trailways Lines Inc. of
Dallas for $80 million and merged the two companies.

<HEAD>Ailing Waterford Crystal Maker Finds Minority Partner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Waterford Wedgwood Group PLC said Friday that a
New York investment bank and an Irish company would acquire a
minority stake under a plan to raise more than $150 million for the
ailing Anglo-Irish crystal and china maker.
   The 50-50 partnership formed by the Irish industrial company
Fitzwilton and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. would take a maximum 29.9
percent stake in Waterford, which in turn would raise 102 million
Irish pounds, or $158 million, in cash.
   Waterford also announced it an after-tax loss of 29 million
pounds, or $45 million, in 1989, compared with a loss of 5.2
million pounds, or $8.1 million, a year earlier.
   The deal ends widespread speculation in recent months that
Waterford was searching for a partner to help it reduce about $186
million in debt. The company said a major portion of he cash raised
would go toward reducing that debt.
   Waterford said Investco, a new company set up by Fitzwilton
Holdings PLC, which is headed by H.J. Heinz Co. Chairman Tony
O'Reilly, and a Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. affiliate called Morgan
Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II LP, would buy 212 million new
Waterford shares for 37.5 pence, or 58 cents, each.
   The sale is expected to raise about $123 million. Waterford also
said it would sell 82.8 million shares, representing about 7
percent of its enlarged stock capital, to existing shareholders,
excluding Investco.
   Waterford said it would offer one share for every five held, at
a price of 27.5 pence, 43 cents, each. That sale would raise an
additional $35 million.
   ``This is an excellent opportunity to take a significant,
long-term position in one of the world's pre-eminent luxury goods
companies,'' Donald Brennan, chairman of Morgan Stanley Leveraged
Equity Fund II LP, said in a statement.
   ``We believe current management have correctly identified the
causes behind the production problems in the company's crystal
business and this investment provides the prudent capital structure
that will give management time to solve them,'' he said.
   Waterford has been hurt badly in recent years by a slump in
sales in Britain and the United States and by the climb of the
Irish pound against the dollar.
   The company was rocked when a 1988 audit revealed that
accounting errors were made that overvalued its crystal inventories
by up to $33 million. Former Waterford Chairman Paddy Hayes
resigned in the aftermath of these revelations.
   Waterford's shares rose 2 pence, or 3 cents, to close at 50
pence, or 78 cents, on Dublin's Stock Exchange Friday.
   Under the deal, Fitzwilton and Morgan Stanley each named two
members to Waterford's board of directors, raising the number to
14. O'Reilly is one of Fitzwilton's two.
   Detailing its results, Waterford said that it lost $32 million
before taxes in 1989, compared with a a $4.2 million pre-tax profit
a year earlier. Sales rose 16 percent to $541 million from $467
million in 1988.

   The stock market headed higher across a broad
front today as the blue chips extended their four-day advance.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which has gone up 71.40
points already this week, added an additional 15.76, rising to
2,651.35 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues outdistanced declines on the New York Stock
Exchange by a margin of almost 2 to 1, with 894 up, 472 down and
526 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 115.85 million
shares with two hours left to go in the session.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks moved
1.08 higher to 184.60.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index gained
1.96 to 356.00.
   Market analysts said today's advance was made possible in part
by momentum built up during four straight winning sessions.
   A new government reading on the economy released before the
start of trading reinforced the feelianti-competitive.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 16.4
points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,254.8. It finished just below its
session peak of 2,255.9 and well above its minimum of 2,240.6.
   Volume was 542 million shares, compared with 379.5 million
shares Thursday. A large chunk of Friday's volume came from the
Scottish and Newcastle sale.
   A strong early showing on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones
industrial average rose 19 points to 2,653.15 by the end of the
European day, also added to the more optimistic tone.

   State officials today accused Charles H.
Keating Jr., the central figure in the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan
scandal, of casting a web of fraud to snare investors who paid $200
million for now-worthless ``junk bonds.''
   The civil investment-fraud lawsuit, which also names two Keating
associates, is the toughest action yet against Keating, whose
high-flying lifestyle and soured investments came to symbolize the
excesses of the S&amp;L industry in the 1980s.
   Keating and Lincoln's parent company, American Continental Corp.
already have been sued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in a
$1.1 billion civil fraud lawsuit. The FDIC says it is the largest
depository institution suit in history.
   The suit announced today seeks repayment for the investors in
the high-yield, high-risk bonds, many of them elderly people who
lost their life savings. It holds Keating and the others personally
responsible and could lead to millions of dollars in civil and
criminal judgments and years of prison time, the officials said in
statements released this morning.
   They said files supporting the lawsuit had been turned over to
the district attorneys of Los Angeles and Orange counties for
possible criminal prosecution.
   ``I say the suit has been filed by the very people who allowed
it to happen and it's politically motivated to divert attention,''
said Keating's Los Angeles attorney, James Ham.
   ``It's also a huge waste of taxpayer dollars because Mr. Keating
is already being investigated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the U.S. attorney's office, in grand jury proceedings,
the Federal Election Commission, and by both houses of Congress,''
he said.
   He said he had not seen the lawsuit, but ``I'm sure it's just a
rehash of what everybody else is in line for.''
   ACC's spokesman, Brad Boland, did not immediately return a
telephone message seeking comment.
   ``This is a shocking story of predatory sales practices
engineered from the top and carried out in Lincoln Savings branches
where every promotion and every bonus earned by employees created
an atmosphere of `sell, sell, sell,''' said Christine Bender,
commissioner of the state Corporations Department.
   Keating headed the Phoenix-based American Continental Corp. The
lawsuit was filed late Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court.
   Lincoln's collapse is expected to be the most costly S&amp;L failure
ever, with taxpayers footing a $2 billion bailout bill. Keating
already was targeted in a class-action lawsuit on behalf of 22,000
Lincoln investors. That action, like the state's lawsuit, contends
they were led to believe their investments in ACC bonds were
federally insured, like regular deposits at S&amp;Ls.
   Ms. Bender said interviews with more than 100 American
Continental bondholders and Lincoln employees and analysis of
thousands of documents showed:
   _That prospectuses describing the bonds were routinely withheld
from customers;
   _That investors, many of them elderly, disabled and on fixed
incomes, were never told the bonds were uninsured;
   _That many investors were told the junk bonds were insured and
risk free.
   Ms. Bender said it may be hard to collect restitution because
American Continental is mired in bankruptcy proceedings in Phoenix,
but she said her department would ``pursue every avenue in seeking
restitution.''
   Also named as defendants are Judy J. Wischer and Andrew Ligget,
both of Phoenix, who held a variety of titles at American
Continental. The lawsuit also listed 200 ``John Doe'' defendants,
to be named later if additional evidence surfaces.
   The defendants are accused of fraud and misrepresentation in
connection with the offer and sale of securities; making false
filings with the Corporations Department; using unapproved
advertising in connection with the securities; and selling the
bonds in clear violation of the qualification requirements of state
law.

<HEAD>Frantic Pace Marks Asia's Fastest Growing Stock Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mothers and hooky-playing college
students are rushing to brokers around Bangkok, hoping one of the
world's fastest growing stock markets will extend its winning
streak in 1990.
   ``Most of the people who come to our trading floor are women.
Many are housewives who come in the morning after dropping their
kids off at school,'' said Mark Greenwood, broker at First Pacific
Asia Securities.
   ``On a day when there's a lot of movement, I can hear great
bursts of cheer coming out of the trading room,'' he said. At
cocktail parties, lunches and during rounds of golf, conversations
these days invariably come around to stock prospects, profits and
losses.
   While Greenwood says many use the market here like a casino, he
and other analysts predict that more serious long-term investors
will make big gains on the Securities Exchange of Thailand over the
next few years.
   With economic growth rate expected to reach 8 percent to 10
percent in 1990, analysts predict Thailand's stock market will grow
by more than 25 percent. Its 137 listings are expected to increase
by 40 to 50 during the year.
   Fueled by the economic boom and large amounts of money from
abroad, the stock exchange registered the best performance in Asia
last year. At the beginning of 1989, the market's total shares were
valued at $9 billion, vs. $25.6 billion at yearend.
   George Robinson, broker at W.I. Carr Far East Ltd., said a main
reason was the $1.2 billion worth of foreign investment pumped in
the market last year.
   At the same time, speculation is widely seen as a major force in
the Thai market. Many investors have been lured by the prospect of
profits from buying then quickly selling.
   Sunisa Kriyharasan, chief researcher at CMIC Finance and
Securities Co., said Thai investors did not fully understand the
``young market,'' and often bought stocks on short term speculation
rather than looking for fundamentals behind a company.
   ``Speculation is a good thing for a young market such as
Thailand's because it spurs activity and gets people into the
market,'' Greenwood said.
   But some believe speculation has gotten out of hand. Finance
Minister Pramual Sabhavasu recently said the stock exchange was
becoming a ``gambling den,'' and a series of measures have been
taken since Dec. 1 intended to curb excessive speculation.
   In many alleged cases, heavy speculation has been riding on the
coattails of manipulation by large brokerages.
   One of these, Chao Thai Securities, was suspended from trading
Jan. 12 for charges of manipulation, along with another company
that was cleared the subsequent day. Chao Thai is still under
investigation.
   ``Manipulation occurs right throughout the Asian continent. It
is something that people have to live with,'' said Greenwood.
   Others said the government scrutiny had made a difference.
   ``It's getting better,'' said one broker who declined to be
identified by name. ``The ministry of finance is now tightening
control. Eventually we'll see an independent authority to check
this.''
   Although the stock exchange is 14 years old, it remained obscure
only until a few years ago. From 1979 to 1986, the market struggled
because of the collapse of one large securities firm, Raja Finance.
   Interest in the stock market picked up in 1986 with a large
influx of foreign investment, drawn by Thailand's speedy industrial
modernization.
   Since then the stock exchange has blossomed, apart from two
major slumps caused by the ``Black Monday'' stock market crash in
the United States in 1987 and the resignatiom of Thai Prime
Minister Prem Tinsulanonda in 1988. Both were followed by rapid
recoveries.
   The market has been experiencing a downturn since Jan. 10 after
a dramatic 20 percent increase since Oct. 13 from an index of 650
to 925.
   Analysts have seen the slump as a long overdue correction as
well as a result of drops in stock markets worldwide.
   ``I can see short term dislocation in the market. However, I
think there is nothing that can stop the market when the economy is
growing at 8 to 10 percent,'' said Greenwood.

<HEAD>French Aviation Authority Clears Airbus A320</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France's civil aviation authority has ruled the
Airbus A320 jetliner fundamentally safe despite an accident last
month in Bangalore, India, in which 90 people were killed, a
spokeswoman for the authority said Friday.
   The Direction Generale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC) sent its
judgment in a message this week to other countries operating the
short-to-medium range plane, the spokeswoman said.
   Henri Martin, president of Aerospatiale SA, one of four European
aircraft manufacturers comprising the consortium Airbus Industrie,
said: ``The fact that the certification of the Airbus A320 wasn't
withdrawn after the Bangalore accident makes us think that the
plane isn't at fault.''
   Aviation industry sources said the note stated information given
French investigators concerning the accident proved the
airworthiness of the aircraft as certified by DGAC.
   The country that certifies a plane airworthy can order aircraft
belonging to the same series grounded if mechanical failure is
suspected as the cause of an accident.
   Some French and Indian pilots have criticized the A320's
sophisiticated computer-guidance system as removing too many
decisions from the pilot's control.
   The investigation into the causes of the accident is still under
way. India has grounded Air India's 14 other A320 aircraft until
its inquiry is completed, but other carriers have continued to fly
the 53 remaining A320s in operation.
   Airbus Industrie is a consortium of Aerospatiale of France,
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH of West Germany, British Aerospace
Plc and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.

<TEXT>
   The dollar rose aggressively against other major
currencies in Europe Friday, shrugging off a reported intervention
by the West German Bundesbank, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the
French and Spanish central banks.
   Gold prices fell more than $5 an ounce.
   The dollar did retreat from its session highs against the West
German mark on a series of Bundesbank interventions late in the
afternoon, dealers said. But the U.S. currency recovered after the
market interpreted the intervention as warning rather than a
serious effort to bring the U.S. currency lower, dealers said.
   The dollar still was underpinned by jitters over German
unification, they said.
   A dealer with a U.S. money center bank said the Bundesbank's
action was ``clearly a signal to the market that the dollar had
moved too far too fast.''
   The Fed didn't surface until much later in European dealings
when it sold dollars between 149.90 Japanese yen and 150.10 yen,
dealers said. But the action had little effect on the U.S.
currency, they said.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6515 from $1.6655 late
Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.7200 West German marks, up from 1.7145; 1.5130
Swiss francs, up from 1.5060; 5.8065 French francs, up from 5.7935;
1.9365 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9307; 1,268.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,266.00; and 1.1939 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1899.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.03 yen to a closing 149.75 yen. But later, in
London, it was quoted at 150.28 yen.
   Bullion dealers attributed the decline in gold prices to a wave
of technical selling in light trading, which brought the prices
below a key support level.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $403.25 a troy ounce
from $407.75 bid late Thursday.
   In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $402.50 from $407.75
bid late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.02 to close at a bid $406.61.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $5.12 a
troy ounce from Thursday's $5.16.

   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index gained

by momentum built up during four straight winning sessions.
   A new government reading on the economy released before the
start of trading reinforced the feeling that the economy isn't
about to slump into a recession, analysts said.

Indicators showed no change in January. The flat reading followed a

market. In afternoon dealings, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond
was up nearly a full point, or almost $10 per $1,000 in face value,
while its yield tumbled to 8.51 percent from 8.60 percent late

<HEAD>Ryder Executives Predict No or Slow Growth in 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ryder System Inc. executives Friday predicted flat
or only slight growth in 1990 as the transportation services
company seeks to rebound from a 77 percent earnings decline last
year.
   Ryder officials told a meeting of industry analysts they hope
streamlined operations and growing European operations will improve
business, but said a quick turnaround is not expected, in part
because of the nation's slowing economy.
   ``We continue to see a difficult environment for significant
improvements in earnings,'' said M. Anthony Burns, Ryder's chairman
and chief executive.
   Burns said Miami-based Ryder should post a first-quarter loss
and will be lucky to show an improvement over last year's operating
income, which was affected by a $90 million charge for a
restructuring, an increase of workers compensation reserves and
vehicle sales.
   Last year, Ryder's net earnings were $46 million, or 50 cents a
share, compared with $197 million, or $2.40 a share, in 1988.
Revenue rose slightly to $5.1 billion from $5 billion in 1988.
   Ryder blamed the earnings decline on reduced demand for
commercial truck rental, no aircraft sales by its aviation
division, increased fuel costs and a slowdown in new car sales that
hurt its vehicle transportation unit.
   Ryder, which has sold off three slow-growing divisions since
last year and reduced its work force by nearly 3,000 to 42,000,
shares about 80 percent of the truck-rental market with
Phoenix-based U-Haul International Inc.
   Ryder's Vehicle Leasings &amp; Services division, which posted a
pre-tax loss of more than $110 million last year, has sold off
about 10,000 trucks, many in poor condition.
   Leasing division chief David Parker said Ryder's school bus
leasing operations and expansion into Europe are potential growth
areas. Ryder operates several truck facilities in the United
Kingdom and one in West Germany.
   No aircraft sales and a decline in the market for used aircraft
parts last year hurt Ryder's Aviations Services division, which
leases and sells used aircraft, repairs engines and distributes
parts.
   A Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by Orlando-based Braniff Inc. in
September also cost Ryder business. But Ryder officials are
competing for former customers of United Airlines, which has left
the jet engine repair business.
   European expansion is also a target of Ryder's Automotive
Carrier Division, which transports new cars, division head Terence
Russell said.
   Russell attributed much of the division's $22.6 million pre-tax
losses last year to a slump in new cars sales, which he said should
rebound.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Wheat finished slightly
lower, soybeans were modestly higher and corn futures were mixed.
   The close reflected a squaring up of positions before the
weekend after a choppy session in which both corn and soybeans
traded on either side of unchanged.
   Wheat drew strength early in the session from news that the
Agriculture Department had approved a sale of 140,000 metric tons
of U.S. wheat to China at subsidized prices.
   Soybeans rallied back from modest losses posted at midday when
soybean meal futures fell to 2{-year lows, reflecting continuing
slack export demand and ample near-term supplies.
   Soybean meal for delivery in March finished $2.10 lower at
$159.30 a ton, the lowest close for a near-month meal contract
since September 1987.

<HEAD>To Motivate, It's Money That Matters, Some Quality Experts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. workers lack enthusiasm and don't enjoy
their jobs, and the best way to motivate employees may be to offer
them more money, according to most of the quality control engineers
responding to a recent survey.
   The Institute of Industrial Engineers, after examining responses
to a survey of its members' opinions on workplace productivity and
quality issues, said corporations must invest more in motivating
employees and making the workers feel they can share in the
company's success.
   The alternative could be declining productivity and quality,
said Gregory Balestrero, executive director of the IIE, based in
Norcross, Ga.
   ``It's affecting corporations very rapidly,'' Balestrero said
Friday from Miami, where he was attending a conference.
   Balestrero said 27 percent of the IIE's 40,000 members responded
to the annual survey, with 75.2 percent of the respondents saying
they did not think employees were enthusiastic about their jobs or
enjoyed coming to work.
   In a 1987 survey, 54.9 percent of those responding said
employees were enthusiastic and enjoyed coming to work.
   Balestrero said some major corporations, notably Minnesota
Mining and Manufacturing Co. and Ford Motor Co., have instituted
successful programs to provide employees with incentives for the
improved performance of the company as a whole.
   Such ``gain sharing'' programs, he said, set corporate rather
than individual goals, which when exceeded provide benefits to
everyone. But relatively few corporations are making such an
effort, he said.
   Asked the primary motivation for employees to increase
productivity, the greatest percentage of respondents _ 29 percent _
listed financial reward, followed by personal recognition,
increased responsibilities and pride in the job.
   Balestrero said in 1980, recognition topped the list, but money
began returning to prominence around 1985.
   IIE members include engineers and managers involved in quality
control, personnel and productivity. About 68 percent of the

   The stock market headed higher across a broad
front today and the blue chips extended their advance to a fifth
straight session.
   Market analysts said the strong performance was made possible in
part by momentum building up all week.
   Confidence in U.S. financial markets got a boost when stocks
managed to shrug off the rout that rocked Tokyo on Monday, causing
the Japanese market's second-biggest point loss ever.
   ``I think our market clearly has de-coupled from the Japanese
market,'' said Gordon L. Smith, a managing director at Alex. Brown
&amp; Sons Inc. in Baltimore. ``This week demonstrated that is the
case.''
   A new government reading on the economy released before the
start of trading today reinforced the feeling that the U.S. economy
isn't about to slump into a recession, analysts said.
   Reporting on the main government gauge of the economy's future,
the Commerce Department said the Index of Leading Economic
Indicators showed no change in January. The flat reading followed a
revised 0.6 percent gain in December and a 0.1 percent advance in
November.
   ``The numbers all week for the most part indicate the economy's
kind of OK. That has been of some encouragement to people,'' Smith
said.
   A rally in bonds, meanwhile, injected some zip into the stock
market. In late afternoon dealings, the benchmark 30-year Treasury
bond rose more than a half point, or around $5 per $1,000 in face
value, while its yield tumbled to 8.55 percent from 8.60 percent
late Thursday.

   A federal jury on Friday ordered Brown &amp;
Williamson Tobacco Corp. to pay $148.8 million to Liggett Group
Inc. for attempting to put Liggett's generic cigarettes out of
business through illegal pricing.
   The award followed a seven-month antitrust trial in U.S.
District Court on allegations that B&amp;W illegally tried to stifle
expansion of generic cigarette sales by its competitor in the early
1980s.
   B&amp;W was convicted of selling generic cigarettes at below their
cost of manufacture, giving illegal discounts to undercut Liggett
sales and organizing a plan to displace Liggett in the generic
market.
   Brown &amp; Williamson, based in Louisville, Ky., was acquitted of
trademark violation. Attorneys for Durham-based Liggett said they
would seek a new trial on that issue.
   ``The message is clear: Unfair competitive conduct in the
marketplace is contrary to American law,'' Liggett President K.v.R.
Dey said.
   Liggett introduced generic cigarettes in 1980 and sued B&amp;W in
1984, charging it tried to bring about the demise of Liggett's
low-price brand by illegally copying Liggett's trademark and trying
to prevent expansion of generic sales. The trial began last July.
   B&amp;W maintained the case should be tried in the marketplace and
not the courts.
   Liggett sought $89.6 million in compensatory damages, the amount
the company said it lost as a result of predatory practices by B&amp;W
in violation of federal trade and antitrust laws.
   Liggett contended that it pioneered the plain-label, generic
cigarette market in 1980 in a successful effort to carve its own
niche at a time when sales of its regular brands were flagging.
   Brown &amp; Williamson, a larger tobacco company, said it engaged in
customary tactics in the highly competitive cigarette trade in
seeking a share of the generic market.
   Josiah Murray, general counsel for the Liggett Group Inc., said
B&amp;W sought to bring down Liggett ``because Liggett's low-price
cigarettes were interfering with Brown &amp; Williamson's high profits
on their branded cigarettes.'
   B&amp;W said in statement it believed the verdict would be
overturned because of ``overwhelming evidence that competition was
not in any way injured by Brown &amp; Williamson's sale of low-priced
cigarettes.''
   Liggett was owned by Grand Metropolitan PLC when the lawsuit was
filed. It was sold to a group of private investors in 1986 and went
public a year later.
   When GrandMet sold Liggett, an arrangement was made for Liggett
and GrandMet to share equally in any proceeds of the Brown &amp;
Williamson litigation after reimbursement of expenses.
   Under an agreement, GrandMet's share in any recovery will not
exceed $16.5 million, plus reimbursement of all expenses relating
to the lawsuit paid or reimbursed by GrandMet, or by Liggett while
it was owned by GrandMet.
   The balance of a recovery will be Liggett's. Since last June,
GrandMet has reimbursed Liggett for 50 percent of Liggett's
expenses in connection with the case.

   Gannett Co. Inc. said Friday it had agreed
to buy the Great Falls Tribune in Great Falls, Mont., from Cowles
Media Co. for $41 million.
   The Tribune, Montana's second-largest newspaper, has a
circulation of 34,000 Monday-Saturday, and 41,000 on Sunday.
   The purchase is Gannett's first in Montana, and raises its
number of daily newspapers to 83, including USA Today.
   ``We are pleased to be coming into Great Falls and the state of
Montana,'' said John J. Curley, chairman, president and chief
executive of Gannett.
   David C. Cox, president and chief executive officer of Cowles
Media, which is based in Minneapolis, said, ``We value very highly
our 25-year association with the Great Falls Tribune and are proud
of the leadership role it has played in Montana.''
   The newspaper traces its roots to the Sun River Sun, first
published in 1884. It began publishing as the Great Falls Tribune
in 1885.
   Montana is the 41st state in which Gannett will have operations.
   Other Gannett activities include 10 television stations, 16
radio stations, Gannett News Services and the largest outdoor
advertising company in North America.

   Concerted central bank intervention helped
moderate the dollar's rise on Friday, following the currency's
recent foreign exchange surge that analysts credit to economic and
political turmoil in other nations.
   Some of the sharpest gains have come against the currencies of
West Germany and Japan, both of which are undergoing times of
economic uncertainty.
   The dollar closed at 1.7200 West German marks Friday in Europe,
up sharply from the 1.6545 marks of Feb. 7.
   Against the Japanese currency, the dollar closed at 150.28
Japanese yen Friday in London, inciting a round of dollar selling
by the central banks of several countries, including the Federal
Reserve. On Feb. 19, the dollar was quoted at 144.52 yen.
   ``It's not so much that the dollar is going up, but other
currencies are going down,'' said Kevin Logan, chief economist with
Swiss Bank Corp. in New York.
   David Wyss, chief financial economist with DRI-McGraw Hill in
Lexington, Mass., said the yen failed to rally as expected after
Japan's parliamentary elections last month. The mark, which soared
after the border between East Germany and West Germany was opened
in November, also has run into trouble.
   The Deutschemark has dominated foreign exchange trading since
the barriers between the two Germanys began falling on Nov. 9. The
dollar closed at 1.8475 marks that day, but the West German
currency shot higher on speculation that the country's economy
would boom as a result of the political changes in Eastern Europe.
   But some of the euphoria has begun to wear off and is being
replaced by the jitters. The outcome of this month's East German
elections is unclear and there is concern that the planned
unification of the East German and West German currencies may lead
to an oversupply of marks _ increasing the danger of runaway
inflation.
   ``All the uncertainty ... has increased the risk of holding
Deutschemark assets,'' Logan said.
   Investors have begun selling some of their marks to preserve
their profits and the dollar has advanced as a result.
   The dollar's close of 1.7200 marks in Europe compared with
Thursday's level of 1.7145. In New York, the dollar fell to 1.7150
West German marks from 1.7194 Thursday.
   In Japan, disappointment over the yen's failure to rally has
been compounded by increasing fears that interest rates will rise
further as the government attempts to contain inflation. As more
and more traders believe a rate hike is likely, they are selling
yen in favor of the dollar.
   The yen's decline has been swift and startling. During a six-day
winning streak in late February, the dollar soared 4.51 yen and
reached its highest level since last June.
   Analysts say the dollar could go higher, but the central banks
of the big industrial countries will try to stop it, especially
against the yen. Friday's intervention _ which succeeded in taming
the dollar somewhat on U.S. markets _ was a statement by the banks
that they want to see currency rates stable, Wyss said.
   The dollar fell 0.03 yen to close at 149.75 yen Friday in Tokyo.
But later, in London, it was quoted at 150.28 yen, and it closed in
New York at 150.15 yen, up sharply from Thursday's 149.85.
   With traders growing uneasy about the German political and
economic situation, currencies like the British pound and the Swiss
franc _ whose countries have high interest rates _ were seen as
relatively safe havens and also have advanced against the mark,
Logan said.
   But in recent sessions the European currencies have fallen with
the mark, allowing the dollar to gain sharply, he said.
   On Feb. 23, the pound traded at $1.7145, its highest level since
April 1989. But sterling has dropped since then. In London Friday,
it closed at $1.6515, compared with $1.6655 late Thursday, and in
New York it fell to $1.6485 from $1.6640.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates included: 1.5085 Swiss francs, down from 1.5095,
5.7910 French francs, down from 5.8070; 1,264.50 Italian lire, down
from 1,267.25; and 1.19225 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19095.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.5130 Swiss francs, up from 1.5060; 5.8065
French francs, up from 5.7935; 1.9365 Dutch guilders, up from
1.9307; 1,268.00 Italian lire, up from 1,266.00; and 1.1939
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1899.
   Gold prices fell sharply Friday. Dealers attributed the decline
to technical selling in light trading.
   In New York, gold fell $3.20 to $403 a troy ounce on the
Commodity Exchange, and Republic National Bank later quoted a bid
of $403.25 a troy ounce, down $3.45 from Thursday.
   Gold fell earlier in London to a late bid of $403.25 a troy
ounce from $407.75 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing
bid of $402.50 from $407.75 bid late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.02 to close at a bid $406.61.
   Silver fell 2.8 cents to $5.126 a troy ounce on the Commodity
Exchange in New York. In London earlier, silver fell to a late bid
of $5.12 a troy ounce from Thursday's $5.16.

<HEAD>Cigna Bowing Out of Personal Auto Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON BEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cigna Corp. said Friday it was dropping
personal auto insurance coverage because the division generates
little business and is only marginally profitable.
   Cigna's specialty is commercial insurance coverage and is rated
one of the nation's largest in that area. Cigna has only 0.8
percent of the national business in personal auto insurance.
   The insurance giant had annual premiums of $11.5 billion last
year, of which personal auto insurance accounted for only $215
million.
   ``The personal auto insurance is only marginally profitable at
best and therefore we have decided to stop,'' Cigna spokesman Jim
Beattie said.
   Beattie said the problem stems from higher repair bills, medical
bills and legal expenses. Cigna does not generate enough business
to offset those costs and could not in the near future, he said.
   Cigna has decided to concentrate on its commercial coverage
lines as well as continue restructuring its agency division. The
company sells to individuals and small businesses through
independent agents. Cigna said it would be severing exclusive
contracts with 220 independents by the end of next year.
   Two weeks ago, the head of the division handling the
independents, David J. Prentiss, resigned.
   Beattie said the company will generally quit writing new auto
policies and agents will be asked to renew existing policies with
other carriers as the policies come due.
   Because of the change, Beattie said so-called ``umbrella''
policies Cigna has offered for complete insurance coverage through
one company would not be renewed.
   But he said the company will continue to write homeowner
insurance, even though it is also a very small part of Cigna's
business. Commercial vehicle coverage also will continue to be
available.
   Beattie said some personal auto insurance policies will be
honored and sold by agents who hold exclusive contracts with Cigna.
``We will meet or exceed all state regulations and honor all
contractual agreements,'' he said.
   Cigna said no layoffs are expected because of the personal auto
coverage decision.

   Renewed confidence in the economic outlook and
in U.S. financial markets propelled stock prices higher Friday for
a fifth straight session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rallied 24.77 points to
finish at 2,660.36, its best closing level since mid-January. The
blue-chip indicator climbed 96.17 points in its five-day winning
streak after posting losses each day last week.
   Advancing issues outpaced declining ones by about 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
982 up, 484 down and 503 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 164.33 million
shares, up from 157.93 million Thursday.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 199.83 million shares.
   Market analysts said the strong performance was made possible in

<HEAD>Ivory Coast Unrest Fuels Surge In Coffee, Cocoa Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee and cocoa futures prices rose sharply Friday on New
York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange, fueled by fears that unrest
in the Ivory Coast could disrupt shipments of Ivorian cocoa and
coffee, the country's two main exports.
   On other commodity markets, copper futures also rose sharply;
precious metals retreated energy futures advanced; livestock and
meat futures were mixed; and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Coffee futures settled 2.25 cents to 5 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at 99 cents a pound; cocoa futures
ended $35 to $50 higher with March at $1,123 a ton.
   Both markets have been in upward trends since at least the
beginning of the year after falling sharply last year to their
lowest levels in more than a decade.
   The depression of coffee and cocoa prices has been disastrous
for the economy of the once-prosperous Ivory Coast, the world's
largest cocoa producer and fifth-largest coffee grower.
   Civil discontent in the African nation erupted Friday as police
faced protesting high school and college students demanding the
resignation of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who has led the
Ivory Coast since it gained independence from France 30 years ago.
   Market analysts said the leap in coffee and cocoa futures
reflected fears that the tesnions could escalate into a general
strike, although there were no reports of shipping interruptions on
Friday.
   Analyst Arthur Stevenson of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
said the markets may have overreacted to the reports of unrest
simply because the Ivory Coast has been quiet for so long.
   ``The Ivory Coast has been an island of stability in a part of
the world where stability is a rare commodity,'' he said.
   Bert Ruiz, a vice president of the commodities brokerage Balfour
Maclaine Corp., also said traders had overreacted.
   ``Right now, there's only the potential for supply problems and
I think that spooked the markets,'' he said.
   Copper futures soared on New York's Commodity Exchange amid
growing concerns about tightening supplies and a possible squeeze
in the March contract, which is approaching expiration.
   After the close, the Commodity Exchange reported a 175-ton
increase Friday in copper stocks in exchange-registered warehouses
but traders expect the London Metal Exchange to report a sharp drop
in copper stocks in its weekly report on Monday.
   Copper futures settled 2.4 cents to 4.6 cents higher with March
at $1.198 a pound.
   Gold and silver futures prices sagged on the Comex amid selling
linked to gains in the stock market and the dollar's strength.
   Gold finished $3.20 to $4 lower with April at $405.60 a troy
ounce; silver futures were 2.8 cents to 3.3 cents lower with March
at $5.126 a troy ounce.
   Most petroleum futures rallied on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in a partial rebound from sharp losses earlier in the week.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures ended 8 cents lower to
18 cents higher with April at $21.35 a barrel; heating oil was .34
cent to 1.24 cents higher with April at 55.87 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .40 cent to .96 cent higher with April at
56.47 cents a gallon.
   Livestock futures were narrowly mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange while pork-belly futures fell sharply in selling inspired
by weak price indications and heavy hog slaughter levels during the
week.
   Live cattle futures settled .07 cent lower to .33 cent higher
with April at 76.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to
.15 cent lower with March at 80.47 cents a pound; live hogs were
.18 cent lower to .35 cent higher with April at 50.27 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.37 cent to 1.90 cents lower with
March at 48.75 cents a pound.
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures settled { cent to 2
cents lower with March at $3.88} a bushel; corn futures were { cent
lower to } cent higher with March at $2.45} a bushel; oats were {
cent lower to } cent higher with March at $1.44\ a bushel; soybeans

January to the lowest level in nearly a year.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond rose 11-16 point, or
about $7 for every $1,000 in face value after losing nearly 1}
points over the past two session.
   Its yield, which falls when prices rise, dropped to 8.54 percent
from 8.60 percent late Thursday.
   Bond prices moved higher after the Commerce Department reported
that new home sales dropped 7.1 percent in January, suggesting the
economy remains weak.
   ``The market used that basically as an excuse to start buying
(bonds),'' said Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist at Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   A weak economy increases prospects that the Federal Reserve
would ease interest rates to keep growth from stalling. Lower
interest rates boost the value of bonds.
   But there still is considerable confusion on the state of
economic health. The market's retreat earlier in the week was
attributed to speculation that the economy may not be as sluggish
as many analysts have suggested.
   Indeed, prices finished below their highs of the day on Friday
as some traders took profits on the price runup before the weekend.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues rose 3-32 point, intermediate maturities advanced
between 7-32 point and &rsqb; point and long-term issues jumped as much
as 11-16 point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a
financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 2.67 to 1,154.08.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 1-16 point to 91~. The average yield to
maturity slipped to 7.43 percent from 7.44 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills declined to 8.00 percent as
the discount slipped 5 basis points to 7.75 percent. Yields on
six-month bills were unchanged at 8.17 percent as the discount
remained at 7.75 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.23
percent as the discount rose 3 basis points to 7.67 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 5-16 percent, unchanged
from late Thursday.

<HEAD>S&amp;L Seizure Leaves Only Four Independent Thrifts in Arizona</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Regulators on Friday seized a large Arizona
savings institution, leaving only four thrifts operating
independently in the economically troubled state.
   Pima Savings and Loan Association, Tuscon, was taken over by the
Resolution Trust Corp., an agency created last August to sell or
close insolvent thrift institutions.
   Its seizure brings the number of government-controlled thrifts
in Arizona to seven. Three small S&amp;Ls and only one major
institution, First American Savings Inc. of Tuscon, still operate
under private control.
   According to the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift
Supervision, Pima had assets of $2.7 billion at the end of 1989. It
lost $106.5 million last year and was $16.1 million in the red at
the end of December.
   The office rejected as unrealistic Pima's plan to raise capital
to meet the more stringent requirements of last year's S&amp;L law.
   In Arizona's depressed real estate market, Pima had little
chance of replenishing its capital without government assistance,
said thrift office spokesman William Fulwider.
   Pima embarked on a rapid-growth strategy in the mid-1980s
emphasizing risky loans, Fulwider said. For a time, it reported
above-average profits, but extraordinary sour loan problems
destroyed its earnings, he said.
   The S&amp;L will maintain normal business hours and all 170,000
deposit accounts are protected up to the $100,000 insurance limit,
the RTC said.
   According to Sheshunoff Information Services, Pima was the
fourth largest S&amp;L in Arizona and the 76th largest in the nation at
the end of September.
   Before Friday, the Resolution Trust Corp. was managing 333
institutions with $175 billion in assets.
   In addition to Pima, the RTC on Friday also seized North
Carolina Federal Savings and Loan Association, Charlotte, N.C.;
Haven Federal Savings and Loan Association, Winter Haven, Fla.; New
Athens Savings and Loan Association, New Athens, Ill.

   Oil futures prices recovered Friday on the New
York Mercantile Exchange after three straight days of declines.
   Analysts said prices were due for a rebound after bearish
sentiment in recent days. Gasoline futures had borne the brunt of
the decline, amid speculation centering on ample supplies of fuel
and relatively weak consumption.
   On Friday, unleaded regular gasoline for April delivery jumped
0.66 cent to finish at 56.47 cents a gallon. Contracts for delivery
further in the future also advanced.
   ``Some people were just buying it back,'' said Peter Beutel,
assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc.
``There were a lot of oversold pressures that had to be relieved.''
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
home heating oil for April delivery soared 1.24 cents to 55.87
cents a gallon. Later contracts also were up, but less strongly.
   The April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the key grade of
U.S. crude oil, rose 18 cents to close at $21.35 per 42-gallon
barrel. Later contracts for delivery further in the future made
smaller gains.

<HEAD>Exxon Suspends Marine Operations in New Jersey After Two Spills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MORAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. on Friday suspended all tanker
and barge operations in New Jersey indefinitely after spills at a
refinery and a distribution terminal this week.
   Exxon President Lee Raymond said marine operations in the state
would be halted while Exxon evaluated procedures at its Bayway
refinery in Linden and Bayonne distribution terminal.
   The refinery is the only one Exxon operates on the East Coast.
The company said alternate supply arrangements were being made for
gasoline, heating oil, propane and other products, and no
interruptions were expected.
   ``We deeply regret the recent accidents at our New Jersey
facilities and the impacts and concerns they have caused,'' Raymond
said in a statement.
   ``We are seriously committed to conducting our operations in a
safe and environmentally responsible manner and we are taking this
measure to demonstrate that commitment,'' he said.
   The Bayway refinery and the distribution center have been the
site of three oil spills since Jan. 1. Exxon also has come under
criticism and faces a federal criminal indictment in connection
with a large oil spill in Alaska last year.
   On Wednesday, a leaking barge owned by a private contractor
spilled 30,000 gallons into the Kill Van Kull waterway while taking
on a loan of heating oil at Exxon's Bayonne terminal.
   While crews were trying to contain the previous day's spill, a
fuel line broke free while a Texaco barge was being filled at the
Bayway refinery Thursday, resulting in a 4,800-gallon spill in the
Arthur Kill waterway.
   A ruptured pipeline at the Bayway refinery on Jan. 1-2 dumped
567,000 gallons of oil into the Arthur Kill.
   Exxon was blamed for the January spill and Eklof Marine Corp. of
Staten Island, N.Y., took responsibility for Wednesday's mishap.
   Coast Guard Capt. Robert North said officials haven't determined
who was to blame for Thursday's spill. He said the spill largely
was contained by booms and did not appear to have spread into the
harbor.
   Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said he had written Exxon
Chairman and Chief Executive Lawrence Rawl requesting that the
company voluntarily impose emergency procedures at the two New
Jersey facilities.
   ``This is either an extraordinary coincidence of accidents or
Exxon is simply not doing a good job of meeting minimum
standards,'' Torricelli said.
   He called on Exxon to voluntarily place booms around all vessels
during oil transfers, and temporarily halt night operations until
they the company reviewed its procedures, but Exxon went further.
   Attorney General Robert Abrams of New York called on Exxon to
submit to an independent environmental audit of the company's
operation in New York and New Jersey.
   Abrams said that ``in light of the cumulative adverse impact of
these repeated spills, resolute and extraordinary action on Exxon's
part is overdue.''

   Mobil Oil Corp. has agreed to pay $500,000 in
fines and submit to a review of its operations after it spilled
50,000 gallons of kerosene into the ground in Brooklyn, state
officials said Friday.
   Mobil also must reimburse the state for cleaning up the mess
left when the kerosene leaked a Mobil facility, state Department of
Environmental Conservation Commissioner Thomas C. Jorling said.
   In addition, the company must test all product plumes under the
facility, not just the one resulting from the Feb. 3 spill, he
said. The spill did not reach a creek that feeds into New York's
East River, officials said.
   The $500,000 fine is the maximum penalty under state
environmental conservation and navigation laws.
   The state accused Mobil of violating laws by failing to report
the spill for several days and failing to test the kerosene storage
tank before it was put back into service after reconditioning.
   The 100-year-old tank was reconditioned and returned to service
Jan. 29.
   On Feb. 5, Mobil notified the DEC that 80 gallons of kerosene
had leaked from the tank two days earlier. The company raised the
estimated size of the release to 50,000 gallons the next day, the
DEC said.
   Mobil later claimed to have recovered 37,000 gallons of kerosene
through an underground drainage and treatment system, the DEC said.
   Mobil spokesman Mark Cohen said the company would work with
state and local agencies to take ``whatever corrective action
necessary to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.''

<HEAD>Texas Air, Eastern Threaten Action To Clear Names</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp. and its Eastern Airlines
subsidiary threatened unspecified action Friday to clear their
names after a court report said Texas Air short-changed Eastern
when it bought the airline and some of its assets.
   Texas Air agreed earlier this week to pay Eastern more than $280
million to settle the findings by court-appointed bankruptcy
examiner David I. Shapiro. He concluded that Texas Air owes Eastern
$285 million to $403 million for assets it purchased at unfairly
low prices.
   Shapiro's findings supported a key contention by striking
Eastern workers, who claimed Texas Air stripped the airline of its
most valuable assets to bolster the parent's non-union carrier,
Continental Airlines.
   Eastern and Texas Air said Thursday they rejected the validity
of Shapiro's conclusions. In a statement Friday, they also
threatened to take ``serious and considered actions'' to vindicate
themselves.
   ``We find ourselves in the intolerable position where our
commitments to rebuild Eastern are being improperly used to imply
that Texas Air somehow agrees with this amateurish report, and that
our assistance to Eastern somehow constitutes payment to settle any
such liabilities,'' the statement said.
   Texas Air spokesman Art Kent declined comment on what form the
action might take. He said discussions on various options are under
way and a decision would be made soon.
   Richard Seltzer, an attorney for the Air Line Pilots
Association, said it was difficult to see what the companies might
do, other than file an objection with federal bankruptcy court.
   Shapiro didn't return a telephone call seeking comment.
   Shapiro said in the report that he did not agree with the
unions' request that Eastern be run by an outside trustee, which
was sought as protection against further asset sales by Texas Air
during bankruptcy reorganization.
   Union attorneys insisted a trustee still should be named to take
over management of the company.
   Approval of the settlement by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R.
Lifland could remove a main obstacle in Eastern's effort to emerge
from bankruptcy, because some of the compensation would help
satisfy creditor claims against the Miami-based airline.
   Shapiro concluded, for example, that Eastern should recover $150
million to $250 million from Texas Air for the transfer of the
System One computer reservation system, and $61 million for Texas
Air's acquisition of Eastern in November 1986.
   Under the proposed settlement, Eastern also would receive a 25
percent share in System One and the right to buy 40 Boeing 737-300
jets at cost from sister carrier Continental. The settlement's
total value is estimated at more than $280 million and includes
$133 million in cash.
   Shapiro issued his findings following a lengthy investigation
into the dealings between Texas Air, Eastern and Continental
undertaken as part of Eastern's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case.
   The airline sought protection from creditors five days after a
March 4, 1989, strike by machinists, flight attendants and pilots
that virtually grounded it. Eastern has been reorganizing as a
smaller carrier and has hired replacements for many of the strikers.
   The pilots and flight attendants unions abandoned the strike in
November but Machinists remain on strike.

<HEAD>Too Many Car-Truck Plants in North America, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PAOLI, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The North American auto industry continues to
have too much capacity and will need to shut five or six more
plants in addition to the five closed down in recent years,
according to an independent study.
   ``All the announced plant closings will not be enough to close
the gap,'' said William R. Pochiluk, president of AUTOFACTS, an
independent consultant.
   The firm's study, released Thursday, also said Ford Motor Co.
made more efficient use of its manufacturing plant capacity last
year than other major automakers.
   In 1989, the study found a total industry capacity of 14.3
million cars and light trucks, down 1 percent from 1988.
   Overall, the industry used 88 percent of its plant capacity last
year. Manufacturers used 82 percent of capacity to make cars and
101 percent of capacity for light trucks.
   For the second year, Ford led the way, with a 90 percent
capacity utilization for cars and 107 percent for light trucks.
   Capacity utilization refers to how many vehicles a manufacturer
actually produced. A manufacturer producing at more than 100
percent of capacity had to operate at overtime, Pochiluk said.
   Foreign-based producers manufactured at 94 percent of capacity,
with cars at 93 percent and light trucks at 101 percent.
   Chrysler Corp. achieved 86 percent capacity utilization overall,
reflecting below average performance of 76 percent for cars and 97
percent for light trucks.
   General Motors Corp. recorded the lowest overall results in 1989
_ an 82 percent overall capacity utilization rate with a low 76
percent rate in cars offset by a light truck rate of 99 percent.
   AUTOFACTS counts 79 automotive plants producing cars and light
trucks in the United States and Canada currently, with a
straight-time capacity of 14.4 million vehicles. Actual 1990 car
and light truck production is scheduled to total 11.8 million, 7.2
million cars and 4.6 million light trucks.
   Five assembly plants are projected to open and five to close
permanently by 1995, the study said, but the industry's rated
capacity will grow to 15.7 million units.
   While domestic capacity should average 15.4 million units from
1992 to 1995, production of light vehicles is projected to average
13.4 million, Pochiluk said.
   ``There are approximately 5 to 6 plants of excess capacity for
the 1990-95 planning window,'' the study said.
   Foreign manufacturers, primarily Japanese, accepted the
challenge to produce more in America, the study said, but the
strategy backfired on domesitic automakers as exchange rates
resulted in lower manufacturing costs for the ``transplant''
vehicles.
   The study listed several auto plants it considered
``vulnerable'' for closure in the next five years, including some
where a shutdown is already pending.
   They included GM plants in Lakewood, Ga.; Lordstown, Ohio;
Scarborough, Ontario; Van Nuys, Calif.; Linden, N.J.; Lansing,
Mich.; Arlington, Texas; Wentzville, Mo., and Orion, Mich.
   Also on the list was Ford's Fox plant in Dearborn, Mich.;
Chrysler plants in St. Louis; Brampton, Ontario, and Pillette Road,
Ontario; and a GM-Toyota joint venture in Fremont, Calif.

<HEAD>Judge Clears Way for Channel One in North Carolina</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS PATTERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Superior Court judge Friday cleared the
way for Channel One, a daily news show with commercials aimed at
teenagers, to begin beaming into North Carolina classrooms.
   The news show, being produced by Whittle Communications of
Knoxville, Tenn., is set to begin nationally on Monday.
   After an allday hearing, Judge Donald Stephens ruled that the
State Board of Education has the authority to ban the 12-minute
news program, but did not follow the correct procedures in imposing
a ban Feb. 1.
   His order dismisses a lawsuit brought by the State Board of
Education against the Thomasville school system and Whittle
Communications. It also reverses a decision by the State Board that
contracts signed for Channel One before Feb. 1 are void and that no
new contracts can be signed.
   ``After a careful review, the court concludes that the State
Board of Education has the authority to make rules concerning
supplemental materials that contain advertising,'' Stephens said.
But he said the State Board must follow procedures for rulemaking
by state agencies.
   The board's ban had been imposed immediately as an emergency
rule while the board pursued procedures to make it permanent, but
Stephens ruled because there was no evidence of an immediate threat
to the public welfare by allowing Channel One to proceed.
   The 12-minute news program contains two minutes of commercials
and more than 2,700 schools have signed up for the service
nationwide.
   About 30 school boards in North Carolina have signed up for the
service, which loans local schools video equipment in exchange for
a guarantee that the news show will be shown to students every day.
   Edwin Speas, representing the State Board, argued that the
required viewing of Channel One amounted to exploitation of
students who are required to be in school under the state's
compulsory attendance law.
   But Stephens ruled that the contracts with Whittle do not
violate public policy or the state constitution because no valid
rule against the contracts in effect.
   ``We think it's a victory for children and teachers in North
Carolina,'' said Max Walser, superintendent of the Davidson County
schools. Davidson County's school board, which had signed a
contract with Whittle prior to the ban, had filed a countersuit
against the State Board of Education.
   ``We are certainly pleased that the judge ruled, as we have
felt, that the State Board acted improperly,'' said Gene Causby of
the state School Boards Association. ``Those contracts are back in
force.''
   Speas said after the ruling that it did not amount to a total
victory for Channel One supporters.
   `` The court has confirmed their (the State Board's) authority
in this area, which was very important,'' Speas said. ``The judge
said that a rule can be made, it just has to follow the regulations
of the Administrative Procedures Act.''
   Speas said an official notice that the State Board intends to
impose the ban already has been given and a public hearing required
by rulemaking regulations has been scheduled for April 2.
   ``The existing contracts are valid and Channel One will premiere
in North Carolina schools on March 5,'' said Ed Winter, president
of Whittle Communications. ``Those school systems that have not yet
signed contracts, but would like to, are now free to do so.''
