<HEAD>Man Gets Long Prison Sentence For ``Date Rape'' Incidents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man convicted in three ``date rapes''
involving three women he worked with at a restaurant was sentenced
Tuesday to up to 53 years in prison by a state judge who labeled
him a ``sexual predator.''
   Albany County Judge W. Thomas Keegan sentenced Kenneth Smyers,
28, of Menands to 17 2-3 years to 53 years.
   Smyers was convicted Dec. 19 of one count each of rape and
sexual abuse and two counts of sodomy.
   Before sentencing, Smyers proclaimed his innocence and asked
why, if he had committed such crimes, it had taken the women
involved so long to come forward and make complaints to authorities.
   Five women, all co-workers at the Albany-area restaurant,
testified that Smyers attacked them, but some admitted they didn't
tell authorities until several months later.
   The jury acquitted Smyers on one count each of rape and
attempted sexual abuse in attacks on two of the women, and of
attempted rape on the woman he was convicted of sexually abusing.
   Assistant District Attorney Veronica Dumas, who prosecuted
Smyers, said the stiff sentence sends a signal that ``date rape''
is a crime that won't be tolerated in the county.
   ``He was convicted of four violent felonies and that sentence
projects what those crimes are,'' she said.
   The incidents took place between October 1987 and July 1988,
prosecutors said.
   According to testimony at Smyers' trial, the attacks occurred
under differing circumstances. One woman said she voluntarily had
sex with Smyers, but said a few days later he showed up at her
apartment and forced himself on her over her objections.
   Another woman said she allowed Smyers to sleep on her couch
during a snowstorm, but ended up having to fight him off. He was
convicted of sexual abuse in that incident.
   Several of the women said they continued to work and socialize
with Smyers after the incidents.
   Smyers' attorney, Stephen Coffey, said he would appeal the
conviction.
   Coffey said that Smyers had a legitimate argument when he asked
why it took so long for the women he's accused of attacking to come
forward.
   ``Where were these women all this time? ... Why weren't they
saying anything,'' he asked. ``They were educated women. Why was it
they were working with him and associating with him, and with each
other, and not coming forward?''

   Two men accused of conspiring to break
into an Army computer network and the phone system surrendered
Tuesday in federal court, but the man the government says was the
ringleader remained at large.
   Silicon Valley computer experts Mark K. Lottor, 25, and Robert
E. Gilligan, 31, turned themselves over to authorities before U.S.
District Court Magistrate Patricia Trumbull.
   Lottor and Gilligan entered innocent pleas and were released on
$100,000 bond each. They are to return to court next week.
   Lottor faces five courts and Gilligan six in the government's
19-count indictment alleging a scheme to steal military secrets and
phone numbers from the FBI investigation of former Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Authorities were still searching Tuesday for 24-year-old Kevin
L. Poulsen, who is charged in 16 counts.
   Poulsen faces up to 37 years in prison if convicted. The other
two suspects face 20 years each if found guilty of all charges.
   Lottor works for SRI International and Gilligan works for Sun
Microsystems of Mountain View.
   Poulsen, a former SRI worker who is believed to have fled to Los
Angeles after leaving a job with Sun, was an unindicted
co-conspirator in the 1984 computer break-in case at the University
of California at Los Angeles.
   Poulsen's friend, hacker Ron Austin, was convicted on charges
related to the break-in. Authorities said Poulsen used the computer
handle ``Dark Dante'' at the time.
   Federal officials contend the latest computer tampering began in
1985 and started to fall apart in February 1988 when police found
telephone equipment belonging to Pacific Bell in a storage locker
rented by Poulsen.
   ``As far as techniques, you can see this started out as a
burglary,'' said FBI Agent William Smith. ``That's what we have:
burglars who came upon equipment that allowed them to go beyond the
common crime of burglary.''

<HEAD>Oat Bran Craze May Have Peaked, Analysts Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Consumers weary of oat bran probably
won't go back to bacon and eggs for breakfast, but they may be
looking for alternatives now that a study has cast doubt on oat
bran's cure-all image.
   ``Oat bran was a fad anyway, and I think the study will be the
catalyst for the gradual reduction in sales,'' said Ron Saba, a
food industry analyst with the Ohio Co., an investment firm.
   Saba said he thought some people would stick with oat bran.
``But for some people it's going to give them an excuse to trade in
those oat bran muffins for Twinkies,'' he said.
   The New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday published
results of a study that said eating oat bran had no more effect
than other grains on a person's cholesterol level. It said any
beneficial effect appeared to come from cereals displacing fatty
foods in the diet.
   It contradicts previous studies that found oat bran was able to
interfere with fat absorption and lower cholesterol, thereby
lowering the chance for heart disease.
   Not everyone was certain the report would shake the confidence
of health-conscious consumers.
   ``Maybe it takes some of fiery brilliance out of the oat bran
craze ... but I don't know if we'll see any immediate change in
consumer demand,'' said Bonnie Rivers, an analyst with Salomon
Brothers Inc. ``I don't think consumers are going to go back to
eating bacon and eggs for breakfast.''
   For some consumers who've grown tired of oat bran in everything
from pretzels and tortilla chips to doughnuts and beer, the study
is just what they wanted to hear.
   ``I started eating oat bran for breakfast every day about a year
ago after all the hoopla,'' said Pat Edwards, who was choosing
among the cereals in a Grand Rapids supermarket Thursday night.
``Quite frankly, I was never too crazy about it. This is just the
excuse I was looking for to try something else.''
   ``That's just human nature,'' responded Quaker Oats Co.
spokesman Ron Bottrell. ``People like variety. And we've never
positioned oat bran as a magic bullet or the one food people had to
eat to see a reduction in their cholesterol.''
   However, Quaker, which saw sales of Oat Bran Original Hot Cereal
go from 1 million pounds in all of 1987 to 2 million pounds per
month in 1989, has criticized the study, saying that its sample was
too small _ 20 volunteers _ and didn't reflect the general
population.
   ``We don't feel like this one study can negate the 25 years of
research that preceded it,'' said Quaker spokeswoman Theresa
Herlevsen. ``This is not going to affect our marketing strategies
at all.''
   In 1986, Quaker spent a couple of million dollars a year
advertising its oat bran cereal. By 1989, it was spending $50
million on its hot cereal products, much of which was spent on oat
bran promotion, Herlevsen said.
   Analysts say oat bran products have been the fastest growing
segment of the $6.5 billion cereal industry.
   In Battle Creek, a spokeswoman for Kellogg Co., which makes
three ready-to-eat oat bran cereals _ two of which were introduced
in the last two years _ also said the study will not affect
marketing strategies.
   ``We don't make health claims on our cereal,'' said spokeswoman
Nancy Roach. ``We've always promoted our products as being part of
a balanced diet and we will continue to do so.''
   Analysts say the study may prompt some companies to quit selling
fringe oat-bran products, such as potato chips, and may stifle the
introduction of such new products. Last year, 218 products
containing oat bran were introduced, according to Gorman's New
Product News, a Chicago newsletter.
   ``Things have gotten carried away with it being promoted almost
like a drug,'' said Bob Bernstein, an analyst with Edward D. Jones
&amp; Co. ``It almost got to be that oat bran was the be-all and
end-all cure-all. ... People will always looking for the easy way
out.''
   Other food companies called attention to the fact that the study
didn't dispute any effects of soluble fiber found in other foods
such as fruits, vegetables, beans and brown rice.
   But a recent study at the University of Texas was unable to
duplicate three other studies which found rice bran could affect
cholesterol levels. The Rice Council of America, which paid for the
study, called the results inconclusive.

<HEAD>Hawaiians Vote on What Constitutes a `Native'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   When Thomas Kaulukukui tells his grandchildren
of their ancestors who populated these islands and shares
traditions passed through generations of his family, he can't help
but think they are as Hawaiian as he. In a world that prizes
definitions, however, some do not.
   Kaulukukui is one-half Hawaiian, his three children are
one-quarter and his four grandchildren one-eighth. Under Hawaii
law, only those with 50 percent or more Hawaiian blood are
considered ``native'' Hawaiians. Others are termed Hawaiians.
   ``My grandchildren ask, `Am I Hawaiian or am I not?' What can I
tell them?'' Kaulukukui said.
   The problem is especially troubling for Kaulukukui because he is
chairman of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, an agency established
by the state to benefit Hawaiians _ those considered natives as
well as those with any amount of native blood.
   By law, some OHA services are available only to those with 50
percent or more of Hawaiian blood. Realizing the number of such
people will continue shrinking because of intermarriage, OHA is
making this distinction the subject of a non-binding referendum,
with Thursday the last day for mailing back ballots.
   OHA is asking descendants of these islands' first inhabitants
whether all those with Hawaiian blood should be termed native
Hawaiians and thus entitled to all OHA services.
   Federal programs define native Hawaiian as those with any amount
of Hawaiian blood, Kaulukukui said.
   Although no precise figure is available, it is estimated that
200,000 of Hawaii's 1 million residents have at least some Hawaiian
blood. As many as 60,000 of those have at least 50 percent Hawaiian
blood.
   OHA receives money from the state and from income derived from
trust lands turned over to Hawaii by the federal government upon
statehood in 1959. The two sources each provide roughly half OHA's
$2.5 million yearly revenue, Kaulukukui said.
   Only those with 50 percent or more Hawaiian blood are entitled
to services funded by the land proceeds, but all Hawaiians may
receive state-funded benefits.
   ``We are all one family. We shouldn't have this wedge between
us,'' said State Sen. Mike Crozier, a supporter of dropping the
two-tiered definition of Hawaiian. He is one-quarter Hawaiian.
   OHA mailed 63,000 ballots to voters registered with the agency _
including those with all levels of Hawaiian blood.
   The ballot asks whether OHA voters want to change the definition
of native Hawaiian to ``all descendants of the indigenous people
inhabiting the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778,'' when the first
outsider, Capt. James Cook of Great Britain, arrived.
   OHA will present the referendum results to the
Democrat-controlled Legislature, where a bill to change the state
Constitution has a good chance of passing if the survey favors
dropping the two-tiered definition of native Hawaiian.
   Such a measure would require a two-thirds vote of both houses
and ratification by the voters, Crozier said.
   OHA, a semi-autonomous agency with a board of trustees elected
by voters of Hawaiian ancestry, serves an advocacy role for all
Hawaiians and provides money for educational, legal and other
programs.
   Kaulukukui said OHA programs should not be confused with the
Hawaiian Homes Act, passed by Congress in 1920. It allows those
with 50 percent or more Hawaiian blood to lease plots of government
land for homesteads.
   Only Congress can change that blood requirement, Kaulukukui said.
   Kamaki Kanahele, president of Hawaiian Homesteaders, a state
council representing Hawaiians, disagrees with Kaulukukui and is
urging his group's 27,000 members to vote against the proposal.
   Kanahele said he fears Congress will take a change in the state
Constitution as a signal to change the blood requirement for the
homelands program. Since the homelands program was created, some
6,000 homestead leases have been awarded and there are about 19,000
names on the waiting list.
   Under state law, OHA is entitled to a 20 percent share of
proceeds from leases on more than a million acres former crown and
government land from the time before the overthrow of the Hawaiian
monarchy.
   Kaulukukui said he hopes enlarging OHA's scope of
responsibilities will persuade state leaders to give the agency a
greater share of the land trust proceeds.

<HEAD>Former Bank Regulator Blasts Cranston</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen Alan Cranston's attempts to blame
former banking regulator Edwin J. Gray for the Lincoln Savings &amp;
Loan Association debacle were met with a harsh 4,000-word letter of
reply.
   Cranston, who is seeking re-election, is a ``desperate,
panic-stricken office holder,'' Gray wrote Monday.
   ``The fact that it happened partially on my watch is as much a
reflection on your failure, yes your unwillingness, to help me
obtain the reforms I sent up to the Hill,'' he wrote.
   ``Never once, Sen. Cranston, did you lift a finger to help me
with the statutory reforms. ... Your big-giver friends didn't like
me or my regulations.''
   Cranston spokesman Kam Kuwata responded, ``Gray claimed he could
do nothing, but he only claims that because he did nothing. He
makes Pinnochio look like a piker when it comes to lying about his
involvement in this scandal.''
   Gray headed the Federal Home Loan Bank Board when San
Francisco-based federal regulators recommended a takeover of
Irvine-based Lincoln on May 1, 1987, three weeks after Cranston and
four other senators held their second private meeting with
regulators. Gray left office on June 30, 1987.
   Cranston, who continues to blame Gray for investors' losses,
said Monday he would introduce legislation allowing the government
to bail out consumers who lost $200 million on junk bonds purchased
at Lincoln branches.
   He said that even though it was technically legal, regulators
should never have allowed Lincoln to sell the unsecured bonds
because investors could easily be led to believe they were
federally insured.
   Cranston spoke at the latest in a series of news conferences
intended to deflect blame aimed at him for the failure of Lincoln.
The collapse is expected to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion,
aside from any efforts to repay the junk bond holders.
   Cranston, the Senate majority whip, is one of five senators
under investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee for intervening
with regulators on behalf of Lincoln and Charles H. Keating Jr.,
chief of American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, Lincoln's parent.
   Keating and his family contributed $1.3 million to the senators
and their causes.
   By focusing on the bondholders, Cranston hopes to disarm one of
the most personally damaging allegations against him: bondholders'
testimony that his intervention for Keating made him partly
responsible for their losses.

   A traffic stop escalated into gunfire and
death for a young man Tuesday in a confrontation between sheriff's
deputies and several Black Muslims, the second such incident this
month.
   The two deputies who made the early-morning stop claimed they
were surrounded by several men, one of whom disarmed an officer.
   That deputy pulled a backup weapon and fired several rounds,
striking and killing Oliver Beasley, 27, who lived in an area west
of suburban Compton, said sheriff's Deputy Chris Wahla.
   The two deputies ``were in a fight for their lives,'' said
sheriff's Sgt. Steve Van Herpe. The sergeant said deputies
described several of the assailants as members of the Nation of
Islam religious group.
   Neither deputy was hurt. Authorities did not identify them.
   It was the second confrontation this month between Black Muslims
and law enforcement officers, both sparked by traffic stops.
   Residents of the neighborhood complained Tuesday that deputies
order black people to get out of their cars and lay spread-eagle on
the street or stretch over the hood of their car for even routine
stops, a demand they contend is not made of whites.
   While deputies conducted their investigation, several people
shouted angrily at them, claiming some of the arrested men had been
beaten while handcuffed. A crowd was ordered to disperse at one
point.
   A man identified as David Hartley, 18, of Culver City, was
wounded and later booked for attempted murder. He was being treated
in the jail ward of County-USC Medical Center, listed in
satisfactory condition with a shoulder wound.
   Five other men, ranging in age from 15 to 35, also were arrested
and booked for investigation of attempted murder following a
night-long search by of the neighborhood by deputies, including a
SWAT team.
   The gun allegedly taken from the deputy was found on the
stairwell of an apartment building where three of the men were
arrested, authorities said.
   A man who answered a telephone call to Nation of Islam
headquarters in Los Angeles on Tuesday said, ``No one will be
making any comment ... until we've made a full investigation.'' The
man said the organization would hold a news conference in a day or
two.
   The fatal fight came a day after Los Angeles Police Department
officials and Nation of Islam leaders met to discuss easing tense
relations with law enforcement following a Jan. 3 street brawl
between police and Muslims that followed a traffic stop.
   Two dozen police officers and 13 Nation of Islam members were
involved in a melee Jan. 3 in the southwest side of the city. There
were injuries on both sides.
   Police claim one of the Muslims interfered with the arrest
process, then attacked officers when they tried to arrest him.
Companions ran out of cars and joined the fray.
   Six Muslims attended Monday's meeting.
   ``I've been with the nation for 32 years and I know of no other
time when Muslims and police have sat down and talked on this
level,'' said Wali Muhammad, head of the western branch of the
Fruit of Islam, the Nation of Islam's security detail.
   The Police Department is conducting an internal investigation of
allegations that officers started the brawl.

<HEAD>Staff Sergeant Pleads Guilty To Stealing Military Property</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military judge on Tuesday
sentenced an Air Force maintenance worker to seven years in prison
and a dishonorable discharge for stealing and selling military
equipment to undercover FBI agents.
   Staff Sgt. Chris L. London, Enfield, Conn., pleaded guilty to 20
charges during a court-martial Monday.
   London said he stole the $67,432 worth of equipment because he
needed money to pay bills and child support.
   ``It's not an excuse,'' he told Air Force Judge Lt. Col. Linda
Carter. ``I'm sorry that it ever happened. I'm glad the government
property has been returned.''
   London asked the judge for forgiveness and pleaded for a lenient
sentence, saying lengthy confinement would prevent him from being a
good father to his son.
   Carter accepted the guilty pleas and said she wanted to view a
videotape showing transactions between London and the FBI agents
before deciding on a sentence. She deliberated about one hour
Tuesday and returned with her decision that evening.
   London, who had faced up to 171 years in military prison,
dishonorable discharge and loss of benefits, showed no emotion when
Carter read the sentence.
   He was charged in October as a result of Operation Punchout, a
two-year FBI sting investigation.
   The stolen items included 42 automatic life preserver units,
pilot helmets, gloves, chin straps, camouflage clothing and an
insect head net.
   They were taken from Hill Air Force Base between 1986 and 1989
and sold to a mock military surplus store set up by the FBI in
nearby Roy, officials said.
   Government attorney Brian Newby of Travis Air Force Base in
California told the judge earlier that London deserved to be put in
prison for 11 years and receive a dishonorable discharge because he
disgraced the American flag by ``lining his pockets with money.''
   ``We aim high ... we expect the best,'' Newby said. ``We demand
the best.''
   However, defense attorney Capt. George Horvath of Hill Air Force
Base said London was remorseful and that financial strains led him
to commit ``desperate acts.''
   ``The property has been returned intact,'' he said. ``Allow him
the chance to learn and grow from this.''
   He recommended a two-year jail sentence.
   London, 26, was among nearly three dozen military and civilian
personnel charged in the probe, which culminated last July in the
theft of two F-16 jet engines from the base.
   Two Air Force security guards admitted stealing the engines and
will be sentenced Friday in U.S. District Court.
   When the sting was first announced last summer, U.S. Attorney
Dee Benson said it could eventually result in indictments gainst
more than 100 people. The investigation targeted military thefts
from bases in the West and Southwest.

<HEAD>Colombia's Most Wanted Drug Trafficker Bids Anew for Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of Colombia's notorious
Medellin cocaine cartel has written to a Bogota newspaper saying he
wants to set them straight on a story: he still runs the cartel and
his friends haven't deserted him.
   ``My freedom is the best proof I have to show the country that
the people are not selling me out and that my friends are neither
abandoning nor betraying me,'' Pablo Escobar wrote.
   An article Monday in El Tiempo quoted security force officials
as saying Escobar's principal allies were abandoning him as police
and the military moved in, pursuing an all-out drug war by the
government of President Virgilio Barco. Escobar wrote on Tuesday to
El Tiempo publisher Hernando Santos Castillo, saying he was still
in control of the most powerful drug operation in Colombia and that
it stood together in its decision to seek peace with the government.
   The letter carried Escobar's signature and bore what was
apparently the imprint of his index finger, to prove the document
was genuine. The document was also sent to other news media.
   Escobar, who heads the country's most wanted list with a
$500,000 dead-or-alive price on his head, also said the Medellin
cartel would keep up its war against the rival Cali cartel, based
to the south of Medellin.
   He said Jorge Valasquez, a member of the Cali cartel, gave
information to police that resulted in their killing of Gonzalo
Rodriguez Gacha in a shootout on Dec. 15. Rodriguez Gacha was
Escobar's close associate and a man considered the most violent of
the Medellin drug lords.
   Escobar said the entire cartel was behind a peace offer made by
its leaders last week to Barco's government, asking for
``constitutional and legal guarantees'' in exchange for the
cartel's agreeing to give up the cocaine business, stop its
campaign of violence and free its hostages.
   The cartel is reckoned to still hold 16 people, after freeing
five recently.
   Escobar's letter indicated the cartel still will demand an end
to extradition, however.
   The Barco government has packed off 13 trafficking suspects to
the United States since it intensified its drug war in August. The
drug traffickers replied with a terror campaign that has claimed
the lives of 209 people and included the bombing a Colombian
airliner.
   Escobar indicated there was no disagreement within the cartel
over the peace offer, which the government has refused to accept,
saying drug bosses who surrender will have to answer in court for
their crimes.
   His letter read, ``If the Colombian government someday decides
to fight for the peace of our nation in a sovereign and courageous
way, it will find an interminable list of extradition candidates,
drug traffickers, hired assassins and paramilitary forces that want
to join it in the process.''
   Military forces said on Tuesday they were taking whatever
measures were necessary to protect President Bush from Escobar and
other drug barons when Bush attends an antidrug summit in Cartagena
on Feb. 15.
   U.S. authorities have reportedly said traffickers are preparing
an attempt on Bush's life in the five hours he will be in Cartagena.
   Bush, Barco, President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia and possibly
President Alan Garcia of Peru are to discuss cooperation in the
fight against drugs.
   Garcia's participation was not certain. He said he would not
attend while U.S. invasion troops remained in Panama.

<HEAD>NBC's `Grand' Soars in Premiere and `Dear John' Falls</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a sweet ratings tune for the premiere
of NBC's ``Grand.'' But ``Dear John,'' which was moved to make room
for the comedy about a town that makes pianos, may feel it's gotten
the proverbial goodbye letter.
   ``Grand'' made its debut in fifth place last week. It was
broadcast in the Thursday night slot behind NBC's ``Cheers,' which
finished No. 1.
   ``Grand's'' rating was 21.4, higher than ``Dear John'' had been
getting.
   ``Dear John,'' which moved to Wednesday, fell to 33rd place from
ninth the previous week, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co. Although
its ratings dropped from 19.8 to 14.1, it was two points ahead of
the show it displaced. ``My Two Dads'' was moved to Sunday in the
shuffle.
   For the week, NBC finished first with an average of 14.6. ABC
reclaimed second place with 13.5 and CBS had a 12.8 average. A
ratings point represents the percentage of the nation's 92.1
million television homes tuned to a show.
   For the season, NBC leads with 14.8 to ABC's 13.0 and CBS' 12.3.
   Here are last week's Top 10 prime-time shows: NBC's ``Cheers'';
NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ABC's ``Roseanne'' tied; CBS' ``60
Minutes''; NBC's ``Grand''; NBC's ``A Different World''; CBS'
``Murder, She Wrote''; CBS Sunday Movie ``The Operation''; ABC's
``The Wonder Years'' and NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries.''
   Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment, said recently
he wanted to put ``Grand'' into the favored Thursday night position
because the show needed to be protected nurtured.
   As Tartikoff had predicted, ``Grand'' got a higher rating than
``Dear John'' and closed the gap with ``Cheers.'' He said he had
also wanted to improve the Wednesday ratings by moving ``Dear
John,'' which had been consistently in the top 10, behind ``Night
Court.''
   ``Dear John'' did get better ratings than ``My Two Dads,'' but
it still fell behind Fox Broadcasting's ``The Simpsons'' and
``Married...With Children.''
   ABC's new series ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' was 11th. It
could mean trouble for its CBS Sunday night competition, ``Murder,
She Wrote.'' Especially when it is joined in February by another
new ABC show, ``Elvis,'' about the early life of Elvis Presley.
   The ABC show has already had a devastating effect on NBC's
``Sister Kate'' and the newly placed ``My Two Dads.'' The two NBC
shows were at the bottom of the network shows.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won among the evening news shows
and NBC and CBS tied for second. The ratings: ABC 11.8, NBC and CBS
10.8.

   A judge rejected efforts by a man accused
of killing his wife, mother and three children 18 years ago to bar
reporters and spectators from pretrial hearings in his murder case.
   An attorney for the man authorities say is John E. List argued
that widespread reporting of the case would prejudice potential
jurors and deny him a fair trial.
   But Superior Court Judge William Wertheimer on Tuesday said
closing the hearing ``is offensive to the general public and
undermines public trust.''
   Wertheimer set March 20 as the first day of jury selection.
   The defendant says he is Robert P. Clark, who authorities
arrested in Virginia on a tip from a viewer of the national
television program ``America's Most Wanted.''
   Officials said List killed his family in their home in suburban
Westfield in November 1971.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Capital Gains Tax Cut in Trouble Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's pet legislative project, a
cut in the capital gains tax, is in trouble again on Capitol Hill
even though congressional support seemed to be building at the end
of last year.
   It ran head-on into a proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., to cut Social Security taxes. The collision could derail
the Bush measure, or at least complicate the process.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine once called the
capital gains cut Bush's ``holy grail.''
   Bush has been pushing the reduction with unabated zeal since
early in his presidential campaign, and in fact, since he was a
junior member of the House Ways and Means Committee during the
1960s.
   The tax on capital gains _ the profit from the sale of stocks,
real estate and other investments _ was cut during the mid-1970s.
But the major tax code overhaul of 1986 boosted the tax to the same
rate as other income, 28 percent or 33 percent, depending on tax
bracket.
   Bush associates say the president has a deep repugnance for the
tax, stemming from his oil field business background and honed,
perhaps, by his own unpleasant brush with the tax as vice president
_ when the Internal Revenue Service rejected his attempt to claim a
deferral.
   When Bush sold his family's five-bedroom home in Houston in 1981
for $843,273, he claimed a tax deferral on his $596,101 capital
gain because he used the money to buy his family vacation home in
Kennebunkport, Maine.
   But the IRS ruled in 1984 that Bush misused the deferral, saying
it only would have applied if the Kennebunkport home was to be the
new principal family residence. The IRS socked the Bushes $144,000
in back taxes and $54,000 in interest.
   Bush paid up, but accused the IRS of unfairly singling him out.
   White House aides are bracing for a new Democratic assault on
the capital gains cut while trying to figure ways to separate the
two tax cut issues.
   It may be a hard job in a congressional election year _ although
just last fall the House voted to cut the capital gains tax to 19.6
percent from the current maximum of 33 percent and the Senate gave
the plan majority approval. However, the measure died for the year
in a procedural vote in the Senate.
   ``We think the Moynihan proposal will die of its own weight. It
won't have any effect on capital gains,'' Bush spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Tuesday.
   However, other White House aides privately were far less
optimistic, conceding Democratic attempts to link the two tax cuts
likely would make it harder to win a reduction in the capital gains
tax rate.
   As Congress reconvened after its two-month recess, Senate
Majority Leader Mitchell spelled out the party line that will spell
trouble for the capital gains tax cut.
   ``It's obviously embarrassing to the White House to be in the
position of advocating a huge tax cut for the very highest people
in the income bracket and at the same time opposing any tax cuts
for middle-income and working people _ saying, in effect, let the
little people pay, but let's cut taxes for the wealthy,'' Mitchell
said.
   The White House strategy is to sniff at such reasoning and to
belittle the Moynihan proposal _ which Bush himself calls a
``charade'' that will lead to either higher taxes in other areas or
reduced benefits.
   They point to a measure introduced by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings,
D-S.C., for a 5 percent national sales tax to help make up revenue
that would be lost by the Social Security tax cut.
   Still, analysts suggest the administration's role will be a
difficult one. The Moynihan plan ``has created some chaos out
there,'' said Norman Ornstein of the conservative American
Enterprise Institute.
   And Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser for the WEFA
Group, a private economic forecasting service based in Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., said Moynihan's proposal ``will make it more difficult to pass
the capital gains tax cut. How can you come up with that after
rejecting a tax cut for the average guy?''

<HEAD>New Congressman Faces Jail Term Back in Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The newest member of Congress, Texas Democrat
Craig Washington, says he didn't know about a court date he missed
back in Houston _ an absence that prompted a judge to sentence him
to 30 days in jail.
   Washington, a Houston lawyer, was found in contempt of court on
Monday by State District Judge Jim Barr in Houston, one day before
he took the oath of office to become a member of the U.S. House.
   It was the second time in two weeks a jail sentence has been
ordered for Washington for not heeding notices to appear in court
on behalf of clients. The judge said Washington had left clients
``in the lurch.''
   ``I'm going to go about my work in Congress,'' Washington said
shortly after being sworn in by House Speaker Thomas S. Foley. ``I
think people in my district understand.''
   ``To use an old East Texas expression, it doesn't touch me top,
side or bottom,'' he said.
   Washington was elected to fill the seat left by the death of
Rep. Mickey Leland, a Democrat who chaired the House Select
Committee on Hunger and who died last year in a plane crash during
a trip to Ethiopia.
   ``I can never replace Mickey Leland,'' Washington said. ``I'm
merely his successor.''
   Hearings have been scheduled in Houston for Washington to show
cause why he should not be sent to jail.
   Washington introduced three of his five children to the House
and received a hug in front of his new colleagues from fellow Texas
Democratic Rep. Marvin Leath.
   Asked by reporters about the case that led to the judge's order
on Monday, Washington said: ``I have no idea. You know more about
it than I do.''
   ``I was not aware that this man's case was set for trial
yesterday,'' he said.
   But Barr said in Houston, ``I've done everything I know to get
in touch with Craig, and he's done everything he can to avoid me.
He had ample notice to be in the courtroom today.''
   Washington defended his credentials as a lawyer, saying he was
the Texas state bar's lawyer of the year in 1984 and recounting
some of the cases he won as a defense attorney.
   ``There are many people who think I'm the best lawyer in
Texas,'' he said. ``I enjoy an excellent reputation as a lawyer ...
I am a good lawyer.''
   Washington said his law firm ``is going through a transition,''
because of his election to Congress, and that if some clients were
left temporarily unrepresented it was due to ``glitches.'' He said
all ``will get first-class representation.''
   ``We're going to work our way through this,'' he said. ``The day
will come when all these clients will receive satisfaction with
respect to representation.''

<HEAD>Watergate Residents Want to Block Homeless Shelter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apartment owners in the luxury Watergate
complex are suing the District of Columbia in an effort to block
construction of a homeless shelter across the street.
   The Watergate owners were joined in the lawsuit by other area
residents who want to bar the shelter, which would accommodate 108
homeless people.
   ``Nobody's going to want to live here,'' said Ruby Barnhard, who
was among residents alleging that the shelter would reduce
neighborhood property values.
   Sue Marshall, the homeless coordinator for the District
Department of Human Services, said the arguments against the
shelter were ``reprehensible in the sense that what you're doing is
comparing a human life to your property value.''
   Units at the Watergate, which overlooks the Potomac River near
the Kennedy Center, sell for from $179,000 to nearly $2.7 million,
according to real estate listings.
   The proposed shelter is part of a city effort to provide
overnight shelter for every homeless person who wants it. District
voters approved the measure in a 1984 vote.
   The district has been under a Superior Court order to expand its
shelters since early last year and has been paying daily fines of
$11,500 since Dec. 26 for not providing shelter quickly enough.
   A hearing has been set for Friday on the lawsuit's request for a
preliminary injunction to suspend work on the shelter.
   The Watergate complex includes a hotel and offices.

<HEAD>Some Lawmakers Unsettled Over Study of What Owls Spit Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A state study of owls' diets has
unsettled some lawmakers who are queasy about spending $180,000 to
learn more about the little hairy balls of indigestible bones,
teeth and hair that owls upchuck.
   ``We can't educate kids in our schools, and we've got a person
studying the diets of an owl,'' said Rep. Ted Leverenz, who wants
to cut off funding for the study.
   But researchers said the Department of Conservation study of
what owls eat during different seasons could help show how changes
in the environment affect animals.
   ``We owe it to future generations to preserve as many species as
we can. Without basic information, such as what they eat, it's
rather difficult to do that,'' said Russell Graham, an Illinois
State Museum geologist and bone expert overseeing the study.
   Since the three-year study began in July 1988, researchers have
collected about 3,000 pellets made up of indigestible leftovers of
what the owls ate.
   Graham said the owls' messy habit of spitting up pellets makes
them the ideal bird for the study.
   ``With other birds, you'd have to watch them day and night to
see what they're eating or shoot them and dissect their stomachs,
which is not too conservation-minded,'' he said.
   The pellets have revealed that owls eat rabbits, opossums,
ducks, pheasants, cardinals, shrews, fish and mice and other
rodents.
   Pam Fortado Gibson, field coordinator for the study, said the
information eventually could be used to help farmers reduce their
dependence on pesticides.
   ``We have no knowledge of our natural pest control,'' she said.
``It would help farmers move away from using carcinogenic chemicals
that pollute our streams.''
   But Leverenz has an alternative explanation for the study.
   ``Apparently,'' he said, ``the owl was wiser than we were.''
   The study also drew fire from would-be fiscal watchdogs in state
government.
   ``I've heard of wastes of money, but this one really takes the
cake,'' said Shawn Collins, a candidate for state comptroller. ``I
don't doubt the answers would be useful, but what are your
priorities?''

   Jesse Jackson is neither ruling himself in nor
ruling himself out of the race for mayor of the nation's capital
following Mayor Marion Barry's arrest on a drug charge.
   ``I have no plans to run for mayor,'' Jackson told a meeting of
community activists Tuesday night in his first public appearance
since Barry checked himself in to a Florida rehabilitation center.
   But moments later, Jackson said it would be ``irrational'' to
rule out any political option and then said, ``Public servants,
with all their options, never say never.''
   The crowd of fewer than 100 people that gathered in a downtown
church to hear Jackson press his campaign for statehood for the
District of Columbia greeted him with a standing ovation, but some
said they were not urging him to jump into the mayor's race.
   ``He's doing now what he does best,'' said Aurelia Corbett King.
``He's a national figure. We have local people who have worked in
the trenches, but he has a national appeal that people can
respect.''
   Jackson referred to Barry as ``the hurt player,'' and said,
``you take that player off to the sidelines until that person can
recover, but you don't forfeit the game.''
   Asked how he would respond to those who are urging him to run
for mayor, Jackson replied, ``In this time of crisis, let's not
make premature and hasty judgments, but steady and mature judgments.
   ``The mayor has the time, both for recovery, and the time to
make a judgment about his political future ... that decision will
be made by the mayor and his cabinet.''
   When pressed to rule out a run for mayor, Jackson referred to
the political leverage he gained by winning millions of votes in
Democratic presidential primaries in 1984 and 1988 and said, ``For
me at this stage to declare what level we will not use for our
freedom would be irrational.''
   Ron Richardson, president of the local chapter of the Hotel
Restaurant Workers' Union, is leading a move to draft Jackson and
was at the meeting with community activists.
   He said further meetings of his group would be held later in the
week but that ``we're not ready to go to him (Jackson) yet.''
   ``I think Jackson might get into the race if he felt a
groundswell of support from the voters,'' said Charlene
Drew-Jarvis, a city councilwoman and another declared candidate for
mayor.
   ``I don't think Jackson will do it,'' said David Clarke, city
council chairman and the only white candidate for mayor of the
predominantly black city. Should Barry resign his post, Clarke
would become mayor, pending a special election.
   Also formally in the race are Councilman John Ray and Sharon
Pratt Dixon, a utility company executive and Democratic Party
activist.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, one Jackson intimate
described his wife, Jacqueline, as ``dead set against'' him
entering the race for mayor.
   Another associate, also insisting he not be quoted by name, said
Jackson was ``going over all the options,'' but ``doesn't want to
look opportunistic,'' as if he were ready to jump into the race
within days of Barry's arrest.
   Jackson received 80 percent of the District of Columbia vote in
the 1988 Democratic presidential primary, and early surveys of
voter sentiment in the mayor's race put him far ahead of all other
potential candidates, including Barry.
   The mayor's office issued an appeal from Barry to the news media
Tuesday to stay away from the Hanley-Hazelden treatment center in
West Palm Beach ``for the sake of my privacy and that of others''
at the facility.
   In his statement, Barry said he and his family were undergoing
``a painful ordeal.''

   There's no truth to the rumors that Michael
Jackson's chimpanzee Bubbles has died, Jackson's publicist
announced, and ``when Bubbles heard about his demise he went
bananas.''
   ``Like Mark Twain, his death is grossly exaggerated and he's
alive and doing well,'' publicist Lee Solters said Tuesday.
   A fire in Jackson's Santa Barbara menagerie last month destroyed
a giraffe barn, but the animals were evacuated safely. Jackson's
private zoo includes ostriches, llamas and boa constrictors.

   Kathleen Turner is thrilled to be playing the
sultry Maggie in Tennessee Williams' ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' but
stressed that she doesn't identify with any of the characters she
portrays.
   ``Nah, come on, it's acting, guys. It really truly really is,''
she told reporters Tuesday. ``It's fun to be able to play these
women with all this wonderful power and allure and intelligence I'd
like to add. But it's acting. It's just fun. I'm really not like
that at home.''
   The play began a two-week run Tuesday at Pittsburgh's Benedum
Center. After that, it goes to Boston, Philadelphia and then
Broadway.
   Miss Turner said she always had intended to portray Maggie, a
beautiful Southern woman who pines for a husband who shuns her.
   ``Maggie is so brave,'' she said. ``She changes so fast and
thinks so fast. I like the level of aliveness.''
   Appearing with Miss Turner are Charles Durning, Polly Holliday
and Daniel Hugh Kelly.
   The production is nothing like the 1958 film with Elizabeth
Taylor, Paul Newman and Burl Ives, Miss Turner said.
   Miss Turner, 35, started in theater but movies made her a star.
Her credits include ``Body Heat,'' ``Romancing the Stone,''
``Prizzi's Honor,'' ``Peggy Sue Got Married'' and ``The Accidental
Tourist.''
   She currently appears with Michael Douglas in ``The War of the
Roses.''

   Conductor Mstislav Rostropovich is returning
to his native Soviet Union with a concert tour, but rejected any
notion that he might end 16 years of exile in the West.
   Asked during an interview Tuesday on his feelings about next
month's visit, he replied: ``How would you feel about going to the
planet Mars?''
   Rostropovich, music director of the National Symphony Orchestra,
said he and his wife, soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, were happy
Soviet authorities had decided to restore the citizenship stripped
from them in 1978.
   But Rostropovich is reported to have told friends he cannot
reconcile with the Soviets until they also restore the citizenship
of his close friend, Nobel Prize-winning novelist Alexander
Solzhenitsyn, who lives in Vermont.
   Rostropovich and the National Symphony leave Jan. 29 for a tour
of Japan and the Soviet Union, where they will give four days of
concerts in Moscow and Leningrad.
   The first concert, in the Bolshoi Hall of the Moscow
Conservatory, will feature Tchaikovsky's ``Pathetique'' symphony,
the last work Rostropovich conducted _ and on the same stage _
before he fled to the West in 1974, complaining of harassment and
limits on his artistic freedom.

   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ King Juan Carlos opened a retrospective of
17th-century painter Diego Velazquez that has brought together more
of the Spanish master's works than even his royal patron possessed.
   Juan Carlos on Tuesday toured the 79-piece exhibit that features
20 paintings of his royal ancestors, including Velazquez's patron,
King Philip IV.
   In scope and size, the Prado retrospective dwarfs the exhibit
that drew 550,000 people to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York last year. The one-time Madrid show is to run through March 30.
   Organizers borrowed far and wide to add to the 48 paintings from
the Prado's permanent collection. The most important loans included
``The Rokeby Venus'' from London's National Gallery and ``Portrait
of Juan de Pareja'' from the Metropolitan.

   Rock star David Bowie announced a six-month world
tour and said it would be the last time he sang his smash hits on
stage.
   Publicists will advertise telephone numbers and ballots for fans
to choose the tour's songs _ from hits like ``Young Americans,''
``Rebel Rebel,'' ``Changes,'' ``Suffragette City'' and ``Let's
Dance.''
   ``I won't be doing them ever again,'' Bowie told reporters
Tuesday. ``There's no point continually doing songs and reflecting
on a past.''
   The 42-year-old Bowie, whose real name is David Jones, will
appear in Canada, Britain and Holland in March before going to the
United States, Australia, Japan and the rest of Europe.
   The British-born musician said he will be accompanied by a
four-piece band in simple stage settings but added: ``Knowing me
there will be a fair amount of theatricality about it.''

<HEAD>Most Federal Anti-Drug Aid Doesn't Reach Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only a small portion of federal drug
enforcement aid goes to the nation's cities, says the U.S.
Conference of Mayors, seeking to boost the mayors' call for a
change in the way the government wages its war on drugs.
   The study, being released today, found city governments received
just 15 percent of the $150 million in federal funds available for
drug enforcement through the two main grant programs during the
last fiscal year. That amounted to $22.1 million.
   ``Experience to date has shown that only a small percentage of
federal anti-drug funds has actually reached city governments, and
that it has taken a long time for those funds to arrive,'' said J.
Thomas Cochran, executive director of the conference.
   The report was prepared for mayors gathering in Washington today
for their three-day annual winter meeting.
   President Bush will address the big-city mayors on Friday,
marking the first time in a decade a president has appeared before
the Conference of Mayors while in office. The last was Jimmy Carter
in 1980.
   The mayors _ who are overwhelmingly Democratic _ have long
complained that cities suffered from neglect and cutbacks in
federal aid under President Reagan.
   They have complained since enactment of the federal anti-drug
program in 1986 that the government's war on drugs failed to
provide adequate support directly to cities, where most of the drug
problems are found. Mayors have urged the federal government to
make direct grants to cities rather than providing block grants to
states for distribution.
   Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn, in an interview on the eve of the
conference, said he believed Bush's decision to address the mayors
indicated the administration may be ready to provide more attention
_ and money _ to the cities' problems of drugs, poverty and
homelessness.
   ``I sense this time more a sense of urgency by federal officials
about the condition of the cities, more of a concern,'' Flynn said.
   Flynn said urban leaders will be expecting some help as a result
of the so-called peace dividend _ the anticipated defense savings
resulting from the lessening of world tensions.
   ``It's not in the best political interest of congressional
leaders or White House officials to ignore the messages that have
been coming out of America's cities,'' Flynn said.
   Congressional leaders also will meet with mayors for talks on
homelessness and drugs. One mayor who won't be attending is the
host, Washington Mayor Marion Barry, who entered a Florida
treatment center Monday following his arrest last week on a cocaine
possession charge.
   The conference's study looked at the two grant programs making
drug enforcement money available to state, city and other local
governments.
   Under the formula grants program, which distributed $117.7
million to the 50 states plus Puerto Rico and the District of
Columbia in fiscal 1989, 28 percent or $33.6 million went to state
agencies, the conference reported.
   Another 17 percent, $20.7 million, went to anti-drug efforts
that involved more than one government jurisdiction, and 16
percent, or $19.4 million, went to counties. Fifteen percent, or
$18 million, had not been awarded, and only 12 percent, or $14.4
million, went to cities, the study said.
   The rest, about 12 percent, was retained by the states for
administration, went to confidential awards or was given to other
types of agencies, the conference said. Some of the
multi-jurisdictional money went to cities, but served an area
beyond the city limits and was not counted in the cities' total,
the report said.
   The second program awarded $28.9 million in fiscal 1989 at the
discretion of the federal Bureau of Justice Assistance. According
to the study, 34 percent, or $9.7 million, went to non-governmental
agencies, and 27 percent, or $7.7 million, went to cities. The
remainder went to states, counties, other governments and federal
agencies.

   A federally funded program is dropping a rule
that prevented counties in 10 states from receiving $1.1 million to
feed and shelter the homeless.
   The rule placed a minimum requirement on the size of counties'
urban labor forces, in some situations.
   The decision by the federally funded Emergency Food and Shelter
National Board Program means that 18 counties that were denied
direct assistance are being added to the list of 1990 qualifiers.
   The counties are in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan,
Mississippi, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington.
   The decision was made at a private meeting Friday of the
program's national board, which includes representatives of the
United Way and other charitable groups. It was announced this week
by Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa.
   ``The dark period of uncertainty is over,'' said Kanjorski,
whose home county of Luzerne benefited from the board's decision.
``Full funding for our centers provides a ray of sunshine for the
needy and deserving people who are helped by this program.''
   The seven-year-old program is charged by Congress ``to
supplement and extend ongoing efforts to provide shelter, food and
supportive services'' to the homeless.
   The program has recently come under fire from homeless advocates
for dropping 126 counties that received aid in 1989 to distribute
food, run homeless shelters, assist with mortgages or help the poor
pay energy bills. The counties included 20 with double-digit
unemployment.
   Although Congress did not cut the program, the counties lost out
because they fell below 1990 eligibility levels for poverty,
unemployment or labor force.
   Most still will get aid from so-called ``set-aside'' funds,
although probably not as much as last year. Those funds,
representing 15 percent of the program's $124.9 million budget, are
administered by state boards trying to cushion the blow for
communities denied direct assistance.
   The counties benefiting from the $1.1 million are Lake,
Stephenson and Tazewell in Illinois; Floyd, Howard and La Porte in
Indiana; Clinton in Iowa; Washington in Maryland; Jackson and
Midland in Michigan; Lamar in Mississippi; Middlesex in New Jersey;
Allen, Marion and Licking in Ohio; Delaware and Luzerne in
Pennsylvania; and Thurston in Washington.

<HEAD>Nursing Home Survey Finds Widespread Concern Abuse Goes Unreported</HEAD>

   A government survey of health experts and
advocates for the elderly shows near-unanimous agreement that
physical and emotional abuse is a problem in America's nursing
homes and widespread concern that mistreatment often goes
unreported.
   For each of seven types of abuse, more individuals thought the
situation was worsening than believed it was improving, according
to two draft government reports obtained Tuesday.
   ``While there are no exact statistics on institutional abuse,
any abuse is unacceptable,'' the reports said.
   The costs of abuse ``are measured in the physical and
psychological damage incurred by the resident as well as by the
economic costs of treating the abused resident,'' they said.
   Both reports from the inspector general's office of the
Department of Health and Human Services were based on a survey of
228 people in 35 states who work in state and federal government,
nursing homes and advocacy groups. The reports are in draft form
and subject to revision.
   No state-by-state breakdown was available.
   The reports conclude abuse-reporting systems are inadequate,
follow-up on complaints is ineffective and state and federal
oversight to prevent abuse needs strengthening.
   The reports also recommend the federal government require better
training for nurses aides about aging, suggest ways to cope with
stressful situations and promote more research and education on how
to improve staff stability in nursing homes and control abuse.
   Medical personnel, other patients, families and visitors all
contribute to the problem, but nursing home aides and orderlies are
the biggest abusers, according to the reports.
   The reports said many things contribute to abuse by nursing home
workers, including low staffing levels, high stress, inadequate
training, high turnover, job frustration, belligerent patients, low
wages, lack of empathy for the elderly and increasing numbers of
severely ill residents.
   ``Faced with heavier levels of care, such as residents with more
debilitating diseases, frustrated staff take out their stress on
the residents,'' said one unidentified official who participated in
the survey.
   The report divides abuse into seven categories: physical abuse,
misuse of restraints, verbal or emotional abuse, physical neglect,
medical neglect, verbal or emotional neglect and improper use of a
resident's personal property.
   Ninety-five percent of those surveyed said there were problems
in all seven areas. Thirty percent said physical neglect was the
most prevalent problem; 16 percent said verbal and emotional abuse,
and 14 percent selected verbal and emotional neglect.
   The reports said most research on abuse of the elderly focuses
on family members and caregivers at home, and suggests 1 percent to
10 percent of the non-institutionalized elderly may be abused.
   Although there is less information about abuse in nursing homes,
one 1988 study found 36 percent of surveyed nurses and nurses aides
had seen at least one incident of physical abuse in the preceding
year and 10 percent said they themselves had committed one or more
physically abusive acts.
   The HHS survey found nursing home industry officials often view
the abuse problem as minor, but a significant number of state
oversight agencies and advocates for nursing home residents see the
problem as serious.
   Fifty-one percent of those interviewed believed abuse is only
sometimes or rarely reported by nursing home staff, suggesting many
cases go unreported each year, the reports said.
   The reports said workers may not report abuse because they fear
for their jobs, are loyal to other staff members, fear retaliation,
fines, penalties and bad publicity, lack sufficient facts, and
don't recognize less blatant forms of abuse.
   The survey also found doctors often fail to report abuse, with
66 percent of those interviewed reporting physicians who attend to
patients at nursing homes rarely or never report it.

<HEAD>Ag Department Foresees Barriers to Trade With Soviet Republics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department analyst says it may
be some time before individual republics or business enterprises in
the Soviet Union are able to engage in world trade on their own.
   Moscow's foreign trade organizations, or FTOs, hold centralized
reins over agricultural trade, although economic reforms under
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev are opening other doors such as
joint ventures and FTOs in the republics.
   Abraham Avidor of the department's Foreign Agricultural Service
said despite the announced reforms, the central government
continues to dominate foreign trade and the pricing, procurement,
processing and retailing of food staples.
   ``Trade reforms, particularly the granting of trade rights to
republics and qualified enterprises, have not yet had a major
impact,'' he said. ``In many cases, republics and enterprises do
not have enough exportable world-class products to generate hard
currency sales.''
   Writing in the current issue of AgExporter magazine, Avidor said
the republics and enterprises also lack trading experience and are
subject to export licensing aimed at assuring sufficient domestic
supplies.
   ``Because of the limited impact of trade reforms, the central
government remains the only major purchaser of U.S. agricultural
commodities,'' he said.
   On the other hand, U.S. agricultural exporters have few problems
with Soviet tariffs. Although a tariff schedule is maintained, it
serves mostly as an accounting system to keep track of foreign
trade.
   The largest Soviet barrier to greater trade with the West is a
shortage of hard currency, the ruble's lack of convertibility, and
government dominance over trade, Avidor said.
   American farmers have benefited from large grain sales to the
Soviet Union since the early 1970s, particularly since 1976 when
regular purchases were first specified in a long-term agreement
between the two countries.
   But Avidor said the underlying goal of Moscow is to reach food
self-sufficiency and that large imports ``continue to be viewed as
temporary'' necessities.''
   ``Recent reforms have focused on increasing food supplies,
rather than on controlling (consumer) demand,'' he said. ``Steps
have been taken to decentralize decison-making in agriculture,
allowing more self-management by republics, enterprises and
individuals.''

   Snow in the nation's breadbasket is raising
prospects for the 1990 winter wheat crop, according to the
government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility.
   The facility is operated by the Commerce and Agriculture
Departments and reported Tuesday on crop and weather conditions for
the week of Jan. 14-20.
   ``Precipitation fell in the Great Plains from Texas to central
Nebraska, providing much-needed snow cover and moisture to the
winter wheat crop,'' the report said. ``The moderate temperatures
and moisture were beneficial to livestock producers as they helped
pastures.''
   However, the report added wheat farmers and fruit growers were
``concerned that the warm weather will start growth too soon,
leaving these crops more vulnerable to a hard freeze later on.''
   The report said the heavy, wet snow in the plains was the first
moisture of the season for many stressed dryland fields of wheat.
   ``Livestock was responding favorably to above-normal
temperatures,'' the report said. ``Texas ranges and pastures were
showing some signs of improvement as mild weather and moisture
returned to most areas.''
   Pastures in Oklahoma were greening, although heavier
supplemental feeding of livestock was necessary in areas of the
central plains because of snow cover.
   ``Lambing and calving activity was increasing in Michigan and
Idaho,'' the report said. ``Florida pastures were mostly
fair-to-good in the panhandle and northern peninsula, and fair in
the southern areas.''

   Preliminary estimates by the Agriculture
Department show last year's crop production was worth about $77
billion, up 10 percent from 1988.
   Corn output in 1989 topped all crops in value with a total of
more than $17 billion, up from $12.7 billion in 1988, the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board said Tuesday.
   The annual crop values are based on estimated production and
prices during a crop's marketing year. The corn marketing year, for
example, runs from Sept. 1 through the following August.
   Also, the preliminary dollar estimates represent the value of a
crop, whether all is sold or partly used by producers. The figures
are used mainly as comparisons from year to year and do not
represent cash sales by farmers.
   Other leading crop values for 1989 included:
   Hay, baled, $11.8 billion; soybeans, $10.6 billion; wheat, $7.7
billion; cotton, $4 billion; tobacco, $2.4 billion; oranges, $1.8
billion; grapes, $1.7 billion; sorghum, $1.3 billion; and apples,
$1 billion.

   Two environmental groups contend a watchdog
agency created by Congress to oversee nuclear weapons plants is
operating in illegal secrecy.
   The chairman of the agency, the Defense Nuclear Facilities
Safety Board, denied the allegation Tuesday, while a House panel
chairman said he had urged the board to clarify its rules on public
participation.
   The allegations were leveled by two environmental groups, the
Natural Resources Defense Council and the Energy Research
Foundation, which regularly press the Energy Department to be more
open about operations of its nuclear arms plants.
   The environmental groups announced they will sue the board if it
does not open its meetings to the public and release records of its
meetings by Feb. 14.
   The board, created by Congress in 1988, began operating Oct. 25.
   Dan W. Reicher, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said the watchdog agency was violating the 1976 Sunshine
Act requiring executive branch agencies to hold meetings in public,
and the Freedom of Information Act, which requires agencies to
publish rules on public access to their records.
   ``The board is perpetuating the culture of secrecy it was
supposed to eradicate at the Energy Department,'' Reicher said.
   John Conway, chairman of the five-member board, said in a
telephone interview, ``I don't believe we've violated any federal
laws.''
   He acknowledged that some of the board's meetings were not open
to the public, adding that ``we meet every day, we're a full-time
board and we work every day.''
   It would be impractical, Conway said, to issue advance notice of
daily meetings and that some discussions would have to be closed to
the public because they include classified material.
   Conway said no one had asked to attend the board meetings or to
review its records.
   Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., chairman of a special House panel
reviewing the nuclear weapons complex, said Conway assured him
Tuesday that he was committed to running the watchdog board ``in as
open and public a way as possible.''
   Spratt said Conway had encountered numerous bureaucratic
obstacles to organizing the board's work, in part because of staff
hiring problems.
   ``In the short term, I'm sympathetic to his plight,'' Spratt
said, adding that he urged Conway to move quickly to clarify the
board's rules on open meetings and public access to records.
   The board was established by Congress in response to growing
indications that the Energy Department had hidden or failed to
uncover many environmental, safety and health problems at the arms
facilities.

<HEAD>Webster Foresees Big Jump in US Dependence on Gulf Oil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private energy analysts agree with a new CIA
forecast of a 2{-fold increase in U.S. dependence on oil imports
from the Persian Gulf, but they say the increases may be more
gradual than the spy agency predicts.
   William Webster, director of the Central Intelligence Agency,
told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that U.S.
reliance on Persian Gulf oil will more than double in the coming
few years.
   ``Western dependence on Persian Gulf oil will rise
dramatically'' in the next few years, Webster said, adding the Gulf
share of U.S. oil supplies would rise from 10 percent in 1989 to
``roughly 25 percent'' in a few years. He did not mention a precise
time period and did not elaborate on the import issue.
   President Bush contends more reliance on the Persian Gulf will
undermine U.S. national security because of the risk of a supply
interruption. This argument, disputed by many environmentalists and
members of Congress, is central to the administration's efforts to
open more federal lands and waters to oil exploration.
   John Lichtblau, executive director of the Petroleum Industry
Research Foundation in New York, said in an interview that
Webster's forecast was reasonable if he was projecting to 1995. He
said ``it's a little bit exaggerated'' if Webster meant the rise to
25 percent would occur in two or three years.
   Lichtblau said his organization was projecting Persian Gulf oil
will account for between 22 and 23 percent of U.S. supplies by
1995. He and other analysts tie the increase to growing U.S. oil
consumption, continuing declines in U.S. oil production and
declining exports by non-Gulf oil exporters such as Britain.
   Total U.S. oil imports last year rose to 7.9 million barrels a
day. That was a 10-year high and meant 46 percent of U.S. oil
supplies came from foreign sources, according to the American
Petroleum Institute, an industry trade association.
   Dillard Spriggs, president of the consulting firm Petroleum
Analysis Ltd. in New York, said ``in five years' time it's quite
likely'' that the United States will be getting one-quarter of its
oil from the Persian Gulf, but not before then.
   ``That's where it's got to come from,'' he said, since no major
new oil fields are scheduled to come into production outside the
Gulf in the next few years.
   The Energy Department's forecasting office does not publish
projections of U.S. dependence on oil from specific regions of the
world, said W. Calvin Kilgore, who directs the office. But Kilgore
said he foresees ``at least a doubling'' of U.S. reliance on the
Persian Gulf over the next five years.

   A wide range of bills newly introduced in
Congress would cut Social Security taxes, free billions of dollars
for the nation's highways and cash in on the thaw in East-West
relations by cutting Pentagon programs.
   Many of the bills introduced as lawmakers returned to work

red ink.
   Also introduced were bills that would raise the Environmental
Protection Agency to Cabinet status and allow women to serve in
combat.
   The largest political storm has already formed over Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan's proposal to cut Social Security taxes. Moynihan
was derided by the White House earlier this month when he announced
the plan, which he formally introduced Tuesday.
   He would roll back Social Security payroll tax rate from the
7.65 percent it reached Jan. 1 to the previous 7.51 percent. That
would save workers $7 billion this year and $55 billion in fiscal
1991.
   ``We must end the shameful practice of using Social Security
revenues to finance budget deficits,'' said Moynihan, D-N.Y. The
surplus in Social Security reserves is counted in the budget,
making the deficit appear smaller than it actually is.
   The surpluses are the result of efforts to build up reserves for
the Baby Boom generation when it ages and will dwindle after the
turn of the century.
   But the Bush administration calls the move part of a Democratic
plot to raise other taxes.
   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., meanwhile, rolled various tax
proposals _ including his perennial call for a national sales tax _
into a Tax Reform and Competiveness Act.
   The legislation embraces some of President Bush's proposal to
lower the capital gains tax and includes Moynihan's Social Security
proposal and a plan by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, to restore the
tax deduction for Individual Retirement Accounts.
   This is the fifth straight year Hollings has introduced
legislation for a value added tax, as the sales tax is known.
   On another budget front, Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., introduced
legislation he said would release more than $10.5 billion in
highway money being held in the federal Highway Trust Fund.
   The money represents the accumulated difference between revenues
_ larely from the 9-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax _ and federal
highway authorizations. Critics say the money is deliberately
underspent to keep the deficit low and provide a cheap source for
government borrowing.
   ``Over the last decade the federal government has used the money
collected by the federal gas tax as a deficit-reduction gimmick,''
Bryan said.
   Legislation to elevate the Environmental Protection Agency to
Cabinet level status was introduced in the House and Senate, with
supporters saying they hoped a bill could clear Congress within
several months.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Government
Operations Committee, said the EPA needs more clout and higher
visibility because of the importance of environmental issues in the
next decade.
   Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Alan Cranston, D-Calif., moved
to translate changes in the Soviet Bloc into less military
spending, introducing legislation to cancel the B-1 stealth bomber
program after the 15 bombers now in production are built.
   ``Recent events have made the argument against the B-2 even
stronger,'' said Leahy. He said taxpayers would save $40 billion as
a result.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., introduced a bill she has been
touting since the U.S. invasion of Panama last month that would
remove existing prohibitions on women serving in combat.
   Cranston, under investigation for his role in the scandal over
the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan, introduced legislation that
would allow the 23,000 holders of worthless junk bonds sold through
Lincoln to sue federal regulators for approving the sale.
   Cranston is one of five senators under an ethics inquiry for
receiving contributions from Lincoln owner Charles Keating Jr. and
intervening with federal regulators on Keating's behalf.
   A bill introduced by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., would bar
senators from taking honoraria and limit outside earned income to
15 percent of salary. The measure would bring Senate rules in line
with those approved by the House last year.
   Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and Gordon J. Humphrey, R-N.H.,
introduced a proposed constitutional amendment that would limit
senators and members of the House to 12 years in office. Humphrey
said the amendment would ``go a long way toward restoring a truly
representative Congress.''
   In other legislation Tuesday:
   _Reps. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., and Joseph Brennan, D-Maine,
introduced separate bills to raise low-income energy assistance
subsidies after a cold snap and low inventories sent heating oil
costs skyrocketing 50 percent last month.
   _Banks and thrifts that launder drug money would lose their
charters under a bill introduced by Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill,
chairman of the House Banking financial institutions subcommittee.
   _And Rep. James Trafficant, D-Ohio, introduced a bill to repeal
the 1985 Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, calling the law ``that
turkey that should be shot down.''

   Rapid changes in Eastern Europe have reduced
the Soviet threat and could lead to the disintegration of the
military agreement among the Warsaw Pact nations by the mid-1990s,
say Bush administration officials.
   ``There can be no doubt ... that the conventional military
threat in Central Europe has declined,'' Central Intelligence
Agency Director William H. Webster told the Senate Armed Services
Committee Tuesday.
   The sessions, the panel's first in a series of hearings on the
Soviet threat to the West, will serve as a basis for the
committee's crafting of a defense budget for the fiscal year that
begins Oct. 1.
   The ties between the Eastern bloc nations and Moscow have been
radically altered in the push toward democracy, and the Kremlin can
no longer count on those countries to respond automatically to its
military orders.
   In addition, the Soviet Union has been keeping pace with
President Mikhail Gorbachev's December 1988 plan to reduce troop
levels in Eastern Europe while the Soviets' economic problems have
demanded more money normally earmarked for defense.
   ``Soviet and Warsaw Pact strength and capabilities have
declined,'' Webster said. ``The reductions probably lengthen the
time it would take for the Soviets to mobilize for any large-scale
attack in Europe.''
   Despite the diminished threat, the CIA director said the Soviet
Union is still modernizing its strategic forces. That, combined
with the threats from terrorism, illegal drugs, uncertainty in
Latin America, Asia and the Middle East and weapons proliferation,
highlights the importance of maintaining a strong U.S. intelligence
capability.
   The comments appeared to be a plea to head off budget cuts for
the CIA and other intelligence agencies, whose operations are
hidden in the Defense Department budget. Although the exact figures
are secret, U.S. intelligence reportedly spends $25 billion to $30
billion a year, just less than 10 percent of the defense budget.
   The director of the Defense Intelligence Agency told the panel
he believes the push for freedom in Eastern Europe ``will likely
lead to the phase out of the (Warsaw) Pact's collective military
security role'' by the middle of the decade.
   Lt. Gen. Harry Soyster said a new type of security agreement
between the Eastern bloc nations could emerge.
   ``The rapid turn of events in Eastern Europe may accelerate the
removal of Soviet forces and may speed the evolution toward such a
new security order,'' Soyster told the committee.
   Soyster said he believed the Soviet Union would view a
large-scale offensive against the NATO countries with only their
own forces as ``highly risky, if not impractical.''
   Both Webster and Soyster expressed concerns over the new and
more sophisticated threats, such as nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons in the hands of nations that support terrorism.
   ``By the year 2000, at least six countries probably will have
missiles with ranges up to 3,000 miles,'' Webster said.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ In a widening crackdown to silence
political foes, Haiti's military rulers have arrested a leading
business figure and ordered radio and television stations to
broadcast only the news they approve.
   Also Tuesday, the general heading the interior and defense
ministries defended the weekend expulsion of four prominent
politicians as retribution for their ``insulting the head of
state,'' Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.
   An Information Ministry statement told broadcasters that it must
approve their local news reports, and ordered them to ``refrain
from relaying or broadcasting any information on Haiti from
stations broadcasting'' from abroad.
   In recent days, stations have relayed statements by exiled
opposition leaders broadcast by Radio France Internationale and the
Voice of America.
   Stations also were told not to broadcast anything ``likely to
incite agitation.''
   Radio is the main source of information in this impoverished
Caribbean nation, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the
Dominican Republic. Haiti has two TV stations, one government-owned
and the other in private hands.
   Police were reported to have raided three independent radio
stations on Monday. With the exception of a 6 a.m. newscast by a
Protestant station, none of the dozen independent radio stations in
Port-au-Prince broadcast local news Tuesday, but official Radio
Nationale did.
   Newspapers were not affected by the ministry directive, but few
Haitians read them.
   Interior and Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Fritz Romulus said on
government television Tuesday night that the political leaders
expelled and militants beaten and arrested over the weekend
``maintained a climate of tension ... and poisoned the atmosphere.''
   Relatives said police on Tuesday arrested Antoine Izmery, 45,
one of Haiti's main importers and a vocal critic of the government
of President Avril, telling him he would be forced into exile.
   Izmery was arrested while driving to work. Police searched his
downtown warehouse and went to his home for his passport, his wife
said.
   The government declared a 30-day state of siege and beat and
arrested dozens of militants and prominent politicians on Saturday,
a day after unidentified assailants killed an army colonel, his
wife and a servant.
   Most of those arrested are believed to have been released.
   Critics accused Avril of staging the killing of Col. Andre
Neptune and using it as a pretext to clamp down on the opposition
and renege on his promise to hold free elections in October.
   Romulus justified the arrests and expulsions of conservative
leader Hubert de Ronceray; Dr. Louis Roy, co-author of the
constitution; Communist Party deputy leader Max Bourjolly and
leftist militant Abby Brun, saying they ``got into the habit of
insulting the head of state.''
   All had denounced what they called human rights abuses by
Avril's government and demanded he resign.
   Romulus said those exiled could return in time for October
presidential elections but did not specify a date or say if they
would be allowed to campaign.
   Asked by the government TV news director, Judith Brossard, to
comment on the ``rumor'' of police brutality, Romulus said he had
not seen any. ``But, the president had told arresting officers to
treat everyone correctly.''
   He said once the police had ``terrorism'' under control, the
government would lift the state of siege. The United States, France
and Canada have condemned the government action.
   Avril gained power in September 1988 when a soldiers' rebellion
ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who took over after a popular
uprising forced dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier to flee to France in
February 1986.
   The last time Haiti attempted free elections, in November 1987,
armed thugs in collusion with government troops shot or hacked to
death at least 34 voters and the balloting was canceled.

<HEAD>Dodd Proposes Ban on Honoraria With No Senate Pay Raise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd is setting the stage for
another politically touchy debate over honoraria by proposing
banning the speaking fees without giving senators a raise to
compensate for the lost income.
   The Connecticut Democrat introduced the legislation Tuesday. It
would apply only to the Senate, which decided last year to continue
accepting honoraria in the immediate future.
   The House voted to ban the fees next Jan. 1 in return for a
large raise. Dodd's bill would ban Senate honoraria on the same
date.
   Because the Senate took a smaller pay raise than the House,
passage of Dodd's legislation would leave senators earning
significantly less than members of the House.
   Lawmakers are not eager to fight another pay or honoraria battle
in an election year, especially since they approved salary
increases and ethics reforms late last year. But Dodd, unhappy with
the continuation of Senate honoraria, said he won't let the matter
rest.
   ``When the doors closed on the first session of the 101st
Congress, the Senate found itself in the bizarre position of being
the only place in the federal government where the receipt of
honoraria was still legal,'' Dodd said in a floor speech.
   Dodd said he preferred coupling the honoraria ban with a pay
raise but added, ``Absent the political will to vote a pay raise
... the integrity of this institution remains threatened by the
continued receipt of honoraria.''
   Dodd stopped accepting honoraria in February 1989.
   Dodd did not include any pay raise in his legislation, and the
Senate would be unlikely to attach a pay component to the
legislation in an election year.
   However, the Senate could pass the honoraria ban now, and vote
itself a post-election raise next year in time to avoid a net loss
in pay.
   Congressional watchdog groups such as Common Cause and Public
Citizen have strongly urged a ban on honoraria, saying the money
comes mostly from special interest groups trying to influence
lawmakers.
   Public Citizen said Tuesday that it surveyed senators and found
43 supporting an honoraria ban, 31 undecided and 11 who opposed the
prohibition. Fifteen did not respond.
   Pay for senators is scheduled to increase to $98,400 a year next
month, while the House salaries would increase to $96,600 at the
same time.
   In 1991, House members will earn nearly $125,000, without
speaking fees. Senators would earn about $101,400 with an
additional $23,568 in honoraria permitted.
   In addition to banning honoraria next January, the Dodd bill
would limit outside earned income to 15 percent of a senator's
salary. The measure would allow senators to make speeches and send
up to $2,000 per speech to a charitable organization.

<HEAD>Self-Esteem is Keen, California Task Force Reports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state task force that's been
lampooned as an emporium of New Age buzzwords completed its
three-year mission with a report enshrining self-esteem as a
``social vaccine'' that ``empowers us to live responsibly.''
   Much of the rest of the country may be snickering, but 42 of
California's 58 counties, including conservative rural ones,
already have formed local self-esteem teams.
   In its 144-page final report issued Tuesday, the California Task
Force to Promote Self-Esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility
recommended more parenting courses, smaller school classes and
pro-family worksite policies.
   When the task force was created with the blessing of Republican
Gov. George Deukmejian, it was met with scorn. Cartoonist Garry
Trudeau poked fun in ``Doonesbury,'' having his bubble-headed
character Boopsie named to the task force, which she called ``the
first official study of New Age thinking.''
   The 24 task force members ``have brought the matter of
self-esteem from a matter of ridicule to a subject of respect,''
said Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, the Democrat who sponsored the
bill creating the group.
   Twenty-three of the members signed the report. The 24th, David
Shannahoff-Khalsa, called it ``incredibly superficial and naive.''
   ``Self-esteem cannot be administered, injected, nor given to any
one,'' he said in a telephone interview from his Del Mar home.
``This elusive term ... is being promoted as a universal remedy for
a society that is becoming increasingly complex and disfunctional.''
   The report compared self-esteem to a ``social vaccine, something
that empowers us to live responsibly and that inoculates us against
the lures of crime, violence, substance abuse, teen pregnancy,
child abuse, chronic welfare dependency and educational failure.''
   But Shannahoff-Khalsa, a consultant to the National Research
Council, said the commission did not address the subconscious mind
adequately.
   ``Without probing the depths, one will never reach the
heights,'' he said.
   At a March 1988 hearing, the first of nine, the $750,000 task
force heard San Jose high school principal Ruben Trinidad testify:
``I love you, I really do.''
   Another principal, Arvil Clark, said: ``I'm not sure I love all
of you, but I'm sure I could like most of you.''
   The hearings drew testimony by small-business owners in the
timber-fishing town of Eureka near the Oregon line, AIDS patients
in San Francisco, and masked members of rival street gangs in Los
Angeles.
   Vasconcellos has said he created the task force because, as
chairman of the budget-writing Ways and Means Committee, he saw
much of the state's budget going to repair Californians with
problems such as violence, drug and alcohol abuse, teen-age
pregnancy, child abuse, welfare dependence and school failure.
   The task force's job was to research whether lack of self-esteem
contributes to those problems and, if so, recommend ways society
can improve individuals' self-esteem.
   Vasconcellos said he plans to send Trudeau a copy of the report.
Trudeau, he said, satirizes things that are important, and his
cartoon ``elevated the task force from an obscure California
venture to one everyone knew about.''
   The task force defined self-esteem as ``appreciating my own
worth and importance and having the character to be accountable for
myself and to act responsibly toward others.''
   It concluded that ``the family is the incubator of self-esteem''
and that ``the parent's high self-esteem is vital to his or her
ability to provide a health environment for the child.''
   Vasconcellos said he did not know how much it would cost to put
the recommendations into practice. He acknowledged that some, such
as increased child care, would be expensive.
   According to the 1986 bill that created the commission, the
state's 2 million adult alcoholics and its $3 billion illicit drug
trade cost the state millions of dollars in medical expenses, lost
productivity, law enforcement and corrections.

<HEAD>Pentagon: Noriega Guest House Cache `Not Cocaine'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon says its military officers
probably shouldn't have made claims during the Panama invasion that
a large cache of cocaine was found in a guest house frequented by
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``You have to do lab tests on things to be 100 percent sure,''
said Defense Department spokesman Bob Hall.
   The spokesman acknowledged Tuesday the substance was not cocaine
and tests on the material were made after the find was touted by
U.S. military officers. Gen. Maxwell Thurman, the commander of the
Panama-based Southern Command, had pointed to the alleged drug find
as evidence of Noriega's alleged connections to narcotics.
   Pentagon officials were left trying to explain on Tuesday
exactly what the powdery substance found wrapped in banana leaves
was.
   One report said the substance may have been tamales, but the
military says that's not so.
   Hall said he could not identify it with any certainty, saying
he'd been supplied with ``less than satisfactory'' information by
U.S. military officials in Panama.
   ``We said that our soldiers found some white powder wrapped in
banana leaves in a refrigerator,'' Capt. Art Haubold of the
Southern Command's public affairs office said in Panama. ``The
substance was taken to a lab and it was determined after that is
was not cocaine.
   ``The best they could determine was that it was some bonding
substance used in voodoo rituals. That's the way it was described
to us by Army experts. At first, it could have been mistaken by a
layman as cocaine.''
   Hall said U.S. officials were trying to get more information on
the matter. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that the find
amounted to tamales used in voodoo ceremonies.
   Shortly after the invasion, Thurman said 50 kilos, or more than
100 pounds, of cocaine was found. Thurman was quoted in a Dec. 23
New York Times article as saying the cocaine indicated Noriega
``condones or uses the stuff himself.''
   Hall said Tuesday that ``clearly the guys who first saw this
stuff did not know what cocaine was. When the experts checked, they
said it wasn't.''
   Hall said he didn't know when it was determined that the cache
was not cocaine. ``In retrospect, probably you shouldn't be
announcing something. ... You need to be very careful, obviously,''
he said.
   Hall said he could not provide any details about any other drugs
that might have been found during the invasion because of ``legal
implications.''
   The day after the invasion, reporters were shown a so-called
``witch house'' that supposedly had been frequented by Noriega.
Col. Mike Snell, the officer in charge of the area, said some 50
pounds of cocaine and voodoo paraphernalia were found there.
   Noriega is awaiting trial in Miami on federal drug-trafficking
and racketeering charges.
   Panamanian tamales are generally wrapped in banana leaves and
are made cornmeal and chicken meat in the capital and with pork in
the provinces.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Consider How to Aid Romania</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers say they are thinking of how to help
Romania after the disastrous reign of Nicolae Ceausescu but have
yet to provide specific ways of improving trade or providing more
money.
   The members of Congress spoke in light of complaints by members
of Romania's provisional government that the United States has done
too little to help the emerging country.
   ``Many in Bucharest are disappointed by the slow, modest and
cautious reaction to the Romanian events,'' Silviu Brucan, a member
of the provisional government that replaced Ceausescu, told The New
York Times in Bucharest in an interview published Tuesday.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were executed on Christmas Day by
the provisional government.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler on Tuesday denied
the Bush administration is dragging its feet on Romania. Instead,
officials are ``looking for ways to be supportive,'' she said.
   ``I'm interested in helping Romania,'' said Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., who called the country a ``basket-case''
after the Ceausescu regime.
   Asked in an interview if he would propose additional aid for
Romania, Dole said it would be difficult to find much money when
foreign aid resources are stretched thin.
   The United States has sent about $750,000 in emergency aid to
Romania, most of it medical supplies, since Ceausescu was
overthrown.
   Last year, Romania received virtually no U.S. assistance,
according to John Metelsky of the Agence for International
Development. That compared to the special $400 million that
Congress provided Poland and Hungary in the waning days of the 1989
legislative session.
   Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., has urged the Bush administration to
move cautiously in providing trade benefits, known as most favored
nation status, to Romania.
   ``Please do not grant MFN until free, fair, open and verifiable
elections are held,'' Wolf wrote in a letter to President Bush.
Wolf, who has long been interested in Romania, visited the country
this month.
   Ceausescu withdrew his country's favored trade status two years
ago in the face of congressional opposition. Since then, trade
between the two countries has dropped to virtually nothing.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who was a leader in the drive to
revoke Romania's favored trade status, would like to see its trade
with the United States improve, but he hasn't introduced any
legislation, according to his spokesman, Jason Isaacson.
   Tutwiler said the department would have to consult with Congress
before any change is made in Romania's trading status.
   But she said the provisional government's ``steps towards
freedom of travel and immigration as well as movement toward a
pluralistic, multi-party democracy will obviously be relevant to
our conversation of a waiver.''

<HEAD>Angolan Leader Cancels Plans for US Visit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Angola's leftist president is canceling a
long-planned private visit to the United States in which he had
hoped to shift American support away from Angola's U.S.-backed
anti-communist rebel movement.
   President Eduardo dos Santos had been invited by 36 members of
Congress to visit Washington early next month, and his sudden
cancellation Tuesday touched off conflicting explanations of his
motives.
   The cancellation was disclosed by Randall Robinson, head of a
private group with close ties to the Angola government. He said dos
Santos decided not to go ahead with the visit because of Bush
administration pressure.
   The State Department denied the allegation, saying, ``The
administration has not placed any obstacles in the way of his
visit.''
   The administration has accused the Angolans of disregarding
efforts to achieve peace by launching a major offensive a month
ago. Robinson blamed the UNITA rebels for the upsurge in the
fighting but said the government is now prepared to call off the
hostilities.
   UNITA Vice President Jeremias Chitunda said in an interview
Tuesday that the fighting has claimed the lives of more than 300
government soldiers and 62 rebel troops.
   Word of the cancellation followed a meeting of the top Angolan
leadership, which reaffirmed in a communique Monday its commitment
to maintaining a one-party Marxist state. The statement contained
no change in the government's longstanding opposition to direct
negotiations with the rebels.
   The hard-line tone of the communique triggered speculation in
UNITA circles that dos Santos canceled the visit because he did not
have authorization to make peace concessions.
   The United States has no diplomatic relations with Angola but
administration officials were willing to meet with dos Santos
during the February visit if he agreed to certain conditions. These
reportedly included signing a cease-fire with the UNITA rebels and
a pledge to enter into direct negotiations with the insurgents.
   Recently, dos Santos invited the State Department's top African
affairs diplomat, Herman Cohen, to visit the Angolan capital of
Luanda. Cohen was due to arrive there tonight for a 24-hour stay.
   The invitation sparked speculation that dos Santos might be
prepared to offer a peace proposal, possibly including a cease-fire.
   Angola's principal representative in the United States, U.N.
Ambassador Manuel P. Pacavira, was in Washington on Tuesday but was
unavailable for comment on the cancellation.
   But Robinson, who heads a group called TransAfrica, contended
the administration opposed the visit because it was fearful of the
public debate that would be generated about the $50 million in
military assistance the United States reportedly gives to the UNITA
rebels each year.
   ``Denying Americans an opportunity to hear other side is a very
bad reflection on this country,'' Robinson told The Associated
Press.
   The Angola conflict has raged for years, with Soviet weapons
used by the MPLA government arrayed against the arms provided to
the rebels by the United States. According to U.S. estimates, the
Soviets send more than 10 times as much to the government forces as
the United States sends to the rebels.
   The conflict is one of several examples of superpower
competition that have survived the winding down of the Cold War.
   Robinson said dos Santos had planned to attend a dinner in his
honor at the home of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and to visit
with the widow of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King.

<HEAD>Stocks Plunge, Dollar Also Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plunged
Wednesday, while the dollar fell against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 145.80 yen, down 0.53 yen from Tuesday's
146.33-yen finish. The currency opened at 145.88 yen and ranged
between 145.65-146.06 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 599.04 points, or 1.60
percent, ending at 36,778.98. It had gained 121.01 points Tuesday.
   The index's plunge came as arbitrageurs sold stocks in an
attempt to widen the price spread between stocks and stock futures,
said Kozo Hasunuma, a dealer with Yamaichi Securities Co.
   ``While there were massive sales by arbitrageurs, institutional
investors remained on the sidelines, resulting in very little
buying,'' he said.
   Japanese investors were largely discouraged by expectations of
further weakness on the New York stock market, Hasunuma said.
Despite a 14.87-point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on
Tuesday, Japanese investors still think the New York market looks
weak, he said.
   In currency dealings, traders attributed the dollar's weakness
to its downswing in New York overnight. Reports that unrest was
subsiding in the southern Soviet republic of Azerbaijan halted the
dollar's advance and rekindled buying of West German marks, they
said.

<HEAD>Freed: Brandley Released After 10 Years on Death Row</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After nearly a decade on Death Row, Clarence Lee
Brandley used his first day of freedom to go to the church where
his family and friends had held regular vigils for his release.
   Amid applause and shouts of ``Thank you, Jesus'' from
supporters, the soft-spoken Brandley emerged from the Creston
Baptist Church in northeast Houston late Tuesday after praying with
his family and church leaders.
   ``I just recall the words of Martin Luther King: `Free at last.
Free at last. Thank God Almighty ... free at last,''' said the Rev.
Ozell Brandley, who cheered his brother's release along with
neighbors of the small church.
   Brandley, 38, who once came within five days of execution, was
released on a $75,000 bond Tuesday, a month after the Texas Court
of Criminal Appeals threw out his capital murder conviction for the
1980 rape-slaying of a 16-year-old girl. The court issued its final
mandate Monday, confirming that Brandley did not receive a fair
trial.
   ``We prayed for him continually,'' said Margaret Clark,
Brandley's sister. ``This is where we prayed for him every Sunday
and Wednesday and sometimes Tuesdays.''
   Brandley said little except that he was happy to be off Death
Row. He said he would spend time with his mother and four children
and move anywhere except Montgomery County, where he was convicted.
   ``It's a great feeling just walking outside the gate, knowing
I'm standing on some grass _ not concrete _ and no non-stop
handcuffs,'' Brandley said as he left the Huntsville prison where
he was incarcerated for more than nine years.
   ``I was doubtful this day would ever come.''
   At the church, Brandley bowed his head and exclaimed ``Amen!''
as the Rev. Leroy Ross thanked God, saying, ``You have indeed freed
an innocent man from execution and after nine and a half years of
being on Death Row.''
   Montgomery County District Attorney Peter Speers said he will
ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case, but wouldn't seek
another trial if the high court refused.
   Speers said he still believes Brandley is guilty of the murder
of Cheryl Dee Fergeson, slain while attending a volleyball
tournament at the Houston-area high school where Brandley worked as
a janitor.
   Brandley's first trial ended in a hung jury, and an all-white
jury convicted him of capital murder in his second trial.
   A third trial would be virtually impossible because of the time
that has elapsed, lost evidence and corrupted witnesses, Speers
said.
   Brandley's attorneys have claimed their client was the victim of
racism. Brandley is black and Miss Fergeson was white.
   ``As much as we'd like to think this is the 1980s or 1990s and
racial prejudices are behind us, race was a major factor in the
prosecution and the investigation,'' said defense attorney Paul
Nugent.
   In 1987, a judge recommended a third trial because the two
others had been discriminatory. On Dec. 13, the state's high court
agreed, saying the investigation ``lacked the rudiments of
fairness.''
   Evidence revealed during the 1987 hearing showed contradictory
testimony from other janitors _ all of whom were white.
   Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox said he would not join Speers
in seeking the U.S. Supreme Court ruling because the original trial
was ``racially tainted.''
   C.L. ``Buck'' Fergeson, the slain girl's father, said he was
upset that Brandley was free. ``I'm still convinced he's guilty,
and I hope Speers is going to do everything he can to rectify the
situation.''
   The janitor who found Miss Fergeson's body, Henry Peace, was
charged with sexually assaulting two girls last year, authorities
said. Peace, who was a co-worker of Brandley's at Conroe High
School, was arrested Friday, said O.J. Stewart, sheriff in nearby
Liberty County.
   Prosecutors said there is no evidence linking Peace to Miss
Fergeson's slaying.
   Peace testified in the Brandley case, but gave conflicting
testimony during several court hearings.

<HEAD>Troops Patrol Rangoon After Scattered Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armed troops, some with drawn bayonets,
patrolled downtown Rangoon today following two days of scattered
demonstrations in support of detained opposition leader Aung San
Suu Kyi, Western diplomats said.
   The diplomats in Rangoon said several hundred chanting
protesters gathered near City Hall on Monday, anticipating a final
ruling on whether Ms. Suu Kyi would be allowed to run in May 27
parliamentary elections.
   One diplomat said he had reports of another small demonstration
in Rangoon Tuesday evening.
   Ms. Suu Kyi, running for a seat from a Rangoon district, was
disqualified by a branch of the military government's Election
Commission last week. Her party has appealed the decision to the
commission's central body.
   Ms. Suu Kyi is he general secretary of the largest and most
popular opposition party, the National League for Democracy. She
has been under house arrest since July.
   The May election is to be Burma's first multiparty vote since
1960 but government critics have expressed doubts about just how
free it will be.
   Western governments and Japan have condemned recent moves to bar
opposition figures from the election.
   Last month, the co-leader of Ms. Suu Kyi's party, Tin Oo, was
sentenced to three years in prison on charges of subversion. U Nu,
the last democratically elected prime minister, was put under house
arrest and barred from the elections. Diplomats say thousands of
other dissidents have been detained.
   Millions of Burmese took to the streets in 1988 demanding an end
to authoritarian rule. But the mass protests ended that September
as the present government seized power, its troops killing hundreds
of people.
   The Western diplomats in Rangoon, reached by telephone and
speaking on condition of anonymity, said there were no violent
incidents in the demonstration near City Hall but cited reports
that at least 20 of the protesters were arrested on Tuesday.
   The building houses Election Commission offices.
   The mostly student protesters and some Buddhist monks chanted
slogans supporting Ms. Suu Kyi and denouncing the pro-military
National Unity Party, the diplomats said. It was an objection
raised by a candidate of that party that led to the ban on Ms. Suu
Kyi.
   The demonstrators, who faced armed troops with fixed bayonets
and riot shields, dispersed after dark when it became clear no
announcement concerning Ms. Suu Kyi would be made.
   The Election Commission disqualified Ms. Suu Kyi partly on the
strength of allegations she had links with outlawed student groups.
   Today, troops guarded strategic points and sentries lined
pedestrian overpasses, the diplomats said. ``There seems to be a
deliberate show of force,'' said one.
   The disqualification of Ms. Suu Kyi's candidacy still has not
been officially announced.
   ``If it was announced, it could generate an explosion of public
anger and they may be trying to avoid that by keeping things as
confusing as possible,'' a diplomat said.

   Nearly 15 feet of snow has fallen on
northern Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula so far this winter. But a
Chicago mall is eager to take the flakes.
   The Keweenaw Chamber of Commerce on Friday trucked nine
8-foot-tall crates of its Upper Peninsula snow to Chicago's North
Pier Mall.
   Elizabeth Lee, who owns a store in the mall, said the shopping
area has planned a winter festival since July. Snow sculptors from
China, Italy and Germany were due to arrive this week. But there
was no snow for them to mold.
   A newspaper advertisement led Lee to the Upper Peninsula, where
Lake Superior moisture has helped dump more than 174 inches of snow
this winter.

<HEAD>Alcohol Consumption Lowest in 2 Years But Still Most Widely Used
Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are continuing the trend of drinking
less alcohol, but it still is more widely used than any other drug
or cigarettes, according to a government report.
   The 400-page ``Seventh Special Report to the U.S. Congress on
Alcohol and Health'' issued by the Department of Health and Human
Services says per capita consumption was 2.54 gallons of pure
alcohol in 1987, the lowest level since 1970.
   The formula used for the calculation takes into account the
relative differences in alcohol content of beer, wine and spirits.
   The report, issued every three years, has tracked a steady
decline in alcohol consumption since 1981.
   It also cites a U.S. household survey of people over age 12 in
1988 by the National Institute on Drug Abuse showing that 73.4
percent reported drinking alcohol in the past year, while 36.2
percent reported smoking cigarettes.
   The report also found:
   _About 10.5 million U.S. adults show signs of alcoholism and 7.2
million suffer from alcohol abuse although they do now show signs
of dependence.
   _High school seniors showed a decline in alcohol use during the
1980s, but in 1988, one study showed, 92 percent had tried alcohol,
nearly two-thirds were current drinkers and more than a third were
occasional heavy drinkers.
   _Nearly half of all motor vehicle accidents are alcohol-related.
   _About 25 percent of hospital patients have alcohol-related
problems.

   Actor Martin Sheen and 36 other protesters
against U.S. military aid to El Salvador were arrested as they
demonstrated in the Capitol rotunda on the opening day of the new
session of Congress.
   Dan Nichols, information officer for the Capitol Police, said
the protesters were charged with demonstrating within a Capitol
building and unlawful entry. He said the offenses carry a maximum
penalty of a $500 fine and six months imprisonment.
   The arrests Tuesday climaxed a day that began with an ecumenical
prayer service at a nearby church and included a march to the
Capitol by demonstrators carrying cardboard caskets in protest of
killings in El Salvador.
   The demonstrators in the rotunda knelt, lay down, chanted
slogans and lifted banners protesting aid to the Salvadoran
government and calling for negotiations to end the prolonged civil
war in that country.
   Sheen, who knelt rather than lay, was silent as he was led
handcuffed from the rotunda.

   Conductor Mstislav Rostropovich says he will
return to the Soviet Union for a concert tour next month with
feelings of ``enormous emotion,'' but has no thought of ending 16
years of exile in the West.
   Rostropovich, music director of the National Symphony Orchestra,
said Tuesday that he and his wife, soprano Galina Vishnevskaya,
were happy that Soviet authorities had ``admitted their mistake''
and decided to restore the citizenship stripped from them in 1978.
   But Rostropovich made clear during a session with reporters at
the Kennedy Center that the couple had no intention of abandoning
their life in the West and returning permanently to their homeland.
   Rostropovich repeated his assertion last week that ``the almost
16 years spent in the West since our exile do not yet allow us to
change our lives again.''
   Rostropovich is reported to have told friends privately there
cannot be a reconciliation until the Soviets also restore the
citizenship of his close friend, Nobel Prize-winning novelist
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who now lives in Vermont.
   Rostropovich and the National Symphony are scheduled to leave
Jan. 29 for a tour of Japan and the orchestra's first visit to the
Soviet Union, where they will give four days of concerts in Moscow
and Leningrad.

<HEAD>General Says Noriega `Coward' During Invasion; Noriega Calls Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ground forces commander in the
U.S. invasion of Panama says Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was a
coward who ``never did anything worthy of a military man'' after
the operation began Dec. 20.
   Noriega's main concern was to hide, Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros said
in an interview Tuesday.
   Noriega took refuge in the Vatican Embassy on Christmas Eve.
Under pressure from the papal nuncio, he surrendered to U.S. forces
on Jan. 3 and was flown to Miami, where he awaits trial on drug
trafficking charges.
   ``He never fought, rallied his forces or did anything worthy of
a military man,'' Cisneros said.
   Noriega's wife, Felicidad, and three daughters took refuge in
the Cuban Embassy and is seeking safe passage to the Dominican
Republic, but Panama has embezzlement charges pending against Mrs.
Noriega.
   Noriega has been calling his family at the embassy from the
United States, the Cuban ambassador said.
   ``He was interested in finding out about the health of his
daughters and he didn't say anything about politics,'' Ambassador
Lazaro Mora said. ``The calls have been brief.''
   He said Noriega had called two or three times since turning
himself over to U.S. forces.
   In the embassy along with Felicidad and daughters, Lorena,
Sandra and Thais is Sandra's husband, Jean Rene Beauchamps, a
Dominican, and their son Jean Manuel. The 5-month-old boy is
Noriega's only grandchild.
   ``Noriega's family is fine. They are in good spirits,'' the
ambassador said.
   Cisneros is commander of U.S. Army South, the ground forces of
the U.S. Southern Command, or U.S. military headquarters for
Central and South America. Born in Brownsville, Texas, he speaks
Spanish and has spent nearly three years in Panama.
   In the interview, he said the invasion was necessary because it
was evident there was no diplomatic solution and ``there was a real
threat to U.S. interests here.''
   Other sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Bush
administration decided on military action shortly after the Oct. 3
failed coup against Noriega. At least 10 officers involved in the
uprising were executed, some reportedly by an enraged Noriega.
   ``After Oct. 3, we saw a complete degeneration of the Panamanian
Defense Forces,'' Cisneros said. ``Indisicipline built up. ...
There were also the Dignity Battalions, that consisted mostly of
public employees forced to join, but had a hard core of criminals
recruited by Noriega.''
   The Dignity Battalions were paramilitary groups trained to act
as shock troops. Rumor had it that Noriega's reliance on them and
his arming of them increased as his control diminished over the
Defense Forces.
   Cisneros said that after Oct. 3, ``a threat to U.S. interests
here, to our country, to our families became very real. The
culminating point came when the U.S. officer was shot and killed.''
   A U.S. Marine lieutenant was killed at a Panamanian checkpoint
on Dec. 16. Washington demanded an explanation and Panama accused
the United States of provocations.
   ``It was clear at that point ... We had to do something,''
Cisneros said.
   The United States had applied economic and political pressure
trying to oust Noriega since February 1988, when he was indicted on
federal drug trafficking charges in two Florida courts.
   Noriega denied the charges.
   On Dec. 20, Cisneros' soldiers, normally charged with defending
the canal, rolled out of Fort Clayton for the invasion in a
combined operation with paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne
Division.
   The invasion had been rehearsed. U.S. forces in Panama had been
enlarged since May 1989.
   Cisneros said a Noriega bodyguard told the dictator the morning
of the invasion that he was going out to seek another hiding place.
   ``Noriega begged him, `Do not abandon me,''' Cisneros said. ``It
was then the bodyguard decided that it was fruitless to stay with
Noriega, a waste of time. He did not want more damage for his
country.
   ``He found a U.S. soldier who spoke no Spanish and it took a
long time for him to come to me to tell me where Noriega was,''
Cisneros said.
   By the time U.S. troops arrived, Noriega was gone.

   Former Mayor John V. Lindsay was ``doing fine''

   The 68-year-old Lindsay, who has had heart problems, was
admitted Tuesday to New York Hospital for observation, said Solomon
Torres, a hospital administrator.
   He was listed as stable today. His condition was not considered
life-threatening, Torres said.
   Lindsay remained conscious after collapsing at the Century Club,
police said. He underwent tests in the emergency room before being
admitted.
   Mayor David Dinkins went to the hospital after hearing of
Lindsay's illness.
   ``I'm pleased to report that he seems to be doing fine,''
Dinkins said.
   In January 1988, Lindsay underwent surgery to repair a leaky
heart valve at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center.
   Last March, he underwent tests in the coronary intensive care
unit of New York Hospital.
   Lindsay was a three-term congressman when he was elected mayor
in 1965 as a Republican. He was re-elected as an independent,
switched to the Democratic Party and made a bid for the
presidential nomination before leaving City Hall in 1973.
   He since has practiced law in Manhattan with the firm of Webster
and Sheffield.

<TEXT>
   Three days ago, Rodney Sumter stood on a subway
platform, waiting for a train with his 3-year-old son. Today, he
stands accused of fatally beating a homeless man who had taunted
him, spit at him and punched him in the face at the station.
   Friends and family of Sumter, who was fired last week from a job
teaching construction skills to homeless men, said he acted in
self-defense.
   ``He was protecting himself and his son from an unprovoked
attack that he tried to escape,'' Sumter's lawyer, Lewis Tyson,
said Tuesday as they left the Manhattan Criminal Court building.
   But an activist said the death was typical of the
life-threatening horrors New York City's homeless face every day.
   ``This has been portrayed to me as, `New Yorkers now have reason
to be afraid of the homeless.' I think the homeless have reason to
be afraid of New Yorkers. This man is dead,'' said Keith Summa,
advocacy director of the Coalition for the Homeless.
   Sumter pleaded innocent Tuesday to first-degree manslaughter and
was released without bail.
   Although there are no statistics on violence involving the
homeless in the subway system, ``there are more incidents now than
compared to 10 years ago,'' said Transit Authority police spokesman
Sgt. Robert Valentino.
   Two other men were in court Tuesday on charges they shoved a
homeless man to his death beneath a subway train. Summa recited a
litany of incidents where homeless victims were beaten, battered
and set aflame.
   Little is known about the dead man in the Sunday night case
involving Sumter.
   Identified only as John Doe, he was believed to be in his 60s.
He was a denizen of the midtown Manhattan station where he died; he
now seems destined for a Potter's Field burial.
   Sumter, 39, had no criminal record. He is married and lives in
Harlem. He worked as a plumber at various construction sites since
coming to New York in 1980.
   Earlier this month, he began work as a $20,000-a-year
construction supervisor training homeless men recruited from a city
shelter. The program is operated by the John Doe Fund, an advocacy
group for the homeless.
   ``He is one of the nicest guys,'' said Greg Powell, a supervisor
on the project. ``He would try to stop a fight, not start one.''
   George McDonald, the fund's executive director, said Sumter was
dismissed Jan. 17 because of personal problems at home. He said
Sumter had been ``distracted, and had come to work late.''
   According to police, the confrontation began at 11 p.m. Sunday
as Sumter and his son waited at the 59th Street station for a train
home after seeing the movie ``Back to the Future II.''
   The homeless man began verbally harassing Sumter, and at one
point spit at him, said transit police spokesman Al O'Leary. Sumter
finally lashed out when the man punched him above the left eye,
O'Leary said.
   ``The critical piece of information is that after the homeless
man fell to the platform, Mr. Sumter took his head and banged it
again into the concrete platform,'' O'Leary said.
   Sumter's wife, Michelle, who picked up their son, Patah, from
police the night of the killing, rejected such talk.
   ``I know he was defending himself and his child,'' she said.
   Summa, whose group handles a variety of problems involving the
homeless, remained skeptical that the case _ and John Doe's death _
would become anything more than statistics.
   ``What if this was someone's grandfather _ your grandfather _
and he spat at someone in the subway ... and the person killed him.
How would you react?'' he asked. ``My guess is differently than in
this incident. That tells us something.''

<HEAD>Motorola Settles Dispute Over Claimed Overcharge on Air Force
Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc. has agreed to pay the federal
government $750,000 to settle claims that it overcharged the Air
Force on a contract for a radar-jamming device.
   ``We decided to settle it. There's nothing other than that,''
Motorola spokesman Lawrence Moore said Tuesday.
   The agreement between Illinois-based Motorola and the U.S.
Department of Justice follows an investigation of charges that the
company's Government Electronics Group in suburban Scottsdale
overcharged the Air Force $325,317 in 1983 on a $28.3 million
contract.
   The two sides agreed that Motorola did not disclose cost
information related to the company's decision to buy rather than
manufacture some transformer and inductor units used in the
power-supply system for the devices.
   Under the federal false-claims act, a company is liable for up
to three times the amount of an overcharge, said Michael W.
Robinson, a Justice Department spokesman.
   Robinson said the $750,000 settlement was not considered a fine.
Moore said it is not unusual for the government and contractor to
disagree over the appropriateness of certain costs.

<HEAD>HHS Says Two Chains Owe Money for Recaptured Pension Assets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government investigator says two national
hospital chains owe the Medicare program $27.6 million for
Medicare's share of excess pension plan assets they took over.
   Humana Corp. owes $23.5 million and Hospital Corp. of America
owes $4.1 million, said a report by Richard Kusserow, inspector
general of the Department of Health and Human Services.
   ``Medicare, which paid its pro rata share of the pension
contributions, did not share equitably in the gains that resulted
from pension plan terminations,'' the inspector general said.
   Labor unions and their supporters in Congress contend the excess
assets of terminated pension plans should go to the workers on
whose behalf the plan was operated. But legally the money belongs
to the plan sponsor.
   Plans may accumulate excess assets for a variety of reasons,
mostly through pessimistic assumptions about the financial
performance of investments. For example, a plan may assume its
assets will earn 6 percent per year but actually earn 8 percent.
   When plans terminate, they must satisfy existing obligations,
either by establishing new plans, paying cash to members or buying
annuities for members. Both hospital companies established new
plans.
   The inspector general said 19 other hospital companies
terminated pension plans before 1983, realizing $3.7 million in
excess plan assets. Those actions were not further reviewed because
of the small amounts involved.
   HCA terminated its pension plan Dec. 30, 1982 and Humana Dec.
31, 1980.
   The report said the two chains recovered pension fund assets
totaling $90.7 million and those assets should have been applied to
offset hospital costs, leaving less for Medicare to reimburse.
   ``However, HCA offset only $20.2 million against costs and
Humana made no cost offset at all,'' the report said.
   ``For the $70.5 million not offset against costs by the two
hospital chains, we estimate the Medicare program is due $22.1
million plus accumulated interest of $5.5 million,'' the report
said.
   In Louisville, Ky., Humana spokesman Charles Teeple said his
company had not been notified of the HHS report. After receiving
it, ``We will need to study and determine the course we will
take,'' he said.
   In Nashville, Tenn., HCA spokesman David McFadden said his
company had not been notified of irregularities, and HCA's payments
contractor, Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Tennessee, had approved its
handling of the pension assets. ``We believe that what is occurring
here is that this is interpretation of rules after the fact,'' he
said.

   The state appeals court overturned the
conviction of an inmate whose weight has dropped by more than a
third during a 10-month hunger strike to protest his life sentence
on drug charges.
   The court ruled Tuesday that the evidence used to convict Rene
Acuna of cocaine delivery and conspiracy charges was inadequate. It
struck down the conviction and life sentence and declined to order
a new trial.
   Acuna, who has lived on water and sweet coffee since March 3,
said he would continue the strike until he is freed to return home
to his companion, Anna Sossa, and his two daughters.
   ``I will eat in the table of my house,'' said Acuna, a Cuban
immigrant and self-employed handyman whose weight in prison has
dropped from 180 pounds to 112 pounds.
   Assistant Macomb County Prosecutor Michael Suhy said he will
seek a review by the state Supreme Court and oppose Acuna's release
in the meantime.
   Acuna called the ruling a sign of divine power.
   ``I remember in the newspaper people said my hunger strike was
cheap publicity, but that was not my intention. It was to show my
innocence, and now my innocence has been shown,'' he said by
telephone from the state prison near Jackson.
   Acuna contended that undercover agents had lumped him together
with other Hispanics who were arrested during an undercover drug
buy in a predominantly white neighborhood of Warren, near Detroit,
in August 1988.
   Prosecutors claimed that Acuna was a lookout for the drug
dealers. The other convicted men testified they had never heard of
Acuna.
   ``This has been probably the most gut-wrenching case I ever
handled as a lawyer, and the system has worked,'' said Paul
Denenfeld, legal director for the Michigan chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union. ``We all believed this was simply a person
who was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and I think Rene's
courageous hunger strike has vindicated him.''
   Denenfeld said Suhy should reconsider his opposition to bond for
Acuna.
   ``The man has suffered enough,'' he said.
   ``We're in a situation where someone's life is on the line,''
said attorney Michael Schuck, who handled Acuna's appeal. ``He has
been on a hunger strike about 10 months now, and his life is in
danger every day.''
   Acuna's weight plunged as low as 106 pounds in September, and
doctors began force-feeding him. They removed the feeding tube when
Acuna's weight rebounded.

   Non-union coal trucks rammed the cars of
striking miners that blocked the entrance to a coal plant, and
police arrested six men, including two union officials charged with
illegal picketing.
   Tuesday's violence at the Rum Creek Coal Sales Inc. preparation
plant came a day after clashes that injured two women at the site.
   The non-union coal trucks, with steel plates welded to their
grills, brushed aside pickets on a bridge leading to the Rum Creek
depot Tuesday and smashed into two cars parked across the road.
   State police arrested three of the drivers on charges of
destruction of property and a fourth, Gaylord Conners of
Williamson, with attempted murder for allegedly trying to run down
a picket, police spokesman Ric Robinson said.
   Two United Mine Workers members, including international board
member Howard Green, were arrested on charges of violating a
federal judge's injunction against blocking the road, U.S. Marshal
Walt Biondi said.
   The two also were accused of violating a provision of the order
that limits the number of pickets at the site to 15.
   About two dozen union miners went on strike in August after a
non-union contractor was hired to run the plant in southern West
Virginia.
   The strike was not related to the UMW's 9-month-long,
three-state strike against the Pittston Coal Group. A tentative
agreement to end that strike was reached last month.
   A West Virginia miner was shot Jan. 16 in a conflict arising
from another coal strike.

<HEAD>Woman Who Killed Baby in 1952 Pleads Guilty to Reduced Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TROY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who admitted killing her baby and
burying the body in her backyard in 1952 probably will not go to
prison under a plea-bargain, a prosecutor says.
   Marion Allen, who confessed last year, ``has been confined to
her own type of prison for the past 37 years,'' Rensselaer County
District Attorney James B. Canfield said.
   ``It would appear her own mental anguish and guilt has exerted a
more severe penalty than the state ever could,'' he said.
   ``Justice is not served by having a 69-year-old woman spend the
remainder of her life in prison.''
   Allen pleaded guilty Tuesday to second-degree manslaughter. She
said she smothered her baby and buried it in the backyard of her
home.
   Canfield said he believes Judge M. Andrew Dwyer Jr. would accept
the agreement, under which Allen would receive five years'
probation when sentenced March 21.
   ``To the best of our knowledge she hasn't injured anybody
else,'' Canfield said. ``Since the death of her child, she's led a
simple life.''
   Allen, plagued by guilt, went to police in October and confessed
that she had buried the child in her yard.
   ``She could see the grave site,'' said Troy Police Capt. Albert
Prezio. ``It was only within a few feet from her window where she
sat most every day.''
   Authorities unearthed a small strongbox and the remains of the
baby. Laboratory tests failed to determine its sex or cause of
death.
   Allen spent about three months in a mental hospital following
her confession. She was released a few weeks ago into the custody
of her husband, George.
   The woman reportedly told police the baby was conceived from an
extramarital affair. She said she killed the infant without the
knowledge of her husband, who has refused to speak to reporters.

Resignation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A barricade was built around the office of
the parks commissioner while members of city council demanded his
resignation over allegations he had ordered pollution dumped in a
city lake.
   ``I don't think there's any fiction writer who could have
developed a more inane and criminally evil act,'' said Councilman
James W. Pitts after Robert E. Delano refused to appear before the
council's Finance Committee on Tuesday.
   Common Council members said they would subpoena Delano to answer
questions about scandals in his department and would try to cut off
his paychecks if he didn't comply.
   Meanwhile, a 3{-foot-high barricade was erected inside the parks
building Tuesday to bar the public from the office suite where
Delano and his top aides work. Office workers, who apparently were
working at Delano's behest, denied the barrier was intended to keep
television cameras out.
   They said it was put up because toxic chemicals are stored in
the building.
   Controversy has surrounded Delano for the past two months, since
the FBI confirmed it was investigating corruption charges against
him.
   The charges include having parks employees do private work on
city time, buying large quantities of supplies for which the city
had no use and then reselling them to private parties, and
harassment of parks workers, city officials and reporters.
   Last week, it was alleged that Delano ordered parks workers in
1987 to pour a salt-like chemical into Delaware Park Lake to keep
it from freezing after the council took a refreshment-stand
concession away from some of his close associates.
   The chemical did prevent freezing at one end of the lake. State
environment officials are checking the lake's water quality and
whether environmental laws were violated.
   ``It's a horrifying prospect to have your parks commissioner
polluting a parks lake,'' said Eugene Fahey, council majority
leader. ``We need to know whether it's true.''
   Delaware Park is the city's showpiece, laid out by Frederick Law
Olmsted, the designer of New York City's Central Park. A big
celebration was held in 1986 when skating resumed after a $12
million cleanup of pollution that had kept it from freezing.
   ``That's the jewel of the city of Buffalo,'' said Councilman
Alfred T. Coppola, whose district includes the park. ``We just
stocked the lake a couple of years ago, and here ... he's ordering
it to be polluted.''
   Delano did not return telephone calls seeking comment. His only
public comment on the charges has been the letter in which he
refused to appear Tuesday before the council's Finance Committee.
   ``Unfortunately, the news media has made so many false
accusations and blown this investigation so far from reality that I
was forced to seek the advice of an attorney,'' the letter said.
``He has advised me not to make any statements pertaining to this
investigation of my department.''
   Mayor James D. Griffin, a longtime friend of Delano, also did
not return telephone calls. The mayor has refused to answer
reporters' questions about Delano, but has lavishly praised him in
speeches and has labeled complaining parks workers ``stool
pigeons.''

miles north of Los Angeles.
   In the most serious accident, a small truck ran into the back of
a car that had just collided with a tractor-trailer. The
tractor-trailer had been slowing for another accident, the highway

   A man was arrested for three sexual assaults on
young girls a day after an anonymous donor offered $50,000 in
rewards to help solve the attacks and others against children in
two city neighborhoods.
   Donald Ray Gray, 34, was charged Tuesday with aggravated sexual
assault for three attacks in the last 15 months, the last on
Friday, said Dallas County sheriff's Sgt. R.L. Fitzpatrick. Gray
was being held held early today in lieu of a $25,000 bond.
   Deputy Police Chief Lowell Cannaday said the arrest resulted
from identification through motor vehicle records.
   In last week's attack, two children were abducted as they walked
to school, driven away and raped and then dropped off near where
they had been abducted. The earlier two attacks occurred in similar
circumstances, police said.
   An anonymous donor on Monday offered two $25,000 rewards for
information leading to the arrest and indictment of suspects in the
attacks and in other attacks on the city's north side, about 20
miles away.
   ``I would like to think that the reward helped in the case,''
said Cannaday.
   But he provided no details on how the reward might have helped
police. He said investigators would sort out the possible
application of the reward money during the next few days.
   The victims in the Oak Cliff attacks in south Dallas were all
black, ages 10 to 15, said Cannaday. He said victims in the north
Dallas attacks were white, ages 7 to 10.
   An assailant there broke into homes late at night and abducted
four young girls. The victims were sexually assaulted in three of
the cases, police said.

   Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co. said it planned
no further action after a jury ruled two former installers defamed
the company with allegations of illegal wiretapping, but a judge
said perjury changes may be warranted.
   The eight-member Hamilton County Common Pleas jury on Tuesday
found that Robert Draise and Leonard Gates defamed the phone
company and two managers by saying Bell had ordered hundreds of
illegal wiretaps between 1972 and 1984.
   Jurors awarded the company and the managers, James West and
Peter Gabor, more than $100,000 in compensatory damages. Judge Fred
J. Cartolano can add punitive damages.
   ``My goal now is to look to the future,'' Bell president Dwight
Hibbard said at a news conference at company headquarters. ``We've
cleared our name. We've cleared the names of the employees
involved.''
   The company and its supervisors denied any involvement in
illegal wiretaps, and sued Draise and Gates for $2 million after
they publicized claims they had wiretapped criminal suspects,
reporters, judges and political figures, including a U.S. president.
   Cartolano thanked jurors for settling a long-running public
controversy.
   ``You have now placed Mr. Draise and Mr. Gates before the bar
and before the people to be what they are _ thieves,'' Cartolano
told jurors. ``They stole the truth.''
   The judge said he, too, thought the men had lied.
   ``I am convinced that you and Mr. Gates have lied profusely,''
Cartolano told Draise. ``I am going to give the transcript to the
county prosecutor to decide whether to charge you with perjury.''
   The jury reached its verdict in the third day of deliberations,
ending a trial that started Nov. 20.
   The jury awarded the company $10,000 from each of the two former
employees; a total of $80,000 to company supervisor Peter Gabor and
$10,000 to another manager, James West.
   The judge can add punitive damages. Compensatory damages are
intended to compensate a wronged victim for loss of income, pain
and suffering and other actual damages. Punitive damages are
intended to punish.
   After the verdict, Gabor hugged his mother, Magda, and both wept.
   ``I just wish my wife could have lived long enough to see
this,'' said Gabor, whose wife died last week.
   Gates and Draise said they set 1,200 illegal wiretaps at the
instruction of West and Gabor, including one on President Gerald
Ford during a 1975 visit to Cincinnati.
   Phone company lawyers contended the two men were seeking revenge
because Bell fired Draise in 1979 and Gates in 1986.

   The drug rehabilitation center
treating Marion Barry stresses physical and spiritual recovery
through a method largely developed by Alcoholics Anonymous.
   It's also a place where tears are inevitable, one graduate of
the program said.
   The mayor of Washington, D.C., checked into the Hanley-Hazelden
Center on Monday. Lurma Rackley, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said
details about his health would be kept private but ``the most
serious problem is alcoholism.''
   The 66-bed non-profit clinic opened in 1986 as a satellite unit
of the Hazelden Foundation in Center City, Minn. Treatment
generally lasts 28 days and costs about $7,500.
   The foundation won't reveal the names of current or former
patients. But famous figures who have said they spent time at the
Minnesota clinic include Kitty Dukakis, wife of Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis; former Washington Redskins player Dexter Manley
and designer Calvin Klein.
   The weeks after detoxification are difficult but bearable, said
Bill Hetland, a graduate of the Minnesota clinic.
   ``You're in such a frame of mind, it doesn't take much to get
the people to cry,'' he said.
   The program near Minneapolis was founded 40 years ago by a group
of Alcoholics Anonymous members and businessmen concerned about
alcoholism among employees and relatives.
   Its goal, according to a center pamphlet, is to ``help
chemically dependent people break through denial and to maintain
ongoing abstinence and recovery upon return to the community.''
   Depending on the severity of the addiction, patients spend the
first day to one week in detoxification in a hospital-like setting.
   Then, the patient is moved to treatment wards where men and
women are kept separate. Each ward holds about 20 people.
   ``You can have visitors,'' said Brenda Lyles, a former official
in the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services who
was involved in licensing the West Palm Beach center. ``You aren't
confined there in the sense that you aren't locked down. The
expectation is that you desire to be there for your own treatment.''
   The day usually begins by 7 a.m.
   Patients are assigned chores, such as vacuuming and room
inspections before breakfast. The rest of the day is spent watching
films or listening to lectures.
   After each session, patients return to smaller groups for
``processing'' _ going over the content of the day's lesson. All
patients keep journals.
   The rooms contain single beds and white Formica dressers.
Television is allowed only during certain hours, and phone calls
are discouraged.
   The entrance to the center's six-acre campus has a string of
signs with sayings that include ``Let Go and Let God'' and ``One
Day at a Time,'' the motto of Alcoholics Anonymous.
   State substance-abuse experts praise the Hanley-Hazelden center.
   ``They have a long record of excellence,'' said John Daigel,
executive director of the Tallahassee-based Florida Alcohol and
Drug Treatment Association. ``They are a national leader in
substance-abuse treatment.''
   Barry, in a statement issued Tuesday by his Washington office,
asked the media to ``back away'' from the center.
   He said that he and his family were undergoing a ``demanding and
painful ordeal,'' and asked that reporters not make it any worse,
``for the sake of my privacy and that of others.''

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush calls this city a model
for driving away gangs and drug houses, but anti-crime activists
here say the deadly trade won't go away soon.
   Bush walked with police and community activists Tuesday in a
neighborhood where dealers peddled crack cocaine under a basketball
hoop until neighbors took down the basket and chased out much of
their business.
   ``What (Bush) really did was give us a pep talk and congratulate
us for what we have done _ and acknowledge that there's a long way
to go,'' said P. Albert Williams, a member of the Ad Hoc Group
Against Crime.
   The community organization works with law enforcement
authorities to close houses used by drug dealers.
   The federal government estimates that Kansas City ranks sixth in
the nation in availability of crack. Ranking 29th in metropolitan
population, the city had the ninth-highest murder rate in the
country last year, according to FBI figures.
   ``To me, it's a genocide,'' Williams said. ``If we keep up the
drugs, we're going to kill ourselves.''
   Police Maj. Sylvester Winston said 45 percent of the city's
record 136 homicides last year were drug-related, compared with
only 10 percent in 1986.
   Bush spoke to about 1,300 metropolitan area law enforcement
officials in a downtown auditorium, saying cooperation between
police and the community could win major battles against drugs.
   ``People in this town refused to surrender to the drug plague.
You took back what's yours. Took back your kids. Took back your
streets,'' Bush said.
   But activists and Bush, himself, said the problem had not been
solved in Kansas City. The message was that progress was being made.
   ``Certainly (Bush's speech) is going to galvanize the crime
fighters,'' said Alvin Sykes, leader of a group to help crime
victims. ``It's hard to gauge what kind of impact it will have on
the drug dealers. They didn't come down here to hear it.''
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and federal drug czar
William Bennett joined Bush in a meeting with the Ad Hoc Group,
which formed about a dozen years ago to ease tensions between
blacks and police. Today, the group founded by city human relations
Director Alvin Brooks marches around suspected drug houses. Clad in
blue windbreakers, they shout down dealers with bullhorns. The
group set up a hotline for people to report new houses.
   ``Our emphasis has been to try to raise the level of awareness
and consciousness about what drugs and related crimes and violence
are doing to our community, and we attack those crack houses,''
Brooks told the president.
   Guided by Brooks in an inner-city area, Bush visited a tree with
a basketball backboard attached to it. The hoop has been stripped
away by neighbors because it attracted drug dealers.
   Nearby, members of Black Men Together, an anti-crime group
affliated with Ad Hoc, demonstrated their chant to harass dealers:
``Change! Change! Change! You better run, dope pusher, better run!''
   At the speech to police, Bush stumped for a bill in Congress to
reduce constitutional restrictions on the courtroom use of evidence
seized illegally _ but in ``good faith'' _ by police.
   The concept won praise from Terry Storey, a police officer who
works with drug-raid teams in suburban Independence.
   ``It's pretty amazing when we lose cases even when it's pretty
obvious that the person's guilty,'' Storey said after the
president's speech. ``I've lost cases because of technicalities.''

   Allen Collins, who lost fellow members
of the rock group Lynyrd Skynyrd in a 1977 plane crash and was
paralyzed four years ago in a drunken driving accident, died of
pneumonia at age 37.
   Collins suffered respiratory failure Tuesday, said Memorial
Medical Center spokeswoman Karen Bowling. He had been hospitalized
since September, she said.
   Collins entered the hospital with pneumonia symptoms and was in
a coma for the last few days, said longtime friend Ann Thompson.
   Ms. Thompson described Collins as the ``most energetic, caring,
giving person I ever met.''
   Collins began his rise to success as the lightning-fingered
guitarist for the Jacksonville band formed in 1966 by a group of
high school students. The band enjoyed national fame in the 1970s
with such hits as ``Free Bird,'' ``Gimme Three Steps'' and ``Sweet
Home Alabama.''
   In 1977, lead singer Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Stevie Gaines
and Gaines' sister, Cassie Gaines, were killed in a plane crash.
Collins and other band members were severely injured.
   Two years later, Collins, Gary Rossington, Bill Powell and Leon
Wilkeson, all founding members of Lynyrd Skynyrd, joined with Barry
Harwood and Dale Krantz to form the Rossington-Collins band. The
group split in 1982, and Collins formed the Allen Collins band.
   In 1986, Collins' car ran off a road and crashed into a culvert,

<HEAD>Government Moves to Protect Noriega Secrets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The potential leak of CIA secrets in the trial of
Manuel Noriega has led the government to draw up tough security
guidelines that would force defense attorneys to sign oaths and
submit their work for review.
   In another motion filed in U.S. District Court Tuesday,
prosecutors asked for more time to go through mounds of documents
being uncovered since the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama, according to
a published report.
   Some defense attorneys balked at the proposed regulations, which
must be approved by U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler.
   ``Who's going to decide what is and what isn't classified
information _ the government?'' Kenneth Swartz, an assistant
federal public defender representing Noriega co-defendant Luis del
Cid, said Tuesday.
   But the motion by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael P. Sullivan
insisted the rules are necessary ``to protect the national security
of the United States.''
   ``The unauthorized disclosure and uncontrolled dissemination of
such information would cause exceptionally grave damage to the
national security of the United States,'' it said.
   The government requested a hearing on its motion, but no date
has been set.
   Noriega is scheduled for a bond hearing Friday. Attorneys for
the ousted Panamanian dictator have said they need some documents
to counter the government's contentions that he should be denied
bail because he was likely to flee.
   The government said the security guidelines were prompted by a
Classified Information Procedures Act notification from Michael
O'Kane, attorney for indicted pilot Daniel Miranda, another Noriega
co-defendant in the February 1988 drug-trafficking indictment.
   O'Kane has been outspoken in calling Noriega a tool of the
United States who acted with CIA approval.
   ``The hidden agenda of the government is not to release any of
this stuff,'' O'Kane said Tuesday.
   He acknowledged his search for sensitive documents is designed
to force the government's hand. The government's unwillingness to
release such information could help free his client, he said.
   Defense lawyers also criticized the government's motion for more
time to produce documents as evidence it is unprepared, The New
York Times reported today.
   But the prosecution motion said, ``Due to the recent events in
Panama, evidence is still being gathered and analyzed.''
   Also filed Tuesday was a motion for del Cid demanding that he be
released from an 4-by-8-foot punishment cell at the Metropolitan
Correctional Center southwest of Miami. Defense attorney Sam
Burstyn said the confinment is cruel and unusual punishment.
   Noriega, by contrast, ``is being given guest quarters usually
reserved for the most elite of federal prisoners,'' Burstyn wrote.
   ``The facilities that are being occupied by co-defendant Noriega
are capable of housing several additional pretrial detainees,''
said the motion, which asked that del Cid be allowed to join his
former boss at the federal courthouse apartment cell.
   Noriega's attorneys, meanwhile, have submitted addresses of two
homes and three military offices raided by U.S. troops during last
month's invasion of Panama, and are asking for an inventory of all
materials taken from them.
   On Friday, U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff ordered the
government to preserve all such evidence and submit a list of
everything taken from the sites.
   The defense list included homes in Panama City and Rio Hato,
along with offices at the destroyed Panamanian Defense Force
headquarters, the joint U.S.-Panama base at Fort Amador, and the
Departmento Nacional de Investigaciones.
   The Pentagon initially claimed it had confiscated large amounts
of cocaine at one Noriega residence, but on Tuesday acknowledged
that the wrapped packages were a material, possibly bonding glue,
that resembled the powdered drug.

<HEAD>Three-State Salmonella Outbreak Blamed on Tainted Cheese</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Contaminated cheese was the sole source of an
outbreak of salmonella infection that sickened thousands of people
in three states last summer, according to a state Health Department
investigation.
   The outbreak, which officials say may have affected 15,000
residents of Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota, was traced to
mozzarella cheese that was contaminated through poor sanitation
practices at the now-closed Kasson Cheese plant in Brillion, Wis.
   The tainted cheese was made into shredded cheese products at
three other Wisconsin plants and one in Minnesota, said state
epidemiologist Michael Osterholm.
   Investigators believe the cheese probably was heated enough at
the Brillion plant to kill any salmonella present during
processing, Osterholm said Tuesday.
   ``However, there was ample opportunity for contamination of
finished cheeses, from employee handling or contaminated work
surfaces, before the cheese was packaged,'' he said.
   Osterholm said employees also indicated ``that sanitation
practices had deteriorated at the plant'' last spring, as it faced
financial problems. The company filed for protection from creditors
in bankruptcy court in May, he said.
   Telephone calls to the Kasson plant went unanswered Tuesday.
   A Wisconsin official said he was not certain the entire
salmonella outbreak could be traced to the Kasson plant.
   ``It might have been other food on salad bars'' that made people
ill, said Bill Hanson, of the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture,
Trade and Consumer Protection's food division.
   The three other Wisconsin plants implicated by Osterholm in the
outbreak has passed inspections, Hanson said. They were the
Associated Milk Producers Inc. plant in Portage; Marathon Cheese in
Marathon, and Schreiber Foods in Green Bay.
   Bill Coleman, director of the dairy and livestock division of
the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, said no contamination was
found at the Pueringer Distributors plant in Rice, Minn.
   Low levels of the two strains of salmonella blamed for the
outbreak were found in two unopened packages of mozzarella produced
at the Brillion plant, Osterholm said.
   The outbreak involved two relatively uncommon forms of
salmonella: Salmonella javiana and Salmonella oranienburg.
   Confirmed cases represent only a fraction of cases that
occurred, according to the report. Symptoms included diarrhea,
cramps, fever, nausea and vomiting, and most of those who became
ill would not have seen a doctor or undergone testing, officials
said.

<TEXT>
   The videotaped statements of one of the murder
defendants in the slaying of a black youth by a white gang cannot
be used in court because he was not advised of his right to remain
silent, a judge ruled.
   Justice Thaddeus Owens issued the ruling at a pretrial hearing
Tuesday in Brooklyn's state Supreme Court.
   Pasquale Raucci, 19, one of six youths charged with
second-degree murder and other crimes in the Aug. 23 shooting death
of 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins, made two statements to police early
in the morning after the killing. Later that day, he made a
videotaped statement to a prosecutor.
   Detective Michael Bisogna, who brought Raucci in for
questioning, said Tuesday that Raucci was not advised of his right
to remain silent because he was not under arrest and detectives
considered him a witness, not a suspect.
   Owens replied he could not accept Bisogna's explanation.
   ``If you believe Detective Bisogna didn't know, then you believe
in the tooth fairy,'' the judge said.
   In a 15-minute statement taped the day after the attack and
played in court Monday, Raucci told prosecutors he had played a
role in the attack, but said he was at the rear of the pack of
rampaging young men.
   Prosecutors want the videotape and other police statements of
the defendants submitted as evidence, but defense attorneys contend
investigators failed to notify the youths they had the right to
remain silent.
   The defendants, all white, are charged with attacking Hawkins
and three of his companions, all black, when they went to the
mostly white Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn to look at a used car.

   Lawmakers shouted ``Banzai!'' as Parliament's lower
house was dissolved today to make way for elections next month in
which the once-invincible but scandal-plagued Liberal Democrats may
lose their majority.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, who took office in August after
two disgraced predecessors resigned, told fellow party members
after parliament dissolved that it was their duty to ``restore the
people's confidence in our party.''
   Shortly after the session began, Speaker of the House Hajime
Tamura read an imperial edict written on parchment declaring the
house dissolved.
   The legislators then shouted three resounding ``Banzais,'' _
literally ``10,000 Years,'' a wish for long life _ and disbanded.
   The 10-minute session allowed legislators just enough time to
pass a bill on subsidies for rice growers and to approve plans for
Emperor Akihito's younger son, Prince Aya, to marry commoner Kiko
Kawashima this spring.
   The Cabinet met later and said it would officially announce on
Feb. 3 that the election will be held Feb. 18.
   It was up to the 59-year-old Kaifu, a former education minster,
to decide when to dissolve the lower house. He was believed to have
wanted a later election date so he could make a major policy
address to Parliament, but gave in to the wishes of party leaders
with more clout.
   An election must be held by July, when the current four-year
term of lower house members expires.
   Pressure for an early election has been building for a year as
the Liberal Democrats became mired in scandals, and party leaders
apparently chose mid-February to get the election out of the way
before legislators become bogged down with the national budget,
which must be passed by April 1.
   At the Liberal Democrats' headquarters today, each of the
party's 270 incumbent candidates received a certificate of
endorsement, a handshake from Kaifu and a brown paper bag of cash
for campaign expenses.
   The legislators left laden with bags of new 10,000-yen ($70)
notes. Legislators who have served in Cabinet posts said they
received about $100,000 and those who hadn't got about $170,000
because they need more public exposure.
   Party officials said about $35,000 was a cash gift and the
remainder was a loan. In Japan, even large transactions are often
carried out in cash.
   The Liberal Democrats, who have governed Japan continuously for
34 years, could lose their majority in the lower house and with it
the right to govern.
   In July, they lost control of the less powerful upper house as
voters registered dissatisfaction over bribery and sex scandals and
an unpopular sales tax. Taking responsibiilty for the loss, Prime
Minister Sosuke Uno then resigned after just two months in office
and Kaifu was the surprise choice for party leader. He is widely
considered an interim leader.
   The upper house majority is held by opposition parties led by
Japan Socialist Party leader Takako Doi, but it is the leader of
the majority party in the lower house who traditionally becomes
prime minister.
   The Liberal Democrats face a tough challenge in retaining the
295-seat majority they have held in the 512-seat lower house since
July 1986, although recent public opinion polls have showed support
for the governing party outweighing support for the opposition.
   A poll released Tuesday by the national newspaper Asahi Shimbun
showed 49 percent of those surveyed supported the Liberal Democrats
while 30 percent supported the Socialists. The Asahi did not give a
margin of error for the survey of 3,000 people.
   Numerically, the Liberal Democrats are almost certain to
outnumber any other party after the election. More than 300 Liberal
Democrats are likely to run, while the Socialists are fielding just
160 candidates _ well below the number needed to secure a solid
majority.
   While the opposition has a chance to form a combined majority in
the lower house, analysts say ideological differences make unlikely
a Socialist-led coalition with the second- and third-largest
groups, the centrist Komeito (Clean Government Party) and
Democratic Socialist Party.
   The centrists are more likely to side with the Liberal
Democrats, the analysts say. Party sources say the Liberal
Democrats have been negotiating behind the scenes to gain Komeito
and Democratic Socialist support if necessary after the election.
   The Socialists currently hold 83 lower house seats, the Komeito
54, Japan Communist Party 26 and the Democratic Socialists 25. The
remaining 29 seats are held by minor parties and independents or
are vacant.
   The Socialists and the other major opposition parties met this
afternoon and declared their determination to end Liberal Democrat
rule, abolish the sales tax and cooperate ahead of the election.
   The Liberal Democrats have been struggling to restore their
popularity since many party leaders became entangled in the Recruit
scandal, in which over 150 members of the nation's elite were
alleged to have profited from sales of shares supplied by Recruit
Co., an information services conglomerate.
   Allegations of influence-buying led to Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita's resignation and, coupled with the unpopular sales tax
introduced in April, contributed to the Liberal Democratic defeat
in the upper house.
   The February election is widely seen as an opportunity for
Japanese voters to pass judgment on the Liberal Democrats.

   Hundreds of policemen waving rifles and
shouting ``Death to the Indian army'' refused to work today,
hampering government efforts to halt a violent Moslem separatist
movement in Kashmir.
   By mid-afternoon the strikers agreed to go back to work, a
police official and a strike leader said.
   At least 57 people, mostly Moslem militants, have been killed
since the government on Saturday launched a crackdown on militant
secessionists who want to become independent or merge with Moslem
Pakistan.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only Moslem-dominated state in
predominantly Hindu India. About 64 percent of the mountainous
northern state's 5 million people are Moslems.
   One death was reported today. A Moslem militant was killed when
paramilitary forces, fearing imminent attack, opened fire on a mob,
a senior police official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The striking policemen, many in the brown uniforms of the state
constabulary, stopped police vehicles in the streets and urged
their colleagues to join the protest.
   Head Constable Mohammad Iqbal, one of the striking policemen,
said at least a third of the 40,000-man force had refused to report
for duty to protest the deployment of the Indian army to control
the agitation.
   ``This is the beginning of a new chapter in Kashmir,'' he said.
``We have been driven to the wall so we are reacting.''
   A total of about 1,000 policemen were seen in three separate
groups stopping cars driven by other policemen. One group of about
300 shouted: ``Death to the Indian army'' and ``Indians go back.''
   Hitendra Narain Saxena, the top police official in Jammu-Kashmir
state, said at mid-afternoon that the strikers had agreed to return
to work.
   One of the strike leaders, constable Mohammad Afzal, said the
strike had been postponed until Saturday.
   Simmering tension between Kashmir police and federal troops
flared Sunday after a policeman was shot and killed by soldiers
enforcing an around-the-clock curfew in Srinagar. Officers in
Srinagar and a senior government spokesman in New Delhi said the
killing was an accident.
   The striking policemen did not openly express support for the
escalating Moslem secessionist movement but one said: ``The
government calls us terrorists. If that is the case, why should we
fire at our own people ?''
   He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   About 300 protesting policeman marched to police headquarters.
   ``They (the government) call us Pakistani dogs. We are not ...
Let the Indian army and others know we will smash them if they
confront us,'' constable Mohammad Afzal told the crowd.
   Srinagar's police inspector general, Mohammad Azhar Nomani,
appealed to the men to return to duty and to come to him with any
grievances.
   Climbing atop his jeep, Nomani told the crowd: ``Don't get
agitated. Don't get provoked.''
   Afzal said the strikers had two demands: that the army and other
federal troops leave Kashmir and the government re-instate a police
union dissolved in 1979.
   Authorities said federal troops were patrolling the city but, to
avoid confrontation, had been ordered not to leave their vehicles.
   An around-the-clock curfew confining people to their homes was
lifted temporarily this morning. It had been scheduled to be lifted
for four hours but was restored after just one hour because of the
police situation, a government official said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   On Tuesday, India repeated charges that Islamic Pakistan was
fomenting trouble in Kashmir, but Pakistan again denied the charge.
   The two countries have a history of animosity and have fought
three wars, two of them over Kashmir, since they gained
independence from Britain in 1947. The last war was in 1971.
   A cease-fire line dividing Kashmir into Indian and Pakistani
sectors is monitored by United Nations military observers.
   Nationwide, Moslems form 12 percent of India's 880 million
peoeple and Hindus make up 82 percent.
   Srinagar, the largest city in the Kashmir Valley, is the summer
capital of Jammu-Kashmir state. The Kashmir region is mostly
Moslem, while the southern Jammu region is predominantly Hindu.

   William H. Metcalfe, a pioneer
Canadian journalist who was managing editor of the country's first
co-operative newspaper and of the Winnipeg Free Press and Ottawa
Journal, died Monday at age 83.
   His first job was with the Winnipeg Free Press, where he worked
as a reporter and copy editor.
   In 1948, he took over as managing editor of the fledgling
Winnipeg Citizen, owned by 13,000 member-shareholders. The paper
was born out of discontent after the Winnipeg pressmen's strike of
1945, but lasted only one year before going bankrupt.
   Metcalfe rejoined the Free Press as an editorial writer in 1949
and became managing editor in 1952. He became managing editor of
the Journal in 1960. Both papers were part of the old FP
Publications chain of newspapers.
   He retired in 1972. In 1985, he published an autobiography, The
View from Thirty.

<HEAD>Azerbaijanis Gather at Iran-Soviet Border, Start Building Bridge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Soviet Azerbaijanis gathered
along the Iranian frontier and some started building a new border
bridge across the Araks river, Iran's official news agency said
today.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said women television
announcers in the Azerbaijani border enclave of Nakhichevan wore
black headscarves Tuesday, apparently in mourning for ``victims of
the Baku carnage.''
   The report came as Soviet military authorities banned
demonstrations and strikes in Baku, the capital of Soviet
Azerbaijan, and arrested 43 suspected activists.
   Soviet troops moved into Baku over the weekend to crush a
nationalist uprising in Azerbaijan and end bloody ethnic clashes
between Azerbaijanis and mostly Christian Armenians.
   Most Azerbaijanis, whose historic homeland extends into Iran,
are Shiite Moslems, the predominant religion in Iran.
   Thousands of Soviet Azerbaijanis, bound by language, culture and
religion to their Iranian kin, have crossed the border since the
violence began.
   The Iranian news agency, monitored in Cyprus, said about 300
people gathered Tuesday on the Soviet side of the border about 12
miles west of the frontier town of Poldasht. Twenty-eight Soviet
armored personnel carriers patrolled a military road that runs
along the border, it said.
   About six miles farther west, Soviet troops stopped Azerbaijanis
from building a bridge across the Araks river Tuesday, the agency
reported.
   But following ``a gathering by the people and their ultimatum to
the Soviet forces,'' the building work was later resumed and a
section of bridge foundations was laid, it said.
   Soviet forces continued to observe the operation from a nearby
village, the agency reported.
   Moscow Radio, clearly telling the Iranians not to interfere in
Azerbaijan, declared on Tuesday: ``Any unconsidered nationalistic
or religious appeals would be dangerous.... Brutal and illusory
nationalistic flights of fancy have dragged the people to the brink
of the precipice.''
   The Soviets fear that Iran, whose religious leaders see it as
the champion of the world's 1 billion Moslems, is becoming
increasingly caught up in the crisis in Soviet Azerbaijan.
   In an earlier report, Tehran radio said 160 of the 270 members
of Iran's parliament called on Moscow to treat the Azerbaijani
Moslems with compassion.
   Parliament speaker Mahdi Karrubi, a staunch advocate of
exporting Iran's revolutionary brand of Islam, on Sunday condemned
Moscow for the crackdown in Azerbaijan and warned that Soviet
actions could ``create more problems for the Soviet Union.''
   Moscow radio, calling for restraint by Iran, accused Karrubi by
name of ``political blindness'' in its Persian language newscast.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are key dates leading to Wednesday's decision
to dissolve the lower house of Parliament and hold a general
election in Japan:
   1988
   June _ News of a scandal emerges affecting top leaders of the
governing Liberal Democratic Party as well as other influential
people who profited in bargain-priced share deals. The Recruit
scandal, named after the Recruit Co. conglomerate, leads to
accusations of bribery.
   Oct. 20 _ A Recruit official is arrested on charges of trying to
bribe an opposition lawmaker to soft-pedal his investigation of the
scandal.
   Nov. 16 _ A list of 26 politicians and government officials who
received Recruit shares is released in Parliament, embarrassing
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and other party leaders who were
named.
   Nov. 17 _ The government pushes through Parliament its bill to
impose a 3 percent tax on sales, which proves unpopular even though
coupled with reductions in income taxes and other levies.
   Dec. 9 _ Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa resigns after
repeatedly changing his explanation of an aide's Recruit stock
purchases.
   1989
   Feb. 13 _ Recruit Co. founder Hiromasa Ezoe is arrested.
   April 11 _ Prime Minister Takeshita acknowledges he received the
equivalent of more than $1 million in political donations from
Recruit Co.
   April 25 _ Takeshita announces he will resign, and his secretary
commits suicide a day later.
   June 2 _ Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno becomes prime minster and
promises political reform, but inside a week his standing is
threatened by published allegations he kept paid mistresses.
   July 23 _ An election for half the members of the upper house of
Parliament results in a defeat for the Liberal Democrats, who lose
their majority in the less-powerful chamber for the first time in
34 years. Uno says he will resign to take responsibility.
   Aug. 10 _ Toshiki Kaifu, a former education minister with no
personal power base in the governing party, is named prime minster,
the fourth to hold the post since the last lower house election in
July 1986, when Yasuhiro Nakasone headed the government.
   Nov. 12 _ The opposition majority in the upper house passes a
bill to abolish the unpopular new sales tax. It is the first
instance in 43 years of either house passing legislation opposed by
the government, and the move increases pressure for an early
election.
   Nov. 24 _ Six separate trials start for 12 defendants in the
Recruit scandal, including two members of Parliament, on bribery
charges. The trials are expected to last through most of 1990.
   1990
   Jan. 8-18 _ Prime Minister Kaifu makes a whirlwind tour of
countries in East and West Europe as politicians at home indicate
that Feb. 18 will be the date to elect a new lower house of
Parliament.
   Jan. 24 _ The lower house _ the more powerful house as it
chooses the prime minister _ is dissolved and the election date is
set for Feb. 18.

the jet was assigned to the 18th Tactical Fighter Wing at Kadena
Air Base in Japan.
   Cope Thunder began Jan. 14 and ends Friday.

   The motive behind a series of
final-hour confessions by serial killer Ted Bundy remains a mystery
today, the first anniversary of his death in Florida's electric
chair.
   Homicide investigators still question whether Bundy's
confessions in 23 killings in Washington state, Idaho, Utah and
Colorado shortly before his execution were merely a desperate
gamble to prolong his life.
   An investigator with the attorney general's office in Washington
said Bundy was trying to ``save his neck'' by exchanging
information for time.
   ``He had two things in mind. One was to get law enforcement to
intervene with the governor by saying he'd been cooperative and we
need more time and the other was to play on the sympathies of the
victims' relatives to have them contact the governor and speak on
his behalf,'' said Bob Keppel, who interviewed Bundy in the days
before the execution.
   But Dennis Couch, a Utah investigator, said by the time he
talked with Bundy 36 hours before the execution, the serial killer
``looked like a whipped puppy.
   ``I had the feeling that he knew he was defeated and it was the
end of the line,'' said Couch, of Salt Lake County. ``I felt at the
time that he was sincere in trying to find the bodies for the
families.''
   In the end, the confessions won the former law-school student no
extra time.
   He was strapped into electric chair on Jan. 24, 1989, for the
1978 kidnaping, rape and murder of a 12-year-old Lake County girl.
Her body was found in an abandoned pigsty. He also was condemned
for the slaying of two young women in a sorority in Tallahassee.
   Diana Weiner, an attorney who arranged the final interviews with
investigators, said the day before his death Bundy filed a written
request for a 30- to 60-day extension with the governor's office.
He had offered to fully answer questions of investigators and be
examined by doctors and psychiatrists in hopes they could better
understand his behavior, Weiner said.
   ``He wanted to die having left a more full understanding with
the public of what the underlying factors were in his behavior so
that we as a society ... would be able to take steps to prevent the
kind of behavior he committed,'' she said.
   Gov. Bob Martinez, who signed the death warrant Jan. 19, did not
respond to the request.
   Investigators in Idaho, Washington and Utah said the information
given by Bundy in his final days has not led them to any more
bodies but helped tie Bundy to killings and disappearances.
   ``I think he just confirmed what circumstantial evidence we in
the state of Washington assumed all along _ that he was the killer.
We did not find any remains,'' Keppel said.
   Keppel said Bundy admitted to 11 slayings in Washington, but
they had only tied him to eight.
   Bundy also told Utah authorities where he left three bodies.
   ``I wish we could have found something _ some kind of remains of
some bodies. That's the frustrating part about the whole thing. I
had a lot of hope there,'' Couch said.
   Jim Whitehead, chief of the Idaho Bureau of Investigation, said
Bundy confirmed the slaying of a 12-year-old Pocatello girl, who
authorities had suspected he had killed. Bundy also told officers
about the slaying of a hitchhiker near Boise. No bodies were found.
   He also confessed to killings in Colorado.
   The FBI is working with local law enforcement agencies to try to
develop a time line by tracking Bundy's travels using credit card
receipts, arrest records and other documents.
   Bill Hagmaier, supervisory agent for the FBI's National Center
for the Analysis of Violent Crime in Quantico, Va., said the
profile and time line should be completed in two months.
   Hagmaier, who sat in on all the final law enforcement
interviews, said Bundy gave information until minutes before his
death. He confessed to 23 killings and gave information that
authorities said might link him to other cases.
   ``The bottom line was, he said, `I did it because I enjoyed
doing it and I wanted to do it,''' Hagmaier said of Bundy's motives
for the killings.
   ``If there were two things that Bundy did in 10 years he spent
on death row _ one was try to understand himself and others like
him and the other was to trying to prolong his life,'' he said.
``He was a student of his own behavior.''

   Grand jury testimony by a former model who
helped the FBI arrest Mayor Marion Barry in a cocaine sting is part
of an investigation of possible perjury by the mayor, law
enforcement sources say.
   Rasheeda Moore, 38, testified for 2{ hours on Tuesday in the
investigation of whether Barry lied under oath by denying he used
drugs, the sources say.
   Ms. Moore, identified by law enforcement sources as the woman
who cooperated with the FBI in last week's arrest of Barry on a
cocaine possession charge, testified in secret.
   She has recently told investigators about using crack cocaine
with Barry on numerous occasions during a lengthy romantic
relationship, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Ms. Moore's accounts of drug use with Barry during a weekend
trip to the Virgin Islands in 1988 back up testimony by convicted
drug dealer Charles Lewis, who also is cooperating with the
investigation, according to the sources.
   Lewis, who Friday received a 15-month prison term for cocaine
conspiracy, has testified he bought drugs for Barry and smoked
crack cocaine with him in a downtown hotel in Washington and during
the March 1988 weekend in the Virgin Islands.
   The year-long investigation of Barry was touched off by reports
that the mayor was in Lewis's room at the downtown Ramada Inn on
Dec. 22, 1988, when city police went to investigate reports Lewis
was selling drugs.
   The officers abruptly and inexplicably left the hotel after
learning the mayor was in Lewis' room.
   Last Thursday, the mayor was videotaped by FBI agents smoking a
small amount of crack cocaine after purchasing the drug during a
visit to Ms. Moore's room at the Vista International Hotel,
according to sources.
   The mayor was arrested and later charged with misdemeanor
possession of cocaine by FBI agents who monitored the episode on a
surveillance camera in an adjacent room.
   Ms. Moore began cooperating with the investigation several weeks
ago following her arrest in the Los Angeles area on a charge of
driving while intoxicated, according to one source.
   The sting operation was approved at the highest levels of the
FBI and was carefully planned to avoid any defense claims the mayor
was entrapped, according to sources.
   The mayor, in sworn grand jury testimony last year, denied
allegations of drug use, said the sources, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   An undercover operation to catch the mayor on a misdemeanor drug
charge would not have been approved if there had not been
suspicions that Barry lied to the grand jury when questioned about
drug use, the sources said.
   One source said an indictment from the grand jury was not
expected soon, adding that the panel had to consider a complicated
set of evidence.
   FBI agents instructed Ms. Moore not to suggest drug use and she
was told not to use crack cocaine herself, sources said. Barry
inquired about getting some drugs shortly after he entered the
room, according to court papers.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens indicated last Friday that more
charges were likely to be brought in ``an ongoing investigation of
a broader range of allegations our office has been pursuing since
last January, following the Ramada Inn incident.''
   The prosecutor said he viewed Barry's arrest ``not as the end of
an event but as part of an ongoing investigation.''
   The probe, sources say, also is focusing on allegations of
contract fraud in the District of Columbia government, where
several of the mayor's top associates have been convicted of
federal corruption charges in the last five years, sources say.
   Prosecutors, meanwhile, opposed a request by Barry's lawyers to
suspend weekly drug testing of the mayor, who checked into a West
Palm Beach, Fla., drug rehabilitation center on Monday.
   The prosecution team filed court papers suggesting the mayor
undergo tests at a federal pre-trial services office near the drug
clinic where he is staying.

   A Libyan airliner left Frankfurt
airport today after West German authorities held the plane for
several hours following a tip that terrorists may be aboard,
officials said.
   Roland Bachmeier, a spokesman for the West German Interior
Ministry, said three passengers were detained for carrying arms
without permits, then released when it turned out they were the
airline's security guards.
   The Libyan Airlines Boeing 727 left Frankfurt for Tripoli after
the three guards rejoined the plane, Frankfurt Airport spokesman
Wolfgang Schwalm said.
   Government officials refused to explain who told them that
terrorists may have been aboard the plane, but security sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ``Nothing was found to
confirm the warning.''
   West German border police searched the plane shortly after it
arrived in Frankfurt from Tripoli on Tuesday. The luggage of all 75
passengers was also closely inspected. No other weapons were found
during the search.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman denied Libyan reports that West
German police mistreated some passengers during the search.

   A 12-year-old raped his 5-year-old
stepsister after watching a sex scene on television, authorities
said.
   The boy, whose name was withheld because of his age, was charged
Tuesday with rape, incest and lewd and lascivious acts on a child

   He was to appear in court today for a hearing on whether he
should be released to his parents.
   The boy was taken into custody Sunday after the girl told her
parents what happened and they took her to a hospital, police said.
Hospital officials contacted police after finding that the child
had been raped, police said.
   ``The boy told us that he assaulted his stepsister twice late
Sunday afternoon while his parents were out shopping,'' said Lt.
Thomas Hull. ``He said he got the idea while watching TV either the

   It was not known what program the boy watched, Hull said.
   If convicted, the boy could receive up to eight years in

   The defense minister abruptly
resigned today in a disgreement with the army chief of staff.
   The minister, Italo Luder, quit after telling a radio station he
had ordered the chief of staff, Gen. Isidro Caceres, to be
disciplined for arranging a meeting last week with the president
that exluded Luder.
   Caceres discussed military problems, including internal
security, at the dinner meeting with President Carlos Menem and
other top aides, Luder told Radio Mitre. ``I was in the city ...
and did not know of the meal,'' he said.
   For that, Caceres ``merits a sanction,'' Luder said.
   There was no immediate response from Caceres, who helped the
government of former President Raul Alfonsin put down the Villa
Martelli army insurrection led by then-Col. Mohamed Seineldin in
December 1988.
   Luder met with Menem this morning. Afterward, he told reporters
he handed the president his ``undeclinable'' resignation.
   There was no immediate comment from Menem.
   The dispute comes at a time when the government has failed to
solve several problems in the military, including low pay for
soldiers, poor equipment, and a budget so small that the number of
conscripts this year was reduced.
   Also, the army remains divided between a nationalist sector that
staged three insurrections against Alfonsin between April 1987 and
December 1988, and a sector led by Caceres that is loyal to the
government.
   In October, Menem tried to resolve the thorny problem of
officers accused of kidnapping, torture and murder during the
1976-83 dictatorship by pardoning several hundred, along with
several dozen alleged left-wing subversives.
   Menem, who took office in July, said the pardon was necessary to
achieve national conciliation, but he did not extend it to the
former commanders of the juntas during the last dictatorship who
not only were accused but prosecuted, convicted and sentenced.
   Caceres and other army leaders have publicly stated in recent
weeks that the commanders should be freed from prison.

<TEXT>
   The largest dissident alliance today
pledged a nationwide drive to stop President Roh Tae-woo's
governing party and two opposition parties from joining forces to
create a single conservative party.
   Differences were reported today as talks began on how to
complete the merger. Officials involved in the negotiations said
there was disagreement over who should lead the new party, which is
to be inaugurated in May.
   The move, announced after talks Monday between Roh and
opposition leaders Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil, will join the
governing Democratic Justice Party with the nation's No. 2 and 3
opposition groups, led by the two Kims.
   The new party, tentatively called the Democratic Liberal Party,
would be the first in Korea's modern history formed by ruling and
opposition parties.
   Police today said hundreds of officers were mobilized to protect
the two Kims, whose homes and offices have been flooded with
threatening telephone calls since the announcement.
   Roh says a new broad-based governing party will give the country
the political stability it has never had, but some fear it will
radicalize the opposition and cause anti-government violence.
   The United National Democratic Movement, the nation's umbrella
dissident organization involving about 200 groups, agreed to launch
a nationwide movement with ``all democratic forces'' opposing the
new party, a spokesman said.
   The alliance played a key role in months of street protests that
forced the government to carry out broad reforms in 1987.
   The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
alliance was ready to work with radical students, workers and Kim
Dae-jung, whose opposition Party for Peace and Democracy will be
hurt by the merger. It called for immediate elections to form a new
National Assembly.
   Kim Dae-jung has pledged to collect 10 million signatures on
petitions calling for new elections to block creation of the new
party.
   A 15-member working committee was formed today to discuss
procedures on the merger of Roh's party with Kim Young-sam's
Reunification Democratic Party and Kim Jong-pil's New Democratic
Republican Party.
   Officials involved said there were differences over how to
compose the new party's leadership and hierachy.
   Members of Kim Young-sam's party want their leader to head the
new party and supervise its affairs, while governing party
officials support a collective leadership controlled by Roh, the
officials said.
   Roh defeated Kim Young-sam in the 1987 presidential election by
a narrow margin.
   The merger could be a major victory for Roh, who will be assured
of a two-thirds majority in the opposition-controlled National
Assembly. But it could cause serious repercussions by isolating the
Party for Peace and Democracy, the nation's most radical and
largest opposition group.
   The party controls the underprivileged Cholla provinces, where
one-fifth of the nation's 42 million people live. Kwangju, the
scene of a civil uprising in 1980 that left 200 people dead by
official count, is the capital of South Cholla province.
   The merger also could enliven dissident movements and touch off
a new wave of violent anti-government demonstrations.
   Kim Dae-jung has declared a virtual political war against the
Roh government, announcing that ``Our party is prepared to make any
sacrifice to block the one-party dictatorship.''
   Dissidents and radical students, denouncing the new party as an
attempt by a pro-U.S. military dictatorship to prolong its power,
also promised to fight.
   The planned merger came as a surpise. The two centrist
opposition parties had been discussing a possible merger, but few
expected Roh's governing group to join them.
   The merger generally is viewed as a result of Roh's desire for
political stability by obtaining a parliamentary majority, coupled
with the two Kims' ambitions for post-Roh leadership.
   Roh steps down in early 1993 at the end of a single five-year
term.
   His party has been in an uncomfortable situation since losing
its parliamentary majority in the 1988 elections for the first time
in South Korea's 40-year constitutional history.
   Observers think Roh's dislike of Kim Dae-jung swayed him to
choose the other two Kims as his merger partners.
   Roh, as an army general, helped former President Chun Doo-hwan
seize power with military backing in an internal coup in 1980.
   Under the martial law government, controlled by Roh and Chun,
Kim Dae-jung was given the death penalty on what he called
``trumped-up sedition charges'' in 1980. The sentence was later
commuted to life in prison, and the opposition leader was freed a
few years later under U.S. pressure.

   A retired grocery clerk charged with Nazi war
crimes was ordered extradited to West Germany after waiving his
right to a hearing.
   ``He just wants to get it over with,'' attorney Ronald G. Parker
said of Bruno Karl Blach's decision.
   The 70-year-old Blach, imprisoned since October, has been
accused by West German authorities of murdering three concentration
camp inmates during a forced march between Nazi camps in 1945.
Blach maintains his innocence.
   He was to be flown immediately to West Germany for trial,
authorities said.
   Blach becomes only the fourth alleged Nazi war criminal to be
extradited from the United States since 1973 when the U.S.
government began searching out such people, said Murray Stein,
senior counsel with the U.S. Department of Justice.
   Parker said he believed Blach could have fought extradition on
technical grounds and won, but he said Blach knew other legal
efforts would follow.
   Blach, a native of Czechoslovakia and a permanent resident of
the United States with a West German passport, lived suburban La
Habra until his arrest in October.
   Blach, who entered the United States in 1956, was ordered
deported in 1987 but an appeal is still pending.
   During an emotional deportation hearing, a concentration camp
survivor identified Blach as the Nazi guard who used a machine gun
to kill an elderly Polish Jew who faltered during the forced march
between the Wiender Neudorf concentration camp in Germany to the
Mauthausen camp in Austria.
   Parker said that unlike three war criminals who were extradited
and convicted, Blach was not in a position of power during the war.
   ``He was, at most, a private first-class,'' he said.
   The others extradited were Hermine Braunsteiner Ryan, a former
concentration camp guard who became a homemaker on Long Island,
N.Y.; Andrija Artukovic, a Los Angeles man convicted of ordering
the deaths of several hundred people while serving as a cabinet
minister in the Nazi puppet state of Croatia, and John Demjanjuk of
Cleveland, who was extradited to Israel and convicted of mass
murders at the Treblinka death camp in Poland.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition forces have postponed talks with
Premier Hans Modrow on entering his caretaker government,
indicating their reluctance to be associated with the
still-dominant but increasingly unpopular Communists.
   In the latest demonstration of East Germans' growing impatience
with the authorities, more than 10,000 skilled workers rallied in
East Berlin on Tuesday to denounce communism for squelching
craftsmanship.
   They demanded free-market reforms to revive artisanship, and
many echoed increasing calls for reunification with prosperous West
Germany.
   A new round of warning strikes, bleak new economic data and the
announcement of price increases for farm products have added to the
sense of crisis.
   The official news agency ADN said Tuesday that the East German
economy posted its lowest growth of the decade last year, expanding
by 2 percent instead of the 4 percent called for by central
planners.
   The continuing exodus of workers to West Germany _ more than
340,000 left last year and they are fleeing at the rate of nearly
2,000 per day _ was a major factor in the slowdown in growth, ADN
said.
   The agency also reported that a new round of price increases
will make some farm products substantially more expensive starting
Feb. 1.
   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann, visiting East
Berlin, said East Germany would move quickly toward free-market
reforms to spur its sagging, centrally planned economy and make it
appealing to West German businesses.
   Haussmann, attending the first meeting of an inter-German
commission on economic cooperation, said Modrow had accepted an
offer of $3.5 billion in West German aid for East German small and
medium-sized businesses.
   Modrow, a Communist, has sought to draw the inexperienced
popular opposition into accepting direct participation in his
coalition government by offering the reform forces ministerial
posts.
   He had called for talks to begin today, but on Tuesday, leaders
of the splintered pro-democracy forces said they had postponed
negotiations at least until early next week to coordinate their
position.
   The delay showed how hesitant the opposition is to prop up the
government before the country's first free elections May 6 _ when
the Communists are expected to be voted out.
   British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd completed a three-day
visit to East Germany today and said Britain will look for ways to
give economic aid to East Germany, including joint business
projects and training for managers.
   He suggested there are few alternatives to Modrow's interim
government and said further instability could hurt that nation's
move toward democracy.
   ``It is very important that what the prime minister is trying to
do will succeed and that he will have the support to carry this
government through to May 6,'' Hurt said.
   The Communist Party has suffered mass defections since the
peaceful October revolution that brought down its old hard-line
leadership.
   Lothar de Maiziere, chairman of the Christian Democrats, a party
in Modrow's coalition that once was aligned with the Communists,
said he expected the Communists to gain at best 10 percent in the
balloting.
   De Maiziere told West Germany's Bild newspaper he expects about
30 percent of the vote for his party and other newly-founded groups
with a Christian orientation.
   The increasingly influential Social Democratic Party will also
get about 30 percent, de Maiziere predicted in the interview.
   Currently, however, the opposition has difficulty projecting the
impression it could actually run the country. East Germans are
increasingly looking to unification with prosperous West Germany in
hopes for a brighter future.
   Bild on Tuesday quoted an adviser to Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev as saying the Soviets would not block German
reunification if the East Germans want it. But Nikolai Portugalov,
Gorbachev's adviser on German affairs, was also quoted as
cautioning against the forced acceleration of unification because
it could undermine Europe.
   Unrest in the labor force intensified Tuesday, with workers in
six cities staging brief warning strikes to press for higher pay
and better working conditions, ADN said.
   Participating in the stoppages were employees in a psychiatric
hospital in Ueckermuende, some 500 health workers in Suhl, taxi
drivers in Leipzig and bank employees in Quedlinburg district, the
agency said.
   Tuesday's rally of artisans in East Berlin was called on short
notice and against the wishes of top union leaders still loyal to
the Comunist system that rewarded them with comfortable
bureaucratic positions.
   ``We absolutely and unconditionally need conversion to a full
market economy,'' Burkhard Schmidt, spokesman for the Craftmen's
Union, said before the rally.

<HEAD>Mandela, ANC On Agenda For Crucial Cabinet Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ADIL BRADLOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cabinet met today for the
first time this year, with an agenda that included the release of
jailed black leader Nelson Mandela and the possible unbanning of
the African National Congress.
   Decisions reached at the meeting ``will change the face of South
Africa permanently,'' said The Sowetan, the country's largest
black-oriented daily newspaper.
   The Cabinet traditionally does not announce its decisions
immediately after its meetings, and the outcome of today's session
might not be known until President F.W. de Klerk gives a speech
Feb. 2 at the opening of Parliament.
   Mandela, the country's most popular black leader, has been
jailed since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for helping plan
the start of the ANC's anti-government sabotage campaign. The
government has confirmed that he will be freed, and there is strong
speculation the release could occur by mid-February.
   His release is one of several conditions which the ANC says must
be met before it enters negotiations on a new political system that
would extend voting rights to blacks. The outlawed movement also
demands that it be legalized, that the state of emergency imposed
in 1986 be lifted, and that the government halt trials and
executions of political opponents.
   Government officials have indicated that these conditions could
be met, at least to a large extent, leaving the ANC with a decision
as to whether it should join negotiations.
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp., in a commentary
today, said the ANC ``is being forced to move away from a strategy
of violence and towards an acceptance of peaceful negotiation.''
   Mandela, who has been meeting regularly with government and
opposition leaders, last week submitted the outlines of a peace
plan to the ANC's exiled leadership in Lusaka, Zambia.
   Details of the plan have not been disclosed. The Star of
Johannesburg, South Africa's largest daily, said today the reason
for the secrecy was that the plan ``contains proposals which are
either extremely sensitive or embarrassing to the ANC.''
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee, one of the Cabinet members who
has met frequently with Mandela, said Tuesday that the 71-year-old
prisoner might be asked at serve as a mediator between the
government and the ANC.
   The ANC advocates a one-person, one-vote system in which the 28
million blacks would be able to control the government.
   De Klerk envisions some sort of system in which the 5 million
whites would retain a veto over major policy decisions.

   President Bush today defended his opposition
to legislation to protect Chinese students from deportation and
said Congress ``will have only itself to blame'' if it overrides
his veto and Chinese authorities retaliate.
   In a morning news conference, Bush passed judgment on the use of
force by Soviet authorities attempting to put down civil disorder
in the distant region of Azerbaijan but indicated his trust in
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``It is serious,'' he said of the Soviet unrest. Of Gorbachev's
future, he added, ``I hope that he not only survives but stays
strong.''
   Bush faced a challenge to his veto of legislation to protect
Chinese students, at risk due to the anti-Democracy crackdown in
China. The president said he had taken steps to provide protection
to Chinese students studying here at the time of the crackdown in
Tiananmen Square last June. ``Not one was sent back,'' said Bush.
   The House was expected to vote to override the veto by a wide
margin later in the day, and Bush met before his news conference
with Republican senators in hopes of sustaining his veto. Congress
has sustained each of Bush's previous ten vetoes.

<HEAD>Israeli Patrol Exchanges Fire Across Jordanian Border</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers exchanged gunshots across the
Jordanian border near an area where Jordanian troops were
patrolling, but no injuries were reported and no inflitrations
occurred, the army said today.
   It was not clear who fired the opening round from the Jordanian
side in Tuesday's exchange, said an army official, who demanded
anonymity.
   The incident occurred near Moshav Hatzeva, a communal
agricultural settlement about 70 miles southeast of Jerusalem.
   Jordan's policy in the past has been to keep the border with
Israel quiet and to prevent attempts by Palestinian guerrillas to
infiltrate Israel.
   Tuesday's exchange of gunfire was the sixth shooting incident
this year along the Jordan border, the army said.
   On Jan. 7, Israeli troops killed an infiltrator dressed in a
Jordanian army uniform near the northern Israeli resort town of
Tiberias.
   That incident prompted Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin to
issue a tough warning holding Jordan responsible for any border
infiltrations.
   Last year there were seven incidents along the Jordanian border,
including six infiltrations, according to the army.
   Three Israeli soldiers were killed and at least seven soldiers
and civilians were wounded in the 1989 incidents, the army said.

   ``I hope that he not only survives but stays strong because I
think it is in our interest that Perestroika succeeds,'' Bush said.
   Bush was questioned closely about the veto confrontation with
Congress over the Chinese student legislation, and he bristled at
the idea that he was not concerned about human rights.
   ``That is absolutely ridiculous,'' said Bush, whose China policy
has been widely criticized in the months since the pro-democracy
movement in Beijing was crushed by military forces.
   As for the students, Bush said, ``Not one was sent back. They
were safe then and they are safe now and they will be safe in the
future.'' A questioner asked whether the issue with Congress was
one of trust. Many members of Congress were angry or concerned
after learning that Bush had dispatched top administration figures
on a secret trip to China after saying publicly that high level
exchanges were being curtailed due to the June crackdown.
   He said China, faced with the pending legislation, might well
retaliate by cutting off other sorts of academic contacts with the
United States. The price of the legislation ``is lost opportunity
for the scholars of tomorrow ... Congress in my view will have only
itself to blame.''

   Bush also said a plan by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
to reduce Social Security taxes was a ``sleight of hand'' that
could lead to increases in other taxes or to reductions in Social
Security benefits.
   The president also said he had not yet settled on the details of
an aid package for Panama. He said he regretted the loss of
Panamanian lives as much as the lives of Americans lost.
   ``You have to feel concerned about that but you have to look at
the broader picture,'' he said, claiming that a hige majority of
Panamanian citizens approved of the invasion. The Pentagon says
about 200 Panamanian civilians were killed during the fighting last
month.

<TEXT>
   Four of the nation's biggest defense
contractors have asked the government to approve a team effort to
develop the National Aero-Space Plane, a futuristic aircraft that
could go from runway into orbit.
   The move would allow the contractors _ who had been working
independently on the project since 1985 _ to ``get more for our
money,'' Jim Schlueter, a spokesman for St. Louis-based McDonnell
Douglas Corp., said Tuesday.
   The other contractors are General Dynamics Corp., the North
American Aircraft and Rocketdyne divisions of Rockwell
International Corp., and the Pratt &amp; Whitney division of United
Technologies Corp.
   Theoretically, the experimental NASP X-30 aero-space plane would
be capable of flying 25 times the speed of sound and 10 times
faster and three times higher than existing commercial aircraft.
   The companies have created their own designs but have shared
some research, mainly on construction materials. A prototype is
scheduled to be flown in the late 1990s.
   The team agreement is subject to approval by the Air Force, NASA
and the Navy.
   ``We don't anticipate any problems because this is consistent
with the goal of the program,'' said J.W. Stout, a spokesman for
St. Louis-based General Dynamics.
   Stout said the companies have worked together on researching and
testing materials for use in the plane. Finding a material that is
lightweight and can withstand intense heat is one of the linchpins
of the plane's development.
   The team selected Barry Waldman, a veteran of 26 years of
technical and management experience with Rockwell, as program
director.
   The announcement ends a heated battle between Rocketdyne and
Pratt &amp; Whitney for the contracts to build engines for the plane.

<HEAD>High School Begins Program, Testing 14 Students for Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suburban high school's program of random drug
tests on athletes began without protests, but with some raising the
issue of privacy.
   ``It wasn't that bad,'' said Megan Mulcahey, a member of the
girls' basketball team and one of the first group of 14 students
who willingly underwent urine tests Tuesday at Homewood-Flossmoor
High School. ``They treated you nice and everything.''
   Amanda Levenberg, student government president, predicts
opposition will grow as more students are called upon to undergo
the procedure.
   Though not a first nationally, the program has gotten attention
because of its scope. The school plans eventually to test all 1,200
sports participants among its 2,000-member student body.
   ``I was expecting a lot more friction from the student body.
People are complying, and they're not complaining,'' said Miss
Levenberg, 17. ``I think it won't hit kids until they have to go
pee in a cup for someone to test them.''
   Miss Mulcahey said she considers the tests a violation of
privacy that unfairly singles out student athletes.
   ``I don't think it's fair that just us are being tested,'' she
said in a telephone interview. ``If they're going to go ahead and
have that, it should be everyone.''
   The school board approved the program in September at the
suggestion of the football coach, who suspected drug use by a
couple of students, Athletic Director Ken Schultz said.
   Schultz picked the first students to be tested from those
involved in such winter sports as swimming, basketball, wrestling
and gymnastics, and their parents signed consent forms.
   The tests detect use of alcohol, steroids and several other
drugs, including marijuana and cocaine. Students won't know when
they will be tested until their day comes.
   Students and their parents will be notified of results within 48
hours, said Principal Charles Smith. Those who test positive must
see a drug counselor within 48 hours.
   Students determined by the counselor to be abusers will be
suspended from sports and required to undergo treatment. They will
be tested again after 30 days and may return to athletics if they
pass, Smith said. More treatment is ordered for those who don't
pass.
   Schultz said the program probably will be expanded to include
students involved in other extracurricular activities at the
school, whose students come from several upper middle-class,
largely white, southwestern suburbs.
   School officials say the tests will give kids an incentive to
reject drugs.
   ``On weekends, when they go to the parties and alcohol is
served, these kids can say, `No, because I might be tested next
week,''' said Smith.

<HEAD>High School Coaches Applaud District Reversal of Pass-to-Play Rule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coaches applauded the city School Board's
dropping of a policy that barred students who get an ``F'' from
taking part in sports.
   Board members supporting the reversal said they thought the
no-pass, no-play rule adopted seven years ago in the nation's
second-largest school system had discouraged students from taking
challenging courses for fear of failure.
   ``The reality is we have students, in unfortunately large
numbers, who are simply not taking academically challenging
classes,'' said board member Jackie Goldberg.
   The board's 5-2 vote Monday put the Los Angeles district in line
with a 1987 state law requiring students in grades 4 through 12 to
have at least a ``C'' average to participate in sports, music,
drama and other extracurricular activities.
   Los Angeles, which ranks in size behind New York City with
594,000 students, in 1982 became the nation's first major school
district to approve a no-pass, no-play policy. In 1984, Texas
adopted such a law statewide.
   A Los Angeles district study last year found most students,
teachers and counselors supported the rule. Most principals, along
with coaches and others who ran after-school programs opposed it.
   ``I've always been against the no-fail rule and not because I'm
anti-academic,'' said Darryl Stroh, football and baseball coach at
Granada Hills High School. ``The `C' average is a good enough rule.
   ``If a kid takes a fail and the rest of his grades are good
enough to absorb it, then there's no justification for denying him
eligibility.''
   Dissenting were board members Leticia Quezada and Rita Walters,
who introduced the rule. Ms. Quezada characterized the reversal as
``a step backward'' and said it was ``exactly the kind of message
we don't need.''
   ``The message (should be), if you fail in a subject, you must
leave everything behind and focus on your school work,'' she said.
   The board also heard from parents and students, many of whom
opposed dropping the rule.
   ``By repealing the `No-Fail' rule we are compromising academic
excellence,'' said Kerry Lotts, a North Hollywood High School
junior.
   ``If a student fails only one class, how will (he) be able to
have time for these activities?'' Ms. Lotts asked. ``We need to
support a badly eroding system.''

   A free five-day-a-week newspaper on
government, politics and the law, designed for delivery to offices
each morning, will begin publication in Washington on Oct. 1, its
backers said today.
   Roger G. Kranz, publisher of the projected Washington Reporter,
said a 20-page prototype would be published at the end of February.
   Kranz said about 5,000 copies of the prototype would be printed
and the newspaper expects to have a circulation of about 30,000.
   He said the newspaper would be printed and distributed by
contractors.
   In addition to contract distribution to Washington offices,
Kranz said, there would be limited same-day distribution to Wall
Street and midtown Manhattan and to air shuttle terminals in New
York, Boston and Washingtill also be limited newsstand and box sales in
on.
   There wWashington, he said.
   Kranz said it would provide ``news and information on the
federal government, politics, lobbying, law and media for
policymakers and opinion leaders in Washington.''
   He said the newspaper would not provide sports, weather, local
or foreign news coverage, although foreign developments would be
covered from wire services and from embassies and other sources in
Washington.
   He said four-color advertising was planned, including
advertising re he resigned
in August as group vice president in charge of advertising sales,
circulation and manufacturing.
   John S. Prescott Jr., a former president of The Washington Post
and recently retired president of the publications division of
Whitney Communications Co. in New York, will be chairman of the
board.
   The editor will be Barry Sussman, who runs an independent public
opinion polling and consulting company in Washington and formerly
served as an editor with The Washington Post and United Press
International.
   Kranz said he and Prescott are investors in the paper, and
Sussman is not. He declined to name other investors.

   President Bush, lobbying to sustain his veto
of legislation to protect Chinese students from deportation, said
today Congress ``will have only itself to blame'' if it overrides
his veto and authorities in Beijing retaliate.
   In a wide-ranging morning news conference, Bush also sidestepped
a question on the use of force by Soviet authorities attempting to
put down civil disorder in the distant region of Azerbaijan _ but
indicated his trust in Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. ``Anytime
you have a use of force and a loss of life we have concern, but I
don't believe I can judge that right now,'' he said.
   Of Gorbachev's future, he added, ``I hope that he not only
survives but stays strong.''
   The key event today for Bush was congressional consideration of
his veto of the Chinese student legislation. The House was expected
to vote to override the veto later in the day, and Bush met before
his news conference with Republicans in the Senate in hopes of
sustaining his veto there.
   Congress has upheld each of Bush's previous ten vetoes. Bush
said he had taken steps to provide protection to Chinese students
studying here at the time of the crackdown in Tiananmen Square last
June. ``Not one was sent back,'' Bush said of the students. ``They
were safe then and they are safe now and they will be safe in the
future.''
   He said the legislation was unnecessary and suggested it invited
retaliation against American scholars in China.
   But many lawmakers, upset with Bush's diplomatic overtures to
Beijing, favor legislation anyway to give automatic visa protection
to the estimated 32,000 Chinese students in the United States.
   Meeting with reporters four days past his first anniversary in
office, Bush also:
   _ Lambasted a plan by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to
reduce Social Security taxes as a ``sleight of hand'' that could
lead to increases in other taxes or to reductions in Social
Security benefits.
   _ Offered his widely anticipated endorsement for creating a new
Department of the Environment. He said worldwide environmental
challenges are ``so important that they must be addressed at the
highest level.''
   _ Indicated he would soon propose a change in the Pentagon
budget that ``begins the transition'' to a military more geared to
events outside Europe, while ``continuing to meet our inescapable
commitment'' to NATO. Pentagon officials have been studying
alternatives in military spending and strategy in response to the
wave of democracy sweeping Eastern Europe.
   _ Said he would unveil the second phase of his anti-drug
strategy on Thursday, continuing a busy period that includes
submission of his first full budget next Monday and his first State
of the Union address Wednesday night.
   _ Said he had not yet settled on the details of an aid package
for Panama. He said he regretted the loss of Panamanian lives as
much as the lives of Americans lost.
   ``You have to feel concerned about that but you have to look at
the broader picture,'' he said, claiming that a hige majority of
Panamanian citizens approved of the invasion. The Pentagon says
about 200 Panamanian civilians were killed during the fighting last
month.
   Asked about Soviet unrest in Azerbaijan, Bush said he didn't
know whether the volatile situation there posed a threat to
Gorbachev's political survival, but acknowledged, ``He's faced with
an ethnic problem there, an internal problem of enormous
dimensions.''
   ``I hope that he not only survives but stays strong because I
think it is in our interest that Perestroika succeeds,'' Bush said.
   His comments on Social Security were tinged with politics.
``it's a disguise for increased taxes around the corner,'' he said
of Moynihan's proposal. He depicted himself as a Republican
president ``protecting the sanctity'' of Social Security.''
   Moynihan has proposed the cut in taxes, saying payroll taxes are
creating a huge Social Security surplus and masking the true size
of the federal deficit.
   Bush was questioned closely about the veto confrontation with
Congress over the Chinese student legislation, and he bristled at
the idea that he was not concerned about human rights.
   ``That is absolutely ridiculous,'' said Bush, whose China policy
has been widely criticized in the months since the pro-democracy
movement in Beijing was crushed by military forces. Bush drew
especially strong criticism last month for sending two top aides to
Beijing.
   The legislation would extend the stays of thousands of Chinese
students who were in this country when the violence erupted last
June in their homeland.
   He said China, faced with the pending legislation, might well
retaliate by cutting off other sorts of academic contacts with the
United States. The price of the legislation ``is lost opportunity
for the scholars of tomorrow ... Congress in my view will have only
itself to blame.''
   The Senate was Bush's only hope on the Chinese student question,
as administration officials viewed as a lost cause today's override
vote in the House, which voted 403-0 on Nov. 19 for the legislation
Bush vetoed.
   In pocket-vetoing the bill Nov. 30, Bush said he was taking
administrative action instead to ensure no Chinese students were
forced to return to their communist homeland following the brutal
crackdown on democracy demonstrators. A law would just antagonize
Beijing and end the flow of Chinese students, Bush argued.

   Here is the text of President Bush's comments
Wednesday at a news conference:
   Good morning, good morning. Well, as you know, I'll soon present
my budget to the Congress, and as I prepare to do so, it strikes me
that our nation faces challenges on many fronts. So let's give each
the attention it deserves tomorrow.
   I'm going to announce the second phase of our strategy to fight
drugs in the schools and the streets of America. The future of this
country depends on whether we can give our children a chance to
grow up drug-free.
   And secondly, I will soon present our plan to restructure
America's defenses in the wake of the dramatic changes that are
taking place abroad, and I'm proposing a defense budget that begins
the transition to a restructured military, a new strategy that is
more flexible, more geared to contingencies outside of Europe while
continuing to meet our inescapable responsibility to NATO and to
maintaining the global balance.
   And finally, Secretary Brady and Director Darman and Chairman
Boskin will put the details of our budget before the American
people.
   And as that occurs, other members of the administration, the
Cabinet, key agencies will provide an in-depth outline of their
efforts to address the many challenges of caring for the afflicted
and uplifting the poor, cleaning the environment, educating our
kids, as well as other important issues.
   All of this is preparatory to the State of the Union, one week
from today, in which I will speak to the broader issues that we
face as a nation.
   There are two items that I want to mention here today and then
take some questions. First, I've decided that the environmental
challenges that face America and the world are so important that
they must be addressed from the highest level of our government.
   And at the beginning of this century, President Roosevelt,
Theodore Roosevelt, helped pave the way for the establishment of
the national park system. Twenty years ago, President Nixon
established the EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, by executive
order. That is now one of the largest and most important regulatory
agencies in the government.
   And today, I'd like to announce another step forward in this
important tradition of support for conservation and environmental
protection.
   Many countries have environmental ministers, and now _ and with
cabinet status. And I am convinced that that cabinet status will
help influence the world's environmental policy. So, with so many
difficult decisions ahead, I'll need Bill Reilly's counsel, I'll
need him sitting at my side in the cabinet, and I'm pleased to
endorse the elevation of the EPA to cabinet status by creating a
Department of the Environment.
   Senators Glenn and Bill Roth, chairman and ranking members of
the Government _ Senate Government Affairs Committee _ have
introduced legislation that would create this department.
Congressman Conyers and Horton are working on similar legislation.
   And I look forward to working with them and other interested
members of the House and Senate to enact legislation that would
bring EPA to the cabinet table, where it now belongs.
   And now, I'd like to address one other issue that I know is
foremost on your minds. Every American should know _ I want to take
this opportunity to state this as strongly as I can _ that I will
not break faith with the Chinese students here. I have made that
very clear from the very beginning.
   And right after Tiananmen, I moved to protect the Chinese
students in this country. Not one was sent back. They were safe
then, and they are safe now, and they will be safe in the future.
   And when Congress passed the Pelosi bill last fall, I was faced
with a choice. If I signed the bill, the students would still be
safe, but China would retaliate and cut off future student
exchanges.
   You see, I think the exchanges have brought forward the reforms
that have taken place in China. If you look back over your
shoulders for a starting point and compare it to the Cultural
Revolution days, some of the reforms have taken place, steps have
been taken forward, and regrettably, Tiananmen was a step _ a
gigantic step back. But I want to keep contact. I do not want
isolation.
   If I vetoed the bill, I could take action to provide the
students with even greater protection while keeping the door open
for more Chinese scholars to study here. And the price of the
Pelosi bill is lost opportunity.

   President Bush today called Sen. Daniel P.
Moynihan's proposal for a Social Security payroll tax cut ``a
disguise for increased taxes'' and said he will continue to fight
it.
   Bush told a White House news conference he believes Social
Security ``has been basically a pretty fair system'' and this is no
time to change it.
   Moynihan's proposal, formally unveiled Tuesday, would roll back
the Social Security payroll tax rate from the 7.65 percent it
reached Jan. 1 to the previous 7.51 percent. That would save
workers $7 billion this year and $55 billion in fiscal 1991.
   ``We must end the shameful practice of using Social Security
revenues to finance budget deficits,'' said the New York Democrat.
The surplus in Social Security reserves is counted in the budget,
making the overall federal deficit appear smaller than it is.
   The surplus is the result of efforts to build up reserves for
the Baby Boom generation when it reaches retirement age and will
dwindle after the turn of the century.
   But the Bush administration calls the move part of a Democratic
plot to raise other taxes.
   ``I think it's a disguise for increased taxes around the
corner,'' Bush said, ``and I don't want to to see the benefits of
Social Security cut. .. I would say to those around the country,
`Take a hard look now. Don't let that rabbit be pulled out of the
hat'. ''
   ``This is a sleight-of-hand operation here,'' Bush said, noting
that shortly after Moynihan disclosed his idea, another Senate
Democrat, Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, proposed enactment
of a 5 percent national sales levy _ a value-added tax.
   Bush said Moynihan had been a member of the commission that
restructured the Social Security system in 1983. ``I think the Mr.
Moynihan of a few years back ought to talk to the Mr. Moynihan of
today,'' he said.
   ``If we were all starting over, I think we could fine-tune the
entire American tax system,'' Bush said. ``We're not starting over,
and I think that system has been in and out over the years
basically a pretty fair system.''
   On another budget front, Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., introduced
legislation he said would release more than $10.5 billion in
highway money being held in the federal Highway Trust Fund.
   The money represents the accumulated difference between revenues
_ larely from the 9-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax _ and federal
highway authorizations. Critics say the money is deliberately
underspent to keep the deficit low and provide a cheap source for
government borrowing.
   ``Over the last decade the federal government has used the money
collected by the federal gas tax as a deficit-reduction gimmick,''
Bryan said.
   Legislation to elevate the Environmental Protection Agency to
Cabinet level status was introduced in the House and Senate, with
supporters saying they hoped a bill could clear Congress within
several months.
   Bush gave his endorsement to that proposal, saying worldwide
environmental challenges are ``so important that they must be
addressed at the highest level.''
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Government
Operations Committee, also said the EPA needs more clout and higher
visibility because of the importance of environmental issues in the
next decade.
   Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Alan Cranston, D-Calif., moved
to translate changes in the Soviet bloc into less U.S. military
spending. They introduced legislation to cancel the B-1 stealth
bomber program after the 15 bombers now in production are built.
   ``Recent events have made the argument against the B-2 even
stronger,'' said Leahy. He said taxpayers would save $40 billion as
a result.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., introduced a bill she has been
touting since the U.S. invasion of Panama last month that would
remove existing prohibitions on women serving in combat.
   A bill introduced by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., would bar
senators from taking honoraria and limit outside earned income to
15 percent of salary. The measure would bring Senate rules in line
with those approved by the House last year.

<HEAD>Defense Minister Resigns After Disagreement with Army Chief</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with further details on the dispute,
Menem's comment, background on military, government. No pickup.
^By ED McCULLOUGH</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Italo Luder
abruptly resigned today after the army chief of staff met with
President Carlos Menem without informing him.
   ``I gave the president my undeclinable resignation,'' Luder, 73,
told reporters after a half-hour meeting with Menem at Government
House.
   It was the latest crisis facing Menem's government, which has
been beset by economic and military problems since he took office
in July.
   Menem told reporters he had not decided whether to accept what
would be the third Cabinet resignation since he took office, but
the president indicated he sided with the army chief, Gen. Isidro
Caceres, in the dispute.
   Luder imposed an unspecified sanction on Caceres on Tuesday.
   ``It's very possible that by this afternoon I will lift the
sanction,'' Menem said. ``I think in this aspect, Dr. Luder was not
in full knowledge of the facts.'' He did not elaborate.
   Caceres met privately with Menem and Interior Minister Julio
Mera Figueroa on Jan. 17 and discussed matters of internal
security. Luder said he, too, should have been invited.
   Asked why he wasn't, he said in an interview broadcast this
morning by Radio Mitre, ``I don't know.''
   ``When I called him (Caceres) the next day, he didn't give a
satisfactory explanation,'' said Luder, a lawyer and career
politician.
   Neither Menem nor Luder specified Caceres' sanction, but it
could have ranged from a disciplinary hearing to arrest. In any
event, Caceres almost certainly would have been forced to resign,
an army expert said.
   There was no immediate response from Caceres, who helped the
government of then-President Raul Alfonsin put down the Villa
Martelli army insurrection led by then Col. Mohammed Seineldin in
December 1988.
   Though the uprising was quelled and Seineldin forced into
retirement, the army remains divided between a nationalist sector
that wants a greater say in politics, and the sector led by Caceres
that has stayed out of politics.
   ``We believe that the solution to (Argentina's) problems should
come from ... the political parties, the political leaders,''
Caceres said last month.
   Luder's resignation comes at a time when the government has
failed to solve several problems in the military, including low pay
for soldiers, poor equipment, and a budget so small that the number
of conscripts this year was reduced.
   There was little indication beforehand that Luder and Caceres
were at odds, although Caceres had complained about the military's
low budget and had spoken of the climate of social unrest in this
South American country that is beset by inflation and recession.
   Also, Caceres publicly called for the release from prison of
four former commanders of the military juntas that ruled Argentina
from 1976 to 1983.
   Two former presidents and generals, Jorge Videla and Roberto
Viola, were convicted of human rights abuses committed during the
so-called ``dirty war'' on leftist subversion.
   A government commission reported in 1984 that at least 8,960
alleged leftists were arrested and presumed executed by the
military.
   The generals and three other officers convicted at the same time
were not included in a presidential pardon in October of officers
and alleged left-wing terrorists. Menem said the pardon was
necessary for national conciliation.
   Since he took office, Menem has faced a series of crises, most
of them economic. In that time he has had three economic ministers
and three Central Bank presidents quit.
   Menem has promised to combat Argentina's chronic economic
stagnation by curtailing a budget deficit that is seen as the prime
cause of inflation, attracting foreign investment and selling
state-owned money-losing companies.
   But interest rates have topped 600 percent a month and dollar
buying has been rampant.
   The austral, Argentina's currency, lost nearly 50 percent of its
value in December and there was widespread panic buying and
hoarding by shoppers.
   From December to Jan. 3 the government six times ordered banks
and foreign exchange houses to remain closed to hold down inflation
and stabilize the austral.

   Two Moslem teen-agers banned from
school for wearing religious head scarves were allowed to return to
class today, and they received a rousing welcome from their
classmates.
   Fatima and Aisha Alvi trudged up the snow-covered driveway at
Altrincham Grammar School for Girls near Manchester to be greeted
by their friends who leaned out of windows and cheered them in.
   Fatima, 15, smiled and said: ``All we want to do is get back to
school and back to work.'' Her 14-year-old sister said: ``We are
glad it is all over.''
   The girls had been sent home every school day since Dec. 14 when
they began wearing their scarves to school. Islamic law requires
girls past puberty to cover their heads in the presence of men who
are not close relatives. Three men teach at the school of 727
students, and there is a male caretaker.
   The school argued the scarves were a safety danger to the girls
in school laboratories and the gymnasium.
   After a two-hour meeting Tuesday night, school governors changed
their minds but said the scarves must be blue to match the school's
uniforms and must be removed during science and physical education
classes because of the safety concerns.
   In October, three Moslem girls in Creil, north of Paris, were
banned from school because they refused to remove their scarves.
France's state school system bans all outward signs of religion.
   The dispute caused public demonstrations and became a national
political issue. France's highest administrative authority, the
Council of State, ruled in November that Moslem girls may wear
scarves to school as long as it causes no disruption.

<HEAD>Two R.I. Cities Promote Prenatal Care Through Lottery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Have a healthy baby and win a prize _
that's the message behind the Healthy Baby Lottery, an effort to
get women to seek prenatal care early in their pregnancy.
   The Blackstone Valley Perinatal Network and Pawtucket's Memorial
Hospital, with a $15,000 grant from the March of Dimes, will kick
off the lottery Feb. 1.
   The program seeks to encourage women, especially poor women, to
seek health care in the first three months of pregnancy, when the
fetus is especially vulnerable to damage from drugs, disease and
poor diet.
   ``We know of no other program in the country like this,'' said
Dr. Larry Culpepper of the hospital's department of family medicine
and the Brown University medical school.
   The lottery is open to any woman who is less than 12 weeks
pregnant, lives in Central Falls or Pawtucket, and seeks prenatal
care from a doctor in one of those cities.
   Up for grabs will be six monthly prizes ranging from $25 to
$100, with winners' names drawn from entry forms women fill out in
their doctors' offices.
   Women who keep all doctor's appointments throughout their
pregnancy will be eligible for a $500 grand prize awarded every six
months.
   If the two-year project is successful, the lottery may be
expanded statewide, Culpepper said Tuesday.
   From the March of Dimes funding, $7,000 will go toward prizes,
and the rest for administration and publicity. The agency, which
fights birth defects, chose Pawtucket and Central Falls because of
the high concentration of poor people and minorities.
   ``For every $1 we spend on prenatal care, we save $3'' by
preventing sickness and prematurity, said Bernadette M. Farina,
executive director of the organization's Rhode Island chapter.
   Culpepper said there are higher rates of prematurity, birth
defects, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, stillbirth and infant
death when the mother does not see a doctor in the first 12 weeks
of pregnancy.
   He said poor women, teen-agers, single women, recent immigrants
and minority-group women are least likely to seek prenatal
treatment.
   Organizers were worried initially about the propriety of using a
lottery for health promotion, but the prospect of reaching a
hard-to-reach group took precedence, Culpepper said.
   ``We decided to take the risk that it would come across as a
little tacky,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bush Says He Hopes Gorbachev Stays Strong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said today he hopes Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``not only survives but stays
strong'' in the face of crises triggered by a separatist rebellion
in the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan and ethnic unrest in the
Baltics.
   Bush told a news conference Gorbachev is being challenged by
``an internal problem of enormous dimensions.''
   Asked if the Soviet president had gone too far in trying to
quell the violence in Azerbaijan, Bush said, ``Any time you have a
use of force and the loss of life, we are concerned. But I don't
believe I can judge that question right now.''
   Soviet troops killed dozens of people Saturday in storming the
capital city of Baku to end bloody ethnic clashes that erupted Jan.
13 with anti-Armenian rioting. After 11 days of violence, the
official death toll stood at 170.
   The uprising is considered the most serious crisis for Gorbachev
in his five years as Soviet leader.
   While expressing support for the Soviet leader, Bush declined to
predict whether Gorbachev would survive the test.
   ``We don't really know. It is serious,'' Bush said.
   He said the Soviet leader ``has always indicated a desire to
restrain _ for peaceful change inside the Soviet Union. ... But I
don't know (about his future), I can't make predictions about that.
   ``But I know that I hope that he not only survives but stays
strong because I think it is in our interest that perestroika
(Gorbachev's program of economic and political restructuring)
succeed and go forward,'' Bush said.
   He restated the long-held position that the United States does
not recognize the incorporation of the Baltic states of Latvia,
Lithuanian and Estonia into the Soviet Union.
   ``However,'' Bush said, ``what I say that we want to do is to
encourage Mr. Gorbachev's stand that peaceful change is the order
of the day, and he's sorting out some very difficult internal
problems in these three Baltic countries.
   ``I don't think it helps, facilitates things, for us to fine
tune all that,'' Bush said. ``They know our position,'' he added,
saying it was a subject that he discussed with Gorbachev during
their summit in Malta in early December.
   ``In looking at the Soviet scene there, he is still adhering as
best he can to the concept of peaceful change in the Baltics, and
that's got to dominate,'' Bush said.

   President Bush, fighting to sustain his veto
of legislation to protect Chinese students from deportation, today
warned Congress it ``will have only itself to blame'' if it
overrides him and Beijing retaliates with more repression.
   In a wide-ranging morning news conference, Bush also sidestepped
a question on the use of force by Soviet authorities attempting to
put down civil disorder in the distant region of Azerbaijan _ but
indicated his trust in Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``Anytime you have a use of force and a loss of life we have
concern, but I don't believe I can judge that right now,'' he said.
   Of Gorbachev's future, he added, ``I hope that he not only
survives but stays strong.''
   The key event today for Bush was congressional consideration of
his veto of the Chinese student legislation. The House was expected
to vote to override the veto later in the day, and Bush met before
his news conference with Republicans in the Senate in hopes of
sustaining his veto there on Thursday.
   Congress has upheld each of Bush's previous ten vetoes. Bush
said he had taken steps to provide protection to Chinese students
studying here at the time of the crackdown in Tiananmen Square last
June. ``Not one was sent back,'' Bush said of the students. ``They
were safe then and they are safe now and they will be safe in the
future.''
   He said the legislation was unnecessary and suggested it invited
retaliation against American scholars in China.
   But many lawmakers, upset with Bush's diplomatic overtures to
Beijing, favor legislation anyway to give automatic visa protection
to the estimated 32,000 Chinese students in the United States.
   Meeting with reporters four days past his first anniversary in
office, Bush also:
   _ Lambasted a plan by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to
reduce Social Security taxes as a ``sleight of hand'' that could
lead to increases in other taxes or to reductions in Social
Security benefits.
   _ Offered his widely anticipated endorsement for creating a new
Department of the Environment. He said worldwide environmental
challenges are ``so important that they must be addressed at the
highest level.''
   _ Indicated he would soon propose a change in the Pentagon
budget that ``begins the transition'' to a military more geared to
events outside Europe, while ``continuing to meet our inescapable
commitment'' to NATO. Pentagon officials have been studying
alternatives in military spending and strategy in response to the
wave of democracy sweeping Eastern Europe.
   _ Said he would unveil the second phase of his anti-drug
strategy on Thursday, continuing a busy period that includes
submission of his first full budget next Monday and his first State
of the Union address Wednesday night.
   _ Said he had not yet settled on the details of an aid package
for Panama. He said he regretted the loss of Panamanian lives as
much as the lives of Americans lost.
   ``You have to feel concerned about that but you have to look at
the broader picture,'' he said, claiming that a hige majority of
Panamanian citizens approved of the invasion. The Pentagon says
about 200 Panamanian civilians were killed during the fighting last
month.
   _ Called ``pure, unadulterated malarkey'' a Newsweek magazine
report that Bush, his wife Barbara and family were deeply divided
over abortion. Bush defended his support for a constitutional
amendment to outlaw most abortions, saying, ``I was elected to try
to fulfill the platform and the programs that I believe in. And so
that's my personal choice, but that doesn't mean I have lack of
respect for others.''
   Asked about Soviet unrest in Azerbaijan, Bush said he didn't
know whether the volatile situation there posed a threat to
Gorbachev's political survival, but acknowledged, ``He's faced with
an ethnic problem there, an internal problem of enormous
dimensions.''
   ``I hope that he not only survives but stays strong because I
think it is in our interest that Perestroika succeeds,'' Bush said.
   His comments on Social Security were tinged with politics.
``it's a disguise for increased taxes around the corner,'' he said
of Moynihan's proposal. He depicted himself as a Republican
president ``protecting the sanctity'' of Social Security.''
   Moynihan has proposed the cut in taxes, saying payroll taxes are
creating a huge Social Security surplus and masking the true size
of the federal deficit.
   Bush was questioned closely about the veto confrontation with
Congress over the Chinese student legislation, and he bristled at
the idea that he was not concerned about human rights.
   ``That is absolutely ridiculous,'' said Bush, whose China policy
has been widely criticized in the months since the pro-democracy
movement in Beijing was crushed by military forces. Bush drew
especially strong criticism last month for sending two top aides to
Beijing.
   The legislation would extend the stays of thousands of Chinese
students who were in this country when the violence erupted last
June in their homeland.
   He said China, faced with the pending legislation, might well
retaliate by cutting off other sorts of academic contacts with the
United States. The price of the legislation ``is lost opportunity
for the scholars of tomorrow ... Congress in my view will have only
itself to blame.''
   The Senate was Bush's only hope on the Chinese student question,
as administration officials viewed as a lost cause today's override
vote in the House, which voted 403-0 on Nov. 19 for the legislation
Bush vetoed.
   In pocket-vetoing the bill Nov. 30, Bush said he was taking
administrative action instead to ensure no Chinese students were
forced to return to their communist homeland following the brutal
crackdown on democracy demonstrators. A law would just antagonize
Beijing and end the flow of Chinese students, Bush argued.

<HEAD>Van Gogh From Met to Be Auctioned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A painting by Vincent van Gogh, loaned to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1984, will leave the museum to be
auctioned for an expected price of up to $50 million, Christie's
auction house says.
   The painting, ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet,'' is from the collection
of Siegfried Kramarsky, a German-born New York banker who died in
1961. It is being sold by a trust created under his will.
   Museum director Philippe de Montebello said he was not surprised
that such a painting was headed for the auction block. ``The
reduced tax advantages to collectors and the increased sale
potential are a combination that is irresistible to collectors and
fatal to museums,'' he said.
   The portrait of Dr. Paul-Ferdinand Gachet was painted six weeks
before van Gogh committed suicide in 1890.
   It will be auctioned May 15, almost precisely 100 years after it
was finished.
   Gachet, a practitioner of homeopathic medicine, was van Gogh's
physician and a friend of Impressionist painters. The doctor, an
artist himself, is shown seated at a table, head in hand, with what
van Gogh called ``the broken-hearted expression of our time.''
   Van Gogh painted a slightly larger version with less detail and
flatter colors. It hangs in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris.
   Another van Gogh, ``Irises,'' was sold at auction in 1987 for
$53.9 million, making it the world's most expensive painting. That
sale, however, was made with a loan from Sotheby's auction house;
when the buyer failed to pay what was owed, the deal fell through.

   If I vetoed the bill, I could take action to provide the
students with even greater protection while keeping the door open
for more Chinese scholars to study here. And the price of the
Pelosi bill is lost opportunity for the Chinese scholars of
tomorrow. And people should understand that very, very clearly.
   The bill is totally unnecessary. The long-term policy
consequences are potentially great. And Congress, in my view, will
have only itself to blame.
   I can understand their emotion, but we've got to look at policy
and we've got to be fair in what has already been accomplished by
the Executive Order. It's a strong message. I want it to be seen
exactly that way.
   And now I'd be delighted to take any questions. Terry and then
Helen.
   Q: Mr. President, how serious a crisis is the nationalist
rebellion in Azerbaijan for President Gorbachev? And what are the
chances that he'll survive this test and the challenge from the
Baltics?
   A: Well, I think the answer to your question unfolds every day.
We don't really know. And it is serious. The _ Gorbachev has always
indicated a desire to restrain _ for peaceful change inside the
Soviet Union. And I refer to what he said on the Baltics. He's
faced with an ethnic problem here and an internal problem of
enormous dimensions.
   But I don't know, Terry, I can't make predictions about that.
But I know that I hope that he not only survives but stays strong
because I think it is in our interest that perestroika succeed and
go forward.
   Q: Well, can I just follow up on that?
   A: Sure.
   Q: Do you think that he's gone too far in the crack-down in Baku?
   A: Any time you have a use of force and the loss of life, we are
concerned. But I don't believe I can judge that question right now.
   Q: Mr. President, you're very concerned with drugs and drugs are
intimately connected now to guns. What is it _ what do you tell
your grandchildren in why you would ban semi-automatic foreign-made
guns and not domestically produced? There are two students who were
killed in the last 10 days, high school students here. Aren't you
deeply concerned? I mean, where is the lethal _ legal justification
   A: I am concerned and I just don't happen to believe the banning
of weapons will take them out of the hands of the criminals. And
we've seen state law after state law violated by the bad guys
getting the weapons. And I believe that, so I don't want to go for
more federal gun control. I'm not going to do it. We've taken some
steps that I think are helpful.
   Q: Well, we are sending weapons, though, to Colombia and so
forth that are made in this country. How do you stop that?
   A: To Colombia?
   Q: And to other places where they're getting in.
   A: Well, if they're going to the Colombian government, I
wouldn't stop it, and if they're going to the bad guys, we would
undergo every possible _ follow every possible avenue to stop it.
Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, back on China for a moment. It appears your
veto will be overridden in the House today. That would require
Senate action for the job to be complete. I know you met with
Senate leaders this morning. Are you confident that just these
remarks you've made out here today and whatever else you may have
said will be enough or do you really feel that the Chinese
leadership with whom you have dealt for so long kind of let you
down here and didn't give you a strong enough hand?
   A: What I did in talking to the Senate leaders this morning _
the Republicans _ is to cite certain things that _ steps that China
has taken.
   They've accepted the Peace Corps volunteers. You see, I think
that's good. People will say, ``Well, in the face of Tianamen,
that's not good. I think it is good because I think cultural
contacts, educational contacts will benefit in the long run
democracy and reform in China. They've accredited a VOA
correspondent, who as you know were kicked out.
   They've muted the hostile propaganda against Americans and
stopped harrassing the US embassy. That's good. That's important to
me as president who feels a certain responsibility for the people
there.
   They've given some assurances on missile sales. I want to see
them follow up, but I think that's positive. They've reopened the
Fulbright exchanges. I think that's good and I think that's
positive.
   And I think if we let Congress have its head and do what is
emotionally popular, these things would be changed. They've lifted
martial law. I don't know a single member of Congress that, if I
had said to them, ``Look, we think by sending General Scowcroft and
Larry Eagleburger over there we can get martial law lifted, do you
think it's worth it,'' I think most would have said, ``Sure, that
would be a good step.''

<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered a new murder trial for a
former plumber charged with setting off the remote-controlled car
bomb that killed Arizona Republic investigative reporter Don Bolles
in 1976.
   James Robison, 67, who is in prison on an unrelated assault
charge, was scheduled for arraignment Feb. 2 after Superior Court
Judge Thomas O'Toole ordered him Tuesday to stand trial.
   Robison and Max Dunlap were found guilty in the Bolles killing
in 1977, but their convictions were overturned in 1980 because the
defense wasn't allowed to question a witness adequately. Dunlap has
not been charged again.
   A third man, John Harvey Adamson, was convicted in the slaying
and is in prison. His death sentence was overturned.
   The motive for the slaying of Bolles, 47, at a Phoenix hotel has
remained murky, with a tangle of theories involving the mob, race
track owners, casino skimming and crooked bankers. No mastermind
has been charged.
   Prosecution witnesses presented little that was new during a
four-day preliminary hearing. But Attorney General Bob Corbin said
Tuesday, ``Nobody ever puts on all of the good stuff at the
preliminary hearing.''
   Robison, formerly of suburban Chandler, did not testify, but
prosecutors introduced a transcript of an unpublished interview
Robison gave magazine writers in 1979 in which he denied killing
Bolles but acknowledged having seen the remote control and
withholding information from police.

   It happens and we see a lot of criticism of it. They've released
573 people that were detained after last June's events. And you can
argue about any one of these points.
   But I asked the Senate and the House _ a little late for that
one _ the Senate to take a look at these things and put it in the
totality of a policy and you see, I think there are some real
reasons, Asian reasons, if you will, Cambodia and Japan, that we
should retain relations with China. That doesn't mean we endorse
the lack of human rights.
   I tell you, one of the criticisms that gets to me a little _ and
I vowed _ I didn't tell you my New Year's resolution was not to let
it get to me _ but it is the idea that I don't care about human
rights. That is absolutely ridiculous. I want to see China move
forward, and some think isolation, some think a railroad up there
in the Congress is going to do it. And I don't think so. I think
we're handling it pretty well. Brit?
   Q: Mr. President, did you in any way convey to the Chinese
leaders the idea that these steps taken so far would be enough to
head off this action taken by Congress which they must ...
   A: We didn't give a timetable, but we've encouraged in every way
we can these and more. But I'm just asking that people look at them.
   I have not seen, and maybe it's my fault, one account on
whatever media of these steps put together as a package. I haven't
seen one.
   So I'd like to suggest to the Congress that are debating this to
take a hard look at this and see whether it's progress, whether it
adds up to anything, or as some of our critics would say, ``It's
pure, you know, boilerplate.'' Yes, Lesley?
   Q: Mr. President, in the voting, in the House particularly, you
seem to be conceding that that's gone for you. Do you think that
there's a _ there's a problem of trust here with you? Are they
saying they don't trust you to go forward on this student thing?
After all, you told them you weren't going to have high-level
exchanges, and while you were telling them that, you were sending a
high-level delegation. Do you have a credibility problem?
   A: But where was the exchange in that? What the exchange was,
Lesley, was when the Secretary of Commerce was going to go to China
and be _ in an exchange visit arranged by their Commerce Minister.
That was cancelled.
   Q:Yeah, but they obviously thought it included high-level
contact. The question is is ...
   A: Who were they?
   Q: ... do you think you have a problem with them not trusting
you because of that?
   A: No, I don't think it's a question of trust. I think the
students have done a very good job presenting their case to the
Congress. I think there's some politics involved, crass politics.
When you hear name calling, when you hear people saying ``kowtow,''
that is not the kindest word to say ``we have an honest policy
difference with this president.'' And so there's some politics
involved in this as well.
   And _ but I think there's some genuine feeling that these
students have a very good case. And what I want to do is make the
case that the way to continue reforms and have reform go forward is
not through isolation and unilateral congressional action, but
through the kinds of contacts that I foresee and through the _ and
encouraging the kind of steps that have already been taken.
   Q: You talk about the lifting of martial law. What about the
situation as it exists without the gesture? Are you at all
disturbed that the repression goes on? Could you ...
   A: Yes. I'm very much concerned about the status quo. And I was
terribly concerned at the time of the Cultural Revolution, when we
made the original contact with China. And it was a good thing we
did, because you began through contacts with the West to see China
pull out of this ``Middle Kingdom'' syndrome and move forward.
   And I think I know enough about it that in China you get a
couple of steps forward and then somebody steps back. You know,
look at Deng Xiaoping's own _ own history. I think he was out three
times and in four. And some will argue, ``Well, he's part of the
problem.'' He's now retired. But the reforms, particularly on the
economic side, that brought a new level of prosperity to the
Chinese people really was started by him.
   So I'm not giving up on _ I mean, I'm not accepting the status
quo at all. And China knows my position on this. But it's _ I do
think that there's some indignation about students, there is some
feeling that _ I'm talking about the Congress now _ there's a lot
here of empathy with the students, right here, but I think there's
also a dose of political rhetoric up there that certainly has
diminished the other side.
   And I will readily concede, maybe I could have done better and
sooner in presenting the facts of this case. The Attorney General's
doing a good job telling the _ you know, the differences between
the Pelosi bill and what we've already accomplished. But I don't
know where we'll come out, but I'm going to keep on working the
policy. Yes? We'll come over here, John, and then Charles.

   Iran-Contra arms supplier Richard Secord today
was sentenced to two years' probation for concealing from
congressional investigators the fact that he paid for a $13,800
security system at Oliver North's home.
   Secord, who was enlisted by North to airlift supplies to the
Nicaraguan rebels and assist the Reagan administration's secret
arms shipments to Iran, has already suffered enough in the scandal,
said U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson.
   Secord pleaded guilty Nov. 8 to making a false statement to
congressional investigators. He could have faced up to five years
in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   ``It is my judgment that there has been punishment in this
case,'' Robinson told the retired Air Force major general.
   Secord's lawyer, Thomas Green, told the judge that his client's
life has been ``in tatters'' since October 1986, when one of the
airplanes in North's aid network was shot down over Nicaragua while
carrying supplies for the rebels.
   The shootdown, which took place in the last days of a
congressional ban on military aid to the Contras, led to the
exposure of the secret resupply network overseen by North, then a
National Security Council aide, from his offices in the Old
Executive Office Building next to the White House.
   Iran-Contra prosecutor Reid Weingarten contended that Secord
should be treated more harshly than North and former national
security adviser Robert McFarlane, who also were sentenced to
probation in the affair.
   ``I deeply regret not being more candid'' with congressional
investigators about the `Enterprise' and North, Secord told the
judge. ``If I could correct this I certainly would. I will regret
it for the rest of my life.''
   The Enterprise was the maze of offshore companies and Swiss bank
accounts in the Iran-Contra scandal from which money was withdrawn
by Secord to pay for North's home security system.
   Green said he and Secord were ``very pleased'' with the sentence
and that Secord is ``now in a position to get on with his life.''
Secord was assessed a standard $50 in court costs.
   Weingarten told the judge that Secord, unlike North and
McFarlane, had the benefit of personal legal counsel before making
his false statement to congressional investigators, which occurred
in 1987 after the Iran-Contra scandal had had come into public view.
   North was convicted of three crimes, including aiding and
abetting an obstruction of Congress in 1986 in connection with a
shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran in November 1985.
   McFarlane pleaded guilty to four counts of withholding
information from Congress in connection with inquiries about
whether secret assistance was going to the Contras.
   Weingarten also urged Judge Robinson to consider the fact that
North and McFarlane committed their crimes in the context of their
feeling that ``they had a higher duty.''
   North and McFarlane were cases of ``misguided patriotism,'' said
Weingarten, while ``we think General Secord has no such defense.''
   ``The best that can be said'' of Secord's false statement is
that he was motivated by the ``embarrassment'' of having paid for
North's home security system, said the prosecutor.
   ``The worst'' that can be said is that he was trying to avoid
``the consequences of providing benefits to Colonel North,'' said
Weingarten.
   ``This is the stuff of routine felonies,'' said the prosecutor.
   Secord is the fifth person sentenced in the Iran-Contra affair.
No one has been given any jail time.
   In court papers, Iran-Contra prosecutors noted that Secord had
been quoted as saying recently that the government's version of the
facts in the case was ``asinine'' and that Arthur Liman, chief
counsel to the Senate Iran-Contra committee, was a ``sleaze.''
   ``While the government does not dispute that the defendant has
suffered as a result of this case, it observes that his fall has
not been accompanied by any public contrition,'' said the court
filing. The article in which Secord was quoted appeared in the
January issue of Vanity Fair magazine.
   In allowing Secord to plead guilty, the government agreed to
drop its prosecution of him on 11 other charges, including
allegations he lied to Congress by denying he made more than $1
million in profits.
   Secord, who has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, has not
``recanted or modified much of the testimony regarding his
financial activity,'' said a court filing Tuesday by Iran-Contra
prosecutors. Secord testified he made only his $6,000-a-month
salary in the affair.
   The prosecutors urged Robinson ``to find a sentence ... that
balances the significant good'' the retired Air Force general has
done in the past ``with the need to re-emphasize that our system of
government ... will not tolerate intentional disrespect'' for the
telling the truth while under oath.
   Secord denied the differences with prosecutors concern a
significant portion of his congressional testimony.
   ``By our count, only about a dozen of his answers were even
contested by the government,'' Secord's lawyers said in a court
filing.
   They said the government was trying to circumvent the plea
bargaining agreement, in which prosecutors said they would not
recommend a specific sentence.
   ``It is fundamentally unfair for the government to implore this
court to sentence General Secord on the basis of offenses for which
he was never convicted,'' said his lawyers.

<HEAD>Bush Backs Making EPA a Cabinet-Level Department</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush, saying that environmental
challenges ``are so important that they must be addressed at the
highest level of government,'' today endorsed elevating the
Environmental Protection Agency to a Cabinet-level Department of
the Environment.
   At a news conference in the White House briefing room, the
president backed legislation that has been introduced in Congress
with bipartisan support.
   ``I am convinced that Cabinet status will help influence the
world's environmental policies,'' he said, noting that many nations
have environmental ministries.
   Bush's announcement represented a switch in his attitude toward
creating a new Cabinet department. During his first year in office,
he had opposed expansion of the Cabinet.
   The EPA, an independent regulatory agency created in 1970 to
enforce environmental laws, would become the 15th Cabinet agency.
   The president met with sponsors of the legislation before
announcing his endorsement and said he would work with Congress to
draft acceptable legislation.
   Bush made the announcement in an opening statement in which he
touched on a wide range of topics.
   ``I've decided that the environmental challenges that face
America and the world are so important that they must be addressed
at the highest level of government,'' he said.
   Bush said EPA, now headed by Administrator William Reilly, is
``one of the largest and most important regulatory agencies in the
government'' and called elevation of it to Cabinet status ``another
step forward ... in support of conservation and environmental
protection.''
   Reilly said ``the elevation of EPA is an important environmental
milestone.''
   Leaders of the House and Senate Government Operations Committees
introduced bipartisan legislation Tuesday that would create a
Department of the Environment and make the EPA administrator part
of the Cabinet as environmental secretary.
   Similar legislation has been introduced in the past, but made
little headway without support from the White House.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Government
Operations Committee, said the EPA as a regulatory agency without
Cabinet status ``doesn't send the appropriate signal to the rest of
the world'' at a time when critical environmental issues are global
in nature.
   ``Environmental concerns have induced every major industrialized
nation to create a ministerial post for environmental protection
with the only exception being the United States,'' said Glenn at a
news conference.
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., another cosponsor and the ranking GOP
member on the committee, called raising the EPA's status ``a first
step to reorganizing government to face the problems of the '90s
and the first problems of the 21st Century.''
   In the House, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., chairman of the House
Government Operations Committee, promised to push the EPA bill to
the floor as quickly as possible and said he hoped legislation
could be ready for the president's signature by the 20th
anniversary of Earth Day in late April.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said Cabinet rank would give the
EPA additional cout needed to deal with other parts of the
government on environmental issues. ``Too often EPA's initiatives
have been ignored or stymied,'' he said.
   In addition to giving the EPA Cabinet rank, the House and Senate
bills call for creating a presidential commission to examine the
effects of current environmental laws and recommend ways to
streamline them.
   The bills also would create an agency within the new
Cabinet-level department to assemble environmental statistics
similar to the way the Bureau of Labor Statistics provides
employment and other economic data.
   ``This (legislation) alone will not solve our environmental
challenges, but it's an important first step in giving the
environment the priority attention for which it badly cries out,''
said Conyers.

   Q: Mr. President, given the weakness of the dollar and the
turmoil in the financial markets and the recent poor economic
indicators, what are you going to do to calm the economy _ calm the
markets and keep the economy from sliding into a recession?
   A: Well, one thing I'm not going to do is comment on levels of
the market, except to say that there's been a substantial increase
over the last year, and some are reading the recent couple of days
as corrections, although I gather it recovered a little bit
yesterday, and the market has always been an indicator, and it's
been one that's been read quite positively.
   But I don't want to get into market levels. What I do want to do
is establish sound policies, and I'm convinced that if we can get
the cooperation of Congress that we need on reducing the deficit,
that that will go a long way, not market prices but in terms of the
fundamentals on the economy. It's slowed down a little. There's a
lot of prediction that it will be slow for a while and then have a
rather robust step-up come summer.
   But I don't know. All I know is that we've got to not bash
anybody but get out there and try to enact policies that will help
keep the longest recovery in modern history going.
   Q: You said that you felt that there was room for further
reduction of interest rates. Given the need to attract foreign
investment from overseas where rates are high, how do you square
that with your call for lower interest rates?
   A: You mean to attract --
   Q: Attract foreign investment to cover the U.S. deficit and yet
though we're competing against the foreign investment _
   A: I think that people see U.S. _ the U.S. still, regardless of
what's temporary out there, as the safest haven for investment
anywhere in the world, and I want to conduct the fiscal policies of
this government so they will continue to see it that way. John,
then Charles, then we'll take --
   Q: Going back to the vote on the Chinese student visas, you and
your people have been trying to get that vote delayed. Is that
because you have some indications from the Chinese that they may
soon release Fang Lizhi ...
   A: No.
   Q: ... and if this vote goes against you, it could hurt his
chances?
   A: No, it is not, but I don't think it will help his chances.
But I would love to see that step taken by the Chinese. But it
isn't _ there's not a _ I think we're reconciled to the fact that
the vote will go forward tomorrow in the Senate.
   Q: When you try to defend your China policy, one thing you never
do is talk about the ``China card.'' You seem to hate that
expression, even though when Kissinger and Nixon were doing it, it
was considered a master stroke of foreign policy, playing the
Chinese off against the Soviets. If Gorbachev does fall from power
and is succeeded by men whose role model is Joe Stalin, aren't you
going to have to play the China card, too?
   A: I don't think you ``play a card.'' I think that's
gratuitously offensive to the Soviets and to the Chinese. But one
of the reasons I want to stay engaged is that there are
geopolitical reasons to have good relations or improved relations
even under these unsatisfactory conditions. And it's going to be
hard to do because of the human rights setback.
   But I want to have some contact. I want to retain contact
because, as you look around the world, take a look at Cambodia.
Take a look at Japan. Take a look at a lot of countries in the
Pacific. China is a key player. And I'd like to think that our
representations will have them move forward on the human rights
side so we can have a more normalized relationship with them.
   Q: Mr. President, regarding the Soviet Union, have you in the
course of these events going on in Baku, or any of your senior
people _ I see General Scowcroft is here _ been in touch with Mr.
Gorbachev or his people to discuss how severe it is, and ...
   A: Well, we've had contact with them. I don't remember when my
last contact was with Mr. Gorbachev, but it didn't relate
specifically to the Baku.
   Q: Could I then follow, sir, to ask you to reconcile, if you
can, the position that you've taken that you say you want Mr.
Gorbachev to survive and succeed, and on the other hand, you have
areas of the Soviet Union such as the Baltics that you do not
recognize as being part of the Soviet Union, and where you say you
favor an independent pursuit of their own destiny. Does he succeed
if they secede?
   A: Well, he _ that's again, at this juncture the U.S. position
is well known, and you've stated it correctly, that we have not
recognized the status of the Baltics.
   However, what I say that we want to do is to encourage Mr.
Gorbachev's stand that peaceful change is the order of the day. And
he's sorting out some very difficult internal problems in these
three Baltic countries. And I don't think it helps facilitate
things for us to fine tune all that. They know our position. I
talked to him about this, incidentally, at Malta.
   But the thing I think is that, in looking at the Soviet scene
there, that he is still adhering as best he can to the concept of
peaceful change in the Baltics. And that's got to dominate.

<HEAD>Former Slovak Party Boss Charged With Abuse of Power</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two more Communist officials have
been charged with abuse of political power, the Communist Party's
daily newspaper said today.
   The officials were identified as former Slovak party First
Secretary Ignac Janak and Jan Svab, former head of the party's
economic department.
   ``Ignac Janak was given a loan out of the operational funds of
the party, which in itself is a misdemeanor or a criminal act,''
the newspaper Rude Pravo said.
   ``It is true that I. Janak paid the loan back, but circumstances
of the whole case must be re-examined,'' the paper added.
   The date of the indictments against the men was not disclosed.
The newspaper did not specify the charges against Svab, but it
appeared he also would be tried in connection with the loan.
   Former Communist officials have been under investigation for
possible abuse of power since the nation's peaceful revolution in
November.
   Miroslav Stepan, the former Prague Party boss blamed for the
bloody crackdown on student demonstrators that led to the
revolution, was charged in December with abuse of political power.
   The revolution led to the downfall of the Communist government.
The Communist Party then relinquished its constitutionally
guaranteed monopoly on power, and free elections were tentatively
set for June.
   The nation also plans to move toward a free-market economy and
strengthen ties with the West as part of the democratic reforms
that have swept the rest of the East bloc.
   In another development today, a Czechoslovak community took out
an ad in one of West Germany's most respected daily newspapers to
offer its statue of Josef Stalin to collectors for $50,000.
   The advertisement in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, placed
by officials in the north Moravian city of Zabreh, said the
larger-than-life statue was dismantled Dec. 8 after residents made
it clear they wanted it out.
   ``The new owner will not only get a unique curiosity, he will
also be supporting the struggle of the Czechoslovak people for
freedom and democracy,'' the advertisement said. It said money from
the sale would go toward refurbishing the local hospital.

<DATELINE>RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nurse was sentenced to 50 years to life
in prison today for killing four patients by injecting them with a
powerful muscle relaxant in a scheme to revive them and play the
hero.
   Richard Angelo, 27, of Lindenhurst, was convicted Dec. 14 of two
counts of murder and one each of manslaughter and criminally
negligent homicide in the 1987 deaths at Good Samaritan Hospital.
He received the maximum sentence.
   ``You had no right to usurp God's function,'' said Judge Alfred
Tisch. ``Each of those patients had a right to enjoy, in their own
way, every day that was available to them.''
   Angelo told police he injected patients so that he could revive
them. At his trial the prosecutor called him a ``monster in nurse's
whites.''
   The most dramatic testimony against Angelo came from one of his
victims who survived an injection, 75-year-old Gerolamo Kucich. The
Yugoslavian immigrant told the jury that Angelo gave him an
injection, saying it would ``make me feel better.'' Minutes later,
Kucich testified, he was fighting for his breath.
   Officials exhumed the bodies of 33 patients who died
suspiciously at Good Samaritan while Angelo worked there. Traces of
the muscle relaxant Pavulon were found in six of the bodies.
   A Pavulon-laced syringe was found in Angelo's apartment the day
before his arrest.
   Angelo was also convicted of five counts of assault _ against
the four who died and Kucich.
   He was acquitted of assault against two patients who were found
to have traces of Pavulon in their blood but whose deaths could not
be proved to have been caused by the drug.

<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, President Jaruzelski of Poland recently
suggested that the four big powers reconfirm -- or reaffirm the
frontiers of Poland irrespective of whatever happens to Germany.
Would the United States join such a reconfirmation of the frontiers?
   A: Well, we have recognized under Helsinki existing borders and
I have no problem reiterating that. But whether that requires some
kind of _ some kind of an international action on it, I just have
no judgment on that. Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, Havel of Czechoslovakia proposed yesterday a
summit in Prague between Mr. Gorbachev and you. Do you think it's a
good idea?
   A: Listen, I respect him so much, and I don't just give him the
back of my hand, but we've got a summit set and we have a very
critical agenda that I want to see met _ goals that I want to see
met. And so, I think at this time, that suggestion is not going to
work out the way he suggests.
   But I was rather moved by the suggestion and by the conditions
that make the suggestion possible. Who would have dreamed this a
year ago, that the conditions inside Czechoslovakia would give them
less than a, you know _ or would give him the freedom to make this
kind of suggestion and have it rather _ I was rather moved by it.
But I don't believe it's going to work for this summit. Ann?
   Q: Mr. President, you've opposed the Moynihan Social Security
bill strongly. Would you endorse or work for or support a
Republican alternative proposed by Congessman Porter that would
take the Social Security increases for this and next year and allow
people to keep those tax increases and put them in a separate
account?
   A: The Porter proposal has some interesting ingredients to it. I
am not prepared to endorse it. We don't have provisions for that in
our budget proposals. It's worthy, though, of consideration, of
some study, but I'm not prepared to endorse that, no, I'm not.
   Q: Is that not the first step to privatizing Social Security?
   A: Well, I don't think he would say that it is _ that that's the
inevitable goal. But it has certain aspects there. But people are
concerned about Social Security so when you have innovative
thinking of that nature, I don't want to just gun it down. I'm not
going to support it. Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, over the last few years there have been large
increases in the Social Security tax and even though it's a
regressive tax, people supported it or swallowed it because they
were told that that was necessary to make the system solvent for
the next generation.
   But, now everyone is finding out that, in fact, that money isn't
there any longer and it's been used for debt reduction. Given the
fact that people are now realizing that this is happening, do you
think it's fair to ask them to continue to pay this increased tax
for even one month longer?
   A: The commission that reformed Social Security was well aware
of what you've just talked about. They considered it. I think the
commission included Mr. Moynihan, I may be mistaken, but I think it
did.
   And they considered this point, and we will have some innovative
suggestions as we go along here as to how to compensate for this
understandable concern on the part of some. But I would _ for now,
for this year, we will _ we will not alter the recommendations of
that bipartisan commission. Yes?
   Q: Mr. President _ yes, could I just briefly _ do you feel that
this increase was sold to people under false premises?
   A: No. Because I think these were intelligent people wrestling
with a very, very difficult problem, and I can't accuse them of
selling the commission conclusions under false cover. Owen, and
then Ann.
   Q: Well, as you know, the budget deficit has been coming down
over the past few years solely because Social Security surplus has
been rising. And, in fact, your own budget projections show
$200-billion-a-year deficits in the indefinite future when you
remove the Social Security surplus.
   Given the fact that you have such a large deficit in every other
program, when will you and the Congress stop both bickering and
counting gimmicks and deal with this problem that the American
public has said for a decade --
   A: Thank you for the endorsement of our approach, Owen. We would
urge that we stop bickering and go forward with the proposal that
we come out with, that I think will begin to address itself to
Maureen's question, that is very sound, and nobody's trying to
conceal the fact that the Social Security trust fund is operating
at a surplus. That's not the _ there wasn't any concealment by the
Speaker of the House, Tip O'Neill, and others that entered into
this, you know, bipartisan agreement. Ann?

   Q: Well, wait a minute (inaudible) your own budget proposal,
that you will unveil on Monday, which shows a $64 billion deficit,
in fact, if you remove Social Security ...
   A: But you're arguing ...
   Q: ... will be closer to $150 billion
   A: But you're making the argument of _ the old argument _ of
taking the Social Security trust fund off budget. And at this
juncture, we're not prepared to do that. But wait till you see the
detail, and I hope you'll see the American people will see
something here that _ that it begins to address itself to these
fundamentals that I think are properly being asked about. Anne, and
then Rita.
   Q: Mr. President, could you confirm this week's published report
that there are divisions within your own immediate family on the
issue of abortion? And in particular, could you confirm the widely
held view that your own wife supports abortion rights?
   A: No, I couldn't confirm that, and I can't _ and the meeting
that I read about in one of the most respected publications was
pure, unadulterated _ um _ uh _ (laughter) _ ``malarkey'' is the
word I like to use. It just wasn't there. Rita?
   Q: Mr. President?
   A: Yes?
   Q: If I could follow up, as I understand your position, you now
say that the question of abortion is one of personal choice, one on
which Republicans can have diverse views and still be good
Republicans.
   A: I've always said that, Anne. I've campaigned for people that
disagree with me on _ on abortion.
   Q: But my question is, you say it's an issue of personal choice
and a question of conscience, and yet you support a constitutional
amendment which would remove that choice for all Americans. How do
you reconcile those two ...
   A: I reconcile that I was elected to try to fulfill the _ the
platform and the programs that I _ that I believe in. And so that's
my personal choice, but that doesn't mean I have lack of respect
for others. And that _ that I'm going to go out and not campaign
for people that disagree with me _ on this issue, on foreign policy
or whatever it is. And so that's how I explain it. Yes, Rita?
   Q: Mr. President, last time you took questions here you were
claiming success for the capture of Noriega, and also that you had
protected American lives in Panama. But what do you have to say to
the Panamanians about more than 200 civilians _ civilian
Panamanians that were killed as a result of this invasion? And
also, in your aid package to Panama, which hasn't been announced
yet, do you plan to offer any compensation to the families of these
people?
   A: Well, I'm not sure of the details on the aid package because
we haven't _ I haven't signed off on it yet. But what I say to them
is: Look, you lost some Panamanian lives, innocent life was lost.
And yet 92 percent of the people in Panama strongly supported the
action of the United States. Isn't that significant?
   And I mourn the loss of innocent civilians in Panama or anywhere
else, and certainly mourn the loss of the life of Americans. But
you have to feel concerned about that, but you have to look at the
broad picture. And then you have to do _ and I'm very pleased with
the strong support from the Panamanian people _ and then you've got
to do what's right. You have to try to help, repair the wounds,
repair the damage. We've got to go to the _ I know most of you are
very anxious to be at the arrival ceremony out there. And I have to
be there _ yes?
   Q: Mr. President, another question that's been raised by the
Moynihan proposal is the fairness of the tax system. Over the past
decade, even as income taxes have come down for high paid people,
Social Security taxes have gone up, mostly for lower and middle
income people. Do you think that's fair?
   A: Well, look, if we were all starting over, I think we could
fine tune the entire tax system. We're not starting over and I
think that system has been in and out over the years basically a
pretty fair system. And while I'm here, don't think I've lost
because of some arguments _ political arguments on the Hill that
capital gains reduction is only for the rich, I support it. But the
reason I do is that, in my view, it increases jobs for people.
   So, you have to look at what individual _ somebody has an idea
that if some individual deduction that encourages, say, drilling
when we are in an increasingly negative oil supply situation _ and
some would say, ``Hey, that favors those who go out and drill.''
And I say, ``Wait a minute, that's true.'' And that may not be fair
to some taxpayer here, but the national interest is best served by
the encouragement and development of domestic resources. We're all
fat, dumb and happy about our energy situation today, and I'm not.
So, there's all kinds of provisions that some will argue are fair
or unfair.
   Q: But sir, some of your favorite economist think tanks say that
the Social Security tax acts as a great disincentive to work and to
employing people. Isn't that to serve the same end?
   A: Well, I think that's a legitimate complaint about some of it
and that's one of the reasons I favor holding the line on taxes.
And one of the reasons I opposed Moynihan is I think it's a
disguise for increased taxes around the corner. And I don't want to
see the benefits of Social Security cut.
   It is odd that a Republican president, often accused by
political opponents in an election year, is the one that is
protecting the sanctity of the Social Security benefits. And I
would say to those out around the country, ``Take a hard look now.
Don't let that rabbit be pulled out of the hat by one hand and 25
other rabbits dumped on you in another.''
   This is _ will be a very complicated situation and these _ this
is a -- you know _ sleight of hand operation here. And the very day
Moynihan proposed it _ or the next day _ what do we get? We get the
call from another prominent, respected Democratic senator saying,
``Raise the sales tax on everybody.'' Before we go making a lot of
changes, let's know exactly where everybody's coming from in this.
   And I think Mr. Moynihan of a few years back ought to go out and
discuss it with Mr. Moynihan of today, because he was a part, I
believe, of a Social Security compromise that didn't correct some
of the injustices it made ...
   Q: Mr. President?
   A: Hey, listen, I've got to be out there looking very strict
here at 10 o'clock.
   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater: Thank you.

   A Siberian husky that mauled to death a
5-day-old baby girl has been destroyed, officials said Wednesday.
   The 13-year-old dog named Bandit was put to sleep Tuesday at the
request of the infant's parents, said Louise Cox, manager of the
Burlington County Animal and Rabies Control Center. The dog will be
tested for rabies.
   Authorities said the dog entered the infant's nursery and pulled
Anna Lynn Pagliaro of Florence from her crib on Sunday. The infant,
born Jan. 16, died from a broken neck.
   Animal shelter officials said the dog appeared jealous of the
child, who was brought home from the hospital Friday.
   Ms. Cox said the shelter is also seeking a home for the couple's
12-year-old female Siberian husky. Only the male dog was involved
in the attack.

   Hundreds of people demonstrated
outside the headquarters of the governing National Salvation Front
today to protest its decision to compete in national elections and
to demand its resignation.
   The biggest opposition party, the National Peasant Party, said
it feared the Front will put the Communist Party in power again,
and it also demanded the leaders step down.
   The protests came in reaction to the Front's announcement
Tuesday that it will run candidates in national elections May 20.
Previously, it pledged not to field candidates.
   Protesters chanted ``Communists in disguise!'' and ``Elections
without the Front!'' as they gathered by the tanks and soldiers
guarding the Front's headquarters.
   ``The National Salvation Front must resign today as it can't be
both a referee and a player,'' the Peasant Party said in a
communique read by party leader Corneliu Coposu to party members.
   It accused the Front of trying to steal the victory of the young
people and others who fought communism and dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu. The Front took over after Ceausescu was overthrown Dec.
22. He was executed Dec. 25.
   More than 50 Peasant Party members jammed the hallway of the
party's headquarters and cheered today's communique. Some then
joined the demonstration at the Front's headquarters.
   ``If (President Ion) Iliescu wanted to gain power, he should
have gotten signatures on petitions and formed a party,'' said one
protester, engineer Adrian Mihalcea.
   Some opposition figures have alleged that members of the Front
were the same men who played roles in Ceausescu's Communist
government.
   Two weeks ago, Iliescu bowed to huge protests and outlawed the
Communist Party, but the next day he reversed the decision, saying
it had been too hasty. Instead, Iliescu said the public would get
to decide the issue in a referendum Jan. 28.
   Last week, the Front canceled the referendum, saying the
questions to be on it were moot and citing time constraints.
   The Front said U.N. observers will monitor the May elections,
which were delayed from April to give the 15 new or revived
political parties more time to campaign.

   There will be a test flight of an
unarmed U.S. cruise missile over northwestern Canada on Friday, the
second this week, a Canadian military spokesman said Wednesday.
   Maj. Jan Martinsen said it will be ``a carbon copy'' of a test
flight that went as planned Tuesday when a cruise missile made a
parachute landing on a snow-covered weapons range on the
Alberta-Saskatchewan border.
   Tuesday's flight was the 14th test under a 1983 U.S.-Canadian
agreement that allows the United States to conduct up to six tests
a year between January and March.
   The test flight Tuesday ended when the missile touched down on
the Primrose air weapons range at 1:49 p.m. EST, three hours and 47
minutes after it was released over the Beaufort Sea in the western
Arctic. The missile had been flown to the launch site from an Air
Force base in Texas by a U.S. B-52 bomber.
   The ground-hugging missile followed a 1,320-mile route from the
Beaufort up the Mackenzie Valley, across northeastern British
Columbia and over northern Alberta to the air weapons range, 130
miles northeast of Edmonton.
   About 100 people gathered at the Alberta legislature to protest
Tuesday's test.
   Audrey Bath, chairman of the Alberta Citizens' Anti-cruise
Committee, criticized Ottawa and the Canadian military for allowing
the test amid easing tensions between Eastern Europe and the West.
   ``Our world is seemingly changing towards peacemaking and we
continue to participate in readiness towards destruction,'' Bath
said.

<HEAD>Fed Says Economy Continues to Grow Slowly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's economy continued to grow slowly
as it entered the new year and is expected to continue that
expansion throughout 1990, the Federal Reserve Board said today.
   ``Economy activity is expanding slowly in most of the nation,
with conditions somewhat stronger in the West than in the East,''
the central bank said in a survey of its 12 districts completed
Jan. 13.
   Retail sales varied during the Christmas shopping period,
ranging from ``disappointing'' in Boston to modest in Philadelphia
and Atlanta and relatively strong in Chicago, Minneapolis and San
Francisco.
   But the report added, ``widespread discounting generally reduced
store profits.''
   ``Manufacturing activity is generally sluggish, with production
declines in some industries (autos, in particular) offsetting gains
in others (such as commercial aircraft and oilfield equipment,''
the survey found.
   ``Several districts reported that the steel and computer
industries, among others, may be `bottoming out.'''
   The survey by the Fed's 12 district banks was conducted in
preparation for the Feb. 6-7 meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee, the central bank's monetary policy-setting arm. It was
compiled in what is known as the ``Beige Book'' by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston.
   The slow economy has resulted from the Fed's battle to drive
interest rates higher as a way of dampening demand and cooling off
inflationary pressures.
   The Fed switched course last June and has permitted short-term
rates to drop gradually in an effort to keep the slowing economy
from stopping altogether and falling into a recession.
   But the central bank has not acted since then and just last
week, the White House broke its usual no-comment stance on Fed
activities and said ``lower interest rates are justified.''
   As is usual, today's report by the Fed carried no
recommendations, but said, ``The outlook is for slow growth in all
regions in 1990; some respondents expect improvement late in the
year.''
   In other areas, the report's summary said, ``Unseasonably cold
weather dampened construction activity in some areas, but real
estate markets generally held steady. Cold or dry weather also
adversely affected citrus, vegetable and winter wheat crops. Other
agricultural and resource-related sectors did moderately well.''

   Two jets in the Navy's Blue Angels
precision flying team collided while practicing a stunt, causing
one plane to crash into a mountain, the Navy said. The pilot of the
downed jet ejected safely.
   The FA-18 Hornet plunged into 759-foot Superstition Mountain
about 20 miles from El Centro on Tuesday, said Mike Ray, a
spokesman at the El Centro Naval Air Facility.
   In Hawaii, the Coast Guard, Marines and Navy resumed the search
today for a Marine pilot whose helicopter crashed during training
maneuvers. The CH-46 Sea Knight went down Monday about 25 miles
from Oahu. Three rescued Marines were in satisfactory condition.
   In the El Centro collision, three other planes, including one
involved in the collision, returned safely to the base, Ray said.
The pilot who ejected, Marine Corps Capt. Chase Moseley, was
treated at a hospital for facial bruises and cuts, authorities said.
   The Blue Angels use the desert base in the winter to practice
the daredevil routines they perform at air shows around the country.
   The four aircraft were practicing a tight ``diamond roll''
formation when the lead plane flown by Cmdr. Pat Moneymaker struck
Moseley's aircraft, Ray said. Moneymaker is the Blue Angels'
commanding officer.
   The Navy is investigating how the collision occurred.
   In the maneuver, four planes fly skyward in a diamond formation
from low altitude and perform a 500 mph loop while staying in a
tightly packed group.
   The accident was the first involving a Blue Angels aircraft
since February 1987, when an FA-18 crashed during practice. The
pilot ejected safely.

   Japan's first lunar probe lifted off
today, billowing clouds of smoke and carrying Japanese hopes of
becoming the third nation to reach the moon.
   Launch officials said the unmanned Muses-A satellite separated
from the rockets several minutes into the flight as planned.
   Mission chief Hiroki Matsuo said data from the satellite picked
up by tracking stations in California and Australia showed it was
orbiting the Earth at a maximum distance of 186,000 miles, compared
with an eventual goal of 310,000 miles.
   The slender M3S-2 rocket disappeared into the night sky over the
Pacific Ocean from its launch pad nestled between mountains on
Japan's southern coast.
   The rocket blasted off on schedule at 8:46 p.m. (6:46 a.m. EST).
   If successful, the Muses-A satellite will be the first
spacecraft to visit the moon since an unmanned Soviet vehicle
landed on its surface in 1976. Only the United States and the
Soviet Union have sent spacecraft to the moon.
   Originally set for Tuesday, the liftoff was postponed with only
18 seconds to go after an electrical switching problem cut off
power to a hydraulic pump used to aim the nozzle of an auxiliary
booster rocket.
   Matsuo said Tuesday's delay was the first time in five launches
of the solid-fuel M3S-2 that the countdown had been stopped in the
final 60 seconds.
   The three-stage red-and-silver M3S-2 rocket, which cannot lift
much more than its 400-pound payload, carried Muses-A into an
elliptical orbit that is to bring it to within about 10,000 miles
of the moon in eight weeks.
   Just before crossing the moon's path, a smaller satellite will
break off the Muses-A and go into lunar orbit and send data to the
larger satellite on temperatures and electrical fields.
   The Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second-largest automobile maker,
built the three-stage, 62-ton M3S-2 engine used in the lunar
mission.
   Japan's first satellite was launched in 1970. Muses-A would be
the 13th Japanese satellite in operation.
   The Muses-A mission is being conducted by Japan's Institute of
Space and Astronautical Science, one of two government-funded space
agencies.
   ``This time we are going to the moon. But our objective is not
the moon itself,'' Matsuo said. ``Our institute is getting into
interplanetary missions in the 1990s and for that we need to refine
our technology.''
   In recent years, Japan has achieved a respected aerospace launch
record, despite its late entry into the field, low budgets _ $1.06
billion last year _ and a shortage of good launch sites.
   Japan's two main launch areas _ in Uchinoura and in nearby
Tanagashima _ are only a tiny fraction of the size of space centers
in other nations.
   The Institute of Space, affiliated with the Education Ministry,
focuses on scientific research while the Science and Technology
Agency, affiliated with the National Space Development Agency,
develops satellites and rockets for applied uses such as
communications and weather observation.
   The 12 satellites Japan currently operates include two marine
observation satellites, two weather satellites, four communications
satellites and one broadcasting satellite, which beams television
programs directly to viewers' homes. The remainder are scientific
or engineering test satellites.
   Japan's trading partners have criticized it for not buying more
foreign-made satellites and rockets at lower cost.
   But the National Space Development Agency is developing a new
rocket, the H-2, which will match U.S., Soviet and European rockets
in payload capability and be competitive in price, director
Tomifumi Godai said.

   Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail on Mayor Barry:
   Washington Mayor Marion Barry provides a good example of why
Americans no longer believe public officials: Public officials all
too frequently lie.
   Rumors of drug abuse dogged Barry for years. ... Barry
vehemently denied the charges. In a twist on the old trick of a
troubled politician wrapping himself in the flag, Barry said the
investigation of his activities was racially motivated.
   Only afer Barry was arrested in a sting operation _ and only
after he tested positive for cocaine _ did he admit he had a
problem and seek treatment.
   Even at that, Barry sugarcoated his dilemma, saying, ``I spent
so much time doing for others that I have not worried enough about
... caring for myself.''
   Anybody buying that?
   No wonder the public is cynical about the political process.

   The Phoenix Gazette on the McMartin trial:
   It was the nation's longest and costliest trial.
   After $15 million, 2{ years of testimony, 124 witnesses, 2,000
exhibits and 100,000 pages of transcripts, the defendants were
acquitted of 52 charges, the jury (was) unable to reach a verdict
on 11 others.
   California's McMartin Pre-School molestation story was a feast
for the media. Almost 400 children were alleged to have been
molested at McMartin, eight people were originally charged and
there were more than 50 uncharged suspects in a case that
reportedly involved a kiddie porn ring, a Satanic cult, animals,
mutilations and torture.
   In the end, however, there were just two defendants, Raymond
Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey.
   After the verdicts, a few jurors said that while they believed
that some molestations occurred at McMartin, the prosecution failed
to prove where, when and by whom. The prosecution, in effect, had
failed, and failed miserably. ...
   Media critic David Shaw says the McMartin story ``exposed
several basic flaws in the way contemporary news organizations
function. Pack journalism. Vigilantism. Laziness. Superficiality.
Cozy relationships with prosecutors. A competitive zeal that sends
reporters off in a frantic search to be first with the latest
shocking allegation, responsible journalism be damned.''
   Shaw may never get a conviction on those charges, but it seems
clear that shoddy workmanship can be traced to many professions in
the McMartin case and that the nation's longest and costliest trial
will be remembered for little else.

   The Peninsula Daily News, Port Angeles, Wash., on congressional
ethics:
   In Eastern Europe, 1989 may have been a great year for
democracy. But on Capitol Hill, the democratic process appears to
have taken a beating. A number of congressmen were caught in
embarrassing ethics controversies.
   Five senators have been accused of improperly pressuring bank
regulators on behalf of the owner of a California thrift in
exchange for generous campaign contributions. Another senator is
accused of seeking special favors for his political allies from the
Department of Housing and Urban Development. And still another is
accused of evading the limits on speaking fees from outside groups.
   There is a positive side to all this evidence of misbehavior. It
should help those members of Congress who have been trying to
require stricter ethical conduct on the hill.
   There currently are efforts to impose spending limits on
congressional campaigns and curbs on political action committee
donations. The opposition to such reforms has to have been weakened
by the previous year's unhappy revelations.

   The World, Coos Bay, Ore., on health care:
   In a glimpse of where public health care may well be headed in
the future, federal health officials issued a report ... that is
fairly easy to interpret.
   Nine preventable chronic diseases are responsible for more than
half the deaths in this country, but only 2 percent of the public
health care dollars are spent for prevention of those deaths.
   The problem, of course, is in the nature of the diseases and
their prevention. They tend to be illnesses brought on by personal
habits that are hard to break: stroke, heart disease, diabetes,
obstructive lung disease, lung cancer, breast cancer, cervical
cancer, colorectal cancer and cirrhosis of the liver.
   To prevent them, or at least reduce their impact on death rates
in America, we need to stop smoking tobacco, get our weight under
control, exercise more, drink less, and watch what we eat. ...
   (W)e have to find out what makes us so willing to spend
thousands of dollars on radiation therapy or surgery or special
treatments, but unwilling to take the time or trouble or expense to
prevent the problem in the first place.

   Winona (Minn.) Daily News on oat bran:
   Is anyone surprised at researchers' claims that oat bran isn't
the panacea it has been made out to be?
   In our health-crazed times, foods are made out to be heroes and
villains at a vigorous pace. What was good 10 years ago is bad
today. What is touted as a cure-all for the '90s will be a
carcinogen in the next century.
   The (new) study ... said that oat bran isn't bad, but it has
been overhyped. Critics responded by saying that (the) report isn't
accurate and is based on a small sample. But several leading
scientists backed up the study's methods.
   Clearly oat bran is mired in a sticky controversy over its
benefits. Don't bet your heart on oat bran; exercise and common
sense give you much better odds.
   And then there's the question of what kind of cholesterol oat
bran worked against. Was it the good cholesterol or the bad
cholesterol?

   Picayune (Miss.) Item on health studies:
   We are growing weary of medical researchers who rush to get
their latest findings in the headlines _ for whatever career or
financial benefit that provides _ only to have someone else come
along and refute their discovery with a study that produced a
different result. The public is getting confused.
   After all the hoopla about oat bran lowering cholesterol, new
research claims it ain't true. Cereal makers who have been hyping
oat bran products are now accused of misleading the consumer.
   To be sure, this binge of selling processed foods with
exaggerated health claims has been way overdone, but let's not
forget who started the oat bran fad. It wasn't the cereal makers.
It was doctors. ...
   The medical community could do a better job of policing itself
on this. Official journals of medicine should demand more extensive
study before publishing headline-grabbing ``findings.''

   The News-Herald, Panama City, Fla., on the economy:
   How are economic prospects for the 1990s? Even though the
economy is chugging along in its eighth year of expansion, Rep. Lee
Hamilton, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress,
thinks prospects are bleak.
   Summarizing his committee's position, he writes ``While we have
been successful in reducing unemployment without reviving
inflation, we have not improved our prospects for long-term growth
or spread the benefits of growth fairly among our citizens.''
   Say what? Cutting inflation and putting people to work is no
mean feat. And it's odd for a member of the House of
Representatives, which just voted itself a tax-funded 35 percent
pay raise, to be worried about spreading ``growth fairly.''
   This hypocritical rhetoric is but a prelude to: ``We cannot
eliminate the deficit without a moderate tax increase. We cannot
grow out of the deficit.''
   Spur the economy through a capital-gains tax cut.
   A tax cut, not a stifling tax increase, is the ticket to
prosperity in the 1990s.

   Concord (N.H.) Monitor on education:
   Study after study ... demonstrate that American schoolchildren
fare poorly when stacked up against students from other developed
nations. They don't know geography, can't do math, give up on
science; their reasoning powers are relatively undeveloped.
   So it is logical to presume that if the United States is, as
President Bush has said, lavishing ``unsurpassed resources'' on
children's schooling, it is not spending that money wisely.
   And it is equally clear that if we don't start spending money
more wisely, the standard of living in the United States will
continue to slide.

   Farmington (N.M.) Daily Times on drugs:
   The Bush administration and Colombian leaders are wise to give
little credence to an offer by drug bosses that would, they say,
end the bloody drug war being waged in the Latin American country.
   In recent days, members of the Medellin cartel have said they
want a truce in the drug war that has resulted in the deaths of at
least 209 people since last August. In exchange, the
``extraditables'' _ as they are also known _ seek complete amnesty.
   As the saying goes: If it sounds too good to be true, it usually
is. The drug lords' offer indeed sounds too good to be true.
   It's hard to believe they intend to so easily give up the
extremely lucrative drug trade.
   To agree to the amnesty demands would be a slap in the face of
the direct and indirect victims of their terrorism and drug
dealings.
   And should they be granted amnesty, it can almost be guaranteed
the cartel would soon again be dealing drugs with impunity.

   Orange County (Calif.) Register on the Armenia-Azerbaijan
conflict:
   President George Bush ... has given qualified support to (the
Soviet) invasion (of Azerbaijan). ... The Red Army invaded after
two weeks of the majority Azeris, who are Moslems, killing minority
Armenians, who are Christians.
   But there's more to this than the Soviets wish us to know, as
has been revealed by Gary Kasparov, the world chess champion and
one of the most independent figures in the Soviet Union. He is also
a native of Baku, the Azerbaijani city the Red Army just conquered,
and the son of a Jewish father and an Armenian mother. ...
   Kasparov also noted that most Armenians had already been
evacuated by the time the Red Army assaulted Baku. Reports the AP:
``Therefore, he said, he believed the military action was intended
to crush the Azerbaijani independence movement, not stop the
killing, as Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said.'' ...
   What we may have here is a classic Soviet ploy. Stir things up
among minority peoples (the KBG has been there all along). Then
paint the Red Army massacre as a ``rescue,'' while getting gullible
Western leaders to approve. ...
   Bush should reverse himself and call on Moscow to grant
independence to Azerbaijan, Armenia and all other captive nations.

   Bridgeton (N.J.) Evening News on the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict:
   Some Europeans, exuberant over the thought that they are
breaking free of the Soviet government, have mistaken freedom for
license.
   The result is ... chaos ... developed in Armenia and neighboring
Azerbaijan where Christians and Moslems suddenly began slaughtering
each other.
   What is going on in the absence of any government restraint is a
conflict of religions, not of governments. Nonetheless, it will
doubtless result in a serious crackdown by Soviet authorities. It
should.
   The Armenian Christians and the Azerbaijanian Moslems must
understand that true democracy allows the practice of both beliefs
to continue beside each other.

   The News and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on El Salvador:
   By publicly linking members of El Salvador's military to the
brutal murders of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her
daughter, Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani has courageously
confronted the barbarous elements within his own armed forces.
   It was a courageous act because ... Cristiani risks alienating
not only El Salvador's powerful military establishment, but his own
right-wing constituency. ...
   Cristiani's vow to punish all those involved ``down to the last
person implicated'' will be difficult in a country that lacks both
a democratic tradition and an independent judiciary. ...
   To his great credit, ... Cristiani has promised to leave no
stone unturned in his effort to find and punish all those
responsible for these crimes. Having taken that courageous first
step, he is now obligated to ensure that justice is carried out.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on Panama:
   As American troops leave Panama, pollsters have moved in and the
ultimate judges have had their say. Panamanians by a wide margin
say President Bush was right in ordering the strike that toppled
Manuel Noriega's government and eventually led to his being brought
to the United States to stand trial on drug trafficking charges.
   The approval was given by 89 percent of 1,304 people of Panama
living in both urban and rural areas polled Jan. 5-13 by a firm
associated with the Gallup organization.
   The 89 percent said the action was necessary, 88 percent saw it
as beneficial to the country and wanted U.S. forces to remain as
long as is necessary to ensure order, and 86 percent considered the
invasion a ``liberation.''
   On the other side of the coin, 87 percent of those polled had
unfavorable opinion of Noriega and 91 percent viewed Noriega's
Panamanian Defense Force as unfavorable and ``repressive.''
   The verdict is in, let it stand.

   The Gastonia (N.C.) Gazette on NASA's Mars mission:
   More than one pair of eyes popped at NASA's projected price tag
for missions to Mars and the moon: $15 billion to $20 billion a
year for 25 years. Now some space experts are questioning whether
NASA has gotten too bureaucratic and hidebound to do the job.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, head of the National Space Council,
gave the agency a tweaking in a recent speech. NASA, he said, ``has
not done as well as it could have in marshaling the resources and
the leadership necessary to keep us ahead in space.''
   While rejecting the idea that NASA be replaced, Quayle
recommended loosening the agency's monopoly on space by reaching
out to universities, private businesses and even other government
agencies in a search for new ideas and methods.
   One privately developed idea, for example, is using lighter,
inflatable material in constructing space stations, cutting
expenses and time.
   There are drawbacks to the plan, and it may never be used. But
it illustrates the fact that the freshest ideas are generated
outside government. NASA should take Quayle's friendly suggestions
to heart; as much as any federal agency, it can use those fresh
ideas.

computers in their cars.

   The Daily Times, Primos, Pa., on the NCAA:
   It's sad to see that college athletics has put the pigskin ahead
of the sheepskin in the easing of academic requirements for
scholarship athletes.
   The NCAA recently caved in to pressure from the powers that be
(Georgetown basketball coach John Thompson and Temple coach John
Chaney to name a couple) and ripped the guts out of a year-old
restriction on financial aid to new athletes who don't fully meet
academic requirements for scholarships.
   It was only last year about this time that the NCAA designed
Proposition 42, which would have banned all scholarships and other
aid for freshman athletes who meet only part of grade and
test-score minimums created three years ago under another measure
called Proposition 48.
   Under Proposition 48, partial qualifiers could receive full
scholarships while only having to sit out their freshman year.
   Prop 42 was a good thing, because it told prospective college
athletes that they would have to study. And isn't that what college
is supposed to be all about? ...
   Thompson claimed that Prop 42 discriminated against
underprivileged and minority students.
   We find that hard to swallow, considering that college entrance
standards for athletes have always appeared to be considerably
lower than those set for non-athletes.
   And now with the further relaxing of such minimal standards in
this latest measure _ which has become known as Proposition 26 _
colleges will be discriminating against underprivileged and
minority applicants who just might not happen to play sports.

   The House, newly convened for its 1990
election-year session, is preparing to hand President Bush an
overwhelming foreign policy defeat and turn up the heat on the
Senate to follow suit.
   Leaders in both parties predicted a big bipartisan vote today to
override Bush's Nov. 30 veto of legislation potentially extending
the stays of thousands of Chinese students in the United States to
shield them from political reprisals at home.
   Bush today pleaded anew with lawmakers to let his veto stand,
saying the students ``are safe now and will be safe in the future.''
   Describing a meeting he had with Senate Republicans, Bush said
he sought to point out steps the Chinese have taken to ease
relations with the United States, such as accepting Peace Corps
volunteers, muting ``hostile propaganda'' against Americans and
easing harrassment of the U.S. Embassy, where a prominent Chinese
dissident has been in hiding.
   ``I ask the Senate and the House to take a look at these things
and take into account the totality of the policy,'' the president
said. ``I think there is some indignation about students (in
Congress) but I think also there's a dose of political rhetoric up
there. ... ''
   Senate Minority Whip Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said he believed Bush
had been persuasive and had pulled to within six or seven votes of
the 34 he will need to maintain his position when the Senate votes,
as early as Thursday. He said his comments of a day earlier
conceding defeat on the issue were just ``exaggerating.''
   The Senate began its year on Tuesday debating an issue left over
from 1989: clean air legislation that is more far-reaching and
costly than Bush wants. Other thorny issues left over from the
101st Congress' lackluster first session loom ahead as well,
including child care, parental leave, Bush's capital gains tax cut
and the federal budget deficit.
   The call to order brought the Capitol out of a two-month winter
rest with friendly reunions, a flurry of bill introductions and
speeches and optimistic predictions for the year ahead.
   Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, led the Pledge of Allegiance in the
House and received hugs and a long standing ovation. Brooks had a
brush with death during the holidays while hospitalized for
pancreatitis.
   And a new House member was sworn in. Rep. Craig Washington wiped
away tears after he took the oath to succeed Rep. Mickey Leland,
D-Texas, who died last year in a plane crash in Ethiopia. A day
earlier, a judge back in Texas sentenced Washington to 30 days in
jail for contempt of court, accusing him of leaving legal clients
``in the lurch.''
   As it faces a new year, Congress and the president will have to
confront a dramatically changing relationship with the Soviet Union
and its implications for U.S. defense spending and relations with
Eastern Europe.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley promised the new session of
Congress would be more productive than the last, including passage
of campaign finance reform. And he said lawmakers will give careful
study to a proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to cut
Social Security taxes.
   On the Chinese students issue Bush was making his fight in the
Senate, where he hoped to win the 34 votes needed to prevent a
two-thirds majority for an override. Republican senators were
invited to the White House for breakfast today for a personal
lobbying session with the president.
   Lobbying on Capitol Hill Monday, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III warned Republican senators a veto override could lead to
a cutoff of the flow of Chinese students to the United States and a
shutdown of cultural exchanges.
   The bill's sponsor, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said her only
motives in seeking an override vote were to offer irrevocable
protection to as many as 32,000 students and to send a clear signal
of disdain for Beijing's crackdown last June on pro-democracy
demonstrators.
   Simpson criticized Democrats for using the bill as a political
blunt instrument in an effort to pare down the high approval
ratings Bush has achieved in the polls following the U.S. invasion
of Panama.
   Meanwhile, Moynihan, formally introducing his Social Security
tax cut proposal, said the administration is deceiving workers
because the excess Social Security taxes being collected from them
are being used to make the federal deficit appear smaller.
   ``These are insurance contributions, they are premiums paid,''
Moynihan told a news conference. ``They do not belong to the
government. If we are not going to save them we should return
them.''
   His bill, which has drawn widespread interest but few sponsors,
would roll back the tax increase that took effect Jan. 1 and reduce
another increase scheduled for next year. That would save a worker
with income over $51,300 about $600, and leave the Social Security
system with just enough money to pay retirees' checks, Moynihan
said.
   The Bush administration says such cuts would lead to reductions
in benefits or to efforts to raise other taxes. The Senate Finance
Committee has scheduled hearings on the issue for Feb. 5 and 8.

<HEAD>Networks in Dallas-Fort Worth Combine to Broadcast Drug Special</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four TV stations, in an unprecedented case of
cooperation, pre-empted two hours of prime-time shows to
simultaneously broadcast an anti-drug program, picking up at least
three-quarters of the people watching TV.
   The locally produced program, ``Texas Crackdown!'' was shown
Tuesday on all three major network affiliates in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area and one independent station, and was accompanied by a
radio version on three stations.
   Dallas and Fort Worth newspapers joined the effort with drug
quizzes in their Tuesday editions, and teachers assigned light
homework so students could watch the show.
   Many schools planned quizzes and school projects based on the
program. A non-profit group sponsored an essay contest for
students, based on the program.
   WFAA, an ABC affiliate, aired the program with CBS affiliate
KDFW, NBC affiliate KXAS and independent KDTX. Three
Spanish-language radio stations _ KESS-AM, KSSA-AM and KSSA-FM _
broadcast the two-hour show in Spanish.
   Nielsen ratings showed that 75 percent of the people watching
television in the Dallas-Fort Worth market watched ``Texas
Crackdown!'' on the network affiliates at 9 p.m., said WFAA-TV
president and general manager Dave Lane.
   On a normal viewing night, the percentages would be in the
mid-to upper 60s for the three network affiliates, Lane said.
   The independent station's ratings were not available in the
overnight reports, he said.
   Although the programs were sponsored by local hospitals and
Domino's pizza, there were no regularly scheduled commercials. The
time block cost the stations an estimated $1 million.
   Lane said the purpose of the program, which featured reports on
recovering drug addicts and the emotional and physical costs of
drug use, was drug prevention.
   ``We were not naive enough to believe that you can take people
who are hooked on crack cocaine, put them in front of a TV and cure
them,'' Lane said today.
   Wendell Harris, vice president and news director at KDFW, said,
``I don't know if we cured a soul, but if we made them think, and
showed them where to get help. I think we did what we set out to
do.''
   ``Texas Crackdown!'' was conceived last summer in meetings
between WFAA and officials of the Greater Dallas Crime Commission.
   The pictures of six suspected drug dealers were shown during the
program. Viewers with information on drug dealers were eligible to
win a $10,000 reward for information leading to arrests and
convictions.
   Greg MacAleese of the crime commission said response to the tip
line was overwhelming.
   A toll-free number for people needing help with drug addiction
was overwhelmed with calls, said Ruth Feldman of the Alcohol and
Drug Abuse Council. She said the bulk of the calls came from girls
ages 13 to 15 who said they had little adult supervision.

   Riot police used tear gas and a
water cannon today to disperse about 40,000 ethnic Albanians
demanding the lifting of a state of emergency in the ethnically
torn province of Kosovo, witnessess said.
   The action came after an officer repeatedly told protesters to
end the peaceful demonstration in Pristina, the provincial capital,
the witnesses told The Associated Press.
   They said about 10 people were arrested as the crowd withdrew
toward Vranjevac, a predominantly ethnic Albanian suburb of
Pristina, where sporadic demonstrations were reported to be
continuing.
   The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The crowd consisting mainly of university students and
construction workers, had gathered to demand that authorities end
the state of emergency and halt what they say are political trials,
police brutality and the detention of political prisoners. A
smaller protest with similar demands occurred in Pristina on
Tuesday.
   The demonstrators demanded a change in what they described as
``anti-Albanian discrimination'' and called for free elections in
Kosovo, said the witnesses.
   The crowd chanted ``Traitors! Traitors!'' and demanded the
resignation of Rahman Morina, the province's Communist leader, and
Ju suf Karakusi, the police chief, whom they accuse of human rights
abuses.
   Hundreds of workers in several major Kosovo companies staged
support strikes during the day, the state news agency Tanjug
reported.
   At least 28 people died in violent demonstrations in the
province last year after constitutional changes that limited
Kosovo's autonomy and gave Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic,
near-total control over the region.
   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's
1.9 million people, were jailed in the police crackdown that
followed the unrest.
   A partial state of emergency, which authorities assert is
necessary to protect the Serbian minority in Kosovo, has remained
in force in the region.
   International human rights organizations and the media in
Yugoslavia's liberal northern republics of Slovenia and Croatia
have blamed Serbian authorities for alleged human rights violations
in Kosovo.
   Slovenian Communists, backed by their Croatian counterparts, on
Monday split from the federal Communist Party dominated by Serbia,
citing irreconcilable ideological differences.

   Yves Saint Laurent won a long, standing ovation
Wednesday as he waltzed down the runway, kissing his models after a
show of summer haute couture featuring clean, colorful classics as
only he can make.
   The crowd's enthusiasm contrasted with Tuesday night's debut of
ready-to-wear wizard Claude Montana as haute couturier for the
celebrated house of Lanvin, a sad moment in which Montana seemed
out of his element.
   ``Yves Saint Laurent was more to the couture point,'' said
fashionable Paloma Picasso. ``I loved his evening wear, with so
many ideas and such fabulous color combinations, as usual.''
   Saint Laurent's day wear was both striking and wearable. It
centered on sharp white, ivory or navy ottoman or shantung suits _
including sleek pants or short skirts with tailored jackets.
   Disregarding fashion critics who tell him to discard shoulder
pads, Saint Laurent still shows his daytime clothes neatly padded
out to give shape. But the blouses underneath have softer shapes in
scoop-necked satin or organza models, with cap or raglan sleeves.
   He dedicated many models to past or present entertainment stars.
Some looked downright odd, like the frog-buttoned black gazar coat
over a pants suit dedicated to Rita Hayworth.
   But his homage to his home in Morocco was a simple white satin
sheath topped by a stunning jacket that made the dress. Engineered
by master embroiderer Francois Lesage, it was an extravaganza of
mirror sequins, beads and crystals.
   In easy-to-wear daytime lines, Saint Laurent turned out a soft
midnight blue silk chemise dress with big white buttons and several
silk shirt waists in jungle-panther prints.
   His faultless use of fabric and color went from slinky little
cream satin ``Mademoiselle de Paris'' short tea dresses to a fresh
blue plaid organdy dance dress with puffy sleeves and deep
decollete.
   Montana, by contrast, lacked the elegant elaboration of haute
couture. ``It was pure Montana,'' tersely commented Ellin Saltzman,
corporate fashion director of R.H. Macy Inc.
   Not that the clothes were bad; they had Montana's original
touch, and the great ready-to-wear creator of blousons put on lots
of them in luxury fabrics such as pink-lined copper satin over lean
linen pants.
   But the poor reception would seem a setback for Midland Bank,
which took over Lanvin last year and chose Montana to lead the
couture creation. Some observers thought Montana had done better
collections under his own label.
   The billowy white short gazar ``trench coats'' had Montana
cachet. Brown and earthy colors like khaki, tobacco, chocolate and
clay were featured in luxury fabrics.
   Montana based his silhouette on lean pants and jodhpurs, with
most interest in the toppers like a striped sequined shortie duffel
coat over navy shorts.
   But the audience looked mainly perplexed, with some sniffing
that the combinations just did not make a couture look. Rich
clientele who usually love Lanvin are unlikely to go for the
austere evening wear, with spider web see-through effects on top.
   However, lovely late-day ideas in fabulous fabrics were paraded
at the young couture house of Lecoanet-Hemant.
   The clothes were form-fitting, with clever draping, insertion of
elaborate lace touches under waistlines, lashings of white organza
on collars or skirt flounces adding dashes of fun.
   A typical little sexy cocktail outfit paired an asymmetrical
fitted jacket over a tiny lean coral leather skirt.
   Designer Didier Lecoanet also worked with new raffia lace trim
and gold braid effects in the bright outfits. Other summery touches
were in the mother-of-pearl shell embroideries.
   With some cutouts revealing skin for summer, plenty of bouncy
evening wear with short skirts in front and train effects in back,
the festive outfits in light organza, brocade, taffeta faille and
gazar were truly worthy of the haute couture label.
   The clothes, costing many thousands of dollars per outfit, are
mainly for show. Only about 2,000 women regularly buy couture,
which is meant to power the fashion houses' other activities, from
accessories to perfumes.

<HEAD>Psychologist Finds `Flashbulb Memories' of Challenger Explosion
Off Base</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURAN NEERGAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some people insist they remember vividly where
they were when the space shuttle Challenger exploded four years ago
Sunday, but Ulric Neisser knows they're wrong.
   And the ``father of cognitive psychology'' has their handwritten
accounts of the day to prove it.
   ``This really surprised me,'' said Neisser, a member of the
National Academy of Sciences who pioneered the psychology of how
people handle information. ``I suspected they wouldn't be 100
percent accurate, but I never thought they'd be this wrong.''
   When Neisser, an Emory University psychology professor, heard
that Challenger had exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, killing all the
astronauts on board, he decided that surveying Emory students about
the accident could help test the accuracy of ``flashbulb memories.''
   That term, coined by Harvard psychologist Roger Brown, describes
vivid and detailed memories of important and emotional events. In
the 1970s, Brown wrote that events such as the assassination of
John F. Kennedy are accurately recorded by a quasi-photographic
mechanism in the brain.
   The morning after Challenger exploded, Neisser asked 100
students to record how, where and when they heard the news, who
told them and how they felt.
   In the fall of 1988, and again in spring 1989, he and Emory
graduate student Nicole Harsch tracked down 44 of the students and
interviewed them, scoring their responses on a 7-point scale of
accuracy.
   In the first interviews, 11 were ``dead wrong'' and only three
received a score of 7.
   In the 1989 interviews, when Neisser even gave the students
hints and eventually showed them the reports they had written, 12
students still failed completely.
   He added that even those people with a score of 7 were not
totally correct in their memories.
   Of the 13 students whose confidence level was highest, three had
scores of 0 and seven had scores of 2 or less. Only two were
accurate.
   ``Hardly anyone remembered filling them out,'' Neisser said of
the statements. ``Even then, nobody said, `Oh yes, now I remember.'
You'd think they'd say that if only to be a good subject and please
the interviewer.
   ``Some didn't want to believe it even then. They said, `I'm sure
that's wrong.'''
   The typical response was that the student was passing a TV set
and stopped to watch.
   ``After all, after hearing about it, almost all of us sat around
that night watching it on television,'' Neisser said. ``They
remember the television-watching experience.''
   The concept of flashbulb memories has been around since at least
1899, Neisser said. He found an article published in an 1899
Psychological Review that said a man named Cole Grove surveyed
people 30 years after President Lincoln's assassination. Although
two-thirds of those claimed to remember how they heard the news,
Grove said probably only one-third were correct.
   Neisser, who will present his findings at a conference on
flashbulb memories at Emory Feb. 2, added that although such
surveys have been done before, his is the first to have concrete
facts to back it up in the form of the students' written statements.
   Now he and other psychologists, some of whom are planning
similar studies of the San Francisco earthquake, must determine why
people have such high confidence in their memories, Neisser said.
   ``At first it was thought that maybe the strength of the emotion
and surprise stamps the memory into your mind in a particularly
lasting way,'' he said. ``These are events they think a lot about,
talk to people about.
   ``Eventually they only remember a few fragments. They construct
a plausible story and then forget they constructed the story.''

<HEAD>Ruling Party Gives Nearly $40 Million to its Candidates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Liberal Democratic Party distributed nearly $40
million Wednesday to help its candidates in the Feb. 18
parliamentary elections, which the scandal-plagued governing party
is in danger of losing.
   Japan's largest trade union federation issued a statement urging
voters to reject the ``money-oriented politics'' of the Liberal
Democrats, who have strong support from big business.
   Money politics will be a central theme in the opposition
campaign against the party that has governed Japan since 1955, the
year it was formed.
   Liberal Democratic incumbents in Parliament's lower house each
received either $103,000 or $172,000, with the smaller sum going to
well-known politicians. Party sources said the total distributed
was $38.6 million.
   The 270 candidates endorsed so far called at party headquarters
to pick up brown paper bags bulging with cash.
   Earlier Wednesday, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu dissolved the
512-member lower house, in which the Liberal Democrats held 295
seats, to pave the way for elections.
   In July, the party lost its majority in the less powerful upper
house because of an unpopular sales tax and a bribery scandal
involving senior Liberal Democratic politicians.
   Recent public opinion polls show the governing party leading the
opposition, but if the Liberal Democrats lose next month, a
coalition led by the Japan Socialist Party probably would take over.
   After dissolving the lower house, Kaifu told fellow party
members it was their duty to ``restore the people's confidence in
the party.''
   The Cabinet met and decided candidates should register and
campaigning begin Feb. 3, when the date of the election will be
announced officially as Feb. 18. Elections are required by July,
when the four-year term of the lower house expires.
   Party elders apparently chose the February date to give the new
Parliament time to consider the budget, which must be passed by
April 1.
   A statement issued Wednesday by the governing party said:
``Socialist and Communist nations around the world are collapsing
like an avalanche'' and a victory by the ``outdated, inflexible''
opposition would represent a return to the past.
   Liberal Democrats pledged action on political reform and
agricultural, welfare and land policies.
   Kaifu said recently that, if his party lost, he would ``take
responsibility'' _ apparently meaning he would resign, as his
predecessor, Sousuke Uno, did after the election loss in June.
   Opposition parties condemned the long hold on power by the
Liberal Democrats.
   ``Intra-LDP conflicts prevented Prime Minister Kaifu from
addressing the Diet (parliament) with his policies before
dissolution,'' the Socialists said. ``Policy questions by
opposition party leaders were also blocked.''
   Such actions resulted from ``arrogant one-party rule,'' the
party said, and it appealed for unity behind a coalition that
``reflects the national interest and responds to radically shifting
domestic and foreign affairs.''
   The Komeito (Clean Government) and Democratic Socialist parties
said they would hold to the center, seeking abolition of the sales
tax, improvement in Japan's standard of living and progress in
world peace and disarmament.
   The Japanese Trade Union Confederation, which has 8 million
members, said the election centers on the controversial 3 percent
sales tax.
   Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organizations, which represents Japan's largest corporations, said
the election eould decide Japan's destiny in the next century.
   He said Japan's ``miraculous economic growth'' has been based on
``stable politics championed'' by the Liberal Democrats.

   Stock prices fell sharply today as worries about
rising interest rates and pressure on the Japanese market continued
taking a heavy toll on Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which has fallen 195
points over the past three weeks, was down 43.92 to 2,571.40 by
noon on Wall Street. At one point in early trading, the widely
followed market indicator was down more than 61 points.
   Losers overwhelmed gainers by a margin of about 12 to 1 in the
early tally on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Traders learned overnight of a sharp decline in the Tokyo stock
market, which has been unsettled lately by rising interest rates in
Japan.
   Analysts said that heightened fears that rates would have to
climb further in this country to stay competitive in the
international marketplace.
   A sale by the government Tuesday of 40-year bonds to finance a
rescue plan for troubled thrift institutions drew a chilly
reception from investors.
   As the outlook for interest rates has worsened, investors have
begun to face the possibility that the recent slowdown of the
economy might deepen in the months ahead.
   Brokers also said a weak attempt by stocks to rally on Tuesday
left many traders unimpressed and disheartened.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.87 to
2,615.32.

   A man who set fire to his son seven years ago
was paroled today under a veil of secrecy and orders to wear an
electronic leash and stay away from the boy, who is keeping a BB
gun handy just in case.
   Charles Rothenberg ``is out on parole and he has reached his
destination,'' said Tipton Kindel, spokesman for the state
Corrections Department.
   Rothenberg, wearing an electronic device that will enable
authorities to monitor his movements, left prison shortly after
midnight, Kindel said, adding that Rothenberg is now the
most-watched parolee in California history.
   David Rothenberg, who is now 13, said he was frightened by his
father's release and keeps a pellet gun by his bed just in case.
``I'd shoot his eye out if he ever came over. I'd blind him,'' he
said in a recent interview.
   The boy was severely disfigured by the fire set by his father in
a custody dispute with his estranged wife.
   Prison officials were determined to keep Rothenberg's
whereabouts secret during his three-year parole and wouldn't even
confirm he was paroled within the United States.
   Earlier today, on NBC's ``Today'' show, Kindel said Rothenberg
``will be under the strictest parole ever for a California
parolee.''
   ``He will not be allowed to leave the jurisdiction to which he
is being paroled. He will not be able to go to the county where his
son lives. He will not be allowed to have any contact with his son,
his ex-wife or her current husband,'' Kindel said.
   If Rothenberg violates parole, he will be returned to prison for
up to a year.
   David lives in Orange County with his mother, Marie, and
stepfather, police Officer Richard Hafdahl, who helped in the
investigation of the fire.
   Asked on ``Today'' what is being done to protect David, Kindel
said that if Rothenberg is ever ``not where he's supposed to be,
then the family, David, will be notified immediately.''
   Rothenberg, 49, set fire to his son in a Buena Park motel room
in 1983 after a telephone argument in which his estranged wife said
Rothenberg would not be able to see the boy again.
   Rothenberg had taken the boy on a holiday to Southern California
from New York, where the boy was living with his mother.
   ``If I can't have him, nobody else can,'' Rothenberg said when
arrested six days later. He told authorities he was going to kill
himself but was too much of a coward.
   David, dragged from the inferno by motel guests, suffered
third-degree burns over 90 percent of his body.
   Rothenberg was convicted of attempted murder, arson and other
charges and got the maximum, a 13-year prison term. The sentence
was cut in half because of good behavior.
   If he had been convicted today, Rothenberg would have faced up
to life in prison.
   In a letter last month to the Los Angeles Times, Rothenberg
called his own release ``an unforgivable act.''
   Prison officials kept the relocation plans secret, fearing a
repeat of the hysteria surrounding the 1987 release of Larry
Singleton.
   Singleton, who had raped a teen-ager and left her for dead after
hacking off her forearms with an ax, had to be moved repeatedly
from Northern California communities, where he was rejected by an
outraged public.
   Kindel acknowledged in the ``Today'' interview that if
Rothenberg's location is revealed it could be a problem for the
Corrections Department, and said ``another high-profile parolee'' _
an apparent reference to Singleton _ cost the state more than $2
million to move him from location to location.
   ``We're hoping to convince the public that not only is its
safety assured, but so is the safety of David Rothenburg, so that
perhaps they will simply ignore this man and shun him and not give
him the media attention that we've learned he actually enjoys,''
Kindel said.
   David said he would always live in fear of his father.
   ``He will be out there, free. He probably has people out there
right now looking for me. I will have to live the rest of my life
on the line ... always looking behind me,'' the boy said recently.

<HEAD>Health Minister Issues Warning on Hereditary Diseases, Illiteracy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The health minister has warned that China's high
incidence of hereditary diseases, disabilities and illiteracy is a
threat to national development, it was reported Wednesday.
   Minister Chen Minzhang told a conference that China must use
propaganda, education and legislation to improve the quality of its
1.1 billion people, according to the China Youth News and the
overseas edition of the People's Daily.
   Chen said China has 51 million people with physical and mental
disabilities, about 5 percent of the population. It has 22 million
sufferers of hereditary diseases and birth defects afflict 1.3
percent of babies.
   Congenital diseases are so serious in some remote areas where
marriages among close relatives are common that some communities
have come to be called ``deaf and mute'' villages or ``simpleton''
villages, the minister said.
   He said 1.7 percent of children under 14 are classified as being
of low intelligence.
   The nation has more than 200 million illiterates and
semi-literates, one-fourth of the world's total. Eighty percent of
the illiterates are women, and 40 million children, almost all in
rural areas, have quit school.
   Chen noted that China has made significant progress in some
areas since the Communists came to power in 1949, with the rate of
mothers dying in childbirth dropping from 150 per 10,000 in 1949 to
5 per 10,000 today. The infant mortality rate has dropped from 20
percent to 3.5 percent.
   But Chen said the low quality of the population has become a
``heavy millstone around our neck in the journey to catch up with
international competition and modernize.''
   He called for legislation to improve the quality of new babies,
but the reports did not say whether he was referring to
strengthening the nation's one-child policy or controversial
proposals to prevent some women from giving birth.
   Northwest China's Gansu province, in one of the nation's most
impoverished regions, in 1988 passed a law prohibiting
``dull-witted'' and retarded people from having children, and
saying such people could marry only after being sterilized.
   The Chinese Association for the Handicapped last spring also
called for a national ``law of eugenics'' to improve population
quality.

<TEXT>
   A free newspaper keyed to the industry of
Washington, the federal government, will begin daily publication
Oct. 1, the paper's backers said Wednesday.
   The Washington Reporter will be given away to ``people in the
federal government, politics, media, lobbyists, lawyers and others
who make up this industry in Washington,'' said publisher Roger G.
Kranz. Limited newsstand and out-of-town distribution are also
envisioned.
   Kranz likened the planned Monday-Friday newspaper to Daily
Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, entertainment trade dailies
published in Hollywood.
   ``There's a lot that goes on there, and there's an awful lot
that goes on here that is undercovered,'' he said.
   ``This will be a trade newspaper for the industry in Washington,
not a major metropolitan daily newspaper,'' the publisher said.
   The one-section, 16-page Reporter will not cover sports or the
weather or have a foreign staff, he said, although he envisions
supplementing the paper's own reporting with wire service stories.
   ``It will be a newsaper for and about people who work here,
inside the beltway,'' he said.
   Kranz, 39, resigned in August as group vice president of the
National Journal, where he was in charge of advertising sales,
circulation and manufacturing.
   John S. Prescott Jr., a former president of The Washington Post
and recently retired president of the publications division of
Whitney Communications Co. in New York, will be chairman of the
board.
   The editor will be Barry Sussman, who runs an independent public
opinion polling and consulting company in Washington and formerly
served as an editor with The Washington Post and United Press
International.
   Kranz said he and Prescott are investors in the paper, but
Sussman is not. He declined to name other investors.
   The publisher said he has raised enough money to keep the paper
operating ``for quite a while,'' but he wouldn't say how long. The
Reporter's first-year budget is $12.45 million.
   Kranz said that he expects the paper to have a circulation of
about 30,000 and that a prototype will be published late next month.
   Kranz said the newspaper would have a staff of 100, including 50
on the editorial staff, and he expects to pay salaries competitive
with those of other news organizations in Washington.
   He said he has talked with prospective advertisers and ``there
is a great deal of interest in having a viable medium reaching a
very upscale, targeted audience.''
   Outside Washington, he said, there will be limited same-day
distribution to Wall Street and midtown New York and to shuttle
terminals in New York, Boston and Washington.

   President Najib said Wednesday there
was no sign the Soviet Union plans to cut massive military and
economic aid to his Marxist government in its war with Moslem
guerrillas.
   At a news conference, he reiterated a pledge to step down if he
believed such a move would end the 11-year-old civil war with the
U.S.-backed insurgents.
   Najib said that despite Moscow's hands-off response to the
democratic reforms that have toppled Communist governments in
Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union appears determined to continue
helping his country.
   ``We have not seen any sign which might demonstrate the
unwillingness of the Soviet Union to fulfill its contractual
commitment to its South Asian neighbor,'' he told foreign
journalists.
   The burly former chief of the nation's secret police said his
government already has carried out the kind of reforms that are
transforming East bloc nations.
   ``There are great lessons that should be learned by us all from
the developments there,'' Najib said.
   Flanked by army troops carrying automatic assault rifles, he
responded to written queries submitted in advance and then answered
questions directly from reporters. Security personnel frisked all
of the reporters and searched their belongings.
   Najib called on the guerrillas to put down their weapons and
talk peace.
   But, he added, ``If the opposition launches more attacks, our
response will be stronger and more crushing than ever before.''
   The major rebel leaders, based in neighboring Pakistan, have
rejected any talks with Najib's government.
   They are fighting to topple his ruling People's Democratic Party
of Afghanistan and replace it with an Islamic regime.
   The party seized power in a bloody military coup in 1978. Najib
assumed office in 1986 after former President Babrak Karmal
resigned, ostensibly for health reasons.
   Najib originally offered to resign for the sake of peace in 1987.
   Asked if the offer still stood, he said: ``If the need arises
for stepping down, I can assure you that I will sacrifice
everything for the sake of assuring peace in my country.''
   An estimated 1.5 million people have been killed in the war and
more than 5 million Afghans _ a third of the country's prewar
population _ have fled to refugee camps in Pakistan and Iran.
   Soviet troops spent nine years fighting the guerrillas to a
stalemate before Moscow withdrew the last of them in February 1989.
   About 100,000 soldiers moved into Afghanistan on Dec. 27, 1979,
to replace one pro-Moscow government with another and stayed on to
fight the insurgents.
   The guerrillas and many Western countries predicted Najib's
government would fall soon after the withdrawal, but government
forces have held their ground. They continue to hold Afghanistan's
major cities and the guerrillas control most of the rugged
countryside.
   The United States, Britain and several other countries closed
their Kabul embassies a year ago ahead of an expected fight for the
capital.
   While the insurgents have intermittently attacked with rockets,
Najib's government remains firmly in control and France recently
announced plans to reopen its embassy.
   Najib said he ``warmly welcomes'' the decision.
   ``We reiterate that the republic of Afghanistan is ready to
assure the safety and security of all foreign diplomats,'' he said.
   He denied widespread claims that his party and its security
force, known as Khad, have killed or tortured thousands of
opponents in the nearly 12-year-old rule of the People's Democratic
Party.
   ``The baseless allegations against the party are only a pretext
for avoiding talks and continuing the war,'' he said.
   Najib said his formula for peace would begin with a six-month
cease-fire and talks among officials of his government and
guerrilla leaders. He also said he supports the formation of a
coalition government and elections held under international
supervision.

   Soviet forces today fought with Azerbaijani
nationalists who blockaded the port of Baku with oil tankers to
protest the government's military occupation of their war-torn
republic, news reports said.
   Soviet television reported that nationalists aboard the tankers
attacked a marine passenger terminal in the harbor, where people
wait to board ships.
   ``There was an exchange of fire,'' TV said, and soldiers were
wounded. It gave no further details of the harbor battle except to
say that a group of people was later detained. Residents in Baku
said in telephone interviews that they had heard there was a
40-minute gun battle in the harbor.
   Tass reported that the blockade of the port by Azerbaijani
extremists, which had lasted several days, had been lifted.
However, it was not clear whether the nationalists had chosen to
end it or had been forced to do so.
   Before the battle, the captains aboard the tankers in the
oil-producing Caspian Sea port had threatened to blow up their
vessels if the Soviet military tried to break the blockade, an
activist said.
   Earlier today, Soviet troops trying to crush the nationalist
uprising in Azerbaijan arrested 43 people and seized copy machines
from the offices of unofficial groups during overnight raids in
Baku, news reports said.
   The media reported growing threats against the Russian
population as Azerbaijanis reacted to Soviet troops sent to Baku to
restore order.
   The official Tass news agency said today the Soviet military had
evacuated more than 16,000 soldiers' dependents in the face of the
threats.
   Demonstrations and strikes were banned in Baku, and activists
were told they face 30 days in jail if they try to organize
protests, Tass said. But Tass said a general strike called to
demand the withdrawal of Soviet soldiers paralyzed factories and
transport.
   The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennady Gerasimov, said
militants continue to storm weapons depots and had stolen more than
5,000 guns and other items in the past two days in the southern
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   Organizations that do not have formal approval to exist have
been blamed by authorities for 11 days of violence, which began
with anti-Armenian riots in Baku and led to Azerbaijani demands for
independence.
   ``Forty-three people were arrested when the headquarters of
illegally functioning informal organizations were neutralized,''
Tass said. ``Many copying machines and propaganda facilities were
confiscated.''
   But Tass said the National Defense Committee, a militant branch
of the Azerbaijan People's Front, and allied groups were banned.
Mamed Ali-Zade, one of the National Defense Committee's directors,
was arrested at his home about midnight, his wife said.
   The People's Front, the underground group that has coordinated
much of the resistance, has taken particular heat from authorities.
   Soviet television said gunfire continued Tuesday night in parts
of Baku, but activists and news reports said the city was quiet
this morning.
   The Azerbaijani Communist Party Central Committee planned to
meet late tonight, said Azerbaijani parliament spokesman Nizami
Sakyakhov. The late hour will ensure the meeting is conducted after
curfew, when demonstrators are unlikely to surround the building,
he said.
   Jeikhun Mula-Zade, a political scientist, said the party would
consider breaking from the Soviet party in Moscow. The committee
also is to elect a new first secretary to replace Abdul-Rakhman
Vezirov, who was fired after Soviet troops poured into Baku and met
violent resistance, Mula-Zade said.
   According to official reports, at least 170 people have been
killed since ethnic violence broke out Jan. 13 in Baku between
Azerbaijanis, who are mostly Shiite Moslems, and Armenians, who are
mainly Christians. Azerbaijanis say the death toll is far higher.
   The republics both want control over the region of
Nagorno-Karabakh, which is populated mainly by Armenians but under
control of Azerbaijan.
   The violence spread from Baku as Armenians and Azerbaijanis took
up arms against each other in the hills around Nagorno-Karabakh and
on the borders between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   Dozens of people were killed as Soviet troops entered Baku on
Saturday to end the violence.
   The Soviet soldiers are ``more and more often being chosen as
targets'' by local fighters, Tass quoted Interior Ministry Maj.
Gen. Yevgeny Nechayev as saying today.
   Earlier in the week, there were reports of Azerbaijani soldiers
fighting their Soviet colleagues, but the Moscow-based labor
newspaper Trud said today those reports were lies.
   Trud reported attacks on Russians' apartments in Baku and said
Azerbaijanis are refusing to sell bread to Russian residents. About
100,000 Russians live in the city of 1.8 million.
   Niayaz Gajiyev of a self-appointed citizens' investigation
commission said Russians are following the example of the military
families and fleeing Baku. He insisted there was no real danger,
although he said anti-Russian sentiment is rising due to outrage
over the troops' presence.
   Adding to the tension was the appearance of ``terrorists dressed
in military uniforms,'' Tass said.
   Radio Moscow said negotiations between leaders of the two
republics on how to stop the conflict continued, but little
progress was reported.
   Azerbaijani lawmakers on Monday declared void a state of
emergency declared by President Mikhail Gorbachev, and they said
they would vote to secede if Soviet troops were not withdrawn.
   Elsewhere in Azerbaijan, there were reports of individual
skirmishes but also claims of improvements.

   About 3,000 police officers proclaiming
solidarity with pro-democracy forces rallied Wednesday in Leipzig,
where police last fall attacked demonstrators at the start of the
popular reform movement.
   A major anti-Communist warning strike in Dresden and other
worker demonstrations pointed to continued dissatisfaction with the
country's political and economic state.
   Blaring police sirens accompanied the march through Leipzig, in
which officers carried signs saying ``We Too Are The People'' and
``For a Democratic Police,'' the state-run news agency ADN said.
   Another sign said ``Police Are Not Stasi,'' a reference to the
hated secret police that the Communist-led government has pledged
to dissolve.
   At a rally, police demanded punishment for higher-ups who
ordered the attack on Leipzig pro-democracy demonstrators in
October, ADN said.
   Leipzig is considered the birthplace of the reform movement that
brought down hard-line leader Erich Honecker on Oct. 18. Police
there and in other cities violently broke up demonstrations in
early October.
   Workers in Dresden left their jobs for one hour Wednesday to
warn against continued Communist dominance and a revival of secret
police spying, ADN reported.
   Organizers said workers in 200 businesses, including luxury
hotels, street cleaners and members of the Dresden Philharmonic,
heeded the warning strike call by a local state industrial
enterprise, according to ADN.
   About 1,000 state health care workers took to the streets in
Zittau to demonstrate for higher pay, ADN said.
   Employees at a Leipzig district hospital also demonstrated
Wednesday, protesting a lack of doctors and nurses and the
``critical state'' of technical equipment, the agency said.
   The protest on the hospital grounds took place during visiting
hours and involved only off-shift employees, so patient care was
maintained, ADN said.
   East Germany has lost many of its most qualified workers in the
exodus of citizens to West Germany. About 340,000 East Germans left
last year and the outflow continues.

<HEAD>Fed Survey: Continued Slow Economic Growth in 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's economy is expected to grow
slowly in 1990, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday in a report that
forecast improvements in some regions later in the year.
   ``Economic activity is expanding slowly in most of the nation,
with conditions somewhat stronger in the West than in the East,''
the central bank said in a summary of its ``Beige Book.''
   The report did not mention any inflationary problems _ the
reason the Fed originally slowed the economy by driving up interest
rates to dampen demand and cool off price pressures.
   The Fed switched course last June and has permitted short-term
rates to drop gradually in an effort to keep the slowing economy
from stopping altogether and falling into a recession.
   But the central bank has not acted since mid-December and just
last week, the White House broke its usual no-comment stance on Fed
activities and said that ``lower interest rates are justified.''
   Nevertheless, the latest Beige Book report appeared to indicate
that most participants in the Fed's survey, completed Jan. 18,
thought the central bank has achieved its so-called
``soft-landing'' _ continued sluggish growth but no recession.
   ``The outlook is for slow growth in all regions in 1990,'' it
said, ``Some respondents expect improvment late in the year.''
   The survey is conducted eight times a year in preparation for
meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's monetary
policy-setting arm. The next meeting is Feb. 6-7.
   Looking back on the economy in recent weeks, the Beige Book
summary found that:
   _``Retail sales in the holiday season ranged from
`disappointing' in Boston to modest in Philadelphia and Atlanta and
relatively strong in Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco;
however, widespread discounting generally reduced store profits. ...
   ``Retailers expect flat sales or modest increases through the
first six months of 1990. Results in the first weeks of January
were said to be encouraging.''
   _``Manufacturing activity is generally sluggish with production
declines in some industries (autos, in particular) offsetting gains
in others (such as commercial aircraft and oilfeild equipment.
Several districts reported that the steel and computer industries,
among others, may be `bottoming out.' ...
   ``Most manufacturers expected slow growth in 1990, with a weak
first half followed by gradual improvement.''
   _``Unseasonably cold weather dampended construction activity in
some areas, but real estate markets generally held steady.''
   _``Cold or dry weather also adversely affected citrus, vegetable
and winter wheat crops. Other agricultural and resource-related
sectors did moderately well.''
   _``Most districts discussing real estate reported steady or
modestly improved conditions ... Expected declines in mortgage
interest rates provided some reason for optimism in the real estate
outlook.''

   A record 10 new members, including the first
two blacks, were named to the National Inventors Hall of Fame on
Wednesday.
   ``The 10 individuals we honor here today are the real heroes of
our age. ... They are the thinkers and the problem solvers. They
have opened new doors and pioneered new frontiers in science and
technology,'' said Jeffrey M. Samuels, acting commissioner of
patents and trademarks.
   George Washington Carver and Percy F. Julian were among the
inventors selected for inclusion this year, marking the first
blacks to be selected since the hall was begun in 1973.
   Carver was selected for his work developing more than 500 uses
for peanuts, including cooking oil and printer's ink, and for sweet
potatoes, including synthetic rubber. He died in 1943.
   Julian, a Chicago chemist, was the first to synthesize cortisone
and other human hormones. Before the synthetic cortisone came onto
the market, the only cortisone available to treat rheumatoid
arthritis was produced from oxen bile, at a cost of hundreds of
dollars a drop.
   ``He was one of the most persistent men I have known,''
reflected Samuel B. Massie of the U.S. Naval Academy, once a
colleague of Julian, who died in 1975.
   Tenacity was also cited as a necessary ingredient by another man
being honored.
   Robert S. Ledley of Georgetown University in Washington said the
prerequisite skills for success as an inventor include a pragmatic
attitude, boldness, fortitude ``and stick-to-itiveness almost to
the extent of obsession.''
   Ledley was named to the hall of fame for his development of the
computerized tomographic, or CT, scanner, a device similar to an
x-ray machine that allows doctors to see the inner workings of the
body in great detail.
   Another man honored was Herman Hollerith, described as having
left behind a motto for the generations: ``do not fold, spindle or
mutilate.''
   Hollerith invented the punch-card system that helped pave the
way to modern computers. A Census Bureau employee, he halved the
time it took to tabulate the 1890 national head count and later
went on to help found the giant IBM Co.
   In addition to Carver, Julian, Ledley and Hollerith, inventors
selected for the hall of fame for 1990 are:
   _Graham C. Durant, John C. Emmett and C. Robin Gannellin,
medical chemists who developed the drug cimetidine, which has
greatly reduced the need for surgery for ulcer victims. It is known
by the trade name Tagamet.
   _Charles P. Ginsberg, who led the engineering team that
developed the first practical videotape.
   _Kenneth S. Olsen, developer of the magnetic memory core for
computers and founder of Digital Equipment Corporation.
   _Eugene J. Houdry, a French-born engineer who developed the
procedure that allowed crude oil to be processed into high grade
gasoline and aviation fuel.
   The selection of 10 new members is the most since six were
picked in 1985, and brings total membership in the Hall of Fame to
85.
   Founded at the U.S. Patent Office in Arlington, Va., the hall of
fame will eventually move to Akron, Ohio, where construction on a
new facility is to begin later this year.

   A Florida lawyer scheduled to stand trial
next week on conspiracy charges in the July 1988 kidnapping of a
missing Jackson heiress claims he was not in Jackson on the day she
disappeared.
   Newton Alfred Winn, 65, said in a court document filed Monday
that he was in his hometown of St. Petersburg, Fla., on July 26,
1988, at the time police believe Annie Laurie Hearin was kidnapped.
She has not been seen since.
   Winn is scheduled to go on trial Monday in U.S. District Court
in Hattiesburg on charges of conspiring to kidnap, mailing a
threatening letter and perjury.
   A note found at her home after she was taken told her husband,
Robert M. Hearin, to make payments to Winn and 11 others who fought
legal battles with School Pictures of Mississippi Inc., which he
owned.
   Hearin mailed checks totaling nearly $1 million to the 12 people
named in the ransom note. Winn returned his check.
   Several witnesses may be called to verify Winn's whereabouts on
the day of the kidnapping, the court document says.
   John M. Colette of Jackson, Winn's attorney, refused to comment
Tuesday.
   The witness list includes Joe Donahey, a Clearwater, Fla.,
attorney who has represented Winn. Donahey said Tuesday that he
could not discuss his contact with Winn.
   ``Any contact I had with Mr. Winn would have been within an
attorney-client relationship,'' Donahey said.
   Other than July 26, Winn does not provide an alibi for six other
dates, times and places as requested by prosecutors.
   The court papers said a federal court regulation ``calls for a
response only concerning the time, date and place of which the
alleged offense was committed.''
   Three of the dates in 1988 that are significant to the
conspiracy charge are April 7 or 8, July 19, and July 25.
   Neighbors of the Hearins testified a man resembling Winn was
seen in the neighborhood before the kidnapping. Also, a
superintendent for a construction crew working at Fondren
Presbyterian Church recalled seeing Winn looking around the
neighborhood two blocks from the Hearin home.
   The three other dates are significant to the charge that Winn
caused a ransom letter to be mailed to Mrs. Hearin's home:
   _Aug. 5 or 6, 1988, at a hotel in Deland, Fla. Prosecutors said
Winn met a woman there and asked her to mail a letter that arrived
at the Hearin home on Aug. 15. The letter, in Mrs. Hearin's
handwriting, said her captors would seal her in a cellar if their
demands were not met.
   _A Saturday in late August, at a planetarium and museum in
Bradenton, Fla. Prosecutors say the woman met Winn again and
received the initial $250 of a $500 payment.
   _Feb. 18, 1989, at a hotel in Deland. Prosecutors said Winn paid
the woman the remaining $250.

   A van carrying migrant farm workers ran
off a foggy rural road and plunged into a murky canal today,
drowning 10 people and injuring two, authorities said.
   The driver and a front-seat passenger crawled out of the
submerged van through windows. Sheriff's deputies dived into the 12
feet of water but were unable to rescue the others trapped inside,
said Lt. Bill Chamness.
   ``Some of them had stuck their arms out trying to get out, but
they just didn't make it,'' he said. ``When the deputies dove in to
get them, they were already dead.''
   The privately owned van carrying 12 Mexican migrant workers ran
off the road at a curve near this farm community about 100 miles
northwest of Miami, Chamness said.
   The road cuts through a sugar cane district intersected by
numerous irrigation and drainage canals.
   ``We think it was probably due to dense fog,'' Chamness said.
``Evidently they got on the curve quicker than they thought, and
instead of turning they went straight into the canal.''
   The survivors, both men, were taken to Hendry General Hospital
with minor injuries such as scrapes and bruises and showed no
immediate signs of broken bones or internal injuries, said
emergency room nurse Maggie Kocher.
   The driver was admitted in stable condition for observation, and
the passenger was treated and was to be released, she said.
   The sheriff's office didn't receive word of the 7:30 a.m. crash
until 7:46 a.m., authorities said. A sheriff's diver who attached a
tow-truck cable to the back of the van estimated visibility in the
canal at 2 feet, Chamness said.

<HEAD>U.S. Official: Mandela's Release and Major Reforms Expected Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top U.S. official on
Africa said Wednesday that President F.W. de Klerk assured him
black leader Nelson Mandela will be freed soon.
   In an upbeat assessment of South Africa's racial conflict, the
U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs, Herman
Cohen, said both the white-run government and the anti-apartheid
movement seek to negotiate a political settlement.
   He said he believed the South African government had undertaken
a commitment ``to make fundamental change in the South African
political system so as to bring about democracy.''
   ``Equally important is my impression that the anti-apartheid
movement is also in the process of making a reciprocal ...
commitment'' to a negotiated solution, Cohen told a news conference.
   Cohen's assessment of de Klerk's reforms was far more positive
than the one offered by a U.S. congressional delegation that
visited earlier this month. It came on the same day the State
Department criticized South African police for using force to break
up a peaceful protest Tuesday in Cape Town.
   Cohen spent three days in South Africa meeting government
leaders, including de Klerk, and anti-apartheid figures such as
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   Cohen was asked if de Klerk specified a date for Mandela's
release, the country's best-known black leader.
   ``He (de Klerk) did not give me a date of release, though he
said it would be soon,'' Cohen said. ``He said I could expect major
developments soon.''
   Mandela, 71, has been imprisoned more than 27 years and is
serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the
government.
   Asked if he expected the government to lift the 3{-year-old
state of emergency and legalize Mandela's African National Congress
guerrilla movement, Cohen said, ``The answer basically is yes.''
   Since de Klerk assumed power in August, he has sought to ease
political tension with a series of reforms, and he called for
negotiations with the disenfranchised black majority.
   The ANC says it will not negotiate until Mandela and all
political prisoners are freed; political trials are halted; and the
state of emergency is lifted.
   The ANC's armed wing said Wednesday it supports these
conditions, as set by the group's political leaders, and will not
put down its weapons until they are met.
   The guerrillas ``are loyal to the ANC and their position is no
different ... if the enemy begins to show signs of seriousness to
undertake negotiations, our people will be ready to go into
dialogue. The onus is on the enemy,'' guerrilla commander Joe
Modise said in Lusaka, Zambia, where the ANC has its headquarters.
   The last U.S. delegation to visit South Africa was led by Rep.
Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., who said the de Klerk government was not
prepared to establish a democracy. Wolpe said unless de Klerk makes
major reforms soon, Congress should consider additional economic
sanctions against South Africa.
   The United States imposes limited sanctions under 1986
legislation that demands South Africa undertake several specific
reforms, including lifting the state of emergency, legalizing
opposition groups and freeing political prisoners.
   In Washington on Wednesday, State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler reitered these demands.
   Speaking of Tuesday's incident in Cape Town, in which police
violently dispersed about 5,000 black and mixed-race students
protesting government education policies, she said: ``We deplore
the use of force to stifle peaceful protest.''
   ``We have long urged an end to violence and repression as an
important step in the process of change in South Africa,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said.
   Two black men were shot to death Wednesday when police opened
fire to disperse a protest alleging police brutality, authorities
said.
   Officers used tear gas and birdshot to disperse the protest
after a rally by about 5,000 people at a stadium in Khutsong, 50
miles west of Johannesburg.
   Members of the crowd left the stadium and began causing
disturbances in the streets, including stoning police vehicles,
police said. Two men were killed, three were injured, and 13 people
were arrested, they said.

<HEAD>LaRouche Supporters Thrown Off Ill. Primary Ballot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Illinois Electoral Board today struck five
supporters of imprisoned political extremist Lyndon LaRouche from
the Democratic primary ballot.
   The board, in a 7-1 vote, agreed with a finding by its hearing
officer that the slate of five pro-LaRouche candidates had only
3,865 valid signatures of the required 5,000 to get on the ballot
for the election in March.
   The panel also agreed that LaRouche candidate Patricia
Nobel-Schenk has not lived in Illinois the required three years to
run for comptroller.
   The board disagreed with the hearing officer's finding that the
petitions had been fraudulently represented to voters as supporting
certain political causes instead of certain political candidates
when they were circulated.
   Two of the candidates present for the vote _ Sheila Jones for
lieutenant governor and Janice Hart for secretary of state _ stood
afterward and said, ``We shall overcome.'' They unfurled a banner
and likened the board action to ``Nazi justice.''
   ``If the LaRouche candidates can be thrown off the ballot this
way, then what's any citizen's protection against being thrown in
the streets because their government thinks their life is
useless?'' Hart asked.
   Jones said an appeal is planned.
   Also thrown off the ballot were Ronnie Fredman, running for
treasurer, and gubernatorial candidate Mark Fairchild, who threw
the state Democratic Party into turmoil by scoring an upset in the
1986 primary for lieutenant governor.
   The same year Hart upset the mainstream Democratic candidate for
secretary of state. Hart and Fairchild lost in the general
election, but their victories crippled Democrat Adlai Stevenson's
effort to unseat Republican Gov. James R. Thompson.
   Fredman and Ms. Noble-Schenk are under indictment on charges of
defrauding an elderly woman of $80,000 in cash and securities.
   The LaRouche followers' petitions were challenged by supporters
of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Neil Hartigan, currently
attorney general.
   John Kennedy, an attorney for the state Democratic Party,
charged that the petitions were ``heavily tainted with fraud.''
   Hartigan has called the LaRouche organization an ``anti-Semitic,
racist hate group'' that ``does not belong on the ballot.''
   LaRouche, a conspiracy theorist and frequent presidential
candidate, is serving a 15-year federal prison term for fraud and
conspiracy.

<HEAD>Hrawi Reportedly Plans Crack Security Force For West Beirut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Elias Hrawi will create a crack
security force to combat terrorism in west Beirut and encourage
foreign diplomats to return to the city's Moslem sector, a military
source said Wednesday.
   Also on Wednesday, rival Shiite Moslem militias dueled with
howitzers and rocket launchers in southern Lebanon, and police said
one person was killed and another injured.
   The renewed fighting in Iqlim al-Tuffah ended a 16-day relative
lull in the latest round of clashes between the pro-Iranian Shiite
Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the Shiite Amal militia. By police
count, 98 people have been killed and 279 wounded since Dec. 23.
   ``No advances were reported by either side,'' said a police
spokesman, who cannot be identified in line with standing rules.
   The military source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the new security force for west Beirut will be made up of 400 men
drawn from the elite combat forces of the army and police.
   Hrawi said Tuesday that west Beirut would become a ``security
oasis'' under the security force.
   All Western diplomatic missions have left the city since
mid-1984 because of terrorist attacks and kidnappings of
foreigners. Most of the acts were blamed on Shiite Moslem
underground factions affiliated with Hezbollah.
   In all, 18 foreigners, including eight Americans, are missing
and believed held hostage. The longest-held is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, kidnapped
in west Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Asked whether the proposed security plan would also cover the
slums of south Beirut _ a Hezbollah stronghold where most of the
Western hostages are believed held _ the military source said:
``Most probably south Beirut will be included.'' He refused to
elaborate.
   He said all militias will be banned from west Beirut as part of
the plan, and that the commando squad ``will be trained on special
assignments and might be equipped with helicopters for raid
intervention in case it is needed to deal with special and
sensitive assignments, such as protecting foreign diplomats.''
   The source said a 3,000-man brigade from Hrawi's 22,000-member
army will deploy in west Beirut in the first stage of the security
plan.
   According to the source, the security plan also calls for a
gradual withdrawal of Syrian troops from west Beirut.
   Hrawi and Syrian President Hafez Assad discussed the plan in
three days of talks in Damascus that ended Tuesday.
   Hrawi on Wednesday summoned army commander Gen. Emile Lahoud and
his senior military aides to a meeting at his residence in west
Beirut for more talks, a presidential statement said. It gave no
further details.
   Lahoud is to visit Damascus next week for discussions with
Syrian officers, the military source said.
   Hrawi appointed Lahoud commander Nov. 24 after he was elected
president by Parliament.
   Hrawi also dismissed rebellious Christian Gen. Michel Aoun as
commander-in-chief of the armed forces and interim prime minister,
but Aoun refused to leave the presidential palace.
   Hrawi and Assad said at a joint news conference in Damascus on
Tuesday that ending the standoff over who runs Lebanon's government
was a priority.
   ``If at the end there is no alternative, I shall use force,''
Hrawi said. ``I will use everything to stop the partition.''
   Assad said he would commit whatever forces Hrawi needed to oust
Aoun.
   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon by dint of the 40,000
troops it has stationed there. They were deployed under a 1978 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate and Syria has rejected Aoun's demands
that they be withdrawn.
   Hrawi was elected president under an Arab League-brokered plan
to end Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war. Aoun rejected the plan
because it does not specifically call for Syria's withdrawal or
give a timetable.
   He recently ordered Lebanon's media not to refer to Hrawi as
president. The nation's seven daily newspapers did not publish
Wednesday due to a strike called Tuesday by a press group to
protest Aoun's attempts to censor the media.

   A junk dealer whose property was
searched by FBI agents is a suspect in the mail bombings that
killed a federal judge and a civil rights lawyer, a law enforcement
source in Washington said today.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Robert
Wayne O'Ferrell failed a series of lie detector tests administered
by the FBI.
   Meanwhile, court documents obtained today by the Associated
Press show that O'Ferrell once complained in a legal brief that
America's court system ``is corrupt.''
   The letter was to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, of
which the slain judge was a member.
   Results of polygraph tests are not always reliable and are
inadmissable in criminal trials. It could not be determined what
questions O'Ferrell was asked when he gave answers the FBI
polygraph expert considered deceptive.
   On Tuesday, the FBI declined to comment when asked if O'Ferrell
is a suspect. ``I would not comment that he is a suspect, only that
he is one of a number of people we have interviewed,'' said FBI
agent Chuck Archer.
   O'Ferrell, who sued his former employer, Gulf Life Insurance
Co., lost the case on appeal in April from the 11th Circuit. A
member of that court, Judge Robert Vance, was killed Dec. 16 by a
package bomb mailed to his Mountain Brook home. Two days later, a
similar bomb killed black attorney Robert Robinson of Savannah, Ga.
   A letter claiming responsibility for the mail bombings was sent
to an Atlanta TV station by a person or group calling itself
Americans for a Competent Federal Judicial System.
   O'Ferrell said today that FBI agents have not found a typewriter
that reportedly links his typewritten court correspondence with
typed material sent by the mail bomber.
   The court documents obtained by the AP include a legal brief
apparently typed by O'Ferrell while acting as his own lawyer. It
states in part: ``The law and court system in THESE UNITED STATES
is corrupt, that I never had anything to do with but, I know you
can help clean it up. ... If anyone has been mistreated by Gulf
Life ... the Courts, and two Attorneys, I really believe that I
have.''
   The capitalization is as it appears in the document.
   O'Ferrell's father, J.C. O'Ferrell, said the FBI had questioned
him about the activities of another son, 49-year-old James
``Buddy'' O'Ferrell, an independent trucker who lives in McKenzie,
80 miles west of Enterprise.
   ``They were trying to say my two sons had something to do with
that bombing up in Birmingham,'' J.C. O'Ferrell said. ``They asked
had I ever heard either one talk bad about colored folks, or if my
sons ever made threats on any judges. I said, `No, my children
weren't raised that way.'''
   The father said the agents fingerprinted him and took blood and
hair samples from his farm in southwest Alabama.
   FBI agents ate lunch with Robert Wayne O'Ferrell and spent much
of Tuesday talking to him, but he has not been charged.
   ``I don't have anything to hide,'' he said. ``When it's all over
with, I'll be glad to get with the media and go into details.''
   O'Ferrell said he had received a bomb threat himself Monday
night.
   ``I know nothing about bombs, how to put them together or
anything like that,'' he said. ``That kind of stuff has never
fascinated me.''
   Federal agents used earth-moving equipment to dig up the tank
beside O'Ferrell's rural home, and dug up another tank at
O'Ferrell's tin-covered salvage store. The agents refused to say
what they were looking for.
   Dozens of federal officers converged on Enterprise during the
weekend.
   Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, a tall, silver-haired man, lives in a
small wooden house about five miles west of Enterprise with his
wife, Mary. They have two daughters, Tammy, 20, and Danielle, 13.
   The one-time rural preacher said he asked members of his church
``to pray for my family that we can get through this thing and I've
asked them to pray for the FBI to find whatever they are looking
for.''
   ``They were looking for a typewriter that we may have sold,''
O'Ferrell said. ``It's possible we could have had the typewriter in
the last two years. But we don't know what typewriter they're
talking about. You don't keep a record of everything you sell.''
   The FBI has speculated that the pipe bombs were sent by one or
more white supremacists.
   Morris Dees, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said
O'Ferrell's name is not in the files of white hate groups that the
center's Klanwatch project maintains.
   In addition to the bombs that killed Vance and Robinson, two
other bombs were disarmed after being found at the Atlanta office
of the 11th Circuit and the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People office in Jacksonville, Fla.

<HEAD>Foreigners May Soon Have to Pay for Zimbabwean Brides</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreigners may soon have to pay for
their Zimbabwean brides, a top law officer said Wednesday.
   Attorney General Patrick Chinamasa said the hopeful husbands
would probably have to pay the traditional African ``bride price''
under proposed changes to laws covering the powers of tribal chiefs
in this Southern Arican nation.
   The payment, known as ``lobola,'' is usually made in cattle,
cash, clothing and household goods, and it is recoverable if the
woman proves to be barren.
   In the past, whites did not come under the jurisdiction of
traditional chiefs' courts, also known as community courts, where
matrimonial issues arise.
   Most mixed marriages have been conducted in Western-style
ceremonies.
   Under proposed laws, however, ``you could well find a white
person in front of a community court'' in any dispute over bride
price, Chinamasa told legislators.
   He was asking the parliament to approve proposals that restore
some legal powers to chiefs and remove the exemption of foreigners
from customary law.
   Chinamasa conceded that in cases where German and Danish aid
workers in rural Zimbabwe married local women, they could be liable
for backdated payments.
   The laws are expected to come into force later this year.

   Money does make a difference, education
officials told a House subcommittee Wednesday as disagreements
erupted over public school finances that enable some districts to
spend up to eight times more than others in the same state.
   ``The notion that money does not make a difference is
preposterous on its face,'' said Arthur E. Wise, director of the
Center for the Study of the Teaching Profession at the Rand Corp.
   ``When the advantaged have the better financed schools, and the
disadvantaged the poorly financed schools, America continues to
provide unequal education to those who most need what school has to
offer,'' he said.
   Wise was one of five witnesses at an Education and Labor
subcommittee hearing on a bill to require states to equalize
education spending statewide or face the loss of federal aid.
   The committee chairman, Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., who
introduced the bill Tuesday, cited statistics from a congressional
study that found most states spend widely different sums to educate
children living in different areas. Illinois, New Jersey, New York,
Texas and Vermont were said to have the sharpest disparities.
   K. Forbis Jordan, a professor at Arizona State University, said
Census Bureau data show the levels of revenue disparity among the
states ranged from 1.00 to 1 in Hawaii to 8.49 to 1 in New York.
   States with spending disparities below two-to-one include
Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, North Carolina,
Rhode Island, South Carolina and West Virginia. The common element
in these states, he said, is a relatively small number of school
districts.
   States with spending disparities above four-to-one were Alaska,
Arkansas, Colorado, Minnesota, Montana, New York, North Dakota,
Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, and Vermont. The financing systems in
Montana and Texas are being challenged.
   Rep. Peter Smith, R-Vt., questioned the accuracy of the
statistics, from the Congressional Research Service, saying they
were ``radically wrong.''
   He said the data do not reflect differences among school
districts, such as population and location.
   Albert Kauffman of the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund in San Antonio, Texas, said that in Texas, where
the state Supreme Court recently found the system of financing
public school education violates the state constitution, ``the
richest districts pay half the taxes and spend twice as much on
their students.''

<TEXT>
   Thousands lined up outside the Prado museum
Wednesday to view 79 paintings by Diego Velazquez on the first day
of what is billed as the most complete retrospective of the
17th-century Spanish master's work.
   Museum officials said they were forced to close the doors
leading into the exhibition several times to ensure that no more
than 500 people were in the nine rooms housing the works at any one
time.
   During the first five hours after the doors opened, more than
4,000 people viewed the show, which is expected to draw up to 1
million visitors by the time it closes March 30.
   The Prado retrospective, inaugurated Tuesday night by King Juan
Carlos and Queen Sofia, dwarfs the 38-painting exhibition that drew
550,000 people to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art between
October and Jan. 7.
   Loans from European and U.S. institutions brought together 80
percent of the known works by Velazquez, many of which come from
the Prado's own collection, officials said.
   The most important loans included ``The Rokeby Venus'' from
London's National Gallery, not shown in Spain since 1969, and
``Portrait of Juan de Pareja'' from the Metropolitan, never shown
in Spain.
   Neither ``Venus'' nor ``Las Meninas'' was included in the New
York show.
   Forty-nine of the works on display belong to the Prado, six to
other Spanish institutions and the rest to foreign collections.
   Among other works assembled are ``The Forge of Vulcan,'' ``The
Surrender of Breda,'' ``The Spinners'' and ``Equestrian Portrait of
Philip IV,'' the painter's royal patron.

   The penalty for beating a person who
burns the U.S. flag would be reduced to a $1 fine under a bill
approved by a state House committee.
   ``For many widows or parents of loved ones who were killed in
wars, all they have left is the flag,'' Democratic Rep. Shelby
Rhinehart told the House Judiciary Committee. ``If they want to
beat the heck out of someone who burns the flag, so be it.''
   Assault normally carries a sentence of 11 months and 29 days and
a fine of up to $2,500.
   Rhinehart, who sponsored the bill, said Tuesday it was prompted
by the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling last year that burning the flag
is a form of protest protected by the First Amendment, which
guarantees freedom of speech.
   Rep. Tommy Burnett questioned Rhinehart's proposal, saying it
would ``permit a constitutional act to now be assaultable.'' No
committee member was recorded as voting against the bill when it
was sent Tuesday to the House Calendar Committee.
   The measure is a long way from becoming law. It must be set for
debate on the House floor by the Calendar Committee, which has the
power to kill it. It also must be approved by both the Senate
Judiciary Committee and the Senate.

<HEAD>Bush Calls GOP Lawmakers' Social Security Plan `Innovative'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Wednesday lambasted a
proposed Social Security tax cut as sleight of hand but labeled as
``innovative thinking'' a plan that eventually would make the
retirement system private.
   Bush said he was ``not prepared to endorse'' a plan sponsored by
Rep. John E. Porter, R-Ill., and the House Republican whip, Newt
Gingrich of Georgia. ``It's worthy, though, of consideration, of
some study,'' he said.
   ``People are concerned about Social Security, so when you have
innovative thinking of that nature, I don't want to just gun it
down,'' Bush added. ``I'm not going to support it.''
   Under the Porter-Gingrich proposal, Social Security taxes would
be gradually channeled into a type of mandatory Individual
Retirement Accounts. As workers' IRAs grew, their claim on Social
Security would decline. By the time today's workers are retired _
about 50 years from now, Porter estimated _ Social Security would
be fully privatized.
   Seldom since Republican nominee Barry Goldwater's losing 1964
presidential campaign has a national GOP figure spoken publicly of
even the remote possibility of replacing Social Security with
private retirement plans. The president's refusal at a news
conference to reject the Porter-Gingrich proposal was quickly
criticized by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat
whose own tax-cut plan was dismissed by Bush.
   Moynihan, who is considered one of the government's top
authorities on Social Security, said of the Republican
congressmen's proposal, ``The president described that as
`innovative thinking. Was it innovative thinking after 50 years of
steady payments to start dismantling Social Security? I don't think
so.''
   The subject of Social Security arose at Bush's news conference
when he was asked about Moynihan's plan to roll back this year's
tax increase and reduce one scheduled next year. The aim of the
bill _ which has attracted widespread interest, if not support, in
Congress _ is to halt the use of surplus Social Security taxes to
make the federal deficit appear far smaller than it is.
   Bush said he sees no need for any major change in Social
Security at this time. ``I think the system has been, in and out
over the years, basically a pretty fair system,'' he said.
   Moynihan's bill is ``a disguise for increased taxes around the
corner,'' Bush said. ``This is a ... sleight-of-hand operation,''
he added, noting that shortly after Moynihan outlined his plan,
Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., proposed to replace revenues from
the reduced Social Security taxes with a national sales tax.
   ``There is no sleight of hand whatsoever,'' Moynihan replied,
``and I do not see that there was any need to make such a
characterization.''
   Lawmakers from both parties have expressed displeasure that
Social Security surpluses _ which are building at the rate of $1
billion a week _ are being used for deficit reduction, rather than
being invested solely for the benefit of future retirees.
   Moynihan has been speaking on this issue for months. But it
grabbed public attention for the first time when, during a slow
news period over the December holidays, he called for cutting the
taxes if they are not going to be saved for Social Security.
   There were these other developments Wednesday:
   _ Bush said Congress should wait to see his own proposal for
gradually taking Social Security surpluses out of the federal
deficit calculation. That long-range plan, starting in 1993, would
require that a growing portion of the surplus be used to retire
publicly held debt.
   _ House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he has serious
reservations about Moynihan's proposed tax cut, which would require
Congress to find an additional $55 billion for deficit reduction
this year. He said he fears that instead of raising taxes or
cutting spending to make up that loss, Congress and the president
would opt for increased borrowing.
   _ Reps. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., and Richard Durbin, D-Ill.,
proposed to roll back only this year's increase in the Social
Security tax rate _ which rose from 7.51 percent to 7.65 percent of
the first $51,300 of wages. Congress then could use the rest of
this year to devise a plan for ensuring that Social Security taxes
are used solely for Social Security.

   Lithuania's Roman Catholic cardinal has called for
independence for the Soviet republic and said the church there is
still not free, it was reported Wednesday.
   Cardinal Vincentas Sladkevicius told the weekly Roman Catholic
magazine Il Sabato that he did not want to create problems for
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but Lithuanians would not
accept the Soviet occupation of the Baltic land.
   ``We say this only: let perestroika go its way, and let us go
ours,'' the cardinal said.
   ``The church has promoted for more than 50 years the cause of
national independence, and it will continue to do so. The
annexation of 1939 is based on a villanous pact between the Soviets
and Nazis, it cannot be defended in any way on the legal plane.
Even Moscow has recognized this. We want to separate from the
Soviet Union,'' Sladkevicius said, according to the excerpts of the
interview released in advance by the magazine.
   The cardinal said a law on conscience being prepared by Soviet
officials was new ``only in name'' and that ``the church in
Lithuania is not yet free,'' the magazine reported.
   Lithuania, an independent country before World War II, was
occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 and has been considered a
stronghold of nationalism. An estimated 2.5 million people, or 80
percent of Lithuania's population, are Roman Catholics.

   An enterprising Czechoslovak
community on Wednesday took out an ad in one of West Germany's
newspapers to offer its unwanted statue of Josef V. Stalin to
collectors for $50,000.
   The advertisement in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung from the
local authorities in the north Moravian city of Zabreh said the
larger-than-life statue of the late Soviet dictator was dismantled
Dec. 8.
   Touting the monument as a collectors' item _ ``probably the last
memorial of this symbol of violence in Europe,'' _ it offerd the
statue for $50,000 it said would go toward refurbishing the local
hospital.
   ``The new owner will not only get a unique curiosity, he will
also be supporting the struggle of the Czechoslovak people for
freedom and democracy,'' the ad pledged.
   Zabreh is not alone in trying to sell its Stalin monument. A
similar project has been touted in the Czech town of Komarov, near
Prague, while the city of Ostrava is to dismantle its giant
two-faced monument showing Stalin and Soviet founder Vladimir I.
Lenin.
   The statues survived the de-Stalinization campaign that saw
thousands of similar monuments dismantled across the Communist
world because Czechoslovak authorities were slow to take up the
policy, adopted in the Soviet Union after 1956.
   A giant statue of Stalin that once dominated central Prague was
dismantled only in the early 1960s.

   Federal budget shortfalls seem stuck at the
$140 billion level in coming years, making it ever harder for
Congress and the White House to meet Gramm-Rudman deficit targets,
congressional analysts said Wednesday.
   Congressional Budget Office Director Robert D. Reischauer also
projected that the U.S. economy would sidestep a recession this
year. And he predicted that Congress would be hard pressed to plug
the huge budget gap Sen. Daniel Moynihan's proposed Social Security
payroll tax cut would create.
   In remarks that came five days before President Bush reveals his
1991 budget, Reischauer said a healthy economy would not be enough
to allay the government's persistent fiscal woes.
   ``Over the next few years, no further progress in reducing the
deficit can be expected under current budgetary policies,''
Reischauer told the Senate Budget Committee.
   Reischauer said he expected the shortfall in fiscal 1990 _ which
runs through Sept. 30 _ to be $138 billion. He predicted deficits
of $138 billion next year, $135 billion in 1992, and $141 billion
in 1993, the year the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law requires a
balanced budget.
   The economic and budgetary projections issued by the
non-partisan CBO were decidedly more pessimistic than estimates
expected Monday when the White House's Office of Management and
Budget releases Bush's budget.
   OMB is expected to assert that only about $35 billion in savings
will be needed next year to meet the Gramm-Rudman shortfall target
of $64 billion, $37 billion less than the savings the Congressional
Budget Office says are needed.
   CBO's estimates have little legal significance in
budget-writing. But they are relied on by many lawmakers _
especially Democrats _ as a voice of truth in the often partisan
fiscal process.
   ``The Office of Management and Budget consistently understates
the deficits by resorting to the most optimistic economic
assumptions it can credibly _ and now sometimes even incredibly _
employ,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser,
D-Tenn.
   The CBO forecast that the economy would expand by a low 1.8
percent this year, measured from the final quarter of last year
through the third quarter of 1990, well below the 2.6 percent the
administration is expected to predict. The stronger the economy,
the greater the revenues the government collects and the lower the
budget deficit.
   Fifty-one private economists surveyed by Blue Chip Economic
Indicators, a private publication, have projected that the economy
will expand by an average of 1.7 percent this year.
   Reischauer said he believes that a looser monetary policy the
Federal Reserve has practiced since last June will help drive
interest rates down and thus avoid a recession. Most private
economists agree that a slowdown this year is unlikely.
   ``CBO expects that the Federal Reserve will safely steer the
economy between the shoals of a recession and higher inflation,''
he said.
   Reischauer was pressed by the committee's ranking Republican,
Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, on the wisdom of a bill
introduced by Moynihan, D-N.Y., that would reduce the Social
Security tax. Moynihan's cut would reduce government revenue
collections by $7 billion this year and $55 billion in 1991.
   Reischauer referred to past failings of Congress and the White
House to find large amounts of budget savings and said, ``It's hard
to argue I think that we'd be out there raising income taxes or
other taxes, or decreasing spending, in large amounts.''
   Moynihan and others have argued that the growing annual
surpluses in the Social Security are masking the true size of the
federal deficit. Without this year's $66 billion Social Security
surplus, the 1990 deficit would be $204 billion, Reischauer said.

   Hundreds of protesters broke through
lines of police and soldiers Wednesday and surged toward government
headquarters, demanding the leadership resign and accusing it of
being a front for Communist rule.
   The crowd of about 1,000 people at Victory Square pushed through
two lines of unarmed police and then through a line of armed
soldiers who took no strong action to hold them back.
   The army moved in tanks very slowly and the crowd retreated,
still chanting ``Communists in disguise!'' and ``Elections without
the Front!'' _ a reference to the National Salvation Front's plans
to participate in elections May 20.
   The Front, which has been governing Romania since dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu was ousted Dec. 22, had said it would not run
candidates in the election. On Tuesday, however, it reversed itself.
   Opponents have accused some Front members who served under
Ceausescu of being sympathetic to the Communists, and they fear the
Front will put the Communist Party in power again. Hours before the
rally, the largest opposition party, the National Peasant Party,
called on the Front to resign.
   ``The National Salvation Front must resign today as it can't be
both a referee and a player,'' the party said in a communique read
by party leader Corneliu Coposu.
   Some Peasant Party members left their headquarters after the
communique was read and joined a small demonstration under way at a
nearby university.
   The demonstration picked up supporters as marchers wound through
Bucharest's icy streets, stopping at the major sites of the
revolution and finally coming to Victory Square.
   The protesters singled out President Ion Iliescu, who heads the
Front, shouting: ``Down with Iliescu!''
   ``If Iliescu wanted to gain power, he should have gotten
signatures on petitions and formed a party,'' said one protester,
engineer Adrian Mihalcea.
   The Peasant Party accused the Front of trying to steal victory
from the young people and others who fought Communism and Ceausescu.
   ``They are making us believe that they want to put the
Communists in power again, even worse Ceausescu-ism. Only the words
are different ... but the methods of the Salvation Front are the
same as Ceausescu's methods,'' party vice president Ion Puiu said
in an interview.
   Puiu said the communique would be circulated to all the
traditional parties _ the National Liberal Party, the Social
Democratic Party and the Green Party _ for comments and additions
to demonstrate ``anti-Communist solidarity.''
   The Peasant Party said it planned a major demonstration against
the Front on Sunday.
   The National Peasant Party, founded in 1892, was one of the
major forces in Romanian politics before the Communists came to
power after World War II. It is the largest and best organized of
the 15 new or revived political parties that plan to contest the
election.
   Iliescu, a former Communist Party member who ran afoul of
Ceausescu and was demoted from party secretary, told a rally Jan.
12 that the ``Communist Party is dead,'' and he outlawed it.
   The following day, Iliescu reversed himself, saying the ban had
been a hasty decision and that voters would decide the party's fate
in a Jan. 28 referendum. The referendum was canceled because of
time constraints and because officials said the questions on it
were moot.
   The decision to compete in May even alienated some Front members.
   The daily Romania Libera said Wednesday that a former leading
dissident, Doina Cornea, resigned from the interim leading body,
saying she did not want to take part in a ``power struggle.''
   Puiu said the Peasant Party wants the Front to resign
immediately and that the new government should be formed either by
technical experts who can guarantee the administration of the
country and conduct fair elections, or by all political parties
committed to the same goals.
   The Front, meanwhile, said it planned to meet with all parties
Saturday to discuss campaign funding and the proposed election law.
It said U.N. observers will monitor the vote.
   Puiu said he supports a boycott of the meeting to protest the
Front's decision.
   Adrian Jeara, a Peasant Party member, said his party has 150,000
members.
   ``The biggest problem of our party is that we haven't got the
opportunity to appear on radio or television and we don't have our
own journals,'' he said.
   When party members asked the government for paper to print a new
journal, he said, the government told them there wasn't enough
paper so they couldn't have any.
   However, Premier Petre Roman told the daily Adevarul recently
there was no shortage of newsprint and that all parties which want
to publish their own newspaper will get it.

   Comedian Redd Foxx is trying to block an
auction of his possessions, including jewelry, several cars and
other personal property, by the Internal Revenue Service.
   A Foxx attorney, Paul Whitford of Beverly Hills, said the sale
Saturday would conflict with efforts to liquidate the comedian's
estate in bankruptcy court.
   The case, in which Foxx listed $2.1 million in assets and $2.5
million in liabilities, stems from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy Foxx
filed in 1983. Some of Foxx's property has been sold off
periodically to satisfy creditors.
   IRS agents seized the personal property and Foxx's home during a
raid Nov. 28 on the comedian's Las Vegas house.
   The IRS scheduled the auction to try to reduce Foxx's tax
liability of $900,000, including penalties and interest.
   A hearing is scheduled Friday before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Clive
Jones to consider an injunction blocking the IRS sale.

<HEAD>U.S., Soviet Negotiators to Get Peak at Each Other's Nuclear
Warheads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators, seeking to speed
work on a proposed arms pact, have agreed to the first ever peek at
each other's nuclear warheads, U.S. spokesmen said Wednesday.
   Under the terms of a little publicized protocol signed in Geneva
on Monday, U.S. and Soviet inspectors will take a close look
sometime this spring at warheads atop one each of the other side's
land-based and submarine-launched ballistic missiles, the spokesmen
said.
   Determining the exact number of warheads aboard missiles and
bombers will be key when the two sides complete work on the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, to cut superpower arsenals by 30
percent to 50 percent.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is to hold talks in Moscow
on Feb. 6-7 with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in
an effort to speed work on the START accord for possible signing at
an expected summit next June.
   Three previous arms control treaties have not been ratified by
the Senate, in large measure because of doubts that they could be
verified.
   Under the new protocol, the Soviets also will have a chance to
look at two U.S. B-1B bombers, and the Americans at two Soviet
Tupolev-95 ``Bear'' bombers. One version will be designed to carry
cruise missiles and the other to carry standard bombs.
   The Soviet ballistic missiles to be inspected are the landbased
SS-18 and the the submarine-launched SS-N-23, said Matthew Murphy,
a spokesman for the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
   The Soviets say the SS-18, like the U.S. MX missile, carries 10
warheads, although one intelligence source said that the big Soviet
booster can lift up to 20 nuclear devices. The Soviets will get a
close look under the tip of an MX and the new D-5, to be deployed
aboard submarines starting this March.
   The D-5 is designed to carry eight and the SS-N-23 to carry four
warheads, according to information published by the two sides.
   ``This agreement marks the first time that the U.S. and the
Soviet Union will inspect a number of each other's nuclear warheads
on ballistic missiles,'' said a statement read by David Denny, a
State Department spokesman.
   The exact time and place of the inspections has not been
disclosed.
   President Bush last June proposed that the two sides test
verification techniques before conclusion of START, an unusual step
designed to enhance ability to monitor the compliance of the other
side.
   At the 1987 Washington summit, the sides agreed on the number of
warheads to be attributed to each existing type of stategic
ballistic missile and on the need for inspections.
   Precautions will be taken to ensure that the inspectors learn as
little as possible about the internal design of the warheads,
possible by shrouding them in cloths so that opposing experts see
only several lumps inside the delivery vehicles, said one source.
   ``It's the dance of the seven veils,'' said the source.
   In a separate development, the State Department said U.S.
officials still hope to sign at the June summit an agreement on two
unratified nuclear test treaties from the 1970s.
   However, the administration is balking at planned follow-on
talks designed to lead to lower ceilings and numbers of underground
nuclear tests, said sources who spoke on condition they not be
further identified.
   The decision was reported earlier by The Washington Times and
The Washington Post.
   The State Department statement said that ``in this round of the
current talks, we are continuing to focus on the completion of
protocols to provide for effective verification of the Threshhold
Test Ban Treaty of 1974 and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty
of 1976.''
   The treaties were never submitted to the Senate, but in 1986
President Reagan told Congress he would do so after reaching
agreement with the Soviets on a means to verify that neither side
was exceeding the 150-kiloton ceiling set by the pacts.

<HEAD>Cheney: Freeze Construction Contracts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney has ordered a
three-month freeze on new military construction contracts, the
Pentagon announced Wednesday.
   Cheney, in a statement, said he was forced to take the
cost-saving step ``in light of the coming changes in the force
structure and disposition of the U.S. Armed Forces.''
   Several weeks ago, Cheney ordered a freeze on hiring civilian
DOD workers in a similar effort to trim spending.
   The moratorium on construction contracts goes into effect
immediately and lasts until April 30.
   It applies to the award of all new military construction
contracts, including those for architectural and engineering design
services, the statement said.
   The Pentagon's fiscal 1990 military construction budget as
approved by Congress amounted to around $8.5 billion. The bill made
wholesale cuts in President Bush's request for foreign bases, but
added millions of dollars for domestic installations.
   The statement said the only exceptions are those contracts and
options excercised:
   _To the extent that the United States has a legal obligation
under a statute, treaty or international agreement.
   _To comply with the requirements of the defense authorization
amendments and base closure act of 1988.
   _To meet urgent requirements upon the approval of the secretary.
   The secretary also ordered that the secretaries of the military
departments and the directors of the defense agencies review their
plans for military construction and report on their revisions by
mid-April.

   President Bush on Wednesday denied a report
that his family members were split on abortion, calling the account
``pure, unadulterated malarkey.''
   On the volatile issue that continues to bedevil him and the
Republican Party, Bush also said he sees no problem in campaigning
for GOP candidates who are pro-choice, even though he opposes
abortion except for rape, incest or a threat to a mother's life.
   Newsweek magazine this week said abortion was discussed at a
private meeting of the Bushes with their children and spouses, and
the men all opposed abortion while the women all took a pro-choice
stance.
   Bush was asked at a news conference if Barbara Bush supports
abortion rights.
   ``No I couldn't confirm that ... And the meeting that I read
about in one of the most respected publications was pure,
unadulterated _ `malarkey' is the word I like to use. It just
wasn't there,'' Bush replied.
   Mrs. Bush, when asked about abortion, refused to state a
position, saying that no matter how she answers it will offend
someone.
   Since the Supreme Court last year gave states greater authority
to regulate abortions, pro-choice activism has escalated and many
Republican officeholders have embraced that policy.
   Bush and the Republican Party have shifted from the hardline
anti-abortion rhetoric to a policy of inclusion, stating the
Republican Party has room for pro-choice advocates as well.
   Bush reiterated that point of view on Wednesday when asked about
his support for pro-choice party members.
   ``I was elected to try to fulfill the platform and the programs
that I believe in. And so that's my personal choice, but that
doesn't mean I have lack of respect for others, and that I'm going
to go out and not campaign for people that disagree with me on this
issue.''
   Bush once supported the Supreme Court 1973 decision that
legalized abortion, but now opposes it. He opposes abortion except
to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest. He
favors federal payment for abortions only to save the mother's life.
   Bush addressed the annual March for Life on Monday by telephone
from the Oval Office, telling the anti-abortion activists before
they marched to the Supreme Court of ``my deep personal concern
about abortion on demand.''
   ``Let me assure you that this president stands with you on this
issue of life,'' said Bush, who supports a constitutional ``human
life'' amendment to outlaw most abortions.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Bill Bradley announced Wednesday the
formation of an advisory council to push for ratification of a U.N.
convention on rights for children and highlight problems plaguing
youth worldwide.
   The convention stresses the importance of primary health care
and education, and it recommends measures to protect against child
labor, sexual exploitation and drug abuse. It also sets up steps to
protect children in cases of adoption, foster care and juvenile
justice proceedings.
   Bradley, D-N.J., said Americans must make a commitment to
protect the rights of all children.
   ``If American children have the right to be free from polio and
whooping cough and dysentery, so do the children of Ethiopia and
Pakistan. If American children have the right to be free from
famine, so do the children of the Sudan,'' Bradley said at a news
conference.
   Twenty countries must ratify the convention for it to have the
force of an international treaty. The U.N. General Assembly
approved the document in November.
   A report issued in December by the U.N. Children's Fund said
spending by Third World countries on armaments and debt service
rather than health and nutrition could doom 100 million children to
death by disease and starvation in the 1990s.
   The annual report by James Grant, UNICEF executive director,
said that almost 8,000 children die each day because they are not
immunized. Nearly 7,000 die daily from dehydration caused by
diarrhea, and about 6,000 are killed each day by pneumonia, the
report says.
   The cost of immunizing all these children and providing
medicines for dehydration and pneumonia would be about $2.5 billion
a year, the report says.
   Bradley said the advisory council will include a cross-section
of people from throughout the United States.
   On Tuesday, Bradley and Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., introduced a
resolution in the Senate urging President Bush to send the
convention to the Senate for deliberation as soon as possible.

<TEXT>
   President Bush made fewer nominations to the
federal bench in his first year than either of his two immediate
predecessors, leaving 52 of 75 vacancies on district and circuit
courts with no nominee, the Democratic Study Group said Wednesday.
   In a study of presidential appointments to executive and
judicial positions, the group also said that 28 percent of the 390
presidentially appointed positions in agencies and departments that
require Senate confirmation remained unfilled as of Jan. 1.
   At the end of former President Reagan's first year in office, 82
percent of presidentially appointed positions in the agencies and
departments were filled, according to a recent Library of Congress
survey.
   The DSG, an organization of Democratic members of the House,
said Bush had 75 vacancies to fill in federal courts during his
first year in office. Of these only l5, five on the appeals courts
and 10 on district courts, were nominated and confirmed in 1989.
   Separately, the White House announced Bush's appointment of two
federal appeals judges and eight U.S. District Court judges on
Wednesday.
   Chase Untermeyer, director of the White House Office of
Presidential Personnel, and David Runkel, spokesman for the Justice
Department, were telephoned for comment on the DSG study, but were
not immediately available.
   Citing figures from the Administrative Office of the U.S.
Courts, the DSG said 18 vacancies remained on appeals courts and 42
in the district courts, in which federal civil and criminal trials
are conducted.
   Confirmation of some nominees has been held up by Sen. Jim
Jeffords, R-Vt., in a dispute with the administration over the role
to be played by Republican senators in the selection of judicial
nominees.
   ``But the dispute between Senate Republicans and the White House
cannot explain the slowness of the Bush administration this past
year in filling judicial vacancies,'' the DSG said.
   It said the 15 confirmed nominees in the first year of the Bush
administration compared with 40 in Reagan's first year and 30 in
1977, former President Carter's first year in office.

   A Palestinian man convicted of Israel's worst
mass murder was sentenced Wednesday to seven life terms in prison,
one for each person he strangled, Israel television reported.
   A three-man Tel Aviv District Court tribunal also sentenced
Mohammed Halabi, 32, to an additional 40 years in prison for
conviction on two attempted murder charges, the television said.
   Halabi, who confessed to the murders, said he was recruited by
the Moslem fundamentalist Hamas, or Zeal, movement and killed the
four Jews and three Arabs to prove he was not working as an
informer for the Israeli security service, news reports said.
   In its sentencing, the tribunal said it thought criminal motives
were behind the slayings of the five women and two men.
   The seven victims were strangled with nylon rope and their
bodies were found Oct. 20 in two apartments in Tel Aviv and
neighboring Jaffa.
   The victims were all alleged to be involved in prostitution and
drug dealing.
   Police said Halabi was from the Jabaliya refugee camp in the
occupied Gaza Strip and had worked previously for Israeli's Shin
Bet security service.

   A former Pentagon official who helped guide
and justify the defense build-up of the 1980s said Wednesday he now
favors scrapping the MX and Midgetman missiles, but pressing ahead
with ``Star Wars'' research and the stealth bomber.
   Richard Perle, a former assistant secretary of defense who was
among the most adamant backers of the Reagan administration defense
increases, said the liberalization of the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe also means the United States should consider proposing
deeper weapons cuts in arms control negotiations.
   ``The Soviet empire in collapsing,'' Perle told the Senate Armed
Services Committee. ``Time is on our side,'' said Perle, a resident
fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank on the
conservative side of the political spectrum.
   In response to the lessening threat of the Warsaw Pact, Perle
suggested possibly reducing ground forces and ``skipping the next
generation of weapons systems.''
   ``I would not proceed with either the Midgetman or the rail
mobile MX: The current generation of ICBMs (intercontinental
ballistic missiles) should prove adequate and the next generation
... will benefit from further research and development if it is
delayed for a few years,'' he said.
   The MX is a 10-warhead missile already deployed; the Midgetman
is a smaller single-warhead missile being developed.
   The administration has recommended putting the 50 MX missiles,
now based in underground silos, on rail cars. The trains would move
about during an international crisis and present a harder-to-hit
target than silos. The Midgetman would be placed on special
off-road trucks for the same reason.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the panel's ranking Republican, told
Perle he objected to slashing both missile systems because that
action would remove leverage in arms control talks.
   But Perle responded that the ``importance of these agreements
has declined dramatically.''
   The Pentagon should also think about ``making do'' with many of
the current generation of conventional weapons, including fighter
jets, Perle said.
   But he said he would proceed with the B-2 bomber, known as the
stealth bomber for its radar-evading design. At $530 million a
copy, the aircraft has been attacked by many members of Congress as
too expensive, at least if the Air Force buys all 132 it wants.
   While the changing Soviet empire is good news for the West,
Perle said it would be foolish for the United States to dismantle
its defenses precipitiously.
   ``We would be wise to wait a little longer before confidently
predicting that we can afford to be weak in the face of
uncertainty,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union spend as much as 20 percent of its Gross
National Product on defense, compared with 6 percent by the United
States, he said.
   As for the Strategic Defense Initiative, known as Star Wars,
Perle said the concept of a shield to protect the nation from all
enemy missiles is unrealistic.
   At the same time, he said a ``serious program'' of research and
development oriented towards a partial shield can and should go
forward even in the face of shrinking defense budgets.
   ``As the prospect of nuclear proliferation draws closer, we
should be reminded that the threat is neither exclusively Soviet
nor, for that matter, exclusively deliberate. There are third
countries and there are accidents and these two reasons alone would
justify a vigorous research and development program,'' Perle said.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the panel's chairman, said the committee
wants defense planners at the Pentagon to present a new five-year
strategic plan before lawmakers make specific budget-cutting
recommendations.

<HEAD>FDA Asked to Halt Sales of Milk From Cows Given Synthetic Hormones</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some farm and consumer advocates want the Food
and Drug Administration to halt the distribution of milk from test
cows treated with a synthetic hormone until the agency completes a
scientific review.
   The group said Wednesday that, if there is not an immediate
suspension, the FDA should at least require labels on milk and
other dairy products that originate from test cows treated with
bovine growth hormone, or BGH.
   Brian Ahlberg of the National Farm Coalition said a similar
request for halting the distribution of milk from test herds was
made to the FDA last August but the agency had not responded.
   The genetically engineered hormone is bovine somatotropin and is
usually called BST by the Agriculture Department and the chemical
companies that make it. Doses of the hormone, which also occurs
naturally in a cow's body, boost milk production.
   Jeremy Rifkin of the Foundation for Economic Trends, a long-time
critic of the synthetic growth hormone, told a news conference his
organization is preparing a petition asking the FDA for ``a full,
thorough, internal investigation'' into allegations that the agency
has worked with the drug companies and has been hiding test results
from the public.
   Rifkin said the hormone ``has no redeeming social value'' and is
bad for farmers, cows, taxpayers and, perhaps, consumer health.
   During questioning, however, coalition spokesman Ahlberg said
the group was not claiming adverse health effects from milk
produced by hormone-treated cows.
   Rifkin also accused FDA of promoting the growth hormone before
the agency has given it final clearance.
   ``This is outrageous,'' Rifkin said. ``This is activity that
should have been condemned a long time ago.''
   Rifkin said that if FDA approves commercial use of the drug, his
group will seek court action to ban it.
   The FDA did not return calls for comment on Rifkin's allegation
that the agency has been actively promoting the drug prior to its
final approval.
   Speakers at the news conference said they had no information
from the FDA about the extent of testing or how much milk is
entering the U.S. consumer pipeline, although Rifkin and other have
said they thought the percentage is quite small.
   They said producers include herds maintained by land-grant
universities and private farmers. The common practice is to sell
milk from test herds to local dealers, who then mix it with other
milk for distribution.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, has asked the General Accounting Office to investigate
allegations by Dr. Richard Burroughs, a fired FDA veterinarian,
that tests of the chemical were inadequate.
   Burroughs has accused the FDA of toning down criticism of
research on the hormone at the request of chemical companies.
   The FDA has said the hormone-treated milk is safe to drink.
   The hormone is manufactured by Monsanto, Eli Lilly, Upjohn and
American Cyanamid, who have said the FDA review has been the most
thorough of any study of animal drugs. And the FDA says it has not
made any exceptions in its drug-testing standards.

<HEAD>New Agreement Reached to Enforce Strip Mining Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department reached agreement with
environmental groups Wednesday on a new plan to strictly enforce
the nation's strip mining laws.
   Hailed as ``an unqualified victory for the environment'' by
lawyers for conservation associations, the agreement is intended to
make it easier to revoke coal mining permits issued to companies or
individuals with records of past violations and to block the
issuing of new permits in such cases.
   At the heart of the new enforcement system is the planned
installation by July 1 of a new computer system with accurate and
complete information on coal companies and their owners.
   The aim is to match permit holders and applicants with past
violators of the 1977 strip mining law.
   The product of more than four months of intense negotiations,
the agreement settles a legal and environmental dispute that began
nearly a decade ago during James Watts' controversial tenure as
secretary of the Interior.
   Manuel Lujan, the present secretary, signed the new agreement in
exchange for the dropping of legal action against the department by
Save Our Cumberland Mountains, an environmental group based in the
coal-mining regions of Appalachia.
   Lujan said the agreement signals a new willingness by the
federal government to coooperate with environmentalists.
   ``Our aim is fair, even-handed enforcement of the surface mining
law,'' Lujan said in a statement.
   Brent Rushforth, an attorney who represented the environmental
group, said: ``The agreement should put an end to years of neglect
by the Department of the Interior, neglect which permitted mine
operators to routinely violate the law, scar the land and pollute
the water.''
   But Rushforth said the department has made other agreements over
the years to enforce the strip mining law and has not complied with
them.
   ``It is now up to the department to live up to the promises,''
Rushforth said. ``You can be sure we'll watch them closely.''
   Rushforth said that to comply with the agreement, the
department's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement
will most likely use a computer system developed by Save Our
Cumberland Mountains and the National Wildlife Federation.
   The plan for the department spelled out in the agreement has
these major components:
   _Coal-mining permit applications will be run through the
computer system with approval given only to those applicants with
no ties to violators.
   _A computer review of existing mining permits will be initiated
and enforcement action taken if a permit was improperly issued.
   _Development by March 1, 1990, of a plan to enforce federal
mining cessation orders.
   _Development of sanctions against people who intentionally give
incomplete or false ownership information on coal-mine permit
applications.
   The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 was
intended to ensure that land strip-mined for coal would be restored.
   Save Our Cumberland Mountains originally sued the department in
1981, contending the Surface Mining Act was not being enforced.
   An initial settlement was reached the next year but Rushforth
said little or nothing was done to implement it.
   The environmental group complained that in Appalachia, in
particular, ``shell'' companies have been used to evade the
requirements of the act with an operator mining a site, then
abandoning it unreclaimed.
   ``Enforcement efforts against the shell, which usually has no
assets or is bankrupt, prove futile,'' the group said. ``Meanwhile
the operator creates another shell company and repeats the `rape
and run' process.''
   In 1985, a court order was obtained requiring the department to
establish a computer system to contain data on the identity of
owners of mining permits and to match them with violators of the
act.
   But Rushforth said a series of congressional investigations
showed the system was ineffective and accomplished none of its
objectives.
   Harry Snyder, director of the Surface Mining office, said he
inherited ``a broken computer system that the government had spent
millions of dollars on and which didn't work.''
   Now, he said, ``You've got a new administration committed to
enforce this law fairly and in a committed way.''

   A manufacturer is recalling more than 20,000
tambourines sold natiowide as a novelty promotion item by two
restaurant chains because of sharp points and small parts that
could cause injuries to children, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission said Wednesday.
   The orange and white tambourines have a red, black, yellow and
gray picture of ``Chuck E. Cheese'' and were sold since 1987 at
pizza restaurants under that name.
   The items were also sold at Showbiz Pizza Restaurants, according
to a statement issued by the CPSC.
   In agency testing, the plastic tambourines broke along with the
wire holding metal cymbals attached to the side of the instrument.
   ``The cymbals could present a choking hazard and the wire parts
could cause puncture or laceration injuries,'' the CPSC statement
said.
   Neither the CPSC nor the California-based Dennis Poland Inc.
Merchandising Service, which produced the toys, is aware of any
injuries involving the tambourines, the agency said. The voluntary
recall is being taken as a preventive action.
   Consumers can return the tambourines to the store where they
were purchased for a full refund.

   The State Department criticized on Wednesday
as ``outrageous and indefensible'' the Haitian government's
expulsion of democratic opposition leaders and other measures to
silence dissent.
   In a followup to the weekend expulsion of four prominent
politicians, Haitian authorities arrested a leading business figure
Tuesday and ordered broadcast outlets to air only
government-approved news.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler called the
measures a ``blatant assault'' on civil liberties that puts at risk
the democratic transition the government has promised.
   ``We call upon the government of Haiti to cease any actions
which infringe on freedom of speech and other basic human rights
and (to) rescind its emergency measures.''
   Under questioning, Ms. Tutwiler raised the possibility that a
$41.4 million program of U.S. humanitarian aid funneled through
private groups might be curtailed.
   Later, however, other State Department officials denied that the
option was being considered, noting that the funds benefit the
Haitian people directly and are not handled by Haitian authorities.
   The only government-to-government aid provided to Haiti since
November 1987 was $10 million in food assistance last year.
   ``The actions of the Haitian government have been outrageous and
indefensible,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``They will affect U.S.-Haitian
relations and the prospect for future aid. You cannot destroy
democracy in order to save it.''
   Elections are scheduled for October but Ms. Tutwiler said they
will lack credibility if opposition leaders are not allowed full
participation.
   A Haitian Information Ministry statement told broadcasters that
it must approve their local news reports, and ordered them to
``refrain from relaying or broadcasting any information on Haiti
from stations broadcasting'' from abroad.
   In recent days, stations have relayed statements by exiled
opposition leaders broadcast by Radio France Internationale and the
Voice of America.
   Stations also were told not to broadcast anything ``likely to
incite agitation.''

   A tree planted at the University of
Virginia the year school founder Thomas Jefferson died has been
given a reprieve from becoming a woodpile, but not for long.
   The majestic but moribund McGuffey ash, planted in 1826, was to
have been taken down during the Christmas holiday break but will
continue to stand in a garden until late next month.
   Then its trunk and limbs, weakened by decay and lightning, will
be cut up and stacked under a protective cover while a subcommittee
of the university's faculty arboretum and landscape committee
decides what to do with the wood.
   J. James Murray Jr., the committee chairman, said he hopes ``at
least one piece of ceremonial furniture for the university ... a
table, a lectern or a chest'' is made from the tree's remains.
   The delay occurred because bidding for the job of removing the
164-year-old tree was redone to include preserving the wood for
some time, said Jeffrey S. Ertle, the university's assistant vice
president for landscape.
   ``I suspect that while we may use some of it right away, a lot
of that wood is going to sit around for a while, so we're going to
have to do a good job of preserving it,'' Ertle said.
   Albemarle Tree Co. won the contract with a bid of $6,480.
   The tree, which will be replaced with one of its offspring, was
named for the Rev. William H. McGuffey, who lived near where the
tree was planted but is better known as the developer of the
McGuffey Readers once widely used in public schools.

<TEXT>
   A Hispanic police officer convicted of manslaughter
in the deaths of two black men was sentenced today to seven years
in state prison in a case that triggered three nights of racial
violence.
   William Lozano, 31, who remained stern-faced throughout his
daylong sentencing hearing, listened impassively as Dade Circuit
Judge Joseph Farina imposed the sentence.
   ``We all value the sanctity of human life. We all value our
police officers and the crucial and difficult role that they play
in our community,'' the judge said. ``The incident in this case has
been deepl felt by the court and by the jury.''
   The defense, which promised an appeal beforehand, used the
hearing to outline its objections, including the judge's refusal to
exclude a black union official from the jury, his refusal to move
the trial from Miami and his rejection of testimony during the
sentencing hearing.
   The judge agreed to let Lozano remain free on $10,000 bond and
ordered his attorneys to file an appeal within 30 days.
   Lozano was fingerprinted in court, standard procedure after
sentencing. He and his attorneys refused to comment as they left
court moments later.
   Outside the courtroom, lead prosecutor John Hogan said: ``It was
obviously a very difficult decision. I think it's a fair sentence.
I think under the circumstances I don't think anyone should
complain. It's a substantial prison sentence.''
   Lozano fatally shot an unarmed motorcyclist and his passenger
died in the resulting crash, deaths that led to three days of
rioting in Miami's black neighborhoods a year ago.
   At the sentencing hearing, a defense lawyer unsuccessfully asked
for a new trial with the argument that the officer was prosecuted
to prevent racial violence rather than to achieve justice and
deserves a new trial.
   ``We don't have trials in order to satisfy mobs,'' attorney Roy
Black said, pointing to the ``ring of steel,'' the armored security
teams that surrounded the courthouse just before the verdict Dec. 7.
   Assistant State Attorney Richard Shiffrin said those arguments
had already been rejected at trial and that the extraordinary
security was needed to ensure justice, not prevent it.
   After attorney arguments, Adina Lloyd, mother of slain
motorcyclist Clement Lloyd, took the stand to ask for justice for
her son. She looked at Lozano and said bitterly, ``If it was my son
that did it to him, my son would be behind bars now.''
   Representatives of police organizations and Lozano's family
argued for leniency. Lozano's mother, Haydee Lozano, said he had a
hard childhood but ``has been the one who helped us through the
difficult battles.''
   Prosecutors maintained that under state guidelines, the
suspended officer faced a 12- to 17-year prison term. The defense
had argued a different interpretation, of three to seven years. But
the judge sided with the prosecution.
   Dade County's Community Relations Board has stressed to blacks
that it was unlikely Lozano would get the maximum sentence because
of his background and because he is a first-time offender.
   ``They have to be a little realistic,'' said crisis coordinator
Willie Sims.
   ``Not even Solomon could decide this one to satisfy everyone,''
said D. Marvin Jones, an associate professor of law at the
University of Miami.
   A light sentence would send the message that ``black life comes
at a discount,'' said Jones, who is black. ``The sentencing is very
symbolic. This case is a metaphor for racial problems in Miami.''
   Lozano shot and killed Lloyd, 23, as he fled from a squad car
pursuing him for running a stop sign. Lloyd's passenger,
24-year-old Allan Blanchard, died of injuries suffered when the
motorcycle crashed.
   The Jan. 16, 1989, deaths led to racial unrest here for the
fourth time in the 1980s, all linked to the killings of blacks by
white officers. In two of those cases, acquittals of the policemen
had sparked racial violence, and police braced for renewed rioting
as Lozano's trial neared an end last month.
   But on Dec. 7, a racially mixed jury convicted Lozano, and the
black neighborhood of Overtown celebrated in the street where Lloyd
and Blanchard died.
   Police did not anticipate any trouble after Lozano's sentencing
nor were any plans made to mobilize the entire force today.
   ``We're not doing anything differently,'' said police spokesman
Angelo Bitsis. ``It's going to be a normal operation.''
   Many blacks have called for Colombian-born Lozano to receive the
stiffest penalty possible.
   ``I don't know if he should get life,'' said Clemon Gardner, who
lives in the predominantly black Liberty City section, ``but I
think he should pay for the crime.''
   But there also has been a groundswell of support for Lozano,
especially from the Hispanic community and fellow officers, some of
whom wore black wristbands in solidarity with the policeman.
   Carlos Lopez, station manager for Colombian-oriented WOCN-AM,
said thousands of letters had been received urging the judge not to
send Lozano to prison. The station also collected $40,000 for
Lozano's defense, Lopez said.

<HEAD>Hmong Traditions Result in Body Being Exhumed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Religious beliefs among Hmong tribesmen
from the mountains of Laos have led to the exhumation of a teacher
to lift a curse, by removing from her casket photographs of her
Hmong pupils.
   Buying a beloved picture ``is an honor to a lot of people'' but
a ``disgrace and dishonor to the Hmong,'' said Angela Mann,
director of the local Headstart program.
   Many Hmong, refugees from Southeast Asia, have Animist religious
beliefs that involve spirits which control good and evil in the
world.
   ``If you are still alive but your picture or hair or some other
thing from the body is buried, it causes your spirit to leave your
body. You are more likely to get sick,'' said Ying Vang, executive
director of the Hmong social agency.
   The grave of Headstart teacher Charlotte Bell, 61, was opened
Tuesday at the urging of several Hmong parents.
   Bell had been hospitalized in December for pneumonia. She
received a get-well card made by a colleague that included photos
of her 36 students, more than 20 of them Hmong, Mann said.
   Bell died after a stroke Jan. 1, and her family tucked the card
in her casket before burial.
   Hmong parents learned the pictures had been buried and demanded
them back. Burying the pictures separated the children from their
spirits, exposing them to bad luck, illness and early death, they
said.
   ``The parents felt their children were cursed. They would have
bad luck for the rest of their lives. I didn't want that on my
head,'' Mann said.
   Sixteen children were kept home by their parents until they were
reunited with their spirits, Mann said.
   The $700 for the exhumation was raised from private sources,
Mann said. She said she tracked down Bell's son in Mexico for
permission to exhume the body.
   ``Her son readily agreed. Her sister and brother weren't too
happy about it, but they didn't do anything about it,'' Mann said.
   Two officials from Lao Family Community, a Hmong social agency,
were there when the pictures were removed and performed a
spirit-calling ceremony to lure the spirits out of the grave along
with the photos.
   The process of calling back the children's spirits requires two
more steps, one requiring the photos.
   But Mann said Headstart can't release the photos without written
permission from each parent and the children won't return to school
until the ceremonies are complete.
   A meeting with Lao Family Community will be held to resolve the
problem, she said.

   A nurse convicted of killing four
patients by injecting them with a paralyzing drug so he could
revive them and appear a hero was sentenced Wednesday to 50 years
to life in prison.
   ``You had no right to usurp God's function,'' Judge Alfred Tisch
told Richard Angelo in imposing the maximum sentence allowed by
state law.
   Tisch said Angelo, who was emotionless as sentencing was
pronounced, had violated ``in the cruelest, most inhumane manner''
the childlike trust a hospital patient places in a nurse.
   The patients, most of them sick and elderly, ``had a right to
enjoy, in their own way, every day that was available to them,'' he
said.
   Angelo, 27, of Lindenhurst, was convicted Dec. 15 of two counts
of murder, one of manslaughter and one of criminally negligent
homicide in the 1987 deaths at Good Samaritan Hospital.
   Angelo told authorities he injected the patients with Pavulon, a
paralyzing drug, so that when they stopped breathing and he was the
first on the scene, he could revive them and be a hero.
   Prosecutor John Collins said Angelo administered the fatal
injections out of inadequacy and because of his deep-rooted
contempt for authority.
   Collins asked the court to treat Angelo with the same compassion
that he showed his victims, and urged the maximum sentence.
   ``These were no folks who took an ill-advised stroll in Central
Park after dark,'' he said. ``These were sick, vulnerable people
who had entrusted their care to this defendant.''
   Angelo's attorney, Eric Naiburg, said he would file a notice of
appeal. He said he had expected the maximum sentence.
   Angelo was handcuffed and led to the county jail, where he has
been held since his arrest in November 1987, a month after the
killings.
   He also was convicted of assault in connection with the deaths
of four patients and the near-death of another. He was acquitted of
assaulting two patients.
   Collins said authorities suspect Angelo was responsible for the
deaths of several other patients, as he also used the drug
anectine, whose detection in skin tissue disappears 24 hours after
use.
   Outside the courthouse, family members of some of the victims
said they wished that Angelo could have received the death penalty.
   That was the opinion of Kieran Greene, whose 57-year-old father
Anthony died from a Pavulon injection. ``We have to put this behind
us and move forward, but we'll never forget,'' he said.

   Health care workers are paying little heed
voluntary guidelines for preventing the spread of AIDS and
Hepatitis B, a microbiologist told a House panel Thursday.
   Describing his eyewitness surveys of practices at laboratories
and hospitals, Joseph H. Coggin Jr. told a House Education and
Labor subcommittee that:
   _A phlebotomist in the Mobile, Ala., hospital where he works
took 10 or 12 blood samples without changing gloves, potentially
exposing patients though not herself, then walked out and went down
the elevator without removing the gloves.
   ``You go in a hospital and watch,'' he said. ``How many people
wearing gloves are pushing the elevator button or using the phone?''
   _A worker in a California laboratory who scooped up spilled
blood and broken glass in his bare hand after six test tubes broke.
The worker then discovered there was no biohazard disposal bag, so
he opened the door with his hand and walked out carrying the blood.
   None of the 10,000 to 12,000 tubes of blood samples had a top,
and a high-powered cooler blew across the tops of the tubes into
the faces of workers. One in 30 samples in this laboratory
contained the HIV virus, the cause of AIDS.
   ``This is a typical way that spills are managed in your blood
labs across the United States,'' including hospital labs, said
Coggin, a department chairman and associate dean at the University
of South Alabama College of Medicine in Mobile. ``Just walk in and
watch.''
   _Out of ignorance and fear, workers are not reporting the many
instances in which they are stuck by used needles or nicked by
instruments. Many employers are not offering to vaccinate workers
against Hepatitis B.
   The subcommittee on safety and health is reviewing proposed
regulations by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to
require basic safety precautions, equipment and training for the
nation's estimated 6 million health care workers, as well as
Hepatitis B vaccinations for anyone who could be exposed to the
virus that causes it.
   A set of voluntary ``universal precautions'' has been in effect
since 1987, but Coggin said those are not being applied.
   The problem of AIDS exposure was highlighted this week in a
Brooklyn, N.Y., courtroom, where Dr. Veronica Prego is suing the
Kings County Hospital for $175 million. She says she caught AIDS
after jabbing her finger in 1983 with a contaminated needle.
   Last week, the Centers for Disease Control acknowledged that the
number of health care workers infected with the HIV virus on the
job is higher than official figures.
   The CDC has reported 27 such cases worldwide, 19 in the United
States. The agency is investigating 34 other cases, said David
Bell, chief of AIDS activity in the hospital infections program at
the CDC.

<HEAD>Japan Puts Lunar Probe in Orbit, Young Space Program Gets Boost</HEAD>

   Japan's first lunar probe was put into
orbit around the Earth on Wednesday, ending a 14-year gap between
moon missions and giving new prestige to the country's young space
program.
   Space center officials said the Muses-A satellite, as planned,
separated from its Nissan-made rocket several minutes after liftoff
Wednesday night from an oceanside launch site in southern Japan.
   Mission chief Hiroki Matsuo said data from tracking stations in
California and Australia showed the satellite was orbiting the
Earth at a maximum distance of 186,000 miles.
   The satellite in its highly elliptical orbit is to close within
11,250 miles of the moon by March 18.
   At that time, shortly before it crosses the moon's path in a
so-called ``swing-by,'' it is to release a second, smaller
satellite, which will be propelled into lunar orbit about 10,000
miles from the moon.
   The smaller satellite will send data its mother satellite
detailing the lunar region's temperatures and electrical fields.
   The launch orginally was scheduled Tuesday, but the countdown
was stopped with 18 seconds remaining because of an electrical
problem in the hydraulic system.
   Only the United States and the Soviet Union have sent missions
to the moon, the most recent being the 1976 landing of an unmanned
Soviet vehicle.
   The mission is a symbolic step forward for Japan's growing space
program, which has relied more on diligent engineering than large
budgets.
   ``This time we are going to the moon. But our objective is not
the moon itself,'' Matsuo said. ``Our institute is getting into
interplanetary missions in the 1990s, and for that we need to
refine our technology.''
   As technicians prepared the M3S-2 rocket on the space center's
only launch pad, officials shivered in buildings around the center
where heaters were turned off to conserve electricity for the
launch equipment.
   Around the site, volunteers from neighboring villages stood
watch in the firefighters' traditional red-and-black uniforms.
   Both the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS),
which is conducting the moon mission, and Japan's other space
agency, the National Space Development Agency, have plans for
future manned space flights and interplanetary travel.
   NASDA, which focuses on applied uses of space, also is
developing a small space shuttle and a new all-Japanese rocket, the
H-2, that will handle a payload comparable to those carried by
U.S., Soviet and European rockets. ISAS focuses on scientific
research in space.
   The mission was sponsored by the government-funded Institute of
Space and Astronautical Science, will give Japan valuable
experience in targeting orbits and in the use of ``swing-bys'' to
guide future spacecraft traveling to distant planets.
   The Nissan rocket used in the launch carried a payload of only
400 pounds. The H-1 rocket is expected to handle two tons.
   Japan's first satellite was launched in 1970. Muses-A is the
13th Japanese satellite in operation.
   In recent years, Japan has achieved a respected aerospace launch
record, despite its late entry into the field, low budgets _ $1.06
billion last year _ and a shortage of good launch sites.
   Japan's two main launch areas _ in Uchinoura and in nearby
Tanagashima _ are only a tiny fraction of the size of space centers
in other nations.

<HEAD>Biden Says War on Drugs Should Focus on Hard-Core Addicts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman on
Wednesday accused the Bush administration of waging its drug war on
the wrong front, focusing on the shrinking number of casual users
instead of hard-core addicts.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., told a news briefing that
placing emphasis on casual uses represented ``a misapplication of
those resources and those dollars.''
   Biden unveiled a rival strategy for fighting the war on drugs.
   ``As for the casual user, we probably three years ago reached
the apex'' in terms of numbers, Biden said in making public a
strategy that would cost an estimated $14.6 billion in the fiscal
year that starts Oct. 1, well above the Bush administration's
expected recommendation.
   The plan also envisions providing drug treatment for all
pregnant addicts within one year and ``full treatment on demand''
within four years.
   Biden, tapped to provide the Democratic response when President
Bush addressed the nation on drugs last fall, said this report did
not represent the views of either the Judiciary Committee or any
Democratic Party group.
   He released his blueprint as the national drug policy director,
William Bennett, prepared to present the second installment of the
administration's plan for contending with the drug scourge.
   Biden acknowledged that the administration already is doing many
of the things recommended in his rival strategy but said its
emphasis has been different and the focus has been too much on
casual drug abusers. ``That's allowing them to do nothing about the
hard-core user,'' he said.
   ``The moral approbation of mainstream America has more impact on
the casual user than anything we do,'' he said. He said the chief
focus should be hard-core addicts because they have caused the
``increase in crime, drug-related medical emergencies, crack babies
and drug-related child abuse.''
   ``Under our plan, the hard core user must either go into
treatment or go to jail and when they go to jail go into treatment
in jail,'' Biden said.
   Biden also said the administration's so-called Andean plan
focuses primarily on military aid while his approach envisions
offering producer nations in South America relief of their
international debt in return for planting substitute crops in place
of coca.
   Biden's outline calls for doubling to 1,000 the number of FBI
agents investigating drug rings as well as increasing the number of
drug enforcement agents and prosecutors working on narcotics cases.
   It estimates expenditures on its expanded treatment provisions
at more than $3.8 billion in the next fiscal year.
   Under Biden's plan, the government also would build 10 regional
prisons and 12 boot camps on closed military bases to incarcerate
federal, state and local offenders at a price tag of $850 million.
A number of assault-style semiautomatic weapons would be banned
under the measure but most would remain legal.
   And the plan would make $300 million available for ``drug
emergency areas'' in contrast to the administration plan which
calls for $40 million.
   ``In all honesty, $300 million is not going to make a
fundamental change,'' Biden acknowledged.

   Hundreds of Kashmir policemen went on
strike for five hours Wednesday to support Moslem separatists's
demands that army troops called in to quell violence leave
Jammu-Kashmir state.
   Gov. Jagmohan, who uses only one name, appealed to the
separatists to lay down their arms on the fourth day of a crackdown
on the violent pro-Pakistani secessionist movement in Kashmir.
   At least 57 people, most of them protesters, have been killed
since an around-the-clock curfew was imposed Saturday on Srinagar
and surrounding towns.
   One Moslem militant was killed Wednesday when paramilitary
forces, fearing an attack, fired on a mob, a senior police official
said on condition of anonymity.
   Jagmohan, who has a reputation as a tough administrator, was
appointed governor of Jammu-Kashmir state by Prime Minister V.P.
Singh two weeks ago in an effort to curb the rebellion, the most
serious crisis Singh has faced since he took office Dec. 2.
   The Islamic militants, led by the Jammu Kashmir Liberation
Front, demand either independence for the state or union with
neighboring Islamic Pakistan.
   About 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 5 million people are
Moslems. Nationwide, Moslems account for 12 percent of India's 880
million people and Hindus make up 82 percent.
   Singh, a Hindu like Jagmohan, has sent hundreds of troops from
the nation's predominantly Hindu army and paramilitary forces to
Kashmir.
   Ethnic tensions flared Sunday when a Moslem policeman was shot
to death by soldiers enforcing the curfew. Government officials
said the killing was an accident.
   On Wednesday morning, hundreds of state policemen refused to
work. About 300 striking officers gathered on a downtown street,
waving rifles and shouting, ``Death to the Indian army!'' and
``Indians go back!''
   The strike was called off in the afternoon after Jitendra Narain
Saxena, the state's top police officer, and Mohammad A. Nomani,
Srinagar's police inspector general, spoke to the protesting
policemen.
   Saxena later said: ``It appears that over the years, some
terrorist elements have infiltrated the state police force.''
   There are 40,000 men in the police force.
   Moslem residents of Srinager were jubilant over the strike and
many embraced officers when the curfew was lifted for an hour in
the morning.
   ``Policemen were resentful of certain things. The incident took
place due to lack of leadership and mismanagement,'' Jagmohan said
without elaborating.
   ``The issue has been sorted out. I do not think there is any
serious problem,'' he said.
   But one of the strike leaders, constable Mohammad Afzal, said
another walkout was planned for Saturday unless the soldiers leave
Kashmir and the government reinstates a police union banned in 1979.
   During the news conference, Jagmohan rejected suggestions by
some reporters that most Kashmiris wanted to secede and join
Pakistan.
   ``I have come here to help, to sort out the problems. Give me
some time. There is no magic in human affairs,'' he said.
   India has often accused Pakistan of aiding separatists. Pakistan
denies the charge.
   Claimed by both India and Pakistan, Kashmir was divided into
Indian and Pakistani sectors by a cease-fire line that is monitored
by United Nations military observers.
   The dispute over the territory, which has led to two wars, began
after India and Pakistan were partitioned upon gaining independence
from Britain in 1947.

<HEAD>Congressmen Say USDA Lied in 1986 Report on WIC Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department, under President
Reagan, lied about the benefits of a popular nutrition program for
poor pregnant women and children, several members of Congress said
Wednesday.
   ``This report makes it plain that the Reagan administration
sought to hide the facts'' in an earlier Agriculture Department
study of the program, said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.
   But an official of the General Accounting Office, a
congressional investigative agency, said it was not clear that the
Agriculture Department had intended to be deceptive in the report
on the Women, Infants and Children food program.
   Keith Fultz of the GAO said investigators could not pin down the
intent behind the changes made in a report on the benefits of the
program that started in 1972, but said the effect was to mislead
readers.
   He said the summary written by the original researchers was
deleted by Agriculture Department officials and replaced by a
compendium that ``did not fairly represent what the study team
found.''
   That, said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., amounts to lying.
   ``GAO said that the results written by USDA to replace the
research team's summary would `understate the effects of the WIC
program and mislead the readers...,`'' said Leahy. ``In Vermont, we
call that lying, plain and simple.''
   The Agriculture Department study began in 1979 but was not
released until 1986, a length of time that angered Congress.
   ``The project was to take 2{ years and cost $3.9 million,'' said
Harkin. ``Instead it was a 6-year program costing close to $6
million.''
   The comments about the study came at a joint hearing of the
House Select Hunger Committee and the Senate Agriculture Committee,
which had requested the GAO investigation.
   Budget figures for the last 10 years show that Congress
appropriated $725 million for WIC in 1980 and increased the amount
by at least $100 million each year.
   That was not always enough to keep up with inflation and has
never been enough to reach all the eligible women and children,
said a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee staff, but was
consistently higher than the Reagan administration had requested.
   In 1982, Reagan proposed cutting the program from the $869
million of the previous year to $637 million. Congress appropriated
$948 million.
   Reagan tried in 1983 to cut the program to about $637 million.
That time Congress appropriated $1.1 billion.
   The 1990 appropriation is $2.13 billion, serving about 4.6
million women and children, said Birge Watkins, deputy assistant
agriculture secretary for food and consumer services.
   He said that about two-thirds of the eligible recipients are
getting help through the program.
   Watkins said the Bush administration supports WIC, believes the
previous administration was wrong to change the report and would
never let such a thing happen again.
   ``It's simply no way to do business,'' he said. ``We regret this
whole incident happened.''
   He said that if the administration had differences with the
findings of the independent researchers they should have been
expressed in a cover letter, leaving the original summary intact.
   The revisions were written by Thomas Sullivan, a special
assistant to John Bode, who was assistant secretary for food and
consumer services for the last four years of the Reagan
administration.
   Bode, now an attorney in a Washington law firm, said that he now
believes the compendium was wrong, but at the time thought Sullivan
and others at the department who reviewed the study knew what they
were doing.
   But ``to assert there was willful misrepresentation to Congress
is wrong,'' he said in a telephone interview.

<TEXT>
   Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III on
Wednesday defended a new $1.2 billion guided-missile destroyer
against charges of cost overruns, schedule delays and mischarges by
the contractor.
   ``The DDG-51 program is on track to provide our fleet the most
capable destroyer ever built,'' Garrett told a House Armed Services
subcommittee on seapower and strategic ans critical materials.
   The subcommittee largely agreed with Garrett's assessment, but
criticized the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, and questioned the propriety of another House panel, the
Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations,
getting involved in an area normally the Armed Services domain.
   It was the chairman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee,
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., who wrote the Navy in September and
complained publicly that the destroyer program is 17 months behind
schedule and design costs have more than doubled, from $111 million
to $247 million.
   Rep. Norman Sisisky, D-Va., questioned the source of reports
that the Navy and the GAO had received fraud-hotline allegations of
mischarging by the destroyer's manufacturer, Bath Iron Works of
Maine.
   ``We do not publicly announce we have allegations,'' said Martin
M. Ferber, director of the GAO's National Security and
International Affairs Division. ``Congressman Dingell went public
with the allegations.''
   Dingell had been asked to testify before the Armed Services
panel, but said he was unable to do so because of a scheduling
conflict.
   In a four-page letter to committee Chairman Charles E. Bennett,
D-Fla., Dingell reiterated his concerns about the program.
   ``The interim findings of the (Pentagon's) Defense Contract
Audit Agency and the Navy indicate that mischarging did, in fact,
occur,'' Dingell wrote.
   Ferber said the GAO and Navy are investigating those charges,
but that he had no information to substantiate allegations of
intentional mischarge.
   In April 1985, the Navy awarded Bath Iron Works a fixed-price
contract for the destroyer, hailed as the world's most advanced
surface combat ship.
   The DDG-51 destroyer is designed with a more expensive all-steel
superstructure instead of one that was part aluminum and more prone
to splintering and fire damage. The ship also is equipped with
sophisticated Aegis computers and Tomahawk cruise missiles.
   The Navy plans to acquire at least 33 of the Arleigh Burke-class
destroyer at a cost of $27 billion.
   Ferber said the total target cost for design and construction of
the lead ship was about $500 million in May 1984 dollars. The
Pentagon estimates that the total cost after integrating all the
systems, including the Aegis computers, will be under $1.2 billion.
   Ferber testified that the GAO investigation found that design
problems contributed to two revision's in the ship's scheduled
delivery date of September 1989. Bath Iron Works has accelerated
construction to meet the new date of February 1991.
   William E. Haggett, chairman and chief executive officer of Bath
Iron Works, said his company did not expect ``any significant
surprises completing DDG-51.''

   The sun won't come out tomorrow for ``Annie.''
   On Saturday, the new $7 million musical ``Annie 2'' closed in
Washington, its producers deciding not to open it on Broadway on
March 1 as planned.
   But, the announcement continued in an upbeat vein, a revival of
``Annie,'' the 1977 musical hit, would open on Broadway instead.
And the sequel, ``Annie 2,'' would go to the Goodspeed Opera House
in East Haddam, Conn., during the summer for performances and
revisions.
   On Wednesday, David Powers, spokesman for ``Annie 2,'' said that
the proposed revival of ``Annie'' has been scrapped.
   Danielle Findley, 11, who had the title role in ``Annie 2,'' was
to have starred in the revival of ``Annie'' and Harve Presnell was
to have shifted his Daddy Warbucks portrayal from ``Annie 2'' to
``Annie.'' Dorothy Loudon, who snarled her comic way to a Tony
Award as Miss Hannigan in ``Annie,'' and who portrayed Miss
Hannigan again in ``Annie 2,'' said that she was not interested in
playing in the revival.
   Martin Charnin and Charles Strouse wrote the score for both
shows and Thomas Meehan wrote both books.
   Powers said that ``Annie 2'' will still go to the Goodspeed
Opera House during the summer.

   After a doctor said her cornea transplant
appeared successful, Tatina roared her approval. Or was it maybe
disapproval?
   ``I think she can see me just fine and she's not real happy to
see me,'' Dr. Dan Skorich joked at a news conference Tuesday near
the Siberian tiger's cage at the Lake Superior Zoo.
   Skorich and Drs. Susan and Jeffrey Abelt of Cloquet Animal
Hospital last month transplanted a cornea from Tatina's mother
after she died into the 10-year-old tigress' left eye to replace a
cornea clouded by a cataract.
   Skorich removed the stitches from Tatina's eye Friday and he
said the surgery appears successful. ``I'm happy about the fact
that the cornea is healed,'' he said.
   The clear cornea should make Tatina more comfortable and improve
her vision. But Skorich said it's impossible to test the tigress'
vision.
   ``I guess we could hold up little mice and see how many she can
count,'' he said.

   Some legislators are up in arms and talking
revolution because an $11.5 million Capitol renovation project has
forced them out of their regular offices and into temporary
cramped, cold quarters.
   ``My new office is about 40 degrees,'' complained state Rep.
Joseph Wineke, one of 26 Assembly members who now have temporary
offices at a building across the street from the Capitol.
   ``I feel like I'm in Alcatraz. I'm out of the (Capitol)
building, I don't know where to hang my coat _ it's like being a
person without a country. When you're out of the building, you're
out of the network,'' Wineke said.
   When the Legislature convened its nine-week session Tuesday, a
group of displaced lawmakers drafted a list of demands and huddled
around Assembly Speaker Thomas Loftus, chanting ``Revolution'' and
``Storm the Bastille.''
   ``I'll look into this,'' Loftus promised.
   The move was necessary because of a renovation of the Capitol's
north wing, which will be remodeled and air conditioned. The
project is expected to take about two years.
   Fifteen lawmakers were relocated to temporary offices in other
parts of the Capitol while the 26 others and several state
officials were moved across the street into leased office space.
   The lawmakers complain some of their new offices are noisy,
poorly heated, small and unusually shaped, and lack security,
janitorial services, parking and access for the handicapped.
   ``It's very bad, very cramped'' said state Rep. Spencer Black.
   Black moved into his new office Friday. Several staff members
already were there, looking out the window at construction in
progress on a building next door.
   ``They were agape,'' Black said. ``I looked out and saw why.
There was this huge wrecking crane swinging back and forth, and it
looked like it was coming right through the window.''

<HEAD>Cancer Claims Life of Man Dubbed `Baby Bandit'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Grady Lee Huffman, the bad-luck ``Baby
Bandit'' of the 1930s who was shot 17 times in three decades of
crime, died of cancer. He was 72.
   Huffman, who died at home Tuesday in this town about 40 miles
southwest of Fort Worth, claimed he once met the legendary Bonnie
Parker and Clyde Barrow while hitchhiking, said his son, Grady Lee
Huffman Jr.
   ``He told them he wanted to join them, but Bonnie called him a
snotty-nosed punk kid,'' said the younger Huffman. ``He said,
`Well, I'll go make a name on my own.'
   ``He was born with a harelip,'' his son said. ``He was a freak
and kids teased him. So he told them, `I'm going to rob all your
mommies and daddies, just like Jesse James.'''
   Huffman was paroled in 1967 and had led a quiet life since then,
said the younger Huffman, who didn't meet his father until 1968.
   When he was 16 years old, the elder Huffman stole a car in Waco,
but collided with a car driven by the sheriff.
   Huffman picked up the ``Baby Bandit'' nickname at age 18 in 1934
after leading Fort Worth police on a wild, bullet-punctuated chase.
He was captured after being shot in the face, and was sentenced to
25 years in prison.
   Huffman began his next career: escape.
   He tried to break out of prison in 1935, escaped for four days
in 1942, broke out the next year and spent four months on the lam,
and tried to escape again the same year. In 1944, he busted out and
stayed free for 20 months.
   Huffman married Judy, the first of his two wives, during that
last escape, his son said.
   ``That was when I was born,'' he said. ``In Dublin on Oct. 16,
1944. The night I was born, you'll find there was a jewelry store
robbed there.''
   In spite of his record, Huffman was one of 10 convicts pardoned
in 1947 by outgoing Gov. Coke R. Stevenson.
   Two years later, Huffman was in trouble again.
   ``Of all times he picked to rob a Coca-Cola plant, he picked the
night they were having a policeman's convention in Vernon,'' the
son said. ``They all came shooting at him, but they were so drunk
they didn't kill him.''
   Huffman drew 399 years in prison.
   The younger Huffman said he once told his father of his plans to
follow in his footsteps, and got some fatherly advice: ``Son, if I
couldn't beat them before they had radios and computers, you don't
stand a chance.''
   ``He was a fascinating old man,'' said his son. ``A hellacious
old man.''
   Huffman's widow, Irene, said her husband became a Christian in
his final months.
   ``I was just an Arkansas hillbilly when I met him,'' she said.
``I thought I saw a man who wanted to go straight, and he told me
what he'd done.
   ``But I never in my wildest dreams _ well, I thought things like
that happened only in the movies. I thought it was just a tall
Texas tale.''
   In addition to his widow and son, Huffman is survived by another
son and a sister. Funeral services were scheduled Friday in
Cleburne.

   Tehran University students held a
memorial service in the campus mosque Wednesday for Moslems killed
by Soviet soldiers in Azerbaijan, the official Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
   It said the mourners read a statement that criticized Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, the Soviet president, for ordering the army into Baku on
Saturday.
   Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, the radical former interior minister, told
the mourners Gorbachev's actions were a trap set by the United
States and the Soviet leadership should ``rid itself of American
traps,'' the agency said.
   Similar ceremonies were held in Tabriz, Ardebil, Astara and
other provincial cities, IRNA reported.
   Nasser Hayrani Nowbari, the Iranian ambassador to Moscow,
delivered a letter Wednesday to the Soviet Foreign Ministry from
Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati.
   Velayati said Iran was concerned about the well-being of Moslems
throughout the world, but committed to the principle of
non-interference in the affairs of other states.
   Earlier Wednesday, IRNA said hundreds of Soviet Azerbaijanis
gathered along the Iranian frontier and some started building a new
border bridge across the Araks River, but Soviet troops stopped
them.
   After ``a gathering by the people and their ultimatum to the
Soviet forces,'' the work resumed, the agency reported.
   It said female television announcers in Iran's Azerbaijani
enclave of Nakhichevan wore black head scarves in mourning for
``victims of the Baku carnage.''
   Red Army troops moved into Caspian Sea port of Baku over the
weekend to crush a nationalist uprising and end ethnic clashes
between Azerbaijanis and ethnic Armenians, most of whom are
Christians.
   Most Azerbaijanis, whose historic homeland extends into Iran,
are Shiite Moslems, the predominant religion in Iran.
   Thousands ofSoviet Azerbaijanis, bound by language, culture and
religion to their Iranian kin, have crossed the border since the
violence began.
   The Iranian news agency said about 300 people gathered Tuesday
on the Soviet side of the border about 12 miles west of the
frontier town of Poldasht. Twenty-eight Soviet armored personnel
carriers patrolled a military road that runs along the border, it
said.
   Moscow Radio, clearly telling the Iranians not to interfere,
declared on Tuesday: ``Any unconsidered nationalistic or religious
appeals would be dangerous. ... Brutal and illusory nationalistic
flights of fancy have dragged the people to the brink of the
precipice.''

<HEAD>Bush Wants Democrats, GOP to Back Nicaraguan Candidate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Wednesday called upon the
Democratic and Republican parties to give money to the campaign of
Violeta Chamorro, the candidate challenging President Daniel Ortega
in Nicaragua's Feb. 25 elections.
   Bush's letter of request, released at the White House, caught
both the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National
Committee by surprise.
   The Democrats will not likely accommodate the president, said
DNC spokesman Mike McCurry.
   ``I don't know why the president seems to think we're awash in
money here,'' said McCurry. ``We don't have as much money as the
Republicans and the money we do have we want to apply to electing
Democrats here in the United States.''
   The RNC ``has been extremely supportive of Mrs. Chamorro,'' and
helped sponsor a fund-raising event for her recently in Washington,
said RNC spokeswoman Leslie Goodman. But she could not immediately
say how the GOP would respond to the president's appeal.
   ``We have been supportive in the past. We'll be supportive in
the future,'' she added.
   The Bush administration has consistently criticized Nicaragua's
election process, claiming the deck is stacked in favor of Ortega
and the ruling Sandinistas, who control the media and have other
advantages.
   Bush said in his letter that that Mrs. Chamorro and her party,
the National Opposition Union, or UNO, are ``desperately short of
funds needed for campaign rallies, distributing campaign literature
and media time'' as the Feb. 25 election nears.
   Congress already has approved Bush's request for $9 million to
help the electoral process in Nicaragua. That money, being
channelled through the government-supported National Endowment for
Democracy, cannot under NED's charter be spent directly on the
campaign of a candidate. Rather it is to go to generic political
activity, such as voter registration, and building of democratic
institutions.
   ``The Sandinistas,'' Bush wrote, ``have imposed serious
obstacles to delivery of the NED funds, and, to date UNO has been
permitted to make use of only a tiny fraction of them. For these
reasons, Mrs. Chamorro's campaign runs the real risk of being
crippled for lack of money.''
   Bush asked the two parties to make a joint contribution, amount
unspecified, and to tap their individual donors for money as well.
   ``A joint contribution by both parties to the UNO campaign would
make an immediate difference at this critical moment, as would
individual contributions by your party's members,'' he wrote.
   But McCurry said ``It seems fairly curious that the president of
the United States thinks that U.S. political parties should go
donating to political candidates abroad.'' DNC Chairman Ron Brown
was traveling in Egypt and did not know of the request, he said.

Wednesday.
   The government of Egypt intends to equip four Chinese-built

   The prime contractor will be the McDonnell Douglas Missile

<NOTE>EDs: New throughout with Secord criticism of Reagan, Meese, other
details; no pickup</NOTE>

   Iran-Contra arms middleman Richard Secord was
placed on probation for two years Wednesday for falsely telling
congressional investigators he was unaware any money in the affair
had benefited Oliver L. North.
   After his sentencing, the retired Air Force major general
accused former President Reagan of failing to support loyal
subordinates and operatives in the worst foreign policy debacle of
the Reagan administration.
   ``I think former President Reagan has been hiding out; I think
it's cowardly,'' Secord said when asked about Reagan's role in the
affair.
   In 1986, when the Iran-Contra operation erupted, ``I think that
he should have stood up and taken the heat ... just as previous
presidents have done (in failed covert operations),'' Secord told a
news conference. ``But instead of that they built a wall around ...
him.''
   Secord said then-Attorney General Edwin Meese acted ``in panic
and out of ignorance'' on Nov. 25, 1986, when he announced that the
Justice Department would examine possible violations of criminal
law in the affair. That was the day Meese disclosed that some funds
from the secret Iran arms sales had been diverted to the Contras.
Reagan maintains he didn't know about the diversion, and Secord
said it would be ``speculative'' on his part to suggest otherwise.
   But ``the president did not stand up and say this (the Contra
resupply operation and Iran arms sales) was ```done on my
authority,''' said Secord.
   Secord said he didn't think there was ``anything illegal ... I
thought at the time we were doing the president's bidding.''
   The president told the Tower Commission on Jan. 26, 1987, that
he did not know the National Security Council staff was engaged in
helping the Contras. ``The Board is aware of no evidence to suggest
that the president was aware of Lt. Col. North's activities,'' said
the Tower Board's final report.
   Secord was enlisted by then-White House aide North to airlift
weapons and other supplies to the Nicaraguan rebels and assist the
Reagan administration's secret arms shipments to Iran.
   Secord, who paid for North's $13,800 home security system from
proceeds of the Iran-Contra operation, told congressional
investigators in 1987 he was unaware of any money going to North
from the scandal.
   ``I deeply regret not being more candid,'' Secord told U.S.
District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson. ``If I could correct this I
certainly would. I will regret it for the rest of my life.''
   Secord could have faced up to five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine for the false statement, but Robinson said it was his
judgment that there has already ``been punishment in this case.''
   Secord is the fifth person to be sentenced in the Iran-Contra
affair. The others were North, former National Security Adviser
Robert McFarlane, Carl Channell and Richard Miller.
   North was convicted of three crimes, including aiding and
abetting an obstruction of Congress, altering and destroying
National Security Council documents and accepting an illegal
gratuity from Secord, the security system. He is appealing.
   McFarlane pleaded guilty to four counts of withholding
information from Congress in connection with inquiries about
whether secret assistance was going to the Contras. Channell and
Miller were both sentenced to two years probation. Each pleaded
guilty to conspiracy to defraud the government of taxes due on
contributions used to supply military aid to the Contras.
   Secord said his life since the Iran-Contra affair began has been
``pure hell.''
   He said that he was paid about $240,000 in the Iran and Contra
operations and that $700,000 to $800,000 has been raised for his
defense since 1987, an amount he said doesn't cover all his legal
expenses.
   He said he has his military retirement pay, but no job and that
he had to sell his home and buy a smaller one.
   Secord said he hopes to start a television talk show which would
deal with current events. One of his topics, he said, is the theory
that Soviet intelligence actually exposed the administration's Iran
initiative by planting the November 1986 story in a Lebanese
magazine that the United States had sold arms to Iran.
   The government had alleged that ``the enterprise,'' the maze of
offshore companies and secret bank accounts used in the Iran-Contra
affair, managed over $1 million in profits that had been allocated
to Secord. Some $8 million in ``enterprise'' funds is still frozen
in Swiss bank accounts at the request of the U.S. government.
   Secord told reporters he might be entitled to some legal fees
from the frozen accounts, but ``I make no personal claim on that
money. ... I don't intend ... to put any of that money in my
pocket.''
   In approving a plea agreement between Secord and the government,
Robinson dismissed 11 other criminal charges. They include
allegations that Secord lied to Congress by saying that the only
money he made in the affair was his $6,000-a-month salary.
   In court papers filed this week, prosecutors said Secord now is
refusing to recant the earlier testimony about his finances.
   Iran-Contra prosecutor Reid Weingarten told Judge Robinson that
Secord should be dealt with more sternly than North and McFarlane.
   Weingarten said North and McFarlane felt they were committing
their crimes in the context of having ``had a higher duty.''
   North and McFarlane were cases of ``misguided patriotism,'' said
Weingarten, while ``we think General Secord has no such defense.''
   ``The best that can be said'' of Secord's false statement is
that he was motivated by the ``embarrassment'' of having paid for
North's home security system, said the prosecutor.
   The worst that can be said is that he was trying to avoid ``the
consequences of providing benefits to Colonel North,'' added
Weingarten. ``This is the stuff of routine felonies.''

   The Consumer Product Safety Commission is
ready to begin finalizing decisions that have been stymied since
last year because the panel did not have a voting quorum, the head
of the agency said Wednesday.
   ``Now that we do have a quorum, we are back in business and
we're active,'' said Chairwoman Jacqueline Jones-Smith,
acknowledging that much business had reached a bottleneck before
she was appointed in November.
   The CPSC, mandated in 1973 as a five-member panel, must have at
least three members before it can take official actions requiring a
commission vote. Consumer groups criticized President Bush for
allowing the agency to languish most of last year with just two
commissioners.
   However, consumer advocates criticized the Jones-Smith
appointment, saying she lacked experience on product safety issues
and consumer affairs. Critics also called the appointment political
patronage because her husband, Republican businessman Joshua Smith,
helped raise more than $600,000 for the Bush presidential campaign.
   ``I think I have almost the perfect qualities that are necessary
for this kind of job,'' Jones-Smith said.
   She was a staff attorney for the Federal Election Commission for
three years before going to the CPSC. She also was an assistant
attorney for Montgomery County, Md., for two years and for six
years held various management positions in the Maryland-based
Maxima Corp., an integrated information systems company owned by
her husband.
   Among the items on the commission calendar are:
   _Recommendations for a new test cylinder to determine the
smallest allowable size for toys and their parts. Currently, if a
toy fits into a cylinder with a 1\-inch diameter and a depth
ranging from 1 inch to 2\ inches, it is too small and considered a
potential choking hazard to small children.
   _Whether mandatory labels are needed for balloons, marbles and
small balls that are exempt from the small parts standards because
they are marketed for children older than 3.
   _A vote on mandatory labeling for adult sleepwear. The
commission Monday postponed a vote on staff recommendations to
classify the garments by degree of flammability.
   _Performance standards for child-resistant cigarette lighters,
pool barriers and immersion protection in hair dryers.

<HEAD>Governor Rejects Clemency for Tyler In Racial Shooting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gov. Buddy Roemer on Wednesday rejected
a recommendation of clemency for Gary Tyler, a black activist who
claims he was framed for the murder of a white student during
desegregation violence in 1974.
   Tyler's long fight for freedom has been supported by Amnesty
International and other groups.
   Tyler, 31, is serving a life sentence with no possibility of
parole. On Dec. 14, the Pardon Board voted 3-2 to reduce his
sentence to 60 years, making him eligible for parole in five years.
   ``I do not concur with the recommendation of the pardon board,
and I deny clemency and a reduction of sentence,'' Roemer said in a
brief statement Wednesday.
   Roemer refused to talk to reporters about his decision, which
was read by his attorney, Tom Casey.
   ``Gary Tyler was found guilty after a full jury trial,'' said
Casey. ``His conviction has been reviewed extensively by the courts
over the past 15 years. Those reviewing courts have found Gary
Tyler's trial to be fundamentally fair by all legal standards.
   ``Also, I believe his efforts toward rehabilitation have not
been sufficient.''
   Tyler's case has been supported by marches and rallies.
Petitions bearing 12,000 signatures were presented to the pardon
board.
   The British reggae band UB40 recorded a song about Tyler, and he
was described by the Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda in
1978 as a political prisoner.
   Tyler was a 15-year-old activist for school desegregation in
1974 when whites and blacks clashed at a high school in Destrehan,
a small town on the Mississippi River 25 miles north of New Orleans.
   Whites surrounded buses carrying black students, shouting and
hurling bottles, cans and rocks. A shot was fired from one of the
buses. Timothy Weber, 13, standing with his mother across the
schoolyard, fell dead.
   Witnesses said the pistol was held by a gloved hand. Tyler was
the only one on the bus wearing gloves, said police.
   Those who believe Tyler was framed say that a student who
testified against him was known as a liar and that police planted a
pistol found in the stuffing of the torn seat where Tyler had sat.
   The pistol later disappeared and defense attorneys claimed the
laboratory people who tested for fingerprints were incompetent.
   An all-white jury sentenced Tyler to die in the electric chair,
but his sentence was automatically reduced to life when the Supreme
Court struck down Louisiana's old death penalty law in 1976.

<TEXT>
   A high school has banned students from
using book bags in an effort to prevent drugs from being brought to
school.
   Baldwin High School Principal Mike Stanton announced the ban
last week after Sheriff Bill Massee told faculty members that many
schools with drug problems have banned book bags. The ban took
effect Monday.
   ``The parents have not been informed at any point that we have a
drug and alcohol problem in the school,'' Elois Finney, a parent of
a Baldwin High student, told the school board Tuesday.
   She said parents should have been consulted. ``If we have a
problem of that magnitude the schools should come up with a program
to solve it.''
   The school of 1,400 students serves the county of 35,000 people.
Milledgeville has about 12,000 people.
   Stanton said the school does not have a serious drug problem,
``but it's all relative. Even if there's only one student involved
in drugs here, that's one too many.''
   Stanton said the sheriff was invited to speak after teachers
expressed concern about increasing drug use among students.
   The principal said the students are now getting to class
quicker, partly because they must go to their lockers to get their
books, giving them less time to congregate in the halls.
   Teacher Todd Shiver said students had become too dependent on
their bags, using them not only for books but gym clothes and junk
food. He said some book bags were so large and full students had to
drag them down the halls.
   Some students complained about the difficulties of carrying
their books without a bag; others said banning bags will have
little effect on the drug problem.
   ``I've seen students with drugs in their socks,'' said Sharilyn
Richardson, 15.
   ``If they want to get drugs in here, they'll find a way to do
it,'' said James Jackson, 16.

<TEXT>
   Yes, we know our tamales, members of
the U.S. military said Tuesday, and the powdery substance found in
Manuel Antonio Noriega's home was definitely not tamales.
   But it wasn't cocaine either.
   U.S. Army officers had first said that nearly 50 kilograms, or
110 pounds, of cocaine had been found in Noriega's home the day
after the Dec. 20 invasion, bolstering U.S. charges of drug
trafficking against the Panamanian strongman.
   But published reports this week said the Army acknowledged later
that the substance found in the house was tamales, not cocaine.
   Southern Command spokesmen reacted angrily Tuesday, saying the
Army never claimed it had found tamales.
   Many of the U.S. servicemen here hail from the Southwest and
should be able to recognize a tamale when they see one.
   Tamales _ cornmeal and meat, either pork, beef or chicken _ come
in many different forms. They vary from the thick, cornhusk-wrapped
tamale of northern Mexico and southwestern United States to a
rectangular tamale wrapped in a banana leaf popular along the
Mexican Gulf coast, Central America and Panama.
   The Panamanian variety is most popular around Christmas and is
made with cornmeal and chicken meat in the capital and with pork in
the provinces.
   ``We said that our soldiers found some white powder wrapped in
banana leaves in a refrigerator,'' said Capt. Art Haubold of the
Southern Command's public affairs office. ``The substance was taken
to a lab and it was determined after that is was not cocaine.
   ``The best they could determine was that it was some bonding
substance used in voodoo rituals. That's the way it was described
to us by Army experts. At first, it could have been mistaken by a
layman as cocaine.''
   Army officials also said Tuesday they never indicated any direct
connection existed between the former dictator and drugs found by
soldiers as they searched Noriega's homes and hundreds of other
houses and offices in Panama.
   ``It was not our job to determine that,'' Haubold said.
   According to the Army, 415 kilograms of cocaine, 100 grams of
crack cocaine, 10 kilograms of marijuana and 25.5 kilograms of
heroin were found and confiscated by the U.S. Army from Dec. 20
through Jan. 9 in search operations throughout Panama. The total
included small amounts found on suspects picked up for questioning
and in private homes.
   A kilogram equals 2.2 pounds and a gram 0.035 ounces.
   A total of 283 kilograms of cocaine were found in the offices of
the National Investigation Office, but a source said it could not
be determined whether it had been previously confiscated by the law
enforcement agency.

<TEXT>
   A sailor accused of murdering two shipmates at
a top-secret nuclear submarine base and then killing himself was
given a full military funeral Wednesday.
   Relatives said they suspect a Navy coverup.
   Three uniformed sailors removed a U.S. flag from Shyam David
Drizpaul's casket and presented it to his mother at a service at a
funeral home.
   After the ceremony, the sailor's mother, Seelochna Drizpaul,
wept over the casket, crying: ``Oh God, this is not real. This is
not real. You are not dead my son.''
   The Navy has reported Drizpaul, 23, a fire control technician
3rd class aboard the USS Michigan, a top-secret Trident nuclear
submarine in Bangor, Wash., shot and killed two shipmates and a
pawn shop clerk in nearby Bremerton, Wash., before apparently
killing himself last week in a motel room.
   But relatives claim Drizpaul, a native of Guyana, was an
intelligent, responsible person who did not fit the description of
a killer.
   The family was orginally told they would have to make
arrangements to claim the body and that Drizpaul would not be given
a military funeral, said an uncle, Yoganand Kumar.
   But calls to U.S. Rep. Les Aspin and Sen. Herbert Kohl, both
D-Wis., helped persuade the Navy to provide the honor guard, Kumar
said.
   ``They find the man dead and they say they're not responsible
for him. We weren't satisfied,'' he said.
   Kumar said before the funeral that the family doubts the Navy's
explanation and is upset because details about the deaths have not
been released.
   ``Nothing makes sense. There are a lot of questions that haven't
been answered,'' he said ``What's going on? What are they trying to
cover up? We're not saying he didn't do it. We're saying, `Tell us
what happened.'''
   Petty Officer Paul Gamache of Osseo, Wis., who escorted
Drizpaul's body from Washington to Milwaukee, told mourners
Drizpaul's co-workers aboard the submarine were surprised by the
allegations.
   Gamache, who knew Drizpaul for 18 months, said the Navy's
allegations about Drizpaul did not ``really seem like the guy we
knew.''
   ``He always performed every job ever asked of him in a very
professional manner. He took pride in his work,'' Gamache said.
   Another uncle, Vasant Kumar, told mourners Drizpaul was a
dedicated son who came to the United States at age 6 and joined the
Navy after high school.
   ``He was the only son to his mother and the violent
circumstances of his passing compounds the family's grief. It is a
curious thing, but we know nothing about his work except he worked
in a submarine. We feel he gave his life for his country,'' Kumar
said.
   The family's attorney, Larry Scruggs Jr., said he planned to
conduct his own investigation.
   But police Capt. Dennis Plumb, who is heading the civilian
investigation in Bremerton, said police had talked to a witness to
the shooting of the pawn shop clerk and had little doubt that
Drizpaul was the killer.
   According to the Navy, Drizpaul shot and killed two sailors at
the living quarters they shared at the base on Jan. 15. The next
morning he killed a pawn shop clerk and critically wounded her
brother while taking a pistol from the shop, the Navy said.
   Drizpaul was found dead from an apparently self-inflicted
gunshot wound on Jan. 17 at a motel near Vancouver, Wash.,
authorities said.

   The Panama Canal's finance director
died Wednesday from a chest wound suffered after two hooded
intruders shot him at his home during an apparent break-in, Canal
Commission sources said.
   A commission source discarded any possibility the shooting
Tuesday night of William Joyce, the fourth-ranking official of the
nine-member Panama Canal Commission, was in retaliation for the
Dec. 20 U.S. invasion of Panama.
   ``It has all the signs of being a criminal action,'' the source,
who asked not to be identified, said. ``They entered his house,
robbed him and in the action killed him with one shot to the
chest.''
   The intruders took money and jewelry, commission sources said.
   Joyce, 56, was taken to the U.S. military's Gorgas Hospital and
died early Wednesday morning, they said.
   Joyce was born to American parents in the former Panama Canal
Zone, studied at The Citadel in Charleston, S.C., and had worked
for the Canal Commission since 1957, after serving as an infantry
lieutenant in the Army.
   The U.S. invasion overthrew military leader Manuel Antonio
Noriega, who was taken to Miami Jan. 3 for face trial on drug
trafficking charges. Washington cited danger to Americans residing
in Panama as one reason for the invasion.

   Twenty-four opponents of U.S. policy in El
Salvador were arrested Wednesday after disrupting a House hearing
on recent events in that country, Capitol Police said.
   Fifteen demonstrators were arrested inside the hearing room in
the Rayburn House Office Building and nine in the hallway outside,
the police said.
   The disruption inside the room started during testimony by
Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs.
   Some of the demonstrators, wearing black hoods and white masks,
stood and pointed at Aronson while reading statements denouncing
U.S. policy. One of the demonstrators said, ``El Salvador is
Spanish for Vietnam'' and another shouted that death squad murders
are ``on your hands, Mr. Aronson.''
   A short time later, a group of demonstrators began shouting and
chanting in the hallway.
   The hearing was conducted jointly by House Foreign Affairs
subcommittees on Western Hemisphere Affairs and International
Operations.
   All those arrested were charged with disrupting an orderly
session of Congress and demonstrating within a Capitol building.
Each charge is punishable by a maximum $500 fine, six months
imprisonment or both.
   Those arrested will be arraigned at D.C. Superior Court.

   Flooding from three days of torrential
rains have left at least 15 people dead and destroyed 11,000 homes,
authorities said Wednesday.
   Another 10 people are reported missing in central and southern
Tunisia, the regions of the North African country hit hardest since
the rains started Monday, according to Tunisian officials.
   The floodwaters washed away bridges and isolated some areas of
this largely desert country, and emergency supplies have been flown
in by helicopter to the communities of Gafsa, Sfax and Sidi Bouzid.
   The Tunisian Meteorology Institute predicted more rain Thursday
from the storm. Rainfall in some areas since Monday has equaled a

<HEAD>Absent Host Barry Prime Topic at Mayors Conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marion Barry, the absent host mayor, was a
prime topic of private and sometimes-public discussion Wednesday as
colleagues in the U.S. Conference of Mayors began a three-day
meeting marked by growing concerns about the nation's drug problems.
   ``As we see him moving to get treatment for himself, we are
caused to realize once again how important it is that treatment be
available not only to those in high places, but to everyone who
needs it,'' the conference's president, Houston Mayor Kathy
Whitmire said after a speech at the National Press Club.
   Members of the big-city mayors' task force on drugs convened for
a strategy session, meanwhile, with panel member Barry absent _
undergoing treatment in Florida.
   No mayor publicly mentioned Barry's arrest last week on a
cocaine possession charge during the task force meeting, but he
dominated their talk outside the meeting room.
   ``It was a tragedy for the mayor, and it was a tragedy for the
District of Columbia,'' said Philadelphia Mayor Wilson Goode. ``I
don't see how it has any impact on what we do here.''
   ``It epitomizes, it symbolizes, the extent of the drug problem
in this country,'' said Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn.
   Flynn said, ``I'd like to see an acknowledgement of Marion
Barry's problem'' by the mayor. He said that if Barry is cured of
any substance dependence problem, he should spend ``the rest of his
life as an example'' to young people about the problems of drugs.
   Whitmire praised the Bush administration's anti-drug efforts in
her speech at the press club, but said mayors are looking for more
direct federal aid to the cities, without the grants going through
state governments.
   Her only mention of Barry came in response to a question. She
said the arrest and his decision to seek treatment at a Florida
drug-and-alcoholism center underscored the broader need for drug
treatment opportunities. She said that as long as there is a demand
for drugs, dealers and producers will find ways to meet that demand.
   She and other mayors shied away from saying whether they
believed Barry should resign from office because of the cocaine
arrest.
   ``I'm not going to try to give any political advice to any other
mayors,'' she said.
   Barry's appointed anti-drug official for the city, Sterling
Tucker, sat in Barry's chair at the meeting of the drug task force.
Barry is also chairman of the mayors' transportation committee.
Conference spokesman Mike Brown said another mayor would fill in
for Barry when the panel meets Thursday.
   The mayors are awaiting President Bush's latest plans for
federal anti-drug efforts, and they released a study concluding
that only a small portion of federal drug-enforcement aid has made
it to the nation's cities.
   The study said city governments received just 15 percent of the
$150 million in federal funds available for drug enforcement
through the two main grant programs during the last fiscal year.
   Bush plans to address the mayors _ most of whom are Democrats _
on Friday. It will be the first time since Jimmy Carter in 1980
that an incumbent president has spoken to the organization of
big-city mayors.
   Among black mayors, Sharpe James of Newark, N.J., said he did
not embrace the suggestion of NAACP executive director Benjamin
Hooks that the arrest was part of a pattern of harassment of black
elected officials and a ``rising tide of racism.'' But he said
racism would be a factor in law enforcement ``until we rule out
racism in our country.''
   Another black mayor, Cardell Cooper of East Orange, N.J., said:
``I do believe black leadership has come under, certainly,
scrutiny. ... I don't know if you'd call it undue or not.'' He said
Barry ``might have put himself in position to invite'' attention
and scrutiny.
   A third black mayor said he did not see Barry's case as a
particular embarrassment for black officeholders or one that makes
their anti-drug efforts more difficult.
   ``It only proves mayors are human,'' said Mayor John Daniels of
New Haven, Conn.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. government on Wednesday criticized
South African police for using force to break up a protest in Cape
Town.
   ``We deplore the use of force to stifle peaceful protest,''
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler told reporters. ``We
have long urged an end to violence and repression as an important
step in the process of change in South Africa.''
   Ms. Tutwiler commented when asked about the police's use on
Tuesday of rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon to disperse
more than 5,000 black and mixed-race students who were protesting
government education policies.
   She reiterated the U.S. call for the South African government to
lift its state of emergency and restrictions on political activity
and noted that President F.W. de Klerk has allowed several other
political demonstrations to take place.
   Those protests, she said, ``were peaceful and contributed to the
opening of a dialogue between all South Africans.''
   ``During the difficult period ahead, in which the process of
moving towards negotiations may sometimes become overheated, we ask
all parties in South Africa to practice restraint and good sense in
the search for a peaceful avenue for change,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.

<HEAD>Germany Says Warning of Terrorists Prompted Search of Libyan Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany said Wednesday that
a ``concrete warning'' about possible terrorists aboard a Libyan
airliner prompted its police to hold and search the aircraft for
hours at Frankfurt Airport.
   The action Tuesday drew a strong protest from Col. Moammar
Gadhafi's Libyan government.
   The Libyan Arab Airlines plane was allowed to return to Tripoli
Wednesday.
   Border police detained and searched the Boeing 727 at Frankfurt
Tuesday shortly after it arrived from the Libyan capital with 75
passengers plus crew.
   Chief government spokesman Hans Klein refused to divulge the
source of the ``concrete warning'' he said triggered the action and
would not say if it was a foreign intelligence service.
   Federal security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said there was a tip terrorists might have been aboard.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Roland Bachmeier told reporters
three armed men were detained for carrying weapons without permits,
but were released after they turned out to be the airline's
security guards.
   Bachmeier defended the government's actions, saying West Germany
must ``take seriously'' such a warning. He said any other eaction
would be ``gross negligence and contrary to duty.''
   He denied Libyan allegations that passengers were mistreated by
police.
   Police detained and searched the plane shortly after it landed
in Frankfurt at 3:49 p.m. Tuesday. All luggage was closely
inspected.
   The search lasted until 9:45 p.m., but the captain refused to
take off without the three guards who had been detained, Bachmeier
said.
   The jetliner left for Tripoli at 11:06 a.m. Tuesday, Frankfurt
Airport spokesman Wolfgang Schwalm said.
   The Libyan news agency JANA, monitored in London, quoted the
plane's captain as saying after the aircraft returned to Libya that
German authorities ordered a search of the plane without offering
any explanation.
   JANA quoted him as saying passengers were searched, ``most of
whom were women, children and sick people.''
   The agency's account said the search caused ``trouble and delay,
which led to a deterioration in the state of the sick and made the
women and children distraught.''
   The captain, who was not identified, was quoted as saying that
armed West German police boarded the plane as soon as it landed at
Frankfurt, the crew were prevented from disembarking and the
airline's agents were not allowed on board.

<HEAD>Soviets Agree to Repatriate Dutch Drawings, Magazine Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>For Release 6:30 p.m. EST</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is cooperating with Dutch
authorities in trying to locate and return a valuable collection of
Old Master drawings that was sold illegally to the Nazis and seized
by Russian troops during World War II, ARTnews magazine reported
Wednesday.
   A copyrighted article in the magazine's February issue, which
will appear on newsstands Monday, said that after years of balking
at Dutch diplomatic efforts to repatriate the drawings, the Soviets
agreed to cooperate during a meeting with Dutch cultural official
Jan Riezenkamp in Moscow last October.
   The focus of the Dutch government's search is a collection of
491 Old Master drawings, valued at $50 million to $75 million, that
once belonged to Franz Koenigs, a German-born Dutch industrialist
who assembled the art works in the 1920s.
   The collection included works by Correggio, Rembrandt, Titian,
Anthony Van Dyck, Albrecht Durer, Jean-Honore Fragonard, Hans
Holbein, Filippino Lippi, Peter Paul Rubens, Jacopo Tintoretto and
Antoine Watteau.
   Dutch concern over recovering the missing drawings from the
Soviet Union was heightened when two of the drawings surfaced
recently in New York and London in the hands of private dealers and
collectors, the magazine said. Their reappearance prompted the
Dutch government to file lawsuits for the drawings' return.
   ARTnews said a large portion of the Koenigs collection was sold
illegally to Adolf Hitler's agent, Hans Posse, in Rotterdam during
World War II for an art museum that Hitler planned to build in his
native Austria. Posse often bought art at forced sales from
unwilling sellers, paying far below market value, the magazine said.
   The Koenigs drawings were moved to Dresden, Germany, which came
under Soviet occupation. After the war, the drawings and millions
of other art treasures were transferred to the Soviet Union, where
the drawings disappeared and were feared destroyed.
   The magazine said Soviet and East German authorities repeatedly
rebuffed Dutch efforts to locate and repatriate the drawings during
the 1940s and 1950s. It quoted Riezenkamp as crediting Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's liberal policies for the recent
change in Soviet attitude toward the Dutch requests.
   Riezenkamp now believes at least some of the drawings eventually
will be repatriated with Soviet cooperation, said the magazine,
which is published in New York.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Wednesday called on private
organizations to help revive East European economies.
   ``Government alone simply cannot get the job done,'' Bush said.
   The administration, he said, is considering funds for other
countries in the region in addition to the assistance it has
pledged for Hungary and Poland.
   The president's comments came as the new government of Romania
said the United States had sent nothing in aid while providing more
than $1 billion to Poland and Hungary.
   Ion Radulescu, who organizes distribution of foreign aid for the
interim National Salvation Front government, said many other
countries, even poor ones, had sent supplies and aid, but not the
United States.
   However, Embassy spokeswoman Agota Kuperman said the United
States gave $500,000 worth of assistance to Romania through the
International Committee of the Red Cross.
   Bush said Romania shouldn't complain about not getting U.S. aid
because private groups have been doing their share there.
   ``I'm not sure the people in Europe understand that yet,'' he
told a group of leaders of non-profit organizations interested in
Poland.
   The organization Americare has provided more than $1 million
worth of assistance to Romania, he said.
   ``Many of you here, I'm told, are already involved in Eastern
Europe doing work that the government could not possibly begin to
do on its own, but there's more, much more to be done at this
decisive moment in history,'' Bush said.
   The administration has announced a $200 million grant as part of
a multilateral $1 billion stabilization fund for Poland. In
addition, Bush has signed a $938 million aid package over three
years for Poland and Hungary.
   ``We are now actively considering additional support for the
other countries of the region as they move down the path of
democratic reform,'' he said. ``But the government alone simply
cannot get the job done _ don't have the resources, cannot do it.
   ``And we need the private sector _ non-profit and profit _ to
engage its vitality and resources in this exciting process that's
under way in Eastern Europe.''

   Moslem militants chanting ``The blood of
the martyr will not be wasted!'' went on a stone-throwing rampage
Wednesday to protest the killing of a colleague in an earlier
demonstration, officials said.
   Extremists also beat a village grocer and his family with chains
because male and female family members worked together in the
store, the security officials said. It was the second such attack
in three days in this restive center of religious extremism 240
miles south of Cairo.
   On Monday, security police clashed with about 300 Moslem
militants demonstrating outside a mosque. A demonstrator was killed
and another seriously injured by bullets allegedly fired by
policemen.
   Protesters on Wednesday smashed at least nine shop windows
before owners opened fire and dispersed them. No injuries were
reported.
   Police arrived and arrested nine people, said Attorney General
Abdel-Mokhtar, but they were released later.
   Mokhtar said about 10 Moslem extremists used heavy chains in the
attack on the grocer and his wife, daughter and three sons, all of
whom work in the shop together.
   The family, also Moslems, were taken to a hospital for treatment
of their injuries. But Mokhtar said they identified their
assailants as Moslem extremists who warned the grocer last year
against employing women.
   Some fundamentalists interpret Islam as forbidding mixing of
sexes outside the home. In Mondays' attack, a Coptic Christian
grocer was roughed up and his shop burned also because he employed
a female relative.
   Assiut, a university center, has been a center of religious
activism since 1981, when Islamic militants attempted a coup in its
streets immediately after the assassination of President Anwar
Sadat. Most of the more than 80 people who died were policemen.
   Since then, Moslem activist students and others demanding
immediate implementation of the 1,350-year-old Islamic legal and
ethnical code called Sharia often have clashed with police. They
also have tried to impose their strict interpretation of Islam on
other students by violently breaking up coed parties or plays and
attacking male and female students seen together.
   Assiut has a laerge Coptic population. It has seen a few similar
sectarian atacks over the years.

   An earthquake measuring 5.7 on the Richter
Scale was recorded in the South China Sea early Thursday, the Hong
Kong Observatory said.
   The observatory said the quake was recorded at 3:36 a.m. (2:36

of Hong Kong near the northern coast of the Philippines' main Luzon
island.
   The observatory said no further details were immediately
available.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on

in magnitude. An earthquake measuring 6 can cause severe damage in
populated areas.
   The quake that struck northern California in October measured

   The White House, worried about exposing
reporters to danger during next month's drug summit in Colombia,
may put most of the press corps covering President Bush in another
country such as Panama, Costa Rica or Venezuela, spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Wednesday.
   He said there was ``a good chance'' the press would be located
somewhere other than Colombia when Bush visits there Feb. 15 for
several hours of talks with President Virgilio Barco and officials
of Peru and Bolivia.
   Other countries under consideration for the press include
Jamaica, Puerto Rico and Aruba.
   The alternate-site plan would run counter to a long-standing
policy of having the press corps close to Bush on foreign trips.
   There have been numerous reports of threatened violence against
Bush and others in Colombia by cocaine drug lords angry about a
government crackdown against their operations.
   Most recently, CBS News said drug terrorists were buying
surface-to-air missiles to try to shoot down Bush's plane.
   Fitzwater said the Secret Service was confident it could provide
protection for Bush in Colombia, but that it has no authority to do
the same for reporters.
   Tentative plans had called for the White House to set up filing
facilities for the press at a commercial airport at Cartagena near
the expected summit site.
   Fitzwater said there was ``a lot of deep concern about having it
at the airport'' since it was exposed to the general population.
   ``The way to answer that concern,'' he said, ``is to put it
someplace else.''
   Traditionally, 11 reporters accompany Bush on Air Force One as a
``pool'' while the remainder of the press travel on a plane
chartered by the White House and paid for by their companies.
   The pool frequently is expanded to permit more photographers,
cameramen and reporters into situations where coverage is limited.
   Fitzwater said that under the plan being considered, a pool of
undetermined size would accompany Bush to the actual summit, while
the overwhelming majority of the press would go elsewhere.
   He said he had talked with a number of reporters about the idea
and that they were ``generally favorable to having the filing
center in another country.''
   Fitzwater said that ``anybody who doesn't like it is free to go
(to Cartagena) on their own.'' However, it was unclear how anyone
who traveled independently could get access to Bush and the summit
proceedings.
   The press secretary said he was examining logistics about an
alternate site, such as how the press would be briefed on summit
developments and the possibility that Bush might go to the filing
center afterward for a news conference.
   ``The one thing I'm worried about are those SAM (surface-to-air)
missiles that you can be back quite a distance and you can launch
those numbers and you can create some trouble,'' said Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mich., who just returned from a congressional trip to
Colombia, Bolivia and Peru.
   Conyers discussed security with Bush after a meeting on the
president's decision to support Cabinet status for the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   ``I know that they can secure the immediate area around
Cartagena,'' Conyers said. ``But if they've got SAM missiles, the
insurgents ... that's a security problem I hope they've thought
about.''

<HEAD>Four Armed Albanians Escape to Yugoslavia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four armed Albanians escaped from
their isolated, hard-line communist country over the heavily
guarded border to Yugoslavia, the Tanjug news agency reported
Wednesday.
   It said they crossed into Montenegro, a Yugoslav republic. The
Yugoslav agency said the four carried weapons, but did not
elaborate.
   Travel is heavily restricted in Albania, Eastern Europe's most
tightly controlled country and the last holdout for Stalinism on
the Continent, and escapes are extremely rare.
   In recent weeks reports of unrest in Albania have cropped up
repeatedly in Yugoslav, Greek and other Western media but could not
be independently confirmed. Few foreigners are allowed to enter
Albania.
   Albanian leaders dismissed the reports as ``slanders'' and
``fabrications.''
   Tanjug reported signs of ``increased military activity'' in
Albania but gave no source for its information and offered no
details.
   While reforms has swept the rest of communist Europe, Albania
has jealously guarded its Stalinist system and sworn under
Communist leader Ramiz Alia not to veer from its path.
   In Athens, 10 Albanian defectors chained themselves to the
railings of the Albanian Embassy on Wednesday to protest a visit by
Albania's foreign undersecretary, but police cut the chains and the
demonstrators left, Greek authorities said.
   The Albanians, all of whom had been granted asylum in Greece,
accused the Tirana government of suppressing political and
religious freedom.
   Albania, sandwiched between Greece and Yugoslavia, has a
population of about 3 million.
   In a gesture of good will Wednesday, the Albanian Embassy in
Athens told the mayor of the northern Greek town of Ioannina that
the remains of Greek soldiers killed in the 1940 Greek-Italian war
would be returned.
   In 1987, Greece ended a technical state of war with Albania that
had existed since Greeks battled invading Italian forces on the
Albanian border in 1940.

   The second phase of the National Drug Control
Strategy, to be unveiled Thursday by President Bush, will call for
spending more than $10.5 billion on the war against drugs in 1991,
at least $1 billion more than this year, an administration source
said Wednesday.
   Money for the Pentagon's effort to battle drugs would rise about
50 percent, from $880 million this year to $1.2 billion in fiscal
1991, a draft of the strategy said.
   Congress allocated about $8.8 billion for the drug war this
fiscal year, about $900 million more than the $7.9 billion sought
by Bush in the strategy unveiled in September.
   But the new strategy, basing drug war expenditures on new base
figures, says the country is now spending $9.5 billion, not $8.8
billion, said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   ``They have gone through the accounts at the various agencies so
you can make straight-line accounts from year to year,'' the
official said. ``As part of the process of going through all this,
they found that it is appropriate and possible to attribute moneys
that had not previously been attributed to drugs.''
   In the new strategy, the prior-year totals have been altered to
reflect the changes so that the administration cannot be accused of
improperly inflating the figures for 1991, the official said.
   The new strategy will also intensify federal anti-drug efforts
in five areas immediately, said other administration sources, all
of whom requested anonymity.
   Those areas _ metropolitan New York, Miami, Houston, Los Angeles
and virtually all of the Southwest border _ will be designated as
high-intensity drug-trafficking regions and will benefit this year
from $25 million previously approved by Congress to fight drugs in
the worst-afflicted regions and from as much as $21 million from
the federal asset-forfeiture fund, the sources said.
   By and large, the strategy's focus will remain as it was in the
original plan:
   _Harsh, state-imposed penalties for drug users.
   _Intensified treatment and prevention efforts.
   _Bigger budgets for law enforcement at all levels.
   One source said that the targeting of five areas in the war
against drugs this year will not mean more money for local
governments.
   Those governments ``won't see any checks,'' said the source.
``What they will see is increased awareness and cooperation from
the feds, that type of thing. The money is going to the feds for
them to increase their efforts ... to highlight their presence in
those areas.''
   The federal anti-drug effort will also target regions
surrounding designated cities, the source said.
   He said the Los Angeles metropolitan area will include Los
Angeles and Orange County.
   A draft of the strategy says the New York area includes Nassau
County in New York and Essex County in New Jersey.
   The Miami area includes Broward, Dade and Monroe counties. The
Houston area includes Harris and Galveston counties.
   The Southwest region includes 35 counties in California,
Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.
   Other counties in each area may be included in the final version
of the strategy, the source said.
   Whether these regions will be targeted for 1991 as well remains
undecided, the source said.
   ``If we're successful, we would anticipate that these spots will
move,'' the source said. ``As the emphasis increases on the
Southwest border, (the drug traffickers) will go toward Louisiana
or inland, or to Canada and come down. We'll have to monitor it to
see what happens the second time around.''
   The updated strategy also will propose a broadening of federal
drug crimes for which the death penalty can be imposed, in line
with changes Bush said last year that he wanted to make.
   Those proposals call for allowing the death penalty to be
imposed on drug kingpins even when they or their organizations have
not killed anyone, on kingpins who attemp to kill to obstruct
justice and on federal drug felons whose offenses result in death,
such as an overdose by a drug user.
   Another new idea in the draft strategy is for the ``development
of large drug treatment `campuses' located on public land, serving
thousands of patients with a range of state-of-the art treatment
methods and associated social services.''
   Other programs slated for substantial spending increases in
1991, if Congress approves, are block grants to states for
treatment and law enforcement; the Drug Enforcement Administration
and its state and local task forces; the FBI; the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, for inspectors and border patrols; the
Customs Service; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the
Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force program and the U.S.
Marshals Service's transportation and detention program, as well as
its witness-protection program.
   The draft strategy also calls for greatly intensified efforts to
eradicate domestic marijuana production and proposes more money for
the National Institute of Drug Abuse, in part so that it can
conduct its household survey of drug use annually, rather than
every three years.
   William J. Bennett, director of the Office of National Drug
Control Policy, and budget director Richard Darman were reported by
an administration official last month to be ``apart by more than a
couple of hundred million dollars'' on the 1991 drug war budget.
   Sources said Wednesday that Darman won the battle, saying
Bennett originally had requested a 20 percent to 30 percent
increase.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A biography of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the
British poet who wrote ``The Ancient Mariner'' and ``Kubla Khan,''
was named the Whitbread Book of the Year on Wednesday.
   Author Richard Holmes was awarded the prize and $36,300 for his
biography ``Coleridge: Early Visions.''
   The volume is the first part of a major series on Coleridge, who
was an opium addict and contemporary of William Wordsworth.
   ``The prize means basically that I will have time to write
more,'' said the former teacher after receiving the award at
Whitbread's, a brewing firm.
   Holmes's book was voted Biography of the Year by Whitbread
judges in October. Competitors for the Book of the Year were
October's winners in the categories of first novel, best novel,
poetry and children's novel.
   Last year's Book of the Year award went to ``The Comforts of
Madness,'' Paul Sayer's first novel about long-term psychiatric
hospital patients who cannot speak.

<HEAD>Vandalism Heats Up Conflict Over Inner-City Tobacco and Alcohol
Ads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   The paintbrush-wielding ``magician'' who made
several billboards disappear under coats of white paint said
Wednesday he's fed up with glamorous ads touting tobacco and
alcohol in inner-city neighborhoods.
   But a billboard company spokesman said the paint jobs are
vandalism.
   The painter, who's taken the pseudonym Mandrake after the
comic-strip magician, said billboard ads in predominantly black and
Hispanic neighborhoods on the South Side are aimed at young people
and promote dangerous vices.
   Mandrake, who described himself as a 54-year-old black
professional but declined to give his real name, said he's taken a
paintbrush to billboards three times in broad daylight because the
ads corrupt young people.
   ``I have seen over the past two years a disproportionate amount
of advertising in the black and Hispanic community,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``I believe it was time for us to stand up and
fight back.
   ``I'm a firm believer in the Constitution and believe the law
was broken ... but at the same time, there is a moral obligation, a
right, that must be addressed,'' he said.
   Geoff Obrzut, a spokesman for national billboard company Patrick
Media, said he filed a police report Wednesday.
   ``He's obviously vandalizing private property,'' Obrzut said in
a telephone interview. ``We would be willing to prosecute if he's
caught.''
   Mandrake's actions have helped fuel a controversy over the
targeting of minorities by alcohol and tobacco companies.
   On one side stand consumer advocates alarmed by the number of
people from inner-city communities dying from smoking- and
drinking-related illnesses.
   On the other side are industry representatives, who dismiss
attacks on such advertising as an infringement of the
constitutional right to freedom of speech. Industry representatives
contend that ads specifically aimed at minorities are harmless and
that people make their own decision about whether to light up or
take a drink.
   However, the lung cancer rate has increased four times faster
among blacks than among whites in the past 30 years, according to
reports from the American Lung Association and the National Cancer
Institute.
   A 1987 study by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a
health advocacy group based in Washington, found that black men
have a 70 percent higher death rate from cirrhosis of the liver
than whites.
   The health advocacy group contends that children are being
encouraged by the billboard ads.
   ``Children on the way to school and back home or even at recess
get the message that the way to be happy, glamorous, or athletic is
to smoke and-or drink,'' a center publication said.
   Obrzut disagreed, saying that while 50 percent of billboard
advertising does occur in the inner city, a company study found
that only 16 percent of Chicago's 2,500 billboards were alcohol- or
tobacco-related.
   Gary Miller, a spokesman for the American Tobacco Institute in
Washington, said studies also show that young people become smokers
primarily because of peer group pressures and parental influence.
   He said tobacco companies might advertise to minorities because
more minorities than whites tend to be smokers.
   ``Just like an effective advertisement, you try to reach those
people to whom it appeals,'' Miller said in a telephone interview.
   Janet Flynn of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United
States, echoed Miller's sentiments, saying: ``We restrict our
advertising to responsible adult customers.''
   Advocacy groups say advertisers only respond to pressure.
   In Baltimore, pressure from various groups led an advertising
company to remove much of its black-oriented advertising.
   And R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. recently scrapped plans to test
market Uptown, a new cigarette aimed at the black community, after
opposition from the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.

   Azerbaijanis fired on Soviet forces in Baku harbor
from merchant ships Wednesday but were routed and forced to lift a
5-day-old sea blockade of the city, Soviet media and residents
reported.
   Soldiers rounded up 43 activists and banned rallies in Baku,
where ethnic violence began Nov. 13 between Moslem Azerbaijanis and
Armenians, most of whom are Christians. Soldiers' families and
thousands of Russians were evacuated Wednesday.
   State television said the port terminal came under attack from
ships of the Caspian Sea Oil Fleet and two soldiers were wounded.
   Tankers and other vessels with Azerbaijani crews had blocked the
harbor because they suspected military authorities of planning to
smuggle out bodies of people killed by Soviet soldiers, said
Tunzala Kasumova, a journalist in Baku, a city with 1.8 million
residents.
   Captains of the oil tankers and barges were said to have
threatened to blow up their vessels if military vessels tried to
break through.
   Red Army soldiers moved into the Azerbaijani capital Saturday to
quell a nationalist uprising and anti-Armenian riots.
   Ms. Kasumova said the 40-minute harbor battle began when a
military cutter tried to break through the blockade, and troops
near the terminal joined in to help the cutter.
   ``I could hear the thunder, the shooting and cannonade,'' the
journalist said of what she described as an exchange of artillery
and automatic weapons fire. Ms. Kasumova spoke by telephone from
her home near the harbor.
   Soviet television said several people detained in connection
with the fight had weapons and drugs in their possession.
   It was the first involvement of ships in the conflict, which
began with Azerbaijani attacks on Armenians but has become an armed
confrontation between the Azerbaijani republic and the central
authority in Moscow.
   Izvestia, the government newspaper, reported Wednesday that
clashes between Azerbaijanis and Soviet troops were taking the form
of a partisan war, including frequent night attacks on patrols.
   Violence began Jan. 13 with rioting by Azerbaijanis in which
dozens of ethnic Armenians were killed.
   An estimated 16,000 Armenians left the city and ethnic war began
in the hills around the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and
on the border between the Armenian and Azerbaijani republics. At
least 171 people have been killed.
   Baku residents said the city was quiet Wednesday for the first
time in weeks, except for the harbor and some shooting around an
army barracks. A general strike continued.
   Leila Yunusova, an Azerbaijani activist, said people observed
the ban on mass meetings but many attended small gatherings to
renounce their Communist Party memberships and protest the Soviet
military presence. She said 100,000 of Azerbaijan's 380,000
Communists had torn up their party cards.
   Tass said demonstrations and strikes were banned in Baku
beginning Wednesday and activists were told they could be sent to
jail for 30 days if they tried to organize such protests.
   Soviet media reported growing threats against the Russian
population of Baku from Azerbaijanis reacting to the army's attacks
on militants and attempts to restore order. About 100,000 Russians
live in Baku.
   Many Russians left the city and Tass said the Soviet military
evacuated more than 16,000 wives and children of soldiers.
   Trud, a labor newspaper, reported attacks on the apartments of
Russians and said Azerbaijani were refusing to sell bread to
Russians.
   Militants continued storming weapons depots in Armenia and
Azerbaijan and had stolen more than 5,000 guns and other materiel
in two days, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said in
Moscow.
   A tank, two 76mm cannons and an anti-aircraft gun were among
items stolen Wednesday from the war museum in Yerevan, capital of
Armenia, Tass said.
   Officials have blamed banned groups for inciting violence, but
Sivinch Abdullayev, an editor at the republic's official news
agency Azerinform, said leaders of the Azerbaijani People's Front
apparently were not included in the roundup. Authorities have been
particularly critical of the front.
   Soviet TV suggested Wednesday night that the government meet
with all groups in Azerbaijan, including the People's Front.
   Tass said the National Defense Committee, a militant branch of
the front, was specifically banned.
   Ms. Abdullayev reported that National Defense Committee member
Neimat Panakhov said at a funeral rally Monday the leaders of the
committee and front were going underground. She said none had been
seen since.
   Azerbaijan's Communist Party Central Committee began a meeting
after curfew Wednesday night so the building would not be
surrounded by demonstrators, said legislative spokesman Nizami
Sakyakhov.
   Jeikhun Mula-Zade, a political scientist, said it would consider
breaking with the national party, as Lithuanian Communists did last
month, and would elect a new first secretary to replace
Abdul-Rakhman Vezirov, who was fired after Soviet troops entered
Baku.
   Ms. Yunusova, the activist, said Vezirov had been expelled from
the party and criminal charges might be brought against him.
   Talks between Armenian and Azerbaijani officials in the Armenian
town of Yeraskh broke down Wednesday, Tass reported, but it said
said efforts were under way to set up negotiations in other border
areas.
   Some skirmishes were reported in Azerbaijan. In Armenia,
industry and transport remained nearly halted because of a rail
blockade by Azerbaijan that has caused a severe fuel shortage, Tass
reported.
   It said 10 freight trains finally had been permitted through
Azerbaijan, but a section of track in a predominantly Azerbaijani
section of Georgia was dismantled, causing an accident that injured
four passengers and cutting Armenia's last rail link with the rest
of the Soviet Union.
   Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave in Azerbaijan with a predominantly
Armenian population, is at the crux of a conflict between the
ethnic groups that began two years ago. Both sides claim the
fertile, hilly region of about 160,000 people.

   A junk dealer questioned in the mail
bomb deaths of a civil rights lawyer and a federal judge who ruled
against him insisted Wednesday the FBI has found nothing linking
him to the slayings.
   A law enforcement source in Washington, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said earlier in the day that Robert Wayne O'Ferrell is
considered a suspect and had failed a series of lie detector tests
administered by the FBI.
   O'Ferrell, who has seen his home, junk business and other
properties pored over since the FBI converged on southeast Alabama
Monday, once complained in a legal brief that America's court
system ``is corrupt.''
   O'Ferrell, who has denied any part in the mail bomb deaths, said
agents have not found a typewriter that reportedly links
typewritten court correspondence he filed in 1988 with typed
material sent by the mail bomber.
   ``You can't keep looking when you don't find nothing,'' he told
reporters as he fed dogs and horses at his rural home.
   O'Ferrell confirmed he took several polygraph tests this week,
but said, ``I have not been told I am a suspect and have not been
told I failed a lie detector.''
   No charges have been filed against O'Ferrell, and FBI agent
Chuck Archer, who has declined to use the term ``suspect'' in
referring to O'Ferrell, said no suspects have been taken into
custody.
   Agents are searching for clues in the package bomb deaths of
Judge Robert Vance of Birmingham, who died Dec. 16, and black
lawyer Robert Robinson, of Savannah, Ga., who was killed two days
later.
   Vance was a member of a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta that ruled last year against
O'Ferrell, who was sueing his former employer, Gulf Life Insurance
Co.
   An Atlanta TV station received a letter signed ``Americans for a
Competent Federal Judicial System'' that claimed responsibility for
the mail bombings and included racist comments.
   The legal brief O'Ferrell filed in 1988 against Gulf Life
included a typwritten document that says in part:
   ``The law and court system in these UNITED STATES is corrupt,
that I have had anything to do with. But I know you can help clean
it up.... If anyone has been mistreated by Gulf Life ... the
Courts, and two Attorneys, I really believe that I have.''
   The capitalization and grammar is as it appears in the document.
   But the court documents O'Ferrell filed do not mention racial
topics, considered by many the motivation for the two killings.
   According to the law enforcement source, O'Ferrell gave answers
considered deceptive by a polygraph expert when he failed the lie
detector tests. Results of polygraph tests are not always reliable
and are inadmissable in criminal trials. It could not be determined
what questions the FBI asked O'Ferrell.
   Agents have searched O'Ferrell's home, junk warehouse, abandoned
downtown store and two septic tanks, and more locales were on a
list to be searched.
   ``They are obtaining more (warrants) and will be searching
further,'' said Charles Steinmetz, a spokesman at FBI headquarters
in Washington.
   At O'Ferrell's salvage business Wednesday, agents pumped out a
septic tank and removed items from the tin-covered building onto a
rented truck. Men wearing FBI jackets hung green tarpaulins on the
front of the structure, and stacked up boxes to block the view of
dozens of reporters and news cameras.
   The contents of the warehouse's septic tank, located in an
adjoining shed, was pumped out after firefighters clad in bright
yellow containment-suits tested for any build-up of flammable
methane gas in the underground tank.
   The FBI also has canvassed town businesses asking for
information on O'Ferrell's buying habits.
   O'Ferrell's father, J.C. O'Ferrell, said the FBI questioned him
about the activities of both his sons, Wayne and James ``Buddy''
O'Ferrell.
   ``They were trying to say my two sons had something to do with
that bombing up in Birmingham,'' the father told the Birmingham
Post-Herald. ``They asked had I ever heard either one talk bad
about colored folks, or if my sons ever made threats on any judges.
I said, `No, my children weren't raised that way.'''

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hooded protesters exchanged gunfire
with police Wednesday at Central University, and at least two
protesters were wounded as unrest flared anew over the government's
austerity measures.
   The street battle broke out about noon as the protesters, most
of them teenagers, gathered rocks, assembled firebombs out of beer
bottles and distributed pamphlets to students at Venezuela's
largest university.
   Battles between police and rioters on university grounds had
died down since riots last March over austerity cuts and steep
price hikes on food and public transportation left about 300 dead.
   The 11-month-old government of social democratic President
Carlos Andres Perez plans to cut subsidies on gasoline prices, and
labor union officials said Wednesday they will stage protests
beginning next month. Perez wants to reduce Venezuela's 80 percent
annual inflation rate and the $34 billion foreign debt.
   ``We're a small group, maybe fifty, but we represent the
discontents of the majority of Venezuelans,'' said a hooded
teenager who called himself Cinco.
   ``We're out here again, after a year of quiet, to again do
battle with the bourgeois forces of repression,'' said Cinco.
``We're hoping the people will take to the streets again.''
   A student nearby called the protest a traditional activity.
   ``It's the student's duty to protest, because we are unhappy
with a series of problems facing the country,'' he said, citing the
rising cost of living.
   The government has warned that gasoline prices in Venezuela,
some of the cheapest in the world, will be raised within a few
months.
   The protesters, wearing hoods, edged close to the university's
main gate, as lines of Metropolitan police in riot gear, with tear
gas canisters on the ends of their rifles, crouched behind cars in
a plaza outside.
   A hooded boy pulled out a homemade gun and fired at the police,
setting off the battle.
   With battle cries, the group of protesters threw rocks and
firebombs, while the police fired tear gas canisters. But the wind
pushed most of the tear gas back at police.
   Occasionally, shotgun pellets whistled overhead from the police.
   After a few hours the fighting slowly finally died down after
police advanced to the gate and the protesters _ along with
students in team uniforms playing soccer on a field _ retreated
into classroom buildings.
   Two protesters were hit by shotgun pellets as they braved the
police fire head-on. Carlos Salgado, an economics student, was hit
in the chest and arm and checked into the university infirmary. An
unidentified protester was hit in the shoulder, but continued to do
battle.
   Students began to troop out of the main entrance, tired of
waiting for the protesters to give up. Police waited patiently.
   ``We have them behind the line. Its only a small number of
troublemakers,'' said Sheriff Raul Vivas, commander of a
Metropolitan police anti-riot brigade.
   He said police suffered no injuries.
   The nations' largest labor union, the Confederation of
Venezuelan Workers, or CTV, said they would call for marches
against the planned gasoline price hike starting February 15.
   The CTV paralyzed Venezuela for 12 hours last April in a
nationwide work stoppage.
   Perez, inaugurated last Feb. 2, has instituted austerity
measures in part to qualify for financing through the International
Monetary Fund. The country's foreign debt is fourth largest in
Latin America after Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.

<HEAD>FCC Considering Stiffer Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Federal Communications
Commission told Congress on Wednesday he wants more stringent rules
against drug involvement by broadcasters.
   The commission chairman, Alfred Sikes, wrote Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, that he had
asked the commission staff for a ``thorough examination'' of the
commission's 1986 ``Character Policy Statement.''
   The current policy, which was adopted under FCC Chairman Mark S.
Fowler, does not say whether such things as drug possession and
pending drug charges against broadcasters should be taken into
account during license proceedings.
   Until the 1986 FCC ruling, any felony conviction automatically
had been considered relevant to an applicant's suitability to hold
a broadcast license. But the commission narrowed the scope of
issues it was willing to consider.
   ``There is no scarcity of law-abiding citizens interested in
being broadcast licensees,'' Sikes wrote Dingell. ``Today, there
are also fewer objective requirements associated with holding a
broadcast license. Consequently, in my view current or prospective
broadcast licensees should be held to a higher standard than is
reflected in the current policy statement.''
   Dingell, whose committee oversees the commission, said Sikes'
position ``is a refreshing change.''
   ``His commitment to thoroughly reexamining that policy goes a
long way toward restoring my confidence in the FCC's judgment and
willingness to regulate in the public interest,'' said Dingell, who
battled continually with Sikes' deregulation-minded predecessors,
Fowler and Dennis R. Patrick.
   Sikes last September announced the commission automatically
would consider drug dealing convictions as possible grounds for
yanking a broadcasters' license, but he did not mention drug
possession convictions.
   Congress, when it passed the 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, denied
``federal benefits'' to drug violators, but it did not say whether
an FCC license was a federal benefit.
   Sikes wrote that although the commission had some discretion in
drug matters involving broadcasters, ``drug possession is not
specifically mentioned as within the scope of the Character Policy
Statement.''
   Misdemeanor drug convictions that do not deny federal benefits
under the 1988 drug law also are not mentioned in the policy
statement, Sikes said. Therefore, such a conviction would not be
considered relevant to an applicant's basic qualifications in a
license renewal or transfer proceeding, Sikes said.
   The policy statement also does not mention drug-associated
activities, such as money laundering, extortion, theft, burglary or
robbery. It says specifically that homicide will not disqualify an
applicant.
   But, Sikes said, the commission retains the discretion to
consider misconduct that is ``so egregious as to shock the
conscience.''
   In felony cases, Sikes added, an applicant may buy or sell a
station until the charges are proven. The commission could,
however, grant approval of a license contingent upon the outcome of
the pending criminal proceeding.
   Applicants convicted of misconduct at one station may not
automatically be disqualified from owning other stations, Sikes
said.
   The commission's drug policy was called into question when in
1988 it renewed the license of Williamsburg County Broadcasting
Corp. to operate WKSP-AM, in Kingstree, S.C., after the company's
principal owner, Gregory Knop, was convicted of a cocaine charge.
   In its September revisions, the commission said Knop's
conviction raised questions about Williamsburg's qualifications to
hold the license.

   A petition signed by 181 French lawmakers has
nominated former Romanian dissident Doina Cornea for the Nobel
Peace Prize, the sponsor said Wednesday.
   Pierre Lequiller, a National Assembly member from the
conservative Union for French Democracy, said the petition got
broad support from parties of the left and right, but not from the
hard-line French Communist Party,
   He said the nomination was sent Friday to the Nobel Peace Prize
committee in Oslo, Norway. Lequiller said he had asked U.S.,
British, Italian and Spanish legislators to support it.
   Mrs. Cornea, 60, is an instructor at Cluj University and endured
years of hardship for publicly opposing the repressive policies of
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who was overthrown and executed in
December.
   She suffered beatings by the security police and was under
virtual house arrest.
   After Ceausecu fell, she became a member of the ruling National
Salvation Front, composed largely of former Communists. The daily
Romania Libera said she quit after the Front announced Tuesday it
would run candidates in elections set for May 20.

   Israeli Labor Party leader Shimon Peres said
he and President Hosni Mubarak discussed ``new ideas'' on Wednesday
to overcome difficulties blocking Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
   ``I think I will be going back home with some messages of
importance,'' said Peres, deputy premier and finance minister,
after a meeting of about 90 minutes with Mubarak.
   As he did when he arrived Tuesday night, Peres said agreement is
close on convening an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue in Cairo as a
step toward peace negotiations.
   But Israel radio on Wednesday quoted a spokesman for Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir as disputing Peres' optimistic appraisal.
   In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said when
asked about Peres' optimistic statements: ``I'm not sure that I
would have used the characterization that Mr. Peres used. I'm not
sure that I'm that encouraged. I think we still have a long ways to
go.''
   Upon landing at Tel Aviv from Cairo, Peres called Baker's
comment ``a matter of judgment.
   ``I think that the problems that are still outstanding can be
solved now,'' he said. ``These are matters in which the
immagination is richer than the problem.''
   Peres, whose Labor Party joined Shamir's Likud Bloc in a
coalition Cabinet in 1988 after inconclusive parliamentary
elections, did not say who presented the ideas he discussed with
Mubarak. Nor did he indicate whether the messages he was taking
home from Cairo are Mubarak's views or the Egyptian president's
reactions to Israeli ideas.
   Peres said, however, that some of the ideas concern composition
of the Palestinian delegation to the proposed dialogue in Cairo,
which Egypt and the United States are pushing. This and the agenda
have been major stumbling blocks.
   ``The remaining problems between us and the Palestinians can be
solved rather swiftly and in a very short while,'' Peres said.
``There are some new ideas introduced to do so.''
   He reiterated that both he and Shamir oppose any participation
in the peace process by the Palestine Liberation Organization. But
unlike the hard-line prime minister, Peres favored including in the
delegation Palestinians deported by Israel from the occupied West
Bank and Gaza for ties with the PLO.
   ``The Palestinian delegation should be a non-PLO delegation
representing the people in the (occupied) territories and not
people active outside the territories,'' Peres said.
   He replied with a terse ``yes'' when asked if deportees included
people who were not PLO members and were not implicated in
terrorist acts.
   The PLO has insisted on playing a role in the peace process, on
forming the Palestinian delegation and on being seen to do so.
Israel refuses to deal with the PLO, dismissing its members as
terrorists.
   In outlining his concept of the delegation, Peres said it should
be free to consult with any Arabs since ``it is not made up of
Israeli citizens but of Jordanians.''
   He did not elaborate. The West Bank was under Jordan's control
and Gaza was under Egypt's before Israel conquered them in the 1967
Middle East War. Peres always has viewed Jordan as a principal
partner in peace talks, and Shamir contends that Jordan is the
Palestinian homeland.
   On the agenda of the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue, Peres hinted
at a possible compromise. He suggested that participants could
address any subject in opening statements but confine themselves
subsequently to discussion of Israeli-proposed Palestinian
elections in the West Bank and Gaza. The polling would be to choose
negotiators on limited interim autonomy.
   ``Once we have agreed that the heart of the agenda will be
arranging the elections in the territories, the opening speech or
speeches are becoming of secondary consideration,'' Peres said.
   Shamir wants the agenda restricted to the mechanics of
elections. The PLO and Egypt, acting on the organization's behalf,
say other subjects can be raised, and the United States agrees with
that view.
   He urged Syria, which lost its Golan Heights to Israel in 1967,
to join in the process and expressed willingness to meet with
Syria's president, Hafez Assad, in Egypt, the only Arab state at
peace with Israel.

   David Rothenberg will never forgive
his father for setting him on fire, saying Wednesday's release of
the man who disfigured him leaves him terrified despite
unprecedented measures to keep the felon away.
   ``I would like them to keep him in jail for the rest of his
life,'' David, 13, told reporters 15 hours after Charles
Rothenberg, 49, was released from prison.
   David told a news conference at the Buena Park Police Department
that he feared Rothenberg may someday harm him. Asked when he
thought he would feel safe, he said, ``When Charles dies.''
   ``Obviously, he is very concerned and he has every reason to
be,'' state Department of Corrections spokesman Tipton Kindel said
in Sacramento.
   Charles Rothenberg, wearing blue jeans, a blue chambray shirt
and an electronic leash to monitor his movements during three
years' probation, ``was escorted out of the prison by motor
vehicle'' at 12:40 a.m., said Kindel.
   ``He is out on parole and he has reached his destination,'' the
spokesman said, declining to even disclose whether Rothenberg was
paroled within the United States. ``He said he was afraid and
upset, but he didn't elaborate.''
   David, whose face bears severe scars from the burning as well as
from repeated skin graft surgery and whose fingers have been
amputated to the first joint, wore a Los Angeles Raiders ball cap
and sat on a telephone book to see over a bank of microphones at
the news conference.
   ``I want it known nationally that I don't ever want to see my
father again. I want to make it clear to him,'' he said.
   ``I think he's a sick man. I can't see why he did this to his
own son,'' said the boy, who was 6 years old when his father set
him on fire in a Buena Park motel room in 1983.
   David expressed fear in an earlier interview, and said he keeps
a BB gun by his bed just in case. ``I'd shoot his eye out if he
ever came over. I'd blind him,'' he said. ``I will never forgive
him.''
   David lives in Orange County with his mother, Marie, and
stepfather, Buena Park police Lt. Richard Hafdahl, who helped
investigate the fire. ``He has nightmares that his dad is chasing
him down the street,'' Hafdahl said.
   Asked what is being done to protect David, Kindel said that if
Rothenberg is ever ``not where he's supposed to be, then the
family, David, will be notified immediately.'' Hafdahl said he's
also taken security measures.
   ``He's under the most restrictive parole ever for a California
parolee,'' Kindel said. ``He will be accompanied by a parole
officer 24 hours a day. We want to make sure that he is where he is
supposed to be and that he has no opportunity to come into contact
with his son.''
   Rothenberg's parole will cost California taxpayers $18,000 a
month.
   Rothenberg set fire to his son after a telephone argument in
which his estranged wife said he would not be able to see David
again.
   Rothenberg had taken the boy on a holiday to Southern California
from New York, where the boy was living with his mother.
   ``If I can't have him, nobody else can,'' Rothenberg said when
arrested six days later. Wearing a lapel pin reading ``Kids are the
nicest people,'' he told arresting officers he was going to kill
himself but was too much of a coward.
   David, dragged from the inferno by motel guests, suffered
third-degree burns over 90 percent of his body.
   Rothenberg was convicted of attempted murder, arson and other
charges and got the maximum penalty, a 13-year prison term. The
sentence was cut in half because of good behavior.
   If convicted today, Rothenberg would have faced up to life in
prison. But sentencing laws at the time required his release after
less than seven years.
   Prison officials tried to keep relocation plans secret, fearing
a repeat of the hysteria surrounding the 1987 release of Larry
Singleton. Singleton, who had raped a teen-ager and left her for
dead after hacking off her forearms with an ax, had to be moved
repeatedly from Northern California communities, where he was
rejected by an outraged public.

<HEAD>Agrarian Party Asks Interim Government in Bulgaria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agrarian Party, for more than 40
years a pawn of Bulgaria's Communists, on Wednesday proposed an
interim government of national consensus that would hold free
elections, the state news agency BTA reported.
   The Communist-dominated reformist government meanwhile said it
will hand Parliament an economic reform program Thursday designed
to lay the groundwork for a market economy by allowing ``pluralism
of ownership in all its forms.''
   The government wants Bulgaria's first free elections since World
War II to be held in May. The opposition has requested most of the
voting for Parliament be delayed until November to give itself time
to develop campaign strategies.
   The Agrarian Party, a member of the governing coalition in the
National Assembly, or parliament, has tried to distance itself from
the Communists as elections approach.
   The National Assembly voted this month to abolish the
Communists' guaranteed monopoly on power, setting the stage for an
end to 42 years of authoritarian, one-party rule.
   On Tuesday, Justice Minister Svetla Daskalova, an Agrarian
leader, asked that any reference to Bulgaria as a ``socialist
state'' be deleted from the constitution.
   On Wednesday, the Agrarian Party's ruling council passed a
motion calling for a ``broad-based, provisional government of
national consensus'' made up of all factions now engaged in talks
here, BTA reported.
   The talks among the Communists, the 12-party opposition Union of
Democratic Forces, and other political and social groups are aimed
at achieving national consensus on the speed and sweep of
democratization in Bugaria.
   The Agrarian motion will be submitted to the National Assembly
and the next session of talks, BTA said.
   The Communist leadership has agreed to an opposition newspaper
and office space, but balks at giving the opposition access to
radio and television _ a must for propagating democratic ideas and
gaining electoral support in this largely rural nation.
   As proposed by the Agrarian Party, a government of national
consensus would arrange free elections and move to remedy
Bulgaria's economic crisis, aggravated by a foreign debt of up to
$12 billion.
   Such an interim government would speed Bulgaria's economic
integration with the outside world and its affiliation with
Western-oriented world economic organizations, like the
International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, BTA reported.
   BTA said the government's economic plan would attempt to bolster
Bulgaria's financial situation by cutting capital investments and
administrative expenditures, acting to increase the strength of
banks and the credit system.
   Further details were not available, such as a timetable for
transforming Bulgaria's highly centralized communist economy into a
market economy.
   The Union of Democratic Forces says Western aid is vital to
conquer the economic crisis here and that it must be used for
radical economic reforms.
   UDF Chairman Zhelyu Zhelev said on TV Wednesday that without
economic reform, ``we can find ourselves in the same situation as
before, when aid disappeared like water into sand,'' according to
BTA.
   ``Economic aid should be associated with democratization. If
there is no such link, the past can make a comeback.''
   Zhelev denied the opposition is out to defeat the Communist
Party.
   ``We are against the monopoly of the Communist Party, not
against the party itself. In a law-abiding, democratic, multiparty
state there will be room for the Commmunist Party and for all other
political parties as well,'' he said.
   The reforms that coursed Eastern Europe last fall swept out
Todor Zhivkov as Bulgaria's Communist ruler on Nov. 10 after 35
years in power.

<HEAD>U.N. Official: European Reforms Shouldn't Divert Development Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY CHENAULT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reforms in Eastern Europe should not
divert aid from Third World countries and eventually could provide
additional resources to underdeveloped nations, a U.N. official
said Wednesday.
   Enrique ter Horst, assistant secretary-general for development
and international economic cooperation, said at a news conference
that changes in Eastern Europe are requiring large amounts of
resources ``necessary for them to get out of their present
quandry.''
   But he said U.N. officials believe problems facing developing
countries remain the most important concerns in efforts toward
international economic development.
   ``It is to be expected, since these countries do have a large
pool of well-trained professionals and technicians, that they
should be on their feet economically speaking relatively quickly,''
the U.N. official said of the Eastern European nations.
   ``We hope that they will be able also to provide markets for
commodities from developing countries ... and also join the Western
developed countries in providing official development assistance
for countries, mainly in Africa, which need it.''
   A U.N. report on economic development released Wednesday said
world economic growth and the average increase in per capita income
in the 1980s were the lowest in three decades.
   According to the report, developing countries have suffered the
most because of the decline in growth, with many people there worse
off in 1990 than they were in 1980.
   Some developing countries in Asia, however, achieved steady
income increases the past decade. The report cited China and India,
the two most populous low-income countries, as having improved
their economic conditions during the 1980s.
   But many countries, particularly in Africa and Latin America,
experienced a collapse in commodity prices the past decade while
facing mounting indebtedness, inadequate funds from foreign sources
and falling income levels, the report said.
   In addition, increased protectionism eroded trade for the
developing countries, the report said.
   ``Particular attention should be given to commodity-dependent
economies who are already under pressure as a result of their
structural rigidities, debt-servicing difficulties and the
inadequacy of development finance. International financial flows to
developing countries are regarded as an important catalytic device
in the development process,'' the report said.
   The United Nations will convene a special session on economic
development on Feb. 26.

   Heavy rain doused the lower Mississippi Valley on Wednesday,
snow fell from Michigan to the Dakotas and rain showers stretched
from Texas to the East Coast and over the northern Pacific Coast.
   The showers and thunderstorms that began Tuesday and continued
Wednesday dropped heavy rain on Louisiana and Mississippi. In 24
hours up to 6 a.m. CST, 2.11 inches of rain fell on Lake Charles,
La., and 1.45 fell on McComb, Miss.
   Light snow or show showers fell from Upper Michigan to Nebraska
and the Dakotas, and heavy snow was predicted through Thursday for
southeastern Wisconsin and northwestern Illinois.
   Rain showers developing ahead of a cold front extended from
eastern Texas to the southern Appalachians and the middle Atlantic
Coast, with a few thunderstorms over eastern Texas and the central
Gulf Coast states.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at noon CST
included 1.46 inches in Meridian, Miss., 1.18 inches in Montgomery,
Ala., and .94 inch in Jackson, Miss.
   Rain was expected to spread across the Tennessee Valley and the
Northeast through Thursday. Flash flood watches were issued for
much of southeastern Tennessee for Wednesday night and for eastern
New York state for Thursday and Thursday night.
   Light rain showers also fell over New England. Fog lingered over
some central California valleys early in the afternoon, but
otherwise sunny skies prevailed across the southwestern quarter of
the nation.
   Strong winds accompanied the rain showers on the northern
Pacific Coast. Gale warnings were in effect for the Washington
coast and much of the coast of Oregon.
   Strong winds also blew over parts of Southern California, much
of the Great Plains, parts of Wyoming, western Pennsylvania and
western New York state.
   The low for the Lower 48 states Wednesday morning was 6 degrees
below zero in Truckee, Calif.

<HEAD>Struggling Latin Countries to Have Less Foreign Financing</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-UN-Economic Development</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Latin American countries will have to rely
less on foreign borrowing as they try to rebuild their economies
from the debt crisis of the 1980s, World Bank President Barber
Conable said Wednesday.
   ``Except possibly in Eastern Europe, no group of nations is
facing such a daunting task of reform and reconstruction'' as Latin
America, Conable said in a speech at the Colegio de Mexico, a
graduate school and think-tank.
   To recover, countries will have to shrink the size of government
bureaucracies that expanded from the Fifties through last decade
into financing, industry, infrastructure, social services and
security _ as well as increasing their foreign borrowings, Conable
said.
   ``We have learned from the experience of developing countries
and socialist countries of Eastern Europe that excessively
centralized economic management leads to such inefficiencies that
ultimately economic development comes to a halt,'' he said.
   In Brazil today, he said, salaries of public employees and
interest on the domestic debt take up 90 percent of public sector
revenue, leaving little for investment or public services.
   The World Bank will continue to participate in Latin American
development, he said, but countries should look to direct foreign
private investment to replace some of the public borrowing.
   ``The channels for the flow of commercial capital to developing
countries have been damaged by the debt crisis,'' he said.
``External capital will no longer flow in quantities and with the
ease with which it was available in the '70s. And even if it did,
developing countries should not borrow as they did in the '70s.''
   Three Latin countries head the list of developing countries that
owe foreign debtors the most _ Brazil, then Mexico and Argentina.
   He said Latin America and Africa had been most severely hit by
the crisis.
   ``More developing countries have suffered reverses in the past
decade than have experienced success.''
   Conable called Mexico's economic reform program ``one of the
most ambitious, courageous and determined'' recently undertaken by
any country and said it could serve as an example for other Latin
nations.
   To bring foreign and domestic debt under control and rein in
runaway inflation, Mexico has reduced subsidies, lifted trade
barriers and restrictions on foreign investment, begun selling off
state-owned companies and is applying wage-and-price controls.
   On Feb. 4, the government plans to renegotiate about half of its
$96 billion foreign debt that is held by commercial banks.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ An attempt by soldiers to clear up
the capital's congested streets created confusion and panic
Wednesday as motorists, pedestrians and peddlers fled the downtown
commercial district.
   Shopkeepers rolled down their steel shutters and street hawkers
bundled up their wares and vanished. By 4 p.m. the normally
bustling downtown district was nearly empty, witnesses said.
   Police Lt. Jean Zamor said on state television Wednesday night
that soldiers using loudspeakers told street vendors at an open-air
market to get off the street by 3 p.m. because they were blocking
traffic.
   Zamor said police acted in the community's interest and blamed
the panic on ``ill-intentioned'' people.
   Rumors and confusion have spread and anxiety has risen since all
independent radio stations ceased broadcasting local news reports
Tuesday after the military government told them they could only
broadcast officially approved news. Radio is the main source of
news in impoverished Haiti.
   Also on Wednesday, armed plainclothes police placed prominent
businessman Antoine Izmery on a commercial flight and sent him into
exile to Miami, a relative said. Izmery arrived in Miami about 7:30
p.m. EST.
   The relative, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press two carloads of armed police escorted Izmery to
planeside at Port-au-Prince International Airport and he was put on
a Haiti Trans Air jet.
   Izmery, a major importer, was arrested Tuesday. He was a
proponent of democracy, an executive member of the Chamber of
Commerce and Industry and a vocal crtic of the military government
of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.
   The U.S. State Department on Wednesday called ``outrageous and
indefensible'' Haiti's expulsion of democratic opposition leaders
and other measures to silence dissent.
   Avril's government declared a 30-day state of siege Saturday,
beat and arrested dozens of opposition militants, and exiled seven
prominent civic and political leaders and other critics after
mystery gunmen killed an army colonel Friday night.
   The Chamber of Commerce and Industry denounced the crackdown in
a statement Wednesday and urged Avril to ``appeal to reason,''
complaining, ``Rights are no longer protected.''
   ``We are not politicians. We are businessmen and concerned
citizens defending fundamental human rights,'' Chamber President
Ludovic Louisdhon told The AP. ``Banishment is a crime against
humanity.''
   Critics accused Avril of using the killing of Col. Andre Neptune
as an excuse to arrest and exile opponents and renege on his
promise to hold free elections in October.
   More than 50 political leaders and militants were arrested over
the weekend. Most said they were released after being beaten, but
at least seven opponents were banished.
   Those exiled included prominent conservative Hubert de Ronceray;
Dr. Louis Roy, considered the father of Haiti's constitution;
Communist party deputy leader Max Bourjolly and leftist militants
Abby Brun, Michel Legros and Max Montreuil.

<TEXT>
   Florida's ``Black Widow'' got a
permanent stay from the state Supreme Court Wednesday, less than 20
hours before she was to die in the electric chair.
   The reprieve given to Judi Buenoano, condemned for the fatal
poisoning of her husband 19 years ago, is good for the rest of her
death warrant. The court said it will schedule briefs and arguments
later this week.
   Only one woman has been executed in the United States since the
U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty 13 years ago. In
1984, Velma Barfield died by injection in North Carolina for
poisoning her boyfriend.
   Ms. Buenoano, nicknamed the ``Black Widow'' by prosecutors, was
under her first death warrant. None of the 21 men electrocuted in
Florida since the state reinstated capital punishment have died
under a first warrant.
   It is up to Gov. Bob Martinez to decide whether a second warrant
is signed, but he is not expected to act until the state Supreme
Court decides whether to grant Ms. Buenoano a second trial.
   Attorneys for Ms. Buenoano filed a notice of appeal with the
high court Wednesday morning after the Orlando judge who sentenced
her to death in 1985 refused to stay the execution late Tuesday.
   Ms. Buenoano, 46, was sentenced to death for the murder of her
husband, Air Force Sgt. James E. Goodyear, soon after he returned
from service in Vietnam.
   Goodyear's body was exhumed more than a decade after his death
when officials began investigating a car bombing in Pensacola. Ms.
Buenoano was convicted of that 1983 bombing, in which she was
accused of trying to kill boyfriend John Gentry after he stopped
taking poison-filled vitamin capsules.
   The levels of arsenic examiners found in Goodyear's body
indicated he had suffered chronic exposure to the poison. Ms.
Buenoano changed her name to a Spanish approximation of Goodyear
after her husband's death.
   Ms. Buenoano was also found guilty of killing her 19-year-old
paralyzed son, Michael Goodyear, by pushing him overboard during a
1980 canoe trip.
   Ms. Buenoano received life sentences for both of those crimes.
She is suspected, but has not been charged, of using arsenic to
kill a common-law husband in Trinidad, Colo., in 1977.
   In each case, Ms. Buenoano collected or stood to collect
thousands of dollars in life insurance benefits.
   Ms. Buenoano was transferred from her death row cell in Broward
Correctional Institution west of Fort Lauderdale to a special
``death watch'' cell in Florida State Prison Monday, spokesman Bob
Macmaster said Tuesday.

<HEAD>Parliamentary Committee Approves Deadline Extension</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament's foreign affairs committee
approved a bill Wednesday calling for a six-month extension on the
May deadline for the United States to dismantle its military
installations in Greece.
   Under the terms of a defense accord that expired in December
1988, the United States has until May 21 to remove personnel,
property and materiel from four major bases and several smaller
installations unless a new agreement is reached.
   The proposed new deadline for dismantling the bases is Nov. 21.
The full Parliament will debate the bill on Monday, state ET-1
television said.
   Representatives of the conservative and socialist parties on the
Standing Committee for Foreign Affairs and Defense voted in favor
of the extension requested by the United States so negotiations on
a new defense pact could continue.
   The Communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress, the third
party supporting Premier Xenophon Zolotas' administration, voted
against the bill. It was passed by a simple majority in the
50-member committee.
   The conservatives and socialists hold 276 seats in the
300-member Parliament. The Communists are opposed to the bases but
have said they would not withdraw from the government if a law is
passed postponing the bases' removal.
   The Zolotas administration was appointed after inconclusive
general elections in November.
   New elections are slated for April, leaving the next government
to determine the fate of the bases with the United States.
   A previous five-year Defense and Economic Cooperation Accord
negotiated by the former socialist government and Washington
expired in December 1988. It gave the United States 17 months to
dismantle the bases if no new accord was reached.
   The bases were established in Greece in the mid-1950s.
   After 17 rounds of fruitless negotiations, Athens and Washington
suspended talks before national elections last June. A short-lived
coalition formed by the conservative and Communist parties after
those elections put the issue on hold.
   The socialist government headed by former Premier Andreas
Papandreou had demanded any new defense accord include guarantees
of aid in case of aggression by NATO ally Turkey, which the United
States has been wary of providing.
   Greece and Turkey nearly went to war in March 1987 over disputed
territorial waters in the Aegean Sea.

   A diabetic woman who felt ``God had a
purpose'' for the infant doctors wanted her to abort has taken her
newborn home from the hospital _ but not before both fought a
battle for their lives.
   Deborah Jennings, 22, was warned at an early age never to have
children. When she became pregnant, doctors urged her for the sake
of her health to abort the baby.
   ``The doctors wanted me to get rid of it,'' she said Tuesday as
she and her 8-pound, 9-ounce son, Billy O'Neal, prepared to leave
Spartanburg Regional Medical Center. ``I told them that God had a
purpose for this baby.''
   Diabetic women are more likely than non-diabetic women to give
birth to babies that are stillborn, suffer deformities or weigh
less, said hosptial spokeswoman Debbie Dalhouse. Also, pregnancy
puts a great deal of stress on a diabetic woman, her insulin level
may fluctuate widely, and she is more likely to suffer
complications during pregnancy and delivery.
   During Miss Jennings' pregnancy, she was hospitalized six times,
once for more than two weeks.
   When she went into labor Jan. 16, some amniotic fluid escaped
and blocked one of her blood vessels, resulting in cardiac arrest.
Her heart stopped for four minutes.
   As one team of doctors worked to resuscitate Miss Jennings,
another delivered the baby by Cesarean section. The medical staff
forced oxygen into the infant's lungs for five minutes until the
baby began breathing on his own.
   Although Miss Jennings's heart eventually began beating again,
the new mother lay in a coma, suspended between life and death.
Doctors didn't give the family much hope.
   ``They told us if she didn't respond in 48 hours, she would
never respond,'' said Betty Jennings, Miss Jennings' mother.
   For Miss Jennings, the two days were a nightmare. From within
her motionless body she could feel and hear, even see, but she
could not respond.
   ``I could hear everybody talking,'' she said. ``You could hear
what they were saying, but you couldn't respond. No matter what you
did, you couldn't respond.''
   Throughout the ordeal, nurses would ask Miss Jennings to show
some sign of life _ squeeze a hand, raise an eyebrow, respond in
some way. Inside, Miss Jennings said, ``I was squeezing her hand,
talking to her, hollering at her, but it wasn't coming out. I was
scared that they were going to bury me alive because I wasn't
responding the way they wanted me to.''
   A day after the delivery, a nurse came in with her newborn,
Billy. ```Debbie, look, here's your little boy,''' Miss Jennings
recalled her saying. ``I started crying. I thought, `That's my
little man.'''
   Then came the moment when Miss Jennings realized how close she
was to death. A cousin _ a Baptist preacher _ had come in to the
room and knelt beside the woman to pray with her.
   ``I felt a part of my body leave me,'' Miss Jennings said. ``It
was like a shield being over me. It's like the Lord held out his
arms for me.''
   But Miss Jennings fought to stay alive. ``I'm not a person to
let go easily,'' she said.
   On Jan. 18, a nurse was telling Miss Jennings just how beautiful
Billy was. As in the past, the nurse asked the young woman to
signal if she could hear. This time, Miss Jennings raised her
eyebrows.
   ``When I saw her I felt such a relief,'' Mrs. Jennings said of
her first visit with her daughter after she had awakened. ``My
heart was so full it felt like it would burst.''
   By that afternoon, Miss Jennings was off her ventilator. On
Saturday, she was transferred to the obstetrics unit. Billy was
transferred on Monday out of the neonatal intensive care unit _
where doctors had stabilized his blood sugar levels _ into the
regular baby nursery.
   Around the halls of Spartanburg Regional, the medical staff
refer to Miss Jennings and Billy as ``our two little miracles,''
head nurse Cathy Askew said.
   Holding her alert, black-haired son, Miss Jennings said Billy is
worth the hardship, but she won't have another child.
   ``Now I'm able to go home and take care of my little one,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Government Says It Will Permit Relief Airlift to South Sudan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Wednesday it will
allow international relief organizations to airlift food supplies
to war-ravaged areas of southern Sudan.
   Information Minister Ali Shummo said the government had
authorized relief organizations to airlift 5,000 tons of food
donated by the European Economic Community from Nairobi, Kenya, to
Juba, the capital of south Sudan.
   He said the government has also given permission to the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to airlift relief
supplies to government-held Juba and areas controlled by the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   ``The concerned authorities have authorized the ICRC to ferry
reief materials to Juba area and even to those areas where the
rebels are present if it (the ICRC) wanted to do so,'' Shummo said
in a statement distributed by the official Sudan News Agency.
   The government suspended relief flights to south Sudan last
August to guarantee the safety of relief workers after the collapse
of a cease-fire in fighting between the government and rebel forces
that took up arms in 1983 to demand greater autonomy and economic
reforms.
   Shummo said preparations are underway to move a trainload of
1,500 tons of sorghum from Muglad in the south to Aweil in the Bahr
Al Ghazal region.
   He said the relief train will operate flying the U.N. flag and
will distribute part of its supplies at rebel-held areas.
   In New York, a U.N. official familiar with relief operations in
south Sudan said meanwhile that heightened fighting in the region
is interrupting attempts to move in supplies that agencies expect
will be needed by June.
   He stressed that famine conditions haven't developed there yet.
But relief workers want to have the supplies in place before the
rainy season, which would prevent moving them when they will be
needed.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Sudan
could face the same kind of famine situation it encountered in 1987
and 1988, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of
people.
   However, a spokesman for the U.S. Agency for International
Development said workers in Sudan had not received reports that
movement of relief supplies had been interrupted by fighting.

<HEAD>Five Officers Indicted in Separate Drug Cases</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal indictment Wednesday charged three police
officers and four other men with robbing more than $1 million in
cash, 110 pounds of cocaine and a ton of marijuana from drug
dealers.
   A separate indictment charged two other officers in a cocaine
case.
   The cases mark the widest-ranging police corruption indictments
since 15 Miami police officers were charged in a drug-ripoff ring
in 1984 and 1985.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen, speaking at a news conference
after the indictments were unsealed, said the defendants arranged
for the transfer of honest officers to other assignments as they
engaged in ripping off drug dealers of cash, cocaine and marijuana
between 1981 and 1987.
   ``They would come into the possession of information about where
drug dealers were, where illegal drugs were, and should have
engaged in proper law enforcement activities,'' Lehtinen said.
   ``Instead they would steal the drugs, engage in what in the
street might be called a ripoff and subsequently resell those
drugs,'' he said.
   Some of the ripoffs were allegedly committed by officers serving
search warrants and others during traffic stops. A list of 39 acts
mentioned thefts of $415,000 cash from a Dade County home in late
1982, $25,000 cash and $15,000 cash.
   The indictment alleges the men stole a total of $1.09 million,
more than 50 kilos of cocaine and 2,000 pounds of marijuana while
the ring was in operation.
   One of the officers, Ernesto Sanchoyerto, was convicted in 1989
for stealing drugs during a traffic stop and is now serving a
17-year federal prison term.
   Sanchoyerto, a former sheriff's deputy, faces another 50 years
in jail if convicted on Wednesday's indictments.
   Also named in the indictment were Maj. Roberto Gonzalez, a
department chief; his brother Detective Jose Gonzalez; and
Detective Mario Beovides. Three businessmen, one of whom also was a
former sheriff's deputy, were also named.
   The officers and businessmen face maximum sentences from 30
years to life in jail, and fines of $250,000 to $4.5 million, if
convicted.
   Another grand jury indictment charged patrolman Edward Orrett
with conspiracy and intent to distribute cocaine. His brother,
Detective Charles Orrett, was charged with attempting to possess
five kilos of cocaine.

   Chinese students in exile watched
Wednesday's showdown between President Bush and Congress over
legislation concerning their asylum here, arguing the bill offers
extra protection they need.
   ``People here want to make sure they stay here safely,'' said An
Wei, a Chinese national who works at the Chinese Student
Information Center in Newton. Many students were anxious about the
prospect of being sent back to China, where they faced probable
political reprisals, he said.
   The House voted 390-25 Wednesday to override Bush's veto of a
measure eliminating requirements that Chinese students return to
their homeland before applying for a new U.S. visa. The matter now
moves to the Senate, where a scheduled Thursday vote is expected to
be a cliffhanger.
   Pei Min Xin, who was a leader of the pro-democracy protests in
Beijing last spring, said he has learned that his name is on a
blacklist in China.
   If he was forced to return, he would face life imprisonment or
execution, said Pei. He said he felt disillusioned by the
president's actions regarding China, which has included sending two
advisers there in the past year.
   ``How can the leader of the United States be so accommodating to
people back in our own country, who tried to kill us all off, to
stamp out our legitimate demands for political change?'' said Pei,
a Harvard University graduate student in government.
   By trying to not offend the current regime, Bush also was
putting America behind a losing bet, he said.
   ``It is unlikely that regime will survive five years from now,''
Pei said. ``I can predict that 20 years from now people like us
will be running the Chinese government. Are you going to deal with
people in power now, or the future leaders?''
   Pei holds a visa common to many of the students who fled to the
United States after the Chinese government cracked down on the
pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in June. Under the
visa's requirements, bearers must return to China when their visas
expire and live there for two years before they can apply for a new
one.
   President Bush said the bill to eliminate that requirement,
which he vetoed in November, was unnecessary because he had signed
an administrative order allowing Chinese students to stay in the
United States.
   Bush also said the measure could damage U.S. relations with
China, which has condemned the legislation.
   Chinese students said the override was crucial because an
administrative order was not as solid as a law. The process of
revoking an order is easier, and could happen at any time if the
situation changes, they said.
   ``People would feel a lot more secure if they're staying here
because of a law,'' An said.
   Even those students who were not a part of the democracy
movement would come under suspicion in China because of their
Western education, said An, who came to the United States in 1985.
   Pei said Bush made a mistake of moral and strategic importance
when he urged lawmakers to sustain his veto and vote against the
override.
   He was disappointed and saddened by the president's actions, Pei
said.
   ``We invest a great deal of hope in the American system of
government, in its ideals, in human rights, and now we are being
taught a very cruel and cynical lesson,'' Pei said. ``The leaders
of a great democracy are viewing other interests as more important
than ideals.''

   Defense Minister Italo Luder
resigned Wednesday because President Carlos Menem sided with the
army chief of staff in a dispute over whether the general bypassed
Luder's authority.
   ``I gave the president my undeclinable resignation'' the
73-year-old lawyer and career politician told reporters.
   Humberto Romero, a former aide to Menem who resigned six months
ago and is an elected member of the national assembly, was named
new defense minister, presidential spokesman Humberto Toledo said
late Wednesday. Romero will assume office Friday, Toledo said.
   Analysts said Luder's resignation was more a reflection of his
poor standing with Menem than of problems within the armed forces.
   He was the unsuccessful Peronist candidate for president in 1983
and backed Menem's opponent in the party primary last year. After
Menem won the presidency in May and Luder became defense minister,
he was forced to accept Gen. Isidro Caceres as army chief instead
of the general he wanted.
   ``Luder never has been close to Menem and he has never gotten
along particularly well with Caceres,'' Rosendo Fraga, director of
a center-right think tank, said in an interview.
   His departure illustrates the fragility of the alliance Menem is
building for his program of selling money-losing state companies,
deregulation, tax reform and encouraging foreign investment at a
time of recession, high unemployment and double-digit monthly
inflation.
   Four of Menem's Cabinet ministers have quit or been moved to
other departments in five weeks. Since the president took office in
July, the Central Bank has had four presidents and various policies
on exchange rates, the money supply and subsidies to private
businesses.
   Trouble began at the Defense Ministry with a dinner Caceres gave
at an army base for Menem, new Interior Minister Julio Mera
Figueroa and Juan Yofre, chief of the government intelligence
service.
   Because he was not invited, Luder felt he was being bypassed in
the chain of command.
   ``I was in the city (but) I was not informed about the dinner,''
he said in comments broadcast by Radio Mitre, and Caceres' failure
to invite him ``merits punishment.''
   Neither Luder nor Menem disclosed the punishment chosen, but
merely the fact of its being ordered by the defense minister would
have forced Caceres to retire.
   Menem told reporters Wednesday: ``I think Dr. Luder did not have
full knowledge of the facts.
   ``I don't want to hurt the feelings of Dr. Luder, but it seems
to me inappropriate that the president and commander in chief of
the armed forces learns about such a sanction through the media.''
   Any question involving the military is sensitive in this South
American country, which has suffered six coups since 1930. The
50,000-man army is the strongest branch and wields influence on a
level with the Roman Catholic church, labor and organizations of
farmers, ranchers, businessmen and banks.
   Menem's predecessor, Raul Alfonsin of the Radical Civic Union,
had to put down three barracks mutinies that threatened the return
to democracy that began with his election victory over Luder in
1983.
   Menem, 59, tried for national reconciliation in October by
pardoning dozens of officers still facing trial for human rights
abuses in the last dictatorship, along with alleged leftist
subversives and about 200 army rebels.
   In recent weeks, Caceras noted poor military pay _ an army
private earns about $42 a month _ and recommended the release from
prison of four former commanders of military juntas that ruled
Argentina in 1976-83.
   Jorge Videla and Roberto Viola, generals who were junta
presidents, were convicted of committing rights abuses during the
``dirty war'' against leftists, in which at least 8,960 people
disappeared and were presumed killed.
   Menem excluded them from his pardon, along with two other
officers convicted at the same time and Mario Firmenich, the
Montonero guerrilla leader who was convicted of murder and is
serving 30 years in prison.

   The president of North Yemen on Wednesday
called on President Bush to urge Israel to allow self-determination
for the Palestinians living in occupied Israeli territory.
   ``You are fully aware of the suffering of Palestinians who wish
to see an end to occupation and to live free on their land,''
President Ali Abdullah Saleh said in arrival remarks with President
Bush on the White House South Lawn.
   Both Bush and Saleh expressed hopes about the prospects for the
decade-old move to unify North Yemen with Marxist South Yemen.
   ``I look forward to receiving President Saleh's views on ... the
prospects for improving relations between the two Yemens and the
importance of these developments for regional peace and
stability,'' Bush said in welcoming Saleh, the first North Yemini
president to visit Washington.
   Later, at a state dinner, Bush called Saleh's visit ``an
opportunity to assure you of America's commitment to security in
the Middle East and to the pursuit of a just and lasting peace in
the region.''
   Bush, who visited North Yemen in 1986 as vice president, praised
Saleh as ``a man of extraordinary accomplishment'' who ``has led
his country at a time of great economic progress and is responsible
for Yemen's growing role in Middle Eastern affairs.''
   Saleh said he hoped ``to establish closer linkage between the
very ancient in our country and the most modern in yours.''
   The White House said the two presidents in their private meeting
agreed to work for a solution to Middle East peace and discussed
efforts to reunify North and South Yemen, as well as the situation
in Afghanistan ``and our shared support for self-deterination for
the Afghan people.''
   Calling the United States ``a nation which advocates with
conviction the respect of human rights throughout the world,''
Saleh said he wanted to remind Americans ``about the fate of the
rights of Palestinian Arabs and their occupied territory,'' which
has been under Israeli control since the 1967 Six Day War.
   ``Despite all the suffering, we trust that the United States of
America ... will be able to convince the Israelis to accept peace
initiatives and to abide by international decisions which give the
Palestinians the right to self-determination under the leadership
of their sole and legitimate representative, the Palestine
Liberation Organization,'' he said in his arrival remarks.
   The United States does not recognize the PLO as the sole
representative of the Palestinians and only agreed to talk to PLO
officials in the last two years.
   Saleh also told Bush that his country is working on unification
with South Yemen ``in a democratic and peaceful way.''
   He was expected to press Bush during their private meeting to
restore relations with South Yemen, a Soviet ally.
   Recent reforms in South Yemen revived the effort to unify north
and south, with the two countries agreeing this week to prepare a
joint constitution for a referendum by Nov. 30.
   U.S. officials have said the administration is considering
restoring diplomatic ties with South Yemen, which is one of six
countries under U.S. economic boycott for their support of
international terrorism. The others are Libya, Cuba, North Korea,
Syria and Iran.
   Washington has had diplomatic relations with North Yemen since
1946, and has provided large amounts of development aid and
military assistance.
   South Yemen, a British protectorate until it gained independence
in 1967, broke with the United States when it aligned with Moscow.
   Located at the tip of the Red Sea, it became a major facility
for Soviet naval units in the Indian Ocean.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering met with the representative of
South Yemen at the United Nations several times last fall to
discuss renewing relations, a U.S. official, speaking on condition
of anonyity, told reporters.

<HEAD>Arthur Miller Accuses Theater in U.S. of Being Superficial</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS graf 4 with correct name of play `The Price.' Picks up
5th, `The issue...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Playwright Arthur Miller, in London for rehearsals
of his play ``The Price'' that opens next month, accused U.S.
theater Wednesday of being superficial.
   Contrasting unsubsidized theater in the United States with the
state-aided British theater, Miller said American theater has often
degenerated into a search for titillating ways to fill unsubsidized
and expensive seats.
   ``Theaters in the States are finding it very difficult to
continue because they feel they have got to constantly excite
audiences in a most superficial way,'' the 74-year-old playwright
told reporters.
   Speaking during a break in rehearsals for ``The Price'' at the
Young Vic theater, he said standards in British theater could fall
if subsidies were reduced or stopped.
   The issue is a hot topic in Britain, where Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's government is accused by critics of starving
state-aided theaters and other arts of sufficient public funding.
Her Conservative government favors funding of the arts by private
business sponsorship.
   Miller, one of America's best known playwrights with works like
``Death of a Salesman'' and ``The Crucible,'' said:
   ``In Britain, the only reason you have not gone up the flue is
that there are some subsidies for major theaters in many parts of
the country. If that stops or goes down sufficiently you will be
thrown on to the market and that cannot support theater because
costs are too high.''
   He said unsubsidized American seat prices made an evening at the
theater so expensive that general audiences would not go unless a
critic said the production was a masterpiece, even if the critic
was wrong.
   Miller said that meant theater audiences in the United States
have become a self-serving clique and that the plays appear
tailored to match the audience.
   ``If the British cease or cut down subsidies you are going to
lose everything and the first thing will be American tourists who
come here (to London) to see subsidized theater and then go home
and vote against it,'' he said.
   Referring to Czechoslovakia's new president, former imprisoned
dissident and playwright Vaclav Havel, Miller said: ``The final
resistance to tyranny is culture. It is the writer who cannot give
up his art who shows the regime for what it is.
   ``By some miracle, that is exactly what has happened in
Czechoslovakia where a writer, of all things, generated the
resistance with his irreconcilability to the lies the (former
Communist) system stood on.''
   Havel was named president last month by parliament in Prague.

   Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia said
Wednesday he was quitting again as head of the resistance coalition
battling Cambodia's Vietnamese-backed government.
   The exiled chief of state said his resignation is in protest of
foreign accusations that he is an accomplice in the Communist Khmer
Rouge's drive to regain power in Cambodia. Disputes with his
coalition partners caused him to step down several times before.
   He said he would stop meeting with most foreign diplomats and
reporters and would not attend any international conferences on the
Cambodian situation. Sihanouk said he will run for president if a
political situation is worked out and general elections are held.
   Sihanouk, a non-Communist, has headed a resistance coalition
that also includes the Communist Khmer Rouge and the non-Communist
Khmer People's National Liberation Front.
   The Khmer Rouge, which conducted a reign of terror in Cambodia
from 1975 until early 1979 in which 1 million people died, when it
was ousted by Vietnam, is militarily the strongest of the three
factions.
   The Khmer Rouge has claimed major battle victories since
September, when Vietnam said it pulled the last of its troops from
Cambodia. The victories have raised fears the Khmer Rouge could
rule again.
   Sihanouk always had an uneasy relationship with the Khmer Rouge
but insisted that the only way to contain the group was to include
it in any political settlement.
   In his statement, Sihanouk said he would retain the title of
chief of state of Cambodia that he held before being ousted in a
1970 coup led by the U.S.-backed Lon Nol. He said the Lon Nol
government was illegal and thus his old title is still in effect.
   He said that after several scheduled appointments over the next
few weeks he will stop meeting all foreign officials, diplomats and
journalists. The exceptions are to be his ``friends'' from China
and North Korea, the two countries where he lives most of the year.
   In his statement, Sinhanouk said without elaborating that
``certain governments of the free world'' in addition to
journalists, intellectuals and parliamentarians ``have decided to
attack me and accuse me of complicity with the Khmer Rouge.''
   He did not defend his alliance with the group.
   Sihanouk is still widely revered in his homeland and is believed
to be the one person who could hold the country together.
   Sihanouk has given qualified support to an Australian proposal
to dismantle both the resistance and the Vietnam-installed
government and set up an interim U.N. administration to run the
country and prepare for a general election.
   In another development, a U.N. official said Wednesday that
Khmer Rouge guerrillas moved nearly all the refugees from a United
Nations-aided Borai camp toward the Thai-Cambodian border, closer
to the fighting.
   The Communist fighters apparently wanted to prevent U.N.
officials from transferring them to nearby Site K, a new camp that
is safer and has better medical and other services but is not Khmer
Rouge-controlled.
   Only about 200 refugees remained at Borai Wednesday afternoon,
said Patrick Van de Velde, deputy director of the U.N. Border
Relief Operation, after a visit there.
   Borai originally housed up to 4,500 people, but three-fourths of
them have been moved toward the border since Jan. 15, said an aid
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

   The Food and Drug Administration threatened
legal action Wednesday against an American Heart Association food
labeling program it said could mislead consumers, but the heart
association decided to go ahead with the the program.
   The FDA said in a letter that the food labeling program could be
``risking regulatory action.'' It said there is a ``very real
possibility that the FDA would find one or more foods under your
program to be misbranded,'' meaning they might carry misleading
labels.
   The program, known as Heartguide, is an ambitious effort by the
heart association to make consumers smarter shoppers by identifying
products low in saturated fat, total fat, cholesterol and sodium.
   Products tested and approved by the association, for a fee,
would carry a symbol made up of a red heart and a check mark.
   The FDA has authority to act only after products go on sale. It
can then require that companies change labels. The agency can also
block the sale of improperly labeled items or seize them, said Jeff
Nesbit, an FDA spokesman.
   Vicki Anderson, a spokeswoman for Heartguide, said the program,
scheduled to begin officially Monday, has been under development
for three years. It has been discussed with the FDA throughout the
past year, she said.
   ``We were expecting a letter from the FDA, but we did not
anticipate this,'' she said. Heartguide officials thought the FDA
would take a neutral stance on the program, ``not one where they
would exercise their regulatory jurisdiction.''
   The heart association, however, is proceeding with its launch of
the program Monday. ``We've already talked to the companies''
participating in the program, and ``they are in,'' said another
Heartguide spokeswoman, Jamy Poth.
   More than 100 brands of margarine, oil, crackers and vegetables
already have been tested and approved. They include Mazola corn
oil, Promise margarine, Pam cooking sprays, Melba Toast and Hanover
frozen vegetables.
   However, the next phase of the program, in which cereals,
cheese, cookies, pasta, salad dressings and other foods will be
included, has been put on hold while the heart association
negotiates further with the FDA, Anderson said.
   None of the labeled products in the first phase is currently
available on the shelves. Anderson said manufacturers had begun
printing containers with the labels, but that products were not yet
ready for shipment to supermarkets.
   ``We all knew that something was coming'' from the FDA, said
John Cady, president of the National Food Processors Association,
which has vigorously opposed the program.
   ``What we see here is a realization by the government agencies
that you have a nonprofit, private organization, a nonregulated
organization, trying to establish a set of rules and regulations on
labeling _ for a fee. I think that's wrong.''
   The makers of Mazola products said they had not yet decided how
to react to the FDA's action, said Gail Griffin, spokeswoman for
CPC International of Englewood Cliffs, N.J. That is the parent
company of Best Foods, which makes Mazola.
   The FDA's letter was addressed to heart association President
Dr. Myron L. Weisfeldt of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
Acting Commissioner James S. Benson wrote that the Heartguide
program could ``increase consumer confusion and hamper any
comprehensive solution to the food labeling problem.''
   He invited the heart association ``instead to join with the FDA
and other groups in our current initiative to develop a
comprehensive revision of the food label to promote good nutrition.
...''
   Weisfeldt said in a statement, ``On behalf of the 2.7 million
AHA volunteers across the United States, I want to say we are
deeply disappointed by Mr. Benson's letter, particularly since it
has come just a few days before our program was to begin.'' But, he
said, ``I would like to emphasize that we are not closing down the
Heartguide program.''
   The program has been controversial from its inception. The
National Food Processors Association has opposed the program on the
grounds that it charges a hefty fee _ up to $640,000, depending
upon a product's sales _ and that competitive pressures make it
difficult for eligible companies to refuse to join.
   ``It also opens the door to similar programs by other groups who
want to charge money to food processors for getting their
endorsement,'' said Ellen Morton, a spokeswoman.
   The program has also been criticized on the grounds that it
promotes certain foods instead of promoting the idea of a healthy
overall diet.
   The heart association said its educational program will make
clear that Heartguide-approved foods should be incorporated into a
diet that is beneficial overall.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An industry spokesman said Wednesday that
President Bush has decided to suspend below-cost timber sales from
10 national forests in the fiscal year that will begin Oct. 1.
   Barry Polsky of the American Forest Resource Alliance, which
includes timber companies, sawmills and other enterprises, said the
shutdown will be announced in Bush's budget proposals sent to
Congress next week.
   A spokewoman for Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who was
out of town, referred the question to Agriculture Department budget
director Stephen B. Dewhurst, who declined comment.
   Polsky said the 10 forests in fiscal 1988 harvested 262 million
board feet of timber and provided about 3,000 jobs. Local
communities received $59.8 million as their share of federal
revenue from the timber sales.
   Polsky, in a telephone interview, said that ``preservationists
want to stop timber sales'' of all kinds and have been partially
successful in limited areas where protected species of animals
exist.
   ``In some forests, they can't find a species to protect, so
they've gone after forests that sell timber below costs,'' he said.
   Admittedly, Polsky added, some forests do sell cut-rate timber,
but there's no federal rule against that and national forests, on
the average, do make money for taxpayers.
   But below-cost timber sales are losing practices in specific
forests, so there has been pressure to end the practice, he said.
   Polsky identified 10 national forests which tentatively have
been earmarked for terminated timber sales:
   _Montana, Beaverhead.
   _Colorado, Arapaho-Roosevelt, Pike-San Isabel and White River.
   _Illinois, Shawnee.
   _Indiana, Hoosier.
   _Ohio, Wayne.
   _Virginia, George Washington.
   _Tennessee, Cherokee.
   _Georgia, Chattahoochee-Oconee.

   Japan will deport 378 more Chinese who entered the
country posing as Vietnamese refugees, bringing to 679 the number
to be returned involuntarily to China, the Justice Ministry said
Wednesday.
   Yoshinori Sato, an official of the Immigration Bureau at the
Justice Ministry, said the Chinese to be deported are among 2,804
boat people who made their way to Japan in 22 landings last year.
   The government has determined that about 2,000 are Chinese, Sato
said. Other officials indicated the government intends to deport
all 2,000 as soon as it can work out details with the Chinese
authorities. The government has said the Chinese boat people were
only seeking economic opportunities.
   Sato declined to specify when the 378 will be deported.
   On Dec. 21, Japan deported 301 Chinese who had been classified
as illegal entrants after arriving in Nagasaki from China's Fujian
province posing as Vietnamese refugees.
   Japan began screening boat people in September. It has accepted
4,425 refugees from Vietnam since 1978, whom it deemed to be
fleeing political persecution.

   President Bush expressed hope Wednesday that
Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``not only survives but stays strong'' in the
face of ``enormous'' problems. He declined comment on whether the
Soviet leader has gone too far in trying to quell civil strife in
Azerbaijan.
   ``Anytime you have a use of force and the loss of life, we are
concerned. But I don't believe I can judge that question right
now,'' said Bush of the Soviet crackdown on rioting in the largely
Moslem Soviet republic.
   The president, at a news conference, also announced support for
elevating the Environmental Protection Agency to the Cabinet,
castigated a ``sleight-of-hand'' plan to cut Social Security taxes
and mounted a last-ditch effort to prevent an override of his veto
of a bill protecting Chinese students from deportation.
   Bush conceded it was too late to prevent the House from voting
to override the veto _ as it did, 390-25, late Wednesday. He rested
his hopes on the Senate in trying to avoid the first override in 10
vetoes.
   ``We've got a fighting chance,'' Bush said Wednesday night at a
state dinner for the president of North Yemen.
   Chief of Staff John Sununu predicted that the Senate vote would
be close. ``You never know until it happens,'' he said.
   Earlier Wednesday, Bush argued his case on the China veto to GOP
senators over breakfast at the White House.
   Later, after a meeting there on the EPA, three Republican
senators _ John Chafee of Rhode Island, John Warner of Virginia and
David Durenberger of Minnesota _ predicted the Senate would sustain
Bush's China veto. Asked if Bush already had the 34 votes needed,
Warner said, ``We're closing the gap on that question right now.''
   Bush also presided at a full-dress military welcome for the
president of North Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh, and hailed him as ``a
man of extraordinary accomplishment'' at a state dinner.
   Saleh urged Bush to prod Israel to give Palestinians in the
occupied territories the right of self-determination. Bush assured
his guest of America's commitment ``to security in the Middle East
and to the pursuit of a just and lasting peace.''
   Gorbachev ordered thousands of Soviet troops into Azerbaijan
last week to stop anti-Armenian rioting and restore order. The
military killed dozens of people Saturday in storming the capital
city of Baku. After 11 days of violence, the official death toll
stood at 170.
   With the strife in Azerbaijan and demands for independence from
the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, Bush said
Gorbachev is ``faced with an ethnic problem here and an internal
problem of enormous dimensions.''
   Bush said he ``can't make predictions'' about Gorbachev's
chances of surviving the challenges, but added:
   ``I hope he not only survives but stays strong. Because I think
it is in our interest that perestroika succeed and go forward.''
   The United States regards the Soviet Union's annexation of the
Baltic states a half-century ago as illegal, and Bush said he and
Gorbachev discussed the U.S. position at last month's Malta summit.
   But he said he did not want ``to fine-tune all that,''
emphasizing instead that what ``we want to do is to encourage Mr.
Gorbachev's stand that peaceful change is the order of the day.''
   Bush bristled at the prospect of his veto on the
Chinese-students bill being overridden.
   ``One of the criticisms that gets to me a little ... is the idea
that I don't care about human rights. That is absolutely
ridiculous,'' said the president.
   ``Not one'' student was sent back to China after last June's
government crackdown on demonstrators, he said. ``They were safe
then and they are safe now and they will be safe in the future.''
   He attributed the strong sentiment in Congress to override the
veto both to persuasive lobbying by the students and ``crass
politics'' by lawmakers eager to hand him a defeat.
   He said China took a ``gigantic step back'' last year on human
rights.
   But the onetime China envoy said, ``I think I know enough about
it that in China you get a couple of steps forward and then
somebody steps back.''
   Suggesting China may shut the door to future exchanges, Bush
said, ``The bill is totally unnecessary, the long-term policy
consequences are potentially great and Congress, in my view, will
have only itself to blame.''
   On other topics, Bush:
   _Called Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's idea of a rollback in the
Social Security tax ``a disguise for increased taxes around the
corner.'' He called it ``odd that a Republican president ... is the
one that is protecting the sanctity of the Social Security
benefits.''
   But Bush also said a proposal by conservative House Republicans
to allow workers to shift part of their payroll taxes into private
retirement accounts ``has some interesting ingredients'' and is
worthy of study.
   _Said he ``can't confirm'' reports of deep division within the
Bush family on abortion, denying a magazine account that
disagreement surfaced at a family meeting but stopping short of
saying there is no such division.
   _Said he wants the EPA in his Cabinet because of the magnitude
of environmental problems confronting the United States and the
world.
   _Offered a polite no-thank-you to Czechoslovakia President
Vaclav Havel's offer to have the next Bush-Gorbachev summit in
Prague instead of the United States. But Bush said, ``I was rather
moved by the suggestion.''
   _Said he had not decided how much aid to help ``repair the
wounds'' in Panama from last month's U.S. invasion.
   _Said the new budget, due Monday, will include ``our plan to
restructure America's defenses in the wake of the dramatic changes
that are taking place abroad.''

   A police officer was sentenced Wednesday to seven
years in prison for the deaths of two black men in an incident that
ignited three days of racial violence a year ago.
   William Lozano, 30, was convicted last month on two counts of
manslaughter for fatally shooting an unarmed black motorcyclist on
a street in the Overtown section, sending the vehicle crashing into
a car and killing the motorcycle's passenger.
   ``This court cannot do perfect justice in this case,'' said Dade
Circuit Judge Joseph Farina, who called the deaths and resultant
trial a ``tragic incident.''
   The Colombian-born officer showed little reaction as the judge
read the sentence, but his supporters cheered when Farina said the
officer could remain free on $10,000 bond pending appeals.
   The Jan. 16, 1989, deaths led to the city's fourth round of
racial unrest in the 1980s, all linked to the killings of blacks by
white officers. In two of those cases, acquittals of the policemen
had sparked racial violence, and police braced for renewed rioting
as Lozano's trial neared an end last month. But on Dec. 7, a
racially mixed jury convicted Lozano.
   Police said the city was quiet after Wednesday's sentencing.
   ``Everything is good, there's no disturbance, no nothing,'' said
police spokesman George Law.
   After the sentence, Lozano stared briefly at lead prosecutor
John Hogan, but said nothing.
   Lozano thanked his supporters at a news conference later and
predicted he would be vindicated through appeal.
   ``My attorney, my family and I will continue to fight within the
system for what is right, and at the end, I will win,'' he said.
   Outside the courtroom, Patricia Lloyd, sister of slain
motorcyclist Clement Lloyd, 23, said only: ``I wish it had been
longer.''
   Ray Fauntroy, head of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference here, said he was disappointed with the sentence.
   Blacks ``get seven years just for stealing a loaf of bread,''
Fauntroy said. ``This officer was just given a pat on the back.
He'll be out in two or three years.
   Hogan, who had recommended a 12-year sentence, said he was
satisfied.
   ``It's a just sentence,'' he said.
   Lozano could have faced a punishment of 12 to 17 years under
state sentencing guidelines.
   Lozano and his attorneys left by a back door and did not
immediately speak to waiting reporters. But mostly Hispanic
supporters clapped as they filed out of the courtroom.
   The convicted officer's mother, Haydee Lozano, recounted the
family's struggles in the United States and said her son worked
from the time he was 9 to help the family.
   ``We are not people to destroy, but unite,'' she said through a
translator. ``Leave my son free.''
   Defense attorneys from the beginning bitterly criticized the
case as an effort to ease racial tensions in Miami rather than give
their client a fair trial.
   ``If Officer Lozano was black, he never would have been charged
with a crime. If the two people on the motorcycle were white, he
never would have been charged with a crime,'' defense attorney Mark
Seiden told the judge.
   Earlier, the judge turned aside defense efforts to force a
retrial, dismissing their arguments that the case was replete with
mistakes.
   Defense attorney Roy Black said the judge had unfairly prevented
the defense from challenging a black union official during jury
selection and he said the atmosphere of violence surrounding the
case should have persuaded the judge to move the trial out of tense
Miami.
   Before the sentencing, Lloyd's mother called for justice for her
son. Adina Lloyd praised the conduct of the trial and told the
judge to use his conscience.
   But at one point she turned to Lozano and said: ``If it was my
son that did it to him, my son would be behind bars now.''
   Lozano shot and killed Lloyd as he fled from a police car
pursuing him for running a stop sign. Lloyd's passenger, Allan
Blanchard, 24, died of injuries suffered when the motorcycle
crashed.
   Ellis Rubin, attorney for Blanchard's family, called the trial a
turning point for the community.
   ``For too long in Dade County Florida, the black minority has
felt ignored, felt frustrated, felt there was no equal justice
under the law,'' Rubin said.
   But he said a ``spark was lit'' by the Lozano verdict, telling
the judge ``we ask you not to douse that spark of justice.''
   Police spokesman Sgt. David Rivero described the sentence as
average for someone convicted of manslaughter.
   ``This is a democratic system, and we (police officers) have to
accept that,'' he said of the sentence.

   President Bush is preparing to propose an aid
program for Panama totaling more than $1 billion to help the
country recover from recent warfare and long years of corrupt
military rule, U.S. officials said Wednesday night.
   Congressional leaders were briefed on the program Wednesday and
a formal announcement is expected Thursday, said one official,
asking not to be identified.
   A second senior official, confirming the amount on condition of
anonymity, cautioned, ``Not all of it is new money.''
   About half the program will be in cash and the remainder in
credits, the first official said.
   Aside from development aid, the program will include loan
guarantees and programs to encourage investment, he said.
   The administration hopes that other countries experienced in
foreign aid, including Japan and Western European Countries, will
follow the U.S. lead and make contributions of their own.
   Damage estimates from the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion vary widely,
ranging from a few hundred million dollars to $2 billion or more.
The United States already has released $400 million in Panamanian
assets frozen in the United States in earlier efforts to topple the
regime led by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, ousted in the invasion.
   According to the official, the proposal will will require a
supplemental appropriation by the Congress for a portion of the
money but a sizeable percentage will be paid for in cuts from aid
programs to other countries.
   ``A big chunk will be out of the taxpayers' pockets,'' the
official said, predicting a tough fight in finding the money.
   He said Panama, although a small country of about 2\ million
people, requires substantial aid because successive military
governments, including Noriega's, stole a good portion of the
national treasury.
   The $1 billion, if approved, would make Panama one the largest
recipients of U.S. aid per capita after two years of economic
sanctions that dealt heavy blows to the economy.
   The official disclosed details after President Bush told his
news conference he was determined to ``try to help _ repair the
wounds, repair the damage.''
   ``I mourn the loss of innocent civilians in Panama or anywhere
else,'' Bush said.
   Bush sidestepped the question of compensation for civilian
deaths, saying he was not sure of all details of the planned aid
package.
   Officials have said there was not much sentiment to include
compensation for the families of the more than 200 civilians
killed. The Pentagon estimated 220 civilian deaths, possibly
including some soldiers out of uniform.
   Panamanian officials have put the toll at 202, while some church
groups have put the numbers as high as 1,000.
   Asked what he would say to the Panamanian survivors, Bush said
he would tell them, ``Look, you lost some Panamanian lives.
Innocent life was lost. And yet, 92 percent of the people in Panama
strongly supported the action of the United States. Isn't that
significant?''
   A White House official earlier characterized the aid package as
``very broad,'' covering housing, trade and debt. Panama is in
arrears on its obligations to international lending institutions,
and its total foreign debt amounts to a heavy $534 million.
   The assistance package Bush aides are preparing will include
help for rebuilding homes that were damaged in the Dec. 20
invasion, and ``some kind of multilateral effort to help Panama
with its debt,'' said another official. spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Earlier this week, the White House announced that the Overseas
Private Investment Corp., the federal agency that promotes U.S.
investment abroad, will recruit U.S. businesses to undertake
investment in Panama. OPIC will sponsor a tour of Panama for
business leaders in late February.
   The White House has said there is no money earmarked for Panama
in the 1991 budget that Bush will send to Congress on Monday. Any
supplemental appropriation would apply in the current fiscal year.
   Vice President Dan Quayle could take the specifics of the plan
when he travels to Panama this weekend for talks with the new
government, the White House official said.
   ``We're going to be discussing their requirements and our
resources,'' said Quayle's press secretary, David Beckwith.
   Quayle is traveling to Panama after attending Saturday's
presidential inauguration in Honduras. His mission is to urge
recognition by other governments for the U.S.-installed Panamanian
government and to try to soothe the anger among Latin nations
caused by the invasion.

   A wide range of bills newly introduced in
Congress would cut Social Security taxes, free billions of dollars
for the nation's highways and cash in on the thaw in East-West
relations by cutting Pentagon programs.
   Many of the bills introduced as lawmakers returned to work
Tuesday after their winter recess would address the massive federal
budget deficit and the gimmicks used to disguise the government's
red ink.
   Also introduced were bills that would raise the Environmental
Protection Agency to Cabinet status and allow women to serve in
combat.
   The largest political storm has already formed over Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan's proposal to cut Social Security taxes. Moynihan
was derided by the White House earlier this month when he announced
the plan, which he formally introduced Tuesday.

   A state task force that's been
lampooned as an emporium of New Age buzzwords completed its
three-year mission with a report enshrining self-esteem as a
``social vaccine'' that ``empowers us to live responsibly.''
   Much of the rest of the country may be snickering, but 42 of
California's 58 counties, including conservative rural ones,
already have formed local self-esteem teams.
   In its 144-page final report issued Tuesday, the California Task
Force to Promote Self-Esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility
recommended more parenting courses, smaller school classes and
pro-family worksite policies.
   When the task force was created with the blessing of Republican
Gov. George Deukmejian, it was met with scorn. Cartoonist Garry
Trudeau poked fun in ``Doonesbury,'' having his bubble-headed
character Boopsie named to the task force, which she called ``the
first official study of New Age thinking.''

<HEAD>Swoosie Kurtz Plays Hard-Driving Producer in `The Image'</HEAD>

   When Swoosie Kurtz asked ABC anchorman Peter
Jennings for help preparing for her role as the producer of a TV
newsmagazine show in HBO's ``The Image,'' she didn't know he was a
fan.
   ``When I called him, he said he'd seen me in `The House of Blue
Leaves' on Broadway and I could have anything I want,'' Kurtz said.
   After spending nearly a whole day with the anchorman, she said,
``I went to `PrimeTime Live' and watched Sam Donaldson and Diane
Sawyer do a test show before going on the air. I also went to `60
Minutes' and had a meeting with Don Hewitt, the executive producer.
I'm really playing Don Hewitt in this.''
   In the two-hour movie, making its debut Saturday on Home Box
Office, Kurtz's character, producer Joanne Winslow-Darvish, is
nicknamed ``whirling dervish'' because of her hard-charging manner.
   Albert Finney plays newsmagazine superstar Jason Cromwell,
described in a Time magazine cover story as ``the only man America
really trusts.''
   Behind the facade, however, is a failing marriage, an affair
with a co-worker and a potential explosion over a savings-and-loan
scandal in which a man wrongly accused by Cromwell in a story
commits suicide.
   ``The Image'' also stars Kathy Baker as the magazine show's head
researcher and Cromwell's love interest, John Mahoney as his field
producer, Marsha Mason as his wife and Spalding Gray as the news
division president. Brian Rehak wrote the screenplay and Peter
Werner directed.
   ``She's always rushing down the halls,'' Kurtz said of her
character. ``I'm trying to give up smoking and always have a
cigarette in my hand or my mouth. It's a running gag that Finney's
always trying to light it. Then he says, `Oh, yes, you're trying to
quit.'
   ``In the original script, my character was a man. When the
writer found out no woman has such a high-ranking job on a
television news show, he said, `Hey, I'm going to make her a
woman.' To me, that explains a lot about her behavior. Because she
is a woman she has to be twice as tough. She overcompensates.
That's why she comes off so strong.''
   At the same time she was doing ``The Image'' in Los Angeles,
Kurtz was commuting back to her home in New York to co-star with
Michael Caine in ``A Shock To the System,'' which she describes as
either a black comedy or a psychological thriller _ she's not sure
which.
   ``It's about a New York marketing executive and his wife,'' she
said. ``He's expecting a big promotion, and when it goes to a
younger man he's shattered. He takes out his anger in extreme
behavior. When we were making it, we didn't know what kind of an
animal it would be. We shot it different ways and shot three
different endings. Whether it's a comedy or a thriller depends on
how they edit it.''
   Kurtz, whose most recent credits include the film ``Dangerous
Liaisons'' and the HBO movie ``Baja Oklahoma,'' is currently
appearing in a Stephen Sondheim stage musical about presidential
assassins. She plays Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme, a follower of
Charles Manson who was convicted of attempting to assassinate
President Ford.
   She got her unusual first name from the B-17D Flying Fortress
her father, Col. Frank Kurtz, flew during World War II. It was
called ``The Swoose,'' and when she was born newspaper headlines
said ``a New Swoose'' was born. The plane is now at the Smithsonian
Institution.

   Episcopal Bishop George Reynolds of
Nashville, Tenn., says the ``old world'' of clergy domination over
church life must give way to a ``servant church'' of all baptized
persons.
   ``In the old paradigm, the ordained clergy are the producers of
ministry and the laypersons the consumers of ministry,'' he told a
diocesan convention. ``It is the paradigm of hierarchy in the
church and its time is past.
   He said the ``tide of history'' is forcing Christians to seek
more democratic ways to start churches, help poor people and find a
sense of mission in personal life.
   ``In the new paradigm, all baptized people, clergy and laity
alike, are the ministers making up the servant church.''

   Considered one of the the most important Roman
Catholic documents since the reforming 1962-65 Second Vatican
Council, a proposed new ``universal catechism'' now is under review
by bishops.
   Theologians and other scholars also are taking a look at it and
find some serious faults with it, as well as some merits.
   Offered as a comprehensive summation of basic Catholic teachings
on faith and morals, its finished version is intended to serve as a
guide for catechisms in various regions of the world.
   ``It's a long document, and a lot of both positive and negative
elements are seen in it,'' said the Rev.Thomas J. Reese after
reviewing comments from a dozen church scholars.
   As coordinator of a symposium on the proposed document Jan.
27-28 at the Woodstock Theological Center in Washington, he said
papers prepared for it indicate ``a number of difficulties with the
catechism.''
   He said shortcomings are seen in its compartmentalizing of
aspects of faith, in its tendency to separate the spiritual from
the natural, in its ``poor use'' of the Bible and its sexist
language.
   Reese, a Jesuit theologian-political scientist and research
fellow at the center at Georgetown University, expressed doubts
that bishops could meet the May 31 deadline set by the Vatican for
their reactions to the 434-page draft.
   ``The bishops need a lot more time to examine such an important
document and to consult with theologians about it in formulating
their comments,'' he said in an interview.
   ``This is the the most important document to come out since
Vatican II,'' he said. ``It will set the parameters of how the
Catholic faith is taught in the 21st century.''
   A bishops' committee, headed by Archbishop Oscar Lipscomb of
Mobile, Ala., was set up early this month for a preliminary study,
but the bishops don't hold a business meeting until next November.
   Reese, 45, whose 1989 book, ``Archbishop,'' describes policies
and views of the church's U.S. archbishops, has another scheduled
for publication this fall, also by Harper &amp; Row, on scholarly
reactions to the proposed catechism.
   The long, often complex and technically worded document, was
produced by a special bishops' commission, headed by Cardinal
Joseph Ratzinger, chief of the Vatican's doctrinal office.
   Marked ``sub secreto'' (under secrecy), it was distributed in
December to the world's 2,500 bishops. It first was proposed at a
world synod of bishops in 1985 by Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston.
   Provisionally entitled, ``Catechism for the Universal Church,''
its structure follows a longtime pattern, much like the last such
universal ``Roman Catechism'' issued in 1566 after the Council of
Trent.
   There are three main sections, one on the Apostles' Creed,
another on the church's seven sacraments and the other on the Ten
Commandments, followed by an epilogue on prayer.
   This ``treatment in separate compartments make it difficult to
show the relationships of faith and life,'' Reese said. ``The
structure itself automatically sets up dichotomies between the
world and faith rather than their being integrated.''
   He noted that the Vatican Council emphasizes Christianity as
working in the world, rather than withdrawal from it.
   He said that the scholarly appraisals say the document reflects
a separation between ``the spiritual and the natural, the religious
and the secular. Vatican II sought to overcome that dichotomy.''
   The document frequently uses the word ``man'' and ``men'' in
references that apply to all people, male and female. For example,
some headings read, ``Man in Search for God,'' ``God Meets Man,''
``The Dignity of Man.''
   ``The sexually exclusivist language is terrible,'' Reese said.
``This day and age must be much more sensitive.''
   While the document frequently quotes the Bible, Reese said ``the
use of Scripture is very poor,'' usually quoted in ``proof-text
fashion to defend various doctrines.''
   ``It doesn't give the kind of comprehensive treatment that takes
into consideration the historical context and literary forms,'' he
said. ``Treatment of Scripture is very, very pre-Vatican II.''
   He said the document recognizes ecumenical efforts for church
unity, particularly with the Eastern Orthodox, ``but certainly
needs strengthening'' in references to Protestants.
   ``Some of the language is confusing and needs to be clarified,''
he said. ``It needs to be improved to stress the unity Catholics
have with Protestants in baptism and in Scriptures.''
   However, he said the document also had positive elements, such
as pointing up obligations for peace, justice and preservation of
the environment, and also in dealing with Judaism.
   The document, like Vatican II, says Jews should not be blamed
for Christ's crucifixion.
   Unlike the old Council of Trent catechism, the new draft
addresses issues unheard of then, such as nuclear and chemical
warfare, surrogate motherhood, biogenetic research, toxic waste and
reckless driving.

<HEAD>Social Security Issue Puts GOP on Defensive</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In one form or another, the Social Security
issue has been giving Republicans recurrent headaches for a
generation. It's back, this time wrapped into a dispute about taxes.
   And for all their efforts over the past 25 years-plus,
successive GOP campaigners and administrations have not found a way
to deal with the subject, except by denying that they are going to
cut anybody's benefits.
   This time, President Bush and his people argue that a tax cut
proposed by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., would jeopardize
future benefits. They claim to be the real defenders of the system.
   But Moynihan said in introducing his tax cut bill on Tuesday
that the government is mortgaging future benefits by borrowing away
the reserves that are supposed to be accumulating to make those
Social Security payments.
   Complex questions usually wind up in simplest terms in an
election-year debate, and in the case of Social Security, it all
gets down to protecting benefits, now paid to about 39 million
Americans. Always before, that has put Republicans on the defensive.
   Vice President Dan Quayle thinks it can be turned around this
year, on grounds that the Moynihan proposal would threaten future
benefits.
   ``Historically, we've been attacked on this, and now this is the
first real opening to show the American people that the Republicans
are not going to fool around with the benefits that people
expect,'' Quayle said in an interview.
   ``Cut these taxes the way that Moynihan is talking about, you
have to cut benefits at some time, and the president and the
Republican Party now have an opportunity to show the American
people once and for all that the Republicans are as committed to
the integrity of this Social Security trust fund as anybody.''
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois said the Moynihan
plan ``could inspire even more drastic threats to the system and
ultimately bring it down.''
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee,
called hearings on the proposal next month but warily sidestepped
an endorsement, saying he first wants to make certain ``that we
never have to cut Social Security benefits for future generations.''
   This debate is a descendant of an earlier political settlement
on the issue, a nagging problem for President Reagan, who turned it
over to a commission which recommended the buildup of reserve funds
that is at issue now.
   Moynihan served on that panel, but he contends that the
long-term financing plan it drafted in 1983 is being undermined
because the government is borrowing against the Social Security
trust fund, using it for current spending and at the same time
masking the true size of the federal deficit. So he says the
government should stop imposing the extra tax, about $55 billion a
year.
   The administration contends that is a play to force a general
tax increase to make up the $55 billion a year.
   Either way, the government is going to have to come up with the
money eventually, to pay benefits or to repay the money that is
being borrowed from the trust fund.
   And eventually, that means taxes.
   Democratic congressional leaders aren't yet sure whether they
will sign on with the Moynihan plan. But they are sure they like
the issue and the tactics involved.
   Sen. George Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, said the
Moynihan proposal will complicate Bush's effort to cut the capital
gains tax, and could even block it. It already has forced the
administration to come out against an election-year tax cut for the
130 million workers who pay Social Security taxes, and the
employers who match their payments.
   The latter point has fractured some administration tax
alliances. For example, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a staunch
ally in Bush's effort to cut the capital gains tax, has endorsed
the Social Security tax cut too.
   Republicans are looking for an alternative with a tax cut
flavor. Some, including Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House
minority whip, want to begin changing Social Security into a system
of retirement savings accounts, mandatory but eventually private.
The idea is to start making the change by requiring that the amount
of any Social Security tax cut be put into such retirement accounts.
   That's risky business _ a suggestion that Social Security be
changed into a private, voluntary system dug the Republicans into
trouble on the issue more than 25 years ago, and they've been
trying to dig out ever since. Barry Goldwater, the 1964 Republican
presidential nominee, suggested voluntary Social Security. That led
to a simple, devastating, Democratic campaign commercial: two hands
tearing up a Social Security card.
   There have been repeat performances, with variations, in most
campaigns since. Reagan made his political debut in the Goldwater
campaign, and signed on to the suggestion that it be made
voluntary, a position he later disowned and denied. In his 1976 and
1980 presidential campaigns, Reagan said the system was headed for
eventual bankruptcy unless action was taken to put it on a sound
financial basis in preparation for increasing benefit loads after
the turn of the century.
   That led to the 1983 commission proposal for increased reserves.
   Early in his administration, Reagan tried to restrict some
ancillary benefits and to delay a cost of living increase in basic
benefits. Congress wouldn't buy it, and the Democrats made it a
major point of campaign attack. Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the
Republican leader, has said the issue was a major factor in undoing
GOP control of the Senate in 1986.
   The Democrats raised it against Bush in the 1988 presidential
campaign, saying he wanted to raid Social Security to cut the
budget. Bush said those were shopworn scare tactics.
   Shopworn, perhaps. They also have been shop tested, to
Democratic advantage so far.

<HEAD>Explosive Growth in Social Investing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cause-related investing once was considered a
cockamamie idea concocted by liberal crackpots to make money on
companies that renounce ties to South Africa, shun defense
contracts and don't pollute.
   Over the past two decades, however, it has snowballed into a
multibillion dollar chunk of the investment business and has
branched into other areas ranging from credit cards to a
long-distance telephone service.
   Just the amount of money funneled into what are called socially
responsible mutual funds has grown so much that the Wall Street
establishment, hungry for business in a depressed industry, has
started to woo potential clients by touting money-making
opportunities tied to social and environmental concerns.
   Some staid brokerages, for example, now offer what they call
screened investments for clients who don't want to own securities
in companies that do business with South Africa's white minority
government. Others have established funds investing in companies
that recycle or make only ``peacetime products.''
   ``I think the traditional people are feeling a little funny.
They laughed, they made fun, and for 20 years they said this would
be a flash in the pan,'' said Rosalyn Will, a project director at
the Council on Economic Priorities, a New York group that
researches social investing. ``I don't think it's going to be that
way.''
   Over the past several years, the amount of money channeled into
socially responsible investment funds has multiplied to more than
$4.5 billion, said the Social Investment Forum, a Boston-based
association that promotes the concept of social investing.
   Many of these funds have been quite profitable, despite
predictions by some finance professionals that using social
criteria for screening investments is silly and risky.
   ``It totally deflated that argument,'' said Gordon Davidson,
executive director of the Social Investment Forum. ``They're now
beginning to set up their own social investment funds.''
   Two of the top-ranked mutual funds in 1989 ranked by Lipper
Analytical Securities were social funds. The Parnassus Fund earned
a 42.44 percent return and Ariel Growth Fund earned 39.97 percent.
   One of the pioneers in social funds, the Pax World Fund Inc.,
formed during the anti-Vietnam War movement in 1970, also ranked
among the best by Lipper last year, earning a 24.92 percent return.
Pax World President Luther Tyson attributed part of the fund's
success to strict criteria for what types of investments it will
buy.
   ``We are the only fund that defines so carefully how we don't
invest in war-related goods and services,'' Tyson said. ``We work
out a definition that can be monitored.''
   For example, he said, Pax World won't invest in the 600 largest
Defense Department contractors, using the Pentagon's own lists as a
guide. The fund also asks companies to respond to a questionnaire
about their environmental record before deciding whether to include
them in its securities portfolio.
   Most social investment funds stick to basic securities _ stocks,
government-backed bonds or certificates of deposit. None are known
to have ventured into the hazardous arena of futures, options and
high-yield junk bonds.
   ``We try to be sane,'' said David Schoenwald, who runs New
Alternatives, an environmental and alternative-energy mutual fund
that rose 26 percent last year. ``We're not a big enterprise,
nothing fancy. We're very plain vanilla. We buy only American
stocks, no options, no hedging. When we buy a stock, we hope we can
keep it forever.''
   Tyson said the explosive growth of social funds was part of what
he called increased interest in basic social values by stockholders
and other investors who want more control over how their money is
used.
   ``You see the biggest change in the relationship to the
environment,'' Tyson said. ``That battle has been fought and won.
Whenever you see major corporations include in their ads how
sensitive they are to the environment, you know you've got their
attention.''
   Ms. Will of the Council on Economic Priorities said so many
social investment funds have appeared recently that interested
investors should exercise caution in deciding which to choose.
   ``Some of these funds are so new they don't have a track
record,'' she said. ``It's like anything else, with people trying
to get into it. Just like oat bran.''
   Working Assets, one of the best-known social investment funds,
has been so successful that it has sanctioned use of the fund's
name for another business venture aimed at tapping the social
awareness of consumers.
   Working Assets Funding Service manages a Visa card, travel
agency and a long-distance telephone service. A percentage of user
fees are channeled into fund raising for social and environmental
non-profit-action groups ranging from Greenpeace to Amnesty
International.
   ``We're not out there competing with Citicorp and AT&amp;T,'' said
the service president, Peter Barnes. ``The people who use our
cards, our long-distance service, our travel service, they have a
broad interest in building a better world. They trust us to do the
screening.''

<TEXT>
   Take a long-range perspective on America, as
most highly successful investors do, and you might develop not just
a less frantic view of the future but a fatter wallet too.
   It will relieve you of worrying over the difficulties of savings
and loan bailouts, the intractable federal deficit, the chances of
recession and the possibilities of a tax cut or a tax increase.
   Many of the economic worries that concern people at any
particular time disappear from the scene, to be replaced by other
concerns. Many of the tax, financial and economic maneuvers of
government offset each other.
   You might even argue that discussions of tax increases or
decreases should barely concern you, even though every financial
adviser in the country will warn you that tax strategies are
necessary for your financial existence.
   The evidence about taxes, however, is that they seldom really
shift, or that if they do, it is for only a very limited time.
Taxes were cut sharply in the early 1980s. By the end of the decade
all were offset by increases.
   In fact, economist H. Eric Heinemann points out that individual
income taxes last year consumed about 10 percent of personal
income, or about the same as the average of the 45 years since
World War II.
   This isn't to say that Congress shouldn't be watched _ only that
watching income tax maneuvers might be to watch the wrong things.
While income tax increases and decreases offset each other, Social
Security taxes do not.
   Heinemann points out that since 1985, Social Security taxes
averaged 9.4 percent of personal income, up from 2.9 percent from
1950 through 1955, while in both periods individual income taxes
averaged 10.2 percent.
   It may also be unwise to get upset about economic numbers such
as monthly retail sales, unemployment, inflation rates and the
like, since increases or decreases in any of these can be revised
out of existence 30 days later.
   The long-range view also permits you to see the economy as the
cyclical creature that it is, and understand that what is down
today might be up five years from now _ securities, real estate,
interest rates, inflation rates ...
   The economy seldom stays the same; instead it rises and falls,
expands and contracts, a full cycle often occurring in less than
five years. But even those who know this get caught up in the
interim excitement.
   That excitement accounts for such things as people flocking to
buy stocks at the top of the market, spurred on by tales of higher
prices to come, and real estate developers rushing to build as a
glut approaches.
   At the other extreme are people abandoning the Midwest rustbelt
as it was strengthening into what is now one of the stronger
economic areas, and abandoning real estate in Houston when prices
could only go up, as they have.
   While the nature of economies is to grow and shrink rather than
remain the same, there is in the United States a very clear
constant: The expansions are larger than the contractions.
   Proof of this can be found in a comparison of America in 1915
and 1985. In the intervening time there occurred two highly
disruptive wars and several lesser ones, a destructive depression,
and bouts with runaway inflation.
   The following figures come from a joint study by the U.S. Bureau
of the Census and the Conference Board:
   In 1915, infant mortality per 1,000 births was 99, in 1985 it
was 11. Life expectancy at age 20 was 65 years in the earlier
period and 76 years in the later one.
   Homeownership as a percentage of all married couples rose from
46 percent to 77.6 percent. Gross national product, measured by the
same dollar (1985) in each instance rose to $3.998 trillion from
$468 billion.
   GNP per capita jumped to $16,777 from $4,660, an index of
productivity to 490 from 100, average hourly wages of workers in
manufacturing from $2.44 to $9.53.
   But in between those years there were many bad times, and many
frantic moments for those who couldn't lift their heads high enough
to see the bigger picture.

   Forty-one floors above midtown Manhattan, worlds
away from his home in the Soviet Union, Sven Papp walks with ease
through the paneled corridors of White &amp; Case, a bastion of U.S.
corporate law.
   The offices are filled with the fruits of capitalism _ plush
carpeting, flower arrangements and antique furniture, but Papp is
more impressed with the word processors. At his modest law practice
in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, Papp types his own documents on
an old-fashioned typewriter.
   But the 27-year-old lawyer is learning more than modern
technology at White &amp; Case, where he is part of an American Bar
Association program that for the first time has brought Soviet
lawyers into the American legal community.
   He hopes his study of free-market ventures will mean new clients
at home.
   Papp is one of 17 Soviet attorneys in the midst of seven months
of visits to law firms, law schools, corporations, prosecutors and
public defenders.
   Steven Raikin, the ABA attorney coordinating the program, has
gotten only positive response in monthly reports from the Soviet
lawyers and their hosts.
   Vladimir Zakhvataev, of the Ukraine, worked with federal and
state public defenders in San Diego and spent time in the U.S.
attorney's office. ``He has impressed everyone with his insightful
observations about ways to transfer some of what he has observed in
criminal law and protection of rights,'' Raikin said.
   Tatiana Zaharchenko, a teacher at Kharkov Law Institute in the
Ukraine, has been studying environmental law at the University of
California, Berkeley. She also toured toxic waste dumps and met
with officials. ``Coming from an area near Chernobyl, she will be a
real pioneer in environmental law,'' Raikin said.
   The desire to contribute to legal reform in the Soviet Union
emerged as a common theme in interviews with several participants.
   Papp wants to establish a cooperative law practice, patterned
after American firms, that specializes in representing foreign
companies in business ventures in the Soviet Union. Soviet lawyers
now may share office space, but they don't work together on cases.
``It's not enough for one attorney to work with a client. We need
teamwork, like it's done here,'' he said.
   In the academic setting of Cornell University School of Law,
Olga Djujeva has been studying family law. Djujeva, a Moscow State
University law teacher, plans to write a book about U.S. protection
of children's rights and to lobby Soviet officials to expand
programs in adoption and foster care.
   Her most rewarding experience has been volunteer work with
handicapped and Down syndrome children. ``I see these kids and they
are not miserable at all. They are happy. In our country,
handicapped kids are in hospitals or at home and nobody sees them.''
   In Nashville, Tenn., Valentin Blueger is cultivating contacts
just like any other entertainment lawyer seeking a record deal for
a client. Blueger, who is working at the law firm Farris, Warfield
&amp; Kanady, which represents the Grand Ole Opry, has so far been
unsuccessful in negotiating a U.S. record contract for a Latvian
rock singer. ``The market is so tough here and the acts are so
professional. I do hope something will come of my efforts.''
   The sophisticated U.S. music industry cannot be compared to the
system in the Soviet Union, where there is only one record label,
which doesn't even pay royalties, said Blueger, who hopes to be a
frontrunner as the industry expands.
   ``Up to now there have been much more complicated problems to
solve before the entertainment business, but someone has to
start,'' he said.
   The learning experience for the Soviets has gone beyond the
profession.
   Papp ruefully admits he's developed a new habit of starting his
day with two cups of coffee. He also speaks like a native when
asked about his host city: ``It's something that you love and hate
at the same time.''
   Moscow attorney Leonid Kheifets, who has been with the
Washington firm Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy, celebrated
Halloween in Georgetown, where thousands of costumed partygoers
filled the streets. The 36-year-old former professional basketball
player met up with a group of Australian rock musicians that night
and sent pictures of the revelry to his family in the Soviet Union.
   ``My wife wrote back asking, `Who are those strange people
surrounding you?''' Kheifets said with a laugh. His excitement
about his experience was still evident. ``To be absolutely free and
independent and to have the opportunity to express oneself as you
want was amazing.''
   Kheifets also tells of being approached on the street by a
panhandler. His initial reaction was to walk on, but he decided to
ask the man what he wanted. What ensued was a discussion about
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   ``We both were very happy. He didn't receive any money from us.
We just had a little chat. I found that it was right that I
stopped. If we can speak to each other without any anger, it works
every time, it works.''
   Kheifets said his theory can be applied to the lawyers' program
and the larger issue of U.S.-Soviet relations. ``Now they know 17
Soviet lawyers they can trust and under the program, every year
they will know more. This is the work for the future. To work to
together, you must trust your counterparts.''

<HEAD>The `Pink Floyd Effect' Grips Venice After Rock Concert</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even as Venice enjoys a winter hibernation
that allows the echoes of footsteps to resound in the nearly
deserted squares, the specter of Pink Floyd refuses to go away.
   A summer concert by the British rock group that drew more than
100,000 young people and left the city awash in garbage is a
recurring nightmare.
   It is being used as ammunition in a battle over a bid to make
Venice the site of an international fair in the year 2000, and has
led officials to bar carnival celebrations from famed St. Mark's
Square.
   Pink Floyd was allowed to perform on a floating stage in the
Venice lagoon in July after the rock group agreed to reduce its
decibel level to protect the colonnaded square and 9th century
basilica.
   But the trash left behind by the concertgoers and the sight of
thousands of people sleeping in the streets proved too much for
many Venetians.
   St. Mark's, said fine arts commissioner Margherita Asso in
banning the annual carnival from the massive square, ``was attacked
by vandals and there wasn't, and still isn't, sufficient police
protection.''
   So carnival will go on in other parts of the city judged less
fragile. It will be inaugurated Feb. 10 by a procession up the
Grand Canal led by a 75-foot-long floating bottle of Italian bubbly.
   Pre-Lent merrymaking is not the only talk of Venice. There is
also the bid, put forward by the Veneto region, to make Venice and
nearby cities the site of Expo 2000.
   Backers include such powerful figures as Venetian-born Foreign
Minister Gianni De Michelis, who also supported the Pink Floyd
concert. The Socialist official, the author of a guide to discos in
Italy, had said Venice must be open to all forms of culture,
including rock music.
   The fair is seen as a way of breathing new life into this city
of canals and marble palaces, whose year-round population has
dwindled to 80,000 from 130,000 over the past 25 years. Exhibitions
would feature science and culture.
   With the proper controls, Expo 2000 would be ``the right way to
bring Venice into the new century,'' De Michelis said.
   Those in favor insist the fair could attract new businesses and
lead to the renovation of housing and neighborhoods that have
decayed as young people have gone to the mainland in search of jobs.
   They have left Venice to the summer tourists and, to the lament
of many locals, cheap souvenir shops and pizza parlors catering to
daytrippers with backpacks. Such tourism has inspired calls for
daily quotas on the number of visitors.
   ``I am one of those who believe the idea (of a fair) should be
examined, not just written off,'' said Venice's cultural
commissioner, Fulgenzio Livieri, sitting in his office looking out
onto St. Mark's Square, frequented by almost as many pigeons as
people this time of the year.
   He sees it as an opportunity to attract two industries ``ideally
suited'' to the lagoon city _ film and fashion.
   But Livieri admits the ``Pink Floyd effect'' is still running
strong.
   Graffiti and posters declaring ``No to Expo'' have gone up in
the distinctive narrow lanes near the Rialto bridge while someone
has scrawled ``De Michelis, repent'' on the causeway linking Venice
to Mestre on the mainland.
   In December, a small group of Venetians took their protest to
Paris, holding up signs outside the offices of the international
committee that will select the host city. The other candidates are
Hanover, West Germany, and Toronto, Canada.
   The committee is expected to make its decision in June.
   For a city so dependent on outsiders, even Venetians catering to
tourists seem to have had their fill and hope Venice is kept out of
the plans.
   The newsweekly Panorama reported that one study predicts a fair
would attract more than 100,000 people a day during its four-month
run, paralyze the city and strain services to the breaking point.
   ``It could be a good thing for the region but one can't have
Venice pay for it,'' said Daniela Vedaldi, owner of the Florian
cafe, whose violinists serenade honeymooners from around the world.
   ``Venice belongs to the patrimony of the whole country and of
the world. I don't think Venice needs this.''

<HEAD>Sondheim `Sends in the Class' at Oxford</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OXFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Isn't it rich? Isn't it rare? For Stephen
Sondheim, far from Broadway at Britain's oldest university, this is
the year to send in the class.
   The American composer-lyricist has just completed his first week
as a visiting professor of drama and musical theater at Oxford,
saying he isn't so much teaching as conducting ``a musical on the
road.''
   ``I said, when I agreed to take this course on, that I would
only be willing to do so if it was in conjunction with a show of
mine in rehearsal or production somewhere nearby,'' he said.
   This was because Songheim does not believe that theater, a
collaborative effort, can be properly taught in a classroom.
   So, on their third meeting, his 13 students were off to London's
Royal National Theater to see rehearsals of ``Sunday in the Park
With George,'' which is to premiere March 15.
   The students had already received librettist James Lapine's
original script for the workshop production off-Broadway, and
Lapine's finished script for the Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway
show.
   On a recent Monday, Sondheim showed them the video of the
Broadway production made for American public television. The next
day, they met the show's British director, Steven Pimlott, and
studied a model of Tom Cairns' set.
   Sondheim has a second show opening this summer on London's West
End: ``Into the Woods,'' directed by Richard Jones and starring
Julia McKenzie.
   The remainder of his week was spent on the students, who were
asked to write and present an opening number for a show _ ``the
most important part of a musical piece,'' he said.
   The 59-year-old Sondheim fielded questions at St. Catherine's
College in his first public event since arriving in Oxford Jan. 13
to inaugurate an annual professorship in contemporary theater. At
the end of the week, he flew home, and will be back next month to
continue the course.
   The chair is financed by a 1.75 million pound ($2.8 million)
endowment from Cameron Mackintosh, the British producer of ``The
Phantom of the Opera,'' ``Miss Saigon'' and the 1987 London debut
of Sondheim's ``Follies.''
   Sondheim told the spillover crowd of 250 academics, students,
stars and Oxford townspeople that he saw his task as encouraging
young writers.
   With Mackintosh's help, he selected 13 people in December from
92 applicants for a course he intends to be ``very narrow'' in
focus.
   ``It is about songwriting for the theater, not songwriting for
the airwaves, MTV or anything like that,'' he said.
   Each applicant sent a tape of at least three musical numbers.
Sondheim said the successful ones all displayed ``a feel for the
theater ... a (musical) growth into manhood or womanhood.''
   He said they constituted ``a truly heterogeneous group whose
voices were not alike,'' and whose influences included ``jazz and
pop and traditional and folk and cabaret and Rodgers and
Hammerstein and me.''
   The students, not exclusively Oxford alumni, are composers or
lyricists, although they earn their living in such fields as
publishing, pharmaceuticals and screenwriting. The 11 men are
British; one of the women is Canadian, the other Australian.
   The British have responded admiringly to Sondheim's appointment,
despite complaints that Oxford undergraduates aren't more involved.
   Richard Wolffe, news editor of the student newspaper Cherwell,
called Mackintosh's gesture ``well-meaning,'' but said that ``the
position is kind of irrelevant because we don't have any drama
courses at the university.''
   Mark Steyn wrote in The Independent newspaper: ``Nobody expects
the young writers taking tutorials from Sondheim suddenly to
produce a `Gypsy' or `Company,' but if the experience teaches
nothing more than an awareness of the decades of evolution which
preceded those shows, it will have been worthwhile.''
   The students sounded grateful.
   Kit Hesketh-Harvey, 32, a musical lyricist and co-screenwriter
of the film ``Maurice,'' called the course ``a godsend.''
   Edward Hardy, 23, who left Oxford in 1988, called Sondheim ``a
tremendous human being ... not what you'd expect of a great
maestro.''

<TEXT>
   Desperate pleas of a family trying to locate a
runaway child, shocking closeups of a drug addict shooting up with
heroin, explicit re-creations of a brutal murder.
   It is called ``televisione-verita,'' or truth TV, and is
challenging the fluffy variety show in the ratings on Italy's
public and private television networks.
   The trend, media experts say, reflects Italians' love of
intrigue and their increasing openness to discuss their private
lives and problems with others.
   ``These programs are coherent with the Italian tradition of a
very gossipy society,'' said Franco Ferrarottia, a sociologist at
the University of Rome.
   They also have signaled a new relationship between state
television and the Italian public, which is generally alienated
from government institutions and bureaucracy.
   ``Until recently TV was a major pillar of the establishment,''
Ferrarotti said in an interview. ``These programs would have been
considered scandalous, even blasphemous. The official TV is finally
moving into the sphere of private Italian life.''
   The explosion of truth TV has improved ratings but also raised
ethical questions about invasion of privacy and use of dramatic
reconstructions and anonymous calls.
   Oreste Del Buono, a TV columnist for the newspaper Corriere
Della Sera, has been a leading critic of the shows, saying networks
are taking too many risks with live broadcasts, anonymous callers
and crime shows that focus on ``poor people, without laywers,
treated like animals.''
   The shows are also a product of the intense competition between
the state-run RAI network and the three major private stations of
Silvio Berlusconi. Most of the truth TV programs are on RAI, which
exploits its monopoly on live broadcasting.
   Truth TV relies heavily on phone calls from the public, adding
to the drama and immediacy of the broadcast but also creating
potential risks.
   On one recent weekday afternoon, actress Sandra Milo was host on
a new live talk show, ``L'Amore e Una Cosa Meravigliosa'' (``Love
Is a Wonderful Thing''), on RAI when a woman called in and said,
``Sandra, what are you doing there while your son is seriously
injured in the hospital?''
   To the horror of a nationwide audience of some 3 million people,
Milo burst into sobs, ran off the set and fainted in her dressing
room. The call turned out to be a hoax as her son, Ciro, was
tracked down at the home of friends.
   RAI said it would tighten controls on phone calls to live shows,
but some commentators said viewers would no longer trust anonymous
callers.
   ``This incident signals a critical moment in the history of
truth television,'' wrote best-selling novelist Umberto Eco in a
column in L'Espresso magazine. ``It's certain that from this moment
the public will become more suspicious and many programs will
suffer from a crisis of credibility.''
   That hasn't seemed to be the case so far with the most popular
of the new genre, ``Chi L'Ha Visto?'', a show on missing people
that attracts more than 5 million viewers on Sunday nights.
   The live, three-hour RAI program uses elaborate re-creations
tracing missing persons' lives and last known movements, composite
photos showing how their appearances could have changed, interviews
with their families and calls from viewers around the country who
may have spotted them.
   The inaugural show last year caused a stir when it examined the
disappearance of a U.S. woman sailor from a military base in
Naples. It included a re-creation suggesting the woman had been
murdered after a sexual tryst with two fellow American male
sailors. But hours after the show aired, the woman was found alive
and well in southern Italy by a police officer who had watched the
program. She had run off with a Moroccan immigrant.
   Calls from viewers on ``Chi L'Ha Visto?'' have helped reunite
several families, but often the missing person has run away on his
or her own and has no intention of going home. On a recent show, a
wife became visibly annoyed as callers repeatedly reported having
seen her missing husband traveling with a young woman _ one said he
saw the couple dancing the tango in a nightclub near Naples.
   ``It couldn't be him, he doesn't like the tango,'' the wife shot
back.
   Lio Beghin, who conceived the show, said in an interview with Il
Messaggero newspaper: ``We are well aware that the biggest danger
is invading the private life of a person and getting into the
merits of making a free choice to leave one's past behind. But
people also have the right to know the fate of a missing relative.''
   Another popular but controversial live RAI program is ``Telefono
Giallo,'' which literally translates as ``Yellow Telephone'' but is
a play on the word ``giallo,'' which also means ``mystery.'' The
show examines unsolved crimes, hoping that anonymous calls will
help provide clues that can reopen the case.
   ``This show could probably go on for another 1,000 years,''
Ferrarotti joked. ``So many Italian crimes are unsolved.''
   Crime is also the main event in programs such as ``Pronto
Polizia,'' a show on the private Italia Uno channel that follows
police on emergency calls _ from raids on drug dens to breakups of
street fights.
   Last year, guests on ``Io Confesso'' (``I Confess'') would sit
in a booth, their faces concealed, and recount their crimes or
aberrant behavior and answer questions from psychologists. On ``La
Macchina Della Verita'' (``The Truth Machine''), they submitted to
lie-detector tests.
   The Italian public sometimes complains that TV goes too far.
Many Italians were shocked when one of Berlusconi's stations showed
a young addict injecting himself with heroin on camera. Many
protested when RAI subjected 8-year-old Marco Fiora to prolonged
questioning on a live, nationwide interview show only a short time
after the boy's release from a 17-month kidnapping ordeal.
   ``For years we justly lamented that TV put people to sleep, that
it was a social pacifier,'' Corrado Augias, host of ``Telefono
Giallo,'' told Europeo magazine. ``And now that TV tackles problems
and crime news, it almost seems that some want to go back to that
unglorious past.''
   But overall, Italians' love affair with TV is stronger than
ever. What other country has 10 national TV magazines on the market?
   Pay-TV could be the next wave. Italy's first pay station,
Italian Network, is scheduled to debut Feb. 28. For the cost of a
$200 descrambler, viewers will be able to watch pornographic movies
after midnight.
   Tens of thousands of people already have signed up, but others
have threatened to file obscenity charges to keep the station off
the air.
   Stay tuned.

<HEAD>Student Complaint Triggers Huge Southern Baptist Inquiry</HEAD>
<NOTE>With Laserphoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A single student circulated a letter accusing a widely
respected, longtime seminary professor of wrong teaching. The
jarring result was an extensive investigation, separately
interrogating nearly all the professor's students about his views.
   The drastic, inquisitorial process at Southern Baptist
Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., flagship of the
denomination's ministerial education, reflects the mistrust
pervading the country's largest Protestant body.
   If it hadn't been for that strained, uneasy atmosphere, ``we
would never have resorted to this kind of procedure,'' said the
Rev. Roy L. Honeycutt, the seminary's president.
   ``It was an unusual response because of the particular
circumstances among Southern Baptists in which seminaries and
professors are placed under attack.''
   A fundamentalist wing has dominated the 14.8 million-member
denomination for 10 years, gaining control of trustees of
seminaries and other institutions and putting pressure on personnel
to conform to fundamentalist views.
   The attack on the Christian ethics professor, the Rev. Paul D.
Simmons, was only the latest such episode, but the drawn-out
individual questioning of 50 of his students wa
scrupulous, investigative processes. It's a sick climate, a kind of
religious McCarthyism, but we have to be very honest and open in
terms of what we teach.''
   Simmons, 53, who has taught for 20 years at this oldest Baptist
seminary, founded in 1864, added: ``The whole issue is part of a
larger battle over academic freedom and responsibility. This
faculty here is committed to solid, academic integrity, and we
won't let this kind of thing erode that commitment.''
   The Rev. Larry L. McSwain, dean of the seminary's theology
school, conducted the drawn-out quizzing of Simmons' students,
concluding that the student's charges were ``patently untrue.''
   Considering the suspicions stirred by fundamentalists and the
wide circulation of the letter among critical people, McSwain said,
``it was important to determine the facts and set the record
straight.''
   In ordinary circumstances, a lone student's complaint would be
resolved simply by clarifying consultations, but in this case, the
detailed findings were relayed in a conference call to trustees,
who affirmed them.
   ``Certain persons are quite distrustful of the educational
community, and it was necessary to demonstrate with hard evidence
that the charges were not true,'' McSwain said. ``Rumors are very
believable in the context of the Southern Baptist Convention.''
   The denomination's dominant fundamentalist wing insists on a
literalist view of the Bible, that it is factually ``inerrant''
historically, scientifically and religiously. The fundamentalists
also demand that personnel adhere to this view.
   Many other Baptists, including other fundamentalists, stress the
historic Baptist principle of the ``soul competence'' of believers
to interpret the Bible as they understand it.
   Asked if the fundamentalist wing instigated the student's
letter, McSwain said: ``We have no evidence that this was so. We
know that others bought stamps for the mailings, and he was
assisted in the process. But by whom, and to what extent, I don't
know.''
   He said the current atmosphere ``tends to discourage creativity
and innovation.''
   Simmons said that ``some professors become so cautious out of
fear of being attacked that they no longer deal as openly with
issues as they would have otherwise.''
   ``This happens especially in smaller seminaries, which are are
more vulnerable. Some of it has happened here, but not a lot,'' he
said.
   Leonard, the historian, said the situation also is ``disruptive
to students who may hesitate to talk to each other for fear they
might be accused.''

   A leader of the mainly black National
Baptist Convention, U.S.A., says attempts are being made to lure
members and pastors into the mainly white Southern Baptist
Convention to increase its black membership.
   Cecilia Adkins, head of the National Baptist publishing board,
said at a recent meeting of educators at the denomination's new
headquarters that the group needed counter-tactics against losing
members to the Southern Baptists.
   The National Baptist Convention has about 5.5 million members,
the Southern Baptist Convention about 14.8 million, of whom about
300,000 are black.
   Olivia Cloud of the Southern Baptists' black church development
section, denied the group sought to ``go after National Baptists.''
   ``If anybody switches convention it demonstrates a need is being
met,'' she said.

   About 9,000 Roman Catholic schools serving 2.6

McNamee, president of the National Catholic Education Association.

   Episcopal Bishop George Reynolds of
Nashville, Tenn., says the ``old world'' of clergy domination over
church life must give way to a ``servant church'' of all baptized
people.
   ``In the old paradigm, the ordained clergy are the producers of
ministry and the laypersons the consumers of ministry,'' he said at
a diocesan convention. ``It is the paradigm of hierarchy in the
church and its time is past.''
   He said the ``tide of history'' is forcing Christians to seek
more democratic ways to start churches, help poor people and find a
sense of mission in personal life.
   ``In the new paradigm, all baptized people, clergy and laity
alike, are the ministers making up the servant church.''

   Buried in a mountain meadow on the
edge of Yellowstone National Park is a complex of 150-foot-long
steel cylinders outfitted with beds, food, kitchens and water
systems for 756 people.
   The 30 cylinders are the guts of a giant fallout shelter being
built by the Church Universal and Triumphant, a New Age religious
group that moved its international headquarters to this
southwestern Montana ranch in 1986.
   Church members say the six-acre complex isn't provocative or
extraordinary, merely a precaution against nuclear war or accident.
Others see it as a symbol of church chicanery and disregard for the
area's rural environment.
   ``We believe if you live in a nuclear world, you have to come to
grips with the reality of our time,'' said Murray Steinman, a
church staffer. ``We feel it's the responsible thing to do. We feel
that more people should do it.''
   ``They've never been willing to discuss plans prior to
construction on anything,'' said Richard Parks, owner of an
outdoor-equipment shop at Gardiner and a frequent critic of church
developments. ``Any responsible developer is going to do the
planning first and then go to the community for approval.''
   Church officials didn't divulge its construction until last
summer _ five months after the state completed an extensive
environmental review of other church developments at the Corwin
Springs ranch.
   ``I think I was had, basically,'' said Steve Pilcher, chief of
the Water Quality Bureau, which oversaw the review that was
completed last February.
   Church spokeswoman Erin Prophet said that construction began in
May and that a decision on the site wasn't made until after the
state review.
   ``I personally think that's a little bit of a crock,'' Pilcher
said. ``You don't decide overnight on a project of this magnitude.''
   The church has been scrutinized by the media and its neighbors
since buying the 12,500-acre Royal Teton Ranch bordering
Yellowstone in 1981 from publisher Malcolm Forbes. It has since
expanded its holdings in Park County to 30,000 acres, built two
food-processing plants, opened a printing plant in Livingston and
sponsored two housing developments for church members near
Emigrant, 25 miles north. It plans another housing development at
the ranch.
   Local officials estimate 2,000 church members live in the area,
or 15 percent of the county population.
   Persistent rumors that the church was stockpiling weapons
against some Armageddon were fueled last year when two members
pleaded guilty to charges of illegally obtaining a dozen military
assault-style weapons; federal agents said they seized a shopping
list for more firearms. Church officials have denied the rumors,
and say the two who bought the guns _ including church Vice
President Edward Francis _ were acting without the knowledge or
approval of the church.
   The shelter complex isn't the only church-related underground
construction. Adherents are building private shelters at Emigrant.
County officials counted at least 16 under construction there _ one
with a capacity of 170 people. A magazine published by church
members carries advertisements selling space in the shelters, with
prices ranging from $1,250 to $6,270 a person.
   Church leader Elizabeth Clare Prophet has preached civil defense
since the 1970s and warns of economic and nuclear calamity in the
'90s. In 1987, she said she received a divine message that the
nation should develop civil defense and missile-defense systems in
anticipation of a nuclear confrontation.
   The confrontation didn't occur by the predicted date of Oct. 2,
1989, but followers say her messages are warnings rather than
predictions.
   ``She has said that it may happen ... because there's always
free will,'' says Erin Prophet, Mrs. Prophet's daughter. ``The
Americans have free will, the Soviets have free will. ... But as
long as the Soviets have nuclear weapons and ICBMs, then we think
we need to have shelters.''
   The large shelter complex is in a valley where the church holds
an annual conclave attended by thousands of followers. Non-members
are not allowed in the area, which is considered sacred. Church
engineers designed the structure, with advice from private firms
and the federal Oak Ridge National Laboratories. Most of the work
has been done by church staff members.
   The complex consists of six H-shaped configurations, each with
five 150-foot-long steel cylinders about 13 feet in diameter. A
large central structure lies between two of the H-shaped shelters.
   Church officials say the shelter's water and sewage systems are
exempt from state review because it won't be occupied by more than
25 people for more than 60 days a year _ the legal description of a
``public water system.''
   ``The government says you would only need to be in the fallout
shelter for a few weeks'' in the event of a nuclear catastrophe,
Steinman said. ``We don't want to live down there any longer than
necessary.''
   Critics, including Yellowstone National Park Superintendent
Robert Barbee, scoff at such reasoning and have asked the state to
reopen its review. ``What does it take to have (state officials)
say, `You can't build an underground city for 750 people without
the proper permits?''' Parks fumed.
   Pilcher said his office is looking for evidence of deception,
but without it the state can't reopen the case. ``The only thing I
could do is say to the church, `I think you're a liar,' but I don't
have anything to prove that.''
   Parks and other critics say the construction is indicative of
the church's pre-emptive methods of development in areas ill-suited
for it.
   Prophet replies that the church has followed the law and doesn't
need to disclose its plans unless legally required to do so. ``They
don't really care about the environment,'' she said. ``They care
about stopping us. Basically what they want to do is shut us down.''

<HEAD>Chrysler LeBaron: Comfortable Road Handler With Minor Flaws</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, Graphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   It took three years for the totally dolled-up Chrysler LeBaron
coupe to make the scene, but the wait was worth it.
   Three years ago, Chrysler Corp. reworked the outside of its
popular LeBaron coupes. For 1990, the company fussed over the
inside and added new engine choices.
   The result is a 1990 LeBaron GT coupe that is a capable road
handler with a habitable interior.
   The LeBaron's new 3-liter V-6 engine, mated with a four-speed
automatic transmission in the test car, provided both performance
and fuel economy. The engine responded in a sane, not rip-roaring,
fashion yet offered plenty of zip.
   And despite the good-sized powerplant, the test car delivered a
decent 21 mpg in combined city-highway driving. LeBaron buyers also
may choose one of three other engines and three other transmissions
offered this year.
   The car's front-drive design and compact size made the GT coupe
easy to maneuver, even in snow-clogged parking lots that bogged
down larger, rear-drive cars.
   I was impressed, too, by the stopping capability of this GT
coupe. Twice it stopped solidly, evenly, in the snow behind cars
making sudden turns.
   From inside, I could hear the engine and some road noise, and I
felt the road bumps. I also was distracted by the AM-FM cassette
player that flung cassettes onto the center console when I pushed
the eject button.
   But I appreciated not having to lift items over the car body to
get them into the flat, nicely carpeted trunk. True, the trunk
clearance is low, meaning tall items must be laid down to fit. But
the test car also had split rear seats that folded down for
versatility.
   Chrysler did a good job of upgrading the dashboard. The
instrument panel was relatively uncluttered, with needle gauges
used for the tachometer, speedometer and the oil pressure,
temperature, fuel and battery indicators.
   Around the sides of these instruments, atop the rounded
instrument cluster jutting out of the dashboard, were the controls
for lights and wipers. They took some getting used to: I had to
reach forward with my right hand and push a lever up to the left to
turn on the wipers, then push an adjacent button to squirt washer
fluid onto the windshield. Headlight buttons were similarly
situated on the left side.
   The test car's optional front bucket seats felt fine. The back
seat, however, would be a tight squeeze for three adults. The
middle person's head would likely hit the sloping roofline and
legroom was tight with the front seats pushed back.
   LeBaron GT coupe buyers have a median age of 37 and median
household income of $50,000, Chrysler said. Thirty-five percent are
women and 35 percent are single. Fifty percent have college
educations.
   The GT is one of four LeBaron coupe models that start at
$12,495. The GT model, with its sporty outer styling and other
standard features, has a base price of $15,678. Competitors include
the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, which starts at $14,495, Buick
Regal, which starts at $15,200, and Mercury Cougar, which starts
around $15,800.
   LeBaron sales totaled more than 38,000 last year, down
substantially from 57,035 in calendar 1988. Chrysler spokespeople
attributed the slump to the sluggish U.S. market and would not
project sales or production figures for LeBaron in 1990. The
company also is introducing a LeBaron sedan this year.
   Consumer Reports magazine says 1987 model LeBaron coupes ranked
worse than average in owner reports of trouble, while the 1988
models ranked much worse than average. Chrysler officials said they
had no comment.

<HEAD>More Than Farm Wealth Needed for Rural Development</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maybe, just maybe, rural development is taking
on a new profile of jobs, roads, bridges, recreation, bus routes
and all the other things that are supposed to make life better for
people in the boonies.
   Maybe, just maybe, the hoary notion that all rural America needs
to make it sing again is $5-a-bushel wheat, $10 soybeans and
comparable prices for other crops and livestock is fading.
   Rural America, as Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter noted
last week, is comprised of roughly 60 million people in small towns
and communities, including about 5 million on the nation's farms.
   Yeutter, at a news conference, elaborated on President Bush's
long-awaited initiative on rural development. No new spending was
recommended.
   But the Bush plan did include some old favorites under new
names: an advisory panel called the President's Council on Rural
America, state versions of the same kind of committee,
demonstration projects to show people how to carry out rural
development, targeting ``limited federal budget resources,'' and a
telphone hotline so people can find out where to go for help.
   Although Yeutter stressed the importance of farmers in
``production agriculture,'' he made it clear it will take much more
than farm prosperity to get rural communities humming again. The
wealth of 5 million farm people is not enough to trickle down to
all.
   ``And even though agriculture is the largest single component of
that economic activity, it is by no means the sole component and
should not be the sole component,'' Yeutter said. ``What we're
really saying is that we have to devote time and effort and energy
and some intelligence to creating ways for rural communities to
expand their job bases well beyond agriculture.''
   Of course, it is not a brand new concept that jobs and not the
price of wheat are the key to rural development. But the facts
appear to be sinking in faster these days.
   Bush's directive to get cracking on rural development was
initiated by the findings and recommendations of the Economic
Policy Council's working group on rural development, of which
Yeutter was chairman. The group includes other Cabinet and White
House representatives.
   In its report, the group outlined the needs of rural America,
citing unemployment rates and how rural areas lag behind the cities
in so many ways. And the report dispelled any notion that
agriculture is the only sure way to rural prosperity.
   ``Agriculture remains the most important industry in rural
America, but now employs relatively few people,'' the report said.
``This trend is likely to continue.''
   Other observations:
   _Today only about 9 percent of all rural people work on farms or
ranches.
   _Less than 19 percent of rural Americans now derive their
livelihoods from activities associated with agriculture.
   _Only 500 of America's 2,400 rural counties are now considered
dependent on agriculture.
   ``Any new lifeblood for rural America will be found primarily in
off-farm employment opportunities, especially in industries such as
tourism, retirement living and commercial recreation which all
serve to bring additional income to rural communities,'' the report
said.
   Jobs in town are significant to farmers as well as non-farmers,
it said. Although net farm income has improved dramatically, more
than 60 percent of all farm families still rely on some off-farm
employment to maintain themselves.
   ``While a strong farm economy is essential to rural America, a
strong farm economy is not enough, by itself, to assure rural
vitality,'' the report said. ``The farm sector's economic recovery
since 1986 has not revived overall prosperity in rural communities;
non-farm jobs are essential.''
   The answer lies in concentrated, selected, realistic, gung-ho
efforts by concerned federal, state and local people, the Bush
initiative seems to say.
   Congress will have its say, too, and that may include some
sterner directives, perhaps with some money attached. It could come
as part of the 1990 farm bill now stewing on the legislative
burner, or it might be a separate law.
   Meanwhile, the Bush administration says there are dozens of
federal programs that can assist in rural development, and part of
the new campaign will be to define and use those to better
advantage.
   That is not good enough for some concerned rural Americans, who
may be turning to Japan for financial help.
   Japan's government-owned Export-Import Bank is considering loans
to the United States, says a recent New York Times story from
Tokyo. The idea arose after the governors of Arkansas, Louisiana
and Mississippi talked to Japanese officials a little more than a
year ago.
   Now, said the newspaper, ``The bank is giving serious
consideration to providing what could be billions of dollars of
subsidized loans to underdeveloped regions in several states.''
   Such loans probably would be used for roads, ports or other
developments that would aid economic growth, one bank official told
the Times.
   ``Japanese official said the idea was born in September 1988,
when the three governors visited Japan and asked for help in
financing projects that neither their states nor the federal
government could afford,'' the article said.

   Middle-class drug addiction was good business
for American hospitals until too many of them figured that out.
   Clinics, hospitals and health-care companies that jumped to
capitalize on the high-profit field of residential drug and alcohol
treatment now frequently find themselves with empty beds, while
public programs for those unable to pay struggle to keep pace with
demand.
   Addicts in some parts of the country wait six months or more to
get into a publicly financed program, but about 40 percent of the
beds in private treatment centers lie empty, experts say.
   ``If you can pay, you can get treatment. If you cannot pay,
you're going to be put on a waiting list in most places,'' said
Bill Butynski, executive director of the National Association of
State Alcohol and Drug Abuse directors.
   This disparity is growing, the experts say, despite an increase
in public funds for substance-abuse treatment over the last decade
and a growing awareness among employers, and society in general, of
the need for treatment.
   ``The need for treatment is higher than it has ever been, but
the demand is a little different,'' said Mike Ford, president of
the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers, which
represents private treatment centers.
   Treatment options are being dictated increasingly by economics,
as the government, employers and insurers try to rein in the
soaring costs of health care, he and many other experts say.
   ``The economic tail is wagging the clinical dog,'' said Norman
Hoffmann, a clinical psychologist at the Ramsey Clinic in St. Paul,
Minn., and director of the clinic's Chemical Addiction Treatment
Outcome Registry.
   The result is intense scrutiny over the need for residential or
in-patient treatment, which can run upwards of $15,000, and an
increasing reliance on less expensive out-patient programs.
   Hospitals rushed into the extended-care, live-in treatment
business but many now find they cannot fill their spaces. Studies
have shown residential and out-patient treatment to be about
equally effective, and insurance companies have seized on this in
arguing that more addicts should be channeled into the less
expensive programs.
   But treatment providers say residential treatment, typically
about 28 days, is more appropriate for some addicts, especially
those who need to be physically separated from their everyday
environment to break their dependency.
   Private, residential treatment programs began popping up in the
mid-1970s after Medicare began covering live-in treatment. Private
insurance companies also began including coverage in their packages.
   By the early 1980s, residential coverage was common practice,
the number of free-standing treatment facilities was growing and
more hospitals were setting aside beds for drug and alcohol
treatment.
   But in 1983, Medicare _ which often drives medical practices in
this country because of its huge budget, now more than $100 billion
_ implemented a program designed to cut hospital costs. Under this
program, Medicare agreed to pay hospitals a specified amount for
treatment of various disorders and illnesses, categorized in
diagnostic related groups, or DRGs.
   Before DRGs, a hospital could be reimbursed at the same rate for
all in-patient care, whether it applied to a cancer patient
requiring intense medical supervision or an alcoholic in for
detoxification and needing less attention.
   But under DRGs, hospitals can no longer get top dollar for
addiction treatment beds. Some have begun converting those beds to
more profitable uses, including units for organ transplant and
cancer patients, which need the higher levels of medical staffing
hospitals provide, said Ken Estes, spokesman for the National
Association of Addiction Treatment Providers.
   Employers and insurers, meanwhile, are feeling the effects of
skyrocketing health-care costs, some rising more than 15 percent a
year.
   They began their own efforts to cut back, usually by reducing
coverage and scrutinizing use of benefits. Now, companies and
insurance companies increasingly are turning to ``managed care,''
in which an outside company reviews claims to determine whether
treatment was medically necessary.
   ``This leads to decisions on a level of care based not on what a
patient needs, but on economic considerations,'' said Ford.
   As a result, he said, private treatment programs have found it
more difficult to get patients to fill their beds because more
employers and insurance companies are steering away from
residential treatment.
   Though out-patient programs are usually less expensive,
participants sometimes wind up paying more out-of-pocket for them
because insurance coverage is generally not as good as for
in-patient programs.
   ``The treatment industry is struggling to match up with what the
buyers of services want to pay for, and in a nutshell, they want it
very cheap,'' said W. James Nicol, president of Comprehensive Care
Corp., one of the largest providers of residential treatment
services.
   Nicol blames many of CompCare's recent financial troubles _ it
reported a $4.7 million loss for the third quarter of 1989 and
occupancy rates that have fallen to 46 percent _ on government and
business efforts to cut health-care costs.
   His company and others like it are responding to the financial
austerity by shifting some of their emphasis to out-patient
programs, although historically these have never been as
profitable, he said.
   Since fiscal 1982, federal block grants to states for alcohol,
drug and mental health services have risen from $429 million to
$765 million in fiscal 1989. This year, the total is expected to
reach $1.2 billion.
   More than $3 billion in federal, state and local funds were
spent on alcohol and drug abuse treatment in 1987, according to
government data.
   In fiscal 1988, the National Association of State Alcohol and
Drug Abuse Directors counted 6,926 substance-abuse programs that
received public money, a 50 percent increase from fiscal 1984.
   Federal government data counted 984 private for-profit centers
in 1987. These data, based on a voluntary survey, also showed 4,503
private non-profit programs that year, some of which may receive
public funds and may also be counted in the state directors'
numbers.
   Few programs are financed and operated solely by the government.
Most of the time, states use their federal and state dollars to
contract with private, non-profit centers for treatment services.
These funds also usually require the programs to provide service to
anyone who needs it, regardless of ability to pay.
   ``That's probably the biggest reason for the waiting lists,''
said Olive Jacob, an Albany, N.Y.-based consultant on alcohol and
drug issues.
   Adding to the problem, she said, is that the federal government
and many states prohibit their funds being used for private,
profit-making programs.
   She and others say the problem of waiting lists, which is most
severe in the larger East and West Coast cities, could be eased if
the federal and state governments were more flexible in the use of
their treatment dollars.
   Ford said that if the government set a price for a treatment
service, offered it to private providers and said ``take it or
leave it, they'd take it.''

   Paul A. Lara started using marijuana,
alcohol, PCP and LSD when he was 14 years old. In time, he went to
school only to see friends who could sell him more drugs.
   It wasn't until he was 25, a veteran of a 30-day hospital drug
treatment regime and a six-month live-in program, that he was ready
to get off the drugs and get on with his life.
   But the county of Los Angeles wasn't ready for him.
   Lara, with his insurance depleted years ago and little money
left, was put on a waiting list for the county-financed Impact
program, an intensive six- to nine-month stay at a residential
treatment center with 90 beds.
   ``I had to call every day for three weeks before they told me I
could come in for an interview,'' said Lara. ``When I got here,
they said they've got a space and it's now or never. I went into
this place with the clothes on my back.''
   Lara, who was admitted in November, was in some senses one of
the lucky ones. He managed to keep calling.
   Many of the 1,500 to 1,800 people on waiting lists for Los
Angeles County's live-in treatment centers disappear. Before anyone
can help, they sink deeper into their addictions, sometimes getting
arrested, even killed, because of their craving.
   Los Angeles County, four times the size of Rhode Island and home
to 8.7 million people, has just 650 treatment beds available
through 18 publicly financed programs.
   Only two hospitals in the county offer publicly financed
detoxification _ usually the first step in treatment in which an
addict's body is flushed of drugs.
   After detox, people in need of live-in treatment programs can be
placed on waiting lists for as long as six months. Methadone
clinics and outpatient programs have four- to five-month waiting
lists.
   ``We cannot provide treatment on demand. It's as simple as
that,'' said Irma Strantz, the county's drug program administrator.
   ``The number of people waiting for treatment far exceeds, by
multiples of two or three, the available spaces,'' said Maury
Weiner, who heads the Tarzana Treatment Center in the San Fernando
Valley.
   Officials at public centers say the situation will only get
worse. They point to a drug problem that shows no signs of abating,
erratic state and federal financing and the difficulties of
treating an increasing number of addicts who are pregnant or suffer
AIDS.
   ``There are people screaming for treatment, and it's
heartbreaking that we are not able to provide the treatment for
them,'' said Clyde W. Oden, president and chief executive of the
Watts Health Foundation.
   For somebody seeking public treatment, persistence is key.
   Officials at Joint Efforts, a San Pedro outpatient program, tell
people on waiting lists to call twice a day to see if a bed is
available for detoxification.
   When beds open up, it's up to the addicts to get themselves to
the hospital for the four- to seven-day detox before coming back to
Joint Efforts for counseling.
   Joint Efforts' executive director, Pat Herrera Duran, said the
wait is at least three weeks for detox, in which time addicts often
deplete family funds, and rob and assault to sustain a drug habit.
   ``Whatever it is they're doing to get their drugs, they'll
continue to do,'' she said.
   While public centers struggle, privately operated treatment
facilities have beds to spare. At prices as high as $1,000 a day
for treatment, only the rich _ or those with good insurance _ can
afford it.
   In Pasadena, a few miles from the Impact center, the Summit
Share Unit at St. Luke Medical Center has occupants for just 10 of
its 20 beds for a month-long program that costs about $11,000.
Summit sponsors drug and alcohol awareness seminars as part of its
marketing campaign.
   ``It's a real tragedy,'' said Diane Cullen, community relations
director at Summit.
   ``I get lots of people calling from pay phones on the street
needing methadone but (who) don't have insurance. We can't take
them. As cold as it sounds, this is a for-profit organization.''

   The federal budget deficit increased $14.64
billion in December, putting the deficit so far this fiscal year at
more than two-thirds permitted for the entire year, the government
said.
   Combined with the $55.05 billion deficit for October and
November, the imbalance at the end of December totaled $69.69
billion, compared to $67.58 billion at the same point in fiscal
1989, the Treasury Department said Tuesday.
   That means that although the government has a lower deficit
ceiling this year, it has spent 3.1 percent more than it did during
the first three months of fiscal 1989.

   U.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politan found Tuesday that Antar

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors are still concerned about Exxon
Corp.'s sullied image after two oil-polluting incidents in less
than a year, analysts say.
   After a bad 1989 following the disastrous March spill off the
Alaskan coast, the nation's largest oil company began the year with
a Jan. 2 pipeline rupture that left 567,000 gallons of heating oil
floating in the Arthur Kill waterway between New York City and New
Jersey.
   The latest spill has resulted in new lawsuits and accusations
against the oil giant on top of more than 150 other suits stemming
from the Alaska spill. The state of New Jersey is one of the
plaintiffs over the latest pollution, which Exxon officials at
first blamed on a faulty leak-detection system.
   ``What happened in New York-New Jersey further blackened the
eye,'' said Frank P. Knuettel, oil industry analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Exxon's stock lagged behind the overall industry's performance
last year after the Alaska spill, remaining relatively flat at
about $45. In comparison, stocks of Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp.
had gains of about 20 percent during that period.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday,
Exxon stock closed up 12{ cents at $47.12{ a share.
   The total financial impact of the Arthur Kill spill is unknown.
Exxon has offered to pay for environmental studies and damages
associated with the leak.
   Cleanup of the Alaska spill, which resulted when an Exxon tanker
ran aground in Prince William Sound, has cost Exxon $1.9 billion so
far, according to a U.S. Transportation Department estimate.
   Exxon officials acknowledge only ``over $1 billion'' in cleanup
costs, with about a third of that covered by insurance. Exxon took
an $850 million charge against second quarter earnings to cover its
estimated out-of-pocket expenses for the spill, the worst in the
nation's history.
   Analysts say Exxon's fourth-quarter earnings, expected to be
released this week, should be in line with the overall industry,
showing lower refining, marketing and chemicals earnings and higher
results in the exploration and production sector, due largely to
higher crude oil prices.
   But Exxon could decide to take a reserve against earnings for
environmental costs associated with the most recent spill as well
as future environmental programs, said Paul Ting, analyst with
Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   ``It wouldn't be anything as big as that for the Valdez spill''
but it could affect earnings, Ting said.
   Next Monday's criminal trial of Joseph Hazelwood _ captain of
the supertanker Exxon Valdez at the time of its March 24 spill _
also could bring Exxon more negative publicity.
   Exxon has played down the financial and social impact of both
the Alaska and New York-New Jersey incidents, but analysts say
Exxon's tarnished image and the possibility of damages not covered
by insurance has made a difference to investors.
   William L. Randol, analyst for First Boston Corp., wrote in his
letter to investors late last year, ``Investors have quite rightly
avoided this stock, not because of the actual cleanup costs
involved ... but because of the unquantifiable financial threat of
billions of dollars of potential punitive damage awards stemming
from the 150 or so lawsuits filed against the company.''
   Randol said Tuesday he has upgraded his investment opinion of
Exxon to a ``buy'' from a ``hold.'' While the potential magnitude
of the lawsuits is significant, ``on the other hand Exxon may end
up paying pennies on the dollar,'' he said.
   Randol also said Exxon's stock represents good value in the long
term.
   Other analysts disagreed.
   ``I think oil stocks are going to do better, not in the very
near term, but Exxon will not be in the vanguard of that
movement,'' said Knuettel, whose investment firm continues to rate
Exxon stock a ``hold.''

   Moody's Investors Service Inc. has lowered its
credit rating for $12 billion in Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. long-term debt
because of doubts over the impact of the firm's $470 million charge
for restructuring costs.
   Merrill objected to the downgrading, saying the broad but costly
restructuring that includes layoffs and sales of some of business
would improve profitability in 1990.
   The lower credit rating is expected to increase Merrill's cost
of doing business. Borrowers with lower credit ratings must pay
higher interest rates, and financial companies rely on borrowed
money to conduct much of their business.
   ``In many of the businesses in which they operate, (profit
margins) are already quite thin, so it's not going to help during a
difficult period of time,'' said John Keefe, a securities industry
analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Merrill on Monday said it was taking a $470 million pretax
charge against fourth-quarter earnings to cover severance payments,
writedowns of existing assets, and office sales and lease payments.
   The charge gave Merrill losses of $362 million in the
fourth-quarter and $213 million for the year. It was the first
annual loss since 1971 for the nation's largest securities firm.
   Moody's said it downgraded Merrill's senior domestic debt and
European debt to a rating of A2 from its highest rating of A1.
Other long-term debt also was lowered.
   The credit rating agency said Merrill's restructuring, which is
expected to include 3,000 job cuts this year, should reduce the
firm's overhead in the future.
   But Moody's said it was ``concerned that Merrill's prospective
returns will be pressured due to the presence of considerable
overcapacity in the securities industry in both the institutional
and retail sectors.''
   Moody's also said the firm's credit standing was supported by
strong retail and institutional franchises and an ``acceptable
level'' of risk-adjusted capital.
   ``We disagree with Moody's action because we are confident that
our restructuring program will respond effectively to the adverse
industry environmental factors Moody's cited as a justification for
its action,'' Merrill said in a statement.
   ``The A1 rating that we held reflected the many financial
strengths enjoyed by Merrill Lynch,'' the firm said. ``We believe
our restructuring program will further enhance that financial
position and lead to significantly improved profitability in 1990
and beyond.''
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the second-largest Wall Street
firm, late last year avoided a downgrading being considered by
Moody's by enacting a recapitalization plan designed to raise about
$900 million.

<HEAD>Judge Enjoins Antar from Securities Violations, Orders Funds Back

   A federal judge told Eddie Antar, whose
Crazy Eddie Inc. electronics chain collapsed amid fraud charges, to
bring $52 million back to U.S. shores.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission alleges the sum is part
of more than $60 million Antar gained by selling Crazy Eddie stock
at prices falsely inflated by illegal bookkeeping.
   U.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politan said Tuesday that Antar
``was at the head of a scheme'' to overstate the company's income
from 1985 to 1987, and benefited from a higher stock price in
selling his shares.
   The judge stressed that his finding was limited only to a motion
filed by the SEC in its insider-trading lawsuit against Antar and
was not a criminal finding. The motion was to bar Antar from
violating securities laws, which Politan granted.
   The judge said he based his finding only on the record before
him, which included legal briefs and testimony by company
officials. Antar did not submit a statement.
   ``The public deserves protection from persons against whom ...
strong prima facie showings have been made of securities fraud,''
said Politan.
   He also granted the government's request to require Antar to
repatriate $52 million that he allegedly had transferred in 1987 to
bank accounts in Israel. The money is to be placed under the
supervision of a trustee. The government has said Antar transferred
as much as $68 million overseas.
   The SEC wants the money on hand in case it wins an
insider-trading case and a restitution order against Antar.
   ``It would be a compounding of a fraud to permit Mr. Antar free
reign over $60 million,'' Politan said.
   Antar, who was raised in the New York borough of Brooklyn, built
his single store there into a 43-outlet chain known through the New
York area for its loud-mouthed advertisements touting ``insane
prices!''
   The SEC accused him and other former top management of insider
trading and doctoring the company's books. The company went into
involuntary bankruptcy in October.
   Antar and former officials also face a shareholder's lawsuit in
federal court in Brooklyn, and a criminal investigation by the U.S.
attorney here.
   SEC attorney Richard Simpson said an indictment, if returned,
would not come for another three months.
   Politan put the SEC civil case on hold for the next four months.
Antar's lawyers asked for the stay because they were unsure if the
U.S. attorney would seek forfeiture of Antar's legal fees.
   Under the federal racketeering law, the government can try to
seize legal fees if they represent illegally gotten funds.
   Antar's lawyers argued that it was unfair for one branch of
government _ the Justice Department _ to seek lawyers' fees in a
criminal case, possibly depriving Antar of legal defense against a
civil lawsuit from another arm of the government _ the SEC.
   The stay prevents the SEC from interviewing Antar and his
co-defendants under oath.

   Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores
Corp. have asked a U.S. Bankruptcy judge to let them restore
benefits for 100,000 employees and draw on $700 million in credits
to help them through Chapter 11 protection.
   Carol Sanger, a Cincinnati spokeswoman for Allied and Federated,
said the companies hope for quick approval of three motions at a
hearing Thursday before Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr.
   ``Most of this is housekeeping stuff,'' Ms. Sanger said.
   The two retail divisions of Federated Stores Inc. filed the
motions seeking approval to restore employee benefits, authorize
$700 million in credit lines from two New York City banks and
resume normal credit operations at Allied.
   U.S. Trustee Conrad J. Morgenstern, who is helping steer
Federated and Allied through Chapter 11 proceedings, said the
requests appear valid.
   ``The company wants to continue to have support and the goodwill
of its employees, including those that are retired,'' Morgenstern
said. ``We think it is appropriate and customary for a company such
as this to ask for this authority.''
   The benefits for some 100,000 employees nationwide include
health and education plans, disability insurance, workers'
compensation, bonuses, drug and alcohol abuse programs and 401(k)
retirement plans.
   The retailers also want permission to reinstate the 20 percent
discounts given to retirees. Morgenstern supported that proposal
because it would generate additional sales for the companies, he
said.
   ``We hope Judge Aug is sympathetic with the argument,'' said
Mark Cohen, chairman of the Cincinnati-based Lazarus store chain.
``We have a lot of retirees, and we value their tenure. We believe
it should be restored.''
   Federated and Allied, the American retailing divisions of
Toronto-based Campeau Corp., filed Chapter 11 reorganization
petitions Jan. 15 in Cincinnati to obtain court protection from
creditors. The Cincinnati-based companies that operate nine
department store chains listed $7.5 billion in debts.
   Under the Chapter 11 proceedings, the companies must obtain the
approval of a U.S. Bankruptcy Court to pay operating expenses and
other bills.
   Morgenstern's office is assigned to assist the courts, and his
staff will attend Thursday's hearing, along with lawyers for
Federated, Allied and their creditors.
   Federated and Allied formally asked Aug to authorize $700
million in cash reserves from New York City banks. Chemical Bank
has offered a $300 million credit line _ known as
debtor-in-possession financing _ to Allied, and Citibank has
offered a $400 million line of credit to Federated.
   Another filing asks approval for normal credit operations at
Allied's stores.
   ``This simply allows the systems in place to continue
functioning,'' Ms. Sanger said. ``This allows the companies to fund
ongoing operations on a normal basis without any delays.''
   Morgenstern said he thinks Aug may give approval Thursday for
the employee benefits, but may take longer to approve the financing
requests.

<TEXT>
   High on a shelf in Christie Hefner's office,
almost lost amid the stainless steel gleam of Playboy Enterprises
Inc.'s new headquarters, sits a battered old manual typewriter.
   The machine _ the same model as the one on which Hugh Hefner
produced the first issue of Playboy magazine in 1953 _ is a link to
the past of a company that is looking excitedly toward the future.
   ``It's a reminder of our roots and a connection to the
beginning,'' Ms. Hefner said Tuesday as the Chicago-based
publishing-and-video company celebrated its move with a posh party
at the new offices.
   ``Even as we've changed the company and we're moving into new
markets, at the heart of everything is still the same commitment to
quality and entertainment we've always stood for,'' she said.
   Hugh Hefner wasn't at the invitation-only bash.
   At 63, the one-time king of the swinging singles is working on
his autobiography and settled in his Los Angeles mansion with
pregnant wife and former centerfold, Kimberley Conrad, 26.
   He still owns about 70 percent of the stock but daughter
Christie, Playboy's chairman since November 1988, has run the
company day-to-day for about eight years.
   Several Playmates were on hand at the party but the only bunny
in sight was a bronze sculpture of Playboy's rabbit-head trademark
by Chicagoan Richard Hunt, one of many artworks on display in the
new offices.
   Playboy bunnies disappeared with the last of the company's U.S.
key clubs in 1988, but Playboy has saved some of the cotton-tailed
costumes along with other icons of its hedonistic heyday.
   Joining those relics in storage next month will be the
9-foot-high Playboy sign atop the company's former skyscraper
headquarters on Chicago's Michigan Avenue.
   The new digs are slightly smaller, but the workspace is airier
and provides better opportunities for displaying works from the
company's 4,000-piece modern art collection, Ms. Hefner said.
   The new offices are on the top two floors of a 16-story downtown
building fronting on Lake Michigan, less than three blocks from the
36-story tower that housed the corporate offices for more than 22
years.
   Playboy says the move will save it $11 million over the 15-year
term of the lease.
   Ms. Hefner said the new headquarters ``make a symbolic statement
about this company being renewed, re-energized and entering another
era of creativity.''
   Playboy is indeed showing renewed vigor, 37 years after Hefner
launched the company's flesh-and-fashion flagship magazine from his
kitchen table in Chicago with a $600 investment.
   Although Playboy magazine's circulation is nowhere near its 1972
peak of 7.2 million, it has held at roughly 3.5 million for almost
five years while sales of harder-core men's magazines such as
Penthouse and Hustler have continued to fall.
   Under the direction of Ms. Hefner, 37, who became president in
1982, Playboy has made a successful push into home video, retooled
its broadcast television operations, increased product licensing
and expanded its publishing business into art prints and catalogs.
   Ever watchful for new markets, Playboy moved quickly to exploit
the democratization of Eastern Europe with a Hungarian edition of
Playboy magazine that sold out its 95,000-copy printing.
   A second Hungarian issue is on the stands.
   The company blamed restructuring costs for a $3.8 million net
loss in the fiscal year that ended June 30 after two profitable
years.
   Playboy reported a $5 million profit on revenues of $39.3
million in the first quarter of its new fiscal year, and some
analysts see growth in Playboy's future.
   ``They have an awful lot on their plate and the potential here
is quite significant,'' said analyst David Leibowitz of American
Securities Corp.

<HEAD>More Than One-Third U.S. Firms Plan to Hire Middle Managers in
1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than one-third of the nation's
companies plan to hire more middle-level managers during the first
six months of 1990, according to a private survey.
   ``It's definitely good news,'' said Nancy Kovalcheck, director
of advertising and public relations for Management Recruiters
International, Inc., which conducted the survey. ``It has never
looked better for middle management and business.
   ``In fact, if anything, there's going to be a crisis in the
1990s in finding people to fill these positions because the
unemployment rate right now for middle managers is only 1.9
percent,'' she said. ``We're creating more jobs than can be
filled.''
   According to the survey issued Tuesday, only 11.8 percent of the
2,700 executives who responded to the Management Recruiters poll
said their companies planned cutbacks during the first half of 1990.
   Another 51.6 percent told pollsters their companies would
maintain the same middle management workforce. And 36.2 percent
said they would hire middle managers during the first six months of
1990.
   The telephone survey has a margin of error of 0.5 percent,
according to Management Recruiters, the nation's largest search and
recruitment firm with offices throughout the United States. The
company has conducted similar polls for the past 24 years.
   According to the poll, the Mountain region including Nevada and
seven other states west of California had the best outlook, with
48.7 percent of the executives questioned saying they planned to
hire more middle managers in early 1990.
   That compares to 41.6 percent in the Pacific region, 35.8
percent in the Midwest, 38.9 percent in the Southwest, 33.2 percent
in the north-central states, 32.5 percent in the south-central
states, 35.3 percent in the south Atlantic region, 41.5 percent in
the middle Atlantic, and 34.5 percent in New England.

   Wall Street is turning into Mean Street for the
nation's big brokerages, and even leaner regional firms are
struggling to cope with an exodus of small investors since the 1987
stock market crash.
   A slumping stock market, declining corporate takeover activity
and faltering junk bonds point to a continuing industry shakeout
that analysts say will mean more cuts in businesses and jobs.
   The trend was dramatized by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s stunning
announcement Monday that it would spend $470 million to pay for
such cutbacks.
   Outside New York, regional brokerages are retrenching. A
190-point stock market drop in October and steady declines this
year haven't helped prospects for an industry still trying to
rebuild the trust of small investors following the 1987 crash.
   Many brokers are offering new services, such as managing the
assets of wealthy individuals or small companies, in order to stay
afloat. Some regional firms have been swallowed up or are imperiled.
   Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc., a Dallas-based brokerage, has
trimmed its retail force to 270 brokers from a peak of 350. ``Most
of those who departed simply were not making it in a tough
market,'' Sim Trotter, Rauscher Pierce's senior vice president for
marketing, said Tuesday.
   Advest Inc. last fall acquired Newhard, Cook &amp; Co., of St.
Louis. Dain Bosworth Inc. in late 1988 acquired the 100-broker
Milwaukee Co. And the 112-year-old B.C. Christopher Securities Co.
of Kansas City is suffering because of the retail industry
slowdown, analysts said.
   Still, the regional firms continue to outperform their
full-service Wall Street brethren, which expanded dramatically in
the go-go days of the mid-1980s.
   According to the Securities Industry Association, national firms
reported profits of $106 million in the first nine months of 1989,
compared to losses of $68.2 million for all of 1988 and $193
million in 1987.
   Regional firms had $165 million in profits for the nine-month
period, compared to $107 million in 1988 and $273 million in 1987.
   ``Although we are not insulated from many of the problems
affecting national brokerage firms, we have a modest and more
disciplined cost structure ..'' said Charles Hayssen, chief
financial officer of Minneapolis-based Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood
Inc., which on Tuesday reported an almost 50 percent surge in
commission revenue.
   Regional firms avoided many of the problems of Wall Street's
giants because they have low overhead and their businesses often
are limited to stockbrokering and other basic investment services.
   So-called ``full-line'' firms engage in a wide range of
activities, and many houses have relied for profits on huge fees
from investment banking services such as arranging mergers and
takeovers, which are on the decline.
   Industry analyst Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical Services
predicted brokerage firms' 1989 fourth-quarter profits would fall
40 percent to 50 percent from the third quarter _ to about $240
million from $471 million.
   In 1990, he predicted, earnings of the more than 350 New York
Stock Exchange member firms doing public business would drop as
much as 15 percent.
   ``And that's if the environment doesn't get any better,'' Long
said. ``At the rate we're going the environment is going to get
worse.''
   Merrill Lynch's record fourth-quarter charge gave the nation's
largest brokerage its first annual loss since 1971. Merrill, which
analysts considered bloated by overexpansion, plans to reduce its
staff by about 3,000 by yearend.
   Overall industry employment has shrunk by more than 35,000 jobs
since before the crash, SIA figures show.
   ``I don't think it's over,'' said Lawrence Eckenfelder of
Prudential Bache Securities Corp. in San Francisco, who expects
cuts to continue for 12 to 18 months.
   Analysts say costs remain too high for national firms such as
Merrill or Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., partly because of New York
real estate prices, high salaries and broad expansion during the
boom years. Shearson on Tuesday reported slender fourth-quarter
earnings of $3.8 million, compared to a $13 million loss a year
earlier.
   ``Wall Street is the most expensive place in the world to do
business except Tokyo,'' said Donald F. Howard, deputy chairman of
the consulting firm Gray, Judson &amp; Howard, of Cambridge, Mass.
``We're no longer in a high margin business.''
   With the exception of Merrill, Wall Street firms generally are
reporting higher profits and revenue for 1989. However, financial
statements indicate much of the gains are from interest and
commissions. Also, 1988 was a weak year for the industry.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toshiba Corp. said Wednesday it will build a new
production line to mass produce color picture tubes for
high-definition television, which brings motion picture sharpness
to television images.
   Masao Mochizuki, spokesman for Toshiba, said his company would
be the first to launch mass-production of HDTV picture tubes in
Japan, though some other consumer products makers are producing
them on a trial basis.
   The applications of HDTV technology, pioneered in Japan, range
from entertainment to medicine to national defense radar systems.
   At its plant in Himeji, 360 miles west of Tokyo, Toshiba will
invest the equivalent of $36 million for new production lines
scheduled to begin operation in August, Mochizuki said.
   He said Toshiba initially would produce 200 HDTV picture tubes a
month _ 32-inch and 36-inch tubes for home use, and 36-inch tubes
for business purposes.
   Mochizuki declined to estimate the cost of a monitor with a
high-definition tube, but it has been estimated that HDTV sets
would cost between $34,000 and $54,000 in Japan.
   Regular HDTV broadcasting is scheduled to start by the end of
this year, and the demand for next-generation television sets is
expected to grow steadily, Toshiba said.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Overturns Verdict Against Polaroid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals has overturned a verdict
that might have cost the Polaroid Corp. $30 million in payments to
shareholders in a case involving the failure of Polavision, an
instant movie system.
   The three-judge court cited errors by the trial judge, including
incorrect instructions to the jury, in overturning the 1987 verdict.
   In a suit by investor Irving Backman, Boston attorney Thomas
Shapiro argued that Polaroid founder Edwin Land and company
executive Julius Silver sold stock in 1979 knowing that Polaroid
stock was high at the time because of the undisclosed failure of
Polavision technology.
   Polavision was a $68 million failure and was withdrawn from the
market in 1979.
   Land and Silver settled with Backman out of court, but in July
1987, a jury found Polaroid liable for damages to shareholders
equal to $9.75 a share.
   A Polaroid spokesman said Tuesday the company had not seen the
ruling and could not comment. The Boston Globe said Shapiro was out
of town and neither he nor Land, who is retired, could be reached
for comment.

   Congress' budget experts said today that
lawmakers and President Bush will need to find $74 billion in
savings to meet next year's deficit target.
   The estimate by the Congressional Budget Office, made to the
Senate Budget Committee, is more than double the amount the
administration is expected to say it needs in savings.
   It also continues a long tradition of disagreeing deficit
forecasts between the two branches.
   Bush submits his fiscal 1991 budget to Congress on Monday. He is
expected to say $30 billion to $35 billion in new revenues and
spending cuts are needed to meet the $64 billion deficit target
mandated by the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law.
   The report by CBO _ Congress' fiscal analysis arm _ projects a
$138 billion deficit for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, unless
savings are found. Bush is expected to ask for $1.23 trillion in
spending for next year.
   The CBO report contains even more bad news for the future.
   Gramm-Rudman requires declining deficits every year until 1993,
when the budget is required to be balanced.
   But according to CBO, deficits are projected to be $135 billion
in 1992 and $141 billion in 1993, declining slowly over the next
two years.
   ``Without spending cuts or tax increases, the deficit in 1993 is
likely to be no lower than in 1990,'' CBO Director Robert D.
Reischauer told senators.
   The huge difference between the CBO projections and the
administration's numbers are due to differing expectations about
economic performance.
   The White House Office of Management and Budget is expected to
forecast that the economy will expand this year by about 2.6
percent, measured from the fourth quarter of last year through the
third quarter of 1990. CBO's projection is 1.8 percent.
   As a rule of thumb, every 1 percentage point in economic growth
adds $25 billion to federal revenue collections, because a
healthier economy means more robust tax collections.
   Fifty-one private economists surveyed by Blue Chip Economic
Indicators, a private publication, have projected that the economy
will expand by an average of 1.7 percent this year. That would be
the slowest U.S. economic growth since 1982.
   By law, the administration's shortfall forecast is binding,
leaving the CBO figures little more than advisory. But the
projections by the non-partisan CBO are considered by many
lawmakers and budget observers to be more reliable than those from
the White House.
   Under Gramm-Rudman, automatic spending cuts are triggered in
most federal programs should Congress and the president fail to
agree to savings that meet the deficit target. That happened last
fall, but a compromise between Bush and Congress was enacted that
will lift the cuts early next month.
   The deficit targets set by Gramm-Rudman, however, apply only to
the coming fiscal year. The law sets no penalties if the actual
deficit ends up exceeding the legal target, an eventuality that has
occurred every year since Gramm-Rudman was enacted in 1985.
   Meanwhile, the Treasury Department announced Tuesday that the
budget deficit grew by $14.64 billion in December, bringing the
total shortfall for the first three months of the 1990 fiscal year
to $69.69 billion.
   That is more than two-thirds the $100 billion deficit that
Gramm-Rudman permits for the entire year and compared with a $67.58
billion deficit for the first quarter of fiscal 1989.

   A new wave of selling swept throught the stock
market today, extending Wall Street's early-1990 slide as worries
mounted about rising interest rates and pressure on the Japanese
market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 194.83 points over
the past three weeks, fell another 61.49 to 2,553.83 in the first
half hour of trading.
   Losers overwhelmed gainers by about 16 to 1 in the early tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 68 up, 1,087 down
and 224 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 39.25 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Traders learned overnight of a sharp decline in the Tokyo stock
market, which has been unsettled lately by rising interest rates in
Japan.
   Analysts said that intensified fears that rates would have to
climb further in this country to stay competitive in the
international marketplace.
   A sale by the government Tuesday of 40-year bonds to finance a
rescue plan for troubled thrift institutions drew a very chilly
reception from investors.
   As the outlook for interest rates has worsened, investors have
begun to face the possibility that the recent slowdown of the
economy might deepen in the months ahead.
   Brokers also said a weak attempt by stocks to rally on Tuesday
left many traders unimpressed and disheartened.
   Losers among the blue chips included Merck, down 2 at 69~;
International Business Machines, down 1&lsqb; at 95|; General Electric,
down 1{ at 61\, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down ~ at 39~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
tumbled 3.87 to 179.73. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 5.95 at 353.75.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.87 to
2,615.32.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 5 to 4 on the
NYSE, with 659 stocks up, 848 down and 471 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 179.30 million shares, against 148.38

<HEAD>Mazda May Produce Compact Cars With Ford In West Germany</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Rewrites to CORRECT reference that Mazda is first Japanese
automaker to gain manufacturing presence on European continent.
Minor editing throughout.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mazda Motor Co. and Ford Motor Co. plan a joint
venture to produce compact cars in Europe based on existing Mazda
models, a Mazda official said.
   Japan's fourth-largest automaker and its U.S. partner expect to
produce the cars in Saarlouis in southwestern West Germany, said a
Mazda official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He declined to
say whether the venture would build a new factory or use an
existing Ford plant.
   ``We'd thought about Belgium, England, Spain and West Germany,
and West Germany seems to be the best,'' he said.
   Mazda and Ford will produce cars similar to two existing Mazda
models, Familia and Capella, the official said.
   Japanese automakers currently don't have any factories on the
European continent, although Nissan began producing small cars in
Britain in 1986 and Toyota and Honda plan to begin producing cars
in Britain in 1992.
   ``West Germany is an important place in many ways. It has a lot
of know-how in technology and designs that we can learn, for
instance,'' the Mazda official said.
   Mazda and Ford have a long partnership in finance and
technology, and Ford owns more than a 23 percent of Mazda's stock.
   Local media reported Mazda and Ford are to produce 120,000 cars
beginning in 1992, with each company selling 60,000 cars each.
Mazda reportedly is to invest some 50 million yen in the project.
   Bert Serre, director of international public affairs at Ford in
Michigan, said he couldn't confirm the reports.
   ``Nothing has been agreed on. We have had discussion with Mazda,
they are partners of ours,'' he said. ``Nothing has been
finalized.''
   The Mazda official said the two sides are negotiating details of
the plan. The amount of investment could be smaller than reported,
and production also may not come as early as 1992, he said.
   ``Since our exports to Europe are still growing, we'd like to
decide on the amount of local production in West Germany so that it
will not harm the exports,'' the official said.
   In 1989, Mazda exported 288,475 cars to Europe, including
Familia and Capella, according to Mazda.
   Nihon Keizai Shimbun, an economic newspaper, said the American
and Japanese automakers chose West Germany because it is the best
place to obtain access to the Eastern bloc, which is seen as a big
market in the future following the recent democratization movements
there.
   The venture would make Mazda among the first Japanese automakers
to gain a manufacturing presence on the European continent. Ford
already is one of the biggest automakers in the European market.
   Suzuki Motor Co., Japan's largest minicar producer, announced
Jan. 9 that it has reached an agreement with Hungary to set up a
joint venture car plant near Budapest.

<HEAD>Santa Fe Plans Reducing Payroll by 2,700 Jobs Over Five Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Santa Fe Pacific Corp. plans to reduce employment
on its railroad by 2,700 jobs over five years, officials of the
company say.
   The reductions would take place through job buyouts, attrition
and possible layoffs, and would affect both union and white-collar
workers, said Robert Gerht, spokesman for Chicago-based Santa Fe.
   The cuts would likely affect Santa Fe Railway across its
11,500-mile system, officials said.
   There is no specific timetable for the cuts, which would reduce
employment with the railroad from the current 18,000 to about
15,300, according to the company.
   ``Some buyouts will be voluntary and some won't,'' Gerht said.
``This is part of an overall plan to make the railroad more
efficient and competitive.''
   In a statement issued Tuesday, Santa Fe Pacific Corp., parent
company of the railroad, said it lost $209.4 million, or $1.33 a
share, in the fourth quarter because of a charge taken to establish
reserves for covering costs of the workforce reduction and other
railway restructurings. The pre-tax charge totaled $389.6 million.
   The quarterly loss compared with net income of $156.1 million,
or 99 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1988, reflecting a
$136 million gain on the sale of a portion of the company's
pipeline operations.
   The railway actually had an ``excellent quarter'' to finish out
1989, said Robert Krebs, chairman and president of Santa Fe
Pacific. If not for the charge, he said, the railway would have
reported a 40 percent increase in operating income.
   Santa Fe Railway reported fourth-quarter operating income of $67
million before the restructuring costs, up from $47.7 million a
year earlier.
   For the year, Santa Fe Pacific reported net income of $14.6
million, or 9 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $46.5
million, or 30 cents a share, in 1988.
   The Santa Fe Railway has been steadily reducing employment for
several years. About three years ago, it took 85 crew members to
run a Santa Fe train from Chicago to Los Angeles. The railroad
currently uses 40 crew members on the same run, and company
officials expect to cut that number to about 30, Gehrt said.
   Company officials said that the proposed union job cuts are
provided for in recently negotiated labor contracts with some units
of the United Transportation Union and the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers. The railroad is negotiating to reach similar
agreements with other bargaining units, officials said.

   A top regulator told Congress today that
President Bush's $50 billion bailout of the savings and loan
industry is ``probably too low.''
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. and chairman of the new bailout agency, the Resolution Trust
Corp., said the money provided in legislation last August would be
adequate only if the government seized no more than an additional
$40 billion worth of S&amp;Ls.
   As of Jan. 16, the RTC had seized 333 institutions with assets
totaling $136 billion. The loss on those is about $42 billion, he
said.
   However, the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision
is predicting that another 225 to 295 institutions, with assets of
$160 billion to $200 billion, will fail.
   ``We have found no reason to question the reasonableness of
(those) estimates,'' Seidman told the House Banking Committee.
   ``The likely size of the loss, $50 billion as provided (by the
S&amp;L bill) ... is probably too low a figure,'' he said.
   However, he added, ``it is very difficult to provide a more
definitive number'' and said ``under any scenario, the $50 billion
... should, as far as losses are concerned, carry the RTC into
1991.''
   Seidman went a step beyond testimony on Tuesday from Deputy
Treasury Secretary John E. Robson, who said, ``I can't tell you
with certainty that the $50 billion is going to be enough.''
   On Tuesday, Robson said the thrift office was compiling a new
``watch list'' of weak S&amp;Ls which ``may indicate resolution costs
beyond the original estimates.''
   Robson was representing an administration oversight board which
controls the purse strings and policy of the bailout. Also
appearing were oversight board members Alan Greenspan, chairman of
the Federal Reserve Board, and Jack Kemp, secretary of housing.
   In other S&amp;L developments Tuesday:
   _The House committee subpoenaed financier Michael Milken to
testify in its investigation of the role of junk bonds in the
collapse of Charles H. Keating Jr.'s Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association of Irvine, Calif., and other thrifts. A spokesman for
Milken declined comment.
   The former junk bond trading chief for Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. is expected to stand trial later this year on securities fraud
charges. In April 1988, he invoked his constitutional protection
against self-incrimination to avoid testifying to Congress.
   Also subpoenaed were Ernest Garcia and Fernando Acosta, Arizona
businessmen involved in land deals with Lincoln.
   _The government sold $5 billion in 40-year bonds to finance its
bailout of the savings and loan industry, the first time in 35
years it has sold paper of more than 30 years' maturity. The bonds,
issued by the Resolution Funding Corp., sold at an average yield of
8.6 percent. With Tuesday's sale, the government has now raised
$29.5 billion to finance the cleanup.
   _The Office of Thrift Supervision penalized a fifth officer of
the failed Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association, Denver.
But it postponed for up to 10 days a decision on Neil Bush, the
president's son, who had served as a director of the failed thrift.
   Russell M. Murray, former executive vice president of Silverado,
agreed to an order prohibiting him from working for a federally
insured financial institution without advance permission from
regulators.
   _The thrift office suspended trading of stock in CenTrust
Savings Bank of Miami, Florida's largest S&amp;L. Regulators levied the
one-week suspension after accusing the thrift of filing misleading
and inaccurate financial reports. Analysts say the thrift, which
invested deposits in an expensive art collection, is close to being
seized by regulators.
   Private analysts and some members of Congress have been saying
for months that the $50 billion will amount to little more than a
down payment on the cost of resolving the nation's worst financial
problem since the Depression.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Steady After Lower Opening</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
rebounding after an opening decline linked to stock-market jitters.
   Analysts said grain traders focused on the stock market amid a
dearth of significant supply-and-demand news in the grain markets.
   ``There's no big feature overall,'' said analyst Dale Gustafson
of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   Grain and soybean futures opened slightly lower across the board
in brisk trading after the stock market's opening dive of more than
60 points in the Dow Jones industrial average.
   But crop futures recovered as the stock market steadied. The Dow
was down about 50 points at 11 a.m. EST.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to 1 cent higher
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.93 a bushel; corn
futures were \ cent to } cent higher with March at $2.41{ a bushel;
oats were 1 cent to 1{ cents higher wiith March at $1.39{ a bushel;
soybean futures were { cent to 2\ cents higher with March at $5.69{
a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange ahead of this afternoon's quarterly
Agriculture Department cattle-on-feed report.
   The report is expected to show a slight increase in the number
of cattle on feedlots being fattened for slaughter.
   Live cattle futures were .17 cent to .38 cent lower with the
contract for delivery in February at 78.30 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .12 cent to .45 cent lower with January at 84.30 cents
a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .52 cent lower with February at
49.35 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .75 cent to 1.10
cents lower with February at 55.60 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mostly lower on Tuesday while pork
futures were mixed.

<HEAD>Aeroflot Orders First Western Commercial Jets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOULOUSE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In its first purchase of Western
commercial aircraft, the Soviet airline Aeroflot has ordered five
Airbus A310-300 wide-bodied jets, Airbus Industrie said Wednesday.
   Officials of Airbus, a Western European aircraft manufacturing
consortium, declined to disclose the value of the order. Aircraft
industry sources said the contract is worth abut $310 million.
   Airbus Managing Director Jean Pierson said the Aeroflot order
represents ``the new kind of relations between Eastern Europe and
Western Europe.''
   State-owned Aeroflot also has taken an option to buy five
additional Airbus jets, Airbus officials said. Each plane can carry
195 passengers.
   The planes will be delivered between November 1991 and June 1992
and will be used for Aeroflot's flights between the Soviet Union
and the Far East, Europe and North America.
   Alexander Aksenov, the Soviet Union's civil aviation vice
minister, told reporters in Toulouse that Aeroflot is holding talks
with Western European airlines on a maintenance contract for the
new jets.
   A full maintenance base in the Soviet Union would be
uneconomical for such a small number of planes, he said.
   Aeroflot must still choose between General Electric or Pratt and
Whitney engines to power the aircraft.
   Airbus already has sold jets to two Eastern European airlines.
East Germany's Interflug has taken delivery of three A310-300s and
has another three on order, while the Czech airline Ceskoslovenske
Aeroline has ordered two A310-300s.
   Airbus, based in Toulouse, is comprised of Aerospatiale of
France, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GMBH of West Germany, British
Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.

   The stock market suffered another broad setback
today, extending Wall Street's early-1990 slide as worries mounted
about rising interest rates and pressure on the Japanese market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 194.83 points over
the past three weeks, fell another 43.92 to 2,571.40 by noontime on
Wall Street.
   Losers overwhelmed gainers by about 12 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 129 up,
1,420 down and 265 unchanged.
   Traders learned overnight of a sharp decline in the Tokyo stock
market, which has been unsettled lately by rising interest rates in
Japan.
   Analysts said that intensified fears that rates would have to
climb further in this country to stay competitive in the
international marketplace.
   A sale by the government Tuesday of 40-year bonds to finance a
rescue plan for troubled thrift institutions drew a very chilly
reception from investors.
   As the outlook for interest rates has worsened, investors have
begun to face the possibility that the recent slowdown of the
economy might deepen in the months ahead.
   Brokers also said a weak attempt by stocks to rally on Tuesday
left many traders unimpressed and disheartened.
   Losers among the blue chips included Merck, down 1\ at 70|;
Philip Morris, down | at 37&lsqb;; General Electric, down 1 at 61}; USX,
down { at 33\, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down { at 40\.
   Precious-metals issues provided one of the market's few pockets
of strength. ASA Ltd. gained 1{ to 65; Homestake Mining } to 23&lsqb;,
and Newmont Gold 1\ to 54&rsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
tumbled 2.99 to 180.61. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 6.24 at 353.49.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 111.98 million shares at

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Mercantile Exchange and the
Commodity Exchange Inc. said today they would pursue merger
negotiations and announced the formation of a joint board that
would govern a consolidated entity.
   The exchanges issued a statement saying that the executive
committees from Nymex and Comex met Tuesday and agreed to form the
joint governing board.
   The exchanges also said the respective boards instructed their
executive committees ``to pursue further negotiations with the
intent of devising a means by which the administration and
operations of the two exchanges could be consolidated most
efficiently.''
   ``Essentially they've agreed on a governing body if there would
be a merger and the two executive committees are going to continue
talks,'' said Nymex spokeswoman Nachamah Jacobovits.
   Spokespeople for both exchanges refused to say why the markets
were considering a merger or what the benefits of such a
consolidation would be.
   The two exchanges reportedly have discussed the possibility of a
merger several times over the last decade.
   Nymex and Comex, which have been housed in the same lower
Manhattan facility since 1933, trade a variety of commodities,
including oil, gold, silver, copper and aluminum.
   The joint body will include a chairman who is a Nymex member, a
vice chairman who is a Comex member, 16 Nymex member directors,
eight Comex member directors and six public directors.
   ``Many of the terms upon which the consolidation would occur,
including the extent and basis upon which either exchange's liquid
capital reserves would be made available to the consolidated
entity, remain to be determined,'' the statement read.
   The two exchanges also said any agreement reached by the
executive committees and board is subject to membership and
regulatory approval.
   Nymex, the largest energy exchange, trades crude oil, heating
oil, unleaded gasoline, residual fuel oil, propane, platinum and
palladium futures.
   Comex, the most active metals exchange, trades gold, silver,
copper and aluminum futures. Comex traded 19 million contracts in
1989, while Nymex traded 38.5 million.
   A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a fixed amount
of a commodity or instrument at a set price on a future date.

<HEAD>Many Lenders Tightening Home Equity Credit In Face of Housing
Slump</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The owner of a Denver printing company surrenders the keys of
his two-bedroom condominum to a lender because the unit's net value
is far less than the balance of a second mortgage.
   A government employee in Florida worries he won't have enough
money after lowering the selling price on his house to repay a
home-equity loan plus put a down payment on new property.
   The slumped housing market not only is erasing homeseller
profits, it's beginning to put a damper on the $111 billion
industry for home-equity loans and lines of credit _ which only a
few years ago ballooned into one of the nation's most popular forms
of borrowing.
   Peddled by bankers eager to lend money, these loans have been
used by homeowners to finance everything from vacations to college
for the kids, backed by the properties themselves as collateral.
   They are especially popular because the interest generally is
deductible under the 1986 tax reform, which is phasing out the
deductibility of other consumer loans. The rates also are much
lower compared with personal loans.
   Borrowing against the house remains a convenient way to tap into
one of the nation's greatest pools of wealth _ an estimated $4.5
trillion in homeowner equity. But eroding housing prices in many
parts of the country have reduced some of that equity, limiting
homeowners' borrowing power and leaving some past borrowers with
more loan than equity, experts say.
   As a result, some banks, thrifts and other lenders have
tightened their credit policies, and at least one expert predicts a
significant number may start to flee the home-equity business this
year.
   ``I think more people will be looking at their homes as shelter
than as an investment,'' said A. Gary Shilling, head a New York
economics firm that bears his name. ``They thought they had this
never-ending appreciating asset that they could tap, but it's not.''
   Ken K., a Denver printer who preferred not to reveal his last
name for publication, found that out the hard way.
   He said he recently returned to a lender the two-bedroom condo
bought as an investment five years ago after the balance on a
second loan came due. Since the condo's market value had fallen to
around $30,000 from the $52,500 purchase price, he realized that
even by selling the condo he couldn't come up with the $9,000
needed to repay the lender.
   The situation isn't quite as grim for a Florida government
official, who also wished to remain anonymous. However, he is
concerned that by consistently lowering the $200,000 asking price
of his home, there'll be little left to put a deposit on another
house and repay a $25,000 home-equity credit line.
   Despite these types of problems, many financial institutions
remain optimistic about home-equity loans, noting that defaults
remain relatively rare and prudent credit policies should forestall
serious defaults.
   The American Bankers Association said that in 1988, the last
year for which complete data was available, losses from home equity
loan defaults among all commercial banks totaled $220 million.
That's considered negligible compared with the billions in
potentially bad Third World loans, for example.
   Some delinquency rates, however, have risen. At the end of the
third quarter of last year 0.93 percent of all open-end credit
lines were delinquent, or at least 30 days past due, up from 0.86
percent the same time in 1988, ABA figures show. The delinquency
rate on closed-end loans was 1.69 percent in the third quarter,
down from 1.76 percent, it said.
   An open, or revolving line of credit, lets borrowers set aside
an amount of money to be used when needed. A closed-end loan, or
second mortgage, provides a fixed dollar amount.
   A softer real-estate market, coupled with a rise in delinquency
rates, has prompted many lenders to emphasize borrowers' ability to
repay rather than a home's appraised value.
   ``A home equity loan is more a personal loan than a real estate
loan,'' said Paul Fritts, director of the division of supervision
at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ``Unless you have good solid
equity together with a good work record ... I think it will be more
difficult to get those loans.''
   Fritts said some banks that may have taken a chance on
homeowners who were considered riskier than average when housing
values rose are rejecting their loan applications now.
   A few bankers said privately that they've started restricting
home equity credit lines and loans mainly to homeowners on which
they hold the primary mortgage or to longstanding customers with
reputable credit histories.
   Banks also are less likely to lend beyond their standard credit
limits, which typically run to about 80 percent of the available
equity in a home, Fritts said. When housing values were firmer, a
few banks extended credit to as much as 90 percent, he said.
   At Connecticut National Bank in Hartford, the maximum credit
limit was trimmed several weeks ago partly because ``we saw that
the New England real estate market was starting to soften,'' said
Donald Grigley, who's in charge of the bank's installment finance
businesses. He said that although losses from defaults remain low,
the bank had noticed a slight increase in late payments.
   Frequent late payments will prompt lenders to review a loan
contract and borrowers' credit record, and in some cases, to order
a reappraisal of the property used as collateral.
   However, as long as borrowers pay on time they have little to
worry about, even if the balance exceeds the equity in their home
because of declining real estate prices, experts say.
   Still, Paul Havemann, a vice president at Butler, N.J.-based HSH
Associates, which publishes mortgage market information, predicts
the housing slump will help prompt some lenders to stop offering
home-equity credit altogether this year.
   Havemann said he already has seen some signs of a pullout. It's
harder to find lenders in the home equity business for his monthly
survey of rates.

<TEXT>
   Three indicted traders from the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange say the FBI came to their homes and coerced
them into giving incriminating statements during a government probe
of the futures industry.
   Sam Cali, Robert Bailin and John Baker, all traders in the
Merc's Japanese yen pits, say armed FBI agents came to their homes
and threatened to arrest them and take their property if they
refused to cooperate.
   Assistant U.S. Attorneys Mark Pollack and Daniel Gillogly, who
were present for part of the interviews with the men, have labeled
the charges ``false and outlandish.''
   U.S. District Judge William T. Hart was expected to begin taking
evidence today to determine which view would prevail.
   Defense attorneys have asked for the pretrial hearing in an
effort to keep prosecutors from presenting the contents of the
interviews to a jury when the men go to trial April 23 with 14
other yen traders. The traders' allegations were made in pretrial
motions filed by the three men, the Chicago Tribune reported in
today's editions.
   The traders were charged with racketeering Aug. 2 in the
government's first round of indictments stemming from the
investigation of alleged improper trading practices at the Merc and
the Chicago Board of Trade. Four of the yen traders have pleaded
guilty and have agreed to testify against others.
   Cali, Bailin and Baker have pleaded innocent.

   Interior Secretary Manual Lujan, in a bid to
end a decade-old battle with environmental groups, agreed today to
create a new computer system to make it easier for the government
to suspend coal mining permits issued to past violators of the 1977
strip mining law.
   Interior Department officials said the agreement signals a new
and more cooperative approach to the concerns of environmentalists
on the part of President Bush and his administration.
   In the exchange for the dropping of a law suit, Lujan agreed to
a detailed ``work plan'' to improve the computerized Applicant
Violator System maintained by the department's Office of Surface
Mining.
   The system has been widely regarded as a failure.
   ``Our aim is fair, even-handed enforcement of the surface mining
law,'' Lujan said in a statement. ``This new agreement underscores
our willingness to cooperate with citizen groups and the Congress
in seeing that the law is enforced consistently and effectively.''
   At the same time, Lujan said, ``this settlement does not go
beyond the law's requirements, or compromise coal mine operators'
entitlement to due process of the law.''
   The agreement, worked out in intense negotiating sessions
beginning last September, is aimed at creating a computer system
that will accurately match previous violators of the law with
applicants for new coal mining permits.
   Brent Rushforth, an attorney for Save Our Cumberland Mountains,
a principal plaintiff in the case, told reporters: ``This agreement
goes further than ever before to assure that the information is
accurate and that permits issued to violators can be suspended.''
   ``It doesn't go beyond the law; it implements the law,''
Rushforth said.
   Filed in 1980, the suit arose out of the conviction of many
residents of the coal mining regions of Appalachia that strip
mining laws were going unenforced.
   An initial settlement was reached in 1981 after a court order
directed the Interior Department to install a computer system to
match past violators with new coal mining applicants.
   Critics complained some strip mine operators found to have
violated the law simply changed the name of their companies and
applied for a new permit at another location.
   Many such operators were failing to comply with requirements
that the land be restored after the mining was completed, the
critics said.
   Installation of the computer system did not end complaints.
   Environmentalists contended the system proved wholly ineffective
in preventing the issuance of new permits to past violators.
   Early last year, the Save Our Cumberland Mountains organization
sought to have a judge hold the Interior Department in contempt of
court for allegedly failing to comply with the earlier court order
that it strictly enforce the surface mining law.

   The U.S. dollar tumbled against all major foreign
currencies, except the Canadian dollar, in hectic European trading
Wednesday in the wake of lower stock prices.
   Gold prices jumped about $11 an ounce in active trading after
several large purchases triggered a wave of technical buying.
   Traders said the dollar dropped sharply in reaction to weakness
on Wall Street, but recovered some of its early losses as U.S.
stock prices recovered.
   ``The market is overreacting to movement in the equity markets
because there is no other news and no clear direction,'' said one
corporate dealer in London.
   Another London trader said: ``The dollar has fallen a long way
on very little.''
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6555 from $1.6480 late
Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates were: 1.6855 West German marks, down from 1.6965; 1.4975
Swiss francs, down from 1.5070; 5.7305 French francs, down from
5.7625; 1.8975 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9225; 1,255.75 Italian
lire, down from 1,262.00; and 1.1852 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1780.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 145.80 Japanese yen from
146.33 yen at Tuesday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 145.35
yen.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $421.50 a troy ounce,
up from $413 late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid of $420 dollars, up
from $408.50 late Tuesday.
   The Hong Kong gold market was closed for the Lunar New Year
holidays.
   Silver rose in London to a late bid price of $5.34 a troy ounce,
up from $5.32 late Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Baker Hughes Inc., an oil tool maker, posted a 46
percent quarterly profit gain, despite a worldwide decrease in
drilling activity, the company announced Wednesday.
   Earnings for the three months ended Dec. 31, the company's first
fiscal quarter, were $25.4 million, or 20 cents a share, on revenue
of $579 million, compared with earnings of $17.4 million, or 13
cents per share, on revenue of $566 million a year earlier.
   ``The increase in revenues in the first quarter of 1990 was
achieved despite a 1.6 percent decrease in worldwide drilling
activity,'' said J.D. Woods, Baker Hughes' chairman, president and
chief executive officer.
   ``Additionally, the year earlier quarter included revenues of
$57.8 million from mining equipment operations which were sold in
July 1989. The increase in earnings was a result of the continuing
favorable mix in the oilfield operations as well as significant
improvement in the quality of revenues in Baker Hughes process
equipment.''
   Woods said the progress of the previously announced acquisition
of Eastman Christensen Co. is on schedule and expected to be
completed by March 31.
   ``The acquisition of Eastman Christensen will allow Baker Hughes
to be a prominent participant in the rapidly growing high
performance directional drilling markets, which will benefit the
company, its stockholders and the community.''
   Houston-based Baker Hughes also is noted for keeping a
nationwide count of drilling rig activity.

   U S West Inc. reported an increase in
fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday, but said profit for the regional
phone company dropped slightly for all of 1989.
   ``We ended the year on a very positive note financially, and as
a whole,'' said Jack MacAllister, chairman and chief executive
officer. ``Our business is more exciting than it's ever been _
we're truly becoming a global communications company.''
   In the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 31, U S West reported
net income of $344.4 million, or $1.84 a share, compared with the
1988 fourth-quarter net income of $271.7 million, or $1.49 per
share.
   Fourth-quarter revenue totaled $2.5 billion, compared with
revenue of $2.3 billion in 1988's fourth quarter.
   The results for the 1989 quarter were due to increased revenue
from local phone operations, long-distance service, cellular and
paging operations and the company's directory publishing operation,
the company said. It also said it benefitted from a property sale
and a change in accounting for income taxes.
   For the year, the company's net income totaled $1.11 billion, or
$6.02 a share, compared with $1.13 billion, or $6.17 per share, in
1988.
   Revenue for 1989 totaled $9.7 billion, up from $9.2 billion in
1988.
   The 1988 results include a non-recurring after-tax gain of $88.7
million, or 4tials Unlimited Inc. of Grand Rapids, which claims
to be the biggest, and Midwest Research Inc. of Walled Lake, a
Detroit suburb.
   The industry's premise is that we can recognize information
presented below our threshold of awareness. Even though the
listener hears only soothing music or the sound of ocean waves on
an audio cassette or sees images of nature on a video, the
subconscious mind can detect the hundreds or thousands of
speeded-up, underlying subliminal suggestions, manufacturers say.
   Mind Communication offers about 300 titles by direct mail,
ranging from weight loss and improving sex _ two of the biggest
sellers _ to controlling spending habits and becoming a better
bowler. There are tapes designed for children to build self-esteem
or stop bedwetting.
   Subliminals have been raising eyebrows since the 1950s, when it
was reported that by flashing ``eat popcorn'' during a movie,
theatergoers rushed for the concession stand, unaware they had been
subliminally persuaded.
   In recent years, it appears millions of consumers have brushed
aside the diabolic connotations associated with mind control and
comparisons to Big Brother while they plunk down $10 to $40 for
what manufacturers market as a shortcut for solving problems and
breaking bad habits.
   The 60-minute tapes, most of which provide a script of their
messages, are prominently displayed near self-help books in
national bookstore chains. Such publishing companies as Simon &amp;
Schuster, Random House and Bantam Books recently have devised their
own versions.
   Many respected researchers accept the validity of subliminal
perception, but claim there is no proof that these self-help tapes
work.
   ``They're a waste of time and money,'' said Howard Shevrin, a
University of Michigan psychologist who's been involved in
subliminal research for more than 30 years. Shevrin said even if
there was a behavioral change in some people it would be impossible
to trace it to the tapes.
   Shevrin suggests the possibility of harmful side effects in some
people, a theory with which Tuthill agrees.
   ``Theoretically, they could be harmful with forced prolonged
exposure,'' Tuthill said. ``If the message is noxious or contrary
to what you want, people have actually developed some bizarre
symptoms.''
   Tuthill said he has seen a smoker develop headaches and heart
palpitations when exposed to a stop-smoking tape. The symptoms
stopped when the person stopped listening to the music. Tuthill
even puts warning labels on his weight loss tapes because of
reports from pediatricians that children inadvertently exposed to
the tapes were losing weight.
   Barrie Konicov, owner of the 14-year-old Potentials Unlimited,
has among his 200 titles Bust Enlargement and Birth Control (``If
you create a thought that you will not get pregnant, you will not
get pregnant,'' is one message.)
   A 1981 raid by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration forced
Konicov to soften his medical claims. He stands by his tapes, 1
million to 2 million copies of which sell each year worldwide in
such bookstore chains as B. Dalton, WaldenBooks and Barnes &amp; Noble.
   ``Look, it's a $10 tape,'' he said, adding that the company
offers a money-back guarantee. ``Nobody questions what we do.''
   Though the field is largely unregulated, the Texas Attorney
General's office confirmed it is investigating claims made by
several such companies.
   The use of such tapes by retailers to cut shoplifting or by
employers to increase production of unsuspecting employees has
raised ethical questions. Tuthill's biggest customers are
retailers, but he said he has turned down requests from auto
dealers and political candidates.
   While many of the companies cite self-conducted studies, little
independent research has been done in the area of self-help
subliminals. Most of the companies point to individual testimonials
as proof of their effectiveness.
   Two Canadian psychology professors who have done independent
research call the tapes a health fraud.
   Timothy Moore of York University's Glendon College in Toronto
said some of the tapes he has studied apparently contain no hidden
message at all.
   Philip Merikle of the University of Waterloo in Ontario said an
analysis of tapes made by several companies found there is no
identifiable signal on them that could penetrate the subconscious.
   He likened the amazing success stories to placebos.
   ``We've known for hundreds of years that effective treatments
are ones that people believe are going to work,'' he said. But
subliminal tapes, he concluded, ``are clearly health fraud.
   ``It's not inconceivable that 20 to 30 percent of these people
could report real improvement, but not for the reasons used by the
manufacturers,'' he said. ``But if 25 percent of the people who
listen to these tapes stop smoking, that's great. That's also the
irony of it.''

<HEAD>Corporate America Develops New Product: An Inner-City School</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra. Also on general news wires.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Phyllis Pelt's workday is consumed by the grim
realities of the ghetto: the evicted family, the girl who goes
hungry, the boy whose mother was murdered. It's part of life as a
school nurse.
   Only minutes and miles away, Chuck Ruder's day on the 51st floor
of the sleek Sears Tower is devoted to the fast pace and steady
pressures of retail and finance. It's part of life in the Fortune
500.
   Little children and big business, rich and poor, two worlds
seemingly destined to remain apart. Instead, they've united in an
experiment in which corporate America's money, muscle and
management are being used to develop a desperately needed product:
academic success in the inner city.
   The Corporate-Community Schools of America is a tuition-free
academy created, guided and financed by United Airlines, Baxter
International, Sears, Quaker Oats, McDonald's and other
Chicago-area powerhouses that donate dollars and sense to matters
ranging from purchasing to personnel.
   ``We must manage our schools as we manage our major corporations
_ with accountability, responsibility, skilled, talented, paid
people,'' said school founder Joe Kellman. ``If there was a profit
motive ... is there any doubt IBM, General Motors and Sears Roebuck
would be in the school business?
   ``If you try to run major city school systems with volunteers
that have no skill, get no money and have no time, then you get
what you've got _ bankrupt systems,'' he said.
   Big city education is a billion-dollar business, Kellman says,
so who better to oversee it than experienced executives such as
Ruder, from Sears? He's among seven corporate board members; eight
others are area residents or educators.
   Such partnerships aren't new. America's corporations have poured
millions into education programs ranging from adopt-a-school
systems to guaranteed jobs. Organizers say this is different.
   ``They're supporting and assisting; we're building,'' said Bud
Kraus, assistant to the chairman and chief executive officer at
Baxter, a medical and hospital supply company.
   The 1{-year-old private academy, in predominantly black
Lawndale, one of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods, is designed to be
a lab to find ways to teach inner-city children, then duplicate the
process in urban areas nationwide.
   ``We're looking to influence change in the system, not educate
300 kids,'' Kraus said.
   The school's small size and independence set it apart. Unlike
urban systems, there are no powerful unions, no tangled
bureaucracies, no crumbling buildings. Teachers' salaries are 10
percent to 15 percent higher.
   As far as duplicating this in Chicago, ``I can't see how you can
do it with prevailing resources,'' said Robert Saddler, deputy
school superintendent and a board member of the corporate school.
   Still, he said, ``I don't think you have to replicate it on a
mass scale to gain from it.''
   Chicago's schools are doing their own experimenting with a
reform plan establishing local councils in each of some 600
schools, giving parents major decision-making powers.
   Kellman thinks success will be limited, considering 68 percent
of Chicago's 409,000 public school students live in poverty. ``The
underclass will never manage their schools,'' he said. ``They're
having trouble managing their lives.''
   Kellman concedes he's no educator _ he quit school after eighth
grade to join his father's glass business and now runs the $100
million corporation.
   But the 70-year-old philanthropist knows business, and he's
devoted to Lawndale, his childhood home. Today, it's in trouble.
   More than half Lawndale's residents get public aid. More than a
third of the housing is substandard. Recent studies found a murder
rate six times the national average, infant mortality almost three
times as great.
   ``If you walk into a typical class and ask a group of children
how many know someone who's been shot ... hit by a car ... in jail
... or been killed, virtually all the hands go up,'' said Primus
Mootry, the school's project director, who grew up in the area.
   Despite such brutal surroundings, educators hope to prove these
children can learn as well as those raised in affluence.
   ``(We do) not accept any of the stereotypes that might travel
with the neighborhood the school is situated in,'' said teacher
Kathy Irwin. ``We do not put numbers on their heads in terms of IQ.
(Some say) there are social or biological limits. We reject that.''
   ``The example we're setting is that educating children in the
inner city ... is not only possible, but the children deserve it,''
said principal Elaine Mosley.
   To smooth the way, the school has taken special steps.
   Classes, for example, are held year-round to minimize exposure
to street life. The building is open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. to
accommodate working parents _ pre-school takes children as young as
2 _ and high school equivalency degree programs are offered.
   Each room has a teacher and an aide. There are no grades, and
children up to age 9 are grouped in two-year clusters, an idea that
appeals to Elaine Finley, whose two sons and daughter are pupils.
   ``They're learning at their own speed. ... Public school would
have pushed them aside,'' she said. ``They're active participants
in learning. In public school they would sit back behind a desk all
day.''
   Mrs. Pelt cuts red tape, working with dozens of social service
agencies. She weighs children, helps them get eyeglasses, makes
dental appointments, supplies gloves, accompanies parents to doctor
visits and even allows them to do their laundry at the school.
   ``The role of the school is everything that needs to be done to
enhance learning,'' she said.
   Money helps. More than $2.8 million has been invested, mostly by
55 corporations providing annual contributions ranging up to
$150,000.
   The $5,200 annual per-pupil cost, compared with $4,624 in
Chicago, will drop as enrollment increases from the current 200 to
the 300 maximum, Kraus said. All pupils are chosen by lottery.
   Businesses also provide resources. Sears, for example, donated
carpeting, air conditioners and cabinets. But just as vital is
white-collar wisdom.
   ``There are parts of the school that are much like a business _
personnel practice and policies, for instance,'' said Ruder, Sears'
vice president of corporate public affairs.
   Still, there are skeptics.
   Business leaders don't have the ``magic answer'' to education
problems, said Don Moore, director of Designs for Change, a group
involved in Chicago's school reform. ``I'm just as content to see
the manager of a store or a bus driver or a policeman on one of
these councils,'' he said.
   Moore also wonders, ``How long are these corporations willing to
put up this much money? ... The history of these kinds of efforts
is they fall on hard times after awhile.''
   School officials say it's too early to gauge success. But
Kellman predicts that at the end of three years, pupils' test
scores will be better than their public school counterparts.
   Mootry said the school already has helped by bringing movers and
shakers to Lawndale.
   ``They see the families,'' he said. ``They realize it's not just
a bunch of poor, drug-crazed underclass folks but people struggling
to make their lives better. It's drawing attention to the plight of
the community. ... It's bringing some hope.''

<HEAD>BankAmerica Chief to Retire, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A. W. Clausen, who returned to BankAmerica
Corp. in 1986 to lead it through a remarkable financial comeback,
will retire this year, according to a report published Wednesday.
   The San Francisco Examiner quoted sources close to the bank, who
asked not to be named, as saying that the chairman and chief
executive officer will retire and his successor will be announced
before the bank's annual meeting on May 24.
   But BankAmerica spokesman Peter Magnani declined comment.
   ``We have no comment. We just won't speculate,'' he said when
asked for reaction to the published report. ``We have made no
announcement.''
   Clausen, 66, joined BankAmerica in 1949 and climbed the
corporate ladder to become chief executive in 1970. He left to head
the World Bank in Washington, D.C., in 1981.
   Once the largest bank in the nation, BankAmerica suffered major
losses related to its Third World loans in 1985-87. BankAmerica,
parent of Bank of America, lost nearly $1 billion in 1987.
   Clausen returned as chairman to stabilize the banking
institution's image.
   BankAmerica sold its headquarters building in San Francisco and
its Charles Schwab brokerage subsidiary, cut expenses and laid off
employees, also taking steps to improve its credit.
   Last week, BankAmerica reported its 1989 earnings were up an
impressive 52 percent and its annual profit soared to $1.1 billion,
the highest in its 80-year history.
   The Examiner article identified the most likely candidate to
replace Clausen as BankAmerica Vice Chairman Richard Rosenberg, 59,
who heads the company's California banking operations.
   Also listed as in the running for the top job is BankAmerica
Chief Financial Officer Frank Newman, 47.

   The stock market suffered another broad setback
today, extending Wall Street's early-1990 slide as worries mounted
about rising interest rates and pressure on the Japanese market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 194.83 points over
the past three weeks, was down another 33.56 to 2,581.76 by 2 p.m.
on Wall Street. The widely followed index regained some ground
after a more than 60-point plunge at the opening.
   Losers overwhelmed gainers by about 7 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 204 stocks rising,
1,397 falling and 333 unchanged.
   Prices skidded after traders learned overnight of a sharp
decline in the Tokyo stock market, which has been unsettled lately
by rising interest rates in Japan.
   Analysts said the drop in the Japanese market intensified fears
that rates would have to climb further in this country to stay
competitive in the international marketplace.
   A sale by the government Tuesday of 40-year bonds to finance a
rescue plan for troubled thrift institutions drew a very chilly
reception from investors.
   As the outlook for interest rates has worsened, investors have
begun to face the possibility that the recent slowdown of the
economy might deepen in the months ahead.
   Brokers also said a weak attempt by stocks to rally on Tuesday
left many traders unimpressed and disheartened.
   Today's drop opened up some room for bargain hunters who helped
bring prices off their early lows.
   Losers among the blue chips included Merck, down 1&rsqb; at 39&lsqb;;
Coca-Cola, down 1| at 69&rsqb;, and IBM, down &lsqb; at 96|.
   Precious metals issues provided one of the market's few pockets
of strength. ASA Ltd. gained 1{ to 65; Homestake Mining { to 22~,
and Newmont Gold &rsqb; to 53{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
off 2.40 to 181.20. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 6.99 at 352.74.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 152.22 million shares at
midafternoon.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   London shares were buffeted by continuing erratic
swings on world stock markets Wednesday, but recovered to show only
a modest decline at the close of trading.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished down
12.5 points, or 0.5 percent, at 2,278.6. That was just 0.2 point
shy of its 2,278.8 peak for the day and well above its low of
2,250.5, or 40.6 points down.
   Volume was a moderate 527.9 million shares, down from 544.3
million on Tuesday.
   Dealers said late afternoon bargain-hunting saved the London
market from a rout. The market was extremely jittery, they said.
   The gyrations also affected the foreign-exchange markets, where
worries about stocks accelerated a decline in the dollar in hectic
trading.
   ``We're shellshocked,'' said one London stock dealer. ``It puts
everyone off doing anything because you don't know where Tokyo or
New York is going to end up. It doesn't make for calm markets.''
   London shares initially fell sharply amid nervousness over a
tumble in Tokyo earlier Wednesday.
   The Tokyo market's Nikkei 225-share index shed nearly 600 points
after a poor round of U.S. Treasury bond auctions, which widened
the already pronounced discrepancy between stock and bond yields.
That pointed to further declines in equity values.
   At the start of London trading, dealers also were expecting a
plunge of as much as 100 points in the Dow Jones industrial average
at Wall Street's opening.
   After trading began in New York, the blue-chip average dropped
more than 61 points but then rebounded to show a decline of about
44 points when the London market closed. London investors found the
rebound encouraging.
   The Dow Jones barometer has dropped nearly 200 points in the
past three weeks.
   In London, the Financial Times 30-share index was down 11.0
points at 1,828.6 at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index
fell 10.31 points to close at 1,243.38.

   A defense contractor reimbursed executives
who attended a $500-a-plate fund-raiser for Alexander Haig's
presidential campaign in 1987, the company's founder said in court
documents.
   Corporations cannot legally contribute directly or indirectly to
presidential campaigns.
   James Guerin, founder of International Signal &amp; Control Corp.,
made the allegation in a deposition filed Tuesday in an employment
dispute with his former chief attorney. The dinner raised some
$26,000 for Haig.
   The deposition said the former chief attorney, William A. Clark,
had told Guerin and other top ISC officials he felt the
contributions were illegal, the deposition said.
   Guerin, in his sworn testimony, gave no further details about
the alleged reimbursements.
   There was no indication in the documents that Haig, secretary of
state under President Reagan, White House chief of staff under
Presidents Nixon and Ford and former NATO supreme commander, was
aware of the alleged arrangement between ISC and its executives.
   ``I can certainly say that we are shocked and surprised and know
absolutely nothing about what was alleged,'' Woody Goldberg, a
spokesman for Haig, said from Washington today. ``We wouldn't know
and certainly have no knowledge about this whatsoever.''
   Goldberg said Haig was out of town and could not be reached.
   News reports at the time of the dinner quoted an ISC spokesman
as saying the company had a keen interest in Haig and felt his
presidency would benefit the company.
   A year earlier, Haig had worked as a consultant to ISC and
helped negotiate a deal to sell missiles to the Pakistani
government of the late Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, Guerin said.
   Guerin later sold ISC to the London-based Ferranti International
PLC for $670 million in Ferranti stock.
   In the employment dispute, Clark claimed Guerin paid him only $1
million of a promised $2.75 million settlement ending Clark's
five-year association with Guerin. Guerin countered that Clark used
coercion and extortion to secure the agreement.

Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. Ltd. workers voted by nearly 3-2 to
accept a 10.2 percent pay increase, averting a nationwide strike,
union leaders said Wednesday.
   Final returns showed that 59 percent of those voting went
against their union leaders' recommendation and accepted the
improved offer. They will get a 10.2 percent raise in the first
year and a minimum of 8 percent, or a choice of 2.5 percent above
inflation, in the second year.
   The vote took place Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Most of the 32,000 workers at the U.S. company's 22 British
plants earn an average of $374 a week.
   Union leaders rejected the offer last week and sought agreement
from the workers to start striking with the last shift on Friday.
   The Ford pay negotiations are considered a bellwether for
Britain's manufacturing industry.
   A higher settlement there would have encouraged other pay
demands, further undermining Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
battle to cut Britain's high inflation rate of nearly 8 percent.
   As it is, the Ford deal is likely to mean more double-digit pay
demands. The engineering union, the biggest in the country,
immediately announced it considered 10.2 percent a ``benchmark''
for raises throughout industry.
   A spokesman for the Ford unions, who wasn't identified in
accordance with British practice, said members accepted the
proposal because ``it was quite a good offer.''
   ``It was always our aim to get our members a pay settlement in
double figures and that we did,'' he added.
   A Ford spokesman said the acceptance vote ``has saved us the
prospect of a potentially damaging strike here and at Ford's
continental (European) plants.''
   Workers at Ford plants near London and Liverpool, among the
largest sites, voted only narrowly to accept the offer; it was
rejected at two major engine plants in South Wales.
   Unofficial strikes at some plants are possible, including at
Halewood, near Liverpool in northwestern England, where 550 workers
in their second week of an unofficial strike may stay out to
protest the settlement.

two markets, a combination that analysts said could give the Comex
the most immediate rewards.
   The two commodities markets announced they were pursuing merger
negotiations and would form a joint board that would govern any
consolidated company resulting from a merger.
   The exchanges, which trade a variety of precious metals and
energy futures, said they agreed to form a joint governing board
after their executive committees met Tuesday.
   The markets'e respective boards instructed their executive
committees to continue negotiations over the most efficient way to
consolidate the administration and operations of the exchanges.
   Analysts said Nymex and Comex, which have been housed in the
same lower Manhattan building since 1933, have discussed merging at
various times over the last decade.
   Sharing resources would mean greater efficiency and cost savings
for both exchanges, but particularly for the smaller commodities
exchange, they said.
   ``I see more advantages for Comex,'' said Evan Baron, senior
account executive for Elders Futures Inc. ``Its entire trading
system needs to be overhauled. Nymex is already more computerized
and up to the minute.''
   Comex still operates under an antiquated trading system that is
more vulnerable to fraud, he said.
   In addition, ``sharing the Merc fee revenue appeals to them,''
said John Azarow, vice president and senior energy trader for Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   A marriage of varied products and markets _ as the much larger
Chicago commodity exchanges have had for years _ also makes sense
financially and strategically.
   ``The concept of having diversified products is attractive
because if one market is quiet another one might be cooking,'' said
Azarow.
   While Nymex now is the larger, more active market, that wasn't
always true. At various times in the 1970s and 1980s, Comex was the
bigger, more active exchange.
   Comex traded 19 million futures and options contracts last year
compared with 38.5 million for Nymex.
   ``Now is the Merc's time in the sun, but who knows? We could
have a change in the economic environment and oils could slump
while the metals markets boom,'' said Azarow.
   But while current Comex volume is down, ``the Merc is slowly
reaching maturation,'' said one analyst who did not want to be
named. Except for a proposed new natural gas contract, it has
traded the same products for years, he said.
   The joint governing body will include a chairman who is a Nymex
member, a vice chairman who is a Comex member, 16 Nymex member
directors, eight Comex member directors and six public directors.
   The exchanges said many of the terms of any consolidation had
not yet been determined, including the extent that either
exchange's liquid capital reserves woudl be made available to the
consolidated market.
   The two exchanges also said any agreement reached by the
executive committees and board is subject to membership and
regulatory approval.
   Nymex, the nation's largest energy exchange, trades crude oil,
heating oil, unleaded gasoline, residual fuel oil, propane,
platinum and palladium futures.
   Comex trades gold, silver, copper and aluminum futures.
   A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a fixed amount
of a commodity or instrument at a set price on a future date.
   Both exchanges also trade options in many products. Options are
contracts that permit the owner to buy or sell at a fixed price
until a specific date.

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed
mostly lower Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting
slack export demand for the commodities.
   The markets had opened slightly lower amid worries about the
stock market's steep early decline, then turned higher as stocks
steadied, only to finish with slight losses.
   ``When all was said and done, we finished right about where we
started,'' said Dale Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham

   He said export demand for U.S. wheat, corn and soybeans had been
very slow, although traders are expecting the Agriculture

Union.
   At the close of trading, wheat futures were 1\ cents lower to \

<HEAD>Incoming NADA President Says Lower Rates, Production Would Help
Dealers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lower interest rates and production schedules
could help make half of the nation's financially troubled auto
dealers profitable by year's end, according to the incoming
president of the nation's largest dealer group.
   The National Automobile Dealers Association, which represents
about 20,000 U.S. car and truck dealers, has said for the past year
that about half of its members either were losing money or just
breaking even.
   Dealers have slashed vehicle orders from manufacturers, trimmed
advertising spending and shrunk their inventories to cut costs. Now
it's time for the government and manufacturers to do their part,
NADA President-elect Ray Green said Tuesday.
   ``I think it is a possibility this year we could look for an
upturn if interest rates would drop to 9 percent and if the
automakers would cut production to the rate of sales,'' Green said
in a telephone interview from NADA headquarters in suburban
Washington, D.C.
   Some economists have urged the Federal Reserve to lower the
discount rate, the interest it charges on loans to banks. That in
turn could encourage declines in open-market interest rates,
possibly leading to a cut in the prime lending rate charged by
banks, now 10 percent.
   Banks use the prime for setting lending rates on some car loans
and on a range of other consumer and business lending.
   ``If the things happen that I'm talking about, it could move
easily to 75 percent profitable dealers by the end of the year,''
said Green. ``It doesn't take much per car in expense or profit to
change that considerably.''
   Outgoing NADA President Ron Tonkin and other organization
officials blame the tough times for dealers on high interest rates
and ambitious production schedules, which forced manufacturers to
stick incentives on their new cars to help clear jammed dealer lots.
   That limited dealers' ability to get a fair return on their
investment, Tonkin has said, and has shriveled their profits.
   Green said that on average, dealers nationwide are losing money
on new car sales, and trying to make it up with profits from used
cars, service and parts operations.
   Green, who begins his one-year term as NADA president next month
at the organization's convention in Las Vegas, hsa been a member of
the NADA's board of directors for eight years.
   He got into the automotive industry in 1952 when he joined
General Motors Acceptance Corp. as a field representative in Des
Moines, Iowa. Two years later he became a salesman at a
Chevrolet-Buick-Cadillac dealership in Iowa City.
   Green later became a general manager of a dealership in
Monmouth, Ill., a business he bought in 1958. Green now runs Green
Holding Co. Inc. of Jacksonville, Ill., which owns four dealerships
in central Illinois holding seven franchises.
   ``If the automobile manufacturers in North America are not
making money and if the auto dealers are not making money selling
new cars, there's something not working out there,'' Green said.
``It's going to have to be a different arrangement.''

   AT&amp;T's New River Valley electronics plant,
with 1,000 employees, will phase out operations over the next year
to 15 months, the company announced Wednesday.
   Jay Walters, the plant's manufacturing director, said the
shutdown results from excess capacity throughout AT&amp;T's
microelectronics business.
   Most of the electronic components made at the plant will be
transferred to an AT&amp;T plant in Dallas.
   ``We won't move any products associated with this announcement
to other factories for at least 60 days,'' Walters said in a letter
to the plant's employees. ``And as we shut down operations, we'll
make a range of employee assistance programs available to you.''
   AT&amp;T began operations at the southwest Virginia plant in
September 1980.

   The stock market suffered another broad setback
today, extending Wall Street's early-1990 slide as worries mounted
about rising interest rates and pressure on the Japanese market.
   The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more than 60 points at
the opening after traders learned overnight of a sharp decline in
the Tokyo stock market, which has been unsettled lately by rising
interest rates in Japan.
   Bargain-hunting and program trading helped Wall Street regain
some ground, but the market remained pessimistic.
   Analysts said the drop in the Japanese market intensified fears
that rates would have to climb further in this country to stay
competitive in the international marketplace.
   The Treasury's sale Tuesday of 40-year bonds to finance a rescue
plan for troubled thrift institutions drew a very chilly reception
from investors.
   As the outlook for interest rates has worsened, investors have
begun to face the possibility that the recent slowdown of the
economy might deepen in the months ahead.
   Brokers also said a weak attempt by stocks to rally on Tuesday
left many traders unimpressed and disheartened.

<HEAD>IBM, Siemens Announce Joint Venture To Develop New Computer Chip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IBM and Siemens AG, the German electronics
giant, said Wednesday they would jointly develop a new generation
of computer memory chips.
   Under the agreement, the two companies will work on developing a
64-million-bit dynamic random access memory chip, or DRAM.
   The largest-capacity chip now on the market holds 4 million bits
of information. That chip was first introduced commercially by
International Business Machines Corp. last year.
   IBM and Siemens also have independent efforts under way to
develop 16-million-bit chips, which would be the next generation
after the 4-million-bit chip.
   A bit is the smallest unit of information used by a computer.
Because of the way chips are constructed, advances in capacity
usually take place in intervals of four times greater capacity than
the previous generation.
   Development of the 64-million-bit, or 64 megabit, chip will take
place at IBM's East Fishkill, N.Y., semiconductor center, and will
use the resources of IBM's Essex Junction, Vt., facility and
Siemens' Munich research center, the companies said in a statement.
   Each company will share equally in development costs, the
companies said. Manufacturing would be done individually by Siemens
and IBM, said IBM spokesman Paul Bergevin.
   IBM, the world's largest chip producer, uses all the chips it
makes in its own products. It said it has no plans to sell the
64-million-bit chips on the open market.
   The goal of the joint venture is to have a world-standard
64-million-bit DRAM ready for commercial introduction in the
mid-1990s, the companies said.
   ``The strengths of the two firms complement one another and
increase the probability that world leadership in memory chip
technology will be maintained,'' the companies said.
   The companies did not disclose what they expect to invest in the
venture, Bergevin said.
   He said the joint venture was proposed to ``reduce the overall
costs each firm would have had to bear individually.''
   He said it will be the first time IBM has jointly developed a
computer chip, although it has joint ventures in other areas. For
example, IBM and Siemens jointly operate the Rolm telephone
business.
   One industry analyst said the announcement is not surprising.
   ``The cost of development runs into the many millions of
dollars. Each generation gets to be that much more expensive,''
said Millard H. Phelps of the San Francisco investment firm
Hambrecht &amp; Quist.
   He said Siemens, which is known for its basic research, is not a
direct competitor of IBM.
   As computer chips become more complex and more circuits are
packed onto the silicon wafers, the traditional method of making
them _ using photolithography techniques with visible light to etch
the electronic circuits _ is no longer practical, Phelps said.
   ``Probably at the 64 megabit (level) you can't do it that way,''
he said, and instead may require the use of X-rays or electron
beams for the etching.
   ``They're really having to break a lot of physics barriers
getting to that level,'' he said. ``That's why they had to get
somebody with basic research involved.''
   Phelps said other companies known to be working on 64 megabit
chips include Texas Instruments Inc. and a number of Japanese
companies, including Hitachi, NEC and Matsushita.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Saatchi and Saatchi First Over the Wall'' boasts
a large poster recently hung on the eastern side of the Berlin Wall.
   It typifies the bravura that helped Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. PLC
burst onto the scene in the 1980s and gobble rivals to become the
world's largest advertising company.
   But that audacity has backfired. A foray into consulting
businesses has been disastrous, and costs spiraled out of control.
   If the London-based agency is to recover, analysts say it should
stick to advertising.
   After nearly two decades of uninterrupted annual profit growth
since brothers Maurice and Charles Saatchi founded the company, it
recently reported the first loss, about $97 million for the fiscal
year ended Sept. 30.
   Saatchi's stock has fallen sharply on London's exchange, and the
company cut its annual dividend 38 percent.
   Five of the 12 directors have left in the past year and Saatchi
recruited a new chief executive, Frenchman Robert Louis-Dreyfus,
who turned around IMS International Inc., the New York-based
pharmaceutical market research firm.
   Saatchi already has cut 800 jobs and is trying, with apparent
difficulty, to sell its troublesome consulting businesses.
   Company executives declined to be interviewed, but Deputy
Chairman Jeremy Sinclair said in a statement that although ad
revenue growth has been slowing industry-wide, Saatchi ``has a
solid base from which it can develop.''
   Saatchi's strategy is to refocus on its communications business,
exploiting advertising operations and strength in public relations,
sales promotions and corporate identity and design, the statement
said.
   ``Hopefully, they are going to get their house in order,'' said
Richard Dale, a securities analyst with the London investment firm
James Capel and Co.
   The Saatchi brothers, who own less than 5 percent of the stock,
already had been drifting away from the day-to-day running of the
company, British press reports suggested.
   Maurice Saatchi, 43, relinquished the chief executive's role but
remains chairman. Charles Saatchi, 46, remains as executive
director.
   Charles has been selling works from his private modern art
collection, considered one of the finest, and reportedly is
depressed over the breakup of his marriage. His brother is said to
have lost some interest in the business since he married in 1984.
   The Saatchis' aversion to publicity has given them a Garbo-like
mystique, which critics claim is carefully calculated. Glossy
British magazines occasionally publish teasing photos of the
dark-haired, intense-looking Saatchis trapped by paparazzi
photographers.
   Charles reportedly has never attended a Saatchi shareholders'
meeting.
   But their impact on advertising has been enormous.
   They pioneered a global company offering one-stop service to
multinational clients. They convinced investors that ad agencies
were sound, cash-generating investments despite a volatile image.
They incited merger-mania in a creative, egocentric industry once
thought invulnerable to corporate empire-building.
   But Saatchi's own dash for growth became its weakness. Although
mega-agency status meant discounts on advertising space, the
company inevitably ended up handling rival accounts.
   It lost hundreds of millions of dollars in business from the
consumer products giants Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Colgate-Palmolive
Co. and others, because clients were concerned about
confidentiality and conflicts of interest.
   Born in Baghdad to a prosperous textile merchant, the Saatchis
grew up in Hampstead, north London. Maurice was an academic success
with a sharp business mind. Charles proved a brilliant copywriter.
   They set up their business in 1970 in Soho, London's ad agency
heartland, and quickly developed a reputation for simple,
provocative ads. Their 1971 print ad promoting contraception, for
example, showed a pregnant man and asked, ``Would you be more
careful if it was you who got pregnant?''
   The agency became publicly owned within five years, and the
Saatchis chose to relinquish ultimate control in exchange for the
investors' money they needed to expand.
   The agency came to prominence in 1979 with the advertising
campaign that helped the Conservatives oust the Labor Party and put
Margaret Thatcher in office. ``Labor Isn't Working,'' said one
poster, depicting a long line of unemployed people.
   Ambitious and self-made, the Saatchis embody the Thatcherite
ideals of entrepreneurship and meritocracy. The Sunday Times' list
of Britain's richest people estimates the Saatchis' personal
fortune at 35 million pounds, or $58 million, and ranks them tied
for 178th.
   But the Saatchis remain foreigners to Britain's upper crust,
which bristles at their flashy, self-congratulatory style. Putting
a billboard on the Berlin Wall was another example of their
instinct for the well-timed publicity coup.
   To create their mega-agency, the Saatchis embarked on a takeover
binge that shocked Madison Avenue and generated much hostility
against what detractors called ``creeping Saatchiism.''
   Their biggest purchases were Ted Bates, for $450 million, Dancer
Fitzgerald Sample, for $75 million, and Backer and Spielvogel, for
$56 million, all in 1986. That year Saatchi became the world's
largest ad holding company.
   As a result, revenues climbed to nearly $700 million in 1986 and
$1.5 billion in Saatchi's latest fiscal year from $62 million in
1982.
   It now employs 16,600 people in 58 countries, and had client
billings of $13.5 billion in 1988, giving it control of 5 percent
of the worldwide advertising market, the trade journal Advertising
Age said.
   Saatchi has championed the global, translatable campaign, like
its new TV ad for British Airways, appearing on three continents,
in which 4,000 people form a smiling, winking face on a vast
landscape.
   To overcome the reluctance of clients to be lumped together with
their competitors, Saatchi divided itself into two competing
international groups, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, and Backer
Spielvogel Bates Worldwide.
   But critics say Saatchi overspent on its buying spree, took too
long to combine acquisitions effectively, and suffers a lack of
financial controls.
   The turning point, analysts say, was the 1986 departure of
Martin Sorrell, Saatchi's longtime finance director. Sorrell heads
the ad agency group WPP Group PLC, which took over Madison Avenue's
venerable J. Walter Thomspon agency in 1987 and Ogilvy &amp; Mather
last year.
   Another Saatchi blunder, analysts say, was to diversify into
consulting. ``Maybe if they just stayed to what they knew best they
would not have gotten themselves into this situation,'' said Mark
Shepperd, an analyst with UBS-Phillips and Drew.
   Starting in 1984, Saatchi bought eight main consulting
businesses for $360 million. But valuable managers at the
consulting businesses, whose expertise ranged from executive
recruitment to jury selection, began to quit, and Saatchi wasn't
winning many cross-referrals.
   Then, in a 1987 move that smacked to some critics of
megalomania, Saatchi made unsuccessful takeover overtures at one of
Britain's biggest banks, Midland Bank PLC, and the investment firm
Hill Samuel Group PLC. This undermined confidence in Saatchi and
left shareholders confused.
   Last spring, Saatchi first warned that profits would suffer and
announced plans to sell most of the consulting firms. So far it's
only sold four small ones for $38 million.

<HEAD>Bristol-Myers Squibb Posts Loss Due to Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. on Wednesday reported a
quarterly loss of $352.7 million and a 40 percent drop in its 1989
profit due to a charge to defray the costs of merging the former
Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb Corp.
   Sales grew 10 percent in the three months ended Dec. 31 and were
up 7 percent for all of last year.
   The company said the fourth-quarter loss, which came to 67 cents
a share, compared with earnings of $293 million, or 56 cents a
share, in 1988's fourth quarter. Sales rose to $2.36 billion from
$2.14 billion.
   In all of 1989, Bristol-Myers Squibb earned $746.8 million, or
$1.43 a share, down sharply from $1.25 billion, or $2.39 a share,
in 1988. Last year's sales amounted to $9.19 billion vs. $8.56
billion in 1988.
   The profit deterioration was foreshadowed in a Jan. 9
announcement of $855 million in pre-tax charges taken in the fourth
quarter.
   A $740 million charge was earmarked to cover the costs of
closing factories and eliminating and reassigning employees. An
additional $115 million charge was taken for professional fees and
other expenses related to the merger.
   Together, the charges totaled $693 million, or $1.32 a share,
after taxes, the company said in releasing its results.
   Richard L. Gelb, chairman of Bristol-Myers Squibb, said
exchange-rate fluctuations had a negative impact on sales of 1
percent in the fourth quarter and 2 percent in the year.

<HEAD>American Express Posts Profit For Quarter, Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Express Co. reported Wednesday that its
profit for the final quarter of last year jumped 17 percent over a
year earlier, while earnings for all of 1989 were up 11 percent.
   The company attributed the improvement to double-digit gains in
the divisions that run its credit card, financial services and
information services businesses. Last year the three accounted for
around 85 percent of the financial giant's income.
   Meanwhile, Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc., which is
partially owned by American Express, posted a slender quarterly
profit, and American Express Bank saw a decline in earnings.
   Net income from continuing operations totaled $257 million, or
61 cents a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with
a profit of $221 million, or 52 cents a share, in the 1988 quarter.
Revenue rose 9 percent, to $6.3 billion from $5.8 billion.
   For the year, American Express netted a record $1.2 billion, or
$2.70 a share, compared with earnings of $988 million, or $2.31 a
share, in 1988. Revenue totaled $25 billion, up 20 percent from
$20.9 billion in the previous year.
   In a statement, Chairman James D. Robinson III said the company
``achieved impressive growth in the 1980s during an era of great
change for the customers and markets we serve throughout the
world.''
   At the Travel Related Services division, which runs the credit
card and travelers checks business, quarterly earnings climbed 16
percent to $190 million from $164 million. For the year, it earned
a record $830 million, up 17 percent from 1988 income of $710
million. Revenue in 1989 rose 22 percent to $8.4 billion.
   During the year, credit-card charge volume rose 12.5 percent to
a record $100 billion as 19 percent more merchants accepted the
card.
   The company also reported a 12 percent gain in travelers check
sales.
   IDS Financial Services posted a 20 percent jump in quarterly
earnings to a record $49 million from $41 million, American Express
said. For the year, the division netted $175 million, up 19 percent
from $148 million earned in 19888.
   The company said sales of mutual funds, life insurance and
investment certificates led the increase.
   Information Services Co. had fourth-quarter net income of $27
million, up 40 percent from the $19 million earned the previous
year. Net income for the year rose 32 percent to $83 million.
   The results reflected strong growth in the bankcard processing
business and entry into the mutual fund transfer agency business.
ISC also expanded its payment systems business through aggressive
advertising of its MoneyGram consumer money transfer service.
   Shearson Lehman, in which American Express recently lowered its
stake to less than 50 percent, had fourth-quarter earnings of $3.8
million, compared with a $13 million loss a year earlier.
   Its after-tax income for 1989 rose 14.6 percent to $110 million,
or 95 cents a share, from $96 million, or 81 cents. Revenue rose 19
percent to $12.5 billion from $10.5 billion.
   Higher commissions, net interest income and revenue from
market-making and principal transactions contributed to Shearson's
overall income growth.
   At American Express Bank, quarterly earnings fell to $31 million
from $47 millionl. Earnings for the year also declined, to $122
million from $149 million in 1988.
   The weaker results reflected a decline in net interest income
due to a drop in cash collections on loans to Brazil and the impact
of the bank's continued effort to reduce exposure to Third World
debt, American Express said.

<HEAD>Wang Reports $10.5 million Loss; Expects More Before Situation
Improves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOWELL, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wang Laboratories Inc. on Wednesday
reported a loss of $10.5 million for its second fiscal quarter, and
the troubled computer company said it expects the red ink to
continue for at least six months.
   The company's loss for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 1989, amounted
to 6 cents per share. During the same quarter of 1988, the company
reported a profit of $1 million, or 1 cent per share.
   Revenue for the most recent quarter totaled $637.7 million,
compared with $722.2 million for the 1988 quarter.
   Richard W. Miller, Wang's president and chief operating officer,
said that despite the losses, ``the results for the second quarter
are in line with our expectations.''
   The company, whose financial troubles have spawned management
shuffles and a restructuring, anticipated further losses before it
could start reporting earnings again, said Miller, who last August
replaced Frederick Wang, the founder's son, as head of the company.
   ``We are taking the necessary and difficult actions to
successfully turn the business around,'' Miller said.
   For the six months ended Dec. 31, 1989, the net loss totaled
$72.6 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with earnings of $14.1
million, or 9 cents a share, for six months ended Dec. 31, 1988.
   For the first six months of the current fiscal year, the company
reported revenues of $1.24 billion, compared with $1.4 billion in
the comparable 1988 period.
   Miller also said Wang has reduced the amount of money it owes
banks to $308 million from $575 million last August, in part by
selling assets. Wang briefly halted payments on the debt in August
when it faced a cash crunch.
   Wang expected to gain $250 million to $300 million more from
additional asset sales in the next few months that could help
address the company's debt load, Miller said.

<HEAD>Whittle Disputes Reports of Magazine Advertising Slump</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whittle Communications maintains that
its doctor's office magazines, Special Reports, are healthy even if
some major advertisers are reducing their participation.
   ``We have more demand than we have supply,'' vice chairman Alan
Greenberg said. ``We have not lost one penny of revenue.''
   Business Week magazine reported this week that Procter &amp; Gamble,
Kraft General Foods and Mott's were cutting back on advertising in
Special Reports, a series of six magazines distributed quarterly to
18,500 doctors' waiting rooms.
   Greenberg said Business Week overestimated losses from the
advertisers' cutbacks, which reportedly could reach several million
dollars, but he would not release exact figures.
   ``Yeah, it will be down,'' Greenberg said of revenue from the
advertisers. ``But we will turn around and sell the space to
someone else. That is how everybody in the media business
operates.''
   He estimated Whittle will have to sell one-third of the Special
Reports' ad space for next fall. Thirteen companies have
participated in Special Reports since its launch in September 1988.
Eleven have renewed their commitments, said Greenberg, calling it
``a fantastic record.''

<TEXT>
   The upward spiral that carried the stock markets
of the world to new highs through much of the 1980s now seems to be
threatening to transform itself into a vicious cycle in the other
direction.
   And the catchphrase ``global investing'' suddenly no longer
conjures up the heady images it once evoked in the minds of Wall
Street brokers and their customers.
   The new sequence that has unsettled so many investors and
business planners played out in typical fashion Wednesday:
   Share prices in the Tokyo stock market, which has been under
intermittent pressure because of rising interest rates in Japan,
posted a sharp loss, driving the bellwether Nikkei index of 225
issues down 599.04 points to 36,778.98.
   As the business day shifted to Europe, stocks also dropped in
London in selling attributed both to the decline in Japan and fears
of a shaky session in New York.
   Then, trading began on Wall Street with a burst of selling that
seemed preordained by what happened earlier in foreign financial
centers.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell about 60 points in
early trading, on top of a loss of nearly 195 points over the past
three weeks, before staging a partial recovery to finish at
2,604.50, down 10.82 on the day.
   At the same time, interest rates on U.S. government securities
continued their recent rise, which was touched off by tightening
monetary conditions abroad.
   No matter what the Federal Reserve's intentions for the domestic
economy, many analysts fear, U.S. interest rates will be forced
higher just to stay competitive with higher yields on securities
available to investors in the Far East and Europe.
   That worry was reinforced Tuesday when a government sale of
40-year bonds to finance a rescue plan for troubled thrift
institutions drew a very chilly reception from investors.
   At the extreme, some observers worry, the next noteworthy
``export'' to the United States from Japan could be not a car or a
stereo system but a recession aggravated by high borrowing costs.
   However, a sizeable optimistic contingent in the financial world
maintains that events aren't likely to reach that stage.
   World markets toppled in domino fashion during the crash of
1987, these observers recall, but they started coming back strong
within a matter of months, paced by an especially brisk recovery in
Japan.
   This time, some suggest, the U.S. bond market could take a
leading role in stabilizing the situation.
   The more anemic the U.S. economy gets, analysts say, the greater
the appeal of Treasury bonds might become, if only because they
represent a haven from default risk.
   ``Only a few weeks ago, interest in U.S. bonds was widespread,
based on an exclusive focus on the weak U.S. economy,'' observed
Robert Barbera, economist at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``We do
not expect further bond market deterioration.''
   Should American bonds need a boost, furthermore, some analysts
still believe they could get it from the Federal Reserve, which
might feel compelled to ease credit simply to calm the markets.
   Said Rao Chalasani, an analyst at the Cleveland-based investment
firm of Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben Inc., ``Pronounced weakness in U.S.
markets will ultimately cause the Fed to react, since the cost of
preservation is lower before things get out of hand.''

<HEAD>John Lyden: Big Board Specialist in Times of Criticism</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Lyden pops a Certs amid the constant din of
ringing bells, ripping paper and shouting traders on the floor of
the New York Stock Exchange.
   As a specialist at the Big Board, the nation's largest stock
exchange, Lyden's job often requires close contact and rapid-fire
discourse. Breath mints are mandatory.
   But some securities professionals are questioning whether the
job of specialist _ the middleman who ensures fair and fluid buying
and selling of stocks _ will be necessary in a future dominated by
computerized trading.
   ``They're a horse-and-buggy institution in a jet-propelled
world,'' said Robert Sobel, a business history professor at Hofstra
University. ``Technology has made them obsolete.''
   Bunk, say Lyden and other proponents of the specialist system,
which has been in place since after the Civil War.
   Under the system, specialists receive what amount to lucrative
franchises in handling particular stocks in exchange for setting
opening prices and keeping trading orderly. Specialists sell from
their own inventory when other sellers are scarce and buy when
buyers can't be found.
   Last week, a draft report by an independent congressional agency
described the specialist system as ``faltering'' and said the human
operation was outmoded by the capabilities of new technology to
match buyers and sellers.
   Academics and Wall Street officials advising the Office of
Technology Assessment slammed the report, which questioned
fundamental practices in the stock and futures markets, including
the role of specialists.
   Lyden, who has worked on the exchange floor for 30 years,
following his father's 42 years, undertook his own defense from the
NYSE floor.
   ``The exchange is the only place in the world where common
stocks are traded in the sunlight, totally in the sunlight,''
Lyden, 55, a senior partner in the specialist firm Nick, Lyden &amp;
Co., said in an interview.
   ``We feel if you put all the supply and demand together at one
particular time in one particular place you get a fair price,'' he
said. ``And by a fair price I mean integrity.''
   ``No one will make a trade in a phone booth, no one will make a
trade in a closet, no one will make a trade under the Brooklyn
Bridge,'' said Lyden, whose firm holds franchises in 28 stocks
including Humana Inc. and Shawmut National Bank.
   With the looks and sincere speech of a B-movie leading man,
Lyden is a commanding presence on the floor, and a historical one
too. His father, Ken, worked on the exchange floor from age 16
until his death at age 58 in 1965, moving up from gopher to
telephone clerk to specialist. He even played on the NYSE's
baseball team.
   After graduating Brown University and New York University's
business school, John Lyden joined Irving Trust bank on Wall
Street. At his father's funeral, he was asked by one of Ken's
younger partners, a pallbearer, to come to the exchange.
   ``My dad died of a heart attack,'' Lyden said, standing in the
middle of the exchange's soaring main room near an idle clerk
flicking order cards. ``I never had an inclination to be here...I
came into the business at the age of 30 not knowing a buy order
from a sell order.''
   Lyden said specialists have three roles: to ``make markets'' for
individual stocks by pairing buyers and sellers, to generate action
in less heavily traded stocks and to trade for their own accounts.
   More than 400 NYSE specialists at 49 firms make money through
commissions for handling trades and by trading stocks for
themselves. With soaring volume the last decade, specialists now
generate about 75 percent of their income from commissions.
   But specialists are involved in about 12 percent of NYSE trades.
Brokers who take orders at banks of yellow telephones on the floor
often trade with other brokers at a stock's post; in those cases
specialists serve as traffic cops, making sure the trade is
properly recorded.
   If there is no buyer or seller, the specialist records the order
in his ``limit order book'' and awaits a corresponding transaction.
Or, the specialist will step in and complete the trade to keep the
market active.
   In a purely electronic system, such as the the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system,
traders set prices and computer programs match up and execute
trades.
   ``We feel that everybody in the marketplace, whether they're a
retail customer or an institutional customer, gets a fair price,''
Lyden said. ``You don't necessarily do that if you're dealing with
a black box.''
   The current fuss over the specialist system stems in part from
the October 1987 stock market crash, when an avalanche of sell
orders threatened to put the specialists under. That day,
specialists made $485 million in net purchases and the market
stayed open.
   Still, some specialists were reluctant to buy stocks because of
uncertainty. Others who spent enormous amounts of borrowed money to
buy stocks faced credit crises with their banks. A few went out of
business.
   A Securities and Exchange Commission report on the crash praised
the system for helping prevent an even worse disaster. The report
said traders of over-the-counter stocks simply didn't pick up the
phone that day. Some automated execution systems didn't function.
   ``Market professionals have long agreed that a market cannot
work without negotiation,'' NYSE President Richard A. Grasso said
in a cover letter to his sharp critique of the congressional agency
draft report, which was sent back to the drawing board because of
complaints of shoddy research and unfounded conclusions. ``Full
automated trading systems have been doomed to failure.''
   Said Lyden: ``You might not like what happaned, that the market
was down 508 points, but at least you had a place to liquidate if
you wanted out.''
   To better ensure that specialists can meet extraordinary volume
orders, the NYSE increased capital requirements to the equivalent
of 15,000 shares of each stock a firm handles overnight, from 5,000
before the crash.
   ``He provides a number of really sophisticated functions and
(the specialist system) works,'' said Eric K. Clemons, an associate
professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
   ``Stopping a market correction is not one of them,'' he said.
``If the market is overvalued, there is no power on earth that can
stop that.''

<HEAD>Dun &amp; Bradstreet Posts 11.7 Percent Increase in 4th-Qtr Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., which offers an array of
information services for businesses, said Wednesday its
fourth-quarter profit climbed 11.7 percent on a 2.6 percent rise in
revenue.
   For the year, the company that provides the Nielsen television
audience ratings, Moody's Investors Service debt ratings and
McCormack &amp; Dodge construction reports said earnings rose 17.5
percent on a 1.3 percent revenue increase.
   The company said its revenue growth was limited by the absence
of revenue from its Official Airlines Guide which was sold in 1988
and a decline in sales at its U.S. credit services division, stung
by complaints from some customers that they had been overcharged.
The company said it has taken steps in recent months to address
problems within the credit services unit.
   Also limiting revenue growth, the company said, were the strong
dollar, competition for marketing research products and adverse
market conditions in the debt and construction markets, limiting
demand for services in those areas.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet said it earned $137.4 million, or 74 cents a
share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, up from $123.1 million,
or 66 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose to $1.16 billion from $1.13 billion
a year earlier.
   For the year, the company earned $586.4 million, or $3.14 a
share, up from $499 million, or $2.67 a share, a year earlier.
   Full-year revenue rose to $4.32 billion from $4.27 billion a
year earlier.
   Company officials announced in November that they expected
earnings per share would decline to the range of $2.80 in 1990,
citing the impact of lower sales at its U.S. credit services and
the costs of ``repositioning actions'' in that area. Those actions
included increasing the size of the sales force, changing pricing
and usage policies and steps to improve the depth and timeliness of
information in its database.

Cotton Exchange in a selloff that was sparked by the stock market's
weakness and snowballed amid profit-taking.
   On other commodity markets, livestock and meat futures fell;
gold advanced while silver retreated; oil futures were mixed; and
grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Most contracts for future deliveries of frozen concentrated
orange juice fell the permitted 5-cents-a-pound daily limit. The
March contract, on which the price limit has been expanded to 10
cents due to the market's recent volatility, plunged 9.35 cents to
$1.9515 a pound.
   The March settlement price was more than 10 cents below the
record high settlement of $2.0535 scored by the same contract only
four days earlier.
   Wednesday's action marked the sharpest downturn in orange juice
futures since a Christmas freeze that heavily damaged the Florida
orange crop and triggered a 64 percent rise in futures prices.
   ``We had really not had a good retracement since the 80 cent
runup began,'' said analyst Celeste Georkakis of Cargill Investor
Services Inc. ``The market appears to be coming back in line with
support levels.''
   The slide began at the opening bell, which was delayed one hour
by computer problems.
   Ms. Georkakis said Wednesday's stock market decline probably led
to profit-taking in the orange juice market as players sought money
to meet margin calls elsewhere.
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 60 points at the
opening of trading but recovered to finish with only a 10-point
loss.
   Most livestock and meat futures fell on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange ahead of the Agriculture Department's quarterly
cattle-on-feed report and monthly cold-storage report, both of
which were released after the close and interpreted by analysts as
bearish for the markets.
   The cattle report showed a 3 percent increase in the number of
cattle on feedlots Jan. 1 compared with the same date a year ago in
the 13 largest cattle producing states.
   The number was within expectations, as was a 10 percent increase
in feedlot placements during the last quarter of 1989.
   But a reported 2 percent drop in marketings was below
expectations and is likely to result in a weaker opening Thursday
in the April live cattle contract, said Charles Levitt, senior
livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``This report certainly tells us we're going to get some supply
relief as we get into the second quarter,'' he said.
   The cold-storage report showed 85.2 million pounds of pork
bellies in the nation's commercial freezers as of Dec. 31 compared
with expectations for about 90 million pounds.
   Live cattle futures settled .25 cent lower to .05 cent higher
with February at 78.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .43 cent
lower to .08 cent higher with January at 84.50 cents a pound; live
hogs were .62 cent lower to .30 cent higher with February at 49.15
cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.30 cent to 1.95 cent
lower with February at 54.87 cents a pound.
   Stock-market jitters sent gold futures up sharply for the second
straight day on New York's Commodity Exchange but silver succumbed
to profit-taking after a recent rally.
   Gold finished $4 to $5 higher with February at $417.70 a troy
ounce; silver was 8.2 cents lower across the board with March at
$5.258 a troy ounce.
   Petroleum futures ended mixed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange with prices pressured by Tuesday's weekly American
Petroleum Institute report of increased U.S. inventories of
gasoline and petroleum distillates.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 10 cents
lower with February at $18.89 a barrel; heating oil was .17 cent to
.29 cent higher with February at 59.57 cents gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .30 cent lower to .40 cent higher with February at
59.38 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures settled mostly lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade, reflecting slack export demand.
   Wheat futures finished 1 cent lower to \ cent higher with March
at $3.91{ a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 cent lower with March at
$2.40} a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with March at
$1.39 a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 2{ cents lower with
March at $5.66 a bushel.

<HEAD>Stocks Move Broadly Lower on Interest Rate Worries</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with closing prices and final advance-decline figures.

   Interest rate worries took a further toll on the
stock market Wednesday, sending prices broadly lower in heavy
trading despite bargain hunting and program buying.
   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 60 points at
the opening after traders learned overnight of a sharp decline in
the Tokyo stock market _ which itself has been unsettled by rising
interest rates in Japan.
   The Dow Jones average recovered ground as the session wore on
and bargain hunters and program traders moved into the market. But
the index still closed with a deficit of 10.82, ending at 2,604.50
and extending its slide over the last three weeks to more than 205
points.
   Declining issues swamped advancers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 384 rising, 1,207 falling
and 399 unchanged. In the early going, losers held a 16 to 1
advantage over gainers.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 207.83 million
shares, up from 179.30 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 244.43 million shares.
   Interest rates remained the stock market's nemesis, analysts
said.
   The drop in the Japanese market intensified fears that rates
would have to climb further in this country to stay competitive in
the international marketplace, the analysts said.
   Also troubling Wall Street was the disappointing sale by the
government Tuesday of 40-year bonds to finance a rescue plan for
troubled thrift institutions. The auction sent market interest
rates higher and made investors uneasy about the Treasury's
quarterly refunding sale scheduled for next month.
   ``The short-term direction of interest rates is high and no one
knows how high they'll go,'' said Michael Metz, an analyst with
Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Meanwhile, as the outlook for interest rates worsened, investors
were also facing the possibility that the recent slowdown of the
economy might deepen in the months ahead, and some analysts
expected further selling.
   ``You have the same doomsday attitude that accompanied major
lows'' on Wall Street in the past, Metz said.
   Other market watchers found some signs of strength.
   ``The world didn't end this morning and they had a chance to try
to do that,'' said Dennis Jarrett of Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
   Jarrett said investors were confused about interest rates and
foreign markets, but ``we haven't reached the point where the
investor has tossed in the towel.''
   At the same time, he said, the market still has room for further
declines, adding, ``We haven't reached bottom.''
   Among the stocks that recovered from their early losses were
AT&amp;T, which closed at 41\, up {; General Electric, which rose { to
63\; and Merck, which picked up } to close at 72|.
   UAL surged 6 to 161{ on the eve of a board meeting to consider a
recapitalization of the parent of United Airlines.
   Exxon slipped &lsqb; to 47 after announcing its fourth-quarter
profits fell 40 percent because of a charge related to the Alaska
oil spill. Dupont also fell _ closing at 39&rsqb;, down 1&lsqb; _ after
announcing an earnings drop.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $25.357 billion, or 0.79
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.96 to 182.64.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.34 to 379.92, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index dropped 1.35 to 330.26.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
4.76 to 425.66. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 354.67, down 5.06.

<HEAD>Chevron Takes $1.2 Billion Fourth-Quarter Charge; Shell Profits
Rise</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Earns-Exxon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Chevron Corp. said Wednesday it took a $1.2 billion charge
against fourth-quarter earnings primarily because of an inactive
oil field and environmental cleanup costs that led to an $883
million quarterly loss.
   Houston-based Shell Oil Co. attributed a 25 percent
fourth-quarter rise in profits to higher crude oil prices.
   The charge by San Francisco-based Chevron depressed 1989 profits
to $251 million, or 73 cents a share, from $1.77 billion, or $5.17
a share, in 1988. The quarterly loss amounted to $2.58 a share,
compared with profits of $175 million, or 51 cents a share, in the
1988 period.
   Chevron said the largest charge for the quarter was a $598
million write-down in the value of several producing and
non-producing oil and natural gas properties, including $445
million for the idle Point Arguello field off the Southern
California coast.
   In a sharply worded statement, Chevron Chairman Kenneth T. Derr
criticized a series of regulatory obstacles he said have blocked
the field's operation for more than two years.
   ``After enduring a series of adverse rulings from what appears
to be an irrational public policy process, I think it is prudent to
assign a more realistic value to this project,'' he said.
   ``It is irresponsible to prohibit production from already
developed domestic eneergy reserves at a time when our nation is
importing, by tankers, nearly half the oil it needs,'' Derr said.
   Chevron also said it was charging $325 million against
fourth-quarter earnings for future environmental cleanup costs at
U.S. refining, marketing and chemicals locations.
   Other charges were $164 million for adjustments to prior years'
income taxes, $63 million for a property write-off and other items
associated with a previously announced restructuring, and $53
million for reserves for regulatory and other issues.
   Chevron's fourth-quarter revenue was $8.9 billion, up from $6.9
billion in 1988. For the full year, revenue rose to $32.8 billion
from $28.9 billion the previous year.
   Chevron cited annual losses of $428 million in U.S. exploration,
production, refining and marketing which were offset by $708
million in profits from non-U.S. operations.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, Shell reported earnings of
$264 million on $5.5 billion in revenue, compared with $212 million
in profits on the same revenue in the same 1988 quarter.
   For all of 1989, Shell had earnings of $1.4 billion, up from
$1.2 billion the previous year, on revenue of $21.9 billion,
compared with $21.4 billion in 1988.
   Shell does not report per-share figures because it is wholly
owned by the Royal Dutch-Shell Group, which is based in London and
the Hague, Netherlands.
   Shell attributed the increases to higher crude prices, which
benefited oil and gas exploration and production earnings. Shell's
chemical products performed well, but its oil products slumped
because prices did not recover the increased cost of oil.
   Oil and gas exploration and production showed profits of $144
million for the quarter, up from $51 million in the same 1988
period. Full-year earnings were $546 million, up from $326 million.

<HEAD>Clausen Reported Stepping Down From BofA</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BankAmerica Corp. Chairman A.W. ``Tom''
Clausen reportedly is stepping down from the nation's
fourth-largest banking concern, following a turnaround that moved
the company from financial turmoil to record profits.
   The San Francisco Examiner said the 66-year-old Clausen's
retirement and his successor would be announced before the bank's
annual meeting on May 24. BankAmerica spokesman Peter Magnani
declined comment Wednesday about the report, which was attributed
to unidentified bank sources.
   Under Clausen, BankAmerica rebounded from three years of huge
financial losses with a restructuring that saw thousands of
employees laid off, its headquarters building and other major
assets sold and its business refocused.
   It also thwarted unwanted takeover overtures from rival First
Interstate Bancorp in an often-bitter struggle to remain
independent.
   ``The bank has made a tremendous recovery of health...'' said
Dan Williams, a bank analyst with Sutro and Co. of San Francisco.
``It may be that he (Clausen) figures the time to go out ... is
when you're on top.''
   Clausen, son of a small newspaper publisher from Hamilton, Ill.,
joined BankAmerica as a $185-a-week clerk counting cash in a vault
in 1949 after he was graduated from the University of Minnesota Law
School.
   Clausen worked his way up to chief executive by 1970 and during
his tenure BankAmerica quadrupled in size. He left in 1981 to
become president of the World Bank in Washington.
   San Francisco-based BankAmerica, the holding company for Bank of
America, suffered three years of huge losses starting in 1985. Much
of its problems were blamed on losses from bad loans to developing
nations and on real estate and farm loans in the United States.
   In 1986, it eliminated its common stock dividend for the first
time since the Depression. BankAmerica, once the largest banking
concern in the country, fell behind other giants such as Citicorp
and Chase Manhattan Corp. on the basis of assets.
   Some banking experts blamed much of BankAmerica's problems on
Clausen, contending he contributed to many of its difficulties
before leaving in 1981 with such moves as decentralization of its
lending operations.
   But Clausen claimed the bank had lost the confidence of
customers, its board, staff and shareholders because of
``over-promising and under-performing'' management, of which he was
not a part.
   Clausen returned as chairman in 1986, replacing ousted ``boy
wonder,'' Samuel Armacost, who had earned the nickname ``Clausen's
clone.'' Under Armacost, BankAmerica was rocked by almost $6
billion in loan losses and the battle with First Interstate.
   ``If we are given the time, we will return our bank to its
position of preeminence,'' Clausen pledged on his return. ``The
restructuring program ... will work. I am absolutely confident
about our strategy.''
   BankAmerica sold assets, including its world headquarters in San
Francisco for $660 million and its Charles Schwab discount
brokerage subsidiary. It cut expenses, laid off 9,000 employees and
expanded hours while experiencing strong growth in domestic
consumer and residential mortgage loans.
   Last February, Bank of America restored its common stock
dividend. Last week, the company reported 1989 earnings were up 52
percent from a year earlier to $1.1 billion, the biggest annual
profit in its 86-year-history. It currently ranks fourth among bank
holding companies with $82.9 billion in assets.
   Candidates seen as likely to succeed Clausen include Richard
Rosenberg, 59, vice chairman of the board of BankAmerica Corp., or
Frank Newman, 47, vice chairman and chief financial officer for
BankAmerica. Both worked previously for Wells Fargo &amp; Co.
   Rosenberg was with Wells for 22 years, leaving a job there as
vice chairman. He also worked as vice chairman for Crocker Bank and
was chief operating officer of Seafirst Corp. Newman spent 13 years
with Wells Fargo, working as executive vice president and chief
financial officer before coming to BankAmerica.

   Sometimes you have to take a second look at some
deeply embedded impressions.
   In the 1980s the economy grew for seven straight years, longest
peacetime advance ever. But:
   ``During the 1980s, U.S. real gross national product has grown
at an annual rate of 2.6 percent, the slowest rate of growth for
any decade since the 1930s,'' according to John Winthrop Wright of
Wright Investors Service.
   Even the oft-maligned 1970s, the decade that gave rise to the
term stagflation, managed a better annual real GNP growth rate of
2.8 percent, Wright said in his 19th annual review and forecast to
the New York Society of Security Analysts in December.
   You have to go back to the Depression-era 1930s to find a lower
growth rate _ a meager 0.1 percent a year, he said.
   Many people in the 1980s held strongly to another impression _
that taxes really had been cut, in part because President Reagan
stood for lower taxes and, in fact, helped engineer a big tax cut
early in his first term. But:
   ``We are no better off than in 1981, despite strong economic
growth and much ballyhooed cuts in income tax rates,'' according to
the Tax Foundation.
   The foundation hasn't yet determined when Tax Freedom Day will
occur this year, but because of higher Social Security taxes it
probably will be later than in 1989, when it occurred on May 4, and
1988, when it fell on May 3.
   Tax Freedom Day, it says, is the theoretical date on which
Americans finish working to support federal, state and local
entities and begin earning money for themselves. Conceivably, it
might even be later this year than in 1980.
   It attributes the standoff to three main factors:
   1. The base-broadening provisions in the Tax Reform Act of 1986
and other legislation that subjected a greater percentage of income
to taxation.
   2. Social Security taxes that increased faster than the overall
economy.
   3. State and local taxes that continued to rise, partly in
reaction to reductions in federal aid programs.
   Another major misimpression concerns the amounts of money
available for spending by choice _ rather than necessity.
   During the 1980s, discretionary income _ the amount of income
left after paying for taxes and normal household expenditures _
rose sharply. Such income totaled nearly $320 billion in a Census
Bureau survey in March 1987, or 22 percent more than in the
previous report four years earlier.
   Moreover, an analysis issued by the Commerce Department and the
Conference Board in 1989 showed that 30 percent of U.S. households
now have income beyond that needed for a comfortable living.
   But, according to that report, it took a major effort by two
breadwinners rather than just one.
   In their analysis they observed that ``households with two or
more people earning a paycheck account for 65 percent of all U.S.
discretionary dollars. Most of this income is in families where
both husband and wife are working.''
   In addition, the discretionary income was shown to be
geographically skewed. In announcing its findings, the board, a
nonprofit research organization, stated:
   ``A well-above-average 34 percent of all homes in the New
England states have discretionary income. The incidence also runs
relatively high in the Pacific and South Atlantic regions.
   ``In the Mountain, Middle Atlantic and East South Central
states, the prevalence of discretionary income homes tends to be
below the national average.''

   The Minnesota Supercomputer Center said
Tuesday it will install International Business Machine Corp.'s most
powerful computer as part of a $55 million partnership expected to
influence design of the next generation of IBM supercomputers.
   Using an IBM 3090 supercomputer with 12 interconnected
processing units and with a memory capacity of more than five
billion characters of information, the supercomputer center will
explore new ways to connect even more advanced supercomputers, the
center and IBM said in a joint statement.
   IBM is funding about half the cost of the project, according to
the statement.
   ``Our partnership with IBM brings us the new capacity and
challenge we need to maintain MSC as a world-class facility,'' said
John M. Sell, chief operating officer and president of the
Minnesota Supercomputer Center.
   Under the agreement, the supercomputer center will join IBM as a
development partner and will use IBM supercomputing equipment in
projects the center manages for its scientific and engineering
customers. Sell said engineers at the center will be devising
software with applications for all sorts of industries.
   Also, the center will join the IBM Information Network and will
provide AIX services to IBM customers who use the network,
according to the statement.
   AIX is an operating system designed to make supercomputers,
advanced workstations and other data processing equipment operate
in an environment that can handle numbers of users who want to
perform many computing tasks simultaneously.
   The Minnesota Supercomputer Center is a private corporation
owned jointly by the University of Minnesota and the University of
Minnesota Foundation.

<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices ended mixed Wednesday on
the New York Mercantile Exchange after falling at the opening in
response to an industry report that showed an increase in oil
inventories.
   The March contract for West Texas Intermediate, the main grade
of U.S. crude oil, slipped a penny to $21.59 a barrel, after a
17-cent drop on Tuesday. Other contract months also declined.
   Among refined products traded on the New York Merc, regular
unleaded gasoline for February delivery lost 0.24 cent to 59.38
cents a gallon, while other contract months were mixed.
   February heating oil gained 0.29 cent to close at 59.57 cents a
gallon while the contract for March delivery rose 0.29 cent to
57.36 cents a gallon. Contracts for later delivery declined.
   Analysts said prices moved lower at the opening in response to
an industry report that showed a buildup in petroleum supplies in
the nation's storage tanks.
   The report by the American Petroleum Institute, a trade
association representing mainly large oil refineries, said that
heating oil and gasoline stocks rose last week, while crude oil
supplies declined.
   Prices rebounded in the afternoon as large refiners moved into
the market.
   Larry Lawrence, manager of options and technical analysis for
Elders Futures Inc., said refiners who hedged against declining
refinery margins by buying crude and selling products did the
reverse _ bought products and sold crude.
   ``That spurred buying in products and firmed us,'' Lawrence said.

   Mickey Mouse and his buddies have taken sides in
the cola wars, and they'll be sipping Coca-Cola for at least the
next 15 years.
   The Coca-Cola Co. and The Walt Disney Co. on Wednesday signed a
15-year marketing agreement, extending an association that dates to
1942.
   The deal calls for Coke products to be available exclusively in
all Disney theme parks. Coca-Cola also will have the right of first
negotiations for joint promotional programs with Disney movies and
exclusive rights to use certain Disney characters in advertising
and consumer promotions.
   Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
   ``This new agreement continues the partnership of two of the
world's greatest brand names,'' said Coke President Donald R.
Keough. ``Coca-Cola and Disney share a passion for serving
consumers and always providing a reflection of the bright side of
life.''
   Disney President Frank G. Wells said his company was ``extremely
pleased to renew and enlarge a relationship that has been mutually
beneficial over the past half century.''
   Coca-Cola and Disney first joined forces when Coke's Sunday
afternoon radio show in December 1942 presented a program featuring
music from the Disney movie ``Saludos Amigos.'' Coke was a sponsor
of Disney's first television show in 1950.

<HEAD>SEC Chief Calls for Removing Some Legal and Regulatory Barriers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top securities regulator Wednesday
called on Congress to remove legal and regulatory barriers so the
United States could meet increasing competition in world financial
markets.
   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden
said the strength of Japan as a financial center and the removal of
European trade barriers in 1992 would give U.S. capital markets
their first real challenge.
   Breeden, just back from three days of meetings in Japan, said
securities professionals there told him the United States is
regarded as ``the source of innovation and creativity in financial
products.''
   ``We have to recognize that here at home and get rid of some of
the legal and regulatory barriers,'' Breeden said at a meeting of
the Securities Regulation Institute.
   Breeden said the European Economic Community's single market
would mean standardized disclosure and takeover rules for companies
and no barriers to banks engaging in the securities business, as in
the United States.
   Among other steps, Breeden called on Congress to remove barriers
to stock market trading of ``hybrid'' securities that have elements
of futures.
   A federal court recently banned trading of a stock-index future
on the Philadelphia and American stock exchange because of
restrictions limiting such products to commodities exchanges.
   ``If you can find one smidgen of futurity ... then that product
becomes unlawful'' on stock exchanges, Breeden said. ``that sets up
the prospect that all products will have to go to the courthouse
before going to investors.''
   Similar securities are available to investors on the London and
Toronto stock exchanges, he said.
   Breeden also said the United States should eliminate barriers
under the Glass-Steagall Act to allow banks to enter the securities
business, make takeover laws parallel in all states and remove
barriers to interstate banking.
   Breeden also supported lowering barriers to foreign investment
to make it harder for other countries to keep out U.S. investors
and companies.
   Along those lines, he said Japanese officials indicated they
would allow foreign mutual funds into their country's $500 billion
investment trust business, now limited to 14 Japanese companies.
   ``We believe the U.S. mutual funds are the finest in the
world,'' Breeden told reporters. ``We would like to see them in
Japanese markets, particularly the retail markets.''
   At a separate session, former SEC Chairman David S. Ruder
challenged the commission to become more active and far-sighted in
pushing for laws reforming the securities industry.
   Ruder, who presided over the SEC during two tumultuous years
that included the October 1987 stock market crash and Wall Street's
insider trading scandals, called for a major study of securities
industry reforms such as one undertaken in 1962.
   ``There should be a study not only of volatility, but of
little-known problems in the industry ... and we need to assess
whether the crazy-quilt regulation we have in the U.S. over the
banking and securities industries is the right one,'' Ruder said.
   But Breeden said there is too little time to undertake such a
study, which he said would take years.
   ``I'd like to see Congress and the administration get on with
the task of reforming the securities market,'' he said.
   Congress this session is considering a series of bills on market
reform, including the possibility of placing responsibility for
regulating the nation's stock and futures markets under one body.
   Ruder said he believes Congress would be forced to re-evaluate
scrapping the Glass-Steagall Act to allow banks to underwrite
securities.
   ``Our financial institutions are going to be at a severe
competitive disadvantage in the world if they cannot engage in
banking and securities transactions at the same time,'' he said.

<HEAD>GE Aerospace To Cut 14 Percent Of Work Force</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GE Aerospace plans to cut nearly 14 percent
of its work force, eliminating more than 5,700 jobs over the next
two years, as expectations of reduced Pentagon spending continue to
grip the defense industry.
   About 5,600 of the job cuts will be in the eastern part of the
country, a spokesman said Wednesday.
   The reductions are part of a program begun early last year aimed
at trimming a total of 10,000 from the payrolls. In 1989 GE
Aerospace, a division of General Electric Co., trimmed 4,775 from
its work force. About 4,000 positions will be eliminated this year,
with the remaining 1,600 jobs to be cut in 1991, spokesman Don
Norton said.
   The company said no specific decisions have been made on where
or when the remaining reductions will be made. The decisions will
be made as business conditions develop, it said.
   GE Aerospace, the nation's third-largest defense contractor, is
based in King of Prussia, Pa.
   Norton said the cutbacks will come through layoffs and attrition
throughout the division, which has more than a dozen plants, mostly
in the Northeast.
   By January 1992, the aerospace unit will be left with 35,500
employees, down from 47,000 in January 1988. At latest count, the
division employed 41,108.
   On Tuesday, General Electric reported a 16 percent increase in
profits in the fourth quarter of 1989. The parent earned $1.17
billion, or $1.30 a share, up from $1.01 billion, or $1.12 a share.
   The nation's defense spending has been stagnant, in real terms,
for the last few years amid public concern over the federal budget
deficit, misconduct by defense contractors and the changing
political climate in Eastern Europe.
   In addition to declining U.S. expenditures for defense, the
cutbacks are a ``matter of staying competitive'' in a much tougher
business climate, Norton said.
   Earlier this month, Seattle-based Boeing Co. said it expects to
cut 5,000 workers this year. The aerospace giant said the move was
made partly because of warmer East-West relations that have dimmed
the outlook for its defense business. Company officials said
further layoffs were possible.
   Also in January, the Martin-Marietta Astronautics Group
announced plans to cut about 200 jobs by the end of next month. The
company said some of the jobs would be transferred to other
businesses.
   Last year, GE Aerospace's aircraft-electronics unit based in
Utica, N.Y., was hit heavily with cutbacks. Employment held fairly
steady at the astro-space operation in East Windsor, N.J., and at
the King of Prussia plant, which makes satellites.
   Jobs at Moorestown, N.J., where the Aegis radar system for the
Navy is made, increased slightly.
   About half of the 4,775 jobs cut by GE Aerospace last year were
in units sold by the company, including the 1,000-employee
instrument-products operation in Wilmington, Mass., which was sold
to Ametek Inc. of Paoli, Pa.
   GE Aerospace has no plans to sell any other units, Norton said.
   The aerospace unit also includes plants in King of Prussia and
Philadelphia in Pennsylvania; Camden, Moorestown and East Windsor,
N.J.; Binghamton and Syracuse, N.Y.; Pittsfield and Burlington,
Mass.; Huntsville, Ala.; Largo and Daytona Beach, Fla.; and
Burlington, Vt.

   An explosion at Du Pont's Chambers Works
chemical plant sparked a fire at the site Wednesday, but no serious
injuries were reported, officials said.
   The explosion rocked the middle of the plant in Salem County,
N.J., around 1:36 p.m. EST, said Kelli Kukura, a plant spokeswoman.
Thirteen workers were treated at an on-site medical center and
released, she said.
   The explosion generated a thick cloud of smoke, but the blaze
was extinguished around 3 p.m., said Jeanine Mosley, a spokeswoman
for the state Department of Environmental Protection. The
department dispatched two hazardous response units to the scene as
a precautionary measure, Ms. Mosley said.
   Authorities said they did not know what caused the explosion.
Ms. Kukura said Du Pont officials were still assessing damage to
the plant.
   The explosion occurred after the lid of a 11,000-gallon sulfuric
acid tank blew off, according to Ms. Mosley. Sulfuric acid is used
to manufacture Kevlar, used in bullet proof vests and Nomex, used
in protective clothing for firefighters, Ms. Kukura said.
   Ms. Mosley said the smoke was confined to the local area and
there were no evacuations. She said officials in Salem, N.J., told
residents to remain indoors when the fire broke out.
   The plant is located several miles north of the Delaware
Memorial Bridge in Deepwater. A spokeswoman for the Delaware River
and Bay Authority said bridge traffic was not affected by the
explosion.
   Du Pont took air samples within an 8-mile radius as a
precaution, according to Ms. Mosley. She said preliminary results
did not detect any release of toxins.
   The Department of Environmental Protection has not issued any
violations against Du Pont, Ms. Mosely said. She said the agency is
still investigating the incident.
   Chambers Works is Du Pont's largest chemical facility. About
3,600 employees work at the plant.

<HEAD>Call for Boost in Utility Conservation Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group that includes four big California
utilities unveiled an energy conservation plan Wednesday aimed at
saving hundreds of millions of dollars a year by paying people to
buy more efficient homes and appliances and allowing stockholders
to benefit from energy savings.
   The plan by a coalition of businesses, consumer advocates and
environmentalists is intended to save fuel, clean the air and,
ultimately, lower costs for consumers.
   ``By offering customers more incentives to use energy more
efficiently, we can help them reduce their energy costs, and we can
avoid or postpone having to build new power plants,'' said Virgil
Rose, a vice president of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., one of four
major utilities taking part in the plan.
   ``Utilities would be paying people to use less of their
product,'' observed Ralph Cavanagh of the Natural Resources Defense
Council.
   The plan calls for giving money to builders to encourage
construction of homes and offices with better insulation and
energy-saving heating and cooling systems; giving rebates to
customers for buying energy-saving appliances; and financing free
or low-cost home improvements for low-income and elderly residents.
   There was little incentive for utilities to make those
investments in the late 1980s. With fuel supplies abundant and oil
and gas prices dropping, utility conservation programs dropped
sharply. Spending at PG&amp;E dropped from $138 million in 1985 to $81
million in 1988, and at San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. from $17.8
million in 1983 to $2.9 million in 1989.
   The result has been increased home energy use, more pollution
and a greater depletion of resources.
   The new plan, set in motion by the state Public Utilities
Commission last July, will be defined more fully in March when the
four utilities _ PG&amp;E, SDG&amp;E, Southern California Edison and
Southern California Gas _ submit formal proposals to the commission.
   Although elements of the plan have been used elsewhere in the
country, the size of the four utilities give their effort added
importance.
   PG&amp;E and Southern California Edison are the nation's two largest
utilities in terms of sales. The four utilities together serve at
least three quarters of California's population, Cavanagh said.
   Others joining in the conservation plan included groups of
developers, small power producers, water agencies, the PUC's
consumer staff and the consumer group Toward Utility Rate
Normalization.
   The 82-page proposal calls for $263.8 million in conservation
spending by the four utilities this year and $300 million in 1991.
Those are no higher than mid-1980s spending levels, taking
inflation into account, but they are substantial increases over the
totals of $153 million in 1988 and $171.3 million in 1989.
   The report said utilities should have fuel savings worth at
least twice the added investment cost. The utilities primarily burn
domestically produced oil and gas. In addition, the report said
similar programs in other states have estimated the benefits from
environmental improvement as being worth 15 percent to 25 percent
of the value of fuel savings.
   Customers, though initially paying higher rates to subsidize the
programs, should get most of the savings through lower utility
bills in the long run, the report said.
   The major incentive for utilities, however, is that some of the
savings would go to stockholders. Under PG&amp;E's proposal, for
example, 30 percent of the estimated fuel savings from most of
programs and 5 percent of the costs of low-income assistance would
be given to stockholders.
   ``The possibility of increased earnings can encourage utility
management to search actively for new energy-efficiency
opportunities and to implement the programs effectively,'' the
report said, summarizing the views of those who favor incentives.
   The report also quoted opponents as saying the incentives were
unnecessary, would increase rates and were no substitute for PUC
regulation.
   Half or more of all spending would be on incentives for
energy-efficient new buildings.
   Utilities also are proposing a variety of individual programs.
PG&amp;E wants to offer customers rebates of $50 and $100 for buying
refrigerators that exceed federal efficiency standards by 10 or 15
percent; Edison is proposing a design competition with $2,500
prizes for energy-efficient buildings.
   Publicly owned utilities like the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District are not covered by the plan, but the state Energy
Commission said it would pursue conservation policies with them as
well.

<HEAD>Great Northern Income Down 39 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORWALK, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., the target
of a hostile takeover offer, reported a 39 percent drop in net
income in the fourth quarter partly because of the cost of fending
off the bid.
   Net income was $52 million, or 92 cents a share, compared to
$85.8 million, or $1.56 a share, in the last quarter of 1988, Great
Northern said Tuesday.
   The Norwalk-based paper company said its earnings per share were
reduced by 33 cents because of the $3.8 billion offer made late
last year by Georgia-Pacific Corp., a forest products company in
Atlanta.
   Great Northern is fighting Georgia-Pacific using anti-takeover
provisions in its bylaws and an antitrust suit in Connecticut.
   Chairman William R. Laidig also attributed the decline to a
general downturn in the paper industry due to overcapacity.
   ``Business conditions changed around mid-year, when increasing
paper capacity began to affect the supply-demand balance in many of
our markets,'' he said. ``Generally, prices for most of our
products had been relatively stable the first half of the year, but
weakened modestly in the third quarter and continued to weaken in
the fourth.''
   Great Northern said fourth-quarter sales fell 1 percent to $934
million from $944.1 million a year earlier. Shipments of pulp,
paper and containerboard from the company's mills fell 27.7 percent
in the fourth quarter because of harsh weather at the company's
southern mills.
   Net income for the year fell 6 percent to $321 million, or $5.78
a share, from $341.7 million, or $6.21 a share in 1988. Sales rose
8 percent to $3.9 billion from $3.6 billion in 1988.
   ``The outlook is a tough call because most of our markets are
becoming more competitive,'' Laidig said. ``Our performance in 1990
will depend on the strength of the U.S. economy and the growth in
demand for our products.''

   Mexico will be removed from a list of
countries accused of failing to provide adequate safeguards for
intellectual property rights, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills
said Wednesday.
   The Mexican government has announced it will send its congress a
package of proposed changes to improve the protection of patents
and copyrights for companies doing business in Mexico.
   That follows action taken by the government earlier this month
to draft new regulations aimed at reforming the country's licensing
and patent system.
   ``The Mexican government has demonstrated its firm belief in the
need to protect intellectual property rights,'' Hills said in a
statement announcing the action.
   ``I want to encourage these developments and work toward a
partnership across the Rio Grande that will provide a solid
foundation for economic growth and expansion.''
   Earlier, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher called Mexico's
actions a ``very important step. The last big block to the forward
movement of investment in Mexico has been removed.''
   In May, Hills put Mexico and seven other nations on a priority
watch list, saying the administration believed they were the worst
offenders in failing to provide adequate protection of intellectual
property rights.
   Negotiations, under a section of U.S. trade law known as Special
301, have been conducted with all eight nations in an effort to
improve patent and copyright protections.
   The eight countries on the original list were Mexico, Brazil,
China, India, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.
Taiwan, Korea and Saudi Arabia were moved to a secondary watch list
in November because of progress in negotiations, but Mexico is the
first country to be removed.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp.'s three employee unions on Wednesday
proposed the acquisition of 75 percent of the airline company's
stock by all employees, leaving the remaining 25 percent in the
public's hands.
   In a letter to the company's board of directors, United
Airline's pilots, flight attendants and Machinists said they were
prepared to negotiate as a group for the acquisition of stock
through one or more employee stock ownership plans, or ESOPs.
   The employees offered wage concessions and long-term contracts
in return.
   ``We are unified as never before in our view that majority
ownership of the company is the only acceptable means to resolve
the issues that plague United,'' the letter concluded.
   UAL's board of directors is scheduled to meet Thursday and had
been planning to consider a recapitalization urged on the
Chicago-based company by one of its largest shareholders, the
Coniston Partners investment group, holder of an 11.8 percent stake.
   But Keith Gollust, one of Coniston's principals, said late
Wednesday that he and his partners were ``really pleased'' at the
new development and were backing away from their insistence on a
recapitalization to boost the value of UAL shares.
   ``We have always favored an employee buyout as an alternative,''
Gollust said in a telephone interview from his New York office.
``We think this is a great step forward.''
   Gollust said a recapitalization, which likely would involve new
borrowing by UAL to make a payout to shareholders, ``ought to
remain as a backup alternative.''
   Joe Hopkins, spokesman for UAL, the parent company of United,
declined comment on the ESOP proposal.
   An ESOP typically buys stock with borrowed money and pays it
back over a number of years with dividends on the shares.
   The UAL employees' letter offered no specifics on how they plan
to finance their proposed purchase of 17 million of UAL's 22.6
million shares, which would cost about $2.7 billion at Wednesday's
closing stock price of $161.50.
   Officials of the three unions did not return phone calls.
   Airlines analyst Samuel Buttrick of Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. said
the apparent harmony among UAL's unions and their willingness to
take paycuts were a positive sign, ``but the notable lack of
specifics on structure and financing indicates that only minimal
progess has been made on an ultimate resolution.''
   In return for a majority stake in the company, the employees
said they were prepared to make ``significant investments,''
including an acceptance of lower wages, under 5-year contracts.
   The investments, including the contributions of non-union
employees, would total about $300 million in the first year and $2
billion over the life of the contracts, the union group said.
   The letter did not describe the proposed investments or specify
how the unions proposed to divide the stock among UAL's four
employee groups.
   ``Our objective is to form a unique partnership among the
company and all employees that will permit the company to
immediately return to the position of the world's best airline _
and to grow and prosper into the future,'' read the letter.
   The letter was signed by John Peterpaul, vice president of the
Machinists union; Frederick C. Dubinsky, chairman of the United
chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association; and Diana Robertson,
president of the United chapter of the Association of Flight
Attendants.
   UAL's stock climbed $6 to close at $161.50 Wednesday in New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   UAL directors are under pressure from Coniston Partners, a New
York-based investment group with 11.8 percent of UAL's stock, to
quickly approve a transaction that will boost shareholder value.
   Coniston urged UAL's directors to explore a recapitalization
after management and the pilots failed to pull together a buyout
offer by Jan. 8, the date of the last board meeting.
   At that meeting, the board directed its financial adviser, First
Boston Corp., to explore the merits of a recapitalization and come
up with a proposal for Thursday's meeting.
   But the board also said it reamined open to buyout proposals.
   Both the pilots and the United chapter of the Association of
Flight Attendants have expressed strong opposition to any
recapitalization that would increase the indebtedness of the
nation's second-largest airline and allow for anything less than
majority ownership of the company by its workers.
   The Machinists opposed a previous buyout attempt led by UAL's
management and pilots, which caused lenders to balk and the $6.75
billion buyout bid to fail on Oct. 13.
   The UAL buyout saga began last August when Los Angeles
billionaire Marvin Davis made an unsolicited offer of $200 a share,
or $4.32 billion, for the company.
   The failed pilot-management bid was for $300 a share.
