<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf, `In the...,' to add playoff series score for
National League.</NOTE>

   The Oakland Athletics swept to the
American League pennant and their third straight World Series
Wednesday in a 3-1 defeat of the Boston Red Sox, whose pitching ace
Roger Clemens was ejected by an umpire.
   In the National League playoffs, the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the
Cincinnati Reds 3-2 to stay alive in the best-of-seven series.
Before a hometown crowd, the Pirates relief pitcher Bob Patterson
extinguished a ninth-inning rally by intentionally walking one
batter to load the bases and getting the next man to ground into a
double play. The Reds lead the series, three games to two.
   American League Playoff Game 4 was the second victory in the
series for pitcher Dave Stewart, and his eighth straight win in a
head-to-head matchup with Clemens. The Boston ace was ejected in
the second inning for arguing over balls and strikes with umpire
Terry Cooney.
   A wild 10-minute game interruption followed. Clemens charged the
plate and shoved another umpire. Several Red Sox spilled onto the
field, along with two water coolers and a trash bin full of bubble
gum and sunflower seeds from the Boston dugout.
   Stewart maintained a two-hit shutout until the ninth inning,
when Ellis Burks doubled and scored on a Jody Reed single. Relief
pitcher Rick Honeycutt took over and sent Boston to its eight
straight playoff defeat.
   The A's, the first team to reach the World Series three straight
times since the 1976-78 New York Yankees, will begin their baseball
championship defense Tuesday night in either Cincinnati or
Pittsburgh.

<HEAD>Pilgrim Nuclear Plant Neighbors Seek More Action After Cancer
Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLYMOUTH, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Neighbors of the Pilgrim nuclear power
plant said Wednesday that a study showing higher than normal
leukemia rates in their area justified emergency efforts to lower
the plant's radiation emissions.
   About 80 residents attended a meeting called by the state to
discuss the Department of Public Health report released the
previous day.
   The study showed that adults who lived within 10 miles of the
Pilgrim nuclear power plant in the 1970s and early 1980s were four
times more likely to develop leukemia than were those who live
farther away.
   The study does not prove that the plant, which opened in 1972,
caused the cancers. Many health experts believe the emissions from
nuclear plants are safe.
   Also, Public Health Commissioner David Mulligan said emission
levels have declined since the 1970s. The report found no increased
risk associated with the plant after 1984.
   But Mary Elizabeth Lambert of the Duxbury Nuclear Affairs
Committee was not satisfied.
   ``Clearly radiation has been here. It will be in your
Thanksgiving dinner in your cranberry sauce,'' she said.
   Pat Granahan of Hingham said, ``You should be declaring a public
health emergency. There's too much at stake.''
   Lambert urged Mulligan to implement radiation monitoring within
the plant's emission stack, rather than just monitoring in the area
outside the plant.
   Mulligan said the state was moving toward stricter standards,
cutting the acceptable level of emission from 25 to 10 millirems
per year. He said the new limit, which was a recommendation in the
report, would be in place with within six months.
   A rem is a measurement of radiation absorbed in living tissue; a
millirem is a thousandth of a rem. A diagnostic chest X-ray
involves 20 millirems to 30 millirems of radiation.
   Some of the people attending the meeting asked the state to
study other, long-term cancers, in addition to leukemia, in the
region.
   Mary Ott, co-chairman of the Citizens Urging Responsible Energy,
based in Duxbury, said the plant should be closed. ```We feel we
have been subjected to enough risk from Pilgrim,'' she said.
   No Pilgrim officials spoke at the meeting.
   Boston Edison, which operates the plant in Plymouth, said
earlier that the report contradicts other evidence, including a
study released last month by the National Cancer Institute.
   In the cancer institute study, researchers surveyed more than
900,000 cancer deaths in 107 counties around 62 nuclear facilities
across the United States. They found that people living near
nuclear plants had no greater risk of dying from cancer than did
people who lived far away from them.

<DATELINE>SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Francia Martinez stood
in line for rice, beans and flour. She wanted sugar, too, but knew
there would be none of that sweet staple.
   Sugar, the foundation of this Caribbean nation's economy for 400
years, is gone from store shelves. It is being shipped to foreign
buyers, who pay more than Dominicans can afford.
   ``Nobody understands what's going on in this country,'' said
Freddy Sanchez, waiting in a nearby gas station line that was four
blocks long. ``Prices go up, but we're still short.''
   Mrs. Martinez, taking shelter from the midday sun under a black
umbrella, said she was ``lacking everything at home'' for her
husband and three children.
   Rising consumer prices and shortages of gasoline, food,
electricity - even water - are causing hardships and widespread
protest among the Dominican Republic's 7 million people.
   Two nationwide protest strikes since August have led to violence
between security forces and demonstrators in which at least 14
people have been killed and 90 wounded. Police report 2,300
arrests, but strike leaders say the number is higher.
   A few days before a strike in September, three Santo Domingo
university students were killed by the explosion of a bomb they
were making on campus. Police found an arsenal of explosives in
Santiago, the second-largest city.
   Protest began when President Joaquin Balaguer imposed economic
austerity shortly before beginning his second consecutive four-year
term in August.
   He ended subsidies for such basic goods as flour, cooking oil
and gasoline, causing prices to triple in some cases. Gasoline has
risen since August from 55 cents a gallon to $1.42, with added help
from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Balaguer's government could not afford the normal level of oil
imports after the Persian Gulf crisis drove world prices up, so it
began importing about one-third less and rationed gasoline.
   ``There's no flour, sugar, gas, medicine because the country has
no dollars, no foreign currency, no reserves,'' said Andres
Dauhakre, a leading economist. ``Certainly the crisis in the Middle
East doesn't help.''
   Economic problems have mounted since world sugar prices
collapsed and U.S. import quotas were cut in the 1980s. Last year's
crop was smaller than usual.
   The Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola
with Haiti, has a foreign debt of $4.1 billion. By conservative
estimates 28 percent of its workers are jobless and annual
inflation is 70 percent.
   A $500 million building spree largely tied to the 500th
anniversary in 1992 of Columbus' discovery of America has created
schools, roads, housing, irrigation dams and monuments, but the
government has financed it by the inflationary means of printing
money.
   Power plants have deteriorated from neglect, causing blackouts
of up to 18 hours a day. Many homes and factories have their
generators, but fuel shortages make them unreliable. Breakdowns of
electric pumps cause water shortages.
   The International Monetary Fund demanded the austerity measures.
Balaguer, 84 and blind from glaucoma, says they are necessary and
has urged Dominicans to conserve.
   ``We have to use less gas, go out less, go to the beach less,''
he said recently. ``We must appeal to Dominican patriotism so that
we can overcome this crisis.''
   There is no current agreement with the IMF. Because the country
could not pay interest on most of its debt in the past year, it is
ineligible for loans and has no credit.
   Talks with the IMF are under way, but Dominicans are wary. The
last IMF program in 1984 led to higher prices and riots that took
100 lives.
   Tourism, the really bright prospect, is expected to net $1
billion this year, but visitors may start choosing islands with
fewer problems.
   Officials blame the unrest on supporters of leftist former
President Juan Bosch, 81, whom Balaguer defeated by 1 percent of
the vote in May.
   Jose Luis Arteaga, Balaguer's economic adviser, said: ``The
opposition thinks the Balaguer government is illegitimate because
of the elections. They want to make life impossible for us.''
   Bosch accused Balaguer, his longtime political foe, of
widespread vote fraud, but an independent electoral board said a
lengthy review of voting tallies produced no evidence.
   Balaguer's narrow victory deprived his conservative Social
Christian Reformist Party of a congressional majority and critics
accuse him of ruling by decree.
   To soften the the austerity measures, the government gave public
employees a 30 percent pay raise and froze some prices. The freezes
have led to speculative buying, creating further shortages.
   Unions demand a 150 percent general raise. The minimum wage now
is equivalent to $72 a month.

<TEXT>
   The framers of Mississippi's 1890
Constitution envisioned a pay-as-you-go government, with the
governor and treasurer counting - by hand, twice a year - the money
locked away in a huge black vault hidden in the Capitol.
   The voters are being asked to lift that 100-year-old burden in
the Nov. 6 election.
   Historians say the provision hasn't been followed since at least
the turn of the century. The requirement dates to when state
governments paid all their bills in cash, Treasurer Marshall
Bennett said.
   ``I don't think the framers had computer printouts in mind,''
Bennett said. ``As a procedural matter, it is impossible to comply.
We don't keep money in the vault anymore. It's distributed to
financial institutions.
   ``The best the governor can do is to see a computer printout, or
an electronic blip in a computer chip. It will relieve the burden
of noncompliance for a procedure left behind by technology.''
   Amending state constitutions is almost a fall ritual in the
South.
   Mississippi has amended its cumbersome, 24,000-word constitution
102 times over the last century. It has four more constitutional
``housekeeping'' amendments on the ballot this fall.
   Earlier this month, Louisiana tacked 14 amendments on its 1973
Constitution for a total of 41 in less than two decades.
   In Arkansas, voters will decide Nov. 6 whether to remove a
constitutional provision that ordered government officials to
resist integration under threat of arrest and prosecution.
   The provision was put in the state's constitution in 1956 as
federal courts were beginning to strike down segregation laws, but
it was never enforced.
   Texas voters are being asked to clear up confusion over when the
state Senate must approve gubernatorial appointments.
   Earlier this year the state attorney general ruled such
appointments must be confirmed in the Senate's first session -
whether special or regular - after the appointment. An amendment
before the voters would require the Senate to consider the matter
in the Legislature's first regular session after the nomination,
allowing an unconfirmed appointee to hold office in the interim.
   In Mississippi, the voters also will be considering amendments
that would:
   - End the state's pension obligation to Civil War veterans and
their widows. The last person eligible for one, Kate Jobe Nelms of
Corinth, died March 28, 1987, according to state records. Her
pension for that year was $2,500.
   - Remove a provision setting the boundaries of the state.
Backers say the boundaries are now set in law and are not needed in
the constitution.
   - Delete a provision giving the Legislature authority to elect
U.S. senators and appoint presidential electors. Federal and state
law now provide for direct election of senators, while presidential
electors are put on the ballot by political parties.
   - Remove a requirement that county supervisors must own land in
the district from which they are elected before they can take
office. Backers says court decisions have rendered the provision
unconstitutional.

<HEAD>Straws in the Wind: Americans Disquieted About Deployment in Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAGERSTOWN, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When The Daily Mail asked eight people if
they thought the United States should invade Iraq and Kuwait to
resolve the Persian Gulf crisis, only two said yes. Debbie Harnish,
29, of Hagerstown, said U.S. troops ``should just get back over
here.''
   When the organization Americans Talk Security asked how long
U.S. forces should remain in Saudi Arabia if there's a stalemate,
only 12 percent said indefinitely. But 32 percent predicted that's
how long troops will be there.
   It was the ``ghost of Vietnam question,'' said Alan Kay, founder
of the bipartisan group of pollsters.
   Sen. Bob Kerrey may have spoken for more Americans than he
thought when he said he is ``profoundly uneasy'' about the
deployment of U.S. troops in the Middle East.
   The uneasiness is quiet. People who are uneasy don't usually
march in parades and carry banners about it. They're just uneasy.
   Public opinion polls show broad support for President Bush's
actions so far in the gulf crisis, but also show that a large
majority of Americans oppose quick military action against Iraq.
   In Pasadena, Calif., the Rev. George Regas, rector of All Saints
Episcopal Church, said ``I think there is a lot of despair. I think
Bush is going to be surprised when he thinks that the support he
has can be translated into real support for the tragedy of war. I
just don't think it's going to be there.''
   In Philadelphia, Harold Jordan, coordinator of the National
Youth and Militarism Program of the American Friends Service
Committee, reported receiving 550 to 600 calls and letters since
early August from people who ``never had any contact with organized
peace or anti-war movements in the past.'' Some, Jordan said, ``say
they would fight if they felt this country was truly threatened,
but they don't see this as being a threat.''
   Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat, said in a Sept. 19 speech on the
Senate floor, ``I am profoundly uneasy about the instant deployment
of over 100,000 American troops, sold to the American people on
false assertions that Saddam Hussein is Adolf Hitler, that our way
of life is at clear and present danger, that we have as much at
stake as we did in World War II.''
   Kerrey also said that ``many - probably a majority - of
Nebraskans'' had accepted President Bush's rationale for the
deployment.
   More than two weeks later, Kerrey's press secretary, Steve
Jarding, said ``That hasn't changed. It's still pretty strong that
he ought to be supporting the president.''
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., on the other hand, said telephone
calls and letters from his district have reflected ``a lot of
support for the position of getting out of the Arabian desert.''
   McDermott voted against a resolution supporting the president's
actions in the crisis but emphasizing the need for diplomacy to
resolve it. The resolution passed the House 380-29 on Oct. 1 and
the Senate passed a similar measure the following day.
   McDermott said that when he was attending meetings in his home
district during the August recess, ``the question was raised, what
are we doing in the gulf? It was more a questioning than a
statement of support or attack.'' More recently, he said, ``People
began to raise the question of: why don't we get out of there?''
   Some of the dissent, of course, comes from longtime critics of
U.S. military involvement abroad. Demonstrators have begun to
appear in Lafayette Square across Pennsylvania Avenue from the
White House. On one recent afternoon, reprising a refrain from the
Vietnam era, they shouted, ``Hell no, we won't go!''
   And the president has his all-out backers as well. ``I support
his action and know he has far more advisers with a lot more
knowledge of what's going on than I could ever imagine,'' said
Darlene Brown of Rockville, Md., president of the Young Republicans
of Montgomery County.
   Yet Jordan of the Quaker-based Friends Service Committee said he
is getting calls from people, hardly any of them Quakers, from a
``wide variety of fairly ordinary backgrounds.''
   ``We see people from hillbilly country in West Virginia, folks
in Idaho, all kinds,'' he said. ``We are getting calls from pay
booths on military installations. Some people have made it clear
that if they are ordered they are not going. These are people who
have been pushed over the edge by the Persian Gulf situation.''

<HEAD>Tough Anti-Tax Measures Face Voters in 11 States</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in 11 states may vent their frustration over government
waste and sluggish school reform by passing some of the toughest
taxing and spending limits ever considered.
   The number of anti-tax, anti-spending measures on Nov. 6 ballots
doesn't match the peak ``tax revolt'' years in the early 1980s: 18
states had them in 1980, just two years after California's
Proposition 13 started it all.
   But several of this year's crop rank with the most stringent
ever considered - a gauge of how fed up many voters may be over
what they see as government waste, excessive or unfair taxes, and a
much-touted school reform movement that has yet to live up to its
promise.
   ``These people are saying to government, you've failed us.
People are really, really up in arms,'' said John Keast, an analyst
specializing in ballot measures for the conservative Free Congress
Foundation in Washington, D.C.
   And to the dismay of many politicians and educators who stand to
lose the most if the measures are passed, opinion polls show
several with an excellent chance of approval.
   ``They're all bad and we're working hard to defeat them,'' said
Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association, the
2-million member teachers union. ``It would be a tremendous blow to
public education in any state that passed them.''
   Among the toughest:
   - Massachusetts' Question 3, a $2 billion tax rollback, 15
percent of the state budget. It would be the largest state tax cut
in history. Opponents argue it would gut public education and lead
to tens of thousands of state layoffs. But polls show broad
support.
   - Oregon's Measure 5, a permanent cap of 1.5 percent on property
tax increases phased in by 1995. Oregon voters defeated five
previous attempts to limit taxes. This time, an early poll shows 69
percent favoring.
   - Colorado's Amendment 1, requiring voter approval for any state
or local tax increases, effective Dec. 31. A similar proposal lost
by a wide margin in 1988.
   - Nebraska's Measure 405, which backers call the ``2 percent
Solution,'' would put a 2 percent limit on annual state and local
budget increases. Local spending restrictions could be overriden by
referendum; at the state level, it would take a vote of 40 of the
49 legislators.
   - California's 28 statewide ballot measures include three
proposed tax increases, among them a sharp hike in alcohol taxes.
But another issue that would require a two-thirds majority on any
ballot issue raising taxes could instantly cancel out any such tax
increases.
   - In Montana, a proposed constitutional amendment would abolish
all state income, property and sales taxes and licensing fees,
replacing them with a scantly defined ``transaction charge'' of 1
percent on all financial dealings. The plan is so radical that
neither backers nor opponents seem sure if it would increase or cut
taxes.
   A second Montana initiative would hike the state cigarette tax
140 percent to 43 cents a pack, which would be the highest in the
nation.
   Elsewhere, Utah voters will decide whether to exempt most food
from the state sales tax. A Florida proposal would permit local
governments to avoid complying with state laws requiring local
funding unless the law fulfills ``an important state purpose.'' An
advisory referendum in Wisconsin asks whether the state should be
required to pay for any program it mandates on local governments.
   In Nevada, Gov. Bob Miller and state business groups have begun
a $200,000 media campaign o defeat a proposed corporate tax
increase to aid education. The state teachers union, the original
backer, withdrew its support when it was assured that another tax
package would be supported in the 1991 legislative session. But
polls still suggest the outcome could go either way.
   Nevadans also will vote on a constitutional amendment
prohibiting personal income taxes. A similar initiative passed in
1988 but must be approved a second time to become part of the state
constitution.
   Three Maryland counties, Anne Arundel, Baltimore and Montgomery,
will vote on proposed property tax limits. A fourth, wealthy Talbot
County, will decide whether to relax an existing property tax
freeze.
   The Massachusetts and Oregon issues are among the most worrisome
to the NEA's Geiger. In Oregon, the tax issue is one of eight
volatile ballot initiatives and the potential for confusion is
high, he said.
   Massachusetts officials fear the poorest school districts
including Fall River, New Bedford, Holyoke and Lawrence might go
bankrupt because they rely almost solely on state education aid.
   ``We would be on the brink of an educational meltdown,'' said
state Education Commissioner Harold Raynolds Jr.
   The tax battle has also turned bitter in Nebraska, where college
leaders, local educators and municipal officials are claiming
disaster and massive layoffs if the 2-percent cap is passed.
   But Omaha tax activist Ed Jaksha, who led the successful
petition drive, challenged those dire predictions.
   ``Can any of you deny the right of the people to enter into the
budget making process?'' he demanded at a summit of mayors last
month.

   Watergate was a word you learned in grade
school. Your teen-age years coincided with the ``me decade.'' And
come job-hunting time, the ``greed-is-good'' mantra from ``Wall
Street'' echoed everywhere.
   You belong to a generation that is ``less anchored in bedrock
ethical values than any other,'' according to a study by the
Josephson Institute for the Advancement of Ethics.
   ``An unprecedented proportion of today's youth lack commitment
to core moral values like honesty, personal responsibility, respect
for others and civic duty,'' concludes the report scheduled for
release Friday.
   But critics - including educators, ethicists and some of the
18-to-30-year-olds in question - say the Los Angeles-based,
non-profit institute's study is overstated.
   ``I don't see rampant amorality,'' said Stephen F. Davis, a
psychology professor at Emporia State University of Kansas. His
survey on cheating among 6,000 college students nationwide was one
of about a dozen studies on which Michael Josephson based his
report.
   ``There are some messages in our data but certainly I wouldn't
go so far as to indict an entire generation based on it,'' Davis
said this week.
   But Josephson said his conclusions, which were drawn from
published and unpublished polls, articles and about 40 original
interviews, indicated ``a meaningful, demonstrable ... discernible
disintegration'' in moral standards.
   ``It's a total picture that really tells the story,'' said
Josephson, whose non-partisan institute conducts ethics programs
for the Internal Revenue Service, the Pentagon, several major media
organizations and educators.
   The study's source material included surveys conducted at the
California Department of Education, Rutgers University, the
University of Delaware and the Higher Education Research Institute
at the University of California, Los Angeles.
   Among the indicators Josephson cites:
   - During the 1980s, the majority of college freshman surveyed
admitted to cheating in high school.
   - Young Americans are 40 percent less likely to identify
frequent newsmakers than those over age 30; those 24 or under vote
less than any previous generation.
   - Professional resume and reference-checking services estimate
that from 10 percent to 25 percent of jobseekers - a large
percentage of whom are under 30 - falsify their credentials.
   - A recent published survey found 70 percent of females under 18
were sexually active in 1989 compared with 54 percent a decade
earlier; for males, the increase was from 66 percent in 1979 to 72
percent last year.
   ``It's an interpretation of many isolated pieces of information.
They're entitled to their interpretation and maybe they're right,
but I'm not in agreement,'' said Elaine El-Khawas, vice president
for research at the American Council on Education in Washington,
D.C. ``I find much that is heartening.''
   John Gabarro, a professor at the Harvard Business School,
agreed.
   ``I've been teaching now for about 18 years and I have not
experienced a decline in either the ethical values that students
espouse or their concern with those issues,'' Gabarro said. ``In
fact, if anything I've seen a keener awareness and interest.''
   This is the generation that has watched the stock market
plummet, the real estate market bust and the environment grow
worse. They rattle off names like Gary Hart, Michael Milken, Ivan
Boesky and Donald Trump.
   ``We've seen that happiness isn't just getting ahead at any
cost,'' said Laura Rich, 25, a medical student at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ``We're trying to make ourselves
happy ... but don't see a reason to abandon our morals.''
   Arthur Levine, director of Harvard University's educational
management institute, said young adults are a product of the ``me
era,'' and do in many ways feel a false sense of entitlement.
   But after more than a decade of surveying his students' values,
Levine said he has noticed a welcome swing in recent years toward
community commitment and social awareness.
   ``I'm very optimistic about this generation,'' he said.
   ``There will always be people willing to do anything to get
something,'' said Beth Springer, a brand assistant at The Clorox
Co. in Oakland, Calif. ``But there are also lots of people looking
to give back to their community.''
   But Josephson's study concludes otherwise.
   ``There are undeniable signs that the moral fiber of our country
is weakening,'' the study warns. ``The new generation acts as if
the world owes them, as if they have a right to win, as if they
need whatever they want and deserve whatever they need.''

   They are in their third month of holding out
against all odds - 10 U.S. diplomats refusing to bow to Iraq's
annexation of Kuwait or to leave other Americans in the terrorized
Persian Gulf country without an official U.S. presence.
   Not that Ambassador W. Nathaniel Howell and his beleaguered
staff can do much for their 500 or so countrymen, many of whom are
in hiding and several of whom are desperately ill.
   Telephone conversations are intentionally brief, on the
supposition that Iraqi eavesdroppers are listening for useful
information about the whereabouts of the elusive Americans, their
risk-taking Kuwaiti protectors or Washington's intentions.
   Through satellite communication, the embassy also is in touch
with the State Department.
   Periodically, Iraqi troops seize Americans and dispatch them to
oil fields and other installations to serve as human shields
against a U.S. assault. They are beyond the reach of Howell and the
other diplomats, who themselves are prohibited from leaving the
embassy.
   Nor can anyone or any vehicle enter the embassy with supplies or
for whatever reason.
   More than 100 Americans are forcibly scattered through Kuwait,
which Iraqi President Saddam Hussein now regards as a province of
his country. There is no indication that the Bush administration is
hatching a plot to rescue them.
   One by one, other governments have yielded to circumstances and
closed their embassies. Among Western nations, only Britain,
Canada, France and Germany are holding out along with the United
States.
   Conditions inside the compound are rough. An undisclosed number
of Americans who managed to take refuge there are sharing limited
resources with the diplomats.
   Water and electricity were cut off a month ago as Iraq tried to
enforce its order for foreign embassies to close now that Kuwait no
longer was an independent country.
   The Americans were reduced to boiling the water in the embassy
swimming pool. There is some water left, but it is not being
replenished.
   Bathing is out, of course. Generators provide intermittent
electricity. Howell, deputy ambassador Barbara Bodine and the other
Americans are using outside latrines.
   They sometimes sleep outdoors at night to keep cool, despite
swarms of mosquitoes, according to Jesse Jackson and others who
returned from Kuwait last month.
   ``Their food situation is adequate,'' a U.S. official told The
Associated Press on Wednesday.
   The Americans are subsisting on canned food and perishable items
that were stocked in the embassy before Iraq's Aug. 2 blitzkrieg
invasion. Nothing has come in since.
   ``I don't want to speculate how long they are going to hold
out,'' said the official, who requested anonymity.
   The 10 American diplomats are the remnants of a once-sizable
embassy. Before the invasion, the heat and dearth of fast-breaking
events made assignment to Kuwait less than exciting.
   On the other hand, the wealth and stability of the oil-rich
emirate made Kuwait one of the least difficult posts in the Arab
world.
   About 50 American diplomats and their families left for Baghdad
in a motorcade in August only to find when they got there that only
the dependents were permitted to fly home. So those diplomats also
are stuck, but under less onerous conditions.
   Life in the Kuwait embassy is ``kind of hot, stuffy and
boring,'' the U.S. official said. ``They are still there because we
don't recognize the annexation, we will not recognize an order
based on annexation, and we want to help American citizens.''
   The countries that gave up haven't accepted annexation either.
``They left because they were no longer able to maintain their
personnel,'' the official said.
   Among the Americans, he said, ``morale is pretty high. And yet,
they are bored stiff.''

   Here are key provisions in the
deficit-reduction plan being considered today by the Senate Finance
Committee. The plan was proposed by the chairman, Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas.
   The House Ways and Means Committee is considering a similar
package, although Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., has not yet
presented his recommendations.
   ENERGY: Raise the 9-cent gasoline tax by another 9 cents in two
steps. Home-heating oil would not be affected.
   ALCOHOL: Double the beer tax to 32 cents a six-pack. Raise taxes
on all types of wine; table wine, for example, would go from the
present 3 cents a 750-milliliter bottle to 25 cents. The tax on
100-proof liquor, now $12.50 a gallon, would rise to $13.70, or
$2.74 a fifth.
   TOBACCO: Raise the 16-cent tax on cigarettes by 8 cents in two
steps. Taxes on chewing tobacco, cigars, snuff and pipe tobacco
would go up 25 percent.
   LUXURIES: Impose a 10 percent tax on the portion of the sales
price of cars over $30,000; jewelry and furs over $5,000 and boats
over $100,000.
   AIRLINE TICKETS: Raise the 8 percent tax to 10 percent.
   MEDICARE WAGES: Apply the 1.45 percent tax that finances part of
Medicare to a worker's first $85,000 to $90,000 of wages each year,
rather than the first $51,300 under present law.
   MEDICARE: Boost to $100 the $75-a-year deductible that
beneficiaries must pay before Medicare begins paying hospital
costs. There would be no increase in the monthly premiums for
Medicare Part B.
   CAPITAL GAINS: Exclude from taxation 30 percent of gains from
the sale of property owned three or more years.
   INCOME-TAX RATES: Eliminate a provision in the law that taxes
part of the earnings of the wealthiest Americans at a top rate of
28 percent, while people earning slightly less can face a maximum
rate of 33 percent. This would mean a tax increase, for example,
for a single person with taxable income above $97,620 and for a
couple with no children and a taxable income above $162,770.

<HEAD>101st Congress Has Much to Do and Little Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two weeks from the end of its two-year term,
the 101st Congress has little to brag about and much to do.
   The preoccupation with getting a budget has backed up other
important legislation on subjects ranging from clean air and
housing to civil rights and child care.
   With anti-incumbent sentiment running high across the country,
no member of Congress wants to face voters having done little more
than approve job protection rights for the disabled, an inadequate
savings and loan bailout and a congressional pay raise.
   ``It's been a thin session so far, there's no question about
it,'' said Thomas Mann, who studies Congress for the Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank.
   Before they can go home for an abbreviated campaign season,
lawmakers still must pass the nuts and bolts: taxes and spending
cuts to enact the vague guidelines they have agreed to in the
budget; and the 13 annual spending bills needed to run the
government through next Sept. 30.
   That won't be easy. The bill implementing the budget agreement
will have to include $135 billion or more in new taxes, possibly
including levies on gasoline, alcoholic beverages and cigarettes,
and about $40 billion in Medicare savings including higher
deductibles for beneficiaries.
   ``If the budget deal is genuine, that overwhelms everything else
and becomes the major piece of legislation by which the Congress is
remembered,'' said Mann. ``They will have tackled the biggest
problem that has haunted government for a decade.''
   On top of those must-d bills, leaders in both houses have a
pared-down list of other items they want badly to complete.
   Topping the list is a compromise Clean Air Act, the first
rewrite since 1977 of the law setting air quality standards. The
House and Senate have passed significantly different versions, and
negotiators have struggled since July to reconcile them, with
little success.
   The bill would impose broad new air pollution control
requirements on factories, power plants and automobiles to ease
acid rain and urban smog, and for the first time require broad
industrial controls on toxic chemical releases.
   Estimates are that it would cost as much as $25 billion a year
to comply with the tougher regulations when they go into effect
toward the end of this decade.
   Another top priority is legislation providing federal child care
assistance, including money to low-income families through tax
credits. The House and Senate have passed differing versions, and
the bills have been stuck in a conference committee for months. But
congressional leaders are pushing their negotiators to agree so a
bill can be sent to President Bush.
   Negotiations are continuing, as well, to compromise on House and
Senate versions of a bill providing support for affordable housing
for low-income families.
   One little-noticed measure that falls into the must-pass
category is new money for the Resolution Trust Corp., which has run
dry as it seeks to take over failed savings and loans. An estimated
$90 billion will be needed this year to cover losses and provide
working capital.
   House and Senate conferees also are to begin resolving
differences over an anti-crime bill, following House action last
week to broaden use of capital punishment and curtail the appeal
rights of death row inmates.
   Negotiations on a new five-year farm bill, which stalled over
indecision on the budget, were to continue today with discussion of
conservation provisions. Still to be worked out is exactly how
commodity subsidies will be trimmed to make the required $13
billion in savings over the life of the bill.
   Also pending, and facing a presidential veto threat, is a civil
rights bill aimed at protecting employees from job discrimination.
Elements range from a ban on racial harassment in the workplace to
a provision locking in court-approved fair-hiring agreements.
   The core of the bill would ease the way for minorities to win
discrimination suits against employers. The administration and some
business groups say the Senate-passed measure would prompt
companies to hire by quota as a way of insulating themselves
against such suits. The bill would negate or modify 10 Supreme
Court decisions since 1985.
   While the leaders would like to avoid it, many on Capitol Hill
believe Congress may have to come back after the elections in
November for a lame-duck session to tackle unfinished business.
   Other items expected to come up in the final days of the
congressional session include:
   -An intelligence authorization bill that has been the focus of a
battle between the House and Senate over whether to continue covert
U.S. support for rebels in Angola, Afghanistan and Cambodia.
   -A bill authorizing activities of the National Endowment for the
Arts, and deciding how far the government should go in determining
whether a work is obscene.
   -An extension of the nation's borrowing authority to $3.444
trillion.
   -Whether to grant most-favored-nation trading status to China.

   You can't step into a phone booth in the Saudi
Arabian desert and dial up Westport, Mass., but Army Spec. 4 Mike
Orr still managed a chat with his wife, Jennifer.
   The 22-year-old father was told that his 2-month-old son, whom
he has seen only briefly, ate baby cereal for the first time
Monday.
   ``He made some funny faces,'' Mrs. Orr said.
   ``I wish I could have been there,'' he answered.
   When the soldiers who are part of Operation Desert Shield yearn
to hear a voice from home, they have to wait in line at Jeeps to
use short-wave radios.
   They're connected with relatives and friends back home thanks to
the hundreds of people in the United States who are licensed to
operate on military radio channels and link the transmissions to
phone lines.
   One of them, James Sylvester, operates from the basement of his
Queens apartment as a part of the Military Affiliated Radio System.
   Sylvester and everyone else who uses the radio system never say
Saudi Arabia or the desert. They simply refer to it as ``the
sandbox.''
   In the last three weeks, Sylvester has made more than 350
connections between GIs and the folks at home, while continuing to
work at his regular job, as a bus mechanic for the Transit
Authority.
   On some nights, he has skipped sleep entirely rather than leave
soldiers disappointed in the desert.
   Sometimes the static makes mincemeat of the dialogue.
   For instance, Army soldier 20-year-old Rick Pascoe of Wildwood,
Ill., asked Brigid Cromie, a family friend, to make sure he is sent
20 cans of tuna fish in water. The word ``in'' got lost in the
transmission.
   ``I'll ask them to send 20 cans of tuna and a couple of jugs of
water,'' Cromie told him.
   ``No, tuna in water, not water,'' Pascoe corrected.
   Nearly all of the messages are simple. The soldiers ask about
relatives. One asked about a car. Another warned his brother to use
condoms. Relatives on the home end ask about the weather or if mail
is being received.
   ``The mail is stockpiling. It's being handed out very slowly,''
said Orr.
   ``Is it real hot?'' his wife asked.
   ``It's 3 o'clock in the morning and it's probably 75 degrees,''
he replied.
   Each person being called in the United States must be told to
say ``over'' at the end of each statement so Sylvester knows when
to flick the switch back so the soldier can do the talking.
   The soldiers are warned not to tell about their mission or
location. They are limited to five minutes each.
   One of the soldiers operating a radio from a Jeep in the desert
Monday was Sgt. Rich Larue of Scranton, Pa.
   ``It makes my job really worthwhile,'' he said. ``The guys are
really happy once they're connected to be able to talk to their
family or spouse.''
   Sylvester agreed.
   ``Some really turn loose,'' he said, referring to calls that
bring more tears than words. ``I think after this I might change
occupations and become a psychologist.''
   ``I love you'' was the most common message among about 15 calls
placed Monday evening. One woman cried while she spoke. It appeared
to matter little what was said.
   ``Some people don't care about static,'' Sylvester said. ``As
long as they hear a little of the person's voice, that's all that
matters.''

   Government job recruiting will suffer
following the latest budget dispute, say federal workers who call
the weekend shutdown a direct threat to their job security.
   ``If you were in the top 5 percent of your class, and were
excited about doing some significant research for a cure for AIDS,
would you want to come to work for the federal government? I think
not,'' said John Sturdivant, president of the American Federation
of Government Employees.
   Federal workers have always known they're not going to get rich,
added Robert Tobias, president of the National Treasury Employees
Union. ``But there was an implicit agreement that they had job
security. That agreement has been ripped apart the past few
weeks.''
   But government hiring officials dismissed the likelihood of any
long-term damage from the weekend government shutdown.
   ``Other than a political brouhaha in Washington, I'm not sure
abot any lingering effects on recruitment. This could all be
forgotten in three weeks,'' said Richard McGowan, a spokesman for
the Office of Personnel Management.
   ``How much is a kid on a university campus in Cleveland paying
attention to this? It looms very large for us in Washington. My own
estimate is it probably won't have a big impact on the campuses in
the hinterlands,'' added Len Klein, OPM's director of hiring.
   The government's below-average pay scale - not job security
concerns - is what's hurting recruitment, Klein said.
   Hundreds of thousands of federal workers were spared Tuesday, at
least temporarily, from being furloughed after Congress and the
White House struck a budget deal and ended a government shutdown
that hit over the three-day Columbus Day holiday weekend.
   The shutdown affected mostly national monuments, parks and
museums, which were closed for lack of workers as thousands of
disappointed tourists were turned away.
   The threat of a government shutdown had hung over federal
employees for weeks. They still could face furloughs if lawmakers
can't reach a budget agreement by Oct. 19.
   The well-publicized budget dispute - and the way federal workers
were caught up in it - will make government work less appealing,
especially while the government is trying to spruce up its image,
said Sturdivant, president of the 700,000-member AFGE.
   The federal government already has a bad knock for its pay
scale. Federal workers, on average, earn about 22 percent less than
their counterparts in the private sector, Sturdivant said. In
addition, the government pays about $1,100 a year less in health
care premiums for each worker than is paid by the average
medium-sized or large corporation.
   However, OPM's McGowan dismissed the likelihood of any long-term
impact, saying there are dozens of ``rewarding and challenging''
career paths available in the civil service.
   In March, OPM waged a six-city job fair blitz in a bid to lure
new hires, bringing along astronauts and undercover agents to show
off government careers, McGowan noted.
   ``We had 30,000 people wrapped around the Labor Department (in
Washington) trying to get into government service,'' he said.
   Federal workers said the latest threat of a shutdown is hurting
the United States in other ways.
   ``Other countries of the world have got to be laughing their
heads off. We try to run the world, but we can't manage our own
affairs,'' complained Tom Doherty, an Occupational Safety and
Health Administration inspector from Allentown, Pa.
   ``You have no idea the turmoil this has caused for some people,
the ones trying to support a family on one paycheck,'' Doherty
said. ``I keep telling them, your voice is at the ballot box. Come
election time, good, bad or indifferent, we just go in and vote for
the guy's opponent.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Defends Abrasive Sununu</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Sununu may have the reputation on Capitol
Hill of a bull in a china shop, but his boss says ``there's bound
to be a little broken china'' when passions get high.
   President Bush rallied to the defense of his abrasive chief of
staff and his almost equally abrasive budget director, Richard G.
Darman. ``I have full confidence in them,'' Bush said at a news
conference Tuesday. ``They did an outstanding job.''
   Even so, following the collapse of a budget agreement negotiated
by the White House and congressional leaders, the two top White
House aides have been the target of heavy criticism from
congressional budget negotiators of both parties.
   Sununu and Darman got the vote of confidence from the man who
counts.
   But the residual hard feelings could make it harder for Bush to
patch up differences with congressional leaders - and heal the
gaping rift among House Republicans - in the coming days.
   At one point last weekend, Democratic budget negotiators refused
to meet with their Republican counterparts if Sununu and Darman
were at the table.
   Rep. Jim Lightfoot, R-Iowa, wrote a letter to Bush urging him to
come to Capitol Hill on a peacekeeping mission but to leave the
``pit bulldogs'' at the White House.
   Lawmakers have bristled at what they say is Sununu's arrogance
and heavy-handedness in dealing with members of Congress.
   Sununu, asked by reporters Tuesday if he thought he had gone too
far, retorted: ``I don't think so. We got a budget passed, didn't
we?''
   Bush, asked if he had taken any members of his staff to the
woodshed as a result of the congressional criticism, said:
``Absolutely not.''
   ``When the passions get high, I understand that there's bound to
be a little broken china up there,'' the president said.
   It's not the first time that Sununu has been in trouble with
Congress on budget issues - or that Bush had to rally to his
defense.
   Early in the budget negotiations last summer, Sununu suggested
that the president really didn't mean it when he suggested for the
first time that he would consider tax increases to reduce the
deficit.
   Democrats were outraged. White House press secretary Marln
Fitzwater had to disavow the remarks. But in the end, Bush stood
fast by his embattled aide.
   Nor is Sununu the first presidential chief of staff to generate
harsh feelings.
   Donald T. Regan, who was President Reagan's chief of staff for
most of his second term, was almost universally disliked by
Democrats in Congress, many other White House staffers and -
perhaps more significantly - by first lady Nancy Reagan.
   Like Sununu, Regan was accused of being caustic and arrogant.
   Some of the same criticism was leveled at H.R. Haldeman,
President Nixon's heavy-handed chief of staff and a central figure
in the Watergate scandal.
   And President Carter's chief of staff, Hamilton Jordan, so
angered then-House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill, D-Mass., that O'Neill
deliberately and consistently mispronounced his name, calling him
``Hannibal Jerkin.''
   Lawmakers claimed Jordan was arrogant and insensitive and did
not understand the workings of Congress.
   An outsider to Washington, like Sununu, Jordan also didn't work
very hard at massaging huge congressional egos. In fact, he
probably wouldn't have gotten into so much trouble if he hadn't
slighted Tip O'Neill on inauguration tickets back in 1977.
   One budget negotiator, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said Sununu, a stamp collector, sometimes annoyingly sat at the
bargaining table leafing through stamp catalogues.
   In one episode, reported by The Washington Post, Sununu and
Darman put their nameplates along a row of chairs reserved for
congressional leaders - and that Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., moved them to the back of the table, saying, ``Staff
doesn't sit with the leadership.''
   Dole may have more reason to resent Sununu than most. It was
Sununu who organized Bush's New Hampshire primary campaign that was
the beginning of the end of Dole's 1988 presidential candidacy.
   But Bush shows no sign of losing confidence in either Sununu or
Darman, saying more Republicans have praised than criticized them.
``So what you hear is the squeaking wheel. You hear those that
aren't particularly happy,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Remember the 1960s with its miniskirts, hot
pants, shift dresses, colorful prints and false eyelashes?
   Thirty years later, the Milanese have brought it all back in a
sexier, more brazen version: hemlines are shorter, hips tighter and
breasts barer.
   Stretch cottons, rayons and silks are the latest fabrics. Prints
are not only painted on rich silk, but also stitched together in a
myriad of sparkling sequins.
   In the makeup department, eyes are as bright as a Barbie dolls',
with lashes longer than Liz Taylor ever batted at Richard Burton
during the 1961 filming of ``Anthony and Cleopatra.''
   The return of the dress is probably the most significant pickup
from the 1960s, especially for Milan, famous for its man-tailored
look.
   In fact, trousers have no place in the 1991 spring-summer
wardrobe. Legs are either bared by super-short hemlines and snug
shorts, or wrapped in skin-tight unitards.
   The new version of the shift is shorter, often rising to
mid-thigh, and tighter, especially when in stretch fabric.
   And there are lots of A-line and trapeze dresses, as well as
halter top sun dresses for town and beach wear.
   Perhaps most successful at the 1990s style was Krizia, who
showed her collection Tuesday.
   In this era of tough come-and-get-it design, the prettiness of
the Krizia collection was refreshing, as was the music which
accompanied the show - Nat King Cole oldies.
   Shifts in demure floral silk prints adorned the first part of
the show. For the cocktail hour, Mariuccia Mandelli, the lady
behind the Krizia label, offered white silk shifts trimmed with
silver, or simple silk apron dresses.
   As the evening went on hemlines got shorter, brushing the upper
thigh. Micro hot pants and bra tops appeared as a reminder that the
real '60s are behind us.
   There have not been a lot of clothes to wear to work in the
current collections, unless your job is an aerobics teacher or a
nightclub hostess.
   Therefore, Genny's neat, trim navy blue suits spruced up with
large gold buttons received grateful applause from fashion buyers,
worried about extravagant styles and shrinking pocketbooks.
   Genny also had a series of comfortable shifts in muted shades,
worn with matching duster jackets and accessoried with gold chain
belts with a buckle in the shape of a sea star.
   The Mediterranean motifs, starfish, coral branches and sea
plants appeared throughout the collection from patterns on daytime
blouses, to jewelry and belts, to elaborate sequined prints on
evening wear.
   Coral beads decorated simple black A-line dresses, while sea
blues and greens provided the background for the glittery coral and
starfish prints.
   The Genny collection, displayed at the midpoint of the five-day
ready-to-wear collections for next year's warmer weather, showed
that the 1960s could be revived without going to avant-garde
extremes, such as the pop-art sequined jackets and fiery hot pants
presented by Gianni Versace.
   The showbiz designer was hailed as the maestro of the 1990s by
fashion experts looking for inventive design.
   But buyers worried by recession, rising oil prices and a falling
dollar were relieved to see some stylish, sensible clothes.
   The fashion crowd was waiting to see what Gianfranco Ferre has
to say about all this in his new collection to be presented at the
Milan fairground, site of most of the collections seen this week.
   The final word on the 1960s styles with a 1990 sexy approach is
reserved for Giorgio Armani, father of Milan's tailored look, whose
collection closes the showings tonight.

   Former FBI agent Richard Miller was convicted
a second time of selling out his country to a Soviet seductress for
sex and promises of cash and gold.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi, who heard the case without
a jury, on Tuesday rejected Miller's claim that he romanced
Svetlana Ogorodnikov in a self-styled attempt to infiltrate the
KGB.
   Miller, 54, is the only agent in FBI history to be convicted of
espionage.
   The conviction on charges of passing secrets to the Soviets came
after six years and three trials in which prosecutors portrayed him
as a weak man lured into treason by lust and greed.
   The jury at his first trial deadlocked and the guilty verdict at
his second trial was overturned on grounds that lie detector
evidence was improperly admitted.
   Miller, who already has served five years in prison, could get
up to two life terms plus 50 years at sentencing Jan. 7. He was
allowed to remain free on bail.
   ``I'm dumbfounded. I didn't expect this outcome. I really
didn't,'' he said.
   The judge conceded that Miller may have first dreamed of using
his romance with the Soviet agent to infiltrate the KGB. But he
concluded that Miller ultimately became the tool of Mrs.
Ogorodnikov, a Russian emigre.
   ``In the battle of wills, Mr. Miller finally succumbed,
begrudgingly perhaps,'' Takasugi said. ``He became entangled with
Svetlana and compromised his position in the FBI.''
   Takasugi said the strongest evidence against Miller was an FBI
tape recording of Miller and Mrs. Ogorodnikov. The judge said the
conversation clearly demonstrated her dominance over the agent.
   In that discussion, Miller was heard telling his lover, ``You've
stolen my heart,'' to which Mrs. Ogorodnikov responded, ``That's my
job.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Schiff said Miller agreed to accept
$50,000 in gold and $15,000 in cash.
   Lawrence Lawler, agent in charge of the Los Angeles FBI office,
said the FBI assessment of damage from the spy scandal remains
classified.
   ``The relationship was not that old,'' Lawler said, adding that
damage could have been ``incalculable had it continued until
today.''
   Defense attorney Joel Levine had argued that the obese, inept
Miller was an FBI misfit who tried to redeem a 20-year career by
infiltrating the KGB.
   ``Mr. Miller's plan was procedurally flawed,'' Levine said.
``But everything Mr. Miller did in the FBI was procedurally
flawed.''
   The prosecutor argued Miller was ripe for recruitment when Mrs.
Ogorodnikov lured him with sex and money in 1984. By then, he said,
Miller had been repeatedly suspended for obesity; he was plagued by
financial problems, had been excommunicated from the Mormon church
for adultery, and his marriage was falling apart.
   ``She was exotic to him,'' Schiff argued. ``He slept with her
because he was infatuated with her, not because he was trying to
infiltrate the KGB.''
   Miller was arrested in 1984. The FBI claimed he had been about
to flee the country with Mrs. Ogorodnikov after passing her a
classified FBI document titled ``The Positive Intelligence
Reporting Guide.''
   Mrs. Ogorodnikov, who pleaded guilty and is serving an 18-year
term in federal prison, did not testify at the third trial.

<HEAD>US to Vote in UN Against Israel on Jerusalem Killings</HEAD>

   The Bush administration intends to condemn
Israel in the United Nations for using excessive force against
Palestinian Arabs in a melee outside the Temple Mount in Jerusalem,
U.S. officials say.
   At least 19 Arabs were killed and more than 100 wounded in a
battle Monday with Israeli police. Eleven Jews were hurt, as well,
in a barrage of rocks and bottles hurled by Arabs as the Jews
prayed at the Western Wall.
   Authorities in Israel said the police had responded to
rock-throwers who used the Temple Mount for violent activities. But
President Bush said the police should have exercised more
restraint, and American diplomats framed the resolution condemning
Israeli security forces during day-long negotiations Tuesday at the
United Nations.
   It was uncertain when the vote would take place because the U.N.
Security Council did not convene Tuesday night as scheduled.
Diplomats reported scant progress in their search for a compromise.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization, meanwhile, rejected the
U.S. draft as too weak.
   The United States rarely votes against Israel in the Security
Council. Two such instances were condemnation of Israel's
destruction of Iraq's nuclear facility near Baghdad in 1981 and
criticism of Israel's actions in Lebanon in 1982.
   Much more often the United States stands with Israel against
what generally is considered by the two governments as unjustified
or unfair criticism.
   The resolution, drafted by American diplomats, was adopted by
the four other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council - the
Soviet Union, China, Britain and France - and is thus veto-proof,
said the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   It condemns the violence that broke out Monday ``and
particularly the excessive Israeli response,'' one official said.
   The resolution also welcomes a decision by U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to send a delegation to
Jerusalem to investigate the incident.
   The officials said the resolution calls on all parties to
refrain from violence. In a gesture to Israel, it expresses regret
that worshipers also were attacked.
   ``I am very, very saddened by this needless loss of life,'' Bush
said at a news conference Tuesday.
   He added: ``Israeli security forces need to be better prepared
for such situations, need to act with greater restraint,
particularly when it comes to the use of deadly force...''
   Meanwhile, the State Department in a travel advisory suggested
Americans avoid the West Bank and Gaza because of recurrent
disturbances in the territories.
   A department notice said U.S. citizens who must travel there
``should be aware of continuing unrest and tension, including
stone-throwing, which can affect visitors.''
   At the United Nations, a representative from occupied Kuwait
joined Iraq, which annexed his country, and more than 30 speakers
in condemning Israel's treatment of Palestinians and demanding that
Israeli withdraw from territories captured in the 1967 Middle East
war.
   ``We know full well the bitterness and sufferings of the unarmed
Palestinian people under occupation, because we are passing through
a similar experience,'' said Sheik Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah
of Kuwait.
   Iraq's deputy permanent envoy Sabah Talat Kadrat accused the
United States and its allies of ``hypocrisy'' for shielding Israel
over the years and failing to condemn and punish Israel for
violence against Palestinians.
   During his news conference, Bush appealed for ``calm on all
sides'' and three times referred to ``the Palestine question'' as
needing a solution. Previous presidents are not known to have used
the phrase.
   Arabs and their supporters long have demanded the establishment
of a state called Palestine on Israeli-held land. Bush's Mideast
policy deals with East Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank as
occupied territory but has been opposed to Palestinian statehood.
   The president did not intend to signal anything with the phrase
and there is ``no change in policy,'' said Roman Popadiuk, a deputy
White House press secretary.
   Bush also said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein should not use
``this unfortunate incident'' to link his occupation and annexation
of Kuwait and its oil fields with the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.

<TEXT>
   President Bush says he doesn't want to submit
his presidency to the psychiatrist's couch, but he agrees that he
finds it more satisfying to deal with a foreign crisis than one
closer to home.
   The president conceded, for example, that he was more
comfortable putting together the coalition of nations that confront
Saddam Hussein in the Persian Gulf than horsetrading with Congress
on a deficit solution.
   Bush offered his observations at a news conference Tuesday when
he was asked, ``Why do you think you're so much more comfortable
with and better at foreign matters than domestic?''
   The questioner continued: `To some people, it seems like almost
two presidents.''
   ``I've read that sophisticated analysis,'' Bush replied, ``and
I'm troubled because I don't really know the answer to it.''
   He said he did not want ``to get stretched out on the couch too
far in terms of analysis'' of his conduct of the presidency, but he
didn't quarrel with the questioner's proposition.
   ``People really basically want to support the president on
foreign affairs and partisanship does, in a sense, stop at the
water's edge,'' Bush said. ``Whereas on domestic policy, here I am
with Democratic majorities in the Senate and Democratic majorities
in the House, having to try to persuade them to do what I think is
best.''
   On the Persian Gulf crisis, he said he enjoyed trying to ``put
the coalition together and keep it together and work towards what I
think is a proper end, seeing that this aggression doesn't succeed.
   ``I can't say I just rejoice every time I go up and talk to
Danny Rostenkowski, my dear friend, about what he's going to do on
taxes.'' Rostenkowski is an Illinois Democrat who chairs the House
Ways and Means Committee.
   Bush's questioner commented, ``It doesn't sound like you have as
much fun (with a domestic problem) than with the other.'' The
president replied, ``That's about right.''

<DATELINE>GIZA PLATEAU, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even death couldn't free some workers
from their bosses, archaeologists are finding in a newly discovered
cemetery near the pyramids.
   It's the first burial ground ever found for the Egyptian working
man of 45 centuries ago.
   Five other cemeteries with 4,000 tombs flank the pyramids, on
the horizon above. But all 4,000 were reserved for royalty, their
families and officials, said Zahi Hawass, director-general of
antiquities for the pyramids area and the new dig's excavation
chief.
   ``What we haven't found until now is the working class,'' said
Hawass. ``We were shocked when we looked at inscriptions of who was
buried in the new tombs. Overseers holding their sticks. And
behind, skeletons of workers.''
   He said it appears the workers were members of the foremen's
crews.
   The first eight tombs, three miles south of the Sphinx, lie at
the base of sand hills stretching endlessly into the desert. Hawass
said the cemetery undoubtedly extends deep into the dunes.
   Tombs date from the fourth dynasty - 4,600 years ago when the
Giza pyramids were built - until the sixth, 300 years later. It's a
mysterious period when legend says workers grew tired of almighty
pharaohs and of building pyramids for them.
   Because no middle-class burials had been discovered on sacred
Giza plateau, some Egyptologists have theorized that the afterlife
was perceived as off-limits to the working man. But the new
cemetery proves that pharaonic blue-collar workers prepared for
eternity as their betters did, being buried with amulets, limestone
tablets, offering tables, pottery vessels and more.
   The largest tomb, built for a fifth-dynasty overseer named
Ptah-Shepses, is 20 feet by 6{ feet with an arched ceiling.
   To the rear of the tomb, in a honeycomb of compartments,
excavators found six skeletons buried in the fetal position. Hawass
said they were members of one work crew.
   Ancient Egyptians didn't practice human sacrifice, so the
workers were not killed and buried at the same time as their
bosses. And Hawass said there's no indication so far how a foreman
chose the workers to be buried near him.
   ``Perhaps they were his favorites. Or perhaps we'll find others
when we keep digging,'' Hawass said. ``We have no idea how many
people an overseer would have had on his staff.''
   Foremen handled day-to-day administration of the pharaohs'
estates, with responsibilities comparable to farm managers or
assembly-line supervisors in today's world. ``They dressed better,
ate better and wanted better tombs than the men who worked for
them,'' Hawass said.
   ``They looked at the pyramids and the fancy tombs of the
officials. They knew they couldn't afford such luxury. Still they
wanted a nice place to spend eternity.''
   More information about the ancient blue-collar workers will come
from medical tests Egyptian doctors are performing on the
skeletons. Data is expected to indicate the workers' general
appearance, their height and weight, what they ate, what diseases
bothered them, even what killed them.
   In 1987, Hawass and Egyptologist Mark Lehner of Yale University
began a search for homes of workers who built the three Giza
pyramids. At a site some distance from the monuments, they
uncovered ruins of a business center and other artifacts.
   They stopped excavating in early 1988. The recently discovered
tombs lay undetected only a few feet away.
   But early last summer, a tourist hired a saddle horse for a ride
around the pyramids. During the tour her horse fell through the
sand, ending on top of what proved to be the roof of the first
tomb.
   Nobody got the tourist's name, and chances are she still doesn't
know her outing made history.
   For years, riders heading for the most spectacular view of the
pyramids have passed in front of the Sphinx and through an ancient
stone gate into the desert.
   No records existed to explain the gate.
   But ``once we found the cemetery we understood,'' Hawass said.
``The gate divided the world of the pharaohs from the world of the
average man.''
   He explained that the foremen and their crews lived and were
buried in their own world behind the gate. By day they passed
through the gate into their pharaoh's sacred world, then returned
at sunset to work on their own tombs.

   Rep. Lynn Martin's media adviser called
Democratic Sen. Paul Simon a ``weenie'' and said he was ``slimy.''
   Simon has ``slandered'' Martin by running TV ads that say the
former teacher is an enemy of senior citizens and schools, said
Roger Ailes, the ad man who formerly worked for President Bush's
campaign.
   Ailes acknowledged Tuesday that Martin voted against increasing
Medicare spending and against lowering the rate of out-of-pocket
costs, ``but these were not votes to cut Medicare.''
   ``Simon is just being Simon, which is unfortunately being
slimy,'' Ailes said at a news conference.
   Ailes also called Simon a ``weenie,'' a comment that later led
to an apology from Martin, the Republican challenging Simon for his
Senate seat Nov. 6. Martin trails Simon in polls and is running out
of money for ads.
   Simon campaign manager Anne Roosevelt said Martin is ``getting
awfully desperate if she's sending in her media adviser as a
hatchet man to call Paul Simon names.''
   Roosevelt said calling Simon ``slimy is a little like Saddam
Hussein complaining about American aggression.''

failure to file federal campaign reports for two years.
   The Republican is challenging Democratic Rep. Jerry Costello but
admits he hasn't filed financial reports on his 1988 run against
Costello.
   ``It hurts my candidacy, there is no question about that,'' he

   He promised to have financial reports in the mail to the Federal
Election Commission no later than Friday.
   Gaffner's father, who is 90, is gravely ill, and the candidate
said he had been working to liquidate his father's truck-repair
business.
   Also, Gaffner recently completed a successful campaign on behalf
of his employer, St. Louis Community College, to get voter approval

   Television's old favorites continue to
dominate the fall season while most of the networks' new shows draw
mediocre ratings.
   For the third consecutive week, NBC's 9-year-old ``Cheers'' was
the most-watched show on television, followed by the network's
``The Cosby Show.''
   In the overall ratings, NBC squeaked past the competition for
the No. 1 spot, the A.C. Nielsen Co. reported Tuesday. NBC had a
12.9 average, ABC a 12.6 and CBS a 12.3. Each ratings point
represents 931,000 homes.
   Since the Sept. 17 opening of the new season, the networks have
been separated by less than a point.
   The only new show among last week's top 10 was ABC's ``America's
Funniest People,'' in seventh place.
   ``Grand,'' which aired in the spring as a replacement series,
placed 14th with its fall premiere.
   The next-highest spot claimed by a new program was 32nd place,
where CBS' ``The Trials of Rosie O'Neill,'' featuring former
``Cagney &amp; Lacey'' star Sharon Gless, tied with NBC's ``Fresh
Prince of Bel-Air,'' starring the rap star Fresh Prince.
   CBS' first ever baseball playoff coverage provided lackluster
ratings.
   The second game of the American League playoffs between Oakland
and Boston, broadcast Sunday, ranked 28th. The first game of the
National League playoffs between Cincinnati and Pittsburgh,
broadcast Thursday, ranked 41st.
   In the network news, ABC and Peter Jennings placed first with a
10.2 average, followed by NBC and Tom Brokaw with an 8.5. CBS and
Dan Rather had an 8.2.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``Cheers,''
NBC, 21.1; ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC, 19.5; ``A Different world,''
NBC, 19.4; ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC, 18.9;
``Designing Women,'' CBS, 18.2; ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 18.1;
``America's Funniest People,'' ABC, 18; ``Murphy Brown,'' CBS,
17.7; ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' NBC, 17.2; ``Golden Girls,'' NBC,
17.1.

<HEAD>Invasion Not Seen As Threat To Rare Gorillas, And May Even Help

<TEXT>
   Rwanda's rare mountain gorillas do not
appear endangered by a guerrilla insurgency, and may even benefit
if the fighting scares off tourists who in large numbers can
threaten the animals health, conservationists say.
   Since the rebels invaded the central African nation from
neighboring Uganda late last month the gorillas' habitat - the
setting for the 1988 movie ``Gorillas in the Mist'' - has remained
calm.
   Fighting has been concentrated in the north and northeast and in
the capital, Kigali, 75 miles southeast of the volcanic Virunga
Mountains where the world's remaining 310 mountain gorillas live.
   ``We are working on the basis that this will not alter the
existing conservation programs,'' a spokesman for the main
international wildlife consortium operating in Rwanda said by
telephone.
   The Kenya-based consortium includes the Africa Wildlife
Foundation, the Flora and Fauna Preservation Society and the
Worldwide Fund for Nature.
   It withdrew its foreign staff from Rwanda in January as part of
plans to form a new joint body to cover the gorillas' entire
remaining natural habitat along the borders with Uganda and Zaire.
   Revenue from gorilla-gazing tourists is Rwanda's third-largest
source of income. But conservationists have expressed concern over
the government's desire to increase the size of tourist parties
allowed into the narrow 25-mile strip of forest on foot.
   They argue that the present system of four groups of six
tourists per day is the maximum both the gorillas and the ecology
can stand.
   With an entry fee to the nature preserve of $200 per person, the
government wants to increase the size of the groups to eight people
each per day, with an even larger number during the peak mid-year
holiday season.
   ``It's tempting but it really is a question of whether you want
kill the goose that lays the golden egg,'' said Rosalind Eveling of
the Africa Wildlife Foundation in Nairobi. ``We are dealing with a
very fragile resource.''
   Groups of up to eight tourists were taken into the forest during
the peak season this year. But they were later reduced to the
original limit of six.
   ``We would be very concerned if they put it up again. From an
economic point of view, they also risk destroying the elite
experience of seeing the gorillas,'' she added.
   Because the treks on foot take several hours, tourists already
are allowed to hire African bearers to carry cameras, packed
lunches and extra clothing.
   According to conservation literature distributed by American
anthropologist Dian Fossey's Digit Fund, the gorillas risk catching
human illnesses from visitors or from their garbage, such as
eggshells and fruit peels.
   The fund says the rare primates are close enough biologically to
humans to be susceptible particularly to human parasites passed in
urine and feces. Tourists with contagious illnesses should never be
allowed into the Parc des Vulcans, says the fund.
   Fossey, portrayed in ``Gorillas in the Mist,'' was mysteriously
murdered in her mountain hut in 1985 while she worked to save the
animals from poachers. The Digit Fund, an Englewood, Colo.-based
organization, is named after a slain gorilla Fossey knew for its
twisted finger.
   Fossey got to know many gorilla families, making them
approachable to within the reach of a human arm, although touching
them is strictly prohibited today.
   For many years, the 200-pound, growling, chest-beating gorillas
were thoght of in the West as King Kongs, but ``Fossey discovered
they are gentle and understanding'' and only attack when provoked,
says the fund.
   The rebels, who invaded Sept. 30, belong mostly to Rwanda's
minority Tutsi ethnic group. They were chased from power three
decades ago by the majority Hutu tribe in clan fighting that killed
tens of thousands of people.
   The rebels accuse President Juvenal Habyarimana of abuse of
power and corruption and say they want to install a democratic
government.

<HEAD>House Panel Rebuffs Justice Department on Probe of Iraqi Loans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional investigators are rejecting a
protest from Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and continuing their
examination of secret loans to Iraq from an Italian bank's Atlanta
office.
   ``The Congress has the supremacy of the right to know and obtain
information,'' Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the
House Banking Committee, said Tuesday.
   Thornburgh told Gonzalez in a Sept. 26 letter that taking public
testimony from prosecutors and potential witnesses in the Banca
Nazionale del Lavoro case could jeopardize the Justice Department's
criminal investigation.
   He expressed his ``profound disappointment'' that Gonzalez had
ignored his department's ``strong objections'' and scheduled a
hearing for Oct. 16.
   ``This is a sensitive case with national security concerns,''
Thornburgh wrote.
   Gonzalez replied Tuesday that the case ``involves a serious
regulatory breakdown'' and could cost the U.S. government hundreds
of millions of dollars because it had guaranteed some of the loans.
   He said the committee would base its investigation on publicly
available information and said the administration's reluctance to
cooperate represented ``fear of embarrassment more than anything
else.''
   According to Gonzalez, the Atlanta office of the Rome-based
institution approved $2.9 billion in unauthorized loans to Iraq
during and just after its war with Iran. About $1.8 billion was
actually disbursed.
   The activity went undetected by Georgia banking regulators and
examiners from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and was not
stopped until August 1989, when the FBI raided the office.
   ``The state banking agency responsible ... fell asleep at the
switch, and the Federal Reserve ... was found asleep at the same
switch,'' Gonzalez charged.
   ``These unauthorized loans increased Iraq's credit capacity and
permitted Iraq to spend more of their scant hard currency on the
very weapons now aimed at our children,'' he said.
   Now, repayment is in doubt and U.S. taxpayers may end up owing
the Italian bank between $400 million and $600 million, according
to the Banking Committee's staff. The Agriculture Department's
Commodity Credit Corp. had guaranteed a portion of the loans, which
were used to purchase U.S. farm products.
   State and federal regulators are scheduled to appear before the
committee next week. Gonzalez said he would like to subpoena other
witnesses. But he could not on Tuesday because only he and three
others on the 51-member panel attended a meeting to hear a staff
aides outline the case. The House had been in session until early
morning working on budget legislation.
   Gonzalez said the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro affair raises
larger questions about whether U.S. laws are able to prevent
foreign governments from carrying out their policies through the
American banking system.
   Foreign banks now own more than $520 billion, or 22 percent, of
U.S. banking assets, he said.
   Banca Nazionale del Lavoro is primarily owned by the Italian
government and is Italy's second-largest bank. It fired most of its
employees in Atlanta and maintains the Iraqi loans were recorded
only on a secret set of books. It has said the loans were
unauthorized either by its regional headquarters in New York or by
top bank officials in Rome.
   However, Dennis M. Kane, a banking panel aide, said an internal
audit obtained by the committee showed bank officials in New York
were aware of discrepancies in the Atlanta office's books by the
end of 1988, yet failed to inform federal or state regulators.
   Italian legislators are investigating the case from Rome, where
it is referred to as Iraqgate.

<HEAD>Bush Praises Business Role in Campaign Against Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says American business is
making progress toward driving drug abuse out of the workplace and
the community at large.
   ``It's almost like some of you are adopting the communities in
which you live, and it's a wonderful thing,'' Bush told top
executives gathered Tuesday for a briefing from the administration
on drugs in the workplace.
   ``Now, many corporations fighting to make the workplace and the
larger community drug-free are exactly what we talk about when we
talk about this concept points of light,'' Bush said, referring to
his volunteerism. campaign.
   He told the business leaders that the fight against drugs in the
workplace represents more than merely a ``do-good'' project.
   ``It's smart business and it is, indeed, in many instances the
key to our economic survival,'' he said.
   ``To maintain our edge in an increasingly sophisticated
international economy, our workers have got to be literate and
well-trained and indeed drug free,'' the president said. ``And so
when I talk about competitiveness now, I talk about the workplace
being drug-free.''
   He said there were ``countless ways in which corporate America
can make a real difference in the communities in helping them be
drug-free.''
   ``There are counseling and treatment programs in the workplace
for drug-dependent workers,'' he said. ``Education programs show
employees how to avoid the temptation of drugs.''
   Bush described as ``outstanding'' the job that national drug
policy director William Bennett has done. He said the
administration has done its part in the campaign by strengthening
interdiction efforts, supporting law enforcement and expanding
treatment efforts.
   The president said, however, that the government alone will
never be able to win the war against drugs.
   ``It simply cannot be,'' he said. ``And so we have to enlist the
aid of every corporation.''

   Governors and Bush administration officials
disagree over the need for a national exam to keep track of
students' academic performance but favor giving schools a list of
what students should know in each subject.
   Colorado Gov. Roy Romer insisted Tuesday that assessment can be
used to promote true educational reform in the United States but
stopped short of endorsing the idea of national testing in America.
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. said states need to
know how their students compare with each other. But Missouri Gov.
John Ashcroft said state-by-state comparisons could be made without
``national uniform tests.''
   The governors led the discussions during the inaugural meeting
of a bipartisan panel created this summer to assess and report on
progress to achieve national goals to improve education.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos and White House domestic
policy chief Roger Porter were the administration's representatives
but top congressional leaders were absent because of budget battles
on Capitol Hill.
   The idea of national testing already is being discussed by the
President's Advisory Committee on Education Policy. But some
educators argue that education is a local and state responsibility
and a national test would destroy the tradition.
   ``Can we help ... each school building in America arrive at
better assessment? I think the answer is `yes,''' said Romer,
chairman of the Education Goals Panel. ``But we need to be cautious
and careful about how we do it.
   ``One of the initial steps we can help (with) is to say, `This
is what you need to know and this is what you need to be able to do
...' And then we can leave it to the school to design its own
curriculum,'' he said.
   Romer said experts generally agree, for instance, that there are
specific things students should know for various levels of
mathematics.
   Porter said the panel must search for ways to measure competency
without federal testing. He said an appropriate approach would be
to establish a national reporting system, while maintaining local
assessments that can allow state-by-state comparisons.
   Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh agreed with Porter on that approach.
   ``I would say it is not necessary to have a national uniform
test to demonstrate proficiency in certain skills,'' said
Missouri's Ashcroft. ``We do want to be able to assess our own
performance against the rest of the country, not necessarily
nationally uniform ....''
   Campbell insisted that states need to be able to compare
students' progress. He said comparisons would be difficult if there
are wide varieties of student assessments and tests.
   ``States need to know where they stand nationally, to compare
apples and apples, instead of apples and oranges,'' said the South
Carolina governor, who took part in developing the national goals.
   ``Our state is a struggling state, but if we struggle only
against ourselves, we're not going to go anywhere,'' Campbell said.
``I think I need to know what tests results are in Missouri ...
California ... and I need to know where our students compare.''

<TEXT>
   The National Gallery of Art is mounting a huge
show about the world of 1492, to mark the 500th anniversary of
Christopher Columbus' first voyage to America.
   ``It is the most complex and ambitious we have ever put on,''
gallery director J. Carter Brown said Tuesday of the exhibit, which
opens in a year.
   It embraces not only the Mediterranean countries Columbus knew
and the America that he opened to Europe, but also the Asia that he
always thought he had reached.
   Brown said 1492 marks the beginning of the modern era. The
voyages of Columbus came after the invention of printing and this
advance in communications made it certain that the news of the
discoveries would be widely and rapidly spread, he pointed out.
   ``Circa 1492: Art in the Age of Exploration'' will open on Oct.
12, 1991, Columbus Day, and continue Jan. 12, 1992. It will include
more than 400 paintings, sculptures, drawings, maps, screens,
scrolls, scientific instruments and other objects from the period
of his lifetime, borrowed from about 20 countries.
   The show will be sponsored by the Ameritech regional telephone
company, the Republic National Bank of New York and the Nomura
Securities Co., Ltd.-Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank, Ltd. of Japan.
   They are contributing $750,000 each, Brown said. He said the
total cost of the exhibit would be ``several million dollars.''
   Admission is expected to be free, as for other exhibits at the
gallery.
   The gallery is producing a 30-minute film, ``Beyond the
Vanishing Point,'' to go with the show. The title refers to the use
of perspective in European painting, a practice that became
widespread in the period covered by the show. The film is supported
by Canon, U.S.A., a subsidiary of the Japanese camera company.

<HEAD>Psychiatrist Testifies Surrogate-Baby Bond Paramount</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LYNN ELBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A surrogate mother established a
physical and emotional bond during pregnancy that entitles her to
custody of a baby that is genetically unrelated, a psychiatrist
testified.
   ``The natural mother is the woman who gives birth to the child,
and that includes whether or not the child is of her genetic
origins,'' Dr. Michelle Harrison said Tuesday at a custody hearing
over a 3-week-old boy.
   Ms. Harrison testified on behalf of Anna Johnson in Ms.
Johnson's dispute with the baby's genetic parents, Mark and
Crispina Calvert. The Superior Court hearing was to continue today.
   The Calverts had hired Ms. Johnson to carry their baby for
$10,000 and supplied the sperm and egg, but Ms. Johnson decided to
back out of the deal.
   The case may set precedent because the surrogate has no genetic
link to the baby. The landmark Baby M case in New Jersey involved a
surrogate who was also the genetic mother.
   Attorneys say the California case could result in a ruling on
what constitutes parenthood: the genetic link or the act of giving
birth.
   Ms. Johnson has said that she became attached to the baby and
that the Calverts neglected her and the pregnancy. The Calverts
have accused her of being motivated by money and publicity. They
have custody in the meantime.
   Psychologist David Chamberlain, vice president of the Prenatal
and Perinatal Psychology Association of America, also testified for
the surrogate. He said ``nothing could be closer than a baby in
utero and the birth mother.''
   But when asked by the Calverts' attorney, Christian Van Deusen,
whether the couple ``have a right to their own offspring,'' he
responded yes.
   Ms. Harrison, a teacher at the Univrsity of Pittsburgh and
consultant to the National Coalition Against Surrogacy, counseled
Johnson by telephone during her pregnancy.
   Ms. Harrison, questioned about Ms. Johnson's twice weekly visits
with the baby, said Ms. Johnson believes the boy recognizes her by
smell, feels safe with her and attempts to nurse.
   However, Ms. Harrison she could not judge either side's
attachment to the child because she has never seen either the
surrogate or the Calverts with the boy.
   Ms. Johnson, who worked with Mrs. Calvert at a Santa Ana
hospital, was hired by the couple to bear their child because a
hysterectomy prevents Mrs. Calvert from carrying a baby.

<HEAD>Japanese American Internees Get Apologies, $20,000 Checks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine Japanese Americans, including six age 100
and older, have received $20,000 checks at a ceremony kicking off a
three-year $1.25 billion program to compensate people imprisoned
during World War II because of their ancestry.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh knelt as he made the first
presentation Tuesday to Rev. Mamoru Eto, 107, the second-oldest
survivor of the internment camps. Eto, of Los Angeles, was seated
in a wheelchair.
   In a gesture that symbolized the nation's effort to apologize,
Thornburgh also dropped to his knees as he gave checks to five
other elderly men and women also seated in wheelchairs.
   ``By forcing us to reexamine our history, you have made us even
stronger and more proud,'' Thornburgh said. ``Your efforts have
strengthened this nation's Constitution by reaffirming the
inalienability of our civil rights.''
   The nine at Tuesday's ceremony also received a letter from
President Bush that said, in part: ``A monetary sum and words alone
cannot restore lost years or erase painful memories. ... But we can
take a clear stand for justice and recognize that serious
injustices were done to Japanese Americans during World War II.''
   An estimated 65,000 Japanese Americans are expected to receive
$20,000 checks over the next three years under an entitlement
program enacted by Congress.
   In 1988, Congress passed legislation apologizing for the
internment, stating that it was ``motivated largely by racial
prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political
leadership.''
   But it was not until this year that lawmakers appropriated money
to begin paying compensation, beginning with the oldest and ending
with the youngest survivors of the detention.
   Congress set aside $500 million for the 1991ffiscal year, $500
million for the 1992 fiscal year and an estimated $250 million for
the 1993 fiscal year.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Maxwell Thurman, commander of the U.S.
Southern Command and the field commander in charge of the 1989
invasion of Panama, is retiring.
   The Pentagon announced Tuesday that Thurman, 59, who was
diagnosed with leukemia last July, is undergoing chemotherapy
treatment at Johns Hopkins Oncology Center in Baltimore.
   The Pentagon said Lt. Gen. George A. Joulwan, 50, commanding
general of the 5th Corps, U.S. Army Europe and the Seventh Army,
has been nominated by President Bush to replace Thurman and to be
promoted to the rank of general.
   Thurman has been commander of the U.S. Southern Command, based
at Quarry Heights, Panama, since September 1989. He played a
central role in drafting the invasion plan for the December 1989
invasion.
   The four-star general had been scheduled to take mandatory
retirement in August 1989 but Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
insisted he take over the Southern Command to help with the
administration's struggle with Gen. Manuel Noriega's regime in
Panama.
   Cheney also announced Tuesday that Adm. Huntington Hardisty,
commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Command, is retiring after
38 years of active service. He is to be succeeded by Adm. Charles
Larson, commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.

<HEAD>Investigators Call Sexual Harassment Common at Naval Academy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sexual harassment of female students at the
Naval Academy is widespread, and some victims don't complain openly
for fear of reprisal, according to an internal academy report.
   ``In such a climate it is not surprising that some midshipmen
have lost the ability to distinguish a blatant incident of sexual
harassment from routine pranks,'' said the report released Tuesday.
   The report by a seven-member panel of academy faculty, military
staff and midshipmen said immediate action is needed to correct the
conditions allowing mistreatment of women.
   ``Most midshipmen readily acknowledge women midshipmen are not
accepted as equals in the (academy),'' said the report by the
academy's Women Midshipmen Study Group. ``This lack of acceptance
has created an environment in which steady, low-level sexual
harassment passes as normal operating procedure in many areas and
classrooms alike.''
   The report was one of several special inquiries prompted by a
hazing incident at the academy last December in which a female
student was handcuffed by male midshipmen to a urinal as other men
jeered and took photographs. The woman, Gwen M. Dreyer, a
second-year student, resigned from the academy last May, citing her
humiliation and anger at the way the academy responded to it.
   At the Pentagon, Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III said
``prompt action will be forthcoming'' to address the concerns
raised by the inquiry reports.

<HEAD>Group Says Public Health Insurance Far More Efficient Than Private</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Sector
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commercial health insurance companies spend 14
times as much on overhead as the federal Medicare program and 11
times as much as the Canadian national health care system,
according to a private group.
   If the private health insurance industry were as efficient as
Medicare, about $13 billion could be saved and used to provide
insurance to 11 million uninsured people, concluded the report
issued Tuesday by Citizen Action.
   ``Competition in the insurance market is wasteful and
expensive,'' said Robert Brandon, vice president of the group. ``In
health care, a free market cannot work. What we need is a
single-payer system, where the government is the sole insurer.''
   The Health Insurance Association of America said Citizen
Action's study was misleading because it did not include Blue Cross
and Blue Shield plans or plans sponsored by large, self-insured
companies.
   The association also said that private insurers are spending an
increasing amount of money to make sure doctors' and hospitals'
bills are appropriate.
   Citizen Action's report showed that in 1988 commercial health
insurance companies spent 33.5 cents on administration, marketing,
commissions and other overhead expenses for every dollar in claims
paid out.
   By comparison, Medicare's administrative costs were 2.3 cents
per dollar in claims paid out. In the Canadian health care system,
administrative costs amounted to about 3 cents per dollar in claims
paid, the group said.
   The industry association said that if Blue Cross and Blue Shield
and self-insured plans are factored in, the 1988 administrative
costs in the private sector drop to 13 cents for each dollar of
benefits paid.
   Private insurance companies, in their efforts to compete for
more business, spend money on things that are not necessary when
coverage is provided by a single public program, the group said.
   One of these functions is the internal review required to deny
claims.
   ``Incredibly, the commercial insurance way of paying for health
care leaves Americans spending more to deny people coverage than it
would cost to provide everyone with coverage,'' the report said.
   Citizen Action is a nonprofit, consumers rights group with
affiliates in 30 states.

<HEAD>Leonard Bernstein Giving Up Conducting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conductor Leonard Bernstein, the ``West Side
Story'' composer who mesmerized audiences with his passion and
physical flair at the podium, is giving up the baton because of
poor health.
   The 72-year-old maestro suffers from a lung tumor, emphysema and
pulmonary infections and has been told by his doctor to stop
conducting and performing on the piano, his spokeswoman said
Tuesday.
   ``Leonard Bernstein will henceforth devote his professional
energies to composing, writing and education,'' said Margaret
Carson.
   He last conducted Aug. 19 at the Tanglewood Music Center in
western Massachusetts.
   Bernstein's announcement was met with dismay in the music world,
especially at the New York Philharmonic, which he directed from
1958 to 1969. ``I receive this unfortunate news in utter shock,''
said Zubin Mehta, music director.
   Albert K. Webster, managing director of the Philharmonic, said:
``Leonard Bernstein has BEEN the New York Philharmonic for more
than 45 years. We all will be less for the loss of his magic
baton.''
   Bernstein still hopes to participate in an AIDS benefit at
Carnegie Hall on Oct. 28 but canceled all appearances with
orchestras in New York, Israel, Vienna and London and with festival
orchestras at Tanglewood, Germany and Japan.
   Bernstein, known for his vigorous style at the podium, once led
an orchestra performance at a liberated concentration camp. Last
Christmas, he celebrated the tumbling of the Berlin Wall by
conducting Beethoven's ``Ninth Symphony.''
   In May, he canceled plans to conduct opening night of the
Spoleto Festival in Charleston, S.C., citing ``a near brush with
pneumonia.''
   Carson said Bernstein has had increased difficulty breathing in
past weeks. Dr. Kevin M. Cahill attributed the problem to emphysema
complicated by a tumor and pulmonary infections. Bernstein was once
a heavy smoker.
   Bernstein is not hospitalized. Carson said the conductor was
told that rest offers the best hope for returning to limited
activities.
   She said Bernstein plans to continue work on a new chamber music
piece to be performed next spring, a new musical theater work he
hopes to finish by summer and several educational, film and
recording projects, as well as his memoirs.
   Bernstein was the wunderkind of American music at a time when
all respected conductors in the United States were born and trained
in Europe.
   His first published composition was ``The Clarinet Sonata'' in
1942. He conducted his first symphony, the ``Jeremiah,'' with the
Pittsburgh Symphony in 1944. That year his ballet, ``Fancy Free,''
choreographed by Jerome Robbins, opened and became the basis for
the Broadway musical ``On the Town.''
   After Boston Symphony Orchestra conductor Serge Koussevitzky
died in 1951, Bernstein became head of the orchestra and conducting
departments at Tanglewood. His first opera, ``Trouble in Tahiti,''
was performed in 1952. He composed ``Candide'' in 1956 and ``West
Side Story'' in 1957.
   In 1969, he retired from the post to concentrate on composing
and was appointed the Philharmonic's laureate conductor for life.
He has conducted 1,244 New York Philharmonic concerts, more than
any other conductor.

   The defense in the 2 Live Crew
obscenity trial contends there aren't enough blacks and young
people among the prospective jurors.
   Three of the first 25 potential jurors questioned Monday and
Tuesday were black and one was under 25, said Bruce Rogow, attorney
for the three members of the black rap group arrested for
performing songs from an album pronounced obscene.
   Jury selection was to continue today.
   ``You don't have to be a genius to look at this jury pool and
see that's not what Broward County looks like,'' Rogow said.
   The makeup of the jury is particularly important because
obscenity cases depend on how the jury defines community standards.
In addition, rap music is aimed primarily at a black audience, and
the rap group and its defenders have claimed the case smacks of
racism.
   Rogow challenged Broward County's voter-based jury pool as
unconstitutional in cases like obscenity that depend on community
standards. Judge June Johnson said she wanted to see the whole
70-person pool before ruling on the challenge.
   Meanwhile, prosecutors Tuesday lost a bid to have the judge
removed from the case on grounds that Rogow was her law professor
at Nova University 15 years ago. Johnson refused to step down,
saying she had lost touch with Rogow since then.
   Luther Campbell, Chris Wongwon and Mark Ross were charged after
they performed songs from ``As Nasty as They Wanna Be'' on June 11
at an adults-only show at a Hollywood club. Days before, a federal
judge ruled the album obscene.
   If convicted, the Miami-based rappers could get up to a year in
jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Rogow also represented Charles Freeman, a black record store
owner convicted of obscenity last week by an all-white jury for
selling ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be.''
   Most obscenity cases are argued on the U.S. Supreme Court's
Miller v. California test. It holds that material is obscene if the
average person, applying local community standards, would find that
it is designed to cause sexual arousal, depicts sex in a patently
offensive way, and if, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary,
artistic, political or scientific value.
   ``I need young people and black people,'' Campbell said of the
jury pool.

   Arthur Schwartz, a racket-busting federal
prosecutor who won a bootlegging conviction against Jack ``Legs''
Diamond, has died at age 86.
   Schwartz died Monday of congestive heart failure at a community
hospital in Dobbs Ferry where he lived.
   As an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan, he captured public

he won the conviction of Diamond on charges of conspiracy and
violation of the Prohibition law.
   In 1944, Schwartz was the New York manager of Thomas Dewey's
presidential campaign. He also was a counsel to the Republican
State Committee and from 1974 to 1976 was chairman of the state
Board of Elections.
   In 1952, he served as a state Supreme Court justice.
   Schwartz practiced law until his retirement six years ago.
   A New York native, he attended Columbia College and graduated
from its law school at the top of his class in 1926.
   He is survived by his second wife, Betty; two daughters, and
three grandchildren.

<HEAD>Pakistan Tried to Buy Furnaces Similar to Those Iraq Wanted</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Subs last grafs with 2 comments</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pakistan tried three times this year to buy
from a New Jersey company high-temperature furnaces useful for
making nuclear weapons, a congressional source said Wednesday
night.
   This source confirmed an account in Wednesday editions of The
Washington Post, which said it had obtained documents of an
unspecified nature given to administration officials and
congressional investigators describing Pakistan's attempt to buy
the furnaces from Consarc Corp. of Rancocas, N.J.
   The confirming source had not read the documents, but they had
been described to him. He spoke on condition that his name not be
used.
   The newspaper's account said the furnaces were more
sophisticated versions of Consarc furnaces whose export to Iraq was
approved over the summer. The Iraqi shipment was stopped at the
last minute.
   According to the newspaper, Pakistan tried through its embassy
in France, and through intermediaries in France and Switzerland, to
buy the Consarc furnaces, either directly or through Consarc's
British subsidiary.
   The inability to obtain export licenses from U.S. or British
authorities was said to have prevented the sale.
   In the Canadian approach, the manufacture of surgical
instruments was given as the intended use of the furnaces.
   A Consarc salesman, Manfred Dickersbach, was quoted as saying in
one document that the material to be processed ``appears to be
zirconium.''
   Zirconium is used to clad uranium fuel in nuclear reactors. Fuel
for power reactors comes from suppliers already clad.
   Irradiated with neutrons in the reactor, the uranium would be
transformed into plutonium, from which nuclear weapons may be made
more easily than with uranium.
   Pakistan is believed to have taken steps to make a uranium bomb
also.
   Pakistan has steadfastly denied making nuclear weapons. Congress
has required that the Bush administration certify that Pakistan
does not possess a nuclear weapon before Pakistan may receive U.S.
aid.
   The administration has approached Congressional leaders on the
issue about the possibility of waiving the requirement this fiscal
year, which began Oct. 1. Congress is reluctant, and officially,
the State Department says no decision has been made on what to do.
   In Islamabad, a foreign ministry spokesman said reports that
Pakistan was trying to buy high-temperature furnaces came as a
surprise and questioned their veracity.
   ``These kinds of stories always come out when we have problems
with certification. It's uncanny . . . (and) they are later
disproved,'' said a spokesman who could not be identified under
usual briefing rules.
   ``There is no reason why there shouldn't be certification this
year,'' said the foreign office spokesman.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. Air Force F-111
fighter-bomber crashed today in Saudi Arabia, killing both crew
members, U.S. military officials reported.
   It was the fourth American aircraft to crash in three days among
those deployed to this kingdom for Operation Desert Shield.
   Eight Marines are missing in the crash of two helicopters in the
northern Arabian Sea on Monday. An Air Force F-4 reconnaissance jet
also went down that day, killing both crew members.
   Lt. Cmdr. J.D. van Sickle, a military spokesman, said the F-111
crashed in the ``southern Arabian peninsula'' while on a training
mission and that the incident was under investigation.
   The names of the flyers were withheld pending notification of
next of kin.
   The aircraft was attached the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing based
at RAF Lakenheath Air Base in Britain. The wing was sent to Turkey
as U.S. forces massed in the region in response to Iraq's Aug. 2
takeover of Kuwait.
   Today's crash brought to at least nine the number of Americans
killed in the Persian Gulf region since Operation Desert Shield
began.
   The eight Marines aboard the two UH-1 Huey helicopters that
vanished Monday are still officially listed as missing.
   In addition to those killed in Saudi Arabia, 13 other Air Force
personnel were killed in a crash of a C-5 jet cargo plane in
Germany. That aircraft was ferrying supplies and equipment to the
Saudi peninsula.
   Officials said the F-111 crashed at dawn.
   The aircraft was an F-model, the latest version of the
23-year-old swing-wing jet that first saw action in Vietnam.
   The F-model has more powerful engines, and state-of-the-art
equipment to operate against enemy targets at night. The plane can
carry up to 12 tons of bombs and missiles and has a crew of two, a
pilot and a weapons systems officer.

   About 400 Americans and foreign-born family
members have signed up for another U.S. government-chartered
evacuation flight from Iraq.
   The State Department said Tuesday the flight is scheduled to
depart today and arrive in Raleigh-Durham airport in North Carolina
on Thursday after an overnight stop in London. Most of the
passengers are in Kuwait and will be transported to the airport in
the Iraqi city of Basra for the flight.
   The flight is the first of its kind since Sept. 22. As before,
the Americans on board will be limited to women and children and
Americans of Arab ancestry. Previous evacuation flights have
transported about 1,900 Americans out of Iraq and Kuwait.
   The most recent State Department estimates indicate there are
more than 900 Americans stranded in Kuwait and more than 300 in
Iraq.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said three more
American men have been detained by Iraqi authorities, bringing the
total to 104. Americans still not in detention are subject to
house-to-house searches.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the Iraqis have not provided U.S. officials
with a list of the Americans that they have detained.
   They also have refused to evacuate any of 69 Americans in need
of medical attention, she said.

   Visitors once again could touch the Liberty
Bell and visit Valley Forge as they trickled back to historic sites
around the country that had been shut down by the congressional
impasse over the budget.
   Park ranger Jim Van Dorin led visitors Tuesday on one of the
first tours of Independence Hall since it was locked up. Back on
display were George Washington's chair and the silver inkstand used
by signers of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
   ``That's what gives us the Congress we have today,'' he said of
the Constitution. ``I won't go any farther than that.''
   The three-day impasse had locked doors at Independence Hall and
other National Park Service sites across the country.
   David Head of Florence, Ky., said he blamed Congress for not
passing budget legislation soon enough to avoid a shutdown. Asked
if anyone had won his vote during the budget wrangling, he said,
``Yes, anyone new.''
   The government lost its authority to spend money Saturday after
Congress rejected a White House spending plan for the fiscal year
that began Oct. 1. Non-essential services were halted during the
three-day Columbus Day weekend, hitting tourist sites the hardest.
   The emergency spending bill that President Bush signed Tuesday
failed to convince many people the problem had been solved. The
bill is effective until Oct. 19. By then, congressional leaders
hope to work out a deficit-reducing budget.
   ``I think we're all pleased to be still employed this morning,
but we've only got a 10-day reprieve,'' said Richard G. Ring,
superintendent of Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area near
Stroudsburg. ``We're hoping that things sort themselves out on a
permanent basis for the coming fiscal year.''
   ``It's not the best way to run a park,'' Warren Beach,
superintendent of Valley Forge National Historical Park in suburban
Philadelphia, said of the temporary bill.
   People had also been turned away from the Gettysburg
battlefield.
   ``It's just a shame that lots of our visiting people, both from
this country and as well from other countries, were really denied
the opportunity to see some of our heritage,'' said James C. Roach,
the battlefield's chief of interpretation and visitor services.
   In St. Louis, children on a field trip to the St. Louis Arch got
to see what they came for.
   `If it hadn't been open, the students were going to write
President Bush and Congress telling them how it affected their
education,'' said Nancy Scargall, a teacher at Wren Hollow School
in St. Louis County.

<HEAD>Company: Pakistan Sought Furnaces Useful in Making Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. company says it refused to sell
Pakistan high-temperature furnaces that can be used in making
nuclear weapons because it was suspicious of the country's
intentions.
   Raymond Robrts, president of Consarc Corp. of Rancocas, said
Wednesday the company was approached at least twice by Pakistan.
   ``The end use that they wished was to produce zirconium, and
that's a metal that has principally nuclear end-uses,'' Roberts
said in a telephone interview from his home. ``We know that the
U.S. government has concerns with Pakistan and nuclear weapons, so
we elected not to pursue a potential sale.''
   Among other things, the furnaces can also be used to make
surgical steel.
   A government-approved sale of less-sophisticated Consarc
furnaces to Iraq this summer was stopped at the last minute.
   Pakistan approached Consarc and its British subsidiary early
this year with a request to buy the arc melting furnaces, which
cost about $3 million each, Roberts said.
   About the same time, a Canadian company made a similar request,
leading Consarc to believe that Pakistan was behind that request as
well, he said.
   In Pakistan, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, who could not be
identified under the briefing rules, said: ``These kinds of stories
always come out when we have problems with certification. It's
uncanny . . . (and) they are later disproved.''
   Before it grants more aid to Pakistan, the third-largest
recipient of U.S. aid, Congress wants the Bush administration to
certify that the country does not possess a nuclear weapon.
   The alleged attempts to purchase the furnaces were first
reported in today's Washington Post, which said it had obtained
documents describing the incident.
   According to the newspaper, Pakistan tried through its embassy
in France, and through intermediaries in France and Switzerland, to
buy furnaces.
   A Consarc salesman, Manfred Dickersbach, was quoted in one of

uranium fuel for nuclear reactors.
   Uranium can be transformed in a reactor into plutonium, from
which nuclear weapons may be made more readily than with uranium.
   Pakistan is also believed to have taken steps to make a uranium
bomb, the newspaper said.

<DATELINE>DURBAN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen opened fire with automatic
weapons on a bus, killing six blacks and wounding 27 in the second
random attack around this Indian Ocean city in less than 24 hours,
police said today.
   Police spokesman Lt. Bala Naidoo said the public bus was
traveling just outside Durban late Tuesday when it was attacked by
unidentired gunmen. Police said they had no motive for the attack
and no one had been arrested.
   Earlier Tuesday, a group of about 20 knife-wielding blacks
stabbed eight whites when they went on a rampage on a street near
the beachfront.
   Seven suspects were arrested, including the alleged leader, who
was shot by police. Authorities said the 26-year-old leader
appeared to be a religious zealot who had recruited his followers
hours earlier at an all-night vigil on the Durban beach.
   He told the others that 1990 would be the year blacks obtained
freedom in South Africa, police added.
   The gang stole knives from a store speacializing in weapons from
the Far East and then began stabbing people along a street near the
beach, police and witnesses said.
   ``We have come to take over this place,'' the alleged leader was
quoted as saying by witnesses.
   Some in the gang wore badges of the Pan Africanist Congress, a
militant black opposition group, but the attack was not believed to
be politically motivated, police said.
   Eight whites, ranging in age from 15 to 85, were hospitalized
with stab wounds, Barkhuizen said.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok condemned the violence and
called for private citizens to refrain from seeking vengeance.
   Thabo Mbeki, a top official for the African National Congress,
said the attack might have been orchestrated by ``somebody trying
to provoke a reaction from the white population.''
   Despite deep racial divisions and widespread violence in South
Africa, there have been few cases of blacks randomly attacking
whites.
   Some 5,000 blacks have been killed in factionalfighting since
1986 in Natal Province, which includes Durban. But the violence has
been almost exclusively in black areas, pitting Zulu supporters of
the conservative Inkatha movement against Xhosas and other blacks
linked to the ANC.

<HEAD>Cardin Retrospective At Victoria And Albert</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pierre Cardin, who invented bubble dresses and
revolutionized Paris with the first ready-to-wear collection, is
the first of his contemporaries to have a retrospective at the
Victoria and Albert Museum.
   The 68-year-old fashion pioneer returned briefly to the past
Tuesday when selections from his 40-year career went on display at
the museum, known in part for its extensive clothing collections of
various periods.
   It was ``very emotional,'' he said, to see nearly 100 models
dressed in bubble and balloon dresses of the 50s, unisex space-age
styles and vinyl minis of the 60s, pagoda-sleeve jackets and
asymmetrical skirts of the 70s, and hooped evening mini-dresses and
computer-inspired coats of the 80s.
   But while Cardin was the first of his contemporaries to be so
honored at the museum, his mind was very much on the future. He
says he wants to expand his empire from 102 countries to the entire
world.
   ``I have very big ambition. ... I don't stop. ... I'd like to
prove myself again,'' Cardin said. ``Today my ambition is to work
very hard with China, with Russia, with Indonesia and Malaysia.
Today, we are looking at ... Vietnam and North Korea.''
   Born in Venice and reared in France, Cardin worked with renowned
Parisian designers Paquin and Schiaparelli after World War II and
then joined Christian Dior in 1947, just after he started his own
company. The retrospective includes a suit he said he made as part
of Dior's ``New Look.''
   In 1950, Cardin started his own house, showing his first
collection in 1953 and establishing himself as an important figure
in French haute couture.
   ``My first show, I sold 300,000 of one red coat,'' he recalled.
``It was the beginning of my career.''
   But his big breakthrough came in 1959, when he presented a
ready-to-wear collection for women and was swiftly expelled by the
Chambre Syndicale de la Couture, the select couturiers' club.
   ``I was looking at ready-to-wear; `why,' I said, `can only the
rich people dress with haute couture?', '' Cardin recalled. ``It
was the beginning of my fortune in this moment, because my house
was the first to offer ready-to-wear and in Germany, in Japan,
France and America it was immediately successful.''
   After that, Cardin branched out into licensing. Currently, he
said, 800 factories employ more than 180,000 people producing
Cardin brand name goods ranging from perfume and chocolates to
frying pans and shoes.
   ``Put end to end, the ties I sell every year would go round the
globe twice over,'' he was quoted as telling The Observer
newspaper.
   In 1970, he said he bought a theater in Paris ``because when I
was young I wanted to be an actor or dancer.'' In 1981, he bought
the famous Paris restaurant Maxim's so he could see beautiful men
and women dining there in designer clothes. After that, it was
hotels.
   Estimates of retail revenue from Cardin-stamped products range
between $1.2 billion and $2 billion annually. Cardin's personal
income is estimated at between $20 million and $50 million a year
and Forbes magazine calls him the richest designer in the world.
   ``I love money,'' he was quoted as saying in the Telegraph
Weekend Magazine. ``I do not believe there has ever been a name as
important as Pierre Cardin in the general history of couture.''
   Cardin said he saw fashion partly as designs to be worn today,
partly as creations for the future.
   ``The body is liquid material and I put it in a dress. The body
is like a vase and I put the water in it,'' he said, describing his
fashion philosophy. ``Other designers follow the body. For me the
body doesn't exist. It's the shape that counts.''
   The retrospective runs until Jan. 6.

<HEAD>Biden's GOP Challenger Dusts Off Plagiarism Controversy in
Videotapes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Joseph Biden's Republican
challenger is dusting off videotape on a plagiarism controversy
that wrecked Biden's Democratic run for president in 1988.
   Prosecutor M. Jane Brady, who trails badly, said she is playing
the ``character card'' with a 10-minute videotape to be mailed next
week to about 40,000 homes.
   The videotape, including material used against Biden two years
ago, shows Biden using lines from the late Robert Kennedy and
British Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock.
   Biden quit the 1988 presidential race after it was revealed that
he borrowed from Kinnock and others without attribution, lifted
from a law review article for a legal brief while in law school and
inflated his standing in his law school class.
   John Sasso, an aide to Democrat Michael Dukakis during the 1988
presidential campaign, resigned after admitting he leaked a
videotape on Biden's Kinnock-like remarks.
   Biden's campaign staff said Brady broke her word to avoid
negative campaigning with use of the videotape, put together by the
National Republican Senate Campaign.
   ``I don't believe that voters who see this again will be
concerned because the record has been set straight that I
repeatedly quoted Kinnock previously and never intended to
appropriate his words without attribution,'' Biden said.
   The videotape also shows an exchange Biden had with a man at a
political function over Biden's claim about his law school class
standing.
   The video, which cost Brady's campaign $75,000, uses material
from network television and the public affairs TV channel C-SPAN.

   Former Mayor Jane Byrne says she will attempt a

   ``We are absolutely having no difficulty getting signatures,''
she said Tuesday.
   Byrne was elected mayor in 1979 and lost a re-election bid in
the 1983 Democratic primary to Harold Washington, who went on to
become the city's first black mayor. She lost a comeback bid to
Washington in the 1987 primary.
   Mayor Richard M. Daley, elected in 1989 after Washington died in

<HEAD>U.S. City Rejects Japanese Visit After Race Remarks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of Trenton, N.J., has rejected a visit by
a Japanese group studying garbage disposal methods because of a
Cabinet minister's remarks comparing blacks with prostitutes,
Japanese news reports said today.
   The Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly had asked Trenton to accept the
visit in late October, but Mayor Douglas Palmer refused because of
the remarks last month by Justice Minister Seiroku Kajiyama, Kyodo
News Service reported.
   ``For the city of Trenton, with a large black population and a
black mayor, Kajiyama's remarks were unbearable,'' Kyodo quoted
Palmer as saying in a letter. Palmer said the visit should wait
until anger in Trenton has eased, the news agency added.
   Officials of the Metropolitan Assembly were not available for
comment because of a national holiday in Japan.
   On Sept. 21, following a police roundup of foreign prostitutes
in Tokyo, Kajiyama said such prostitutes ``ruin the atmosphere'' of
neighborhoods they move into.
   ``It's like in America when neighborhoods become mixed because
blacks move in and whites are forced out,'' he said.
   The remarks provoked protests in the United States and Japan.
Kajiyama later apologized and retracted them.
   Otherremarks by Japanese politicians in recent years also have
angered American minorities.
   In 1986, then Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said, ``On the
average, the United States is lower (in intellectual level) because
of a considerable number of blacks, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans.''
   In 1988, Michio Watanabe, policy chief of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, said American blacks have few qualms about going
bankrupt and implied they walk away from their debts.
   The team from the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly planned to set out
next Monday for a two-week study on environment and housing.

<HEAD>70 Dead In Storm, 5,000 Fishermen Missing in Bay of Bengal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm that has claimed the lives of
more than 70 fishermen and left about 5,000 missing in the Bay of
Bengal continued to lash the Bangladesh coast today, newspapers
reported.
   The Bengali-language daily Sangram said 350 boats and trawlers
had failed to return to port since the storm hit on Monday.
   Sangram quoted the president of a fishermen's association, Kabir
Ahmed Sowdagar, as saying he saw 50 to 60 bodies floating in the
bay 60 mile offshore on Tuesday.
   The newspaper Dainik Bangla said at least 70 fishermen were
killed.
   Sowdagar said more than 100 fishermen were rescued by boats
carrying relief goods to the affected areas, but he feared the
death toll would rise.
   A senior official at the seaside resort of Cox's Bazar 190 miles
southeast of Dhaka, said organized search operations were being
delayed by the weather.
   The official, speaking by telephone on condition of anonomity,
said hundreds of fishermen were already out in the sea looking for
their kinsmen.
   He said speed boats and small launches were ready to start the
search as soon as the weather eased.
   The incessant rains have caused flash floods in most parts of
this low-lying country, rendering tens of thousands of people
homeless, the English-language Morning Sun reported.
   The paper, quoting reports from the southern port city of
Chittagong, said a tornado whipped up tidal surges, causing
extensive damaged on the Sandwip and Urirchar islands.
   Some areas of Sandwip, 10 miles northwest of Chittagong, have
gone under 7 to 8 feet of water and the island's protective
embankment has been heavily damaged. Communications with the
islands have been disrupted, and they have been cut off from the
mainland for three days, the paper said.

   Art historians are split over a doctor's theory
that Michelangelo's ``Creation of Adam'' on the Sistine Chapel
ceiling contains a huge image of a brain, symbolizing God endowing
man with intelligence.
   Dr. Frank Lynn Meshberger contends the fresco has been
misunderstood since it was created in 1512. The painting was
covered with dirt until a recent restoration, ``so it might have
been difficult to visualize a brain,'' he said.
   The painting shows Adam and God reaching toward one another,
arms outstretched, fingers almost touching. God has his arm around
Eve, and angels lookon. God and the angels form the shape of the
brain, Meshberger said.
   Meshberger, a gynecologist at St. John's Medical Center in
Anderson, Ind., said in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association that Michelangelo intended to symbolize God giving man
intellect, rather than life, as commonly believed.
   Kathleen Weil-Garris Brandt, a fine arts professor at New York
University and a consultant for Renaissance art at the Vatican
Museum, disputed Meshberger's theory as a ``retrofit'' of his own
knowledge.
   ``All the elements in the image have profound traditional roots
in the visual culture of the Renaissance and Middle Ages,'' she
said. ``God is more than a flying brain.''
   Other art historians are reluctant to dismiss the theory, noting
that artists and scientists of the time studied sections of the
brain.
   Meshberger said he learned through his research that
Michelangelo had deep religious beliefs and dissected cadavers to
study the human form for his art.
   ``The idea of God being equated with the mind is quite
attractive,'' said Graham Smith, who specializes in 16th-century
art at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
   Lynn Orr, curator of European art at the Fine Arts Museums of
San Francisco, said, ``Anybody can look at artwork and say, `Oh,
that means such and such to me,' but that's one of the wonderful
things about art.''
   ``I guess the thing to do now is for a bunch of people to look
at the picture carefully to see if it really does look like a
brain,'' she said.
   Meshberger said the theory came to him after he dissected and
drew a brain in medical school in 1969. He said he saw a three-page
fold-out photograph of the painting in a magazine and ``had a
tremendous sense of deja vu.''
   ``I like to think of it as a brainstorm,'' he joked.
   Meshberger said he waited 20 years to publish an article on it
because he was establishing himself as a doctor and had little time
to research Michelangelo.
   Meshberger said that the painting also includes a representation
of the vertebral artery, which feeds blood to the brain, and that a
cleft-footed angel forms the two lobes of the pituitary gland.
   For centuries after the fresco was created, art lovers did not
have the benefit of clear photography, and artists who would have
had access to the painting generally were not skilled in the study
of anatomy, the doctor said.
   ``For someone to make this observation, you would have had to
travel to Rome to the Sistine Chapel, stand on the floor and look
up at a ceiling about 65 feet away,'' he said.

<HEAD>Newsletter Says Britons To Be Released By Next Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anglican church envoy Terry Waite and
other Britons held hostage in Lebanon will be released ``before the
end of next week,'' a Lebanese newsletter said today.
   ``The final arrangements for the release of the British hostages
held in Lebanon topped by Anglican church envoy Terry Waite are
under way behind the scene,'' Akhbar al-Yom (Today's News) said.
   The missing Britons are ``expected to be released before the end
of next week,'' said the report, attributed to unidentified sources
informed about the foreign hostage issue. It did not disclose
further details.
   The privately owned newsletter is close to the Higher Shiite
Islamic Council, the highest Shiite Moslem religious authority in
Lebanon.
   The newsletter seldom reports on the foreign hostages, but has
been fairly accurate when it does.
   Most of the 13 Westerners missing in Lebanon - including six
Americans - are believed held by Shiite fundamentalists affiliated
with the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   It was the latest in a flurry of reports predicting the release
soon of British captives now that Iran and Britain agreed to
restore diplomatic relations last month after an interruption of 18
months.
   Waite, 51, disappeared in Moslem west Beirut after leaving his
hotel for a meeting with representatives of hostage-holders on Jan.
20, 1987.
   No group has claimed responsibility for his abduction, but
former Irish hostage Brian Keenan, freed in August, said he was
held with Waite in the same house for awhile.
   In addition to Waite, the missing Britons are journalist John
McCarthy, World War II flier Jack Mann and writer Alec Collett.
   McCarthy, 33, of Barnet, North London, was kidnapped April 17,
1986, while driving to Beirut airport to catch a flight to London.
   Mann, 76, was kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut May 12, 1989.
   Collett, a New York-based writer on assignment in Lebanon for
the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, was kidnapped March 25, 1985.
   A group calling itself the Revolutionary Organization of
Socialist Moslems, believed linked to Palestinian terrorist
mastermind Abu Nidal, claimed in April 1986 that it hanged Collett
in retaliation for British support for U.S. air raids on Libya
earlier that month.
   A videotape released by the group purportedly showed Collet's
body dangling from a scaffold. No body has been produced but
British officials believe Collett is dead.
   American journalist Terry Anderson, 42, of Lorain, Ohio, is the
longest-held foreign captive in Lebanon. Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, was kidnapped in west
Beirut on March 16, 1985.

   Students wielding clubs and firebombs
fought with riot police today, who responded with tear gas and
stormed two universities to block the screening of banned movies
from communist North Korea.
   Police beefed up security around intelligence offices after
radicals firebombed an intelligence office in the southern city of
Chonju early today. No serious damage or injuries were reported.
   Police arrested about 50 dissidents who tried to march toward
the police command's headquarters near President Roh Tae-woo's
residence to demand that military intelligence be overhauled to end
its political operations.
   Anti-government protests intensified after last week's reports
of illegal spying on civilians by the Defense Security Command, a
military intelligence unit.
   As part of their anti-government tactics, radical students tried
to screen North Korean movies, which encourage revolution, before
police moved in to stop the efforts.
   In downtown Seoul, about 2,000 riot police were deployed around
a Catholic cathedral to block an evening rally by dissidents.
   Meanwhile, opposition leader Kim Dae-jung's hunger strike
continued for a third day at his party headquarters. He was backed
up by about 400 supporters who were staging sit-ins in 20 local
offices.
   Kim began fasting Monday to demand dissolution of the security
command, economic reform and the scrapping of government plans to
change the form of government from presidential to parliamentary.
   The latest political turmoil began last week after an army
private released classified documents he said showed the military
intelligence unit illegally spied on more than 1,300 dissidents,
intellectuals and opposition legislators.
   Roh fired his defense minister and the chief of military
intelligence Monday, seeking to minimize the impact of the most
serious scandal since he took office in early 1988.
   But opponents joined forces to mount a major campaign against
Roh, a former general who once headed the security command after
helping former president Chun Doo-hwan seize power in 1980.
   Roh has vowed to end military intervention in politics. His
party gained control of two-thirds of the 299-member National
Assembly in January by merging with two minor opposition groups.
   Roh's opponents contend the merger is a government attempt to
prolong power. All opposition legislators resigned from Parliament
en masse in August, accusing the government of railroading
legislation through the assembly and curtailing democratic reforms.

<TEXT>
   Discussions of higher taxes on the wealthy in
exchange for lower taxes on capital gains have focused on an oddity
in the law, the so-called ``bubble'' that finds the rate on the top
tax bracket lower than in the bracket immediately before it.
   That means the wealthiest people pay a lower rate on extra
dollars of income than do some earning slightly less.
   Thus, a person with $1 million income can win a $10,000 lottery
and owe the government an additional $2,800 - a 28 percent tax
rate. But a person with $50,000 income can hit the same lottery and
owe $3,300.
   Currently, single taxpayers face a tax rate of 15 percent on the
first $19,450 of taxable income. A 28 percent rate applies to the
next segment of inome, between $19,450 and $47,050. Income between
$47,050 and $97,620 is taxed at 33 percent.
   Any taxable income above $97,620 is taxed at 28 percent. But
before that lower rate kicks in, a taxpayer will have lost any
benefit from a personal exemption and from having some income taxed
at the lowest, 15 percent, rate.
   Similarly, for married taxpayers with no children and filing
joint returns, the first $32,450 is taxed at 15 percent; income
between $32,450 and $78,400 is taxed at 28 percent; taxable income
between $78,400 and $162,770 faces a 33 percent rate.
   Any income above $162,770 is taxed at 33 percent.
   The ``bubble'' is not an accident. Congress invented it in 1986
in an effort to prevent any person from paying more than 28 percent
of taxable income to the government.
   Even so, some people can pay more than 29 percent.

<TEXT>
   The last men-only dining club at
Princeton University has voted to stay that way despite a state
Supreme Court order requiring it to admit female members.
   The vote Tuesday by undergraduate members of the Tiger Inn also
reverses the club's decision earlier this year to admit women and
end a 100-year-old tradition.
   ``We all believe the right to freedom of association is an
important and fundamental aspect of life at any age,'' said
Stockton S. Williams, undergraduate president of the Tiger Inn.
   In February, the Tiger Inn voted to admit women. However, club
rules say women can be admitted only if undergraduate members vote
them in for two consecutive school years.
   The club said the earlier vote ``was taken under severe pressure
with pickets, bonfires, rallies, and other interferences.''
   The pressure to admit women began 11 years ago when former
Princeton University student Sally Frank sued the all-male Ivy Club
as well as the Tiger Inn.
   In July the state Supreme Court ordered both clubs to admit
women.
   The Ivy Club admitted 15 women two weeks ago after a membership
drive.
   Tiger Inn attorney Russell H. Beatie Jr. says the club cannot be
forced to obey the court order because it held no membership drive
this fall. Beatie said the club intends to hold a spring membership
drive and will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to put the state order on
hold if the high court decides to hear the case.
   Ms. Frank, now a law professor at Drake University in Des
Moines, Iowa, said the club ``is fighting tooth and nail to
maintain a system of exclusion and discrimination that harms its
members and the entire Princeton community.''

<HEAD>TV Documentary Says British Soldiers Trained Khmer Rouge
Guerrillas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A television documentary claims British soldiers
have been training Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrillas, and
opposition legislators said they will press for a government
explanation.
   The Foreign Office denied allegations by the documentary
broadcast Tuesday that commandos of the Army's elite Special Air
Service regiment were involved in helping the Communist group. ``We
have never given and will never give aid of any sort to the Khmer
Rouge,'' it said in a statement.
   The TV program's director says the assistance began in 1985, and
he claims that Britain helped the guerrillas at the request of the
United States.
   George Foulkes, foreign affairs spokesman for the opposition
Labor Party, said the film demonstrated that ``the Foreign Office
statement is incorrect. The television evidence seemed
well-documented.''
   Hundreds of thousands of people died from starvation, execution
and disease during the Khmer Rouge's rule in Cambodia from 1975
until Vietnam invaded in late 1978. A civil war involving the
guerrillas continues today.
   The Khmer Rouge is now the largest and strongest organization in
a three-faction guerrilla coalition opposed to the
Vietnamese-installed government of Prime Minister Hun Sen. The
other two groups are non-Communist.
   The Foreign Office said in July that Britain shared U.S.
determination to prevent the Khmer Rouge from taking power.
   The hourlong TV program, ``Viewpoint 90: Cambodia, the
Betrayal,'' was made for Central Television by journalist John
Pilger and shown on the Independent Television network. It alleged
that Special Air Service men trained Khmer Rouge guerrillas in
Malaysia and Thailand. It said Britain's MI6 espionage agency was
heavily involved in the covert operation.
   The director of the program, David Monroe, said in a radio
interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. on Tuesday:
   ``Since 1985 in various forms the British government has
supplied military training directly to the Khmer Rouge in guerrilla
warfare, basic mines technology and mine-laying techniques.
   ``From 1985 until about November of last year there were serving
SAS officers who were training directly the Khmer Rouge.''
   Asked in the BBC interview why Britain would want to train the
Khmer Rouge, Monroe claimed the United States was trying to get
others to ``do the dirty work for them.'' He said Britain undertook
the task to repay U.S. favors during the 1982 Falklands War.
   He added: ``The idea is to get in place in Phnom Penh a
government that is anti-Vietnamese. However, I don't think anybody
actually wants to see the Khmer Rouge take power.''

<TEXT>
   The government released 21
political prisoners today as part of a pledge to free all activists
convicted of anti-apartheid acts.
   Eighteen men were released in Cape Town and three were freed
from prisons in Johannesburg and Pretoria, the Prisons Service
said.
   Most of those released belong to the African National Congress,
the largest black opposition movement. They had two to five years
remaining on sentences that included convictions for terrorism,
sabotage and treason.
   ``We are very happy to see them come out,'' said ANC official
Reggie September. ``Even a short time in prison is too long for
anybody.''
   More than 100 family members and friends provided an emotional
welcome for the men, who arrived from Robben Island prison off Cape
Town.
   The ANC has demanded the release of all political prisoners,
estimated at up to 3,000, before it will enter full-scale
negotiations with the government on ending apartheid.
   President F.W. de Klerk's government has promised to free all
inmates convicted of political offenses, but has not said how many
people fall in that category. Dozens of prisoners have been
released in recent months.
   ANC leader Nelson Mandela on Tuesday visited ANC members held at
Robben Island and Pollsmoor prisons near Cape Town to explain the
government's plans.
   Mandela served 27 years in the two prisons for plotting to
overthrow the government. He was released in February.
   ``We have set a date by which all political prisoners will be
released and that is the end of April 1991,'' he said.
   The return of ANC exiles is another major obstacle to
negotiations on a new constitution.
   De Klerk on Monday said ANC exiles could begin applying for
amnesty that would clear the way for their return to South Africa.
   De Klerk says he wants to draw up a new constitution with
opposition groups that would allow the 5 million whites and 30
million blacks to share power. The government and the ANC have been
holding preliminary talks since May.
   The ANC is pushing for a one-person, one-vote system.
   The white-dominated government's apartheid system deprives
blacks of a vote in national affairs, controls the economy and
maintains separate residential areas and schools.

<TEXT>
   Three co-defendants of Manuel Noriega lost bids to
be tried separately from the ousted Panamanian leader on
drug-trafficking charges.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler on Tuesday denied separate
trials for Luis Del Cid, a former chief aide to Noriega; William
Saldarriaga, an alleged drug trafficker from Colombia; and Brian
Alden Davidow, an alleged drug dealer in Miami.
   Some defense lawyers have argued that the huge volume of
testimony against Noriega could prejudice jurors against his
co-defendants even if it did not apply to them.
   ``This just happens to be a case where sitting next to Noriega
has an atomic effect and Davidow would suffer from the fallout,''
said Richard Sharpstein, attorney for Davidow. ``The evidence is so
overwhelming and on such a massive scale that (Davidow) would be
severely prejudiced by the spillover.''
   Noriega, Del Cid, Saldarriaga and Davidow were among 16 people
indicted in Miami in February 1988 on charges of taking part in a
conspiracy that made Panama a way station and processing center for
Columbia's Medellin drug cartel. The trial is officially scheduled
to begin Jan. 28.
   ``I feel sorry for some guy who should have had a two-to-three
week trial and now has a six-to-eight month trial,'' said Noriega
attorney Frank Rubino, who noted the co-defendants could also
experience the lengthy delays expected in preparation of the
general's defense.
   ``Even if the money became available today, it would be six to
nine months before a half-dozen investigators I would have to
employ could go through the thousands and thousands of records and
documents in Panama that I am told exist,'' he said.
   Diane Cossin, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen,
said prosecutors were pleased with the judge's ruling against
separate trials.
   ``The grand jury returned an indictment against all of the
defendants,'' she said. ``We feel they should be tried together.''
   Drug pilot Eduardo Pardo, another co-defendant, has already
pleaded guilty to flying $800,000 in cocaine profits from Fort
Lauderdale to Panama in May 1983. He is awaiting sentencing.

   An American soldier opened fire with
an automatic rifle in a military dining hall, shooting and killing
one soldier, wounding another, then seriously wounding himself,
officials said today.
   The assailant was in critical condition, and officials gave no
motive for the shooting incident on Tuesday.
   Capt. Charles Brunson, spokesman for the U.S. Army 3rd Armored
Division, said the attack occurred at the Grafenwoehr military
training area in northern Bavaria state, 50 miles east of
Nuremberg.
   He said the shooter was assigned to the 2nd Battalion 67th Armor
Regiment.
   Brunson said the other wounded soldier was in satisfactory
condition at a German hospital in the area.
   The names of all three American soldiers were withheld pending
notification of relatives.
   Brunson said he could not immediately confirm what type of
weapon was used in the shootings.
   Bavarian state police reported that it was a rapid-fire M-16
military rifle. They also said the soldier who did the shooting is
22 years old.
   The police released no further details.

<TEXT>
   Authorities in Rwanda have arrested more
than 1,500 suspected rebel sympathizers in the nation's capital and
continued their house-to-house searches today, sources said.
   The sweep began when gunbattles broke out in the capital on
Friday, five days after Rwandan refugees living in Uganda invaded
their country seeking to overthrow its ruler, President Juvenal
Habyarimana.
   The rebels remained dug in the nation's northeastern corner,
said sources in Kigali, the capital. They spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The central African nation of Rwanda has aked the United States
for military supplies and the request is being considered, the U.S.
State Department said Tuesday.
   The sources said Kigali was calm today. Rwandan troops patrolled
the streets and manned checkpoints, and French and Belgian troops
controlled the airport and the road to it from the capital, they
said.
   France and Belgium have sent nearly 1,000 troops to Rwanda to
protect their citizens and embassies. France has urged the
approximately 300 French citizens still in Rwanda to leave.
   Rwandan authorities claim Friday's street battles were caused by
rebel infiltrators and say they have arrested 500 suspected
sympathizers for questioning.
   The rebel group denies any of its members entered Kigali and
says the fighting was between Rwandan army loyalists and soldiers
trying to desert to join the insurgency.
   Sources said the number detained for questioning appeared to be
much higher than that cited by the government.
   One source quoted witnesses who had seen approximately 1,500
detainees held at a sports stadium outside Kigali earlier this
week.
   A Western diplomat said the detainees had been moved to jails in
and around Kigali and estimated the number held at about 2,000.
   The detainees are predominantly Tutsi and include businessmen,
intellectuals, senior civil servants and clergymen, the sources
said.
   Most of the rebels are members of the minority Tutsi tribe,
which ruled Rwanda until the majority Hutu gained control in the
late 1950s. In the early 1960s, the Hutu brutally put down a Tutsi
uprising, killing more than 10,000 and forcing hundreds of
thousands to flee to neighboring countries.
   The invaders, calling themselves the Rwandese Patriotic Front,
are members or offspring of the more than 250,000 Tutsis who sought
safe haven in Uganda. Many are Ugandan army deserters.
   The government Monday said its forces continued to battle the
rebels in the country's northeast and put the number of the
invaders at 10,000.
   The rebels say they want to install a democratic government and
repatriate all refugees. They accuse Habyarimana's government of
corruption, human rights abuses and dictatorial leadership, and of
stalling on the refugee issue. He has ruled since a coup in 1973.
   The government has said the country of 8 million is too crowded
to accomodate the more than 1 million Rwandan refugees in
neighboring countries and around the world.
   Rwanda is among the most crowded nations in the world. An
average of more than 566 people live on every square mile, compared
with a nationwide average in the United States of 63 per square
mile.

<TEXT>
   Richard Murdoch, one of Britain's best loved radio
comedians in the 1930s and 1940s who went on to delight movie,
theater and TV audiences into the 1980s, has died. He was 83.
   Murdoch died Tuesday after collapsing earlier in the day while
playing golf at Walton Heath, 20 miles south of London, family
members said. The cause of his death was not released.
   Murdoch, a tall, droll and elegant man who was received his
college education at Cambridge University, once said in an
interview: ``I've never been in a show where I had to be anyone
else but me.''
   He often played down his talent as a comedian, once declaring:
``The more you do, the easier this kind of thing becomes.'' He
insisted that golf and sailing were his main interests.
   Murdoch began his show business career in 1927 as a dancer in
the chorus of a London stage show, ``The Blue Train,'' but soon
branched out into radio comedy. He starred with the late Arthur
Askey in a popular radio comedy show, ``Band Waggon,'' launched by
the British Broadcasting Corp. in 1938.
   The weekly half-hour show emptied city streets as millions of
Britons hurried home to tune in. Its success was cut short by World
War II in 1939.
   During the war Murdoch joined the Royal Air Force, where he
became an intelligence officer at a variety of air bases.
   His next success on BBC radio was ``Much Binding in the Marsh''
in the 1940s, a weekly comedy about armed forces life set on an air
base.
   Murdoch's movies included ``Band Waggon'' in 1939 and ``The
Ghost Train'' in 1941.
   In the 1980s, he appeared in the popular weekly TV comedy series
``Rumpole of the Bailey'' about life in London's Old Bailey Central
Criminal Court. In the series, which was shown on public television
in the United States, he played Uncle Tom, the barrister who never
gets a brief.
   Murdoch is survived by his wife, actress Peggy Rawlings, whom he
married in 1932, as well as a son and two daughters.
   Funeral plans have not been announced.

   An attempted jailbreak was foiled when
the two inmates trying to escape made so much racket that other
prisoners complained to guards, who caught the men in a crawl
space, officials said.
   The two were using a piece of metal to chip through an
eight-inch concrete wall at the Okanogan County Jail when they woke
up other prisoners at about midnight Monday, jailer Dan Slattery
said Tuesday. The men removed a ceiling light fixture to get into
the crawl space.
   Sheriff Jim Weed said even if the men had been able to chip
through the outside wall, they would have found themselves 80 feet
above the ground.
   Billy Dale Anderson, 22, and David Cabarett, 33, face
second-degree attempted escape charges, Slattery said.
   Both men were booked in September for investigation of burglary,
Slattery said.

   Discovery returned home
today, landing safely on a desert lakebed, after a virtually
flawless mission that sent a sun probe hurtling through space and
lifted morale at NASA.
   ``Rescue teams glad to have you back, also to have the fastest
manmade object in the universe well on its way. Congratulations on
a picture-perfect mission,'' Mission Control's Brian Duffy told the
five-man crew.
   Discovery touched down at 6:57 a.m. PDT, shortly after sunrise,
precisely as planned. The arrival was preceded by the usual two
sonic booms sweeping the desert.
   More than 5,200 people cheered and applauded as the shuttle
landed on a concrete runway on a dry lakebed in the Mojave Desert.
The touchdown, like the rest of the flight, was extremely smooth.
   Discovery circled Earth 66 times during the four-day mission,
logging 1,707,445 miles.
   The flight - the first shuttle mission in nearly six months -
has helped rebuild NASA's image, battered in recent months by the
flawed Hubble Space Telescope and hydrogen leaks on the two other
shuttles.
   ``This flight is probably as close to perfect as we can get,''
flight director Ron Dittemore said Tuesday. The six-month delay was
the longest gap between missions since shuttle flights resumed
after the 1986 Challenger accident.
   Discovery blasted into orbit just a few minutes behind schedule
Saturday. Several hours later, the five astronauts deployed the
Ulysses solar probe exactly as planned.
   Ulysses continued to race through space on a 1.86 billion-mile,
five-year journey. It will travel to Jupiter to use the planet's
gravity to sling it back across the solar system and into an
unprecedented orbit around the sun's poles.
   The $250 million spacecraft is expected to pass over the sun's
poles in 1994 and 1995.
   On Tuesday, the astronauts retracted the shuttle's 50-foot robot
arm, which had been extended in an experiment to measure the
deteriorating effects of space on an Intelsat satellite that is
stuck in a useless low orbit. Material attached to the arm was
identical to that used on the satellite's solar panels.
   Intelsat, an organization of countries that owns the
communications satellite, will study the amount of decay and decide
whether it is worth sending astronauts on a rescue mission in 1992.
   Discovery's other crew members are mission specialists Bill
Shepherd and Bruce Melnick.
   Atlantis is due to fly next on a secret military mission in
early November. The mission originally was scheduled for July but
was delayed by hydrogen leaks.
   Some repairs still must be completed in Atlantis' engine
compartment, which was damaged by a metal beam left there by
workers. The 9-foot beam left about 25 dents and dings when it
rattled around while the shuttle was hoisted upright.

<TEXT>
   The husband of ousted Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto was arrested today for allegedly kidnapping a
Pakistani-born British citizen and extorting $800,000 from him.
   Asif Ali Zardari, largely blamed for his wife's legal problems
since the Aug. 6 dismissal of her government, was arrested and
charged at the Sindh High Court. The army-backed caretaker
government had hinted for weeks that the arrest of the 38-year-old
Karachi businessman was imminent.
   Zardari was charged in the April kidnapping of businessman
Murtaza Hussain Bukhari and taken for interrogation to the Federal
Investigation Agency, comparable to the FBI. He was also charged
with extortion.
   Conviction for kidnapping is punishable by seven years in jail,
while extortion carries a 10-year sentence.
   Authorities said Zardari would not be able to apply for bail,
forcing him to spend at least one night in jail.
   When Bukhari reported the alleged abduction to police and the
British Embassy in Islamabad, he implicated Zardari.
   Bukhari claimed he met Zardari to discuss building a hospital in
southern Sindh, Ms. Bhutto's home province. He said that at a
second meeting, an associate of Zardari's, Ghulam Hussain Unar,
pinned him down, strapped a time bomb to his leg and forced him to
cash $800,000 in checks at a Karachi bank.
   Although Zardari was not present at the second meeting, Bukhari
has contended the former prime minister's husband was part of the
plot.
   Unar, a former provincial legislator and member of Ms. Bhutto's
Pakistan People's Party, was arrested in June.
   Ms. Bhutto wed Zardari in a highly publicized arranged marriage
in December 1987, a year before she became the first woman leader
of a modern Moslem nation.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed her government Aug. 6 on
charges of corruption, incompetence and abuse of power. Many
supporters and critics have blamed Zardari for her fall from power
after only 20 months.
   Zardari, an avid polo player with a jet-setter reputation, has
been accused by the Pakistani media and the caretaker government of
demanding commissions for lucrative government contracts.
   He has vehemently denied the allegations, which earned him the
nickname ``Mr. 10 Percent.'' He had been expected to be the key
target of the corruption investigations, but the caretaker
government instead launched a legal assault on Ms. Bhutto to try to
discredit her party and force her to abandon politics.
   Zardari's father, Hakim Ali Zardari, also has been charged with
corruption. The elder Zardari, who headed the committee that
oversaw government public spending, was in London when the
government was abruptly dissolved.

<TEXT>
   When Nicaragua's new government yanked
subsidies for public services, utility bills took off and diplomats
hit the roof.
   But instead of refusing to pay, as many Nicaraguans are doing,
the foreign officials organized a protest and their bills were put
on hold pending an investigation.
   ``We pay the light and water (bills) when they are normal, but
not when they are exaggerated,'' said Soviet Embassy press attache
Vyacheslav Spassky.
   A diplomatic source said the Soviets were stunned by an electric
bill in July for $4,000. Under the Sandinistas, who were voted out
of office in February, monthly utility bills rarely exceeded a few
hundred dollars.
   President Violeta Chamorro's economic restructuring program
passed the full cost of electric, water and sewer and telephone
services to consumers.
   Central Bank President Francisco Mayorga recently said the
government reduced its monthly deficit from $28 million in April,
when Mrs. Chamorro took over, to $7 million in September.
   Nicaraguans, however, have not quickly adapted to the new prices
after a decade of Sandinista subsidies.
   The first effects of the austerity program surfaced in July with
food, gas and utility price increases that jolted people in a
country where wages of less than $100 a month are common.
   A government official, who asked that her name not be used, said
her mother received an $800 water bill, based on the official
exchange rate.
   The black market rate, once well above the official rate, is now
only slightly better than at the banks.
   ``This goes beyond ridiculous. It is just incredible, it's
astounding, it's, it's ... '' the exasperated official said.
   With electricity, a typical family bill that was $8 a month is
now around $117.
   The diplomatic protest began last month at a dinner when
somebody complained about soaring utility bills, said U.S. Embassy
spokesman Stedman Howard.
   Soon, all the 42 accredited foreign missions in Managua
confronted the Foreign Ministry, which appointed a committee to
look into the complaints and told the embassies to hold off paying
bills until meters and consumption were checked.
   Technicians found broken water pipes at the North Korean Embassy
that explained high water bills there, said ministry spokesman
David Silva.
   But the Libyans would not let technicians in to check out the
water meters, and Cuban officials complained that meter readers
never got close enough to take a reading.
   Although Howard declined to say how much the U.S. Embassy was
being billed, he said his home electric bill went from $200 to $780
in one month.
   ``That's indicative of the general trend,'' Howard said.

   President Bush's job approval rating has
fallen to the lowest point of his presidency, a media group said
today.
   The Times Mirror Center for The People &amp; The Press, which
monitors public interest in the news each month, said its survey
put Bush's rating at 55 percent, 21 points below the rating he was
given in early August.
   Last month, 68 percent of those surveyed said they approved of
Bush's handling of the presidency.
   The previous low - 61 percent - came in February 1989, the month
after Bush was inaugurated. Ten days before he took office, Bush's
approval rating was 59 percent.
   The president's highest rating - 80 percent - came in surveys
taken in January after the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   Twenty-eight percent of those in the most recent survey said
they disapproved of Bush's job performance and 17 percent said they
didn't know.
   The survey also indicated that the most closely followed stories
in the news are the crisis in the Persian Gulf and the resulting
increase in gasoline prices. But Americans paid much less attention
to the domestic budget crunch.
   The news industry group said 68 percent of Americans surveyed
said the Mideast crisis, which began Aug. 2 when Iraq invaded
Kuwait, was the most important news of September.
   Sixty-three percent said they were following very closely news
about the U.S. troop deployment in Saudi Arabia and other
developments in the wake of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. That
was the same percentage as did so in August.
   On the other hand, 62 percent said they paid close attention to
stories about rising gasoline prices, compared with 56 percent in
the previous month.
   The percentage of the public who paid close attention to news
about hostages held in Iraq and Kuwait declined from 57 percent to
47 percent.
   Although the poll was taken Oct. 4-7, the period in which budget
negotiations broke down and a government shutdown was ordered, only
34 percent said they were closely following news about efforts to
resolve the budget impasse.
   However, 45 percent said they were aware that gasoline tax
increases were being considered, 38 percent had heard that
cigarette taxes might be raised and 40 percent knew that alcohol
tax increases were under consideration.
   Among people under 30, only 20 percent said they were following
the budget news closely. The percentage increased with age and
reached 46 percent among people 50 and older.
   The results were based on telephone interviews of 1,213 adults
conducted under the direction of Princeton Survey Research
Associates by The Gallup Organization in Lincoln, Neb. The margin
of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEAD>Party Takes No Action on Economic Reform, Plans to Cut Its Staff</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party has decided to stay out of the
debate over how the country should move to a market economy, and it
plans to cut its headquarters' staff nearly in half, officials said
today.
   After a two-day meeting of the party's policy making Central
Committee, Deputy General Secretary Vladimir Ivashko told a news
conference the Soviet legislature should decide the nation's
economic future.
   ``It would be wrong if the plenary session of the Communist
Party Central Committee turned into an affiliate of the Supreme
Soviet and started competing on various aspects of a particular
program,'' he said.
   The legislature is considering conflicting plans for the
transition from a centrally planned economy to a market one.
   The Central Committee's restraint is in line with President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's attempts to specify more clearly the powers
of the party and state and to give the legislature independence.
But its failure to endorse an economic plan could be seen by many
Soviets as indecision.
   The committee traditionally has made proposals to the
legislature, which then dutifully enacted them.
   But the current legislature, the Supreme Soviet, was
democratically elected in part and is more wary of party proposals.
   While not committing the party to an economic plan, Ivashko did
differ with proposals to privatize industry. He said a nationwide
referendum should be held on the question.
   Gorbachev referred to the difficulties of plotting economic
reform in a meeting today with executives of the New York Stock
Exchange.
   ``These days we are deciding the question of how we should move
forward. Everybody is facing a lot of questions. We do, and people
have even more,'' Gorbachev, the party chief, told the American
visitors.
   In a move that coincides wih declining party membership, the
Central Committee will cut its headquarters staff by 40.4 percent,
Ivashko announced.
   He said later in an interview that 580 employees will be laid
off, leaving about 800. More than 500 were dismissed last year. The
Communist Party has about 18 million members.
   In a partial concession to demonstrators that have been
demanding the party give up property it nationalized, Ivashko said
buildings with historical and cultural significance and small
churches now in the party's hands will be made into monuments. He
said the party would not ask for compensation and would turn over
the buildings gradually.
   The party has valued its property at 4.9 billion rubles, or $8.2
billion at the official rate.

   The Navy has halted its search for eight
Marines lost and presumed killed in Monday's crash of two Huey
helicopters over the Arabian Sea, officials said today.
   The search was stopped at 3:30 a.m. EDT on Tuesday. A Marine
Corps headquarters statement said the announcement was delayed
until today to verify that all next-of-kin had been notified.
   The statement said Navy search teams found no indications of
survivors during an extensive air and water search of the area.
Some floating debris, including aircraft parts from each
helicopter, were recovered.
   The statement said the cause of the accident, which occurred at
night, is still under investigation.
   The eight Marines were identified as: Capt. Gary S. Dillon, 29,
of Merrimack County, N.H; Capt. William D. Cronin Jr., 29, of Du
Page County, Ill.; Capt. Kevin R. Dolvin, 29, of Stark County,
Ohio; Capt. William J. Hurley, 27, of Cook County, Ill.; Sgt.
Kenneth T. Keller, 26, of Cook County, Ill.; Sgt. John R. Kilkus,
26, of Norfolk County, Mass.; Cpl. Timothy W. Romei, 22, of San
Francisco County, Calif.; and Lance Cpl. Thomas R. Adams, 20, of
Baton Rouge County, La.
   The Marine Corps did not release the men's hometowns or other
information.
   All eight were part of a search-and-rescue squadron based at the
Marine Corps Air Station at Camp Pendleton, Calif.
   The helicopter crews were conducting routine night training
operations about eight miles from their shipboard base when radar
and radio contact was lost at 5:13 a.m. local time Monday, Pentagon
spokesman Pete Williams said.

   A black man once reportedly suspected
of killing a pregnant white woman in an apparent hoax by her
husband that inflamed Boston's racial tensions has been sentenced
to 12 to 25 years in prison for robbery.
   William Bennett, 40, of Boston was convicted Friday in
Barnstable Superior Court of robbing a Brookline video store at
gunpoint Oct. 2, 1989. Judge Robert W. Banks sentenced Bennett
Tuesday.
   Bennett reportedly was identified by Charles Stuart as most
resembling the person he claimed had shot him and his pregnant
wife, Carol, after jumping in their car and robbing them last Oct.
23 in Boston.
   Mrs. Stuart died hours after the shooting. Her prematurely
delivered son died 17 days later. Stuart was hospitalized with a
bullet wound.
   Last January, after Stuart was implicated in the shootings, he
apparently committed suicide by jumping from a bridge into the
Mystic River.
   Authorities then said Bennett no longer was considered a
suspect.
   Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Louis F. Sabadini
said at Bennett's sentencing he had a record of 37 convictions,
including shooting a police officer, shooting a taxi driver and
firing a shotgun at a police cruiser.
   Bennett's lawyer said he will appeal the verdict. Bennett is
also awaiting trial on a charge of armed robbery of a Boston yogurt
shop.

   Barbara Boggs Sigmund, the colorful and
eloquent mayor who finished second to Gov. Jim Florio in the 1989
Democratic gubernatorial primary, died early today, borough
officials said. She was 51.
   Police Officer Bernard Lenhardt said Mrs. Sigmund died at home.
She had been suffering from a recurrence of a cancer.
   Mrs. Sigmund was the daughter of retiring U.S. Rep. Lindy Boggs,
a New Orleans Democrat, and the late Hale Boggs, who was the House
majority leader and who was scheduled to become speaker of the
House when he was killed in a plane crash in 1972. Mrs. Boggs
reportedly made her decision to retire from the the House to spend
more time with Mrs. Sigmund.
   The mayor was first stricken with cancer seven years ago. A
malignant melanoma was found behind her left eye and the eye was
removed in 1982.
   Late last year, Mrs. Sigmund announced the melanoma had
reappeared and spread. After losing her eye, Mrs. Sigmund made her
large collection of fashionable eye patches her trademark,
coordinating them with the color of her outfits.
   As a campaign gimmick during the primary, she distributed eye
patches to businessmen, lobbyists and politicians boarding a
Chamber of Commerce chartered train to Washington.
   She was a former Mercer County freeholder and was an
unsuccessful candidate for U.S. Senate in 1982. She had been widely
expected to run for Congress - following in the footsteps of her
mother and father - if Republican Rep. James Courter's bid for the
governor's office succeeded and his seat became available.
   Courter lost. But by the time he announced he would retire from
Congress, Mrs. Sigmund was waging a new battle against cancer.
   Florio today said Mrs. Sigmund ``had no peer ... as a friend, a
leader and a source of joy and inspiration.''
   Gov. Thomas H. Kean called Mrs. Sigmund ``a woman of remarkable
courage, who kept through a difficult time with a sense of
perspective and humor.''
   Mrs. Sigmund enjoyed writing poetry, and recently published a
collection of poetry and prose called ``An Unfinished Life.''

   Three Supreme Court justices voiced doubts
today about the wisdom or legality of an employer's ``fetal
protection'' policy that excludes all women of childbearing age
from some hazardous jobs.
   In a case that could affect millions of working women, Justices
John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia and Sandra Day O'Connor posed
questions seemingly critical of the policy during an hour-long
argument session.
   Stevens questioned Stanley Jaspan, a lawyer for the
Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls Inc., about the risks to women
working in its battery-making factories.
   ``Is the slightest risk enough'' to justify banning women from
some jobs, Stevens asked.
   O'Connor and Scalia took issue with Jaspan's interpretation of
what burdens Congress placed on employers when it passed the
Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978.
   Scalia told Jaspan his suggestion that the 1978 law means
employers cannot discriminate against women based on pregnancy
except to protect a fetus ``is to make a farce of the Pregnancy
Discrimination Act. You're making it a ridiculous piece of
legislation.''
   Since 1982, Johnson Controls, the nation's largest auto battery
manufacturer, has barred women from factory jobs that expose them
to unsafe levels of lead, the principal material used in making
batteries.
   The policy was upheld by lower courts.
   Lead exposure is a health risk for female workers and their
fetuses.
   Lead exposure, of course, also is a health risk for male
workers. But the scientific proof that high levels of lead in a
man's blood can contribute to fetal harm is sketchy.
   ``It would violate common sense ... to require an employer to
damage unborn children,'' Jaspan argued. He said lead exposure
``poisons the fetus and causes permanent brain damage.''
   But San Francisco lawyer Marsha Berzon, representing those who
challenged the Johnson Controls policy, said ``the net effect of a
policy like this is to sanction the re-segregation of the
workplace.''
   She said such policies relegate women to stereotypical jobs such
as teaching, child care and nursing.
   The justices must decide by July whether the fetal protection
policy amounts to illegal discrimination.
   One federal appeals court judge, calling the case the most
important of its kind since Congress outlawed on-the-job sex bias
26 years ago, said the estimated number of women affected runs as
high as 20 million.
   At Johnson Controls, women who could not prove they were
infertile were forced to transfer to other jobs, although their
salaries were not cut. Some of the women were in their 60s.
   Fertile women now hired are ineligible for top-paying jobs at
the company's 13 plants, located in California, Delaware, Florida,
Illinois, Kentucky, North Carolina, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio,
Oregon, Texas, Vermont and Wisconsin.
   Eight employees and the United Auto Workers union challenged the
policy in court, alleging that it violates Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964.
   It was not the first such challenge. At least 15 major
corporations have fetal protection policies, and the American Civil
Liberties Union says lawsuits have been filed in behalf of hospital
technicians and factory and auto workers.
   Among the companies with such policies are General Motors,
Monsanto and DuPont.
   U.S. District Judge Robert W. Warren in Milwaukee ruled for
Johnson Controls before any trial was held, and the 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals voted 7-4 to uphold his ruing.
   Judge John L. Coffey wrote for the appeals court that the
differing treatment of women employees was based on a ``business
necessity.'' The appeals court concluded that the policy ``is
reasonably necessary to industrial safety.''
   Bush administration lawyers told the high court that a fetal
protection policy could be legal, but that it should be judged by a
standard more stringent than the ``business necessity'' test used
by the appeals court.
   In a strongly worded dissent to the appeals court ruling, Judge
Frank Easterbrook called the case the most important Title VII case
ever and said such policies could ``consign more women to `women's
work' while reserving better-paying but more hazardous jobs for
men.''
   He noted that lead is only one of many workplace substances that
could harm fetuses, and said as many as 20 million jobs could be
closed to women if the 7th Circuit court's rationale were adopted
nationwide.
   In action Tuesday, the Supreme Court:
   -Let stand a ruling in a Pennsylvania case that public schools
that allow civic groups and others to rent space cannot refuse the
same access to religious organizations.
   -Agreed to decide in a Florida case whether police without a
court warrant may conduct random searches aboard buses and trains.
   -Left intact an affirmative action program plan for hiring and
promoting more minorities and women in San Francisco's fire
department. The plan had been challenged as discriminatory against
white men.
   -Revived a $4 billion lawsuit by a millionaire Florida inventor
who says an ABC television program falsely portrayed him as a liar
and hypocrite.

   An American economist and an Israeli
human rights lawyer were among the winners today of the Right
Livelihood Awards, which honor grass-roots work that helps people
and solves social problems.
   A West African peasant leader and a Colombian agricultural
workers' organization also won.
   The awards, often called the alternative Nobel prizes, were
founded in 1980 by Jakob von Uexkull, a Swedish-German writer who
sold his stamp collection to provide the funding.
   Von Uexkull wanted to support people and organizations doing
practical work. He said the Nobel Prizes hade become too
specialized and tend to focus on scientists and other products of
Western universities, rather than grass-roots innovators.
   The awards will be presented in the Swedish Parliament on Dec.
9, the day before the Nobel Prize ceremonies.
   Alice Tepper Marlin, founder and president of the Council on
Economic Priorities in New York, won one award.
   The international award jury cited her for ``the courage and
vision to show the directions in which the Western economy must
develop if it is to contribute to - instead of harming - global
security and the well-being of humanity.''
   The council is an independent research organization that focuses
on national security, energy and the environment, and corporate
responsibility.
   It publishes monthly newsletters, studies and books, including
the 1988 bestseller ``Shopping for a Better World,'' a guide that
rates companies according to ecological and social criteria.
   Ms. Martin's award was honorary because her organization was
deemed large enough to generate funding.
   The three other winners, however, each received cash awards of
$120,000 to help them continue their work.
   They included human rights lawyer Felicia Langer, 59, who since
1968 has defended Palestinians in military courts in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The jury cited her
``exemplary courage ... for basic human rights under very difficult
circumstances.''
   Langer moved to Tuebingen, Germany, in July to teach law at the
University of Bremen.
   Bernard Ledea Ouedraogo of Burkina Faso was honored for
establishing the grass-roots organizations NAAM and the Six S
Association, which promote peasant self-help movements.
   Ouedraogo believes that Africa's problems can only be solved by
applying traditional African methods, von Uexkull said.
   The Six S is a federation of peasant organizations that
disburses financial aid to local farmers groups. NAAM's activities
range from building projects to manufacturing and trade.
   A Colombian agricultural workers' organization, the Association
of Peasant Workers of Carare, won the prize for its efforts to
promote peace. Four of its leaders were slain in February.
   The association is involved in ecological projects in Colombia
and the promotion of self-reliance.
   Since October 1989, it has concentrated on peacemaking by
organizing meetings among guerillas and military and paramilitary
units.

   A fire broke out aboard an oil rig in the
Gulf of Mexico, injuring six workers.
   The fire started shortly before midnight Tuesday and burned for
about 45 minutes. The cause was under investigation, said Jay
Cheatham, vice president and southeastern district manager for Arco
Oil &amp; Gas Co.
   The platform was six miles out from the mouth of the Mississippi
River, about 100 miles southeast of New Orleans, the Coast Guard
said.
   Coast Guard and civilian helicopters evacuated the injured
crewmen to New Orleans area hospitals. Only one suffered serious
burns, the Coast Guard said.
   Mitchell Ham, 28, has second- and third-degree burns and was in
critical condition, said West Jefferson Medical Center spokesman
Jim Pittman.
   A civilian company was hired to do cleanup work, Petty Officer
Dennis Schaefer said.
   ``The boats were shooting water on the fire, and there probably
was a little bit of oil that washed over as a result of that, but
as far as we know there's no spill coming from the platform at this
time,'' Cheatham said.

   Trade watchers in the Agriculture Department
are straining to see what other countries are doing that could
affect the prices American farmers get for wheat, corn and other
commodities.
   In other words, competition is the name of the game, and
practically every foreign grain exporter is swinging away.
   For example, a report by the department's Foreign Agricultural
Service included an article about the Canadian Wheat Board and its
guaranteed price to farmers in today's competitive world market.
   ``With the recent precipitous decline in world wheat prices,
attention is drawn to the role of export monopolies, such as the
Canadian Wheat Board, and the extent to which guaranteed price
levels to producers may have been overestimated, possibly requiring
government treasuries to cover resulting losses,'' the report said.
   In many international markets, Canadian wheat must compete with
prices established by subsidized wheat from the European Community.
   Meanwhile, the board's initial payment to wheat farmers for No.
1 Canadian Western Red Spring wheat of 13.5 percent protein was
about $117 per metric ton in U.S. dollars.
   But Canadian wheat on the world market is worth only about $69
per ton. Therefore, the report said, the deficit of $48 per ton
presumably would have to be absorbed by the board.
   ``Any losses being sustained by the Canadian Wheat Board on
wheat exports could be offset by profits from sales executed before
the recent price declines or by sales to commercial customers who
pay premium prices for high-protein wheat,'' the report said.
   Some other comments about the current grain situation:
   -Brazil will need to import more wheat in 1990-91 because of
reduced domestic plantings, a crop shortfall and growing
consumption. Although Brazil has a supply agreement with Argentina,
it may have to turn to other suppliers.
   ``Canada, whose wheat trade agreement with Brazil ended in 1988,
has been exporting wheat under an informal agreement,'' the report
said. ``Trade sources indicate that Canada has expressed an
interest in negotiation a new formal agreement but has insisted
that arrearage on past credit sales be paid first.''
   -South Korea has been buying competitively priced feed-quality
wheat from the European Community. The low-quality wheat from
Europe already is displacing corn in the South Korea and could hurt
U.S. exports of feed grain to that growing Asian market.
   -Poland's wheat imports in 1990-91 are expected to drop to the
lowest level in more than 20 years, mostly because of a record 1990
harvest, diminished consumer subsidies and reduced livestock
feeding.
   ``Typically, the EC has been the major supplier of wheat to
Poland,'' the report said. ``However, lower import needs in Poland
could free additional EC supplies for shipments to other markets
and could increase competition for the United States.''
   -In southern East Europe, greater demand for imports of coarse
grain has been spurred by harvest shortfalls in Yugoslavia and
Hungary, major corn-producing countries.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Consumer prices for bananas peaked in July
because of a strike against Chiquita Brands Inc. by workers in
Honduras, according to an Agriculture Department report.
   The United States imported 2.92 million metric tons of bananas
in 1989. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds.
   In late June, a strike against Chiquita Brands ``significantly
disrupted'' shipments of Honduran bananas in July and August and
``resulted in unseasonably high retail prices in U.S. markets,''
the department's Economic Research Service said.
   Total imports of bananas were up during the first six months of
this year, including the period of the Honduran strike, as imports
from Ecuador - the largest supplier - rose 36 percent from a year
earlier.
   Between July 1 and Aug. 18, according to USDA trade figures,
shipments of Honduran bananas to the United States dropped 54
percent from a year earlier to only 27,034 tons.
   The strike ``curtailed Honduran exports of about 108,000 metric
tons over its seven-week duration,'' the report said. The United
States accounts for more than 60 percent of the country's total
banana exports, and Chiquita is the largest handler.
   Meanwhile, U.S. banana prices, which usually soften with stiffer
competition from summer fruits, rose sharply in July as a result of
the reduced supply from Honduras, the report said.
   ``Although the impact was primarily on the East Coast, where the
bulk of Honduran banana imports are sold, West Coast retail prices
also reflected the market shortage,'' the report said.
   In July, the U.S. retail banana prices reported by the Labor
Department averaged 52.9 cents per pound, up 18 percent from June.
   But with the end of the strike and more bananas in the market,
prices dropped sharply in August, averaging 46.3 cents per pound
nationally, a 13 percent drop from July.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Trout farming is sharing in an expanded demand
for fish and other seafood, an annual report by the Agriculture
Department shows.
   Growers in 15 major trout-producing states had total sales of
fish and eggs of about $76.9 million during the year that ended
Aug. 31, according to the report. That was up 7 percent from $71.7
million in 1988-89.
   The sales included 59.9 million pounds of trout valued at $72.6
million, and 349 million trout eggs worth $4.31 million.
   An estimated 95 percent of the trout sold were food-size, the
report said. The average value was $1.14 per pound, up from $1.08
the previous year.
   Idaho was the leader in sales at about $33.1 million. Other
leading producers included California, $11.1 million; Pennsylvania,
$6.14 million; North Carolina, $4.9 million; and Washington, $4.76
million.

   Enrollment tripled at the Orton
School this fall, but there is no risk of overcrowding. Three
students now share the school's single classroom.
   ``Now I have someone to play with at recess,'' said Levi Tibbs,
a fifth-grader who was the school's lone student last year.
   His playmates are sisters Emily Hansen, a second grader, and
Sheri Davis, who is in sixth grade. Their attendance at the 1918
schoolhouse has helped stave off its extinction.
   ``We considered closing it, but if we did, then we'd have to pay
to board those kids in town or we'd have to pay mileage for them to
be driven to school and home every day,'' said county school
Superintendent Jerry Kleinsasser.
   And that trip is no quick jaunt. The nearest town is Fort
Pierre, a long hour's drive down 50 miles of bumpy, winding road
that follows the rugged breaks of the Missouri River.
   Locals call the area starkly beautiful. Outsiders call it
desolate. Winters are harsh and snowy on the Dakota prairie, and
the wind almost never stills.
   ``You can hear the coyotes fighting and jabbering all night
long,'' said teacher Steve Pickner, 31, who lives with his dog in a
rent-free mobile home on the school site. His nearest neighbors are
antelope, grouse and rattlesnakes.
   Pickner is in his first year as a teacher - he graduated from
the University of South Dakota in August - and he has his qualms.
   ``I'd rather teach 50 kids in one class than three in different
grades,'' he said. ``That's 21 separate lessons I have to prepare
each night, but it does keep me busy and helps pass the time out
here.''
   It's hard to get used to the quiet after classes. ``I look
forward to Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays when the mail comes,''
Pickner said.
   Occasionally, he helps mend fences at a nearby ranch that raises
one of the nation's largest private buffalo herds.
   Elementary Principal Elsie Baye says teachers rarely stay more
than a year at Orton. ``It's isolated,'' she admits, and the free
housing is essential to lure teachers to such a rustic outpost.
   Still, she persists in putting the best face on it: ``Someone
who is an artist or wildlife photographer would just love it
there.''
   And as for the children, ``It's a great educational opportunity.
Our rural kids are usually good students. They get a lot of
one-on-one.''
   Levi Tibb's mother, Loretta, taught at the Orton School; her
husband, Wayne, and their three other children all went there.
``They were almost a year ahead of other students when they got to
ninth grade,'' she said.
   In Orton's classroom - big and bright with three desks in the
middle - two students sit together while Pickner tutors the third
across the room.
   An outdated computer sits in one corner; a television set that
gets only one channel sits in another. The other classroom fixtures
include an aging piano, an ant farm, a water fountain and a
microwave oven where the kids and teacher heat their lunches.
   Once a month, a janitor shows up to shine the linoleum floor.
Three times a day, the huge bell atop the freshly painted white
building tolls.
   The bell did not toll this year for the Orton School, but its
future is not assured. Stanley County rural schools once were full,
but fewer ranch families live in the area, Mrs. Tibbs said.
   ``They couldn't all make a living here anymore because milking
cows and a few acres of land just didn't cut it. People sold out to
others, and the remaining ranches got bigger. That cut down on
families and kids in the area,'' she said.
   But Orton is not alone in its tininess. Of the three other rural
schools in Stanley County, none has more than eight students.
   Almost one-fourth of the elementary schools in South Dakota
still have only one or two teachers. Legally, schools cannot be
closed unless enrollment slips to fewer than five. And neither the
kids nor their parents seem inclined abandon the small schools.
   ``It's funner than a big school,'' said Sheri Davis.

   When Denice Sprowl learned a radio station

   ``When she started with the clippers, I was thinking, `What if I

drop out, and Ms. Sprowl emerged a bald-headed winner.

   More than 40 pilot whales have
died near New Zealand's Coromandel Pensinsula over the past few
days after beaching themselves, officials said Wednesday.
   Volunteers and conservation officers managed to coax many of the
whales back to sea, but some returned to the peninsula on the east
coast of New Zealand's North Island or were too exhausted to
survive.
   More than 20 pilot whales died Wednesday on Great Mercury
Island, just off the peninsula, after a pod of about 47 was found
beached the night before, said Warwick Murray, operations manager
for Auckland Conservancy.
   Local residents and conservation officers were able to steer all
but five of the survivors back to sea, but another nine later
washed ashore dead. Many of the survivores were still ``groggy''
and might die, Murray said.
   On Saturday, about 36 whales became stranded or were in trouble
in shallow water south of the peninsula. At least a dozen died.

<TEXT>
   After decades behind the Iron Curtain,
hundreds of Etruscan artifacts have returned to Italy in a major
show from museums in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   The 1,200 artifacts, which were nearly inaccessible to
Westerners for decades, have come home to central Italy, where the
Etruscan culture flourished until the 1st century B.C.
   The exhibit is being hailed as a chance for scholars and the
public to rediscover Etruscan masterpieces hidden away for decades.
   It also is seen as a sign of exciting times to come in the art
world, as the new democracies of Eastern Europe begin to exchange
exhibits with countries that were ideological foes.
   ``This brings together an extraordinary number of masterpieces
that were very little known,'' said Massimo Pallottino, president
of the National Institute of Italian Etruscan Studies.
   ``It's something of exceptional importance.''
   The exhibit in a Gothic castle in Viterbo, 50 miles north of
Rome, was organized by the State Museums of Berlin.
   It includes Etruscan artifacts from 26 museums in Poland,
Hungary, Czechoslovakia and the former East Germany, as well as the
Soviet Union.
   The Etruscans were a powerful empire that dominated Italy before
succumbing to the Roman Empire. They were known for commercial
flair, an elaborate religion and a brilliant artisan tradition,
which included the finest goldwork in ancient Europe.
   The Viterbo show brings together a wide range of Etruscan
artifacts, ranging from a simple ceramic urn shaped like a house
dating from the 9th century B.C., to elaborately carved sarcophagi
from the 2nd and 3rd centuries B.C.
   The highlights include the contents of an 8th century B.C. tomb
of a man known as the Warrior of Tarquinia. Among the 104 pieces
are engraved bronze shields, weapons, bracelets, rings and even a
razor for the afterlife.
   Another rare item is the ``Tile of Capua,'' a 5th-century B.C.
plaque with writing believed to be part of a funeral ritual. It is
the second-longest existing piece of Etruscan writing, which
scientists have never succeeded in translating.
   Several carved stone and alabaster sarcophagi with scenes of
battles or the trip to the afterlife illustrate the Etruscans'
talent for sculpture. On top of a few lies a likeness of the dead
person, often propped up on one elbow as if to enjoy a good
Etruscan meal.
   Also in the exhibit is gold jewelry, including tiny earrings
etched to resemble shields or bunches of grapes from the 3rd to 5th
centuries B.C.
   Many Etruscan treasures wound up in German and Russian hands in
the 19th century, before Italy passed a law limiting exports.
Germans, in particular, did much of the early research on the
Etruscans and were interested in acquiring the pieces.
   Many of the items in the exhibit were difficult for Westerners
to see during Communist rule in Eastern Europe, due to the
difficulty of obtaining tourist visas.
   ``Even some of our experts hadn't seen them,'' said Carlo Maria
Cardoni, director of the exhibit.
   For the Italian organizers, the novelty of having treasures from
Eastern European museums was matched by the novelty of working with
museum officials trained under communism.
   ``Their architect still goes around with a wooden ruler and a
pencil,'' said Cardoni, shaking his head. ``Let him see a computer
that in 35 minutes lays out the show, and it's like hitting him in
the head with a hammer.''
   The Germans were also uneasy about the idea of making a
videocassette of the exhibit, Cardoni said. ``I just went ahead
with it anyway,'' he shrugged.
   The show, which closes Sunday, has toured Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union and may eventually go to France or Japan, Cardoni
said.
   Art experts say the show is an example of the revolution that is
occurring in cultural exchanges now that Communist governments have
fallen or become more moderate.
   ``As curators and scholars, there's always been an international
interest in sharing the cultural wealth of one nation with
another,'' said Jillian Slonim, public information director of the
New York-based American Federation of Arts.
   ``On the practical level, the circumstances have radically
changed in the last short while, along with the changes in the
governments.''

   Members of a leftist band that advocates
the rights of the underpriviliged doused a moving train car with
gasoline and set it on fire, killing 47 people, news reports said
today.
   A survivor said he and other terrified passengers stampeded for
the train's exits as the fire swept through the car Tuesday night.
Fourteen people were injured in the blaze, according to the news
reports.
   The blaze came just hours after six higher-caste students killed
themselves by poisoning, hanging or immolation to protest an
affirmative action for the lower casts announced by Prime Minister
V.P. Singh, Trust of India reported.
   Radicals were calling for a strike today in support of the plan,
which reserves half of the government's vacancies for low-caste
Hindus.
   The train torching was the worst incident linked to Singh's Aug.
7 announcement of the policy. The deaths Tuesday pushed to more
than 150 the number of people killed in related violence.
   United News of India said 47 people were burned to death when
the passenger train car was set ablaze near Hyderabad, 590 miles
south of New Delhi.
   The news agency initially reported that 60 people were killed.
   It quoted official sources as saying 45 bodies had been
recovered and more were trapped in the charred rail car. It was not
immediately known how many passengers were aboard when the blaze
began.
   United News and newspapers quoted local officials and witnesses
as saying the fire was set by members of the People's War Group.
The group is part of the so-called Naxalite movement, which often
resorts to kidnappings and violence to press its claim as an
advocate of the rights of oppressed peoples.
   The Hindu, a daily newspaper based in the southern city of
Madras, said 10 to 15 members of the People's War Group boarded the
train at Cherlapalli and handed out pamphlets protesting a Supreme
Court injunction suspending implementation of the plan on which
Singh's job proposal is based.
   The activists then poured gasoline on the floor of a passenger
car, ignited it and jumped off the train, The Hindu said. Its
report was attributed to a correspondent who visited the site while
the car was still burning.
   The Indian Express, another national newspaper, quoted railroad
officials as giving a similar account and saying one or two
Naxalites might have died in the fire.
   The Naxalite movement was founded in 1967, drawing inspiration
from the late Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung and advocating armed
overthrow of government. The name ``Naxalite'' stems from Naxalbari
village in West Bengal state where the movement started. It later
spread across eastern and southern India.
   The Times of India, another national newspaper, quoted witnesses
as saying the arsonists sang revolutionary songs before jumping off
the 15-car passenger train, which was traveling from Hyderabad to
Warangal.
   Warangal, 80 miles northeast of Hyderabad, is at the core of a
rural region where Naxalite agitation is often reported.
   ``I was sitting in the middle of the compartment,'' The Times
quoted passenger Samba Murthy as saying. ``I heard slogans and
suddenly there was smoke all around and lights went off. About 20
of us could jump off. There was a stampede.''
   Murthy, a contractor from Warangal, added: ``I do not know what
happened to my brother and brother-in-law who were traveling with
me.''
   The Times quoted another passenger, identified only as Narsimha,
as saying the arsonists shouted slogans in support of the strike
called for today by the Naxalites.
   Singh wants to reserve an additional 27 percent of federal jobs
for low-caste Hindus. Twenty-two percent already are reserved for
tribespeople and outcasts, or ``untouchables,'' who are at the very
bottom of Indian society.
   This means fewer upper-caste people would get jobs, even if
their academic qualifications are higher than people from the lower
social classes.
   Strikes, marches and rallies have swelled in New Delhi and
several states across India as the students pressed their protests
by torching buses and stoning government buildings. Police and
paramilitary forces have retaliated with tear gas and bullets.

   Buoyed by a nearly flawless flight
of its fleet leader, NASA headed with renewed confidence toward the
next shuttle sendoff, next month's launch of Atlantis.
   ``The fact that it flew and they had such a textbook mission
really makes us feel good,'' Conrad Nagel, a NASA official in
charge of Atlantis' prelaunch operations, said of the Discovery
mission.
   Atlantis' secret military mission will be the fifth and final
shuttle flight for 1990 - four fewer than planned - unless
Columbia's hydrogen leaks can be repaired in time for a late
November or December launch.
   Safety rather than flight qutas will dictate when Columbia goes
up, said launch director Bob Sieck.
   ``The bottom line is we've got to have safe and successful
missions, and that's always been our goal,'' Sieck said.
   The way to restore NASA's credibility, Sieck said, is to ``set
realistic launch dates given our capabilities and meet the
objectives as close as we can.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration met both those
criteria preparing for Discovery's four-day mission, which ended
Wednesday with a smooth landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
Discovery's liftoff Saturday was just a day later than planned and
was followed by the release of its cargo, the Ulysses sun probe.
   It was Discovery's 11th flight, a shuttle record, and ended the
second-longest grounding of the fleet, caused by dangerous hydrogen
leaks. Discovery had flown the last mission before that, in April.
   Columbia, the oldest spaceship, has logged nine trips, Atlantis
six. Challenger's last journey, which ended in disaster in January
1986, was its 10th.
   Atlantis, like Columbia, has had more than its share of trouble
this year.
   A tanking test on Atlantis in June uncovered hydrogen leaks in
plumbing between the orbiter and external tank, and its July
Pentagon flight was put on hold. Similar leaks had been found in
Columbia in May.
   NASA replaced Atlantis' external tank and attached plumbing, as
well as seals in liquid hydrogen valves on the orbiter side of the
vehicle.
   The repairs were completed Sept. 28. Five days later, a metal
beam from a work platform banged around the engine compartment as
the orbiter was being hoisted into an upright position.
   Workers forgot to remove the 9-foot-long, bright yellow beam.
   Nagel said the space agency is ``extremely fortunate'' the beam
did not cause more damage. About 25 dings and dents were reported,
the worst being a cracked purge duct and a smashed 1-inch section
of an overboard vent line for liquid oxygen.
   NASA planned to move Atlantis from the assembly building to the
launch pad this week. A tanking test to check for hydrogen leaks is
planned for later this month.
   ``We feel like we're going to come through the tanking test with
flying colors,'' Nagel said.
   Columbia, which has endured four failed countdowns since May,
was moved from the pad back to the assembly building Tuesday
because of potentially severe weather. It will be transported early
next week to the other launch pad where it, too, will undergo a
tanking test this month.
   A nine-member investigative team is working seven days a week on
Columbia's leak problem, which appears to be confined to the engine
compartment. Each investigator received a one-way ticket to Florida
and was told he cannot go home until all the leaks are found.
   ``We're going to finally capture this diabolical leak in
Columbia and we're going to get it back in the air, hopefully
before the end of the year,'' Sieck said.
   Sieck doesn't expect this to be the last time a shuttle is
grounded by a mysterious problem that crops up during the
countdown.
   ``We hope they're minimum, but I wouldn't say there never will
be one again,'' he said.

   War jitters from the Middle East helped push
crude oil to more than $41 a barrel during one spurt of feverish
buying today, its highest level since the 1979 Iranian revolution.
   That's nearly double the price before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
on Aug. 2.
   In early trading today, light sweet crude, the U.S. benchmark
grade, was as high as $41.15 per barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the highest price ever for an oil futures contract,
before falling back to $40.88. That was 48 cents above Tuesday's
record close of $40.40 for November delivery.
   Crude oil futures contracts, which promise delivery at a certain
date at a set price, have traded on the New York Mercantile
Exchange since 1983.
   Crude oil last fetched more than $40 a barrel after the 1979
Iranian revolution. But crude would have to hit about $57 in 1990
dollars to equal the real cost of oil from a decade ago, experts
have said.
   Traders said the slayings of 19 Palestinians in a clash with
police in Jerusalem on Monday, Saddam's threat of retaliation and
the approach of winter in the United States - which increases
demand for oil - pushed the price up.
   ``Everybody's worst possible nightmare is fighting breaking out
in the Middle East and another cold winter in the United States,''
said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group Inc.
in Hoboken, N.J.
   Saddam appeared to use the slayings in Jerusalem to lash out at
Israel and the United States. In a statement, he said Iraq has a
new long-range missile that could be launched against Israel and
the U.S.-led forces in Saudi Arabia.
   The benchmark U.S. grade was $22.10 a barrel the day before the
Iraqi invasion. The main reason for the increase has been the
possibility that war will disrupt production, making oil more
scarce and more expensive.
   While futures prices do not directly affect the price of
gasoline at the pump, self-serve unleaded gasoline nationwide rose
2.4 cents in the last week to $1.37 per gallon, the American
Automobile Association said Tuesday.
   The AAA said unleaded gasoline has risen 29.5 cents since Aug.
1.

   The Israeli government today named a three-man
panel led by a former chief of the Mossad secret service to
investigate the killing of 19 Palestinian rioters on the Temple
Mount.
   The investigation was ordered by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
before the U.N. Security Council was to begin debate on condemning
Israel for using police force against rioters. The Security Council
also was expected to order a U.N. inquiry into Monday's bloodbath.
   ``It will now be investigated by ourselves. We don't need a
probe by international factors,'' said Yossi Ahimeir, Shamir's
spokesman. ``The marginal point of whether it was excessive force
or not is to be investigated.''
   Israeli security forces killed 19 Arabs and wounded 140 in
Monday's clash outside the Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third-holiest
site. It was the bloodiest confrontation of the 34-month-old
Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation, and it raised an
immediate world outcry.
   The panel was ordered to investigate events leading to the riot
and the conduct of paramilitary border police in opening fire with
live ammunition.
   Asked what powers the committee would have, Ahimeir said it
could make ``every recommendation they see fit and the prime
minister will decide what to do with it.''
   However, Israel radio reported that it will not have the power
to subpoena reluctant witnesses and its recommendations will not be
binding.
   Ahimeir said the investigation would be headed by reserve Maj.
Gen. Zvi Zamir, who was head of the Mossad from 1968 to 1974. The
other members will be Yaacov Neeman, a prominent attorney, and
Chaim Kubersky, a former director of the Interior Ministry.
   Ahimeir said the committee would report ``as soon as possible.''
When asked whether its hearings would be public, he replied that
they ``involve security and operational details so, if necessary,
discussions will be subject to the usual security laws.''
   The last time such a panel was appointed was in 1985 to examine
the deaths of two Palestinian bus hijackers while in custody of the
Shin Bet security service.
   Members of the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday debated a
resolution condemning the shootings and calling for a U.N.
investigation. The United States was prepared to cast a rare vote
against its ally.
   President Bush criticized Israeli forces for not acting ``with
more restraint.''
   Today, China, Zimbabwe and Kuwait's government-in-exile added
their voices to those condemning Israel for the violence.
   In the occupied territories, soldiers kept more than a million
Palestinians under curfew for a third day to contain unrest
triggered by the violence at the Old City site, which is holy to
both Jews and Moslems.
   In a leaflet issued Tuesday, the PLO-backed leaders of the
Palestinian uprising urged revenge attacks on soldiers and Jewish
settlers.
   The government published a full-page ad in leading dailies
urging Israelis to respond to Monday's riots by showing up at the
Wailing Wall for Simchat Torah holiday celebrations Thursday night.
   The holiday, which means Joy of Torah, marks the end of the
eight-day Sukkot, or Feast of Tabernacles.
   Police Chief Yaacov Turner denied reports in Israeli newspapers
that suggested his troops had failed to heed intelligence
information to expect Monday's riot, and to deploy accordingly.
   The riot began when Palestinians hurled rocks at Jewish
worshippers at the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site and just
below the Al-Aqsa mosque. Twenty-eight Jews were injured by rocks.
   Police then charged at the rioters on the Temple Mount,
initially firing tear gas. According to Israeli officials, the
troops, heavily outnumbered, only later opened fire with live
ammunition.
   The attack was provoked by rumors that Jewish zealots planned to
march on the Temple Mount - which both Moslems and Jews consider
sacred - and reclaim it for Judaism, Palestinians said. The site of
the violence is the most emotionally charged in the lands Israel
captured in the 1967 Middle East War.
   The left-of-center Labor Party published a statement accusing
the government of ``a lax in security that endangered the lives of
Jews at the Wailing Wall.'' The Western Wall is also known as the
Wailing Wall.
   The conservative daily Maariv in a full-page story today, said
some policemen apparently panicked over rumors that colleagues were
trapped in a burning police station on the Mount during the riot.
   ``The opening of fire was not done in planned fashion or by
command, but rather independently based on decisions by isolated
policemen or a small force when they felt their lives were
endangered,'' the newspaper said.

   RALEIGH, N.C. AP) - President Bush, treading carefully on the
tax issue as he campaigned for conservative Sen. Jesse Helms,
promised today to work to ``put together a better package'' to
match the $500 billion in deficit cuts of his rejected plan.
   It was Bush's first test of his professed goodwill toward
Republicans who disagree with him on the budget.
   Helms opposed the package Bush crafted with congressional
leaders, and which was rejected last week by the House, calling it
``a turkey.'' He also has criticized Bush's decision to abandon his
``no new taxes'' campaign pledge.
   ``Of course there are going to be differences,'' Bush told the
fund-raising breakfast in Raleigh's Civic Center.
   Bush steered completely clear of the issue of higher taxes, and
didn't mention them when he ticked off a list of features that the
new budget pact should include.
   The campaign appearances came a day after Bush hinted he might
agree to higher taxes on wealthy Americans in exchange to lower
capital gains tax rates, then abruptly withdrew the offer under
pressure from Republican senators.
   Helms is seeking a fourth term in a heated race against Harvey
Gantt, the liberal, black former mayor of Charlotte. Polls show the
two locked in a dead heat.
   Helms avoided areas of disagreement with the president
completely, calling Bush ``evenhanded'' in all matters.
   ``He's evenhanded. He's always the same: a thoroughbred
gentleman who is recognized around this world, who is recognized as
a courageous and brave leader.
   Later, in St. Petersburg, Fla., Bush told a fund-raising rally
for Republican Gov. Bob Martinez that Democratic control of both
houses of Congress ``is all the more reason for Republicans to
stand for the best possible budget.''
   Bush also defended his decision to shut down the government over
the Columbus Day weekend rather than approve the first version of a
temporary spending bill. ``I did it to keep the pressure on,'' he
said in prepared remarks.
   The president was to wind up his three-state swing through the
South tonight at a GOP reception in Atlanta for Georgia
gubernatorial candidate Johnny Isakson.
   At his Raleigh stop, Bush said, ``My objective now is to put
together a better package, one that meets our target of $500
billion deficit reduction over the next five years.''
   ``I can't confine my support to somebody who agrees with me on a
deficit deal today or some bill tomorrow,'' Bush said Tuesday when
asked whether he would have trouble campaigning for Helms.
   In today's remarks, Bush made no mention of the divisive issue
of higher taxes for wealthy Americans. The president on Tuesday did
a flip-flop on the issue, first suggesting at a morning news
conference that he was open to a compromise that would trade higher
tax rates for affluent Americans for a cut in the capital-gains
tax.
   Then, later in the day, Republican leaders said Bush had
reversed his position on the issue.
   The budget package rejected by the House, which called for
higher taxes on gasoline, cigarettes and alcohol and cuts in
Medicare and farm programs, ``was not the one I would have written
alone,'' Bush said.
   ``And it's not one Jesse would have written either. But as
president, I don't control the Congress and so we had to compromise
- because the future of the country is at stake.''
   He said he worked for the bipartisan agreement because it was
``the best plan possible.'' And, said Bush, ``I will continue now
to press hard for a budget that fulfills the spirit of that
bipartisan plan and proves to the American people once and for all
that we can deal with this deficit.
   Like many conservative Republicans, Helms was a critic of the
$500 billion, five-year package of new taxes and spending cuts
crafted by Bush and congressional leaders but rejected last week in
the House.
   Among its many features, the plan would have raised taxes on
cigarettes - extremely unpopular in tobacco states like North
Carolina.
   Helms even voted against a vague budget outline approved late
Monday in the Senate with Bush's endorsement - an outline that
didn't specify what would be taxed.
   Still, it was Bush's second campaign appearance for Helms. He
also helped him raise money for his campaign in June.
   ``I would be talking about the common themes,'' Bush said.
``We're talking about the broad principles that unite us.''

<HEAD>One Marine Missing After Training Mission Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Marine parachutist was killed and
five others were injured in a jump during a night training mission,
officials said.
   The accident occurred Tuesday night when the Marines jumped out
of a helicopter into a wooded area at the Oak Grove Training
Facility in Jones County in eastern North Carolina. The training
center is part of Camp Lejeune, based in neighboring Onslow County.
   The body of the dead parachutist was discovered today in the
Trent River, base spokesman Lt. Colleen Ryan said. He was assigned
to the 2nd Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company, 2nd Surveillance,
Reconnaissance and Intelligence Group at Camp Lejeune. His name was
not released pending notification of relatives, Ryan said.
   Three of the injured Marines were treated for minor cuts and
scrapes and released. Two others were being kept for observation.
   In the Persian Gulf, a sudden spate of air crashes has left four
dead and eight missing. Many of the aircraft mishaps involving
American forces in Saudi Arabia have occurred in darkness,
underscoring that U.S. forces are stressing training for night
fighting.
   But base officials said the accident Tuesday was unrelated to
the preparations in the Middle East.
   ``This is normal, routine training,'' said Staff Sgt. Rick
Lynch. ``We've been doing it since people have been jumping out of
airplanes. It has absolutely nothing to do with the Gulf.''

United States and abroad.

   Oct. 8
   San Antonio Light on the federal budget:
   What a way to run a government!
   Millions of Americans who have to handle family and business
budgets undoubtedly have been shaking their heads and uttering that
comment. ...
   Tourists who have planned vacations for months and traveled
thousands of miles only to find the national parks or government
museums padlocked shut undoubtedly have been saying worse.
   Government employees who literally don't know from day to day
whether to report for work can hardly be expected to bring high
morale to the work place.
   Few can sympathize with a Congress that has known for months
that such tough decisions loomed. With an election one month away,
members of Congress now stand truly accountable before voters - and
those voters are not in a tolerant mood. ...
   This form of government eventually could be at stake if such
antics persists.
   ---
   Oct. 8
   Courier-Post, Hannibal, Mo., on the federal budget:
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., summed up the
crisis situation at the end of the House debate on the revised
budget: ``With all my heart, I believe the country is at stake.
These deficits cannot go on.''
   We believe that Gephardt is right on target with this budget
message.
   Our country's economic future is at stake. It is time to stop
catering to the needs of special-interest groups and concentrate
instead on the good of the nation.
   We believe ... lawmakers must commit themselves to reducing the
federal deficit. Additional taxes may be needed to accomplish this
goal. But more importantly, spending must be reduced.
   This country is in financial peril, and we cannot continue to be
the saviors of the world.
   Voters must put pressure on lawmakers to act in the best
interests of America as a whole.
   Perhaps this election-eve financial crisis is what it will take
to get lawmakers to concentrate on reducing the deficit - and
building an economically stable world for the next generation.
   ---
   Oct. 3
   Argus Observer, Ontario, Ore., on politicians:
   Politicians should have gotten the message by now. Election
years, for some time now, have shown decreasing numbers of the
electorate turning out to vote.
   From the complaints we hear, it isn't that the voters are
satisfied with the status quo. More and more we begin to think that
the voter is discouraged with those whom we send to Washington. ...
   The political bickering is hardly something to instill faith in
the system. Neither of the major parties has really drafted policy
which will cut into the horrendous deficit. A few bright
legislators can see the handwriting on the wall and realize that
this deficit must be curbed - but they are too few.
   Others go blissfully on, voting large raises for themselves and
constituents, handing out dollars for pet projects where their
greatest poitical support is, and not enacting any really
meaningful reform for both social and economic issues.
   The inability of these elected solons to stand up to the issues
is appalling. ... Right now it is hard to determine just what they
are doing to earn salaries four or five (or more) times what most
of us earn, not to mention the ``perks'' which few if any taxpayers
can claim.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on nuclear plants and
cancer:
   The National Cancer Institute examined all deaths from 16 types
of cancer occurring from 1950 to 1984 in 107 counties that are in
close proximity to 62 commercial and defense-related nuclear
facilities across the country. According to John Boice, chief of
the institute's radiation epidemiology branch, the study indicates
there is no evidence of increased risk of cancer among people
living near nuclear power plants.
   These results confirm what most scientific and medical
specialists in the field of nuclear radiation have been saying all
along. While acknowledging that nuclear plants release some
radiation into the atmosphere during operation, they have pointed
out that the amounts are extremely small - less than 5 percent of
the background radiation that people are habitually exposed to from
the natural environment. ...
   The National Cancer Institute is not famous for its pro-nuclear
bias. And no proponent of nuclear energy - within the government or
without - can ever underestimate the primary importance of the
strictest safety standards. So Americans may take some heart from
this report, especially since it comes on the heels of the massive
Columbia University-Audubon Society study that found no evidence of
increased cancer rates attributable to the 1979 accident at the
Three Mile Island nuclear plant.

   Oct. 8
   The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer on cigarette ads:
   When Surgeon General Antonia Novello said ... the tobacco
industry must stop its ``death dealing'' to women and children,
tobacco industry officials huffily said she was wrong to try to
keep cigarette ads away from women. ...
   But the tobacco industry does not target its ads to women like
Antonia Novello. Many cigarette ads are aimed at young, relatively
uneducated women - the women most likely to make uninformed
decisions about smoking and a group still of child-bearing age.
   Lung cancer now kills more women than any other type of cancer.
Although health officials say cigarette smoking is harmful to the
fetus, about 25 percent of the nation's pregnant women smoke
throughout their pregnancies. That smoking causes 4,000 babies to
be born dead each year, the surgeon general said. ...
   People do have the right to decide for themselves whether they
want to smoke cigarettes, but tobacco companies behave like pushers
when they try to exploit the least informed.

consideration of a deficit-reduction plan today after President
Bush backed away from his endorsement of higher taxes on the rich
to pay for a cut in taxes on capital gains.
   ``In view of the apparent reversal of position by the president
last evening, we will now have to reconsider what the appropriate
course of action will be,'' Senate Majority Leader George J.
Mitchell told reporters.
   ``It's obviously a difficult circumstance for all concerned,''
Mitchell said.
   The Finance Committee postponed a morning session scheduled to
begin work on a plan that was to have included the capital-gains
cut long favored by Bush. To meet Democratic demands, the plan also
included higher income tax rates on the wealthy, who would benefit
most from the capital-gains reduction.
   ``We thought until last night that the ... (Finance Committee
plan) would be acceptable,'' Mitchell said.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said in a Senate speech that
news organizations are unfairly portraying Republicans as favoring
the rich. ``Some Democrats are now trying to force us to take
capital gains in order to get more money (to spend) by raising tax
rates,'' Dole said.
   Dole denied that Bush had made any decision Tuesday to drop
support of a deal that would include capital gains and higher
rates. ``He listened to us,'' Dole said, referring to a group of
Republican senators. ``He didn't announce his position at all. He
didn't acquiesce in what we said.''
   But a senior administration official who briefed reporters after
the meeting portrayed it differently.
   The members of Congress, the official said, told Bush that he
wasn't going to get the kind of capital gains he wants, meaning
Congress would not accept a cut in the capital gains tax that would
be low enough to satisfy Bush and would insist on unacceptable
increases in taxes on the rich.
   ``The conclusion was to forget all of it,'' said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``He said, `Fine, we don't
need either one of them.'''
   Other Republicans who attended the session gave yet another
slant.
   ``Our uniform position was that we will not go up on the rates,
no matter what,'' Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon said after he and
other GOP lawmakers met with Bush on Tuesday. The president agreed
with that consensus, added Packwood, the senior Republican on the
Senate Finance Committee.
   ``Stop trying to buy us off with capital gains,'' Sen. Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska, cautioned Democrats.
   The presidential flip-flop - only a few hours after he publicly
said that higher rates on the wealthy would be fine in exchange for
a capital gains cut - clouded attempts to write a $500 billion
deficit-reduction plan.
   Packwood announced Bush's turnabout, which was confirmed by
senior administration officials, at about the time Congress' two
top tax-writers were signaling they were ready to accept the
capital gains bargain as part of a deficit agreement.
   Under terms of a stopgap spending bill that Bush signed Tuesday,
Congress has until Oct. 19 to agree on a deficit plan. Tax-writing
committees in the House and Senate are considering packages that
include increased taxes on gasoline, tobacco and alcohol, a capital
gains cut and higher taxes on the rich.
   Republican senators apparently convinced the president that the
capital gains cut offered by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, was not
good enough to justify the upper-income tax rate increase that
Bentsen wanted.
   Bush's demand to cut taxes on capital gains - the profits from
the sale of investments - has been a bone of contention with
Congress since the 1988 presidential campaign. The president says
the reduction is necessary to stimulate investment and create jobs.
   Democratic leaders have resisted by arguing there is no evidence
the economy would benefit and by hammering away at the fact that 80
percent of the tax cut would go to those with incomes over $100,000
a year.
   At a news conference Tuesday morning, Bush said for the first
time that he could accept higher tax rates on the rich to win a
capital gains reduction. Several Republican lawmakers then arranged
a meeting with the president, and ``we all put up our hands and
said, `No deal on rates at all,''' Packwood recounted. ``He just
acquiesced in it.''
   Bush asked the GOP lawmakers if they would hold fast to such a
position, Packwood said. ``And to the man, in the room, every
single person said we will support that.''
   Capital gains are fully taxed at the same rates that apply to
wages and other income - 15 percent, 28 percent and 33 percent.
   Bentsen's proposal would result in a top rate of 23.1 percent on
capital gains realized by the wealthiest Americans. In return, the
plan would require those highest-income people to pay a top tax
rate of 33 percent, up from the present 28 percent.
   The plan also would raise a special levy called the alternative
minimum tax, which is designed to ensure that high-income people
pay a fair amount of tax regardless of how many legitimate
deductions they have.
   The quick shift of positions by the president and lawmakers from
both parties highlighted the difficulty of giving a special tax
break to one group and trying to pay for it by changing another tax
provision.
   In this case, the problem arises from the fact that fewer than
half of the nation's wealthiest people reported any capital gains
on tax returns filed last year.
   As congressional budget negotiators resumed work on the
deficit-reduction plan Tuesday, lawmakers predicted that a
two-penny tax on home heating oil and a delay in unemployment
benefits - both of which drew widespread objections to the earlier
proposal - are likely to be dropped.
   The impact on Medicare recipients likely will be cushioned,
lawmakers said, but taxes on gasoline, tobacco and alcohol almost
certainly will rise under the new $500 billion plan.

   The Arizona Republic, Phoenix, on the Persian Gulf:
   Predicting the future is a job best left to prophets and gypsy
fortune-tellers. It is a risky business in any circumstance, and is
even more so in the Byzantine world of the Middle East.
   All sorts of fanciful scenarios are being concocted by so-called
``military analysts'' as to how a U.S.-Iraq battle would unfold.
They all end with the U.S. winning a decisive victory with minimal
loss of life.
   The scenarios are all very neat. The good guys win and the bad
guys lose.
   But, of all human activities, war is perhaps the least
predictable. There never was a war that conformed to expectations.
   If war breaks out in Kuwait, this much is certain: it will
develop in directions that are utterly unpredictable. It will not
be neat or surgical or sanitary. It will be what war has always
been: ugly and vicious and more deadly than anyone can imagine.
   No one should be fooled by the glitzy video-game scenarios being
spun by armchair generals and sunshine soldiers. War in the Persian
Gulf would not be a Tom Clancy novel or a Clint Eastwood movie.
William Tecumseh Sherman said ``War is hell'' because that is
precisely what it is.

   The State, Columbia, S.C., on linking Israel to the Persian
Gulf:
   When world leaders go upon a world stage such as the U. N.
General Assembly, they do not as a rule, speak lightly or
intentionally misspeak.
   As he joined the parade of presidents and potentates who kicked
off the current session of the world body's General Assembly,
George Bush quite naturally concentrated on Iraq's Aug. 2 takeover
of Kuwait and its subsequent refusal to leave, even though much of
the world, operating largely with U.N. sanction, has made it
absolutely clear that the Iraqi action is totally unacceptable
conduct that must be reversed.
   During his address, President Bush made this observation: ``In
the aftermath of Iraq's unconditional departure from Kuwait, I
truly believe there may be differences permanently, for the states
of the (Persian) Gulf themselves to build new arrangements for
stability and for all the states and peoples of the region to
settle the conflict that divides the Arabs from Israel.''
   Earlier at the United Nations, French President Francois
Mitterand said if Iraq would ``declare its determination to
withdraw from Kuwait and free the hostages ... all things might be
possible.'' That got a rise out of Iraqi despot Saddam Hussein, who
has been demanding that the Arab-Israeli dispute and the complex
Lebanon question be put on the table with the kidnapping and rape
of Kuwait.
   It does sound like both ... Bush and ... Mitterand might be
willing to make such a linkage one day, and that surely sends
shivers down the spine of Israel. The Arab-Israeli set-to is 42
years old, and the Israeli occupation of Arab territories populated
by Palestinians goes back to the 1967 Six-Day War. The civil war in
Lebanon that has led to partial occupation by Syria dates back to
the mid-1970s.
   Those issues have defied solution despite endless efforts, and
Israel's security concerns are bound up in both. The rape of Kuwait
is a matter of the moment, an international crime of a most
egregious variety that demands solution right now. It was a mistake
to link these matters, even with the ambiguous words of diplomacy
used by the French and American presidents.

   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on the purpose of textbooks:
   For three years, small bands of critics across the United States
have been attacking the textbook series ``Impressions.'' ...
   The books are interesting and colorfully illustrated, and they
challenge students. Tey are a big improvement from the days of
Dick, Jane and Spot and boring reading programs.
   ``Impressions'' appears far more likely than older books to
encourage pupils to learn to read and think. The intent does not
appear to be instilling negative values, as some critics might have
you believe.
   Critics cite passages they claim promote witchcraft, mysticism
and other evils. ...
   Yes, there is fantasy, even tales that could be interpreted as
rebellious or violent. But children's literature has dealt with
such subjects for generations in, for example, ``Little Red Riding
Hood'' and ``Huckleberry Finn.'' ...
   Textbooks should not instill values; that's the responsibility
of parents and churches. Textbooks should instill a sense of wonder
and curiosity. ``Impressions'' has the potential to do that job
well.

   The Meridian (Miss.) Star on education in Japan:
   The Japanese ... feel they have much to learn from the American
education system, but in view of the much-heralded performance of
Japanese students, what can we learn from them?
   The cultural diversity that is one of our strengths also
presents challenges to American educators that the Japanese don't
have to worry about. Secondly, Japan has no American-style
tradition of individualism. The individual is subordinate to the
group in Japanese culture, which makes group learning easier.
   There are other qualities of Japanese culture we could learn
from. Foremost is the absolute priority that is placed on
education. Japanese children go to school more hours a week and
many more days a year than U.S. children. Japanese teachers are
paid on the average 60 percent higher than U.S. teachers. Honor the
profession in tangible ways and it will attract bright and
committed people.
   Ingrained in Japanese parents is the principle that education
matters more than anything else for their children. Family-imposed
standards of educational discipline, as well as heavy parental
involvement in schools, are the norm. Widespread emulation of that
aspect of Japanese culture would probably do more than anything
else to improve U.S. student performance.

   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on U.S. military aid to El
Salvador:
   President Alfredo Christiani of El Salvador did his best to
convince on-the-fence members of Congress recently that he is
indeed calling the shots in his war-torn country, and that progress
is being made in the case of the murder of six Jesuit priests last
year. Fortunately, it looks like no one was fooled. ...
   Cristiani was hoping to convince the lawmakers to reject a
measure that would cut military aid to El Salvador in half.
   Since the civil war began, the United States has sent El
Salvador more than $4.5 billion in military and economic aid. Yet
the war continues to drag on. More than 73,000 people have died.
And the military has been as brazen as ever. There must be a better
way.

   The Milwaukee Journal on female sportswriters:
   A female reporter, Denise Tom, was denied access to the
Cincinnati Bengals' locker room by coach Sam Wyche after a Monday
night game in Seattle. This episode came amidst a furor over a
complaint by Lisa Olson, a Boston sports reporter, that several
naked New England Patriots surrounded her in the team locker room
Sept. 17 and made lewd comments to her while she was conducting
interviews.
   Let it be understood that reporters - male or female - do not go
into locker rooms because they want to, but because that is their
job. Postgame interviews with players and coaches are necessary to
the reporters' stories.
   But some athletes seem to treat locker rooms as personal
playpens. Their immaturity perhaps is understandable, maybe
inevitable. Management pays them millions; groupies and other fans
lionize them; agents pamper them. They spend much of their lives
shielded from responsibility.
   They need a spanking, in the form of a major fine or suspension,
or both. An athlete who exposes himself is guilty not only of
childish behavior, but possibly of an illegality as well.
   As for Wyche, his excuse that he didn't want a woman in a locker
room full of naked men is beside the point. Can't a quarterback or
linebacker put on a towel or a bathrobe for a few minutes and be
interviewed before heading into the shower room? Can't a room be
set aside for post-game interviews?
   No one expects an athlete, physically and mentally exhausted
after a tough game, to show impeccable manners while being peppered
with sometimes tough questions. But no one is demanding perfect
behavior, just common courtesy. If athletes and coaches aren't
capable of that, then they aren't entitled to call themselves
professionals, and they shouldn't be in the NFL with the real men.

   Financial Times, London, on the U.S. budget and economy:
   U.S. budget-making has become a lamentable shambles. Nine months
of negotiation ended in rejection by the Congress last Friday.
True, the proposed $40 billion package of tax increases and
spending cuts was little more than a token gesture. But it was
better than nothing. Even so a hint of higher taxes and reduced
entitlements were too much for nervous congressmen to countenance
in the run-up to November's elections. ...
   The United States may be moving into an era of disappointingly
slow increases in living standards and unpredictable exchange rate
crises. The unprecedented decline of the value of the dollar during
a major international crisis is thus a harbinger of instability to
come.
   Higher national savings are essential if this difficult period
is to be short-lived, a goal to which the elimination of the
structural budget deficit would make a valuable contribution. This
is a vicious circle: voters expect little of politicians and
politicians respond to their cynicism by confirming it. If no one
can break the circle, the voters themselves will pay the price.

   The Bangkok (Thailand) Post on the reunification of Germany:
   There is one Germany again and it seems like the world will be a
better place for it. ...
   The vows of the German leaders to stay a nation at peace sound
more sincere and believable than those of earlier this century. A
world which fought two world wars against the European power has
decided to give the German people a chance once again to decide and
direct their destiny.
   And quite rightly so. Sins of the fathers may not properly be
avenged upon the sons and daughters. The Germany of today is so far
different from that of the past that the field marshals and Hitler
are no doubt spinning in their unmarked graves. It is affluent,
independent and its people are dedicated far more to democracy than
to proving German superiority. ...
   Naturally there are some voices of trepidation among the
congratulations. ... But the lessons of history are for learning
not for enduring. ... The evidence of the past 45 years indicates
that Germans learned these lessons.
   Despite the terrors of those two wars and the memories of some,
the true ``danger'' is not of a resurgence of Hitlerian stupidity.
It is like the ``danger'' of Japan, the enormous economic power of
a vital hard-working nation fuelled by a committed work force. ...
   The world will be watching to see how much added responsibility
Germany is willing to shoulder as the price of its unity.
   The first test comes quickly. European economic unity comes in
1992, and Germany must move fast even before that event, to show
its neighbors and the rest of the world that it will assume
intelligent responsibility as a price for its economic dominance of
Europe. ...
   Much of the world already views European unity as a license to
protectionism. Germany would do well to help ease those fears, and
the sooner the better.

<BYLINE>German Economy Will Continue to Boom, Despite Unification Costs
^By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The German economy will keep picking up steam as
industrial growth slows in other leading nations, the country's
central bank chief said Wednesday.
   However, Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl acknowledged the
Persian Gulf crisis and the costs of unification present formidable
challenges for the economic powerhouse.
   During a speech Wednesday, Poehl outlined how the recently
united country of nearly 78 million people has become ``the
locomotive of growth for the world economy.''
   ``And this role will be further strengthened,'' Poehl added
during his speech to international banking supervisors from about
100 nations.
   He said economic expansion in Germany, which has Europe's
strongest industrial base, comes during ``a situation of clearly
weakening growth in a whole series of important industrialized
nations.''
   Poehl did not name any other countries during his speech in
Frankfurt's St. Paul's Church.
   The area of what was once West Germany is expected to have a 3.9
percent growth in its gross national product this year, the same as
last year. Reliable figures for the ravaged economy in the former
East Germany are not available.
   By way of comparison, the United States expects a growth rate of
only 1.3 percent this year, leading to fears of a recession. Last
year's growth rate was 2.5 percent.
   West Germany's growth rate last year was 2.2 trillion marks
($1.4 trillion at current rates), trailing only the United States
and Japan.
   Also last year, the West German trade surplus was 140 billion
marks ($90 billion at current rates), the highest in the world.
   Poehl sounded several notes of caution Wednesday, including the
enormous expense involved in bringing East Germany's industry up to
Westernstandards.
   Those expenses will add to the national debt, according to
Poehl.
   Poehl said the gulf crisis, which is driving up oil costs,
presents another challenge, but added that inflation in Germany
would stay below 3 percent this year.
   Germans remain extremely wary of inflation, mindful that
skyrocketing prices and the resulting instability led to the rise
of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.
   Inflationary dangers led West German officials in the late 1980s
to resist U.S. calls to become the world's economic engine, the
very role that Poehl has established for the merged nation.
   Also in the late 1980s, officials in Bonn worried that overly
rapid growth would undercut the strength of the West German mark.
   Germany, formally united last week, faces other economic
challenges beyond the gulf crisis and keeping inflation at bay.
   Foreigners have shown a reluctance to invest in what was East
Germany, where problems of land ownership and bloated work forces
have compounded ordinary risks. In addition, many of the businesses
are literally falling apart.
   Nearly 450,000 workers in what was East Germany are out of jobs
and another 1.8 million put in short hours in what amount to
make-work jobs.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl has said the need to keep the German mark
stable and strong will curb financial outlays to rebuild the
economy in the East.
   Elmar Pieroth, an economics expert from Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union, says it may take $775 billion in private
investment and public financing over the next five years.

<HEAD>Bhutto Says Arrest of Husband Meant to Force Her From Race</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested the husband of Benazir
Bhutto on kidnapping charges Wednesday, and the ousted prime
minister called the arrest another effort by the army-backed
government to force her from politics.
   Asif Ali Zardari had been expected to be the main target of the
corruption investigations against Ms. Bhutto's government, which
was ousted in August after just 20 months in power.
   Police arrested Zardari for kidnapping a Pakistani-born British
citizen and extorting $800,000 from him. He was taken into custody
and charged with kidnapping and extortion.
   At a news conference later Wednesday at her home, Ms. Bhutto
said she ``will not be intimiated and blackmailed by these gutter
politicians.''
   ``A few days ago, a federal minister in the caretaker government
came to see me and told me that I should not contest the (Oct. 24
parliamentary) election. If I did, then I would be disqualified and
Asif imprisoned,'' Ms. Bhutto said.
   Zardari was charged in the April kidnapping of businessman
Murtaza Hussain Bukhari of England. Zardari was taken for
interrogation to the Federal Investigation Agency, which is
comparable to the FBI.
   Authorities said he would not be able to apply for bail until
Thursday.
   ``I fear for his safety and his life,'' Ms. Bhutto told
reporters. ``I knew they would do something ... I had warned Asif.
He told me to be brave and continue the struggle.''
   When Bukhari reported the alleged abduction to police and the
British Embassy in Islamabad, he implicated Zardari. He also sent
letters detailing the alleged events to Ms. Bhutto and to President
Ghulam Ishaq Khan.
   Both Zardari and Ms. Bhutto contend the case was fabricated.
   Ms. Bhutto wed Zardari in a highly publicized arranged marriage
in December 1987, exactly a year before she became the first woman
leader of a modern Moslem nation. They have a 2-year-old son and a
9-month-old daughter.
   The president dismissed her government Aug. 6, accusing
officials of corruption, incompetence and abuse of power.
   Supporters and critics alike have blamed Zardari for Ms.
Bhutto's downfall.
   Zardari, an avid polo player with a jet-setter reputation, has
been accused by the Pakistani media and the army-backed caretaker
government of demanding commissions of lucrative government
contracts and using the state-owned banks as his personal fund,
ordering huge loans for friends with little or no collateral and
putting the institutions on the verge of bankruptcy.
   He has vehemently denied the allegations, which earned him the
nickname ``Mr. 10 Percent.''
   Ms. Bhutto is being tried by special one-judge tribunals in
Lahore and Karachi on four charges of misconduct and abuse of
power. She has called the charges a political vendetta aimed at
discrediting her left-leaning Pakistan People's Party and forcing
her to quit politics.

   Slap bracelets may be a new fashion
necessity for chic children but they won't be seen in elementary
schools here since educators decided the fabric-covered steel
ornaments are dangerous.
   The 9-inch bracelets come in wild patterns and bright colors.
They coil around the wrist when slapped against it.
   If the fabric covering comes off, the sharp steel edge could cut
hands and arms, says Joseph Longobardi, principal of the Colonial
and Siwanoy elementary schools. He ordered the ban last week.
Principals at the two other grade schools in this New York City
suburb said they will announce a ban in their school newsletters.
   ``I have four kids of my own,'' Longobardi said. ``I know how
popular these things are. ... But the possibility of injury does
exist because of that sharp cutting edge.''
   In Connecticut, Walgreens pulled slap bracelets from the shelves
of 16 stores Tuesday after a 4-year-old girl was reportedly cut by
one.
   Gene Murtha, president of Main Street Toy of Simsbury, Conn.,
which makes ``The Original Slap Wrap'' and sells it for $2.49, said
his product causes no injuries. The culprits, he said, are cheap
imitations made in Taiwan and sold illegally in this country for as
little as 99 cents.
   ``The metal is inferior, low-grade caliber steel with poor
quality fabric,'' he said of the knockoffs. ``The sealing is also
inferior. The steel can either break through or snap through and
cause injury.''
   His product, which took a year to develop, is made of high-grade
steel with rounded edges and covered by double-knit fabric that is
tightly sealed, he said.
   ``We haven't had any consumer complaints,'' he said.
   Longobardi said he banned the toy after hearing of an injury in
the West Orchard Elementary School in Chappaqua.
   Officials there said an elementary school student who had
removed the material covering needed three stitches on her hand
after she was cut by an exposed bracelet edge.
   Main Street Toy has shipped nearly 1 million of ``The Original
Slap Wraps'' since the fad started this summer. The company is now
shipping about 200,000 of the toys each week.
   A parent's call to Walgreens in Wallingford, Conn., prompted the
district manager to order bracelets that were foreign copies of the
Slap Wrap pulled from all Connecticut stores, said Maryellen
Thielen, corporate spokeswoman for Walgreens in Deerfield, Ill.
   ``We're an extremely conservative company and we do react.
Simply as a precaution, we did remove them from the shelves,'' she
said.
   Nicole Tomaso cut her finger two hours after picking out her
99-cent bracelet at Walgreens, according to Joseph Tomaso, her
father. Tomaso said the metal protruded from the bracelet's sewn
end.

<HEAD>Klaus Gone, But Tropical Storm Marco Forms off the Keys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida faced whipping winds, possible lowland
flooding and up to 3 inches of rain today as a new tropical storm
formed off the Keys, replacing Tropical Storm Klaus.
   Marco, the 13th named tropical storm of the Atlantic hurricane
season that runs from June 1 to Nov. 30., formed west of Key West
early today, the National Hurricane Center said.
   A tropical storm watch was in effect in the Florida Keys from
Dry Tortugas to Key Largo and for the southwest Florida coast from
Key Largo northward to Longboat Key.
   Small craft in the area were warned to stay in port.
   A coastal flood warning remained in effect for all the Florida
Keys, and along Florida's Atlantic coast from Daytona Beach to
Jupiter Inlet. A coastal flood watch also was in effect for the
rest of Florida's east coast and the Georgia coast, the National
Weather Service reported.
   ``You're going to continue to have strong, gusty winds,'' said
Martin Nelson, a meteorologist with the hurricane center in
suburban Coral Gables. ``But the center (of Marco) is forecast to
stay out over the Gulf of Mexico and turn more to the north within
the next day.''
   Marco was expected to gain strength over the next 24 hours,
``but we're not forecasting it to become a hurricane,'' he said.
   At noon EDT, Marco was centered 180 miles south of Tampa, the
hurricane center said. Marco had top sustained winds of 40 mph and
was headed northwest at near 12 mph.
   Marco formed less than a day after Tropical Storm Klaus petered
out over Cuba, leaving behind heavy rains and high seas.
   Klaus left six dead and more than 1,500 homeless on the island
of Martinique on its trek through the Caribbean.

   Pop impresario George Martin said
Wednesday the Beatles might not have become superstars had they
started out in the 1990s.
   He was speaking after presenting the John Lennon songwriting
awards to three students at Salford College of Technology near
Manchester, the day after what would have been Lennon's 50th
birthday.
   ``John was not all that keen on education,'' said Martin, who
was Lennon's producer. ``If he had been around now I don't think
the Beatles would have broken through.''
   Martin described Lennon as ``a rebel who did not want to be
bothered with small details like music and reading and writing. He
wanted to get down to the real nub of things.''
   ``John could not read or write music and I think if he had tried
to get this award in 1990 he would not have stood a chance.''

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Singer-songwriter Paul Overstreet has
been named country music songwriter of the year by Broadcast Music
Inc. for the fourth straight year.
   His compositions during the year included ``Houston Solution,''
``My Arms Stay Open All Night,'' ``All the Fun,'' ``Love Helps
Those'' and ``Sowin' Love.''
   ``Houston Solution'' was recorded by Ronnie Milsap and ``My Arms
Stay Open All Night'' was a hit by Tanya Tucker. Overstreet himself
recorded the latter three songs.
   ``Lots of good things have happened,'' he said Tuesday at the
annual BMI awards dinner. BMI licenses music and collects royalties
for songwriters.
   Don Everly, one-half of the Everly Brothers rock 'n' roll duo,
was honored for writing ``Cathy's Clown,'' which was the most
performed BMI country song of the year. The 1960 song was redone
last year by Reba McEntire.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Former NBC-TV chief Grant Tinker says
television has lost its magic and most people simply regard it as
furniture.
   ``There is nothing wrong with (television) particularly. There
is too much of it. Maybe that is part of what's wrong with it,''
Tinker said in an interview for Thursday's syndicated show
``Personalities.''
   ``There are so many viewing alternatives that there just aren't
enough creative people to supply the software just to feed the
hardware,'' Tinker said. ``I also think we are now living among
people who mostly have never been without television and for whom
it is furniture.
   ``When I was a kid and television arrived, it was magic.''
   Tinker, a TV producer whose company gave viewers ``The Mary
Tyler Moore Show,'' ``Lou Grant'' and ``St. Elsewhere,'' is working
on a CBS-TV dramatic series called ``WIOU.'' He was the NBC
programming chief from 1981 to 1986.

   New York Yankees outfielder Mel Hall is
due in court Oct. 30 on charges of possessing a potentially
dangerous animal - two cougar cubs - and importing a wild animal
without a permit.
   State officials acting on an anonymous tip seized the cubs from
Hall's suburban home in July. Hall was arrested Saturday and given
the court date in Bridgeport Superior Court, said Sgt. Thomas
Daniels of the state Department of Environmental Protection's Law
Enforcement Bureau.
   The year-old male and female cougars were taken to a West
Hartford children's museum, where they were reported in good

<HEAD>Former Communist Politburo Accused of Corruption Cover-Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top body of Poland's former Communist
government learned of a theft and corruption ring in the security
service in 1984 but suspended a criminal investigation, the
government said Wednesday.
   Interior Minister Krzysztof Kozlowski, a former Roman Catholic
journalist who took over the law enforcement department in July,
said there was no proof of individual guilt in the apparent
cover-up, but investigations continue.
   At that time, President Wojciech Jaruzelski was the head of the
then-ruling body, the Communist Party Politburo.
   The disclosures came at a rare news conference held by top
Interior Ministry officials. Most Communist officials have left the
agency in the year since the non-Communist Solidarity government
took power.
   Former Interior Minister Miroslaw Milewski and six former
associates were arrested Saturday on charges they were involved in
the corruption ring. Milewski, a hard-liner, was a Communist Party
Politburo member and Central Committee secretary in charge of
internal affairs in the early 1980s.
   The case will be the first major prosecution of a Communist
official by the country's new authorities.
   Also Saturday, two former police generals were arrested on
charges of directing the murder of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, a
pro-Solidarity priest beaten and drowned by secret police in
October 1984.
   The Milewski case, code-named The Iron Affair, involved people
of Polish origin establishing companies in the West, said Andrzej
Milczanowski, chief of the State Protection Office.
   Through insurance fraud, break-ins and thefts carried out in the
unidentified Western countries, the companies accumulated gold,
precious stones, jewelery and other valuables that would be shipped
back to Poland by intelligence agents, he said. Milczanowski said
the crimes began in 1968.
   At a minimum the perpetrators gathered 143 pounds of gold, he
said. That would be about 2,090 troy ounces, worth $820,000 at
today's prices.
   Milewski was accused of accepting gold and jewelry stolen by the
ring.
   The arrest of Milewski and his associates, whose names have not
been disclosed, stems from a 1984 investigation into the affair by
an internal Interior Ministry commission, Milczanowski said.
   The commission assembled a report of several dozen pages and
said the case should be prosecuted, he said.
   However, the country's then ``highest decision-making body''
decided to suspend the case, and no further action was taken.
Milewski soon retired.
   Kozlowski said the suspension of criminal proceedings was a
decision of the Communist Party politburo, but that there was no
evidence to link any individual with a cover-up.
   ``Those involved, people who were under very serious
accusations, received party reprimands and ... Milewski ended his
political career a few months later,'' Kozlowski said.
   Jaruzelski, who is due to step down in December after the
country's first popular presidential vote, headed the Politburo
from 1981 until assuming the presidency in July 1989.
   Milczanowski said he was not at liberty to release the names of
the others arrested with Milewski without the prosecutor general's
permission.
   However, he said, no one from current political life was
recommended for prosecution.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III on
Wednesday released assurances from Israel that it would not settle
Soviet Jewish refugees on land won in the 1967 Mideast war.
   The assurances were in a letter Baker worked out with Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy to end weeks of negotiations between
the two governments over a $400 million U.S. housing loan
guarantee.
   Baker, in announcing the agreement he had reached with Levy,
said last Week that the foreign minister had offered assurances
``considerably beyond'' Israel's longstanding commitment not to use
the U.S.-backed loans to house Soviet Jews in the territories.
   But the letter did not appear to break new ground, and Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Sunday that the assurances did not
cover Jerusalem. He announced, meanwhile, that a new Jewish
neighborhood will be built in the part of the city Jordan held from
1948 until 1967 and termed by President Bush as ``occupied
territory.''
   The Bush administration considers settlement of Soviet refugees
or any other Jews on the West Bank, in Gaza and in East Jerusalem
to be an obstacle to peace. The administration supports the Arab
demand that most or all of the territory be relinquished by Israel.
   Shamir has offered to negotiate the territory's future after
five years of limited self-rule by the Palestinian Arabs who make
up most of the population of the West Bank and Gaza.
   But he does not consider the capital to be occupied territory
and said Sunday that ``Jerusalem is an integral part of Israel, and
the building of the city will continue unhampered.''
   A strong Jewish presence on the West Bank and in Gaza could make
surrender of the land more difficult. However, former Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin agreed in 1978 to the elimination of all
Jewish settlements in Sinai as part of a peace treaty with Egypt.
   Levy in the letter states ``the government of Israel's policy is
not to direct or settle Soviet Jews beyond the green line,'' which
delineates the boundaries of Israel before the 1967 war.
   The foreign minister does not specifically mention East
Jerusalem, which was not part of Israel before the war.
   The two other main assurances:
   -The housing loan guarantees will be restricted to the
geographic areas administered by Israel before the war.
   -No special incentives are given to encourage Soviet Jews to
settle in territories captured during the war.
   The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said
Tuesday that Baker and Levy had agreed in their negotiations that
the letter would be made public. She declined to take questions
Wednesday on the contents.
   About 90,000 Jews now live among the 1.5 million Arabs on the
West Bank and in Gaza. Only a tiny percentage, 1 to 2 percent, of
Soviet Jewish refugees are among them.

   Minnie the Cow is trading her quiet
southwestern Minnesota barnyard for stardom at Walt Disney World,
all because she was born with markings that resemble a certain
famous rodent.
   ``The whole thing is nothing but foolishness - a cow with Mickey
Mouse on the side,'' said owner Melvin Brockberg, 65.
   ``She's going to live the luxurious life,'' said Brockberg, who
has owned the cow with his wife, Dorothy, and son Bill. ``I
understand she'll be visited by 30,000 plus people a day.''
   Minnie leaves Sunday for the Orlando, Fla., amusement park.
Disney World spokeswoman Jenne Hess said the cow will be among the
featured animals at the park's petting zoo.
   Minnie is a Holstein whose big black markings on her otherwise
all-white left side resemble Mickey Mouse's head and ears.
   Two years ago, Melvin and Dorothy Brockberg's niece, Jody Kline
of Minneapolis, started a letter-writing campaign and sent pictures
of Minnie to both Disney World and Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif.
   Last month, Disney World officials contacted Kline about buying
Minnie. Brockberg would say only the family got a good deal.
   The markings on Minnie, now 4 years old, were visible at birth.
   ``That was just one of those things that happens - a
phenomenon,'' said Brockberg. ``I've seen thousands of cows in my
live - that's the only one I've seen like that.''
   The markings have always proved lucky for Minnie.
   ``She's not a top producer'' of milk, Brockberg said. ``At
different times we've talked about hauling her off to market, but
she'd turn around and we see the spots. The spots saved her.''

<HEAD>University Wants to Burn Radioactive Dog Carcasses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For years, University of Iowa researchers
have injected hundreds of dogs with radioactive isotopes in the
quest to improve human health. Now it's time to dispose of the
carcasses because storage capacity is full.
   A plan to use a refurbished, 25-year-old incinerator to burn 900
barrels of the slightly radioactive carcasses has angered
environmental groups. They want a public hearing to assess the
risks that may be associated with spewing radioactive ash into the
Iowa countryside.
   ``It is the best way right now to do this. We can't think of a
better, safer way to do it,'' said William Twaler. He is director
of the university's Health Protection Office and will oversee the
incineration.
   ``We anticipate most of the radioactive material will stay in
the ash, probably about 85 percent and maybe even 100 percent. It's
not very precise,'' said Twaler.
   ``We don't anticipate the majority of it going up the smoke
stack in the first place. ... But if you're asking me if there's a
zero percent risk, I'd have to say I don't know.''
   Environmental Advocates and Iowans for Animal Rights want a
hearing before any of the more than 1,000 carcasses are
incinerated. Their request in a letter Sept. 28 to university
president Hunter Rawlings has gone unanswered.
   ``Our main concern is that the public is not involved in the
whole process. There's been no public discussion about the
operation. We have questions about the ash disposal, how
radioactive will this ash be?'' said Joe Bolkcom of Iowa City, a
spokesman for Environmental Advocates.
   Twaler said he has had no word from university officials about a
hearing and plans to start incinerating about eight barrels a day
later this week on the Oakdale campus, a few miles northwest of the
downtown campus.
   He would not give the exact ay, saying he feared protests. The
state-run university has received the necessary permits to operate
the incinerator from the Iowa Department of Health and the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources.
   Paul Connett, professor of chemistry at St. Lawrence University
in Canton, N.Y., and author of a weekly newsletter called, ``Waste
Not,'' said he fears any radioactive ash released from the
incinerator would enter the food chain, settling on plants fed to
cows and contaminating their milk.
   He was in Iowa City last weekend for a medical waste management
conference.
   ``It's a stupid idea. It never ceases to amaze me how
incinerator advocates resemble the Medieval alchemists in their
ideas that you could somehow burn something and make it
disappear,'' said Brian Lipsett, a research analyst for the
Citizens Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste in Arlington, Va.
   ``Radioactive materials aren't destroyed by incineration and in
fact will be dispersed throughout the community,'' Lipsett said.
   Paul Cooper, university veterinarian in charge of animal care,
said live dogs were injected with tiny pellets, or microspheres,
containing low-level radioactive materials.
   The microspheres are primarily used as tracers in the dogs'
blood streams for cardiovascular research designed to improve human
health, he said.
   After the dogs died, the school planned to store their carcasses
until the radioactive isotopes decayed in non-radioactive elements,
in about three years. However, researchers have begun using new
isotopes that take longer to decay and the university is out of
storage space.
   ``The quantity of the radioactive material is very, very low to
begin with,'' said Don Flater, chief of the radiological bureau of
the Iowa Health Department. ``Nature has already taken its course.
Most of the radioactive isotopes have decayed and are mostly
gone.''
   A better alternative to incineration would be burying the
barrels, but Flater said that is illegal in Iowa.
   The university could avoid the controversy by shipping the
carcasses to one of the nation's three radioactive waste dumps, in
Washington state, Nevada or South Carolina, Twaler said.
   ``That would be cost prohibitive. It would be something like
$1,000 per drum. That gets very expensive,'' he said.

<HEAD>World's Coastal Cities Face Catastrophic Flooding, Storms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miami is living on borrowed time, New Orleans'
future looks bleak and the world's coastal cities face a growing
risk of catastrophic storms and floods as sea levels rise from
global warming, a report warned Wednesday.
   Global warming is projected to cause sea levels to rise 12
inches to more than 3 feet over the next century, according to
scientists with the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
   But even without global warming, many of the world's most
beautiful and populous cities face an increasing threat of
flooding, according to ``Cities at Risk,'' prepared by three
scientists at the University of East Anglia.
   ``This report puts a whole lot of things together that have been
done on an isolated or ad hoc basis,'' said Allen Miller, executive
director for the Center for Global Change at the University of
Maryland.
   About 500 million people around the world could be affected,
according to the paper, which looked at the future of Miami, New
Orleans, Alexandria, Bangkok, Dhaka, Hamburg, Leningrad, London,
Shanghai, Sydney and Thessalonika.
   ``A variety of human activities are exacerbating existing
problems and increasing the vulnerablity of cities to the future
impact of global warming,'' said Dr. Mick Kelly, who wrote the
report with Dr. R.K. Turner and R.C. Kay.
   Global warming, otherwise known as the greenhouse effect, occurs
as rising levels of carbon dioxide and other pollutants trap the
sun's heat in the atmosphere.
   Inappropriate development and ill-considered flood control
programs contribute to the problems faced by coastal cities. In
addition, land levels are sinking because of erosion or the
extraction of underground water.
   Sea levels, meanwhile, are rising for reasons not fully
understood. An increase of one degree has caused the oceans to
expand, scientists say, while melting glaciers and possibly melting
polar ice-caps have added to the problem.
   Miami faces both erosion and runaway development, much of which
has taken place since the last major storm hit the city in 1966,
the report said.
   Kelly said the city is overdue for a storm and the hazard will
increase substantially in the future as global warming heats the
oceans, which give energy to tropical storms.
   ``These people are living on borrowed time,'' Kelly said.
``Miami has to face not only the possiblity of natural hurricane
activity, but also an increase due to global warming.''
   The report notes that five of Miami's seven bridges to the
mainland are subject to flooding. It suggests that Miami and other
coastal cities pay more attention to emergency planning.
   Miami Beach, built on a barrier island-lagoon, is eroding. So is
an estimated 90 percent of the sandy shoreline of the United
States, the report said.
   Miami already has spent more than $68 million rebuilding the
beach and more money will be needed to save the dozens of hotels
and condominiums built on the ocean front, it said.
   New Orleans is suffering from construction of a different sort -
a half century of flood control projects by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers that have done more harm than good, the report said.
   Levees, reservoirs, floodgates and enlarged channels have been
built to solve specific problems, but together they have
exacerbated flooding.
   The levees killed the deltas by blocking the flow of mud that
replaced soil washed away in the river. The projects helped destroy
the salt marshes that serve as a buffer between the city and the
sea.
   The marshes are dying at a rate of 40 square miles a year,
according to Jim Titus of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
   The report warned: ``Some parts of New Orleans are now nine
meters (yards) below peak river flow. A disaster is waiting to
happen.''
   Bangladesh, meanwhile, is considering a $10 billion flood
control system financed by the World Bank, which environmentalists
fear could create more problems than it solves.
   ``There is a growing body of opinion that this sort of
engineering offers only a short-term respite,'' Kelly said.
``Ultimately the thing we should be doing is limiting greenhouse
gases. But in the short-term, we will need to improve our coastal
defenses. And we need to start now.''
   Basic protection of cities at greatest risk would cost more than
$100 billion, while $500 billion may be required for coastal
defense and flood protection works worldwide, the report said.
   The report was published by the Bureau of National Affairs
International, a subsidiary of the Washington-based Bureau of
National Affairs, Inc., a publisher of environmental, business and
regulatory information.

   Shuttle Discovery sailed
out of orbit and landed Wednesday after a four-day flight that
boosted NASA's confidence and sent a spacecraft on a five-year
mission to explore the sun's poles.
   ``If you criticize our mistakes, then you must also acknowledge
our successes,'' space shuttle director and former astronaut Robert
Crippen said after completion of the first shuttle flight in nearly
six months.
   ``I'm elated,'' he added. ``It's been a long hot summer, I'll
tell you that. It's nice to be back flying again. It is a high day
for us.''
   About 5,500 spectators cheered as Discovery touched down at 6:57
a.m. PDT, just seconds before the sun rose over hills to the east.
It was the third smallest crowd for any shuttle landing open to
public viewing.
   ``Congratulations on a picture-perfect mission,'' Mission
Control's Brian Duffy told the five astronauts.
   The astronauts stepped out of the shuttle into sunshine an hour
after the landing. About four hours later, shuttle commander Dick
Richards was given a small gold model of Ulysses. Then Richards,
pilot Robert Cabana and mission specialists Bill Shepherd, Bruce
Melnick and Tom Akers boarded two jets to take them home to
Houston.
   Discovery's 1.7 million-mile flight was the first since April -
the longest gap between shuttle missions since they resumed after
the 1986 explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed seven crew
members.
   The latest flight helped bolster morale at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, which has been plagued by
hydrogen fuel leaks in the shuttles Columbia and Atlantis and by a
flawed mirror that severely impaired the $1.5 billion Hubble Space
Telescope.
   ``Like any great team, occasionally there's losing streaks,''
Richards said before flying to Houston. ``Today is a day we can say
this losing streak is over and we're going on to great things in
the future.''
   Six hours after they lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on
Saturday, Discovery's astronauts deployed the Ulysses spacecraft on
its 1.86-billion-mile mission to study the sun's high latitudes and
poles.
   Ulysses ``seems to be working perfectly well,'' said Roger
Bonnet, director of scientific programs for the European Space
Agency, which operates the $250 million solar explorer in a joint
mission with NASA.
   Bonnet praised the $750 million mission as ``a symbol of future
cooperation between Europe and the United States.''
   About an hour before touchdown, Discovery's twin braking rockets
fired, allowing the shuttle to plunge out of orbit and dash through
Earth's atmosphere.
   The shuttle's twin sonic booms cracked loudly, waking Santa
Barbara and Ventura residents as Discovery crossed the coast and
descended toward the 15,000-foot-long concrete runway 22 on Rogers
Dry Lake in the Mojave Desert.
   ``I thought someone was rattling the walls in the next room,''
said Ventura County fire dispatcher Denis Miller.
   ``That's gorgeous!'' spectator Valeri Leahey, 29, of Camarillo,
said as sunlight glistened off the descending shuttle.
   Discovery touched down on pavement so NASA could test its brakes
- a test aimed at eventually having shuttles land at Cape
Canaveral.
   Crippen said Discovery's brakes apparently performed well, only
the second test for the new carbon brakes, but he won't decide
until spring when to have shuttles land in Florida. Discovery
sustained only a few ``dings'' to its heat-shielding tiles, he
added.
   Ulysses was 3.1 million miles from Earth on Wednesday, speeding
at 25,451 mph toward a February 1992 swing past Jupiter, said Don
Meyer, NASA's operations manager for Ulysses at Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena.
   The spacecraft will use the solar system's largest planet as a
``gravity slingshot'' to become the first spacecraft to fly
perpendicular to the plane in which the planets orbit the sun.
   That will allow Ulysses to pass over the sun's south pole in
1994 and north pole in 1995, gathering information about the sun,
its magnetic field and the solar wind - all of which affect Earth's
climate.
   Bonnet said Ulysses left Earth's orbit at a faster speed - about
34,000 mph - than any other spacecraft. But it will not become the
fastest spacecraft ever until it reaches Jupiter, where it will
accelerate to about 89,500 mph. Voyager 2 zoomed past the outer
planets at speeds exceeding 80,000 mph.
   The next shuttle flight is scheduled for early November, when
Atlantis will conduct a secret mission for the Pentagon. The flight
had been scheduled for July, but was delayed by hydrogen leaks.
   In addition to deploying Ulysses, Discovery's astronauts tested
a voice-activated camera system and started a small fire inside a
sealed aluminum container so safety managers could observe how fire
acts in the absence of gravity.
   They also extended Discovery's 50-foot-long robot arm to test
the amount of decay on two pieces of material identical to that
used on the solar panels of a communications satellite stranded in
a uselessly low orbit.
   Intelsat, an organization of countries that owns the
communications satellite, will study the amount of decay and decide
whether it is worth sending astronauts on a rescue mission in 1992.

   An American Airlines DC-10 carrying about
250 Middle East-bound soldiers taxied off the runway at Detroit
Metropolitan Airport after stopping for repairs, a spokesman said
Wednesday.
   Al Becker, a spokesman at the airline's Dallas headquarters,
said the plane got stuck in mud after one wheel went off the
taxiway Tuesday night.
   No injuries were reported. Becker said the soldiers and their
equipment were transferred to another plane, which took off early
Wednesday.
   The plane, chartered by the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, landed at
the suburban Detroit airport after a mechanical problem was
detected in flight, said Becker.
   He wouldn't identify the problem.
   Becker also wouldn't say where the flight originated or where
the troops were from.
   Becker said the plane had been repaired and was taxiing for
takeoff when the accident occurred. The cause was under
investigation.

   A U.S. Air Force jet crashed today in Saudi Arabia, killing both
crew members. It was the third accident involving American military
aircraft in the Persian Gulf region in three days.
   In Iraq, meanwhile, 400 Americans and other foreign captives
signed up for the first U.S.-chartered evacuation flight from Iraq
and Kuwait since Sept. 22. The U.S. flight had been scheduled to
leave from Baghdad later today.
   Most of the 400 were evacuated from Kuwait and were taken by bus
to the Iraqi port of Basra. From there, they had been scheduled to
leave on an Iraqi Airways Boeing-747 for the Iraqi capital.
   While officials in Baghdad said they had departed Basra, in
Washington the State Department said without elaboration late this
afternoon that the plane had not yet left Basra.
   And on the New York Exchange, the Middle East crisis helped push
oil prices briefly to a record $41.15 a barrel today, before
falling back to $40.88 in early trading. That was 48 cents above
Tuesday's close of $40.40, and higher than the previous record
close of $39.54 per barrel on Sept. 27.
   The upward trend has been caused in part by the slayings Monday
of 19 Palestinians in a clash with police in Jerusalem, and Saddam
Hussein's threat to retaliate against Israel.
   On Tuesday, Saddam announced that Iraq had added another missile
to its arsenal, and he said it could be launched ``against the
targets of evil when the day of reckoning comes.''
   He made it clear he was referring to Israel and the U.S.-led
forces sent to Saudi Arabia after Iraqi invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
About 170,000 U.S. forces are deployed in the Persian Gulf region.
   Saddam has repeatedly tried to link the status of Palestinians
in the Israeli-occupied territories with his annexation of Kuwait,
indicating he might withdraw from the emirate if Israel pulls out
of Arab lands seized in 1967.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was quoted today by a
German newspaper in Berlin as saying that the nations in the
Persian Gulf will collapse like ``houses of cards'' if Saddam stays
in power.
   In an interview with the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper, Shamir
was also quoted as saying that the Israelis do not want war, but
are prepared to retaliate if attacked by Iraq.
   Lt. Cmdr. J.D. van Sickle, a U.S. military spokesman, said the
F-111 fighter plane crashed in the ``southern Arabian peninsula''
today while on a training mission and that the incident was under
investigation. The names of the two flyers were withheld pending
notification of relatives.
   Eight Marines are missing in the crash of two helicopters in the
Northern Arabian Sea on Monday. An Air Force F-4 reconnaissance jet
also went down that day, killing both crew members.
   Today, the Navy said that search teams had found no indication
that any of the eight Marines had survived and it halted its
search.
   In addition to those killed in Saudi Arabia, 13 other Air Force
personnel were killed Aug. 29 in a crash of a C-5 jet cargo plane
in Germany. That aircraft was ferrying supplies and equipment to
the Saudi peninsula.
   U.S. officials said, however, that the overall safety record of
U.S. forces in the gulf remains at least as good as it would be for
forces of the same size in the United States.
   In Washington, the State Department said more Americans stranded
in Iraq and Kuwait would be evacuated today. The flight is to
arrive in Raleigh-Durham airport in North Carolina on Thursday
after an overnight stop in London.
   As before, the Americans on board will be limited to women and
children and Americans of Arab ancestry. It was the first
U.S.-organized charter out of the region since Sept. 22, when the
State Department said it would organize no further evacuation
flights.
   Previous evacuation flights have transported about 1,900
Americans out of Iraq and Kuwait. Recent State Department estimates
indicate there are more than 600 Americans stranded in Kuwait and
more than 300 in Iraq.
   American and other Western men are being held in Iraq and
Kuwait, many at strategic Iraqi installations to prevent an attack
by the multinational forces in the Persian Gulf region.
   On Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said
three more American men were recently detained by Iraqi authorities
- two in Iraq and one in Kuwait. Many Westerners are believed still
in hiding to avoid detention, primarily in Kuwait, which Iraq
invaded in a dispute over land, oil and money.
   Besides the Westerners caught in Iraq and Kuwait, thousands of
foreign workers of mostly Arab and Asian descent are stranded in
squalid desert camps along the Jordanian and Turkish borders.

<HEAD>Safety Board Draws Up List Of 18 `Most Wanted' Safety Improvements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Declaring that the time for foot dragging has
ended, federal safety officials issued Wednesday a list of 18
``most wanted'' safety improvements in air, sea and land
transportation.
   The proposed improvements range from development of an
air-collision avoidance system to adoption of state laws permitting
uniformed police officers to confiscate drivers' licenses on the
spot when drivers fail or refuse tests to detect alcohol.
   The National Transportation Safety Board list seeks to spur
movement by regulatory agencies, industries, and state and local
governments to implement recommendations made by the board over the
last two decades.
   ``It's a call to action,'' said Chairman James L. Kolstad. ``Our
most wanted list of recommendations represents some of the biggest
areas for life saving. It is a tool that the safety board is using
to help us get our job done.''
   ``I think on some issues there has been foot dragging,'' he
said, noting that federal rule-making procedures can delay
implementation for five years or more.
   ``We need action now. We hope that everyone will agree that the
issues we have chosen to include in our most wanted list have a
great potential to prevent accidents and save lives.''
   The safety board has no actual enforcement power. It can only
identify possible safety improvements and recommend they be
implemented.
   Kolstad said he believes the highest priority item on the list
is the recommendation for the passage of laws in all states to
permit police officers to seize licenses of drivers who fail or
refuse to take alcohol tests.
   ``That is the single most important way to get drunk drivers off
the road,'' he said.
   Air accidents can be reduced, he said, by developing and
requiring an airborne collision avoidance system - a recommendation
first made in 1969 - and requiring a runway incursion system to
prevent ground accidents.
   The board's other most wanted safety improvements include:
   -Legislation to allow alcohol testing if an operator of a
recreational boat is suspected of being intoxicated.
   -Implementation of a recommendation first issued in 1970 to
require railroads to install signal and control systems to keep
trains separated and prevent collisions.
   -Require commuter aircraft to carry ground proximity warning
devices.
   -Make sweeping improvements in fishing vessel safety, including
legislative authority to require the licensing of captains and the
installation of basic lifesaving gear, including exposure suits in
cold waters, flooding detection and fire detection alarms, Coast
Guard-approved lifeboats or rafts, and emergency radios with an
independent power source.
   -Require the screening of all commercial pilots to identify
convicted alcohol and drug abusers, require periodic reviews of
pilots' driver history records, and require airlines to report
pilots convicted as drug and alcohol abusers to the Federal
Aviation Administration for medical evaluation.
   -Require improvements in railway tank car safety.
   -Consider requiring adjustable seat belts in new cars to make
them suitable and safe for children.
   -Speed up research to learn the effects of fatigue, sleepiness
and sleep disorders on safety in all areas of transportation.
   -Adopt new standards to incorporate materials in new school
buses which will slow the spread of fire.
   -Improve fire safety standards on passenger vessels, including
automatic devices to close doors when smoke detectors are
activated.
   -Adopt uniform regulations for drug and alcohol testing of all
transportation employees responsible for operations and safety.
   -Require wear limits for airplane wheel brakes.
   -Improve the safety of heavy commercial trucks by detecting and
preventing drug and alcohol abuse, imposing medical standards and
dealing with driver fatigue.
   -Encourage the installation of excess flow valves in natural gas
service lines to prevent explosions.
   -Require that all new turbojet transport planes receive full
scale structural testing.
   The safety board has made 8,200 accident-prevention
recommendations since it was founded in 1968. Kolstad said 81
percent have been adopted, but 1,800, including some of the most
troublesome safety issues before the board, have not.

   A small crowd of space
enthusiasts, bundled against the numbing desert chill, cheered the
first space shuttle landing in nearly six months.
   Discovery's dawn touchdown Wednesday drew about 5,500
spectators, the third-smallest crowd for a landing open to the
public. But those who braved the 38-degree cold were determined,
some visiting from as far as England.
   The smallest crowd for a public shuttle landing at Edwards was
2,200 when Columbia landed Jan. 20, 1990. Top attendance was
500,000 when Columbia landed on July 4, 1982. Some landings have
been closed to the public.
   Scattered shouts of ``It's here!'' and ``There it is!'' were
heard as the signature twin sonic booms broke the silence of the
Mojave Desert morning.
   Gasps were heard on the east shore of Rogers Dry Lake as the
sunrise glinted behind the descending shuttle.
   ``That's gorgeous,'' said Valeri Leahey, 29, of Camarillo, who
said it was her ninth shuttle landing.
   ``I wanted to come out and see this myself. It's my once in a
lifetime chance,'' said Bruce McLean, 23, of Essex, England.
   Scattered applause and whoops rose into the air when the shuttle
curved over the crowd and gently set down at 6:57 a.m.
   Air Force spokeswoman Michelle Orosco said the crowd may have
been small because it was a early morning, midweek landing.
   Teacher Mark Walker brought 33 of his sixth-grade, gifted-class
pupils from Briggs Fundamental School in Chino. They camped in
sleeping bags and lawn chairs overnight.
   ``We wanted to be here to see the shuttle have a safe landing,
but most important is to see our space program continue,'' Walker
said. ``It's important that even in the midst of financial crisis
and crisis in the Persian Gulf to see the program continue, and
continue to promise for these kids.''
   There also were skeptics, including Barry Dugan, on vacation
with wife and two daughters from Williamsburg, Va.
   ``Nothing's going to get it on the right track until they make
it an adventure again like the Chuck Yeager (first supersonic
flight), when they did it for the sheer fun of it. Now it's just
big money and big bureaucracy,'' he said.
   Discovery carried the European Space Agency's $250 million
Ulysses spacecraft into orbit and launched it on a five-year
journey to explore the sun's poles.

   Former Mayor Jane Byrne says she'll hit the
campaign trail again in 1991 for another run for City Hall.
   Byrne said Tuesday that she has begun circulating nominating
petitions. ``We are absolutely having no difficulty getting
signatures,'' she said.
   Byrne was elected mayor in 1979 but lost a re-election bid in
the 1983 Democratic primary to Harold Washington.
   Washington, the city's first black mayor, also foiled Byrne's
comeback bid in the 1987 primary.
   Mayor Richard M. Daley, elected in 1989 after Washington died,
is expected to seek a full four-year term in 1991.
   ``Anybody can run for mayor,'' Daley said of Byrne's decision.

<HEAD>Stand Firm Behind Budget Deal, Bush Urges Republicans </HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Budget-Taxes, Bjt</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note grafs 13-16, In Atlanta, FOR RELEASE 7:05 p.m. EDT.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush urged Republicans to
``stand firm for the best budget deal possible'' as he campaigned
for Southern GOP candidates Wednesday, dismissing differences with
one of them on that very issue.
   The president said he wielded the appropriations veto that led
to a partial government shutdown because Congress would otherwise
have taken last weekend off.
   ``I kept the pressure on, and to make the point - no more
business as usual,'' Bush told a rally for Florida Gov. Bob
Martinez at a sweltering waterfront park.
   Bush left a mixed message on taxes as he went in quest of votes
for Republican candidates. He had said Tuesday that he'd consider
an increase in the highest income tax rates in exchange for a
capital gains tax cut, then met withRepublican senators who said
he'd dropped that idea. But, on Wednesday, Bush's spokesman said
the president had only listened to the senators and hadn't told
them anything.
   The budget message was a theme of his three-stop swing. ``Let's
get the job done, members of Congress,'' he said in St. Petersburg.
``I didn't come down here to assign blame, but you know, I've seen
these surveys. The American people are pretty smart. They know
where the action is. And they know that Congress has the
responsibility to pass a budget. And it's about time that they met
that responsibility.''
   Bush said in Raleigh, N.C., that if the rest of Congress were as
careful with federal spending as Sen. Jesse Helms, there wouldn't
be a budget crisis to begin with.
   Helms denounced one budget deal Bush endorsed and voted against
a temporary settlement the Senate finally approved to avert a
government shutdown Tuesday.
   ``Of course there are going to be differences,'' Bush said at a
campaign breakfast for Helms, who is seeking a fourth Senate term
against former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt in a race the pollsters
now see as a tossup.
   The president said differences with Helms ``on one issue or
another'' were beside the point.
   ``The point is that if we had more senators like him, we
wouldn't be trying to solve some of these problems that should have
been solved months ago, years ago,'' Bush said.
   Republican defections, especially in the House, have been a
major problem for the president and congressional leaders in trying
to strike a budget deal to cut the deficit by $40 billion this year
and by a total of $500 billion over the next five years.
   Bush's final campaign stop of the day was in Atlanta, home
territory of Rep. Newt Gingrich, the leader of conservatives who
rebelled against the budget deal. The president was appearing there
to raise campaign funds for Johnny Isakson, the Republican
candidate for governor of Georgia. He is rated a long shot against
Democratic Lt. Gov. Zell Miller.

<TEXT>
   
   In Atlanta, Bush again discussed the budget at a fund-raising
reception for Isakson.
   ``Right now, the federal budget process is like a huge Rube
Goldberg machine, out of control - producing noise, smoke, heat and
no light,'' Bush said. ``Sucking up more and more tax dollars on
one end and churning them into spending programs without end.''
   But he said he is confident Congress can pass a sound budget.
   ``We've had a few days now for the smoke to clear,'' Bush said.
``Now it's time to move forward.''

   In St. Petersburg, Bush sought money and votes for Martinez,
bidding for reelection in a close contest with Democrat Lawton
Chiles, a former senator looking for a comeback.
   It was the president's first campaign foray since the budget
crisis that led to a partial shutdown of federal facilities and
threatened more, a standoff resolved temporarily with government
spending authority extended until Oct. 19.
   Bush demanded that the Democratic Congress ``make the hard
choices and real reductions'' in spending that would produce a
permanent settlement he'd accept. ``I will continue now to press
hard for a budget that fulfills the spirit of that bipartisan plan
and proves to the American people once and for all that we can deal
with this deficit,'' he said. ``We've got to turn it around now.''
He said he is dead serious about the deadline 10 days away.

   With a smirk on her face, a lone Soviet activist
nearly caused a riot a block from the Kremlin on Wednesday by
tossing hard-to-find condoms into the air and demanding that
prostitution be legalized.
   ``We want to draw attention to the problem of prostitutes,
because they have no legal protection and because they are the
objects of sexual abuse,'' declared Yevgenia Debryanskaya, a member
of the fledgling Libertarian Party. ``Nor are they protected
medically,'' she said.
   Many in the crowd of more than 100 people, including many Soviet
journalists, shrieked and grabbed for the hundreds of American-made
condoms she scattered on the ground in front of the Intourist
Hotel, one of Moscow's best-known workplaces for prostitutes.
   Passers-by stopped in amazement and several joined in the
scramble on one of Moscow's main thoroughfares.
   Defying the usually prudish Soviet attitude toward sex, Ms.
Debryanskaya also tossed a stack of English-language manuals on
safe sex into the air, and the wind swept them across the sidewalk
in the direction of the Kremlin.
   Condoms, like many consumer goods, have never been plentiful in
the Soviet Union. Soviet-made condoms are notorious for their poor
quality and undependability. Western condoms sell for as much as
the equivalent of $8 on the black market.
   Wednesday's protest also demonstrated the length to which groups
will go to stand out among the growing number of Soviet political
organizations, and the extent to which once-banned activities are
now tolerated. Although a half-dozen police were present at the
unauthorized protest, they made no effort to intervene other than
keeping the sidewalk clear.
   Ms. Debyranskaya said the Liberation Party wanted the repeal of
a law that punishes prostitution with fines as well as free medical
care for prostitutes.
   She said prostitutes ``do not even have the most elementary
contraception devices - condoms. And in the age when AIDS is
spreading, they are particularly liable to infection.''
   At one point, two other protesters unfurled a hand-written
banner depicting a submarine and reading: ``One nuclear submarine
equals (the cost of) 5 billion condoms.'' Another sign read: ``A
sexual blockade on members of the Communist Party.''
   Soviet officials have been slow to acknowledge the spread of
AIDS, which can be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous
drug use or passed from an infected mother to her fetus.
   In 1989, several cases were reported of babies being infected
with AIDS through the use of contaminated hypodermic needles in
Soviet hospitals. Although Soviet health officials have begun
publicly discussing ways to treat those infected with AIDS,
statistics for the number of infected Soviets are not available.
   There are also no official figures on the number of Soviet
prostitutes, although they do a brisk trade at hotels catering to
foreigners and at train stations.

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Stewart Bell, a British theorhetical
scientist who pointed to an answer to one of the basic questions of
his science, has died. He was 62.
   He died last week at a Geneva hospital after suffering a stroke,
the European Laboratory for Particle Physics said.
   Bell, born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, had worked since 1960
at the 15-nation lab, located outside this Swiss city and known by
its former French acronym CERN.
   The lab's director, Nobel laureate Carlo Rubbia of Italy, cited
Bell's ``imposing contribution to physics'' which he said ``did
much ... to unravel the paradoxes which riddle quantum theory
....''
   Quantum physics is based on the theory that energy is
transmitted in definable units rather than constant streams.
   Bell was best known for 1964 research in which he postulated how
simultaneous measurements on separate physical systems can be
linked. Testing of ``Bell's Theorem'' or ``Bell's Inequality''
seems to have shown that the apparent coordination of particles
that have flown too far apart for normal communication arises from
the action of the measurement.
   The tests appear to have resolved a basic question of physics:
Is there a message within the basic particles that determines their
behavior?
   Bell is survived by his wife Mary, who collaborated on some of
his research and also works at the lab.

   Republican gubernatorial candidate Dave
Frohnmayer says he fired his advertising agency because his
campaign had gotten too negative.
   Frohnmayer, the state attorney general, also offered to hold a
fifth public debate with Democrat Barbara Roberts, who has pulled
even with Frohnmayer in the polls.
   Roberts, the secretary of state, dismissed the moves as
desperation tactics by a candidate who is ``running scared.''
   Frohnmayer's debate offer came as he and Roberts held what was
supposed to be their fourth and final debate Tuesday night.
   Earlier, Frohnmayer's campaign announced it had fired an ad
agency because its campaign ads were too negative. Frohnmayer said
he felt he wasn't coming across well.
   ``The ads were accurate, but there was a certain amount of
stridency,'' he said.
   Frohnmayer said future ads would be upbeat and focus on his
record.
   ``Let's look for the higher ground,'' he said. ``That's my plan
for the next 28 days.''
   Roberts said Frohnmayer's call for a more positive campaign was
ironic in view of the negative ads he's been running, portraying
her as soft on crime.
   ``He's been running negative ads all summer. It's a little late
for the high ground,'' Roberts said.

<HEAD>Pence Calls Sharp `Environmental Hypocrite' in Possible Farm Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Phil Sharp says he has no role in the
proposed sale of his family's Illinois farm as a planned nuclear
waste dump.
   The Indiana Democrat was criticized as ``an environmental
hypocrite'' by Republican Mike Pence, who is trying to unseat Sharp
in the November election.
   ``For Phil Sharp to decry my commitment to the family farms of
this district, and at the same time to sell his family farm for a
nuclear waste site, is just unbelievable,'' Pence said.
   The Illinois Department of Nuclear Safety wants to put a
low-level nuclear waste dump near Martinsville, Ill. The Sharp
family farm is one of several parcels Illinois wants to buy to
create the dump.
   Sharp said Tuesday that he has no say in selling the farm.
   ``That is just ridiculous. I am not an owner of the property,''
he said. ``I'm neither trying to accelerate the sale or stop it. I
am staying away from it, as I should.''
   The 175-acre farm belonged to Sharp's father, Riley Sharp, who
died in 1985. In his will, Riley Sharp named his wife, Martha
Sharp, and Phil Reeds, who leases the property from her, as the
property's trustees.

<HEAD>Oil-Eating Bacteria Called Promising, Some Express Doubts About
Safety</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil-eating bacteria worked when sprayed on a
sensitive marsh fouled by a July oil spill, proponents say, but
some scientists say they're still worried about the safety of the
cleanup technique.
   Speaking at a symposium on bioremediation at Lamar University in
Beaumont, proponents of the technique reported that microbe-treated
areas of Morrow Marsh, on Galveston Bay, were largely free of oil a
month after the spill.
   Franz Hiebert, director of geoscience programs for Alpha
Environmental Inc., said researchers ``found a wide variety of
fishes swimming in and out of the marsh'' in the northern reaches
of the bay near Cedar Bayou.
   Hiebert's company sprayed the oil-eating bacteria in the marsh
and other areas of Galveston Bay fouled by 700,000 gallons of oil
that spilled when a tanker collided with oil barges in the Houston
Ship Channel.
   The bacteria also were used in June, after the supertanker Mega
Borg exploded 57 miles off Galveston.
   Not everyone at Tuesday's conference rallied behind
bioremediation, which has been used for years to treat sewage and
hazardous waste and only recently was used on oil spills.
   Although studies done so far have been ``very encouraging,''
there ``is plenty of research yet to be done,'' said Sarah Liehr of
the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the
University of Houston.
   Among the issues to be resolved is whether phosphorus, nitrogen
and other nutrients mixed with the bacteria to stimulate their
growth will cause algae to bloom or reproduce explosively. Algae
blooms can deplete oxygen in the water.
   Norm Novick, of Mobil Oil Corp.'s Toxicology Department, said
the process clearly works on contaminated soils, sludges and
groundwater. He said it has limited usefulness in cleaning up
heavier petroleum products.
   Novick maintained that in most oil spills ``the organisms you
need (to eat the oil) are already there.'' Evidence suggests that
indigenous bacteria only need stimulation by nutrients to degrade
spilled oil and that additional bacteria aren't needed, he said.
   Texas Water Commission Chairman Buck Wynne III said that during
two recent spills ``the one thing we did show was that
(bioremediation) didn't hurt anything.''
   It cost the state about $90,000 to treat the June and July
spills, he said.
   Wynne expressed doubts that bacteria will be used routinely on
spills until the technology wins the support of the federal
government.

<DATELINE>SHERIDAN, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Rep. William Henry Harrison, a
descendant of two presidents and an opponent of excessive federal
power, has died at age 94.
   Harrison died Monday of heart failure at Palms of Pasadena
Hospital in St. Petersburg, Fla., his winter ome. He will be
buried here Saturday.
   A five-term Republican congressman from Wyoming, Harrison
campaigned in the early 1960s by opposing Kennedy administration
policies. He saw Washington taking more control and direction over
American life and he didn't like it.
   ``This is, in my opinion, a serious detriment and threat to
local and state initiative and control which are at the very
foundation of our freedom and liberty and our free enterprise
system,'' he said in April 1962.
   Politics ran on both sides of his family.
   He was a grandson of President Benjamin Harrison and a
great-great grandson of President William Henry Harrison. His
great-great-great grandfather was another Benjamin Harrison; that
one signed the Declaration of Independence.
   On his mother's side, Harrison was a grandson of Alvin Saunders,
Nebraska's territorial governor during the Civil War and later a
U.S. senator.
   Harrison was born in Terre Haute, Ind., on Aug. 10, 1896. After
earning a law degree he served in the Indiana Legislature, then
moved to Wyoming and eventually won election as a lawmaker here. He
was first elected to Congress in 1950.
   In 1969, President Richard Nixon appointed Harrison to the U.S.
Renegotiation Board, an independent agency that examined contracts
relating to the defense and aerospace programs in an effort to stop
excessive profits.
   Harrison resigned from the board at age 75 and returned to
Wyoming.
   He is survived by his wife, Dorothy, a daughter and a son.

<HEAD>Teamsters President McCarthy Won't Run for Re-Election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teamsters Union President William J. McCarthy,
citing personal reasons, announced Wednesday he will not run for
re-election in next year's government-supervised elections, the
first in which union leaders will be elected directly by the rank
and file.
   A majority of the union's 21-member board quickly backed R.V.
Durham of North Carolina, a Teamsters vice president, to replace
McCarthy. But Jack Cox of Los Angeles, a board member who withheld
his endorsement of Durham, said he may run for the union's
presidency.
   McCarthy, 71, has had a minor stroke and open-heart surgery. He
made the announcement at a union board meeting in West Palm Beach,
Fla.
   A brief statement released by the union's headquarters in
Washington said McCarthy, who succeeded the late Jackie Presser two
years ago, ``has decided for personal reasons not to seek
re-election to the post.''
   Sources within the union, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said there were deep political divisions on the board,
with some factions opposed to McCarthy's running again.
   Cox said he thought that ``more people were beginning to tell
him (McCarthy) the truth, which was that he was losing the touch
and losing control.''
   Durham, a 40-year union veteran from Greensboro, N.C., was named
by 15 of the 21 board members to head the board's slate for next
year's elections, the union said.
   Weldon Mathis, who now has the No. 2 job of secretary-treasurer,
was selected by the board to again run for that post.
   The December 1991 elections, agreed to by the union board last
year as part of the settlement of a massive civil racketeering suit
brought by the Justice Department, will be the first direct,
secret-ballot elections in the Teamsters' 87-year history.
   In past elections, top officers were elected at a convention by
delegates handpicked at the local level. Next year, the 1.6 million
rank-and-file Teamsters will cast secret ballots.
   Ron Carey, a local president in New York who is mounting an
independent campaign for the presidency, is running on a pledge to
clean up the union. He has won the endorsement of the Teamsters for
a Democratic Union, a dissident group that has pushed for union
reform for a decade.
   Ken Paff, a spokesman for the dissident group, said that Durham
is ``not very well known,'' and added that ``in this election,
being well-known is going to work against you.''
   Durham, a former director of the Teamsters' safety and health
department, is the union's freight director. He oversees operations
and negotiations in the freight area, such as contracts covering
union truckers.
   Cox said he would decide by the end of the week whether to
endorse someone else as McCarthy's replacement or run himself.
   ``I might decide to go for the top spot myself,'' Cox said,
adding, ``I listen to people.''

<HEAD>Cavazos Testifies About Student Loan Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos told a
Senate panel Wednesday his department is moving aggressively to
halt fraud, waste and abuse and recover an estimated $7.8 billion
in defaults in the federal student loan program.
   Cavazos said the government collected a record $722.3 million in
defaulted student loans in fiscal year 1990, an increase of about
$79 million over 1989.
   He told a subcommittee of the Senate that ``tough, but
fair-minded'' regulations have recently been implemented.
   ``They go as far as we felt we could go under the law at the
time,'' Cavazos said. ``They are working, but they are not enough.
We need more statutory authority.''
   Cavazos's testimony before the Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations brought to a close a yearlong examination of
problems in federal student financial aid programs.
   Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said the legislative initiatives were
welcome, ``but here's tremendous authority in the Department of
Education that's not been utilized.'' He pointed to numerous times
the department ignored warnings from its Inspector General's Office
of problems within the loan program.
   ``In brief, it is not an exaggeration to say that we have heard
no testimony or seen any documents that suggest the department has
done even an adequate job in managing and overseeing its student
loan program responsibilities,'' Nunn said.
   Nunn asked Cavazos and officials accompanying him why it has
taken years to correct flaws in the program and to update the
agency's computer system so that questionable activities from
unscrupulous trade schools can be detected.
   As an example, Nunn showed documents of a trade school that had
lost accreditation from two licensing agencies. When the same
owners changed the institution's name and moved its location, he
said the department recently approved the accreditation by a third
agency.
   ``The program seems to be just a joke, isn't it?'' Nunn said.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said, ``It is clear that the
current system does not protect students, and it does not protect
taxpayers either. Total federal insurance costs to cover defaults
have increased from $239 million in 1980 to $2.4 billion in 1990.
   ``There will always be some defaults in any loan guarantee
programs. But the amount we are spending now on student loan
defaults is unacceptable.''
   However, Kennedy acknowledged Cavazos had initiated some
improvements.
   Cavazos said the agency has ``dramatically increased'' the
number of on-site reviews of higher education institutions to
determine compliance with student aid regulations. He said 372 were
conducted in fiscal year 1987 but more than 1,200 were carried out
in fiscal year 1990 ending in September.
   Cavazos said the department's successful debt collection
activity includes using private collection agencies, offsetting
federal income tax refunds and collecting from the salaries of
federally employed defaulters.
   Default collections from tax refunds totaled $261 million in
fiscal 1990, with more than 439,000 defaulters paying an average
$610 from federal tax refunds.

   Police fired shotguns and used
nightsticks to break up an opposition demonstration Wednesday and
at least four people died and 200 were injured, police said.
   The demonstrators set ablaze or damaged more than 100 vehicles,
including eight belonging to the United States Information Service,
witnesses said. Opposition leaders said up to six people died in
the clashes.
   After listening to speeches against President Hussain Muhammad
Ershad, slogan-shouting followers burned an effigy of the president
and marched toward the headquarters of Ershad's Jatiya Party in the
Motijheel financial district, the United News of Bangladesh news
agency said.
   Police fired tear gas and used their batons to suppress the
stone-throwing demonstrators. When that failed to stop them, police
opened fire with shotguns, witnesses said. At least 15 people,
including a news photographer, suffered bullet wounds.
   Opposition leader Khaleda Zia said up to six died in the
demonstrations. She showed reporters large bruises on her hands
that she said were the result of police attacks.
   The ``police attack on me and my supporters was absolutely
unprovoked,'' Mrs. Zia said. ``This country is being run by the
worst dictaor in the world.''
   At a separate news conference, another opposition leader, Sheikh
Hasina, said five people were killed in the ``unprovoked firing.''
   Mrs. Zia, head of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, called for a
half-day nationwide general strike to condemn the police action.
   Ershad, who took power in a coup eight years ago and
subsequently was elected president, has said he would allow
elections if the opposition agrees not to boycott the vote. The
opposition wants Ershad to step down and allow a caretaker
government to hold the elections.
   In a speech before the demonstration, Mrs. Zia pledged the
opposition would not rest until the government was ousted and a
free election held in the country.
   Meanwhile, a storm that has claimed the lives of more than 70
fishermen and left about 5,000 missing in the Bay of Bengal
continued to lash the Bangladesh coast Wednesday.
   The Bengali-language daily newspaper Sangram said 350 boats and
trawlers had failed to return to port since the storm hit on
Monday.
   Incessant rains have caused flash floods in much of low-lying
Bangladesh, rendering tens of thousands of people homeless.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday
ordered all major Soviet cities to hold parades Nov. 7 marking the
1917 Bolshevik Revolution, apparently trying to squelch a boycott
called by liberals.
   The presidential decree was Gorbachev's first public response to
the liberal mayors of Moscow and Leningrad, who last month called
for abandoning the traditional Revolution Day celebrations because
the dismal economic situation gave Soviets nothing to celebrate.
Other groups since have supported their call.
   The anniversary of the 1917 revolution is one of the major
holidays on the Soviet calendar, a day usually devoted to praising
the glories of communism. While the official ideology has fallen
from its sacred position in politics in recent years, many
conservatives remain committed to upholding the old system.
   Using his broad executive powers, Gorbachev issued the decree
ordering the date to be observed with military parades in Moscow,
the capitals of the 14 other republics and in other cities where
army or naval fleets are based, the official Tass news agency said.
   Gorbachev also instructed Defense Minister Dimitri Yazov to
review the parade in Red Square in Moscow.
   The parades usually include tanks and rockets, followed by a
``people's demonstration'' of the city's residents.
   May Day, another major Soviet holiday, was marked this year by
counter-demonstrations involving tens of thousands of people in
Moscow. As they passed through Red Square, many shouted ``Resign!''
and jeered at Gorbachev, who suffered the embarrassment stoically
for 20 minutes and then left the reviewing stand.

<TEXT>
   The House passed a bill Wednesday authorizing
the federal government to pay $35 million to the Seneca Nation to
make amends for a century of unfair land leases to the city of
Salamanca, N.Y.
   The legislation passed the House on a voice vote and was headed
to the Senate, where it could be considered before week's end.
   ``We're facing up to reality,'' Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y. and
the bill's sponsor, said on the House floor. ``This nation was
badly treated. Something ought to be done.''
   The measure would ratify an agreement reached by Salamanca and
the Seneca Nation to replace a 99-year lease accord that expires
Feb. 19, 1991. About 85 percent of the city of Salamanca is leased
from the Senecas, at rents that were frozen at rates as low as $1
per year.
   Under the bill, the federal government would pay $35 million to
the tribe to make up for some of its financial losses. The state of
New York must pay $25 million, which will require state
legislation.
   The Bush administration has said it opposes the bill because of
the cost. But Houghton spokesman Mike Hyland says the congressman
has discussed the problem with Interior Secretary Manual Lujan and
believes the bill's chances are good.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man has pleaded guilty to trying to extort
$30,000 from the late Malcolm Forbes by threatening to harm his
reputation.
   George Kenneth Warnock, 25, of the Bronx, had been charged in
July with mailing two threatening letters to Forbes last August and
September and a similar letter to Forbes' son, Malcolm Jr., after
the millionaire publisher died Feb. 24.
   Warnock, in an agreement with prosecutors, pleaded guilty on
Friday to one count of using the mail in an extortion attempt. The
plea was made public Wednesday.
   He faces up to two years in prison and a $250,000 fine when
sentenced Dec. 14 by U.S. District Judge Lawrence M. McKenna.
   The indictment didn't describe the nature of the threats.
   At last week's hearing, Warnock said he sent the first letter in
August asking Forbes to ``give me money or something in return for
the favors, and I think I sent it in a threatening way.''
   He said he never caused or intended to cause any physical harm
to Forbes.
   At the time of the indictment, Forbes magazine attorney Donald
Shaw said in a prepared statement that Warnock had made
``fabricated allegations.''
   Shaw said the family had looked into Warnock's claims and ``our
investigation found that Mr. Warnock ... never even met the late
Malcolm Forbes.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Nancy Northup said Warnock admitted to a
Forbes employee that he had written the letter and asked for
$30,000 in exchange for withholding information that could damage
Forbes' reputation.
   Northup said the Forbes employee, who was not identified, would
have testified had the case gone to trial.

<TEXT>
   Chess players have long used systems of notation
to record the moves of their games and to replay and study games.
   The U.S. Chess Federation says it's necessary to know notation
to play rated chess in tournaments. A written record proves a
player made the required number of moves within the specified time
limit.
   The system known as algebraic notation is most widely used.
   In algebraic notation, the ``ranks'' are the horizontal rows of
squares. The ranks take numbers, 1 to 8, beginning on white's side
of the board.
   The ``files'' are the vertical rows of squares. They take
letters, a through h, beginning on white's left.
   Thus, each square is identified by its file letter and rank
number.
   In the starting position, white's queen knight stands on b1, the
queen on d1, the king on e1; black's queen knight stands on b8, the
queen on d8, the king on e8, and so on.
   Other features of the system follow:
   -DESIGNATION OF PIECES: The major pieces are shown by a capital
letter: K for king, Q for queen, R for rook, B for bishop and N for
knight. No symbol is used for the pawn.
   -MOVES BY PIECES: Shown by the letter of the piece (except for
the pawn) and the destination square. For instance, Bb5 means the
bishop moves to square b5.
   -MOVES BY PAWNS: Since only one pawn can move to a given square
at any time, pawn moves are designated only by the name of the
destination square. Thus, e4 means the pawn on the e file moves to
e4.
   -CASTLING: It is written as 0-0 for the kingside and 0-0-0 for
the queenside. Kingside is the side of the board (right half from
white's point of view, left half from black's), on which each
player's king starts. The other half is queenside.
   -CAPTURES BY PIECES: A capture is recorded using an ``x'' after
the letter for the capturing piece. For instance, if white's bishop
captures the black pawn, it is written Bxf6.
   -CAPTURES BY PAWNS: When a pawn captures something, the players
name the file the pawn was on and the square where it made the
capture. If white's pawn on a g file captured black's pawn, the
move would be gxf6. If black's pawn on an f file captured white's,
it would be fxg5.
   -CHECK: The symbol for check is a plus sign.
   -AMBIGUITY: If more than one piece of the same type can move to
a square, the rank number or file letter of the origination square
is added. Thus, if a rook on d1 were to move to d4, but another
rook also could move there, instead of Rd4 the move would be given
as R1d4 (pronounced ``rook at 1 to d4.'') If there are black
knights on c6 and e6, and the one on e6 moves to d4, the move is
given as Ned4 (``knight at e to d4.'')

   One Marine was killed when he landed
in a river on a night parachute training exercise, and three other
Marines were injured, a base spokesman said Wednesday.
   The body was found Wednesday in the Trent River.
   The cause of the accident Tuesday night hasn't been determined.
   ``There are so many factors involved in this type of training,''
said Capt. Michael Imsick. ``They have to examine all those
factors: gear, environmental conditions, individual Marines
involved, the flight, the location, all those factors.''
   Three other Marines suffered minor injuries when they landed in
woods at a training area that is part of Camp Lejeune, but separate
from the main base, Imsick said.
   The training wasn't in preparation for duty in Saudi Arabia,
another spokesman said.
   The men were among six who jumped from a CH-53 Delta Sea
Stallion helicopter. They were part of the 2nd Air Naval Gunfire
Liaison Company, 2nd Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Intelligence
Group at Camp Lejeune, Imsick said.
   One of the injured was in intensive care Wednesday at the Naval
Hospital at Camp Lejeune with burns suffered when he touched power
lines. Another remained hospitalized with ``minor orthopedic

   Just as a few chosen farmers have done for more
than 1,000 years, Susumu Anai on Wednesday harvested ``sacred''
rice for his emperor to offer the gods in a mystical ritual of
enthronement.
   The harvest, conducted under heavy security, completed the
gathering of rice that Emperor Akihito is to offer to the gods of
Shinto, Japan's native religion, next month.
   But, unlike in times of old when Japan's monarchs were revered
as living gods and Shinto was the national religion, questions have
been raised about the rite's constitutionality and whether it
should be performed.
   Palace and local government officials looked on silently as
Anai, clad in white cotton robes and wearing the type of tall black
hat worn by religious and court officials centuries ago, entered a
talisman-ringed paddy and cut several plants to place on a wooden
altar.
   The hourlong ritual on Japan's southwestern island of Kyushu
followed a similar harvest two weeks ago in Akita, in the
northeast. By tradition, one paddy must be to the west and one to
the east of Kyoto, Japan's former capital.
   ``Having the paddy of my ancestors chosen makes me feel both
honor and the weight of responsibility,'' said Yoichiro Ito, the
Akita farmer whose paddy was used for the rice.
   ``It was rice that I had just grown like the rest,'' Ito said in
a telephone interview. ``As a farmer this is a great honor.''
   Emperor Akihito will offer the rice and several other kinds of
food to the gods in the mystical Daijosai, or ``Great Food Offering
Ritual,'' on Nov. 22-23 after his Nov. 12 coronation.
   Akihito ascended the throne after his father, Hirohito, died in
January last year. His formal enthronement, however, had to await a
one-year mourning period and the growing of rice for the Daijosai.
   After communing with the gods in two halls at the Tokyo Imperial
Palace, Akihito is to sleep with the spirit of the sun goddess
Amaterasu, from whom the imperial line is said to have descended.
   The Daijosai was largely ignored in the 15th and 17th centuries,
but otherwise has been performed regularly for at least 1,200
years.
   Because Akihito will be the first monarch to be enthroned under
Japan's post-World War II constitution, his coronation is under
particularly close scrutiny.
   Nearly 1,000 people are suing Japan's conservative-led
government over plans to provide state funds for the rite, which is
opposed by Christian, Buddhist and intellectual groups.
   Before Japan's surrender to the Allies in 1945, a nationalistic
brand of Shinto had state backing and was used by the government to
rally the people behind the war effort.
   Hirohito renounced the concept of imperial divinity soon after
the war and a new constitution written mainly by U.S. occupation
forces banned government backing of Shinto or any other religion.
   In defending the decision to provide funds, officials have
acknowledged the religious significance of the rite, but stated its
importance as an imperial tradition should take precedence.
   In February, imperial ritualists selected the location of the
two sacred paddies by heating turtle shells over charcoal until
they cracked, and then using the cracks to divine where the proper
paddies would be found.
   Only the names of the states were announced because radical
leftist groups, who oppose the monarchy, have threatened violence
to disrupt ceremonies related to the coronation.
   Radicals claimed responsibility for a fire in July that razed a
shrine in Akita and were suspected of setting a fire earlier this
week in a buidling formerly used as a train station for the
imperial family. But no incidents were reported at either harvest
ceremony.
   Ito said he was not told by local agricultural officials that
his paddy had been chosen until one month before the harvest, and
that the palace had not approached him until one week before the
rice was to be cut.
   ``The first I heard about it was on the night of Aug. 23,'' he
said. ``It was a very unexpected thing, and I was quite shocked.''

   The United Nations is sending a human
rights expert to Burma to check on claims of torture and the
failure to investigate the 1988 killing of thousands of
pro-democracy demonstrators, U.N. officials said Wednesday.
   The leader of Burma's opposition, Aung San Suu Kyi, has been
under house arrest for more than a year. Her National League for
Democracy won a majority of seats in May's parliamentary elections,
but the military government has not yet turned over power.
   The entire leadership of the National League for Democracy has
been detained. Last month, the acting head of the opposition party,
his deputy and four regional party leaders were arrested and
charged with breaking the official secrets act.
   The government says it must resolve some challenged election
results and write a new constitution before stepping down.
   The U.N. Commission on Human Rights is sending an investigator
to Burma who will give the Geneva-based commission a private report
in February, said U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes.
   Burma's deputy foreign minister, U Ohn Gyaw, said that his
government ``has agreed to, and indeed welcomes the visit to our
country of Prof. Sadako Ogata, an independent expert appointed by
the Commission on Human Rights.''
   ``She will shortly be arriving in our country to carry out her
mandate,'' he said.
   ``Questions have been raised in certain quarters concerning the
restraint placed on certain individuals in my country,'' he added.
   ``Legal action has been taken against these persons not for
their political activities but for their infringement of the
existing laws of the land,'' he said.
   In 1988, government troops fired on pro-democracy demonstrators,
killing thousands of them, in Rangoon, the Burmese capital.
   Amnesty International says that many hundreds, perhaps thousands
of suspected government opponents were detained without charge or
trial or sentenced to prison terms after unfair trials before
military tribunals.
   At least 100 people have been sentenced to death, although it is
not known if any sentences have been carried out, said Amnesty.
   The government has never investigated the orders to the troops
to fire on the protesters.
   Torture and arbitrary executions by soldiers trying to put down
insurgences were widely reported, Amnesty said.

   Fired employees have a right to sue if the
company's grievance procedure does not get them rehired, an
attorney for two Michigan workers argued Wednesday in the Supreme
Court.
   The attorney, Laurence Gold, asked the court to overturn lower
court rulings that the workers were bound by the result of the
in-house grievance procedure.
   But Terence V. Page, attorney for the Ferndale Fastener Division
of Ring Screw Works in the Detroit suburb of Ferndale, Mich.,
argued that the lower courts ruled correctly since the employees'
contract did not explicitly grant the right to sue.
   ``This court has never allowed people to run the gamut'' of
company appeals and then go to court ``for a second bite of the
apple,'' Page said.
   The key question the case raises is whether employees may take
labor disputes to court when their collective bargaining agreements
neither grant nor rule out a lawsuit.
   Ring Screw Works and its employees have operated under a
collective bargaining agree since the early 1950s with Local 771 of
the United Auto Workers union.
   The agreement sets out a four-step grievance procedure for
settling disputes, including outside mediators if agreeable to both
sides.
   If the talks produce deadlock, the union could strike and the
company could lock out the workers. The contract says nothing about
the possibility of lawsuits.
   Gold said in an interview he was not involved in drafting the
agreement and did not know why the subject wasn't addressed.
   ``It just looks like it never surfaced as an issue,'' he said.
   Most union contracts, but not all, do say whether lawsuits may
be filed.
   In 1985, Ring Screw Works fired Arthur Groves on the grounds of
excessive absenteeism and Bobby J. Evans for allegedly falsifying
company records. Both tried to get their jobs back through the
normal grievance procedure, but failed.
   The company declined to submit to arbitration but the union
decided not to strike.
   The employees then sued, claiming the company breached the
collective bargaining agreement by firing the workers without just
cause.
   The U.S. District Court in Detroit threw out the suits, saying
the employees could not sue unless there was evidence the union had
not given them effective representation. The workers made no such
allegation.
   A federal appeals court upheld the decision.
   Gold told the justices he doubted the employees would have
agreed to the contract if they thought it would prevent them from
going to court as a last resort.
   ``We believe ... collective bargaining agreements should not be
construed to preclude judicial enforcement unless that is clearly
and unmistakably the parties' intent,'' he said.
   Page said that by providing for strikes and lockouts as a last
resort, the two sides signaled an intent to resolve their disputes
among themselves without involving the courts.
   Associate Justice Byron White expressed skepticism that strikes
and lockouts are effective means of resolving disputes. The winner
of such showdowns is stronger or more patient but not necessarily
the correct side, he said.
   Page disagreed, saying the value of strikes and lockouts is in
prodding workers and management to resume negotiations. The courts'
proper role is not to settle labor disputes but to act as umpires
and ``make sure you play by the rules,'' he said.

   Across America, newspapers printed the
headline politicians least like to see.
   President Bush was portrayed as having reversed himself on taxes
and Wednesday's papers called him indecisive.
   In Houston, headlines said Bush ``Pulls Fast Reverse'' and in
Hot Springs, Ark. he ``Recants.'' In Omaha, Neb., and Portland,
Ore., he says ``Yes, Then No.''
   In Hudson County, N. J., he ``Blinks.'' He is ``Fickle'' in
Little Rock, Ark., ``Backs Off'' in Sioux Falls, S.D., and
``Waffles'' in Albany, N.Y.
   All because of an apparent change of heart. On Tuesday morning,
Bush told a news conference he could accept higher tax rates for
the richest of Americans in exchange for lower tax rates on capital
gains.
   In the afternoon, he met with protesting Republican senators.
They carried out word that he had changed his stance.
   Politicians hate to be seen as contradicting themselves, and
Bush's spokesman said Wednesday that the president had merely
listened to the senators, not blatantly reversed himself. But
headline writers everywhere in America had already had their field
day.
   Bush might have recalled what John F. Kennedy said about
newspapers after he moved into the White House. He said he was
``reading them more and enjoying it less.''
   Before leaving town on a campaign trip Wednesday, Bush could
have gotten an idea about what kind of a day it was to be from the
front page of The Washington Times:

   But generally the verbs of choice were flip and flop:
   ``Bush Flips, Then Flops on Tax Rates for Rich,'' said The
Evening Sun of Baltimore.
   ``Bush Flip-Flops on Tax Swap,'' said The Gazette of Cedar
Rapids, Iowa.
   ``President Flip-Flops on Tax Deal'' said The Herald-Leader of
Lexington, Ky.
   ``Bush Flips on Taxes'' said the Philadelphia Daily News.
   A smattering of other read-my-flip headlines from the
Wednesday's papers:
   -``Bush Fickle on Raising Taxes on Rich.'' (Arkansas Gazette of
Little Rock).
   -``Bush Zigzags on Higher Taxes for Wealthy.'' (The
American-Statesman of Austin, Texas).
   -``President Agrees to Tax Wealthy - Then Backs Off.'' (The

   ``Bush Switches Sides on Tax Tradeoff - Twice.'' (The Kansas

Cheyenne.)
   -``Bush Wavers on Higher Tax for Wealthy'' (The Sun-Sentinel of
Fort Lauderdale, Fla.)
   -``Prez Is Yes-&amp;-No on Tax Hike'' (The New York Daily News).
   No one, of course, knows what was in the president's mind. But
maybe, just maybe, he composed a headline of his own:

<HEAD>Police Officer Starts Somber Reading of List of Crash Victims</HEAD>

   A police sergeant on Wednesday began
the somber roll call of the 270 people who died in the terrorist
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland.
   In a silent courtroom virtually empty of spectators, Sgt. David
Johnston began listing in alphabetical order the fate of each
victim and where their bodies were found as documented by
investigators and pathologists.
   All 259 people aboard the Boeing 747 died when it exploded over
the nearby town of Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988. Eleven people in
that Scottish town were also killed in the crash.
   Johnston, of Strathclyde police, told the first public hearing
into the crash that he arrived in Lockerbie on Christmas Day to
work with a unit collating information on the dead.
   The first name on his roll call was John Michael Gerard Ahearn,
26, a government bonds broker who lived in Rockville Center, N.Y.
   In a process lasting six minutes, Johnston told the court how
the young American had been sitting in seat 30C in the economy
class area. His body was found the day after the crash on the
Lockerbie golf course. A postmortem exam put the cause of death as
multiple injuries.
   Johnston said Ahearn was identified by dental records.
   The sergeant then continued with the list. The roll call is
expected to take several days.
   Earlier, Johnston told how 17 victims, 10 passengers and seven
Lockerbie residents, were officially registered as ``missing
presumed dead.''
   Most of the missing passengers were sitting in the fuel-laden
wing section that crashed in a fireball in the Sherwood Crescent
section of town, damaging or destroying about 20 homes. The missing
local residents were from those homes.
   Several dozen bags of unidentified human remains and two bodies
that could not be identified were cremated, police said.
   Johnston said for each casualty, a ``victim pack'' was compiled,
listing all documentary material relating to their death.
   The officer also produced maps showing the location of each body
and described how the victims were identified by several means,
mainly dental records and fingerprints.
   Some were identified by distinctive features like tattoos. Two
victims were identified by next of kin who were members of the
medical profession.
   The officer described how police obtained proof that those
missing had joined the doomed flight, in some cases recovering
personal documents like driving licenses from the debris.
   The inquiry is focusing on the causes of death and airport
security, but not criminal responsibility. Scottish police say they
are investigating several radical Palestinian groups and Fraser has
said he believes the bombers will be caught.

<HEAD>United Nations Launches Big Aid Program to Help Angolans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Nations is launching a relief
program this month to feed more than 1 million Angolans suffering
from drought and a debilitating civil war, the U.N. coordinator in
Luanda said Wednesday.
   It is the first time the United Nations has gotten clearance to
distribute food throughout the country from Angola's Marxist
government and from the rebel army that has been fighting for 15
years, said U.N. Luanda coordinator Otto Esseien.
   The United Nations plans to distribute about $60 million in
food, clothing, drinking water and vaccines to Angola the next six
months, he said.
   Official estimates of Angolans in need of disaster relief vary
from 500,000 by official count to 2 million, according to
international organizations. Angola's population is 10.5 million. A
severe drought has affected the country since last year.
   Aid initiatives have been stymied by government fears that food
convoys would be used to smuggle arms to the rebels of the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   UNITA, as the rebel force is known by its Portuguese acronym,
was concerned the government would block shipments to the areas it
controls, mostly in the southern and eastern parts of the country.
   Government and rebel delegations met last month in Portugal,
with U.S. and Soviet observers, to negotiate a cease-fire. The two
sides agreed to further peace talks later this month.
   Both sides have withdrawn their objections to the relief
deliveries and vowed not to attack aid convoys, Esseien said.
   But he acknowledged, ``The whole operation is costly, complex
and risky.'' The aid shipments will reach Angola through the port
of Lobito, in the southern province of Benguela, and through two
points on the Namibian border. The convoys will have no military
escort.
   The rebels dominate most of Cuando Cubango, a southeastern
province bordering Namibia, where the threat of starvation is said
to be gravest.
   Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, say
more than 30,000 people have died of starvation this year in
Angola.
   UNITA has been fighting the Soviet-backed government since it
took power in 1975 after the war of independence with Portugal.
   The war has left this resource-rich country in a state of ruin.
It has claimed more than 340,000 lives, left 50,000 people maimed
and hundreds of thousands homeless, according to official figures.
   The relief program will be one of the largest the United Nations
has undertaken in Africa since its aid to hunger-stricken Ethiopia
in the early 1980s, Esseien said.
   Unrest over food shortages has mounted in Luanda, the capital,
since the government last month imposed an economic austerity
package. The package replaced Angola's currency with a new unit,
the New Kwanza, devalued it 50 percent and froze most cash in
circulation.
   The government promised to fill official stores with food but
supplies have been slow to arrive.
   Tension peaked Tuesday when 3,000 shipyard workers in Luanda
refused to work all morning to protest the reforms, which left them
without coins and small bank notes for shopping.

   Record low temperatures hit parts of Texas on Wednesday, snow
fell around the Great Lakes and a tropical storm raked southern
Florida with wind-driven rain.
   Snow mixed with rain and occasional thunderstorms fell during
the afternoon from Wisconsin across northern Illinois, and central
lower Michigan. About 2 inches of wet snow broke tree limbs and
power lines near Freeport, Ill., the National Weather Service said.
Two inches of snow fell at Madison, Wis.
   Snow accumulated during the morning in Montana on a highway
between Marias Pass and Shelby, and advisories were posted for
hazardous driving conditions caused by snow on a highway north of
Browning, Mont.
   Chilly air spilled southward across the Plains and record lows
in Texas were 45 at Austin, a tie; 42 at Bryan-College Station; 38
at Midland; 36 at San Angelo; 43 at San Antonio, a tie; and 38 at
Wichita Falls, a tie.
   Record lows elsewhere were 21 at Duluth, Minn.; 32, a tie, at
Kansas City, Mo.; 37, tie, at Pueblo, Colo.; and 44, tie, at
Redding, Calif.
   Florida Gulf Coast residents kept a wary eye on a weak Tropical
Storm Marco as it moved up the edge of the Florida peninsula with
40 mph wind, heavy rain and erosive tides.
   By early afternoon, Miami already had 4.5 inches from Marco and
the Atlantic remnants of Tropical Storm Klaus, which was absorbed
when its much stronger cousin formed Wednesday north of Cuba.
   Elsewhere, rain and thunderstorms extended across southern
Michigan, parts of Indiana, Ohio, central Kentucky, central
Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
1.06 inches at Waycross, Ga.; 1.40 at Columbia, S.C.; 1.03 at
Atlanta; 1.30 at Savannah, Ga.; 1.26 at Fort Stewart, Ga.; 1.25 at
Sumter, S.C.; 1.20 at Brunswick, Ga.; 1.14 at Charleston, S.C.; and
1.14 at Valdosta, Ga.
   Wednesday low for the Lower 48 states was 16 at Gunnison, Colo.

   The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly
approved a treaty formally ending the post-World War II division of
Germany, with wary members suppressing concerns about yesteryear's
aggressor in the interest of advancing the cause of European
democracy.
   ``We welcome the German people, as a whole, back to the
fraternity of civilized nations,'' exclaimed Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa.
   Voting a week after unification, senators also made clear that
nothing in the treaty's ratification should be construed as tacit
U.S. acceptance of the Soviet Union's postwar annexation of the
Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
   The treaty, signed in Moscow Sept. 12 by Britain, France, the
Soviet Union, the United States and East and West Germany, now goes
to President Bush for his signature. It relinquishes all American
rights and responsibilities over Germany and lifts Soviet, French
and British controls over the country as well.
   ``A unified Germany is something I look at with some concern,''
said Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., who fled Berlin during his
childhood. ``I intend to vote for this resolution. Nothing should
stand in its way. But a sense of the history of Central Europe and
a sense of the history of the world should be stated on the Senate
floor ... so that Germany will remember that we will be watchful.''
   ``The millennium has not yet come,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., echoing several senators' statements of concern about the
peaceful intentions of a unified Germany.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said he supported the treaty and said
he had been assured by Secretary of State James A. Baker III that
it was understood the accord did not override longstanding U.S.
policy against recognizing the Soviet annexation of the Baltic
states.
   ``We must now focus our attention and our energy on the
challenges of the future, not the legacy of the past,'' said Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   ``This treaty is of historic importance,'' he said. ``It marks
the end of an era. It puts behind a century of conflict or
potential conflict at the center of the earth - a century that
witnessed the ravages of two wars.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said the treaty ``does
not exact the price of German sovereignty for German unification.
... All freedom-loving people of the world have won.''
   The treaty was approved 98-0, with Sens. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.,
and Pete Wilson, R-Calif., not voting.
   The ``Big Four'' powers already had agreed to suspend their
rights Oct. 1, in time for the reunification to go forward.
   After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the four allies divided the
country and its capital into four occupation zones, which became
East and West Germany and East and West Berlin.
   Aside from ending the division of the country, the treaty calls
on the Soviet Union to complete the withdrawal of its estimated
370,000 troops from what was East Germany by 1994.
   U.S., British and French troops will remain in Berlin during the
interim.
   In sending the treaty to the Senate, President Bush had said it
``clears the way to achievement of the goal we Americans have long
shared with the German people: a united, democratic and sovereign
Germany.''

<TEXT>
   Barbara Boggs Sigmund, the colorful and
eloquent Princeton mayor who lost to Gov. Jim Florio in last
Democratic gubernatorial primary, died Wednesday at age 51.
   Mrs. Sigmund was the daughter of U.S. Rep. Lindy Boggs, a
Democrat from New Orleans, and the late Hale Boggs, who was the
House majority leader and had been slated to become speaker when he
was killed in a 1972 plane crash.
   Mrs. Sigmund, who died at home, had been suffering from a
recurrence of a cancer that first struck her in the early 1980s.
That cancer, a malignant melanoma, forced the removal of her left
eye in 1982.
   After the loss of her eye, Mrs. Sigmund made a trademark of her
collection of fashionable eye patches, which were always
coordinated with the color of her outfits or of holiday symbols.
   As a campaign gimmick during the primary, she distributed eye
patches to businessmen, lobbyists and politicians.
   Late last year, she announced the melanoma had reappeared and
had spread.
   Mrs. Sigmund ran unsuccessfully U.S. Senate in 1982 and was
elected mayor of the hometown of Princeton University in 1984.
   She was expected to run for Congress if Republican Rep. James
Courter's bid for governor was successful and his seat became
available. Courter lost but by the time he announced that he would
retire from Congress, she was again battling cancer.
   ``Her death marks the end of a life that was dedicated to
excellence and compassion,'' Florio said. ``She used her many gifts
to the fullest. And in doing so, she touched many hearts and made
her home in Princeton, as well as this state, a better place for
everyone.''
   Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean called Mrs. Sigmund ``a woman of
remarkable courage, who kept through a difficult time with a sense
of perspective and humor.''
   U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenburg, who defeated Mrs. Sigmund in the
1982 Democratic primary, read a tribute into the Congressional
Record on Wednesday.
   ``Everyone who knew Barbara was enriched by their association
with her,'' said Lautenburg. ``She was a unique individual who had
an abundance of wit, knowledge, charm and character.''
   Mrs. Sigmund was born in New Orleans on May 27, 1939. At age 12,
she proclaimed that her lifelong ambition was to run for Congress.
Nine years later, she was president of the student body at
Manhattanville College in New York, where she received a degree in
governmental studies.
   Her gubernatorial primary campaign was short on cash, but Mrs.
Sigmund charmed crowds with her wit, saying she wanted to be New
Jersey's first ``governess.''
   Of Florio, who at the time was a congressman, Mrs. Sigmund said:
``It's always good to have a man around the house. Let's keep him
there.''
   She finished a surprising second in the three-candidate race.
   Mrs. Sigmund pushed for social programs, including low-income
housing, and criticized what she said was a lack of planning in
many of the state's corporate park sprawls.
   She is survived by her husband, Paul, a professor of Latin
American studies at Princeton University and three sons. She also
is survived by a sister, Cokie Roberts a correspondent for National
Public Radio and ABC News, and a brother, Thomas Hale Boggs, a
Washington lawyer.
   Funeral services were scheduled for Saturday at the Princeton
Universty Chapel.

   The government said Wednesday that
Portugal had sold Iraq uranium concentrate, a material that could
be used to produce nuclear weapons.
   The Ministry for Industry and Energy said the government sold
252 tons of the concentrate to the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission
from 1980 to 1982. It said no sales were made after 1983.
   Under the contract, Iraq agreed to use the uranium for purely
peaceful ends and abide by the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,
the ministry said in a statement.
   A ministry spokesman said the concentrate sold to Iraq was not
the enriched variety that can be used directly in nuclear weapons.
   The government was responding to a report in a Spanish newspaper
that said Portugal had exported 1,189 tons of uranium from 1980 to
1988. The report said much of the uranium was purchased by Iraq. It
suggested Iraq could have used the material to produce nuclear
weapons.

   Jordan is discussing plans to arm and train
a civil guard to help the army fight any potential Israeli attack,
Parliament Speaker Suleiman Arar said Wednesday.
   Arar told 3,000 demonstrators gathered to protest the Monday
killings of 19 Palestinians in Israeli-occupied east Jerusalem that
Prime Minister Mudar Badran has accepted a request from Parliament
to arm a citizen's militia.
   An official in the Prime Minister's office said the government
would meet next Tuesday to discuss the implementation of the plan.
   Yaqoub Qirrish, a member of Parliament, said the plan would
probably involve storing weapons at local police stations for use
by civilians in emergencies.
   Moslem fundamentalists as well as left-wing political parties
and Palestinian factions have been asking the government for 20
years to train and arm citizens as a second line of defense against
Israel.
   The groups have expressed increased fears that Israel might
attack Jordan and expel Palestinians in the occupied West Bank to
Jordan to create an alternative Palestinian homeland.
   Palestinians comprise about half of Jordan's population of 3.4
million.
   ``We have met the Prime Minister and convinced him of the need
to arm people. He agreed and said the decision will take effect in
three days,'' Arar told the protesters outside his Parliament
office.
   ``The government has promised to respond to the armament
request, but it is going to be within limited and narrow limits,''
said an official in Badran's office, who did not elaborate.
   ``Our financial situation does not permit us to buy arms for all
the people of Jordan,'' he said, citing the country's $8.3 billion
foreign debt.
   The official, insisting on anonymity, said Badran and Parliament
agreed to ``meet Tuesday to put forward a plan crystalizing these
armament ideas.'' He said King Hussein might preside over the
closed-door meeting.
   In 1970, an estimated 20,000 Palestinian were killed during a
civil war that pitted King Hussein's largely Bedouin army against
Palestinian factions. Since the fighting the government has refused
requests to arm citizens.
   Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East
war, prompting a mass flight of refugees to Jordan.

   Workers surveyed damage Wednesday on the
offshore oil production platform that caught fire overnight and
injured six of the 84 people aboard.
   ``We have made an inspection and are trying to piece together
exactly what happened,'' said Jay Cheatham, vice president and
southeastern district manager for Arco Oil &amp; Gas Co.
   He said it was too soon to know what caused the 45-minute fire,
and he offered no timetable for resuming production.
   The platform, owned by Arco and producing 15,000 barrels of
crude a day, sits six miles out in the Gulf of Mexico, near the
mouth of the Mississippi River, about 100 miles southeast of New
Orleans.
   Workers escaped in a life raft and an emergency capsule, said
Earl Simms, an Arco spokesman in Dallas. He said none had to jump
into the sea.
   Five of the six injured men were admitted to hospitals, where
all but one were listed in stable to good condition. Mitchell Ham,
28, of Columbia, Miss., was in critical condition with second and
third-degree burns, said West Jefferson Medical Center spokesman
Jim Pittman.
   A ivilian company was handling pollution cleanup, Coast Guard
Petty Officer Dennis Schaefer said.
   ``The boats were shooting water on the fire, and probably there
was a little bit of oil that washed over as a result of that, but
as far as we know there's no spill coming from the platform,''
Cheatham said.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Wednesday he
wants to crack down on the black marketeering that has spread
rapidly as the Soviet leadership hesitates between a centrally
planned and a market economy.
   In his speech at the closing session of a Communist Party
Central Committee meeting, Gorbachev, the party leader as well as
president, signaled a strong assertion of his enhanced executive
powers.
   He also emphasized that economic reform plans would not call for
a ``restoration of capitalism,'' indicating a possible step away
from the radical steps at which central Communist authorities have
balked over the past year.
   The party itself retreated further from its vanguard role by
announcing it was cutting its headquarters staff from 1,493 to 536
people and refraining from making key decisions on national
economy.
   The actions appeared in line with Gorbachev's proclaimed
intention of transferring power to elected legislative and
executive bodies.
   The Soviet Union seems to be sinking into chaos, however. The
party - which with 18 million members is by far the largest
organization in the country - is deeply divided over Gorbachev's
policy of perestroika.
   The legislature has been unable to agree on a plan to move the
nation to a market economy. Two weeks ago it gave Gorbachev
sweeping powers to carry out reforms.
   Gorbachev told the meeting Wednesday that by week's end, he will
propose to the Supreme Soviet legislature ``tough measures that
will represent a powerful weapon in the hands of law enforcers and
authorities.''
   His proclaimed ``allegiance to the socialist idea'' and call for
a war on speculation and black marketeering appeared to reflect a
conservative backlash against the halting steps authorities have
taken toward a market economy.
   Law enforcement officials have complained the state businesses
that dominate the economy have not been fulfilling their obligatory
delivery quotas to other state enterprises, and that the goods are
being sold instead on the black market.
   Gorbachev issued a decree on Oct. 4 authorizing fines against
businesses that fail to fulfill state orders. His new proposals
would enforce that decree.
   He said a reform package he is assembling will include a mixture
of state and privately owned businesses, and rental of some
government-owned properties to entrepreneurs.
   ``I resolutely reject efforts to proclaim the transition to the
market as a restoration of capitalism,'' he said.
   He predicted the people will support his tough measures against
trade outside the state sphere.
   Under his supervision, a parliamentary commission is trying to
meld radical and moderate proposals to move toward a market
economy, private industry and decollectivized agriculture.
   A party source, speaking on condition of anonymity, predicted
Gorbachev would take steps ``to control democracy in order to
preserve the democratic reforms'' he has taken.
   Deputy party chief Vladimir Ivashko told reporters Wednesday the
400 Central Committee members were ceding economic responsibility
to the Supreme Soviet, saying: ``It would be wrong if the plenary
session of the Communist Party Central Committee turned into an
affiliate of the Supreme Soviet and started competing on various
aspects of a particular program. Our task is to determine political
aspects of this very difficult process.''
   The situation has been complicated by shortages of food and
other basics and by resolutions by nearly all 15 Soviet republics,
including the Russian Federation, declaring various forms of
independence and sovereignty.
   If radical economic reforms take place, the secretariat staff
reduction could foreshadow sharp reductions in the number of
employees in the central ministries which now own nearly all Soviet
businesses.
   Last year, the secretariat let go about 500 workers.
   Western diplomats and experts have predicted that sudden
displacement of an elite that once ran the country could add
momentum to a possible conservative backlash.
   The state news agency Tass carried excerpts of Gorbachev's
remarks, which Pravda editor Ivan Frolov told reporters would be
carried by the party newspaper Friday.

   Nine Western European and North African countries,
including Libya, forged a regional grouping Wednesday to promote
stability and economic development in the Mediterranean region.
   They agreed to develop close political, economic and cultural
ties with the aim of turning the Western Mediterranean into ``an
area of peace, cooperation and stability.''
   They also pledged to work toward the convening of an
international conference on peace and security in the region.
   The initiative was launched by Italy, France, Spain, Portugal,
Libya, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and Mauritania.
   Libya has often been accused of supporting international
terrorism. The New York Times reported Wednesday that Libyan
intelligence agents may have played a role in the 1988 bombing of a
Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   An Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman said the issue of
terrorism was not raised Wednesday.
   In a joint declaration, the nine countries said their initiative
was designed to prevent ``marginalization'' of the Arab nations on
the Mediterranean's southern shore.
   ``The great current divide between the level of development in
the north and south of the Mediterranean has introduced imbalances
causing grave dangers for the stability and well-being of the whole
region,'' it said.
   The nine backed in principal a proposal launched last month by
Spain and Italy for a Conference on Security and Cooperation in the
Mediterranean.

   Space shuttle Discovery
was launched with incorrect instructions for how it should operate
some of its computer programs, a NASA official said Wednesday.
   The mistake never posed a threat to the shuttle or its five-man
crew, said Milt Heflin, lead flight director for the mission.
   ``This was serious,'' Heflin said. ``But it didn't hurt
anything.''
   The crew noticed the error on a computer display screen about
one hour after Discovery was launched Saturday from Cape Canaveral,
Fla., and quickly corrected it, Heflin said by phone from Johnson
Space Center in Texas.
   Even if the crew hadn't discovered the error, automatic
safeguards on Discovery would have prevented any problem, he added.
   Nevertheless, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
will write an ``anomaly report'' on the incident and investigate to
determine the cause of the error and to prevent it from happening
again, Heflin said.
   Discovery landed safely in California on Wednesday after a
four-day flight highlighted by the launch of the Ulysses space
probe, which will study the sun's polar regions in 1994 and 1995.
   Heflin said the error was made before launch, but was discovered
when the five astronauts were converting the shuttle's five onboard
computers from launch operations to orbital operations.
   To do that, the astronauts call up pre-loaded instructions on
computer screens. After checking the instructions, they give a
command that has each computer follow the instructions.
   As planned, computers No. 3 and 5 were shut off and computers
No. 1 and 2 followed instructions that made them guide, navigate
and control the shuttle.
   Computer No. 4 is used for ``housekeeping'' tasks, including
monitoring Discovery's propulsion, electrical and life-support
systems, including temperature and pressure.
   But Heflin said that when the astronauts called up the
computerized display showing the instructions for computer No. 4,
they found the display screen had been incorrectly loaded with
instructions intended for computer No. 2.
   Because of built-in safeguards, the wrong instructions
``wouldn't have gone anywhere,'' he added.
   Heflin said the computer program for the shuttle's housekeeping
functions started operating when the astronauts fixed the error,
but would have automatically done so anyway because the wrong
instructions would have been rejected.
   The mistake is considered serious, Heflin said, because ``if we
erred in some procedures on the ground, why did we not catch it?''

<HEAD>Irene Mayer Selznick Dies at 83</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irene Mayer Selznick, who spent half her life as
a member of two film dynasties before creating her own legend as
Broadway producer of ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' died Wednesday.
She was 83.
   Mrs. Selznick died at the Pierre Hotel, where she had an
apartment overlooking Central Park, said William Hartgrave, night
manager of the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel.
   Mrs. Selznick, who was born in New York City and spent part of
her childhood in Boston, was the daughter of the powerful and
tyrannical movie mogul Louis B. Mayer. As head of production at
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Mayer was the most important filmmaker in
Hollywood during the 1920s and 1930s.
   When she met the young studio executive David O. Selznick at age
19, she found a man who matched her father in strength, power and
influence. She married Selznick, who went on to become one of the
most successful film producers of his time, producing such classics
as ``Gone with the Wind.''
   As a child, she was taught to prepare for life as a conventional
wife and mother, according to her 1983 memoirs, ``A Private View.''
   ``I'd pick up a book,'' she said during a 1983 interview, ``and
my father would say `she knows too much already.'''
   As the mother of two boys, Mrs. Selznick led a traditional life
with David Selznick until the marriage broke up in 1948. The split
came in part because of Selznick's affair with actress Jennifer
Jones, whom he later married. Selznick died in 1965.
   After the divorce, Mrs. Selznick moved back to New York and
became a Broadway producer, beginning with ``A Streetcar Named
Desire.'' In a battle with the play's director, Elia Kazan, she
once yelled, ``I've survived Louis B. Mayer and I've survived David
O. Selznick. It's no use. You better lay off.'' Kazan did.
   Mrs. Selznick also produced a string of Broadway hits such as
``Bell, Book and Candle,'' ``The Complaisant Lover,'' and ``The
Chalk Garden.''
   Survivors are sons Lewis and Daniel Selznick. Funeral
arrangements were pending.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Won't Hear Keating Appeal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The California Supreme Court declined
Wednesday to hear an appeal by jailed financier Charles H. Keating
Jr. who seeks reduction of his $5 million bail on fraud charges.
   Keating's lawyers sought a hearing from the San Francisco-based
high court after a state appeals cour rejected a request for bail
reduction.
   Keating, 66, an Arizona developer and chairman of American
Continental Corp., the parent of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp;
Loan, has been jailed in Los Angeles since his indictment last
month.
   He is accused of fraud in selling American Continental junk
bonds to investors at branches of Lincoln Savings, misleading
investors about their security.
   Keating contends he can't adequately defend himself if he
remains jailed.
   At a hearing last week, Keating declared he was ``absolutely not
guilty'' of the charges against him. A pretrial hearing is
scheduled Monday.
   Stephen C. Neal, Keating's main attorney, has said he would
pursue every avenue to get Keating out of jail. The next appeal
would be to a federal court.
   Neal didn't immediately return telephone calls Wednesday after
the state Supreme Court issued its decision.
   Keating and three co-defendants surrendered to face a 42-count
state grand jury indictment on Sept. 18. Superior Court Judge Gary
Klausner set Keating's bail at $5 million and held the other
defendants on $1 million bail.
   The judge later reduced the co-defendants' bail to $100,000 or
$200,000 and they were released. Klausner refused to lower
Keating's bail, saying the possibility of 10 years in prison made
him a flight risk.
   Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for District Attorney Ira Reiner,
said the Supreme Court's ruling was ``not unexpected to us.''
   Reiner has acknowledged the $5 million bail was unusually high,
but has said he believes Keating might try to flee the jurisdiction
if released on bail.

<HEAD>U.S. Bans Wheat for Sudan Until Relief Goes to Rebels</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No more U.S. wheat will go to war-torn Sudan
until the government lets relief move to areas held by rebels, the
U.S. Agency for International Development said Wednesday.
   ``Several weeks ago the Sudanese government imposed a freeze on
all food grain within the country,'' said John Metelsky, an agency
spokesman. ``This prevented the moving of 35,000 tons of relief
grain already in Sudan.
   ``The United States can send no more wheat until relief can move
freely throughout the country and other obstacles for the
distribution of relief can be overcome.''
   Relief centers had been bombed and relief flights grounded, he
added. Last Saturday United Nations officials in New York said
Sudan had lifted its ban on relief flights to rebels in the
southern part of the country.
   Last month, U.S. officials accused Sudanese president Omar
el-Bashir of ordering an air raid on a grain barge at the same time
he was seeking $150 million in additional U.S. food aid.
   Metelsky said 45,000 tons of wheat from the United States
intended for commercial sale in Sudan had been stopped but that
famine aid had not been cut off. He emphasized that the U.S.
agreement to deliver $20 million worth of wheat had not been
cancelled.
   ``We are ready to reschedule delivery when Sudan meets the
conditions of the agreement,'' he said.
   He noted that the United States had supplied $51.3 million worth
of disaster aid to Sudan in the year that ended Sept. 30.
   About 5 million people have been hit by drought in the Sudan and
3 to 4 million displaced by civil strife, he said. U.N. officials
have predicted that drought could kill a million Sudanese.
   Civil war has afflicted the country much of the time since it
became independent from joint British-Egyptian rule in 1956.
   ``The message we want to convey is that it will be impossible to
meet Sudan's needs unless the government makes and carries through
a firm commitment to facilitate the movement of relief food
throughout the country,'' including rebel-held areas, Metelsky
said.

<HEAD>Ann Richards: Clayton Williams Should Discuss Drug Money Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HOLMES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ann
Richards sought Wednesday to link Republican opponent Clayton
Williams to a federal investigation into alleged drug money
laundering.
   Williams press secretary Gordon Hensley accused Richards of
``dealing with unfounded rumors, allegations and innuendos, many of
which she generated herself. ... She seems to be losing it by
lashing out at Mr. Williams in an irrational manner.''
   At a news conference, Richards cited a Houston Chronicle report
that said federal agents were investigating allegations against a
Houston loan broker, Lloyd G. Williams Jr., who also has done
business with ClayDesta National Bank, the Midland bank owned by
the GOP nominee.
   ``I think it is incumbent on Clayton Williams to cooperate with
the investigation and tell the voters of Texas what his
relationship was with Lloyd Williams,'' Richards said.
   Hensley said Clayton Williams ``has answered questions in a very
forthright manner. He said he does not know the man (Lloyd
Williams).''
   Lloyd Williams, no relation to the GOP candidate, said Wednesday
he had nothing to do with alleged money laundering and that he was
puzzled by the inquiry. He also said he didn't know Clayton
Williams and only met him once, at a fund-raising event last
spring.
   Lloyd Williams told the Chronicle he had acted as an FBI
``operative'' for more than 10 years. ``Why they are now coming at
me, I don't know,'' he said.
   Richards suggested that the investigation may be why Williams
won't debate her.
   ``I think it is very likely, considering the recent press we've
seen, that there are questions he doesn't want to be asked, that he
doesn't want to discuss on television,'' Richards said.
   Hensley rejected the contention. ``That's not even a factor.
Clayton Williams has said he'd be happy to debate Ann Richards if
she will go along and pledge to the voters of Texas that she will
refrain from additional negative TV advertising,'' he said.
   The Chronicle reported this week that Lloyd Williams' primary
source of income comes from working with auto dealers to arrange
financing for car buyers with credit problems.
   Last June, Lloyd Williams began arranging such loans through
ClayDesta National, the newspaper reported.
   The Chronicle said investigators are looking into alleged
laundering of drug proceeds through Fallbrook National Bank and
Columbia Savings, both closed last year by federal regulators.
   Richards said ``the question remains'' whether the alleged
laundering extended to ClayDesta and may have tainted Clayton
Williams' campaign money.
   Laundering is the process in which large amounts of cash
generated by illegal activities are passed through legitimate
transactions to make it hard to trace or confiscate. Banks willing
to risk taking large cash deposits without asking too many
questions can profit if they invest or lend the money at higher
interest rates than they pay the depositors.
   Richards aide Bill Cryer said Lloyd Williams had done some $13
million worth of business through ClayDesta. ``The bank was losing
money until Lloyd Williams started his loan scheme,'' Cryer said.
   Hensley insisted the Richards campaign was engaged in ``gutter''
politics and there were no improprieties on the part of Clayton
Williams.
   ``He knew that ClayDesta Bank was involved in loaning money for
homes and cars, as all banks are,'' Hensley said. But a bank's
owner isn't always familiar ``with specific individuals involved
tangentially in setting up loans,'' Hensley said.

<HEAD>Democrats Say Bush's Stance on Taxes Clouds Budget Deal Prospects</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS new grafs 21-22: ``Dole said,'' with Dole saying
package should exclude capital gains cut</NOTE>

   Confusion over President Bush's position on
higher taxes slowed congressional efforts Wednesday to start work
in earnest on a new budget agreement. Bush showed no inclination to
clarify matters, saying, ``Let Congress clear it up.''
   Congressional Democrats complained that an apparent Bush
rejection of higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans - a reversal
of the position he took at his news conference Tuesday - would make
it tougher to forge a budget compromise.
   But there was no shortage of options, as both Republicans and
Democrats began floating new versions of tax and spending plans on
Capitol Hill.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and other lawmakers who
met with the president Tuesday night said he had not ruled out the
tax boost at that private meeting, as reported by Sen. Bob
Packwood, R-Ore.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that Bush
``listened to'' the GOP lawmakers rather than stating a position.
   Bush, on a campaign trip in the South, was asked repeatedly
about the matter, but turned away the questions with wisecracks.
   He was asked as he jogged during a break in St. Petersburg,
Fla., if he would care to clear up the confusion.
   ``Confusion?'' he responded.
   Was he giving up on his long-sought capital gains tax rate cut,
the item the Democrats supposedly were to trade for his support of
higher income taxes on rich people?
   ``Read my hips,'' he said, pointing, as he jogged by.
   Could he clear up his position?
   ``Let Congress clear it up.''
   The Senate Finance Committee indefinitely postponed a meeting at
which it was to discuss a budget package written by its chairman,
Texas Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, generally in line with the tax trade
Bush endorsed at his news conference.
   ``I had the deal all worked out until the president changes his
position on taxes,'' said Bentsen.
   Across the Capitol, the House Ways and Means Committee adopted a
plan on a voice vote written by its chairman, Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill. The package was similar to the measure
Bentsen's panel had readied, although it would add restrictions on
tax deductions available to people earning more than $100,000
annually.
   It also would add private planes worth more than $100,000 to the
list of luxury items subject to a new 10 percent tax, and place a
2-cent-per-gallon tax on petroleum products, excluding home-heating
oil.
   Rostenkowski's measure contained neither higher tax rates on the
rich nor a lower capital gains tax. But lawmakers said those items
might be added by amendments on the House floor.
   Facing an Oct. 19 deadline, congressional committees must work
out tax and spending details adding up to a $500 billion reduction
in the federal deficit over the next five years.
   Medicare spending is expected to be cut, though not as much as
in the budget package rejected by the House last week, and taxes
are expected to be increased on such consumer items as gasoline,
tobacco and alcohol.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said, ``I had
hoped for agreement on tax proposals along the lines Sen. Bentsen
had indicated a intention to offer and ... the president had
indicated an intention to accept. The president's reversal of that
position last evening ... requires us to reconsider and attempt to
determine how best to proceed.''
   Dole said that because of the political uproar they were
causing, both a lower capital gains tax and higher rates on the
wealthy should be excluded from the package.
   ``They've become sort of a tar baby,'' he said. ``Let's get this
done and get back to deficit reduction.''
   The confusion was also exposing rifts among Republican
lawmakers.
   A group of conservative House Republicans put together a
deficit-slashing plan of their own, raising the income tax rate on
the wealthiest Americans from 28 to 31 percent. It would drop the
rate on people who are almost as well-to-do from 33 percent to 31
percent, and not increase the gasoline tax.
   ``We're delighted to have White House input,'' said Rep. Mickey
Edwards, R-Okla., the leader of the group. ``We're not looking to
the White House for leadership.''
   At day's end Tuesday, GOP senators had visited Bush to tell him
they opposed raising taxes on the wealthy even if Democrats would
agree to capital gains rate cuts.
   ``He just acquiesced in it,'' Packwood told reporters afterward.
   ``I got the impression the president thought that was fine, but
I can't point to a definite fact where he said, all right, this is
it,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I.
   Dole seemed certain: ``He didn't announce his position at all.
He didn't acquiesce.''
   Sen. John Danforth, D-Mo., suggested, ``Sometimes people hear
what they want to hear.''
   The visit itself was yet another example of Republican
lawmakers' unrest concerning proposed budget deals. A majority of
GOP House members went against Bush last week as that chamber voted
down the budget agreement worked out by the White House and
congressional leaders of both parties.
   The turmoil on Wednesday was hardly encouraging to efforts to
fill in the details of the $500 billion budget package over the
next few days and head off a repeat of last weekend's government
shutdown.
   Bush's reported refusal to raise taxes on the rich garnered
headlines across the country and struck a nerve among lawmakers.
The wealthiest Americans now pay taxes at a 28 percent rate on
their top dollar. People who earn slightly less pay 33 percent.
Democrats want to boost the top rate to 33 percent.

<HEAD>Letters of Kidnapped Premier Found in Former Terrorist Hideout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers restoring an apartment used by the
Red Brigades during the 1970s found what appear to be letters
written by former Premier Aldo Moro when he was a captive of the
terrorists, police said Wednesday.
   The former Italian premier and president of the Christian
Democratic Party was slain May 1978 by his kidnappers in probably
the most spectacular action of the once-feared left-wing terrorist
group, which has all but disappeared.
   The letters, two guns and $50,000 in cash had been hidden in a
hole in the wall that police missed when they raided the downtown
Milan apartment and arrested three Red Brigades members in 1978.
   Lauro Azzolini, Franco Bonisoli and Laura Mantovani - the three
captured at the Via Montenevoso hideout - were among the terrorists
who kidnapped Moro in Rome in March 1978, according to trial
records.
   During his captivity, Moro sent numerous letters to his party,
his family and leading political figures asking them to negotiate
an exchange of ``political prisoners'' with the Red Brigades.
Several leaders of the gang were in jail at the time.
   The government at the time rejected any negotations or prisoner
swap. Moro was slain and left in the trunk of a car in Rome.
   Police chief Achille Serra said 418 sheets of papers, including
letters and photocopies, were found in the former Red Brigades
hideout, along with a pistol, a submachine gun, 30 detonators and
the cash.
   Serra said some of the letters ``could be attributed to Aldo
Moro.'' He didn't elaborate.

<HEAD>Charlotte Rae Plays Beckett's `Happy Days'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs Planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charlotte Rae doesn't turn Samuel Beckett's
``Happy Days'' into a joke, but in the revival which opened
Wednesday at off-Broadway's CSC Theater, she does make the play
much funnier than usual.
   Rae, best known for her work on the television series ``The
Facts of Life,'' has a face with seemingly unlimited expressions.
When it brightens in expectation and then falls in chagrin or
disappointment, it reminds a viewer of the quick, unstudied
responses of childhood. One laughs in remembered recognition.
   ``Happy Days,'' in which the leading character Winnie is buried
to her waist in a big clay mound in Act 1 and up to her neck in Act
2, can be seen to mean different things at different viewings.
   Winnie has a bell for morning wakeup and a bell for night sleep.
In between, she isn't striving for major accomplishment. She
reaches into a large purse, puts on pink lipstick, squeezes a flat
toothpaste tube and brushes her teeth with a ragged brush. The
woman proclaims that little things such as an occasional grunt from
her old husband, played by Bill Moor, make it a happy day.
   In this production, a viewer is reminded of a life in
retirement. There's a repetition of the daily rituals that promote
health and well-being and pass time. There's also a determined
effort to keep oneself cheerful.
   Actresses often play Winnie with gallantry. Rae doesn't stress
that; she plays the situation as humorous. And she lets Winnie
appreciate some of the humor. Remembering her first kiss, she
laughs, then ostentatiously pulls back from the laugh, her mouth
turning down.
   With her clown face, Rae's expressions allow the audience to see
even more of the humor of the whole situation than Winnie does.
   ``Happy Days,'' directed here by Carey Perloff, can become
one-dimensional. Rae does not let that happen. She has
extraordinary range as an actress and extraordinary dynamic range,
making her voice shrill to tender to harsh, frivolously high to
wisely deep. ``Mustn't complain. So much to be thankful for,'' she
says briskly, curling her voice into a faintly false upbeat tone.
   She ends Act 1 on a serious note, her eyes amazed and shocked
when she has told herself, ``Pray your prayer, Winnie,'' and finds
herself unable to pray.
   In Act 2, moving her mouth and eyes but not swiveling her neck,
Winnie's smile is now a frozen grin. She tells a story and
frightens herself with it. She shows feelings she didn't exhibit in
Act 1 and becomes sarcastic, frustrated, cynical and rueful. More
importantly, it takes a greater effort to cheer herself up.
   Despite the laughs that Rae is able to get out of ``Happy
Days,'' Beckett's view of the human condition doesn't make a happy
play.

   The Transportation Department has sent a draft
of new auto side impact standards to the White House, a spokesman
said Wednesday.
   The spokesman, Bob Marks, said he had no details on how the
standards would work.
   In any case, the department would make them public only after
the Office of Management and Budget finished its review, he said.
   Marks confirmed a report broadcast by NBC News that the
department had finished drafting the new standards.
   The network said necessary changes in door manufacture could
cost an average of $50 per car, or half a billion dollars a year
for domestic and import manufacturers, when fully in effect in
1996.
   The current side impact standard requires doors to be
manufactured with guard beams inside, but requires no test. The
proposed standard would requires a test for side impact.
   Cars now must pass a frontal barrier impact test, scored
according to notional ``injuries'' received by test dummies in the
front seat.

   The General Assembly on Wednesday
unanimously approved a plan to send poll watchers to Haiti, the
first time the world body has agreed to verify an election at the
invitation of a member state.
   Elections for president, the legislature and mayors are set for
Dec. 16 in the impoverished Caribbean nation of 5.6 million
residents, which long has been plagued by political violence.
   About 50 U.N. observers will go to Haiti immediately. A second
group will follow, bringing the total to ``a few hundred'' poll
watchers.
   In addition, security advisers will help Haitian authorities
organize safe and peaceful balloting, according to the resolution,
approved by acclamation by the 159 assembly members.
   The Organization of American States and a group led by former
President Jimmy Carter are providing other poll watchers.
   Since Haiti's independence from France in 1804, dictators have
usually ruled.
   The last attempt at free elections collapsed in November 1987
when ruffians supported by the army shot and hacked to death at
least 34 voters.
   Following December elections, the new president is to be sworn
in on Feb. 7, 1991, fifth anniversary of the overthrow of the
Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier dictatorship.
   Figures linked to the Duvalier dynasty have returned to Haiti in
recent months, and were linked to murders there.
   President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot wrote to Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar on Sept. 14, specifying she did not want
peacekeeping soldiers sent and that none of the U.N. advisers would
carry firearms.
   Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, commented that
many Haitians regard armed security men as oppressors.
   Perez de Cuellar says he intends to send 87 U.N. staff members
to fill administrative posts, and up to 150 security advisers.
During the election he will add 80 election monitors and 100 more
staff members.
   The U.N. operation will be known as ONUVEH, signifying the
Spanish phrase for U.N. Observer Group for the Verification of
Elections in Haiti.
   The assembly budgetary committee authorized $6.5 million for the
mission.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot was named provisional president in Haiti
on March 13, after military ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril fled
during a popular uprising.
   Political violence has terrorized the population since then.
   In six days last March, nearly 40 people were killed and dozens
wounded in strife said to be provoked by foes of democracy and
Avril supporters.
   Officials in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, welcomed the U.N.
action.
   ``I am very satisfied. This will help enormously to guarantee
the credibility of the election process in Haiti,'' said Jean
Casimir, secretary-general of the Council of State, a
quasi-legislative body that shares power with the provisional
president.
   Although nobody has officially filed, more than 20 presidential
aspirants have declared their candidacy. They have until Oct. 16.
   Communist Party leader Rene Theodore was nominated for president
on Wednesday by the leftist Movement for National Reconstruction,
an influential organization of public figures.
   Radio Haiti-Inter reported that vandals broke into two voter
registration bureaus and the home of an municipal electoral
official Wednesday in Grand Goave. It said the premises were
smeared with human excrement.
   The incident occurred while 28 OAS observers are in Haiti to
monitor voter registration, which began Oct. 6 and runs until Oct.
16.
   On Saturday, vandals used the same tactic on two other
registration bureaus in Gonaives, Haiti's second largest city.

   ABC News and Worldwide Television News said
Wednesday they've signed an agreement to provide domestic and
international news reports to Fuji TV, Japan's largest commercial
network.
   The deal is the second in two months between U.S. and Japanese
networks. CBS and the Tokyo Broadcasting System last month agreed
to combine resources and technology for worldwide newsgathering.
   The CBS contract is exclusive and gives Tokyo Broadcasting the
right to air in Japan such programs as ``CBS Evening News'' and
``60 Minutes.''
   The ABC-WTN contract with Fuji is non-exclusive, said a
spokesman for WTN, a London-based agency serving 1,000 clients
worldwide, including CBS and Cable News Network.
   The Fuji deal doesn't provide for sharing facilities overseas,
either, nor give the Japanese company rights to air ABC's regularly
scheduled news programs, said Scott Michaelis, WTN's regional
executive for North America.
   Fuji will, however, be allowed to excerpt news reports broadcast
on ABC's ``World News Tonight,'' he said. Fuji also will get all of
WTN's international news reports under the agreement.
   ABC, which owns 45 percent of WTN, recently agreed in principle
to raise its stake in the company to 80 percent. London-based
Independent Television News and Australia's Nine Network would
share the remaining percentage.

   Deputy Prime Minister Brian Lenihan is
favored to become Ireland's next president in the Nov. 7 election,
according to an opinion poll published Wednesday.
   The survey shows Lenihan with support of 49 percent of those
interviewed. If no candidate wins 50 percent a second round of
voting will be held for the largely ceremonial office.
   Lenihan, 59, is the candidate of Prime Minister Charles
Haughey's Fianna Fail Party. Leftist candidate Mary Robinson had 32
percent. Austin Currie of the main Fine Gael opposition party was
third with 19 percent.
   The poll conducted by Market Research Bureau of Ireland for
Dublin's Irish Times newspaper surveyed 1,000 voters across the
country on Oct. 5-6. The newspaper gave no margin of error.
   It is the first presidential election in 17 years. In previous
years, the country's three main political parties agreed on the
presidency of Dr. Patrick Hillery, a former finance minister.
   Hillery is stepping down after 14 years, the maximum term under
Irish law.

   Here is the 275-152 roll call Wednesday by
which the House failed to get a two-thirds majority to enact
legislation over President Bush's veto that would impose new quotas
on textile, apparel and shoe imports.
   A ``yes'' vote is a vote to require the proposed new quotas
despite Bush's veto; in other words, to override the veto. To
override, 285 votes would have been required.
   Voting yes were 205 Democrats and 70 Republicans.
   Voting no were 49 Democrats and 103 Republicans.
   X denotes those not voting.
   There is one vacancy in the 435-member House.

   Iraqi soldiers have turned to looting food
from Kuwaiti homes and now bar citizens from hospitals, restricting
medical care to military personnel, Kuwait's ambassador to the
United States said Wednesday.
   At the same time, Iraqis are stripping the invaded country like
a stolen car, removing hospital equipment and even traffic lights
and shipping them to Iraq, witnesses said at a hearing of the House
Human Rights Caucus.
   ``Anything which is not nailed down has been taken away,'' as
well as some things that are nailed down, said Saud Nasir Al-Sabah,
the ambassador. Public buildings, schools and hospitals all have
been gutted, he said.
   But of greater concern are continuing human rights abuses in the
country, including torture or summary execution of anyone suspected
of sympathizing with Kuwait's exiled leadership, said Al-Sabah and
others who have fled the emirate.
   Al-Sabah also predicted that international sanctions imposed on
Iraq after its Aug. 2 invasion will fail because Saddam Hussein's
economy is self-sufficient in food.
   ``I don't believe Iraq in the short or long run will be
adversely affected by the sanctions,'' he told the caucus, a loose
organization of lawmakers interested in human rights issues.
   Iraq's border with Jordan remains open to truck traffic,
thwarting the trade embargo. And aircraft still land in Amman and
transfer their cargos to trucks, a leak in the new United Nations
air embargo, the ambassador said.
   ``Sanctions will not bring Iraq down to its knees and force it
out of Kuwait,'' he said. But Al-Sabah declined to publicly state
whether he believes the United States should take military action,
saying only: ``you can reach your own conclusions.''
   He said the embargo was being further undermined by the central
banks in other countries who are providing credit lines to Iraq,
although he declined to name the countries in a public hearing.
   ``Saddam Hussein's policy now is to sit tight ... to strengthen
his grip on Kuwait and to outlast the patience of the multinational
forces,'' Al-Sabah said. ``He hopes to break the alliance, and he
believes time is on his side.''
   At a news conference in Cambridge, Mass., Iraq's ambassador to
the United States said allegations of atrocities in Kuwait were ``a
pack of lies.''
   The Iraqi ambassador, Mohammed Mashat, said the United States
was being influenced by ``Israeli expansionist interests.''
   Meanwhile, the leader of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a
grouping of oil-rich countries including Kuwait and Saudi Arabia,
appealed to U.S. officials on Wednesday to attack Saddam before
Kuwait is dismantled.
   The United States, however, wants a political rather than a
military solution to the crisis, said Abdulla Bishara after meeting
with Undersecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz. ``I appealed to the
administration to speed up'' its diplomatic activity, Bishara said
in an interview.
   If diplomacy fails, as it probably will, the United States and
its allies should use force against Saddam. ``We demand the
liberation of Kuwait at any cost - there should be no compromise
with Saddam, no reward.''
   Others who have escaped Kuwait since the invasion described to
the caucus horrors they had witnessed.
   Deborah Hadi, an American who is married to a Kuwaiti, said she
took a cousin who was in labor to a maternity hospital and
encountered a Kuwaiti woman, also in labor, screaming at the front
door because she was not allowed to enter.
   ``When she continued to scream, they put a bayonet through her
stomach, pinning her to the wall,'' Hadi testified.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said there are reports that Saddam is
displacing Kuwait families and moving Iraqi families into their
homes with the intent of later holding a plebiscite to legitimize
his occupation of the country.
   ``We all know it might lead to such phony procedures,'' Al-Sabah
responded.

<HEAD>State Supreme Court Orders Review of Release of Menendez Tapes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two brothers charged with murdering their
millionaire parents for the inheritance money Wednesday won a
rehearing on prosecutors' attempts to use taped conversations the
young men had with a psychologist.
   The state Supreme Court ordered the state Court of Appeal in Los
Angeles to review a decision that prosecutors could listen to the
tapes and use them as evidence against Eric and Joseph Menendez.
   The brothers are accused of killing Jose Menendez, 45, and Mary
Kitty Menendez, 44, with a shotgun at their Beverly Hills mansion
in order to inherit $14 million. Eric, 19, and Joseph, 22, maintain
someone else killed their parents on Aug. 20, 1989.
   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge James Albrecht ruled Aug. 6
that the prosecution was entitled to recordings of the brothers'
October and November 1989 sessions with psychologist L. Jerome
Oziel.
   Conversations between patients and therapists during treatment
normally are confidential, but can be disclosed in some
circumstances when a patient has threatened another person.
   The prosecution argued that the tapes could be released because
Oziel had concluded that the brothers were dangerous and had
disclosed disclosed the brothers' statements to others.
   Lawyers for the brothers argue that Oziel's limited disclosures
had taken care of any danger that existed.
   Leslie Abramson, the attorney for Erik Menendez, said the
Supreme Court ruling was gratifying.
   ``We're not celebrating, but we are relieved that we are getting
a full day in court on this issue,'' she said in Los Angeles.
   The tapes were to have been released to prosecutors and the
public Sept. 4, but were sealed last month while the Supreme Court
decided whether to grant a new hearing.
   Psychologists and psychiatrists from as far away as New York had
called to get information on the ruling because of the case's
potential impact on the issue of medical privacy, Abramson said.

   A white supremacist accused of inciting
the fatal beating of a black man told jurors Wednesday the $10
million wrongful-death lawsuit against him is government
persecution.
   ``This is a stacked deck. There's no doubt about it,'' Tom
Metzger, who is handling his own defense, said during opening
arguments. ``Understand that I am a radical figure and I've had to
fight the government from the get-go.''
   Metzger, 52, of Fallbrook, Calif., is the leader of White Aryan
Resistance and a former Ku Klux Klan grand dragon.
   The lawsuit was filed by Engedaw Berhanu, the uncle of an
African man slain by neo-Nazi ``skinheads'' in November 1988. It
alleges that Metzger incited the slaying by sending a
representative to Portland to preach hate and violence.
   ``It doesn't have that much to do with Mr. Berhanu,'' Metzger
said of the trial. ``This is an insult to my intelligence.''
   But attorney Morris Dees, of the Southern Poverty Law Center in
Montgomery, Ala., told the Multnomah County circuit jury evidence
would link Metzger to the slaying of Mulugeta Seraw.
   He described Metzger as a ``pathetic'' man whose business is
hate and whose agenda is to ``set about training these young
skinheads to go out and do violence.''
   ``In America, we have the right to hate, but we don't have the
right to hurt,'' Dees said. ``We're going to ask you to return a
verdict so big, that on the south border of the state of Oregon
there's going to be a wall $10 million high that's going to stop
Tom Metzger from coming back to this good state.''
   Dees said a vice president of White Aryan Resistance met with
Portland skinheads minutes before they attacked Seraw, 27, of
Ethiopia.
   In their meeting with WAR Youth vice president Dave Mazzella,
the skinheads learned techniques to use in assaulting blacks, Dees
said.
   The three - Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steven Strasser -
later pleaded guilty to the attack.
   Seraw was returning home from a party about the time the meeting
ended.
   ``The three walked out ... and stood on the corner about 100
feet away. Kyle Brewster looked up the street and said, `Hey, I see
a nigger. Let's go over there and mess with him,''' Dees said.
   ``They drove directly up in front of Seraw and his friends. They
drove so close these Ethiopians could not go around them. Then they
did what they had been taught,'' he said.
   Seraw was beaten to death with a baseball bat, which ``came down
on his head with such force ... it just took the whole top of his
head off.''
   Metzger said his views are radical, but he denied advocating
violence and said his police recor is clean.
   ``They may not like his views, but they've never ever found Tom
Metzger going over the line,'' he said.
   Metzger said he would not call witnesses to refute the
plaintiff's contention that he commands legions because he has no
legions.
   Mieske, who admitting beating Seraw with a baseball bat,
testified Wednesday that Mazzella visited him and made a telephone
call to Metzger a month before Seraw's slaying.
   He said he kicked Seraw in the head with a pair of steel-toed
boots he bought from another WAR member.
   Mieske also said that he telephoned Metzger the day he was
arrested and spoke to an associate of Metzger several times after
he was imprisoned.
   Also named as defendants in the lawsuit are Metzger's son John,
22, Mieske and Brewster.
   Mieske was sentenced to life with a 20-year minimum, Brewster to
10 to 20 years and Strasser, who was convicted of beating one of
the other Ethiopians, to 20 years.

<HEAD>Kent State President When Students Were Killed Dies at 81</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENT, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert L. White, president of Kent State
University when National Guardsmen killed four students during an
anti-war protest there in 1970, died Wednesday at age 81.
   White died at Robinson Memorial Hospital in Ravenna.
   White was president of Kent State from 1963 to 1971. He was a
teacher or administrator there for 44 years until his retirement in
1975.
   By 1970, five years after U.S. combat troops joined the Vietnam
War, anti-war demonstrations were mounting on the nation's
campuses. At a protest at Kent State on May 4 of that year,
Guardsmen called in by Kent Mayor Leroy Satrom opened fire on
demonstrators, killing four and wounding nine.
   The shootings stunned the nation. A photograph of an anguished
14-year-old girl kneeling over one of the victims came to symbolize
the era.
   White urged protesters and their critics to remain calm.
   ``I hear lunacy on the one side and frightening repressions on
the other and I don't hear from that traditional center position
that says, `Let us discuss fully and without limits and let us come
to a decision and conclusion within orderly processes which are in
themselves subject to orderly change,''' he said at the time.
   White named a 28-member campus panel to review the shootings and
to recommend ways to avoid more violence. He also urged President
Nixon to appoint a national panel to look into the causes of unrest
at Kent State and other colleges. Nixon did so a month later.
   White, born in Elgin, Ill., received bachelor of philosophy,
master of arts and doctor of philosophy degrees from the University
of Chicago and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, the academic honor
society.
   He taught elementary school in Thornton, Ill., and high school
in Chicago and was a principal in Orland Park, Ill., and a visiting
associate professor at the University of Chicago.
   He joined the Kent State staff as dean of the college of
education and later became a vice president.

   Delegates to the governing
Conservative Party's annual conference, angered by a new IRA
offensive and by government failure to stem rising crime, on
Wednesday demanded the return of the death penalty.
   But Home Secretary David Waddington instead promised life
sentences that ``in the worst cases will mean life.'
   Like Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Waddington supports
capital punishment but is regularly outvoted in Parliament.
   ``This government will not flag in its determination to see that
the monstrous evil of the IRA does not prevail,'' Waddington told
the 5,000 delegates on the second day of the party's four-day
conference in this south England resort.
   The delegates met under unprecedented security following Irish
Republican Army attacks this year which included a July 30 car bomb
that killed legislator Ian Gow, a close political aide of Mrs.
Thatcher. An attempt was foiled last month to kill a government
minister by planting a bomb at a London conference.
   Mrs. Thatcher, seated alongside Waddington, applauded delegates
who urged restoration of capital punishment and demanded tougher
anti-crime measures.
   Britain and most other Western European nations abolished
capital punishment in the mid-60s. Attempts to restore it have been
regularly defeated in the House of Commons. It is an issue on which
legislators are allowed to ``free'' vote - according to conscience
and not on party lines.
   Besides the IRA's bomb and bullet campaign against British rule
in Northern Ireland, the issue of civil law and order is among the
most sensitive for the Conservatives.
   Mrs. Thatcher came to power 11 years ago on a platform that
included pledges to crack down on crime.
   But despite a 60 percent increase in spending on police forces,
crime rates has risen, including a 17 percent increase in reported
crime in the last four months.
   Riots have also hit British prisons, among the most overcrowded
in Europe.
   Waddington said the government would introduce a 10-year maximum
jail sentence for prison mutiny, reduce remissions and parole, and
introduce electronic tagging to keep track of people on parole or
doing community service sentences.

   Tropical Storm Marco thundered toward Florida's
Gulf Coast with increased strength Wednesday evening.
   Forecasters said the storm could crash ashore by morning.
   By 10 p.m. EDT, Marco's top winds had increased to 65 mph and
the storm had picked up speed, charging north across the Gulf of
Mexico at 10 mph, twice as fast as two hours earlier.
   That could put landfall somewhere in the area between Fort Myers
and Sarasota before dawn Thursday, Zimmer said.
   ``We're prepared, as prepared as we're going to be,'' Sanibel
Marina owner Myton Ireland said after hauling nine boats, all 40
feet or longer, onto land. ``If we wait too late and then it blows
hard, we're in trouble.''
   At 10 p.m., Marco's center was located near 26.2 north latitude,
82.4 west longitude, about 45 miles southwest of Fort Myers.
Forecasters said they expected it to maintain its direction.
   Marco's winds weren't expected to reach the hurricane threshold
of 74 mph, said forecaster Bob Case.
   ``Coastal flooding and beach erosion will probably be the main
problem that it will produce,'' he said. ``The further north the
system goes, the closer it will get to the coast.''
   Marco's southwest winds were expected to push tides 1 to 3 feet
above normal, scour the coast's sandy beaches and dump 3 or more
inches of rain in some sections.
   Storm warnings were in effect from the Dry Tortugas through Key
Largo, including Florida Bay, and northward along the Southwest
Florida coast to Cedar Key at the southern edge of the Big Bend
region.
   All Red Cross chapters on the Gulf Coast from the Keys to
Panhandle were on alert and ready to open shelters, said state
disaster specialist Karen Wescott. Emergency management planner Don
Reed said two shelters were already being opened in Bradenton to
house voluntary evacuees from low-lying areas.
   Marco's wind was expected to push tides 1 to 3 feet above
normal, scour the coast's sandy beaches and dump 3 or more inches
of rain in some sections.
   By early afternoon, Miami already had 4.5 inches from Marco and
the Atlantic remnants of Tropical Storm Klaus, which was absorbed
when its much stronger cousin formed Wednesday north of Cuba, Case
said.
   A houseboat broke its mooring in Miami's blustery Biscayne Bay.
It was lassoed at a private dock but broke loose again and the wind
pushed it ashore.
   In the Keys, trucks and vans were advised to stay off the
bridges connecting the islands because of gusts. Key West reported
wind gusting to 38 mph, and 36-mph gusts were recorded on the reefs
off Marathon.
   Pinellas County, with the county seat in coastal Clearwater,
activated its emergency operations center as a precaution because
of past experience with unpredictable tropical storms. The state
Division of Emergency Management followed suit at its Tallahassee
center.
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Lili was racing west across the
central north Atlantic at nearly 21 mph, forecasters said. At 6
p.m., the storm had wind up to 65 mph and was centered about 600
miles east of Bermuda, near 31.3 north latitude and 54.5 west
longitude.
   Marco is the 13th named storm of Atlantic season, which runs
from June through November. Five have built into hurricanes.

   The state resurrected the memory of the
first black to win a statewide election in Kansas by hanging a
portait of Edward P. McCabe in the Capitol Wednesday on the 140th
anniversary of his birth.
   About 500 people gathered in the rotunda as Lt. Gov. Jack Walker
hung a portrait of McCabe, who served as state auditor in 1883-87.
   McCabe is the first black to have his portait among the many
that hang in the Kansas Capitol.
   ``I see how far as black Americans we have to go,'' said Horace
Peterson III, the executive director of the Black Archives of
Mid-America in Kansas City, Mo. ``We're going to keep on erecting
great paintings and statues to our leaders.''
   A local activist, Sonny Scroggins, organized the ceremony, which
included more than two hours of speeches and music.
   McCabe, who was born in Troy, N.Y., settled in northwest Kansas
in 1878 and was prominent in efforts to bring blacks west.
   Angela Bates, president of the Nicodemus Historical Society,
said McCabe was a strong man who refused to be daunted by
prejudice. McCabe ran successfully as a Republican for auditor in
1882, then won re-election in 1884.
   He later moved to Oklahoma and started a movement to persuade
blacks to move west to make it a black state. Although the movement
failed, it led to the establishment of several black towns,
including Langston, Okla., where historically black Langston
University is located.
   McCabe died in Chicago in 1920.

   Iraq complained to the United Nations on
Wednesday that Washington has frozen its bank accounts, barred
special aircraft flights by its foreign minister, and restricted
the movements of Iraqi envoys.
   Iraqi envoy Adnan Malik did not mention during his appearance
before the Committee on Relations with the Host County that the
Security Council has denounced Baghdad for violating international
law on hostage-taking and for violating the immunity of diplomatic
compounds.
   The U.S. delegate on the committee, James Wilkinson, called the
complaints ``misguided and misdirected.''
   Malik said the Bush adminstration barred Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz from flying to New York on his special Iraqi Airways plane. He
said the flight was needed for security reasons.
   Wilkinson said U.S. restrictions on Iraqi flights stemmed from
the Security Council's economic embargo on Iraq and occupied
Kuwait. He said Aziz could have come to New York on any commercial
flight, as did 90 other foreign ministers.
   ``It is ironic that Iraqi should cite security threats as a
reason for special arrangements, especially since Iraq increasingly
sponsors terrorist groups and their use of the public media,''
Wilkinson said.
   He said limiting Iraqi diplomats to a 25-mile radius of New York
City was appropriate ``in view of the Iraqi government's action not
to allow the unrestricted travel of foreign nationals in Iraq.''
   Baghdad holds hundreds of Western hostages at strategic sites as
``human shields'' to prevent any U.S. attack in Iraq.
   Malik said U.S. freezing of Iraqi assets and banks accounts is
hindering the work of its U.N. Mission.
   Wilkinson said Washington would try to work out necessary steps
so the Iraqi Mission could continue to function at the United
Nations.

   Two weeks from the end of its two-year term,
the 101st Congress has little to brag about and much to do.
   The preoccupation with getting a budget has backed up other
important legislation on subjects ranging from clean air and
housing to civil rights and child care.
   With anti-incumbent sentiment running high across the country,
no member of Congress wants to face voters having done little more
than approve job protection rights for the disabled, an inadequate
savings and loan bailout and a congressional pay raise.
   ``It's been a thin session so far, there's no question about
it,'' said Thomas Mann, who studies Congress for the Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank.

   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel's police minister says he wants an
independent probe of the Temple Mount killings, in which troops
have been accused of using excessive force in trying to quell a
riot by rock-throwing Palestinians.
   Israel radio said Tuesday night that Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir had agreed to appoint such an investigation team.
   Israeli security forces killed 19 Arabs and wounded 140 in
Monday's clash outside the Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest
site. It was the bloodiest of a 34-month old Palestinian uprising
against Israeli occupation and raised an immediate world outcry.
   The U.N. Security Council on Tuesday debated a resolution
condemning the shootings and President Bush criticized Israeli
forces for not acting ``with more restraint.''
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court, a day after welcoming
Justice David H. Souter to the bench, is taking up a sex bias
dispute that could affect millions of working women.
   The justices were to hear arguments today over the legality of a
``fetal protection'' policy under which an employer excludes all
women of childbearing age from some hazardous jobs.
   The court, expected to be closely divided on the issue, will
decide by July whether the policy amounts to illegal sex
discrimination.
   Souter, who sat silently through four cases argued before the
court Tuesday, could find himself a pivotal vote in this one.

   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - Thousands of bargain hunters snatched
up everything from all-terrain vehicles to animal shampoo on the
first day of an Alaska-size garage sale offering gear from the
Exxon Valdez cleanup.
   Locals grumbled that out-of-town businessmen with plenty of
money in their pockets and a need to justify their jaunts to Alaska
helped drive up prices Tuesday.
   ``It's a feeding frenzy,'' said Butch Johnson, a fisherman in
search of nets who lives in the Prince William Sound fishing
community of Cordova.
   Everything on the opening-day block was sold, including a plane,
mobile homes, TV sets and cat box filler, used to provide traction
on oily beaches.

   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - Republican Gov. Kay Orr and President Bush
face the same problem. Both promised they would oppose tax
increases, and both went back on their word.
   In Mrs. Orr's case, the issue could cost her the November
election to Democratic challenger Ben Nelson, who has been leading
in the polls.
   After giving voters a no-new-taxes pledge, Mrs. Orr became the
first woman governor in Nebraska history and the first Republican
woman ever elected to a governorship. Following her 1986 election,
she endorsed a 1987 overhaul of the state's income tax system.
   She then denied for 18 months that it had resulted in a tax
increase.

<TEXT>
   After two months in which military
officials marveled at the low rate of accidents among American
forces in Saudi Arabia, a sudden spate of air crashes has left four
dead and eight missing.
   The official death toll for Operation Desert Shield rose to 24
on Wednesday when an Air Force F-111 fighter-bomber crashed on a
training mission in the Arabian Peninsula, killing both crew
members, U.S. military spokesmen said.
   The plane was the fourth U.S. military aircraft involved an
accident in three days. But an Air Force spokesman, Capt. Jack
Giese, said there was no single factor linking the crashes.
   A summary issued by the U.S. Command on Wednesday said 23
Americans had been killed in accidents and one Marine died of a
self-inflicted wound since the deployment began following Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ---&equals;
   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel on Wednesday appointed a panel headed by
a former spy chief to investigate the killing of 19 Palestinians in
a riot on the Temple Mount. It also rejected U.S. charges that
police used excessive force.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government urged Jews to gather
at the Wailing Wall at the end of the religious festival of Sukkot
on Thursday in a show of defiance of the Arab stoning attack that
prompted the bloodbath.
   To block further violence, the army kept more than 1 million
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip confined to
their homes by curfews. In Jerusalem, police fired tear gas to
break up at least five protests by Palestinians.
   In Jordan, protests by thousands of Jordanian and Palestinian
university students continued for the third day Wednesday.

   EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) - Shuttle Discovery sailed
out of orbit and landed Wednesday after a four-day flight that
boosted NASA's confidence and sent a spacecraft on a five-year
mission to explore the sun's poles.
   ``If you criticize our mistakes, then you must also acknowledge
our successes,'' space shuttle director and former astronaut Robert
Crippen said after completion of the first shuttle flight in nearly
six months.
   Discovery's 1.7 million-mile flight was the first since April -
the longest gap between shuttle missions since they resumed after
the 1986 explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed seven crew
members.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Three of the Supreme Court's nine justices
gave a chilly reception Wednesday to an employer's ``fetal
protection'' policy that excludes women of childbearing age from
some hazardous jobs.
   In a case that could affect millions of working women, Justices
John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia voiced
doubts about the wisdom and legality of such a policy.
   The court is expected to decide by July whether the policy
amounts to illegal sex discrimination.
   The three justices, along with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy,
dominated an hourlong argument session. They posed numerous
questions to the two lawyers before them, firing their most biting
inquiries at Stanley Jaspan, who represented the Milwaukee-based

   BOSTON (AP) - Sit back and enjoy another cup of full-powered,
extra-kick caffeinated coffee. A major new study concludes your
morning brew is almost certainly harmless to your heart. Decaf,
though, may be another story.
   Contrary to the fears of many doctors and coffee lovers, coffee
with a get-you-going jolt of caffeine seems to be perfectly safe,
as far as the heart is concerned. However, the study found
troubling hints that people who drink lots of decaffeinated coffee
may somewhat increase their risk of heart trouble.
   ``This study means that if there is a hazard with drinking
caffeinated coffee, it's going to be very small, and there may be
none at all,'' said Dr. Walter Willett, who directed the study at
the Harvard School of Public Health.
   While the wisdom of very high coffee consumption is
questionable, several experts agree that three or four cups a day
of typical American coffee are safe for virtually everybody, even
those with heart disease.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Declaring that the time for foot dragging has
ended, federal safety officials issued Wednesday a list of 18
``most wanted'' safety improvements in air, sea and land
transportation.
   The proposed improvements range from development of an
air-collision avoidance system to adoption of state laws permitting
uniformed police officers to confiscate drivers' licenses on the
spot when drivers fail or refuse tests to detect alcohol.
   The National Transportation Safety Board list seeks to spur
movement by regulatory agencies, industries, and state and local
governments to implement recommendations made by the board over the
last two decades. The safety board has no actual enforcement power.
It can only identify possible safety improvements and recommend
they be implemented.

<TEXT>
   Whether democracy wins or not, this
month's elections will be costly for an economy already weakened by
higher oil prices, analysts and economists say.
   ``The losses to the economy may run into billions of rupees in
terms of wasteful campaign expenditure and lost business,'' said
economist Hussain Mullick.
   Campaign spending has been estimated at up to $1.35 billion and
conducting the elections will cost the government about $15
million.
   Elections for the National Assembly, the lawmaking lower house
of Parliament, are scheduled for Oct. 24. Provincial legislatures
in Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan and Northwest Frontier provinces will
be chosen three days later.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto and dissolved the National Asesembly on Aug. 6. He accusaed
Ms. Bhutto's government of plundering the treasury and abusing its
constitutional and administrative powers during 20 months in
office.
   The 37-year-old former prime minister and several of her Cabinet
ministers face charges before special tribunals.
   Prime Minister Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi's caretaker government
accuses Ms. Bhutto of allowing 20 billion rupees ($900 million) in
bank loans to relatives and friends, as political patronage, with
little or no collateral.
   It alleges the Bhutto government spent $30 million for what
Ishaq Khan called ``horse-trading,'' to insure victory in a
November 1989 no-confidence vote.
   Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party and its main opponent, the
Islamic Democratic Alliance, are contending for 217 seats in the
National Assembly and 483 in the provincial legislatures.
   ``You need money to throw all around to win a seat, be it money
from gun-runners, heroin barons or smugglers,'' said Afzal Sindhu,
a leader of her party and a former National Assembly member.
   He estimated each candidate spent about $114,000 in the 1988
election in addition to money donated by friends and relatives.
   Most political observers and candidates estimate the cost per
candidate this time at about $180,000.
   The campaign can pump an extra 2.5 billion rupees ($1.15
million) into the economy in less than four weeks, and ``that is a
lot of money to push prices up in an economy of a trillion
rupees,'' Mullick said.
   Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said Pakistan's annual inflation
rate was in double digits, and independent economists put it at
more than 15 percent.
   Factories and farms, transport and telecommunications, trade and
industry either halt or slow dramatically when millions of workers
become preoccupied with rallies and campaigns.
   Pakistan's economy already suffers from the higher oil prices
caused by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Aziz said Pakistan uses 180,000 barrels of oil a day, 120,000 of
it imported, and ``our oil bill may go up by $900 milllion a
year.''
   He said Pakistan also was losing $300 million a year from
Pakistanis working in Kuwait and Iraq and $100 million in trade.
   About 85,000 Pakistanis worked in Kuwait and 10,000 in Iraq
until the Iraqi invasion of the Persian Gulf emirate on Aug. 2.
Nearly 60,000 have been repatriated so far.

<HEAD>Swiss Women Face Prejudice in Army and Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARE NULLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifty years after the first women
joined Switzerland's army, some old guard commanders still order
them to make coffee.
   The 3,000 women doing military service also risk criticism from
family and friends, and prejudice from employers unwilling to give
them paid leave for regular refresher training.
   Brig. Gen. Eugenie Pollack puts discrimination and male
chauvinism high on the list of obstacles she has encountered since
becoming chief of the Women's Military Service last year.
   She is a soft-spoken, determined woman who raised eyebrows in
conservative army circles this summer by marrying her long-time
companion. He is a lawyer who works for environmental causes, she
said in an interview at her headquarters in the Swiss capital.
   Women's reluctance to take the army seriously is more
significant than the sexist comments and attitudes, Pollack said,
and blamed it for the persistent shortage of women volunteers.
   If the brigadier had her way, national service would be
compulsory for all women in this neutral country, with military and
civilian options.
   ``Every woman should have a certain training,'' she said. ``For
example, we should all know how to move into an air raid shelter
and how to cope in a disaster. I do not agree that only men should
have such education.''
   Female volunteers are committed to 117 days of service - four
weeks of basic training and refresher courses of two or three weeks
over several years.
   Basic training for male conscripts in the 625,000-man reserve
force lasts 17 weeks and overall service totals one year.
   Women do not receive weapons training, but the government is
expected to allow them to carry pistols in the near future for
self-defense.
   Pollack said she favors arming women on a voluntary basis and
estimated 50 percent to 70 percent of her volunteers would choose
to carry weapons.
   She added, however, that women never would be used in combat
because it would be politically unacceptable and ``there is no
need.''
   In the past, women soldiers have been confined to medical,
clerical or transport jobs, but now they can work in the
intelligence service, as trainers of rescue dogs and as chaplains.
   Male commanders do not always let women fill positions for which
they are trained, Pollack said.
   ``We have had real problems with some commanders who merely sent
women to make coffee,'' she explained, and described the attitude
as reflective of society in general. Switzerland did not give women
the vote until 1971.
   Much can be learned from other armies, the brigadier said, and
she has invited participants from 11 countries to a three-day
seminar on integrating women into the armed forces. They include
the United States, Canada, Australia, Sweden and Poland.
   Only about 100 women have volunteered for the army this year,
she said, leaving it nearly 1,000 short of the goal of 3,900.
   The East-West thaw has caused interest to flag and the Persian
Gulf crisis seems too distant to have an impact, Pollack said, and
added: ``The irony of the whole business is that you almost have to
wish for a crisis to attract enough people.''
   Switzerland first accepted women into the army in 1940, when it
was a neutral island in German-occupied Europe, and there always
has been a shortage of volunteers.
   If the commander had her way, the women's corps ultimately would
disappear, because ``being utopian, I would like to see women so
integrated that a special female army no longer exists.''

<HEAD>Gambling Sets Utah-Nevada Border Towns Far Apart</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WENDOVER, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white line across the highway is all
that officially comes between Wendover, Utah, and Wendover, Nev.
   But the neighboring towns are worlds apart - divided by the
contrary philosophies of hell-raising Nevada and God-fearing Utah.
   One Wendover an improbable cluster of watered lawns and neon
lights shouting in the lonely sagebrush. Outside the State Line
casino, a 64-foot cowboy named ``Wendover Will'' waves his
mechanical arms, beckoning travelers to a gambler's paradise.
   The travelers - most of them from Utah, where gambling is
illegal - drop enough dollars in Wendover's six casinos to make the
town blossom like a desert rose. Despite Wendover's isolation (Salt
Lake City is 120 miles east, Reno 400 miles west), business is
booming, population is growing, and new homes are sprouting around
the town's new 18-hole golf course.
   There's little new in Utah's Wendover. Its chief attraction is
an abandoned World War II air base with broken windows and empty,
echoing hangars. Junk cars rust along gravel side streets, and
paint peels from dilapidated cottages. When the wind howls in from
the salt flats, the town seems ready to shrivel up and blow away
like a tumbleweed.
   ``We're just like a ghetto,'' said Richard Dixon, a grocer on
the Utah side. ``It's the difference between East Berlin and West
Berlin - only the wall has neer gone down between Wendover, Utah,
and Wendover, Nevada.''
   Since 1988, Dixon and other businessmen in Wendover, Utah, (pop.
1,300) have tried to tear down that wall by lobbying for a local
exemption from Utah's constitutional ban on gambling.
   Without gambling, they say, Wendover will die. Since 1985,
nearly 200 families have moved to a more prosperous life just over
the white line, Dixon said. In the Nevada Wendover (pop. 2,000),
schools are better-funded, and there are no state taxes on food or
personal income.
   It's easy to see why a town living in the shadow of ``Wendover
Will'' would want a cut of the gambling take. But it's also no
surprise that the rest of Utah is cool to the idea.
   Utah and Nevada share a 340-mile border, an arid climate,
political conservatism - and some great differences.
   Some disparities can be traced to their frontier heritage - to
hard-bitten miners who settled Nevada in 1859, lusting after the
mother lode; to Mormons who arrived in Utah in 1847, seeking to
practice their religion in peace.
   Nevada celebrates the reckless frontier spirit in casinos and
bars that never close. No-wait weddings help produce the highest
marriage rate - and highest divorce rate - in the country.
Prostitution is legal in 11 counties.
   Family oriented Utah channels its sexual energies differently,
though no less vigorously. It has the nation's highest birth rate,
lowest abortion rate, largest median family size, and youngest
population.
   Nevadans say they have more fun, but Utahns live longer. Average
life expectancy in Utah is 75.7 years, or three years longer than
in Nevada. An insurance company recently ranked the health of
states based on levels of smoking, accidents, violent crime, and
disease. The results were hardly surprising: Utah was No. 1 for
healthy lifestyles; Nevada was 49th.
   Religion lies at the root of the differences. Utah has more
churchgoers per capita than any state, while Nevada ranks 45th.
More than two-thirds of Utah residents belong to the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly known as the Mormon
Church.
   Mormon theology considers gambling a forbidden vice, and the
state constitution follows suit, banning all games of chance
involving money.
   It is a gauge of Wendover businessmen's determination, then,
that their gambling proposal went as far as it did. They won
supporting resolutions from city and county authorities in 1988 and
even found two state senators - both Mormons - to back a
constitutional amendment.
   That woke up Utah's Mormon-dominated political scene. The
church-owned Deseret News, Utah's second-largest newspaper,
editorialized against the amendment, and early last year, the bill
was unanimously tabled into oblivion by the Senate Business and
Labor Committee.
   ``It's a matter of principle,'' says state Sen. Richard Tempest,
who opposed the amendment. ``Nevada has whorehouses. Do we need
whorehouses to make a living? Somewhere you have to draw the line.
I don't like gambling. It's demeaning and degrading to the human
spirit.''
   Wendover businessmen promise to keep fighting. They point at the
Utah cars streaming across the notorious white line and say
SOMEBODY in Utah obviously likes to gamble.
   But even some gaming Utahns believe that gambling, like a
slot-machine handle, is best kept at arm's length.
   ``I'd just as soon not have gambling in Utah,'' said Mrs. B.
Johnson, 65, of Ogden. She was clutching a cupful of nickels in
front of a poker-slot machine in the State Line casino. ``I just
feel gambling brings a different element into the state.''
   Mrs. Johnson wouldn't give her full name. ``I probably shouldn't
be here,'' she said. ``I'm a Mormon.'' Glancing around at others
feeding the slots, she added, ``But then, I think a lot of them are
Mormons, too.''

<TEXT>
   You can stamp your feet if you want. You can cry,
sulk, even hold your breath until you turn blue. It won't help.
   There is a nanny shortage afoot, and no amount of parental
petulance will ensure that you can hire a nursemaid for your
children.
   ``We can't possibly fill the demand,'' said Cathie Robertson,
president of the International Nanny Association and a
nanny-training instructor at Grossmont Community College near San
Diego.
   For each trained nanny, 25 to 250 families want one, said
Robertson, whose group fields 15 queries daily from parents seeking
more than a sitter or day care. ``People are more willing to pay
for excellent child care,'' she said.
   They certainly do pay.
   Terri Eurich, founder of the National Academy of Nannies Inc. in
Denver, last month placed one graduate with a Connecticut family
that pays $1,400 monthly. Plus major medical coverage. Including
vacation provisions. Also, travel opportunities. ``Those jobs are
out there,'' Eurich said.
   Nationally, average pay ranges from $200 to $300 weekly for
trained, live-in nannies hired by couples who, between the two of
them, earn at least $80,000 yearly, said Donna Dixon, an associate
dean at the Moraine Park Technical College in Fond du Lac, Wis.
   Nanny educators and placement-agency operators are hardly
surprised by the dearth of trained nannies. More than 3.2 million
mothers work outside their homes now. The U.S. Labor Department
predicts that by 1995, 80 percent of women ages 22 to 44 will work
outside the home, representing almost 15 million preschoolers.
   ``There are lots of babies. There are older, wealthier,
dual-income people having babies,'' said Eric Miller, editor of
Research Alert, a Long Island magazine devoted to spotting and
analyzing trends.
   ``Yuppies, as they've aged, buy service almost more than
anything else. They don't like the paltry child care available.
It's a recipe for a nanny,'' Miller said.
   Susan Elsea, a suburban Detroit sales executive for American
Express, considered a day-care center when she was pregnant. She
envisioned wondering: ``Are her diapers changed? Is she by herself
in a corner?'' By the time Carolyn was born seven months ago, she
had decided to hire a nanny.
   ``Day care - absolutely not. I just will not take her out of the
house on those cold, blustery mornings. I wanted her here,'' she
said. Fortunately, she said, she earns enough to pay for it.
   Elsea used an agency rather than a classified ad to find her
nanny. ``The finder's fee is well worth it. The $1,000 was a drop
in the bucket. Time is money. We couldn't have come up with her on
our own,'' she said.
   Agencies and schools, private and public, stress that nannies
must be trained. A textbook is being written now for the fledgling
field, and groups like the International Nanny Association are
pushing standardized courses.
   Training varies from 100-hour courses to two-year college
associate degrees, but experts agree that nannies must know
nutrition, child-care basics like when babies switch to solid
foods, psychological and physical development, safety, telephone
and table etiquette, and how to handle emergencies.
   Robertson said there are at least 68 nanny programs at community
colleges, like hers, and 20 of them are just a year old. There are
at least 15 private schools like Eurich's.
   At least 75,000 nannies have been placed in homes nationwide by
schools or agencies, not including illegal aliens or nannies
without any classroom or practical experience, Robertson said.
   ``I would insist on training, but some families get so desperate
that they don't,'' said Dixon, whose state school has a one-year
program and also offers an associate's degree.
   Linda Hice-Guastella quit law school to open her Nanny Network
Inc. placement agency four years ago. Her applicant screening
includes reference and police checks.
   ``We've come up with drunk driving and disorderly conduct, but
nothing more serious. You have to screen,'' she said. Her clients
tend to be people worried about abuse or neglect at day-care
centers where wages are low, turnover is high and training is often
minimal.
   Nannies placed by her metro Detroit agency earn at least $200
weekly to live in, and up to $450 if they have a nursing
background.
   ``Women can have a `wife' too. They don't have to choose between
their families and jobs,'' Hice-Guastella said.
   The cost isn't necessarily much higher than a day-care center.
   A year of full-day preschool costs $4,200 per child, and up to
$9,000 or more for infants, according to a General Accounting
Office survey of 1988 average costs, the most recent available. For
infant care or nannies shared by families, the cost is comparable,
said Barbara Willer of the National Association for the Education
of the Young, a Washington, D.C., advocacy and professional
association for child-care workers.
   Barbara Taylor, president of the National Association for Family
Day Care in Washington, D.C., makes the case for organized day
care: Children in day care ``get structure and the stimulation of
playmates,'' she said.
   Day-care workers generally earn less than live-in nannies, whose
compensation includes room and board. Yet people aren't flooding
the field.
   Eurich says some prospective nannies are worried that they'll
end up being maids, or by publicized cases in which child-care
workers are accused of abusing their charges.
   Carol Emrich, the coordinator of Delta College's nanny training
program, receives about 100 inquiries monthly from families seeking
nannies. The two-semester program has eight students, although she
expects more in the winter term. ``It's just real important to
stress the opportunities.''
   ``It's hard to recruit students. We have 30 to 40 (jobs) for
every graduate,'' Dixon said.

<HEAD>Warning Cry Found Stirring Churches Toward Recovery</HEAD>

   Alongside a chapel at Louisville Presbyterian Theological
Seminary in Kentucky stands a brass sculpture of a crowing rooster
- an ancient Christian symbol of warning. Some say it is relevant
for today's mainline Protestantism.
   A repeated cock's crow signaled the apostle Peter's denial of
the arrested Jesus before his crucifixion, and a new study says
``the rooster's poignant cry of caution'' now echoes in some church
conditions.
   But the study also detected signs of surmounting the
difficulties.
   The situation in historic Protestantism is described as
``decline, malaise, division and demise,'' a weakening that has
toppled the old mainline churches from holding sway over American
culture.
   Involved is ``an epochal change in American religion that has
occurred during the 20th century,'' says the first volume of the
planned seven-volume study of the problem and responses to it.
   Old-line denominations - Presbyterians, Episcopalians,
Methodists, Congregationalists (now United Church), Disciples and
American Baptists - are said to ``have been displaced - religiously
and culturally - to a significant degree.''
   All have suffered severe membership losses and serious
theological strains, while all have shifted emphasis from
devotionalism toward social justice and struggled over
institutional organization, sapping energies, the study says.
   It adds that nevertheless, ``they remain influential voices in
the spectrum of American religion and retain an enduring vitality
in the face of a massive reconfiguration of American religious
life.''
   More than 60 researchers at seminaries, colleges and
universities throughout the country took part in the study.
Financed by the Lilly Endowment, it focused on the Presbyterian
Church (U.S.A.) as a case study.
   The ``developments within one tradition - American
Presbyterianism - are mirrored in other denominations as well,''
says the first volume, ``The Presbyterian Predicament,'' published
by Westminster-John Knox Press.
   The Rev. John M. Mulder, Louisville Presbyterian Theological
Seminary president, who heads the project, said it was the most
extensive research ever into any Protestant body.
   He said the study turned up developing processes in mainstream
``religious life that make this one of the most interesting and
exciting periods in American religious history.''
   ``We're at a point where the church is beginning to define
itself in a new situation in which it has new competitors both in
society and in non-Christian alternative religions,'' Mulder said.
   ``It's very clear that American culture no longer supports and
reinforces the church. But in facing new competitors, it is finding
new resources. The church is being called back to its basic
identity, to what it believes, to the difference it makes in
lives.''
   Terming this an ``important turning point'' for the churches, he
added in an interview: ``Today churches have lost their cultural
recognition. They now are being challenged to be the church, to be
Christian, to define their identity over against secularity, to be
religious in the best sense of the word.''
   The seven-volume series is being publishes under the general
title of ``The Presbyterian Presence: The 20th Century
Experience.'' Two more volumes, ``The Mainstream Protestant
`Decline' '' and ``The Confessional Mosaic,'' are coming out this
fall. Two additional volumes are due next spring and two next fall.
   Mulder said the findings point both to the causes of the
languishing of mainline denominations and to means for overcoming
it. He said the findings also indicate such a recovery is under
way.
   ``There's a resurgence of the moderate center, the huge majority
of church people who are tired of denominational policy being
determined by extreme groups, left or right,'' he said.
   This is dispelling past factional polarization that has
afflicted churches, retrieving vitality expended in those fights,
he said. ``The people who have remained silent in controvery have
finally begun to assert themselves.''
   He cited these other positive signs:
   - New church development, a lack of which has been a major
factor in a quarter century of denominational decline, is being
re-emphasized with a surge of new congregations in the old
Protestant bodies.
   - Baby boomers, born in the decade after World War II, are
beginning to return to church participation, after generally
shunning it in the 1970s and early 1980s.
   - Congregations that suffered severe declines, particularly in
urban areas, are showing a ``kind of elasticity and vitality that
almost defies destruction. Congregations once considered dead are
coming back to life.''
   Mulder said mainstream denominations also now see a need for
each to ``forge a theological identity that is persuasive and
distinctive,'' that characterizes each denomination's special
contributions to the ``larger Christian family.''
   ``They are all committed to ecumenism,'' he said. They recognize
the fuller Christian totality, he added, but now are clarifying
their particular ``vision and insights'' in it, rather than
diluting those values.

   The Church of the Brethren, one of the
historic peace churches, has urged people to observe an ``oil-free
Sunday'' on Oct. 21 to focus attention on the nation's dependence
on foreign oil.
   Alternate means of transportation to fuel-powered vehicles were
recommended - walking, bicycling or using mass transit.
   The Persian Gulf crisis is over oil resources, and ``in this
case it is clear that our nation is willing to go to war to keep
the oil flowing,'' said David Radcliff, the church's peace
consultant.
   ``From a Brethren point of view, all war is wrong. In this
particular case, we are committed to making whatever lifestyle
sacrifices are necessary to stop the country from going to war.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Cardinal John O'Connor told worshippers at St.

   CHANTILLY, France (AP) - An assembly of the World Student
Christian Federation says it rejoices at the end of the Cold War
and the ``new possibilities for humankind to tackle the scourge of
hunger, illiteracy and poverty.''
   But the students from many lands added that ``a new wall seems
to begin to be erected between those rich countries which control
and dilapidate a disproportionate share of the planet's resources
and wealth, and those poor countries that have in common their
powerlessness and poverty.''
   The message terms the ecumenical movement a ``new and miraculous
gift of God'' in which his spirit is ``driving us to work for the
reunion of our churches.''

   WILSON, N.C. (AP) - Atlantic Christian College has been renamed
Barton College, partly to keep it from being considered as strictly
a religious institution.
   The new namesake, Barton W. Stone, was a 19th century founder of
the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), which started the
college in 1902.
   The college said that ``to envision this private, four-year
liberal arts college as a church-controlled, ultraconservative
Bible college is wrong,'' but the new name still preserves the
church antecedants.

   OSLO, Norway (AP) - The recently adopted Oslo Declaration says
that ``because hatred is willed by man, God himself is unable to

   This ``ancient scourge, whose origins remain hidden in
darkness,'' strikes all races, religions, political systems and
classes, says the declaration of political and moral leaders who
met about modern currents of hate.
   Czechoslovakia's president, Vaclav Havel, said that ``in the
subconscious of the haters there slumbers a perverse feeling that
they alone are the true possessors of truth.''

   ATLANTA (AP) - Former Atlanta Archbishop Eugene A. Marino, who
resigned after Roman Catholic officials learned of his two-year
sexual relationship with a woman, is in ``a structured program of
psychological and spiritual renewal'' in the Midwest, family
members say.
   Six of Marino's siblings gave their report on the former
archbishop in a letter addressed to Atlanta Catholics in the
Georgia Bulletin, the archdiocesan newspaper. The letter says he
will remain in the Midwestern program ``until he is ready to accept
a new assignment.''

<HEAD>The Man Behind the Beatific Look of ``Avalon''</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Entertainment Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When immigrant Sam Krichinsky arrived in
Baltimore in 1914, he says at the opening of the movie ``Avalon,''
it was the most beautiful place he had ever seen.
   If audiences share Krichinsky's memory, they can thank Allen
Daviau. As the film's director of photography, Daviau was charged
with transforming director Barry Levinson's rich script into
equally evocative images.
   Perhaps no scene in ``Avalon'' reveals Daviau's artistry more
than that first scene in which Krichinsky (Armin Mueller-Stahl
portraying Levinson as a young man) lands in Electric Park, a 1914
exposition re-created for the film by production designer Norman
Reynolds.
   As the first reel unspools, something looks off. As Krichinsky
moves through Electric Park, decorated with 18,000 lights, his body
movements are slightly jumpy and the colors overly rich. He walks
at normal speed, and yet it is clear we are not watching his actual
arrival. It is instead Krichinsky's recollection of it.
   ``This is a very abstract, stylized, idealized memory he's
having of brilliant lights,'' said Daviau, whose cinematography won
Academy Award nominations for Steven Spielberg's ``E.T. the
Extra-Terrestrial,'' ``The Color Purple'' and ``Empire of the
Sun.''
   ``One of the things Barry said was, `We have to find a way to
distance the past sequences from the present of 1948,' '' Daviau
said. To avoid cinematic cliches, he declined to use filtration or
sepia toning.
   What Daviau (pronounced Dav'-ee-ow) did instead was film at 18
frames per second, as opposed to the standard 24 frames. He then
``stretch-printed'' the film, using every other frame twice.
   ``It's missing a third of the information that our 24-frame-per
second mind is used to seeing, and it's being restored in an
artificial way,'' Daviau said. ``We've seen stretch printing in
silent films for many, many years. The difference is, you haven't
seen it in color.''
   Daviau first used the technique making a bank commercial several
years ago. He still alternates between commercials and feature
films.
   ``It's the best mixture in the world,'' he said, ``because
commercials keep you busy, they keep you in practice, they make you
a lot of money and you meet a lot of directors who are on their way
to doing pictures.
   ``Working in commercials allows you to be choosy about what
movies you do. . . . What I was really looking to do happened when
`Avalon' came along.
   ``I really am fascinated with the '40s,'' Daviau said. ``I got
to deal with a period that I remember quite well.''
   The movie spans 50 years, detailing the lives of the
Krinchinskys - Levinson's famil - and the world in which they
live.
   Daviau started as a still photographer, photo lab technician and
theatrical lighting designer. During the mid-1960s, he photographed
rock promotional films with Jimi Hendrix, Aretha Franklin and The
Who. Other feature credits include ``The Falcon and the Snowman''
and ``Defending Your Life.'' In 1988, the American Society of
Cinematographers voted him best cinematographer in feature films.
   Levinson and Spielberg both are visual directors, Daviau said,
but have different styles.
   ``Steven is much more interested in the design of the shot; the
graphics are very, very important to him,'' Daviau said. ``Barry is
a visual director, by all means, but it's a different emphasis. He
loves the compositions.''
   The cinematographer's job is a curious one.
   ``It's really a case of choosing to make your presence known.
And you pick a look for a film and then you're out to make that
look fit,'' Daviau said.
   ``There are certain things that general audiences may notice
about photography that are not the things you do. A lot of times,
we're credited with scenery. The things we really do are things
that people rarely notice. Most of our work is lighting, color,
texture.
   ``One of the greatest things that you do in cinematography is
you guide the audiences's eye to where it should be. You're giving
emphasis where it's desired.
   ``I don't think I would ever want to be known as every film I
have looking the same or somebody saying, `Oh! Daviau did that for
sure.' I'd much rather shape the look to the individual film.''
   In ``Avalon,'' he said, certain details demanded to be examined
closely.
   ``I looked at Armin Mueller-Stahl's face and in a second I saw
those eyes. This is one of the most remarkable faces I've ever been
given to photograph.''
   For the Thanksgiving dinner scenes in ``Avalon,'' Daviau bathed
the interiors with warm, comfortable light; pouring in from outside
windows is cold, blue light.
   Near the film's end, Sam Krichinsky settles into a chair to read
a newspaper. A few seconds later, when he arises, he's aged 10
years. The framing of both shots is identical. There is no jump in
the image, even though the two scenes were done more than a week
apart. So seamless is the transition that some in the audience
don't notice for several moments that Krichinsky's grown old.
   And that, for Daviau, is photography at its best.

<HEAD>Foreign Actors Help Norwegians Come to Terms With Ibsen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG MELLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The national theater has imported talent
from as far away as New Zealand to get Norwegians to stop ignoring
Henrik Ibsen, their country's greatest writer.
   Theater director Stein Winge said this month's first
international Ibsen festival was a belated attempt to make up for
Norway's ``scandalous neglect'' of the 19th-century dramatist.
   Actors from New Zealand, Ireland, England, Sweden and Norway
have been helping to reconcile Norwegians with Ibsen, 84 years
after the playwright's death in Oslo.
   There is nothing new in Norwegians neglecting Ibsen, often
called modern theater's most influential figure.
   His early plays were ignored or met with such hostility in
Norway that Ibsen fled to Italy and then Germany, for 27 years of
self-imposed exile.
   ``Ibsen didn't especially like Norway,'' said Winge. But he
wrote in Norwegian and said that to understand his work, one had to
know his country's severe beauty, isolation and introspective
people.
   Ibsen's socially realistic dramas examined such themes as
venereal disease, alcoholism, incest and insanity, all shocking and
forbidden topics in his era.
   When Sigmund Freud, the Austrian father of psychoanalysis, was a
9-year-old, Ibsen was already exploring the human psyche in plays
later described as psychoanalysis in dramatic form.
   Shock has faded into apathy among modern Norway's liberal,
easygoing people, said Winge. Oslo's Aftenposten nwwspaper said
most consider reading Ibsen a drudgery to endure as a student.
   His fans, a minority, are so awed by Ibsen that they are timid
in exploring his work, said Winge. ``We have made him a museum
piece. . . . We experience what we expect Ibsen to be. We need to
be presented with what other cultures see in our poet to open the
door and get him out of the museum.''
   A recent festival brought outsiders to Oslo's National Theater
to help blow off the dust from Ibsen.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis, who wants to lead his
Baltic republic out of the Soviet Union, attended the opening
ceremony and said, ``I connect Ibsen's name, his work and his ideas
with strong thoughts of freedom which have reached a deep meaning
for people in Lithuania.''
   Winge said he did not know why the National Theater waited
nearly a century to arrange the festival. The theater claims to be
Ibsen's home, because he invested in it and attended its 1899
opening.
   ``It should have been done a long time ago,'' said Winge. His
first act after being appointed theater director in January was to
establish the annual festival.
   Modern Norwegians may have been shocked by New Zealand's
Downstage Theater setting the 1890 play, ``Hedda Gabler,'' in the
1950s. One Oslo newspaper grumbled at a Harley Davidson motorcycle
being on the stage.
   Purists probably raised their eyebrows over ``Peer Gynt'' being
performed as a ballet by London's ABC dance company or by masked
actors in a fairy tale version by the Kalmar, Sweden, city theater.
   Winge, however, was pleased by such experimentation. ``I think
Ibsen would have approved,'' he said.
   The theater groups performed 11 plays, many in English, from
Ibsen's three periods.
   From his first period, the festival offered a performance of the
1866 tragedy ``Brand,'' and three versions of ``Peer Gynt'' from
1867.
   His best-known period, when Ibsen rebelled against social
conventions, was illustrated at the festival with such plays as
``Hedda Gabler,'' ``A Doll's House'' and ``Ghosts,'' performed by
the Belfast, Northern Ireland's Lyric Theater.
   Finally, he wrote strongly symbolic plays.
   ``Ever since `A Doll's House' had its breakthrough on the
European stage, Ibsen was more successful abroad (than at home).
It's a tradition we have maintained until the present,'' said
Vigdis Ystad, a Norwegian university professor and Ibsen scholar.
   Ystad, attending a two-day Ibsen symposium, said many foreigners
know more than Norwegians about Ibsen's ability to illustrate
life's big issues through simple human conflicts.
   ``We owe it to our writer, country and the world to be the best
in Ibsen research,'' said Ystad in a newspaper interview. She urged
parliament to fund an Ibsen center in Norway.
   Ibsen's star may finally be rising in Norway. Oslo newspapers
extensively covered the festival, and demand for tickets surprised
even Winge, who added extra shows.
   ``It's late, but not too late,'' wrote an Aftenposten
editorialist about the surge in interest. ``Excuse me, if I find it
a little strange - to put it mildly - that any country suddenly
discovers Ibsen, especially when that country just happens to be
Ibsen's homeland.''

   Flying back to Washington to vote on the
budget mess, a Democratic senator told the fellow in the next seat
who he was.
   Bad move.
   Sen. David Pryor of Arkansas told colleagues that the passenger
beside him asked whether he worked for the government. ``I said,
`As a matter of fact, I do. I'm a United States senator.' He said,
`Well, if you don't mind, I don't want to sit with you.'''
   And changed seats.
   A Democratic House member is said to have mused aloud that he's
glad to be unopposed in next month's election because he'd probably
vote for the challenger if there was one.
   That sort of gallows political humor reflects the bleak outlook
as Congress struggles into the next round on the budget, a no-win
issue there and at the White House.
   The government's trying to deal in days with decisions that were
supposed to be made months ago. Lawmakers need to figure out how to
trim the annual deficit by $500 billion over five years.
   Sen. William L. Armstrong, R-Colo., said people won't see anyone
in Congress as a hero - they will all look like jerks.
   And there's no guarantee that the process won't grind into
another shut-down-the-government deadline, with spending authority
extended only until Oct. 19. That date does come with an extra
inducement - it's the day Congress had hoped to adjourn for the
year.
   The settlement that avoided the full-scale shutdown threatened
for Tuesday ``merely enables us to get to first base,'' said Sen.
George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, the majority leader. It doesn't cut
the deficit by one dollar.
   It does set guidelines - $40 billion in revenues and spending
cuts to reduce a steadily increasing deficit anticipated this year,
$500 billion over five years - and assigns the regular House and
Senate committees to draft specific legislation to meet those
goals.
   Those were the overall numbers of the budget agreement President
Bush tried to push through Congress with late but intense personal
lobbying. The House rejected that plan last Friday. In the process,
conservative House Republicans rebelled over the tax increases that
were part of the settlement.
   That could happen next time, too, since taxes will be central to
the new plan.
   Bush acknowledged that his 1988 campaign vow against new taxes
``makes it more difficult for people'' who echoed him to vote for
an increase now. But he said he doesn't regret his pledge ``because
what I do is take a look at - at the situation at the time, see the
changed economics, and say I've got to - got to, you know, go
forward here.''
   He'd already conceded that his tax philosophy ``runs out of gas
in terms of votes'' in Congress.
   As vice president, then as candidate and president, Bush held
the no-new-taxes line for nearly 10 years. He spent 10 minutes on
national television on Oct. 2 trying to turn it around and get the
first budget deal approved.
   ``Tell your congressmen and senators you support this
deficit-reduction agreement,'' he urged the voters. By most
accounts, the message that got back to Congress was the opposite,
although Bush maintains that the agreement had wide support from
the American people.
   But nobody bothered in advance to prepare the voters who pay the
taxes and use the programs for the surprise package that was
supposed to hit on both sides of that ledger. The problem was
turned over to congressional leaders and administration negotiators
to be handled in protracted, secret bargaining. The result was a
last-minute proposition with no constituency in Congress, let alone
the country.
   In part, that was a product of political maneuvering, in whch
the Democratic Congress and the Republican White House each tried
to get the other to go first in publicly advocating steps that were
bound to be unpopular with voters.
   Bush had said people worried about the election impact of the
first budget deal should recall the tax increases that were enacted
when Ronald Reagan was president.
   ``And there wasn't a political fallout because I think the
country understands when the president concludes that a deal is
necessary,'' Bush said. ``They incline to give him the benefit of
the doubt.''
   Sometimes.

   The bad news about ``The Simpsons'' is that
despite a big build-up by Fox Broadcasting, tonight's second-season
premiere doesn't reveal who killed Laura Palmer.
   The good news: Such can happen in Matt Groening's quirky cartoon
series about a typical American family full of love, overbite, a
proudly underachieving son named Bart and a dog named Santa's
Little Helper.
   Tonight's premiere, however, has young Bart finally realizing
the terrible cost of not studying. He could be held back in the
fourth grade for another year, and maybe even for life.
   This will please teachers everywhere, particularly those at
three elementary schools who last April banned the wearing of
Bart's ``Underachiever: And Proud of It'' T-shirt.
   Despite such pecksniffs, ``The Simpsons'' was a hit in its first
year, a series whose bug-eyed, sweetly weirdo clan took the
tradition of shows like ``Father Knows Best,'' made it blue-collar
and put it somewhere in the neighborhood of reality.
   With Bart baying ``Don't have a cow, man!,'' the show rose as
high as fourth in the Nielsens. Its success ignited a megabuck
merchandising blitz of Simpsons products. But that was when it was
on Sunday nights.
   Then Fox, in a burst of dim that had Groening groaning, shifted
the show this season to Thursday, opposite NBC's top-rated ``The
Cosby Show.'' Fox also delayed the second-season premiere until
tonight.
   All this has put ``The Simpsons'' so low in the Nielsens that
divers must be dispatched each each week to get the results. Many
analysts feel that this will continue, no matter what Groening &amp;
Co. do.
   They could be wrong. It may just be that frequent attacks of
warmth, decency and goodness by NBC's family Huxtable finally have
taken their toll on viewers. There is such a thing as too much
warmth, decency and goodness.
   But it also helps that ``The Simpsons'' is off to a fine
re-start tonight with a very funny show. Written by David M. Stern,
it brilliantly brings back those chilling childhood memories of
facing a major test at school when one's mind is in the state of
Nobody Home.
   And bless its heart, the show also takes some quick, sly digs at
the pervasive, mind-numbing influence of video games and television
on kids.
   Bart's class crisis begins when he's called on to give a book
report on ``Treasure Island.'' As is his custom, he hasn't read it.
As is his custom, he tries to wing it, glancing at the book cover
for inspiration:
   ``It's about these pirates, pirates with patches over their eyes
. . . and green birds on their shoulders.''
   But of course he winds up at the blackboard, writing ``I will
not fake my way through life'' 100 times.
   Berated by the teacher, facing a major history test the next
day, he knows he must study. But first, to the video arcade. There,
he plays your basic video game - where a tyke shoots a granny who
wants to kiss him.
   At home, well, just a bit of TV before dinner.
   He sits with his smart younger sister, Lisa, and Maggie, their
pacifier-sucking infant sister, watching a violent cat-chases-mouse
cartoon, ``Let Them Eat Scratchy.''
   (They chortle when one character winds up in a guillotine; he
shrugs his shoulders, and with good reason.)
   After dinner, Homer the patriarch insists that Bart join him
watching a gorilla movie on TV. After that, Bart finally tries to
study about the Pilgrims. But he falls asleep over his book.
   Marge, America's only mother with a blue beevive hairdo, notes
that her son tries so hard. But why, she asks, does he keep failing
in school?
   ``Just a little dim, I guess,'' Homer says.
   Poor Bart faces even more woes, including twin meanies on the
school bus the next day. He seeks their help in cramming for the
coming test. They advise him that the Pilgrims came to America on
``The Spirit of St. Louis.''
   But in time, he does learn one of life's most valuable lessons -
that dimness can be overcome, sort of.
   ``The Simpsons'' is different, all right, and not just because
coming episodes feature a Tony Bennett appearance, Danny DeVito as
the voice of Homer's separated-at-birth brother, and Homer getting
a male secretary - voice by ``Torch Song Trilogy'' author Harvey
Fierstein - who proves to be gay.
   The show also has good writing, attention to life's any
oddities, and craftsmanship. That may not be enough to beat The
Cos. But it's worth a look.

<HEAD>Trying Money Funds On For Size</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When you compare the relative attractions of
money market mutual funds, big can be beautiful.
   To any student of the art of mutual-fund investing, that may
sound like a surprising idea.
   Traditionally, in arenas such as the stock market, small funds
are often considered to have an edge on their larger competitors,
in part because they can be more flexible and maneuverable.
   But in the $400 billion-plus money-fund business, which engages
in a different battle waged in a different marketplace, analysts
who have studied the subject say just the opposite principle
applies.
   ``Large money funds have a tendency to yield more to their
shareholders than small money funds,'' says the investment advisory
letter Income &amp; Safety, published by the Institute for Econometric
Research in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   Income &amp; Safety arrived at this conclusion by examining the
field of money funds it monitors, grouped by where they ranked in
the service's system for forecasting fund yields.
   The funds with above-average yield forecasts, it turned out, had
an average of $3.7 billion in assets; those with average yield
forecasts, $2.3 billion, and those with below-average yield
forecasts, $600 million.
   In other words, pointed out Norman Fosback, the institute's
president, ``taxable money funds with above-average yields had, on
average, an asset base six times as large as funds with
below-average yields.''
   Fosback cited several reasons why this correlation appeared to
be more than coincidental:
   ``First, large funds experience some economies of scale in their
day-to-day operating expenses. As these relatively fixed costs are
spread over a larger asset base, expenses per dollar of assets
fall, and lower expense ratios equal higher yields.''
   Secondly, Fosback said, sponsors of large funds tend to collect
smaller percentages from the funds' assets for their annual
management fees. ``In part,'' he observes, ``this reflects the fact
that many management companies scale back their fees as fund size
increases.
   ``Third, very large money funds can sometimes obtain slightly
better returns by purchasing commercial paper (short-term IOUs
issued by corporations and other entities) and certificates of
deposit in huge denominations.
   ``Finally,'' Fosback added, ``the market for money funds is
quite efficient. Investors are attracted to funds with superior
yields and avoid those with below-average returns. This helps the
best-yielding funds to grow still larger.''
   Fosback and other observers caution that size should not be the
first criterion used in trying to gauge any fund's merits.
   The prime questions are usually relative yield and safety, as
reflected in the kinds and maturities of investments a fund has in
its portfolio.
   There also may be special factors to consider as well. The
Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market Fund, for instance, has used
an aggressive marketing strategy to help promote its rapid rise to
the ranks of both the biggest and highest-yielding funds.
   For more than a year and a half since the fund was established,
the sponsoring Dreyfus Corp. has picked up all the fund's operating
expenses and collected no management fee.
   It has promised that it will continue to forgo the management
fee until at least next June 30. But starting Oct. 1 it began
charging part of the operating costs to the fund.
   But with all those caveats, Fosback observes, ``size does
matter.''
   A stock mutual fund can, in theory at least, fall victim to its
own success, attracting more money than it can put to work in the
strategies that have won it acclaim.
   By contrast, in a money-market fund popularity apparently can be
a blessing rather than a bane.

<HEAD>Some Budget Comments You Might Not Have Seen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Uncle Sam's economic statistics had been kept
properly, there would have been no budget crisis and fewer strains
between Congress and the White House.
   That view of the budget crisis is one you probably haven't heard
before, even though you may have been one of those who swore that
everything that could have been said had been said and that you
didn't want to hear anymore.
   Albert Sindlinger is an economic researcher who gathers his own
information and produces his own analyses for corporate, academic
and governmental clients. His data comes from telephone calls his
staffers make to households.
   Those calls, he says, reveal to him that there are probably two
million fewer workers in the American economy than are being
reported officially by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   He claims the disparity lies in errors in BLS's methodology,
including its revisions and its tendency to count one person
working two jobs as two people working two jobs, with two full
incomes rather than perhaps one and one-quarter.
   But that's for the statisticians to argue about, and
Sindlinger's argument consumes 49 typewritten pages of
compilations, charts and graphs.
   More to the point, his budget commentary is that if the BLS
removed those two million workers it would reduce gross national
product and show the economy to be in recession, as he has had it
for nearly a year.
   While the BLS has found the economy to be weakening, it still
has it skirting recession, due largely to those ``extra'' workers.
Worker wages and salaries, he says, account for nearly half of
gross national product.
   If BLS figures agreed with his, concludes Sindlinger,
implementation of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act would have been
automatically deferred, there being a provision to that effect when
two straight near-recession quarters occur.
   He concludes: ``With a truthful GNP, the act would have been
scrapped and the current charade of blamemanship would not be
amplifying the growing voter revolt.''
   Economist Roger Brinner has another somewhat offbeat comment
about the budget scene. Oddly, he says, Congress hasn't yet caught
on to the revenue opportunities presented by the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve.
   Brinner, whose analysis are made for DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc., part
of Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., reasons that by selling perhaps 200
million barrels of the reserve at $37.50 a barrel could close $7.5
billion of the budget deficit.
   Then, he continues, ``If war doesn't break out the reserves
could be later rebuilt at two-thirds the selling price,'' since he
believes prices will fall if peace is achieved.
   ``I cynically expected this to be part of the $50 billion
first-year budget adjustment,'' he says. Instead, he says,
negotiators took a more difficult course of scaledowns, program
cuts, tax increases and other maneuvers.
   Another commentary: To J. Marc Wheat of the Citizens For A Sound
Economy Foundation, a non-profit research group, the budget
negotiators somehow missed the point that Americans wanted spending
cut rather than taxes raised.
   ``More dollars flow into federal coffers than ever before,''
says Wheat, the foundation's director of tax and budget policy, and
he has the figures to prove it.
   He points out that revenue to the federal government has grown
every year since 1983, increasing from $600.6 billion to an
estimated $1.073 trillion in 1990, a 79 percent increase.
   That being so, he concludes that overspending rather than lack
of revenue has caused our deficit problems, and that ``Congress
should not be trusted to cut spending in future years.''

<HEAD>Moslems Begin Edging Into Interreligious Mainstream</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslems, long isolated from America's religious
mainstream, have started edging into it.
   An initial step into working collaboration with Christians and
Jews came last week as national Islamic representatives joined a
major interfaith operation, Religion in American Life.
   Dawud Assad, president of the Council of Mosques of the United
States, said that in taking the step, ``we look forward to some
good cooperation in the future'' with ``our brothers and sisters.''
   ``We're at a new stage at which we cease to be a religion on the
margins, but a religion of American people related to American
life,'' said Gutbi E. Ahmed, director of the Moslem World League.
``We're now ready to interact with the rest of American people,
particularly in relation to its religious communities.''
   Leaders of other faiths, Protestant, Roman Catholic, Eastern
Orthodox and Jewish welcomed the Moslem entry into the
organization, which works to encourage regular worship and
community service.
   ``This is an historic moment for RIAL and, I daresay, for
America,'' said Rabbi Joseph B. Glaser, chairman of the group and
executive vice president of the Central Conference of American
Rabbis.
   ``It could be a turning point for our nation,'' he added. ``We
have broken a major barrier, and, who knows, the beneficial effect
may well ripple to other shores.''
   Religion in American Life was founded in 1949 and initially
involved only Protestant denominations. It later included Roman
Catholicism, making it inter-Christian, and subsequently enlisted
Jews, making it a interreligious.
   ``Now, with the entry of Islam, we become a holy organization,''
Glaser said. ``Holiness is inclusive - it knows not fences.
Holiness is trust and is caring beyond one's parochial boundaries.
   ``Holiness is knowing that we are all God's children - and in
knowing that knowing God.''
   Moslems previously have been involved in interfaith theological
dialogues, but not in interreligious activity on a national basis.
   ``We had not been willing to join before because we would be
drowned,'' Assad said. But, he said, Moslems now have
organizational maturity and strength to facilitate interreligious
cooperation.
   The council Assad heads includes 195 mosques, worshipping
centers in most major cities. He said there also are now more than
1,000 Moslem community organizations, some worshipping in basements
or other makeshift places.
   Noting Islamic roots in Judaism and Christianity, he said, ``We
who work together all are of the Abrahamic faith.''
   He said Moslem Scriptures, the Koran, ``demands dialogue with
people of the book (the Bible),'' meaning Jews and Christians. ``We
also believe in all the book, the prophets, the gospel,'' he said.
   No Islamic membership count has been made in this country, but
estimates generally put the figure between 4 million and 6 milion,
although some estimates range considerably above that.
   The Rev. Nicholas B. van Dyck, a Presbyterian and president of
Religion in American Life, said starting Islamic participation
shows what ``may be news to many Americans'' - that most Moslems
support interfaith cooperation.
   The group coordinates interfaith research and public information
activities, including provision of worship directories in hotels.
It also works to increase weekly worship, backed by public service
advertising campaigns.
   The current drive, under the slogan ``Invite a Friend,''
involves projects in thousands of congregations.
   For years, Islam in this country has been regarded a ``foreign
religion,'' and consequently Moslem immigrants ``learned to live in
their own substructure,'' Ahmed said.
   However, he said the taking root in America of indigenous, black
Moslems, of which he is one, and the presence of a second
generation of younger American-born Moslems opened the way for
cooperation with other faiths.
   ``The big difference is that we have had a wall around our lives
in a Moslem ghetto, and now we see we are part of this society,
that our future is here,'' he said. ``This has never been faced by
Moslems before.''
   The Islamic representatives said most American Moslems support
international efforts to get Iraqi forces out of Kuwait but hope
for a peaceful solution.
   They also ``understand the presence'' of Western forces in Saudi
Arabia, but some have misgivings about it, Ahmed said in
summarizing conclusions of 700 Moslem leaders last month at a
Continental Council of Mosques.
   Both Ahmed and Assad also said there had been few signs of
antagonism toward American Moslems as a result of the Middle East
crisis.
   ``Not much of it, only a few incidents,'' Assad said.
   Ahmed noted a few scrawls on mosques and a few telephone hate
calls. But, he added, compared to the anti-Moslem feelings stirred
by Iran's holding of American hostages in 1979, this time ``it has
been minimal.''

   Huberts used to sell caviar and truffles. Its
tables were set with fish forks and fish spoons. Waiters wore
designer uniforms. And ties and jackets were required of the
customers.
   A dinner for two cost $165.
   Today there is no caviar and the fish forks are stored away.
Waiters wear their own slacks and shirts. There are more tables,
pushed closer together.
   The price for two is about $100 - a hefty sum for most people,
but a dramatic cut for the Upper East Side restaurant.
   ``I felt we were in a vastly changing world and that I needed to
keep up,'' says Len Allison, chef-owner of Huberts.
   This is the year of rude awakenings for restaurant owners in New
York City. The economic downturn - triggered by the stock market
crash in 1987 - has hit them hard, especially proprietors of
second-tier luxury establishments.
   At credit-card restaurants, sales were down 15 percent to 20
percent in June, compared to the same month last year, while
nationally they dropped between 12 percent and 14 percent, says
restaurant consultant Michael Whiteman.
   A Gallup poll for the National Restaurant Association in
Washington, D.C., showed 22 percent of adults ate lunch out on any
given day in July, compared with 30 percent in June. The polls were
of 1,000 people and had a margin of error of 3.5 points. Expensive
restaurants are hardest hit.
   ``People will trade down for lunch,'' said George Rice, a
spokesman for Consumer Reports on Eating Share Trends, which tracks
restaurant industry data. ``It's Chez Paul's to Bennigan's and
Bennigan's to Denny's and then Denny's to McDonald's. That's been
going on for a few years and it will accelerate.''
   Restaurant owners from San Francisco, Los Angeles, Detroit and
Boston say they, too, are adjusting to a newly cost-conscious
dining public. But their outlook is brighter than that of their New
York City counterparts.
   ``I think we are going through the same thing. But it's harder
in New York,'' said Jasper White, chef-owner of Jasper's, an
upscale restaurant in an old molasses warehouse in Boston.
   New York City is bigger, it is tied more closely to the fortunes
of the financial community, and it has more restaurants competing
for survival, he said. Moreover, the dining public has more to
revolt against in the Big Apple since restaurant prices are by far
the highest in the country.
   The average price of dinner for one in New York City - three
courses, one drink and tip in the 20 most popular restaurants
according the popular Zagat survey of eateries - is $61. In Los
Angeles, the city with the second most expensive meal prices, the
average is $43.
   ``I think the restaurants that were popular in the '80s had a
shiny armor,'' says Adam Tihany, co-owner of Remi, a new and
popular trattoria in midtown Manhattan, where dinner costs about
$35 a person.
   The places that are successful in the 1990s, he says, will be
run by people who truly care and ``turn out a product that ...
gives you value for what you are spending.''
   Indeed, mid-priced bistros where the atmosphere is casual and
the food is simple are thriving in New York City, says Tim Zagat,
publisher of the surveys.
   ``People want to eat well because they are used to that but they
don't want to spend as much time or as much money as they used
to,'' says Jimmy Schmidt, chef-owner of the Rattlesnake Club in
Detroit.
   His successful restaurant on the Detroit River features
midwestern cooking in a light, airy environment filled with
contemporary art. About 80 percent of the main courses are priced
under $20.
   Picey restaurants that do not have four-star reputations for
food and service are revamping their menus and decor to appeal to
the spontaneous, cost-conscious diner.
   The glitterati used to pack Melrose, a basement restaurant in
New York's Greenwich Village where they could dine on small
portions of California food served on big white plates for $55 a
person. But when the trend setters moved on, Melrose emptied.
   Owner Lee Friedman realized neighborhood people ``weren't going
to come in for three slices of rare-charred tuna for $25.''
   Earlier this year, he renamed Melrose the Barrow Street Bistro,
cut prices about 40 percent, toned down the austere decor and
changed the menu to include heartier bistro cooking. Business has
picked up and more than half of Friedman's customers are from the
neighborhood.
   In Boston, Jasper's was hit hard by the stock market crash.
Overnight it lost many of its expense account clients.
   ``We reacted immediately,'' says White, the chef-owner. The menu
was expanded to include lower-priced items like fish cakes and pot
roasts. And the waiters donned white aprons instead of tuxedos. The
average dinner price for one person dropped from $70 to $55.
   Joyce Goldstein, a San Francisco chef, says she expects to see
fewer luxury restaurants in the coming years but not fewer people
eating out.
   ``It's not, `Uh, oh! We're in a recession. Let's start cooking
little chicken things at home,''' says the owner of Square One,
where dinner averages $35 a person and the atmosphere is warm and
friendly.
   ``People are working just as hard, twice as hard as ever before.
The last thing we need after work is to go to the supermarket and
cook.''

   When the earthquake shook the San Francisco
Bay area at 5:04 p.m. last Oct. 17, it seemed to many that the end
of the world was at hand. It wasn't.
   A year later, their lives go on. Some residents have moved;
others stayed put. Regardless, their lives have been remade.
   ---
   Cathryn Green is the first in line at roller coaster rides, but
refuses to cross the Bay Bridge since the earthquake.
   She moved in with her parents to avoid the bridge. She confines
her social life to cities east of the span, crippled for one month
when a section of the upper deck collapsed.
   She wasn't on the bridge when the quake struck, but she's scared
anyway, and has only been on it one time since.
   ``I found myself flying across at 60 or 70 mph just to get it
over with. ... By the time I got across, I had a headache. I was in
no mood to go to school or do my field work,'' said Green, a
graduate student at the University of California-Berkeley.
   She once detoured 40 miles south to San Jose rather than cross
the bridge to a dinner south of San Francisco.
   ``I called and said, `I'll be there. I may be a little late. I'm
taking the long way,' '' Green said.

   Puth Suon, 20, came to the city from Cambodia in 1984 with six
other family members, after surviving years in refugee camps in his
war-torn country. But the quake, he said, was too much for his
mother.
   ``My family was kind of afraid and they just started looking for
a lower apartment,'' Suon said. ``We were on the sixth floor and it
felt like we were on a boat and the water hit and we were shaking.
My mom was really afraid. She's a little old.''
   Three weeks after the quake, the family left their $430-a-month
studio apartment in the Tenderloin. They moved to Modesto, a
mid-size city 100 miles southeast of San Francisco, and rented a
larger place for $387.
   Ten percent to 20 percent of the Cambodian families in the
city's Tenderloin district left after the quake, driven by fear and
superstition, said Silen Nhok, refugee coordinator for the
International Institute of San Francisco.
   ``There was a lack of information in the community. They thought
of a dragon throwing his tail to cause an earthquake,'' Nhok said.
   ---
   Adele Bertaud said she might come unfastened when the next big
earthquake hits, but her belongings won't.
   Calling herself a ``converted scared person,'' Bertaud's
extensive preparations since the quake include battening down her
VCR, stereo and other possessions with industrial strength Velcro
``Quake Grip.''
   She founded an earthquake rescue team in her 119-unit
condominium complex. The team, one of dozens organized by the city
of Oakland, is training in firefighting, search and rescue and
first aid in preparation for the ``Really Big One.''
   Bertaud, 53, a political worker, designated a command post in
her building and outfitted her office with water, food and giant
Velcro to hold down computer terminals.
   ``I'm scared. I'm really scared. If I won the lottery, I'd be
out of here in a hot minute,'' she said.
   ---
   Bernardo Arellan will spend the night of Oct. 17 sleeping in
Callahan Park in Watsonville, as his family did for weeks after the
quake destroyed their apartment.
   The six Arellan children and their parents, all born in Mexico,
want to remember and be thankful for their trailer home, paid for
with federal relief money.
   ``We were together and we were alive,'' said Arellan, whose
parents are trying to buy the trailer they still live in one year
later. Their apartment was renovated, but they couldn't afford the
higher rent.
   The Callahan Park event is planned as part of the anniversary of
the quake, which devastated sections of Watsonville, about 100
south of San Francisco.
   ``We will stay the night and remember, and to be more prepared
for it because we are waiting for another big one. I'm not scared
because I know it's going to happen,'' Arellan said.

   A page in Robert Hansen's sketchbook contains a crawled
inscription: ``Have you hugged your dad lately? - Nightmare. Damn
it.''
   The sketches are drafts of artworks Hansen created since his
father's death in the collapse of Oakland's Cypress freeway during
the earthquake.
   ``He was at the interchange on the end; five seconds more and he
would have escaped. If two guys had grabbed him and shook hands and
said, `Enjoy the (World) Series,' that was enough,'' said Hansen,
33.
   ``Angels Come in Many Colors'' is a tribute to his father and 41
others who died on the freeway. The oil collage using news photos
of the victims is displayed with dozens of other works in ``Beyond
Fragments: After the Earthquake,'' at the Pro-Arts Gallery in
Oakland.
   ``I'm embracing my dad in paintings,'' Hansen said.
   ---
   Bob Miguel no longer takes his wife dancing at San Francisco's
Top of the Mark or for drinks up in the clouds at Bank of America's
52nd-story bar. The quake brought them back to earth.
   ``I won't go over the seventh floor in anything for anything,''
said Miguel, a real estate broker who lives in suburban Contra
Costa County.
   Miguel and his wife, Joyce, celebrated her birthday at a
high-quality but low-elevation restaurant in the suburbs.
   They were visiting a lawyer in an eighth-floor Oakland office
last year when the floor rippled like ribbon candy and the
staircase crashed to the lobby.
   Miguel wrote messages on cardboard boxes and tossed them out the
window to firefighters who couldn't hear his cries.
   The Miguels climbed down an eight-story fire ladder, the longest
made.
   ``I asked what would have happened had we been on the 12th
floor. They said they would have to lower you inside on ladders and
ropes. So if you want to give me $10,000 to go to the 54th floor,
you can keep your money.''
   ---
   One year after the earthquake miracle of Buck Helm's survival on
the collapsed Cypress freeway and the tragedy of his death, his
former wife, Lorrie Helm Montgomery, sits beside his grave and
quietly talks to him.
   ``We were married 16 years and we talked about everything. ... I
ask him how he would handle a family problem ... what he would
suggest doing,'' she said.
   The 240-pound longshoreman was rescued after 89 hours in his
little Chevrolet Sprint, which was crushed to a height of three
feet. He had a fractured skull and ribs and only enough room to
wiggle the fingers of his left hand. He lived 28 days before a
hidden heart disease and the trauma to his body took his life. He
was 58 years old.
   Dozens of movie and book offers were withdrawn after he died,
Lorrie Helm Montgomery said. She recently sold the movie rights for
what she said was a small sum.
   For the quake anniversary, she will publish a tribute to Helm in
her town paper, including words he wrote to his children during a
creative writing class at a junior college:
   ``I am who you are or will become. You are my immortality - as
you remember me, I live past the allotted time given me.''

   For Connie Bishop, a simple thing like
changing lanes is enough to jolt her back to Oct. 17, 1989.
   ``I still don't like those little reflector bumps someone sold
to the highway. You hear that thump thump when you change lanes,
and you try to catch your breath,'' Bishop said.
   She was driving on the upper tier of Highway 880's Cypress
structure when it crumbled in the earthquake, killing 42 people.
She felt what she thought was a flat tire, then saw the freeway
sway and a huge section yards in front of her sink to the bottom
deck.
   Uninjured, Bishop put her experience to work.
   ``It was probably the biggest rush of adrenaline I've had in 37
years,'' she recalled. ``I kind of went into my old staff nurse
mode. After about a minute or two, I was checking out people's
injuries. It's second nature.''
   A year after the shaking stopped, Bishop says she's still
feeling the emotional aftershocks of the 15-second temblor.
   Quake nightmares and sudden bursts of fear of the Really Big One
persist for many Northern Californians. Those who experienced the
quake's worst devastation still may suffer severe, on-going stress
and anger.
   As the chief administrator of Alta Bates-Herrick Hospital's
mental health ward, Bishop is familiar with post-quake symptoms. As
a survivor, she's experienced the sleeplessness and anxiety
herself.
   For many, she predicts, the anniversary will bring out
unresolved grief.
   ``We celebrate anniversaries - marriages, divorces. They are
rituals around significant life events,'' Bishop said. People also
have negative anniversary date reactions. ``They feel bad. Just
like if you've lost a parent or a loved one. It's a loss.''
   In neighborhoods near the Cypress structure, where residents
scaled the crumbled concrete to save victims, heightened fear and
anger linger.
   ``There are lots of crises - marital, relationship,
child-parent. Many have been trying to get back on track with their
lives and haven't been able to,'' said Ken Davis, a psychologist
with the West Oakland Mental Health Center.
   Robert ``Raven'' Majors, 37, was among the rescuers. He still
dreams about a woman who died as he promised her she would be all
right.
   ``I kept telling her, `You'll be all right.' The side of her
head was crushed and she was mumbling. Her legs were broken. ... I
recall her saying, `Am I gonna be OK?' I said, `Yes.' And then she
died,'' he said.
   A teetotaler before the disaster, Majors began drinking and took
time off work as a security guard. A fear of bridges he overcame
before the quake is back stronger than ever, and he pulls his van
to the side before crossing the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.
   Majors, a raggae guitarist, never regained full use of his
thumb, broken as he saved the life of a woman dangling from the
smoldering ruin 25 feet above the ground.
   ``The black smoke was choking her. I said, `You're gonna die if
you stay there. I'll try to break your fall,' '' he said. The woman
fell on Majors, who flagged down a motorist to take her to the
hospital.
   Pat and John Abduljammie live with daily reminders of the quake.
   Their West Oakland home, just a few yards from what used to be
the Cypress structure, never was fully repaired. A sewer line
remains broken, and one of the showers doesn't work. The house,
cracked and broken, leans to the east because the quake jolted it
off its foundation.
   The couple tries to cope with the anger they feel at what they
view as government neglect. Damage to their home was estimated at
$35,000 to $40,000, and they received $10,080 in grants.
   The house shakes incessantly because it is not anchored, and
John Abduljammie wonders how he will be able to afford to fix it.
   ``It's as if you've been accosted by someone. They took your
money, robbed you at gunpoint,'' said Abduljammie, an artist who
works at home. He, too, was one of the West Oakland rescuers.
   ``The feeling I have when it shakes is anger. This is shaking
from the past earthquake. It's just constant,'' his wife said.

   Last year's earthquake resulted in
dozens of new California laws, including a temporary sales tax hike
expected to raise $800 million and a statewide home quake insurance
program.
   In a special session called after the Oct. 17 quake and in this
year's regular session, the Legislature passed a total of 102
quake-related bills, far more than in previous years.
   The new laws are spreading the quake's effects into the state's
distant corners, far from the San Andreas Fault.
   All California consumers have been paying an extra quarter-cent
sales tax since Dec. 1. And all 6.5 million of the state's
homeowners, even those living on absolute bedrock, next year will
begin paying $12 to $60 extra annually for home insurance to cover
potential quake damage.
   The tax increase raises the state's 6 percent sales tax for a
13-month period, from Dec. 1, 1989, through Dec. 31, 1990.
   The money raised will be added to the state earthquake fund,
used for state and local costs such as the disaster response and
the repair of state buildings, highways and roads, said Cindy Katz,
spokeswoman for the state Department of Finance.
   The quake insurance bill creates a state insurance fund that
will pay the first $15,000 of residential damage caused by an
earthquake. All homeowners will pay a yearly surcharge of $12 to
$60, depending on the risk where they live, beginning next July 1.
   One finding of the quake was that most homeowners didn't have
quake insurance because premiums and deductibles, usually 10
percent of the insured value, were too high. Most of the 25,000
homes damaged by the quake suffered less than $15,000 damage - less
than most deductibles. The new program would cover such damage and
pay the deductible for homeowners who choose to buy full earthquake
insurance.
   Also passed were:
   -A set of bills creating an $80 million statewide program to
inspect all publicly owned bridges for seismic safety and fix them
by Dec. 31, 1991.
   -A pair of bills establishing an emergency, fast-track claims
process for families of people killed in the collapse of the
Interstate 880 Cypress structure and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge. The bills provided $25,000 to $50,000 for claims, with a
maximum of $200,000 per family.
   -Two quake-related measures to be put before voters this year.
   In June, voters approved $300 million in bonds to be used to
rebuild or repair seismic problems in state and local government
buildings.
   Voters in November will decide on Proposition 127, which would
allow property owners to make seismic repairs or improvements
without having the property reassessed for higher property tax
rates.

   UAL Corp.'s board of directors rejected two
employee buyout offers, marking the fourth failed takeover bid of
the parent of United Airlines in 3{ years.
   The Chicago-based company also said Tuesday it would seek to
quickly reach new contracts with its pilots, mechanics and flight
attendants unions, which led the buyout effort.
   James Hanson, a spokesman for the pilots union, said the unions
had not given up on buying the airline. He did not say when another
proposal might be prepared.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Crude oil futures prices hit an all-time high of
$40.40 a barrel as angry rhetoric from Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein escalated Middle East war fears.
   Traders said the deaths of 19 Palestinians in Jerusalem on
Monday and Saddam's threat of retaliation fed a buying spree that
has nearly doubled oil prices on the futures market since Iraq
invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   The price of light sweet crude - the key grade of U.S. oil -
closed up $1.45 at $40.40 per 42-gallon barrel for November
delivery Tuesday after gaining nearly $1 on Monday.
   ---
   NEW YORK (AP) - The average price of self-serve unleaded
gasoline nationwide rose 2.4 cents in the last week to $1.37 per
gallon, the American Automobile Association said.
   The average retail price of self-serve unleaded is up 29.5
cents, or 27.4 percent, from Aug. 1, the day before Iraq invaded
Kuwait and triggered the Middle East crisis.
   Prices rose in all parts of the country, with largest increase
in the West and the smallest in the Midwest, AAA said Tuesday.

   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - Six oil giants operating the nation's
largest oilfield at Prudhoe Bay announced they are investing $1.1
billion to increase natural gas handling capacity and boost
declining oil production.
   Bitish Petroleum, Atlantic Richfield, Exxon, Phillips, Mobil
and Chevron will build and install a huge centralized natural gas
handling facility that will help boost oil production. Los
Angeles-based ARCO will operate the facility.
   The project, to be completed by 1995, is expected to increase
oil production by 100,000 barrels a day, officials said Tuesday.

   CINCINNATI (AP) - Procter &amp; Gamble Co. shareholders rejected a
resolution that urged the company to stop buying coffee from El
Salvador until that nation ends its civil war, with more than 97
percent voting against it.
   James Gamble of Amherst, Mass., great-great grandson of the
company's co-founder was one of the resolution's sponsors. P&amp;G's
board of directors had recommended shareholders reject the
proposal, which was voted on Tuesday.
   The maker of Folgers coffee refuses to say how much Salvadoran
coffee it buys annually, but says the amount is less than 2
percent. P&amp;G buys coffee from 30 countries.

   CINCINNATI (AP) - Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said it will spend $20
million to encourage construction of waste composting plants, and
is developing a disposable diaper that breaks down totally in such
plants.
   A company official said Tuesday P&amp;G's main interest in the
project is providing initiative to help resolve the problem of
mounting garbage and limited landfill space.
   Bans or taxes on disposable diapers were considered in as many
as 20 states this year. Nebraska, for one, has effectively banned
the sale of non-degradable diapers starting in 1993.

   The increase will help Iraq achieve food self-sufficiency in the
face of the U.N. embargo imposed after its Aug. 2 invasion and
subsequent annexation of neighboring Kuwait, the newspaper,
al-Jumhouriya said Tuesday.

   TOKYO (AP) - A former chairman of Japan's largest company was
convicted Tuesday of bribery in the widespread influence-buying
Recruit scandal, which had played a role in bringing down two prime
ministers.
   The Tokyo District Court ordered a two-year suspended prison
term and a $175,000 fine for Hisashi Shinto, 80, for accepting an
offer of prelisted stock that seemed certain to rise in value,
court officials said.
   The non-jury trial has been closely watched in Japan as a court
test of what constitutes a bribe in this country, where gift-giving
is a common practice in business and politics.

<HEAD>UAL Unions Say Employee Ownership Still Their Goal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines' pilots say they'll keep pushing
for employee ownership, but they're making contract talks their top
priority after UAL Corp.'s board rejected their latest buyout bid.
   ``We're not about to stop buying the airline,'' said James
Hanson, a spokesman for the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots
Association.
   United's flight attendants and mechanics also are committed to
employee ownership of the nation's biggest airline, said Gerald
Greenwald, chairman of the three-union group that mounted the
acquisition attempt.
   But until the group's advisers evaluate their options, ``I don't
think you even assume there will be another bid,'' said Hank
Krakowski, a spokesman for the buyout group.
   UAL's board of directors rejected the labor bid Tuesday, marking
the fourth failed takeover of the Chicago-based company in 3{
years. The last previous attempt, which also involved the pilots,
collapsed almost one year ago.
   Tuesday was the deadline for employees to arrange financing for
a $201-per-share, $4.38 billion offer that the board accepted in
principle in April.
   Despite a lack of bank financing, the buyout group presented the
board with two offers. Both were rejected.
   UAL said it wants to reach new contracts quickly with the unions
and will proceed with plans to place a large aircraft order it had
postponed at the labor group's request.
   The rejection stirred speculation that UAL's largest
shareholder, Coniston Partners, would revive an effort to oust
UAL's board and senior management, including Chairman Stephen M.
Wolf. Coniston said it was exploring its options.
   UAL's stock fell $4 a share Tuesday to $88 on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   The union workers, representing about two-thirds of UAL's 71,000
employees, are working under expired contracts.
   ``We're going to knuckle down and work on contract negotiations
full steam,'' Krakowski said.
   Greenwald's statement said the labor proposals, which include
employee concessions, would remain on the table briefly. He did not
return telephone calls to elaborate.
   The pilots, who launched their first acquisition effort in 1987,
vowed last month to confront UAL's management with everything up to
and including a strike if the board rejected the latest offer.
   In a statement, the three unions said Tuesday they would
``pursue all means necessary'' to gain substantial improvements in
wages and benefits.
   Greenwald said the buyout group presented two proposals: a $4.47
billion offer for $205 a share including $70 in cash and $135 in
securities, and a $4.43 billion offer for $203 a share with no cash
component.
   UAL said it would proceed with plans to place an aircraft order
that Wolf said in the spring would be the largest ever placed for
wide-bodied jetliners.
   In July, the board bowed to employees' request to postpone the
aircraft purchase until the buyout effort was resolved.
   ``This is a time of unique opportunity to continue to build
United Airlines,'' Wolf said in a statement.
   UAL said it had asked the National Mediation Board to resume
expedited mediation immediately in hopes of reaching labor pacts
with the pilots, whose contract expired in April 1988, and the
flight attendants, whose contract expired in November 1987.
   The company said it also was prepared to resume negotiations
with the Machinists union, whose contract with UAL expired in
November.

<HEAD>Standard &amp; Poor's Places City's Bond Rating on Credit Watch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN MATTHEWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tentative agreement to give teachers a 5.5
percent raise and New York City's worsening economy prompted a
major bond rating agency to begin reviewing the city's ability to
repay debt.
   The move by Standard &amp; Poors Corp. Tuesday to put the city's $13
billion in outstanding general obligation bonds on ``credit watch''
means the agency could decide to downgrade the debt. Such a move
would force the city to pay higher yields to investors who demand
higher returns for the risk.
   S&amp;P stopped short of lowering the city's rating of A-minus but
said it sees a need ``to revise the city's financial plan and to
evaluate its payroll burden in line with the realities'' of a
slipping economy.
   ``I'm confident we are going to satisfy them that we are in
control,'' Mayor David Dinkins said. ``We have a plan. We are going
to meet that gap.''
   The mayor has projected a $1.4 billion budget deficit for the
next year.
   ``The city is not on the verge of an economic disaster,'' State
Comptroller Edward Regan said. ``It's a cyclical downturn with an
erosion of revenue, but that can be handled. The problem is that
this year's budget was too large to begin with.''
   Regan said there is plenty of room for Dinkins to cut the $28
billion budget for the fiscal year that began July 1, starting with
some 8,500 new city hires built into the budget.
   An A-rating from S&amp;P means the agency believes the city has a
strong ability to pay interest and principal on the bonds, although
that ability is more susceptible to economic downswings. A plus or
minus sign on a rating shows its relative standing within the
catagory.
   The next step lower is BBB, which signifies that adverse
conditions make it more likely the city will have trouble paying
interest and principal.
   The other major rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, does
not have the city's rating under formal review, managing director
Jeffrey Rizzo said.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, who was in New York City on Tuesday, said the
city does not face a replay of the fiscal crisis of 1975 because
mechanisms created then will prevent such a slide now.
   Saving the city from bankruptcy in 1975 ``wasn't done by sending
them money,'' Cuomo said. ``It was done by giving them a mechanism
called MAC (Municipal Assistance Corporation) and guidance through
the Financial Control Board.
   ``Those are still in place, and the market knows that,'' Cuomo
said.

<HEAD>Oil Giants' Plan May Cut Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ENDERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six oil giants' plan to spend $1.1
billion boosting oil production in Prudhoe Bay may cost some Alaska
oil workers their jobs as the companies consolidate the work,
executives said.
   British Petroleum Co., Atlantic Richfield Co., Exxon Corp.,
Phillips Petroleum Co., Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. announced an
agreement Tuesday to build and install a huge centralized natural
gas handling facility to help boost declining oil production at
Prudhoe Bay, the nation's largest oil field. ARCO will operate the
facility.
   The project, expected to be completed by 1995, would increase
oil production by 100,000 barrels a day, company officials said. It
will add an estimated 330 million to 450 million barrels of oil to
reserves at the field, they said.
   BP and ARCO, the two operating partners at Prudhoe Bay, also
agreed to reduce overlapping services, including staff and contract
jobs, on the North Slope and in Anchorage by the end of 1991.
   The number of jobs cut won't be known until next year, officials
said, but they promised a ``gradual process.''
   BP and ARCO together employ about 4,600 workers at Prudhoe Bay.
   ``At a time of American concern about long-term oil supplies,
this project will make a welcome contribution and shows Alaska's
potential to add significant domestic reserves,'' BP Chairman
Robert Horton and ARCO Chairman Lodwrick M. Cook said in a prepared
statement.
   The oil companies' announcement follows resolution of their
longstanding disputes over how much natural gas is available at the
wells and who owns it, said Julian Darley, president of BP
Exploration (Alaska) Inc.
   Prudhoe Bay accounts for roughly 20 percent of domestic oil
production. The field began producing in 1977, and in 1988 reached
its peak at 1.6 million barrels a day.
   The oilfield's production has started to decline, however.
Production now averages 1.4 million barrels a day, said ARCO
spokesman Albert Greenstein in Los Angeles. Average 1990 production
will be about 1.35 million barrels a day, he said.
   BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., a 50 percent owner in the field,
estimates production will decline 10 percent to 12 percent annually
through the end of the century. As the oilfield ages, oil coming
from its wells is mixed with increasing amounts of natural gas and
water, officials said.
   The new facility would allow producers to separate gas from oil
and reinject the gas into the wells. Reinjection increases pressure
which increases oil flow.
   Dubbed ``GHX-2,'' the new gas expansion project will go on line
in two stages. The first huge gas-handling module will be shipped
by barge to Prudhoe Bay in 1993. A second module will follow in
1994, officials said.
   Last summer, the companies began installing the first major gas
facility expansion - GHX-1. It is set to go on line later this year
and will boost daily gas handling capacity from the current 3.8
billion cubic feet to 5.2 billion cubic feet.
   After the new modules begin operation in 1995, gas handling
capacity is expected to increase to 7.5 billion cubic feet per day.
   ARCO Alaska spokeswoman Susan Andrews said the project will
create a significant number of new jobs, mostly short- and
medium-term construction jobs, but that it was too early to nail
down local employment figures.

<HEAD>Government: Boesky Unlikely To Be Called as Witness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Junk bond financier Michael Milken probably
won't get a chance to face his main accuser, Ivan Boesky, before
sentencing.
   Federal prosecutors said Tuesday they do not plan to call the
inside trader to testify against Milken at a pre-sentencing
hearing.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll also said the government
was dropping one of four alleged illegal transactions against
Milken on which it planned to present evidence and testimony at the
planned two-week hearing.
   The move not to include Boesky in the unusual hearing, scheduled
to begin Thursday, was not a great surprise. Boesky was the main
source of information against Milken but also was susceptible to
attack from defense lawyers.
   Milken has pleaded guilty to six felony counts and has agreed to
pay $600 million in penalties in connection with the biggest
government probe of Wall Street fraud. He faces up to 28 years in
prison when sentenced by U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood.
   Sentencing was delayed for the hearing into uncharged
allegations against Milken raised by the government in its lengthy
pre-sentencing memorandum. Wood has said the hearing is designed to
shed light on Milken's character.
   In a telephone conference with the judge and Milken's attorneys,
Carroll said the government was unlikely to call Boesky to the
witness stand. But they did not rule out the possibility
altogether, he said.
   Carroll also said to save time the government was dropping from
its presentation an inside trading allegation involving Milken and
Boesky in securities of MGM-UA Entertainment Co.
   Boesky also was a central player in two of the other
transactions being aired - stock manipulation charges in Wickes
Cos. securities in 1985 and a web of alleged wrongdoing in the 1985
takeover of Storer Communications Inc. The third alleges insider
trading in Caesar's World Inc. securities in 1983.
   The Caesar's and Storer transactions involve new charges against
Milken not contained in the government's original 98-count
indictment last year or earlier Securities and Exchange Commission
charges.
   Wood has given each side a total of 20 hours to present
eestimony and cross-examine witnesses at the hearing. The burden of
proof on the government is lower than at a trial, though.
   Boesky, who was sentenced to three years in prison and paid $100
million in penalties to settle insider trading charges, is widely
reviled on Wall Street and would have given Milken attorney Arthur
Liman a broad target to discredit.
   Boesky was not regarded as a successful witness when he
testified earlier this year against former stock speculator John A.
Mulheren Jr. Boesky was perceived as combative on the stand and was
forced to admit a litany of serious lawbreaking.
   Instead, Carroll said the government's first three witnesses on
the Wickes transaction would be former Boesky head trader Michael
Davidoff and former Drexel employees Cary Maultasch and Peter
Gardiner, who worked under Milken in Drexel's Beverly Hills,
Calif., high-yield bond department.
   Carroll said the Wickes testimony would be followed by testimony
on Storer and then Caesar's. The prosecutor also disclosed that
former Drexel trader James Dahl and mutual fund manager Prescott
Crocker were among about 10 planned witnesses on the Caesar's deal.
   The witnesses for the Storer transactions were not disclosed.
   Prosecutors last week gave defense lawyers a list of 17 possible
witnesses and Wood has ordered the government to say in what order

<HEAD>NCR Pins Strategy on Software Launch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID E. KALISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NCR Corp., a company known for electronic cash
registers and automated teller machines, has launched a software
system that marks a sharp departure from its traditional sales
strongholds, analysts said.
   The ``Cooperation'' software, unveiled Tuesday at a glitzy press
conference in Manhattan's theater district, employs visual
on-screen aids and other features to let users obtain information
from data bases, route documents and talk electronically with other
employees.
   The announcement comes three weeks after the company said it
would replace its entire computer line with industry-standard
machines that all could communicate with each other. Based on the
open system, the new software launch is designed to help a
company's computer users communicate with each other - even if they
are working on non-NCR computers.
   ``Nobody can call NCR dull anymore,'' said NCR Chairman and CEO
Charles E. Exley Jr. at the press conference, as he slipped on a
pair of bright red sunglasses outfitted with flashing lights.
   The fifth largest U.S. computer maker, based in Dayton, Ohio,
dominates the slow-growing banking and retail-automation markets
but is considered a runner-up in mainstream business computers. The
new software targets all types of companies from 50 employees and
up.
   ``What you're seeing is NCR coming out of their shell with this
product,'' said Bob Vautrain, senior research analyst at Gartner
Group Inc. ``They're trying to take an obscure $6 billion company
from the Midwest and take it into general-purpose computing.''
   Relying on Hewlett-Packard Co.'s New Wave visual computer
technology, Cooperation is the first software product released
under NCR's new ``open'' computing architecture.
   The product, unveiled at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, was backed
by an extravagant stage show of colorful lights, screens aglow with
changing images of the product in use, and a demonstration by two
computer operators using the software product at actual on-stage
work stations.
   The extravaganza was intended to build excitement among software
manufacturers and encourage them to write programs that can run on
the NCR system, analysts said.
   ``Now that you have this great interface, you have to get
software manufacturers to write for it,'' said Vautrain. ``I think
there's a possibility it will happen.''
   Exley said that Cooperation is far more comprehensive than
equivalent systems on the market, with the ability to integrate
thousands of standard software packages.
   ``There is nothing announced at this point - much less in the
form of product - anywhere as near as comprehensive,'' Exley said
in an interview following the announcement.
   The software modules range from $1,700-$2,500 per user for a
24-user company, but the total cost of operating the system when
the workstations are included comes to $10,000-$12,000 per user,
Exley said, noting that the cost for a 100-station company would
total $1 million.
   The first release of Cooperation is scheduled for next month.
The product is expected to be more generally available in March.
   NCR is backing the launch of its open system products with a $12
million advertising campaign, starting with an ad in Wednesday's
Wall Street Journal, NCR officials said. Other ads will appear in
industry trade publications.
   Next week NCR is expected to elaborate how companies can employ
NCR's new software.

   The U.S. dollar rose slightly against most other
major currencies in European trading late this morning.
   Gold prices staged a partial recovery from their sharp dive in
New York late Tuesday but were still down from Tuesday's late bids
in Europe.
   Dealers said the dollar was holding steady above its historic
lows against the German mark.
   The ongoing U.S. budget stalemate this week highlighted the
debate over a potential easing of U.S. interest rates, sending the
dollar on a new downward course, dealers said.
   Renewed Middle East tensions and a rally in oil prices on
Tuesday restrained potential dollar sellers, one Frankfurt dealer
said. ``But the general direction is still lower.''
   In Tokyo, banks and markets were closed for Sports Day, a
national holiday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 130.35 yen,
up from 129.95 yen in Tokyo late Tuesday.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9675, cheaper for
buyers than $1.9705 late Tuesday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning in Europe, compared with late
Tuesday's rates included: 1.5256 German marks, up from 1.5245;
1.2777 Swiss francs, up from 1.2765; 5.1083 French francs, up from
5.1005; 1.7160 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7185; 1,143.60 Italian
lire, up from 1,143.25, and 1.1503 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1507.
   The pound had spurted earlier today on rumors that U.S. forces
were mobilized in the Persian Gulf, which were denied by the
Pentagon.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$392.20 per ounce at midmorning, down from $396.25 bid per ounce
late Tuesday. In Zurich, the bid price was $391.90, down from
$395.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.10 to close at a bid
$392.27.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.63 a troy ounce,
down from Tuesday's $4.68.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of bargain hunters snatched
up everything from all-terrain vehicles to animal shampoo on the
first day of an Alaska-size garage sale offering gear from the
Exxon Valdez cleanup.
   Locals grumbled that out-of-town businessmen with plenty of
money in their pockets and a need to justify their jaunts to Alaska
helped drive up prices Tuesday.
   ``It's a feeding frenzy,'' said Butch Johnson, a fisherman in
search of nets who lives in the Prince William Sound fishing
community of Cordova.
   Everything on the opening-day block was sold, including a plane,
mobile homes, TV sets and cat box filler, used to provide traction
on oily beaches.
   Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers International of Vancouver, British
Columbia, bought the leftover equipment from Exxon Corp. last month
for untold millions.
   The auction company won't say how much it expects to make, but
officials said they collected $3.8 million Tuesday.
   Many items were grouped in lots, about 5,000 of them.
   ``A sale like this only comes around once in a lifetime,'' said
Rod Meeks, an Anchorage aviation mechanic who bought two outboard
motors for $3,250. ``You really realize the size of the spill by
all th  garbage that came out of it.''
   The four-day sale continues through Friday at various sites. The
items up for sale today include 10 cars, 51 trucks, six buses,
heavy equipment such as forklifts and more marine supplies.
   Many in the crowd complained prices were too high. Some people
were upset about having to buy in lots. Microwave ovens were
clumped with animal shampoo, for example.
   Anchorage businessman Brian Watson, looking for equipment for
his water purification company, expressed awe at sky-high pallets
around him.
   ``The magnitude of this - and all because one ship blew it
big,'' he said.
   The Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound in March
1989 and spewed nearly 11 million gallons of crude in the nation's
biggest oil spill.
   Exxon crews worked two summers to clean up the mess and plan to
return next spring for a shoreline survey. Exxon officials said
they didn't sell any equipment that could be used for additional
cleanup.
   Parked cars lined the roads for miles in all directions and
Ritchie Bros. ran shuttle buses to the auction. An auctioneer in a
booth atop a truck sold rows of all-terrain vehicles and aluminum
skiffs, pallet after pallet of brand-new fishing nets and such
things as life jackets, tables and chairs.
   There was more inside a hangar, including outdoor thermometers
and clothing.
   A 1966 DeHaviland Beaver seaplane with an old Esso tiger painted
on its tail and uncertain salt-water wear sold for $435,000. New,
the plane would cost about $700,000, said several air-taxi company
officials in the crowd.
   Four used, nothing-special TV sets sold for a total of $2,000.
Exxon used the TVs and videocassette recorders, also for sale, to
show training tapes.
   ``Prices are way out of line. The people we know - the fishermen
- aren't buying anything. They're just shaking their heads,'' said
a Kodiak fisherman who wouldn't give his name.

   Share prices were lower at midday Wednesday, hit
by rumors of U.S. troop movements in the Middle East.
   The late morning rumor knocked the main index down about 10
points, traders said. Since then, a U.S. Pentagon official has
denied any U.S. troop movements in the region.
   ``The market fell like a lead duck,'' one trader said,
underscoring how susceptible the market is to Middle East
developments.
   The increased tensions Tuesday and the rumor Wednesday have once
again scared investors away from the market, traders said.

<TEXT>
   MGM-UA settled a $200 million shareholders'
lawsuit for $35 million, and the troubled entertainment firm said
it would file suit against insurers who it said forced MGM-UA into
the settlement.
   ``The settlement was forced on the company by a bad faith
settlement by its insurers,'' attorney Terry Christensen said
Tuesday. He represents billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, the sole
defendant in the class action suit.
   The action charged that Kerkorian's purchase of United Artists
from Turner Broadcasting in 1986 robbed shareholders of profits. In
the deal, Turner got the MGM and RKO Warner film libraries.
   The suit alleged Kerkorian, the controlling stockholder,
undervalued United Artists when he sold MGM-UA Entertainment to
Turner, then bought back UA.
   MGM-UA was sold for $1.5 billion, while Kerkorian bought back UA
for $470 million.
   The suit claimed Kerkorian failed to get the highest possible
price for the MGM-UA stock. Kerkorian retained UA's film library,
which includes such perennial stock as the ``Rocky'' and ``James
Bond'' movies.
   Christensen claimed that the bad faith actions were taken by
Harbor Insurance Co., Forum Insurance Co., Associated International
Insurance Co., and National Union Fire Insurance Co. Late calls
made to the insurers' Los Angeles offices rang unanswered.
   MGM-UA is suing to recover the $35 million settlement amount
plus punitive damages, Christensen said.
   ``Although we steadfastly deny any wrongdoing on MGM-UA's part,
we were compelled to reach this settlement,'' Christensen said.
   ``It is outrageous that any insurance company would take such
actions without a client's knowledge and consent and in total
disregard of its interests,'' he said. ``Their attempts to
partially settle the suit completely undermined our efforts to
defend it.''
   Class-action attorney Michael Hennigan said the settlement was
given preliminary approval Tuesday. Final approval is expected Nov.
19.
   He said the money will be divided among thousands who held
MGM-UA stock between 1985 and 1986.

<BYLINE>China Plans Partial Return to Collective Farming</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese leaders are cautiously planning a partial
return to collective farming in hopes of raising productivity,
according to an official newspaper report Wednesday.
   Ten years after land was distributed to individual farming
households, Communist Party and government officials recently
decided that ``household contracted lands should be redistributed
... and production conducted under a unified plan,'' the
English-language China Daily said.
   China's reformist leaders dismantled the commune system a decade
ago, allowing the rural economy to return to a family farming
system that allowed farmers to sell some crops on the free market.
As a result, grain production jumped by one-third and rural incomes
tripled.
   But that growth has stagnated. China's farmable land is
shrinking annually because of industrial development, and plots
worked by individual farmers, averaging 1.5 acres, are too small
for efficient mechanized farming.
   At the recent national meeting, party and government officials
decided that ``conglomerates in charge of supply, production and
sales'' would be established to make large-scale mechanized farming
possible, the China Daily reported.
   It did not say what incentives farmers would have to join the
conglomerates or give details about how the conglomerates would be
set up.
   Supporters of such a system have carefully avoided calling the
collectives ``communes,'' which evoke unpleasant memories of
extreme poverty and the leadership's ``leftist mistakes.''
   Aware that the change is likely to be unpopular among China's 80
million peasant population, officials stressed the household
contract system was not being abandoned. Rather, it would be
incorporated into a ``two-tier rural economy'' along with the
collective sector.
   Redistribution will be done with the consent of the majority of
local farmers, the report said.
   Calls have been heard for several years for a return to
large-scale farming. Experts say the family farmer who brought
prosperity to many rural areas has outlived his usefulness and must
make way for large-scale mechanized farming.

   The Supreme Court has boosted a bid by the
nation's seven regional telephone companies to enter the
multibillion dollar industry of providing electronic information
services to homes and businesses.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal Tuesday aimed at
making it harder for the companies to enter the developing
industry.
   The underlying issue is whether the companies, so-called Baby
Bells, should be allowed to use their phone lines to sell such
information as stock market quotes and ``electronic Yellow Pages''
with home-shopping and classified advertising.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here handed the Baby Bells a
crucial victory in April.
   The appeals court threw out part of a 1987 ruling by U.S.
District Court Judge Harold Greene, who has overseen the breakup of
the AT&amp;T phone monopoly for more than a decade.
   The appeals court said Greene was too strict in barring the
regional companies from selling the information services. It sent
the case back to him with instructions to use a more lenient test -
whether lifting the ban would be in the public interest.
   Asking the Supreme Court for help was a coalition of consumer
groups, long-distance phone companies, equipment manufacturers,
data-processing businesses and newspapers that want to enter the
at-home information market.
   The coalition, including the American Newspaper Publishers
Association, said the appeals court ruling could restore the
bottleneck that once blocked competition to Ma Bell.
   The appeals court ruling jeopardizes the vigorous economic
growth spawned by the breakup of AT&amp;T in 1984, the coalition said.
   But the phone companies said their opponents are trying to kill
legitimate competition and that most Americans will be slow in
getting information services unless the Baby Bells participate.
   The Bush administration sided with the phone companies in urging
the Supreme Court to leave the appeals court ruling undisturbed.
The Justice Department defended the public-interest standard in the
appeals court decision and said any high court review now would be
premature.
   Greene's 1987 decision loosened the information services
restrictions somewhat to let phone companies set up local numbers
that customers could call to connect to many different computer
data bases. But it upheld the core restriction that the phone
companies can convey only other parties' data but not originate
data themselves.
   The phone companies also have been backing legislation in
Congress to remove Green's authority and many of the restrictions
he imposed.
   The case is MCI Communications vs. U.S., 90-9.

<TEXT>
   Rising fuel prices and a weakening
economy have forced American Airlines to send layoff notices to 40
workers as part of a plan to eliminate 1,000 jobs from its payroll.
   American spokesman Al Becker said today that ``almost all'' of
the laid off employees will be ``absorbed into other positions in
the company. We want to eliminate those jobs mainly through
attrition.''
   The Fort Worth-based airlines, which employs more than 90,400
workers, took the action ``to reduce costs,'' he said. ``The
(cost-cutting) plan isn't completed yet and won't be for several
more weeks.''
   Airline officials had said this past summer that American
planned to trim costs sharply, and a surprise hike in the price of
jet fuel last winter contributed to a first-quarter loss of $19.3
million.
   An unexpected decline in domestic air travel followed, helping
to slash second-quarter profits by 27 percent, to $129.2 million
when compared to the year-ago period.
   American officials had planned to reduce costs by implementing a
``head-count freeze'' in management and clerical ranks. The company
said it planned to eliminate about 1,000 jobs primarily through
attrition, but did not rule out layoffs if necessary.
   Becker said several American workers at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport, the largest of the carrier's seven
connecting hubs, were included in the layoffs. He did not know the
specific number.
   The American workers affected at D-FW, where the airline has
more than 12,000 workers, primarily are fleet service clerks, a
group that includes airplane cleaners and baggage handlers.
   American currently operates 541 aircraft.

<HEAD>Government Clings to Austral But People Prefer Dollar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICENTE L. PANETTA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government insists it won't
change the austral as Argentina's official currency - its fifth in
20 years. But many Argentines already have.
   Most every good and service in this Latin nation now is priced
in U.S. dollars as well as the devalued austral, making Argentina
one of the few countries in the world with two working currencies.
   Blue, purple and red bills mingle in wallets and purses with the
U.S. money that Argentines call ``greenbacks.'' Hotels,
restaurants, department stores and shops selling everything from
furs to eyeglasses accept either as cash.
   Doctors, dentists, lawyers, architects and other professionals
set fees in dollars, payable in dollars or australs at the exchange
rate of the day. So do insurance agents, plumbers, handymen and
even housemaids.
   Sonia Repetto, owner of a women's clothing store, explains why:
``I had my prices in australs when March hyperinflation took me by
surprise. When I went to restock the merchandise I had sold, I
found I could buy only 10 percent of what I needed.''
   The cost of living in March soared by 95 percent, eroding her
savings, purchasing power and confidence. ``I don't want to even
see an austral,'' Ms. Repetto said.
   Until last year, it was illegal to sell, rent, bank or borrow in
currency other than the austral. Regulations rarely were enforced,
bt people who skirted controls were regarded as black marketeers
and subject to fines and jail.
   Thousands of Argentines beset by inflation that topped 100
percent in 15 of the past 16 years took their chances. They bought
dollars and stashed $5 billion at home ``under the mattress,'' and
shipped perhaps 10 times that amount out of the country.
   Runs on the austral, introduced in mid-1985 at a value of $1.20
apiece, became common as speculators relentlessly bid against it by
buying dollars. The central bank almost went broke in early 1989
trying to prop up the national currency.
   Inflation and devaluation knocked out the peso in 1970, the peso
ley in 1983 and the peso Argentino two years later. They also and
have put the austral on the ropes.
   The money supply is a tiny 4 percent of gross domestic product
partly because no one wants the austral. Its exchange value vs. the
dollar fell to the current 5,700-to-1 from a rate of 17-to-1 in
early 1989.
   A big banknote then was 100 australs. The biggest today:
500,000.
   Central Bank President Javier Gonzalez Fraga admits, ``The
majority of Argentines have their savings in dollars.''
   President Carlos Menem bowed to reality when he took office 15
months ago. He removed exchange controls and authorized savings
accounts, certificates of deposit and bonds in dollars.
   Concerned about inflation's effect on investment and relative
prices, the government now is considering offering mortgages, loans
and checking accounts in dollars.
   Car dealers raised eyebrows earlier this year when they refused
to accept payment in australs, which were losing value by the hour.
   Now, prices on the grain exchange are quoted in dollars. So are
hamburgers and sodas by a street vendor at Constitution Station.
Commuters can buy one of each for a buck.
   ``All my suppliers bill me for wood in dollars, so I sell my
doors, shelves and everything else in dollars,'' said Carmelo
Gremoni, a 60-year-old carpenter.
   Alberto Testa collects premiums for an insurance company that
shifted bills from australs to dollars during an inflationary
outburst, and last month tried to resume billing in australs.
   ``They had to redo everything because the customers
complained,'' Testa said. ``They got used to paying in dollars.''
   The ``dollarization'' of the economy provoked panic when the
government hinted last December it intended to link wages and
fiscal expenditures to the U.S. currency to restrict state
spending.
   On New Year's weekend, speculators bid up the dollar to
6,000-to-1 - three times the free market rate at the time. Hoarding
and shortages occurred. Opponents said the proposal meant a loss of
sovereignty.
   The government backed off, but the dollar's influence expanded
anyway as the exchange rate held steady at slightly above
5,200-to-1 since April while the cost of living in australs
continued to rise by 11 percent or more per month.
   Now, the dollar seems cheap as well as stable, and there are
fewer political and social objections to the widespread use of a
foreign currency.
   Bankers say the use of two currencies seems irreversible.
   Argentines' savings in dollars amounts to more than the entire
money supply in australs, and more than central bank reserves. And
most of it is outside the banking system and unavailable for
lending.
   Partly as a result, interest rates are high, investment is low
and no end is in sight for Argentina's deepest recession this
century.

<HEAD>End of Rains, Recession Fears Push Futures Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Grain and soybean futures drifted lower in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Overall, the market is being pressured by forecasts the rains of
the past few days will be ending. That will allow farmers to get on
with the harvest.
   Fears of a recession also are worrying the market and pushing
prices lower, said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Prices also are pressured lower by anticipation of the U.S.
Agriculture Department's October crop estimate, due out Wednesday.
The report is expected to put the estimated soybean crop at 1.832
billion bushels, and the corn crop at 8.060 billion bushels,
Lespinasse said.
   Corn futures are being pressured by the Soviet Union's denial of
rumors that it purchased U.S. corn overnight. And sluggish export
sales of soybeans are pushing those futures lower.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 1} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.77 a bushel; corn was a {
cent to 1 cent lower with December at $2.33\ a bushel; oats were a
\ cent to 1 cent lower with December at $1.21\ a bushel; soybeans
were 1 cent to 6\ cents lower with November at $6.28{ cents a
bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Selling was prompted by Tuesday's deep decline on the New York
Stock Exchange, which reinforced belief the U.S. economy is
entering a recession.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .75 cent lower with October at 79
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent to .82 cent lower with
October at 87.70 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to .37 cent
lower with October at 56.55 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.10 cent to .55 cents lower with February at 63.90 cents a pound.
   Livestock and pork futures settled higher in Tuesday's trading.

   Three Supreme Court justices voiced doubts
today about the wisdom or legality of an employer's ``fetal
protection'' policy that excludes all women of childbearing age
from some hazardous jobs.
   In a case that could affect millions of working women, Justices
John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia and Sandra Day O'Connor posed
questions seemingly critical of the policy during an hour-long
argument session.
   Stevens questioned Stanley Jaspan, a lawyer for the
Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls Inc., about the risks to women
working in its battery-making factories.
   ``Is the slightest risk enough'' to justify banning women from
some jobs, Stevens asked.
   O'Connor and Scalia took issue with Jaspan's interpretation of
what burdens Congress placed on employers when it passed the
Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978.
   Scalia told Jaspan his suggestion that the 1978 law means
employers cannot discriminate against women based on pregnancy
except to protect a fetus ``is to make a farce of the Pregnancy
Discrimination Act. You're making it a ridiculous piece of
legislation.''
   Since 1982, Johnson Controls, the nation's largest auto battery
manufacturer, has barred women from factory jobs that expose them
to unsafe levels of lead, the principal material used in making
batteries.
   The policy was upheld by lower courts.
   Lead exposure is a health risk for female workers and their
fetuses.
   Lead exposure, of course, also is a health risk for male
workers. But the scientific proof that high levels of lead in a
man's blood can contribute to fetal harm is sketchy.
   ``It would violate common sense ... to require an employer to
damage unborn children,'' Jaspan argued. He said lead exposure
``poisons the fetus and causes permanent brain damage.''
   But San Francisco lawyer Marsha Berzon, representing those who
challenged the Johnson Controls policy, said ``the net effect of a
policy like this is to sanction the re-segregation of the
workplace.''
   She said such policies relegate women to stereotypical jobs such
as teaching, child care and nursing.
   The justices must decide by July whether the fetal protection
policy amounts to illegal discrimination.
   One federal appeals court judge, calling the case the most
important of its kind since Congress outlawed on-the-job sex bias
26 years ago, said the estimated number of women affected runs as
high as 20 million.
   At Johnson Controls, women who could not prove they were
infertile were forced to transfer to other jobs, although their
salaries were not cut. Some of the women were in their 60s.
   Fertile women now hired are ineligible for top-paying jobs at
the company's 13 plants, located in California, Delaware, Florida,
Illinois, Kentucky, North Carolina, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio,
Oregon, Texas, Vermont and Wisconsin.
   Eight employees and the United Auto Workers union challenged the
policy in court, alleging that it violates Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964.
   It was not the first such challenge. At least 15 major
corporations have fetal protection policies, and the American Civil
Liberties Union says lawsuits have been filed in behalf of hospital
technicians and factory and auto workers.
   Among the companies with such policies are General Motors,
Monsanto and DuPont.
   U.S. District Judge Robert W. Warren in Milwaukee ruled for
Johnson Controls before any trial was held, and the 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals voted 7-4 to uphold his ruling.
   Judge John L. Coffey wrote for the appeals court that the
differing treatment of women employees was based on a ``business
necessity.'' The appeals court concluded that the policy ``is
reasonably necessary to industrial safety.''
   Bush administration lawyers told the high court that a fetal
protection policy could be legal, but that it should be judged by a
standard more stringent than the ``business necessity'' test used
by the appeals court.
   In a strongly worded dissent to the appeals court ruling, Judge
Frank Easterbrook called the case the most important Title VII case
ever and said such policies could ``consign more women to `women's
work' while reserving better-paying but more hazardous jobs for
men.''
   He noted that lead is only one of many workplace substances that
could harm fetuses, and said as many as 20 million jobs could be
closed to women if the 7th Circuit court's rationale were adopted
nationwide.

<TEXT>
   Mesa L.P. has agreed to sell a portion of its oil
and gas properties and undeveloped land to Seagull Energy Corp. in
a deal that could reach $476 million, the companies announced
today.
   Under terms outlined in a letter of intent, Houston-based
Seagull will pay $376 million in cash for reserves
and acreage and assume $50 million in liabilities. Mesa also could
receive up to an additional $50 million in 1994, based on the
weighted average price of natural gas sold from the properties
between 1991 and 1993.
   The de the properties,al, which covers about 15 percent of the oil
and gas
company controlled by corporate raider T. Boone Pickens, is subject
to approval by Seagull's board and financing. The deal is expected
to close in December.
   ``These properties will greatly diversify our total reserve
portfolio, give us significant reserve positions and exploratory
prospects in geographic areas other than our historic Gulf Coast
area of emphasis, and extend the average reserve life of our
company's reserves,'' said Seagull Chairman Barry J. Galt.
   The assets to be purchased include Mesa's Midcontinent, Rocky
Mountain and Gulf Coast offshore properties and operations.
   Pickens said the sale would help Mesa increase ``our
concentration of hp of northern
islands seized at war's end.
   Japanese newspapers and the Kyodo News Service reported this
weekend that the Soviets had offered to return two of the four
disputed islands and sign a peace treaty within five years. But
Moscow on Monday denied offering any concessions, and its news
agency blasted the Japanese reports as ``disinformation'' aimed at
setting back a rapprochment.

<HEAD>Experts Say Hearing Not the Best Ending, But the Closest Thing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With or without Ivan Boesky, the first public
hearing on charges against financial felon Michael Milken is sure
to leave some followers of the biggest Wall Street fraud case
feeling, well, cheated.
   The ``mini-trial'' scheduled to begin Thursday is designed to
give U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood more information when she
sentences the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. executive to
anywhere from zero to 28 years in prison.
   It will include new allegations of wrongdoing by Milken,
testimony by former junk bond co-workers immunized against
prosecution and counterattacks by top-line defense lawyer Arthur
Liman.
   But some legal experts say that after a four-year investigation
and unprecedented charges painting Milken as Wall Street's Butch
Cassidy, Milken's plea bargain and the limited hearing are a poor
excuse for justice.
   ``We will never have confidence in knowing what happened,'' said
Albert Alschuler, a criminal law expert at the University of
Chicago Law School.
   ``If he is the biggest financial crook of the century it's not
severe enough,'' he said of Milken's April guilty plea to six
felonies. ``If he hasn't done anything wrong it's way too severe.''
   The Milken case has come to symbolize the free-spending,
merger-manic 1980s. Supporters portray the 44-year-old Milken as a
saintly philanthropist, humanitarian, savior of American finance.
Prosecutors call him systematic, calculating, greedy.
   Despite agreeing to pay $600 million in penalties as part of his
plea bargain, Milken's wealth still is estimated at $700 million.
But he lives modestly with his wife and three children in Encino,
Calif.
   Through hard work and what some call genius, Milken helped
create a $200 billion market for IOUs known as junk bonds that
transformed second-tier Drexel into a model of '80s success and
power.
   For those reasons - and the millions of dollars the government
has spent pursuing him - many legal experts feel the public
deserves a full examination of what if anything Milken did wrong.
   The mini-trial will focus on three allegations of insider
trading and securities fraud excluded from Milken's guilty plea.
Federal law permits sentencing judges to consider unproven crimes
in assessing a defendant's character.
   The proceeding itself has come under criticism because standards
of proof are lower than at an ordinary criminal trial. It's called
a Fatico hearing, after a 1979 case involving a thief whom
prosecutors wanted to show had ties to organized crime.
   ``If the government believes Mr. Milken has committed these
additional crimes and should be punished for them, it should be
required to prove them beyond a reasonable doubt at trial,'' Ira
Glasser, head of the American Civil Liberties Union, and Norman
Siegel, head of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said in a
letter to The New York Times this week.
   But others said the investigation, the abandoned 98-count
indictment, acceptance of the guilty plea and the Fatico hearing
are part of how the legal system works.
   ``Its job is not to tie all the loose ends of the plot
together,'' New York University law professor Stephen Gillers said.
``Judge Wood's job is to get the sentence right.''
   The government plans to call more than a dozen witnesses to
implicate Milken in illegal transactions involving securities of
Wickes Cos., Storer Communications Inc. and Caesar's World Inc.
dating to 1983.
   Prosecutors said Tuesday that Boesky, the inside trader who led
the government to Milken in 1986 after turning state's evidence,
wasn't likely to testify. Milken is expected to be in court during
the two-week hearing but it is unclear whether he'll take the
stand.
   The hearing amounts to a confrontation between young prosecutors
and Liman, best known as Senate counsel during the 1987 Iran-Contra
hearings.
   The government wants to demonstrate Milken's crimes were
serious, not technical violations. The defense will attempt to
disprove any Milken link to insider trading or predatory behavior
against his clients. Each will have 20 hours for testimony and
cross-examination.
   ``Strategically it's not useful for Milken,'' Gillers said.
``The government's going to be able to try to prove its other
criminal acts and there will be two weeks' worth of headlines about
those.''
   Liman has complained that the abbreviated hearing undermines
Milken's rights. He said government delays in turning over boxes of
evidence and listing witnesses have hampered his preparation.
   In a letter to the judge, Liman wrote that no one envisioned
that ``the peace that a plea agreement is intended to bring would
be turned into full-scale warfare.''
   Nonetheless, the hearing for the first time opens the window on
the government's case and could offer a revealing snapshot of
Milken's professional behavior. Wood has said she also will
consider Milken's charitable work and personal character, reflected
in scores of letters from friends and associates.
   But proving the allegations ``would go very far to justifying
the time and effort the government has put into this case,'' said
John Coffee Jr., a Columbia University securities law professor.
   ``You're talking about someone who was at the crossroads of
financial capitalism at the most dynamic firm on Wall Street,'' he
sai0.75,
down from $395.50 late Tuesday.
   Bullion dealers said their market was slack, with strong
resistance at attempts to push gold above $392.50. They said they
did not expect much activity until there are major developments in
the gulf.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid $392.15, down from
$395.35.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $4.53 a troy
ounce, down from $4.68.

   Teamsters Union President William J. McCarthy
announced today he will not seek re-election to the post due to
``personal reasons.''
   R.V. Durham of North Carolina, a union vice president, has been
endorsed by a majority of the union's board members as the board's
candidate to replace McCarthy, the Teamsters also announced.
   McCarthy, 71, has had a minor stroke and open heart surgery. He
made the announcement at a union board meeting in West Palm Beach,
Fla. A brief statement was released by the union's headquarters in
Washington.
   ``He has decided for personal reasons not to seek re-election to
the post. ...'' the statement said.
   Union sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there
were deep political divisions within the Teamsters' 21-member
board. Certain factions were opposed to McCarthy running again, the
sources said.
   McCarthy succeeded the late Jackie Presser two years ago. His
departure left the union's executive board free to assemble a slate
of candidates for officer positions without him.
   At least 15 of the board's 21 members are endorsing Durham as
McCarthy's replacement, a Teamsters official said.
   The union's elections will take place in three stages before
December 1991 under government-supervised procedures agreed to in a
settlement of a civil racketeering suit brought by the Justice
Department.

<TEXT>
   An agreement that would allow U.S. and
Canadian companies to sell their securities across the border using
their own countries' approved disclosure documents could be in
effect as early as next year if a proposal aired Wednesday is
approved.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission voted unanimously to seek
public comment on rules changes that would allow Canadian companies
to use forms and documents from their home country to satisfy U.S.
disclosure requirements.
   A reciprocal agreement allowing U.S. companies to use U.S.
documents when selling stocks and bonds north of the border is
pending in Canada.
   SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden said the proposal could be ``a
prototype for offerings between the United States and other
countries.''
   The SEC proposal cannot become final until the SEC staff reviews
the comment letters and submits the rule change to the
commissioners for a final vote. Breeden said he hoped that could be
achieved by the end of the year or early 1991.
   The five-member SEC was created by Congress to oversee the
stocks and bonds markets and other aspects of the securities
industry to protect the investing public from fraud.
   SEC regulations require companies offering securities for sale
to the public to disclose enough information for investors to make
informed decisions. Among other things, companies issuing
securities must say why they need the money from securities sales,
who runs the company and how much money it owes to banks and other
lending institutions.
   Some foreign companies have opted not to offer their stocks or
bonds in the United States because they are unwilling to divulge
such information.
   Others simply don't want to bother with the added expense of
hiring lawyers, accountants and other professionals needed to
complete the complex documents.
   The proposal, a revised version of one first offered in July
1989, would allow Canadian concerns, under certain restrictions, to
sell their securities here using disclosure documents approved by
Canadian regulators.
   For example, the revised rules would let any Canadian company
sell stock in the United States using Canadian disclosure documents
if the firm has been registered with a Canadian regulator for at
least three years, has $75 million in shares outstanding and $300
million market capitalization.
   A reciprocal agreement allowing U.S. companies to sell their
stock in Canada using U.S. disclosure documents will be considered
by securities regulators in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario,
where Canada's major stock exchanges are located.
   Canada does not have a nationwide securities regulator.
   ``The purpose of this rule is to make it easier for companies in
both the U.S. and Canada who want to raise capital to support their
activities, growth and development,'' said Breeden.
   The public meeting was the first attended by the newest SEC
commissioner, Richard Y. Roberts, who was sworn in last week. It
marked he first time in more than a year there were no vacancies
on the five-member commission.

<HEAD>States Attract Banks With Card Deregulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the great chase to attract jobs, state after
state banked on deregulation during the 1980s to bring credit card
issuers to their doors.
   South Dakota acted first, attracting the plum of the industry,
Citibank, in 1980. Delaware followed quickly, and 18 other states
have since removed their ceilings on rates or fees as they
scrambled to create cozy environments for credit card issuers.
   But critics question whether the state legislatures in their
rush to deregulate plastic have trampled over consumers by allowing
the banks to charge high interest rates and the now-prevalent
annual fees.
   ``There's no question in our minds that one of the reasons the
states are taking these actions is to lure bank card operations
from other states with the promise that these card operations will
be able to charge any rates and fees they choose,'' said Elgie
Holstein, director of Bankcard Holders of America, a Herndon,
Va.-based consumer group.
   ``From that standpoint, there has been throughout the 1980s a
continuing willingness by state policy makers to look the other way
as rates go higher,'' he said.
   Holstein said that prior to 1980, there were virtually no annual
fees for credit card users. Now, they're commonplace and cost
anywhere from a few dollars a year to an average of $34 for premium
``gold'' cards.
   Credit card interest rates also have remained consistently high
in recent years - hovering around 19 percent on average -
regardless of changing economic conditions.
   ``When there's been periods of rate decline, credit card rates
remain stubbornly high,'' said Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank
Rate Monitor in North Palm Beach, Fla.
   For example, he noted, rates for certficiates of deposit fell
1.66 percentage points since April 1989, while at the same time
credit card rates rose an average of two-thirds of a point.
   Nonetheless, state officials say deregulation has proven itself
to be a solid means of attracting jobs. And the bank industry
maintains deregulation has benefited consumers by increasing
competition among card issuers and widening access to credit.
   South Dakota and Delaware, by acting early in passing attractive
legislation, have won a solid hold as the premier host states for
credit card business and continue to dominate the field.
   A ripple has been created in Georgia recently by the success of
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s Universal Card, which was
introduced last spring and already has 2.7 million cardholders. The
card is issued by the Universal Bank, a subsidiary of Columbus,
Ga.-based Synovus Financial Corp.
   Credit card banks such as Universal, which deal exclusively in
bankcards, are sometimes called ``non-banks'' and are not subject
to all the regulations as full-service institutions.
   ``They're not street-front operations. They're strictly
second-floor operations,'' said Robert Moler, deputy commissioner
of the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance.
   Non-banks have become more prevalent since the wave of credit
card deregulation that began a decade ago when South Dakota changed
its laws to attract Citibank's credit card operation from New York.
   That move came in the wake of a 1978 U.S. Supreme Court decision
that said banks must adhere to the credit card interest rate limits
of their home state. Some banks then sought to locate in states
with unlimited rates structures so they could ``export'' those
rates.
   ``The whole concept really comes down to jobs,'' said Steve
Szekely of Payment Systems Inc. of Tampa, Fla., a industry research
organization. ``When the banks started making moves, the states had
to relax (interest rate) restrictions to keep the jobs.''
   Richard Duncan, state banking director in South Dakota, said
Citibank and the eight other credit card issuers who have moved to
his state since 1980 have had a significant impact on the economy
there.
   ``What it's done for the state is bring in employment and
revenue that I'm sure has exceeded what was anticipated,'' Duncan
said.
   Citibank employs 2,000 people in South Dakota and pumps in more
than $20 million a year through the state franchise tax. ``In a
state the size of South Dakota, which only has about 700,000
people, that makes a difference,'' Duncan said.
   Still, consumer groups say the job impact from the average
issuer - much smaller than the Citibanks of the world - does not
justify the higher rates and fees that accompany deregulation.
   The credit card business is extremely capital intensive and
generally does not require a large work force, said Holstein, of
the Bankcard Holders. ``You're getting a handful of jobs but
millions of dollars extra (are) paid by consumers,'' he said.
   But Virginia Stafford, spokeswoman for the Washington-based
American Bankers Association, said deregulation has increased
access to credit by putting more players in the market and making
banks more competitive.
   ``The bank card business is a volume kind of business,'' she
said. ``It's allowed consumers to have access to credit cards that
they ordinarily wouldn't have access to locally.''
   Without deregulation, credit cards may have become available
mainly to wealthy customers, considered safe risks by the banks,
she said.
   Standardized disclosure requirements, in place since last year,
also have provided consumers with more information about the cards
so that they may shop around for the best deal, Ms. Stafford added.
   South Dakota's Duncan maintains that competition from the
growing field of card issuers has helped keep rates from getting
out of hand.
   ``You can get credit cards from a barrage of sources,'' he said.
``The price may be a little higher but I think people are willing
to pay a little more to get the convenience.''
   Moler, of the Georgia banking department, said the credit card
banks, because of their narrow focus, escape some of the
regulations applied to full service banks, such as being tested for
how well they serve the needs of a community. But the banks'
activities are restricted to issuing cards.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Bruce Reid said his company put in more than two
years of research before deciding on the Georgia bank to unveil the
Universal card. ``Georgia laws are very favorable, as they would be
in South Dakota and Delaware. The regulatory climate . . . was what
we were looking for,'' he said.
   The Universal Card's temporary offer of a lifetime ban on annual
fees, and the ability to use the card as an AT&amp;T calling card has
contributed to its success, analysts say.
   But it also prompted some banks who issue MasterCard and Visa,
including Citibank parent Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp., to
file complaints with the federal government that the Universal
``non-bank'' had an unfair advantage because of its telephone
tie-in.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as the market reacted
to sagging export demand for U.S. products.
   Corn futures were influenced by slack demand from overseas, with
the Soviet Union denying it had purchased U.S. corn overnight in
Europe. It received some support from reports the Soviets would
eventually make a purchase.
   Slack sales by farmers also gave a boost to corn prices.
   Overall, the market was pressured by forecasts the rains of the
past few days will be ending. That will allow farmers to get on
with the harvest, said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research
Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Trading was cautious in anticipation of the release Thursday of
the U.S. Agriculture Department's October crop production report.
   The report is expected to put the estimated soybean crop at
1.832 billion bushels and the corn crop at 8.060 billion bushels,
said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
in Chicago.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 3{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.76\ a bushel; corn was a \
cent to 1\ cents higher with December at $2.35{ a bushel; oats were
a { cent to 1 cent higher with December at $1.23 a bushel; soybeans

<HEAD>CBS Earnings Down 30 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. on Wednesday reported a 30 percent
decline in earnings in the third quarter, citing higher television
expenditures, partly for news coverage of events in the Middle
East.
   The network said net income fell to $43.5 million, or $1.69 per
share in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to $61.9 million, or
$2.40 per share during the same period in 1989.
   Net sales during the quarter were up 12 percent to $662 million
from $593 million in the year-ago period.
   Laurence A. Tisch, CBS president and chief executive, said
increased programming costs contributed to the weak quarter.
   He said the televison network spent more money on new program
development, first-run summer programming and the aquisition of
program rights for sporting events.
   The company said sales growth increased primarily from
broadcasts of major league baseball games.
   ``CBS's earnings are likely to continue to decline,'' Tisch
said. ``However, CBS has the cash reserves to steer through an
economic downturn, while sustaining our long-term plan to improve
ratings.''
   CBS reported earnings of $266.8 million, or $10.36 per share,
for the first nine months of 1990, compared to $236.8 million, or
$9.20 per share, in the 1989 period.
   Net sales for the nine-month period were $2.34 billion, compared
to $2.096 billion.
   Also Wednesday, the company's board of directors declared a cash
dividend of $1.10 per share on CBS common stock and a cash dividend
of 25 cents per share on CBS series A preference stock.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp. said Wednesday its
earnings rose nearly 9 percent in the third quarter as the
company's broadcasting, electronic and energy divisions posted
gains.
   Net income totaled $255 million, or 87 cents per share, on
revenue of $3.17 billion in the third quarter of 1990. That
compared with earnings of $235 million, or 80 cents a share, on
revenue of $3.12 billion in the same quarter of 1989.
   Profits for the first nine months increased 10 percent to $717
million, or $2.44 per share, compared with $652 million, or $2.23
per share, in the year-ago period.
   After adjusting last year's results for the divestiture of the
company's transmission and distribution business, revenues
increased about 11 percent in both the quarter and nine months,
Westinghouse said.
   ``I am very encouraged by our overall results in both the
quarter and year to date,'' said Westinghouse Chairman Paul E.
Lego. ``In light of the slowing and uncertain economy, this is an
excellent performance that reflects the great contribution that all
of our employees are making.''
   Recently acquired radio stations boosted the broadcasting
division's revenues and operating profits substantially in the
quarter, Westinghouse said.
   Revenues for the electronic systems division were higher because
of a better mix of business, the company said.
   Revenues and operating profit for the energy and utility systems
division were up significantly, mostly due to the strong
performance of the power generation business.

<HEAD>NYSE to Soviets: Sell Stock in Aeroflot, Intourist and Oil
Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street executives teaching the Soviets about
financial markets said Wednesday they told their hosts to start by
selling shares in the profitable state airline, tourist agency and
petroleum businesses.
   The U.S. delegation led by New York Stock Exchange Chairman John
J. Phelan Jr. also met for 90 minutes with President Mikhail
Gorbachev and signed a formal cooperation agreement with finance
officials to exchange information.
   Phelan told a news conference that Gorbachev asked them to
continue advising his government on its switch to a market economy,
which includes the re-establishment of stock exchanges.
   Several plans proposed to rescue the Soviet economy envisage a
stock exchange by the end of this year, but the government hasn't
set a specific time frame.
   ``I think that the stock exchange itself will emerge ... as the
result of the development of market relations in general throughout
the country,'' Finance Minister Valentin Pavlov told reporters
covering the NYSE delegation.
   ``How soon we will be able to realize that, I don't think we are
in a position - anyone is in a position - to give a firm answer.''
   More than 400 Soviet bankers, academics, researchers and
brokers-in-waiting attended a seminar given by the Americans in
Moscow's international trade center. They absorbed detailed
descriptions of how American markets work and prodded their
government officials to move faster to copy them.
   Many members of the Wall Street delegation recommended the
government start its privatization program with its most profitable
enterprises, such as the Aeroflot state airline, the Intourist
travel agency or parts of the nation's huge oil industry.
   The government is drafting legislation to permit stock
exchanges, but a businessmen's committee said it will register one
in Moscow next month whether or not the regulations are in place.
The new Moscow Commodities Exchange, which held one day of listless
trading last month, said it was also trying to set up an equities
section.
   Pavlov predicted any fledgling Soviet stock exchange would begin
by trading bonds, rather than equities.
   That would give the government time to develop a plan to sell
off its wealth of factories and other means of production. Since
June, it has allowed some state enterprises to become joint-stock
companies but has generally retained a majority interest.
   Bonds, usually issued by governments, pay the buyer a fixed
annual interest rate and can be redeemed at a specified date.
   John Chalsty, president of the securities firm Donaldson, Lufkin
&amp; Jenrette Inc., said trading in bonds would be ``a logical first
step.''
   ``There's more familiarity, I think, with fixed-income
securities bearing specified interest rates,'' he said in an
interview.
   ``It was my sense that a securities exchange can in fact be
established in relatively short order, that it can start trading
securities, mostly fixed-income, but that it will be a slow process
before you actually get stocks, shares of ownership, traded on the
exchange,'' he said.
   ``I don't know when that will come because that will depend on
the progress of privatization.''
   Phelan said a successful stock exchange will also require a
cultural change among the Soviet people, many of whom remain
suspicious of entrepreneurs.
   ``There also has to be ... a feeling that it's not illegal to
have a profitable negotiation between two people, that profit is
what drives the economy and makes it more efficient,'' he said.
   ``That's going to take time to change and come about.''
   Pavlov agreed.
   ``As soon as neighbors will become aware that it is profitable
to buy stock, much more profitable than hoarding money in the
mattress, then we can expect a breakthrough,'' he said.

<HEAD>Forstmann Planning New Buyout Fund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buyout strategist Theodore Forstmann is seeking
investors for a $1.5 billion fund that would finance acquisitions
of companies by using debt, a source knowledgable about the
proposal said Wednesday.
   The venture is likely to be watched by Wall Street as a
barometer of the market for debt-financed buyouts. Since the
collapse of the junk bond market a year ago, many investors have
shunned the idea of funding acquisitions primarily with debt.
   The source said Forstmann is planning to offer investors in his
fund yields 1 percent above the interest rate on five-year Treasury
bonds, which now yield about 8.5 percent.
   Forstmann is seeking about 20 institutional investors, according
to the source, who spokeon condition of anonymity.
   A spokesman for Forstmann, John Scanlon, declined comment on the
proposal, and refused to confirm or deny the buyout strategist's
plans.
   Forstmann has long opposed the use of junk bonds - which have
yields as high as 20 percent - to fund buyouts, although his debt
funds, like junk bonds, are subordinated, falling behind bank debt
and secured debt in credit rankings.
   However, Forstmann says his brand of debt financing differs from
junk bonds because it is not publicly underwritten and because his
investors take a 37.5 percent equity stake in acquired companies.
   Despite the slowdown in mergers and takeovers, Forstmann's
buyout firm, Forstmann Little &amp; Co., has been quite active,
acquiring General Instrument Corp. for $1.6 billion in August, and
participating in the buyout of Chrysler Corp.'s Gulfstream
Aerospace Corp. earlier this year.
   Last year, Forstmann tried but failed to put together a fund,
known as a white squire fund, that planned to take large stakes in
companies that were overburdened by debt.

<HEAD>Delaware Will Join Lawsuit Against Federal Reserve</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOVER, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state of Delaware plans to join a lawsuit
against the Federal Reserve Board to overturn an order that blocks
Citicorp from selling and underwriting insurance nationwide.
   Citicorp filed suit against the Fed late last week in U.S.
Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.
   In early September, the Fed ruled that a new Delaware law
allowing banks to sell and underwrite insurance nationwide gave
financial institutions powers prohibited by federal regulations.
   Citicorp is arguing the Fed lacks jurisdiction over Delaware law
because Citicorp's insurance company, Family Guardian, is a
division of the bank, not a subsidiary.
   Delaware Bank Commissioner Keith Ellis said Tuesday the state
plans to ask the court to allow it to become a party to the suit,
rather than limit itself to filing a friend of the court brief.
   ``The state has a real interest in becoming a part to the suit
as a way of showing our independent interest in the case,'' Ellis
said.
   Citicorp began selling primarily life and health insurance
through Family Guardian after Delaware's legislation became law in
May.
   Delaware officials said the law satisfied requirements of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to protect insured deposits. But
the Fed said the state went too far to protect depositors.

   Unemployment in the European Community
rose 0.1 percent to 8.4 percent in August, the EC Commission said
in a statement Wednesday.
   The rise is the first in the 12-nation trade bloc since February
and prompted Commission Vice P resident Henning Christophersen to
call for the speeding up of economic and monetary union within the
EC.
   Christophersen said in a statement, however, it was important
not to ``over- interpret'' the increase, with many graduates
entering the job market for the first time.
   Overall unemployment in August 1989 was 9.2 percent.
   The Commission figures showed unemployment for persons under 25
running at 15.8 percent in August, down from 17.3 percent a year

   Their names were Fuji, Judo, Mazda and
Ryusho. Before they died of old age years ago, they left behind a
genetic legacy worth millions for cattle breeder Don Lively, but
which the Japanese claim was a stolen national treasure.
   The legacy is semen - collected from the four Japanese bulls and
brought to the United States in a shroud of secrecy 14 years ago.
   Some people now say the semen is a rare commodity that could
revolutionize the beef industry in both countries.
   Lively's stockpile of semen from the famed Wagyu cattle
(pronounced Wog-you), believed to be the only ones of the breed to
ever leave their homeland, is estimated to be worth $2 million.
   Cattlemen and agribusiness companies from all over the orld
have come clamoring to Lively's LoDo Ranch to buy some of the semen
so they can start breeding their own herds of Wagyu cattle.
   The Wagyu's tender, slightly sweet-tasting meat, called Kobe
beef, is considered a delicacy that fetches up to $180 a pound in
Japan. The spindly legged and swaybacked beasts once only brought
bewildered stares from U.S. breeders, who prefer much stockier
cattle.
   Research from Texas A&amp;M University indicates Kobe beef is
markedly lower in cholesterol than other beef.
   But ever since Japan said it would lift beef import quotas by
1991, American cattlemen have hungrily eyed the Wagyu. So have
Japanese investors with vast holdings of land in the United States.
   ``They can't increase cattle production in Japan. They don't
have the land,'' Lively said.
   Lively and his business partner, Rosebud rancher Fred
Hildebrand, already have sold off hundreds of the semen samples,
used to artificially inseminate cows, for about $1 million. Each
vial costs $250.
   ``People used to think I was crazy for having these cattle,''
says Lively, 62.
   The Japanese have always been fond of the cattle and reluctant
to share the breed with the rest of the world. They have closely
guarded the cattle and steadfastly refuse to export them.
   ``You'd be classified as a traitor if you brought it out of
Japan,'' Lively says. ``The Japanese are resentful that we have
Wagyu cattle. Some of them won't even admit these are Wagyu when we
show the cattle to them.''
   ``If you could raise Wagyu cattle here and be the first one to
back into Japan with Kobe beef you got yourself a market - be it a
niche or the corner on a billion dollars. It'll probably be a
billion dollars,'' he said.
   Lively and others in the beef industry also believe U.S.
breeders could reap huge profits off Wagyus in the domestic cattle
market, where some Wagyu cattle have sold for $20,000 to $30,000 a
head.
   There are about 900,000 head of Wagyu cattle in Japan today.
Fewer than 60 purebreds exist in the United States. Lively and his
partner own most of those.
   The first four Wagyu bulls, Lively says, were brought to the
United States by a Texas cattleman named Morris Whitney with the
help of a mysterious Japanese partner. Whitney later sold them to a
Georgetown veterinarian.
   Both men tried in vain to turn a profit on the cattle, seeking
out investors in a high-stakes cattle venture that soon went bust.
Lively says he and Hildebrand eventually ended up with the
seemingly worthless Wagyu bulls.
   Now their semen is worth a small fortune and a smiling Lively
refuses to eat any other kind of beef other than the Kobe meat he
raises.
   ``Why would I do that?'' he asks. ``I'm already eating the
finest beef around.''

<TEXT>
   Three of the Supreme Court's nine justices
gave a chilly reception Wednesday to an employer's ``fetal
protection'' policy that excludes women of childbearing age from
some hazardous jobs.
   In a case that could affect millions of working women, Justices
John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia voiced
doubts about the wisdom and legality of such a policy.
   The court is expected to decide by July whether the policy
amounts to illegal sex discrimination.
   The three justices, along with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy,
dominated an hour-long argument session. They posed numerous
questions to the two lawyers before them, firing their most biting
inquiries at Stanley Jaspan, who represented the Milwaukee-based
Johnson Controls Inc.
   Stevens seemed dubious when asking Jaspan about the overall risk
posed to women working at Johnson Controls' 13 battery-making
plants.
   When Jaspan argued that exposure to lead, the principal material
used in making batteries, ``poisons the fetus and causes permanent
brain damage,'' Stevens interrupted to ask, ``How often does this
happen?''
   He asked whether ``the slightest risk'' was enough to render
inapplicable a federal law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, banning on-the-job sex bias.
   O'Connor and Scalia took issue with Jaspan's interpretation of
what legal duty employers face under a 1978 amendment, called the
Pregnancy Discrimination Act, to the law.
   ``You are not coming to grips with the effect of the Pregnancy
Discrimination Act,'' O'Connor told Jaspan.
   And Scalia said Jaspan's suggestion that employers may treat
pregnant workers differently if fetal health is an issue ``is to
make a farce'' of the 1978 law. ``You're making it a ridiculous
piece of legislation,'' Scalia said.
   But Jaspan held firm in defending the company's policy. ``It
would violate common sense ... to require an employer to damage
unborn children,'' he argued.
   Marsha Berzon, the San Francisco lawyer representing the
policy's challengers, told the justices, ``The net effect of a
policy like this is to sanction the re-segregation of the work
force.''
   She said such policies could ``render women marginal workers and
oust them from the workplace.''
   One federal judge, calling the case the most important sex-bias
dispute in decades, said the estimated number of women affected
runs as high as 20 million.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Byron R. White
each asked only one question during Wednesday's session.
   Three court members - Justices David H. Souter, Thurgood

   Those who could not prove they were infertile were transferred

   Silver prices fell Wednesday to the lowest level
in more than 13 years, following crude oil prices lower as anxiety
over tension in the Middle East influenced currency and commodity
markets.
   Gold prices also fell, but not as sharply as silver. The dollar
was mixed.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, silver bullion for current
delivery settled at $4.409 a troy ounce, down from Monday's $4.593.
Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $4.53 a troy ounce,
down from $4.68. It was the lowest level for silver since August
1977.
   ``The big loser today was the silver market,'' said Bernard
Savaiko, senior metal analyst for Paine Webber Inc. ``It seemed to
follow the crude oil market lower.''
   Oil prices, which have doubled in the two months since Iraq
seized Kuwait, were wrenched down late in the day, partly because
of an unfounded rumor that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was dead.
   ``I think its mostly oil news today,'' said Robert Ryan,
corporate foreign exchange manager with the Bank of New York. ``The
dollar really hasn't done anything overall. There's just been a lot
of trading back and forth.''
   Traders said the Japanese yen was the only currency to show real
strength Wednesday.
   In Tokyo, banks and markets were closed for Sports Day, a
national holiday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 130.35 yen,
up from 129.95 yen in Tokyo late Tuesday. In New York, the dolla
settled at 129.48 yen, down from 130.25 yen on Tuesday.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9675, cheaper for
buyers than $1.9705 late Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.9695 to
buy one pound, less expensive than Tuesday's $1.9730.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates included: 1.5278 German marks, up from 1.5238; 1.2810 Swiss
francs, up from 1.2735; 5.1145 French francs, up from 5.1015;
1,145.00 Italian lire, up from 1,142.25, and 1.1491 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1506.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Tuesday included:
1.5285 German marks, up from 1.5245; 1.2785 Swiss francs, up from
1.2765; 5.1160 French francs, up from 5.1005; 1.7225 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.7185; 1,143.25 Italian lire, unchanged; and
1.1495 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1507.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery fell $1.60 to settle at $388.10 a troy ounce. Republic
National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $388.25,
down $2.50 an ounce from late Tuesday.
   Gold traded late in London at a bid price of $390.25 a troy
ounce, down from $396.25. The late bid price in Zurich was $390.75,
down from $395.50 late Tuesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid $392.15, down from
$395.35.

   Oil prices seesawed wildly in the futures market
Wednesday, first jumping into record territory above $41 a barrel
then tumbling on a vague rumor that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
had been killed.
   ``It's been a rumor-driven day,'' said Ann-Louise Hittle, a
senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
``Disregarding the rumors, some of the strength we have seen is not
being sustained.''
   Light sweet crude closed $1.71 lower at $38.69 per barrel for
November delivery contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Later delivery months were all down by more than $1 a barrel.
   In early trading, crude futures had moved to an all-time
exchange high of $41.15 per barrel, after closing above $40 per
barrel for the first time on Tuesday.
   Early oil prices were following the London futures market, which
had advanced on a rumor that U.S. troops had been dispatched into
Kuwait. The U.S. government squelched the rumor before the New York
exchange opened, but that failed to stop the momentum that oil had
gotten from the story.
   ``The strength was retained, just on general nervousness,''
Hittle said.
   Oil later turned downward on the Saddam death rumor.
   ``A lot of people thought that was a good reason to start
selling,'' said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with Pegasus
Econometric Group Inc., in Hoboken, N.J. Once the selling started,
there were no buyers pushing prices back up, traders said.
   The recent speculation surrounding oil contracts in the futures
market drew criticism Wednesday from Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman,
D-Conn., who asked regulators to take a closer look at the way
business is conducted on the mercantile exchange, a leading
petroleum market.
   ``The teeth of these speculator sharks are ripping away at the
muscle of our economy,'' Lieberman said.
   Lieberman suggested oil speculators should have to put up more
money when they make deals. He said the amount of oil they trade on
the futures market should perhaps be limited.
   The exchange has raised the amount investors must now put up to
make oil deals in what officials believe is an appropriate response
to the recent wild fluctuations, a spokeswoman said.
   At current prices, traders are required to put up about 20
percent to 25 percent of the value of the contract.
   There are limits on the amount of oil that can be traded at
once, basically 1 million barrels for next month delivery. But for
big oil companies, the limits can be raised to levels that the
exchange will not make public, the spokeswoman said.
   Oil's dive on Wednesday was imitated by other energy futures.
   Wholesale home heating oil dropped 5.10 cents to $1.0105 per
gallon on November contracts, with other months all down. Wholesale
unleaded gasoline was down 4.66 cents to 93.60 cents per gallon on
November contracts, with all other months down.
   Natural gas was unchanged at $1.94 per 1,000 cubic feet on
November contracts, while later delivery months fell.
   After the futures market closed, the leading industry group
released a report showing the U.S. crude stockpile had fallen
farther than many analysts had been predicting.
   The crude stocks dropped to 350.4 million barrels, from 354.6
million barrels a week earlier, but they remained above the level
of 337.1 million barrels a year earlier, the American Petroleum
Institute said in its weekly report.
   Gasoline stocks rose to 225.7 million barrels, from 223.9
million barrels a week earlier, although they were below the level
of 225.8 million barrels a year earlier. Stocks of distillates,
which include home heating oil, fell to 133.3 million barrels, from
134.8 million barrels a week earlier, but they remained above their
level a year earlier of 121.8 million barrels.
   The nation's refinery capacity fell to 87.6 percent, compared
with 91.2 percent aweek earlier and 88.3 percent a year earlier,
API said.

   Freeport-McMoRan Oil &amp; Gas Co. will pay
Alaska $331,000 to settle a lawsuit alleging the company underpaid
the state for its royalty share of North Slope oil, the state
announced Wednesday.
   New Orleans-based Freeport is the third company to settle with
the state in what is known as the Amerada Hess case, after the
first of 12 companies named in the lawsuit. Amerada Hess Corp.
settled last year for $318,624 and ARCO Alaska settled last month
for $287 million.
   Freeport was involved in the case after buying the interests of
Petro-Lewis Corp., which was named in the original lawsuit.
   Gov. Steve Cowper said the Freeport settlement was not large but
is another step in bringing the 13-year-old litigation to an end.
   Negotiations continue between the state and other companies
named in the lawsuit. The largest pending claim is $334 million
against BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc.

<HEAD>Progress Reported in Taj Mahal Debt Restructuring Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An adviser to bondholders of Donald Trump's Taj
Mahal casino reported progress Wednesday in talks to restructure
$675 million of the casino's debt.
   ``The talks are proceeding in a constructive fashion,'' said
Wilbur Ross, senior managing partner at Rothschild Inc., but he
added, ``You don't have a deal on anything till you have a deal on
everything.''
   The Taj Mahal faces a $47.3 million interest payment Nov. 15 on
the $675 million in bonds. The bonds were issued to finance
construction of the Atlantic City casino.
   Fitch Investors Service Inc., a credit rating company, reported
Wednesday that bondholders may seek an equity stake of up to 50
percent in the Taj Mahal. Ross said he had no comment on the
report, and would not discuss what concessions bondholders are
seeking from Trump in return for the restructuring.
   Trump currently holds all of the equity in the Taj Mahal as well
as his other Atlantic City casinos, Trump Plaza and Trump Castle.
   Trump Plaza has fared the best of the three, but all suffer from
the same cash flow malaise that has afflicted all casinos in the
city.
   In June, Trump reached an agreement with bankers who lent him
$65 million to meet interest payments on his bonds while he looked
for a more permanent solution to the problems of his debt-ridden
real estate and casino empire.
   Trump has an estimated $2 billion in bank debts in addition to
the $1.3 owed to casino bondholders.
   There have been a number of reports over the past few months
that Trump would sell the Plaza Hotel in New York or the Trump
Shuttle, the airline serving New York, Washington and Boston, to
help reduce his debt. However, there have been no announcements
from the Trump Organization about any asset sales.
   Fitch reported that some bondholders were seeking the closure or
liquidation of the Taj Mahal, but Ross called the report
``extremely far-fetched.''
   Ross said Trump also owes about $100 million to contractors and
banks who loaned him money for the Taj Mahal, which opened earlier
this year.

<HEAD>Strike Deadline Looms for GM-Canada Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. of Canada and union leaders
worked down to the wire Wednesday night to come up with a contract
proposal before a midnight strike deadline.
   Bob White, president of the Canadian Auto Workers, said the
deadline would not be extended. But on Wednesday evening, a union
spokesman said financial matters had been settled, leaving only
local issues to be resolved.
   The CAW represents 36,500 workers at GM. The company has 13
plants in Ontario and one in Ste.-Therese, Quebec.
   White said the main stumbling blocks in negotiations were the
company's plan to close a van plant in Scarborough and to lay off
workers at a trim plant in Windsor.
   GM has said it will cut 700 jobs at the Windsor plant, which
employs about 2,500 people making seat covers, seats and doors. But
the company announced last week it would delay closing the van
plant until spring 1992, giving 2,500 workers a few more months of
work.
   Key issues for the company are cost-competitiveness, job
flexibility and improved attendance.
   The basis for the talks is a contract the union reached with
Ford Motor Co. of Canada last month after a nine-day strike.
   It gives the company's 12,800 workers pay hikes averaging 6.4
per cent a year for three years. It also provides more long
weekends and a vacation bonus of 500 Canadian dollars ($435 U.S.).
   In the United States, the United Auto Workers reached a
tentative agreement Sunday with Ford. It closely follows a contract
the union reached last month with General Motors Corp., which
allows the automakers more flexibility but gives workers a greater
degree of job security.

<TEXT>
   Congressional negotiators reached a tentative
agreement Wednesday on auto emission standards, removing a major
obstacle that had threatened approval of a clean air bill this
year.
   A dispute over state enforcement of auto pollution requirements
had held up agreement on the motor vehicle section of the bill for
more than a week.
   The compromise calls for tougher tailpipe emission controls, a
phase-in of alternative fuel vehicles, and cleaner gasoline blends
in areas with the worst smog problem.
   ``It's a major breakthrough,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.,
head of the Senate negotiating team. He said the motor vehicle
section of the massive bill was ``the toughest obstacle'' to
resolving differences in the clean air bills that passed the House
and Senate earlier this year.
   With the touchy issue of auto emissions out of the way, the
staff negotiators, meeting behind closed doors, turned immediately
to what new controls should be imposed on industry to curb the
release of toxic chemicals.
   Congressional leaders, meanwhile, told heads of both the House
and Senate negotiating teams Wednesday they wanted the legislation
completed by Sunday, so the measure could clear Congress before the
planned Oct. 19 adjournment.
   Baucus said in an interview that he hoped the House-Senate
conferees might formally approve the legislation by next Monday.
``That's the goal,'' he said.
   The bill would be the first tightening of federal air pollution
laws in 13 years and imposes new emission requirements on electric
utilities, factories, thousands of small businesses and automobiles
to curb urban smog, acid rain and toxic releases.
   Agreement on the motor vehicles section had been considered one
of the trickiest areas to resolve in the talks which have been
going on since July 13.
   Both Senate and House negotiators said the agreement on motor
vehicles was a major step forward, but some still expressed concern
that the bill might be derailed in the closing days of the
congressional session.
   ``We've got two big sections left,'' said Sen. John Chafee,
R-R.I., one of the negotiators. These sections deal with toxic
chemical releases by industry and acid rain pollutants.
   Chafee estimated there was a ``70-30 chance'' of a bill clearing
Congress this year, but warned that even if a compromise bill is
completed by Sunday it still must then be approved by both chambers
where ``a very few people could derail it.''
   The compromise reached by staff members on auto emission must
still be approved formally by members of the House and Senate
conference committee, but that was described as all but certain.
   The compromise would require a 30 percent to 60 percent cut in
various smog-causing tailpipe emissions by 1998. It also calls for
a phase-in of alternative fuel cars through a pilot program in
California, which other states also could adopt; require fleets to
use alternative fuel vehicles and require that oil companies sell
cleaner burning gasoline in cities facing the worst smog problems.
   Daniel Weiss, who has followed the clean air debates for the
Sierra Club, called the compromise a ``very ambitious program'' for
cleaning the air in America's cities, but said in many areas the
benefits will not be seen until toward the end of the decade.
   ``The auto and oil companies would have to reduce their
pollution by far less than what they're capable of doing'' said
Weiss. He said in many areas such as alternative fuels for fleets
the controls were pushed back several years under the compromise.
   The compromise resolved concerns over state enforcement of auto
emissions standards, which had blocked significant progress in the
negotiations for more than a week.
   State air pollution control officials and others, including Gov.
Mario Cuomo of New York, had strongly objected to a provision in
the legislation that would have prevented states from adopting and
enforcing tougher emission controls already in effect in
California.
   The bill would have left enforcement to the federal
Environmental Protection Agency.
   But under the compromise, that provision was modified to require
that states adopt either the California emissions controls or stick
to the federal controls. Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., had sought the
prohibition to keep states from adopting numerous standards, which
he argued would require automakers to produce specially designed
cars in various states.

<TEXT>
   Silver futures prices plunged sharply Wednesday on New York's
Commodity Exchange as the market continued to be burdened by
abundant supplies.
   On other markets, oil prices declined on a market influenced by
rumors; grain and soybean futures were mostly lower; gold prices
fell; and livestock and pork futures retreated.
   Silver settled 18.4 cents 20.7 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in October at $4.409 a troy ounce.
   The 18.8 cent plunge for the December silver contract dropped
the metal to a 13-year low.
   ``The (reason) for the overall weakness of silver is simple.
There is a lot of silver around. The supply is enormous,'' said
Peter Cardillo, an analyst with Jesup, Josephthal &amp; Co. Inc. in New
York.
   Analysts noted that production of silver is increasing as demand
from automakers and the photographic industry is decreasing.
   Adding to the weakness of silver is the perception it is a base
metal and is prone to recession and inflation concern.
   ``Silver was once considered the poor man investment,'' Cardillo
said. ``In the past, silver would react to international turmoil.
Unfortunately, in recent years that has disappeared. It is not
considered the safe haven that it once was.''
   Profit-taking fueled a selloff of energy futures on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in trading that saw prices influenced by
rumors.
   Reports that U.S. troops have invaded Kuwait sent prices higher
in early trading. But prices fell after the State Department denied
military action was taking place, and slipped lower on rumors of
the death of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Those rumors were also
proven false.
   Profit-taking was the primary factor behind the drop in prices,
said Andrew Lebow, an analyst with E.D. &amp; F Man International
Futures Inc. He noted there was little fresh news from the Middle
East to influence the market.
   Light sweet crude was 41 cents to $1.71 lower with November at
$38.69 a barrel; heating oil was 1.87 cents to 5.10 cents lower
with November at $1.010 a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 2.70cents
to 4.66 cents lower with November at 93.60 cents a gallon.
   Gold futures were pushed lower due to weakness in energy market,
analysts said.
   Cardillo noted that gold has not reacted strongly to the crisis
in the Middle East because producer nations continue to unload
their gold supplies.
   Gold was $1.60 to $1.80 lower with October at $388.10 a troy
ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Corn futures were influenced by slack demand from overseas. It
received some support from reports the Soviets would eventually
make a purchase.
   Slack sales by farmers also gave a boost to corn prices.
   Overall, the market was pressured by forecasts the rains of the
past few days will be ending. That will allow farmers to get on
with the harvest, said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research
Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Trading was cautious in anticipation of the release Thursday of
the U.S. Agriculture Department's October crop production report.
   Wheat was 1 cent to 3{ cents lower with delivery in December at
$2.76\ a bushel; corn was a { cent to 1{ cents higher with December
at $2.35{ a bushel; oats were a { cent to 1 cent higher with
December at $1.23 a bushel; soybeans were 4{ cents to 9{ cents
lower with November at $6.25 a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were lower in trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Pork prices were pressured by a drop in cash prices.
   Slack demand for beef products pushed livestock futures lower.
Analysts said the market also was pressured by concerns that the
U.S. economic outlook is weak.
   Live cattle were .37 cent to .88 cent lower with October at
79.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .85 cent lower
with October at 87.70 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to .50 cent
lower with October at 56.57 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
1.10 cent lower to .20 cent higher with February at 63.40 cents a
pound.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge acquitted three former Sundstrand
Corp. executives Wednesday on charges of lying to the government in
connection with the defense contractors' admitted Pentagon fraud
scheme.
   The ruling left pending charges of conspiracy to defraud the
government and scheming to conceal the conspiracy. U.S. District
Judge Prentice H. Marshall said he will rule on those counts next
Tuesday morning.
   Marshall granted a defense motion for acquittal that was entered
after the government rested its case last week. The bench trial
began Sept. 10.
   ``Would you be surprised if I said I was pleased?'' said Michael
B. Nash, the attorney for Ralph G. Hamann, former Sundstrand
section manager for government contracts.
   Hamann was charged along with Joseph J. McCarthy, Sundstrand's
former vice president for finance and administration, and Ray John
Chapel Jr., former director of business planning.
   Chapel and Hamann each were charged with four counts of making
false statements to government officials. McCarthy was charged with
two counts.
   All of the charges carry the same maximum penalty: five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Keith Syfert, the lead prosecutor in the case, declined comment
on the ruling.
   The three men are the only Sundstrand officials to have been
charged in connection with the Rockford company's 1988 admission
that it overbilled the Pentagon from May 1980 through August 1985.
   The company pleaded guilty to five counts of criminal fraud, was
suspended for nearly four months as a government contractor and
paid the government $199 million in fines and penalties, the
largest defense contracting fraud settlement ever.
   In its plea agreement, Sundstrand admitted billing the
government millions of dollars for such expenses as babysitting,
golf, movies and snow plowing for executives.

   Slow domestic sales have forced toy maker
Hasbro Inc. to lay off about 90 white collar workers, a spokesman
said Wednesday.
   Hasbro, which makes G.I. Joe, Cabbage Patch Kids, Tinkertoys and
the New Kids on the Block doll, laid off employees from sales,
research and development, marketing and administration, said
spokesman Wayne S. Charness.
   ``It cut across the domestic toy staff,'' he said. The reduction
represents about 3.6 percent of Hasbro's statewide work force of
about 2,400 and about 1 percent of its 8,000 employees worldwide,
Charness said.
   In a statement, Alfred J. Verrecchia, chief operating officer,
said the company had to cut costs because of the slowing economy.
   About 750 people were laid off in Lancaster, Pa. earlier this
year when Hasbro moved the operations of a manufacturing plant
there to New England.
   Other than the traditional seasonal slowdown around
Thanksgiving, no other layoffs are expected this year, Charness
said.
   Seven weeks ago, Hasbro chairman and chief executive Alan G.
Hassenfeld announced a sweeping reorganization to prepare for new
spending cuts and to help lift sagging profits.
   A general retail slump saw second quarter profits drop nearly 52
percent from the comparable period a year earlier. The
Pawtucket-based company earned $8.7 million from April through
June, compared to $18.1 million during the same three months of
1989.
   The estimated costs of the layoffs will appear in Hasbro's
third-quarter results.
   Charness said the workers received a generous severance package,
but declined to provide details.

   Here are details of three alleged illegal
transactions prosecutors claim were committed by junk bond
financier Michael Milken that will be aired at a special court
hearing starting Thursday.
   The allegations were contained in the government's
pre-sentencing memorandum accusing the former Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. financier of widespread wrongdoing beyond the six
felonies to which he has pleaded guilty.

   The government claims Milken used nonpublic information to buy
more than $3 million in Caesar's bonds in 1983 prior to
announcement of debt restructuring managed by Drexel. The
government says the bonds were bought by Drexel and sold two days
later to Milken's personal retirement account.
   The government says the idea for a debt-for-stock swap was
broached at a June 29, 1983, meeting among Milken, other Drexel
executives and Caesar's representatives. The government claims
Caesar's officials favored the idea and committed to it July 1; the
defense maintains that didn't happen for a week.
   The bond purchases by Drexel were dated June 30 and in turn were
sold to Milken a day later.
   Milken's lawyers said the Securities and Exchange Commission in
1985 investigated the trading and found no wrongdoing. They said
Caesar's had not decided on a restructuring when Drexel made the
purchases.

   Prosecutors allege Boesky bought Storer securities in July 1985
after Milken tipped him about a proposed leveraged buyout by
Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts &amp; Co., which hired Drexel to secure
financing. Prosecutors claim more than $1 million in trading
profits were credited to Drexel in January 1986.
   According to court papers, Milken allegedly bribed money
managers to buy risky Storer securities by selling other securities
of the Florida cable television company at below market value. They
allege Milken also misappropriated warrants that would allow a
purchase of 25 percent of the company to private partnerships in
which he had an interest.
   The government alleges that cash proceeds from the Storer
transactions surpassed $325 million, with Milken and another
unidentified individual personally making $172 million in 1988.
   Milken's lawyers say the claims are ``based both on
misunderstandings and misstatement of the facts and the law.'' They
say KKR gave Drexel discretion to sell warrants and that money
managers have denied the alleged kickback arrangement.

<HEAD>Wickes Cos.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The government claims Milken asked Boesky to buy a large block
of shares of Wickes, a California building products business, to
push up its stock price and make it qualify for a special and
costly dividend.
   Wickes hired Drexel in 1985 to raise money via a series of
securities offerings, including two promising a high fixed dividend
of $2.50 per share. The company did not have to redeem the shares
for three years unless its stock closed above $6.12{ for 20 out of
30 consecutive trading days.
   The government alleges Milken pushed his traders to find buyers
of Wickes stock to drive up the price. When the stock reached the
level on 19 of 28 days in spring 1986, Milken allegedly had Boesky
buy 1.9 million shares late in a trading day, pushing it above the
required level. That helped Wickes avoid having to pay the
expensive dividend for the full three years.

<HEAD>Energy Department Selects Successful Bidders in Reserve Test</HEAD>

   The government said Wendesday it got no takers
for almost a fifth of the nearly 5 million barrels of crude oil
offered from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
   The Energy Department said it has selected 11 companies for the
purchase of a little less than 4 million barrels of oil from the
reserve under the test drawdown order givn by President Bush last
month.
   The department said the amount was short of what had been
expected to be sold because there were no bids for more than
800,000 barrels of high-sulfur ``sour'' crude that were offered.
The sour crude was one of six types of oil offered from the reserve
stocks in salt domes along the Texas and Louisiana coasts.
   Buyers will take 1.35 million barrels of other kinds of sour
crude.
   Some refineries cannot process high-sulfur crude because it
corrodes their equipment.
   The lack of interest in the sour crude was attributed to an
expected increase in the amount of similar oil from Alaska's North
Slope at Gulf Coast ports next month.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins said as much as 100,000 barrels a
day of sour crude is expected to arrive at Gulf Coast refineries in
November when most deliveries will occur from the government
reserve.
   ``It is quite likely that this has reduced the demand for the
type of sour crude we offered,'' said Watkins.
   That rejected sour crude would have come from Weeks Island, La.
Sour crudes that were accepted will come from other storage sites.
   Amoco Oil Co., will receive the most oil, 1.12 million barrels,
from the drawdown.
   Other selected bidders are BP Oil Supply Co., Citgo Petroleum,
Fina Oil and Chemical Co., Mobil Oil Corp., Marathon Petroleum Co.,
Phibro Energy, Shell Oil Co., Sun Refining and Marketing,
Transworld Oil USA, and Ultramar Inc.
   The department said there was adequate demand for the other
types of oil that were offered as 33 companies submitted bids for
10.4 million barrels.
   Successful bids ranged from $32.64 to $39.06 per barrel. The
department will be able to adjust those prices somewhat to reflect
changes in the oil market before delivery.
