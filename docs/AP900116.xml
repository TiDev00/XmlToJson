<HEAD>Two Sailors Held Up By Seven Youngsters</HEAD>

   Authorities searched Tuesday for seven
children _ one possibly as young as 6 _ who surrounded two sailors
in a parking lot and held them up with a Western-style pistol,
police said.
   The sailors were too startled late Sunday by the big handgun
clutched with both hands by one of the children, who appeared to be
the oldest at 13 or 14, to provide police with a detailed
description of the group.
   The youngest of the children appeared to be 6 or 7.
   ``They couldn't give good descriptions because they were looking
at a large Western-style gun _ you know, like cowboys and Indians _
the old, long-barreled pistol,'' said Orlando police Lt. Mike
Mankins.
   ``Every indication was that it was real,'' he said of the gun.
   The youngsters ran off after the holdup.
   The sailors, Mark Beazley, 19, and John Russell, 18, were on
their way from a movie theater to the Orlando Naval Training Center
when they were surrounded in the theater parking lot by the
children, who demanded money, police said.
   The youngsters only got a few dollars from the sailors' wallets,
Mankins said.
   One of the boys clubbed Beazley over the head, but he wasn't
seriously hurt, police said.

   Space shuttle Columbia's astronauts
photographed North Africa for a film documenting damage to the
planet Monday as they whirled around the world on their seventh day
in space.
   Clear skies gave the astronauts the chance to shoot pictures of
Lake Chad, the Nile Valley and fires in Kenya for a giant-screen
IMAX film called ``Planet Earth'' on the damage man and nature are
doing to Earth.
   After a full day's work and an eight-hour rest, Mission Control
awoke the crew about 11:15 p.m. to begin their eighth day in space.
   As has become the practice, they were awakened to the strains of
a college fight song in honor of the astronauts' alma maters. For
Tuesday it was the University of Colorado, from which crew member
Marsha Ivins graduated in 1973. The song is based on the tune
``Battle Hymn of the Republic.''
   ``Good morning buffaloes,'' Ms. Ivins responded, referring to
the school's mascot.
   Earlier Monday, the five crew members also worked on several
medical and scientific experiments that have been the focus of
their 10-day flight since the two main objectives _ releasing a
satellite and capturing another _ were completed last week.
Columbia is scheduled to land Friday at 2:59 a.m. PST.
   The astronauts' work day began a little early when their sleep
was interrupted Sunday by a buzzing alarm that indicated a brief
problem with a navigation system. Five unexplained signals from a
sensor on the system tripped the alarm but posed no threat to the
mission, officials said, and the astronauts returned to bed.
   When they woke up as scheduled two hours after the alarm
sounded, Mission Control told them scientists had monitored the
suspect unit, but detected no further problems. Columbia commander
Dan Brandenstein then successfully tested the system and put it
back into operation.
   ``Everything is going well,'' flight director Al Pennington said
Monday morning. ``They've had a very good day. In fact, they're
having a very busy day today.''
   During the day, mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar had difficulty
with one experiment in which she must seal the lower half of her
body inside a container resembling a collapsible vacuum bag.
   In the experiment, an astronaut drinks a saline solution and
spends time in the container, which gently pulls the body's fluids
toward lower body parts. In space, fluids tend to move toward the
upper body. Researchers hope the two techniques will prevent
astronauts from having trouble standing when they return to Earth.
   Dunbar had trouble with the device's waist seal, which
apparently doesn't work quite the same in weightlessness as it does
on Earth, and needed some assistance from Ms. Ivins and mission
specialist David Low.
   Mission Control awoke the astronauts with the University of
Washington fight song. Dunbar is a Washington graduate.
   ``Good morning for your second wakeup of the morning,'' the
control center said, referring to the earlier alarm.
   Ground controllers also apologized to the crew for having to
work on a holiday.
   ``Sorry you have to work through the Martin Luther King Jr.
holiday, but you're doing so well that no one wants to give you a
break,'' Mission Control said in morning messages sent to the crew
via the shuttle's fax machine.
   Columbia pilot Jim Wetherbee received a special message: a
certificate from Sunday's Houston Tenneco Marathon. Wetherbee ran
on a treadmill at about the same time his mother, Althea,
participated in the 26.2-mile marathon. Mrs. Wetherbee had asked
him to be her pace partner in space.
   Wetherbee's certificate said he ``ran'' the marathon in 5.4
seconds, the time it took him to travel 26.2 miles in orbit. His
70-year-old mother, the oldest female to participate, finished in
four hours, 59 minutes and seven seconds.
   ``You were awarded an honorary completion certificate for the
marathon. Many of us were surprised you weren't disqualified for
leaving the course,'' Mission Control's message said.

<TEXT>
   The Defense Department has delayed announcing
a White House-approved plan to involve U.S. military forces more
deeply in the international war on drugs, a spokesman said Tuesday.
   ``Some of the aspects of that have been put off for a while
following discussions with (Colombian) President Barco,'' Pentagon
spokesman Pete Williams told reporters as he announced that the
department will not hold a news conference this week on the drug
plan as planned.
   Williams said he expected an announcement on the drug plan after
the department releases its budget for fiscal 1991 on Jan. 29. He
said he was unsure whether it would be announced before President
Bush goes to Colombia in February for an anti-drug summit of the
leaders of Andean nations.
   Under the reported anti-drug effort, the Navy was to operate an
aircraft carrier battle group off the Caribbean coast of Colombia
on a rotating basis.
   Pentagon officials have said the Navy would use high-tech radar
and surveillance equipment to keep tabs on suspected drug dealers'
boats and planes.
   Peru, Colombia and Bolivia have said they oppose the use of U.S.
military to police international waters.
   Defense Department sources said a week ago that the aircraft
carrier John F. Kennedy would lead the interdiction effort. The
carrier returned to Florida's Mayport Naval Station on Tuesday.

   Dinh Hong Qui is finding it no
easy task to begin life anew in impoverished northern Vietnam after
voluntarily returning home from the squalid camps of Hong Kong.
   ``At present I am doing nothing. I haven't any job and I have to
rely on my parents,'' the 28-year-old man said in a recent
interview in coastal Quang Ninh province. ``For the time being it
is very difficult.''
   Qui and his wife are among nearly 1,000 people who have
voluntarily returned from the British colony after finding their
dreams for a new life abroad dashed by the Hong Kong policy of
considering Vietnamese asylum-seekers who arrive by boat illegal
immigrants.
   About 44,000 boat people who have sailed into Hong Kong since
June 1988 face repatriation against their will unless they can
prove they fled political persecution or return voluntarily under a
program sponsored by the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees.
   Charles-Henry Bazoche, head of the U.N. agency's mission in
Hanoi, acknowledged the economic difficulties faced by the
returnees but believes that market-oriented economic reforms under
way in communist Vietnam will lead to rapid improvement.
   ``They have made a reasoned, mature decision,'' Bazoche said of
the voluntary returnees. ``They know that Hong Kong is a dead end.
   ``The (economic) situation in Vietnam is evolving very fast. I
do believe the next four years will see many more changes,'' he
said. ``I am deeply convinced that life in Vietnam is better than
in a camp anywhere.''
   Bazoche noted the number of boat people seeking voluntary
repatriation from Hong Kong has been on the rise, with about 2,000
applications pending.
   More than 230 of the boat people who have voluntarily returned
are from Quang Ninh, a northern province of hauntingly beautiful
coastline where sampans sail between islands of dramatic rock
formations.
   Qui and his wife last spring left behind jobs as a factory
welder and tourist official with a total monthly salary of about
$16 and sold their house to help pay for seats on a boat to Hong
Kong, which cost $500 in gold.
   Soon after they arrived in the British colony, however, they
became fed up with the strange food and cramped conditions in the
detention centers and decided to apply for repatriation.
   The couple boarded a chartered flight to Vietnam on Nov. 30 and
have been living at the austere brick home of Qui's parents, which
is simply decorated with ornamental chili plants flanking the
doorway and a poster of Miss Hanoi inside.
   Qui, whose wife is six months pregnant, hopes he can borrow
enough money from friends to start his own mechanical repair
business. ``If I'm lucky in doing my business, life will be much
better, but if I'm not lucky, maybe not,'' he said.
   Cao Van Lam, a voluntary returnee who lives with his parents
down the road from Qui, wants to start his own carpentry business
but also lacks capital.
   Lam, 25, said he has had difficulty finding work ever since
leaving the army last year. ``I just want to have a normal life to
do business,'' he said. ``I think my hope will be fulfilled.''
   The U.N. agency provides $50 in cash to each returning adult to
help with initial resettlement costs, but the money often is
squandered.
   Lam, for example, said he spent the money on cigarettes, while
Qui spent part of his grant on beer and wine for a farewell party
in Hong Kong.
   The United Nations also provides Vietnamese who return
voluntarily with a monthly allowance of $30 for one year, but
Bazoche said what is really needed are development programs in the
northern provinces, where most of the boat people set sail.
   While U.N. officials believe the voluntary return program can
play a big role in reducing the number of Vietnamese languishing in
Hong Kong camps, another massive influx of boat people this year
would trigger demands in the colony for quicker action.
   Officials in Quang Ninh and the nearby port city of Haiphong say
they have launched a media campaign to dissuade Vietnamese from
sailing to Hong Kong, about 500 miles to the northeast.
   Newspapers and radio have stories quoting returning Vietnamese
describing ``how hard and painful life is in the Hong Kong camps,''
said Tran Xuan Nguyen, a provincial official in Quang Ninh.
   The province also has cracked down on people organizing the boat
journeys to Hong Kong, with more than 135 defendants accused of
such crimes last year, he said.
   Haiphong officials believe that since August, nobody has left
for Hong Kong from the port, a popular staging ground for boat
people. They express optimism that the number of departures in the
spring sailing season will fall below the massive waves of the past
two years.
   ``I think that the number of people that are going to leave
Vietnam will be limited to the minimum,'' said Hoang Ngoc Tri, a
Haiphong government official who deals with the returning boat
people.
   ``It's very difficult to predict the actual figure, but we want
to stop it immediately, absolutely,'' he said. ``All we can do is
try our best.''

<HEAD>Hilda The Hippo Dies After Brief Taste of Freedom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THRUXTON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hilda the hippo, en route to a reunion
with her mate Harvey, escaped from her truck on a busy highway but
her brief taste of freedom ended in death.
   The truck Hilda was traveling in jackknifed on a busy highway at
Thruxton in Hampshire, 65 miles west of London, and the three-ton
hippopotamus escaped.
   She ambled along the highway nibbling at the grass and even
managed a quick nap as passing motorists blinked in disbelief.
   Several swerved to miss hitting her.
   But experts said the stress of the accident _ and the trauma of
being hauled into another trailer after being knocked out with a
sedative _ proved too much for the 10-year-old hippo, who died
shortly after her recapture.
   Local veterinarian Geraint Griffiths said the problem was that
it was impossible to get Hilda into the new trailer quickly and
give her an early antidote to the sedative because of her sheer
weight.
   Hilda was being transferred from Longleat Safari Park in
Wiltshire to Windsor Safari Park, where she was to join Harvey.
   ``I think she jumped up and tried to turn round and that turned
the trailer over,'' said her driver, Mike Vandy.
   Griffiths was called in to sedate Hilda with a tranquilizing
dart so she could be caught and put in a replacement truck.
   But it took an hour of heaving and pushing to lift Hilda into
the truck and the difficult operation was only completed after a
vehicle normally used for lifting heavy commercial vehicles was
called in to help.
   A Hampshire police spokesman, speaking anonymously, said: ``She
was extremely well-behaved and docile. It's a great shame to hear
that she has died.''

   Bulgaria's former Communist ruler could
soon face criminal charges. His East German counterpart, elderly
and ill, is under investigation for corruption and high treason,
and the former Czech party chief is in limbo, with charges against
him still possible.
   Such is the fate of East Europe's leaders, whose Stalinist
systems held 111 million people in the Kremlin's satellite
countries in an iron grip for more than 40 years before being swept
out by pro-democracy movements.
   Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu met a violent end. He was executed
Dec. 25, in part for ordering his security troops to fire on
civilians who eventually overthrew his government.
   Only Poland's Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski has managed to keep a
government post.
   The most dramatic changes came in East Germany, Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia and Romania in revolutions over a 10-week period
from October through December.
   Erich Honecker, the longtime Communist leader of East Germany,
was the first to go, ousted by his own Politburo on Oct. 18 as
massive street demonstrations swept the country and thousands of
citizens emigrated to the West.
   Prosecutors have been investigating Honecker for corruption and
abuse of power. The nation's top prosecutor, Hans-Juergen Joseph,
said Monday the investigation had been expanded to include high
treason and ``anti-constitutional associations.''
   Honecker, 77, underwent what was said to be successful surgery
Jan. 10 to remove a malignant kidney tumor.
   He had been placed under house arrest when the investigations
first started. But sources said a security cordon around Honecker's
opulent residential compound near East Berlin was removed several
weeks ago because ``no legal grounds were established'' to detain
him.
   At least 30 former top officials are under investigation in East
Germany and most are under arrest. They include ousted trade union
boss Harry Tisch and Guenther Mittag, who oversaw the centrally
planned economy.
   Bulgaria's Todor Zhivkov was dumped by party comrades Nov. 10
after 34 years in power for resisting reforms championed by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He, too, could face prosecution.
   He has been accused of ruining the economy and leading Bulgaria
into international isolation, largely because of his brutal
suppression of the country's 1.5 million ethnic Turks.
   ``We think (the charges) will be abuse of power, fraud ...
crimes against the consititution _ depriving the whole people of
their rights,'' said Petar Beron, a member of a parliamentary
investigatory commission.
   The panel also is looking into the Zhivkov's alleged diversion
of Bulgarian government funds into Swiss bank accounts and misuse
of state money to build more than 30 villas around the country.
   Zhivkov is being ``protected from the wrath of the people'' at
his Boyana residence near Sofia, Beron said. His trial date will be
set after the investigation is completed, probably in late January.
   Only one top Communist functionary is known to be under arrest
in Czechoslovakia.
   Miroslav Stepan, the former Prague party boss, was charged with
abuse of power, allegedly for ordering the bloody crackdown on
demonstrating students Nov. 17 that triggered the nation's peaceful
revolution.
   National Communist Party chief Milos Jakes was ousted on Nov. 24
and his fate is still unclear. A parliamentary commission
investigated the crackdown and apparently found that Jakes was not
involved.
   However, a separate Communist Party commission investigating
abuse of political power ordered Jakes, Stepan and Vasil Bilak, the
party's hard-line ideologist, to resign from the party.
   Gustav Husak, who came to power after the ``Prague Spring''
reform movement was crushed by the Soviet-led invasion in 1968,
resigned as head of state Dec. 10.
   Husak and 30 other senior officials were suspended from the
party by a party congress earlier this month, pending results of
the party investigation.
   Ceausescu was toppled in a bloody revolution that began on Dec.
15.
   At least half a dozen members of the Ceausescu clan, including
son Nicu and daughter Zoia-Elena, are under arrest and awaiting
trial.
   State television reported Monday that another son, Valentin, and
ousted officials including former Communist Party secretary Emil
Bobu will go on trial this week on charges of bringing economic
ruin on Romania and aiding genocide in the killing of thousands by
during the December uprising.
   In Hungary, where reforms came earlier, Janos Kadar was removed
as party leader in 1988. He died in July.
   Kadar's reformist successor, Karoly Grosz, was overtaken by the
pace of change and relieved last year by a new group of reformers.
They dissolved the Communist Party in October and established a new
Western-oriented Socialist Party.
   In November, Hungarians voted overwhelmingly in a referendum for
the party to make all its assets public.
   The East bloc leader who seems to have best survived the
revolutionary turbulence in Eastern Europe is Poland's Jaruzelski,
the armed forces chief.
   The Polish National Assembly elected him president July 19 and
he has worked closely since then with the Solidarity-led government.
   It was Jaruzelski who decreed martial law in December 1981 to
crush the independent labor union. And it was Jaruzelski who
accepted the power-sharing arrangement last summer when it became
obvious that Poland could not be governed without Solidarity's
participation.

<HEAD>A Year Later, Francke Death Still Mystifying</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It's been a year since the charismatic
director of Oregon's prison system was stabbed to death outside his
office. Authorities discount his family's claim that he was killed
by corrupt elements within the prison system but concede they have
no suspects.
   The slaying of Michael Francke, one of state government's rising
stars, last Jan. 17 distressed this capital city. The fact that a
massive investigation has yielded no suspects has kept interest in
the case high.
   It was about 12:30 a.m. and night watchman Stephen Rubino was
told to be especially observant as he made his rounds of the Dome
Building.
   As he came to a dimly lit porch at the side of the building,
Rubino spotted a large man sprawled on the porch. He was surrounded
by bloodstains, and a panel of glass at the porch doorway was
smashed.
   The night watchman had discovered Francke's body. An autopsy
would later show that Francke died from a stab wound to the heart.
   Today, the killing haunts those familiar with the case.
   ``It's been frustrating,'' says Marion County District Attorney
Dale Penn, who has orchestrated one of most extensive criminal
investigations in the state's history.
   Despite interviews with thousands of people, including several
convicts, and a reward fund exceeding $20,000, the 20 or so
full-time investigators assigned to the case haven't reported any
big breaks.
   Penn said he's convinced the killer is a dark-haired man with a
light-colored coat who was seen running from the scene. But that
man's identity is unknown, he said.
   ``I'm not willing to predict when or if an arrest will be
made,'' Penn said in an interview.
   Francke, 42, was recruited from New Mexico, where he was
director of prisons, in May 1987. He was known for his dynamic
speaking style and his trademark cowboy boots.
   He apparently was attacked at about 7 p.m. as he was leaving
work for the day and walking to his car parked outside the Dome
Building, headquarters of the Corrections Department.
   Despite his mortal wound, Francke managed to make it back to the
building where he broke a panel of glass in a doorway before
collapsing on the porch.
   Co-workers found Francke's car, with a door ajar, in the parking
lot. But his body wasn't found until five hours later when Rubino
made his rounds under orders to be especially alert because Francke
couldn't be contacted.
   Though no arrests have been made, the story has stayed in the
news over the past year, due in large part to the efforts of
Francke's family.
   They've publicly prodded investigators to pursue the possibility
that Francke was killed to prevent him from exposing high-level
corruption in the state Corrections Department.
   Penn and state officials say no one has produced any firm
evidence to back that claim. A recent investigation by a retired
judge appointed by Gov. Neil Goldschmidt to look into the
possibility turned up no link between Francke's death and alleged
corruption in the department.
   In a report issued last month, retired Court of Appeals Judge
John Warden did find evidence of wrongdoing by about 15 corrections
employees, most of them guards, but said there was no link between
it and Francke's death.
   But Francke's younger brother, Kevin Francke, said the family
doesn't buy the revenge or robbery motives advanced by Penn and
others connected with the investigation.
   Kevin Francke said he finds it especially unlikely that his
brother, who went to college on a football scholarship, was killed
when he interrupted someone trying to break into his car.
   He pointed out Francke's money, wallet and Rolex watch weren't
taken and that there was no sign of forced entry into the car.
   ``He wasn't stupid enough to confront an individual with an
8-inch knife,'' Kevin Francke said by telephone from Port
Charlotte, Fla.
   More likely, he said, Francke was silenced before he had a
chance to lower the boom on corrections officials, guards and
inmates who were involved in an alleged drug ring in the prisons.
He said Michael Francke had told him he'd uncovered an organized
criminal element in the department.
   ``Drugs and drug money. I think that's the main thing,'' Kevin
Francke said. ``I believe it involved corrections officials,
corrections employees and inmates.''
   For his part, Penn said his office has given lie detector tests
to top corrections officials, and found nothing to substantiate
Kevin Francke's allegations.
   ``I do not believe that corruption within the Corrections
Department is a viable motive in this case,'' the district attorney
said.
   ``It is unreasonable to believe that a whole group (of
corrections officials) could pass polygraph exams and continue to
conceal a conspiracy,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The government of this city-state, long a
trading center for wildlife and wildlife products, today announced
that it will ban the import and export of ivory starting Thursday.
   In October, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species adopted a ban on world ivory trading to save Africa's
dwindling elephant population, which has dropped from 1.5 million
in the 1970s to an estimated 600,000 now _ victims of poachers
after their tusks.
   The ban gives ivory traders until Thursday to sell their stocks.
   Singapore's ban does not apply to stocks of ivory already
registered with the government, the announcement said. It did not
disclose how much registered ivory was on hand.
   Imports of unregistered ivory have been prohibited in Singapore
since November 1986, when Singapore became a party to the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.
   In line with other moves by the convention, the Ministry of
National Development also announced a ban on the import and export
of the Moluccan Cockatoo, Illiser's Macaw and the Tucuman Amazon
Parrot, except for those already in stock, as endangered.
   Also beginning Thursday, import and export permits will be
required for the Banded Rattlesnake, Indian Cobra and Rhinoceros
Hornbill.

   Business leaders say their young
democracy will be threatened unless Panama receives financial aid
to compensate for the looting, unemployment and destruction caused
by the U.S. invasion.
   ``If the United States truly expects democracy to flourish, you
need a flourishing economy,'' said Laurence Berger, vice president
of the American Chamber of Commerce in Panama. ``All the goodwill
in the world won't mean much when you have growling stomachs.''
   Business leaders say the Bush administration has not yet offered
any aid to make up for the millions lost due to U.S. economic
sanctions imposed to try to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and
the widespread looting after the invasion.
   ``We've been told, `We gave you your freedom and now it's up to
you to do what you will,''' said Alfredo L. Maduro, president of
the Panamanian Chamber of Commerce.
   The looting started after U.S. troops invaded Dec. 20 to oust
Noriega, and lasted for four days. Hundreds of stores were left
without any merchandise, including food, clothes, cars, furniture
and electronic goods.
   The looting is estimated to have cost companies between $1
billion and $2 billion and left some 30,000 people without work,
bringing the unemployment rate to about 30 percent in the country
of 2.2 million people.
   ``The word democracy is going to ring hollow unless the country
gets help and social unrest is something this new government
doesn't need,'' said Berger, whose organization is made up mostly
of U.S. business executives.
   Nearly a month after the American attack, most businesses in the
capital of Panama City remain closed and many people fear this will
spell dire economic straits for the small nation, already reeling
from two years of U.S. sanctions imposed in 1988 to put pressure on
the Noriega military regime.
   Last week, President Guillermo Endara wrote President Bush
asking for financial aid. The contents of the letter were not
released.
   A U.S. Embassy official who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Endara thanked Bush for the military intervention and ``listed six
areas of priority Panama needs help in to rebuild the economy.''
   One area Endara said needs rebuilding is the poor neighborhood
of El Chorrillo, which was mostly destroyed in the fighting.
Noriega's headquarters, a target of the invasion, was located in
the district.
   Engineers have estimated rebuilding the area to minimum
standards will cost $40 million to $60 million.
   The Bush administration has not indicated any aid will be
coming, although the U.S. military has said it will rebuild houses
and apartments detroyed in the fighting.
   ``It's a problem that needs attention,'' said Ambassador Deane
Hinton. ``I am personally convinced that we will make a significant
contribution.''
   But, he added, the looting was ``first and foremost a problem of
Panama.''
   Hinton was in Washington on Monday and was to bring up the issue
with administration officials.
   Although the United States has released $70 million in assets
frozen as part of the sanctions, $250 million remains unreleased.
   Business leaders say sanctions coupled with political unrest
have depressed the construction, banking, industrial and tourism
sectors and caused skilled Panamanians to leave the country and
seek work elsewhere.
   The chambers of commerce say the standard of living has dropped
to what it was 10 years ago, mostly because of the sanctions. They
also claim the invasion jeopardized the commercial and insurance
sectors.
   The chambers estimate about $300 to $500 million in aid would be
sufficient to stave off further economic woes, and say the United
States should help Panama as it did the Dominican Republic after
U.S. troops moved in in 1965.
   ``We are a country of 2.2 million people so a relatively small
of amount of help will go a long way,'' said Berger.
   Government officials say the plundering occurred only because
there was an absence of security forces, Panamanian or American, on
the streets. The police, part of Noriega's Panamanian Defense
Forces, were involved in the fighting.
   ``There was anarchy in the streets, martial law should have been
declared,'' said Berger. He said the troops should have helped
prevent looting by barricades and patrols.
   A key issue of the debate is that many insurance companies do
not cover ``acts of war.''
   Maduro and Berger say both the Panamanian and U.S. governments
should come out with a statement clarifying whether the invasion
was indeed war.
   ``Neither government wants to take a position on whether this
was a war or not,'' said Maduro. ``It may be semantics but it has
legal implications. A formula has got to be worked out. Or we have
to work through a back door.''
   They are also asking for:
   _ Pressure by the U.S. government to persuade insurance
companies to recognize legitimate claims.
   _ Low interest loans in construction and commercial financing.
   _ Export guarantees to U.S. suppliers that would allow more
expanded credit.

<TEXT>
   Members of Massachusetts' Armenian community
stayed in touch with friends and relatives in Azerbaijan on Monday
and urged Moscow to prevent the bloody ethnic conflict from
escalating into civil war.
   ``There are thousands of Armenians who live in Azerbaijan and
their lives are very insecure at this point,'' said the Rev. Dajad
Davidian of St. James Armenian Church in suburban Watertown. ``What
we want to see is some kind of public security take place.''
   Dikran Kaligian, executive director of the Armenian National
Committee of the Eastern United States, said the Boston area's
50,000-member Armenian community is the second largest in the
nation outside of Los Angeles.
   In New York City, Armenian-Americans demonstrated Monday outside
the Soviet Mission, appealing for an end to the bloodshed.
   ``It's one of the saddest moments in contemporary history,''
said Archbishop Megrob Ashjian, prelate of the Armenian Church of
America and a protest leader. ``In the eyes of the civilized world,
genocide is perpetrated.''
   About 100 protesters waved American and Armenian flags, chanted
``Gorbachev, stop the killing!'' in reference to the Soviet leader,
and sang a nationalistic anthem that translated as: ``The enemy
wants to kill us but we are here to stay.''
   Ashjian said there are about 1 million Armenian-Americans,
150,000 of them in the New York City area.
   In Los Angeles, Garen Yegparian, executive director of the
western office of the Armenian National Committee, blamed the
Azerbaijanis, most of whom are Shiite Moslems, for the clashes with
the Armenians, who mostly are Christians.
   ``What they've started is not unexpected for us,'' said
Yegparian. ``It's in line with their previous behavior.''
   Kaligian's Watertown-based organization has been in constant
contact with Soviet Armenians. ``In Azerbaijan everyone is involved
because it's a matter of life and death,'' he said.
   The violence broke out this weekend between predominantly Moslem
Azerbaijanis and mostly Christian Armenians, who are battling over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a mainly Armenian region of 160,000 people
controlled by Azerbaijan since 1923.
   Official reports Monday said hundreds of Azerbaijanis and
Armenians fought with submachine guns, helicopters and armored
vehicles taken from military bases, and that at least 37 had been
killed.
   Kaligian said the death toll was probably a great deal higher.
   ``Those are obviously the initial figures,'' he said. ``The
actual numbers are difficult to get because foreign newsmen are
barred from the region.''
   Manoog S. Young, chairman of the board of The National
Association for Armenian Studies and Research in suburban Belmont,
predicted the hostilities could be quelled before a full-scale
civil war broke out.
   ``I don't think it's a classic civil war situation,'' he said.
``I think before it will be allowed to get to that point I'm sure
the Soviet troops will intervene and put a lid on it.''
   ``Somehow Moscow has got to exert more influence. They have to
bring a stop to the bloodshed that's going on,'' he said. ``It's
come to the point that unless they get some control, this will blow
completely out of proportion.''
   Kaligian said the reasons behind the fighting were not simple.
   ``This situation is often being portrayed as a religious
struggle or an age-old struggle,'' Kaligian said. ``This is a
political issue, and an issue of survival.''
   Davidian said the Armenian community believes the Azerbaijanis
have more troops and more arms than the Armenians, making the
battle difficult to win.
   ``One of our big fears right now, in the past week _ is now that
they've torn down the barriers _ we have a real fear that heavy
military equipment is being taken into Azerbaijan.''
   Davidian said the civil strife in Azerbaijan has taken a toll on
the victims of Armenia's devastating December 1988 earthquake.
   ``Most of the supplies that come in from land come in through
Azerbaijan. These supplies are effectively being blockaded,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Couple's House Divided by Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple found themselves stuck with just
half a house after a legal dispute divided their two-section
modular home.
   ``It's really something,'' would-be homeowner Michael Cady said
Monday. ``Our living room is there and two bedrooms. Over at (the
supply company) they have the kitchen, the bathrooms and the other
living room.''
   The problem began Jan. 5 when Penn-Lyon Homes of Selinsgrove,
Pa., delivered the modular house in two sections. One section was
put on the foundation at the Cadys' lot. Then, a deputy sheriff
showed up with a court order. The section still on the truck was
seized and taken to L.P. Adams, the building material company.
   Adams claims it is owed $14,000 by the Cady's contractor,
Pegasus Construction Services, which distributes Penn-Lyon homes.
   But the Cadys' attorney, Mitchell Boraski, said the house
belonged to the couple because they had given a $36,000 check to
the Penn-Lyon driver.
   On Monday, Thomas J. Hamel, an attorney for L.P. Adams, said the
company never intended for the Cadys to become caught in the
dispute. He said an agreement has been reached that will allow the
Cadys to move into their western Massachusetts home this week.
   ``Instead of having the Cadys out in the cold with only half a
house I've agreed to suspend my levy if Penn-Lyon will escrow the
funds they've received,'' Hamel said.
   Andrew Hochberg, attorney for Pegasus owner Vincent Carchedi,
said his client had tried to work out terms to pay the L.P. Adams
debt to no avail.
   ``He's a building contractor. He's trying to make a living in a
soft market,'' Hochberg said.
   Cady said he and his wife, Laurie, have been saving for seven
years to buy the home, and they had videotaped the arrival of the
first section.
   Mrs. Cady said she had returned to work when her sister, who was
working the video camera called her to say the house was being
seized.
   ``It was just horrendous,'' Mrs. Cady said.
   Cady, who recently was certified as a teacher, said his wife and
their two daughters are eager to move into the $74,000 house.
   ``The only thing we've paid for right now is the foundation and
obviously they can't take that,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dole Says Cut Aid to Israel, Give More to Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Bob Dole says the United States should
cut foreign aid to Israel, Egypt, the Philippines, Turkey and
Pakistan by 5 percent and give the money to new democracies in
Poland, Hungary, Panama and other countries.
   Dole, a Kansas Republican who is the Senate minority leader,
made the suggestion in an opinion piece published in Tuesday's
editions of The New York Times.
   The five countries he named as targets for reductions receive
more than two-thirds of U.S. foreign assistance.
   ``Does it make sense, at this historic moment, to provide these
countries practically all of our aid at the cost of foreclosing
dramatically promising new aid initiatives in Eastern Europe or
other important countries?'' Dole wrote. ``What about, for example,
those Latin American nations in the front lines in the war against
drugs?''
   A 5 percent cut in aid to Israel, Egypt, the Philippines, Turkey
and Pakistan would free about $330 million, Dole said.
   The United States plans to spend $14.5 billion on foreign aid
this year. Of that, Israel is allocated $3 billion and Egypt is to
receive $2 billion.

<HEAD>US Donates 75 Percent of Contraceptives to Third World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government gives three-quarters of
the contraceptives donated to Third World countries, including
nearly 7 billion condoms over the last two decades, according to
the Agency for International Development.
   Since 1968, the agency ``has purchased $567.7 million worth of
contraceptives for distribution to 75 countries _ 6.9 billion
condoms, 1.6 billion cycles of oral contraceptives, 49.7 million
intrauterine devices and 16.5 million vaginal foaming tablets,''
the agency reported.
   Duff Gillespie, the agency's director for population, said
overseas orders for condoms rose from 535 million in the 1988
fiscal year to 735 million in the year ending on Sept. 30. He said
the increase was due in part to the fight against AIDS, but also to
the growth of the agency's population activities.
   Details of the population program appeared in the fall 1989
edition of ``USAID Highlights,'' an agency publication distributed
to reporters last week.
   Gillespie said the agency has overcome some of the hostility to
family planning of many Third World leaders, who have suspected a
hidden western policy of countries to keep down their influence by
reducing their population.
   ``These countries have had growth that's historically
unprecedented,'' he said in an interview.
   He said in Africa the population is expected to double in 24
years at the present rate of increase and leaders are trying to
cope with increasing demand for schools, housing and social
services.
   ``In places like Kenya the government is enthusiastic for family
planning,'' said spokesman Jerry Lipscomb.
   Kenya, in east Africa, has one of the world's highest birth
rates. The Central Intelligence Agency estimates its population of
more than 23 million people is growing by 4.4 percent a year _
eight times as fast as the population of Japan, for example.
   The agency cited one program in Kenya that serves an area of
350,000 people. It said 43 percent of the married women there now
practice birth control, compared with only 17 percent in the
country as a whole, and women there average 5.2 children compared
with 7.7.
   The publication noted the U.S. government does not support
abortion or what it called coercive family planning.
   President Reagan's anti-abortion policy led to a tense
controversy with Congress over the United Nations Fund for
Population Activities. Because the fund helped China, where
abortion was reportedly forced on some women, U.S. contributions
were opposed by Reagan and many of his supporters. Last November
President Bush refused to sign a bill on foreign aid until Congress
cut out a provision of $15 million for the fund.
   Since 1981, the agency has spent $2.9 billion on population
control activities, ranging from research to financing popular
songs about the dangers of pregnancy.
   The agency publication said in 20 countries where it spent the
most money, the average number of children per family has dropped
from 6.1 in the 1960s to 4.5 in the late 1980s.

   Throughout much of Eastern Europe, there is a
sense of exhilaration as the new decade dawns with the demise of
authoritarian rule giving hope for a freer, more prosperous future.
   Latin America was imbued with somewhat the same spirit 10 years
ago when, one by one, discredited military dictatorships were
surrendering power to elected civilians.
   The democratic transformation of that region is now almost
complete but, in one sense, Latin America's evolution has brought
more pain than progress over the past decade; the average citizen
is poorer now than in 1980.
   East Europeans may face a similar plight. Poles got a taste on
New Year's Day of how difficult the transition is from communism to
a free market system. The prices of gasoline and bus fares were
doubled on Jan. 1 while the cost of heating oil and electricity
rose four-fold. It will be a while before Poles live like Parisians.
   The experience in Latin America must make some nostalgic for the
era of corrupt dictators. The 1980s are known in the region as the
``lost decade,'' a time when up to half of its export earnings were
consumed by foreign debt repayment, when the average annual
inflation reached 470 percent and when all the main indicators of
economic performance _ production, investment and consumption _
were below the levels of 10 years ago.
   There were riots last year in two of the better-off countries,
Argentina and Venezuela. Ironically, the country with the best
economic performance was Chile, where the generals are, for the
time being, still in charge.
   ``The decade of democracy has also been a decade of
disillusion,'' writes Douglas Payne of Freedom House, a
pro-democracy research group in New York.
   He blames powerful traditions of monopoly, regulation and
protectionism inherited from the colonial era and the ``huge,
money-guzzling state corporations and corrupt, no-work
bureaucracies'' that were created during the 1960s and 70s.
   Indeed, Cuban President Fidel Castro thinks his country is doing
quite well next to the Latin American democracies the United States
has assiduously promoted over the past decade. Many of his
countrymen, of course, disagree.
   Castro has said Cuba is the only country in Latin America which
has not closed factories, schools or hospitals.
   ``We're the only country which is developing modestly but
strategically,'' Castro said in an appearance before the National
Assembly. That body approved a resolution pledging ``the island
will first sink into the sea before we agree to pull down the
banners of the revolution and socialism.''
   The resolution was approved on Dec. 27, just a few days after
the people of Romania ousted a system much like Cuba's in one of
the most remarkable mass uprisings in modern history.
   It was a regime which, except for secret police hirelings,
seemed to have no defenders, and the pattern was much the same last
year elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
   The question now is whether that region will suffer the same
economic fate as the new democracies in Latin America.
   Robert D. Hormats, a former top State Department economic
affairs expert, warns the transition and the new leadership in
Eastern Europe could be jeopardized if living standards do not
quickly improve.
   ``Economic transformation will take years,'' Hormats says. ``In
the near term, cutting subsidies for food and rent, closing
obsolete plants and laying off redundant workers could lower living
standards.''
   He says the West ``would make one of the great mistakes in
history if it refuses to spend the several billions needed to help
countries through this hard period.''
   It is more difficult, Hormats says, ``to create successful
market economies than tear down failing socialist economies. It
will be harder still if Eastern Europeans do not work together, and
if the West fails to help them do so.''

<TEXT>
   AT&amp;T's phone system had major problems
connecting long-distance calls throughout the country Monday due to
trouble in new electronic call-switching centers, the company said.
   Half the calls in the nation on the AT&amp;T system were not going
through after 2:30 p.m. EST, about the time the problem was first
noticed, said Daisy Ottmann, a spokeswoman for American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co.
   The company reported that the problem was fixed by 11:30 p.m.,
but spokeswoman Sally Sherwood said she could not provide any more
details immediately on how the network was returned to normal.
   ``Obviously through a very long, laborious process they were
able to detect the problem and fix it,'' Ms. Sherwood said early
Tuesday.
   For much of the day, callers received recordings saying all
circuits were busy and calls could not be put through, AT&amp;T
spokesmen said. The problem seriously affected telemarketers,
airline reservation centers and other heavy phone users.
   ``In my 20 years, I have not seen a situation that affected as
many cities as this,'' spokesman Burke Stinson said at the
company's Basking Ridge, N.J. offices.
   MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint, the No. 2 and No. 3
long-distance carriers after AT&amp;T, said they had no problems with
their networks.
   The difficulties were traced to software that runs computerized
call-switching gear that AT&amp;T began installing in 1987, Ms.
Sherwood said.
   The problem was found in what is called the call signaling
system, which routes telephone calls. The signaling system is
composed of computerized data that is electronically overlaid on
the data that carries the voice portion of a telephone call, she
said.
   The signaling data includes the phone number of the party making
the call and the number of the intended recipient of the call.
   Ms. Ottmann said it was believed that the trouble began in one
of the approximately 100 switching centers operating, and then
spread to other centers.
   ``It's like striking the church bell in a steeple and all the
other bells resonate _ this is a vibrating or resonating problem,''
she said. ``That seems to be in the software, or at least it's
being transferred in the software.'' ``We've never seen anything
like this before,'' she added. ``It's everywhere and the effects
are random.''
   She said the company is in the process of installing a new
version of the software. It was not known whether this was part of
the problem, she said.
   Ms. Ottmann said the had company all but eliminated sabotage or
a computer virus as the cause. ``That's the only thing we've pretty
thoroughly ruled out.''
   Ms. Sherwood said the company has installed 110 of the new
switching centers, but not all of them are on line. Stinson said
the trouble appeared to be affecting a substantial number of the
operating centers.
   But, he added, said some of the calls that didn't go through
were due to the deliberate blocking of lines by AT&amp;T to enable it
to diagnose the problem.
   ``We have hundreds of people around the country trying to
diagnose and correct this,'' he said.
   Stinson said the problem was affecting all AT&amp;T's lines,
including toll-free 800 numbers, except for private lines that
companies lease between their offices or plants.
   He could not say how a software problem could crop up at so many
switching centers at once.
   A number of heavy users of toll-free lines reported difficulties.
   Cindy Sheffield, phone systems manager for the Marriott hotels
reservation office in Omaha, Neb., said the problem was
``devastating'' for her office because it wasn't receiving calls
from prospective customers. The office was receiving only 10
percent of its normal call volume after the problem began, she said.
   Fidelity Investments, a Boston-based mutual fund operator, said
callers were having trouble getting through. ``It did have quite
extensive impact,'' said spokeswoman Tracy Gordon.
   American Airlines received about two-thirds fewer calls than
normal on its reservation lines after 2:30 p.m. EST, airline
spokeswoman Mary O'Neill said in Fort Worth, Texas.
   Trans Mid-America, a marketing company in Omaha, Neb.,
specializing in temporary motor vehicle license sales, couldn't
make any long-distance or 800-number calls, said company vice
president Florence Waymire.
   ``We're dead in the water here today,'' she said.
   David Haller, branch manager for Omaha's Dial America Marketing,
said that if the phone problem wasn't repaired soon his
magazine-subscription company would lose a minimum of $20,000,
``and that's conservative.''
   United Airlines reported minor problems with its reservation
system. But Susan Brushaber, a Chicago-based reservation agent for
the airline, said United's phone system is designed so that callers
are patched into a local phone number.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Wrangle Over Social Security Trillions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Debate over Social Security is heating up even
before Congress gets back to business, with the trillions of
dollars in baby boomers' future retirement benefits casting a huge
shadow over the political argument.
   Customary political rhetoric has been turned upside down, with a
leading Democrat calling for a payroll tax cut and the White House
responding, ``No way.''
   The outcome may determine whether the massive Social Security
trust fund, bolstered by long-range payroll tax increases enacted
in 1983, will continue to be used to mask the size of the federal
budget deficit. In an era of perennial budget shortfalls, the
Social Security trust fund helps pay the government's day-to-day
operations instead of building up a nest egg.
   Lawmakers are faced with whether to take painful action now _
such as tax increases and spending slashes _ or do nothing until
the next century.
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., added urgency to the
debate with his proposal to immediately cut the Social Security
payroll tax. The White House said Thursday it opposes the idea.
   But in today's anti-tax climate, which President Bush has played
to in calling for a cut in the capital gains tax, Moynihan's plan
``could suddenly sprout wings and fly very high,'' said Senate
Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn.
   The 1983 increase in the payroll tax was enacted partly to help
brace the government for the retirement of the 75 million members
of the baby boom generation, which will begin around the year 2010.
   The latest increase, to 7.65 percent on Jan. 1 from 7.51
percent, will bring in nearly $280 billion this year. The total
reserves should peak at $12 trillion in the year 2030, but dwindle
rapidly thereafter.
   By law, the money is not stashed away, but invested in treasury
securities, where it collects interest. The Treasury Department
uses the money the same way it uses other funds it pockets from
securities sales _ to pay the government's bills.
   The money pouring into the Social Security trust fund also helps
make the overall federal deficit appear smaller _ $52 billion
smaller last year.
   That will turn around in the next century: people who are
working now will be drawing retirement funds and the government
will have to redeem all the maturing securities the Social Security
system will cash in to pay retirement benefits. The shapes up as a
major problem with no end to the government's red ink in sight.
   Moynihan _ who was a member of the 1982 Social Security
commission _ would cut the payroll tax by 0.14 percent now and by
another 0.96 percent next January. He would begin boosting rates
again in the year 2015, giving the country 25 years of lower taxes
he says will help the economy grow and allow it to better afford
the higher levies later.
   His plan would also shrink the Social Security surplus and thus
pump up the overall federal deficit, turning up the political heat
to address the budget shortfall.
   ``It has now become clear that the administration intends to use
the Social Security payroll tax as an ongoing, permanent source of
revenue for the general purposes of government,'' Moynihan,
chairman of the Senate Finance Social Security subcommittee, said
when he announced his plan last month.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater derided the plan last
Thursday. ``The Social Security system is sound. Let the Democrats
fool with it, not us,'' he said.
   Moynihan's cut would cost $62 billion over the next two years,
and critics say it would shift the burden of financing baby
boomers' retirements to later generations.
   ``This smacks a little bit of the Reagan philosophy, which can
be summed up as `Don't visit your grandchildren, just send them the
bill,''' says Rep. Andrew Jacobs, D-Ind., chairman of the House
Ways and Means Social Security subcommittee.
   But the proposal could be irresistible to lawmakers, who love a
chance to cut taxes.
   ``We've been called by offices from both sides of the aisle,''
says lobbyist Judy Schub of the American Association of Retired
Persons, which so far has shied away from Moynihan's plan. ``It's
got a lot of appeal.''
   Moynihan's proposal is one of several Social Security bills
Congress will face when it returns from its winter recess on Jan.
23. Since last January, about 20 bills have been spawned excluding
the Social Security trust fund from deficit calculations.
   Many concede the political appeal of the off-budget proposals is
probably unstoppable. In a measure of the idea's appeal, the White
House says President Bush will include a version of the plan in the
fiscal 1991 budget he presents Congress on Jan. 29.

<HEAD>Army to Test Program to Destroy Chemical Weapons</HEAD>

   The Army plans to start burning about
30,000 tons of chemical weapons in a project _ designed to make the
world safer _ that is arousing concern in some of the eight states
where the destruction will occur.
   ``We feel it is a risky scenario,'' said Linda Kaplovitz, an
environmentalist who lives near the Aberdeen Proving Ground, where
tons of mustard blistering agent are stored and will be burned.
   ``We don't want another Bhopal or Chernobyl, God forbid,'' she
said.
   Such fears are overdrawn, said Col. Walter L. Busbee, commander
of the Army's ``chemical demilitarization'' program. He was
interviewed at his headquarters, a low cinder block building
overlooking the Chesapeake Bay, 25 miles northeast of Baltimore.
   The nine-year, $3.1 billion project has undergone rigorous
scientific scrutiny, he said, adding the burning will not begin
until he is satisfied with a test program due to begin in March on
a remote Pacific island. Congress has ordered the Army to destroy
almost all of its aging chemical arsenal by 1997.
   After the 16-month test, destruction will begin at eight other
sites in Maryland, Kentucky, Alabama, Utah, Indiana, Oregon,
Arkansas and Colorado.
   Under pressure from Congress, the Army scheduled destruction
last at the two most populous sites, Aberdeen and at the
Lexington-Bluegrass Army Depot in Kentucky, Busbee said.
   Environmental concerns are twofold: that a destruction facility
could explode or leak, and that the exhaust cannot be scrubbed
clean.
   Each part of the facility will be sealed against leaks and
reinforced against explosions, Busbee said.
   ``I'm not telling you that there will never be an accident or an
incident,'' he said, but added, ``the probability, we think, is
very low.''
   Mrs. Kaplovitz cited a long list of possible pollutants from the
facility, including dioxins, which researchers blame for ailments
ranging from headaches to birth defects, cancer and toxic poisoning.
   The environmental organization Greenpeace International has
warned that gases given off at the test site, on Johnston Atoll 800
miles southwest of Hawaii, could harm marine life.
   ``We feel that the Army has ignored quite a few major
environmental concerns,'' said Sebia Hawkins, a Greenpeace activist
in Washington.
   The Army's approach was recommended by the National Academy of
Sciences and the plans were reviewed by the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services.
   Harvard University chemist Matthew Meselson said the facilities
are likely to cause less pollution than many urban refuse
incinerators because the chemical reactions are more predictable
and more easily monitored.
   ``There is something that has to be recognized here, and that is
that we are going to do this once. We are not building something
for mankind for its indefinite future. It doesn't have to be the
last word in technology,'' said Meselson, who previously has
challenged the government on other issues.
   Busbee's organization is to begin the test run of its first
full-scale destruction facility on Johnston Atoll in March, burning
chemical agents that were stored on Okinawa until 1971 and others
that are scheduled to be moved from West Germany sometime in the
next two years.
   ``If it operates as it is designed, and I will not operate it
any other way, nothing will come down but a plume'' of nearly pure
exhaust, said Busbee.
   The weapons to be destroyed are decades old and consist of the
nerve agents Sarin and VX, and the mustard blistering agents H, HD
and HT, contained in mines, artillery shells, rockets and storage
tanks.
   Although the Bush administration is negotiating a global
convention to ban chemical arms, it also is producing a new
generation of so-called binary weapons. Chemical components in the
binary weapons are kept separate until use, which Army officials
say makes them safer to store or destroy.
   Destruction at each site will vary according to the chemicals
there. Each will include two incinerators to burn the agent at
2,700 degrees Fahrenheit, said Busbee.
   The first incineration should destroy the poisons instantly, and
the second, the ``afterburner,'' is insurance, he said. The fumes
will be scrubbed and will be monitored for toxic substances, he
said.
   Incineration in the continental United States will not start
``until it has been proven that is a safe way to do it,'' said Rep.
Larry Hopkins, R-Ky.
   The Kentucky legislature passed a law requiring that the
incinerator exhaust be 99.9999 percent pure, which Busbee says is
the Army's target.

   The U.S. Army plans to begin destruction in
March of its stock of aging chemical weapons, which are stored in
eight states, West Germany and a remote island in the South Pacific.
   The program, according to current projections, will last nine
years and cost an estimated $3.1 billion, including management and
research costs.
   Here are the nine sites where chemical agents would be
destroyed, with the percentage of the arsenal at each, the type of
munitions and the estimated cost of each disposal facility, and
dates of construction, operation and completion, according to the
most recent Pentagon data.

of the total arsenal by chemical agent weight, consisting of
munitions moved from Okinawa in 1971 and being moved by sea from
West Germany at a cost of $28.4 million within the next two years.
   The main island, consisting of 630 largely manmade acres, is the
site of Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System, which in
March is scheduled to begin a 16-month trial period and to complete
its work by June 1994.

<HEAD>Running for President Gets Members of Congress on TV, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress get much more attention
from television network news when they run for president than for
their nuts-and-bolts work in Washington, says a new study.
   Democrat Richard Gephardt barely rated a mention on the evening
news for his congressional work on the federal tax code, but a bid
for the presidency in 1988 propelled him into prime time.
   The same was true for Albert Gore Jr., Lloyd Bentsen, Paul Simon
and Dan Quayle, who found that mention on CBS, NBC and ABC was the
result of their political aspirations rather than their jobs in
Congress.
   ``As an everyday member of Congress, they might not ever be
mentioned,'' said Joe S. Foote, a former congressional staffer and
chairman of the radio-television department at Southern Illinois
University in Carbondale.
   In fact, 44 percent of the House members were never mentioned on
the nightly news programs during 1987-88, Foote's study said.
   ``As the 1980s passed by, congressional backbenchers found it
was harder and harder to break into the national spotlight as
defined by ABC, CBS and NBC,'' Foote said.
   The result is that some of the newer and younger members of
Congress have ``fewer and fewer opportunities to influence public
opinion,'' he said. ``We rarely hear their ideas.''
   Foote, who has conducted the annual analysis of lawmakers' TV
visibility for nearly a decade, said the study released this week
shows that Gephardt, who made an unsuccessful bid for the
Democratic presidential nomination in 1988, was mentioned just 25
times on the nightly news in 1985-86 during the 99th Congress.
   During the 100th Congress, shortly after Gephardt announced his
candidacy in February 1987, he totaled 253 mentions that included
use of his name in a report, a film clip or an interview.
   Foote based the study on the Television News Index and Abstracts
at the Vanderbilt University News Archive in Nashville, Tenn.,
which tracked mentions on the evening news programs of the three
networks. Cable News Network was not included.
   For other lawmakers, the jump from obscurity to often-mentioned
was a major leap after they sought the presidency or vice
presidency. Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., a 1988 presidential
candidate, was mentioned 35 times in 1985-86, 104 in 1987-88.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., of Tennessee, another 1988 Democratic
hopeful, rose from 27 mentions in 1985-86 to 209 in 1987-88. Sen.
Paul Simon, D-Ill., rated 15 mentions in 1985-86, but 200 in
1987-88.
   Dan Quayle, the Republican senator from Indiana, received six
mentions in 1985-86, but skyrocketed to 172 in 1987-88, which
included his election as vice president.
   Heading the list of mentions among the lawmakers who sought
higher office was Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., with 276
in 1985-86 and 486 in 1987-88. By virtue of those totals, Dole also
led all 100 senators in TV exposure in 1987-88.
   Gore was second with 209, Simon was third with 200 and Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the 1988 Democratic vice presidential
candidate, was fourth with 199. During 1985-86, Bentsen managed
just 14 mentions on the nightly news.
   Bentsen edged out Quayle, who was fifth among senators with 172
mentions in 1987-88.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, was sixth with 155 mentions and Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., former Senate majority leader, was seventh with 144
mentions in 1987-88.
   At the bottom of the list with no mentions from 1987 to 1988
were Sens. Quentin Burdick, D-N.D.; Wendell Ford, D-Ky.; and Harry
Reid, D-Nev.
   In 1987-88, the study found 10 percent of the members of the
Senate accounted for nearly 50 percent of all network Senate
coverage. Less than 3 percent of the membership in the House made
up about 90 percent of the network House coverage during the same
two-year period.
   Gephardt led the list of House members with 253 mentions; former
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, was second with 196; and Jack
Kemp, the former New York congressman who was thwarted in his bid
for the GOP nomination, was third with 193 mentions.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., a co-chairman of the congressional
Iran-Contra committees, received 89 mentions in 1987-88. Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the Armed Services Committee, was fifth
with 59 mentions.

<HEAD>Thrift Complain New Federal Rule Breaks Government Pledge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buyers of failed savings institutions in 1988
are protesting a new regulation that revokes some of the financial
breaks they received from the government as part of the deal.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision says savings and loans must
meet new and tougher capital requirements, regardless of whether
they earlier received an exemption, known as a ``forbearance,''
from meeting capital standards.
   Institutions that fail the requirement must come up with an
acceptable plan to raise the money or face restrictions on their
ability to make new loans and investments.
   Attorneys representing buyers in the 1988 deals regard the new
rule as a double-cross and predict the legal battle over the issue
will reach the Supreme Court.
   ``If this is upheld, nobody will ever feel secure doing business
with the government,'' Washington attorney and S&amp;L lobbyist Douglas
P. Faucette said Monday.
   Industry analysts predict some of the 86 rescue deals in 1988
covering 205 institutions could unravel as a result of the ruling,
forcing either a second bailout or a payoff of depositors.
   ``Some would basically be targets for'' government takeover,
said James Barth of Auburn University, formerly chief economist of
the thrift office.
   He added the second rescues could be even more expensive than
the first round because of changes in the law making it less
attractive to own thrifts.
   Thrift institution owners, under President Bush's bailout plan
enacted in August, must put up at least $1.50 in tangible capital
for every $100 in loans or other investment the institution makes.
   Owners of some S&amp;Ls acquired from the government in 1988 had
thought the forbearances they negotiated would exempt them from
fully meeting the standard. They now learn they will have to risk
just as much of their own money as the owners of any other
institution.
   The thrift office, in a statement announcing the new rules after
business hours on Friday, said the changes were required by last
year's bailout bill. But attorneys representing the 1988 buyers
dispute that and complain the government, by reneging on the deals,
is in effect illegally seizing private property.
   Faucette predicted the owners of S&amp;Ls purchased in the 1988
deals will sue the government, joining other S&amp;L buyers from the
early 1980s who lost a different kind of accounting break, known as
regulatory goodwill.
   ``To me these cases ... have a profound impact on anyone who
does business with the government,'' he said. ``I fear because of
the dimensions of this (S&amp;L) scandal, Congress and the public
believe the ends justify the means.''
   However, Barth said the regulators' decision on forbearances
will probably be upheld because it is in the public interest.
Requiring S&amp;L owners to risk more of their own capital provides a
buffer between losses and government deposit insurance. It also
gives S&amp;L owners an incentive to operate their institutions more
safely.
   ``One has to question any sort of capital forbearance,'' Barth
said. ``Still, once they were granted, I can understand why the
acquirers are extremely unhappy with the rules being changed in the
middle of the game.''

<HEAD>U.S. May Export More Lumber as Asian Nations Bow Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cutbacks in sales of hardwood timber products
by some Southeast Asian countries are putting pressure on the
United States to export more logs and rough lumber, according to an
Agriculture Department report.
   Indonesia recently announced large increases in export taxes
``that make the export of hardwood logs and lumber nearly
prohibitive,'' the report said.
   The action puts Indonesia among a growing number of Asian
countries that are curbing exports of logs and rough lumber in
favor of sending furniture and other ``value-added'' products made
from wood abroad.
   ``Malaysia and the Philippines have previously taken action to
curb such exports, while Taiwan and Thailand have officially banned
commercial logging,'' the report said. ``These actions are
increasing the pressure on the U.S. industry to fill this growing
gap in international supply.''
   The report by the department's Foreign Agricultural Service said
the value of U.S. exports of solid wood products were up 15 percent
from a year earlier in the first nine months of 1989, while imports
were up only 7 percent.
   Overall, exports were valued at nearly $4.59 billion in the
first three quarters of last year. Japan accounted for $2.2
billion, or 48 percent of the U.S. wood exports, mostly as softwood
logs.
   Canada was the second-largest market during the
January-September period with $501.5 million, or 11 percent of the
total. South Korea was another big overseas buyer at $267.6 million.
   Analyst Margie Bauer of the USDA agency said the furniture
industry is undergoing major changes and there are opportunities
for U.S. exporters.
   ``Currently, Taiwan and, to a smaller degree, Korea are the
major furniture exporters in Asia,'' she said in the report. ``The
export furniture industries in Taiwan and Korea are facing severe
problems such as workers demanding higher wages, a shortage of
labor and high production costs.''
   Bauer added: ``Thus, the industries are relocating to Southeast
Asia, primarily Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.
Manufacturers in Taiwan and Korea rely heavily on hardwood logs
from Southeast Asia and hardwood products from North America.''
   The recent restrictions on exports by some of the Southeast
Asian countries, however, have reduced the supply of relatively
inexpensive hardwood logs, she said. As a result, U.S. hardwood
logs, lumber, veneers and panel products ``have an enormous
potential'' market in the new furniture producing countries.
   ``While the industry in these countries is young and
inexperienced, there is little doubt that it will grow
tremendously,'' Bauer said. ``Now is the time for the U.S. industry
to work together in educating these countries on the advantages of
using U.S. hardwoods in the manufacturing of furniture.''

   Farmers begin signing up today in the major
1990 crop acreage programs at local Agriculture Department offices.
The signup runs through April 13.
   Participating farmers agree to set-aside from production part of
their base acreage for individual crops. Wheat farmers, for
example, will have a basic ``acreage reduction'' program of 5
percent, while feed grains producers will have to idle 10 percent
of their base acres.
   When farmers enroll at local offices of the Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, they also may ask for
advance cash payments of 40 percent of the expected deficiency
payments that will be due in the 1990 program.
   Final settlement, minus the advances, will be made at the end of
the crop season when the full deficiency payments are computed. The
payments are designed to make up the difference between market
prices and a higher target level.
   The department said recently that the advance payments for 1990
will be reduced by 1.4 percent as required by the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1989.

   The National Turkey Federation is looking for
entries in its new ``Turkey Lovers Recipe Contest'' for young chefs
12 to 18.
   Entries can be submitted through April 15 and will be judged on
the basis of the recipe itself, the nutritional content of the
ingredients, and the food-handling techniques followed during
preparation.
   The federation said the recipes must include at least one pound
of fresh or fully cooked turkey meat. Two brief essays describing
the nutritional quality and food handling also must be submitted.
   Further information, including contest rules, are available by
sending a self-addressed stamped envelope to: Rules, National
Turkey Federation, 11319 Sunset Hills Road, Reston, Va. 22090.
   The senior event in poultry cooking belongs to the National
Broiler Council, which sponsors the annual national chicken cooking
contest, which began more than 30 years ago among producers in the
Delmarva area of Delaware, Maryland and Virginia.
   The council took it over in 1972 and made it a national event,
giving it a leg up on the turkey people, so to speak.

<HEAD>Met Opera Does First `Gioconda' in Seven Years</HEAD>

   ``La Gioconda,'' heard at the Metropolitan Opera
during its first season, back in 1883, was presented for the first
time this season with a sterling cast, most of them relative
newcomers to the Met. Conductor Nello Santi got the sounds he
wanted from the Met Orchestra.
   Monday's was the first performance of the opera at the Met in
seven years.
   ``La Gioconda,'' by Amilcare Ponchielli, is as melodic as a
Puccini opera. It's grand opera, needing lavish sets and costumes,
which it has from Beni Montresor's designs for the Met's opening
week in Lincoln Center in 1966. It also calls for a huge chorus, a
big ballet and big, emotional voices.
   Ghena Dimitrova had a rough edge on her voice in the first two
acts in the title role. But it's a passionate role so not
inappropriate, and her voice was more attractive in the last two
acts. The Bulgarian soprano made her Met debut as Turandot in 1987.
   The Met announced in September that Luciano Pavarotti wouldn't
be singing Enzo as planned and Nicola Martinucci would sing.
However, Bruno Beccaria, who has a fresh, open-toned,
young-sounding voice, sang with vigor and made a triumph.
   Alain Fondary, from Paris, who made his Met debut in 1988, is
just the kind of baritone the Met needs. As a spy he put a menacing
edge on his large voice but his vocal beauty flowed through,
showing that he needn't always sound evil. His low notes were firm,
a couple of very high notes less so.
   Alexandrina Milcheva, also of Bulgaria and also debuting in
1987, is a mezzo but sounded like a wonderful contralto as
Gioconda's mother.
   Stefania Toczyska of Poland, who bowed at the Met in 1988, was
very effective as Laura.
   Her husband was sung by a worthy Met veteran, Paul Plishka.
   Laura and Gioconda love the same man _ Enzo. He loves Laura
which causes stress, attempted murder and suicide in several
directions.
   ``The Dance of the Hours,'' newly staged this season by Rodney
Griffin, doesn't amount to much, not even getting peppy when the
famous music speeds up.

<HEAD>Think Tank: U.S. Spending on Education Lags Behind Other Nations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirteen other industrial nations spend
relatively more on elementary and secondary education than the
United States, says a report that challenges President Bush's
assertion that results _ not resources _ are the problem.
   The United States leads only Ireland and Australia among
industrial nations, the labor-backed Economic Policy Institute said
Monday in a briefing paper ``Shortchanging Education.''
   ``If the U.S. were to increase spending for primary and
secondary school up to the `average' level found in the other 15
countries, we would need to raise spending by over $20 billion
annually,'' said the report.
   M. Edith Rasell, author of the report, said the results were
based on data published by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization and by the federal government.
It focused on elementary and secondary education spending for 1985,
comparing expenditures as a percentage of national income.
   The Education Department disputed the study's findings. Deputy
Undersecretary Charles Kolb, in charge of the agency's budget, said
the institute used ``seriously flawed methodology to reach dubious
conclusions.''
   Kolb said the institute ``has mixed apples, oranges and
moonbeams to produce an indigestible concoction.'' He said the
United States ranks among the top five countries by the
department's calculations.
   ``It's fun to play with numbers but it can be a dangerous
delusion if used as a basis for public policy,'' he said. ``If
nothing else, this report points out the need for better math
education.''
   The institute's statistics show the United States spent 4.1
percent of its national income on K-12 education in 1985, while the
average abroad was 4.6 percent. Sweden spent 7 percent, followed by
Austria at 5.9 percent, Switzerland at 5.8 percent, Norway at 5.3
percent, Belgium at 4.9 percent and Denmark and Japan at 4.8
percent.
   Canada spent 4.7 percent, West Germany and France, 4.6 percent,
the Netherlands and United Kingdom, 4.5 percent and Italy, 4.2
percent.
   Behind the United States in spending, Australia spent 3.9
percent and Ireland spent 3.8 percent.
   Ms. Rasell said this is the first time ``that economists have
examined the factual underpinnings of the Bush administration's
claims about education spending.''
   The report pointed to President Bush's statement at last fall's
education summit that the ``U.S. lavishes unsurpassed resources on
schooling ... (and) our focus must no longer be on resources. It
must be on results.''
   According to the report, ``We recognize that money does not
guarantee excellence and we suspect that other changes _ in
curriculum, in the status of teachers, and in expectations about
students, to name just a few _ will also be fundamental to any
improvement in education quality and student achievement.
   ``But to begin a process of education reform by denying the need
to increase spending, especially when U.S. schools are underfunded
compared to those in other industrialized countries, places a
severely limiting constraint on any plans for educational
improvement.''
   To show problems with comparing relative expenditures, Kolb said
that in 1986, Mississippi spent per pupil 3.9 percent of its state
domestic product, while Minnesota spent 3.7 percent. However, in
dollars, Mississippi spent only $2,350 per pupil, compared with
Minnesota's $4,180.
   The report acknowledged that the ``U.S. spends comparatively
more than other countries on higher education.'' Ms. Rasell said
that ``when expenditures on all levels of education _ pre-primary,
primary, secondary and post-secondary _ are calculated, the United
States is in a three-way tie for second place among the countries
studied.''
   But when spending on higher education is removed from
comparative data, the report said ``the relative position of U.S.
spending falls from a three-way tie for second highest in spending
to close to the bottom of the group of 16 industrial nations.''

<TEXT>
   Sen. Bob Dole is proposing that the United
States reduce aid to Israel, Egypt, the Philippines, Turkey and
Pakistan by 5 percent and give the money to fledgling democracies
such as Poland, Hungary and Panama.
   ``To me, it boils down to this: Are big gains for freedom worth
a small cut in a few huge foreign aid programs? I say yes,'' the
Kansas Republican and Senate minority leader wrote in an opinion
piece in The New York Times today.
   The five countries he named as targets for reductions are the
largest recipients of U.S. foreign assistance. They receive more
than two-thirds of U.S. foreign aid.
   ``Does it make sense, at this historic moment, to provide these
countries practically all of our aid at the cost of foreclosing
dramatically promising new aid initiatives in Eastern Europe or
other important countries?'' Dole wrote. ``What about, for example,
those Latin American nations in the front lines in the war against
drugs?''
   A 5 percent cut in aid to the five countries would free about
$330 million, Dole said.
   The United States plans to spend $14.5 billion on foreign aid
this year. Of that, Israel is allocated $3 billion and Egypt is to
receive $2 billion.

   Victims of Stalinist murders and
repression in Bulgaria saw their cause vindicated at last when
Parliament voted to rehabilitate dozens who suffered in dark years
of jails and political trials.
   Two prominent victims: Nikola Petkov, executed in 1947, and Ivan
Todorov, dead of alleged suicide after his arrest in 1965, were
among dozens of people whose honor was officially restored by
parliamentary vote on Monday.
   Petkov, leader of the once powerful Bulgarian Agrarian Union
party, died as Communists moved throughout Eastern Europe to
establish the monopoly on political power that was voted out of
Bulgaria's constitution on Monday.
   Many of Petkov's associates also died in Bulgaria's purges,
which have never been fully examined. Todor Zhivkov, the hard-line
Communist leader ousted Nov. 10, discouraged close examination of a
past during his 35 years in power.
   The less powerful Social Democratic Party was also a victim of
the Communist repression in those years, although it was not banned
outright, recalled a witnesss, Ruen Krumov, former editor of the
Socialist newspaper.
   At least 29 prominent members of his party went to jail, Krumov
told reporters. He spent five years in labor camp.
   ``I'm very happy,'' he said as justice was done after decades.
``They asked us what we wanted, and we got what we wanted.''
   Earlier, Mikhail Genovsky, an elderly deputy from the Bulgarian
Agrarian Party _ the rump of Petkov's party, allowed by the
Communists under strict control _ expressed more bitterness about
the long-silenced history that now haunts the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe.
   ``The blood that has been shed, we cannot forget,'' he urged
Parliament, recalling how ``they even sent a murderer all the way
to Prague'' to kill another Agrarian leader.
   As in Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Poland, where parties
long subservient to the Communists have now found an independent
voice, the Agrarians in Bulgaria had been pushing for Petkov's
rehabilitation even before Zhivkov's ouster.
   The suppression of the Agrarians in the 1940s enhanced not only
the political monopoly of the Communists but also paved the way for
collectivization of Bulgaria's traditionally strong, peasant-based
agriculture.
   The totalitarian intolerance also doomed Todorov, who was
arrested for his alleged part in plotting against Zhivkov in 1965.
Said to have committed suicide, he is believed to have been
murdered.
   Others rehabilitated Monday included Lyudmila Slavova, the
28-year-old leader of the Socialist youth when she was murdered in
jail in 1948.
   As the country embarks on a journey into its past, Bulgarian
newspapers have recently carried several articles about the victims
of repression and their rehabilitation.
   Genovsky called for more frankness. The history of his party, he
stressed, was swallowed by the Communists who under Zhivkov kept
the party strictly limited to 120,000 members.
   ``This was no history,'' Genovsky told deputies. ``History is a
science ... We have yet to undertake a scientific history of the
Bulgarian Communist Party and the Agrarian Party.''

   The National Basketball Association is taking the
air out of a $1 million one-on-one duel between superstars Michael
Jordan of the Chicago Bulls and Magic Johnson of the Los Angeles
Lakers.
   ``A one-on-one game between Michael and Magic is neither
something that (the NBA) would want to sponsor itself or have some
other promoter do. NBA basketball games and the talents of our
players are something that the NBA and its teams should be
promoting, not third-party promoters,'' said Gary Bettman, NBA
senior vice president and general counsel, told the Chicago
Sun-Times.
   The only exceptions to the rule are exhibition games for
charity, Bettman said.
   The proposed contest would consist of two 15-minute halves to be
broadcast on pay television. The winner would receive $1 million,
with any additional money going to charities of the players'
choices, said Ross Levinsohn, a New York-based spokesman for Jordan.

<TEXT>
   Chain saws aren't just for massacres
anymore. Now they're for art, too.
   In Vermont, as in some other rural areas of the country, the
power tool best known for felling trees _ or as a prop in horror
movies _ is being used to sculpt figures out of wood.
   Along Route 100, between Waterbury and Stowe, roadside
menageries have sprouted, featuring life-size bears, buffaloes,
eagles, moose, skunks and giraffes carved with a chain saw.
   At one shop, hidden behind layers of sawdust, ear plugs and a
pair of welding goggles, Max Osorio bobs and jabs like a boxer _
except he's armed with a chain saw and his opponent is a block of
wood.
   Wood chips fly. Curious tourists stop and watch. But Osorio does
not stop. It takes him eight hours to make a 6-foot bear or Indian,
the two pieces that sell the most.
   Osorio starts with a tree trunk and envisions the figure. Then,
he hacks at it with unwavering attention, and recognizable parts
begin to appear. First the coarse head, the beak, then a wing, the
talons, and slowly, an eagle is born.
   ``It is still very rough, but when you consider I am working
with a chain saw, it's remarkable,'' boasted Osorio.
   ``I try to make the most detailed, realistic sculptures as
possible with the tool,'' said Osorio, who placed second last
summer in the fourth-annual World Championship Chain-saw Contest in
Hill City, Minn.
   ``It just takes practice.''
   Osorio, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Mexico, began
carving after working as a dishwasher in Stowe.
   ``One day I drove by a place and saw the wooden bears _ they
were selling them for $800 _ and I thought to myself, `I could do
that,''' Osorio said.
   Carving wasn't as easy as it looked, but he started with a
12-inch seated bear and has worked his way up to life-size animal
and human figures.
   ``Once I learned how, I wanted to do more than just the static
bear sitting, doing nothing. I try to get detail and action,'' he
said.
   There is plenty of action in Osorio's latest creation, an old
man on skis chasing a buxom skier in a bikini. Even the locals turn
their heads.
   Osorio, like other Vermont carvers, learned the craft at the
Spinning Wheel, a Route 100 gift shop.
   Owner Milo Marshall said he learned the skill six years ago from
an Arizona man who was traveling through Vermont.
   Marshall's wife, Emma, said half of the shop's $400,000 gross
annual income comes from chain-saw sculpture sales.
   After two years at the Spinning Wheel, Osorio moved to the
Mousetrap, a gift shop down the road. Some of Osorio's sculptures
sell for $2,000, and most between $250 and $500, with a 10 percent
commission to the shop, but Osorio is reluctant to disclose how
much he makes.
   ``All I'll say, is for somebody without a degree, who doesn't
speak good English, it's a good living.''
   One statue of an Indian that Osorio made was so perfect, he
said, he wanted to keep it for himself so he put a high price on it.
   ``But a man from Long Island came and his girlfriend liked it.
He was not scared of the price,'' Osorio said. The man also paid
Osorio to drive it to Long Island, where the man wanted to stand
the 10-foot Indian behind his desk.
   With three shops on Route 100 in Waterbury selling chain-saw
sculptures, the competition is fierce, but friendly.
   ``If the place down the road specializes in pigs, I won't do a
pig,'' Osorio said. ``But bears, everybody does the bears.''
   Pine Tree Creations, the smallest of the three, feels the
competition, owner Doug Joslyn said. He said he recently put up a
sign that now brings more tourists to his shop.
   ``But if I had a quarter for every person who took a picture,
I'd be better off than selling them,'' said Joslyn.
   Mrs. Marshall said tour buses often stop in her shop.
   ``Some buses stop just because the people on the bus start
screaming, `Stop!','' she said. ``The life-sized buffalo stopped
traffic for a long time.''

   They show up on television as often as six times a
day, the advertisements with pastoral scenes of waves, fields and
forest, the soothing voiceovers that ask existential questions
about eternity and values.
   ``A new vision, more idealistic,'' the voice promises.
   Despite the lack of automobile in the ad, many recognize the
spot as a commercial for Infiniti, the Japanese luxury car. But to
some New England viewers, not all is as it appears.
   A series of advertisements parodying the Infiniti approach has
had New England talking, laughing and watching.
   ``Questions. What are we for? Why am I here?'' asks a voice
narrating one of the parodic spots, as the camera shows a forest
scene. The voice continues: ``especially when Oldsmobile is having
a great sale right now.''
   The camera cuts to a plug from an Oldsmobile spokesman, a few
shots of cars, and a running track of the theme song ``This is not
your father's Oldsmobile.''
   When the scene returns to the forest, the voice asks: ``What is
a factory-to-dealer incentive anyway?'' It trails off, wondering:
``How much wood could a woodchuck chuck, if a woodchuck could
chuck...''
   To the makers of the Infiniti ad, imitation is the best form of
flattery.
   ``I think it's a terrific parody. They did a terrific job of
playing around with our ad,'' said Chuck Kushell, executive vice
president, general manager at Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos
Inc. Advertising of Los Angeles, where the Infiniti ads were made.
   In a November Gallup poll for Advertising Age magazine, the
Infiniti series had the best recall of all of the ads that month
among 1,000 viewers surveyed, ``over Coke, over McDonalds,''
Kushell said.
   Sidney Zussman, president of The New England Oldsmobile Dealers
and the owner of West Street Motors in Methuen, said his group
loved the ads _ and that sales at Oldsmobile went up 25 percent
during the holiday markdowns that were publicized by the ads.

<HEAD>Smoking, Cholesterol Increase Risk of Heart Disease Before Age 35</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young men who smoke or have high cholesterol
levels are more likely than others to show signs of heart disease
before they reach age 35, a study shows.
   The study is the first to link blood cholesterol levels and
smoking directly to hardening of the arteries, a precursor or heart
attacks and strokes, one of the study's directors said.
   Dr. Henry McGill said Monday that smoking in young men was a
stronger risk for artery damage than he had anticipated.
   ``In this age group, smoking and cholesterol are about equally
bad,'' said McGill. ``What surprised me ... was the effect of
smoking.''
   The findings, which McGill presented at the American Heart
Association's annual science writers' forum, are based on autopsies
of about 300 15- to 34-year-old white men who died violent deaths
or in accidents.
   The results support the contention of many cardiologists,
including McGill, who favor early steps to prevent heart disease.
   ``I really believe that the future of prevention of heart
disease in middle-age people has got to start in childhood,'' he
said.
   By age 34, one-fourth of the subjects already had what doctors
call ``raised lesions'' in their arteries, representing the
beginning of hardening of the arteries.
   Hardening of the arteries can lead to blockage of those blood
vessels, which in turn can cause a heart attack or a stroke.
   Some doctors disagree with the suggestion that prevention of
heart disease should begin in childhood.
   The heart association recommends that healthy children should
consume less than 300 milligrams of cholesterol per day and
moderate their intake of fats. But some doctors believe the
evidence is not yet strong enough to make such recommendations,
McGill said.
   Only one previous study had looked at hardening of the arteries
in young people, McGill said.
   That was a study described last year by Dr. Gerald Berenson of
New Orleans, who found that artery damage in 40 children and young
adults was worse in those who had high levels of the so-called bad
cholesterol, known scientifically as low-density lipoprotein, or
LDL.
   McGill's study, led by Dr. Robert Wissler of the University of
Chicago, is the first to link the artery damage in young people to
smoking and ``good cholesterol'' _ high-density lipoprotein, or HDL.
   To illustrate how important the effects were, McGill said that a
25-year-old man who smoked and had high levels of good cholesterol
would have twice the artery damage of a 25-year-old non-smoker who
had low levels of LDL.
   The findings were the first report from the study, which is
continuing and eventually will include 1,800 subjects.
   The study will explore how atherosclerosis is linked to high
blood pressure, diabetes, inherited factors and many other
processes inside arteries, McGill said.

<HEAD>New CBS Entertainment Chief Maps Out Plans for Reviving Network</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The newly appointed president of
CBS Entertainment says the network must overhaul its antiquated
prime-time lineup to rise out of last place in the ratings.
   Jeff Sagansky, who joined CBS two weeks ago from his position as
president of Tri-Star Pictures, said the current schedule appeals
to viewers ``well over 45'' years old, and that the network ``is
programming too narrowly in that direction.
   ``I don't think the network can be just a narrowcasting
vehicle,'' Sagansky said Monday night.
   ``We do need more comedies,'' he said. ``The question is which
night do you open a comedy night on?''
   Sagansky confessed that CBS is in worse shape than NBC was 10
years ago, when that network was in distant third. Sagansky said
one of the obstacles to CBS' comeback was that the current
television marketplace is more competitive.
   He said that one of the network's top priorities is
re-establishing contacts with some of Hollywood's more dynamic
producers.
   He said he would offer fresh talent the chance ``to do the show
that they've always wanted to do.''
   Sagansky, whose record at Tri-Star included such flops as
``Lock-up'' and hits like ``Steel Magnolias,'' said that the
network's struggling ``Pat Sajak Show'' would undergo several
changes beginning in February, but was in no immediate peril of
cancellation.
   He defended his recent cancellation of the cult favorite drama
``Beauty and the Beast,'' saying its ratings ``came to have no
future.''
   ``Wolf,'' which he also canceled, was ``done in ... by very bad
ratings.''
   He said he hoped that in five years, the length of his contract
with CBS, he would have returned the network to first place.
   Part of his plan, he said, rested with the re-introduction of
one-hour dramas, which have given way to situation comedies in
recent years.

   Communist authorities warned that efforts to
build democracy were in jeopardy after East Germans gripped by new
revolutionary fervor stormed the headquarters of the despised
secret police and ransacked it. Hundreds of thousands of other
protesters took to the streets Monday night across the country,
expressing anger at Communist leaders for not moving faster to
dismantle the secret police and implement reforms.
   They demanded the ouster of the Communists. Three months after a
peaceful popular revolt toppled old hard-line Communist leaders,
the party still essentially controls the government, media, economy
and bureaucracy.
   In the southern city of Cottbus, several dozen protesters pelted
the local secret police building with rocks and clashed with guards
in an unsuccessful attempt to storm it, news reports said.
   The Communist-led caretaker government, feeling the greatest
pressure in weeks, said the storming of the secret police
headquarters in East Berlin posed ``the gravest danger'' to efforts
to establish true democracy.
   Communist Premier Hans Modrow rushed to the building and,
through a loudspeaker, pleaded with the protesters to stop.
   He appealed for the demonstrators ``to stay in a dialogue'' with
his shaky governing coalition. Alternately facing angry
interruptions and applause, Modrow also professed ``full
understanding'' of the rage stemming from decades of repression at
the hands of the secret police.
   The protesters shouted ``We are the people! We are the people!''
as they rushed into the secret police building Monday afternoon.
They scattered documents and looted wine, food and clothing from
storerooms and closets.
   They filled stairways with papers, ripped out drawers from
offices and broke windows. Several ripped down a picture of
Communist leader Erich Honecker, who was ousted in October, and
trampled it.
   About 60 police on hand at the time did not try to stop them,
according to news reports. No injuries were reported and many in
the crowd appeared calm and good-natured as they milled through the
headquarters.
   Reports of the size of the crowd of protesters ranged from tens
of thousands to 100,000.
   The protesters dispersed by late evening. East German television
said a citizens' committee and regular police officers sealed off
the building after the protest.
   The police agency is being dismantled, and it was not clear how
many people were working at the headquarters Monday.
   Earlier Monday, Modrow offered opposition groups a far greater
say in running the caretaker government before free elections set
for May 6.
   However, the protests appear to be reaching further into
virtually all parts of society and age groups. Increasingly,
children and elderly people are taking to the streets with other
protesters.
   The New Forum opposition group had called Monday's protests to
challenge how the caretaker government is running the country.
   After the storming of secret police headquarters, state-run
television interrupted its programs several times to broadcast a
warning against further violence.
   ``The democracy that is just now developing is in the gravest
danger,'' said the warning. The statement called for ``calm and
reason,'' saying the protest ``had gotten out of control.''
   The Rev. Rainer Eppelmann, an opposition leader, said he
regretted the violence but said the government should take the
attack as an ``alarm signal'' and fulfill its pledge to abolish the
secret police.
   Government officials at talks with the opposition Monday morning
described the strength of the secret police and the weaponry
controlled by the agency, including rifles, rocket-propelled
grenades and machine guns.
   Televised reports on the meeting, including the announcement
that the security apparatus had accounted for more than 1 percent
of the national budget, may have set off the attack in East Berlin.
   Negotiators at the talks voted to force Egon Krenz, who was
ousted as Communist Party chief on Dec. 3 after six weeks in
office, to appear and answer questions about the party ties to the
secret police.
   Also Monday, tens of thousands of workers walked off their jobs
in several cities, including East Berlin, to demand an end to
Communist power and complete abolition of the secret police.
   Official news media also reported that a total of about 500,000
people demonstrated against the Communists and secret police in at
least a dozen other cities on Monday evening.
   About 150,000 people mounted a noisy protest against the
Communists in the opposition hotbed of Leipzig. They also chanted
slogans in favor of German unification and waved dozens of West
German flags.
   In Cottbus, about 50 people broke away from the main group of
several thousand and clashed with police guarding the secret police
headquarters there, the official ADN news agency said.
   The protesters threw stones and broke windows in an effort to
storm the building, but police forced them back, the agency said.
   Earlier Monday, chief national prosecutor Hans-Juergen Joseph
announced that he plans indictments for high treason against
Honecker and the ousted leader's former secret police chief, Erich
Mielke.
   The charge could result in a death sentence.

   An 18-year-old was fined $65 for underage
drinking in connection with an investigation into a reported rape
at the governor's mansion.
   David Ebach, starting quarterback for his high school football
team, did not appear in court. His guilty plea was entered Monday
by his lawyer.
   Circuit Judge James Anderson said the lawyer acknowledged that
Ebach was drinking at the mansion on Nov. 28, but did not indicate
how many people were involved.
   On Nov. 30, police received a report that four boys had raped a
girl at the mansion on the evening of Nov. 28.
   Gov. George Mickelson and his wife, Linda, were out of town at
the time. Their 17-year-old son, David, is the only other permanent
resident of the mansion. His whereabouts that evening have not been
disclosed.
   The governor has called the rape allegation unfounded, but has
refused to make any detailed comments about the investigation.
   Three juveniles have been charged, but their names and the
allegations against them have not been disclosed because of their
age.

   One of every 80 East Germans worked or
informed for the secret police, and 3,200 employees did nothing but
tap telephones and open mail, according to the official assigned to
dismantle the dreaded agency.
   Manfred Sauer said the huge state security apparatus cost 3.6
billion marks last year, the equivalent of $2 billion at the
official rate of the time.
   That was 1.3 percent of the entire national budget, Sauer told
the seventh weekly negotiating session between the Communists and
opposition on Monday. He spoke just hours before tens of thousands
of people ransacked security police headquarters in East Berlin.
   Sauer said Erich Honecker, the hard-line leader ousted in
October, expanded the agency dramatically after gaining power in
1971.
   By the end of the 1980s, there were 85,000 agents and 109,000
regular informants in a nation of 16.3 million people, Sauer said.
He added that, besides the 3,200 agents assigned to telephones and
mail, 5,000 were engaged in other forms of direct spying on
citizens.
   His disclosures were the most comprehensive yet about the
workings of the secret police.
   All information was stored in computers, he said, and the aim of
the Honecker regime was ``total, comprehensive surveillance'' to
frustrate dissent.
   Honecker built a ``disproportionately large'' surveillance
system and tried ``to solve political problems with methods of
penal law,'' Sauer said.
   Domestic spying has ceased and ``all directives against
dissidents were stopped by the government ... on Nov. 29,'' Sauer
told the meeting. He said 30,000 agents had been fired, new jobs
were being sought for 22,500 more and ``the rapid dismissal of
another 20,000 within the shortest time possible'' was being
arranged.
   Those remaining would be needed to supervise the dissolution of
the agency, Sauer said.
   The Interior Ministry has set Jan. 25 as the deadline for
retrieving all weapons from former secret police agents, including
124,000 pistols, 76,000 submachine guns, about 3,500
grenade-launchers and and 342 anti-aircraft guns.
   East German officials say the country faces an increasing threat
from neo-Nazis, which many in the opposition see as an attempt to
justify keeping the secret police or replacing them with a similar
organization.
   Interior Minister Lothar Ahrendt read a report at Monday's
meeting that said ``neo-fascist, anti-Semitic and anti-foreigner''
dangers exist throughout the country.

   A bomb in a parked van exploded
at a western village, damaging the local police station and more
than 50 homes, police said. No one was reported injured.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for Monday's attack,
but suspicion inevitably fell on the Irish Republican Army, which
is fighting British rule in the province.
   In a statement, Belfast police headquarters said the bomb
completely demolished one home beside the police station in Sion
Mills, which is about two miles from the border with the Republic
of Ireland.
   The police station, the apparent target, was extensively damaged.
   The building was empty at the time. Like many other country
police stations in Northern Ireland, it is only manned part time.
   Police said the bomb in the back of the van was spotted by local
people, who warned neighbors to flee before the explosion.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA wants to unite predominantly
Protestant Northern Ireland with the 95 percent Catholic Republic
of Ireland under socialist rule.

<HEAD>Infant Heart Transplants Proving Successful</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transplants are proving to be a successful
treatment for babies born with a deadly heart defect, according to
the first detailed study of such operations.
   The report, being published next month, shows that 23 of 28
heart recipients continued to do well several years after receiving
the transplants as infants, said Dr. Welton Gersony of Columbia
University in New York.
   The operations were performed by Dr. Leonard Bailey of Loma
Linda University Medical Center in California, who gained fame by
transplanting a baboon heart into the tiny patient known as Baby
Fae.
   Gersony predicted Monday that Bailey's report would convince
many surgeons of the value of infant heart transplants, and that
the use of the transplants would spread rapidly across the country.
   The infants who underwent the transplants were born without the
left side of the heart. The condition, known as hypoplastic left
heart syndrome, occurs in one of 3,000 to 5,000 American babies,
Gersony said.
   The only alternative to a transplant is a procedure called the
Norwood operation, which offers only about a 30- to 40-percent
chance of survival past two years, Gersony said.
   Without an operation, death usually occurs within weeks.
   Gersony said Bailey's report also demonstrates that it is
possible to simplify the process of obtaining donor infant hearts
for transplant.
   Bailey had thought it was necessary to bring the donor babies to
Loma Linda and remove their hearts there. He has now shown it is
possible to remove the heart and ship it separately, as is done
with adult donor hearts.
   Donor hearts often come from infants born with fatal nervous
system defects, Gersony said.
   Increased attention to infant heart transplants has enlarged the
supply of donor hearts, according to a report at an American Heart
Association meeting in November.
   ``In two years, we haven't lost a child on the waiting list for
a donor heart,'' said one of Bailey's Loma Linda colleagues, Dr.
Steven Gundry.
   At that meeting, Gundry reported on 17 infants given heart
transplants because of other severe heart defects. Only one of them
died, of pneumonia. The others had normal heart functions up to
four years after surgery, Gundry reported.
   Gersony said Bailey's forthcoming report suggests that the
immaturity of infants' immune systems makes them less likely than
adults to reject transplanted hearts.

   Eight former federal officials are trying to
get President to write Nelson Mandela in his South African jail as
a way to encourage negotiations between the white government and
the nation's black majority.
   The eight said contact from Bush ``could well contribute'' to
Mandela's release and return to political life.
   Their call was issued Monday under the auspices of the Foreign
Policy Institute.
   Affiliated with the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced
International Studies, the institute seeks consensus positions that
can be endorsed by former officials representing a range of
political philosophies.
   The statement was signed by Harold Brown, former secretary of
defense; William T. Coleman Jr., former transportation secretary;
Barbara Jordan, former Democratic congresswoman from Texas; Melvin
Laird, former defense secretary; Edmund Muskie, former secretary of
state; Herman Nickel, the Reagan administration's ambassador to
South Africa; and former Republican senators Charles McC. Mathias

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, one of the District of
Columbia's newer residents, is launching his own effort to get the
district admitted to the union.
   ``D.C. statehood is a mainstream issue,'' Jackson declared
Monday. ``We need to go to work ... mobilizing people all over the
country. We want democracy and not tyranny.''
   Jackson said the campaign, which began on the national holiday
honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King, ``would give
substance to the dream'' that King espoused.
   Jackson, who moved to the district last year, was joined at the
opening of the Rainbow Coalition's D.C. Statehood office by local
and national politicians, local labor leaders and mayoral hopeful
Sharon Pratt Dixon.
   Democratic National Committee Chairman Ron Brown, a former
Jackson aide and D.C. resident, noted that statehood for the
nation's capital was a plank in the 1988 Democratic platform.
   The district now has one, non-voting delegate to the House of
Representatives.

<HEAD>Democratic Leader Says Blacks, Jews Must Work Together</HEAD>

   The chairman of the Democratic National
Committee says blacks and Jews must take care to keep their
political bonds intact despite differences over various issues.
   ``Differences that can anger and even enrage cannot be allowed
to divide us,'' Ron Brown told an observance Monday at the Israeli
Embassy of Martin Luther King's birthday. ``We must realize that
the differences between our communities are not recognized by David
Duke and the Ku Klux Klan; that race hatred and religious
persecution walk hand-in-hand,'' he said.
   Duke is a former Klan leader serving in the Louisiana
Legislature. He has ties to neo-Nazi groups and is president of the
National Association for the Advancement of White People.
   Brown, the first black to be elected to the Democratic Party's
chairmanship, was the featured speaker at the fifth commemorative
observance held at the embassy.
   He said that just as King took his message outside his church
and into the streets, ``We must leave behind this gathering of
elites, and carry a message to those in our communities who are not
here _ the poor and disaffected, the uneducated, the prejudiced and
the angry people who search for targets and scapegoats.
   ``That message is this: it is not Jews that have bombed and
threatened civil rights leaders, and it is not blacks who are
painting swastikas on synagogues,'' Brown said. ``We do not
threaten one another.''

   A propeller airplane carrying 23
people slammed into a mountain in stormy weather shortly after
takeoff and everyone on board was killed, officials said.
   A rescue patrol that reached the crash site at 9 p.m. Monday,
about 12 hours after the crash, recovered all 23 bodies, said Juan
Felix Barrantes, head of the Civil Guard.
   The twin-engine commuter plane, a Spanish-made Aerocar, belonged
to Servicios Aereos Nacionales, a subsidiary of Lineas Aereas
Costaricense S.A., the national airline. It had a Costa Rican crew
of three.
   Carlos Jimenez, a spokesman for the Public Security Ministry,
said the plane crashed into 1,500-foot Pico Blanco Mountain, about
10 miles southwest of the capital's Juan Santamaria Airport.
   Jimenez said 10 passengers were foreigners, but he could not
provide names. Officials at the Canadian Embassy said the security
ministry had informed them that seven or eight of the passengers
were thought to be Canadian.
   There were unconfirmed reports the passengers also included
U.S., Swiss and Panamanian citizens. Officials said the bodies
would be brought down from the mountain today.
   The aircraft had taken off for Palmar Norte, a town in southern
Costa Rica, when apparently it was driven against the mountain by a
gust of wind, Jimenez said.
   Jimenez gave no details except to say the weather was foggy and
that a strong storm was blowing through the area when the plane
took off.

<HEAD>Stocks In Major Loss, Dollar Edges Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index followed up
its worst single-day drop in more than two years with a slightly
larger plunge today, while the dollar edged up against the Japanese
yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 666.41 points, or 1.8
percent, closing at 36,850.36, its lowest level since the 36,881.53
closing Nov. 27.
   The market was closed Monday for a national holiday. On Friday,
the Nikkei lost 656.36 points, then its worst one-day plunge since
731.91 on Nov. 19, 1987, following a crash on Wall Street.
   So far this year, the Nikkei has lost nearly 2,000 points, or
6.8 percent.
   ``The market was marred with sell orders all day long,'' said
Ichitaro Watanabe, a dealer at Nikko Scurities Co. ``It was the
result of a combination of unfavorable factors hitting the market
all at once.''
   With investors dumping issues, the index began its dive as soon
as the market opened today, and quickly fell below the 37,000-point
level, dealers said.
   ``Nobody was buying,'' said Yoshio Shimoyama of Nikko
Securities. ``Everybody was watching and waiting.''
   Dealers and analysts have said the Nikkei's recent fall has
resulted largely from falling government bond prices caused by the
weakening yen. The yen's weakness also has intensified existing
pessimism in the stock market, they said.
   ``But over the weekend, the regional conflict worsened in the
Soviet Union and the New York market fared poorly overnight,
aggravating the market's pessimism,'' said Keiichi Nishida, a
dealer at Kidder Peabody.
   Dealers said the fall in bond prices is likely to stop soon
because yields are approaching an appropriate level, around 7
percent, but a recovery in stock prices is unlikely before Japan's
general elections in February.
   ``Right now, market players see no encouraging sign to buy
issues,'' said Yoshiro Inoue, an analyst at Nomura Securities.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 145.75 yen, up 0.40
yen from Friday's close of 145.35 yen. It opened at 145.85 yen and
ranged between 145.65 yen and 146.07 yen.
   Traders attributed the U.S. currency's strength in Tokyo to its
rise against most major foreign currencies Monday, while the New
York and Tokyo markets were closed for holidays.
   The central bank's dollar-selling intervention kept the dollar
from rising more steeply, said a trader with the Bank of Tokyo,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Kyodo News Service said the bank sold more than $400 million.
The bank does not comment on its exchange market activities.
   The Bank of Tokyo trader said the lower stock and bond prices
prompted market players to sell yen.
   Chizuko Satsukawa, a trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo, said
the yen will remain weak for the time being.
   ``Concerns over the election are prompting market players to get
rid of the yen, which helps the dollar become stronger,'' she said.
   But a sharp plunge by the yen is also unlikely while the Bank of
Japan is actively selling dollars, Ms. Satsukawa said.

   Despite the intense scrutiny given the Charles
Stuart case, investigators still are not entirely sure of the
answer to the major remaining question in the twisted drama: Who
shot Stuart and his wife, and how?
   Police are leaning toward the scenario that Stuart, who died
Jan. 4 in what is believed to be suicide set off when a brother
implicated him, shot his wife and himself last Oct. 23. But they
cannot rule out a different gunman.
   In a hospital interview several days after the shootings, Stuart
told police an assailant entered the back seat of their car at a
red light, forced him to drive to a remote area of the city, robbed
the couple, and then shot them.
   In a short time, police came up with a suspect with a long
criminal record. Stuart's deception, legal experts say, got the
investigation off on the wrong track by shifting the focus away
from him and the physical evidence.
   ``It's very common that once the police have a suspect who
satisfies them they will stop looking at other people,'' said
lawyer Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law School professor. ``They
don't want the defense later saying that they were looking at other
people because they had doubts about your case.''
   It has been determined that three bullets were fired that night:
One hit the roof of Stuart's car, one hit Stuart in the stomach,
and one struck his wife.
   An affidavit indicates Carol Stuart was struck on the left side
of the head, which would seem to rule out a gunman shooting from
the outside right of the car. The possibilities remain that Stuart
could have shot his wife and then himself, that another person
could have shot both of them from the rear or the outside left of
the car, or a combination of the two.
   An investigator who would not be identified by name said
Stuart's car was examined by the city crime lab and that the angles
of the shots appeared consistent with Stuart's account.
   When asked where the results of that examination might be
obtained, the investigator said: ``I don't know that anything was
ever put into writing; I never saw any paper on it.'' Dershowitz
said investigators have a tendency to avoid producing documents
that defense attorneys might later poke holes into.
   Police would not comment when asked if fingerprint and fiber
checks were made on the car, which Stuart traded in on a new car
after he left the hospital in December.
   Authorities have said Stuart was a suspect _ as are all husbands
and wives when a spouse is slain _ but only a remote one because
they had no reason to doubt him until he was implicated by his
youngest brother.
   In hindsight, a question about the shootings might have been
stirred by a comment Stuart made in the very early moments after
the crime.
   In his car phone plea for help, Stuart was asked if his wife was
shot. He told the police dispatcher: ``Yes. In the head.'' The
dispatcher asked: ``In the head?'' Stuart responded: ``Yes, I
ducked down.''
   Was Stuart saying that he avoided being shot because he ducked
or that his wife was hit because he ducked _ an almost impossible
result of a shot fired toward Stuart from the back seat?
   The investigator indicated Stuart was not pressed on the point.
   Stuart might also have been pressed when, according to an
affidavit, he was interviewed in the hospital several days after
the shootings. Although Stuart could not tell the dispatcher where
he was the night of the crime until he drove to a major
thoroughfare, in the hospital he was able to steer investigators to
a street _ where he said the shots were fired _ so obscure that it
cannot be found on at least two detailed city maps.
   Of witnesses who said the arrested suspect, William Bennett,
admitted the shooting, one has since said he was coerced into
making those statements, and another has said he was coached by
investigators. Bennett has been cleared but remained in jail on
other charges.
   John Julian, a spokesman for the Suffolk County district
attorney, who is in charge of the investigation, said the office
stands by its procedures.
   Meanwhile, investigators have turned to Charles Stuart's
youngest brother, Matthew.
   Matthew has said, through his lawyer, that Charles arranged for
him to follow Charles to a meeting place, where Charles tossed him
his wife's bag and a gun, and that Matthew then left, having no
indication that a shooting had occurred. He said the bag and gun
were thrown in a river in Revere.
   Had Charles or someone else already done the shooting? That
would mean Stuart had driven to the meeting place and tossed the
bag while he was suffering from a life-threatening injury.
   The gun believed used in the crime was pulled from the river
last week and is being analyzed by the FBI crime lab.
   A grand jury has taken a recess in the case. One prosecutor has
said the panel might not indict anyone, and that no one may ever
know what happened.
   ``Just about anything's still possible,'' he said.

   Tourists who ignore warnings not to feed
the wildlife are doing so at increasing risk at Yellowstone
National Park, where some animals have begun to bite the hand that
feeds them.
   While rangers do not have specific figures showing an increase
in animal attacks, they have noticed that in recent years more and
more coyotes, bighorn sheep and other animals have learned to
associate man with food because of the handouts tourists offer.
   ``I was riding a snow machine two winters ago, I guess, toward
Old Faithful and there was a coyote in the road and we stopped and
the guy with me wanted a photograph of it,'' recalled Ranger Norm
Bishop. ``He pulled his camera out and I started to pull mine out.
The instant I touched that bag the coyote was almost in my lap.
   ``He instantly associated the sound of that plastic bag with
potato chips, Fritos, hamburger, whatever, he was ready for it,''
said Bishop. ``It was really unsettling to me. I didn't like an
animal that close to me eager to have what I had.''
   Skirmishes between humans and animals can be fatal. In recent
years, a French tourist was fatally gored by a bison, and a Montana
photographer was killed by a grizzly bear he was hoping to
photograph. Last year, a black bear who repeatedly forced hikers up
trees and ravaged their backpacks for food was killed by rangers.
   A recent coyote attack on a cross-country skier likely was
simply a case of the skier surprising the animal, park officials
believe.
   ``We know that grizzly bears, occasionally black bears, and
mountain lions and coyotes are all dangerous to people,'' Bishop
said.
   ``But in most cases, not all but in most, what we see is that
the animals, particularly the bears that actually killed someone,
were bears that were habituated by people feeding them.''
   Part of the problem, according to park spokeswoman Marsha Karle,
is the growing number visitors to Yellowstone, which reported a
record 2.9 million last summer.
   ``We can't have rangers behind every tree,'' she said.
   And the animals have grown somewhat lenient to man, Bishop said.
   ``Most of the time the animals are so darn cooperative. They're
just doing their own thing,'' he said. ``We have elk here in
Mammoth that you can walk within 10 feet of them. Some of them
don't get up. Some don't even look up.
   ``The animals are basically saying, `Hey, all we want to do is
stand here and eat. You guys, as long as you don't approach us and
show signs of harming us, you're OK with us,''' he said. ``The
laissez faire arrangement works great, as long as people don't get
within the personal space ... of the animal. But you get within
that space of that animal, they're like us. If you crowd me
aggressively, I'm going to push.
   ``When the bison has the pushing equipment that he's got, I
don't want to be pushed,'' said Bishop.
   Visitors are inundated with literature about Yellowstone's
wildlife when they enter the park, officials said.
   ``We have just tried really hard to educate people, gently, and
in a forthright manner, to say, `Look, the animals are big, they're
strong, they're fast, they're capable of doing you fatal harm,'''
Bishop said.
   ``So respect them, keep your distance, act predictably, except
in really rare circumstances, you'll stay out of trouble.''

<HEAD>16 Acquitted, 4 Convicted in Drug Smuggling Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sixteen men, mostly boat captains and
truck drivers, have been acquitted in what authorities said was a
marijuana smuggling ring with links to deposed Panamanian dictator
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Four of the 20 co-defendants were convicted Monday on the fifth
day of deliberations in the 2{-month trial.
   ``I think the entire trial was a defeat for the prosecution,''
said Rick Michot, a defense attorney.
   The defendants had been charged with conspiracy, importation and
distribution. Federal prosecutors said the defendants smuggled
48,000 pounds of marijuana into North Carolina in 1982 and 280,000
pounds into Louisiana in 1983.
   They planned to smuggle 1 million pounds into Missouri in 1984,
prosecutors said, but were foiled by the arrest of ringleader
Stephen Michael Kalish. Kalish testified as the star prosecution
witness that what he called the ``Master Blaster'' load was to
arrive a few days before he was arrested.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Lombardino, the chief prosecutor,
refused to comment after the verdicts, saying a related trial of 25
people is coming up.
   The cases resulted from the same investigation that led to
Noriega's 1988 indictment in Tampa, Fla., on drug charges.
   Kalish testified that he once gave Noriega a $300,000
``present'' for helping arrange a Panamanian banking network to
launder drug profits. He said the network he set up with Noriega
laundered $50 million to $100 million a month for the Medellin
cocaine cartel of Colombia.
   One juror, Rowdy Lege, 30, said some members of the panel
``voiced concern'' over Noriega's involvement, and the possibility
of retaliation by drug lords.
   Convicted on 16 counts were Jerry Hughey of Austin, Texas; Jim
Swope, also of Texas; and Max Wade, no hometown available. They
could be sentenced to 170 years in prison. Steve Ellender of Houma,
La., was found guilty on six conspiracy counts and innocent on
seven others. He could be sentenced to 30 years.
   U.S. District Judge John Shaw postponed sentencing until after a
background check of the four.
   Patricia Thomas, Ellender's attorney, said she will appeal on
grounds of an ``inconsistent verdict.''
   Some of the defendants who were acquitted said it was a
bittersweet victory.
   ``I feel kind of used,'' said Phillip Watkins. ``Win or lose
we've already lost.''
   Clark Nash of Missouri said he's broke, and doesn't know what to
do.
   ``Everything I've worked for for 30 years went to my lawyer,''
he said.
   Kalish, who said his drug-smuggling organization operated from
the late 1970s through 1984, is currently in prison. He pleaded
guilty in Tampa in 1987 to a charge of continuing criminal
enterprise.
   In November, Jay Foreman, a pilot who said he flew a private
airplane for Kalish, testified that Noriega was a passenger aboard
the plane several times.
   Originally 187 people were accused in the case, but many
plea-bargained or were culled for separate trials. The judge
acquitted three before the defense opened.
   Officials say about 90 of those indicted remain fugitives.
   The conspiracy centered on the smuggled marijuana. The other
charges dealt with aiding and abetting the importation and
distribution.
   Hughey, Swope and Wade were convicted on all those counts, plus
three each of wire fraud, interstate commerce and the illegal
distribution of funds from the conspiracy.
   In the next trial, for Feb. 12, 19 of the defendants are accused
of higher-level involvement in the ring. Among them is Harold
``Doc'' McGhee, manager of the rock groups Bon Jovi, Skid Row and
The Scorpions.
   Kalish identified McGhee as the link between the smuggler and a
Colombian drug supplier. McGhee was given a suspended sentence
after pleading guilty to importing marijuana in North Carolina.

<TEXT>
   Ground-water pumping by the Antelope
Valley's growing population is cracking and sinking the dry lakebed
runways famed as landing strips for space shuttles and test pilots.
   During a California Water Commission hearing here last week, Air
Force officials said the floor of Rogers Dry Lake has subsided 3
feet in some places, and is broken by fissures up to 3 feet wide, 2
feet deep and hundreds of feet long.
   The Air Force has been able to keep using the clay runways only
by filling in the cracks.
   ``We're seeing severe cracks throughout the whole lakebed,''
said Col. Peter Walsh, civil engineer for the Mojave Desert
military base.
   Many space shuttles have landed on dry lakebed runways, although
Columbia was scheduled to touch down on a concrete landing strip on
Friday.
   The U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a $6 million, five-year
study of the problem and other water-use issues for the Air Force.
   ``It's very obvious ground-water pumpage is having an impact on
the subsidence at Edwards Air Force Base,'' said John Klein,
district chief of the survey's water resources division.
   Klein said the sinking and related drinking-water shortages at
Edwards will continue unless ``major steps are taken to limit
further withdrawals'' of ground water.
   Water use has climbed during the past decade as the population
of the Antelope Valley, which includes Lancaster and Palmdale,
doubled to almost 200,000. Air Force officials are urging local
water agencies to use less ground water and use more water brought
from the north via the California Aqueduct.
   The water table at Edwards dropped from about 10 feet below the
surface in 1948 to a recent level of 100 feet underground, Klein
said, adding it is difficult to determine how much of the drop is
caused by population growth.
   Edwards is 300,000 acres, the second-largest Air Force base in
the continental United States. It is home to the famed Flight Test
Center whose pilots were glorified in Tom Wolfe's book ``The Right
Stuff.''

<TEXT>
   A batch of spring water that smelled
like kerosene was recalled from stores in six states after a woman
who drank some of it was hospitalized.
   Pocono Pure Mountain Spring Water recalled 7,000 one-gallon
bottles from Pathmark and Shop-Rite supermarkets in Delaware,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts
on Monday. Store officials removed all Pocono spring water products
from the shelves.
   The tainted water was in clear vinyl bottles with identification
numbers 26582-00050 and expiration dates of Dec. 26, 1991 and Jan.
4, 1992.
   Carl J. Petro, president of Pocono Artesian Waters Co. of Mount
Pocono, Pa., said he suspected the problems were with the
containers and not with the water. He said water bottled the same
day as the recalled bottles, but put in different containers, was
not tainted.
   The company has sent samples of the water and containers to an
independent laboratory for tests, Petro said.
   Petro said the tainted water ``has a petroleum odor to it. It
smells more like kerosene.''
   The bottles were recalled after Delaware state police learned
that Jettie Quigley, 38, of Chadds Ford, Pa., became ill Sunday
after drinking water she purchased at a Pathmark store in
Wilmington.
   Quigley, who complained of chest pains, was in satisfactory
condition Monday at Riddle Memorial Hosptial in Lima, Pa.
   Petro said that about 10 months ago, the company had a problem
with 4,000 bottles of water in similar containers. The water,
however, was sampled before it was delivered to grocery stores. A
company investigation did not reveal the source of the smell, Petro
said.
   He refused to identify the manufacturer of the container.
   In both cases, employee tampering has been ruled out, he said.

<HEAD>Emnity Between Armenians, Azerbaijanis Has Historical Roots</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The antagonism between Armenians and Azerbaijanis
that has led to deadly clashes in the Soviet Caucasus has deep
historical roots and religious and ethnic overtones.
   Armenians claim that after the Soviet takeover in Azerbaijan,
the republic was given large chunks of territory like
Nagorno-Karabakh and Nakhichevan that was historically part of
Armenia with majority Armenian populations.
   They blame Josef Stalin, a native of the Caucasus who was the
top Soviet official for nationality problems before becoming
Communist Party leader and dictator.
   Under Azerbaijani rule, Armenians assert, Nakhichevan has been
virtually rid of its Armenian population. In Nagorno-Karabakh,
which is still predominantly Armenian, the local population was
long deprived of basic services and cultural activities like
Armenian-language television and radio broadcasts, Armenians say.
   For their part, Azerbaijanis note the 1977 Soviet Constitution
gives them control over Nagorno-Karabakh and that the so-called
autonomous region cannot join Armenia without Azerbaijani consent.
   ``Without Shusha, Azerbaijan has no soul,'' an Azerbaijani
saying goes, referring to a town in Nagorno-Karabakh that
historically has been populated by Azerbaijanis.
   Most Azerbaijanis, a Turkic people, are Shiite Moslems; most
Armenians Christian.
   In 1915, an estimated 1.5 million Armenians perished at the
hands of Ottoman Turks. Many Armenians today refer to Azerbaijanis
simply as ``Turks,'' showing they do not distinguish between their
Soviet neighbors and the authors of the genocide against their
people three-quarters of a century ago.

<HEAD>Plane Crashes Into Mountain; All Survive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   All 16 people aboard a commuter plane survived
after it struck a mountaintop during a snowstorm and plunged down a
hillside in a crash landing some passengers called a miracle.
   ``We started bumping up and down and I didn't know where we were
or what was happening,'' said Nicole Blohm, a 20-year-old
passenger. ``Apparently we were sliding down the mountain at that
time. I knew we had crashed. I was thinking, ``This is it.'''
   Monday's crash of the SkyWest turboprop in northeast Nevada was
one of three airline mishaps in two days.
   A Boeing 747 jetliner carrying 257 people lost power for five
minutes over the Pacific Ocean on Sunday, but the Philippine
Airlines pilots restarted the engines and landed safely in
Honolulu, the company said.
   In Colorado on Monday, a fire broke out in an engine of an Aspen
Airways plane shortly after takeoff, but the plane returned safely
to the Grand Junction airport for an emergency landing, officials
said. None of the 26 passengers was injured.
   In Nevada, most of the passengers walked away from the crash
after the plane, Flight 5855, went down four miles west of the
airport in Elko. The plane was bound for Reno from Salt Lake City
via Elko, a town of 8,800.
   Four people were admitted to Elko General Hospital in fair
condition and 12 others were treated and released, according to a
nursing supervisor.
   The captain, who suffered a broken leg and at least two broken
ribs, was the most seriously injured, the hospital said.
   ``I think it is a miracle none of us died,'' said 18-year-old
Kristina Blohm, Nicole's sister.
   The year-old Metro III twin-engine plane, carrying 14 passengers
and two crewmembers, crashed when the pilot was attempting an
instrument landing during the snowstorm.
   Helicopter pilot Ted McBride, who spotted the wreckage, said the
plane apparently clipped the top of a 6,463-foot mountain.
   The plane then became airborne briefly before skidding about a
quarter of a mile down the steep slope. McBride said the crash
probably would have been more serious had the plane slammed into
level terrain instead of losing velocity as it skittered down the
snowy, treeless slope.
   No one aboard was thrown from the plane and its fuselage was
intact on the mountain, rescuer Pete Schory said.
   ``Right now, I'm feeling that the outcome is wonderful,'' said
SkyWest President Jerry Atkin. ``The thing you hope for in these
situations is for all survivors. It's certainly unpleasant to have
such a thing happen, but I'm very pleased with the outcome.''
   There was no immediate indication of what caused the crash,
Atkin said from St. George, Utah, where the airline is based. But
he said the plane was 500 feet lower than the pilot believed.
   SkyWest serves 44 cities in eight Western states: Nevada,
Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Colorado, Utah, Arizona and California. It
has 500 flights a day and serves more than a million passengers a
year.
   In Colorado, an engine on a Convair 580 propjet caught fire
about five minutes after takeoff from Grand Junction for Denver,
authorities said.
   Officials said the pilot cut the engine, and the plane landed
under power from the remaining engine. The fire was out when the
plane landed, witnesses said.
   ``The folks who were getting off the plane had smiles on their
faces, and I was surprised,'' said Jeff Wendland, a spokesman for
Walker Field airport. ``I expected to see a lot of white faces.''
   There was no immediate comment from the Denver-based airline.
   In Hawaii, the jumbo jet was 135 miles from Honolulu and about
to start its descent from 37,000 feet when its four engines went
dead, according to Enrique Santos, airline vice president for
communications.
   The pilot, Capt. Eduardo Reyes Jr., proceeded with the descent
and power was restored in all engines at 25,500 feet, Santos said.
He added that the flight proceeded normally and landed in Honolulu
without further incident.
   The aircraft has been grounded at Honolulu pending examination
by the Federal Aviation Administration and the airline.

   The dollar rose in hectic early European trading
today, boosted by unrest in the Soviet Union and East Germany,
currency dealers said.
   Gold prices also rose.
   News late Monday that the Soviet Union had declared a state of
emergency in the Nagorno-Karabakh region and that fighting between
Azerbaijanis and Armenians continued had triggered a decisive rally
in the dollar, traders said.
   The storming of the secret police headquarters in East Berlin by
tens of thousands of East Germans late Monday also contributed to a
firmer U.S. currency, they said.
   ``The dollar is very strong on the news from Russia,'' said one
trader in Milan, Italy.
   The mounting ethnic tension in the Soviet Union is leading to a
``flight into quality,'' he said, referring to investors'
preference to hold dollar funds in times of political uncertainty.
   ``Everyone's looking at the political situation in the East bloc
right now,'' said one trader at a major West German bank in
Frankfurt. ``I think the dollar is on the way up, but it'll go very
cautiously.''
   The market is also positioning itself for the report on U.S.
business inventories in November later today and the U.S. November
trade figures on Wednesday, traders said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.40 yen to a closing 145.75 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 145.53 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.7095 West German marks, up from 1.6965
   _1.5270 Swiss francs, up from 1.5120
   _5.8115 French francs, up from 5.7625
   _1.9250 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9015
   _1,273.25 Italian lire, up from 1,261.375
   _1.1640 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16225
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.6520 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6620 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $413.00 a troy ounce, up
from $412.00 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $415.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $414.10, up from $412.40 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, gold in Hong Kong rose $1.67 to close at a bid $413.77.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.30 a troy ounce from

   Pollution, overcrowding and other ills of urban
life may leave the busy residents of Japan's capital unfazed, but
it took just a few inches of snow today to delay tens of thousands
on their appointed rounds.
   The season's first snowfall forced a two-hour closure of Tokyo's
international airport.
   Commuter and inner city trains ran late.
   And 23 people got hurt in falls on slippery streets, the Kyodo
News Service reporting, quoting fire officials.
   All the breakdowns and confusion stemmed from a snowfall that
left only 3 to 5 inches around the area that sometimes survives
winter without any storms leaving snow on the ground.
   Authorities ordered New Tokyo International Airport at Narita,
about 35 miles northeast of Tokyo, to close in the late afternoon
to clear wet snow from a runway.
   The airport authority said 23 incoming flights were diverted to
other airports in Japan and 12 departures were delayed.
   About 50,000 morning commuters were delayed by slow-running
trains.
   Japan Railway officials reported 76 high-speed, inter-city
``bullet trains'' ran behind schedule after the snow started
falling overnight, Kyodo said.

<HEAD>Attorneys Plan to Press For Noriega's Release on Bail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for Manuel Noriega said the defense team
will push for the deposed dictator's release on bond since the
government has opened a ``Pandora's box'' by requesting a detention
hearing.
   ``I don't think the government will be able to establish the
facts necessary for the court to pretrial detain our client without
any bond,'' attorney Steven Kollin said Monday. ``He's presumed to
be innocent, he's entitled to a bond.
   ``That is our system of jurisprudence, and we feel that under
these circumstances that should be the ruling.''
   Noriega's lawyers initially did not ask for a bond hearing in
his drug trafficking trial in part because they questioned the
jurisdiction of the court, Kollin said.
   Kollin and his co-counsel have said they probably will file
pretrial motions claiming Noriega is a head of state and immune
from prosecution.
   But Kollin says the government's action _ which led to the
scheduling of a detention hearing Jan. 26 _ has ``put us in a
posture that we would have to deal with that issue (of detention)
and we feel we will be successful.''
   Noriega reportedly has been held in a basement apartment in the
Miami federal courthouse since arriving in the United States Jan. 4.
   A February 1988 U.S. indictment accuses the ousted general of
taking $4.6 million in bribes from Colombia's Medellin cartel to
turn his nation into a way station for cocaine traffic.
   He could be imprisoned up to 145 years in prison and fined as
much as $1.1 million if convicted.
   On Friday, a federal magistrate set a $1 million bail for one of
Noriega's co-defendants, Daniel Miranda. But that ruling was
immediately appealed by prosecutors, blocking Miranda's release.
   Miranda, charged in the same 1988 indictment, is accused of
flying $800,000 in laundered drug money from Fort Lauderdale to
Panama.

   Carbon monoxide fumes from a

then living in the house, but a city official said it was unclear
whether the problem ever was fixed.
   The victims moved into the one-story, two-bedroom home a week
ago today; unpacked moving boxes were scattered throughout the
house when the bodies were found, police Lt. Rich Resling said
Monday.
   The victims died Wednesday evening from carbon monoxide
poisoning, said El Paso County's deputy coroner, Michael Stewart.
They were identified as Sophia Gerardo, 34; her sons, Daniel
Gerardo, 9, Nash Gerardo, 11, and Mario Ortiz, 13; and her nephew,
Mark McPeak, 15.
   Carbon monoxide instead of carbon dioxide can be produced when a
heater fails to burn fuel adequately, Stewart said.
   Stewart said the woman may have been aware that something was
wrong because she apparently tried to pull herself upright by
grabbing a plant stand, which was found toppled next to her.
   ``It looked like she was trying to get out,'' Stewart said.
   The body of McPeak was found in the bathroom, where he probably
went after feeling nauseated, Stewart said. The other children were
found in bed and probably died in their sleep, he said.
   Resling said a neighbor alerted police Sunday after peering into
a window and seeing a body. An officer became ill from fumes while
examining the house, Resling said.
   ``In about two minutes, he would have passed out,'' Resling
said. ``He was lucky to get out of there.''
   City Utilities Department inspectors measured the carbon
monoxide level in the house Sunday at 800 parts per million, twice
the lethal level.
   City spokesman John Henry said that on Sept. 9, a previous
occupant of the house was overcome by carbon monoxide and taken to
a hospital, and that inspectors that day ``red-tagged'' the furnace
as unsafe.
   Henry could not say whether the furnace had since been repaired
because the city does not perform follow-up inspections.
   Former tenant Brenda Hogsett said in an interview published in
today's Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph two people were sickened
in the September incident and the building's 75-year-old owner,
Darrell Atkinson, was aware of it. She did not know if the furnace
had been fixed.
   Atkinson, who was distraught over the deaths, declined to
comment, the newspaper said.
   Dallas Lopez, a friend of the dead woman, said he also was aware
of the past problems with the furnace. ``They had all kinds of city
workers and the fire department looking around,'' he said, adding
that they later said they fixed the problem.
   Resling said police were continuing an investigation.

<HEAD>Romanian Government Blames Trial Delays on Defendants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief prosecutor says leading
figures from the deposed Ceausescu regime are going on trial this
week on charges ranging from complicity to commit genocide to
undermining the national economy.
   The comments Monday from Prosecutor-General Gheorghe Robu
represented the first time the revolutionary government has
outlined the charges against people who were once among Romania's
most powerful officials.
   He was quoted by the official Rompres news agency as saying
pre-trial investigations and the taking of depositions had been
hindered because ``many of the ex-officials can hardly write, even
though a good part of them held a doctorate in science.''
   Critics have complained that the new government is not moving
fast enough against high-ranking officials of the ousted regime of
executed Communist dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu.
   Robu said that Nicu Ceausescu, the most notorious of Ceausescu's
children, would be among those tried this week.
   As local Communist Party chief in the Transylvanian city of
Sibiu, Nicu reportedly ordered members of the Securitate special
police to open fire on demonstrators during the revolution that
toppled Ceausescu last month.
   Nicu's sister, Zoia-Elena, and brother, Valentin, have also been
arrested. Valentin, who was a member of the Communist Party's
policy-setting Central Committee, is also to go on trial this week
with other Ceaucescu associates and members of the special police.
   Among other defendants to be tried this week, according to
Romanian television, are former Interior Minister Tudor Postlenicu
and former Communist Party Secretary Emil Bobu.
   The country's new leaders, the National Salvation Front Council,
have not said exactly when or where the trials would take place.
   But Rompres told The Associated Press that trials for special
police members would be held Friday in the western city of
Timisoara, where the revolt began Dec. 17 when security forces
massacred anti-government protesters.
   Officials had earlier said the trials would begin Monday, and
there was no explanation for the change.
   The genocide charge refers to victims of Ceausescu's 24-year
reign of terror as well as the thousands of Romanians killed by the
special Securitate police during the revolution.
   The charge of undermining the economy stems from the havoc
wreaked by Ceausescu's policy of exporting food and fuel to pay off
Romania's foreign debt of more than $10 billion between 1982 and
last year.
   Also Monday, the government announced an amnesty for crimes
committed before the revolution. However, it excluded former
Ceausescu functionaries, murderers, rapists and terrorists, the
term now applied to Securitate members.
   The issues of whether to ban the party and capital punishment
will be submitted to a popular referendum on Jan. 28. Capital
punishment was outlawed after the Ceaucescu executions.
   At a news conference Monday, government spokesman Dragos
Munteanu also defended Dimitri Mazilu, vice president of the
provisional government, against charges that he had once been
connected with the Securitate and should therefore be ousted,
Rompres said.
   Even if Mazilu was a Securitate officer at the beginning of the
Ceausescu regime, Munteanu said, ``for the last five years, he has
been an outstanding spokesman against Ceausescu's regime.''

   A January thaw was in the works today as mild, moist winds from
the Southwest ushered unusually warm temperatures into the East. A
new storm system neared the West Coast today, bringing rain to
Oregon and to northern and central California.
   Sunny skies in the Southeast were expected to spawn record
readings.
   Temperatures more consistent with late March will prevail in the
Northeast today. Highs today were expected to be from the low 30s
along the Canadian border to the low 50s in New York City.
   A cold front stretching from New Mexico to Wisconsin trailed the
warm air eastward. The National Weather Service expected the cooler
air to reach the mid-Atlantic states on Thursday. Gulf moisture
ahead of the front will bring increasing cloudiness Wednesday,
followed by showers Wednesday night and Thursday.
   A snow advisory was in effect for the Oregon Cascades. Six or
more inches of snow were expected in the northern mountains by
today. A foot or more of new snow was possible in the Sierra
Nevada's higher altitudes.
   South Dakota's Black Hills braced for 3 to 6 inches of new snow.
Arizona's White Mountains expected up to 6 inches of snow by today.
   Low pressure over Colorado will move eastward, spreading clouds
across much of the Midwest. Fog and drizzle could develop over
southern Iowa into Illinois and Missouri. There was a chance of
light snow over parts of Nebraska and South Dakota as temperatures
gradually cooled.
   New England expects cloudy and breezy weather Wednesday. Rain or
showers were forecast for Vermont, and a mix of freezing rain,
sleet and snow was anticipated for Maine and New Hampshire.
   Monday's hot spots were Laredo and Presidio, Tex., both with a
reading of 82.

<HEAD>Ex-President Duarte Given Last Rites</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Jose Napoleon
Duarte, who is suffering from terminal cancer, has received last
rites, his doctor said.
   Dr. Jose Luis Saca said Duarte was given last rites Monday. Saca
said Duarte, who also has pneumonia, was in ``very critical''
condition.
   Saca said Duarte, 64, was getting heavy doses of antibiotics and
being fed intravenously.
   Duarte survived an earlier bout of pneumonia in September, when
he was also given last rites.
   When his gastric cancer was diagnosed in May 1988, doctors said
he had about 16 months to live.
   Duarte, a founder of the centrist Christian Democratic Party,
handed over power in June to another freely elected president,
rightist Alfredo Cristiani. The transition was a first in El
Salvador, which has a history of coups, military dictatorships and
civil war.

<HEAD>Memorials But Also Violence on King Holiday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands marched and prayed and church bells rang on the
birthday of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., while
protesters demonstrated against states, schools and businesses not
observing the federal holiday.
   Three Ku Klux Klansmen handed out leaflets in New Hampshire,
fights broke out between blacks and whites in Louisiana and South
Carolina and racist graffiti was sprayed on signs on a California
highway named after King.
   King's survivors and others remembering him in services around
the nation said they harbored no illusions that his work was
finished.
   ``It's great that we celebrate his birthday but this day should
be a day where we recommit ourselves to finishing his dream,''
King's son, Martin Luther King 3rd, who was 10 when his father died
in 1968, told 500 people at a DePaul University church after
leading a candlelight march Monday night.
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, spoke in Atlanta at an annual
ecumenical service at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where her husband
delivered some of his most stirring orations.
   ``Now is the time to organize a global non-violent movement
based on Dr. King's teachings, to put an end to the scourges of
poverty, hunger, racism and bigotry, war and militarism,'' she said.
   Security for the service was heavy following recent racially
motivated mail bombings in the Southeast. Bomb-sniffing dogs
inspected the church beforehand; visitors were required for the
first time to pass through metal detectors, and police took up
posts throughout the church during the service.
   Security also was heavy for a March of Celebration held later in
downtown Atlanta. Police estimated 400,000 people watched.
   A former top King lieutenant, the Rev. Hosea Williams,
complained that the parade trivialized the day and wasted money
better spent on the poor. ``This has been prostituted more than any
other holiday except Jesus Christ's birthday,'' he said outside an
Atlanta housing project.
   About 25,000 people lined Los Angeles' streets for the fifth
annual King Birthday Celebration Parade down a boulevard named for
him, and 2,500 turned out for an annual breakfast in Boston. In
Memphis, Tenn., about 300 people gathered at The Lorraine Motel,
where King was assassinated on April 4, 1968.
   ``We didn't want the children to think that Martin Luther King's
birthday was just another day for watching television,'' said
Mardest Van Hooks, a Memphis teacher who helped bring a group of
youngsters to The Lorraine.
   The Washington-based Federal Holiday Commission said bells
chimed at 12:30 p.m. EST in all 50 states and 144 countries. The
Liberty Bell in Philadelphia was tapped three times. The New York
Stock Exchange paused for a moment at noon.
   The holiday, first celebrated in 1986, fell on King's actual
birthday for the first time.
   In New Hampshire, one of four states without any form of King
holiday, students at high schools in Concord, Milford, Merrimack
and Wolfeboro staged protest rallies.
   ``Martin Luther King wasn't just for black people. He changed
everything for everyone, not just black people,'' Merrimack Valley
High senior John Morin, who is white, told fellow students.
   In Arizona, where the King holiday has long been a bitter
controversy, a Phoenix crowd estimated at nearly 15,000 heard
lawmakers and community leaders at the Capitol urge them to vote in
a referendum this fall over whether to let a King Day observance
become law.
   A bill to make the day a holiday was introduced Monday in the
Idaho Senate. Montana also has no form of King Holiday, while some
other states keep workers on the job but mark the day in other ways.
   About 200 people protested outside a bank in Buffalo, N.Y., that
stayed open. Norman Eenith, 35, held an outstretched dollar bill
and said, ``This is what it's all about.''
   In New Orleans, following a parade in King's honor attended by
tens of thousands, two whites were arrested after a fight in which
a black man was hit with nail-studded boards, officials said.
   At Garrett High School in Charleston, S.C., one of several area
schools that canceled the day off to make up for days lost during
Hurricane Hugo, about five black students angry at having to attend
school on the holiday assaulted two white students, Principal Rex
Whitcomb said. Police helped restore order.
   In San Diego, two signs on 10-mile stretch of highway named for
King were painted with swastikas and the letters ``SWP,'' thought
to stand for ``Supreme White Power,'' police said.
   In Florida, a county commissioner said he received numerous
telephone threats after he protested a newspaper advertisement
depicting King, a birthday cake and a garbage truck. The ad said
trash would be picked up as usual Monday.
   ``All of a sudden I recognized that I felt a particular fear
that as a young white man, fairly protected growing up, I had never
felt before _ what so many people in this group must have felt,''
Yordon said.

<HEAD>Thousands Protest in Mongolian Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Mongolians rallied for reform in the
third street demonstration in their Communist country's capital in
the past month, a foreign source said today.
   The source said the demonstrators, led by the newly formed
Mongolian Democratic Union, criticized former leader Yumjaagiyn
Tsedenbal and Mongolia's Communist Party Politiburo.
   The protesters, who numbered up to 5,000, were peaceful and
``good-humored'' and police made no attempt to interfere, the
source said. The temperature was about 4 degrees below zero during
the gathering Sunday on the steps of a movie theater in Ulan Bator.
   The Democratic Union, a group thought to be made up of
reform-minded intellectuals and artists, also led open-air rallies
on two Sundays in December. Those demonstrations drew far fewer
people, with crowds estimated at several hundred to 1,000.
   The group reportedly has adopted a draft charter and petitioned
the nation's parliament for official status.
   The source said demonstrators at today's protest carried banners
calling for Tsedenbal to be put on trial and urging a faster pace
of perestroika, or reforms like those championed by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Tsedenbal, purged in 1984 after more than three decades in
power, has been criticized by the current government for his forced
collectivization policies and his ``bureaucratic centralism.''
   Mongolia, a nation of 2 million people spread across the vast
deserts and grasslands of eastern Asia, has cautiously followed the
reform policies taken by its protector state, the Soviet Union.
   However, the government has said the pace of reform has been too
slow, and members of Parliament have called for fundamental changes
in price and wage systems in the state-controlled economy.
   The source said it was not clear whether political upheaval in
East Europe was influencing events in distant Mongolia and it was
probably ``wrong to rush toward expectations'' of dramatic changes
in the country.
   Other sources agreed that while the momentum for reform was
picking up, advocates of change appeared willing to work within the
system and not directly confront the ruling party.
   The government had no official reaction to the protest.

<TEXT>
   The leader of Albania accused the Western
news media of concocting false reports of unrest in his country and
rejected the democratic reform gripping the rest of Eastern Europe.
   Communist Party chief Ramiz Alia said in a speech Monday to
factory workers in Tirana, the Albanian capital, that the reports
of upheaval were ``lies and falsity.'' His remarks were distributed
by the official news agency ATA.
   ``Recently, in continuation of the events that occurred in the
countries of the East, the fantasy regarding Albania has been
diversified. Such a fantasy is reflected in some organs of the
Western press,'' Alia said.
   The tide of reform elsewhere in Eastern Europe has left Albania
as Europe's last bastion of Stalinism.
   Referring to a report by the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug that
special measures in Albania resembled a state of emergency, Alia
told the workers:
   ``With such filthy things does the Yugoslav news agency nourish
world public opinion.''
   ``We say ... that (a) state of emergency, demonstrations, unrest
and killings are found nowhere in Albania.''
   Accounts in the Western media have told of gunfire and possibly
deaths in some Albanian cities.
   Foto Cami, a member of the ruling party Politburo, said on state
radio and television Friday the reports of unrest were ``slanders''
and ``anti-Albanian inventions.''
   On Saturday, ATA quoted a man it identified as Paolo de Nicola,
an Italian diplomat, as calling the reports ``groundless.''
   Alia said Monday: ``We are sure ... the anti-Albanian campaign
... will end like a soap bubble, because it is based completely on
lies and falsity.
   ``Our people have chosen their own way of development and only
they and no one else know and decide on what should be done and
what steps should be taken, what changes are demanded by time and
the process of socialist development and how'' they should be
achieved.
   Albania is an isolated country of 3 million million people.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Blast Industrial Use of Ozone Killers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental group today criticized the
continued reliance by industry on three widely used
ozone-destroying chemicals, saying that while some companies are
cutting back on their use others are relying on them even more.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council produced industry figures
showing more than 200 million pounds of the chemicals were released
into the atmosphere by more than 3,000 companies in 1987, the last
year for which complete figures were available.
   Partial figures for 1988 show continued heavy use of the
chemicals with ``the vast majority of companies ... yet to take any
concrete steps to phase them out,'' said David Doniger, a lawyer
for the NRDC. ``Their delays threaten the health and safety of all
Americans.''
   The subject of the NRDC study are two chemicals widely used as
metal-cleaning solvents _ methyl chloroform and CFC113 _ in the
aerospace, computer and electronics industries. The third chemical
is carbon tetrachloride, which is primarily used in the United
States for manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs.
   The three chemicals are among those that when released can drift
high into the atmosphere where the chlorine component reacts with
the Earth's protective ozone layer, causing destruction of the
ozone. The three chemicals currently account for 37 percent of the
chlorine attacking the atmospheric ozone layer, the NRDC said.
   The government and industry have acknowleged that the CFCs,
including CFC113 used as a solvent and carbon tetrachloride should
be phased out. International treaty calls for a phaseout of CFCs
and as that occurs the use of carbon tetrachloride also will
decline.
   But methyl chloroform, whose potency for ozone destruction is
less than 15 percent that of CFCs, remains unregulated and is
viewed by much of industry as a potential ``bridge'' chemical as
companies stop using CFCs as a cleaning solvent.
   ``It's needed for the orderly phaseout of CFCs,'' maintained
Carol Niemi, an environmental specialist at Dow Chemical Co., which
makes about half of the methyl chloroform produced today.
   Nevertheless, she said in a telephone interview, industry
studies indicate that use of methyl chloroform, although likely to
increase in the next few years, is expected to decline over the
next decade.
   Environmentalists argue that industry reliance on any of the
three ozone-damaging chemicals should be reduced more quickly.
   ``Decisions made in the boardrooms of these companies (using the
chemicals) will determine whether we succeed or fail in preventing
the first truly global environmental catastrophe,'' said the NRDC's
Doniger.
   Using 1987 industry figures provided to the Environmental
Protection Agency and 1988 information gathered from a scattering
of companies through an NRDC questionnaire, the environmental group
sought to determine to what extent companies are continuing to use
the chemicals.
   Comparisons could be made based only on a relatively small
number of companies because many of the 3,014 plans that reported
1987 releases to the EPA did not respond to the NRDC questionaire.
   According to the comparison, however, 194 companies increased
their use of the chemicals between 1987 and 1988, although in some
cases companies appeared to be substituting methyl chloroform for
the more environmentally damaging CFC113s.
   However, according to the NRDC figures, 223 companies reported a
declining use of the chemicals, including some cases in which the
cut in emissions was substantial.
   In the case of methyl chloride, Pratt &amp; Whitney, the Connecticut
aircraft engine manufacturer that was the biggest user of the
chemical in 1987 with 1.9 million pounds, reported emissions of
only 421,000 pounds in 1988.
   The NRDC said 112 companies reported methyl chloroform emission
increases of 2,000 pounds or more in 1988, while 144 companies
reported emission reductions; 15 companies reported having stopped
using methyl chloroform, and two other sources said they were
committed to specific phaseout dates.
   Although CFC113 is one of the chemicals whose use is expected to
be discontinued, 75 companies reported emission increases from 1987
to 1988, while 76 reported emissions decreases and five companies
reported having stopped using the chemical.
   Seven companies reported increaes in carbon tetrachloride
emissions between 1987 and 1988, while 12 companies reported
emission decreases. Hercules Inc., the No. 1 user of the chemical
in 1987, reported it had stopped using it last August, the NRDC
said.

   There was something revealing the other day in
President Bush's display of ire on television about television.
   He complained that television misleadingly had caused him to
appear callously indifferent to the fate of the U.S. servicemen he
had sent to Panama.
   He had held a news conference on Dec. 21, the day after the
invasion. All was going well; Congress and public opinion were
rallying behind him, and, a day after dispatching troops, he felt
able to announce, ``This operation is not over, but it's pretty
well wrapped up.''
   He was upbeat, laughing, engaging in banter with reporters.
   ``Please, Sarah, lighten up,'' he told one reporter. And to
another, who asked why the government had put a $1 million bounty
on the head of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega: ``His picture will be
in every post office in town.''
   What Bush did not know was that while he was making ``my
frivolous remarks'' _ his words for it _ some of the networks had
gone to a split-screen technique to report simultaneously on the
arrival at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware of the bodies of the
first four U.S. servicemen killed in Panama.
   So while Bush joshed, the viewers saw conflicting images: a
happy-go-lucky president in one corner of the screen and
flag-draped coffins in another.
   ``I could understand why the viewers were concerned about
this,'' Bush said at his next news conference. ``They thought their
president at a solemn moment like that didn't give a damn.''
   Bush said if the networks would tell him the next time he was
competing against a compelling news story he would gladly step
aside and let the other story have the entire screen.
   The networks which had carried the split-screen stories
disagreed over whether they had mistreated the president.
   CBS and CNN said they were doing no more than covering the news
as the news occurred. NBC chose not to go with the split-screen
picture. ABC carried it, but anchorman Peter Jennings apologized,
saying the president could not have known of the simultaneous
broadcast and the pictures from Delaware could have waited.
   But the networks rejected Bush's request that they inform him in
advance of what they will do in a similar situation. To do
otherwise would have surrendered their editorial freedom and made
them part of the White House's press apparatus.
   This sort of thing wouldn't have happened on Michael Deaver's
watch, old-timers murmured. Deaver was the presidential aide who
devoted much of his adult lifetime to protecting Ronald Reagan's
image. No detail was too small when it came to policing what kind
of impression Reagan would make.
   Deaver would have known that the bodies were arriving. Perhaps
there would have been a quick trip to Dover, a presidential salute,
a solemn sentence or two. In any event, no joking president on
television.
   The Bush White House is image-conscious _ witness the
president's anguished cry _ but not as dedicated to image control.
   Television people, who know when they are being manipulated even
if they can't do much about it, like to believe that television, if
it watches long enough, ultimately and invariably captures
someone's true character. You can't fool the cameras long enough _
that's their fervid belief.
   ``Television made Joe McCarthy and television destroyed him,''
says Sig Mickelson, former president of CBS News, now teaching at
San Diego State University in California.
   ``If a person is on TV long enough, the truth about him will
out,'' says Lawrence Lichty, a longtime student of television and
chairman of Northwestern University's Department of Radio,
Television and Film.
   The Bush who America has come to know on television in the first
year of his presidency is closer to the genuine article than Roger
Ailes' made-for-TV Bush who got elected _ that two-fisted,
tabasco-spiced, pork rind-eating flag-saluter who ran for the
office.
   If occasional giddiness is part of the picture, that's Bush too,
and, according to the Lichty theory, he's bound to show it.

   A funny thing happened to ``Annie 2'' on its way
to Broadway. It will become a revival of the original ``Annie.''
   The $7 million sequel to the 1977 musical hit about the world's
most famous orphan closes Saturday in Washington and will not open
in New York as scheduled on March 1, said David Powers, a spokesman
for the show.
   Instead, director Martin Charnin plans to use much of the same
cast, as well as its scenery and costumes, for the revival, Powers
said Monday.
   The revival is expected to reach Broadway later in the season,
he added. A date and theater have not yet been announced.
   It could be an easy transformation _ if it happens.
   The stars of ``Annie 2,'' Dorothy Loudon as Miss Hannigan and
Harve Presnell as Daddy Warbucks, have played in various
productions of the originial, including on Broadway where Loudon
won a Tony Award. Eleven-year-old Danielle Findley, who plays the
title character in ``Annie 2,'' has also played the original in
other cities.
   ``Annie 2,'' which has a score by Charnin and Charles Strouse
and a book by Thomas Meehan, is far from dead, Powers said.
   The sequel will be done this summer at the Goodspeed Opera House
in East Haddam, Conn., where the original ``Annie'' started in
1976, and possibly come to New York next fall, Powers said.
   Critics in Washington lambasted ``Annie 2'' after its Jan. 4
opening at the Kennedy Center's Opera House.
   ```Annie' was a musical to take to your heart,'' wrote David
Richards in The Washington Post, ``but you'll want to take a paddle
to `Annie 2.''' He called the book ``preposterous'' and the score
``dull.''
   Revisions were started immediately by Charnin. He cut the book
and musical numbers for the show, which ran three hours and 20
minutes during its first preview. Many theatergoers complained that
there weren't enough orphans in the show, and five little girls
were added to the cast.
   Mike Nichols, Larry Gelbart and Tommy Tune, all of them
experienced show doctors, reportedly were asked to come to
Washington to look at the troubled show.
   The plot for ``Annie 2,'' which takes place six weeks after the
ending of the first show, revolves around Daddy Warbucks' search
for a wife. Miss Hannigan wants the job _ to get revenge on Annie.
   The original ``Annie,'' also written by Charnin, Strouse and
Meehan, almost died at the Goodspeed Opera House in 1976. But
Charnin brought in Nichols, who signed on as a producer, and helped
him revise the show. With Andrea McArdle replacing Kristen Vigard
as Annie and Loudon added as Miss Hannigan, the production went on
to open in New York in April 1977, winning the Tony as best musical
and running for 2,377 performances.

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Foreman, who had a big
waistline and an even bigger punch, needed less than five minutes
to knock out Gerry Cooney and end Cooney's comeback bid in the
match dubbed the ``Geezers at Caesars.''
   ``I'm what you call a super-duper big-match heavyweight,'' said
the 41-year-old, 253\-pound Foreman after Monday night's fight,
sponsored by Caesars hotel and casino.
   Foreman quickly finished off Cooney, 33, smashing him to the
floor twice and knocking him out at 1:57 in the second round. The
referee didn't bother to count after the second knockdown.
   Foreman, who held the heavyweight title in 1973-74, now wants to
take on the unbeaten 23-year-old Mike Tyson for the championship.
It was Foreman's 20th straight victory since beginning a comeback
in 1987 from a 10-year retirement.
   ``I will probably knock him (Tyson) out a lot faster because he
won't back up,'' Foreman said.
   Cooney said he would retire. ``No more fighting,'' he said.
``There's not going to be any more comebacks for me.''
   The 231-pound Cooney was a leading heavyweight in the 1980s but
fought only 31 rounds in the decade. Foreman turned to evangelism
and founded a church after he retired in 1977.
   Both fighters were guaranteed $1 million.

   Space shuttle Columbia's five crew
members labored quietly today on their experiments, growing protein
crystals in zero gravity, melting and resolidifying a metal and
photographing the Earth.
   ``All systems aboard Columbia are clean,'' Mission Control
reported as the astronauts worked through the seventh full day of
their marathon 10-day mission.
   There was little radio traffic between ground and space ``to
allow the crew to stay on the timeline and get all their various
chores accomplished without a lot of interference from the folks
here,'' the control center said.
   ``We just let them go at it, and they've been doing very well.''
   Television from the shuttle showed the astronauts busily
pursuing the several experiments.
   There were no further problems with a navigation system that
sounded an alarm and wakened the crew Sunday night, and commander
Dan Brandenstein stopped a dehumidifier leak that had been a bother
almost from the beginning of the flight.
   Engineers did not have an explanation for the five sensor
signals that triggered the alarm, but some theorized they may have
been associated with electronics that feed a speed-measuring
accelerometer and not with the navigation unit itself.
   Brandenstein plugged the leak by stuffing a towel in a plastic
bag and wrapping it around the pipe that was its source.
   The astronauts were so busy with their experiments Monday that
they went to bed more than two hours late. So Mission Control let
them sleep an extra half hour today.
   But it told them in the package of messages and instructions
faxed up this morning: ``Your request for overtime has been
disapproved.''
   One of the crews' first chores was to dump excess water
overboard through a valve. A TV picture showed the expelled water
turning to ice crystals as it hit the cold atmosphere of space. As
Columbia passed into daylight, the sun brilliantly illuminated the
crystal shower.
   ``Quite a show, isn't it?'' Brandenstein remarked.
   ``You bet,'' replied Mission Control communicator Tammy Jernigan.
   Mission specialists Bonnie Dunbar, Marsha Ivins and David Low
were busy monitoring an experiment in which the metal indium was
being melted and resolidified to determine if space-processed
materials can have industrial applications.
   They also were growing protein crystals in a continuing series
of shuttle experiments that could lead to the weightless processing
of new, purer drugs to be used to fight cancer, AIDs, high blood
pressure, arthritis and other diseases.
   Medical experiments were aimed at learning how well the human
body adapts to weightlessness.
   Brandenstein and pilot Jim Wetherbee, when not minding the ship,
were busy photographing Earth features for a documentary film on
how man and nature are damaging the planet.
   Among the targets were large fires in Kenya and Madagascar and
deforestation in Brazil and Haiti.
   The astronauts accomplished their main goals during the first
four days of the mission. They deployed a Navy communications
satellite and retrieved an 11-ton science laboratory that they will
bring back to Earth so scientists can learn how scores of different
materials and systems survived six years in orbit.
   Columbia is to land in the darkness at 2:59 a.m. PST on Friday
at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.

<TEXT>
   President Bush has declared seven
Florida counties major disaster areas because of crop damage from a
pre-Christmas freeze, opening the door to loans and other relief
for field hands and farm owners.
   ``Obviously I am very pleased with the president's speedy
response to Florida's request for help,'' Gov. Bob Martinez said.
   The disaster declaration Monday makes farmworkers in Broward,
Collier, Dade, Hendry, Lee, Monroe and Palm Beach counties eligible
for federal unemployment compensation for 26 weeks. Farm owners
will be eligible for low-interest loans supported by the Farmers
Home Administration.
   The freeze struck Dec. 23, with portions of upper Florida
getting snow for the first time in years.
   The area in the declaration is most of southern Florida, mostly
a vegetable growing area. Martinez said he would ask for similar
help for citrus areas in central and northern Florida once the
extent of damage there has been documented.
   Martinez had asked Bush four days earlier for an estimated $34.4
million in disaster unemployment assistance to supplement some
$4.79 million in state aid.

   Gen. Colin Powell, the top U.S. military
leader, today welcomed initial steps by the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
to reshape its armed forces and said the level of U.S. forces in
Western Europe could be changed.
   Powell, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, made his
comments before top brass from the Soviet Union and 33 other
countries in an unusual exchange of views on their governments'
military policies.
   ``There is nothing sacrosanct about the number of American
troops stationed in Europe,'' he said. ``There is nothing carved in
stone that says that military power in a divided Europe should
remain as it has over the last four decades.
   ``We are hopeful that the process in which we are all engaged
will lead to the day when the military demands on both European
alliances are greatly diminished,'' he said.
   Foreign Minister Alois Mock of Austria opened the unprecedented
meeting, which is designed to further reduce military tensions in
Europe.
   The military doctrine seminar, scheduled in October, attracted
greater attention following the wave of democratic reform that
swept Eastern Europe.
   Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, the Soviet military chief of staff, also
was scheduled to speak.
   The three-week session marks the first time top military
officers of the NATO and the Warsaw Pact, plus the neutral and
non-aligned states of Europe, are sitting down to discuss their
intentions, plans and arsenals, U.S. officials say.
   The discussions are being held under the auspices of the
negotiations on Confidence- and Security-Building Measures.
   Western military experts are anxious to hear just what the
emerging democracies in the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact have in mind for
their defense policies.
   John Maresca, who leads the U.S. delegation to the
confidence-building talks, said officials want ``to understand
better what these Eastern European countries are thinking at this
time, how their policies are going to evolve.''
   Czechoslovakia and Hungary already have said they want Soviet
troops off their soil this year. In East Germany, Communist Party
leader Gregor Gysi has proposed that all foreign troops leave both
Germanys by 1999.
   ``There is a greater willingness of countries in Eastern Europe
to take positions on the basis of what they see as their national
interest, rather than just following a position which is dictated
to them by the Soviet Union,'' Maresca told a news conference
Monday.
   Western analysts also are eager to hear what Moiseyev has to say
about the Soviet Union's military stance.
   In December 1988, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced
plans to pare his government's defense spending and military
forces, including the pullout of 50,000 of the estimated 550,000
troops from Eastern Europe.
   Moscow has said it is adopting a more defensive military
doctrine. ``We would like to understand better what that means,''
said Maresca.
   Western analysts seek hard evidence of lower spending, fewer
troops and reduced arms production.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the 16-nation Western
alliance, maintains its forces are the minimum needed to defend
against an attack.
   During the seminar, the military officers were expected to
present their views, then respond to questions. The give-and-take
is designed to fill in any gaps or clear up any confusion.
   In addition, the officers will have a chance to meet privately
for further questioning.
   The idea behind the meeting is to lessen the secrecy that
surrounds military policies. The overall confidence-building
negotiations are aimed at finding ways to increase trust among the
countries and therefore reduce tensions in Europe.
   Maresca emphasized that the seminar is an experiment. No report
will be made at the end.
   John Cross, deputy director of the International Institute for
Strategic Studies in London, said, ``It cannot but be for the good
for the senior military officers and thinkers of both sides to be
talking to one another.''

   Thousands of Moslems in Soviet Azerbaijan
staged a peaceful protest on the Iranian border to demand closed
links with their kin in Iran, Tehran radio reported today.
   The demonstration constrasted with the ethnic violence inside
the Soviet republic, where Moscow declared a state of emergency
Monday to try to stop the fighting between Azerbaijanis and ethnic
Armenians.
   The Tehran radio broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said 5,000
Soviet Moslems gathered in below-freezing temperatures Monday along
the Araks river, which forms part of the border, to call for free
travel to Iran.
   Shiite Moslems in the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan share a
common culture, language and religion with their brethren across
the border and have staged several protests in recent days.
   Earlier this month, thousands of Soviet Moslems went on a
three-day rampage and tore down frontier posts, watchtowers and
communication lines. They demanded reunification of the Soviet and
Iranian Azerbaijans.
   Impatient with official statements that travel restrictions
between the countries will be eased, many Soviet Moslems have
jumped into the cold waters of the Araks and swum to the Iranian
side for short visits.
   Tehran radio earlier reported that 30 people swam across on
Sunday.
   This week's peaceful border protests contrasted sharply with
scenes inside Soviet Azerbaijan, where militant Azerbaijanis
clashed with ethnic Armenians over who should govern the disputed
territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. The enclave is a part of Azerbaijan
but its residents mainly are Armenian.
   Moscow on Monday sent in army units and KGB officers to protect
residents from widespread fighting. Soviet media reports said
hundreds of Azerbaijanis and Armenians have been battling with
submachine guns, helicopters and armored vehicles.
   The violence in Azerbaijan has heightened Soviet fears of Moslem
unrest along its southern border with Iran.
   Tehran has said it welcomes free travel for Soviet Moslems to
Iran, as well as more trade and cultural ties across the border.
   Azerbaijan, once wholly under Iranian control, was ceded to
Russia in 1828.
   In 1946, the Red Army entered northern Iran and set up a puppet
republic with the aim of controlling all of Azerbaijan. But the
Soviets withdrew in 1946 following an international outcry.

   A human rights group is accusing the
Interior Ministry of using torture against Moslem fundamentalists
under the leadership of a man who has just been fired by President
Hosni Mubarak.
   The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights on Mondayyy alleged a
rapid rise in torture last year, mainly of the fundamentalists. It
said trend has been evident since mid-1987.
   That was little more than a year after dismissed Interior
Minister Zaki Badr took control of domestic security.
   It also was when a court acquitted 41 security men of torturing
suspects while investigating a coup attempt that closelyy followed
the assassination of Mubarak's predecessor, Anwar Sadat. His death
was blamed on fundamentalists.
   While denying the torture charges Monday, new Interior Minister
Abdel-Halim Moussa continued making appearances to mend fences
shattered by Badr's quick tongue.
   It was Badr's rhetoric, rather than his raids on Moslem
fundamentalists, that appeared to prompt the announcement of his
dismissal Friday.
   In a recent speech, Badr said all Moslem fundamentalists, who
make up about 1 percent of Egypt's population of 55 million, should
be killed.
   He also savaged a variety of politicians, journalists and other
public figures, even his Cabinet colleagues.
   In its report Monday, the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights
said at least one prisoner died last year under police torture.
Many others suffered temporary or permanent physical damage, the
report said.
   ``Torture was practiced on a large scale following almost all
the waves of mass and individual arrests and detentions, with
severe beating, slaps, punches, kicks, rifle butts, leather belts,
hosepipe, bamboo sticks and electric batons. In some cases, the
whip was brought back into use to beat and torture detainees,'' the
report said.
   It said that in addition to religious activists, victims of
torture included labor leaders and prominent leftists.
   In comments quoted by the Middle East News Agency, the new
interior minister responded, ``These claims are absolutely
baseless, because prisons in Egypt have their regulations, and the
prosecutors and the judiciary have the right to inspect them.''
   However, Moussa, who has a reputation for concilation, has tried
to assure Egyptians that he's different from Badr.
   In a speech Sunday, he said religious militancy is a social
problem rather than one of law enforcement provided extremists do
not break the law.
   ``Police are at the service of the people and not to insult
them,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts' attorney general is investigating
allegations that police intimidated two teen-agers into falsely
linking a black man to the shooting of Charles and Carol Stuart.
   Attorney General James M. Shannon also said Monday his office
will take a second look at allegations that Boston police were
stopping and searching young blacks and Hispanics without
sufficient cause.
   ``They are separate issues. I think it's a mistake to let these
issues run into one another,'' Shannon said. ``I don't think anyone
should be prejudged here. That was the big mistake in the Stuart
story.''
   The Stuarts were shot Oct. 23. Charles Stuart, who directed
police over his car phone to his dying wife, said a black man
robbed and shot them after they left a birthing clinic. Mrs.
Stuart, seven months pregnant, died hours later. Their son,
delivered by Caesarean section, died 17 days later. Stuart was
seriously wounded.
   William Bennett, a black man with a police record, was
identified in the news media as the prime suspect. He was cleared
after Stuart was implicated in the shooting by a younger brother
and then apparently jumped to his death from a bridge.
   Two teen-agers have said since that they were intimidated by
police into incriminating Bennett.
   Dereck Jackson, 17, told reporters Friday he was forced to tell
police that Bennett confessed to the Stuart shooting in his
presense.
   Eric Whitney, 18, said in a newspaper report that police
supplied him with undisclosed details of the shooting and pressured
him to recount them to another detective.
   Both said they testified falsely to a grand jury but returned
later and recanted.
   ``On the allegations about intimidation of witnesses, I'm going
to ask my civil rights division to contact the lawyers in that case
and see whether they have something they want to tell us,'' Shannon
said.
   ``They haven't come to us yet, but we're not going to let it lie
there.''
   In September, a Superior Court judge ruled that police had
instituted an unconstitutional policy and asked Shannon to do
whatever was necessary to ``restrain further unreasonable searches
and seizures'' by police.
   One month later, Shannon said that after talking with Boston
police, he was convinced there was no search-on-sight policy.

<HEAD>Both Business Inventories and Sales Rose in November</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business inventories rose rose 0.5 percent in
November but business sales rebounded by a brisker 0.7 percent, the
government said today.
   Faster growth of sales than accumulation of goods on shelves and
backlots is good news for the economy. If inventories were to pile
up excessively, it could mean cutbacks in production and a loss of
jobs.
   However, some industries such as automobiles already are feeling
the effects of excessive inventories.
   Chrysler Corp., Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. all have
announced temporary layoffs to reduce the number of vehicles stuck
on backlots. Mazda Motor Corp. of Japan is trimming production at
its U.S. plant later this month.
   The Commerce Department said inventories climbed to a seasonally
adjusted $796.8 billion in November after rising 0.3 percent a
month earlier. That was a bit better than the 0.4 percent increase
originally reported.
   Business sales also rose, to a seasonally adjusted $523.6
billion, after falling a revised 0.5 percent in October. That
revision showed a slight improvement over the 0.7 percent drop
originally reported.
   The result in November business activity produced a slight
decline, to 1.52, in the ratio of inventories to sales. That means
it would take 1.52 months to exhaust inventories at the November
pace. The ratio was 1.53 in October.
   Inventories often rise during periods of slow economic growth as
output exceeds demand. The economy has been experiencing
sluggishness over the past year as the Federal Reserve keeps a
tight rein on credit to slow inflation.
   But many economists do not feel the ratio is at a dangerous
level yet.
   Retail backlogs rose 0.6 percent in November, while retail sales
climbed 0.5 percent. But the Commerce Department reported last week
that sales gained only 0.2 percent in December, reflecting a modest
holiday buying season.
   Inventories at the manufacturing level, which represent about 45
percent of the total, rose 0.3 percent. Manufacturing sales, on the
other hand, increased 0.5 percent.
   Wholesalers' inventories advanced 0.5 percent, while their sales
jumped 1.2 percent.
   Overall, inventories were 6.8 percent above those of a year ago,
while sales increased 4.4 percent.

<TEXT>
   The still powerful Communist Party began
talks today with an opposition coalition demanding more democracy,
but the two sides immediately stalled over opposition demands for
offices and its own newspaper.
   The disarray, played out for an hour in front of reporters,
illustrated the difficulties of trying to move from totalitarian
rule to more democracy without basic tools for the transition.
   The talks come a day after Parliament voted unanimously to
repeal the Communist Party's guaranteed leading role, making
Bulgaria the last Warsaw Pact country to formally overturn the
status that shored up Stalinist structures in Eastern Europe for
more than 40 years.
   The Union of Democratic Forces, the coalition of Bulgaria's
still weak and divided democratic opposition, has been pushing
since November for its own daily newspapers and for offices. It
angrily accused the Communists of stalling on both demands.
   ``For many years, we know what it means when we don't get an
answer,'' said Petko Simeonov, a coalition leader. ``Our slogans
and our ideas do not reach everybody. We want what we have to say
to be heard by everybody.''
   Without an office, Simeonov said the coalition has no venue to
coordinate positions in broad talks on the country's future. ``The
conditions are unfavorable, as if on purpose,'' he said.
   Andrey Lukanov, the No. 2 Communist Party official, said the
ruling party had done all it could to get authorities to provide
offices and newsprint, but matters were no longer in their hands.
   ``I don't think you should be so suspicious,'' he smiled to the
opposition, seated across from the Communists and their allies the
Agrarian Party in a brightly lit hall of Bulgaria's National
Assembly, or parliament, building.
   Eventually, the two sides agreed to discuss the issue behind
closed doors, with the opposition threatening to withdraw from the
talks if the quarrel was not settled.
   The broad talks are supposed to discuss the transition to
democracy and the free elections promised by May.
   Hindered by ethnic conflict and the remaining power of orthodox
Communists in the provinces, change is coming slowly to Bulgaria,
where hard-line Communist Todor Zhivkov was ousted Nov. 10 after
more than 35 years in power.
   The opposition won another victory Monday _ a promise that
Communist cells will be removed from Bulgaria's police, making it
politically neutral, said Petar Beron, an opposition spokesman.
   The opposition backed its demands with a rally of more than
50,000 people on Sunday, the biggest to date in Sofia.
   Loudly applauded demands there included the calls for the
resignation of Communist Premier Georgi Atanassov, a holdover from
the Zhivkov era, and adoption of two-tiered legislative elections
in May and November to give the opposition a chance to organize
against the still powerful Communists.
   Opposition forces see the promised elections as a tactic by the
Communists to preserve much of their power while the opposition is
still untested and weak.
   In other business Monday, Parliament approved a compromise
reached last week to smooth the friction between the country's 1.5
million Moslems, mostly ethnic Turks, and the Slavic majority over
last month's decision by the new leadership to restore their
Turkish names and customs.
   Five years ago, Zhivkov had forced the ethnic Turks to take
Slavic names.
   The compromise enforced the Dec. 29 decision _ which sparked
fierce protests across Bulgaria _ but insisted that Bulgarian is
the official language and affirmed Bulgaria's ``territorial
integrity.''
   Criticism of Zhivkov peaked during the debate on the sensitive
ethnic issue, with deputies condemning the former leader's hasty
move last year to allow an estimated 320,000 Turks to flee
labor-starved Bulgaria.
   Some 90,000 have now returned, unable to find work in Turkey and
promised a new, more equal life and the restoration of property
they abandoned by Bulgaria's new rulers.

<HEAD>Court to Consider Limiting Power of Environmentalists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said today it will consider
limiting the power of environmentalists to prevent the opening up
of federal lands to commercial development.
   The court voted to review a pro-enviromentalist ruling
challenged by the Bush administration.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last June that the
National Wildlife Federation may sue the Interior Department over
its plans to change the status of some 180 million acres of public
land in Western states and Alaska _ more than one-fourth of the
nation's public lands.
   The federation said it is suing to ``protect federal lands
against unwise or premature disposition and development,''
including millions of acres to be opened up to mining and mineral
leasing.
   The move to reclassify the land for development and other uses
was made by the Reagan administration in 1985, following a policy
instituted by then-Secretary James G. Watt in 1981.
   The wildlife federation said the Reagan administration violated
federal law by opening the land to development without following
procedures in the 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act.
   The appeals court said the federation has legal standing to sue
because affidavits show some of its 4.5 million members use some of
the land for recreation. The appeals court overruled a federal
judge who had thrown out the suit.
   The appeals court relied, for example, on a statement by
federation member Peggy K. Peterson, who said she uses land in the
South Pass-Green Mountain area of Wyoming.
   The Bush administration said the appeals court permitted a
wholesale challenge to the Interior Department's reclassification
based on a vague allegation it will jeopardize use of a tiny
portion of the land by wildlife federation members.
   The appeals court, in effect, has ordered a federal judge ``to
assume the role of a nationwide land-use czar'' and determine how
millions of acres may be used, Justice Department lawyers argued in
the appeal acted on today.
   Groups supporting the administration position are the Mountain
States Legal Foundation, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the
National Cattlemen's Association and the American Mining Congress.
   The case is Lujan vs. National Wildlife Federation, 89-640.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Let Eastern Machinists' Strike Spread to Commuter
Railroads</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let a
machinists union strike against Eastern Airlines spread to commuter
railroads.
   The court, without comment, left intact rulings barring sympathy
strikes against railroads in New York City, Philadelphia and their
suburbs.
   The machinists, who walked off the job last March 4 after
refusing to give more than $150 million in concessions sought by
Eastern, remain on strike. Pilots and flight attendants supported
the strike for eight months before ending their walk-out in
November.
   The machinists and unions sympathetic to the Eastern strike
sought to extend its impact by setting up picket lines at
facilities run by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority (SEPTA) in the Philadelphia area and by Amtrak, the Long
Island Railroad, Metro-North Commuter Railroad and NJ Transit Rail
in the New York City metropolitan area.
   The New York City-area railroads carry some 350,000 commuters
daily between New York City and its suburbs. The SEPTA trains
transport more than 90,000 commuters each day.
   Federal judges barred the secondary strikes, and the restraining
orders were upheld by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals and the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
   The appeals courts said collective bargaining agreements between
the railroads and their unions may be interpreted to prohibit such
sympathy strikes, at least until the labor dispute is submitted to
arbitration.
   Underlying the issue is a clash between two federal laws, the
Railway Labor Act and the Norris-La Guardia Act.
   The Norris-La Guardia Act limits the power of federal courts to
enjoin strikes while the Railway Labor Act sets up procedures, such
as arbitration, designed to forestall strikes against railroads.
   The justices in 1987 ruled that courts generally may not bar
railroad workers from extending a labor dispute to other railroads
not directly involved in the dispute.
   But the 2nd Circuit court said the 1987 ruling applies only in
cases in which other procedures to end a railway strike are
exhausted.
   The appeals court said the opposite was true in the Eastern case
because there had been no attempt through arbitration to end the
secondary strikes against the railroads.
   Since ``there was a risk of immediate and irreparable injury to
the railroads and the public,'' the 2nd Circuit court said, the
judge acted within his authority in halting the sympathy strikes.
   The 3rd Circuit court said SEPTA workers do not have the right
to violate no-strike provisions in their own collective bargaining
agreements by honoring picket lines set up by Eastern employees at
SEPTA facilities.
   Lawyers for the machinists union said the power of unions to
fight for fair treatment is weakened by a ban on sympathy strikes.
They also said the 2nd and 3rd Circuit court rulings conflict with
decisions by other federal appeals courts.
   There have been reports that the machinists want to use sympathy
strikes against the railroads to prompt President Bush or Congress
to take action in their walk-out against the airline.
   The cases are International Association of Machinists vs. Long
Island Railroad, 89-427 and 89-674, and Brotherhood of Railroad
Signalmen vs. SEPTA, 89-756.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Agrees To Decide Case on Tips to Police</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide what
authority police have to stop and question someone on the basis of
an anonymous tip that the person is involved in a crime.
   The justices said they will review an Alabama court ruling that
limited such police tactics.
   A state appeals court threw out Vanessa White's 1987 conviction
for possession of marijuana and cocaine, ruling that Montgomery
police had seized the drugs after unlawfully stopping her car.
   The appeals court said an anonymous tip police received about
Ms. White was not enough to justify an investigatory stop by police
_ and they therefore had violated her constitutional rights.
   The Constitution's Fourth Amendment bans unreasonable police
seizures and searches.
   Ms. White's two-year probationary sentence was thrown out along
with her conviction.
   The nation's highest court previously has ruled that police can
make arrests only when they have ``probable cause'' to believe
someone is involved in a crime.
   But the court has allowed police to make brief investigatory
stops _ to stop, question and even frisk someone _ if they have a
``reasonable suspicion,'' a more lenient standard than probable
cause.
   Federal appeals courts and state courts have been divided in
recent years when ruling whether an anonymous tip to police can
give rise to such a reasonable suspicion.
   In Ms. White's case, the Alabama appeals court based its
decision ``on an individualized evaluation of the particular tip in
light of the totality of the circumstances.''
   On April 22, 1987, Police Cpl. B.H. Davis received an anonymous
telephone call telling him that Ms. White would be leaving a
certain apartment at a particular time in a brown station wagon to
go to a motel. The caller said Ms. White would have with her about
an ounce of cocaine in a brown attache case.
   Police went to the apartment and kept it under surveillance.
They saw Ms. White leave in a brown station wagon and drive to a
motel. They then approached Ms. White and told her about the call
they had received.
   An officer asked for permission to search the station wagon, and
Ms. White said he could. A brown attache case was found inside, and
after Ms. White told officers the combination to its lock,
marijuana was found inside it.
   After Ms. White was arrested, police found three milligrams of
cocaine inside her purse.
   In throwing out Ms. White's conviction, the state appeals court
said, ``Because (she) was illegally detained when she gave her
consent to the search, the marijuana from the briefcase and the
cocaine from her purse are fruits of an unconstitutional
detention.''
   Such evidence should have been barred from her prosecution, the
appeals court said.
   It added, ``Here, the stop cannot be supported by specific and
articulable reliable facts raising a reasonable suspicion that (Ms.
White) was engaged in wrongdoing.''
   After the Alabama Supreme Court refused to review the case,
state Attorney General Don Siegelman filed the appeal acted on
today.
   The justices in 1980 and 1981 turned down requests to decide
whether an anonymous tip can justify an investigatory stop. Each
time, several justices voted to resolve the issue.
   The case is Alabama vs. White, 89-789.

<HEAD>TWA Flight Attendants Lose Sex Bias Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trans World Airlines flight attendants, who
accused TWA owner Carl Icahn of sex bias in seeking wage cuts and
other concessions that triggered a strike, lost a Supreme Court
appeal today.
   The court, without comment, refused to revive a lawsuit against
the airline. The flight attendants sought back pay and other
benefits.
   The Independent Federation of Flight Attendants called a strike
against TWA on March 7, 1986. Two months later, the union offered
to return to work and accept TWA's demands.
   About 200 strikers were rehired immediately, but more than three
years passed before the last of the 5,000 striking attendants were
offered jobs with TWA.
   The strike was called when Icahn insisted on wage and other
concessions for attendants _ 85 percent of them women _ that were
greater than cuts he sought to impose against the airline's pilots,
machinists and other workers.
   During the negotiations with the attendants union, Icahn said it
would be easy for him to find young, untrained women to be
stewardesses for less than he was paying the attendants.
   When union negotiators said janitors who belonged to the
machinists union were offered a better deal than the attendants,
Icahn remarked:
   ``A janitor is a breadwinner (who) probably has got a family at
home to support (while) you girls are second incomes and you don't
need the money.''
   The union said the statement demonstrated bias against women and
violated fair bargaining procedures mandated by the federal Railway
Labor Act, which governs labor negotiations for airlines and
railroads.
   The strike against TWA should be viewed by the courts as one
based on unfair labor practices and not only on demands for more
money, the union's lawyers said.
   Unlike workers who walk off the job over pay and benefits,
strikers who prove unfair labor practices by an employer are
entitled to their old jobs when they unconditionally return to work.
   U.S. District Judge Howard F. Sachs in Missouri rejected the
union's claims that Icahn was guilty of sexual stereotyping.
   Icahn's ``breadwinner'' remarks were ``foolish and offensive,''
Sachs said. But he said Icahn apparently was trying to rationalize
his negotiating strategy of demanding more cuts from the attendants.
   The judge said the real reason Icahn made a more generous offer
to the machinists was because that union could ``do greater damage
to TWA in a strike'' and because Icahn believed it would be easier
to replace the attendants with untrained workers.
   ``There has been no persuasive showing that sex stereotyping
governed or influenced Icahn's economic demands, only his
rationalizations,'' Sachs said.
   ``Greedy employers, like greedy unions, have a legal right to
try their strength and to enforce demands'' through the collective
bargaining process, the judge said.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judge's ruling
last June.
   The justices last year made it easier for workers to win suits
against employers accused of sexual stereotyping. But that decision
was based on a federal civil rights law banning workplace
discrimination, not the Railway Labor Act at issue in the case
acted on today.
   The case is Independent Federation of Flight Attendants vs. TWA,
89-783.

<HEAD>Court Action Blocks Refunds of Overcharges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today blocked indefinitely
the effect of a lower-court ruling that could have provided natural
gas consumers with tens of millions of dollars in refunds.
   The justices, granting an emergency request by 21 energy
companies, held in abeyance a decision by the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals that could have led to the refunds.
   Justice Byron R. White last week granted a temporary stay of the
appeals court ruling, and the court's order today extended that
stay until it acts on a formal appeal to be filed by the energy
companies.
   The New Orleans-based appeals court last Sept. 16 invalidated a
4-year-old federal regulation that allowed gas producers to raise
some prices.
   The appeals court ruled that the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission exceeded its authority in 1986 when permitting producers
of ``old'' gas to raise their prices and to stop selling to
pipeline companies not willing to pay the higher prices.
   Old gas is from wells that were producing before Nov. 9, 1978.
   Congress that year approved a partial decontrol of the natural
gas industry. Old-gas prices remained controlled, but no caps were
imposed on the price of gas from new wells.
   The commission's 1986 regulation, known as Order 451, allowed
the ceiling price of old gas to rise from 52 cents per thousand
cubic feet to $2.75.
   Consumers, distributors and pipeline companies challenged Order
451, leading to the 5th Circuit court ruling.
   In seeking emergency help, lawyers for the energy companies said
they would soon file a formal appeal seeking to overturn the
appeals court decision, which they said ``casts into doubt hundreds
of gas-supply contracts'' signed since 1986.
   The justices were told that if the September ruling takes effect
it will generate numerous contract disputes and ``introduce a
period of great uncertainty in the entire natural gas market _ all
during the winter heating season.''
   The case is Mobil Oil Exploration v. United Distribution
Companies, A-503.

Officials</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to kill
lawsuits against two Pennsylvania school officials by two former
students who say they were sexually assaulted by their high school
band instructor.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
officials are not entitled to qualified legal immunity from being
sued by Kathleen Stoneking and Judy Grove Sowers, former students
at Bradford Area High School.
   Both women allege they were were sexually assaulted by Edward
Wright, the high school's former band instructor. Both women were
band members.
   Wright was suspended in 1986, and later resigned. He pleaded
guilty to criminal charges, including indecent assault, that same
year and received a probationary sentence.
   Both cases were before the justices last year, and were sent
back to a federal appeals court for additional study.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last Aug. 16 and
Sept. 8 that the lawsuits against Frederick Smith, the high
school's principal, and Richard Miller, its assistant principal,
should go to trial.
   The appeals court dismissed Frederick Shuey, the now-retired
school district superintendent, as a defendant in both suits.
   Ms. Stoneking was graduated from high school in 1983. Her 1987
suit contends that the school officials failed to protect her.
   The suit alleges that beginning in her sophomore year, Wright
sexually harassed and abused her, and forced her to engage in
various sexual acts with him. The suit alleges that school
officials knew of complaints against Wright involving other female
students.
   Mrs. Sowers' suit alleges she was sexually assaulted by Wright
at his home in June 1979.
   In separate orders last March and April, the justices told the
3rd Circuit court to restudy the two cases in light of their
February 1989 decision that government officials have no
constitutional duty to protect citizens from private violence or
abuse.
   That decision shielded child welfare officials from being sued
for returning a young Wisconsin boy, Jason DeShaney, to the custody
of his father, who subsequently beat him so severely the boy is now
permanently brain-damaged.
   Ruling in Ms. Stoneking's case last August, the 3rd Circuit
court cited a major difference between it and the Wisconsin case:
``DeShaney's injuries resulted at the hands of a private actor (his
father) whereas Stoneking's resulted from the actions of a state
employee. Wright was a school district employee subject to
defendants' immediate control.''
   The appeals court cited its August ruling in Ms. Stoneking's
case when reinstating Mrs. Sowers' suit in September.
   The cases are Smith vs. Stoneking, 89-780, and Smith vs. Sowers,
89-782.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convicted killer facing death sentences in
Ohio, Illinois and Indiana for his murderous crime spree in 1984
lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The justices let stand Ohio court rulings that Alton Coleman
properly was convicted and sentenced to die for killing Tonnie
Storey, 15, in Cincinnati.
   Prosecutors said Coleman, from Waukegan, Ill., murdered eight
women and girls in three states during a seven-week summer killing
spree.
   Coleman, 34, and his traveling companion, Debra Brown, were
convicted in Cincinnati of killing Miss Storey, whose body was
found in an abandoned city apartment building, and Marlene Walters,
44, at her home in suburban Norwood.
   Miss Storey was strangled. Mrs. Walters was beaten to death.
   Coleman also was convicted and condemned for the kidnap and
murder of Vernita Wheat, 9, of Kenosha, Wis., and for killing
Tamika Turks, 7, of Gary, Ind.
   Court records submitted with Coleman's appeal said he also was
convicted in the deaths of Virginia Temple of Toledo, Ohio, and her
9-year-old daughter, Rachelle.
   The records did not identify the two other murder victims.
   Coleman, called by prosecutors a ``heartless killer,'' was
arrested in Evanston, Ill., on July 20, 1984.
   The appeal acted on today contended that Coleman was convicted
unfairly of Miss Storey's murder because the presiding judge
refused to move the trial despite ``pervasive and inflammatory''
pretrial publicity in Cincinnati.
   The appeal also argued that prosecutors should not have been
allowed to introduce ``massive amounts of sensational, prejudicial
and irrelevant evidence of other serious (then untried) criminal
acts.''
   The case is Coleman vs. Ohio, 89-6113.

<HEAD>Court to Study Missouri-Kansas Appeal on Gas Overcharges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
broadening the power of states to sue in behalf of gas consumers
allegedly overcharged by utility companies.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Kansas and Missouri
officials who have accused utilities of illegal price-fixing.
   The appeal was supported by 32 other states seeking to protect
their consumers and vigorously enforce antitrust laws.
   Asked for its views, the Bush administration urged the court to
review the issue, saying lower courts have reached conflicting
conclusions.
   Kansas and Missouri officials sued the Kansas Power &amp; Light Co.
and Utilicorp United Inc. over natural gas transported by pipeline
from Wyoming and used to generate electricity sold to customers in
the two states.
   Some of the natural gas delivered from Wyoming was sold to the
utilities' customers.
   The states alleged that gas-producing companies conspired to
inflate the price of the gas, and that the utilities passed on the
higher rates to consumers.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in January 1989
that the states do not have the authority to sue in behalf of
residential customers.
   The appeals court said that only direct purchasers of fixed
amounts of gas may sue in such cases.
   ``Any allocation of illegal overcharges to the residential
consumers may require tracing the sale from the wellhead through
each level of distribution to establish the amount of illegal gas
costs actually paid ... adding new dimensions of complexity to
antitrust suits,'' the appeals court said.
   ``Residential indirect purchaseers of natural gas are not
entitled to sue the alleged violators,'' the appeals court said.
   Kansas and Missouri officials said the ruling conflicts with
that of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which permitted such
suits. The states urged the Supreme Court to resolve the conflict.
   The 10th Circuit court has jurisdiction over lawsuits in
Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma.
   The states that supported the Kansas-Missouri appeal are Alaska,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and
Wisconsin.
   The case is Kansas vs. Kansas Power &amp; Light, 88-2109.

<HEAD>Court Won't Review New Jersey Law on Discount Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that a state may ban pharmacists from selling prescription drugs at
a discount.
   The court, without comment, rejected a challenge to a New Jersey
law banning drug discounts and rebates except for medications sold
to people over 62.
   The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled last August that the law,
attacked as a form of economic protectionism, has rational purposes
and therefore is constitutional.
   Restricting prescription discounts ``prevents potentially
destructive price wars that could erode the integrity of
pharmaceutical services,'' the state court said.
   The state court also ruled that it is reasonable to discourage
people from shopping around at different drug stores for the best
buy, saying that could undermine the use of so-called drug profiles.
   The profiles are kept on file by some pharmacists to check for
possible allergic reactions or use of incompatible prescription
drugs by customers.
   ``Even if a court cannot ascertain the actual purpose of the
statute, it should sustain the statute if it has any conceivable
rational purpose,'' the state court said.
   The law was challenged by Consumer Value Stores (CVS), a chain
that in 1985 advertised a special one-week $3 price for most
prescription drugs at its stores in Wayne, N.J.
   Timothy Brophy, a pharmacist at a CVS store in Wayne, was fined
$500 by the New Jersey Pharmaceutical Board.
   The drug store chain said the ban on discounts discriminates
against cut-rate pharmacies and hurts economic competition. The
chain said the law is designed for ``the economic protection of a
limited group in a profession whose lobby in a state legislature is
more effective or more powerful than the lobby of others in the
profession.''
   The law is irrational because customers 62 and older who are
more likely to need medication are not afforded the presumed
protection of banning discounts, CVS said.
   ``Consumers are entitled to purchase prescription drugs at a
pharmacy of their choice, without undue influence from the state,''
lawyers for the store said.
   The New Jersey Supreme Court said exempting senior citizens from
the ban on discounts is ``a reasonable legislative response to
economic pressure on the elderly.''
   The case is Consumer Value Stores vs. Board of Pharmacy, 89-801.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Whether Clubs Can Use Food Losses to Offset
Profits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether non-profit social clubs that are generally exempt from
federal income taxes can use losses incurred from selling food and
drink to non-members to offset investment profits.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by the Portland Golf Club
in Oregon in which at least $4 million in tax revenue nationwide is
at stake.
   The Bush administration urged the justices to use the golf
club's appeal to settle a conflict between two federal appeals
courts.
   The golf club is exempt from paying federal income tax on dues
and other fees paid by its members. It qualifies for the exemption
as a social club ``organized for pleasure, recreation and other
non-profitable purposes.''
   But the club also receives income from selling food and drink to
non-members and in interest from its investments. That income is
not exempt from federal taxation.
   The Internal Revenue Service said the golf club owed $5,298 in
taxes for 1980 and 1981.
   The club said it lost $98,041 those two years from selling food
and drink to non-members because its expenses and overhead for that
activity exceeded income from the sales.
   The club sought to use the losses to offset profits from its
investments.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in June that the
losses are not deductible because the club had not intended the
sale of food and drink to non-members to be a profit-making
activity.
   That ruling conflicted with a decision in another case by the
6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The Justice Department said the Supreme Court should resolve the
conflict. It said there have been several hundred IRS audits over
the issue involving about $4 million.
   The case is Portland Golf Club vs. Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, 89-530.

<HEAD>Court Curtails Illinois Law Allowing Store and Theater Shutdowns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today curtailed an Illinois
public nuisance law that has been used to shut down adult
bookstores and theaters for up to a year.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that the state
law sometimes violates the free-speech rights of bookstore and
theater owners.
   The high court ruled in a New York case in 1986 that states may
close down for long periods adult bookstores found to be public
nuisances because of the on-premises conduct of their patrons.
   But the Illinois law in the case acted on today was more
sweeping. It permitted closing such stores and theaters if the
operators were convicted of selling obscene material.
   The Illinois law said the establishment could either be closed
or could be allowed to remain open if the owners posted a bond that
would be forfeited if obscene material was sold on the premises.
   The case stemmed from an attempted crackdown against the Denmark
II bookstore in Kendall County, Ill. The building was leased by
Bruce and Cathy Riemenschneider to Sequoia Books Inc.
   There were numerous obscenity prosecutions against the bookstore
from 1982 to 1985, resulting in eight guilty verdicts. But the
store remained open for business.
   Then in 1986, the state sought to declare the bookstore a public
nuisance, and a judge ordered it shut down for one year unless
Sequoia Books posted a $5,000 bond. The bond was posted, but the
judge ruled that obscene magazines then were sold at the store and
the bond was revoked.
   The Illinois Supreme Court ruled last March that the
anti-nuisance law was unconstitutional.
   ``The state argues that the sale of obscene material is the
equivalent of the sexual conduct involved'' in the 1986 case
decided by the Supreme Court, the state court said. ``We do not
agree that the sale of obscene material and actual sexual conduct
can be so easily equated.''
   The Illinois court said states may not shut down establishments
that sell non-obscene material merely because some obscene works
have been sold.
   ``This blunderbuss approach ... is inconsistent with our
traditional insistence that the regulation of any form of
expression, even of obscenity, be carefully drawn so as not to
impact unduly upon protected speech,'' the state court said.
   The justices had a similar question under study in a Dallas case
decided last week.
   In that case, the court left unanswered whether anyone convicted
of certain crimes may be barred from operating a sexually oriented
business.
   Instead, the high court struck down that part of the Dallas
ordinance requiring all sexually oriented businesses to acquire
special licenses because of inadequate safeguards against licensing
delays.
   The case acted on today is Illinois vs. Sequoia Books, 88-1844.

   Boris Yeltsin, the maverick Soviet Communist Party
member and parliamentarian, said today that force should not be
used to quell ethnic unrest in its southern republics.
   Speaking of ethnic unrest and economic problems, Yeltsin told
Japanese journalists: ``This year is very critical. We are at a
turning point _ whether a very ill patient will be able to recover
or not.''
   Recent ethnic strife has killed more than 56 people in fighting
between ethnic Armenians and Azerbaijanis, official reports say.
Soviet troops have been deployed to try to stop the fighting, one
of the bloodiest conflicts facing the country.
   Yeltsin said the use of force to suppress local movements for
autonomy would only increase the number of republics that wish to
secede. He did not say whether he meant force by the army or by the
warring ethnic groups.
   ``These issues should not be resolved through force. We have had
enough bloodshed already,'' Yeltsin told reporters at Japan's
National Press Club.
   ``Patience and endurance is necessary. This is the sole
possibility I see. There is no other drastic means to settle the
situation,'' he told reporters at Japan's National Press Club.
   Yeltsin also said the Communist Party must be fundamentally
reformed, its monopoly on power abolished, and autonomy granted to
the nation's republics.
   Yeltsin repeated his support for President Mikhail Gorbachev's
policy of ``perestroika,'' or restructuring. But he said
Gorbachev's failure to deal with reform ``in a fundamental way''
had caused a worsening of the situation in the Soviet Union and a
drop in Gorbachev's popularity.
   ``The economy is facing a crisis, and the situation of ethnic
groups is at a crucial stage,'' he said. ``The society in general
is facing a crisis.''
   He said perestroika, following decades of repression, had
reawakened ethnic consciousness and allowed citizens to express
their opinions freely.
   But Yeltsin said attempts by Gorbachev to limit the extent of
the reforms were like ``trying to extinguish a fire after it
starts.''
   Yeltsin's remarks, in Russian, were translated into Japanese and
then into English.
   Yeltsin is in Japan on a 10-day speaking tour, which will
include a meeting with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.

   The plea came as the financial institution was about to go on
trial in the first federal prosecution of a major bank on charges
of conspiring to aid drug trafficking through secret accounts.
   One of the defendants, Amjad Awan of Coral Gables, has said he
was once Manuel Antonio Noriega's banker, but the Luxembourg bank
had filed a motion to keep the fallen Panamanian dictator's name
out of the case.
   The banking company, which operates in 73 countries, was allowed
to continue operations in the United States after putting $14
million in escrow to cover the amount the government contended the
bank had laundered. In addition to the indictments, the government
sued for forfeiture of property and other assets.
   A defense motion had sought to prohibit prosecutors from
mentioning Noriega, which the defense expected because Stephen
Michael Kalish is among the drug dealers on the government witness
list.
   Kalish testified for the prosecution in a federal marijuana
smuggling trial that ended Monday with acquittals of 16 defendants
and convictions of four in Lafayette, La.
   Kalish, arrested in Tampa in 1984 and serving 15 years without
parole, has testified that he secured Panama banking for his
marijuana smuggling ring in 1983 by giving Noriega an attache case
stuffed with $300,000 in bills.
   According to the government, Kalish also met with Awan and
deposited an initial $2 million from marijuana smuggling into an
account with the bank in Panama City.
   During U.S. Senate testimony before his arrest, Awan said such a
deposit was possible but he had no recollection of it.
   Awan, 41, who was assistant division director of the bank for
Latin America in Miami, told Senate investigators he personally
managed a secret account Noriega opened at the bank's Panamanian
branch in 1982. Awan said Noriega was the only one who could
authorize withdrawals from the account, which contained up to $25
million.
   Awan told the investigators Noriega closed his bank account
after the indictments were announced. Awan denied knowledge of any
drug dealing by Noriega or the bank.
   According to the indictment, undercover Customs agents contacted
representatives of the bank in 1987 and opened accounts at
different branches. Bank officials were to receive drug money and
put it in certificates of deposit in one of the branches, agents
said.
   Investigators said bank officials would create a loan at another
branch, permit drug traffickers to withdraw the funds, then repay
the loan with money in the certificates.
   The branches used reportedly included locations in France,
Panama, Uruguay, the Bahamas, Luxembourg and Britain.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors are considering criminal charges
against protesters who ransacked the capital's secret police
headquarters, national police chief Dieter Winderlich said today.
   The announcement came hours after East Germany's ruling
Communists said the storming of the building Monday showed the
country's ``street revolution'' could get out of hand.
   Winderlich told a news conference that protesters also had
broken into the building's section for counter-espionage activities
but did not discover the identity of the section's workers.
   He said the protesters caused hundreds of thousands of dollars
in damage to the eight-story building.
   The building today remained under control of an opposition-led
``citizens' committee,'' regular police officers and government
representatives.
   Also today, workers at a state-owned factory in the city of Gera
staged a politically motivated warning strike to show their
dissatisfaction with the Communists, according to West Berlin's
RIAS radio station.
   In Bonn, the conservative daily newspaper Die Welt said Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was expected to visit East Berlin in
the next two or three weeks.
   Die Welt, quoting well-informed sources in East Berlin, said
Gorbachev plans a ``massive show of support'' for his long-time
friend, East German Communist Premier Hans Modrow.
   Dirk Bachmann, East Berlin's police chief, said opposition
groups' calls for restraint had prevented injuries during the
storming of the secret police building.
   The protesters demanded the ouster of the Communists and
expressed anger at the government for not moving faster to
dismantle the secret police and carry out reforms.
   Three months after a peaceful popular revolt toppled old
hard-line Communist leaders, the party still essentially controls
the government, media, economy and bureaucracy.
   The Communist Party daily newspaper Neues Deutschland said in a
commentary that the organizers of protests like that at the secret
police headquarters must accept responsibility for the consequences.
   ``Responsibility also means means having a clear idea about
consequences before calling for a demonstration, so that things
don't get out of hand,'' the newspaper said in a front-page
editorial.
   It added: ``The call for `no violence,' which has marked the
street revolution from the start, becomes a farce when emotions
break through the bounds of reason.''
   Opposition leaders called for calm and an end to the destruction.
   A day earlier, New Forum opposition group called for the
protests to oppose what it called the ``restoration policy'' of
Communists seeking to gain an advantage before the May elections,
according to the official news agency ADN.
   The call was answered by hundreds of thousands of people,
including those who stormed the secret police headquarters.
   Dozens of protesters in the southern city of Cottbus had pelted
the local secret police building with rocks, and unsuccessfully
tried to enter it.
   Official news media also reported that about 500,000 people
demonstrated against the Communists and secret police in at least a
dozen cities on Monday evening.
   Addressing the crowd at the Berlin secret police headquarters
through a loudspeaker system, Modrow asked the protesters ``to stay
in a dialogue'' with his shaky coalition government and expressed
``full understanding'' for the rage caused by decades of repression
at the hands of the secret police.
   Hours earlier, Modrow had offered opposition groups a far
greater say in running the caretaker government before democratic
elections on May 6.
   The protest actions are reaching further into virtually all
parts of society and even all age groups. Increasingly, children
and older adults in their 50s and 60s are joining in.
   East Germany's state-run television interrupted its programs
several times to broadcast a warning against further actions like
that in East Berlin.
   ``The democracy that is just now developing is in the gravest
danger,'' it warned.
   Government officials at talks with the opposition Monday morning
had outlined a chilling array of rifles, rocket-propelled grenades
and machine guns controlled by the secret police.
   The disclosures, which were broadcast live, included news that
the secret police consumed more than 1 percent of the national
budget.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether people accused of child abuse have the right to at least
one face-to-face confrontation with their young accusers.
   The justices, in two cases of enormous importance for
child-abuse prosecutions nationwide, said they will consider
reinstating the child-molesting conviction of a Maryland day-care
center owner and an Idaho woman's child-abuse conviction.
   Decisions in the two cases are expected by July. They mark the
court's second venture into this area of criminal law in the past
two years.
   Stating that the Constitution's Sixth Amendment requires a
face-to-face confrontation, the justices in 1988 struck down an
Iowa man's sexual-assault conviction because two 13-year-old girls
were allowed to testify while protected by a large screen placed in
the courtroom between them and the defendant.
   The Sixth Amendment, in part, says, ``In all criminal
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be
confronted with the witnesses against him.''
   The 1988 decision appeared to leave unanswered whether there may
be exceptions to the face-to-face requirement.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Said it will consider limiting the power of environmentalists
to prevent the opening up of federal lands to commerical
development.
   The court voted to review a pro-environmentalist ruling
challenged by the Bush administration. The case involves a U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruling last June that the National
Wildlife Federation may sue the Interior Department over plans to
change the status of some 180 million acres of public land in
western states and Alaska.
   _ Agreed to decide what authority police have to stop and
question someone on the basis of an anonymous tip that the person
is involved in a crime.
   The justices said they will review an Alabama court ruling that
limited such police tactics.
   _ Refused to kill lawsuits against two Pennsylvania school
officials by two former students who say they were sexually
assaulted by their high school band instructor.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
officials are not entitled to qualified legal immunity from being
sued by the two former students.
   _ Refused to let a machinists union strike against Eastern
Airlines spread to commuter railroads.
   The court, without comment, left intact rulings barring sympathy
strikes against railroads in New York City, Philadelphia and their
suburbs.
   _ Blocked indefinitely the effect of a lower court ruling that
could have provided natural gas consumers with tens of millions of
dollars in refunds.
   The justices, granting an emergency request by 21 energy
companies, held in abeyance a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
decision that could have led to the refunds.
   _ Agreed to consider broadening the power of states to sue in
behalf of gas consumers allegedly overcharged by utility companies.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Kansas and Missouri
officials who have accused utilities of illegal price-fixing.
   In one of the child abuse cases, Maryland's highest court threw
out Sandra A. Craig's conviction, saying her 7-year-old accuser and
three other young witnesses wrongly were allowed to testify against
her over closed-circuit television.
   But the state court stopped short of invalidating the Maryland
law that allows young children to testify by closed-circuit
television, outside the presence of the defendant, in such cases.
About half the states have similar laws.
   The trial judge was constitutionally required to question the
children, however briefly, in Mrs. Craig's presence, the state
court said.
   That was the only way, the state court concluded, that the judge
could determine whether the children would suffer ``serious
emotional distress'' if forced to testify in court with Mrs. Craig
present.
   The judge instead relied on the pretrial testimony of experts in
deciding that such courtroom testimony would be traumatic for the
children.
   That violated Mrs. Craig's Sixth Amendment right to confront all
adverse witnesses, the state's highest court said. Its ruling cited
a 1988 Supreme Court decision.
   Stating that the Sixth Amendment requires a face-to-face
confrontation, the justices last year struck down an Iowa man's
sexual-assault conviction because two 13-year-old girls were
allowed to testify while protected by a large screen placed in the
courtroom between them and the defendant.
   The 1988 decision appeared to leave unanswered whether there may
be exceptions to the face-to-face requirement.
   In the appeal acted on today, Maryland Attorney General J.
Joseph Curran Jr. said the state court ruling in Mrs. Craig's case
``struck an untrue balance between a defendant's constitutional
right ... and the compelling governmental interest of safeguarding
the physical and psychological well-being of a child.''
   The appeal was supported in ``friend-of-the-court'' briefs
submitted by 28 states and various children's rights groups.
   In its ruling last July, the Maryland Court of Appeals said Mrs.
Craig is entitled to a new trial on charges that she sexually
molested a girl who attended her Howard County day-care center for
two years before it was closed in 1986.
   Mrs. Craig had been sentenced to 10 years in prison for her 1987
conviction on those charges.
   She also faces trial on charges stemming from the alleged
molestation of 12 other children who attended the day-care center
in Clarksville, Md.
   At the 1987 trial, four children were allowed to testify outside
the courtroom with only a prosecutor and one of Mrs. Craig's
lawyers present. Mrs. Craig and her other lawyer remained in the
courtroom, where they could watch the testimony over a
closed-circuit television.
   Mrs. Craig and her lawyer in the courtroom could talk privately
with her lawyer in the other room by telephone during the
testimony. The four young witnesses were cross-examined by Mrs.
Craig's lawyer in the room.
   In the Idaho case, the issue is whether a defendant's right to
confrontation was violated by the testimony of a pediatrician who
had examined a 2-year-old girl allegedly abused by her father.
   Laura Lee Wright and Robert Giles were convicted in Idaho of
lewd conduct committed on Mrs. Wright's two daughters, who were
then 5 and 2.
   Mrs. Wright was sentenced to 20 years in prison, but the state
Supreme Court threw out her conviction last June 13 and ordered a
new trial.
   The state court ruled that the trial judge wrongly had allowed a
pediatrician who had examined the 2-year-old girl to testify about
what she told him. The girl did not testify at the trial, and
therefore could not be cross-examined by Mrs. Wright's lawyer.
   The state court said the pediatrician's testimony ``lacks
particularized guarantees of trustworthiness and, in fact, is
fraught with the dangers of unreliability which the (Sixth
Amendment) is designed to highlight and obviate.''
   The cases are Maryland vs. Craig, 89-478, and Idaho vs. Wright,
89-260.

<TEXT>
   The United States expressed concern today
over civilian casualties in three weeks of fighting between
Liberian soldiers and opponents of President Samuel K. Doe.
   ``We deplore actions, whether by government troops or
insurgents, which lead to such casualties,'' said a statement
issued by the U.S. Embassy in Monrovia, the Liberian capital.
   Sporadic fighting was reported today as government troops
continued a search for rebels, who said they have launched another
offensive.
   ``As far as we know, there is still some fighting going on,'' a
Western diplomat said in a telephone interview from Monrovia.
   The U.S. Embassy statement said officials had discussed the
fighting ``with governments in the region'' but did not elaborate.
   It also said officials were encouraging humanitarian groups,
including the International Committee of the Red Cross and the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees, to help an estimated 20,000 people
who have fled the fighting.
   The government says the rebels, who allegedly came from Ivory
Coast on Dec. 24, killed 200 civilians before government troops
brought the situation under control.
   Liberian authorities say 16 government officials were also
killed after the rebels attacked the villages of Butuo and Karnplay
near the border.
   But two major human rights groups, Africa Watch of New York and
Amnesty International of London, have accused the military of also
killing unarmed civilians.
   Jenkins Scott, Liberia's justice minister, said last week that
soldiers killed some civilians but insisted they acted in
self-defense.
   Amnesty International quoted refugees and other sources as
saying hundreds of civilian were killed by the rebels and the
military.
   Amnesty International said the fighting has forced 20,000
Liberians to flee to Ivory Coast and Guinea.
   President Houphouet-Boigny of Ivory Coast said earlier this
month that between 8,000 and 10,000 people had entered his country.
   Charles Taylor, the self-proclaimed leader of the Liberian
dissidents, told the British Broadcasting Corp. today his forces
had launched a new offensive south of the site of previous fighting.
   The BBC made no mention of where its correspondent interviewed
Taylor, a former Liberian civil servant. Taylor gave no indication
of the size of the new offensive.
   The government says it has captured 11 of an estimated 100
rebels who entered the country in two groups Dec. 24 and is seeking
the remainder.
   Robert Morris, Liberia's assistant information minister,
declined to answer questions from The Associated Press.
   Liberia was founded in 1842 by freed American slaves.
   President Doe is a former master sergeant in the Liberian army
who came to power in a 1980 bloody coup. Last month's invasion was
the second attempt to oust Doe in four years.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a $1.56
million award against a Montana religious group sued by a former
member.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the award
violates the organization's religious freedom.
   Church Universal &amp; Triumphant was sued by Gregory Mull, a
53-year-old San Francisco architect when in 1974 he started taking
part in the church's activities.
   Mull, who died in 1986, moved in 1979 to Calabasas, Calif., site
of the church's headquarters at the time, known as Camelot. The
church moved its headquarters to Montana in 1986.
   He said Elizabeth Clare Prophet, the church's spiritual leader
with the title Messenger of the Ascended Masters, promised Mull
would help design buildings for the group's proposed $33 million
``New Jerusalem'' in Calabasas.
   According to court documents, the church secretly had abandoned
the project without telling Mull. The suit alleged that the church
was using his architectural plans to help raise millions of dollars
in donations.
   Mull also accused the church of violating his privacy rights by
disclosing details of his sex life given in a ``confession'' to
Mrs. Prophet.
   He also sued the church for inflicting emotional distress,
alleging he was pressured into giving up his last $5,500 in savings
at a time when he was out of work and supporting his daughter in
college.
   A California appeals court, in upholding the $1.56 million jury
award last April, said Mull was subject to ``constant and shameful
pressures'' to part with his money, and that he became so destitute
he and his daughter took food from grocery store garbage bins.
   The daughter, Linda Witt, is Mull's heir.
   The church said the damage award should be overturned because,
in part, it was based on prejudicial evidence and ridicule of the
church's religious practices by Mull's lawyer.
   For example, the church said, Mrs. Prophet's husband, Edward
Francis, testifed under questioning by Mull's lawyer that he
believed he was the reincarnation of Captain Cook.
   The lawyer then prefaced the next question by saying, ``Let me
ask you this one as Mr. Francis instead of Captain Cook.''
   The church said the jury also was prejudiced by the testimony of
a witness for Mull, who said he once had an adulterous affair with
Mrs. Prophet.
   The church said Mull's suit was based on the claim he had been
reduced to ``a slave of the church.'' The resulting damage award
``constitutes an unprecedented threat to the free exercise of
religion of minority religious organizations and their members,''
the church said.
   The justices have rejected two similar appeals recently.
   In October, they left intact a ruling that an evangelical
Christian group must return $5.5 million donated by a department
store heiress when she was a member.
   The court last May refused to shield the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's
Unification Church from being sued by two former California members
who said they were brainwashed into joining it.
   The case acted on today is Church Universal &amp; Triumphant vs.
Witt, 89-672.

<HEAD>Chinese Communists Call for Extending Austerity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's Communist Party today called for fiscal
austerity until at least 1991, outlined tough measures to lower the
boom on non-essential industries, and acknowledged that more
workers will lose their jobs.
   The plan reflects the current conservative leadership's drive to
revive state controls over the economy, which were loosened during
the previous 10 years of reform and decentralization.
   It also underscores the desire to give priority to the
development of large, state-run industries. The party said some
factories, in particular smaller private enterprises, will be
closed during the austerity drive.
   The plan, which also urges controls on consumer demand, was put
foward in a lengthy party document on ``economic readjustment.''
The policy paper, carried by the official Xinhua News Agency, does
not mention any plans to introduce new market-oriented reforms.
   Reforms have effectively been put on hold since austerity
policies were first adopted in fall 1988 and particularly after the
ouster of pro-reform party leader Zhao Ziyang when pro-democracy
protests were crushed in June.
   The 39-point document made public today was prepared for a
plenary session of the party Central Committee in November. It has
apparently been circulated to party offices.
   It says the task of restoring order to the economy that began in
fall 1988 would take three years or more. The paper also said the
nation's spending habits must be sharply curtailed during that time.
   The party, which under Zhao was moving toward a policy of
non-interference in economic affairs, must enhance its leading role
in guiding the economy, the document said.
   It said the nation's economic goals are to bring the inflation
rate under 10 percent a year, keep annual growth of the gross
national product to 5-6 percent, keep new currency issues down, and
balance the budget. The gross national product is the total worth
of all goods and services.
   China achieved some of those goals in 1989, bringing inflation
down from a high of more than 30 percent in 1988 to less than 10
percent in the final months of 1989.
   However, the government's tight credit and suspension of
thousands of building projects have led to widespread bankruptcies,
plant shutdowns and a growing unemployment problem.
   In the plan, the party acknowledged that ``some workers will
become unemployed.''
   China says the urban unemployment rate is approaching 4 percent,
up from 2 percent before the austerity drive. The figures do not
include millions of rural residents without work because of the
slowdown.
   The government has also fallen further into debt because of
decreased revenues and huge subsidies provided faltering state-run
factories.
   Today's report said smaller township enterprises, the backbone
of economic progress in rural areas during the past decade, will
not be allowed to vie with large industries for raw materials.
   The plan said private enterprises are a necessary supplement to
the socialist economy but must develop ``within the limits of state
control.''

   A Luxembourg bank pleaded guilty today in a
$32 million global money-laundering case with links to cocaine
traffickers and fallen dictator Manuel Noriega, and agreed to
forfeit a record $14 million.
   Under the plea bargain, the two divisions of the Bank of Credit
and Commerce International will also receive five years' probation.
   The plea did not affect charges against six bank officers _ one
of whom said he was Noriega's personal banker _ and two Colombians
prosecutors say were part of the Medellin cocaine cartel. Their
case opened today with pre-trial motions.
   But under the plea bargain, BCCI agreed to cooperate in
prosecuting the remaining defendants.
   The cash forfeiture of $14 million frozen by the government was
the largest ever by a financial institution in the United States,
said Dave Runkel, U.S. Justice Department spokesman.
   BCCI entered the plea as it was about to go on trial in the
first federal prosecution of a major bank on charges of conspiring
to aid drug trafficking through secret accounts.
   The more than 30 charges against the two bank entities included
tax fraud, failure to report currency transactions over $10,000 and
laundering cocaine profits.
   U.S. District Judge W. Terrell Hodges did not immediately set a
sentencing date. He imposed a gag order to prevent parties in the
case from talking to the news media, and bank officials and
attorneys refused comment on the agreement.
   During a two-year sting called Operation C-Chase, Customs agents
posed as money launderers and penetrated powerful Colombian
syndicates, authorities said.
   According to the indictment, agents contacted BCCI
representatives in 1987 and opened accounts at different branches.
BCCI officials were to receive drug money and put it in
certificates of deposit in the branches, agents said.
   The branches used reportedly included locations in France,
Panama, Uruguay, the Bahamas, Luxembourg and England.
   Customs agents claimed the money was intended mainly for
Colombian drug traffickers. Investigators said bank officials would
create a loan at a branch, permit the agents to withdraw the funds,
then repay the loan with the CDs.
   The bank divisions and nine of its officers were indicted in
1988. Noriega is not mentioned in the indictment.
   Altogether, more than 80 people were accused of participating in
drug-related money-laundering in eight U.S. cities _ Detroit,
Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Miami, New York and
Tampa _ and London and Paris.
   BCCI, with operations in 73 countries, was allowed to continue
doing business after putting $14 million in escrow to cover the
amount the government contended the bank had laundered.
   Among those still facing trial is Amjad Awan of Coral Gables,
who claims he was Noriega's banker, managing an account that held
up to $25 million.
   Also charged are Gonzalo Mora Jr., who prosecutors claim
operated a money-laundering network based in Medellin, Colombia, to
help traffickers, and Rudolph Armbrect, described as Mora's partner.
   The defense has filed a motion to prohibit prosecutors from
bringing Noriega into the case, a move the defense expects because
Stephen Michael Kalish is among the drug kingpins on the government
witness list.
   Kalish, arrested in 1984 and serving 15 years, has testified
that he secured safe Panama banking for his marijuana smuggling
ring in 1983 by giving Noriega an attache case stuffed with
$300,000 in bills.
   According to the government, Kalish also met with Awan and
deposited an initial $2 million in marijuana cash into a BCCI
account in Panama City.
   During U.S. Senate testimony before his arrest, Awan said such a
deposit was possible but he had no recollection of it.
   Awan, 41, who was assistant division director of BBCI for Latin
America in Miami, told Senate investigators he managed a secret
account Noriega opened at the bank's Panamanian branch in 1982.
Awan said Noriega was the only one who could authorize withdrawals
from the account.
   Awan told investigators Noriega closed his account when the
indictments were announced. Awan denied knowledge of any drug
dealing by Noriega or the bank.
   The other defendants in the case are Syed Aftab Hussain,
operations officer of the Panamanian branch; Akbar A. Bilgrami of
Miami, director of the Latin American division; Sibte Hassan, an
officer with the Paris branch; Ian Howard, a French manager based
in Paris, and Iqbal Ashraf of Lawndale, Calif., manager of the Los
Angeles branch of BCCI.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Tuesday by the Supreme Court.
   
   CHILD ABUSE
   
   The court agreed to decide whether people accused of child abuse
have the right to at least one face-to-face confrontation with
their young accusers.
   The justices, in two cases of enormous importance for
child-abuse prosecutions nationwide, said they will consider
reinstating the child-molesting conviction of a Maryland day-care
center owner and an Idaho woman's child-abuse conviction.
   The cases are Maryland vs. Craig, 89-478, and Idaho vs. Wright,
89-260.
   
   FEDERAL LANDS
   
   The court said it will consider limiting the power of
environmentalists to prevent the opening up of federal lands to
commerical development.
   The court voted to review a pro-environmentalist ruling
challenged by the Bush administration. The case involves a U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruling last June that the National
Wildlife Federation may sue the Interior Department over plans to
change the status of some 180 million acres of public land in
western states and Alaska.
   The case is Lujan vs. National Wildlife Federation, 89-640.
   
   POLICE TIPS
   
   The court agreed to decide what authority police have to stop
and question someone on the basis of an anonymous tip that the
person is involved in a crime.
   The justices said they will review an Alabama court ruling that
limited such police tactics.
   The case is Alabama vs. White, 89-789.
   
   SEX ASSAULTS
   
   The court refused to kill lawsuits against two Pennsylvania
school officials by two former students who say they were sexually
assaulted by their high school band instructor.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
officials are not entitled to qualified legal immunity from being
sued by the two former students.
   The cases are Smith vs. Stoneking, 89-780, and Smith vs. Sowers,
89-782.
   
   EASTERN STRIKE
   
   The court refused to let a machinists union strike against
Eastern Airlines spread to commuter railroads.
   The justices, without comment, left intact rulings barring
sympathy strikes against railroads in New York City, Philadelphia
and their suburbs.
   The cases are International Association of Machinists vs. Long
Island Railroad, 89-427 and 89-674, and Brotherhood of Railroad
Signalmen vs. SEPTA, 89-756.
   
   GAS PRICES
   
   The court blocked indefinitely the effect of a lower court
ruling that could have provided natural gas consumers with tens of
millions of dollars in refunds.
   The justices, granting an emergency request by 21 energy
companies, held in abeyance a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
decision that could have led to the refunds.
   The case is Mobil Oil Exploration vs. United Distribution
Companies, A-503.
   
   GAS CONSUMERS
   
   The court agreed to consider broadening the power of states to
sue in behalf of gas consumers allegedly overcharged by utility
companies.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Kansas and Missouri
officials who have accused utilities of illegal price-fixing.
   The case is Kansas vs. Kansas Power &amp; Light, 88-2109.
   
   TWA
   
   The court turned away an appeal by Trans World Airlines flight
attendants, who accused TWA owner Carl Icahn of sex bias in seeking
wage cuts and other concessions that triggered a strike.
   The court, without comment, refused to revive a lawsuit against
the airline. The flight attendants sought back pay and other
benefits.
   The case is Independent Federation of Flight Attendants vs. TWA,
89-783.
   
   CHURCH UNIVERSAL
   
   The court left intact a $1.56 million award against a Montana
religious group sued by a former member.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the award
violates the religious freedom of the Church Universal &amp; Triumphant.
   The case is Church Universal &amp; Triumphant vs. Witt, 89-672.
   
   CABLE TELEVISION
   
   The Court left intact a ruling that cities may fine cable
television companies for failing to broadcast enough locally
originated programs.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by three
affiliated Chicago cable TV firms that said their free-speech
rights were violated when they were fined $60,750.
   The case is Chicago Cable Communications vs. Chicago Cable
Commission, 89-747.
   
   DRUGGISTS
   
   The court let stand a ruling that a state may ban pharmacists
from selling prescription drugs at a discount.
   The court, without comment, rejected a challenge to a New Jersey
law banning drug discounts and rebates except for medication sold
to people over 62.
   The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled last August that the law,
attacked as a form of economic protectionism, has rational purposes
and therefore is constitutional.
   The case is Consumer Value Stores vs. Board of Pharmacy, 89-801.

<TEXT>
   Authorities intercepted two letter bombs at an
army office today, and Scotland Yard warned the public to be on the
alert for suspicious packages.
   Police said the bombs, in brown padded envelopes, were found and
defused at the army South East District Headquarters in Aldershot,
40 miles southwest of London. The offices were evacuated, police
said.
   The British domestic news agency, Press Association, quoted army
sources as saying the bombs were sent to individual officers, who
were not identified.
   ``The public must be vigilant when opening mail,'' said Cmdr.
George Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist
branch. ``If at all suspicious they must be urged to contact police
immediately and leave the parcel alone.''
   Churchill-Coleman said military personnel and public officials
connected with Northern Ireland affairs should be particularly
alert.
   Two months ago police defused a bomb under a car in west London
that was apparently intended for a British army general.
   Churchill-Coleman at the time would not specifically say the car
bomb was the work of the Irish Republican Army but that the group
had been carrying out a bombing campaign on the British mainland
and ``this appears to be that kind of device.''
   Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political wing, said at the time it
knew nothing about the car bomb.
   The IRA is fighting British rule in Northern Ireland. It wants
to unite the predominantly Protestant province with the
overwhelmingly Catholic Republic of Ireland, under socialist rule.

   Fire broke out aboard a small Saudi

34-member crew were lost and feared dead, sources at the owner's
company said Tuesday.
   The rest of the crew of the 21,032-ton Raad Al-Bakri VIII tanker
was rescued by vessels responding to a distress signal in the
Monday incident, said the sources at the Jiddah-based Bakri
Navigation Co., who spoke on condition they not be identified.
   Many of the crew were picked up from life rafts and taken to
Port Sudan.
   The fire broke out in one of the tanks and quickly spread to the
steering room and crew cabin. It was brought under control and the
tanker, which was empty, was anchored near Port Sudan.

   Eight toddlers were scalded to death when steam
exploded from a broken heating system in their orphanage during a
cold spell in the Volga River city of Ulyanovsk, Tass reported
Tuesday.
   The children, ranging in age from 1 to 3 years, died Saturday
night after temperatures fell to minus 26 degrees Fahrenheit and
part of the city heating system broke down, the official news
agency said.
   The district breakdown coincided with a malfunction of the
orphanage's radiator, Tass said, and the pressurized hot steam that
spewed from the radiator killed the sleeping children.
   Ulyanovsk, like much of the Soviet Union, has been undergoing a
brutal cold spell in the last three days. On Tuesday, 17 housing
complexes in Ulyanovsk, a city of about 460,000 people, were still
without heat because of the breakdown, Tass said.

<BYLINE>Koran Comic Book Continues to Draw Fire
^By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The publication of the Koran in comic-book form
drew more fire from Islamic groups as the leading religious body of
Tunisia called for it to be banned as an ``impious work.''
   In a statement made public in Tunis on Monday, the Higher
Islamic Council said the comic book ``If the Koran Were Told to
Me,'' which has been published in France, has ``brought prejudice
against the sanctity of the Koran and Moslems.''
   ``The illustration of the teachings of the holy Koran by profane
images constitutes sacrilege and heresy,'' the statement said.
   The Koran is the sacred book of Islam. According to Moslems, it
contains the words of God as revealed to the prophet Mohammed.
   The comic books are the work of Youssef Seddik, a Tunisian-born
academic who has lived in Paris since 1983. He was in Tunis and not
immediately available for comment, according to his wife, Saida.
   Seddik, 46, said in an interview earlier this month that his
goal was simply to make the Koran more accessible to young people,
and not to violate the sacredness of Islam.
   The Tunisian religious body condemned Seddik for not having
consulted experts in Islamic jurisprudence before publishing the
comic books and appealed to Islamic groups and the publishing world
to ``act efficiently so as to prevent the repetition of such acts
and thus preserve the inviolability of the sacredness of Islam.''
   The series of comic books was criticized last week by Mohammed
Faidallah, head of Islamic Jurisprudence at Kuwait University, as
ridiculing the sanctity of the Holy Koran.
   He was quoted as calling Seddik ``a new Salman Rushdie,'' the
Indian-born British novelist condemned to death last year by the
late Ayotollah Ruhollah Khomeini for ``The Satanic Verses.''
Rushdie has been in hiding ever since.
   ``My husband was completely astounded by the fact that people
are comparing him to Rushdie,'' Mrs. Seddik said Tuesday. ``He
expected some people not to like it, but he never dreamed he would
be accused of blasphemy.''
   The comic book illustrations are accompanied by exact quotations
from the Koran, complete with chapter and verse references.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
renewing his attempt to open Mideast peace talks, was meeting today
with Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid to try to settle
a dispute over the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The squabble is delaying the start of negotiations and could
block implementation of an Israeli plan for elections on the West
Bank and in Gaza.
   Baker also plans to meet on Thursday with Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
   Abdel-Meguid, accompanied by Osama el-Baz, a key adviser to
President Hosni Mubarak, arrived in Washington this morning and was
expected to remain in the capital for several days.
   Rabin was due here after midnight from Los Angeles and will see
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Wednesday and Baker and Brent
Scowcroft, the national security assistant to President Bush, on
Thursday.
   Whether the PLO should play a role in negotiations _ if they
ever get started _ is the main stumbling block as Baker tries to
launch step-by-step negotiations leading up to elections on the
Israeli-held West Bank and in Gaza.
   Baker has conducted most of his diplomacy by telephone to Cairo
and Jerusalem. It has left him frustrated and warning the parties
that problems in other parts of the world were demanding his
attention.
   Egypt, the only Arab nation to sign a peace treaty with Israel,
is serving as a channel to Yasser Arafat's PLO. In that mode, Egypt
accepted with reservations last month an invitation from Baker to a
three-way meeting here with Israel.
   The reservations sought some PLO control over Palestinian
participation further down the road. Israel, meanwhile, accepted
the invitation with the condition that the PLO, which is sworn to
Israel's dismantling as a Jewish state, be excluded from even an
off-stage role.
   The clash over the PLO has delayed setting a date for Baker's
three-way meeting with Abdel-Meguid and Israeli Foreign Minister
Moshe Arens.
   ``There are many other areas in the world clamoring for his
attention, areas where the circumstances are producing change,''
State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said last week.
``We hope to see the same kind of impulse that will produce change
in the Middle East and we're prepared to do all we can to promote
it.''
   She added: ``We have continued to try to make progress and lay
the basis for a trilateral meeting ... If this effort does fail it
certainly won't be due to a lack of effort or will on the part of
this President (Bush) or this secretary of state.''
   There is no indication, however, that the administration will
try to exert pressure on Israel by threatening to reduce U.S. aid.
   Still, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole today suggested
reducing aid to Israel, Egypt, the Philippines, Turkey and Pakistan
by 5 percent and diverting the money to countries such as Poland,
Hungary and Panama.
   ``To me, it boils down to this: Are big gains for freedom worth
a small cut in a few huge foreign aid programs? I say yes,'' Dole
wrote in a column in The New York Times.
   The unexpected trip by Abdel-Meguid and el-Baz follows two
visits to Cairo in a week by Arafat.
   An Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman said Monday that the two
officials ``are going to try and push forward Middle East peace
efforts'' with Baker.
   Abdel-Meguid also will hold talks with officials of the
International Monetary Fund, seeking easier terms for Egypt, a poor
country with a booming population.
   The PLO insists that it must ``name and be seen to name'' the
Palestinian delegation to future talks with Israel, and that the
agenda be open.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is trying to confine the
negotiations to the elections he has proposed for the 1.4 million
Palestinian Arabs who live on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   The elections are designed to produce a five-year experiment in
limited self-rule, which would be followed by broader negotiations.
   The PLO, which seeks to take over the West Bank and Gaza and to
establish a state carved out of Israeli territory, has denounced
Shamir's plan _ which has Baker's backing _ as a ploy.

   ``Our families have been ruined, our future ruined, because of
our politics,'' said Cristin Popescu, a spokesman for the group,
which staged the protest Monday.
   Popescu, a 31-year-old father of five, said the demonstrators
were still demanding to go to the United States as political
refugees, despite the overthrow of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu,
because it was their desire to leave Romania that often brought on
their troubles.
   Virginia Young, the embassy's consul-general, agreed the
protestors had been ``caught in the middle'' since they suffered
for trying to leave Romania before the revolution, but for one
reason or another were not eligible under U.S. immigration rules.
   ``They lost jobs or schooling for their children because they
asked for passports from the Romanian government or had relatives
in the United States,'' Mrs. Young said.
   Under Ceausescu's regime, few Romanians were allowed to leave,
even temporarily, and it was illegal to talk to foreigners without
permission.
   Mrs. Young said the embassy has been in contact with about 200
families for up to two years who wanted to move to the United
States but were not eligible.
   The marchers, whose backs bore signs saying ``American visa,''
marched around the embassy in silence.
   Popescu, the spokesman for the protesters, said that despite
Ceausescu's overthrow and the promise of free elections, they still
feared for their future.
   ``We don't have trust. A re-evaluation needs a long time. The
Communists have deep roots here,'' said Popescu.
   He added that protesters also remained worried about the secret
police. ``We know security people who've not yet been dismissed,''
he said.
   Popescu said the protesters were delighted that Ambassador Alan
Green Jr. agreed to meet with them, but they still planned to
demonstrate outside the embassy each week.
   Mrs. Young said Green had agreed to pass along the group's
concerns to Washington but could make no promises. ``They are a
group that we have concerns about,'' she said.

   Hundreds of angry Israelis, shouting ``bread
and work,'' blocked roads and clashed with mounted police in
northern Israel on Tuesday after a pipe factory owned by the ailing
Koor conglomerate was closed.
   Burning tires and a bulldozer blocked the road outside Hatzor
Haglilit, a town of 7,000 people eight miles north of the Sea of
Galilee.
   The protest followed the firing of 150 workers from the Habonim
Pipe factory, which is jointly owned by Kibbutz Kfar Hanassi and
Koor.
   Koor, an industrial conglomerate which employs 22,000 workers
and is owned by the Histadrut trade union federation, is threatened
with liquidation and is selling off assets, including some of its
100 subsidiary companies.
   Koor owes $950 million to creditors abroad and is considering
two buyout bids, one by the U.S.-based Shamrock Corp. and the other
from Canadian financier Mark Belzberg.
   The conglomerate's chairman, Arnon Gafny, resigned Monday in a
dispute over how to save Koor from liquidation, and the board
decided to stop all debt payments to Israeli banks until next week.
   Koor spokesman Amnon Bar-Noy said the board acted as it did
because of a shortage of cash and the hope that a comprehensive
bail-out agreement with the government and the banks would be
reached by next week.
   He said Koor, which at its height had 31,000 workers and 150
companies, planned to either sell the pipe factory or close it for
good.
   The demonstrators clashed with a column of police, reinforced
with mounted officers and a special anti-riot unit. Police moved in
when protesters blocked the highway and arrested four.
   Criminal charges also were filed against a junior high school
principle for allowing pupils to attend the demonstraiton, said
Police Assistant Inspector Yaacov Ganot.
   The head of the town council, Yossi Elul, told Israel radio the
demonstrations would continue until the jobs are returned.
   ``We burned tires. We closed the main road. We traded punches,
but after all we are closing our own home,'' he said.
   Hatzor is a development town, a community created around small
industry in the 1950s and settled by Jews from Arab countries. Many
such towns are suffering high unemployment as the industries fail.
   Shlomo Buchbut, deputy chairman of the Development Town Forum,
was quoted on Israel radio as saying the government must help Koor
industries recover because its collapse would mean social unrest
``every week in a different development town.''

   Anna Strand, believed to be the oldest North
Dakotan, has died at the age of 109.
   Strand, who had lived in a nursing home for the past 10 years,
died Jan. 10. A memorial service was held Monday.
   ``A neighbor asked her once what her secret to long life was,''
recalled Strand's son, Melvin. ``She said, `If I told you, it
wouldn't be a secret.'''
   Strand was born in Numedal, Norway, in 1880. She moved to North
Dakota in 1907 and homesteaded near Ambrose the following year.
   S.F. Hoffner, executive director of the state Centennial
Commission, said commission records showed Strand was the state's
oldest citizen.
   Survivors include a sister, Gina Carlson, of Crosby, whose 98th
birthday was Monday, two sons and a daughter.

   An illegitimate child is at the center of
a legal tangle preventing the state from auctioning more than
$500,000 in logging equipment confiscated from a drug trafficker.
   Robert ``Slim'' Hamilton, 52, head of a narcotics ring broken up
last year, signed a court agreement a year ago, before he was
sentenced to 50 years in prison, to provide $420,000 for support of
the child he says is his.
   But prosecutors say Hamilton signed the agreement to avoid
having his property seized under a 1983 law that allows authorities
to confiscate assets used in drug operations or bought with drug
profits.
   The district attorney's office is challenging the agreement in
court.
   The assets include bulldozers, flatbed trailers, pickup trucks,
a tool truck, three other large trucks and log-loading equipment.
   Between Hamilton's indictment and conviction, a woman claimed in
court that he was the father of her child and asked for child
support. Hamilton agreed he was the father and consented to provide
$420,000 in past, present and future support.
   The district's attorney office is asking that a judge declare
the agreement invalid because it was done to protect his assets.
   No hearing date is set on that motion.

<TEXT>
   An activist group asked a court Tuesday to
implement a 1988 judgment ordering Union Carbide Corp. to pay $147
million as interim compensation to victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas
disaster.
   A petition filed in Bhopal District Court by the Poisonous Gas
Episode Struggle Front demanded implementation of an April 4, 1988,
order issued by the Madhya Pradesh State High Court at Jabalpur.
   That case had originated in the District Court at Bhopal, the
capital of Madhya Pradesh, and the site of a massive gas leak on
Dec. 3, 1984, from a pesticide plant run by Union Carbide's Indian
subsidiary.
   At least 3,598 people were fatally injured and 20,000 others
suffered ill effects from the methyl isocynate gas that spewed from
the factory yards away from shantytowns housing tens of thousands
of people.
   Vibhuti Jha, the front's lawyer, said the petition sought the
implementation of the High Court order for $147 million in interim
relief. Jha said the relief order was now worth about $198 million
because of accrued interest.
   The Bhopal District Court took no immediate action on the
petition.
   It was not clear if the petition was vaild because all previous
and prospective damages suits were anulled by a settlement approved
by the Indian Supreme Court on Feb. 14, 1989.
   Union Carbide had deposited the settlement amount with the
Supreme Court in compensation for the disaster, but the money has
not been distributed because of various challenges.
   The settlement had been concluded by Union Carbide and the
former government of Rajiv Gandhi. Last week, the new government of
Prime Minister V.P. Singh said it backed victims' claims that the
compensation amount was too small.
   Gas victims and activists charged that Gandhi government had no
right to declare itself the sole representative of all claims and
that the settlement itself was unfair.
   On Dec. 22, the Supreme Court ruled that the government did have
the right to be the claimants' sole representative. The claim that
the settlement was unfair is still pending before the Supreme Court
in New Delhi.
   Union Carbide said Monday the settlement remains binding even
though the new Indian government has disavowed it. ``There is
simply no basis for overturning it,'' Joseph E. Geoghan, Union
Carbide vice president and general counsel, said at the company's
headquarters in Danbury, Conn.
   At least 500,000 people have asked for compensation, according
to Madhya Pradesh state officials processing the claims.

   Too much cruising along the Modesto strip
that inspired George Lucas to film ``American Graffiti'' has led
city officials to propose banning it.
   City officials have drafted ordinances that would prevent anyone
from driving by certain checkpoints along McHenry Avenue more than
once in four hours. Another ordinance would make it illegal to
loiter at night along streets in this city 90 miles southeast of
San Francisco.
   The ordinances, which have not yet come before the City Council,
were spurred by Police Chief Gerald McKenzie saying up to 5,000
cars cruise McHenry some evenings.
   ``The threat of civil unrest is very real and demands our
attention and best efforts to avert a disaster,'' McKenzie wrote
the city manager.
   Lucas, who grew up in Modesto, based ``American Graffiti'' on a
fictional night in 1962 of cruising 10th Street and McHenry Avenue.
Lucas is famous for the ``Star Wars'' trilogy.
   The popularity of the 1973 movie has led to thousands of
youngsters descending on McHenry the first Saturday evening after
high school is out in June to celebrate ``Graffiti Night.''

<TEXT>
   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz clambered up the creaking
stairs he last walked down as a toddler when his family fled the
Nazis 56 years ago.
   Revisiting the Berlin house in which his parents lived until he
was nearly 3, Boschwitz recalled the day of Jan. 30, 1933.
   ``The same day, my father came home and told my mother we would
leave,'' the Minnesota Republican said Tuesday. ``And we went
within six months.''
   Boschwitz said the trigger for returning to his birthplace was
the opening of the Berlin Wall.
   ``I've never been back,'' he said. ``With the reunification, for
many practical purposes, of the city and maybe because I'm getting
a little older, I had a yen to take a look at my roots.''
   He and his parents, both Polish-born Jews, fled Berlin for
Czechoslovakia in the summer of 1933 and ended up in New York,
where Boschwitz spent the first three decades of his life.
   While Boschwitz, 59, tried to piece together memories from his
Berlin days, the past was vivid for Frank Schiff, a childhood
friend who lived in the same house and whom Boschwitz met again by
chance years later.
   ``It looks very familiar,'' Schiff said, once inside the
1915-vintage art deco apartment building.
   The house, on busy Hohenzollerndamm avenue, is in what is now a
West Berlin residential area that emerged relatively unscathed from
fierce fighting at the end of World War II.
   ``It was very pleasant here before the Hitler period,'' said
Schiff, a 68-year-old retired economist from Alexandria, Va. A
German Jew, he too was uprooted and fled with his family to the
United States in 1936.
   Boschwitz returned on a rainy day to a city that was extensively
rebuilt after the war. ``It's a nice place,'' was his first
impression.
   West German businessman Eberhard Naundorf and his wife,
Christine, said they were glad to welcome Boschwitz back into the
apartment they now rent.
   ``The war has created so many people who try to find their
roots,'' said Mrs. Naundorf, herself of Polish-German descent.
   On a four-day trip to Germany, Boschwitz visited the Berlin Wall
after arriving Monday. He chipped out a few pieces.
   East Germany opened the wall along with its other western
borders on Nov. 9, under massive pressure from street demonstrators
and an exodus of tens of thousands of its citizens.
   In a sign of the changing times, Boschwitz was due to meet East
German Foreign Minister Oskar Fischer and opposition groups, and
tour East Berlin. He also will meet with Minnesota soldiers
stationed in West Berlin.

   Democrat James Florio was sworn in as New
Jersey's 49th governor today and called for a special session of
the Legislature to bring down some of the highest auto insurance
rates in the nation.
   The eight-term congressman from southern New Jersey took the
oath of office just after noon after resigning his House seat.
   Florio succeeded the enormously popular Thomas Kean on a day of
prayers, parades and platitudes and inherited deep problems that
stand to make his first year in office a trying one. Kean, a
Republican, was barred from seeking a third straight term.
   ``Let me tell you now that my goal is a simple one: When I leave
here, I want to be remembered as the governor who brought new ideas
to preserve old ideals,'' Florio said.
   Backing up a campaign pledge to attack auto insurance rates
averaging about $1,000 per car, Florio in his inaugural address
called for a special session of the Legislature on Monday but gave
no hint as to how he would bring down premiums.
   ``We will bring back fairness to a system that has abused the
drivers of New Jersey for too long,'' Florio declared.
   He also avoided other problems confronting his administration,
such as a mounting revenue shortfall and burdensome property taxes.
   Florio was elected in November, scoring a wide margin of victory
over Rep. James Courter, R-N.J. It was Florio's third try at the
state's highest office. In 1981, he lost to Kean by the smallest
margin ever in a New Jersey gubernatorial election.
   A special election must be held to replace Florio in Congress.
No date has been set.

   A judge in a landmark housing discrimination case
approved a settlement today that will allow construction of a group
home for retarded people in suburban Chicago Heights.
   U.S. District Judge William T. Hart approved a consent agreement
requiring the suburb to issue a previously denied permit for
construction of the home by Residential Facilities Management
Services Inc. of Galesburg.
   The city, while not admitting to any discrimination, also agreed
to pay $45,000 in damages _ $30,000 to RFMS for construction delays
and $1,000 to each of the 15 people who will eventually live in the
home.
   The agreement settles lawsuits filed last summer by RFMS and the
U.S. Justice Department under a Fair Housing Act amendment, passed
in March, barring discrimination against the handicapped.
   At issue was a May 1 vote by Chicago Heights City Council
denying the permit for the home. The lawsuits contended the City
Council was motivated by opposition from residents fearful of and
prejudiced against the retarded.
   The Justice Department lawsuit was the first case brought by the
government under the Fair Housing amendment.
   ``Our hope is that this (agreement) will be noted by other
communities, not only in the Chicago metropolitan area of Illinois,
but nationwide _ that it's impermissible for them to deny access to
living accomodations on behalf of developmentally disabled
persons,'' said Richard E. Friedman, attorney for RFMS. The company
operates 55 group homes in 35 other Illinois communities.
   Justice Department spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade said the
settlement may make it easier for the government to obtain court
orders in future cases involving the refusal of local governments
to grant permits for group homes.
   Department lawyers were considering legal action elsewhere as
well but chose to await the results of the Chicago Heights case,
she said. The settlement should also encourage cities to comply
with federal law, she said.
   Chicago Heights maintained the permit was denied because RFMS
had not supplied necessary documents with its application.
   ``The fact that the inhabitants happened to be developmentally
disabled was not a factor,'' said the suburb's attorney, Nick J. Di
Giovanni.
   Under the agreement, the company pledged that the home will not
be used to care for mentally ill or emotionally disturbed patients.
   ``We hope other communities will get the message that the
handicapped have rights under the Fair Housing Act,'' said James P.
Turner, acting head of the Justice Department's civil rights
division. ``If local officials don't pay attention to those rights,
they will pay damages for violating them.''
   Turner credited Chicago Heights officials with ``seeing that it
was not in the city's best interests to continue fighting this
lawsuit.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush said today she thinks women
should be allowed to serve in combat if they are physically strong
enough because ``certainly emotionally and mentally they are more
than able to compete with a man.''
   Mrs. Bush answered with a ``qualified yes'' when asked in an
interview whether women should serve in combat.
   ``If I thought a woman physically could pick up someone who was
wounded and carry them to safety, if I thought they could throw a
hand grenade as far as a man, then I would say fine. Because I
think certainly emotionally and mentally they are more than able to
compete with a man.''
   ``They can shoot as well. They can fly as well. The only problem
I would have is if it risks somebody else's life because they
couldn't throw a hand grenade as far or carry (someone), that would
be the only thing.''
   President Bush has said he would be willing to listen to
recommendations from the Pentagon about the possibility of women
serving in combat, but that the women who fought in Panama were not
in combat roles.
   In the U.S. Panama invasion, women were not assigned to combat
units, but some found themselves under fire in performing support
duties.
   The first lady also said she helped Bush keep the invasion of
Panama secret. She said she was told about it the day of the
invasion, before it happened, but ``I knew something was going on''
a few days ahead because of all the presidential advisers who were
coming and going from the White House.
   When deposed Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega finally surrendeered to
U.S. forces, after several tense days in the Vatican embassy in
Panama City, Mrs. Bush said the president ``came racing through and
said, `We got him'.''
   ``I'd say he was pleased, pleased that it was over without more
bloodshed,'' she said.
   She said she has been ``a little testy'' about all the letters
she receives from people who don't think it's safe for the
president to attend the upcoming drug summit in violence-torn
Colombia.
   She said she would prefer that the summit be elsewhere _ ``I
wish it would be right here'' _ but ``I can't change his mind or
make those decisions ... I have no input on that.''
   Asked about her health, Mrs. Bush said she was ``cautiously
optimistic'' that her recent series of radiation treatments would
cure the irritated eyes and double vision she suffers as a result
of Graves disease, an immune system disorder.
   She said she still is having trouble, but that ``I'm so eager to
be better that I think I'm better.''

   Three parents who let their daughters
skip school for a rock concert have volunteered to serve detention
time in the principal's office in place of their children.
   ``I'm 33 years old and I'm taking my first detention ever,''
Chris Thompson said. ``Everyone I've told this to thinks it's the
funniest thing they ever heard.''
   Mrs. Thompson, her husband, Paul, and a neighbor, Colleen
Lupiezowiec, said they will serve their daughters' detention time
Wednesday when the students are off from school because of an
administrative day.
   They said they allowed their daughters, junior high school
students, to take a day off so they could attend a concert in
Milwaukee by New Kids on the Block.
   The concert was not scheduled to begin until 7 p.m., but Ms.
Lupiezowiec said she and the children left in the early afternoon
because she had business to conduct in Milwaukee, about 70 east.
   Mrs. Thompson says her daughter, Melissa, was home sick in the
morning but went to the concert anyway. ``I think she would have
left if she had the plague, she was that excited about it,'' she
said.
   Michael Buehler, superintendent of Cambridge schools, said the
pupils would have been excused if they and their parents had told
the school the truth. Instead, the daughters were given detentions,
but school officials agreed to let the parents serve the time.
   ``The parents came up with a novel idea that shows
accountability and being a good role model means owning up when you
do something wrong or don't use the best of judgment,'' Buehler
said.
   Ms. Lupiezowiec said she will sit in Principal Lowell Holtz's
office for 7 hours _ 3{ hours for each for her two daughters.

<HEAD>Opening in Berlin Wall Yields Louisville Man's Lost Dog Tag</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carroll Witten has gotten a memento of
his days as a World War II prisoner of war from an East German
family _ thanks to the historic opening of the Berlin Wall.
   In 1945, a year after his B-17 bomber was shot down over
Germany, Witten and about 40 other POWs were being marched from
Poland to a POW camp at Bad Muskau, near the German-Polish border.
   During an overnight stop at a barn, Witten lost his brass POW
identification tag.
   He had all but forgotten the tag until he got a call from Berlin
last month.
   On the Sunday after the Berlin Wall was opened on Nov. 9, an
East German family visiting West Berlin for the first time
approached U.S. Army Capt. James Allen and gave him a tarnished
brass tag.
   The tag bore only a four-digit POW number and the words ``Oflag
Luft 3,'' a designation for a prison camp for air officers.
   Allen said the family told him they had found the tag in the
rubble of their old barn, which had burned in 1988.
   Using Red Cross archives, Allen traced the number to Witten, now
65.
   Witten said Allen telephoned him in early December from Berlin
and that, when asked, he could clearly remember his prisoner number.
   ``I said, `Sure, I couldn't forget it ... 4854,''' Witten said.
``He said, `You're the guy.'''
   Just before Christmas, Allen routed himself through Louisville
on a flight from West Germany and gave Witten the long-lost tag.
   ``It was a funny feeling when I held this tag in my hand
again,'' Witten reflected. ``Unbelievable.''
   Witten said Allen has promised to get the exact address of the
family who found the tag so he can get in touch with them.
   ``I want to write them, and I'd like to go back to Germany,
maybe in a year, and see them,'' he said.

<HEAD>Questions Raised Over Killing of 3 Robbery Suspects in Belfast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two plainclothes British soldiers who foiled a
weekend robbery in Belfast left behind three bodies and a tangle of
questions: Did they give a warning? Why were they there? To what
unit did they belong?
   Most crucially, witnesses claimed the soldiers kept firing after
the masked robbers lay wounded on the sidewalk. And once again, the
British government was denying that its forces in Northern Ireland
have orders to shoot to kill.
   ``I find it hard to believe that reasonable force was used,''
the Rev. Paddy McWilliams said Tuesday at the funeral one of the
victims.
   ``There is no shoot-to-kill policy for the security forces in
Northern Ireland,'' said Brian Mawhinney, a high-ranking British
official in the province. ``The only people who are conducting a
shoot-to-kill policy in the province are terrorists.''
   Such allegations go back to 1982 when six people were killed in
three separate police operations over a three-week period. All were
unarmed, although five were acknowledged to be guerrillas.
   In 1987, three Irish Republican Army members were gunned down in
Gibraltar while plotting a car bombing.
   Both incidents were followed by charges of cover-ups. The human
rights group Amnesty International told the British government last
year that official secrecy and lack of prosecutions ``would
contribute to allegations of official involvement in deliberate,
planned killings.''
   In the incident Saturday, witnesses and police agreed that two
of the slain robbers appeared to be armed and wore black ski masks
also used by IRA gunmen.
   Their guns proved to be non-working replicas of a Mauser
submachinegun and a Bruni handgun. The third victim, who was shot
as he sat in a stolen getaway car, was not masked or armed.
   Authorities have not identified the two soldiers, nor have they
said whether any warning was given. There has been no official
response to claims that two of the victims were shot as they lay on
the sidewalk.
   The government won't even identify the soldiers' unit, which is
believed to be an elite surveillance group.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force, said
the soldiers came across the incident by chance.
   ``What precisely happened next, and why, is properly the subject
of the investigation now being rigorously pursued by the RUC,''
Peter Brooke, the top British official in Northern Ireland, told
the House of Commons on Monday.
   Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political wing, claimed Saturday
there had been intensive security force operations in the area the
day before the shootings. Press Association, Britain's domestic
news agency, said Tuesday that government sources had confirmed
reports by witnesses that two more soldiers were at the scene.
   The RUC said Tuesday it had arrested a fourth robbery suspect,
who reportedly hid in the betting shop and slipped away before
police arrived.
   The dead men all had criminal records. Edward Paul Hale, 21, who
was buried Tuesday, had two convictions. He had also been shot in
the elbows, knees and ankles by the IRA in 1987 for ``anti-social
actions.''
   Peter James Thompson, 21, the other masked man, had a record of
six convictions and the man in the car, Joseph McNeil, 42, had 28
convictions, police said.
   Within hours of the incident, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams
issued a statement accusing the security forces of ``coldblooded
murder.''
   Spokesmen for the Social Democratic and Labor Party, the largest
mainly Roman Catholic party in Northern Ireland, also called the
shootings unjustified. The Irish government is demanding an
explanation.
   Defenders of the security forces said the incident had to be
seen in the context of Northern Ireland's intractable strife.
   ``Security officers do not get a second chance from the IRA, and
it must be considered a reasonable action on the part of security
forces when confronting those who present themselves as armed to
safeguard lives by shooting them,'' said Peter Robinson, deputy
leader of the Rev. Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party.
   In two decades, 870 members of the army, the RUC and the Ulster
Defense Regiment have been killed in Northern Ireland.
   John Stalker, an English police official assigned to investigate
the 1982 killings, recommended prosecuting 11 RUC officials, and
instead was removed from the case.
   He said he reached no conclusion about the existence of a
``shoot-to-kill'' policy, but said in 1988 that the circumstances
``pointed to a police inclination, if not a policy, to shoot
suspects dead without warning rather than to arrest them.''

International Airport
   ``We're fogged in on every front,'' said Lisa Howard, a
spokeswoman for the city's aviation department. O'Hare, considered
the nation's busiest airport, is a hub for a large segment of the
nation's east-west air traffic.
   Many inbound flights were 30 minutes to an hour late at O'Hare,
Ms. Howard said. United Airlines canceled 14 flights from O'Hare,
and there were scattered cancellations by other airlines, she said.
   Flights in and out of Midway were put on hold at about 7:15 a.m.
   Midway Airlines and its Midway Commuter, whose flights make up
about 70 percent of the traffic out of Midway Airport, said the
carrier had canceled 146 flights by noon, said airline spokeswoman
Roseanne White.
   The National Weather Service reported dense fog throughout much

<HEAD>Medical Experts Slam `Racist' AIDS Pamphlets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pamphlets claiming whites will
be wiped out by AIDS unless they isolate themselves from blacks
have been condemned by medical experts as a right-wing plot to
create public hysteria.
   Hundreds of the ``Facts on AIDS'' pamphlets have been
distributed in areas around Johannesburg recently by a group urging
whites to ``save the white race from extinction.'' AIDS experts say
the pamphlets are completely misleading and are intended to create
fear and racial tension.
   Police said Tuesday the pamphlets had not caused any problems
and they could not take action against the unknown authors because
no public complaints had been received.
   ``We could not do anything until there was evidence it was
subvertng public morals,'' a police spokesman said.
   The pamphlets claim that AIDS can be spread by casual contact,
including via toilet seats, swimming pools, multiracial churches,
multiracial hotels and distribution of communion wafers during
church services.
   The pamphlets appeared at a time when the South African
government is moving to desegregate some public facilities as part
of its stated aim of ending apartheid. Many whites strongly oppose
the attempts to end desegregation in public facilities.
   Dr. Dennnis Sifris, a senior AIDS specialist at Johannesburg
Hospital, said the pamphlet was ``ridiculous'' and completely
misleading.
   ``It's obviously put out by an extreme lunatic fringe group who
are trying to scare everyone,'' he said.
   The three-page pamphlets produced by a previously unknown group
called the AIDS Information Distributing Society claim many South
African blacks have acquired immune deficiency syndrome and whites
must protect themselves from infection.
   Whites are urged to avoid areas where the races mingle, such as
integrated hotels and churches, and to have black servants tested
each month to ensure they do not have AIDS.
   The South African government used to claim that the African
National Congress, the main black political movement, was bringing
AIDS into the country when its infected guerrillas infiltrated
across the border. The claims have been dropped as the government
has taken a more moderate position on dealing with the ANC.
   Professor Ruben Sher, head of the South African Medical Research
Council's Aids Center, said the pamphlets make erroneous claims,
including assertions that AIDS is spread by casual contact and
through mosquito bites.
   Sher also criticized the pamphlets' suggestion that whites make
their black servants take regular monthly tests to ensure they do
not have AIDS. ``This is a blatant racial slur,'' Sher said.
   Johannesburg newspapers said nothing was known about the group
behind the pamphlets.
   South Africa has reported about 300 AIDS cases among whites,
with an unknown number of people afflicted by the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.
   Although no firm statistics are available, AIDS is thought to be
more widespread among blacks, reflecting the major spread of the
disease among heterosexuals in some other African nations.
   Scientists say AIDS is spread by sexual intercourse, through
contaminated blood or syringe needles, and through infected mothers
to unborn children.

   The Trident 2 missile program
Tuesday had its fifth consecutive successful test launch of the
Navy's newest and most powerful weapon.
   The submarine Tennessee, cruising under the ocean about 200
miles offshore, fired the unarmed 44-foot missile about 11 a.m.
EST, sending it to an ocean target several thousand miles down the
Atlantic tracking range.
   The Tennessee is expected to fire one more test missile this
week before the Trident 2 is pronounced operational, overcoming two
fiery failures in its first three launch attempts.
   Each Trident 2 sub will carry 24 of the missiles, each capable
of delivering up to 12 nuclear warheads to different targets more
than 5,000 miles away.
   Greenpeace anti-nuclear activists who halted a Trident 2 launch
by penetrating the launch zone last July were not present this week.

<TEXT>
   More than 100,000 ethnic Germans plan
to emigrate from Romania to West Germany despite the fall of
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Tuesday.
   Genscher met Monday and Tuesday with leaders of the ethnic
German community, and he said they told him that between 60 percent
and 80 percent of Romania's 220,000 ethnic Germans would take
advantage of the lifting of emigration restrictions enforced by the
Ceausescu regime.
   The ethnic Germans, as well as other minority groups like the
Hungarians and Serbs, were persecuted under Ceausescu's forced
assimilation policy.
   Since 1978, Bonn has paid an average of about $5,900 to the
Romanian government for each of about 130,000 ethnic Germans
allowed to emigrate to West Germany.
   Most of the Germans in Romania are descendants of immigrants
from the German provinces of Swabia and Saxony who settled in the
rich farming lands of what is now Romania starting in the 13th
century.
   Genscher said Monday that about 80 percent of Romania's Germans
had applied for exit visas during the Ceausescu years.
   During his trip to Romania, Genscher has stressed the importance
of the governing National Salvation Front Council quickly creating
trust among minority groups in democratic developments, and ending
discrimination against the German ethnic minority.
   Genscher said that although the West German government wants the
living conditions of the Germans improved, Germany would welcome
any who wanted to emigrate.

<HEAD>Cuomo Unveils $51.3 Billion Budget; Calls For Tax Cut Delay</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, unveiling a $51.3 billion
state budget, today called for about $700 million in higher taxes
and fees and proposed that New Yorkers forgo a promised income tax
cut in 1990-91.
   Cuomo, a second-term Democrat considered a potential 1992
presidential contender, said New York needs the extra money to deal
with budget deficits and combat drug abuse and AIDS.
   New York's tax revenue has been hurt by earlier tax cuts and an
economic slowdown in the Northeast, he said.
   Under his spending plan, the overall budget would grow 9.3
percent. Included in his proposal for additional revenue was a call
for an increase in the cigarette tax of 5 cents a pack to 38 cents.
   In October, the state's maximum income tax rate is scheduled to
drop from 7.5 percent to 7 percent unless Cuomo gets his way. With
or without the drop, New York's rates would still be the highest in
the Northeast.
   Republicans and business leaders have argued that the final
phase of the four-year tax cut approved by Cuomo and the
Legislature in 1987 must be preserved. Liberal Democrats and social
service advocates have said the state needs the money.
   The final phase of the tax cut would translate into a savings of
$134 this year for a family of four with two wage earners and an
annual taxable income of $50,000, according to state officials.
   Freezing the tax cut could provide the state treasury with an
extra $400 million for the fiscal year that begins April 1.

   The Kremlin today sent thousands of reinforcements
to enforce a state of emergency in parts of the southern Caucasus,
where fierce battles raged between hundreds of well-armed
Azerbaijanis and Armenians.
   At least 56 people have been killed and 156 injured in ethnic
strife in the republic of Azerbaijan since Thursday, Interior
Ministry spokesman Vladimir A. Yanchenkov said today.
   Yanchenkov told a briefing that authorities had recorded 167
``pogroms'' and cases of arson. Civilians, mostly Armenians, are
said to have been murdered at random in ethnically motivated
attacks that provoked the gun battles.
   Soviet TV reported tonight that more than 5,000 Soviet Army
soldiers and 6,000 internal security troops had been dispatched as
reinforcements to the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh in
Azerbaijan and in the neighboring republic of Armenia.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Soviet Presidium
proclaimed a state of emergency Monday night, empowering the
government to use units of the Soviet Army, Navy and KGB to put
down the ethnic unrest. It was not known how many troops were sent
to the region since ethnic clashes began Saturday.
   The official news agency Tass said 2,000 people armed with
anti-aircraft guns and other artillery today were massed on hills
around the disputed region.
   ``We can't bring ourselves to pronounce it aloud, but what is
happening now in Karabakh, in northern Azerbaijan, can be termed
unambiguously a civil war,'' correspondent O. Shapovalov wrote in
the youth daily Komsomolskaya Pravda.
   Others likened the bloodletting to the combat of World War II.
   The Soviet Interior Ministry reported that armed bands had
seized grenades, and machine guns from military posts and had
commandeered armored vehicles and helicopters.
   News reports described ``open armed clashes'' in the region,
with 300 gunmen fighting in one battle and trenches being dug and
other fortifications built to defend villages from attack.
   Foreign reporters were not allowed into the region.
   Soviet media reported anarchy in many areas, with combatants
taking hostages, and said government troops trying to get to areas
of combat were being delayed by crowds of people who were blocking
roads.
   The state of emergency empowers local officials to ban
demonstrations and strikes, impose curfews, censor the media,
confiscate weapons and disband unofficial organizations.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told reporters
the measures were aimed only at protecting people and had no
political overtones.
   ``I would not interpret this step as being at odds with glasnost
and democracy,'' he told a briefing. ``On the contrary, the step
opposes anarchy.''
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
the declaration was necessary. ``We understand the need to
establish order in a situation where order has broken down,'' he
said.
   The flareup is the most violent between mainly Moslem
Azerbaijanis and mostly Christian Armenians since their decades-old
feud over the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan erupted in
bloody clashes two years ago.
   The predominantly Armenian region has been ruled by Azerbaijan
since 1923.
   Turkey said today that its armed forces had tightened security
along the country's border with the Soviet Union. It did not
elaborate. The Soviet Azerbaijanis are a Turkish-speaking ethnic
group with close cultural and historical ties to Turkey.
   Azerbaijanis were said today to be continuing a virtual rail
blockade of Armenia's 3.5 million people, cutting short fuel and
other supplies.
   The official Tass news agency said the state of emergency means
regular Red Army units and KGB troops now will be used to protect
residents of the strife-torn area and vital installations like
railroads.
   Detachments of security troops today patrolled Baku, the
Azerbaijani capital where the violence exploded Saturday night with
an anti-Armenian riot, and armored personnel carriers moved through
the suburbs, activist Alesker Siyabov said by telephone.
   About 400,000 Armenians rallied Monday in Yerevan, the capital
of their republic, and groups of young men were volunteering to go
off and fight the Azerbaijanis, an one editor at the Armenian news
agency Armenpress said today.
   Gorbachev on Sunday sent high-level troubleshooters and
additional troops to the mountainous region 1,240 miles southeast
of Moscow to try to end the fighting in Azerbaijan, a republic of
6.9 million people.
   Moscow-based foreign correspondents were told Monday by Foreign
Ministry officials they would not be permitted to travel to
Azerbaijan or Armenia.
   Tass said Armenians and Azerbaijanis with submachine guns were
waging ``open armed clashes' in Azerbaijan's Khanlar region, near
Nagorno-Karabakh. In the nearby Shaumyan region, 300 gunmen fought
in one battle, TV news said.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said the belligerents were
using helicopters without markings and armored vehicles captured
from military bases.
   Izvestia said at least 33 people had died in anti-Armenian
rampages in Baku, a Caspian Sea port of 1.7 million and
oil-producing center, but that the figure could rise. Tass said
2,000 Armenians were evacuated by ferry and plane from the city and
that of the capital's 220,000 residents, only a few thousand
remained.
   Gorbachev's greater tolerance for dissent has encouraged many
Soviet ethnic groups to make demands they long suppressed. But that
has often led to violent conflict in the nation of more than 100
nationalities, many of whom harbor age-old grudges.
   The last major rioting sparked by the Nagorno-Karabakh feud was
in February 1988, when Azerbaijanis attacked Armenians in Sumgait,
near Baku. Thirty-two people died, most of them Armenians.
   More than 200 have since been reported killed.

   Cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich and
his wife, opera singer Galina Vishnevskaya, have had their Soviet
citizenship restored to them 12 years after the government took it
away, Tass reported Tuesday.
   The Soviet legislature gave them back their citizenship and also
nullified the decree that stripped them of all their medals and
honorary titles, the official news agency said.
   Rostropovich, 62, gained international renown with the Moscow
Philharmonic Orchestra, but in the early 1970s he incurred the
Soviet government's disfavor by giving refuge to dissident author
Alexander Solzhenitsyn. He left the Soviet Union with his family
and was stripped of his citizenship in 1978.
   He has since become a household name in the West. Queen
Elizabeth II conferred a knighthood on him in 1987 on his 60th
birthday.
   Several other prominent Soviet cultural figures who lost their
citizenship under past regimes have had it restored in recent
months amid the cultural thaw that prevails under Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Solzhenitsyn is a notable exception; Soviet officials say they
have not received any application from him to have his citizenship
restored.

<TEXT>
   The grandson of Mohandas Gandhi says the
U.S. civil rights movement lost direction after the assassination
of Martin Luther King Jr. as its leaders settled for equal legal
status for minorities.
   Arun Manilal Gandhi said Monday that King dreamed of a society
in which people were judged by character rather than skin color and
everyone lived together in harmony.
   But equality under the law is vastly different because people
can be considered equal but remain separate, he said.
   ``That's the great tragedy of the movement here,'' Gandhi said
in comments at a conference called Erasing Racism at Lakeland
College. ``It got waylaid and settled for equality'' under the law.
   He said King understood and practiced the non-violent philosophy
that his grandfather, who helped free India from British control
through non-violent resistance, was trying to teach the world.
   He said there is not a single place in the world where racism,
prejudice and hatred did not exist.
   ``It's very sad,'' Gandhi said. ``But it doesn't mean we can't
do something about it.''
   Gandhi, 56, is working with the University of Mississippi's
Center for the Study of Southern Culture in Oxford, Miss.

   The revolution reached chilly
university classrooms Tuesday with students demanding the firing of
professors regarded more for their knowledge of Communism than of
physics or chemistry.
   Notices pasted on doorways at Bucharest's Polytechnic University
called for required military courses for women to be dropped and
for student votes on the competency of teachers. Students also
demanded an end to required courses on Marxism.
   In dormitories, students sought to get rid of residents
suspected of having informed for the deposed government.
   The fervent debates on student rights were reminiscent of the
United States in the 1960s, when college students demonstrated for
more control over what they were taught and by whom.
   But the Romanian students' meetings and petitions also mirrored
the string of public denunciations that have arisen since dictator
Nicolae Ceaucescu was overthrown Dec. 22.
   Newspapers have denounced everyone in turn, from Ceausescu to
the interim leaders and in one case even the head of a small farm
cooperative accused of buying a university diploma with 200 pigs.
   In the Polytechnic's physics department, students were signing
petitions Tuesday to demand the ouster of a professor named Ilie
Cucurezeanu.
   ``In his lectures he started by explaining Communist ideology,
but he couldn't explain physics,'' said Daniel Florescu, a
second-year student from Bucharest.
   Roxana Mitroi, 20, from Romanian Moldavia, said Cucurezeanu
often asked students who gave incorrect answers, ``What kind of
Communist are you?''
   Florescu, 22, said the second-year physics students had met with
the department dean, who promised to cooperate with them.
   Dean Juliet Floria said she told students she would submit their
request for Cucurezeanu dissmisal to the faculty, along with a
suggestion that his upcoming exam for second-year students be
reviewed by a professorial committee.
   ``It will be up to the faculty to decide,'' she said, but added
the students' demands have to be addressed.
   Cucurezeanu took another view. ``We don't have to bend our ears
to students' talk,'' he said.
   Wrapped in a coat and scarf in his sparsely heated office,
Cucurezeanu denied he infused his courses with talk of Communism
and offered to produce documents from the Ministry of Education,
issued under the ousted regime, testifying to his credentials.
   He maintained only second-year students wanted him fired because
they'd become caught up in last month's revolution and had not
studied enough for his exam.
   ``Until now, I never had problems with students,'' he said.
However, hundreds of signatures on the petitions were from
third-and fourth-year students not facing Cucurezeanu's exam.
   Students said that in other departments of Polytechnic, a
sprawling campus with nearly 30,000 students, efforts also were
under way to dismiss professors viewed as incompetent or Communist
Party apparatchiks.
   At Bucharest University, students were making similar moves.
There are factions in the language department for and against the
firing of Michaela Ceausescu, a niece of the late dictator, as a
professor of Russian. The issue has been submitted to the central
administration for a decision.
   At Polytechnic, student Sorin Popao said dormitories were
organizing to get rid of suspected informers, often non-students
who lived in the dorms as administrators or staff.
   ``In my dorm, we confronted two of them in the hall last
night,'' said Popao, 22, of the town of Baia Mare.
   ``It started with a couple of us and one of them said, 'No not
me, you people are the informers,''' Popao said.
   ``But,'' he said, ``when a crowd gathered, the same person said,
`The police called me and asked for information. What could I do?'''
   Florescu said one major demand was getting rid of the political
content of such courses as history, politics and economics and
dropping the required course on Marxist philosophy.
   ``This Marxist philosophy should be replaced by optional courses
on politics that haven't been taught here for 40 or 45 years,'' he
said. ``We don't know anything about practical politics, about
democracy. It's a national problem.''
   Asked if there was anything else the students wanted, Florescu
thought for a moment and said with a chuckle, ``A McDonald's.''

   The Supreme Court was urged Tuesday to help
consumers and to foster business competition by allowing states and
private citizens to use federal antitrust law to break up corporate
mergers.
   The California attorney general's office argued that the Clayton
Act, passed in 1914 when Congress was preoccupied with trust
busting on a national scale, empowers the state to challenge a $2.5
billion merger of the Lucky and Alpha Beta supermarket chains.
   Less competition in the industry, leading to higher grocery
bills for consumers, will result from the merger, said Deputy
California Attorney General H. Chester Horn Jr.
   ``The injury threatened by this merger is precisely the one (the
Clayton Act) was designed to prevent,'' he said.
   But Rex E. Lee, representing the supermarket chains, said only
the federal government is empowered by the 1914 law to force
divestiture in a completed merger.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said, ``Most of these (mergers) are
handled before a state or private person knows the acquisition is
taking place.''
   She asked Lee whether he believed, therefore, that states and
individuals would be powerless under federal law to break up such
mergers.
   ``That is exactly what Congress intended,'' Lee replied. ``It is
is the change in status we are talking about'' from two independent
companies to a unified structure, he said.
   Breaking up the structure ``is something the (federal)
government can do and no one else,'' Lee said.
   Lucky, California's largest supermarket chain, and Alpha Beta,
the fourth largest, operate 550 stores between them.
   Alpha Beta's parent company, American Stores, acquired Lucky in
June 1988 to merge the two chains under the Lucky name.
   American Stores said California customers would save more than
$40 million a year because of increased efficiency. But the
California attorney general's office said the merger will mean less
competition and will lead to $440 million in higher prices each
year.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon in Los Angeles temporarily
blocked the merger in 1988 and ordered continued separate operation
of the two chains pending further court action.
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the judge's
ruling.
   The appeals court said the state, had it moved quickly enough,
could have prevented the merger. But the appeals court said only
the federal government has the power to break up completed mergers.
   The Federal Trade Commission temporarily blocked the acquisition
in 1988 but later reached an agreement with the corporations
allowing the deal as long as certain conditions were met.
   Much of the hour-long arguments before the high court Tuesday
focused on the intentions of the Clayton Act's drafters 76 years
ago.
   Lee referred to testimony before a congressional committee by
Louis D. Brandeis, a lawyer who represented President Wilson's
administration two years before Brandeis was appointed to the
Supreme Court.
   Brandeis made it clear the administration was proposing
legislation that would give the federal government and no one else
power to dissolve a merger, Lee said.
   But Horn argued that Brandeis and the congressmen ``were
discussing a much different bill than the one that was introduced''
and became the Clayton Act.
   Brandeis was saying only that the power ``to attack the
nationwide trusts belonged in the hands of the federal
government,'' not other corporate mergers, Horn said.
   The case is California vs. American Stores, 89-258.

   Actor Tom Cruise and actress-wife Mimi Rogers
are calling it quits after nearly three years of marriage.
   ``We have decided to file for divorce,'' the couple said Tuesday
in a joint statement from publicist Andrea Jaffe.
   Cruise, 27, and Miss Rogers, 33, were married May 9, 1987, with
actor Emilio Estevez as best man.
   ``While there have been very positive aspects to our marriage,
there were some issues which could not be resolved even after
working on them for a period of time,'' the couple's statement
said, without elaboration.
   Cruise, star of the movie ``Top Gun,'' ``The Color of Money,''
``Taps,'' ``The Outsiders,'' ``Risky Business,'' ``Rain Man'' and
the current box-office hit ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' added a
personal statement.
   ``This has been a time when I have been the focus of much
attention,'' he said. ``When I was asked direct questions by the
press about my marriage, I felt that to compromise our privacy was
to compromise a basic trust.
   ``I hope that can be understood.''
   Miss Rogers starred in the movies ``Gung Ho,'' ``Streetwise''
and ``Someone to Watch Over Me.''

   Bjorn Borg went to court Tuesday to
face an $82 million business lawsuit in the first of five cases the
former tennis star has scheduled for this year.
   Borg's other cases involve three libel actions and a custody
battle with the mother of his 4-year-old son, Robin, the Swedish
news agency TT said.
   The multimillion dollar lawsuit was brought by Lars Skarke,
Borg's former partner and managing director of the Bjorn Borg
Design Group, a fashion business that went bankrupt last summer.
Skarke claims Borg violated a shareholder agreement.
   ``Borg denies all allegations. If anyone has caused damage it is
Skarke. He has caused the company great damage through managing it
miserably,'' Borg's lawyer, Henning Sjostrom, told TT.
   Next week Borg is bringing a $600,000 lawsuit against the
monthly magazine Z for publishing allegations that he used cocaine
by ex-girlfriend Jannike Bjorling, whom Borg is fighting over
custory of his son.
   Borg also sued Z for selling T-shirts with the text ``Bjorn Borg
Collection'' _ an allusion to his fashion empire _ with portraits
of Ms. Bjorling, former wife Mariana and his current wife Loredana.
   He also has sued a gossip weekly for alleging that his
relationship has broken up with the Italian rock singer whom he
married in September. Mrs. Borg has sued a Swedish magazine for
publishing nude pictures of her, TT said.

   Sylvester Stallone is back in Rocky land
filming still another sequel to the come-from-behind boxing movies
that made him famous.
   Filming started Monday on ``Rocky V,'' focusing on the
neighborhood of movie boxing legend Rocky Balboa in South
Philadelphia.
   The original ``Rocky,'' winner of the 1976 Academy Award for
best picture, showed Balboa running through the Italian Market and
up the steps of the Art Museum.
   Philadelphia was featured less prominently in the sequels, with
none of ``Rocky IV'' filmed here.
   During the six weeks of filming, Stallone will be joined by
Talia Shire, who plays Rocky's devoted wife, Adrian. Burt Young
also returns as Paulie, Rocky's supportive but mooching
brother-in-law.

   Actress Valerie Harper says there's no bad
blood, but after winning a lawsuit over her firing from a
television show, she's back on the airwaves in a head-to-head time
slot.
   The former star of ``Valerie,'' the sitcom that fired her for
alleged prima donna behavior, returns in the CBS-TV comedy ``City''
on Jan. 29.
   She's playing opposite NBC-TV's ``The Hogan Family,'' first
called ``Valerie'' and later ``Valerie's Family.'' The show starred
Miss Harper until she was fired in 1987 and Sandy Duncan was chosen
to replace her.
   Miss Harper won $1.4 million for lost wages and another $220,000
went to Harper's husband, Tony Cacciotti, who was the show's
co-executive producer. The court also gave the couple profit
participation that could total $15 million.
   ``I really don't feel angry or vindictive or anything toward the
people I was involved with at that time,'' Miss Harper said in a
recent interview.
   But NBC Entertainment head Brandon Tartikoff said CBS brass
threw down the gauntlet with the confrontational scheduling.
   ``I want to win this battle,'' he said in Los Angeles last week.
   Miss Harper was in ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and its spinoff
``Rhoda.''

   Comedian Dan Aykroyd of ``Blues Brothers''
fame has pitched in to help a hospital's $3 million fund-raising
drive.
   The expansion drive by St. Joseph Hospital, called ``We're on a
Mission from God,'' takes its name from the catch-phrase of the
Blues Brothers in Aykroyd's movie, in which characters played by
him and John Belushi raise money to save a Catholic orphanage.
   The comedian is allowing use of a photo taken with Sister
Annette Crone, chief executive officer of the hospital. It was
taken backstage after a Memphis appearance in September.
   The photo, in which Aykroyd wears his trademark fedora and dark
sunglasses, will be featured on T-shirts, posters and
advertisements.
   The nun had not heard of the Blues Brothers before, but someone
rented her the video after the photo was taken.
   ``She's an authority on the Blues Brothers now,'' hospital
spokeswoman Gail Cobb said Monday.

   It will be difficult to restrain Congress from
making deep unilateral troop cuts that outpace progress on a
European conventional arms treaty, a senior member of the House
Armed Services Committee said Tuesday.
   ``I'm convinced that a far-reaching conventional arms-control
agreement is within reach this year,'' Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo.,
said after returning from 10 days of talks with allied arms
negotiators and others in Europe.
   ``The worst thing we can do is to have a unilateral force cut
this year,'' he said. ``If we give the store away, why will the
Soviets want to destroy 40,000 tanks? They won't want to.''
   Skelton said there will be an attempt in Congress to ``declare
that the Cold War is over this year.''
   ``But uncertainty is just as much an enemy as the Warsaw Pact
is,'' Skelton said, adding that the United States must undertake
``a deliberate build-down'' of its forces that rests on verifiable
arms control agreements with the Soviet Union, not a unilateral
force reduction.
   Skelton and a group of committee members met in Brussels with
NATO commander Gen. John Galvin and in Vienna with Ambassador R.
James Woolsey, the chief U.S. negotiator at the Conventional Forces
in Europe arms talks.

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Communist party, in a
concession to the country's fledgling opposition, agreed Tuesday to
allow democratic groups to publish their own newspaper and said
they would be granted offices in Sofia.
   But it rejected a demand for opposition access to radio and
television, which would take democratic ideas across this largely
rural nation.
   The compromise was fashioned after the opposition threatened to
withdraw from talks with the Communists that many hope will hasten
Bulgaria's faltering transition to democracy.
   More than 50,000 people attended one of the biggest
anti-Communist demonstrations in Bulgarian history on Sunday to
back the opposition's demands for more democracy. The
demonstration, organized at two days' notice, testified to slowly
growing popular support for opposition groups still banned just
three months ago.
   Petko Simeonov, a leader of the Union of Democratic Forces, an
umbrella organization of 12 opposition parties and groups, angrily
accused the Communists of stalling on demands first raised in
November for an independent daily newspaper and for Sofia
headquarters to enable the growing but still weak opposition to
organize.
   ``For many years, we know what it means when we don't get an
answer,'' Simeonov told the Communists seated across the table in
the West Hall of the national parliament.
   ``Our slogans and our ideas do not reach everybody. We want what
we have to say to be heard by everyone,'' Simeonov said.
   Access to the media is important in Bulgaria, which is isolated
from Western and all East bloc broadcasts but Soviet ones, and
whose state-run media continue to run vitriolic attacks on
opposition figures in an attempt to discredit them with the public.
   The opposition won agreement on the daily newspaper, which it
hopes will have a print run of some 50,000 copies.
   Opposition spokesman Georgi Spassov declined to say who would
write for it or exactly when it would start to appear as the
country's first independent daily since the Communists repressed
all opposition in 1947.
   The disarray that marked the talks was played out for an hour in
front of Bulgarian and foreign journalists and illustrated the
difficulties of East Europeans trying to move from totalitarian
rule to more democracy without tools basic for the transition.
   Spassov noted that almost all buildings in Bulgaria are
controlled by the state, thus putting the opposition in the
position of begging the authorities for office space and a
telephone.
   ``Plainly speaking, we cannot exist,'' Simeonov told the
Communists.
   He asked how the opposition could be members of the negotiations
``when we have no way of meeting to discuss things beforehand? The
conditions are unfavorable, as if on purpose.''
   Andrei Lukanov, the powerful and politically skilled No. 2 to
Communist Party chief and President Petar Mladenov, argued the
ruling party had done all it could to provide offices and
newsprint. He said matters were no longer in the Communists' hands.
   ``I don't think you should be so suspicious,'' he said with a
smile to the opposition, many of whom were jailed for months or
years by the Communists.
   The two sides eventually reached agreement during a closed-door
session.
   Although the opposition's demand for live radio and television
broadcast of the talks and direct access to the electronic media
was rejected, long excerpts of the session were shown on the
evening TV news.
   According to a tentative schedule, the talks are supposed to
discuss the transition to democracy and the free elections Mladenov
has promised by May. The talks are scheduled to resume Thursday.
   The opposition seeks two-stage legislative elections in May and
November, arguing they won't have enough time or resources to
organize an adequate campaign against the Communists by May.
   The Communists, meanwhile, seem to be trying to preserve as much
power as possible, hoping they can avoid the massive loss in
authority suffered by their comrades everywhere else in Eastern
Europe.
   At least three recognizable factions have formed inside the
Communist Party, which on Jan. 30 holds a national congress that
reformers hope will see the final purge of orthodox loyalists
supporting Todor Zhivkov, the hard-line Communist leader ousted
Nov. 10 after 35 years in power.
   Some analysts believe the Communists are encouraging the
formation of reformist factions in order to attract more votes.
   Diplomats who asked not to be identified say the opposition is
growing fast as well, with the Social Democratic Party among the
fastest growing groups.
   Most of the Social Democrats' leaders were jailed, and some even
killed by the Communists in the late 1940s. But in a never
explained oversight, the party was not banned, and is said to be
attracting tens of thousands of new members.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Blast Industrial Use of Ozone-Destroying
Chemicals</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Polluted East Europe, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some major corporations are making significant
cuts in their use of three ozone-destroying chemicals, but ``the
vast majority of companies have yet to take any concrete steps to
phase them out,'' a private environmental group said Tuesday.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council produced industry figures
showing that more than 200 million pounds of the three chemicals,
which are primarily used as metal-cleaning solvents, had been
released into the atmosphere by more than 3,000 companies in 1987.
The figures were the latest comprehensive ones available.
   Responses to questionnaires sent by the group by more than 300
companies indicate that while some large polluters have reduced
their use of the chemicals and emissions, others have not.
   ``Their delays threaten the health and safety of all
Americans,'' maintained David Doniger, an attorney for the
Washington-based environmental group.
   The chemicals examined by the group are methyl chloroform and
CFC113, both of which are widely used by electronics, computer and
aerospace industries as metal-cleaning solvents, and carbon
tetrachloride, used in the United States primarily in the
manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs.
   The three chemicals are among those that when released can drift
high into the atmosphere where the chlorine component reacts with
the Earth's protective ozone layer, destroying the ozone. Past
emissions of the three chemicals currently account for more than a
third of the chlorine attacking the ozone layer, which protects the
Earth from ultraviolet rays.
   Government and industry have acknowleged that the CFCs,
including CFC113 used as a solvent, and carbon tetrachloride should
be phased out and expect their elimination by the middle or latter
part of the decade.
   But methyl chloroform, whose potency for ozone destruction is
less than 15 percent that of CFCs, remains unregulated and is
viewed by much of industry as a potential ``bridge'' chemical as
companies stop using CFCs as cleaning solvents.
   ``Methyl chloroform is part of the solution to the depletion of
stratospheric ozone ... not part of the problem,'' argued Keith
McKennon, president of Dow Chemical USA in a letter to the
environmental group.
   Dow manufactures about half of the methyl chloroform produced in
the United States. Two other leading manufacturers _ PPG Industries
Inc., and Vulcan Chemical Corp. _ made similar arguments, saying
the chemical should not be banned from use.
   But environmentalists contend that while the pound-for-pound
destructiveness of methyl chloroform may be far less than CFCs, the
chemical's widespread use causes it to be of equal concern.
   ``It is part of the problem,'' Doniger said at a news
conference, arguing that, without curbs on methyl chloroform use,
``you can't get the chlorine reductions needed'' after the year
2000 to reverse the destruction of the ozone layer.
   ``Decisions made in the boardrooms of these companies (using the
chemicals) will determine whether we succeed or fail in preventing
the first truly global environmental catastrophe,'' Doniger
continued.
   Some major users of the ozone-depleting chemicals have begun to
make sizeable cuts in the use of the three chemicals, however,
according to figures provided by the group.
   For example, Pratt &amp; Whitney, the aircraft engine manufacturer
in East Hartford, Conn., was reported to release 1.9 million pounds
of methyl chloroform, more than any other facility, in 1987, but
reported cutting emissions to 420,000 pounds in 1988.
   IBM Corp., one of the biggest users of CFC113 three years ago,
cut its emissions of the chemical at three plants in California,
New York and Minnesota by nearly one-third from 3.3 billion pounds
in 1987 to 2.3 billion pounds in 1988. Its emissions of methyl
chloroform also declined, from 1.6 million pounds to 1.2 million
pounds, according to the figures from the environmental group.
   Hercules Inc., was the leading source of carbon tetrachloride
emissions 1987 and again in 1988, when it spewed nearly 900,000
pounds of the chemical into the air from a Parlin, N.J., facility.
But the company said it stopped using the chemical altogether in
August 1989.
   But scores of smaller companies reported increases in emissions
as did AT&amp;T Technologies Inc., at Lee's Summit, Mo., where combined
CFC113 and methyl chloride emissions increased by about 40,000
pounds to 744,000 pounds in 1988, one of the highest amounts for
any facility that year.
   AT&amp;T has announced a corporate-wide goal of eliminting its
reliance on CFCs as a cleaning solvent by the mid-1990s.

<TEXT>
   Thousands rallied Tuesday in
memory of Jan Palach, the student who killed himself to protest the
1968 Soviet-led invasion, and the new president said Palach's hopes
for a free country are coming true.
   Also on Tuesday, the new non-Communist interior minister
announced the dismantling of the secret police, the latest step in
Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolution that ended four decades of
Communist rule.
   The rally in Palach's memory drew President Vaclav Havel, who
was arrested last year when he tried to lay flowers in Wenceslas
Square to honor Palach.
   Havel was sentenced to eight months in prison, released in May
and became Czechoslovakia's first non-Communist president in 41
years in December after large anti-government protests.
   ``Everything that Palach dreamt of and longed for is opening in
front of us,'' Havel said.
   ``When they arrested me in January, I had a feeling that 20
years after Palach's sacrifice, his absolute sacrifice was
beginning to gain its value. It was my feeling then, it is my
certainty now.''
   Palach burned himself to death on Jan. 16, 1969, to protest the
invasion by five Warsaw Pact countries of Czechoslovakia that
crushed the liberal ``Prague Spring'' reforms under Alexander
Dubcek.
   Havel's arrest in January 1989 sparked a weeklong wave of street
protests in Prague, with baton-wielding police using water cannon
and tear gas to disperse thousands.
   The protests led to 50,000 Czechoslovak artists and workers
signing a petition demanding Havel's release and immediate start of
genuine reform.
   Another police crackdown on student demonstrators Nov. 17 marked
the beginning of the country's peaceful revolution.
   On behalf of the Paris-based Jan Palach Foundation, leading
members of the Czechoslovak student movement received the annual
Jan Palach award presented at the rally by French actor Yves
Montand.
   ``Already today we see that the defeated structure has not
surrendered yet and keeps dreaming its crazy dream, hoping to
regain power,'' said student Martin Klima. ``By receiving the award
we pledge to continue his struggle, to be vigilant and issue a
warning.''
   The rally took place on Palach Square, formerly known as Red
Army Soldiers Square, in front of Charles University, where Palach
studied history. After the rally, Havel returned to lay flowers for
Palach at Wenceslas Square, where he was arrested last year.
   Interior Minister Richard Sacher announced the officers in
charge of the central and local branches of the secret police were
suspended, their written documents sealed and their weapons
confiscated.
   ``Their further fate will be determined during the ongoing
interviews by ... the police force,'' Sacher said without
elaborating.
   Sacher said that departments dealing with the so-called
``struggle against the internal enemy'' were also abolished.
   The work of the State Secret Security bureau, known as the STB,
included information gathering on church activists, dissidents,
young people, scientists, cultural figures, emigres, and anyone
else considered likely to be a threat to the Communist state.
   ``I want to inform the public about measures that were gradually
taken by the new leadership of the Interior Ministry, because there
are doubts about this among the public and the media as well,''
Sacher's statement said.
   The government in December said the abolition of the STB was one
of its goals.
   The government also wants the estimated 75,000 Soviet troops to
pull out of Czechoslovakia by the end of the year. Talks on the
Soviet withdrawal continued for a second day Tuesday in Prague, and
officials reported no progress.

another aircraft.
   The plane left San Antonio Friday night for the Liberian capital

   The Rev. Daniel Berrigan, the longtime peace

federal charge stemming from a Dec. 1 demonstration.
   Berrigan, 68, was arrested in New Orleans on charges he blocked
access to elevators in a federal office building. He faces up to 30
days in jail if convicted.
   The demonstration, involving students and members of the clergy,
protested U.S. relations with El Salvador after the murder of six
Jesuit priests there in November.
   Berrigan did not appear at his scheduled Dec. 14 arraignment in
New Orleans and was arrested two weeks later at his Manhattan
apartment. He was released after posting a $5,000 bond.
   At a hearing Tuesday when he agreed to appear in federal court
in New Orleans on Feb. 8, Berrigan said, ``I wish they were
pursuing the murderers of the Jesuits like they're pursuing me.''

   A military spokesman said the army's Southern Command, which is
responsible for the occupied Gaza Strip where the Palestinian boy
was beaten, had begun an investigation. He gave no further details.
   Claire Grimes, spokeswoman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency,
said Mahmoud al-Hissy suffered broken wrists, a dislocated left
elbow and welts all over his body as a result of the beating in
Gaza's Shati refugee camp.
   She said her agency filed a complaint immediately after the
incident on Feb. 25, 1989, but ``we have received no reply.''
   Amnon Rubinstein, a lawmaker of the liberal Shinui Party, raised
the issue in Parliament Monday and said the army had treated the
complaint with contempt.
   ``This raises the suspicion that army commanders were trying to
cover up for brutal soldiers,'' Rubinstein said. He called on
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin to begin his own investigation.
   Mrs. Grimes said the boy told her that on Feb. 25, soldiers took
him into a Shati building used by the army as an observation post.
   ``He said that he was beaten, forced to take off his clothes and
hung by his feet. He said soldiers also threatened to push him off
the top of the building,'' Mrs. Grimes said.
   The boy said soldiers told him the beatings were administered to
scare off Shati youths involved in stone-throwing in the
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule of the occupied lands,
Mrs. Grimes said.
   Also on Tuesday, six Palestinian teen-agers were wounded by army
gunfire in stone-throwing protests in three Gaza refugee camps,
Arab hospital officials said. Soldiers closed six Gaza City schools
indefinitely because of student riots.
   The army said it had no reports of injuries in Gaza. It said one
masked Palestinian youth was shot with a plastic bullet during a
stone-throwing clash near Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, a self-declared Palestinian
``general security unit'' staged a rally for a second day to
promise residents protection against radical Palestinian vigilantes.
   Hundreds of shoppers applauded as about 60 masked men in
military-style clothing marched through the open-air market,
witnesses told Arab reporters.
   The march by the security unit was the latest attempt by the
PLO's Fatah faction to stop a rash of kidnappings and slayings of
Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel.
   At least 170 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs in
the 25-month-old uprising, most of them on suspicion of
collaboration. Another 647 Palestinians have been killed by
Israelis; 43 Israelis also have died.
   In the Gaza village of Bani Suheila on Tuesday, troops destroyed
one house and parts of two others owned by Palestinians accused of
attacking suspected collaborators, the army said. Soldiers also
sealed the house of a Gaza City man suspected of attacks on
collaborators.
   Israeli media reported that Israeli, U.S. and Egyptian officials
would meet in Washington this week to discuss moving the Middle
East peace process ahead.
   Israeli media quoting unidentified official sources said U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III would meet this week with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid and Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin in Washington.
   The reports came as Abdel-Meguid flew to Washington unexpectedly
Tuesday.
   The Israeli Foreign Ministry would not confirm or deny the
reports but said such a session would be a breakthrough in the
stalled peace process.
   Such a meeting would likely focus on Palestinian representatives
to a proposed Palestinian-Israeli dialogue in Cairo. Israel has
objected to any PLO role in selecting negotiators and to the
participation of Palestinians who live outside the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.

   English-language text of a statement issued Tuesday
on Cambodia by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council _ the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and
France:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council meeting
in Paris on Jan. 15-16, 1990, agreed that they would be guided by
the following principles in working for a resolution of the
Cambodian problem:
   _ No acceptable solution can be achieved by force of arms.
   _ An enduring peace can only be achieved through a comprehensive
political settlement, including the verified withdrawal of foreign
forces, a ceasefire and the cessation of outside military
assistance.
   _ The goal should be self-determination for the Cambodian people
through free, fair and democratic elections.
   _ All accept an enhanced U.N. role in the resolution of the
Cambodian problem.
   _ There is an urgent need to speed up diplomatic efforts to
achieve a settlement.
   _ The complete withdrawal of foreign forces must be verified by
the U.N.
   _ The five would welcome an early resumption of a constructive
dialogue among the Cambodian factions which is essential to
facilitating the transition process, which should not be dominated
by any one of them.
   _ An effective U.N. presence will be required during the
transition period in order to assure internal security.
   _ A Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General is
needed in Cambodia to supervise U.N. activities during a transition
period culminating in the inauguration of a democratically elected
government.
   _ The scale of the U.N. operation should be consistent with the
successful implementation of a Cambodian settlement and its
planning and execution should take account of the heavy financial
burden that may be placed on member states.
   _ Free and fair elections must be conducted under direct U.N.
administration.
   _ The elections must be conducted in a neutral political
environment in which no party would be advantaged.
   _ The five permanent members commit themselves to honoring the
results of free and fair elections.
   _ All Cambodians should enjoy the same rights, freedoms and
opportunities to participate in the election process.
   _ A Supreme National Council might be the repository of
Cambodian sovereignty during the transition process.
   _ Questions involving Cambodian sovereignty should be resolved
with the agreement of the Cambodian parties.
   The five support all responsible efforts by regional parties to
achieve a comprehensive political settlement, and will remain in
close touch with them, with the view to reconvening the Paris
conference at an appropriate time.

   Two young children have been sexually
assaulted, abused and killed in the past two weeks and in both
cases family friends who had visited the youngsters' homes were
arrested.
   One of the victims may have been tortured over the period of a
week, and the other was smothered and strangled.
   ``I think there is a myth generally believed by many people that
children are sexually assaulted by a stranger in a trench coat who
lurks in an alley and offers them candy,'' said Milwaukee County
Assistant District Attorney John DiMotto, who is prosecuting both
cases.
   The two cases have left parents ``yearning for knowlege of how
to keep their children safe,'' said Mary Ann Grochowski, a
psychotherapist in this city of 600,000.
   Both of the victims' parents did not know their children were
being abused and even social workers who visited the families did
not detect the abuse, and other parents are now worried they, too,
may be missing signs of abuse, Ms. Grochowski said.
   ``I know it's affecting the general population of Milwaukee,''
Ms. Grochowski said. ``It's provoking a great deal of panic.''
   Four-year-old Mistydawn Faust was found dead in the bedroom of
her mother's apartment early Dec. 31. She was bleeding heavily from
the groin area and suffered cuts on her chin, throat and eyelid,
authorities said. An autopsy determined she had been strangled and
smothered, probably with a pillow.
   Gary D. Crubaugh, 18, was arrested the same day and charged with
murder and first-degree sexual assault of a child.
   The criminal complaint said Crubaugh spent the evening of Dec.
30 playing cards with Mistydawn's mother, 28-year-old Peggy Messer,
and her fiance. After the couple went to bed, Crubaugh slept on the
couch.
   He is accused of raping and killing the child during the night.
   ``It's affected a lot of the officers who investigated this
one,'' police Lt. Michael Krzewinski said. ``Detectives who weren't
even involved in the investigation came to work in a real jovial
mood with food to contribute to our New Year's Eve dinner, and when
they heard about this case, a pall just fell over the room. Most of
the guys on the later shift have young children _ this really hit
home.''
   Last Friday, Michelle Lagoo reported her 18-month-old son, Kurt,
was missing.
   After a day-long search by police, FBI agents, and about 100
volunteers, Ms. Lagoo's 25-year-old boyfriend, Shane H. King, who
had been baby-sitting Kurt, told police the boy was dead and led
them to the body, left in a garbage bag at a desolate farm.
   King was charged Monday with murder and first-degree sexual
assault of a child. He later tried to kill himself in his cell and
was ordered to undergo a psychiatric exam.
   The criminal complaint alleges King abused Kurt for about a week
and tortured and killed the boy Friday while his mother was at work.
   An autopsy determined the boy had suffered a blunt force trauma
to the abdomen, and also was choked, raped, bitten and burned with
a cigarette lighter.
   The Milwaukee County Department of Social Services had contact
with both of the victims' families before the killings, but in
neither case was there any sign of abuse, said department spokesman
Jefferson Aikin.
   Caseworkers saw no danger, Aikin said, because the source of
danger was outside the home.
   ``We frequently find that the boyfriend is the one that
committed the assault,'' he said. ``Often they're not in the home,
they live outside the home _ they're not suspected.''

<TEXT>
   The U.N. Security Council's five permanent members
agreed Tuesday to seek a Cambodian peace plan that would include
free elections administered and supervised by the United Nations.
   After two days of meetings, the five countries issued a 16-point
summary of principles, including an ``effective U.N. presence'' to
assure peace prior to elections. The statment indicated
international peacekeepers would be used.
   ``An enduring peace can only be achieved through a comprehensive
political settlement, including the verified withdrawal of foreign
forces, a cease-fire and the cessation of outside military
assistance,'' the statement said. ``The goal should be
self-determination for the Cambodian people through free, fair and
democratic elections.''
   French and U.S. officials said representaives of the Security
Council members _ the United States, Soviet Union, China, France
and Britain _ will meet again in about two weeks in New York to
advance the peace plan. A third meeting is expected in Paris in
February.
   ``We're at least going to make a strong try at it,'' said a
senior U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We're
not talking about a process that would take several years, but it's
clear it will take several months.''
   The official said there were many details to be worked out, and
that the government and the three guerrilla factions would have to
lay down their arms.
   ``Clearly the Cambodians themselves have to be a major part of
the process,'' the U.S. official said. ``It can't just be plunked
down on their heads.''
   The Vietnamese-backed government of Premier Hun Sen and the
three guerrilla factions allied in an uneasy coalition have given
at least cautious support for a major U.N. role.
   The statement suggested that a ``Supreme National Council''
might be set up during the transition process. There was no
agreement on the council's membership or what powers it would have,
the U.S. official said.
   The statement by the General Assembly members did not
specifically mention Hun Sen's government or the guerrilla
coalition led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   It said the Security Council members would ``welcome an early
resumption of a constructive dialogue among the Cambodian
factions'' and that the transition process ``should not be
dominated by any one of them.''
   The Security Council delegations were headed by Soviet Deputy
Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Richard Solomon, Chinese Vice Minister Xu Dunxin, British Deputy
Foreign Minister David Gillmore, and Claude Martin, the director
for Asia in France's Foreign Ministry.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas opened the discussions
Monday, saying the countries had a special responsibility to make
sure that one guerrilla faction, the Khmer Rouge, never returns to
power in Cambodia.
   The Khmer Rouge were responsible for hundreds of thousands of
deaths when their leader Pol Pot ruled Cambodia from 1975-78. They
were chased out by a Vietnamese invasion in 1978.
   Son Sann, a former prime minister who heads the non-communist
Khmer People's National Liberation Front, wrote in Tuesday's
editions of the conservative daily Le Figaro that he would approve
a U.N. interim administration and a peacekeeping force to enforce a
cease-fire.
   Son Sann said the guerrilla coalition should retain Cambodia's
seat in the United Nations during the transition period but should
not participate in debates or votes.
   Other proposals have called for declaring the Cambodian seat
vacant until free elections are held. The coalition has held
Cambodia's U.N. seat since 1982.
   China is the chief supplier of the communist Khmer Rouge
gurrilla group, the United States backs the two non-Communist
guerrilla groups in the coalition and the Soviet Union supports Hun
Sen's government.
   In Beijing Tuesday, Sihanouk rejected the reported proposal of
Premier Hun Sen to allow the guerrilla groups to administer the
territories they control until elections are held.
   Sihanouk said the proposal would mean partitioning Cambodia,
with Vietnam gaining complete control of one portion. Hun Sen
``knows that in the weeks and months to come he will lose more and
more territory to the resistance,'' Sihanouk said.
   The resistance has claimed significant victories over Hun Sen's
forces since Vietnam ended its 11-year military occupation of the
country last fall.

   The widow of investor-publisher John Hay Whitney
will offer a Renoir from the couple's collection for sale for an
estimated $40 million to $50 million, Sotheby's auction house said
Tuesday.
   Pierre-Auguste Renoir's 1876 artwork, acclaimed for its light,
shadow and movement, depicts the Moulin de la Galette, a French
outdoor dance hall in Montmartre frequented by avant-garde writers,
painters and actors.
   It shows a model named Estelle siting at a table with three of
Renoir's friends, including biographer Georges Rivere, who later
described the painting as ``a page of history, a precious moment of
Paris life depicted with rigorous examination.''
   The painting was owned for 60 years by Whitney and his wife,
Betsey Cushing Whitney.
   Whitney, who died in 1982, founded J.H. Whitney &amp; Co., a
venture-capitalist firm, and was an ambassador to Great Britain and
publisher of The New York Herald Tribune.
   He became a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art in 1930, was
named president in 1941 and was chairman from 1946 to 1956. He was
a trustee of the National Gallery of Art in Washington from 1961 to
1979.
   A larger version of ``Au Moulin de la Galette'' is in the Musee
d'Orsay in Paris. It is believed one was painted at the scene and
the other at Renoir's studio _ but no one knows which is which.
   Sotheby's will take the Whitney version to Paris for a
comparison in February. Then, after exhibits in Tokyo, Zurich,
Paris and London, the Renoir will return to New York for an auction
on May 16.
   After Whitney's death, his wife gave five institutions 20 works
by Edgar Degas, Paul Gauguin, Pablo Picasso, Henri Rousseau,
Georges Seurat, James Abbott McNeill Whistler and other artists.
   Several other Whitneys also are well-known in the art world.
   Whitney's niece, Linda de Roulet, sold Pablo Picasso's ``Au
Lapin Agile,'' a Paris tavern scene, on Nov. 17 for $40.7 million.
   Mrs. de Roulet's brother, John Whitney Payson, sold Vincent van
Gogh's ``Irises'' in 1987 for $53.9 million, the highest price ever
obtained at an art auction.
   Payson got his money, but other parts of the deal went sour. It
turned out Sotheby's had lent Australian tycoon Alan Bond $27
million to help buy ``Irises,'' using the painting itself as
collateral. Bond didn't pay off the loan; the van Gogh is now in a
vault, its ownership cloudy. Last week, Sotheby's announced it was
abandoning its loan policy _ which triggered the quandary and
which, critics charged, inflated art prices in general.
   Both the van Gogh and the Picasso came from the collection of
former New York Mets owner Joan Whitney Payson, Whitney's sister
and the mother of Mrs. de Roulet and John Whitney Payson.

   Teachers' union leaders expressed alarm
Tuesday over a new report that says the United States lags behind
most other industrial nations in spending on elementary and
secondary schools. Administration officials were concerned but
skeptical about the study's methods.
   ``This new report is shocking,'' said Keith Geiger, president of
the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers'
union. ``We'll never be able to compete effectively in the global
marketplace if we don't match the commitment to education that our
competitors make.''
   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, said the report by the labor-backed Economic Policy
Institute should ``button the lips of those who claim education is
adequately funded.''
   The report, ``Shortchanging Education,'' said that among
industrial nations only Ireland and Australia spend less than the
United States in investing in elementary and secondary education.
   Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Belgium, Denmark, Japan,
Canada, West Germany, France, the Netherlands, Britain and Italy
all invest more, said the report, which was based on education
expenditures as a percentage of national income in 1985.
   The Education Department balked at the methodology used by
authors M. Edith Rasell and Lawrence Mishel.
   ``When (elementary and secondary school) spending is accurately
compared to other nations _ as average per pupil expenditures and
not as `share of national income' _ the U.S. ranks second only to
Switzerland,'' the department said in a statement.
   Asked about the report, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said, ``I don't have an analysis of that'' but added ``we have to
be concerned.''
   ``(Education) Secretary (Lauro) Cavazos is looking at various
solutions. And we have convened the governors' summit, and we want
to look at new goals and objectives. But, clearly, this lays out
some problems that need to be dealt with especially at the primary
and secondary level.''
   Geiger said that over the 1980s, previous NEA reports have found
that federal financial aid to elementary and secondary schools fell
by one-third, from 9.2 percent to 6.2 percent.
   ``This report demonstrates that the criticism of so-called
excessive spending on education is, at the very least,
overstated,'' said Shanker. ``We are not making an effort
comparable to most industrialized countries, and we should stop
implying that we are.''
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee, agreed. ``We get what we pay for. It's
no coincidence that the United States ranks near the bottom of
industrialized nations in educational performance.''
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education
and Labor Committee, said, ``It is embarrassing to see the United
States in the bargain basement of international educational
support.''

<HEAD>Mrs. Bush Says Women Should Be Used in Combat If Physically

   Barbara Bush said Tuesday that women should be
able to serve in combat as long as they have the physical strength
to match their ability to shoot and fly as well as men.
   ``Certainly, emotionally and mentally they are more than able to
compete with a man,'' she said in a wide-ranging interview with
three reporters. She also said:
   _Her eyes haven't improved from the just-completed radiation
treatment to combat symptoms of Graves disease, but she is
cautiously optimistic. ``I'm so eager to be better that I think I'm
better,'' she said, acknowledging she still has double vision,
especially in the morning.
   _She doesn't know why her soaring popularity consistently
surpasses President Bush's own high ratings. ``I don't threaten
anyone. I'm just a nice, fat grandmother,'' she offered as an
explanation.
   _Her son, Neil Bush, ``hasn't done anything wrong'' in his
onetime role as a board member of Silverado Savings and Loan. Neil
Bush has been questioned by federal regulators about the failed S&amp;L.
   Asked whether women should serve in combat, as they did in
Panama, Mrs. Bush gave a ``qualified yes.''
   ``If I thought a woman physically could pick up someone who was
wounded and carry them to safety, if I thought they could throw a
hand grenade as far as a man, then I would say fine. ...
   ``They can shoot as well. They can fly as well. The only problem
I would have is if it risks somebody else's life because they
couldn't throw a hand grenade as far or carry (someone).''
   Bush has said he would be willing to hear recommendations from
the Pentagon about women in combat. The Pentagon's official policy
is that women do not serve in combat roles. Women unexpectedly
became involved in combat in Panama.
   Mrs. Bush said ``George doesn't hide'' secrets from her,
including the Panama invasion, and that he discusses ideas with her
about world affairs. But Mrs. Bush said she knew something was
afoot even before the president told her the specifics of the
invasion.
   ``It was very clear to me that we were having an awful lot of
people in the house,'' she said. ``I knew pretty clearly that
something was happening.''
   Mrs. Bush said she was surprised at how much she enjoys being
first lady.
   ``I thought I'd like it but I never dreamed that I would love
it,'' she said.
   She said her most difficult duty was to attend a memorial
service for the 47 seamen killed in the April 19 explosion aboard
the USS Iowa.
   Mrs. Bush met Tuesday with the reporters in the airy West Hall
room of the White House second floor. Her eyes, though tearing
slightly, looked less puffy than they have on some recent days.
   She said she can ``always tell which of my friends have been to
the grocery store'' when they call to ask about her health after
eading dire reports in supermarket tabloids.
   ``They are so fake,'' she said of the tabloids.
   Told that it was a first visit to the second floor for one of
the reporters, she insisted on an impromptu tour.
   ``Look at the tourists. Aren't they cute?'' she said, waving to
a woman from the window of the room where she keeps her clothes.
   On other subjects, Mrs. Bush said:
   _She had been ``a little testy'' about an avalanche of letters
saying it's unsafe for the president to attend the Feb. 15 drug
summit in violence-torn Colombia. She said she would prefer the
summit be elsewhere, but ``I can't change his mind or make those
decisions.''
   _She plans to write a book after leaving the White House based
on 30 years of diaries, but says it won't be a ``kiss and tell.''
   _``A lot of progress is being made'' in her war against
illiteracy. ``But it's a drop in the bucket. ... We're trying to
change the whole system.''

<HEAD>AZT Dose Recommendation Cut in Half</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday
cut in half the recommended dose of the anti-AIDS drug AZT,
reducing the cost and likely side effects of AZT therapy.
   Some physician experts in treating AIDS already are prescribing
lower doses. The agency's action will send the message to other
doctors that the low dose is just as effective as the high dose and
causes fewer side effects.
   The FDA ordered changes in the labels on AZT, also known as
zidovudine, to recommend 600 milligrams a day after one month at
1,200 milligrams a day, the previous recommendation for a daily
dose.
   The change ``means that fewer patients may have to discontinue
AZT therapy because of serious side effects,'' Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said in a statement.
   Dr. James Mason, assistant secretary for health, said the lower
dose also would reduce treatment costs for AIDS patients receiving
AZT.
   A year's treatment with AZT at the current recommended dose
costs about $8,000 or more. Tuesday's recommendation would mean
annual costs of about $4,300 or more.
   Mark Harrington, representing the AIDS activist group ACT UP,
said the FDA's action was ``great news'' and important because it
will get the word to ``conservative doctors'' who prescribe
strictly according to a drug's label.
   The decision also is important because high doses of AZT have
been keeping AIDS patients out of clinical drug trials, in which
the drug is compared with other therapies. In these trials AZT is
administered at the previously recommended high dose, he said.
   ``Partly because of cost and partly because of toxicity, we need
to find out what the lowest possible dose is,'' he said.
   Harrington said the FDA recommendation was long overdue. He
noted that preliminary findings of the study on which the action is
based were released last July.
   On the basis of those initial findings by the government's
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, many
physicians began prescribing the lower dose. Dose recommendations
on the label do not prevent doctors from prescribing higher or
lower doses of the drug if they believe it is warranted.
   The FDA said clinical data from the study became ``sufficiently
collected and analyzed'' in November and were submitted to the FDA
by the manufacturer, Burroughs Wellcome Co., on Dec. 18.
   While producing fewer adverse reactions, the half-dose regimen
was as effective as a higher test does in prolonging survival and
reducing the frequency of opportunistic infections that often kill
AIDS patients, according to the agency's analysis.
   The study, however, did not determine whether the lower dose is
as effective in aiding neurological problems in AIDS patients,
officials said.
   AZT is the only anti-AIDS drug approved by the FDA that directly
combats the virus that causes the fatal disease, which destroys the
body's ability to resist infections and other diseases.
   However, the highly toxic drug can inhibit the production of red
blood cells, causing severe anemia. It can also reduce the number
of infection-fighting white blood cells to dangerously low levels,
requiring the patient to discontinue use of the drug.
   In the clinical study, 262 patients were given 1,500 milligrams
of AZT a day for two years, to see if higher-than-recommended doses
produce any benefit. Another group of the same size was given 1,200
milligrams a day for a month and then 600 milligrams a day for the
rest of the period, said Kathy Bartlett, a spokeswoman for
Burroughs Wellcome.
   Patients in the low-dose group were found to have fewer side
effects than those in the high-dose group without any apparent
difference in benefit. Among those receiving the high dose, nearly
half had serious adverse reactions that required them to
discontinue AZT treatment, while only a quarter of the low-dose
patients had to stop treatment.

<TEXT>
   Former ``Today'' co-host Jane Pauley will be one
of the substitute anchors on the ``NBC Nightly News'' when
anchorman Tom Brokaw is on assignment or on vacation, NBC said
Tuesday.
   Pauley, who will make her debut Friday as a substitute for
Brokaw, won't be the only fill-in anchor, emphasized NBC spokesman
Katherine McQuay.
   The others are ``Sunday Today'' anchorman Garrick Utley, Mary
Alice Williams and Deborah Norville, who this month succeeded
Pauley on ``Today.''
   Pauley, who left the morning program last month after more than
13 years as its co-host, is working on ``Changes,'' a prime-time
special scheduled to air in March, and later this year will anchor
a prime-time news series.
   That series, which thus far has no title and no scheduled air
date, will represent NBC News' 17th attempt to succeed with a
weekly prime-time program.
   There has been speculation that Brokaw, who once was co-host of
``Today'' with Pauley, will co-anchor her new series. But McQuay
called that possibility ``extremely unlikely.''

<HEAD>ABC's `Roseanne' Takes First in Nielsen Ratings</HEAD>

   ABC's ``Roseanne'' moved ahead of NBC's ``The
Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' to take possession of first place in
the Nielsen television ratings for the week ended Jan. 14.
   ``Roseanne'' was more than three ratings points ahead of
``Cosby'' and four ahead of third-place ``Cheers.''
   But NBC kept a firm grip on first place among the networks,
while CBS held onto second place by a narrow margin over
third-place ABC. NBC had an average of 15.4 in the A.C. Nielsen Co.
survey, CBS 13.4 and ABC 13.2.
   In the season to date, NBC leads with 14.8, ABC is second with
12.9 and CBS third with 12.2. A rating represents the percentage of
the nation's 92.1 million television homes tuned to a show.
   NBC and CBS listed as first in their versions of the ratings the
prime time runover of CBS' coverage of the NFL pro football playoff
game between the Los Angeles Rams and the San Francisco 49ers. San
Francisco's victory put them into the Super Bowl.
   Although the game is not on the official Nielsen list, the
post-game show on CBS tied for seventh place with NBC's ``Empty
Nest.''
   Here's the Top 10: ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's ``The Cosby Show,''
NBC's ``Cheers,'' NBC's ``A Different World,'' NBC's ``The Golden
Girls,'' CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' CBS' NFL championship playoff
post-game show and NBC's ``Empty Nest'' tied, NBC's ``Dear John''
and ABC's ``The Wonder Years.''
   ABC's ``Coach'' was 11th as the comedy continued to do well
behind ``Roseanne'' in place of the canceled ``Chicken Soup.''
   Two CBS Monday night comedies also moved up in the ratings,
perhaps due to the end of ABC's Monday Night Football or perhaps
aided by the baby boom. The birth of Stephanie's baby put
``Newhart'' in a three-way tie for 13th place with NBC's ``L.A.
Law'' and CBS' ``Designing Women.'' The week before ``Designing
Woen'' was 10th with its one-hour special on the birth of
Charlene's baby.
   In the rest of CBS' Monday lineup, ``Murphy Brown'' was 20th,
``Major Dad'' was 35th and ``Doctor, Doctor'' was 43rd. But another
Monday comedy, ``The Famous Teddy Z'' was 57th and is being
replaced by Valerie Harper in ``City.''
   ABC's ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' had its premiere in
16th place. Another new show, Fox's ``The Simpsons,'' opened in
47th place.
   The last two chapters of the NBC miniseries ``Drug Wars: The
Camarena Story'' fared little better than the first episode the
week before. The second part was 33rd and the third part was 26th.
It had opened in 35th place.
   ABC's ``Rock Hudson'' film biography placed 29th.
   ABC had a clear lead among news shows with ``ABC World News
Tonight,'' but NBC took over second place and CBS fell to third.
The ratings: ABC 11.9, NBC 10.9, CBS 10.8.
   Here are the five bottom network shows, in descending order:
CBS' ``Paradise,'' CBS' ``Saturday Night With Connie Chung,'' ABC's
``PrimeTime Live,'' ABC's ``Mission: Impossible'' and, in last
place, CBS' ``Tour of Duty.''

<TEXT>
   Anti-pollution equipment
was rushed Tuesday to Porto Santo after patches of oil washed
ashore, killing wildlife and fouling this Madeira island's white
sand beaches, Portuguese authorities said.
   The cause of the spill, which began Monday, was not immediately
known.
   Porto Santo Mayor Jose Jorge de Gois Mendonca said the north and
east coasts of this small Atlantic island 425 miles off Morocco had
been hardest hit by the oil. Smaller spills were reported off the
south coast, where most tourists stay.
   Oil slicks stretching over 12 miles were reported off the
island, posing further threat to Porto Santo, its drinking water
and to a nature reserve on the uninhabited Desertas Islands where
colonies of the rare Mediterranean monk seal reside.
   Officials warned of ecological disaster if the oil washes up on
the Desertas, 37 miles south. The rocky islands house several rare
maritime animals, including one of the world's last breeding
colonies of the Mediterranean monk seal, an endangered species.
   Locals told authorities that the blackened bodies of seagulls
and turtles killed by the oil already had washed onto Porto Santo's
5{-mile-long main beach.
   The Portuguese government in Lisbon, 625 miles northeast, on
Tuesday sent an air force transport plane carrying an
anti-pollution team, floating barriers, pumps and other equipment
to help combat the mysterious slick.
   Portuguese Navy officers said it was unlikely the crude came
from the Iranian oil tanker Khark 5, which leaked more than 19
million gallons in the region last month, the Lusa news agency
reported.
   Authorities told Lusa the oil that washed up this week was dense
and black, suggesting a more recent leak. Oil that has been in the
sea longer turns yellowish and foamy, the report said.
   Naval officials said the oil could have been dumped from any of
the tankers traveling through the busy waters off the islands.
   Madeira itself, the main island in the archipelago and a major
winter vacation destination, was not immediately threatened by the
slick, officials said, but could be endangered if wind directions
changed.
   An emergency meeting of the Madeira Regional Government called
to discuss the situation said there was a threat to the drinking
water on Porto Santo.
   The islanders take 80 percent of their drinking water from
desalination plants drawing water from the sea. The pumps supplying
sea water to the system would have to be stopped if the slick
approached the catch basin, officials said.
   Porto Santo has a population of about 5,000 people who derive
most of their income from tourism, fishing and agriculture.

   A police detective who was spurned by
his sharpshooting fiancee fatally shot her Tuesday and turned his
gun on himself but survived, officials said.
   Army Lt. Priyanka Kumarage died in the hospital of gunshot
wounds, military officials said. Detective S. Hettitantri was
hospitalized in serious condition, they added.
   Ms. Kumarage, 24, was to represent Sri Lanka in pistol shooting
at the 25th Commonwealth Games in New Zealand later this month, the
officials said.
   An initial investigation revealed that Hettitantri, also 24,
apparently became enraged when he learned Ms. Kumarage was leaving
him for an army officer.
   Hettitantri picked up Ms. Kumarage in his van at her home in
Moratuwa near Colombo on Tuesday and drove to the barracks of the
Army Women Corps in Colombo, where he shot her three times, the
officials said.
   The young policeman then ran a couple of miles to a police
station where he shot himself in the chest, the officials said.

<HEAD>Soviet General Details Defense Cuts as Part of New Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet military chief urged the
United States Tuesday to match sharp cuts in troops, weapons and
spending Moscow is making as part of its plan to reshape the Soviet
Union's defense policy.
   The call by Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev followed comments by Gen.
Colin Powell, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
cautioning that Soviet forces remain predominant in Europe but
praising Moscow's policy change. Powell also held out the
possiblity of U.S. troop cuts, saying there was ``nothing
sacrosanct about the number of American troops stationed in
Europe.''
   The military chiefs' statements came on the opening day of a
three-week bargaining session designed to ease East-West tensions
in Europe.
   The talks, known as the military doctrine seminar, have
coincided with removal of hard-line leaders in every Warsaw Pact
country. Western experts are eager to learn how the political
reforms that have occurred in Easter Europe since last year might
affect those country's defense policies.
   The session marks the first time the top brass of 35 nations
have sat down to try to lift some of the secrecy surrounding
military affairs.
   Moiseyev explained Moscow's change from offensive to defensive
strategy, and urged the United States and its allies to make
similar military cuts.
   ``We need reciprocity and would like to see it in the nearest
future,'' Moiseyev said.
   Earlier, Powell said the Western allies were still concerned
about ``the specter of confronting greatly superior forces armed,
trained and suited for offensive ground operations.''
   But Powell welcomed the change in Soviet strategy and added:
``There is nothing carved in stone that says that military power in
a divided Europe should remain as it has over the last four
decades.''
   The U.S. has about 300,000 troops stationed in Europe, compared
with about 575,000 Soviet troops, according to U.S. figures.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization maintains its forces are
the minimum needed to defend against _ not launch _ an attack.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev about a year ago announced
plans to cut unilaterally all Soviet military forces by 500,000
troops and reduce conventional, or non-nuclear, arms substantially.
   Moiseyev said half the reductions have occurred and the rest
will be carried out this year.
   As of Jan. 1, he said, total Soviet armed forces were pared by
265,000. He said 9,320 tanks, more than 5,050 artillery systems and
835 warplanes have been pulled out of Europe.
   The Soviet military budget was cut by 8.2 percent last year and
will be slashed by more than 14 percent over the next two years, he
said.
   ``We also intend, if the situation permits, to drastically, by
1.5 to 2 times, reduce the share of the national income's spending
on defense by 1995,'' he said.
   Arms production will go down nearly 20 percent, he said.
   Sir David Craig, chief of the British defense staff, described
Moiseyev's talk as ``very interesting'' but said he didn't find
much new in it.
   Craig said the West wanted to believe the Soviet intention to
change its military policy.
   ``But there is a long way to go between intentions and
execution,'' he said. ``We must wait and see how that execution is
carried out.''
   Later Tuesday, the Bulgarian military chief, Gen. Christo
Dobrev, whose country last November removed its longtime ruler
Todor Zhivkov, said Bulgaria has trimmed defense spending and
reduced the number of troops and weapons.
   He said Bulgaria has always followed a defensive posture and the
cuts will strengthen that policy.
   Dobrev was the only East European officer to speak on the
opening day. Poland, Czechoslovakia and East Germany were on
Wednesday's agenda.
   Gen. Lee Butler of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff said Dobrev's
remarks were an ``early indication of where force structure might
be going within the non-Soviet Warsaw Pact countries.''
   He predicted the Warsaw Pact countries would talk ``a great deal
about how they're going to restructure and reduce and change the
character of their armed forces ... in the direction of defensive
(policies).''

   Rescuers chopped and cut through the
wreckage of a twin-engine propeller plane high up a rugged mountain
and retrieved all 23 bodies aboard Tuesday, including those of five
Americans, authorities said.
   The plane crashed about 4,500 feet up 7,450-foot Pico Blanco
mountain, 10 miles southwest of San Jose, five minutes after taking
off in driving rain Monday morning from the capital's Juan
Santamaria airport, the Public Security Ministry reported.
   Red Cross and Costan Rican officials said victims included three
Costa Rican crew members and up to 14 foreigners.
   The State Department in Washington identified three of the
American victims as David Ulland of Austin, Minn.; Lester Ross of
Lancaster, Pa., and Norman Baltimore of East Smithfield, Pa.
   It said families of two other Americans were being notified.
   The newspaper La Nacion said seven Canadians were aboard.
   Canadian Consul Peter Boehm told The Associated Press he had no
immediate information on Canadian deaths, ``but it is very possible
that what was said on the number of Canadians could be true.''
   The 9-year-old, Spanish-made Aerocar aircraft belonged to
Servicios Aereos Nacionales, a subsidiary of Lineas Aereas
Costaricenses S.A., the national airline, and was on a regular
flight to the small southern town of Palmar Norte.
   A Red Cross spokesman said in a telephone interview that efforts
were under way to bring the bodies down the mountain.
   ``The work has become very difficult because Pico Blanco is
covered with dense shrub and the surface is very irregular,'' he
said.
   He refused to give his name.
   About 100 rescue workers from the Red Cross, the Civil Guard and
the fire department reached the wreckage late Monday and used axes
and chainsaws to cut through the wreckage. They retrieved the last
bodies early Tuesday after it stopped raining, the Red Cross
spokesman said.

<TEXT>
   About 130 workers at a southern coal mine
have started a sit-in strike for higher pay, and small groups of
employees at four other mines also are refusing to work, Polish
television reported Tuesday.
   The work stoppage over pay demands, which began Monday night,
was the biggest since a radical economic austerity program backed
by the non-Communist government took effect Jan. 1.
   Also Tuesday, the PAP news agency reported that the Solidarity
government has set up fund to assist up to 400,000 workers who
could lose their jobs as a result of economic reform.
   The television report said the miners were demanding an increase
in wages, preservation of their privileges, a decrease in
administrative personnel and no repercussions for strikers.
   The government has adopted a tight wage policy in an effort to
bring down inflation that soared to about 900 percent last year
after a partial lifting of price controls last August.
   Most of the remaining price controls were lifted on Jan. 1 and
prices have soared again ahead of wages.
   The television report said the reasons for work stoppages at two
other mines in Walbrzych and two more near the industrial city of
Katowice were similar to those given by workers at the Thorez mine.
   Miners in Walbrzych had warned last week they would strike if
their demands for a reduction in administrative personnel were not
met.
   It was difficult to determine how many people were likely to
become unemployed as a result of the reform program, but from
400,000 to 5 million could lose their jobs, PAP said.
   Among the components of the plan, enacted by the government, are
tight credit, a tough wage policy and a drastic reduction of state
subsidies and steep price increases for energy, transportation and
communications.
   The fund can cover about 200,000 jobless with unemployment
benefits for several months, the news agency said.
   There are also plans to create 25,000 new jobs for those
dismissed and another 10,000 for invalids, PAP said. About 10,000
will be offered small loans to start private businesses.
   The fund also will provide equalizing payments for 50,000
workers who lose their jobs due to group dismissals or are forced
to accept lower paying jobs.
   The fund relies on mandatory contributions from workplaces, but
the state will step in with contributions from the budget if more
funds are needed, the agency said.

<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake struck along
California's North Coast on Tuesday, but there were no immediate
reports of injuries or damages.
   The quake, measuring 5.3 on the Richter scale, struck at 12:08
p.m. about 50 miles south of Eureka, the U.S. Geological Survey in
Menlo Park reported. The state Office of Emergency Services in
Sacramento and University of California-Berkeley Seismographic
Station also estimated the quake at 5.3.
   ``It seemed long and just kind of weaving. It wasn't real, real
strong here,'' said a woman with the Eureka Police Department who
only identified herself as Diana.
   The quake was felt along the North Coast, the region above San
Francisco, from Point Arena near the Oregon border, south to
Willits and in Lake County. State emergency officials reported that
residents in the small town of Petrolia said items were knocked off
shelves, but that there was no other damage. Petrolia is near a
land formation known as Punta Gorda, almost directly at the point
where the San Andreas Fault enters the Pacific.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in the strength of the shaking. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an
earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage, and 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   On Oct. 17, a major quake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale
struck Northern California, killing 67 people, injuring about 3,000
and causing $7 billion in damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.

   President Bush dropped in unannounced on
a public housing project Tuesday to salute residents for holding
all-night vigils against drug dealers.
   ``We simply have got to win this fight,'' he declared.
   The president used his visit to the Charles Houston development
in this Washington suburb to promote both his administration's
battle against drug pushers and legislation to encourage more home
ownership among public housing residents.
   ``With home ownership comes pride. Along with ownership comes
strengthening of the family. So our program is aimed at this whole
concept of home ownership,'' Bush told a group of community
activists.
   The president praised the courage of residents who, for the last
four weekends, have staged all-night prayer vigils and camped out
in drug-infested areas.
   Speaking to a group of anti-drug activists in the kitchen of a
community center, Bush said he had dropped by ``to say `thank you'
to those in the community who are standing shoulder to shoulder
with those who are fighting this drug menace. We simply have got to
win this fight.''
   Bush was accompanied by Jack Kemp, the secretary of housing and
urban development, on the early-afternoon tour.
   Kemp said the visit should be seen as a signal to drug dealers
that ``public housing no longer is going to be a free haven'' for
their activities.
   Bush and Kemp discussed the adminstration's $2.1 billion
package, introduced in November, to provide matching federal grants
to make it easier for public housing residents to buy their
dwellings.
   The president called on Congress to act on the measure when it
reconvenes Jan. 23, and to pass a long-languishing proposal for
urban enterprise zones that would give businesses tax breaks for
establishing in inner cities.
   Security was tight for Bush's foray into the high-crime
neighborhood; reporters travelling in his motorcade were not told
of his destination until he arrived. Helicopters hovered overhead
and the area was cordoned off by police.
   In mild spring-like weather, a steadily building crowd gathered
outside hastily assembled police barricades to watch Bush, Kemp and
other members of their entourage visit an a unit in the development
and then the community center about a block away.
   ``We were just driving by,'' Kemp joked.
   Their first stop was the home of community activists Pete and
Corina Jones in one of many of the two-story brick buildings that
make up the housing project. ``I was a little shocked to see the
president come into my house,'' Jones said later. ``It shows we do
have a president who cares.''
   The president praised Ramona Younger, leader of the Alexandria
Public Housing Residents Council and an organizer of the all-night
vigils.
   ``I've been inspired by the stories I've heard of her
leadership, her toughness, her willingness to take these people
on,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>``CBS Evening News'' Third in Ratings by Narrow Margin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The once-dominant ``CBS Evening News,'' now
trailing ABC's ``World News Tonight'' in ratings, was third last
week, national audience estimates showed Tuesday.
   ABC's newscast, anchored by Peter Jennings, easily won the week
ending Jan. 14 with a ratings average of 11.9. It was the 12th time
this season the program has triumphed over CBS's newscast,
according to an ABC spokesman.
   Tom Brokaw's ``NBC Nightly News,'' which usually is in third
place, was second in ratings last week with a 10.9 average, edging
out Rather's newscast, which was third by a narrow margin of
one-tenth of a ratings point.
   Acording to the A.C. Nielsen Co., each ratings point represents
921,000 homes.
   CBS officials had no immediate explanation for Rather's
third-place finish, which last happened in the final week of
December, according to CBS.
   Last week, one major CBS affiliate, KPIX-TV in San Francisco,
shifted Rather's program to an earlier 5:30 p.m. PST start time.
   But it isn't known yet if that was a factor in the week's
Nielsen returns for the program, said Michael Eisenberg, CBS vice
president for audience measurement.
   ``We couldn't point to that as the only reason right now,'' he
said in an interview Tuesday. ``We're studying the matter and
trying to find out what the reasons are.''
   In a news conference in Los Angeles over the weekend, Rather
said, ``I intend to keep right on keeping on. It's true, the `CBS
Evening News' is a work in progress ... we're constantly trying to
improve.''
   Asked about his delivery of the news from a standing position,
the anchorman said, ``I've always wanted to stand and do the
broadcast. I don't think that's cosmetic.''
   Rather and CBS News President David Burke said they were unable
to explain the ratings tumble.
   But each discounted speculation that some of it was due to
Rather's much-publicized on-air confrontation with then GOP
presidential candidate George Bush during a ``CBS Evening News''
interview in early 1988.
   Burke blamed part of the program's ratings slide on what he
called statistical errors in the Nielsen ratings system and on the
programs of other broadcast outlets such as the 24-hour Cable News
Network.
   ``There is increasing competition from CNN, which means you
don't have to make an appointment to watch the news anymore, you
have it on all the time, and I think they do a fine job,'' Burke
said.

   There was a cake, flowers, guests, a judge
to perform the ceremony and the bride wore a blue chiffon gown.
   The groom didn't know anything about it.
   Frances Upchurch, 45, staged the surprise Monday in her office.
Groom Vance Helms, also 45, thought he was coming to pick her up
for lunch.
   ``Everywhere we called, for flowers, food, everywhere _ nobody
believed that the groom didn't know about the wedding. It took a
lot of explaining, especially to the judge we asked to perform the
ceremony,'' Ms. Upchurch said.
   The couple had planned to have a brief civil ceremony later this
week, said Vance.
   But when he opened Ms. Upchurch's office door he was greeted by
Judge Robert J. Smith, a large crowd of other people, and cameras.
   Vance backed out and closed the door.
   ``When I saw (the judge) in those black robes, that was when I
realized that this was the real thing,'' Helms said.
   ``Are you ready?'' asked the judge.
   ``Yes,'' Helms replied.
   ``We have the reputations of being the dullest, most respectable
people you know,'' Ms. Upchurch said. ``We're the last people you
would expect to do something like this.''

   You meant to see that art show at the museum but
it closed before you got there. Or, you didn't want to stand in
line. Or, perhaps the exhibit never came to your city. Could it be
you're a couch potato?
   Don't fre. Art museums are entering the video business, making
tapes of exhibitions for those who want something a little more
highbrow than ``Batman'' or the latest installment of ``Friday the
13th.''
   The Museum of Modern Art on Tuesday became the latest
institution to enter the video stores with a 60-minute tape tied to
its ``Picasso and Braque: Pioneering Cubism'' exhibit.
   The unprecedented exhibit, with nearly 400 art works from 14
countries, including the Soviet Union, closed Tuesday and cannot
travel because of lenders' concerns, said Richard Oldenburg, the
museum's director.
   So for art lovers who could not see the show in New York, ``This
is the best substitute we can provide,'' Oldenburg said. ``It
certainly comes alive a lot better than any catalog can, no matter
how good the catalog is.''
   The tape will be distributed by a Chicago-based company, Public
Media Inc., under its fine arts label, Home Vision. Edward Ruehle,
a company spokesman, said Home Vision's more than 300-title catalog
includes about a dozen videos tied to museum exhibitions.
   The MOMA tape will sell initially for $19.95.
   Other exhibit-related tapes have been produced by such
institutions as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the
National Gallery of Art in Washington.

   Fire swept through a building housing
textile workshops Tuesday, killing 16 young workers and injuring 10
others, police said.
   The blaze started on the second floor of a five-story building
in the central Istanbul district of Kumkapi, a police officer said.
   The flames quickly spread to other floors containing the textile
workshops, the officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Most of the dead had been unable to leave their synthetic-fabric
weaving workshops because of the intensity of the fire and
suffocated, he said.
   He said 10 others who had been injured were taken to hospitals.
One was in serious condition.
   A firefighting official said he suspected the blaze began in the
electrical system but that authorities had yet to complete their
investigation.

<TEXT>
   The evangelist who introduced PTL founder
Jim Bakker to secretary Jessica Hahn pleaded innocent Tuesday to
charges that he lied to a grand jury about his motive for setting
up the fateful meeting.
   John Wesley Fletcher, 49, a frequent guest on Bakker's TV show,
entered the plea to one perjury count before U.S. Magistrate Paul
Taylor, who set trial for the court's April term.
   It was the disclosure of hush payments to Ms. Hahn following her
1980 sexual liason with Bakker that eventually led to the demise of
Bakker's multimillion-dollar PTL television empire.
   Bakker is now serving a 45-year federal prison term after being
convicted last fall of fraud and conspiracy. He was found guilty of
bilking followers who sent him $158 million in exchange for free
lodging guarantees at his Heritage USA Christian retreat in nearby
Fort Mill, S.C.
   Another former Bakker associate, the Rev. Sam Johnson, did not
appear in court for his arraignment on perjury charges. Court
officials said Johnson's attorney had given notice that his client
would waive his right to appear at his arraignment.
   The attorney, Bill Osteen, told the U.S. District Court clerk's
office that he would enter Johnson's plea Wednesday. Last month,
Johnson said he intended to plead innocent.
   Both men are accused of lying to the special grand jury that
investigated PTL's operations under Bakker's leadership. That panel
met for 17 months before indicting Bakker and three of his former
associates.
   Fletcher had met Ms. Hahn when he conducted revival services on
New York's Long Island, where she was a church secretary.
   Fletcher told the grand jury during one appearance that he
didn't introduce Bakker and Ms. Hahn with the idea that they would
have sex. But during a later appearance before the grand jury,
Fletcher said sex was the motive behind the introduction and that
Bakker had told him to ``Get me a woman.''
   Prosecutors said they don't plan to call Ms. Hahn as a witness
at Fletcher's trial.
   Fletcher told reporters he is working part-time with his brother
in the roofing business in Durham. He declined to comment on the
charges following the hearing.
   Johnson, former pastor of Heritage Village Church at PTL, is
accused of lying to the grand jury about the source of a $10,000
loan that he made to one of Bakker's aides. The money eventually
was given to Ms. Hahn to keep her quiet about the 1980 encounter
with Bakker, the indictment said.
   Johnson gave the money to former PTL executive vice president
Richard Dortch in November 1984. Ms. Hahn later received $265,000
in PTL money in exchange for her silence, the indictment said.
   Dortch, who was charged with Bakker, pleaded guilty to fraud and
conspiracy charges and was sentenced to eight years in prison and
fined $200,000.
   Two other former Bakker associates _ brothers James and David
Taggart _ were convicted of evading tax payments on more than $1.1
million in PTL funds that they used for personal expenditures.
   If convicted, Johnson and Fletcher each face up to five years in
prison and fines of up to $250,000.

   ``First Lady From Plains'' by Rosalynn Carter was the first tape
Mrs. Bush used in the new waterproof pouch and headset a friend

   Mrs. Bush, who also has read books by Betty Ford and Lady Bird
Johnson, said she will write a book of her own based on 30 years of
diaries after leaving the White House. She doesn't envision using
negative portrayals as Nancy Reagan did in ``My Turn.''
   However, Mrs. Bush refused to criticize that style.
   ``Each person does their own thing,'' she said, promising her
book won't be a ``kiss and tell.''

<TEXT>
   A Chicago suburb agreed Tuesday to allow
contruction of a group home for the retarded in a federal court
settlement that may ease efforts to build housing for the
handicapped across the nation.
   Chicago Heights also agreed to pay $45,000 in damages and report
for five years all actions affecting housing for the handicapped.
   ``We hope other communities will get the message that the
handicapped have rights under the Fair Housing Act,'' said James P.
Turner, acting head of the Justice Department's civil rights
division.
   ``If local officials don't pay attention to those rights, they
will pay damages for violating them,'' Turner said.
   Under the consent decree approved by U.S. District Judge William
T. Hart, Chicago Heights agreed to issue a zoning permit before
week's end to Residential Facilities Management Services Inc., of
Galesburg, Ill. The permit will allow construction of a group home
for 15 retarded adults.
   The agreement settles lawsuits filed June 20 by the Justice
Department and the next day by the corporation charging the City
Council violated the Fair Housing Act when it voted May 1 to turn
down a request for the zoning permit.
   The lawsuits were the first brought by the government under the
Fair Housing amendment enacted last year to protect the handicapped.
   The lawsuits contended the City Council vote was motivated by
opposition from residents prejudiced against the retarded.
   Chicago Heights, while not admitting to any discrimination,
agreed to pay $30,000 to RFMS for construction delays and $1,000 to
each of the 15 people who eventually will live in the home.
   The city contends the permit was denied because RFMS had not
supplied necessary documents with its application.
   ``The fact that the inhabitants happened to be developmentally
disabled was not a factor,'' said Chicago Heights lawyer Nick J.
DiGiovanni.
   He said the city agreed to the settlement ``in recognition of
the cost saving of not having to go to trial to be vindicated.''
   Under the agreement, Chicago Heights officials also must report
to the federal government for the next five years any other
applications they receive from anyone wanting to operate a facility
for the handicapped.
   They must report within five days any changes made in local laws
governing such facilities.
   RFMS must submit site plans and other documents to the city, and
pledge that the home will not be used to care for mentally ill or
emotionally disturbed patients. It also must limit the number of
residents to 15.
   Justice Department spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade said the
settlement may make it easier for the government to obtain court
orders in future cases involving the refusal of local governments
to grant permits for group homes.
   ``Our hope is that this (agreement) will be noted by other
communities, not only in the Chicago metropolitan area of Illinois,
but nationwide _ that it's impermissible for them to deny access to
living accommodations on behalf of developmentally disabled
persons,'' said Richard E. Friedman, attorney for RFMS, which
operates 55 group homes in 35 other Illinois communities.
   Group homes for the handicapped, usually established in
residential neighborhoods, are designed to encourage independence.
Residents live under supervision, but are given greater
responsibility for everyday decisions than in other facilities.

   Mexican authorities are looking into claims
that a murdered U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent was
actually in league with drug traffickers, Mexico's attorney general
said Tuesday.
   At a memorial service for 44 Mexican narcotics agents killed in
the line of duty, Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo
said Mexican officials had no independent corroboration of press
reports that the DEA agent, Enrique Camarena, was corrupt.
   ``We are checking the basis of those reports,'' said Alvarez,
who refused to give further details in a brief encounter with
reporters.
   The reports, which involved marijuana busts in northwestern
Mexico, surfaced last week after the broadcast of the NBC-TV
miniseries ``Drug Wars,'' based on Camarena's murder in 1985 by top
Mexican drug traffickers.
   U.S. officials have denied Camarena was corrupt in any way,
noting the charges were old and never backed by any evidence.
   The miniseries, which showed corrupt Mexican officials aiding
narcotics traffickers and thwarting the investigation of Camarena's
murder, caused controversy in Mexico. Comments on NBC News programs
that followed the miniseries angered Mexicans by suggesting the
corruption that killed Camarena still exists.
   Alvarez's remarks overshadowed a speech by President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari to 400 law enforcement officials and relatives
of the dead officers in which Salinas vowed to press the fight
against official corruption.
   ``The first condition for attacking narcotics trafficking is to
dismantle and destroy the networks of corruption that protect it,''
Salinas said.
   Salinas has made an effort to remove drug trafficking as an
irritant in U.S.-Mexico relations, winning praise from U.S.
officials for vigorously pursuing drug traffickers.
   Such pursuit has resulted in the seizure of 36 tons of cocaine
in the 13 months Salinas has been in office _ more than was seized
the previous 10 years.
   Nevertheless, the government newspaper El Nacional published a
front-page story Friday that quoted anonymous sources as saying
Camarena had been murdered because he had betrayed the drug
traffickers he worked for.
   DEA spokesman Frank Shultz in Washington said there was ``not a
scintilla of evidence whatsoever that Enrique Camarena was involved
with the traffickers in any way other than an adversarial role.''
   Elaine Shannon, author of the book ``Desperados,'' on which the
miniseries was based, said Mexican authorities began attacking
Camarena's integrity in 1985 in order to divert attention from
themselves and even tried to set up a fake bank account to prove
Camarena took dirty money.
   ``It's rather sad that the Mexican government is reduced to this
transparent attempt at slander rather than to try to improve their
government's own ability to enforce their laws, protect their
citizens and bring drug traffickers and the people who killed
Camarena to justice,'' Shannon said.
   Kingpins Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo were
sentenced in December to 40 years in prison without parole for the
Camarena murder, but many U.S. officials believe the full story has
not been told.
   The memorial ceremony at Mexico City's airport was hastily
arranged to demonstrate Mexico's commitment to the fight against
drug trafficking following the Jan. 7, 8 and 9 ``Drug Wars''
broadcasts.
   Meanwhile, a Mexican advertising group bought full-page ads in
The Washington Post, The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times
to outline Mexico's anti-drug efforts. The ads cost a total of
$124,340.
   ``Drug Wars'' itself appeared in English on Mexico City's cable
TV system, and a Mexican network broadcast a program Sunday that
purported to expose the program's errors and included mention of
the accusations against Camarena.
   NBC has defended the program and its reporting since then.
   Mexican officials say the controversy will not affect working
relations between the two governments, especially in narcotics.
   ``We do not deny our problems, nor do we look for excuses for
our errors,'' Salinas said.
   ``Although the great majority of our agents have demonstrated
great valor in fighting drug trafficking, I repeat, we will
energetically punish those who involve themselves in drug
trafficking,'' he said.
   Salinas' promises to fight corruption were given an added edge
by the arrest of four Mexico City police officers on rape charges.
   The attorney general's office refused to comment on published
reports at least three of the accused had been bodyguards for
Javier Coello Trejo, the assistant attorney general in charge of
the fight against drug traffickers.

<TEXT>
   Gun control advocates Tuesady marked the first
anniversary of the massacre of five California schoolchildren by
announcing they want a government ban on imports of semi-automatic
assault-style pistols.
   ``These are killing machines,'' said Susan Whitmore of Handgun
Control Inc., adding that the organization will petition the
government Wednesday to eliminate imports of such pistols as the
Uzi and the HK-94, shorter versions of assault-style rifles banned
last summer.
   Among the 43 types of assault-style rifle imports banned last
July was the popular AK-47 model used by 24-year-old drifter
Patrick Purdy to kill five children and wound 29 others and a
teacher on Jan. 17, 1989, at a school playground in Stockton, Calif.
   But the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms as well as the National Rifle Association say banning the
imports of the pistols will be a lot more difficult than the
banning of the rifles.
   The handgun regulations in place for the past two decades were
intended to rule out cheap ``Saturday night specials,'' not
well-made, sophisticated assault-style weapons, said ATF spokesman
Jack Killorin.
   Those handguns that met the criteria ATF established after
Congress approved the Gun Control Act of 1968 _ including such
things as barrel length, round size, overall length and weight _
have been considered to have met the sporting use requirement
imposed on all imports, he said.
   The ATF had more leeway to ban imports of the semi-automatic
assault-style rifles because ``in essence, a new form of weapon had
appeared ... that had been relatively unexamined under the law. Now
you look at the issue of handguns and the degree to which that has
been examined. ... This is an area that doesn't lack examination.
It has been established and in practice for over 20 years.''
   Because of the extensive legislative history and long-standing
regulations for handgun imports, ``It would be much more difficult
for us'' to ban certain handgun imports, he said.
   ``I don't know how one would design criteria that would exclude
the firearms they're talking about and not exclude all the other
firearms,'' said Jim Baker, the NRA's director of governmental
affairs. ``I think that Handgun Control would like to ban anything
that there's a political or emotional opportunity to ban, and this
is consistent with that policy.''
   But David G. Mengebier, Handgun Control's legislative counsel
who wrote the petition, said that, like the assault-style rifles
banned last July, the assault-style pistols also reflect new
technology and a new situation that calls for new regulations not
accounted for in the legislative history.
   ``All of the factors which ATF considered persuasive in banning
the importation of semi-automatic assault rifles are present and
applicable to semi-automatic assault pistols,'' the petition says.
   ``With the exception of their length, semi-automatic assault
pistols are identitical to semi-automatic assault rifles in terms
of their evolutionary development, design, physical components and
intended use,'' the petition says.
   Killorin said the ATF could look at how the pistols are being
used ``in real life. One of the things that drove the issue of the
semi-automatic assault (rifles) were the astonishing numbers that
were beginning to appear for importation. We may take a look at how
many of these are coming in. These may not be a significant import
item.''
   Mengebier said in an interview that his organization has not
been given access to import figures for 1989 because they are
considered proprietary information, but he said, ``It's safe to say
that thousands have been authorized for importation or are being
imported.''

   President Bush urged Americans to learn how to
prevent childhood poisonings as he signed a proclamation Tuesday
designating March 18-24 as National Poison Prevention Week.
   The United States, by congressional decree, has observed Poison
Prevention Week during the third week of March since 1961. In that
time, there has been a 93 percent drop in the number of deaths in
children who accidentally swallow medicines or household chemicals.
   Accidental poisonings claimed the lives of 450 children under
age 5 in 1961, according to an estimate by the Consumer Product
Safety Commission. In 1987, the latest year statistics were
available, 31 children died from accidental poisoning.
   ``While many tragic deaths have been prevented in recent years,
we still have much work to do,'' Bush said.
   ``Accidental poisonings can be prevented if parents,
grandparents and other guardians keep medicines and household
chemicals out of the reach of children. Adults should also be sure
to store all potentially harmful substances in packages with
child-resistant closures.''

<TEXT>
   The survival of U.S. television networks in
the 1990s will depend on how they compete in a rapidly changing
marketplace, NBC President Robert C. Wright told TV programmers
Tuesday.
   ``The major broadcast networks are still locked into essentially
one business and one traditional source: revenue from
advertisers,'' Wright said in the keynote address to the 27th
annual gathering of the National Association of Television
Programming Executives.
   ``The cost of network programs is outpacing the growth of that
revenue, and 3{ broadcast networks and 27 cable networks are
bobbing around today in a modestly growing advertising
marketplace.''
   Networks will see more new competitors, a diminished audience
share and ``their very modest profit margins continue to shrink,''
he said.
   ``The boundaries are disappearing,'' Wright said, but
governmental regulations are forcing the networks ``to live behind
television's equivalent of the Berlin Wall.''
   He cited Fox television's emergence as a competing network and
Japanese electronics giant Sony Corp.'s purchase of CBS Records and
Columbia Pictures.
   Movie studios buy TV stations and cable TV subsidiary Turner
Communications has one of the largest TV and film libraries in the
world.
   Against this backdrop, the networks ``scream for freedom from
the shackles of obsolete, anti-competitive government
regulations,'' Wright said.
   Specifically, Wright cited the Federal Communications
Commission's financial-interest syndication regulations _ known in
the industry as ``fin-syn'' or FISR.
   The regulations bar NBC, ABC and CBS from having a financial
interest in programs they don't produce themselves, and also
prohibits the networks from being in program syndication or sharing
revenues from syndicated programs.
   NATPE's annual meeting is the largest marketplace for syndicated
programming in the world, but the network presence is minimal.
   ``The financial rules are an outgrowth of positions taken in the
1960s. They were intended to make the 1970s more competitive,''
Wright said.
   In 1983, after four years of hearings, the FCC, Federal Trade
Commission, and the Commerce and Justice departments concluded that
the rules should be abolished, he said. Political lobbying by the
movie industry kept the rules alive, he said.
   Letting the networks have a stake in entertainment programs
would help networks pay the bill on news and sports and support
network services to affiliates. ``Anything that restricts our
ability to compete for quality entertainment programming also
restricts the opportunity and profitability of more than 600
network-affiliated stations,'' Wright said.
   ``Financial interest doesn't guarantee us anything. It only
gives us an opportunity to produce and derive some ancillary
benefit from our success on the air,'' Wright said.
   Wright, in offering a series of predictions for the 1990s, said
the ``Berlin Wall'' of fin-syn rules ``will collapse and fall under
its own weight.''
   He also predicted that the creative financing techniques of
movie making will move into TV production. ``Distributors,
producers, exhibitors and syndicators will all have crossover
interests and investments,'' he said.
   Program standards will continue to stretch, he said. ``Some
services will do very nicely with programming that would be totally
unacceptable on other networks,'' he said. The major networks will
continue to meet the standards of most Americans, while others
``flirt with niche audiences who march to a different drummer.''
   Wright said the 1990s will be an exciting decade for television,
with more programs needed to fit the growing array of services to
the viewer.
   ``Less bureaucracy, more entrepreneurship, less history, more
future,'' Wright said. ``The creative, the patient, the focused
will survive. The slow, the encumbered, and the backward-looking
will fail.''

<HEAD>U.S. Increasing Sugar Import Quotas By 14 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
announced Tuesday a 14 percent increase in the amount of foreign
sugar that can be imported by U.S. processors from 39 countries.
   Yeutter said the increase boosts the sugar import quota to
2,584,865 metric tons for the period Jan. 1, 1989, through Sept.
30, 1990, an increase of 325,000 tons.
   ``This change in the level of the quota is necessary to counter
the tightness in domestic sugar supplies caused by the unexpectedly
low production of beet sugar and damage to the Florida and Texas
sugar cane crops resulting from the December freeze,'' Yeutter said.
   New country-by-country allocations announced by U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills showed increases for nations approved to
ship sugar to the United States. However, Panama continued to have
its quota suspended and will not be allowed to ship to the U.S.
market at this time, she said.
   Quotas are used to restrict the amount of foreign sugar that can
enter the United States, thus protecting domestic producers from
lower-priced foreign sugar being dumped on the U.S. market.
   Revised allocations for the period Jan. 1, 1989 through Sept.
30, 1990, in metric tons of 2,205 pounds each, included:
   Argentina, 104,160.
   Australia, 201,054.
   Barbados, 16,957.
   Belize, 26,646.
   Bolivia, 19,379.
   Brazil, 351,238.
   Canada, 26,646.

<HEAD>War-Games Promoter Denounced for ``Get-Rushdie'' Game</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A promoter of ``executive war games'' said Tuesday
he is having second thoughts about a contest whose objective is the
mock assassination of novelist Salman Rushdie.
   ``Perhaps, with hindsight, it was an unfortunate idea,'' said
Ian Lawson, director of Skirmish, a country lodge where executives
work off stress by fighting mock battles.
   Bob Gregory, a spokesman for Rushdie's publisher, Viking
Penguin, denounced the game as ``disgraceful and in bad taste.
Here's a human being in hiding for fear of his life and they're
making a game out of it. It's beyond belief.''
   Rushdie has been in hiding for 11 months following the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's appeal to Moslems to kill him for
writing ``The Satanic Verses,'' a novel some Moslems find
blasphemous.
   Contacted by telephone at the lodge near Guisborough in northern
England, Lawson said the game entailed one team chasing a man in a
luminous dinner jacket who carries a shield called ``The Book,''
while the opposing team defends him.
   The players try to ``shoot'' him with paint guns while he tries
to escape to a safe spot called ``The Publishers,'' and then to
another place called ``The Safe House,'' Lawson said.
   He said he had not meant to offend anyone, and was trying to
contact Viking Penguin to apologize. He said that in view of the
criticism after the story surfaced in the local press, he might
drop the Rushdie angle from the game.
   ``Those who come to play are not coming to shoot Salman Rushdie.
They come to have a fun day out and enjoy a variety of games,
including this one,'' he said.
   Lawson said another game being developed for the lodge is ``The
Noriega Game,'' in which one team defends a player representing the
ousted Panamanian dictator, while the other side tries to kidnap
him.

   The free speech rights of three Illinois
residents were violated when they were rejected for state jobs or
promotions because they failed to support Republicans, an attorney
told the Supreme Court on Tuesday.
   In a case that will determine whether partisanship must be put
aside when public employers hire, promote or transfer, attorney
Mary Lee Leahy asked the justices to apply past rulings that ban
firings.
   ``Jobs are important to people, promotions are important to
people,'' Mrs. Leahy said.
   ``The state has an obligation to be neutral when granting the
benefits that are stake in this case,'' she said.
   Mrs. Leahy represents two men and a woman who say their job
status suffered because they did not vote in Republican primaries
or give money to the party.
   Their lawsuit, which had been thrown out by two lower courts,
targets Gov. James R. Thompson, the Republican Party of Illinois
and leaders of several state agencies.
   Mrs. Leahy said the governor's office has controlled all new
hires since 1980. In her written brief to the court, she included a
form that is used to screen state employees who seek a promotion
and live in Sangamon County.
   The form asks employees to declare how they, or in some cases
their parents, voted in primary elections. It also asks whether the
person would be willing to work for Republicans during an election.
   The attorney for Thompson and Illinois Republicans said
officials followed the state personnel code, which require tests
when people apply for a job.
   ``All the people who were hired or promoted qualified under the
code,'' attorney Thomas P. Sullivan said.
   But he also acknowledged that when officials examine the field
of qualified candidates, they might favor someone who has the same
political stripe.
   Sullivan said that hiring political supporters stimulates good
government because the employee is likely to appreciate the job
and, in turn, serve the public well.
   Both attorneys were interrupted several times by the justices.
   Justice Antonin Scalia said many political scientists believe
patronage simply is ``part of the spoils system,'' and helps
preserve the country's two-party system.
   Mrs. Leahy replied: ``This is not a way to preserve a two-party
system, but a one-party system.''
   The Supreme Court, in a 1980 ruling that significantly weakened
patronage, said government workers may not be fired solely because
of their political affiliation unless that affiliation was an
appropriate requirement of carrying out their jobs.
   The court, however, did not address the issues raised in the
Illinois case: hiring, promotion and transfer.
   The lead petitioner is Cynthia Rutan, who has worked for the
Illinois Department of Rehabilitative Services since 1974. She has
applied for promotions but has not received one. She also has not
supported Republicans, unlike people who were promoted over her.
   Franklin Taylor has worked for the Illinois Department of
Transportation as an equipment operator for 21 years. He sought a
promotion in 1983 and said he was rejected because he did not have
an endorsement from Fulton County Republicans.
   The third petitioner is James Moore. He said he has tried to get
a state job, particularly with the Corrections Department, since
1978, but has failed because he could not obtain the signatures of
the Pope County Republican chairman and a local GOP lawmaker.

<HEAD>State Department Seeks Explanation Of Reported Shamir Comment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Tuesday it asked
Israel to explain reported comments by Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir that the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip should be used to
settle Jews from the Soviet Union.
   The department warned that money given to Israel by the U.S.
government cannot be used to settle immigrants in the occupied
territories, where about 70,000 Israelis live among 1.7 million
Palestinians. The U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv has contacted the
Israeli government about the remarks Shamir made Sunday night to a
meeting of his right-wing Likud bloc, a U.S. official said.
   Israel expacts as many as 300,000 Soviet Jews will arrive in
coming years under the liberalized policies of Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev, and Shamir aides want to direct the flow of
immigrants to the territories.
   ``For a large immigration we need the Land of Israel, a great
and strong Israel,'' Shamir told the Likud. ``We will need a lot of
place to absorb everybody,'' he added. The statement was broadcast
Monday on Israeli radio.
   The term ``Land of Israel'' is used by Likud members and other
hardliners in references to Israel and the occupied territories,
which were captured from Jordan and Egypt by Israel in the 1967
Middle East war.
   We ``are seeking to clarify what he actually said,'' said State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler. ``We do not provide U.S.
government resources or funds for settlement of new immigrants in
the occupied territories. Our current program is explicitly limited
to Israel and not the occupied territories.''
   Shamir has also come under attack from the left-leaning Labor
Party, his partner in the coalition government, which advocates
trading some of the occupied land for peace.
   Israeli officials say they need $3 billion to absorb 100,000
immigrants over the next three to five years. They are seeking at
least $350 million in donations from American Jews and have asked
for the U.S. government to guarantee $500 million in housing loans.

<TEXT>
   The new U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees began
work this week, heading an agency with limited funding and whose
former chief resigned amid allegations of misuse of funds.
   ``It's no joke to lead an organization that is supposed to help
15 million people in such a difficult time and with an extremely
tight budget. Still, my old dream has been fulfilled,'' Thorvald
Stoltenberg was quoted Tuesday as saying.
   Stoltenberg, 58, a former Norwegian foreign minister and
ambassador to the United Nations, was elected for a four-year term
by the U.N. General Assembly on Nov. 20 to replace Jean-Pierre
Hocke.
   A UNHCR statement said Stoltenberg appointed Douglas Stafford,
an American, as Deputy High Commissioner for Refugees. Stafford was
formerly in charge of finance and administration at the U.N.
Development Program in New York.
   Although Stoltenberg is responsible only for political refugees,
he was quoted as telling the Oslo newspaper Aftenposten that he
cannot ignore those who fled poverty rather than persecution.
   Hall said Tuesday the worldwide refugee population rose by
700,000 last year, swelled by an influx into Ethiopia of people
fleeing the conflict in neighboring Somalia and Sudan, and by
continuing movements of refugees from Mozambique into Malawi,
southern Africa.
   Afghans constitute the largest refugee population, about 5.5
million in Pakistan and Iran.
   The UNHCR is trying to implement an austerity package to cut a
$40 million deficit carried over from 1989. Spending is to be
limited to $190 million the first half of this year.
   Hocke, Stoltenberg's Swiss predecessor, resigned following
allegations he misused a special educational fund financed by
Denmark and Sweden to upgrade air tickets from business class to
first class.
   Stoltenberg served as Norwegian foreign minister from March 1987
until Gro Harlem Bruntland's Labor party government resigned in
October. He then took up the U.N. ambassadorship in New York.

<HEAD>State Sees No Explosion Hazard in Nuclear Waste Tanks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington state officials have tentatively
concluded that chemicals put in tanks of radioactive waste at the
Hanford nuclear reservation do not pose a serious risk of
explosion, the state's top health official said Tuesday.
   Kristine Gebbie, secretary of the state department of health,
said preliminary results of a study by state health and ecology
officials found no special hazard existed from the chemicals. She
said a conclusion had not been reached.
   The existence of the chemical ferrocyanide in the waste tanks,
and the possibility that the mixture could trigger a massive
explosion, was detailed in a 1984 study for the Energy Department
that was kept secret until last fall.
   The chemical was added to the tanks in the mid-1950s to help
separate the radioactive metals from the liquid waste. The wastes
were generated by the Hanford nuclear reactors, which produced
plutonium for the nation's atomic weapons.
   Ms. Gebbie disclosed the state's preliminary assessment of the
potential hazard in response to questions from reporters after a
meeting with Energy Secretary James D. Watkins. Ms. Gebbie is
chairman of a panel of experts advising Watkins on ways to
restructure and improve the department's health research activities.
   She provided no details of the preliminary study of the tank
waste hazards.

<HEAD>Soviet Lawmaker Says Perestroika Facing Toughest Test</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Unrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet lawmaker said Tuesday that sending the
army into the Caucasus to deal with feuding Armenians and
Azerbaijanis puts Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika policy to its
toughest test.
   ``We think that perestroika is now experiencing its most serious
and most dangerous period,'' said Sergei Stankievich, a member of
the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies.
   ``I think it is one of the most serious setbacks,'' he said in
an interview from Moscow with Britain's commercial television
Channel 4 News.
   Stankievich added, however, that he considered the move
necessary to stabilize a volatile situation and eventually would
bring both sides to the negotiating table.
   Speaking in English, he said there was danger in using the army
in Azerbaijan because it might then have to be used elsewhere to
put down uprisings in other Soviet republics contending with ethnic
disputes or pro-independence movements.
   ``It is a real danger for us since we have unrest in many
regions of the country. We should avoid the possibility of making
the army the universal tool of perestroika in other regions,'' he
said.
   Stankievich said the unrest in Azerbaijan and the Baltic
republics presented a real danger of perestroika being derailed.
   ``But we think as soon as we have a real breakthrough in our
economy, as soon as we show we are very serious in our devotion to
radical political reform, then ethnic tension can be eased,'' he
said.
   Stankievich was described in the program as a radical lawmaker
for Moscow and a critic of Gorbachev. He explained that he and
those who think like him are critical in general of Gorbachev's
``inconsistency and devotion to half-measures.''
   ``We hope Gorbachev will survive in this very intensive conflict
and that he will make his choice in favor of further changes. We
shall support him in his reform efforts and we shall defend him
against any conservative attack,'' Stankievich said.
   He was asked by interviewer David Smith if ``politicians like
him who enjoy great popular support'' would now rally behind
Gorbachev.
   ``We have no other way out but to use the army to stabilize the
situation in order to stop bloody violence in our Caucasus,''
Stankievich said of the unrest, which has left at least 56 people
dead.
   ``We cannot stand aside from all this _ we cannot be only
eyewitnesses because the lives of thousands of people are at stake.
So we should react and use state force but we should try to find
some form of inter-ethnic reconciliation.''
   The legislator said he favored creation of a new autonomous
republic with its own government for Armenians inside Azerbaijan in
the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, ``with new opportunities
for the development of Armenian culture there.''
   Stankievich said Gorbachev missed the best time for such a
solution which was ``at least two years ago,'' when violence first
developed between the two communities.

<TEXT>
   Democrat James J. Florio became New
Jersey's 49th governor Tuesday, promising to use new ideas ``to
preserve the old ideals.''
   Florio, an eight-term congressman from southern New Jersey,
succeeds Republican Thomas H. Kean, who could not seek a third
consecutive term. Kean will become president of the private Drew
University in Madison.
   ``After 15 years in Washington, I return to New Jersey,'' Florio
told more than 1,800 people crowded inside the War Memorial hall
near the Statehouse. ``As I look out on this vast audience, let me
simply say, it's good to be home.''
   Florio, 52, succeeded the enormously popular Kean on a day of
prayers, parades and platitudes, but also inherited deep problems
that stand to make his first year in office a trying one.
   Backing up a campaign pledge to attack soaring auto insurance
rates, Florio called for a special joint session of the Legislature
on Monday to unveil his long-awaited strategy. New Jersey car
insurance premiums average about $1,000 per car and rank among the
highest in the nation.
   Florio won the Statehouse on his third try last November by
trouncing GOP nominee and fellow U.S. Rep. James Courter.
   ``My goal is a simple one. When I leave here, I want to be
remembered as the governor who brought new ideas to preserve old
ideals,'' said Florio.
   After his address to the War Memorial throng, Florio led the
first inaugural parade in New Jersey in more than 50 years. A
$500-a-plate Inaugural Ball capped the list of festivities on
inauguration day.

   The Military Airlift Command has removed
restrictions barring women from being crew members on cargo airdrop
missions, an Air Force spokesman said Tuesday.
   Women now may serve as pilots, co-pilots, loadmasters, flight
engineers or crew chiefs on C-130 or C-141 transport planes, said
Air Force Capt. George Sillia. Women earlier had been barred from
serving as crew members on airdrop missions.
   The decision will affect about 100 women among its 4,800 pilots
and a like number of women among enlisted crew members, Sillia said.
   Previously, women crew members were allowed to fly on C-141
aircraft to a specific location, unload the cargo and return.
However, women had not been allowed to be crew members on the
C-130, except the WC-130, a weather reconnaissance plane.
   The decision was made Dec. 14, six days before the U.S. invasion
of Panama during which Army women were reported to have taken part
in combat, Sillia said. The intervention delayed the formal
announcement.
   The command determined that airdrop missions don't fall under
the Defense Department's February 1988 ``risk rule,'' which says a
non-combat mission or unit can be closed to women if officials deem
that the risks are equal to or greater than those of the combat
mission they support.
   During the Panama fighting, Army Capt. Linda Bray directed a
successful raid by her military police company on a dog kennel
defended by Panamanian Defense Forces in a widely reported incident
that renewed the debate over the role of women in the military.
   Federal law prohibits women from serving in combat units in the
Air Force and Navy, while Army regulations ban such activity in
that service. However, some members of Congress have called for a
change in policy.
   On Tuesday, Barbara Bush said it would be fine with her for
women to serve in combat if they were physically strong enough
because ``certainly emotionally and mentally they are more than
able to compete with a man.''
   The crew change is a result of the command's review of
recommendations in the Defense Department's February 1988 report,
``Task Force On Women in the Military.''
   ``All positions are continually being reviewed,'' Sillia said.
``We're trying to open as many as possible.''

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Survived 2nd Assassination Attempt: Source</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani
survived an assassination attempt by a bodyguard this month,
reportedly the second such incident since October, an informed
source said Tuesday.
   The source, a Tehran resident speaking from a European capital
by telephone, said he learned of the attempt about two weeks ago
from a presidential bodyguard.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said another of
Rafsanjani's bodyguards tried to shoot the president but was
overpowered by two men before he could pull the trigger. The two
men were injured when the gun went off, he added, but Rafsanjani
escaped unharmed.
   The source had no other details.
   There has been no mention of the attempt in the news media of
the Islamic Republic or by Iranian dissident groups, usually quick
to report any sign of instability within the leadership.
   Powerful radicals within the Iranian government, who believe
Rafsanjani's pragmatic policies pollute the pure Islamic ideals
preached by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, have been openly
attacking his policies.
   Former Interior Minister Ali Akbar Montashemi, leader of the
radical camp and Rafsanjani's most formidable foe, was dumped by
Rafsanjani when he formed his new Cabinet in August.
   Sources say rivalry between the two has exacerbated since
Mohtashemi secured the Tehran seat in last month's parliamentary
elections.
   The reported attack was followed by a crackdown on Ayatollah Ali
Montazeri, once Khomeini's designated successor and now one of the
government's staunchest critics.
   The source said shopkeepers in the holy city of Qom, Montazeri's
home town, went on strike after the senior cleric was arrested for
a few hours.
   The Iranian opposition group Mujahedeen Khalq had reported
Montazeri's arrest Jan. 6 but said he was released after several
hours when tension mounted in the city.
   Rafsanjani, 55, reportedly survived an earlier similar
assassination attempt by another bodyguard last October. At a press
conference with foreign reporters in Tehran, Rafsanjani denied
there had been an attempt to assassinate him for several years.
   The attack was reported to have followed a secret meeting by
Rafsanjani and his Cabinet, during which a plan was suggested to
pull the country out of the economic doldrums.
   Last week Iran's supreme spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, who supports Rafsanjani, delivered a stern warning to the
radicals to stop undermining the government's efforts to improve
political and economic conditions in the country.
   Khamenei, whose commandments as spiritual leader are considered
religioulsy binding, threatened to ``act in all instances'' when
his orders were not obeyed.
   He called those who did not abide by his commandment
``traitors,'' and said efforts to undermine Rafsanjani's government
amounted to ``national treachery.''

<HEAD>Masked Raiders Attack Boat People in Hong Kong, 1 Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty masked and armed attackers on Tuesday
night rushed into a hut in a Vietnamese boat people detention
center and attacked those inside, killing one and injuring seven,
police said Wednesday.
   Police quickly brought the situation under control, but no
arrests were reported. A police investigation was launched.
   One of those injured was hospitalized.
   A police source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
because the detention center is a closed camp, authorities believe
the attackers are also boat people living in other huts.
   In the past months many fights erupted in the camps, with boat
people using iron bars, swords and lances as weapons.
   About 56,000 Vietnamese boat people now are housed in squalid
camps in Hong Kong. About 12,000 of them arrived before June 1988
and are considered refugees eligible for resettlement, but the rest
arrived later and are being screened. If they are classified as
illegal immigrants, they must either go home voluntarily or be
repatriated by force to Vietnam.
   On Dec. 12, Hong Kong repatriated 51 boat people against their
wishes.
   In London on Tuesday, British lawmakers Lord Ennals and Timothy
Raison said they found no evidence of force in that repatriation
and no evidence that those sent back were persecuted on their
return.
   Ennals and Raison, both former Cabinet ministers, said in a
report that the involuntary return ``involved an element of
overkill in the police presence and equipment used before departure
and on board the aircraft.''
   However, they said they reported finding no evidence of force
being used and said it was the method of return to which the boat
people objected.
   The two visited Vietnam last week at the British government's
request.
   They said they found in every case that the motives of the 51
repatriates for going to Hong Kong were economic.
   Ennals told a news conference he was unhappy about further
forcible repatriation. Raison said it was important to show
Vietnamese they could not go to Hong Kong, a British colony, in
hopes of moving on elsewhere.
   Britain has decided that many boat people went to Hong Kong to
seek a higher standard of living and not to escape political
persecution.
   On Monday, Amnesty International criticized the Hong Kong
government's treatment of boat people, accusing police and security
forces of beating them. The human rights organization said
investigations of official brutality were quashed by the agencies
involved.
   Britain and Hong Kong called the report unfounded and denied any
brutality.

   A teen-age mother who was jailed
with her infant daughter after pleading guilty to 10 theft charges
celebrated her release Tuesday at a champagne reception.
   ``I only hope the future holds happiness for me,'' said Tracey
Scott, 19, who had admitted she let friends walk out without paying
for their goods at the Huddersfield supermarket where she worked as
a cashier.
   Court of Appeal judges on Monday suspended a six-month sentence
given to Ms. Scott by Northern Circuit Court Judge James Pickles
who said he wanted to deter women from getting pregnant to avoid
jail.
   Ms. Scott, who was not in court Monday, appeared at a brief
hearing before the appeal judges in London on Tuesday and agreed to
serve two years' probation.
   Lord Lane, the lord chief justice, told her Pickles should have
put her on probation rather than send her to jail.
   He said Monday Pickles had been told before he sentenced Ms.
Scott that two women he had jailed for stealing from the store had
been freed on appeal. Yet, he said, Pickles insisted that for
helping them ``to loot'' the store, Ms. Scott deserved a custodial
sentence.
   At a party given by neighbors in Huddersfield, 160 miles north
of London, Ms. Scott said she wanted to see her lawyer before
commenting on Pickles or the two weeks she spent in jail with her
3-month-old daughter, Alesha.
   ``It's just great to be home,'' she said. ``The first thing I
did was have a bath. It was wonderful.''
   Ms. Scott said she did not know that she had won her appeal
until she was in court Tuesday. Her attorney, Ken Green, said it
was ``disgusting'' that no one told her she had won her appeal.
   Green said she was very bitter toward Pickles. ``She hopes the
highlighting of her case will direct attention to other mothers and
babies who are in prison,'' he said.
   Ms. Scott claimed Tuesday night that mothers were denied proper
medical help for their sick babies at Styal women's prison in
Cheshire in northwest England, where she was jailed.
   When she arrived at Styal, she said some of the babies there had
been suffering from diarrhea for up to two weeks. She said a prison
doctor had examined them and declared they were all right.
   ``Some of the mothers were hysterical,'' she said. ``Every feed
for the sick babies was coming up _ they couldn't keep it down. The
women were desperate for some outside medical help. They needed
proper medical advice _ it was worrying.''
   A Home Office spokesman, who by custom was not identified, said
it was not the department's policy to discuss individual cases.
   Pickles, 64, said he didn't want the mother and child to be
separated. He said that while he didn't accuse Ms. Scott of getting
pregant to avoid going to prison, he was afraid other women might
get that idea.
   Lord Lane said when he quashed the sentence that Pickles ``seems
to us to have been concerned more with the public import of what he
was doing and saying, rather than the justice of it.''
   Pickles is one of Britain's most outspoken judges and frequently
draws controversy for his sentencing.
   Last year, he jailed a woman who was too frightened to testify
against a man accused of beating her up. In January, he opted for
probation for a child molester, saying the man would have been
picked on by bullies in prison and that the arrest and court
appearance would likely have a chastening effect.
   Pickles, a judge since 1976, insists he is humane. He twice
delayed sentencing Ms. Scott until he was sure a place was
available for her and the baby in youth custody, where conditions
are less strict.
   Pickles reportedly was out of the country on vacation and has
declined to comment on the case.

   East Germany opened criminal investigations
Tuesday into protesters who stormed secret police headquarters, and
the nation's police chief said demand for reform must not turn into
something resembling civil war.
   Warning strikes for higher pay and faster reform hit several
cities, twinned with a condemnation of the government decision to
raise prices.
   In Bonn, the West German capital, Chancellor Helmut Kohl bowed
to pressure and scrapped plans to sign an agreement on closer ties
with Communist Premier Hans Modrow's caretaker government before
East Germany's May 6 elections.
   Even members of Kohl's own coalition said signing of such an
agreement must wait until a democratically elected government takes
over after free elections.
   Kohl told a news conference immediate on Tuesday that help is
needed for East Germany's ailing economy, adding that ``the
situation in the German Democratic Republic had gotten more
difficult.''
   The East Germany Communist Party daily Neues Deutschland called
it a ``street revolution'' and national police chief Dieter
Winderlich said of Monday's storming of secret police headquarters:
   ``We have to do everything so that the reform process can go
forward with the peaceful means that have characterized it to date,
to keep it from resulting in occurrences resembling civil war.''
   Hundreds of thousands of East Germans took to the streets Monday
to step up pressure against the Communists, with protesters at the
secret police building also breaking into the counterespionage area.
   The conservative Die Welt daily newspaper said in Bonn that
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was expected in East Berlin
in two or three weeks. It said Gorbachev, himself the target of
domestic unrest, plans a ``massive show of support'' for his
longtime friend Modrow.
   East Germany's sprawling secret police headquarters in East
Berlin on Tuesday remained under control of a ``citizens'
committee,'' regular police and government representatives after
Monday night's rampage.
   East Berlin prosecutor Gerhard Krueger said he was assigned by
the nation's top law enforcement official to investigate the most
serious incidents during the storming.
   Krueger said possible charges included hooliganism, theft,
trespass and serious damage to property. He said the government was
trying to enlist opposition groups in ``close cooperation'' to
track down suspects.
   The government has pledged to dismantle the secret police, but
opposition leaders still express doubt it will follow through.
   Many protesters Monday night looted the building, carrying away
clothing, wine and equipment.
   Some also broke into the section for counterespionage
activities, but did not succeed in discovering the identities of
the section's workers, Winderlich said.
   He put the number of people who stormed the complex at 50,000
and estimated damage in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
   The morning after the rampage, East Germans staged ``spontaneous
work stoppages'' in several East German cities, West Germany's
ZDF-TV network reported. East Germany's state television also
reported warning strikes.
   ZDF showed film of a public transport walkout in Gera, a city
about 110 miles south of East Berlin. Workers at a state-owned
factory in the southern city also reportedly staged a six-hour
strike.
   ``The people were using the warning strikes to protest against
the policies of the Communist Party and its still-lasting influence
in the factories,'' ZDF said. ``The strikers especially criticized
the dismantling of the state subsidies at the current time.''
   The new government has started abolishing price subsidies by
raising prices for children's clothes and related articles. The
government says apartment rents and costs of other essentials also
will rise.
   ``The sacred cow has been slaughtered,'' the government declared
in ending price subsidies, which have held down prices of goods,
services and housing for decades.
   Modrow himself has condemned warning strikes, saying the economy
must run ``without disturbances'' to pull out of an increasingly
serious slump.
   Neues Deutschland said organizers of protests like that at the
secret police headquarters must accept responsibility for the
consequences.
   ``Responsibility also means means having a clear idea about
consequences before calling for a demonstration, so that things
don't get out of hand,'' the newspaper said in a front-page
editorial.
   ``The call for `no violence,' which has marked the street
revolution from the start, becomes a farce when emotions break
through the bounds of reason.''
   Opposition leaders issued appeals for calm and urged
demonstrators to avoid further violence.

   A storm spread rain and snow into dry northern California on
Tuesday, while a broad band of precipitation dropped rain on the
southern Plains and snow on the northern Plains. Temperatures
climbed to record highs from Iowa to Pennsylvania.
   Northern California was doused by its second storm front since
last week, and meteorologists said the drought-fearing region was
finally moving into more of its typical wet winter pattern.
   ``We're into the storm track now,'' said meteorologist Randy
Hartley of the National Weather Service.
   California Drought Center spokesman Bill Helms in Sacramento
said the weekend's rain and snow helped reservoirs, ``but we're
still pretty far behind.''
   Shortly before noon, a pilot reported a funnel cloud about five
miles southwest of Hollister, Calif., about 60 miles south of San
Francisco.
   Northeast of San Francisco, 2 to 4 inches of snow accumulated at
higher elevations in the Truckee-Lake Tahoe area from Monday night
into Tuesday.
   Advisories for more snow were posted over northwestern
California, the Shasta-Siskiyou area, and the Sierra Nevada north
of Sequoia National Park, with as much as 8 inches of additional
snow possible at elevations below 7,000 feet and up to a foot
possible in higher mountains.
   To the north in Oregon, overnight snowfall ranged from 4 to 6
inches over the northern Cascades to about 3 inches across the
southern Cascades.
   On the Plains, showers and thunderstorms extended from
north-central Texas to Oklahoma, south-central Kansas, Arkansas and
northern Louisiana.
   Thunderstorms developed over western Oklahoma in the morning,
and hail up to 1 inch in diameter fell south of Taloga and near
Aline in the afternoon.
   Rain also fell from northeastern Nebraska and northern Iowa into
northwestern Illinois, changing to freezing rain from north-central
Nebraska through southeastern South Dakota.
   Snow showers reached from north-central Minnesota to North
Dakota, western South Dakota, southern and central Montana, western
Wyoming, eastern Idaho and northern Utah.
   In southwestern North Dakota, about 4 inches of snow fell
overnight and during the morning between Bowman and Mott. In nearby
Buffalo, S.D., 3 inches fell overnight.
   Unseasonably high temperatures extended over much of the central
Mississippi Valley into the Ohio Valley and Pennsylvania.
   Record highs were 61 degrees at Burlington, Iowa; 62 at
Harrisburg, Pa.; 63 at Indianapolis; 60 at Lamoni, Iowa; 71 at
Louisville, Ky.; 58 at Moline, Ill.; 57 at Ottumwa, Iowa; 61 at
Peoria, Ill.; and 71 at St. Louis, Mo. Wilkes Barre-Scranton, Pa.,
tied its record of 53.
   Peoria's old record of 60 degrees had been on the books since
1889.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 19
degrees in Limestone, Maine, to 83 in Naples, Fla.
   Tuesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 3 degrees above zero
at Rumford, Maine.

   The Supreme Court took a major step Tuesday
toward making its opinions quickly available via computer when it
agreed to let a 24-group consortium provide the necessary equipment.
   The consortium's equipment will be used to disseminate the
opinions to 10 to 15 media and legal organizations, which will then
relay the information more widely to newspapers, law firms and
other consumers.
   The Associated Press is among the media organizations seeking
middleman status as a distributor.
   A court committee overseeing the project said it had accepted an
offer from the Supreme Court Opinion Network, SCON, and soon will
begin discussions to determine what kind of equipment is needed.
   SCON, a non-profit consortium, also includes as its members the
American Bar Association, C-SPAN cable television network,
Knight-Ridder, Mead Data, United Press International and The
Washington Post.
   The equipment will be provided free of charge. Under the court's
ground rules, the parties bidding for middlemen distribution rights
had to be willing to supply the computer hardware and software.
West Publishing Co., a major legal publisher, had made an offer
similar to SCON's.
   Fourteen groups earlier had proposed separate delivery systems
and networks to the court. The court turned down all previous
proposals before deciding on this two-year test, which could begin
as early as this spring and will be administered by the court.
   The Associated Press, which was among the 14 originally
submitting proposals, intends to receive the opinions
electronically and make them available to its membership. The
details of the AP plan have not been made final, pending further
description of the court's system.
   The court will choose 10 to 15 middleman ``subscribers'' that,
for a $500 annual fee, will receive opinions electronically minutes
after they are announced and distribute them. The court describes
these middlemen as ``mass disseminators'' of information.
   The court committee said subscribers will be ``those 10 to 15
organizations the court determines can best provide opinions to the
broadest possible audience.''

<HEAD>Gov't Burns $100 Million Worth of Confiscated Animal Skins</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal troops on Tuesday set fire
to hundreds of thousands of confiscated Amazon animal skins valued
at $100 million to conclude a year-long government crackdown
against smugglers, officials said.
   Nearly a half-million furs and leather products, including
purses, belts and women's shoes, were destroyed in 15 states in
Brazil's largest burning of valuable skins in 20 years, said
Fernando Cesar Mesquita, president of the Brazilian Institute of
the Environment and Renewable Resources.
   In Rio de Janeiro, troops with flame throwers torched about
100,000 jaguar, crocodile, monkee, deer, cobra and wolf skins
valued at $4 million as journalists, ecologists and federal
authorities watched.
   ``This is to show people we mean business and to teach them to
respect the environment,'' Mesquita said in a telephone interview
from Brasilia, the capital.
   Most of the skins were confiscated from Brazilian and foreign
ships and planes destined for United States, Canada, Asia and
Europe, he said.
   In one raid, 70,000 skins were seized as they were unloaded at
the Narita International Airport in Japan, Mesquita said.
   He said federal police are searching for a Japanese man believed
to have arranged the shipment of 40,000 rare Amazonian animal skins
to Tokyo.
   ``One of the problems is that it's sometimes difficult to know
the difference between a lion skin and jaguar's,'' said Mesquita.
``You don't know if what shows up in stores is contraband or not.''
   He said the burning symbolized a renewed government effort to
stop poachers and preserve Brazil's tropical forests and the
variety of plant and animal species unique to the jungle.
   Since the late 1970s, at least 5 percent of the
2-million-square-mile Amazonian rain forest has been cut and burned
by locals trying to make a living farming in the region, the
government says.
   In that time, the number of animal, reptile and insect species
threatened by extinction has risen from 83 to 250, according to the
latest figures from last year, he said.
   ``People need to know what is happening to our fauna,'' said
Mesquita. ``Law enforcement is far below what is needed.''

   A convict who abducted and killed two
teen-agers and then ate their lunch was pushed closer toward the
gas chamber Tuesday when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the
death row inmate's appeal.
   ``Today's action by the United States Supreme Court makes it
almost certain that Robert Alton Harris will be the first murderer
executed in California in some 23 years,'' state Attorney General
John Van de Kamp said at a news conference.
   Harris, 37, was convicted in March 1979 in San Diego of shooting
John Mayeski, 15, and his friend, Michael Baker, 16, nine months
earlier so he could use the boys' car for a bank robbery.
   The Supreme Court rejected arguments that, among other things, a
sentencing jury wrongly was urged to consider Harris' age and
mental condition as factors pointing to death as the proper
punishment.
   Tuesday's action marked the fourth time the nation's highest
court has acted in the Harris case since 1981 during more than a
decade of appeals in state and federal courts.
   A hearing is expected within two weeks in San Diego Superior
Court to set an execution date for Harris, who could be the first
inmate put to death in California since 1967, when Aaron Mitchell
was led screaming to San Quentin's gas chamber and executed for the
killing of a Sacramento policeman.
   If no more stays are granted in the meantime, Harris could be
executed toward the end of March or early April, Van de Kamp said.
   However, defense lawyers Charles Sevilla and Michael McCabe have
a new habeas corpus petition before the California Supreme Court.
Among other things, it contains praise for Harris from fellow
prisoners and two prison guards, and argues that his progress in
prison shows the falsity of a psychologist's testimony at his trial
that Harris could never be rehabilitated.
   ``I urge the courts grant no further stays of execution,'' the
attorney general said. ``He's trying to stay alive literally by
ping-ponging back and forth between the various court systems.
There has to be some kind of end to that.
   ``These endless appeals and delays make a mockery of justice,''
Van de Kamp said.
   The defense attorneys issued a statement saying they were
disappointed by the Supreme Court's action. They said their appeal
filed last November ``raised serious issues we believed undermined
the constitutionality of the conviction and punishment.''
   Deputy Attorney General Louis Hanoian, who is handling the
appellate phase for the state, said there was nothing really new in
the latest defense petition in state court.
   ``I don't believe for a minute he has reformed,'' Hanoian said.
``He hasn't changed.''
   According to court records, Harris and his brother, Daniel,
decided to steal a car to use as their getaway vehicle in a 1978
bank robbery. They abducted Mayeski and Baker while the boys sat in
a car at a San Diego drive-in, taking them and their car to a
remote area near Miramar Lake.
   Daniel Harris, who testified for the prosecution, said his
brother shot Mayeski, then Baker. He said they then used the boys'
car in a bank robbery. He said Robert Harris later laughed about
shooting the boys while eating the meals they never finished.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama said Tuesday it is expelling
Peru's senior diplomat because of scornful remarks made by Peruvian
leaders following the U.S. invasion and Peru's delay in recognizing
the new government here.
   In Lima, the Peruvian government said it had protested Panama's
decision but would maintain its diplomatic mission in Panama City.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Juan M. Castulovich of Panama said its
decision did not signify a break in diplomatic relations.
   ``The diplomatic missions are being maintained. They are not
closing,'' he said.
   He said Peruvian Charge d'Affaires Luis Sandiga Cabrera was
given 72 hours to leave the country, and Panama is recalling its
charge d'affaires in Lima.
   ``Recent statements by Peruvian authorities make normal
relations between the two countries difficult,'' Castulovich said.
   Peruvian Foreign Minister Guillermo Larco Cox said in a
communique in Lima that Peru will reduce diplomatic personnel in
Pamana City but will keep its embassy open with a first secretary
to insure the safety of 12 Panamanians who sought refuge in the
Peruvian ambassador's residence last week.
   Two of those Panamanians are sought by U.S. authorities.
   President Alan Garcia of Peru has been one of the strongest
Latin American critics of the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion of Panama that
led to the overthrow and arrest of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and
his transfer to Miami where he is awaiting trial on drug
trafficking charges in federal court.
   Larco Cox has called President Guillermo Endara, an opposition
leader sworn in as Panama's president hours after the invasion
began, the ``Judas'' of Central America.
   Peru earlier had recalled its ambassador to Panama to protest
Noriega's refusal to respect Endara's election victory last May 7.
   U.S. troops have ringed the Peruvian, Nicaraguan and Cuban
missions in Panama City in which Noriega relatives, aides and
associates sought refuge.
   Noriega opponents have been holding demonstrations outside,
demanding surrender of the refugees. Noriega himself spent 10 days
in temporary refuge at the Vatican embassy before the pope's
diplomats persuaded him to give himself up Jan. 3 to American
troops.
   Panamanians granted Peruvian asylum include Gonzalo Gonzales, a
close associate of Noriega and his former chief of security, and
Maj. Heraclides Sucre, accused of executing Maj. Moises Giroldi, a
leader of an Oct. 3 abortive coup attempt against Noriega. Both men
are wanted by U.S. authorities.
   Peru's action in granting asylum to all 12 Panamanians inside
the residence drew sharp objections from Panamanian officials.
   Castulovich said Peru's request for safe conduct for those in
the residence depended on whether the government had charges to
file.
   Earlier Tuesday, Larco Cox told an impromptu news conference
Peru would give all Panamanian diplomats in Peru 72 hours to leave,
after which they ``will lose all their diplomatic rights and
immunity.''
   The communique did not explain the change in Peru's position,
but the aim appeared to be to insure the diplomatic protection of
of the Panamanians inside the residence.
   In another development Tuesday, leaders of the Democratic
Revolutionary Party that supported Noriega's regime surfaced to
announce they will organize ``as a democratic opposition'' to
Endara's government and publicly asked for the immediate withdrawal
of the U.S. military from Panama.

   A 5-year-old Centreville boy who fell
through ice and was submerged for 40 minutes has only a slim chance
for a full recovery, one of the doctors treating him said Tuesday.
   Police said George Sader was playing with other children on the
ice of a drainage pond in the Washington suburb of Centreville when
it broke Monday.
   ``Most of his major organs suffered from the insult of being
without any oxygen and blood flow for a prolonged period of time,''
said Dr. Craig Futterman, a pediatric internist at Fairfax Hospital.
   The boy ``requires quite a bit of effort to keep him stable,''
Futterman added.
   Among the organs damaged were the brain, liver and lungs, the
doctor said. ``We're going to have problems with brain swelling.
   ``His heart has done surprisingly well, considering the
circumstances,'' Futterman said.
   He said the boy had ``a 1 to 2 percent chance'' of a full
recovery.
   Another pediatrician, Gary Kavit, said it would be days or weeks
before doctors could determine the extent of brain damage.
   In recent years doctors have learned that young children often
can survive prolonged periods submerged in cold water because their
heartbeat and brain activity are drastically slowed. The colder the
water and the younger the child, the better the chances of
survival. Adults have lost the reflex that makes the bodily
processes slow down.
   Though paramedics performed CPR, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation,
doctors were unable to start the boy's heart once he arrived at the
hospital's emergency room. His body temperature was 90 degrees
Fahrenheit.
   He was hooked up to a heart-lung machine so his blood could be
warmed outside the body.
   Two girls with young Sader, Vivian Daniel, 12, and Carol Zakkak,
14, his cousin, fell in trying to rescue him but were not seriously
injured, authorities said.

<TEXT>
   An army colonel, three
lieutenants and four soldiers implicated in the massacre of six
Jesuit priests were brought before a civilian judge Tuesday to make
statements about the slayings.
   Col. Guillermo Benavides arrived at the downtown office of 4th
Penal Court Judge Ricardo Zamora in dress uniform and surrounded by
police. He made no comment to reporters, who were kept several
yards away.
   The lieutenants, two sergeants, a corporal and a soldier also
implicated in the Nov. 16 massacre arrived moments later. A ninth
soldier who allegedly took part in the slayings deserted last month
and is a fugitive.
   Zamora has 72 hours to decide if there is enough evidence to
charge the men and hold them for trial.
   President Alfredo Cristiani on Saturday said the men were the
prime suspects in the massacre, which also took the life of a cook
and her 15-year-old daughter.
   The suspects have been under arrest at several unidentified
military and police garrisons in the capital.
   Cristiani told ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' on Tuesday that
Benavides denies ordering the slayings.
   ``But the junior officers involved expressly have testified that
they received a direct order from him,'' Cristiani said.
   All the suspects except the colonel are members of the elite
Atlacatl infantry battalion. The Atlacatl unit was attached the
Military College at the time of the massacre. Benavides is director
of the college.
   Benavides is the highest ranking military officer to be accused
of a crime of human rights abuse in the 10-year-old civil war.
   No military officer has been convicted of rights abuse in the
civil war, even though rightist death squads sponsored or tolerated
by the armed forces killed thousands of suspected leftists in the
early 1980s.
   The killings of the Jesuit priests shocked El Salvador and the
world and prompted calls in the U.S. Congress for reappraisal of
the more than $1 million Washington supplies daily in aid to this
Central American nation.
   The slain Jesuits were also professors, the leadership of the
Central American University, or UCA, one of the region's top
colleges. They were murdered five days after rebels of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front launched their biggest
offensive of the war.
   The far-right had long considered the UCA Jesuits subversive
ideologues because of their position that the civil war was the
result of gross social injustice rather than international
communist expansion.

   Christian radio and television stations
suspended their newscasts Tuesday to protest a threat by Christian
Gen. Michel Aoun to close them down if they continue to refer to
President Elias Hrawi as head of state.
   Voice of Lebanon of the rightist Phalange Party, and Voice of
Free Lebanon of the Lebanese Forces militia broadcast a directive
from Aoun saying the media should not refer to Hrawi as president
or to Prime Minister Salim Hoss as head of government.
   The directive said Hrawi was merely a ``former member of
parliament'' and noted that the general declared the legislature
dissolved Nov. 4 to prevent the election of a head of state.
   After the broadcast, the radio stations said they were
suspending their hourly newscasts and ``abstaining from reporting
the news until a way is found to cope with the new directive.''
   Announcers at the stations indicated they viewed the directive
as an attempt to gag the press and introduce censorship.
   They were later joined by the Lebanese Broadcasting Corp., the
nation's widest viewed television station operated by the Lebanese
Forces, which said it was suspending its two evening newscasts
until further notice.
   The media in Lebanon reflect a broad spectrum of political
thought and take pride in being among the freest in the Arab world
despite the 14-year-old Moslem-Christian civil war.
   Aoun issued the directive in his capacity as information
minister of an interim military cabinet he has headed since Sept.
22, 1988, when President Amin Gemayel's term expired with
Parliament unable to elect a successor.
   He later summoned newspaper editors to the bunker of the
presidential palace and said he would expel from the Christian
enclave anyone failing to abide by his directive. Broadcast editors
were not called.
   ``I am going to apply the law against anyone who doesn't abide
by this directive. If you want to refer to Hrawi as the president,
you better pack and leave to the other side. If you want to stay on
here, then you have to abide by my legitimacy,'' Aoun told the
editors.
   Excerpts of the meeting in which he frequently interrupted the
editors when they protested his measures were broadcast by Aoun's
Channel-5 TV station.
   The army command of Gen. Emile Lahoud, who owes allegiance to
Hrawi's government, responded by warning the media against obeying
Aoun's directive or reporting any of his activity, calling him ``an
imposter.''
   The Aoun command ``has no legal power. ... Newspapers and other
news organizations are hereby warned against publishing its
statements,'' the Lahoud command said.
   Hoss is a Sunni Moslem and Aoun, Hrawi and Lahoud are Maronite
Catholics, the Christian community that has dominated Lebanon since
it gained independence from France in 1943.
   Their latest dispute aggravated a split within Christian ranks
over an Arab League-brokered peace plan to end the civil war, which
has claimed more than 150,000 lives since 1975.
   Under the plan, worked out by Lebanese parliamentarians in Saudi
Arabia, Hrawi was elected president Nov. 24, two days after the
assassination of his predecessor, Rene Mouawad, who held office
only 17 days.
   Hrawi dismissed Aoun as army commander and interim prime
minister. But the general held out in the Christian enclave and
refused to leave the presidential palace.
   Aoun's 20,000 mainly Christian troops control the
310-square-mile enclave northeast of Beirut.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, supports Hrawi and Hoss
as the legitimate administration.
   Aoun's directive described Hrawi and Hoss as ``power usurpers
... and collaborators with (Syrian) occupation.''
   It was not known whether the directive also applied to the
foreign media.
   Aoun had warned that it was within his legal power to close any
newspaper, radio or TV station that recognizes the Hrawi government.
   All Western agencies operating in Lebanon have their main
offices in the capital's Moslem sector, outside Aoun's power.
   Moslem and leftist radio stations, based outside the Christian
enclave, called Aoun's directive ``an exercise of intellectual
terror against the media.''

   Vice Premier and Finance Minister Shimon Peres
will meet with Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo on Jan. 24
to try to break the stalemate in the Middle East peace process,
Israel Television said Wednesday.
   Next Sunday, Peres will leave for Czechoslovakia to meet
officials there, the state television said.
   It would be the first top-level Israel-Egypt encounter since
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin's talks with Mubarak in Cairo in
September 1989.
   Peres aides could not be reached for comment despite repeated
phone calls.
   Earlier, Israeli media reports said U.S. Secretary of State
James A. Baker III may act as host at trilateral talks later this
week with Rabin and Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid of Egypt.
   Abdel-Meguid met unexpectedly with Baker in Washington on
Tuesday.
   Abdel-Meguid said later a date still cannot be set for the first
stage of negotiations on the future of the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip, occupied by Israel since 1967, but said some progress has
been achieved.
   Baker plans to meet Rabin, of Peres' left-leaning Labor party,
on Thursday.
   Peres clashed this month with his coalition partner and
political rival, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the hard-line
Likud bloc. Peres threatened to break up the governing coalition if
the impasse continues in the peace process.
   In a policy statement broadcast by Israel Radio Tuesday, Peres
listed four conditions Israel should meet to start preliminary
negotiations with the Palestinians, who have waged a revolt against
Israeli rule in the occupied lands for 25 months.
   Peres said Israel should agree to participation of two deported
Palestinians in the Palestinian delegation to such talks, and
should not limit the agenda to a proposal to hold elections in the
occupied territories. The Palestinians should consult any party
they see fit, he said.
   Finally, ``We should be content with the (U.S.) assurances we
got, since additional assurances would not give us anything,''
Peres said.
   Shamir opposes the first three suggestions, seeing in them an
attempt to bring in the PLO through the back door. Israel views the
Palestine Liberation Organization as a terrorist group and
officially refuses to negotiate with it.
   Shamir wants firm U.S. assurances the PLO would be excluded from
participation in the peace talks, and is not content with a draft
document with such guarantees provided by Baker this month.
   In addition, Shamir wants the talks limited to his offer of
holding elections in the occupied territories. This idea envisages
talks with elected representatives over a five-year trial period of
autonomy for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.
   Baker is trying to arrange a three-way meeting with Abdel-Meguid
and Israel's Foreign Minister Moshe Arens in Washington to set
Israeli-Palestinian talks in motion. The question of PLO
participation remains the main stumbling block.
   Egyptian officials, including Abdel-Meguid, denied they had any
plans for a tripartite meeting with Rabin at present. Israeli
Foreign Ministry officials refused to comment.
   But some Likud officials said it was ``possible,'' and Israel
army radio quoted Peres as saying Tuesday he ``strongly supports''
the idea.
   Some Israeli reports suggested Baker's hastened pace was an
attempt to pressure Shamir. The conservative Maariv daily, the
pro-Labor Davar newspaper and the state radio Tuesday quoted
unidentified State Department officials as telling American Jewish
leaders Israel was holding up peace efforts with ``petty
bargaining.''
   U.S. Senate minority leader Bob Dole, R-Kansas, on Tuesday
proposed cutting U.S. foreign aid to Israel, Egypt and other
largest recipients by 5 percent and switching the money to Eastern
Europe and Panama.
   Israel gets $3 billion a year and is the top recipient of U.S.
foreign aid.
   No immediate comment came from Israel, but the TV quoted
concerned officials as saying it was the first time a proposed cut
in U.S. aid seemed to enjoy White House support.
   In Washington, the Israeli Embassy issued a statement noting
that ``the winds of change'' that blew across Eastern Europe
``failed to reach the Middle East and the dangers Israel faces have
even increased.''
   ``Cutting military assistance to Israel at this delicate stage
of the peace process will send a negative message. Cutting economic
assistance at a time Israel gears itself toward the absorption of
hundreds of thousands of Jewish immigrants would make it almost
impossible to meet this challenge.''

<TEXT>
   Maoist insurgents attacked three Andean
villages while peasants slept, slaughtering 39 people, and army
troops killed six rebels who ambushed their patrol, military
authorities said Tuesday.
   The death toll from the violence Monday was the highest for a
single day this year.
   Military officials in Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima,
said the Shining Path guerrillas attacked Acosvinchos, Vinchuspata
and San Lucas before dawn Monday. The three villages are about 25
miles from Ayacucho, the state capital.
   Troops dispatched to the area Tuesday reported that 39 people
were slain, including five woman and a one-year-old baby, and 21
people wounded in the attacks.
   The rebels killed 20 people in Acosvinchos, 10 in Vinchuspata
and nine in San Lucas, according to the military report.
   A survivor in Acosvinchos told military officials in Ayacucho
that the rebels surrounded the village and forced people to leave
their homes.
   The military said the guerrillas held a trial of people who
belonged to the village's civil defense and then killed them by
cutting their throats or bashing their heads with rocks.
   Many villages in guerrilla regions in the mountains have formed
self-defense patrols under pressure from the military.
   The groups are poorly armed with lances, slings and homemade
shotguns. The guerrillas frequently attack communities that have
formed the patrols, accusing them of betraying the rebel cause.
   Elsewhere, military authorities in Lima said army troops killed
six Shining Path guerrillas during a rebel ambush of a military
patrol in Huanuco state, 132 miles northeast of Lima.
   According to the report, about 60 rebels ambushed the patrol
near Ambo but were driven off by the soldiers.
   Peru's political violence is rapidly escalating, according to a
report issued this month by a special Senate commission.
   An average of nine people died every day of 1989, most of them
civilians, making last year the bloodiest since the Shining Path
launched its guerrilla war in May 1980, the report said.
   The report put last year's death toll from political violence at
3,198, up from 1,986 in 1988. The 10-year toll was put at 17,500.

   Syria on Tuesday said all reports about
withdrawal of Soviet military advisers from Syria are untrue.
   An informed Syrian source said Monday, on condition of
anonymity, that the withdrawal of a number of Soviet military
advisers was agreed on during a visit by Syrian Defense Minister
Mustafa Tlass to Moscow last month.
   Responding, Information Minister Mohammed Salman said:
   ``Some news agencies have circulated information concerned with
the Soviet experts in Syria. All the talk about this subject is
absolutely untrue.''
   The source said Tlass negotiated the issue with members of the
Soviet Union's supreme military council, but the source denied
press reports in Israel that withdrawal of Soviet personnel was in
the thousands.
   The source declined to comment on a report in the Kuwaiti
newspaper Al-Rai Al-Aam that the number of Soviet military advisers
had already dropped from 2,000 to just over 1,000.
   The 1989-90 Military Balance, a annual survey of global military
strengths published by the London-based International Institute for
Strategic Studies, put the number of Soviet military personnel in
Syria last year at 2,000.
   President Hafez Assad has often stated his belief that to
achieve a just peace in the Middle East, Syria must acheive
military equality with Israel so that it can negotiate from a
position of strength.
   The Soviets have supplied Syria with combat jets, tanks and a
missile capability which includes a powerful air defense network
and 18 surface-to-surface SS-21 missiles capable of reaching any
Israeli city.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, in his final State of the
State speech, said Tuesday that he hadn't anticipated the damage
his presidential campaign would have on Massachusetts and his
family.
   Dukakis said he was ``swept up by the excitement and euphoria''
of what he called the ``Massachusetts Miracle'' when he ran for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
   ``But a funny thing happened on the road to the White House. I
ran a great campaign for the nomination, and a lousy one for the
final,'' Dukakis said. ``I lost, and in the process Massachusetts
took an unfair beating. And I feel terrible about it.''
   Dukakis said he underestimated the demands of running for the
presidency and managing state affairs.
   ``It's clear to me now that I underestimated the amount of time
and energy it takes to seek the modern presidency. Trying to do two
jobs at the same time was more difficuilt and more grueling than I
expected,'' he said.
   ``And I underestimated the toll it would take on my family,
too.''
   His wife, Kitty, entered an alcoholism treatment program shortly
after his defeat.
   Dukakis, 56, announced a year ago he would not seek re-election.
His third four-year term expires at the end of 1990.
   He also said he was wrong in trying to expand government in his
fiscal year 1990 budget, instead of consolidating it and trying to
make it work better. The state Legislature still has not balanced
the state's $12 billion budget, which remains about $500 million in
the red.
   ``I wish tonight, instead of delivering a State of the State
address, I could sit down and talk with each and every one of you
and restore the bond that was broken during the campaign, a bond
that over a quarter-century of public service I treasure more than
you know,'' Dukakis said.
   ``I know that many of you are angry with me. Feel betrayed. Feel
that I put myself before you and the commonwealth,'' Dukakis said.
   ``But there comes a time _ and I believe it has arrived _ that
nobody's interest, and certainly not the public's, is served by
laying on more blame,'' Dukakis said in a speech that was
conciliatory in tone and upbeat about the state's future.
   Dukakis repeated his call for new taxes to solve the state's
nagging fiscal problems, but said he was optimistic about the
long-term future of both Massachusetts and of New England, both
suffering economic declines.
   ``I think we have a great future ahead of us if we stop singing
the blues and go to work together to make things happen in the
1990s,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis also made a one-paragraph reference to the nationally
publicized case of Charles Stuart, who allegedly plotted the
slaying of his pregnant wife and tried to pin the crime on a black
man before committing suicide.
   Dukakis said one of the goals for the coming years would be to
help ``heal the wounds that have been reopened by the violence and
deception of one man _ wounds that have caused us to look deeply
once again into our feelings about each other and our community.''

<HEAD>McCartney Says the Three Surviving Beatles May Play Together</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Paul McCartney says he and the two other surviving
Beatles, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, may get together again to
play some music.
   Last year in a phone-in radio program with the British
Broadcasting Corp., McCartney said the Beatles would never be
revived because it would be too difficult to replace John Lennon,
the fourth Beatle, who was slain by a gunman in New York on Dec. 8,
1980.
   But in a recorded BBC television interview, details of which
were released early Wednesday, McCartney said: ``There is a chance
that we might get back together and just ease our way in with
little projects.
   ``Maybe the three of us will play a bit of music together just
for fun. That would be nice.
   ``It wouldn't be a Beatles' reunion but it would be the three of
us getting together again, which would be nice.''
   He made no mention of any replacement for Lennon playing with
them.
   The Beatles split in 1970 amid bitter wrangles about money.
   The interview with McCartney is to be broadcast in the
``Newsroom South East'' program Wednesday night, the BBC said.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association reported
rumors in the pop music world that McCartney, Harrison and Starr
could perform together at next month's musical Grammy Awards
ceremony in Los Angeles.
   McCartney, 47, has been nominated for a Grammy award for
lifetime achievement. Harrison, 46, has been nominated for a Grammy
album-of-the-year award with his group The Traveling Wilburys.
Starr, 49, has been nominated for a Grammy best country single
award.
   McCartney is currently on the British leg of a world concert
tour undertaken with the environmental group Friends of the Earth.
The world tour began last September, took in a visit to the United
States at the end of last year, and ends this summer.
   McCartney's new five-piece band, formed specially for his world
tour, includes his wife Linda on keyboards.

<TEXT>
   Twenty-six tourists, including two
Americans, continued their hunger strike for a second day Tuesday
to protest a decision by hotel management not to reimburse them for
theft of cash and jewelry from the hotel's safe.
   ``It's the only way we can pressure the hotel to live up to its
responsibility,'' said Rachel Buonavolonta of Cranford, N.J.
   The group, which also includes Irish, Spanish, Danish, Italian
and Austrian tourists, began the protest Monday after the
management of the two-star Toledo Hotel in Rio's famous Copacabana
beach district refused to negotiate, Ms. Buonavolonta said.
   She said her losses totaled $1,400 in cash and $300 worth of
jewelry. Worst hit was a Spanish couple who had $10,000 stolen.
   ``It was the hotel's arrogance that put me on the war path. When
I complained, the manager told me, `If the money hadn't been in the
safe, they (the thieves) might have come room-to-room,' '' she said.
   Ms. Buonavolonta, 44, who works for a medical equipment company,
arrived in Rio last Wednesday and was cleaned out 16 hours later.
She said the hotel offered free lodging to the victims until
Thursday and provided a nightly sandwich over the weekend.
   Hotel personnel said the manager was not available for comment
and no one else was authorized to discuss the matter.
   ``We're on strike until there's a solution,'' said 29-year-old
Javier Andres of Rosario, Argentina, who lost $300.
   Ms. Buonavolonta admitted she had cheated on her hunger pledge
Tuesday.
   ``I had a snack after I began to feel nauseated,'' she said. But
she said other strikers were holding strong and the group was
determined to keep up the pressure on the hotel.
   Even so, Ms. Buonavolonta said she was not optimistic that the
hotel would pay up. ``I'm leaving in a few days and I don't expect
to get my money back,'' she said.

   A senior Iranian Foreign Ministry
official expressed concern Tuesday in a meeting with the Soviet
ambassador about continuing ethnic clashes in the Soviet Union,
Iran's offical Islamic Republic News Agency said.
   ``We believe that a peaceful solution of the disputes and regard
for the people's demands will avert any violent clashes,'' Mahmoud
Vaezi, deputy foreign minister, was quoted as telling Ambassador
Vladimir Gudev.
   Vaezi told Gudev that Iran was willing to do anything it could
to help solve the problem, IRNA said.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, reported 30 Soviet Moslems swam
across the Aras River into Iran Tuesday, defying a state of
emergency enforced by Moscow after dozens of people were killed in
Azerbaijan in three days of ethnic clashes.
   The agency reported a similar crossing of 30 Soviet Moslems on
Sunday.
   Gudev told Vaezi a Soviet deputy foreign minister will visit
Tehran soon to make final agreements on facilities for cross-border
travel between the two countries, IRNA reported.
   It did not specify a date.
   Tehran radio, also monitored in Nicosia, said 5,000 Soviet
Moslems lined the Aras in below-freezing temperatures Monday,
calling for free travel and closer links with their kin on the
other side of the river.
   Shiites in the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan share a common
culture, language and religion with their brethren across the
Iranian border. They have staged protests since demonstrators
rampaged for days this month, tearing down frontier posts,
watchtowers and communication lines to press their call for
reunification of the Soviet and Iranian Azerbaijans.
   Azerbaijan, once wholly under Iranian control, was ceded to
Russia in 1828.

   Two letter bombs addressed to army officers in
southwestern England were discovered Tuesday before they could
explode, and Scotland Yard indicated the IRA was suspected of
involvement.
   ``The public must be vigilant when opening mail,'' said
Commander George Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's
anti-terrorist branch. ``If at all suspicious they must be urged to
contact police immediately and leave the parcel alone.''
   ``Military personnel and those involved in public life who are
connected with Northern Ireland affairs are particularly
vulnerable,'' he added.
   The Irish Republican Army is fighting British rule in Northern
Ireland and wants to unite the predominantly Protestant province
with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under a socialist
government.
   Both explosive devices, sent in brown padded envelopes, were
discovered at the army's district headquarters in Aldershot, 40
miles southwest of London, and they were destroyed in controlled
explosions.
   The army headquarters was evacuated, police said. Two other
suspicious pieces of mail were checked and found to be harmless.
   No group claimed responsibility for the devices, and police said
postmarks on the envelopes were smudged.
   The IRA's last letter bomb campaign in Britain was three years
ago when senior civil servants were the targets. Six devices were
intercepted.

   Despite claims of progress, Egyptian Foreign
Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid said Tuesday that a date still cannot
be set for the first stage of negotiations on the future of the
Israeli-held West Bank and Gaza.
   ``We are still discussing it,'' Abdel-Meguid said after an
hour-long meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   The main stumbling block to such negotiations is a dispute over
whether the Palestine Liberation Organization will have any role in
the discussions, intended to lead to elections to chose Palestinian
leaders.
   As the first step, Baker hopes to hold a three-way session here
with Meguid and Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens.
   ``There is no doubt that Egypt is very much in favor of keeping
on with the peace process,'' Abdel-Meguid said. ``And we see that
already a lot has been achieved during what I call the first
phase.''
   Egypt and Israel last month agreed in principle to meet in
Washington, but both governments expressed reservations. Israel
wants to shut out the PLO while Egypt is trying to secure its
influence in the proceedings.
   ``I had a very interesting and useful discussion with Secretary
Baker and we are going to see each other again, and then maybe at
the end of the visit, probably on Friday, I'll have something more
to say,'' the foreign minister said.
   Abdel-Meguid met with Baker without any public announcement. The
foreign minister was accompanied by Osama al-Baz, a foreign policy
adviser to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   The Egyptian delegation is in Washington to discuss with
officials of the International Monetary Fund that nation's massive
foreign debt, which the World Bank put at $49.97 billion at the end
of 1988. Egypt has been negotiating for more than a year on a loan
from the fund.
   Baker plans to meet Thursday with Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin.
   Asked if that session might develop into a three-way meeting,
Abdel-Meguid replied: ``I don't have that plan.''
   The state-run Israel Television said Tuesday that Shimon Peres,
vice-premier and finance minister, would meet Mubarak in Cairo next
week. Peres has been threatening to break up Israel's governing
political coalition if the stalemate in peace-seeking continues.
   Baker has conducted most of his diplomacy with Cairo and
Jerusalem by telephone. The dealings have left him frustrated and
he has warned the parties that problems in other parts of the world
were demanding his attention.
   Egypt, the only Arab nation to sign a peace treaty with Israel,
is serving as a channel to the PLO.

   Solvenia's party leadership demanded
Tuesday that Yugoslavia's ruling League of Communists transform
itself into a loose coalition of regional communist parties.
   The proposal will be discussed at a national party congress
scheduled for Saturday, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
   If adopted, the proposal would radically alter the traditonal
centralized federal party structure. It would significantly reduce
the power of the national communist party, known as the League of
Communists, and would grant virtual independence to regional party
organizations.
   It is certain to encounter fierce resistance from hard-liners in
the Communist leadership of Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six
constituent republics, who still favor strong central control in
party and state affairs.
   The liberal Slovenian leadership also reportedly demanded urgent
changes in electoral laws to fully legalize opposition political
parties. The first democratic, multiparty elections in the
45-year-old history of this Communist country are tentatively
planned in Slovenia for April.
   The proposals came from the Slovenian Communist Party's
policy-setting Central Committee.
   Yugoslavia has not formally adopted a law allowing independent
political parties to form, but numerous opposition political groups
have sprung up throughout the country in the past few months.
   Yugoslavia's communists were the first to break with monolithic
Soviet-led communist bloc in 1948. But Yugoslavia, faced with its
worst economic and political crises, has been slower in adopting
the Western-style reforms that have gripped other East European
countries.
   Yugoslav media said an expected clash between conservatives and
reformers at the congress could be crucial in determining the
country's future.
   Some media reports said that if the hard-liners prevail, several
liberal-minded Yugoslav republics might opt for secession from the
federation.
   ``Slovenia is only for a democratic Yugoslavia based on the
achievements of a developed world,'' said Peter Bekes, a member of
Slovenia's leadership, according to Tanjug.
   Slovenian proposals include release of all political prisoners
in Yugoslavia; an immediate end to all political trials, and
changes in the Yugoslav legal system which would guarantee full
respect of human rights.
   They also call for immediate talks between communists and
leaders of the newly formed opposition parties.

   Unidentified gunmen Wednesday killed
a Philippine constabulary lieutenant colonel and his daughter while
the officer drove the 21-year-old to school, the military and
witnesses said.
   Lt. Col. Nelson Barrion and his daughter, Angelica Jessica, died
from multiple gunshot wounds during an early morning ambush in
suburban Mandaluyong, a military report said.
   Barrion's wife, Angelita, told reporters her husband had just
driven from their house en route to the nearby University of Santo
Tomas to drop off his daughter, who was a nursing student, when she
heard gunshots.
   ``I had just closed our gate when minutes later, I heard
successive gunfire,'' Mrs. Barrion said. ``The first thought that
crossed my mind was my husband could have been ambushed but I
dismissed the thought and went about doing my work even if I was
nervous.''
   ``Minutes later, a neighbor knocked at our door to tell me that
my husband was ambushed,'' she said.
   A witness, Rey Dizon, said Barrion's car was raked with gunfire
and at least one of the assailants went near the officer's car to
shoot him at point-blank range.
   Dizon said he was not sure how many gunmen there were or what
firearms they were carrying because he was hiding most of the time.
He said the suspects fled in a car.
   Barrion was the constabulary's narcotics command inspector
general but had been on assignment with the armed forces
headquarters group since last year.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Tuesday that
``Operation Moses'' continues and ``I am convinced that in a short
while all the Ethiopian Jews will come here, and all the families
will be united,'' Israel Television reported.
   A similar report was carried on Israel army radio.
   Shamir's office had no immediate comment on the report.
   In November 1989, Ethiopia renewed diplomatic ties with Israel,
severed over the 1973 Middle East war. Senior Ethiopian officials
promised to let the country's 16,000 Jews emigrate freely.
   About 16,500 Ethiopian Jews now are in Israel. An estimated
8,000 of them were brought to Israel in a dramatic, U.S.-assisted
Operation Moses airlift in November 1984-January 1985 to join
earlier emigrants.
   The operation was halted after news of it leaked out, to the
embarrassment of Addis Ababa's Marxist government.
   At least 16,000 Jews remain in Ethiopia, which has suffered from
drought and civil war.
   Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot said this month Ethiopian
authorities were halting the exodus, demanding Israeli military aid
in return.
   State TV Tuesday said, without elaborating, ``The prime minister
confirmed that `Operation Moses,' aimed at bringing Ethiopian Jews
to Israel, is continuing these days.''

   Albanian Foreign Undersecretary Sokrat
Plaka will visit Greece this month in an apparent effort to smooth
strained relations between the two Balkan neighbors, it was
officially announced Tuesday.
   His visit beginning Jan. 26 comes after charges by the Greek
government and Orthodox Church of Greece that the 400,000-member
Greek minority in the hard-line Communist state is deprived of
human rights.
   In Albania, ethnic Greeks are not allowed to practice their
religion or speak Greek in public.
   Plaka will be the first senior Albanian official to travel to
Greece since Foreign Minister Reiz Malile paid a goodwill visit in
April 1988.
   Greek Foreign Minister Antonis Samaras told reporters he will
hold talks with Plaka, ``who requested the visit to Athens.''
   Samaras did not disclose what their talks will focus on, but it
was certain the problems faced by ethnic Greeks in Albania will top
the agenda.
   The Greek church in December accused the Albanian authorities of
killing four brothers of Greek origin after they were caught trying
to flee the country. Albanian officials denied the charge, saying
the brothers are alive and well in their village.
   Plaka's visit also comes amid reports of unrest and that special
security measures had been imposed in tiny isolated Albania,
Europe's last bastion of Stalinism.
   But Communist leader Ramiz Alia said persistent foreign reports
that anti-government demonstrations were sweeping through the
country was an attempt to slander Albania. In a speech to workers
on Tuesday, he reiterated that Albania will not deviate from its
communist course.

<TEXT>
   A judge's money-saving move to delay jury
trials in civil cases has been challenged by two attorneys who said
their client may die while awaiting his day in court.
   Judge James O'Keefe said Tuesday his decision to postpone such
trials came as the North Dakota district court system tried to trim
$1.5 million from its budget after voters rejected tax increases in
a special election last month.
   ``We're trying to slow down the civil trials,'' O'Keefe said.
``We just won't have the money to pay for them.''
   The move by O'Keefe, who is responsible for an 11-county
judicial district, drew a challenge to the North Dakota Supreme
Court from attorneys for an 80-year-old man with cancer.
   The man, Bernhard Odden, filed a civil lawsuit in 1988 over a
two-vehicle automobile accident that severely injured him and
killed his wife in November 1986, court documents said.
   The lawsuit names as defendants the driver of the other auto,
David Paulseth, and Deutz-Allis Corp., which owned the car Paulseth
was driving. Odden, from McHenry County about 100 miles north of
Bismarck, was willing to accept a trial without a jury, but the
defendants' attorney, Donald Peterson, has declined to waive his
client's right to a jury trial.
   The trial was scheduled for Jan. 29, but Odden's lawyers,
Michael Geiermann and Casey Chapman, were notified recently it was
being delayed at least 18 months under O'Keefe's policy.
   Geiermann and Chapman want the state Supreme Court to order a
trial for Odden, contending their client, who has prostate cancer,
may die before his lawsuit is heard.
   The judge in the lawsuit case, William Neumann, said the cost of
a jury trial could force the firing of the district's only juvenile
probation officer.
   ``The district's budget has required that the court choose
betweenserving Mr. Odden or serving one-third of the children and
youth in the Northeast District,'' Neumann said. ``The court has
chosen the young people.''
   Peterson described the delay as a temporary inconvenience.
   ``Nothing in the record indicates that he (Odden) is on his
death bed,'' Peterson said. ``In no way is he being denied a jury
trial, nor can it be said that he will suffer irreparable harm.''
   State government overall has been struggling to cut $94 million
from its two-year budget since voters rejected increases in state
income, sales and motor fuels taxes in the special election Dec. 5,
   Criminal defendants have a constitutional right to a speedy
trial and are not affected by O'Keefe's policy.

   The Missouri Supreme Court on Tuesday
scheduled a Thursday morning execution for convicted killer Gerald
Smith, who says he wants to be put to death.
   The state court acted hours after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted
a stay of execution Tuesday morning for Smith, 31, after rejecting
motions by his court-appointed lawyer.
   The attorney, C. John Pleban of St. Louis, said he might ask the
nation's highest court to reconsider its 6-3 decision and will
review the court's decision to ``see if anything was overlooked.''
   However, Pleban said, ``We are close to being at the end of the
road here with the appeals process. I have pretty much raised all
the issues I can.''
   In a telephone conversation later Tuesday, Smith told his
attorney he didn't want him to try to stop the execution, Pleban
said.
   The new execution date _ 12:01 a.m. Thursday _ is one week after
the previous date set by the state court to administer a lethal
injection to Smith for the 1980 murder of former girlfriend Karen
Roberts. Smith is also under a death sentence for murdering a
fellow death-row prisoner in 1985.
   Last week's execution date was stayed by Associate Justice Harry
Blackmun until the full U.S. Supreme Court could consider Pleban's
motions.
   Told of the stay being lifted Tuesday, Smith reacted ``very
calmly and requested a couple of Snickers candy bars and a Pepsi,''
said prison spokesman Dale Riley. Smith has been in an isolation
cell at the maximum-security Potosi Correctional Center since last
week.
   ``He showed no emotion one way or the other,'' said Pleban, who
called Smith. He ``didn't say anything, really. He only inquired as
to what else I am going to do.''
   Smith has had several stays of execution, as he changed his mind
about whether he wanted to die. Pleban contends Smith is mentally
incompetent to waive appeals. Smith said in a Jan. 6 interview that
he still wanted to be executed.
   The attorney general will fight any request to further delay
Smith's execution, said spokeswoman Mary Jenkins. ``Nine years of
litigation following the trial is sufficient,'' she said.
   Bob Ferguson, spokesman for Gov. John Ashcroft, said his boss
would not stop an execution.
   Smith would be the 121st person executed since the U.S. Supreme
Court allowed states to restore the death penalty in 1976.
   Missouri resumed executions a year ago when George ``Tiny''
Mercer was received a lethal injection for murder. There are 70 men
and two women under death sentence in the state.

   A dispute between union and non-union miners
near a coal mine erupted in gunfire Tuesday, and a union picket was
killed and two other people were wounded, authorities said.
   The shootout occurred on a highway about two miles from the
Bailey Energy mine, McDowell County Sheriff's Deputy Vern Walker
said.
   State police said shots were exchanged between gunmen stationed
on a hillside above the highway and protesting miners on the road.
   John McCoy, 42, of Premier in McDowell County, was dead on
arrival at Welch Emergency Hospital with gunshot wounds to the
chest and neck, according to a statement from the hospital's
administration office.
   McCoy was a United Mine Workers member, and the union on Tuesday
afternoon issued a statement condemning the attack.
   ``As mine workers, they face many dangers, whether the hazards
inherent in coal mining, the hardship caused by coal company
economics or the threats of bodily harm at the hands of gun
thugs,'' said UMW President Richard Trumka.
   Jim McNeely, general counsel for United Mine Workers District
29, said he knew little about the shooting, but said the
mountainous region of southern West Virginia is known for its
complexity.
   ``There are so many conflicts between so many people in that
area,'' he said. ``There are creditors' disputes. There are
personal disputes. There are a multitude of disputes. It's not just
there is a union-non-union dispute down there.
   ``I've worked with a lot of folks down there who work for the
union who have been been stiffed by coal companies. There is a long
history of coal companies leaving without paying wages.''
   One of the wounded, Darrell Morgan, 41, of Northfork underwent
surgery for gunshot wounds to the abdomen and hand, and was in
stable condition at Bluefield Regional Medical Center, a nursing
supervisor said. Steve Morgan, 33, of Brenton was in stable
condition with wounds to the thigh and arm. The Morgans are not
related.

   A Foreign Ministry official said Tuesday the first
official visit to the Soviet Union by a delegation from Japan's
governing party showed a greater willingness by the Kremlin to
resolve a territorial dispute with Japan.
   But ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe discounted published
reports that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``reversed'' his
position on a group of islands claimed by both Moscow and Tokyo.
   ``I don't think any legalistic talks on who has the right (to
the territories) took place,'' he said.
   Shintaro Abe, a former foreign minister and ex-secretary general
of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, met Gorbachev in Moscow
on Monday. His delegation was the first from the party to visit the
Soviet Union at the invitation of the Soviet Communist Party.
   In the final days of World War II, Soviet troops occupied
several tiny islands off northeastern Japan, the so-called Northern
Territories which lie across the Soviet navy's route to the Pacific
Ocean from Vladivostok. The Soviets now station troops and jet
fighters there.
   For 45 years, the islands have been the major barrier to
improving relations and the reason the two countries never signed a
peace treaty.
   The Asahi Shimbun newspaper said Tuesday that Gorbachev,
``reversing his country's position on the territorial dispute with
Japan, ... said Monday that Japan has an inherent right to claim
the islands.''
   Watanabe called that ``a bold interpretation'' not backed up by
Gorbachev's statements.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Mayumi Moriyama told a news conference
Tuesday ``there has been a gradual, subtle change from the stage
when the Soviet Union refused to recognize the problem.''
   Soviet interest in the islands is largely strategic. Japanese
considerations include many Japanese graves there and the abundance
in nearby waters of fish, seaweed and crab _ staples of the
Japanese diet.
   Neither side presented concrete proposals. But maverick Boris
Yeltsin, now visiting Japan, offered some ideas at a news
conference Tuesday.
   He suggested the islands be declared a free enterprise zone in
three to four years, giving Japan most favored nation status, and
then demilitarized in seven to eight years.
   In 15 to 20 years, the islands could be declared an area of
joint management, or free territories not under any country's
jurisdiction, he said.

   Opposition candidate Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro returned to Nicaragua Tuesday, vowing to stay in the
presidential race to the finish.
   ``Neither UNO (the National Opposition Union) nor Violeta
Chamorro are going to quit,'' she said. ``My spirit is more
determined than ever to go forward to build a new republic.''
   Chamorro returned from Houston, where she underwent surgery on a
shattered kneecap, to confront rumors she was no longer able to
campaign and accusations from her main rival, President Daniel
Ortega, that the opposition coalition planned to pull out of the
race in order to discredit the Feb. 25 elections.
   ``How could I quit?'' she asked. ``Quitters are cowards.''
   Ortega accused UNO of trying to create a situation ``like
Panama'' that would invite U.S. military intervention.
   The UNO campaign, plagued by personal rivalries and money
problems, sputtered in Chamorro's absence. More than 100 candidates
for local office and the national assembly have resigned since
early December.
   Chamorro, the publisher of La Prensa, Nicaragua's only
opposition newspaper, arrived on a private jet loaned by Venezuelan
President Carlos Andres Perez.
   She was helped off the plane by her son, journalist Pedro
Joaquin Chamorro Barrios, and her son-in-law Antonio Lacayo. Her
right leg was in a cast and she was using a cane.
   ``I feel better than ever,'' she declared. ``I am here to
continue the campaign. We have only a few days left before
victory.''
   She said President Bush had called her at the hospital several
times to check on her health.

   An international bank pleaded guilty Tuesday
to cocaine-related money-laundering charges, agreed to forfeit a
record $14 million and to help prosecutors who say the case has
ties to Manuel Noriega.
   U.S. District Judge W. Terrell Hodges accepted pleas from two
divisions of the Luxembourg-based Bank of Credit and Commerce
International and found them guilty, but has not set a date for
formally imposing the sentence.
   The plea did not affect co-defendants in the $32 million
money-laundering case, including top BCCI banking officers and two
Colombians the government claims were part of the Medellin cocaine
cartel.
   Later in the day, however, one of the six banking officials was
dropped from the case when conspiracy charges were dismissed. The
other cases continued with pretrial motions in a proceeding
expected to last five months.
   Under the agreement signed Tuesday, BCCI, S.A. and BCCI Overseas
Ltd. are to forfeit $14 million in assets frozen earlier by the
government. Prosecutors claim that represents profits made from the
sale of cocaine in American cities and laundered in a series of
complicated worldwide banking transactions.
   The banks also are to receive suspended fines and five years
probation supervised by the Federal Reserve.
   The cash forfeiture was the largest ever by a financial
institution in the United States, said Dave Runkel, spokesman for
the U.S. Justice Department in Washington.
   ``I think it's a good deal,'' said Bonnie Tischler, head of the
U.S. Customs Service in Tampa.
   But one expert on money laundering said he was surprised and
disappointed by the sentences against the bank, which he
characterized as lenient.
   ``It's pretty outrageous. It's just a slap on the wrist,'' said
Scott Malone, Washington bureau chief of the newsletter Money
Laundering Alert. ``All they have to do is return the proceeds of
their crime and pay no penalty. It sends the wrong signal to
bankers all over the world.''
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said the penalty was legally, morally
and politically wrong.
   ``My impression is when banks engage knowingly in the laundering
of money, they should be shut down. It's that simple, it really
is,'' said Kerry, who chairs the Senate subcommittee on terrorism
and narcotics.
   ``We send drug people to jail for the rest of their life, and
these guys who are bankers in the corporate world seem to just walk
away, and it's business as usual,'' Kerry told CBS News in an
interview Tuesday.
   A two-year sting operation called Operation C-Chase began in
Tampa in 1986 after an undercover agent conned his way into an
international money laundering network. After that, agents helped
direct profits from cocaine sales in American cities to Colombia
through Panama eventually building a global laundering operation
worth an estimated $32 million, investigators said.
   Some 30 charges against the two bank entities included tax
fraud, laundering activities and failing to report currency
transactions over $10,000.
   In return for the plea, the government agreed to waive any
future charges against the bank that its investigation might
uncover.
   Hodges approved a gag order to prevent parties in the case from
talking to the media, and bank officials and attorneys refused to
comment after the agreement was announced.
   ``I'm going to let the documents speak for themselves,'' U.S.
Attorney Robert Genzman said after leaving the courtroom.
   In December 1987, some officials at BCCI in Panama, which was
the bank used to pass funds to Colombia, contacted undercover
agents and arranged a meeting to suggest alternate banking methods
such as Certificates of Deposit rather than checks to avoid being
caught, prosecutors said.
   Agents said they told high level bank officials the money was
from cocaine sales.
   The agents said BCCI bankers taught them how to use cash to buy
CDs, then use the CDs as collateral for loans. The loan proceeds
then would be wired into accounts controlled by an agent or
smugglers, prosecutors said.
   Customs agents claimed the money was intended mainly for
Colombian drug traffickers, including the Medellin cartel.
   Altogether, more than 80 people were accused of taking part in
drug-related money-laundering schemes in Detroit, Philadelphia,
Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Miami, New York and Tampa and in
London and Paris.
   The Luxembourg bank is one of the largest privately held
institutions in the world with operations in 73 countries.
   Facing trial is Amjad Awan, assistant division director of BCCI
for Latin America in Miami, who claimed he used to be deposed
Panamanian dictator Noriega's banker and managed a secret account
that held up to $25 million.
   Also charged are Gonzalo Mora Jr., who federal prosecutors claim
was the main drug money-launderer in Medellin, Colombia, and
Rudolph Armbrect, Mora's partner.
   Late Tuesday, prosecutors agreed to drop charges of conspiracy
against Iqbal Ashraf, 39, a manager of BCCI's Los Angeles office,
after his attorneys moved successfully to suppress statements he
gave without counsel present.
   ``When we lost that, we just didn't have enough evidence left,''
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Rubenstein.
   ``I'm relieved,'' a tearful Ashraf said as he left court. ``I'm
just glad to get this behind me.''
   The defense asked the court to prohibit prosecutors from
bringing Noriega into the case, a move the defense expects because
Stephen Michael Kalish is among the drug kingpins on the government
witness list.
   Kalish, arrested in 1984 and serving 15 years, has testified
that he secured safe Panama banking for his marijuana smuggling
ring in 1983 by giving Noriega $300,000. According to the
government, Kalish also met with Awan and deposited an initial $2
million into a BCCI account in Panama City.
   During U.S. Senate testimony before his arrest, Awan said such a
deposit was possible but he had no recollection of it.
   Awan told Senate investigators he managed a secret account
Noriega opened at the bank's Panamanian branch in 1982. Awan said
Noriega was the only one who could authorize withdrawals from the
account, and he denied knowledge of any drug dealing by Noriega or
the bank.

<HEAD>Juror's Illness Halts Deliberations in Pre-School Molestation Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A juror fell ill Tuesday while deliberating
the last 13 counts in the marathon McMartin Pre-School molestation
trial, and the panel's talks bogged down on questions about a
conspiracy charge.
   It was uncertain whether the juror would be well enough to
return Wednesday to deliberations in the nation's longest,
costliest criminal trial.
   The jury, in its ninth week of deliberations in the 2{-year-old
trial, attempted Tuesday to resolve the question they had raised
with the court as to whether they could split their verdict on one
count against both defendants.
   The jurors _ who have been considering a total of 65 molestation
charges against Raymond Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin
Buckey, 63 _ were puzzled about whether they could convict one
defendant of a conspiracy charge while acquitting the other.
   Earlier in the day, Superior Court Judge William Pounders sent
attorneys to consult their law books while jurors deliberated on
other counts in the case.
   They have agreed on 52 verdicts, which have been sealed by
Pounders. None of the verdicts is official until it is announced in
court and affirmed by each juror.
   No alternates remain in the case, and the judge has expressed
concern that losing one of the 12 remaining jurors would force a
mistrial.
   Pounders, responding to a written question submitted Friday,
told jurors Tuesday they could indeed split their verdict.
   The jurors then wanted to know how that could be since the
conspiracy law calls for conviction if ``an agreement is entered
into by two or more persons with a specific intent to commit a
public offense ...''
   The jurors asked whom one defendant would if conspired with, if
not the other defendant.
   Pounders suggested telling them that one defendant could have
conspired with ``a person or persons whose names are not known,''
but defense attorneys objected strenuously.
   Dean Gits, who represents Mrs. Buckey, said the jurors should be
instructed that they must agree on the identity of a co-conspirator
even if the person is unidentified in the charges.
   Danny Davis, who represents Buckey, said jurors should not be
allowed to convict a defendant on the basis of conspiracy with ``a
ghost conspirator.''
   ``Now we're saying, `Go for a ghost. Don't deliberate the
identity of a conspirator,''' said Davis. ``This is not OK for
Raymond Buckey.''
   Davis moved for dismissal of the conspiracy charge because of
insufficient evidence, but the judge denied the motion. Jurors need
not identify the unidentified co-conspirator to agree on a verdict,
the judge said.

   The five astronauts aboard Columbia
worked quietly in space Tuesday, only occasionally talking to
ground controllers as they tended to several scientific and medical
experiments aboard the shuttle.
   Radio traffic between ground and the space shuttle was kept to a
minimum ``to allow the crew to stay on the timeline and get all
their various chores accomplished without a lot of interference
from the folks here,'' Mission Control said.
   Their workday began late Monday night and ended Tuesday shortly
after noon, as the astronauts gradually adjust their workdays
forward in preparation for Friday's 2:55 a.m. PST landing at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   On Monday, the astronauts were so busy with their experiments
that they went to bed more than two hours late. So Mission Control
let them sleep an extra half hour but told them in a morning
package of messages and instructions said: ``Your request for
overtime has been disapproved.''
   Clouds prevented filming parts of Earth with the powerful IMAX
camera, but the astronauts otherwise kept to their schedule Tuesday.
   ``We'll get to bed on time for a change,'' commander Dan
Brandenstein told Mission Control.
   The astronauts were awakened at 9:35 p.m. EST Tuesday with an
instrumental rendition of the Irish ballad ``Danny Boy,'' in honor
of Bradenstein, whose 47th birthday is Wednesday.
   The music was followed by a salute from the Boston Celtics'
basketball star Larry Bird. He said, ``Congratulations to you and
the crew on the slam dunk with LDEF. Happy Birthday and have a safe
landing.''
   The astronaut corps, which Brandenstein heads, then sang ``Happy
Birthday'' to the ``Boss.''
   ``I was hoping that flying Mach 25 you didn't age and that this
wasn't going to happen this year,'' said Brandenstein. The shuttle
is traveling at Mach 25, or 25 times the speed of sound.
   When Mission Control asked him how old he is, Brandenstein
replied, ``Didn't you know this is a classified mission?''
   Meanwhile, flight controllers reported that the shuttle
continued to perform well.
   Columbia launched into orbit a week ago, carrying a Navy
communications satellite that was released by the crew last
Wednesday. On Friday, the astronauts executed a dramatic rescue of
the LDEF, an 11-ton floating scientific satellite that is now
nestled in the cargo bay for return to Earth.
   The 10-day mission is the second longest in 33 shuttle missions
and is intended as a stepping stone toward longer missions and
months-long stays aboard the planned space station Freedom. Medical
tests performed during the mission should help scientists learn
more about how astronauts adapt to space.
   One experiment that melts and resolidifies a metal was
interrupted Tuesday when a computer showed it had overheated.
   Although mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar said the experiment
was not hot to touch, ground controllers decided to let it have
some time to cool as a precaution. The metal sample will be
replaced and the experiment will be turned on again Wednesday.
   Earlier in the mission, the experiment was shut down temporarily
when a crack developed in a sealed glass container of the metal.
That sample also was replaced.

   Business leaders say their young
democracy will be threatened unless Panama receives financial aid
to compensate for the looting, unemployment and destruction caused
by the U.S. invasion.
   ``If the United States truly expects democracy to flourish, you
need a flourishing economy,'' said Laurence Berger, vice president
of the American Chamber of Commerce in Panama. ``All the goodwill
in the world won't mean much when you have growling stomachs.''
   Business leaders say the Bush administration has not yet offered
any aid to make up for the millions lost due to U.S. economic
sanctions imposed to try to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and
the widespread looting after the invasion.
   ``We've been told, `We gave you your freedom and now it's up to
you to do what you will,''' said Alfredo L. Maduro, president of

   Debate over Social Security is heating up even
before Congress gets back to business, with the trillions of
dollars in baby boomers' future retirement benefits casting a huge
shadow over the political argument.
   Customary political rhetoric has been turned upside down, with a
leading Democrat calling for a payroll tax cut and the White House
responding, ``No way.''
   The outcome may determine whether the massive Social Security
trust fund, bolstered by long-range payroll tax increases enacted
in 1983, will continue to be used to mask the size of the federal
budget deficit. In an era of perennial budget shortfalls, the
Social Security trust fund helps pay the government's day-to-day
operations instead of building up a nest egg.
   Lawmakers are faced with whether to take painful action now _
such as tax increases and spending slashes _ or do nothing until
the next century.

   The U.S. government gives three-quarters of
the contraceptives donated to Third World countries, including
nearly 7 billion condoms over the last two decades, according to
the Agency for International Development.
   Since 1968, the agency ``has purchased $567.7 million worth of
contraceptives for distribution to 75 countries _ 6.9 billion
condoms, 1.6 billion cycles of oral contraceptives, 49.7 million
intrauterine devices and 16.5 million vaginal foaming tablets,''
the agency reported.
   Duff Gillespie, the agency's director for population, said
overseas orders for condoms rose from 535 million in the 1988
fiscal year to 735 million in the year ending on Sept. 30. He said
the increase was due in part to the fight against AIDS, but also to
the growth of the agency's population activities.
   Details of the population program appeared in the fall 1989
edition of ``USAID Highlights,'' an agency publication distributed
to reporters last week.

   Tourists who ignore warnings not to feed
the wildlife are doing so at increasing risk at Yellowstone
National Park, where some animals have begun to bite the hand that
feeds them.
   While rangers do not have specific figures showing an increase
in animal attacks, they have noticed that in recent years more and
more coyotes, bighorn sheep and other animals have learned to
associate man with food because of the handouts tourists offer.
   ``I was riding a snow machine two winters ago, I guess, toward
Old Faithful and there was a coyote in the road and we stopped and
the guy with me wanted a photograph of it,'' recalled Ranger Norm
Bishop. ``He pulled his camera out and I started to pull mine out.
The instant I touched that bag the coyote was almost in my lap.
   ``He instantly associated the sound of that plastic bag with
potato chips, Fritos, hamburger, whatever, he was ready for it,''
said Bishop. ``It was really unsettling to me. I didn't like an
animal that close to me eager to have what I had.''

<HEAD>NBC's New `Grand' To Premiere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's midseason replacement show time, folks.
Stop grumbling. Anything is better than televised basketball.
Besides, there's at least one new sitcom coming up that resembles a
good one.
   It's NBC's ``Grand.'' By the makers of ``The Cosby Show,'' it's
light years away from that show's severe case of nice. The newcomer
premieres Thursday in the time slot opened by the shift of ``Dear
John'' to Wednesdays.
   ``Grand'' won't bowl you over. But it has a nice, realistic edge
to it. Even better, it doesn't depend on a string of one-liners
posing as a plot. It gently exaggerates _ and deftly _ both the
silly and sad for comic effect.
   It's set in mythical Grand, Pa., a small town that we are
advised, ``prospered and declined around one industry _ the Weldon
Piano Works.'' It's what you might call a triad comedy.
   It tells, in what promises to be a serial style, the stories of
three families, all of whom know each other. They're in the top,
middle and bottom rungs, respectively, of the social and economic
life in this pleasant, tree-filled, fading metropolis.
   At the top is the patriarch Weldon (John Randolph) with a dim
son (Joel Murray) who, having decided to stop thinking, goes into
TV, of course. There also is a dry-humored old British butler (John
Neville) whom nothing fazes.
   The in-betweens: Weldon's niece (Bonnie Hunt), who is hot to
have a baby, and her late thirtysomething husband (Michael McKean),
who aspires to be an executive in the Weldon Piano factory.
   At the bottom, living in a grubby trailer, is Pamela Reed as a
chain-smoking single mother abandoned three years ago by her
husband. She has an overweight teen-age daughter (Sara Rue) and a
young would-be beau, a motorcycle cop that Andrew Lauer plays with
sort of a Tommy Smothers goofiness.
   Thursday's debut, by ``Grand'' creator Michael Leeson, is your
basic meet-the-cast premiere. It tries to get plots going and
characters outlined, but at times all this falls flat, usually in
the dialogue department.
   No matter. The uncommonly good cast keeps the show afloat,
particularly Reed, a brilliant stage-trained actress. As the tough,
but vulnerable Janice Pasetti, her comedy work has the daring and
timing of a first-rate burglar.
   Yet she's equally good with the sad, quiet moments, as when she
eagerly awaits the arrival of her wayward husband, only to be told
he wants a divorce. No matter what moment is afoot, Reed's
character always rings true.
   Another big plus for ``Grand'' is its sense of place and heart.
That's well-illustrated in one scene that makes clear that
piano-maker Weldon is a rare bird, a man who still takes pride in
his product.
   His newly hired nephew-in-law notes that Japanese-made
electronic keyboards have just about killed the business of making
what are called acoustic pianos. He urges his boss to stop making
pianos and turn out golf clubs instead.
   Hundreds of thousands of people play golf, the new executive
says. ``Who do you know who plays a piano?''
   ``I do,'' roars the old man. And he fires him.
   You have to like a show that offers such hope.
   While this ``Grand'' premiere has its problems, it and two later
episodes that were made available for screening indicates that this
is a different, superior kind of sitcom. Give it a try. You'll like
it.

<HEAD>Cheryl Ladd Is Love Interest in `Jekyll &amp; Hyde'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cheryl Ladd doesn't think an actor could ask
for anything more than the conditions for filming ABC's ``Jekyll &amp;
Hyde'' on location in London and Oxford.
   She plays Sara, the woman Dr. Henry Jekyll loves and the woman
John Hyde craves. Michael Caine plays the dual role of good and
evil.
   ``It's one of those wonderful roles that as soon as you go to
work you become that character,'' said Ladd. ``You have authentic
locales, hair styles and costumes. The clothes, by the way, are
excruciatingly uncomfortable.''
   Although set in Victorian England, the movie has a theme as
contemporary as today's headlines. Jekyll was a man who believed
that drugs could alter the way men think and act, for the
betterment of mankind, and ease the pains of mind and body. The
drugs, however, create his evil alter ego, Mr. Hyde.
   The two-hour movie, which ABC telecasts on Sunday, is based
loosely on Robert Louis Stevenson's classic story ``The Strange
Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.'' The story's been portrayed many
times on the screen, including Fredric March's Oscar-winning
version in 1932. It's also inspired such spinoffs as Jerry Lewis'
``The Nutty Professor'' and television's ``The Incredible Hulk.''
Most recently, Anthony Andrews was in a one-hour drama on Showtime.
   David Wickes is the writer and director of the current version.
Caine also starred in the recent ``Jack the Ripper,'' which Wickes
produced, directed and co-wrote.
   ``There was no woman to speak of in Stevenson's story, so the
love interest was created,'' said Ladd. ``Sara's sister had been
married to Jekyll, but died five years earlier. Her father, the
most pre-eminent medical mind of the day, blames Jekyll for her
death because of his experimentation with drugs.
   ``So, I'm sort of caught between that rivalry. I try to maintain
my loyalties to my father and keep my relationship with Jekyll.
Although she's married she has a very public affair with Jekyll. My
husband is a military officer in the South Pacific and I'm packing
to join him when all hell breaks loose.''
   Ladd said Caine's transformation from Jekyll to Hyde is shown on
the screen by means of stunning special effects.
   ``You watch him change, and when he becomes Hyde you'd never
know it was Michael,'' she said.
   Ladd, probably best known for ``Charlie's Angels,'' is the only
American in the cast. She plays the role with a British accent.
   ``We were filming one day in a building being used as a
restaurant,'' she said. ``There were 50 or 60 people in the crew.
People were in and out and security wasn't very tight. All day long
between scenes Michael and I posed for press photographers and
talked to reporters.
   ``At one point a girl rushes in and says, `The photographer's
waiting.' We go down the hall and pose for pictures for about 10
minutes. Finally, we learned he was a tourist who had wandered in
off the street.''
   Ladd said it was sometimes difficult to keep a straight face
during the filming.
   ``Michael is probably one of the most innately funny people I've
ever known,'' she said. ``He doesn't tell jokes. He just has funny
ways of speaking. But I got him sometimes. Once when he was in
complete makeup as Hyde and about to rape Sara, I said, `How about
a little foreplay?' He got the giggles so bad he nearly ruined his
makeup.''
   Ladd will also be seen in the spring in the feature motion
picture ``Lisa.'' Staci Keanan of ``My Two Dads'' stars as Lisa and
Ladd's daughter in this thriller.
   She was due to begin work on an NBC movie called ``The Face of
Love.'' She plays a mother who learns her husband has a daughter
from the Vietnam War when she comes to live with them.
   She and John Ritter are also developing a remake of ``Our Man
Godfrey'' as a TV movie.
   ``We'll play against type,'' Ladd said. ``I'll be flamboyant and
John will be restrained. I get to play this wacko character that
I've never played before.''

womanizing and preoccupation with the fast buck to fulfill a
deathbed promise to his father to run the family grocery and become

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the smartest, most successful business
people make the biggest and, in retrospect, the most foolish
mistakes _ mistakes of such magnitude that simpler folks find them
incomprehensible.
   Robert Campeau, a successful Canadian developer whose ambition
for bigger things brought about the bankruptcy court filing of
Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., is the
latest on a list destined to grow larger.
   Campeau had what many people would consider ``everything.'' He
was highly successful, controlling millions of dollars with which
to indulge himself. But he bet it all on something unfamiliar _
retailing _ and in a foreign country no less.
   The explanation for his behavior, and the many similarly bright
people who seem to court disaster, might best be explained someday
by psychological rather than financial analysis. But right now it
is a major mystery.
   On the long list are bankers, the people you might think should
know better. Bankers repeatedly lend money to builders at the wrong
time in the economic cycle, that is, when overbuilding is about to
take place.
   Bankers also are the decision-makers who, at a time 15 years ago
when customers couldn't beg a home mortgage, lent billions to Third
World nations, explaining to simple folks that ``these loans are
guaranteed by governments.''
   It happens often in real estate, when successful developers
eventually come to love and believe the praise they receive at
groundbreaking ceremonies. It lures them into what they believe
will be their crowning achievement.
   So common is the success-failure syndrome in that field that it
is all but inevitable that sometime, somewhere, some major
developer will be caught bringing a commercial building to
completion just as the market is collapsing.
   In stocks and commodities, successful speculators let their egos
talk them into believing they really can see the future, a future
that often involves their biggest deal ever, one so sure they cut
friends in on it.
   In business, successful small operators get tired of slow
growth, convince themselves that bigger is better, borrow madly and
buy up everything in sight. They develop what they call a
conglomerate, each part feeding the other.
   Financial advisers to corporate raiders, dissatisfied with
earning only commissions, see the potential for profit enhancement
not simply by giving advice but by investing their own money.
   Too often the result is the same: They overstep their abilities,
somehow shielding from consciousness their own fail-safe
mechanisms, their instincts, and the years of experience that
brought them their success.
   William Zeckendorf Sr. was a flamboyant and successful
developer, famous and feted, reputed to be the man to get things
don when nobody else could. He helped put together the land package
on which the United Nations stands.
   For years he was honored. Then he overstepped and failed.
Reflecting on his collapsed career, he asked a reporter sadly,
``Did you know they named a park for me in Denver?'' The reporter
checked. ``Yes,'' he was told, ``it's about the size of a postage
stamp.''
   Speculators and investment advisers bite the dust all the time,
right after they feel on top of the world. The Hunt brothers
garnered a fortune in silver, but lost it all when they sought it
all. And Joseph Granville, the investment adviser, was so certain
he knew the future that he missed the crash of 1987.
   And there is Campeau and his backers. All knew that Campeau had
little or no experience in retailing or in the United States
market, and that the risk was so great the deal might collapse if
sales and profits weren't sustained.
   They knew also that after one of the longest U.S. economic
expansions on record a slowdown was inevitable. Or that, at the
other extreme, any reheating of the economy might force up interest
rates, making debt repayment impossible.
   Those investors included people and institutions who gobbled up
Campeau junk bonds because of the high interest rates, even when
warned again and again that repayment was uncertain.
   It included even the investment bankers who issued the warnings.

<HEAD>Another Scapegoat Shows Up for Human Conduct _ The `Genome'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With Laserphoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Ever since humans began, they've looked for something to blame
for their problems. Adam and Eve blamed the ``serpent.''
Psychiatrists blame childhood traumas. Astrologists lay it to the
planets. Anything but self.
   Now comes an emerging new culprit: the ``genome.''
   The genome is the full set of genes, or inherited bodily
regulators that determine much of a person's makeup. But just how
much is a question that casts a shadow on the essence of humanity
itself.
   The ``mystery of the gene is stimulating a new era of
philosophical and theological thinking about the nature'' of human
life, said the Rev. J. Robert Nelson, a noted theologian, ecumenist
and specialist in scientific ethics.
   The issue impinges directly on concepts of faith, God, human
origins, behavior, sin and morality, he said.
   To the extent that it is established that genes not only control
physical characteristics but also fix certain behavioral traits
would to that degree contradict ``free will and
self-determination,'' he said.
   That freedom to decide on one's own conduct and course of action
is the basis of individual responsibility and a central biblical
view of humanity's special dignity and distinction from other
creatures.
   Nelson, director of the Institute of Religion at the Texas
Medical Center in Houston, said in a telephone interview: ``If it
is conceded that genetics determines almost the total person, then
there's nothing left for morality.
   ``But I don't think it will go that far. We do have free will.
It's the old question of how much nature or nurture has to do with
a person.''
   Nevertheless, he said the power of the genome to govern human
characteristics and dispositions is turning up increasingly, and
religious institutions should come to grips with that reality.
   ``I wonder why moral theologians are not pursuing it,'' he said.
He has initiated a three-year project on ``Genetics, Religion and
Ethics'' to spur inquiry into the area.
   A first conference of molecular biologists, doctors, theologians
and public policy makers has been scheduled for March 30. It is
co-sponsored by the American Medical Association, the National
Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches, plus about
10 denominations.
   ``The whole threat of sociobiology is that we have no free will
at all, that we simply do what our genes tell us to do,'' Nelson
said.
   If they ``are the rule of life,'' he added, ``we're going to
have a lot of questions for traditional norms. How much flexibility
should there be in moral standards, if some behavior is
uncontrollable?''
   He said evidence is mounting of genetic causes not only of
physical makeup and a growing list of diseases and susceptibility
to others, but also of ``predermined patterns of personal
behavior.''
   Some of these are psychopathic, such as schizophrenia and manic
depression, he said, but people also may be ``genetically
disposed'' or even ``genetically determined'' to alcoholism or
sexual deviation.
   Kleptomania, compulsive stealing, also may be genetically
caused, and perhaps even gambling, he said, while ``compulsive
inclination toward violent and criminal activity'' is argued among
geneticists.
   All this raises the question of the extent to which good or
objectional behavior is ``due to free choice'' or ``due to our
genomes.''
   Some ``hard-line dogmatism'' in the field maintains that ``our
traditional concepts of human free will, voluntary choice, decision
making and ethical rectitude are merely illusions,'' he said.
   To reject this ``extreme ideology'' must not ``make us blind to
... the range of genetic effects on human behavior,'' he said, and
the search to understand them is ``as mandatory as it is awesome.''
   That search goes on in a longtime tension between two opposing
notions of human life, the ``materialistics,'' viewing it as only
physical matter, and the ``spiritual,'' seeing its essence as the
eternal soul or mind.
   Biblical insights see humanity as combined body and soul, a
``psychosomatic'' whole.
   While in the present environment the materialistic theory of
life seems to prevail, it is contradicted by ``emerging data of
genetic science itself,'' Nelson said, adding:
   ``Research in molecular biology and biochemistry is rapidly
discovering heretofore unknown characteristics of the DNA molecule
as the quintessential unit of life. And the new knowledge gives
support and comfort to both the materialists and the idealists.''
   He said that underlying the chemical interaction making up the
genetic unit is the source of energy itself and an emerging theory
in physics that ``energy and matter are themselves the products of
an immaterial force.''
   Thus basically, genetic science may give ``signals both to the
consistent materialists and the idealists that they are right,'' he
said. ``However, there is a plausible truth in the intuition that
human life is an inseparable admixture of material and spiritual
dimensions.''

<HEAD>Bush at a High Point as He Begins Second Year in Presidency</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   George Bush has reason to smile as he enters
the second year of his presidency. His standing in the polls is at
phenomenal heights, Manuel Antonio Noriega is in U.S. custody, and
communist governments in Eastern Europe are toppling.
   ``I'm finishing with a bit of a glow,'' Bush acknowledged at
year's end.
   But as Bush well knows, presidents before him have enjoyed the
glow of favorable circumstances only to suffer the sudden chill of
events gone sour.
   As he celebrated the anniversary of his inauguration, Bush
sought to benefit from the political capital gained in recent
months as he campaigned to win congressional support for a domestic
agenda topped by his long-standing call for a cut in capital gains
taxes.
   With Democrats firmly in control of Congress and in a mood to
challenge the president, domestic policy may prove far more
troublesome for the president than foreign policy.
   Prospects are considered excellent for conclusion of agreements
this year on long-range nuclear weapons and on reducing
conventional military forces in Europe.
   Assessments of Bush's first year in office were predictably
glowing from such partisans as White House chief of staff John
Sununu who said: ``It wasn't an easy year. George Bush just made it
seem easy.''
   But he also earned less partisan praise.
   Stuart Eizenstat, the Carter administration's domestic policy
adviser, said Bush got off to ``a very rocky start'' with
surprising difficulties in filling key positions, including a
losing battle to get John Tower confirmed as defense secretary. But
Bush wound up having a successful first year and left himself in a
strong position with Congress for 1990, Eizenstat said.
   Democrats in Congress were too distracted to make much of any
early Bush missteps, as both House Speaker Jim Wright and Majority
Leader Tony Coelho resigned last spring under ethical clouds.
   ``If they hadn't been consuming each other, the Democrats might
have treated Bush even worse,'' said Mitchell Daniels, president of
the Hudson Institute and onetime political strategist for Ronald
Reagan's White House.
   Bush, after vetoing a $1.20 increase in the $3.35 hourly minimum
wage, forced Congress instead to swallow the 90-cent increase he
favored.
   Bush, in this age of ``the extended hand,'' also found
compromises with Congress on the deficit and aid to the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua. He lost a fight for a lower capital gains tax,
despite passage in the House and majority support in the Senate,
but vowed to win that battle this year.
   Congress hewed closely to the Bush administration plan in
fashioning a multibillion-dollar bailout for the savings and loan
industry. They also stuck largely with his blueprint for the war on
drugs, although the lawmakers raised the ante by $1 billion.
   Bush's crime package got mired in the legislative obstacle
course, and he has yet to earn his stripes as the self-proclaimed
``education president,'' despite an agreement with governors to
develop performance goals for the nation's schools.
   Democrats who thought Bush would be forced to raise taxes have
been disappointed as he held fast to his ``read-my-lips'' campaign
pledge.
   Later this month Bush will send Congress a fiscal 1991 budget
certain to meet the Gramm-Rudman deficit target of $64 billion and
unlikely to contain the draconian cuts that earned many Reagan
budgets a ``dead on arrival'' stamp on Capitol Hill.
   Despite doomsayers' predictions that a recession was just around
the corner, the economic expansion has rolled into its eighth year,
with inflation in check and unemployment near a 15-year low.
   Bush had his share of slip-ups, lost battles and controversies,
from the slow-footed response to the oil spill in Alaska to the
Tower nomination to the continuing furor over his diplomatic
overtures to China after the bloody crackdown in June on student
demonstrators.
   Three times Bush vetoed legislation over abortion financing,
even as some Republicans worried that a hard-line stance against
abortion hurt GOP gubernatorial candidates in Virginia and New
Jersey.
   Bush, accused by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of
``timidity'' in the face of major changes sweeping the Soviet Union
and East bloc nations, went to the NATO summit in May with a bold
proposal for a troop pullout and convention arms reductions across
Europe. Later, he met with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at
the storm-tossed Malta summit.
   He visited Poland and Hungary in July and by year's end had
signed an aid package of $938 million over three years for the new
East Bloc democracies _ and draped a Medal of Freedom around the
neck of Solidarity's Lech Walesa.
   His administration displayed a capacity to learn from mistakes
or missed opportunities.
   If the administration was slow to fathom the gravity of the
damage from the Exxon oil spill in Alaska's Gulf of Valdez, it
moved with dispatch when Hurricane Hugo devastated Charleston,
S.C., and when an earthquake shattered the San Francisco area.
   In Panama, the United States missed an opportunity by not coming
to the aid of mutineers who sought to overthrow Noriega in early
October. But the Pentagon's Dec. 20 invasion, the largest U.S.
military operation since the Vietnam War, was a textbook operation.
   Bush provided a show of airpower to help Philippines President
Corazon Aquino put down a mutiny and sent special forces to San
Salvador when rebels took over a hotel with Americans trapped
inside.
   He visited 14 countries and the Caribbean island of St. Martin
in 1989 and is bound for Cartagena, Colombia, next month in a
dramatic gesture of support for Colombian President Virgilio Barco
and his battle against drug lords.
   Bush proved himself, in Sununu's phrase, ``the master of the
small gesture,'' a telephone addict who reached out to world
leaders on a regular basis. That knack came in handy in August when
a flurry of Bush calls helped persuade terrorists in Lebanon to
lift a death threat against American hostage Joseph Cicippio.
   Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution scholar, said Bush had the
luck to become president in a year when the Berlin Wall fell and
old communist regimes were shaken to their roots.
   But it was also America's luck that it had a president so
steeped in foreign affairs, he said.
   ``His skills do fit the time,'' Hess said. ``What we've got is a
very cautious man. That's exactly what we needed. When you can't
predict what's going to happen in the world with any sense of
confidence one week ahead, the wise course is the prudent course.''
   The Panama invasion also ``reminded the rest of the world that
they can't take him for granted,'' said Hess.
   Bush's public approval ratings exceed 70 percent in some polls _
higher than Reagan ever achieved. His wife, Barbara, proved a big
hit with the American public, and Bush attributes some of his own
popularity to hers.
   With the economy still expanding and a ``feast of miracles''
unfolding in East Europe, ``it's hard to be unpopular,'' said
Daniels.
   But the public can be fickle in its love affair with presidents.
   While Bush stands high in the ratings now, polling experts say
he does not command the intense loyalty from a sizable cadre of
supporters that Reagan could always count on.
   ``He hasn't built intensive support. That may come back to haunt
him,'' said Larry J. Sabato, a political scientist at the
University of Virginia.

<HEAD>After the Euphoria, Romania Has Bills To Pay and Jobs To Fill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>IASI, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doru Tigau, a philosophy professor, sat in
a chair occupied until a few weeks ago by a niece of Nicolae
Ceausescu. He smoked an endless chain of cigarettes and talked
about trying to run Romania's revolution in an out-of-the way place
like Iasi.
   ``For the time being, this is a nightmare,'' he said. ``There is
a leadership in Bucharest that isn't giving us instructions, but
giving us a general line.''
   But he has ideas.
   ``Everyone should take as much land as he and his family can
work without hiring someone else to work for him,'' he said. ``A
hard-working man can have everything, but a lazy man has nothing or
changes his job.''
   Tigau, 43, is the president of the 24-member local branch of the
National Salvation Front, which has taken over Communist Party
headquarters in Iasi, a city of 300,000 people on the Soviet border.
   In his hands, and in the hands of other local leaders like him,
may rest Romania's future as a democracy.
   After the euphoria of victory, nuts-and-bolts administrative
problems face inexperienced local leaders like Tigau who are trying
to turn an uprising against the leadership into a revolution in
every aspect of society:
   _The revolution has no money, but bills still must be paid.
   _There is no personal security, but bands of Ceausescu's secret
police have disappeared. Nervous soldiers keeping the peace
mistakenly have threatened leaders of the revolution as well.
   _More than 200 Ceausescu loyalists must be replaced in top
government jobs in the region.
   The revolt that led to Nicolae Ceausescu's execution on
Christmas Day went off quietly in Iasi. No bullet holes pock the
walls of buildings and no memorials mark the places, as they do in
the capital, Bucharest, where people fell to the gunfire of
Ceausescu's personal guard.
   Now Tigau is the leader of Iasi, presiding from the long,
paneled office where the local Communist Party leader, Ceausescu's
niece, Maria Ghitulica, once ran things.
   Up from his desk and pacing the floor to stay awake, and still
smoking, Tigau consulted with subordinates on selecting a new
official to take responsibility for cultural affairs and he
expounded on the need to put land back in the hands of peasants.
   Tigau said he never actively opposed the Ceausescu leadership
but expressed his opposition in trying to show his students the
difference between reality and what the dictator preached.
   Across the border in Soviet Moldavia, Deputy Premier Mikhail S.
Platon said in an interview that contacts with the new local
leaders of Iasi showed them to be enthusiastic but inexperienced.
   ``They are young people,'' he said.
   One of the problems in Iasi is that the revolution is without
money. The hundreds of volunteers racing busily around in the
three-story party headquarters are not getting paid for it, nor
does the local National Salvation Front have any way of getting
money.
   While willing to help foreign visitors make long-distance
telephone calls, Tigau's team insisted that the calls be paid for
directly to the telephone exchange in local currency, the lei. So
while an operator traveled from the telephone office to collect the
money and then put through the call, travelers' dollars were taken
to the local bank.
   There, as under the repressive Ceausescu regime, the serial
numbers of the bills were registered before the bank handed over
the official exchange of Romanian currency.
   But lodging in the main tourist hotel, usually the equivalent in
leis of about $30 a night, was free.
   ``You must not pay,'' said a desk clerk named Irina.
   Why not?
   ``That's just the new rule.''
   After the revolution, the supply of food improved in Iasi.
   Georgetta Agape, a young sales clerk at a meat counter in an
Iasi food store, said she no longer had to experience the shame of
asking to see peoples' identifications before she could sell them
rationed meat.
   ``For the first time in many years we had such delicacies as
salami, ham and pork,'' she said. But the store was sold out of
them by nightfall.
   Even the unofficial price of Kent cigarettes, for years
Romania's unofficial ``black'' currency for the procurement of
goods in great demand, dropped dramatically from about 200 lei a
pack _ $22.70 at the still-prevailing official rate of exchange _
as Kents went on sale in regular stores, several people said.
   The old Communist Party Central Committee headquarters is now
guarded by soldiers with automatic weapons.
   Tigau recalled that he and the army captain in charge of
security at the revolutionary headquarters were detained as they
walked nearby at 4:30 one morning by anxious young soldiers manning
an armored personnel carrier.
   Guns were taken away from the two, and Tigau recalled the young
soldier asking the officer in charge: ``What do we do now, shoot
them?'' Instead, they were taken to the nearby Palace of Culture
where cooler heads checked their identities and let them go.
   Another time a woman seeking a meeting with Tigau in his office
was found to be carrying a knife.
   Civilians unaccustomed to weapons that had been strictly
controlled carried guns in the first days of the uprising, adding
to the uncertainty and tension.
   Mihai Avadanei, a teacher of English and a translator, said in
amazement: ``I'm 48 years old, and I was carrying a gun _ and I was
ready to use it!''
   But in contrast to the heavy cordons of soldiers and
paratroopers around leaders in the capital, no security is provided
for the new local leaders of the revolution or their families in
Iasi.
   That compounds worries about the 200 members of Ceausescu's
Securitate secret police who were stationed in Iasi and who, local
officials say, disappeared after the revolt. The army confiscated
their weapons, but many people believe that Securitate had secret
stocks hidden elsewhere.
   The Central Committee's stack of books by and about Ceausescu
are being gathered for disposal.
   When Tigau opened cabinets and the safe of Mrs. Ghitulica,
Ceausescu's niece, he said, he found packages of foreign-made hose
and women's underwear, her Communist Party card, 62,000 lei in
checks and a telegram from an unknown source appealing to Iasi to
join the revolt against Ceausescu.
   Beyond the day-to-day problems that take so much of his time,
Tigau reserves his revolutionary passion for changing the country's
agricultural system and bringing better qualified people into the
leadership.
   ``The only criterion will be the value of the man, his
competence,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter if he agrees with us or
not.''
   ``We don't want to install their terror, the terror of the
so-called proletarian revolution,'' he said. ``This is the
revolution of intellectual, peaceful people.''

   Debt-swamped Campeau Corp. of Canada sought
bankruptcy court refuge for its U.S. department stores, keeping
open famous chains such as Bloomingdale's, Lazarus and Rich's while
struggling to reorganize.
   The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing Monday was the biggest ever by
a retailing business and affects 258 department stores with 100,000
employees, visited by millions of consumers nationwide.
   Officials of Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. and
Allied Stores Corp. units quickly sought to reassure customers,
employees and merchandise suppliers that business would continue as
usual.
   The filing reflected Campeau's problems paying the
multibillion-dollar debt it accumulated in acquiring Allied in 1986
and Federated in 1988.

   The American retail industry, shaken by the
financial debacle of debt-choked Campeau Corp., will undergo
dramatic change in the 1990s with big mass merchandisers at a
disadvantage to specialty chains, store executives and economists
said.
   The days are numbered for giant retailers trying to be all
things to all people. Stores without a sharp focus will lose
customers while competitors that clearly state their pitches to
niches will gobble up market share, according to views presented
Monday at the National Retail Merchants Association's 79th Annual
Convention.
   ``In a time-short environment, consumers will be more attracted
to stores that have a clear identity,'' said Rosalind Wells, chief
economist of the association.

   The Bush administration is getting ready to
offer a new enticement to encourage Americans to be more thrifty
and boost the country's low savings rate, administration officials
said.
   President Bush will ask Congress to create a new ``family
savings account'' that would allow people to earn tax-free interest
and dividends on money that is squirreled away for a specified
number of years, officials said Monday.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
savings accounts would be part of the president's 1991 budget, due
to be released on Jan. 29.

   Merrill spokesman Fred Yager said Monday the reductions would be

selling off businesses. The firm announced plans for
across-the-board cuts in November.
   The cuts should reduce Merrill's total work force to about
36,800, compared with 40,500 at the end of 1989 and a peak of
47,000 shortly before the October 1987 stock market crash.

   None of the 258 stores operated by Federated Department Stores
Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. is expected to close although some may
be sold as part of any future restructuring, which will have to be
approved by a bankruptcy judge. Under Chapter 11 of the Federal
Bankruptcy Act, companies are shielded from creditors while they
remain in business and attempt to reorganize their finances so all
debts eventually can be repaid. Many companies emerge from Chapter
11 as smaller but financially sound businesses.
   In Campeau's case, the Chapter 11 filing's immediate result
would be to keep stores open and supplied. Many businesses had been
reluctant to continue shipping merchandise to Campeau stores
because they weren't sure they'd be paid, but the filing will
establish a timetable for payment that could help reassure these
suppliers.
   It was unclear how the filing may affect Campeau's 110,000
employees in the United States, some of whom presumably could be
laid off in any bankruptcy restructuring.
   Immediately, however, the company's stores have indicated that
employees would continue to receive pay and benefits and business
would continue as usual.
   Uncertainty over whether Campeau would be able to repay the $8
billion in debts it has acquired through takeovers of Federated and
Allied was the main reason the parent company sought bankruptcy
court refuge for its U.S. units.

   Here is a list of events chronicling Campeau Corp.'s
debt-financed expansion into a U.S. retailing giant and its rapid
descent into a financial crisis, which forced the Canadian company
to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for its American
department store chains on Monday:
   Dec. 31, 1986 _ Campeau buys Allied Stores Corp. for $3.4
billion, marking the real estate development company's first major
foray into the American retailing industry.
   Jan. 5, 1987 _ Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission show Campeau plans to sell 16 Allied divisions and cut
its holdings of nearly 700 stores by more than half in order to pay
$1.1 billion in bank loans used to finance the takeover.
   April 13, 1987 _ Campeau agrees to sell Allied's 260-store
Joske's chain and four-store Cain-Sloan chain to Dillard Department
Stores Inc. for $255 million.
   April 30, 1987 _ Campeau agrees to sell Allied's 13-store Bonwit
Teller chain for $101 million to Hooker Corp. Ltd., one of
Australia's largest and oldest conglomerates that would later
encounter financial trouble itself.
   Jan. 25, 1988 _ Campeau, still digesting its takeover of Allied,
makes a $4.2 billion bid for Federated Department Stores Inc., but
the nation's fifth-largest retailing company vows to resist.
   Feb. 3, 1988 _ Campeau sweetens the offer to $5.2 billion, but
Federated rejects the offer as inadequate and indicates it's
talking with other possible suitors about a ``white knight''
purchase.
   Feb. 16, 1988 _ Campeau again sweetens the offer to $5.7 billion
but Federated rejects it.
   Feb. 29, 1988 _ R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc. makes a surprise $6.1
billion offer for Federated. Campeau scrambles to respond and
within hours makes a competitive offer.
   March 8-31, 1988 _ In a flurry of complex legal steps and
countersteps, Campeau and Macy maneuver to win control of Federated
in a bidding war that raises the price by nearly $2.5 billion above
Campeau's original offer.
   April 1, 1988 _ Campeau wins Federated in a $6.6 billion
compromise deal, arranged in a three-hour meeting between chairman
Robert Campeau and Macy chairman Edward Finkelstein. Under the
arrangement, Macy buys two Federated divisions, 29-store Bullock's
and Bullock's-Wilshire and 25-store I. Magnin, for $1.1 billion,
giving Macy's a strong presence in California. In addition, Campeau
agrees to sell Allied's 46-store Brooks Brothers unit to Britain's
Marks &amp; Spencer PLC for $750 million, and agrees to sell
Federated's 16-store Filene's and 37-store Foley's chains to May
Department Stores Co. for more than $1 billion.
   Sept. 7, 1988 _ Campeau sells Federated's Gold Circle and
Richway chains totaling 76 stores to Kimco Development Corp. for
$325 million.
   Nov. 1, 1988 _ Uncertainty over the outlook for junk-bond
financing forces Campeau to delay a planned sale of more than $1
billion in the debt securities. The delay is seen by some retailing
analysts as a sign that Campeau may have taken excessive risks in
relying heavily on debt to expand.
   Nov. 29, 1988 _ Campeau sells Allied's 91-store Ann Taylor
specialty clothing chain for $430 million to an investor group that
includes the chain's management and Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
The sale marks a reversal for Campeau, which had once vowed to keep
Ann Taylor as one of its crown jewels, and is seen as another sign
that Campeau is having trouble financing its debts.
   April 28, 1989 _ Campeau President James Roddy and a key
financial executive quit over differences with the chairman over
how to approach the company's growing financial problems. It is the
latest of many departures that undermine the company's senior
management.
   Sept. 8, 1989 _ Under growing pressure because of debts
approaching $10 billion, Campeau announces a major financial
restructuring that would involve an emergency $250 million loan
from Canadian developer Olympia &amp; York and the sale of its prized
Bloomingdale's chain. Robert Campeau loses effective control of the
retailing side of his empire.
   Dec. 13, 1989 _ Campeau admits for the first time that its
retail subsidiaries may have to seek Chapter 11 protection to
resolve their financial problems.
   Dec. 14, 1989 _ Merchandise credit firms, worried that Campeau's
retailing units could run out of cash in weeks, cut off credit on
shipments to Campeau stores. With Christmas sales showing
disappointing results, speculation grows over how the stores will
pay for the merchandise in their Spring 1990 season.
   Dec. 23, 1989 _ Citibank tells Campeau it is technically in
default on more than $2.3 billion in debt and requests an
explanation that would show the company's operations are solvent.
   Jan. 2, 1990 _ Citibank gives Campeau more time to provide
reassurances on its financial conditions.
   Jan. 4, 1990 _ National Bank of Canada seizes 35 percent of
Campeau Corp. voting stock after another company controlled by
Robert Campeau defaults on a loan.
   Jan. 10, 1990 _ Campeau's U.S. retailing operations say they
have mailed payments to apparel suppliers on time. But speculation
persists that the units will seek bankruptcy court refuge.
   Jan. 15 _ Campeau's U.S. retailing units file for protection
from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws,
which allows them a repreive from creditors while working out a way
to pay their debts and keep stores open.

   The Chapter 11 petition Monday by Campeau Corp.'s department
store operations in the United States marked the biggest bankruptcy
court filing ever for a retailer.
   Here is a brief look at Campeau Corp., what happened and who is
immediately affected:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>The Company:</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   Once a construction and real estate development company,
Toronto-based Campeau Corp. became primarily known for acquiring
Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. in the
United States, where founder Robert Campeau gambled he could make
an immense fortune. The chains operate 258 stores throughout the
country, ranging from Bloomingdale's in the East to Lazarus in the
Midwest and South to the Bon Marche in the West. The immense debt
the companies incurred in the buyout by Campeau, combined with
disappointing retail sales, crimped their ability to meet interest
payments and merchandise bills.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Events Leading To Chapter 11:</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   Bank creditors led by Citibank pressured Campeau last month to
show it could pay $2.34 billion in loans, a fraction of its total
obligations. Suppliers of credit and merchandise to Campeau stores
began to withhold delivery, fearing they wouldn't get paid. Some
employees and Campeau stores reported local banks wouldn't cash
their paychecks. Many observers speculated that bankruptcy court
was the most logical strategy for allowing the retailing operations
to remain open while the parent companies worked out a way to pay
their debts.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Impact Of Chapter 11:</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   Under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law, Campeau's
retailing units will get an immediate reprieve from creditor bills
while a reorganization plan is devised to satisfy debts. Suppliers
likely will resume or continue shipments, confident they will be
paid. Federated and Allied said the stores will continue to operate
as normal, employees will still get pay and benefits, and customer
services _ credit card sales, merchandise returns, gift
certificates, for example _ would continue as normal. A
reorganization plan, which might include the sale of some stores,
and all other major business moves must be approved by a bankruptcy
judge.

   The 66-year-old French Canadian entrepreneur, largely unknown in
the United States until a few years ago, made a fortune in
construction and eventually became one of Canada's biggest real
estate developers. He spent $10 billion, much of it in borrowed
money, to buy Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores
Inc., confident the debt could be repaid despite widespread
skepticism and a mixed outlook for the retailing industry.

<HEAD>Temple Offers To Drop Sea Containers Bid In Return For Asset Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Temple Holdings Ltd. has offered to drop its
hostile $1.04 billion offer for Sea Containers Ltd. if its target
agreed to sell Temple substantial portions of its ferry and
container businesses.
   In a letter Monday to Sea Containers Chairman James Sherwood,
Temple offered pay $967 million in cash plus the more than 838,000
Sea Containers shares Temple now holds in return for the assets.
   Temple offered to buy part of Sea Containers' British ferry
service and facilities and its dry cargo and tank container
business.
   A Sea Containers spokesman did immediately return a reporter's
call for comment on the offer.
   Temple's offer was subject to several conditions, including Sea
Containers' termination of agreements to sell some of its assets to
Genstar Container Corp. and Itel Corp.
   Sea Containers, which operates ferries including those in the
English Channel, had agreed to $1 billion in asset sales as part of
its defense against Temple. The company also decided to pursue a
recapitalization plan offering $70 a share to sellers of up to 7
million shares.
   Shareholders were scheduled to vote on the plan late next month.
   Investors, speculating Monday that Sea Containers would agree to
the Temple offer and give up its plan to buy back shares, took
their profits while they could. Sea Containers stock fell $7.37{ to
$59.37{ a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Temple, a ferry consortium owned by Sweden's Stena Holdings AG
and Britain's Tiphook PLC, first offered last May to buy Sea
Containers for $824 million, or $50 a share per common share and
$80.50 a share for preferred.
   After Sea Containers rejected the overture, Temple sweetened the
bid twice, most recently offering $70 a share for Sea Containers'
common stock and $112.70 a share for its preferred issues.
   Sea Containers turned down the second and third bids as well.

   AT&amp;T customers can use the long-distance phone
services provided by MCI Communications Corp., US Sprint and other
companies despite the fact they are wired directly to the AT&amp;T
system.
   To use Sprint, AT&amp;T customers must dial the Sprint access code,
10333, then 1, then the area code they are calling, then the phone
number.
   ``That will bypass the AT&amp;T lines and put them directly onto US
Sprint lines,'' said US Sprint customer service representative
Frank Dotson. ``They'll get the charge on their local telephone
invoice.''
   To use MCI, call the MCI access code, 10222, then 1, the area
code and the number. These calls likewise will be billed through
the caller's local phone company bill.
   The access codes work in most parts of the country, the
companies said.

<HEAD>Merrill Lynch To Cut About 3,000 Jobs This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. plans to slash about 3,000
jobs in 1990 _ including about 1,000 layoffs _ in another sign of
hard times on Wall Street.
   The cuts should reduce the total work force at the nation's
largest brokerage to about 36,800, compared with 40,500 at the end
of 1989 and a peak of 47,000 shortly before the October 1987 stock
market crash.
   ``What we've seen is just a continuation of the staff reductions
all over Wall Street,'' said John Keefe, a securities industry
analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``Merrill is a big place.
In terms of numbers they have the biggest potential for cuts.''
   Merrill spokesman Fred Yager said Monday that the reductions
would be spread throughout the year and occur through layoffs,
attrition and selling off businesses. The firm announced plans for
across-the-board trimming in November.
   Yager said the firm had no target for the size reductions. But a
Merrill official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
reductions would total about 3,000, including as many as 1,000
layoffs.
   ``We are going through a selective process and there will be
selective layoffs as we go along,'' Yager said.
   Merrill reduced about 700 positions earlier this month by
selling its Canadian retail brokerage operation and eliminated 300
more jobs through cuts in its Broadcort Capital Corp.
account-clearing business.
   Since November, Merrill also has abandoned the European
commercial paper business, eliminated one equity division at its
New York headquarters and reduced trading of British stocks.
Merrill has slashed about 40 out of 600 jobs in its equities
trading area and 10 of 130 in equities research this month.
   Brokerage firms across Wall Street have suffered because of
overcapacity stemming from pre-crash days and too little business.
More than 23,000 jobs have been cut on Wall Street in a
retrenchment since the crash.
   Despite strong stock and bond markets last year, the industry
has been in a downturn in part because of an exodus by individual
investors and a decline in businesses such as investment banking.
   ``Merrill is one of the powerhouses on the Street,'' Keefe said.
``They have just about every business there and business is in a
slowdown generally.''
   For the first nine months of 1989, Merrill earnings fell 20.8
percent to $148 million, compared with $187 million in the same
1988 period. The firm has not yet released its fourth-quarter
results.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the No. 2 brokerage, said Monday it
expects to report a fourth-quarter profit of $1 million to $5
million, compared with a $13 million loss in 1988.
   Before taxes, though, the firm said it would lose $7 million to
$13 million, down from $17 million a year ago. Shearson said
fourth-quarter expenses also would include about $7 million in
severance payments from previously announced staff reductions.
   For the full year, Shearson said it expects net income of $107
million to $111 million, up from $96 million in 1988.
   Shearson in December announced a $900 million recapitalization
plan to preserve its credit rating and reduce American Express
Co.'s ownership to below 50 percent. The firm also began laying off
800 workers, reshuffled its senior management and slashed
stockbroker commissions.

<TEXT>
   Specialty chains will have an edge over mass
merchandisers as the American retail industry adapts to changing
consumer needs in the 1990s, executives and economists say.
   The days are numbered for giant retailers trying to be all
things to all people. Stores without a sharp focus will lose
customers while competitors making clear pitches to niches will
gobble up market share, according to views presented Monday at the
National Retail Merchants Association's 79th Annual Convention.
   And on a day when debt-choked Campeau Corp. announced it was
sheltering its U.S. retailers in bankruptcy court, industry
executives predicted a bleak future for heavily leveraged store
groups.
   Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc. _
operators of many prominent U.S. department stores _ were placed
under court protection from creditors. It was the largest filing
under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code ever made by a U.S.
retailer.
   Chains run by Allied and Federated, accounting for nearly 260
department stores, will stay in business while a reorganization
plan is plotted. Campeau took on a crushing debt burden when it
bought Federated for $6.6 billion in 1988 and Allied for $3.4
billion in 1986.
   William R. Howell, chairman and chief executive officer of J.C.
Penney Co. Inc., said it will become increasingly difficult for
debt-laden retailers with weak balance sheets to remain independent
or even survive.
   ``We'll continue to see a shake-out process in the years
ahead,'' he said at the convention held in a New York hotel. ``The
retail business has been hurt by overpriced mergers _ and by the
resultant over-leveraging of companies.''
   Thomas E. Swanstrom, chief economist of Sears, Roebuck and Co.,
said some of the problems caused by the Campeau crisis should
subside in a few months.
   Campeau's desperation for cash late last year forced its stores
to slash prices to attract customers and boost sales. Competing
stores had to follow suit, which pinched profits.
   Retailers face other challenges to profitability, partly due to
weak consumer spending. Forecasters agreed the economy will remain
sluggish but stay out of a recession.
   Robert T. Parry, president and chief executive officer of the
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, predicted the gross national
product, after adjustment for inflation, will rise only about 2
percent in 1990.
   Norman Robertson, chief economist for Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh,
said American consumers will channel more of their income into
savings. ``For retailers, it's going to be a tough year'' requiring
an adjustment after the prolonged economic strength during the
1980s.
   One bright spot is that general merchandise inflation has been
receding, according to Swanstrom of Chicago-based Sears, the
nation's biggest retailer.
   He said sales of general merchandise, apparel, furniture and
appliances should grow by about 6 percent this year, the same as in
1989. But inflation will be lower so real sales growth will be
greater this year, he predicted.
   Convention speakers said retailers who want to thrive in the
'90s, when customers will prefer to devote less time to shopping,
must take steps to set themselves apart.
   ``In a time-short environment, consumers will be more attracted
to stores that have a clear identity,'' said Rosalind Wells, chief
economist of the retail association.
   She said retailers can use a range of characteristics to achieve
the goal, including price, service, quality, convenience, fashion,
assortment and inventory depth.
   Sprawling general merchandise chains that don't tailor their
strategy to appeal to particular population segments could suffer.
   ``Today, it is accepted that the general merchandiser is a
dinosaur,'' said Howell of Dallas-based Penney. ``The '90s will
confirm that the future belongs to retailers who choose a niche _
and then focus on demographic and lifestyle trends within that
niche to keep up with the consumer.''

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Filing Doesn't Disrupt Business at Campeau Stores</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp.'s department stores placed under bankruptcy court
protection are trying to carry on as if nothing happened and
customers are not likely to notice any immediate disruption in
business.
   ``We are open. We are open normal hours. We have a lot of
merchandise to sell,'' Chairman Mark Cohen of Cincinnati-based
Lazarus said after the bankruptcy filing Monday.
   Executives at the other eight chains owned by heavily indebted
Campeau also sought to reassure customers that they were open for
business as usual, and employees were told their jobs weren't in
jeopardy.
   Vendors said they would continue to ship merchandise to the 258
department stores operated by Allied Stores Corp. and Federated
Department Stores Inc., Campeau's biggest U.S. retail subsidiaries.
   Campeau, saddled with heavy debts from trying to build a
coast-to-coast retail empire, filed for protection from creditors
on behalf of Allied and Federated under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. The filing allows the retailers to remain in
business while they reorganize.
   Store officials tried to put the filing in as positive a light
as possible. By placing the chains' financial fate in the hands of
a bankruptcy court judge in Cincinnati, where Allied and Federated
are based, the stores could operate free from debt worries, the
officials said.
   In addition to Lazarus, Campeau's chains include Abraham &amp;
Straus, Bloomingdale's, The Bon Marche, Burdine's, Maas Brothers,
Jordan Marsh and Rich's-Goldsmith's.
   The Bloomingdale's flagship store in New York City opened 10
minutes late because employees were still listening over intercoms
to a statement from Chairman Marvin S. Traub and President Jeffrey
Sherman.
   ``Chapter 11 signifies a new beginning and is certainly the best
alternative for us at Bloomingdale's,'' the statement said in part.
``It provides us with a fresh start and enables us to go forward.''
   Similar statements were issued elsewhere.
   At Jordan Marsh in Boston, Richard Van Pelt, chairman and chief
executive officer, and Sam Simmons, president and chief operating
officer, said all stores would remain open, merchandise shipments
would continue, and all employees would continue to be paid and
receive benefits.
   Store policies, such as credit, gift certificates, billing
adjustments, merchandise returns, and service contracts also would
continue, the executives said.
   Normalcy also was the operative word at The Bon Marche, based in
Seattle. John Buller, vice president of sales and marketing, said
the chain has been doing well and sales were unaffected Monday by
the filing. ``In fact, business has been very good. We're having a
heck of a January.''
   Cohen of Lazarus said he is confident the store group has a
bright future. He said all customer services will be continued,
employees will be paid on schedule and suppliers will be paid under
the Bankruptcy Court's supervision.
   Meanwhile, Ralphs Grocery Co., a separate subsidiary of Campeau,
called a news conference to say the southern California supermarket
chain was in fine financial shape and was not included in the
Allied-Federated filing.
   Clothing and other manufacturers who supply Allied and Federated
stores seemed comforted by the filing. Several who had previously
suspended merchandise shipments said they would start supplying the
stores again.
   ``We intend to commence shipments of our products as soon as the
bankruptcy courts allow us to do so, thereby averting any
disruption in delivery of our merchandise to these stores,'' said
Howard Cooley, president of Jockey International, an underwear
maker.
   Shoppers expressed surprise and sadness that some of their
favorite stores were having to cope with severe financial problems.
   ``It's a sad move,'' said Maria Perez, a customer at Miami-based
Burdine's. She said that with the stores in bankruptcy proceedings,
she wasn't sure whether she would continue shopping there.
   ``I've been seeing it coming,'' she said. ``The clothes now are
not as good quality as a couple of years ago.''
   Other shoppers at Miami's International Mall said they would
remain loyal to Burdine's. ``It's a good store, with good
merchandise and the workers are always helpful. I hope they stay
open and have business the same way,'' said Sixto Hernandez of
Miami.
   For the most part, customers took a practical approach. On the
main floor of Rich's flagship store in downtown Atlanta, Evelyn
Oglesby of Stone Mountain, Ga., said she hoped the store would
survive the financial problems of its parent company.
   But if it didn't, Mrs. Oglesby said, ``I'm hoping they have a
big sale, and I hope I won't have to pay off my credit card.''

<HEAD>Chip Consortium Blames Demise On Lack Of Long-Term Strategy Of
Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATALINA ORTIZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leaders of U.S. Memories said the
planned computer chip-making consortium failed because the
electronics industry lacks a long-term strategy to compete with
Japan.
   ``We had an opportunity as a nation and an industry to send a
message and we missed it,'' said Sanford L. Kane, president of the
now-defunct joint venture.
   U.S. Memories, formed six months ago with the hope of expanding
America's small output of dynamic random access memory chips, or
DRAMs, announced Monday it was dissolving because of inadequate
financial support from computer companies.
   Japanese companies now supply about 75 percent of the market
while U.S. manufacturers have less than 10 percent. U.S. Memories
hoped to take 25 percent of the U.S. market.
   The consortium was born at a time when short supplies had driven
up the price of DRAMs, which store data in a wide range of
electronic products and are often compared to crude oil in their
importance to industry.
   Since then, chip supplies have increased and prices have
dropped, in part because several companies, including Samsung of
South Korea, have started production, analysts say.
   At a meeting in Dallas on Wednesday, most of U.S. Memories'
original seven investors and four potential backers were unwilling
to put up enough money to enable the consortium to build a $1
billion plant, Kane told a news conference. The companies also
would not promise to buy enough of its 4-megabit DRAMs, he said.
   U.S. companies apparently no longer think they have a problem
with chip supplies, Kane said.
   ``What happens today does not bode well for an industry that has
made a technical decision rather than a tactical one,'' Kane said.
   Wilfred Corrigan, U.S. Memories' chairman, said the issue for
American companies wasn't simply one of adequate supply but more a
matter of control over it. He gave grudging praise to Japan's
``coaching and quarterbacking.''
   ``You look at a U.S. laptop computer today, and the display
comes from Japan, the memory comes from Japan,'' he said. ``The
computer has simply become the gift box in which Japanese products
get mailed to the user.''
   One analyst predicted the collapse of the consortium would have
no immediate effect.
   ``The bottom line is today there's a good supply (of DRAMs) and
the prices are low and going lower,'' said Fred Jones of Dataquest
in San Jose.
   Officials in states that vied for the planned U.S. Memories
plant and industry representatives were disappointed by the
announcement.
   ``It is truly a shame that the facility plans could not go
forward,'' said Arizona Gov. Rose Mofford in a statement. Phoenix,
Colorado Springs, Colo., Austin, Texas and Middletown, N.Y., were
the four sites U.S. Memories was considering for its plant.
   The consortium's original investors were International Business
Machines Corp., Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Intel
Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., National Semiconductor Corp.
and LSI Logic.
   Although U.S. companies in several industries have cooperated in
recent years on joint research projects, U.S. Memories was planned
as the first consortium to manufacture products.
   U.S. Memories originally planned to pay for the plant with $500
million in equity financing from chip makers and users and $500
million in debt, with fund-raising expected to be completed last
year.
   The consortium later decided it would need only $400 million in
debt and $350 million in equity _ $150 million from industry
investors and the rest from outside backers. Computer companies,
however, also would have had to agree to buy 75 to 80 percent of
the consortium's chips.
   But at the meeting last week, only IBM and Digital maintained
the ``major'' commitment to the venture, Kane said.
   Kane declined to give details of the commitments from individual
companies, however. He also declined to criticize individual
companies for their decisions.
   Hewlett-Packard said through a spokeswoman that it was
disappointed by U.S. Memories' announcement and expressed surprise
at ``the lack of the support for it among computer-systems
companies.''

<TEXT>
   Stocks fell sharply at midday Tuesday amid
concerns about price declines on overseas markets and the
possibility over higher British interest rates.
   At noon local time, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was down 31.4 points at 2,334.8 points, compared with an
opening peak of 2,369.7 points. At its lowest, the index briefly
touched 2,332.7 points.
   Midday volume fell to 258.6 million shares from 207.2 million
Monday.
   The index opened slightly higher, despite a sharp 666.41-point
fall to 36,850.36 in Tokyo's Nikkei index earlier Tuesday. But,
when other European markets opened lower, including the important
West German market, London felt compelled to follow.
   The downward trend was accentuated by an early fall in the stock
index futures contracts, which encouraged the underlying market to
move lower.
   ``Quite a few sellers emerged which was enough to harm already
nervous sentiment,'' one dealer said.
   Also, a rise in three-month interbank money rates, which
provides an early signal of the expected course of British interest
rates, helped sour sentiment, dealers said.

   Former tennis star Bjorn Borg went on
trial Tuesday to face an $82 million lawsuit by a former business
partner.
   The suit was brought by Lars Skarke, his former partner and
managing director of the Bjorn Borg Design Group, the fashion
business which filed for bankruptcy last summer.
   Skarke, who owned 25 percent of the group, claimed Borg violated
a shareholder agreement. He also sued the five-time Wimbledon
champion for his original investment, for damages, and for loss of
income.
   The group filed for bankruptcy after quick expansion left it
short of cash, and Borg turned down financing offers for fear of

   Honeywell Inc. says it has agreed to
establish a joint venture in East Germany that would provide
industrial automation equipment to the country's petroleum and
chemical plants.
   In what would be its third Eastern bloc joint venture, Honeywell
said Monday that it has signed a letter of intent with VE AHB
Industrianlagen Import, an East German-owned trading company with
which the Minnesota-based company has had a 30-year business
relationship.
   In 1983, Honeywell established a joint venture with a Bulgarian
ministry and did the same in 1988 in the Soviet Union.
   Honeywell's initial investment in the East German venture
probably will be less than $1 million, with the deal expected to
generate about $50 million in revenues for Honeywell over five
years, said Mike Bonsignore, the company's international president.

   The stock market opened broadly lower today,
unnerved by a steep slide in Tokyo.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 14.29 to 2,655.08

<TEXT>
   Coffee exports rose by more than 20 percent in the
first five months after international controls on sales were lifted
in July, the International Coffee Organization reported Tuesday.
   Figures released by the 69-nation organization showed that its
50 coffee-producing member countries, which account for 99 per cent
of all coffee exports, shipped 32.51 million bags in July-November
1989, compared with 25.58 million in the same period in 1988. One
bag equals 132 pounds (60 kg).
   The coffee organization lifted its export quota system on July 4
after consumers and producers failed to agree on terms for
maintaining it. The system was aimed at stabilizing prices by
balancing supply with import demand.
   The organization's 16-member executive board opened a two-day
meeting Tuesday to discuss the impasse which led to the decision.
   Prices have fallen sharply in the free market, and reached a
14-year low on the London market on Tuesday.
   Coffee for March delivery traded at $968.55 a metric ton Tuesday
morning, $6.60 below the previous low reached Monday.

   Lawyers for a business newsletter say a court
order preventing publication of an article about the Big Six
accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young violates freedom of the press.
   The order, issued Jan. 8 by New York Supreme Court Judge
Beatrice Shainswit, bars Bowman's Accounting Report, a newsletter
based in Atlanta, from disclosing confidential or proprietary
information on Ernst &amp; Young.
   The article planned for the front page of the January edition
was to have analyzed the merger in June of Ernst &amp; Whinney and
Arthur Young, a story the newsletter broke in May.
   Editor Arthur W. Bowman instead published the issue with a black
cover and the word ``censored'' in bold white letters.
   Ernst Young alleges in court papers that the newsletter has
confidential information on the company.
   Keegan Federal, an attorney for the newsletter, on Tuesday
called the order a ``major First Amendment issue. This is an
unconstitutional prior restraint.''
   But Carl Liggio, general counsel for Ernst &amp; Young, said the
issue has nothing to do with prior restraint.
   ``He can write any stories he wants. But he can't make use of
confidential information in any manner, shape or form,'' Liggio
said.
   A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 22 in New York. Federal said he
will argue that the restraining order should be lifted.

   Bankruptcy court filings released today show
Campeau Corp.'s two department store divisions owe billions of
dollars to a range of unsecured creditors, mostly banks and Wall
Street firms that helped finance the retailing giant's expansion.
   The filings in the largest bankruptcy proceeding in retailing
history showed total assets of $9.1 billion and liabilities of $7.7
billion for the units of the Canadian company.
   Campeau placed them under federal bankruptcy court supervision
Monday so they could reorganize to pay their debts under Chapter 11
of the Federal Bankruptcy Act.
   In another development, Campeau's U.S. subsidiary appointed G.
William Miller, former Federal Reserve Board chairman and Treasury
secretary, as its chairman and chief executive officer.
   The company also announced that it would change its name from
Campeau Corp. (U.S.) Inc. to Federated Stores Inc.
   The U.S. subsidiary of Toronto-based Campeau operates such
well-known department stores as Bloomingdale's, Rich's and Lazarus.
The filing allows the stores to continue operating while the
company reorganizes.
   In papers filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Cincinnati,
Federated Department Stores Inc. listed assets of $6.2 billion and
liabilities of $5.3 billion. Allied Stores Corp. listed assets of
$2.9 billion and liabilities of $2.4 billion.
   Federated said its largest unsecured creditor is First Boston
Corp., which holds $428 million in bonds. Allied listed Campeau
Corp. as its largest unsecured creditor, with $100 million in bonds
outstanding.
   The filing Monday was the largest under Chapter 11 by an
American retailer, affecting about 100,000 employees and 258 stores
in the United States, and the second largest ever by a
non-financial company after Texaco Inc., which sought court
protection in April 1987.
   Miller, currently chairman of G. William Miller &amp; Co. Inc., a
Washington-based merchant banking firm, has served on the boards of
Campeau, Federated and Allied since 1987.
   He originally joined Federated's board in 1976 but resigned two
years later when he became the Fed chairman. From 1979 to 1981,
Miller served as Treasury Secretary under President Carter.
   Miller was re-elected to the Federated board in 1981 and after
Campeau bought the retailing company he joined the boards of
Campeau and Allied.
   Campeau also announced other changes regarding senior management
at its U.S. operations, including the resignation of the chairman
of its retailers. Ronald W. Tysoe, currently president of both
Campeau Corp. and Campeau (U.S.), will continue as president of the
newly renamed Federated holding company but he will phase out his
responsibilities at the Canadian parent.
   John W. Burden III, chairman and chief executive officer of
Federated and Allied, has quit effective Jan. 31 ``to pursue other
interests,'' Campeau said. The company said it expects to name a
successor soon to run the retailing operations.
   James M. Zimmerman will remain as president and chief operating
officer of Federated and Allied. The management teams at all
department store chains will continue in place.
   The management at Ralphs Grocery Co., a southern California
supermarket chain owned by Campeau that was not part of the
bankruptcy court filing, will not be changed, Campeau said.
   Miller, 64, steps into a job created when Campeau last week
split its U.S. operations from the parent company, giving them
operating independence.
   ``The company is now positioned with a strong and experienced
management team at all levels to manage what has always been a
highly successful group of American retail businesses _ with a new
name that reflects our retailing orientation,'' he said in a news
release.
   Tysoe said he has been asked by Miller to focus full time on
restructuring the retailers.
   The decision to seek court protection was made late Sunday by
the boards of Campeau and the two divisions and reflected Campeau's
inability to pay off $8 billion in debt, much of it resulting from
the $3.4 billion acquisition of Allied in 1986 and the $6.6 billion
purchase of Federated in 1988.
   ``The decision to seek Chapter 11 relief was based on a
conclusion that action was required at this time in order to
preserve the operations' strength and assets of the two department
store companies while the corporate debt is restructured,'' Campeau
said in a statement Monday.
   Under Chapter 11, the companies get a reprieve from creditors
and can continue operating while reorganizing their finances. But
all decisions regarding the companies must be approved by a
bankruptcy judge.
   Federated's stores include Abraham and Straus and Bloomingdale's
of New York, Burdine's of Miami, Lazarus of Cincinnati and Rich's
of Atlanta. Allied's stores include The Bon Marche of Seattle,
Jordan Marsh of Boston, Maas Brothers of Tampa and Stern's of
Paramus, N.J.

   Junk bond prices fell further today in reaction
to the bankruptcy court filing by two Campeau Corp. divisions and
early declines in the stock and government bond markets.
   Prices of high-yield debt securities were quoted down about &rsqb;
point to { point on average, or about $3.75 to $5 per $1,000 in
face value.
   Junk bonds fell slightly Monday after the Allied Stores Corp.
and Federated Department Stores Inc. sought bankruptcy court
protection. But traders said reaction was muted because of slow
trading on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday and because the
filing was expected.
   When the stock market and government bond markets opened sharply
lower today, junk bonds followed suit, traders said.
   ``A lot of the better-quality names have been quoted down,''
said Joan Greenberg, manager of the high-yield group at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. ``It wasn't very surprising considering the
government securities market and the stock market opened down.''
   She said today's early declines were not entirely a reaction to
Campeau but added, ``What's scary now is not that Campeau filed but
the publicizing of how much unsecured debt is outstanding. ... The
Campeau story is definitely right up front in everybody's minds.''
   Traders said most high-yield issues fell about \ point to {
point Monday, or $2.50 to $5 for every $1,000 in face value of the
bond.

market's fourth straight.
   The $210 billion high-yield bond market has slumped since
Campeau's surprise disclosure of liquidity problems last September.
Prices have not recovered entirely and new issues of junk bonds
have been squelched because of the selloff.
   For the 1989 fourth quarter, analysts said, high-yield bonds
showed a total return of negative 4 percent.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the ratings on
all Allied and Federated subordinated debt because of the filing.
Moody's said about $2.2 billion in Federated and $1.6 billion in
Allied debt securities were affected. It said the companies were in
default on a $2.34 billion bank loan.
   Due to the bankruptcy filing, the Allied and Federated bonds
were trading ``flat,'' that is, without accrued interest. Junk
bonds normally pay interest twice a year. In flat trading, sellers
do not receive interest accrued from the last payment and buyers do
not have to pay it.

   Stock prices lost more ground today amid
recession fears and worries about a falling market in Tokyo.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 91.30 points over
the last two sessions, dropped 6.61 to 2,662.76 by noontime on Wall

   Declining issues overwhelmed advances by nearly 3 to 1 among New

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's most closely followed index, which
had its biggest single-day drop in more than two years on Friday,
followed with a slightly larger plunge today.
   Market analysts said the rout in Tokyo discouraged U.S.
investors who had been awaiting Japan's reaction to a 71-point drop
in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday. The Japanese market
was closed Monday for a national holiday.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 666.41 points, or 1.8

<HEAD>Business Inventories, Sales, Up In November</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business sales and inventories both rose in
November, the government said Tuesday, but economists noted that
slower sales the following month could worsen the December
situation.
   The Commerce Department said inventories rose 0.5 percent to a
seasonally adjusted $796.8 billion in November after rising 0.3
percent a month earlier. The November figure was slightly higher
than the 0.4 percent increase originally reported.
   Business sales were up 0.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted
$523.6 billion, after falling a revised 0.5 percent in October.
That revision compared with the initially reported 0.7 percent drop.
   Inventories often rise during periods of slow economic growth
and could result in production cutbacks and loss of jobs as
businesses try to reduce the accumulation of goods on shelves and
backlots. Such activity is taking place in the auto industry, for
example, as carmakers try to shrink bloated inventories with
production cuts and layoffs.
   ``Retail sales were relatively modest in December,'' said
Evelina Tainer, senior domestic economist for the First National
Bank of Chicago. ``Autos were still weak. So there's a potential
for the (inventories-to-sales ratio) number to worsen.''
   The November business activity caused the ratio of inventories
to sales to decline slightly to 1.52, meaning it would take 1.52
months to exhaust inventories at the November pace. The ratio was
1.53 in October.
   Ms. Tainer did not consider the ratio to be alarming, saying it
was relatively low compared to 10 years ago.
   ``Producers used to keep more inventories and I think they have
become leaner,'' she said. ``So we're not in the same problem area
that we would have been several years ago.''
   Ms. Tainer said the inventory problems that do exist are
concentrated in certain areas such as automobiles.
   Chrysler Co., Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. all have
announced temporary layoffs to reduce their vehicle inventories.
Mazda Motor Corp. of Japan also is trimming production at its U.S.
plant this month.
   Retail inventories rose 0.6 percent in November, while sales
increased 0.5 percent. The Commerce Department reported last week
that retail sales gained only 0.2 percent in December.
   Inventories at the manufacturing level, which represent about 45
percent of the total, rose 0.3 percent. Manufacturing sales
increased 0.5 percent.
   Wholesalers' inventories advanced 0.5 percent, while their sales
jumped 1.2 percent.
   Overall, inventories were 6.8 percent above those of a year ago,
while sales were up 4.4 percent.

<HEAD>Say Some Foreign Majority Ownership Allowable</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's Economics Minister on
Tuesday conceded two more exceptions to joint-venture regulations
that will allow numerous West German firms to hold majority shares.
   Economics Minister Christa Luft told reporters after her talks
with West German counterpart Helmut Haussmann that small- and
medium-sized companies, as well as those large firms with ``superb
know-how,'' will be allowed to become majority owners.
   The East German Parliament approved draft regulations on Friday
that established 49 percent as the upper limit for foreign
ownership of enterprises in East Germany.
   East Germans fear that allowing foreign companies _ especially
wealthy and influential West German industrial giants _ to hold
majority ownership could lead to a ``buyout'' of the economically
troubled state struggling toward democracy.
   But West German firms have rejected the 49 percent limit as too
restrictive and insufficient to attract the major infusions of
capital East Germany needs to turn around its stagnant economy.
   Ms. Luft said East Germany plans to retain the 49 percent
ceiling ``in principle,'' but that exceptions will be made.
   East German openness to exceptions for firms with special
technical know-how appears to open a wide door for West Germany's
numerous aerospace, computer, chemical and engineering firms that
are seeking to establish themselves in the reform-minded nation
next door.
   Hundreds of small, family-run companies have expressed interest
in setting up inter-German ventures, but only on condition that
they own controlling interest in the companies.
   An influential delegation of West German industrialists traveled
to East Berlin over the weekend for talks with Ms. Luft, Communist
Premier Hans Modrow and other officials and political leaders for
talks on how to boost business ties.
   Edzard Reuter, chairman of the Daimler-Benz conglomerate that is
West Germany's largest company and one of the biggest defense and
technology firms in the world, told reporters after the visit that
the 49 percent limit was ``businesswise and psychologically wrong.''
   Ms. Luft and Haussmann said they made good progress in closing
gaps between East German and West German economic cooperation
during their talks in Bonn.
   They announced that a joint committee had been established to
work out the details of an investment protection agreement.

<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. has
traced a computer software failure that blocked millions of
long-distance calls on Monday to a backup system in New York, a top
company official said today.
   Chairman Robert E. Allen also said AT&amp;T plans to offer a
discount day for businesses who may have lost money because
customers were unable to do business by telephone.
   Allen made the comments at a late-morning news conference at the
company's Network Operations Center in Bedminster, N.J.
   The company said Monday's outage, which blocked long-distance
calls nationwide for about nine hours, was its most widespread
ever, but the Martin Luther King Day holiday prevented the impact
from being worse.
   AT&amp;T said it discovered the problem in mid-afternoon and
corrected it shortly before midnight, well before the start of the
regular business schedule today.
   The company said the system was operating normally today as
business hours began, although AT&amp;T did not know exactly what went
wrong Monday.
   ``We're seeing traffic starting to build up and the network is
operating flawlessly,'' spokeswoman Daisy Ottmann said at
mid-morning.
   At the news conference, Allen said the company did not believe
the problem was rooted in a computer virus, but workers were still
investigating that possibility.
   ``It does not act like a computer bug,'' Allen said.
   He said the proposed special discount calling day required
approval from the Federal Communications Commission.
   He said AT&amp;T had no liability insurance for regular
long-distance phone lines, but would be covered for any damages
resulting from loss of business on its toll-free 800 system.
   Ms. Ottmann said the company had recently installed new software
in its system and that the trouble was somewhere within the
software. AT&amp;T removed the new software late Monday, and with it
the problems that plagued the long-distance network.
   The removal of the new software ``didn't take away any
processing power of the network,'' Ms. Ottmann said.
   About half the long-distance callers on the AT&amp;T network got a
busy signal or a recording saying all circuits were busy, the
company said.
   Arizona Telemarketing Inc. of Phoenix, which places 4,000 to
9,000 calls a day, gave its 40 employees an unexpected holiday in
the afternoon.
   ``We had to close the place down,'' said Miriam Benson, company
president.
   Janice Falwin, a Montclair, N.J., graphics designer who relies
on her fax machine to present projects to clients in Los Angeles,
New York and Boston, said the outage caused her to miss a deadline,
and that could cost her $1,000.
   ``Deadlines are my life. If I miss a deadline, I don't eat. The
telephone is like a lifeline to me,'' said Falwin, who works out of
her house.
   On an average business day, 80 million calls go through the AT&amp;T
system, said Sally Sherwood, another AT&amp;T spokeswoman. She said she
did not know how many calls were attempted Monday or how many
actually went through.
   The problem apparently began in one of the company's electronic
switching centers, which transfer calls from one line of the
long-distance network to another, Ms. Ottmann said. It then spread
to the other 100 or so switching centers, she said.
   ``It's like striking the church bell in a steeple and all the
other bells resonate _ this is a vibrating or resonating problem,''
she said.
   AT&amp;T controls about 70 percent of the long-distance market. Its
major competitors, MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint, reported
no problems.
   AT&amp;T customers are able to use the MCI and Sprint systems by
dialing special access codes. However, AT&amp;T operators were
forbidden, even when asked, to give out this information for
competitive reasons, Ms. Sherwood said.
   Ms. Sherwood said experts from Bell Laboratories, AT&amp;T's
research arm, assisted in fixing the problem at the company's
Network Operations Center in Bedminster, N.J., the hub of its phone
system.
   ``Certainly `intense' would an accurate description of the
activity,'' she said.
   A technician at the operations center who spoke on condition of
anonymity described the scene to The New York Times as ``chaotic
and almost out of control'' as engineers worked on the problem.
   Past problems have been limited to a certain region.
   AT&amp;T began installing the electronic call-switching gear in
1987, Ms. Sherwood said.
   ``Nothing like this has happened before,'' she said.
   The company said the problem affected all its phone lines,
including toll-free 800 numbers and overseas calls, except for
private lines that companies lease between their offices or plants.
Some calls were deliberately blocked by AT&amp;T to enable it to
isolate the problem, it said.
   Hotel and airline reservations offices were among hard hit
businesses.
   Cindy Sheffield, phone systems manager for the Marriott hotels
reservation office in Omaha, Neb., said the problem was
``devastating'' because her office wasn't receiving calls from
customers. The office received only 10 percent of its normal call
volume, she said.
   American Airlines spokeswoman Mary O'Neill in Fort Worth, Texas,
said the carrier was experiencing about two-thirds fewer calls than
normal on its reservation lines.
   Trans Mid-America, an Omaha-based marketing company that sells
temporary motor vehicle licenses, couldn't make any long distance
or 800-number calls, said Florence Waymire, a company vice
president.
   ``We're dead in the water here today,'' she said.

   The dollar closed higher against all major
currencies except the West German mark in European trading Tuesday
while gold prices also advanced.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar opened on a strong note
because of the political tensions in the Soviet Union, but trading
turned choppy in the afternoon.
   The mark has benefited the most from the upheavals in Eastern
Europe as investors looked forward to large-scale increases in West
German trade and investment.
   However, the latest turmoil, with riots in the Caucasus and
rising unrest in East Berlin, persuaded investors to sell marks and
buy dollars.
   The dollar faltered against the West German currency Tuesday
when it reached 1.7125 marks. It eventually closed at 1.6945 marks,
down from 1.6965 late Monday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6560 late Tuesday, compared
to late Monday's $1.6620.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.5160 Swiss francs, up from 1.5120; 5.7635
French francs, up from 5.7625; 1.9195 Dutch guilders, up from
1.9015; 1,261.50 Italian lire, up from 1,261.375; and 1.1648
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1622.
   Earlier in Tokyo the dollar rose to 145.75 Japanese yen from the
late London price of 145.50 yen on Monday when Tokyo markets were
closed. In London, the dollar was unchanged against the yen.
   Gold bullion prices moved higher and dealers said concern about
declines on world stock markets had raised investor interest in
gold.
   Gold closed in London, the major market, at a bid price of
$413.25 a troy ounce, up from $412 late Monday, and in Zurich at
$413 bid, up from $412.40.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid of $415.45, up from
$413.95.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $5.25 a troy
ounce, up from $5.24.

   Soybean futures prices tumbled Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade as reports of rain in key growing areas
drove buyers from the market.
   Grain futures closed mostly lower.
   The soybean market opened lower following reports of rain
overnight in southern Brazil, a major soybean-producing region that
had been suffering from unusually dry weather until last weekend.
   Rain also fell overnight and Tuesday in the U.S. corn and
soybean belt, spurring selling of futures contracts, especially
those for delivery of soybeans next fall.
   Although the U.S. planting season is still months away,
``there's all this apprehension'' about this year's soybean crop,
said analyst Pat O'Connell of Refco Inc. in Chicago.
   ``People are trying to crunch the numbers, trying to figure out
how many bean acres we have,'' he said.
   At the close, soybean futures were 4 cents to 8 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in January at $5.60 a bushel and the
November contract at $6.04 a bushel.
   Wheat futures closed 1 cent to 1} cents lower with March at

   Blue-chip issues pulled out of their recent
nosedive, but the rest of the stock market continued to slump on
Wall Street today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 91.30 points over
the last two sessions, recovered 3.84 to 2,673.21 by 3 p.m. in New

   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 5 among New

527 unchanged.
   Analysts said the blue chips benefited from ``bargain hunting''

   Many other stocks, however, remained under pressure amid
recession fears and worries prompted by weakness in the Japanese
stock market.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 666.41 points, or 1.8

   The U.S. banking giant Citicorp said Tuesday that
it will cut 215 jobs in a retructuring of its money-losing Citicorp
Scrimgeour Vickers equities unit.
   Citicorp said up to 140 employees will be laid off while another
75 are being transferred within the organization, which will be
integrated more closely with Citicorp's pan-European capital
markets group.
   Another major investment firm, County Natwest Securities Ltd.,
said earlier Tuesday it will prune 79 jobs in its London equities
unit in a move designed to eliminate overstaffing resulting from
the 1988 merger with Wood Mackenzie Ltd.
   Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers will be left with a total of 110

would cease to deal in fixed income securities, equities and
related products. Anticipating Europe's anticipated removal of
trade barriers among European nations in 1992, Citibank said that
these activities would be better dealt with on a pan-European basis.
   Meanwhile, the on-going equities business will be built around
what the bank called profitable areas, continental European
equities, British growth companies and British and continental
related products.
   Previously, the company made markets in 250 of the largest
stocks on London's Stock Exchange. Now, it on will only deal in
about 100 stocks which it classifies as growth companies.
   Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers lost $65 million during 1989, its
parent said.

<HEAD>Hilton Profit Down In Quarter, Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hilton Hotels Corp. profits fell 24
percent in the fourth quarter and 16 percent for the year, largely
because of poor returns from Nevada casinos, the hotel-casino
concern announced Tuesday.
   In the October-December quarter, net income totaled $26.9
million, or 55 cents per share, down from $35.2 million, or 73
cents per share, in 1988. Revenue rose 2 percent, to $259.6 million
from $254.4 million.
   Hotels income increased 5 percent in the fourth quarter to $36
million, while gambling income fell 28 percent to $20.7 million,
the company said.
   Nevada operations suffered from a low win percentage in the
casinos, ongoing construction on the Las Vegas Strip and start-up
costs at new theme casinos next to the chain's Flamingo hotels in
Las Vegas and Reno, said Hilton Chairman Barron Hilton, son of
founder Conrad Hilton.
   Hilton put itself on the auction block last summer after
settling a dispute over Conrad Hilton's estate and the stock soared
to $115.50 a share on reports of interested buyers. At that time,
some analysts estimated the likely price at $120 per share, and
possibly as much as $140.
   Annual net income was $110.1 million, or $2.27 per share,
compared with $130.9 million, or $2.72 per share, in fiscal 1988.
Revenue for fiscal 1989 rose 5 percent, to $998.2 million from
$953.6 million.
   The 1989 results include a $2.4 million after-tax loss from a
property transaction, which knocked 5 cents per share off earnings,
Hilton said.

<TEXT>
   The number of working U.S. oil and gas rigs
dropped by 10 in the latest week to total 1,019, marking the fourth
straight week the count has declined, Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   The latest rig count remains above the 840 rigs posted a year
earlier, the company reported Monday. The number of rigs dropped by
a total of 50 in the three previous weeks after increasing by 21
the week before.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rotary rigs actively
exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the number of
producing wells.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among the major oil producing states, Texas posted the biggest
gain with nine. Other states recording increases were Pennsylvania,
three; Colorado, two; and Oklahoma and Wyoming, one each.
   California and Louisiana had the largest decline with five each
followed by Kansas and North Dakota, three each; and Michigan and
New Mexico, two each. Ohio remained unchanged from last week.

<DATELINE>EVENDALE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. said Tuesday a
partnership it is organizing will spend about $2 billion during the
next five years to develop a cleaner, more fuel-efficient and
quieter long-range engine for commercial jetliners.
   The company says the GE90, designed for long-range widebody
jets, would cost $10 million per unit, according to Brian H. Rowe,
senior vice president of GE's Aircraft Engines division, based in
this Cincinnati suburb.
   The company envisions a potential $50 billion worldwide market
for the engine.
   Rowe said the engine could reduce fuel consumption by about 10
percent. He estimated a widebody jetliner using two of the engines
could save about 400,000 gallons of fuel a year.
   General Electric hopes the GE90 would reduce emissions by 30
percent from long-range engines now used, Rowe said.
   He also said the engine would be designed to meet more stringent
Federal Aviation Administration noise-reduction standards.
   Rowe acknowledged that GE's major competitors _ the Pratt &amp;
Whitney division of United Technologies Corp. and Britain's Rolls
Royce _ are developing rival engines. Rowe said he hopes GE can
land at least 30 percent of the global market with the GE90.
   The GE90 is to be designed for Boeing's planned 767X twin-engine
widebody jet, being marketed but not yet in commercial service. GE
also is looking for other markets and is talking with jet makers
McDonnell Douglas and the French producer Airbus Industrie, Rowe
said at a news conference.
   ``Our main emphasis at this time is to get the engine launched
on the 767X,'' Rowe said. ``But if somebody else comes along with a
new application, we'll be very happy.''
   The French manufacturer SNECMA, a 50-50 partner with General
Electric during the past decade in the CFM International joint
engine-making venture, is expected to be a 25 percent partner in
the GE90 project, Rowe said.
   The engines would be produced in France and the United States.
Paris-based SNECMA, under its current CFM International operation
with GE, produces some CFM engines at a plant in Villaroche,
France. Other CFM engines are made at GE's Evendale plant.
   General Electric also hopes MTU, a manufacturer based in Munich,
will be a partner. That is subject to approval by MTU's board of
directors, Rowe said.
   Rowe said GE expects that Swedish automaker Volvo and the
Italian automaker Fiat will produce parts for the GE90. Both
companies have produced parts for other GE engines.
   Other partners may enter the project as well, GE officials said.
   Some of the GE90 parts are likely to be produced at GE's plant
in Lynn, Mass., Rowe said.
   He said the company will spend the next six months lining up its
partners and getting the research program established. Developing
and testing the engine could take five years.
   GE hopes to obtain commercial certification of the engine in May
1994 and enter it in commercial service in 1995.
   The engine will provide 75,000 to 95,000 pounds of thrust. GE's
current CF6 engine used in long-range flight develops power of
52,500 to 75,000 pounds of thrust, GE spokesman Dwight Weber said.

   Cray Research Inc. will reorganize its
1,000-member field staff to separate sales and service functions
and make prices more uniform, the supercomputer maker announced
Tuesday.
   The move is not expected to have a ``significant'' financial
impact and it won't significantly alter the number of jobs within
the organization, said Ed Masi, senior vice president of marketing.
   But company spokesman John Swenson said there is a chance Cray
would close or change its regional offices in San Ramon, Calif.,
Houston, Tex., and Calverton, Md. ``They may or may not go away,''
Swenson said.
   Under the new system, the 1,000-member field staff will be
headed by Mike Wilhelm, previously general manager for the
company's western region. Wilhelm will be based in Minneapolis. The
sales effort will be divided East and West and all service
activities will be brought together, the company said.
   Cray's field employees have had joint responsibility for service
and sales, but those jobs will be separated under the new system,
Swenson said.
   The move also is designed to bring uniformity to prices. Under
the old system, equipment and service prices could vary depending
on region.

   The Big Three automakers got off to an upbeat
start for 1990, selling 26.4 percent more U.S.-built cars and light
trucks in early January than in the same period last year, the
companies said Tuesday.
   Truck sales rose 25.5 percent for General Motors Corp., Chrysler
Corp. and Ford Motor Co., and car sales increased by 27.1 percent.
   The Big Three said they sold cars and light trucks at a daily
rate of 30,844 during the Jan. 1-10 period this year, compared with
a rate of 24,393 during the same time last year.
   Chrysler's car sales rose 14.4 percent in early January from the
same period last year, while truck sales jumped 43.7 percent from
last year's early January figures.
   Automotive industry analysts said Chrysler's gain in the truck
market this period shows the automaker's incentive program on
minivans has boosted consumer interest in the vehicles.
   One reason for the higher sales overall was unusually low sales
in January 1989, which followed a December 1988 buying rush.
Consumers hoping to take advantage of incentive packages that
expired at the end of 1988 boosted December sales and that
contributed to the January 1989 slump.
   GM's car sales increased 40.4 percent in early January and truck
sales rose 28.4 percent over 1989's first reporting period.
   Ford said its sales rose 15.4 percent for cars and 10.9 percent
for trucks in early January, compared with same period last year.

<HEAD>Intel Says Profit Up in Fourth Quarter, Down in Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intel Corp., Silicon Valley's leading
vendor of microcomputer chips, on Tuesday reported a 43 percent
jump in fourth-quarter earnings but said its profit for all of 1989
fell 13.7 percent partly due to the cost of closing two of its
oldest plants.
   Last year's profit deterioration was caused in part by writeoffs
connected to the closure of a Santa Clara fabrication plant and
another decade-old facility in Livermore, said company spokeswoman
Pamela Pollace. Intel will focus fabrication operations on its
newer facilities in Arizona, New Mexico and Arizona, she said.
   Another factor contributing to the decline was the dissolution
of Intel's joint computer venture with Siemens, called BiiN, after
Intel decided the company would take too long to turn a profit,
Pollace said.
   Net income for the fourth quarter of 1989 increased to $123
million, or 64 cents per share, from $86 million, or 46 cents per
share, during the same period in 1988.
   For the year ended Dec. 30, 1989, net income totaled $391
million, or $2.07 per share, a drop from the $453 million, or $2.51
per share, reported in 1988.
   Fourth-quarter revenue increased 16 percent from the previous
quarter to $895 million. The surge was a 23 percent increase from
$727 million recorded during the same period in 1988, the previous
company record, Pollace said.
   Revenue for 1989 set a record increasing 9 percent to $3.1
billion, from $2.9 billion for 1988.
   She attributed the increased revenue to higher demand for
Intel's high performance chips, including the ultra-fast i960C
chip, the fastest 32-bit processor to date when it was announced
with much fanfare last August.
   She said the decrease in profits overall was not affected by
Intel's decision to halt production of a brand new super-charged
computer chip, the i486, which the company found had trouble
carrying out certain mathematical calculations.
   Intel last year introduced three new microprocessors, including
the i960C and the i860 64-bit microprocessor for supercomputing
applications, the world's first one-million transistor
microprocessor.
   Intel, which has been shifting production to newer plants in
other states, is building a new $400 million facility in Dublin,
Ireland.
   The company said the high cost of housing in the San Francisco
Bay area is one reason it decided to close its two plants in the
region.

   Grand Metropolitan PLC, a British food and liquor
giant, said Tuesday its International Distillers and Vintners unit
will buy a 49 percent stake in the French liquor company Remy
Martin et Cie SA and a 19 percent holding in Cointreau et Cie SA.
   Grand Met is buying the stakes from the Max Cointreau family.
The remaining stakes in the companies are held by Cointreau family
members.
   The price tag is under 140 million pounds, or $231 million, said
a Grand Met spokesman, who asked not to be identified.
   Last November, Remy and Cointreau linked up to create a wines
and spirits group with combined revenue of around 6 billion French
francs, or $1 billion. The companies specialize in cognac,
champagne and Cointreau.
   The Grand Met spokesman said the two companies are combining and
the final size of Grand Met's stake in the combination is yet to be
determined.
   International Distillers and Vintners has a distribution
agreement with Cointreau in Europe.

   The stock market pulled out of its recent slide
Tuesday with an afternoon rally spearheaded by blue-chip issues.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 91.30 points in

   Officials of Nike Inc. said they have agreed to
remove Marv Albert, Dick Enberg and Al Michaels from a commercial
scheduled to run during the Super Bowl because of pressure from
CBS, which doesn't want rival announcers on the air during its
telecast.
   Tom Clarke, Nike's vice president and director of marketing, and
Scott Bedbury, director of advertising, said Monday that the shoe
company would tape three more announcers and that the spot, titled
``The Announcers,'' would be revised.
   ``We are a major advertiser and we don't want to be in an
adversarial relationship with a major network,'' Clark said.
   Sandy Genelius, a spokeswoman for CBS, said the network would
make no comment on the matter.
   The original commercial, the start of Nike's new campaign, uses
announcers Pat Summerall, Tom Heinsohn, Tony Trabert and Ben Wright
of CBS; Enberg and Albert of NBC; Michaels of ABC; Dick Vitale of
ABC and ESPN; Harry Caray of WGN in Chicago; and Don Cherry of CBC
in Canada. A copy of the commercial with the original announcers
was made available to reporters by Nike on Monday night.
   According to officials at CBS and NBC, who spoke on the
condition that they not be identified, Enberg, Albert and Michaels
were being removed because the public recognizes them as announcers
who compete against CBS.
   ``They only wanted CBS announcers in it,'' said Albert.
``Obviously, on the spots that will be on NBC and ABC, we'll be
back in. It's surprising. I think it's looking at things a little
closely.''
   The NBC official pointed out that NBC runs commercials with
Summerall and John Madden, the CBS team that will broadcast the
Super Bowl.

   Security Pacific Corp. said Tuesday that
Chairman Richard J. Flamson III has been replaced as chief
executive by Robert H. Smith, his expected successor.
   Flamson, 60, said he would continue to serve as chairman of the
board of the nation's fourth-largest banking company. Smith, 54,
former president and chief executive of Security Pacific Bank,
becomes president and CEO of the parent company and chairman of the
bank.
   Commenting on his decision to step down as chief executive
before reaching the company's retirement age of 65, Flamson said
the change had been contemplated for some time.
   ``We all believe Bob Smith and his team are well-equipped to
provide the leadership needed for Security Pacific as we move into
the new decade,'' he said.
   In Flamson's 11 years as chief executive, Security Pacific grew
from assets of $21.6 billion and stockholders' equity of $920
million to assets of $84 billion and stockholders' equity of $4.6
billion.
   During that time, the company developed into a complicated and
profitable financial services company, including recent alliances
with Japan's giant Mitsui Bank. Security Pacific became a leader in
investment banking, and additional alliances with companies,
particularly Asian ones, are expected.
   Smith, who joined Security Pacific as a trainee 28 years ago,
has spent most of his time in Security Pacific's huge retail system.

<TEXT>
   Unrest in the Soviet Union, Japan's weakening yen
and a decline in the New York market have combined to help send
prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plunging from recent record
highs, analysts said Tuesday.
   Renewed buying interest is not likely before national elections
in February clear up political uncertainties, they said.
   The Nikkei Stock Average on 225 selected issues fell 666.41
points, or 1.8 percent, on Tuesday, after a fall of 653.36 points
last Friday. Markets were closed Monday for a national holiday.
   These were the worst one-day plunges since 731.91 points on Oct.
19, 1987, when the Black Monday crash on Wall Street sent stock
prices around the world plummeting.
   Tuesday's close of 36,850.36 was the lowest since 36,881.53 last
Nov. 27.
   The Nikkei average had ended 1989 trading with four consecutive
days of record high closes. So far this year, it has lost nearly
2,000 points, or 6.8 percent.
   ``Share prices were lifted artificially at the end of last year
as institutional investors, especially foreign securities firms,
bought up Nikkei index-related shares in exchange for Nikkei
futures in program trading,'' said Keiichi Nishida, a dealer at
Kidder Peabody Securities.
   ``As a result, the Nikkei index soared regardless of the market
environment, and since the beginning of the year, those
index-related shares are being sold off, depressing the index,'' he
said.
   Dealers blamed the dive of the last two days partly on falling
government bond prices, caused by the weakening yen.
   But on Tuesday, there was a ``combination of unfavorable factors
hitting the market all at once,'' said Ichitaro Watanabe, a dealer
at Nikko Securities Co.
   On top of the bond and yen worries and the index's decline
during the year's first two weeks, ``over the weekend, the regional
conflict worsened in the Soviet Union and the New York market fared
poorly overnight, aggravating the market's pessimism,'' Nishida
said.
   Dealers said the fall in bond prices is likely to stop soon
because yields are approaching the appropriate level, around 7
percent, but a recovery in stock prices is unlikely before the
February elections.
   ``Right now, market players see no encouraging sign to buy
issues,'' said Yoshiro Inoue, an analyst at Nomura Securities.
   Dealers said most private and institutional investors are
waiting to see whether the elections leave the pro-business Liberal
Democratic Party still in control of the government.
   The party, in power since its formation in 1955, lost its
majority in Parliament's upper house for the first time in
elections last July as voters showed displeasure over a new sales
tax and sex and money scandals.
   The February elections are for the more powerful lower house,
which chooses the prime minister and decides the budget. The LDP's
standing in opinion polls has improved since last summer, but
uncertainties remain.
   ``The unrest in the Soviet Union was also a severe blow to the
stock market,'' said Watanabe.
   He said the wave of democratic movements in Eastern Europe last
year pushed up prices of shares in trading companies, expected to
benefit from expanded Japan-East European trade.
   ``Hardly any new money is coming into the market,'' Watanabe
added. ``It it clear by looking at the volume traded on the
exchange.''
   Volume traded Tuesday on the first section of the exchange,
where most major shares are listed, was estimated at 450 million
shares.
   The dollar closed Tuesday at 145.75 yen, up 2.35 yen from its
1989 year-end close of 143.40 yen despite recent Japanese central
bank intervention in support of the yen. The Soviet unrest and
Japan's political uncertainty also have been seen as factors
boosting the dollar.

<HEAD>Widely Varying Earnings Performance Reported by Leading Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Five big banks reported sharply mixed results for the 1989
fourth quarter and year Tuesday, reflecting strength in their
corporate and consumer finance businesses and weakness caused by
shaky real estate loans and Third World debt.
   Severe quarterly declines were reported by Citicorp,
Manufacturers Hanover Corp., and Mellon Bank Corp., while Security
Pacific Corp. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. reported big earnings increases.
   New York-based Citicorp, the nation's biggest banking company,
said it lost $784 million or $2.52 a share in the quarter ended
Dec. 31, vs. earnings of $747 million or $2.19 a share a year
earlier.
   The bank attributed the drop largely to a $1 billion increase in
its provision for possibly bad loans to developing countries, as
well as a $68 million cost to restructure unprofitable operations
in Britain. Citicorp said strong earnings from its gloabal consumer
business offset weakness elsewhere.
   For the year, Citicorp earned $498 million or $1.16 a share,
down 73 percent from $1.86 billion or $5.36 a share earned in 1988.
   New York-based Manufacturers Hanover, the sixth-largest U.S.
banking company, earned $62 million or 82 cents a share in the
fourth quarter, down 70.5 percent from $210 million or $4 a share a
year earlier. Part of the decline reflected costs from a previously
reported fraud at its Geneva branch.
   For 1989, Manufacturers Hanover lost $518 million or $10.21 a
share, reflecting an increase of $1.1 billion to loan-loss reserves
for Third World debt. In 1988 the bank earned $952 million or
$18.27 a share.
   Pittsburgh-based Mellon said fourth-quarter earnings plunged
nearly 88 percent in the fourth quarter to $6 million, which after
payment of preferred dividends meant a loss of 20 cents a share. A
year earlier the bank earned $48 million or $1.02 a share. Mellon
attribued the decline to the addition of $100 million to its
reserves to cover possibly bad Third World loans.
   For the year, the 17th largest U.S. banking company earned $181
million or $3.33 a share, rebounding from a loss of $65 million or
$3.65 a share in 1988, when the bank had fewer shares outstanding.
   The bank said the improvement resulted from significantly lower
operating expenses, as well as increases in service fee revenue and
other revenue.
   Security Pacific of Los Angeles, the fifth largest U.S. banking
company, earned $191.7 million or $1.59 a share in the fourth
quarter, up 13 percent from the $169.5 million or $1.46 a share
reported a year earlier. The bank said strong growth in its
California and Washington businesses and financial service
operations offset big losses in Arizona real estate.
   For the year, Security Pacific earned a record $740.6 million or
$6.26 a share, up 16 percent from the $638.9 million or $5.59 a
share earned in 1988.
   San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, the 11th largest banking
company, said fourth quarter earnings rose 17 percent to $158.5
million or $2.95 a share, vs. $136 million or $2.45 a share a year
earlier. The bank said the improvement stemmed largely from
increases in domestic loans.
   For the year, Wells Fargo earned $601.1 million or $11.02 a
share, up 17.3 percent from $512.5 million or $9.20 a share in 1988.

<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices ended mixed Tuesday, with
crude and gasoline posting gains while spring-like weather in the
Northeast dried up buying enthusiasm in the heating oil pits.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the major U.S. grade of crude oil, rose 42
cents to close at $22.78 per 42-gallon barrel. Tuesday's gains
follow a 77-cent loss on Monday. Crude contracts for delivery
through August also advanced.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline staged a broad-based advance, with
the February contract gaining 0.71 cent to 64.30 cents a gallon
after dropping 1.50 cents in the previous session. The March
contract increased 0.78 cent to 63.82 cents a gallon.
   Meanwhile, heating oil prices slid further after a brief rally
fizzled. The February contract for No. 2 heating oil fell 0.57 cent
to 64.03 cents a gallon after tumbling 5.05 cents on Monday. Other
contract months closed mixed.
   Analysts said warm weather in the Northeast continued to
pressure heating oil prices.
   ``With warm weather, who wants heating oil?'' asked Madison
Galbraith, energy specialist with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   Traders said news of a strike by a majority of workers at
Petrobras, Brazil's state-owned oil company, boosted gasoline
prices and helped pull crude higher. Brazil ships up to 1.4 million
barrels of gasoline to the United States per month and a strike
could effectively cut into shipments, analysts said.
   Brazil's refineries were reported to be operating but at a lower
capacity after the strike began.
   Buying ahead of the American Petroleum Institute's weekly
inventory report also helped support gasoline prices, said Linda
Simard, energy broker for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.

   The dollar was mixed in lackluster trading
Tuesday amid few developments to affect the currency markets.
   Gold prices were also mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New
York, a troy ounce of gold fell $2.90 to $410.80. Republic National
Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $409.80, down $5 from late
Monday's bid.
   Foreign exchange analysts said the dollar fluctuated during the
day on largely technical factors.
   The dollar was steadied by rising interest rates in the bond
market and from uncertainty about the political situation in the
Soviet Union, said Jack Barbanel, president of First Global Asset
Management Inc.
   Higher interest rates in this country make the dollar a more
attractive investment for foreigners, and the dollar also gains
from overseas political problems because investors consider it a
safe investment.
   The yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose to 8.24
percent Tuesday from late Friday's 8.17 percent. The government
bond market was closed Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr.
holiday.
   Meanwhile, rioting between Armenians and Azerbaijanis continued
in the Caucasus region of the Soviet Union.
   The dollar gained against the British pound. In New York, one
pound cost $1.6585 late Tuesday, compared with late Monday's
$1.6630. In earlier London trading, sterling fell to $1.6560 from
$1.6620 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.6950 West German marks, down from 1.6967;
1.5116 Swiss francs, up from 1.5110; 5.7630 French francs, down
from 5.7635; 1,262.25 Italian lire, up from 1,261.625; and 1.16375
Canadian dollars, down from 1.16575.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.6945 West German marks, down from 1.6965;
1.5160 Swiss francs, up from 1.5120; 5.7635 French francs, up from
5.7625; 1.9195 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9015; 1,261.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,261.375; and 1.1648 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1622.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 145.75 Japanese yen from the late
London price of 145.50 yen on Monday, when Tokyo markets were
closed for a holiday. In London, the dollar was unchanged against
the yen, and in New York, the U.S. currency fell to 145.30 yen from
late Monday's 145.55 yen.
   Gold bullion prices moved higher overseas, before slipping in
New York.
   Gold closed in London, the major overseas market, at a bid of
$413.25 a troy ounce, up from $412 late Monday. It rose in Zurich
to $413 from $412.40.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid of $415.45, up from
late Monday's $413.95.
   Silver was also mixed. It fell 1.2 cents on the Commodity
Exchange to $5.230 a troy ounce after rising 1 cent in London to a
bid $5.25.

<HEAD>TWA Sells 11 Jets to Raise Cash, Reduce Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trans World Airlines Inc. has sold 11
jumbo jets for $210 million to two leasing companies in an effort
to raise cash and reduce its large debt, company officials said
Tuesday.
   It's the second time in less than a month that the airline has
announced the sale of assets. On Dec. 18, TWA said it planned to
sell its Chicago-London route and related assets to American
Airlines for $195 million. That deal must be approved by the
federal government.
   The news has angered many employees who believe TWA owner Carl
Icahn is slowly dismantling the airline, which is $2.7 billion in
debt and lags behind other major carriers in capital investment.
   But industry analysts say selling airplanes and leasing them
back from the leasing companies is quite common.
   ``Most airlines are doing it to raise cash and take advantage of
high values for aircraft right now,'' said Paul Turk, an analyst
with Avmark Inc., an aviation consulting firm in Arlington, Va.
   But with only 74 of its 213 aircraft owned outright, TWA has one
of the lowest ownership percentages in the industry, Turk said.
   TWA spokesman Don Morrison said the airline will use half of the
$210 million from the sale of eight Lockheed L1011s and three
Boeing 747s to boost its cash reserves to nearly $1 billion.
   The airline will use the other half of the proceeds to trim its
$2.7 billion in long-term debt, Morrison said.
   TWA sold the eight Lockheed jets to Potomac Leasing Inc. It sold
the Boeing jets to a unit of American Express Co.
   Icahn has assured employees, in a letter last month, that he
does not intend to dismantle TWA.

<HEAD>Orange Juice Futures Soar On Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Orange juice futures prices rose sharply Tuesday following a
report that Brazil expects to export about 450,000 metric tons of
frozen concentrate to the United States this year, an amount that
might not meet U.S. demand.
   On other commodity markets, soybean futures fell sharply; energy
futures were broadly mixed; precious metals slipped; and livestock
and meat futures were mixed.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures rose 2 cents to 4.35
cents on the New York Cotton Exchange with the contract for
delivery in January at $1.9525 a troy ounce.
   Futures prices have shot up about 70 cents a pound since a
Christmastime freeze that destroyed an estimated 30 percent of
Florida's orange crop, and the market is ``on a collision course''
with the all-time high spot price of $2.05, said analyst Judy Ganes
of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   U.S. processors have been counting on Brazilian imports to make
up any supply shortfall caused by the freeze. Brazilian citrus
officials reportedly said Tuesday that they were prepared to meet
America's needs.
   But the amount of prospective exports to the United States
reportedly mentioned by Umberto Marconi, administrative director of
the Brazilian Association of Citrus Juice Industries, would still
leave U.S. consumers thirsting for orange juice, Ms. Ganes said.
   The prospective Brazilian exports of 450,000 metric tons of
concentrate would translate into 155 million gallons of juice.
   ``Based on my calculations, we need to import about 200 million
gallons overall this year to overcome the shortfall from the
freeze,'' Ms. Ganes said. ``That puts us about 45 million gallons
short.''
   She said that between its 1989-90 harvest and its 1990-91 crop,
Brazil should be able to meet America's needs, ``but we're at their
mercy.''
   Soybean futures tumbled on the Chicago Board of Trade as reports
of rain in key growing areas washed buyers from the market.
   Grain futures closed mostly lower.
   The soybean market opened lower following reports of rain
overnight in southern Brazil, a major soybean-producing region that
had been suffering from unusually dry weather until recently.
   Rain also fell overnight and Tuesday in the U.S. corn and
soybean belt, spurring selling of futures contracts, especially
those for delivery of soybeans next fall.
   Soybean futures settled 6 cents to 11 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in January at $5.58 a bushel and the November
contract at $6.01{ a bushel.
   Wheat futures were 1\ cents to 2{ cents lower with March at
$3.98\ a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1\ cents lower with March at
$2.42{ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1\ cents lower with March at
$1.42\ a bushel.
   Gasoline and near-month crude oil contracts made strong gains on
the New York Mercantile Exchange amid supply fears linked to an oil
workers strike in Brazil.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents lower to 42
cents higher with February at $22.78 a barrel; heating oil was 1.19
cents lower to .44 cent higher with February at 64.03 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was .55 cent to .84 cent higher with
February at 64.30 cents a gallon.
   Precious metal futures slumped on New York's Commodity Exchange
in response to the stronger dollar and stronger stock market, which
overshadowed such positive signals for the gold market as higher
spot crude-oil prices and unrest in the Soviet Union.
   Gold futures finished $2.70 to $2.90 lower with February at
$412.20 a troy ounce; silver was 1.2 cents to 1.6 cents lower with
March at $5.285 a troy ounce.
   Livestock futures finished mostly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, with some of the selling attributed to
positioning ahead of next week's quarterly Agriculture Department
cattle-on-feed report.
   Pork bellies advanced in technically-inspired trading.
   Live cattle futures settled .20 cent lower to .33 cent higher
with February at 77.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent
to .30 cent lower with January at 83.32 cents a pound; live hogs
were .60 cent lower to .05 cent higher with February at 49.70 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .10 cent lower to .40 cent higher
with February at 55.62 cents a pound.

   Mandatory random testing for drugs and alcohol
went into effect Tuesday for the 90,000 men and women who operate
the nation's railroads.
   Testing began one year after drug abuse was singled out as a
factor in a 1987 Amtrak-Conrail crash near Baltimore that killed 16
people and injured 175.
   The testing program, delayed because a lengthy series of court
battles between the government and railroad unions, requires that
at least 25 percent of railroad engineers, brakemen, dispatchers,
signalmen, conductors and all other railroad employees directly
involved in the movement of trains be subjected to random testing
this year.
   A full 50 percent of the operations personnel of the nation's
largest railroads must be tested by the end of 1991 for the
presence of alcohol and such drugs as marijuana, cocaine, opiates,
amphetamines, and phencyclidine, also known as PCP.
   But Claire Austin, a public affairs officer for the Federal
Railroad Administration, said federal officials expect as many as
40 percent of those affected by the new requirement to be tested by
the end of this year alone.
   She said railroad administrators expect results will show that
drugs are a far more serious problem among rail workers than is
alcohol.
   ``It is very evident to us that drugs are the problem rather
than alcohol,'' she said, pointing to the results of post-accident
drug and alcohol testing, a requirement since 1986.
   In that year, 738 people were tested with 27 testing positive
for drugs and seven for alcohol. In 1987, 770 persons were tested
with 39 testing positive for drugs and just three testing positive
for alcohol. In 1988, 682 people were tested with three testing
positive for alcohol and 39 testing positive for drugs.
   Of 21 railroad accidents linked to drugs or alcohol last year,
14 were drug-related while alcohol was involved in seven of the
incidents.
   The National Transportation Safety Board found in 1988 that
marijuana use was a factor in the Jan. 4, 1987, accident at Chase,
Md., which left 191 people dead or injured.
   The board said drug impairment caused Conrail engineer Ricky
Gates to speed through several warning systems and into the path of
an Amtrak train.
   The presence of marijuana was found in blood and urine samples
taken from Gates. He was later convicted of manslaughter and
sentenced to five years in prison after admitting he smoked
marijuana and violated several safety procedures.
   The board said the effects of the drug caused Gates not to
notice warning signals both inside the engine's cab and suspended
over the tracks until it was too late to make a safe stop.
   At the time of the safety board's findings, John Riley, the
federal railroad administrator, said it was clear a random drug
testing program was needed.
   ``It is not enough to simply talk about the impact marijuana use
had on this accident,'' Riley said at the time. ``If we don't do
something to prevent it from happening again _ I mean authorized
random testing _ then the lives lost at Chase may well have been
lost in vain.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nations from the East and West nations took the
first step Tuesday toward creating an East European development
bank that one official said could be working by the end of the year.
   Delegations from 34 countries, including the United States and
Soviet Union, ended their first meeting by appointing experts to
work out specific plans for the proposed European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development in Eastern Europe, said Jacques
Attali, France's presidential adviser on economic affairs.
   ``We need to be generous, but also to help these countries learn
what they need to learn to transform them into market economies,''
said Attali, who had presided at the two-day meeting.
   Attali said three groups of experts would begin work and report
their progress at a second session scheduled for Paris on Jan. 30.
He said a drafting session would be held in Paris March 10-11 after
which delegations hopefully would be able to sign an agreement.
   The plan reasonably might be ratified and the bank established
and operating some time this year, Attali said.
   Some countries, particularly the United States, have expressed
concern about the role of the Soviet Union in the bank, both as
participant in the capital and eventually even a borrower. Attali
said the issue would be addressed during negotiations over the
draft plan.
   Disagreements among representatives generally were minor and
would not stop eventual approval of the bank, Attali said,
describing the meeting's atmosphere as constructive.
   French President Francois Mitterrand proposed creation of the
bank during a European Parliament session Oct. 25 as a way to help
East European countries, which have removed their hard-line
Communist leaders in the past year.
   The money will be used for loans for projects in Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania _
countries already burdened by foreign debts totaling more than $100
billion.
   The idea was endorsed in December at the summit of the 12
European Community countries, which proposed a plan for the bank.
   Delegations on Tuesday proposed several amendments to the EC
plan. Using the amendments, France will draw up a new proposal to
be presented at the Jan. 30 session, Attali said.
   Attali listed seven issues the working groups would address:
   _ The mission of the bank and whether it should fund only
private sector projects or include the public sector. This is a
particular concern of the United States.
   _ The conditions under which the new bank's money will be lent,
whether at current market rates, or in some other way.
   _ Criteria for eligibility to borrow from the bank, whether
those criteria will be based on the state of economic reforms in
any individual East European country.
   _ The amount of capital with which to found the bank. Attali
said the current thinking is about $12 billion, but no firm figure
has been reached.
   _ The breakdown of capital participation by each country. Attali
said the question had not been studied, but no one had rejected the
idea of the European Community holding a majority stake.
   _ The bank's method of operation, who will run it, who will be
its directors and officers.
   _ Where the headquarters will be located. Attali indicated there
was no shortage of candidates, but refused to reveal them.
   The conference participants were all 12 EC members: France, West
Germany, Britain, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands,
Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark and Greece; six members of the
European Free Trade Association: Austria, Switzerland, Finland,
Sweden, Norway and Iceland; and the United States, Canada, Japan,
Australia, New Zealand, Turkey, Cyprus, Malta, the Soviet Union,
Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland
and Romania.

<TEXT>
   Bankruptcy filings released Tuesday provided a
6,000-page look at the crushing debts plaguing Campeau Corp.'s
department stores, listing billions of dollars owed to 50,750
creditors ranging from Wall Street bankers to underwear makers.
   The bankruptcy petition by Campeau divisions Federated
Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., listed $9.1 billion
in total assets and $7.7 billion in total liabilities.
   Toronto-based Campeau, the real estate company that bought
Federated and Allied with borrowed money in the 1980s, placed them
under bankruptcy court protection Monday because of the debt burden.
   The divisions will reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Federal
Bankruptcy Act, which gives them a reprieve from creditors while
they devise a way to repay them and stay in business. Campeau made
the filing in Cincinnati, where its most important U.S. retailing
operations are based.
   The 6,000-page filing, half of it a list of creditors, was made
available for the first time Tuesday by the bankruptcy court, where
lawyers, accountants and creditor representatives scrambled to make
copies on two machines.
   The biggest listed creditors were mostly banks and Wall Street
investment firms, some of which played roles in helping Campeau
expand into a retailing giant. However, while some listed as
creditors owned the bonds, others were only holding them in trust
for investors.
   The creditor list ranged from First Boston Corp., holder of
$428.8 million in Federated debt securities, to a $96,074 bill owed
to the Hanes hosiery maker by Lazarus department stores, a
Federated subsidiary.
   Campeau's U.S. holding company also announced G. William Miller,
64, a former Treasury secretary and Federal Reserve chairman, is
the company's new chairman and chief executive officer. Miller also
is a former Federated executive.
   The U.S. unit also changed its name from Campeau Corp. (U.S.)
Inc. to Federated Stores Inc.
   Miller said holders of bonds Campeau sold to finance its
takeover of Allied in 1986 and purchase of Federated in 1988 should
expect to take losses.
   ``They bought speculative securities, and they had high interest
rates which were compensation,'' Miller said on NBC's ``Today''
show. ``I think the marketplace has already reflected in the
discounts at which they are selling the fact that they probably
will not be paid in full.''
   Jack Cowell, a managing director for First Boston, called
Federated's figure on the debt to the investment bank ``vastly
inflated.'' He said First Boston bought many of the bonds at lower
market prices and that First Boston had invested $75 million to
$100 million in Federated bonds.
   Cowell said that despite marking down the bonds' values at the
end of 1989, the Wall Street firm had a profitable year in bond
trading.
   Damage to reputations could be more costly in the long run than
money losses for companies that invested in Campeau's debt-financed
takeovers, said Perrin Long, an analyst for Lipper Analytical
Securities Corp. in New York.
   ``You don't want to associate with banks that had a failure in
that respect in the past,'' Long said.
   The Northern Trust Company, which Allied listed as its sixth
largest creditor, said in Chicago the company holds Allied bonds
for clients and had none of its own. The trust company said outside
advisers had recommended the purchase of the bonds.
   The filing was the largest under Chapter 11 by an American
retailer, affecting about 100,000 employees and 258 stores in the
United States. It also was the second-largest ever by a
non-financial company after Texaco Inc., which sought court
protection in April 1987.
   Harvey Miller, a New York bankruptcy lawyer who represented
Texaco, indicated that the size of Campeau's filing and the large
part of the company's debt that is in junk bonds will lead
creditors to create new legal arguments to pursue repayment.
   He said creditors who don't qualify for repayment ``will try to
come up with some sort of leverage device, whether they call it
fraud ... or something else.''
   Campeau also announced other changes involving senior management
at its U.S. operations.
   Ronald W. Tysoe, currently president of both Campeau Corp. and
Campeau (U.S.), will continue as president of the newly renamed
Federated holding company, but he will phase out his
responsibilities at the Canadian parent.
   John W. Burden III, chairman and chief executive officer of
Federated and Allied, has quit effective Jan. 31 ``to pursue other
interests,'' Campeau said. The company said it expects to announce
a successor soon to run the retailing operations.
   James M. Zimmerman will remain as president and chief operating
officer of Federated and Allied. The management teams at all
department store chains will continue in place.
   Chapter 11 grants the companies a reprieve from creditors'
lawsuits while they formulate a plan to repay their debts. All
financial decisions for the companies must now be approved by U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug. He declined to comment on the case.
   Federated's stores include Abraham and Straus and Bloomingdale's
of New York, Burdine's of Miami, Lazarus of Cincinnati and Rich's
of Atlanta.
   Allied's stores include The Bon Marche of Seattle, Jordan Marsh
of Boston, Maas Brothers of Tampa and Stern's of Paramus, N.J.

<HEAD>Fuji Proposes Buyout of Subaru of America</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., which owns 49.6
percent of Subaru of America Inc.'s outstanding shares, proposed
Monday to buy the remaining stock for $6 a share, or $147 million.
   Subaru of America has a total of about 48.5 million outstanding
shares of common stock, and the $6 a share offer would value the
entire company at about $291 million.
   Some traders expect the bidding may go higher. Subaru stock rose
$1 a share to $6.12{ per share Tuesday in national over-the-counter
trading.
   ``We believe that our proposed cash price is fair to Subaru of
America's shareholders, especially in light of the uncertain
outlook for the U.S. automobile industry,'' Fuji Heavy Chairman
Toshiro Tajima said.
   ``Only by controlling 100 percent of Subaru of America will we
be in a position to effectively integrate the manufacturing and
distribution process which, we believe, is critical to the growing
demands of our U.S. dealer network and the interests of our
customers,'' he said.
   Subaru of America, headquartered in Cherry Hill, N.J., operates
an assembly plant jointly with Isuzu in Lafayette, Ind., which Fuji
Heavy officials said would benefit from the merger.
   ``I think the transaction will affect the Indiana plant
positively. We hope to increase the manufacturing of cars and that
would provide more jobs for the American people,'' said Dairoku
Hosoki, director and general manager of Fuji Heavy.
   Officials at Subaru-Isuzu Automotive Inc. refused to comment on
the proposal, spokeswoman Chris Miller said.
   Negotiations on the merger are expected to take a minimum of
three months, said Peter Rona, president and chief executive
officer of IBJ Shroeder Bank &amp; Trust Co. of New York.
   The proposed cash merger is between Subaru and a wholly owned
Fuji subsidiary. Fuji is one of Japan's largest manufacturers of
transportation equipment, including Subaru cars. In fiscal 1989,
auto exports to North America accounted for nearly 30 percent of
Fuji's total revenues.
   Fuji sales for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1989, were more
than $5 billion.

   Singapore Airlines said Tuesday it has placed
orders and options for 50 aircraft from Boeing Co. and McDonnell
Douglas Corp., and valued the proposed purchases including engines
and spares at $8.6 billion.
   The airline plans to buy 30 747-400 aircraft from Boeing and 20
MD-11s from McDonnell Douglas, the company said in a statement.
   It said it ordered 15 aircraft and an option for 15 more from
Boeing, and ordered 5 aircraft and an option for 15 others from
McDonnell.
   Total cost of the purchase including engines and spares is $8.6
billion, the airline said. The aircraft are scheduled to be
delivered between 1994 and 1999.
   Singapore Airlines is evaluating engines to power the aircraft,
the airline said in a statement without giving details. Three
companies, for example, make engines for the 747-400, including
Pratt &amp; Whitney, Rolls Royce and General Electric Co.
   ``Singapore Airlines should be able to fully finance the
purchase, but it may take advantage of available financing ... that
can reduce the cost of aquisition,'' the airline said.
   The statement said Singapore Airlines plans to grow at an
average rate of 8 percent a year in the 1990's.

<HEAD>Aristech Chairman Launches Bid for Company</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of Aristech Chemical Corp. and a
Japanese trading company launched a $900 million takeover bid
Tuesday for the chemical manufacturer as the company reported a
sharp drop in earnings.
   A management group led by Chairman Thomas Marshall in
association with Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Corp. offered $26 per share
of outstanding stock at the company's board meeting, Aristech said
in a statement.
   About 34.6 million shares of stock were outstanding at the end
of 1989, said company spokesman David Higie. That would make the
offer worth about $899.6 million.
   Aristech stock jumped $5.50 Tuesday in trading on the New York
Stock Exchange to close at $24.62{.
   Marshall said commitments for financing were arranged by
Mitsubishi, according to Aristech.
   The board appointed a committee to evaluate the proposal, which
expires at the close of business next Tuesday. It is subject to
completion of definitive agreements and approval of the board.
   ``It's a friendly effort,'' said Peter Rosenthal, a Mitsubishi
spokesman. ``Aristech and Mitsubishi are working together jointly
to accomplish this transaction.''
   Rosenthal said that under the deal Mitsubishi would be a joint
owner of Aristech, but he declined to elaborate.
   ``It's a strategic investment. They believe they can bring their
expertise and know-how to bear for the benefit of the company,'' he
said.
   Mitsubishi invests in a broad range of companies around the
world.
   Pittsburgh-based Aristech said its fourth-quarter profit totaled
$15.1 million, or 43 cents a share, on revenue of $222.6 million.
That compares with a profit of $34.9 million, or 97 cents a share,
on revenue of $258.5 million during the same period in the previous
year.
   The profit for all of 1989 fell to $82.1 million, or $2.36 per
share, on revenue of $996.4 million. That compares with 1988
earnings of $188.2 million, or $5.04 per share, on revenue of $1.07
billion.
   Marshall said price drops for polypropylene were a major factor
in the reduced revenue and operating income in 1989. Polypropylene,
a thermoplastic resin, is one of Aristech's major products.
   Major expenses for maintenance and expansions at Aristech plants
during the year also decreased operating income, he said.
   ``All things considered, 1989 was a good year, with a return on
equity of 20 percent and a healthy balance sheet,'' he said.
   USX Corp. sold Aristech to the unit's managers in 1986. The
company employs about 1,800 people at 10 plants in eight states,
Higie said.
   Utah industrialist Jon M. Huntsman launched an unsuccessful
takeover bid for the company in last fall. The board rejected the
$25-per-share offer Nov. 28.

   Hasbro Inc. plans to sell a plant in
Lancaster, Pa., to Bulova Systems and Instruments Corp. and move
the plant's toy production to plants in Rhode Island and
Massachusetts, the company announced Tuesday.
   Terms of the sale were not disclosed.
   Hasbro said it plans to end manufacturing at the plant in late
March or early April and to close it by June 30. The plant employs
about 750 people.
   Production of Playskool toys will shift to existing Hasbro
plants in Pawtucket and Central Falls, R.I., and in East
Longmeadow, Mass., the company said.
   Bulova said it will consolidate its Lancaster operations at the
plant and also will move operations from Freeport, N.Y., to the
plant.
   Hasbro acquired the plant four years ago when it bought the
assets of the CBS Toy Division. At the time, Hasbro thought it
would need the additional manufacturing capacity ``and that didn't
really materialize,'' said Wayne Charness, a spokesman.
   Hasbro is developing severance packages for salaried employees
of the plant and will negotiate with the Glass, Molders, Pottery,
Plastics and Allied Workers union for a similar package for hourly
employees, the company said.
   Hasbro, which had 1988 revenues of nearly $1.36 billion,
manufactures toys and games under the trade names Playskool, Milton
Bradley and Hasbro.

<TEXT>
   A young entrepreneur who sought control of
Bond Corp. Holdings Inc. without explaining how he would finance
his $197 million bid or deal with the Australian conglomerate's
immense debt said Tuesday he had abandoned his offer.
   The statement from Jeff H. Reynolds came five days after Bond,
the brewing and media company controlled by millionaire Alan Bond,
said Reynolds did not appear to have the capacity to undertake the
deal.
   Bond had said earlier it was willing to talk to Reynolds.
   Beginning with a news release issued Jan. 5, Reynolds said he
was negotiating to take over Bond through his Weatherby Investments
Inc. and its parent, Singapore-based California Pacific
International Holdings Co. Pte Ltd.
   Newspapers and news agencies worldwide ran stories on his
friendly offer to save Bond, which was near collapse under a nearly
$6 billion load of debt and related legal problems.
   Reynolds, a 28-year-old Texan operating out of his mother's
house in Houston, claimed he had lined up the $197 million and was
negotiating financing to service Bond's debt.
   But checks by The Associated Press showed that Weatherby, once
run by Reynolds' father, lost its corporate charter in Nevada in
1987 after failing to file its annual list of officers. The younger
Reynolds was never listed as an officer or director of Weatherby.
   The address Reynolds gave for investors was a mail drop in
Beverly Hills. He refused to reveal the location in Century City
from which he said his associates were operating, and he never
revealed his source of funds.
   He described the lapsed corporate license as a ``screw up'' by
his staff or attorneys, and even said he might undertake a hostile
bid for Bond after the company rejected his offer last week.
   On Tuesday, he issued another news release saying his companies
were ``withdrawing from negotiations'' with Bond Corp., mainly
because of the Australian company's legal and financial problems.
   Last Thursday, Bond Corp. released a statement from its
headquarters in Perth, Western Australia, saying it had been unable
to obtain information about the proposed cash offer. It said
Reynolds' bid was doubtful and causing the company ``considerable
embarrassment.''
   ``It was made very clear to Mr. Reynolds and his associates
right from the very beginning that there would be no discussions
until Bond Corp. was satisfied that Mr. Reynolds and-or his
companies have the financial capacity to undertake a transaction of
the size and nature he proposes,'' Bond Corp. spokesman Peter Lucas
said.
   ``In the absence of any such information having been made
available so far, despite repeated requests, we are taking the view
at this time that he does not have that capacity,'' Bond's
statement read.
   Reynolds on Tuesday maintained his offer had been real.
   ``There's not much to say'' to detractors, Reynolds said. ``I
don't think it's worthy of a response.''

   The Supreme Court, in one of two suits arising
from strikes against airlines, refused Tuesday to allow a
machinists union walkout at Eastern Airlines spread to commuter
railroads.
   The court also refused to revive a suit brought by Trans World
Airlines flight attendants, who accused TWA owner Carl Icahn of sex
bias in seeking wage cuts and other concessions that triggered a
1986 strike.
   The court's ruling in the Eastern case resolved a question left
by the walkout by the International Association of Machinists that
began more than 10 months ago.
   The justices, without comment, left intact lower court decisions
barring sympathy strikes against railroads in New York City,
Philadelphia and their suburbs.
   The machinists, who walked off the job last March 4 after
refusing to give more than $150 million in concessions sought by
Eastern, remain on strike. Pilots and flight attendants supported
the strike for eight months before ending their walkouts in
November.
   The machinists and unions sympathetic to the Eastern strike
sought to extend its impact by setting up picket lines at
facilities run by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority in the Philadelphia area and by Amtrak, the Long Island
Railroad, Metro-North Commuter Railroad and NJ Transit Rail in the
New York City metropolitan area.
   Federal judges barred the secondary strikes, and the restraining
orders were upheld by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals and the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
   In the TWA case, the flight attendants had sought back pay and
other benefits from the airline.
   The Independent Federation of Flight Attendants called a strike
against TWA on March 7, 1986. Two months later, the union offered
to return to work and accept TWA's demands.
   The strike was called when Icahn insisted on wage and other
concessions for attendants _ 85 percent of them women _ that were
greater than cuts he sought to impose against the airline's pilots,
machinists and other workers.
   During the negotiations with the attendants union, Icahn said it
would be easy for him to find young, untrained women to be
stewardesses for less than he was paying the attendants.
   When union negotiators said janitors who belonged to the
machinists union were offered a better deal than the attendants,
Icahn remarked:
   ``A janitor is a breadwinner (who) probably has got a family at
home to support (while) you girls are second incomes and you don't
need the money.''
   The union said the statement demonstrated bias against women and
violated fair bargaining procedures mandated by the federal Railway
Labor Act, which governs labor negotiations for airlines and
railroads.
   U.S. District Judge Howard F. Sachs in Missouri rejected the
union's claims that Icahn was guilty of sexual stereotyping.
   Icahn's ``breadwinner'' remarks were ``foolish and offensive,''
Sachs said. But he said Icahn apparently was trying to rationalize
his negotiating strategy of demanding more cuts from the attendants.
   The judge said the real reason Icahn made a more generous offer
to the machinists was because that union could ``do greater damage
to TWA in a strike'' and because Icahn believed it would be easier
to replace the attendants with untrained workers.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judge's ruling
dismissing the case last June.
   In other business-related cases Tuesday, the court:
   _ Said it would consider limiting the power of environmentalists
to prevent the opening up of federal lands to commercial
development.
   _ Agreed to a request by 34 states that it consider broadening
their power to sue gas producers and pipelines on behalf of
consumers allegedly overcharged as a result of ilegal price-fixing.
   _ Left intact a ruling that cities may fine cable television
companies for failing to broadcast enough locally originated
programs.
   _ Agreed to decide whether non-profit social clubs that are
generally exempt from federal income taxes can use losses incurred
from selling food and drink to non-members to offset investment
profits.
   _ Let stand a ruling that a state may ban pharmacists from
selling prescription drugs at a discount.
   _ Blocked the effect of a lower court ruling that could have
provided natural gas consumers with tens of millions of dollars in
refunds. The justices are to hear a formal appeal by 21 energy
companies in the case, in which a lower court invalidated a federal
regulation that allowed gas producers to raise some prices.
   The court also heard arguments Tuesday in the California
attorney general's attempt to break up the $2.5 billion merger of
Lucky Stores Inc. and American Stores Co.
   California officials asked the court to allow states and private
citizens to use federal antitrust law to stop corporate mergers.
   The attorney general's office argued that the Clayton Act,
passed in 1914 when Congress was preoccupied with trust busting on
a national scale, empowers the state to challenge the merger.
   Less competition in the industry, leading to higher grocery
bills for consumers, will result from the merger, said Deputy
California Attorney General H. Chester Horn Jr.
   Rex E. Lee, representing the supermarket chains, said only the
federal government is empowered by the 1914 law to force
divestiture in a completed merger.
   Lucky operated California's largest supermarket chain, and
American, the fourth largest.
   American acquired Lucky in June 1988 to merge the two chainsder
the Lucky name. The company has 550 stores in California.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. has ordered its divisions to
cut or delay media advertising spending by 25 percent as the
company continues to cut costs, according to a report published
Tuesday.
   The Detroit News said it obtained an internal memo ordering each
GM division to cut or defer media spending in the first six months
of this year.
   Spokesman Terry Sullivan confirmed the memo Tuesday. He said he
had no details on specific cuts and there was no firm target for
cuts.
   GM does not disclose its advertising budget.
   Sullivan said GM is scrutinizing all its operating budgets to
see if they can be cut.
   ``I think the key there is the term `cut or `defer,''' he said.
``Defer, it just means hold off spending for a time period and then
see if we really need it and how important it is to us. I mean
everything in general, I don't just mean advertising.
   ``Some of it is a retiming. What it does reflect is increasing
competition within the industry ... and the ongoing need to become
cost competitive.''
   The memo, titled ``1990 Quick Start Program,'' also said GM
would reduce sponsorships in motor sports and related activities by
20 percent, the newspaper said.
   ``We're looking at a lot of things,'' said Phil Guarascio, GM
executive director of advertising. ``I don't think the door is
closed on (cutting) anything.''
   The nation's largest automaker launched a $13-billion
cost-cutting program in 1987 to last several years. As part of that
program, the company last week confirmed cuts that published
reports have put at $1 billion.
   Car sales were slow in 1989, and the Big Three automakers have
shut down or slowed production at 13 U.S. plants this week to
lighten inventories. Incentives launched in 1989 to try to get rid
of slow-selling cars have proven costly.
   GM on Tuesday reported a 40.4-percent increase in car sales and
28.4-percent increase in truck sales for the first 10 days of
January.

<HEAD>Japan to Continue Voluntary Auto Export Restraints</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan will continue to voluntarily restrict exports
of passenger autos to the United States to 2.3 million cars a year
in the coming year, Trade Minister Hikaru Matsunaga said Wednesday.
   The export limit for fiscal 1990, which begins April 1, is the
same as in the current fiscal year, although actual exports are
expected to total only 2 million autos because of increased
production in the United States by Japanese automakers.
   ``Auto exports to the United States in fiscal 1989 are expected
to be down again from the previous year's level,'' Matsunaga said
at a news conference. ``Although we consider this trend of decline
constant, for fiscal 1990 we will keep the previous year's measures
in place to confirm the tendency of decline.''
   The export restraint, which dates from 1981 when the U.S.
government put strong pressure on Japan in order to bolster U.S.
automakers, has been considered obsolete for several years because
Japan's auto shipments have been under the quota.
   But it is still regarded as politically important to keep the
quota in place while Japan and the United States are at loggerheads
over ways to reduce the $50 billion annual surplus Japan runs in
trade between the two countries.
   Wednesday's announcement was virtually identical to the one last
year, when the government said the export restraint should be kept
even though exports to America were declining.
   When the export restraints started, Japanese automakers had a
big price advantage over U.S. manufacturers, but the yen's rise
against the dollar since 1985 has reduced Japan's price advantage.
   Japanese car companies have turned increasingly to making autos
in the United States.

   Georgia-Pacific Corp. on Tuesday began asking
Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. shareholders to cast votes to oust
Great Northern's directors and replace them with a board that
favors Georgia-Pacific's unsolicited $3.8 billion tender offer for
the paper company.
   Meanwhile, a federal judge in Portland, Maine, rejected
Georgia-Pacific's challenge of a provision in Great Northern's
bylaws that is intends to make a hostile takeover of the company
more difficult.
   As Georgia-Pacific began soliciting proxies supporting its
proposals, to be considered at the March 2 meeting in Portland,
Great Northern urged its stockholders to retain its current board.
   Great Northern spokesman Stephen Hill said Tuesday that the
Norwalk, Conn., company is distributing its own proxy statements
that urge shareholders to reject Georgia-Pacific's bid.
   ``They're competing, really,'' Hill said of the proxies.
   Hill said shareholders of record Jan. 12 will be eligible to
vote at the meeting.
   Great Northern claims that Georgia-Pacific's attempt to buy the
competing paper company would violate antitrust laws. Great
Northern also contends Georgia-Pacific would sell Great Northern's
valuable land holdings in Maine if it acquired the company.
   Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific denies both allegations and has
charged that Great Northern's management has resisted the takeover
in an attempt to hold onto their own jobs at the expense of the
shareholders' interests.
   Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. said 75 percent of
Great Northern shares have been tendered under the $63-a-share
offer.
   The two companies also are haggling over how large a vote would
be required to pass any of the proposals.
   Great Northern's articles of incorporation say 75 percent of the
shares must approve the removal of the board. Georgia-Pacific says
the laws of Maine, where Great Northern is incorporated, require
only 66 2-3 percent.
   In U.S. District Court in Portland, Judge Gene Carter on Tuesday
denied Georgia-Pacific's request for injunctive relief against
Great Northern's ``poison pill'' stock purchase plan.
   Carter said Maine law ``specifically allows the corporation to
set the terms and conditions for the exercise of the rights to
purchase stock.''
   Georgia-Pacific's corporate communications manager, Sheila
Weidman, said the company was disappointed by the ruling, but that
it was not unexpected.
   She said that the company is ``pursuing many other avenues'' and
that the ruling ``won't adversely affect the company's ability to
complete the merger.''

   Stock prices recouped more than half the previous
session's sharp losses Wednesday morning while the U.S. dollar fell
slightly.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which shed
666.41 points Tuesday in the biggest one-day point loss in more
than two years, rebounded 360.66 points, or 0.97 percent, to close
the morning session at 37,211.02.
   The index was up some 430 points at one point, responding
favorably to a 23.25-point overnight gain in the Dow Jones
industrial average on Wall Street, before slipping back, dealers
said.
   A recovery in Japanese government bond prices also supported
stocks, dealers said.
   ``The recoveries on Wall Street and bond prices are major
contributing factors for the rise,'' said Hisato Haganuma, an
equity researcher with Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   Dealers have blamed the big slump in stock prices in the past
two weeks on sharp falls in the prices of government bonds, which
drives up interest rates and makes stocks less attractive.
   The Nikkei has lost nearly 2,000 points, or 6.8 percent,
following four consecutive days of record high closings toward the
end of last year.
   The dollar closed the morning session at 145.47 yen, down from
145.75 yen late Tuesday. After opening at 145.40 yen, the currency
ranged between 145.37 yen and 145.48 yen.
   Dealers said trading was generally calm, with many players
waiting for the release of U.S. merchandise trade figures for
November, scheduled for later Wednesday in Washington.
   Some economists predict the figures will show the trade deficit
narrowed to $9.4 billion from $10.2 billion in October.

<HEAD>Accounting Newsletter Can't Print Article About Firm, Judge Says</HEAD>

   Lawyers for a business newsletter said Tuesday
they would fight a court order that halted plans to print a
front-page story containing confidential information about the Big
Six accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young.
   The attorneys said the court ruling amounted to unconstitutional
prior restraint and charged that Ernst &amp; Young made no attempt to
notify newsletter editors that it was seeking the court order.
   ``They received no prior notice,'' James Grossberg, a Washington
attorney who is part of the team representing the newsletter, said
Tuesday. ``That in itself makes this decision blatantly
unconstitutional.''
   Carl Liggio, general counsel for Ernst &amp; Young, told The Atlanta
Constitution, ``If we had notified him, he would have gone to press
and defeated the purpose.''
   Arthur W. Bowman, editor of Bowman's Accounting Report, said he
was served with a temporary restraining order at his home the night
of Jan. 8 _ while the January edition of the newsletter was at the
press _ stopping him from publishing the article.
   The issue was published two days later with a black cover and
the word ``Censored'' printed in bold white letters.
   The order, issued by New York Supreme Court Judge Beatrice
Shainswit, restrains Bowman's Accounting Report from ``using,
referring to, disseminating or in any way disclosing any
confidential and@or proprietary information of Ernst &amp; Young that
has come into (its) possession.''
   ``I've been in the newsletter business a decade and I've never
seen anything like this,'' Bowman said Tuesday.
   The article was to have analyzed last June's merger of Ernst &amp;
Whinney and Arthur Young. Bowman said his newsletter was the first
to break the news of that deal when it reported it in the May 17,
1989, issue.
   Neither the accounting firm nor the newsletter would discuss the
nature of the information in the article. Bowman said Ernst &amp; Young
learned of the planned article when he called the firm to check
some facts.
   Mort Myerson, a spokesman for Ernst &amp; Young, said the issue has
nothing to do with freedom of the press, but centers instead on
privacy.
   ``This is an issue of proprietary, confidential information, not
the First Amendment,'' Myerson said.
   A number of news organizations, including The Associated Press,
The New York Times, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, The Wall
Street Journal, Newsday and the Newsletter Association of America
Tuesday said they would support the newsletter in its attempt to
lift the restraining order.
   A hearing is scheduled Jan. 25 in the Supreme Court of New York
on Bowman's bid to have the order reversed.
