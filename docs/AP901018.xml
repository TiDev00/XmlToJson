<HEAD>City Agrees To Phase Out Use Of Deadly Acid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mobil Oil Corp. agreed Thursday to a
seven-year phaseout of deadly hydrogen flouride at a refinery and a
review by an independent safety advisor.
   The agreement settles a lawsuit by the city that contended use
of the toxic, cloud-forming acid endangered thousands of nearby
residents.
   The case was scheduled to go to trial Nov. 5.
   A trial would have ``shown the world how dangerous (hydrogen
flouride) is and how poorly managed the plant was operated,'' said
City Councilman Dan Walker. ``I think we're going to have to fight
every inch of the way to meet the goals of the settlement.''
   The lawsuit, filed early this year, stems from a November 1987
explosion and fire that ignited when hydrogen flouride overflowed
into a tank and mixed with another chemical.
   The blast caused about $17 million in damage and left four
workers and six bystanders injured.
   Used to manufacture high-octane gasolines, hydrogen flouride
forms a heavy cloud when exposed to open air. City officials feared
an accident or leak at the refinery could send such a cloud
drifting into residential neighborhoods in this Los Angeles coastal
suburb.
   Under the agreement, Mobil would be allowed to develop and use a
derivative of hydrogen flouride that would not form a cloud.
   Refinery Manager Joel Maness said he expected the settlement to
end several years of acrimony between the city and Mobil. He said
he had no concern about permitting an outside inspector to review
the plant's operations.
   ``We feel strongly that we have a safe operation,'' Maness said.
``But I never mind having another set of eyes take a look at our
operations and our procedures.''
   The inspector, who will advise the plant on safety
considerations, will be chosen by joint agreement between Mobil and
the city and bill be paid by the company, court documents said.
   The advisor will report to retired Superior Court Judge Harry V.
Peetris, who will act as an arbitrator of future disputes over the
phaseout program. Peetris will be paid by Mobil.

   Violent storms belted the Eastern Seaboard on Thursday, killing
a farmer in Virginia, injuring at least 50 people in the Baltimore
suburbs, whipping through Newark International Airport and raining
on the halls of Congress.
   Strong winds buffeted the Newark airport and the surrounding New
Jersey neighborhood, injuring several people, breaking windows and
damaging cars.
   A tornado in suburban Baltimore damaged homes and buildings,
leaving 50 to 70 people hurt and cutting power to at least 48,000
utility customers, officials said.
   Russell L. Martin, 73, a farmer in King William County, Va.,
which is about 20 miles northeast of Richmond, was feeding his
cattle when he apparently saw a tornado and ran to his barn for
cover, Sheriff W. Wayne Healy said.
   The tornado struck as Martin tried to squeeze into the barn's
crawl space, shattering the old wooden structure and crushing him,
Healy said.
   Reisterstown, Md., residents said a tornado that touched down
there ripped roofs from houses and a supermarket, overturned cars
and downed power and telephone lines.
   Alverta Payne, 80, of Reisterstown said she escaped her home by
crawling through the wreckage of her third floor.
   ``I didn't hear nothing until the roof was on top of me. All of
a sudden, the whole roof caved in,'' she said.
   Baltimore County officials said 14 ambulances were sent to the
area, which was hit hardest by heavy wind and severe thunderstorms
that raced through around sundown.
   Most of the injuries appeared minor. Seven people were taken to
a Baltimore hospital with undetermined injuries.
   Janet Randall with the Baltimore County Fire Department said an
apartment building roof had collapsed and houses lost their roofs
when they blew off.
   In Newark, witnesses reported seeing a funnel cloud near the
airport. The National Weather Service in Newark said it had no
confirmed reports of a tornado in the area.
   Air traffic was not disrupted. The only reported injuries were
five people hurt when winds overturned a storage trailer near a
taxi area, police said.
   At the Vista Hotel across from the airport, a desk clerk said
workers and guests reported seeing a funnel cloud.
   ``There was a tornado,'' said the clerk, who would not give her
name. ``Windows were blown out, a flagpole fell on some cars in the
parking lot, there was concrete all over.''
   Many guests abandoned their rooms and huddled in the hotel lobby
for safety.
   Tornadoes caught the 420 residents of Remington, Va., by
surprise.
   ``All hell broke loose,'' said Annabelle Edwards, owner of A.W.
Edwards Community Store. ``Everything was flying. It almost took me
out the door.''
   No injuries were reported in Remington.
   Witnesses reported seeing a twister at a shopping mall parking
lot in Monroe, N.C. It left cars in a pile and injured four people
inside the vehicles, officials said.
   ``The only thing I can tell you is that a severe thunderstorm or
small tornado hit and did massive damage in a parking lot,'' said
Kathy Phifer, a county fire department dispatcher.
   ``There was no damage to the buildings but many vehicles are
damaged. They're piled on top of each other,'' she said.
   Officials said three people were treated for ``lumps and bumps
from being knocked around inside their cars'' and released. A
fourth person who suffered bruises was admitted for observation.
   In Washington, driving wind and rain leaked into the Capitol
dome and shredded flags on top of the congressional office
buildings. Water poured onto the rotunda floor from balconies
above. Statues were draped with plastic sheets to protect them from
the deluge.
   Strong winds circumvented flashings and drains on the newly
restored dome and into the building, workers said.
   In the Washington suburb of Silver Spring, Md., an emergency
shelter was opened at a Red Cross building. It wasn't immediately
known how many people, if any, used it.
   ``So far we've found only six houses damaged by fallen trees,''
said police Sgt. Harry Geehreng. ``There have been no injuries.
We've been very lucky, but we still have traffic lights out.''

   Fire engulfed a group home for juveniles,
fatally trapping a house parent and three teen-age boys.
   Fire investigators sifted through the remains of the St.
Lawrence County Social Services Boys Home in search of the fire's
cause, said Norwood Police Chief Dale Wells.
   The fire late Wednesday killed Karen Fullerton, 53; Anthony St.
Louis, 13; Jeremy Kocienski, 14; and Luther Henderson, 16.
   Jim Fullerton, Mrs. Fullerton's husband, and two juveniles
escaped.
   ``It was obvious (the victims) were trying to get out,'' said
Wells. ``The husband and two (police) officers tried to get back
into the house, but the smoke was so thick it drove them back
out.''
   Investigators said the fire apparently started downstairs and
spread through the house.
   Wells said there was no evidence of arson.

of Primakov meeting; SUBS graf 11: ``The Soviet,'' to remove

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
emissary to Iraq on Thursday ruled out any deal with Saddam Hussein
that would reward the Iraqi leader for pulling troops out of
Kuwait.
   Yevgeny Primakov spoke to reporters after reviewing prospects
for a settlement in the Persian Gulf with Secretary of State James
A. Baker III for a half-hour and then, more extensively, with
Dennis B. Ross, head of the State Department's policy planning
staff.
   ``We should look for some possibilities to avoid, from my point
of view, the military clashes, but not reward Iraq, of course, with
its actions,'' Primakov said in halting English before climbing
into a waiting black limousine.
   He turned aside a question on reports he had brought a proposal
from the Iraqi leader for negotiations based on something short of
total withdrawal from Kuwait, which Saddam seized Aug. 2 and then
annexed.
   ``Let me not comment on your very wise question,'' he said.
   However, a U.S. official said later that Primakov had not
presented anything new, ``nothing they had not heard before.''
   Baker reiterated the Bush administration's position that a
partial solution was unacceptable and that Iraq had to withdraw
completely from Kuwait, said the official, who insisted on
anoymity.
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft gave a similar
assessment of what Primakov had to say wbout his talks with Saddam.
Asked by reporters at the state dinner for Hungarian Prime Minister
Jozsef Antall whether Primakov reported showed any signs of Saddam
softening his position, Scowcroft said ``there wasn't really
anything new'' in what Primakov had to say.
   Baker, who broke away from the session with Primakov to fulfill
a scheduled appearance before the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
made no remarks as he posed for pictures with Primakov. The State
Department provided no comments on the meeting.
   ``We had very interesting talks,'' Primakov said. ``It was a
real exchange of views. We do care about the situation - the United
States, the Soviet Union and the world.''
   The Soviet official, who was accompanied by Deputy Foreign
Minister Viktor P. Karpov, then met for a half-hour with Scowcroft.
   A White House official, declining to be identified, said the
meeting was in preparation for talks Primakov will hold with Bush
on Friday.
   The unannounced visit to the State Department revived interest
in hints that the Iraqi leader might withdraw his troops from the
oil-rich monarchy of Kuwait in exchange for a strategic island that
controls access to Iraq's only military port in the Persian Gulf or
for free elections in the emirate and compensation for Iraqi oil
claims.
   The two superpowers are cooperating in efforts to force Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait through economic pressures. But as war talk
mounted, Gorbachev sent Primakov to Baghdad two weeks ago in search
of a political settlement.
   Baker reiterated at a news conference Tuesday the Bush
administration's interest in a peaceful way out of the crisis that
began with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. But Baker also ruled out any
``partial solution,'' saying Saddam should not be enabled to claim
benefits from the takeover of its neighbor.
   On Wednesday, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, Baker encountered growing concern that U.S. troops would
be sent into action against Iraq if the freeze in virtually all
trade authorized two months ago by the United Nations failed to
force an Iraqi pullout from Kuwait.
   A report in The Washington Times, meanwhile, said Gorbachev had
sent a peace plan with Primakov for Bush. The newspaper, quoting
unnamed U.S. officials in Moscow, said the plan calls for free
elections in Kuwait and cash compensation for oil sales Iraq claims
to have lost as a result of overproduction.
   In return, Saddam reportedly is willing to reverse Iraq's
military occupation.
   Bush and Baker have insisted from the outset on unconditional
withdrawal, which would seem to rule out any deal that rewarded the
Iraqi leader.
   While Primakov visited Washington, the U.S. defense secretary,
Dick Cheney, was in Moscow paying calls on the Kremlin's top
military and foreign policy officials. Cheney has met with
Gorbachev, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Defense
Minister Dimitri Yazov.
   Baker cautioned Tuesday that the Soviets may not be supporting
the reported compromises while stressing that Moscow's support for
the economic squeeze on Iraq is solid.
   The coalition organized by the United States to oppose Iraq also
includes a majority of Arab and European countries.

   There is a brief image in the 1963 comedy ``It's
a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'' that endures long after the movie has
faded from memory.
   An airplane in distress approaches a remote airstrip. Panicky
sirens blare and the camera cuts to a slow pan of the emergency
crew. Three men, motionless, deadpan, wait to spring into action:
The Three Stooges.
   Even standing still, expressionless, years past their prime, the
potential havoc those men could wreak was enough to make audiences
laugh helplessly.
   That's why ``Disorder in the Court: A 60th Anniversary Tribute
to the Stooges'' is overdue. If not for the brothers Howard -
Curly, Moe and Shemp - and Larry Fine, the TV generation would not
know what vaudeville was.
   ``I don't think there's anyone who's done physical comedy in the
past 40 years who hasn't been influenced to some extent by the
Stooges,'' said Gary Owens, a lifelong fan.
   Owens, the famed announcer of TV's breakthrough comedy
``Laugh-In,'' is the announcer for the two-hour tribute, syndicated
in 126 markets Oct. 25 through Nov. 11.
   Owens also helped lead the letter-writing campaign that got the
Stooges their sidewalk star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame in 1983.
   ``We always thought the star should have been tilted. ... Then
everybody passing by paying homage to the Stooges would then trip
and fall down and plotz a lot,'' Owens said, ``but the Chamber of
Commerce wouldn't go along.''
   The Three Stooges began in vaudeville, the touring song, dance,
novelty and comedy acts that were the bedrock of American showbiz.
   Shemp was second banana - stooge - to comedian Ted Healy, and
enlisted his brother Moe and violinist Larry Fine into the act.
Their film debut was in 1930.
   Shemp quit the act for a solo film career in 1932 and was
replaced by Moe's younger brother, Jerome, nicknamed Curly. In
1934, Healy was a rising film star. His stooges went out on their
own and signed with Columbia Pictures.
   For 12 years, they made classic two-reel comedies, until illness
forced Curly to retire. Shemp rejoined the act and they continued
making short features for nearly 10 years.
   Curly, the most popular Stooge, died in 1952. Shemp died in 1955
and was replaced by Joe Besser, a longtime bit player with Abbott
and Costello.
   In 1958, Columbia fired the Stooges, but released their 190
two-reelers to television, where they were discovered by the
current generation of television writers.
   Joe DeRita replaced Besser for a series of forgettable
feature-length comedies. The last of them, ``The Outlaws is
Coming'' was released in 1965.
   Moe and Larry died in 1975, and DeRita is the sole surviving
Stooge.
   ``Disorder in the Court'' does a fine job at presenting the
trivial factoids that will delight the serious Stoogeophile
(Stoogist? Stoogian?).
   In addition to clips of classic Stooge shtick, it has home
movies, old kinescope footage of early television appearances and a
television pilot never before broadcast.
   There's also thorough discussion of the Stooges' slapstick sound
effects. Crushing walnuts make a nose-wrench, a ukelele pluck makes
a nose-tweak, while a poke in the eye requires a violin pluck.
   The mechanics of the eye poke (you aim for the forehead) and the
slap (keep the fingers loose) are thoroughly demystified with
slow-motion photography.
   And there's a nice bit with Emil Sitka, the dyspeptic looking,
quavery-voiced character actor who made 28 comedy shorts with the
Stooges.
   Unfortunately, the producers took what would have been a tight,
entertaining hour and padded it to two hours.
   There are several pointless appearances by comedians who add
nothing to the program, including the otherwise funny Wil Shriner,
who drives around Hollywood indicating where once stood the
vanished landmarks of the Stooges.
   Serious Stooge fans will be irritated by the inclusion of ``The
Curly Shuffle'' a 1984 music video of old footage and a mediocre
song.
   Purists will be horrified by the program's finale, the first
colorized Stooges short, 1949's ``Malice in the Palace.'' It is far
from their best work, cut down to 15 minutes and interrupted twice
by commercials. This is shabby treatment of the Stooges and their
director, Jules White, a master of monochrome.
   This tribute to the Stooges is strongest where it shows us
stoogery that we haven't seen before, where the writers let their
admiration for the Stooges shine through.
   It is weakest - painfully lame, in fact - where it tries to be
funny without its subject.
   Nobody will ever confuse the Stooges' work with High Art. It is
broad, violent lowbrow, physical comedy of incompetence.
   But they did it soooooooo well!

   Filmmaker Philip Kaufman met Henry Miller only
once, when he and his wife showed up unannounced at Miller's
hideaway in Big Sur 30 years ago and spent the day with the author.
   But that brief encounter fueled a lifetime of fascination with
Miller that has culminated in a new movie about his years as a
struggling writer and his relationship with Anais Nin.
   Kaufman's obsession with Miller was so great that he even
credits Miller with his decision to drop out of Harvard Law School
after a year and become a filmmaker.
   ``He filled me with a sense of adventure,'' said Kaufman, 53, a
slender, soft-spoken, youthful-looking man, during a recent
interview in his New York hotel room. ``He was writing about
self-liberation, and he liberated me.''
   Kaufman's film, ``Henry and June,'' seeks to liberate audiences
as well. The movie details Miller's early years in Paris with his
wife, June, and the relationship the couple developed with Nin, who
was also married at the time. The film, replete with fairly
explicit sex scenes, explores both the affair between Miller and
Nin and their mutual attraction to June.
   In an ironic twist, given that Miller's books were banned in
English-speaking countries for 27 years, ``Henry and June,'' led to
the eradication of the X rating in the United States. The new NC-17
rating, meaning no children under 17 will be admitted, will be
assigned to certain adult films instead, including ``Henry and
June.''
   It came as a great relief to Kaufman, the critically acclaimed
director of ``The Right Stuff'' and ``The Unbearable Lightness of
Being,'' who was prepared for a lengthy fight to avoid an X rating
and keep certain scenes intact.
   The movie took three years to make. Kaufman collaborated with
his wife of 31 years, Rose, in writing the screenplay, based on
Nin's long-suppressed diaries and Miller's novels. Their only
child, Peter, 30, produced the film.
   Fred Ward and Maria de Medeiros play Miller and Nin. Uma Thurman
portrays Henry's wife, June, described by Nin as ``the most
beautiful woman on earth.'' She served as muse for both of them,
though she never thought either writer would be successful.
   Just as Kaufman saw Miller's writing as an act of rebellion
against ``the stultifying America'' of the 1930s, he sees his own
film as an antidote to the inhibited sexuality of today's society.
   ``I still see people motivated by greed and avarice,'' said
Kaufman. ``AIDS has scared people about sex. It's repressed them.''
   Miller was just the opposite, Kaufman said. ``He combined
sexuality with his love of literature. To him, it was all part of
the positive life force. He seemed to live life to its fullest; he
was aware of all its sensations, and its power.''
   That philosophy was one shared by Anais Nin, at least during her
affair with Miller. To Kaufman, ``Henry and June'' is about three
people who act out universal impulses.
   ``In fact, as in real life, most people want everything,'' he
said. ``All forms of sexuality are complex. June's relationship
with Anais is very complex. We're never clear about just what
June's sexuality is. The mystery of women is a mystery even to men.
It's easily thrown into an area called lesbianism, but it's more
complicated.''
   Kaufman deliberately did not make his film a morality play.
Though Miller, Nin and June pushed the envelope of relationships
with their bizarre triangle, it did not end in tragedy.
   ``It's a question play,'' he said. ``It ends in questions. Each
scene is meant to be another part of the puzzle.''
   Though Kaufman clearly admires Miller and Nin, his own life is
anything but similar. He has enjoyed a long and happy marriage with
his wife. They live a quiet life in San Francisco.
   Kaufman said he has been haunted by Miller all his life. In
1958, while exploring a cave with other tourists in South Dakota,
he met a man who told him he knew where Miller lived. Kaufman and a
friend eventually made their way to Big Sur, but decided not to
bother Miller when they saw a sign up near his Big Sur home,
pleading for privacy.
   Two years later, Kaufman brought his wife to the same location
and the two asked Miller's neighbor to introduce them. They spent
the day with Miller and slept on the beach at night.
   ``Henry was close to 70,'' Kaufman recalled. ``He was wearing
jeans, which was pretty unusual for someone that age then. He was
very serene, he looked like a Zen Buddhist monk. We talked about
Russia, about literature, and he showed us different trees. We
drank some warm gin. He seemed happy. He seemed like a man always
trying to keep his spirits up.''

   What does the commander of U.S. forces in
the Persian Gulf do when his spirits dip?
   He rereads a letter from a 10-year-old Texas girl who recovered
from a serious heart defect and told him ``to make sure that your
soldiers don't give up no matter how hard things get.''
   In an interview published today in the Rosslyn-based USA TODAY,
Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf said that ``every now and then even my
morale gets down.''
   For a boost, Schwarzkopf reads the letter he received from
Andrea Turnbough. Her teacher at Roberts Elementary School in El
Paso assigned her fifth-grade class to write to soldiers in Saudi
Arabia.
   Andrea wrote:
   ``Most of the adults who know me say that I never give up. When
I was little I had a serious heart problem.
   ``After lots of surgery I got better. It seems to me that your
job is to make sure that your soldiers don't give up no matter how
hard things get.
   ``People like you and me know how important that is.
   ``Good luck. Sincerely, your friend Andrea.
   ``P.S. I live in the desert all the time. It's not so bad.''
   In his reply, Schwarzkopf told Andrea her letter ``was beautiful
and it truly touched my heart. It also provided me with just the
inspiration I needed to try a little harder to take care of my
troops.''
   He also said he was happy she got better after her surgery.
   ``I am sure one reason why you got better is because you never
gave up. But I also know the reason why the doctors were able to
fix your heart was because you have a beautiful heart.''
   In a postscript, he added, ``You're right. The desert is not so
bad. My troops have already learned to deal with its problems.''

   Participants in a bitter miners' strike
that divided a town along racial lines and gained international
attention during the McCarthy era gather this weekend to
commemorate the events 40 years ago.
   The Empire Zinc strike, and the making of an award-winning movie
about the walkout, ``Salt of the Earth,'' were played out against a
backdrop of Congressional witch hunts for Communists in the
government, the labor movement and the film industry.
   Mexican-American miners from Local 890 of the United Mine, Mill
and Smelter Workers quietly went on strike against the zinc mine in
a remote corner of southwestern New Mexico in 1950.
   The labor dispute, New Mexico's longest and one of its most
bitter, drew national attention when it was kept alive midway by
miners' wives, mothers, sisters and children who took over picket
lines and withstood tear gas, beatings and jail.
   And before it was over, Hollywood filmmakers blacklisted because
of the McCarthy era ``red scare'' were on location in the mining
town of Hanover, making a movie about the 15-month walkout.
   ``We made history all over the world,'' said Virginia Chacon,
66, who still lives in the area.
   She was a member of the union's Ladies Auxiliary 209, which took
over the picket line aftr the men were served with a court
injunction threatening them with arrest if they blocked the road to
the mine.
   Her husband, longtime union leader Juan Chacon, who died in 1985
at age 66, played the role of Ramon Quintero, the movie's male
lead.
   The workers were fighting segregation at the mine, which placed
Hispanic workers in underground, lower-paid jobs, and left surface
work in the mill and shop for Anglos. The policy extended to the
company-owned houses.
   ``People should be reminded that it was a good and a hard
struggle, not only for Grant County workers and labor people, but
all over the world,'' Mrs. Chacon said.
   The reunion will include a showing Friday night of the
full-length, black-and-white film - now considered a classic - at a
hall named for her husband at Western New Mexico University in
Silver City.
   The film, finished in 1954 despite pressure to stop production
from forces as disparate as local vigilantes and Howard Hughes, was
a joint production of the miners' union and the blacklisted
filmmakers.
   It won several international awards, but pressure on theater
owners by the Communist-hunting followers of Sen. Joseph McCarthy
kept it out of most American movie houses, said producer Paul
Jarrico, 75, of Santa Monica, Calif.
   ``Ultimately, of a possible 13,000, it played 13 theaters,'' he
said. ``And of the 13, seven were theaters that we had rented
ourselves.''
   But, it still may have been seen by more people than any other
film, Jarrico said cryptically, ``because it was the only American
film playing in China for 15 years.''
   The movie group chose Local 890's battle for its subject because
``we wanted to make a film that would have real content and the
kind of content that we'd never really been able to express as
Hollywood filmmakers,'' Jarrico said.
   And, ``we'd already been punished (by the blacklist), so we
wanted to commit a crime to fit the punishment.''
   The movie, which explored issues of racial discrimination and
women's equality, was denounced in Congress as a ``new weapon for
Russia.''
   The film's director was the late Herbert Biberman, who was one
of the Hollywood 10 imprisoned for refusing to testify before the
House Un-American Activities Committee.
   For the miners of Grant County, the strike and the worldwide
attention the film created were well worth the battle.
   Although many original demands were lost when the 32 miners
remaining on strike signed the contract that ended the walkout,
striker Lorenzo Torrez said the agreement strengthened the union.
   Within a few years of the strike's end, company housing was
integrated, Hispanic miners had equal access to jobs, and the
mine's safety record was one of the best in the region, said
Torrez, 63, who continued to work at the mine until it was closed
in 1970.
   ``The strike solidified the voice of the union and gave a
political voice to Mexicanos, so political offices were open to
them for the first time,'' he said.

   While Congress stays pinned to the floor in its wrestling match
with the federal budget, some of the nation's largest cities are
grappling with their own fiscal crises.
   In New York, Philadelphia, Washington and elsewhere, costly
social problems and a slumping national economy have conspired to
plunder municipal budgets. Cities are slashing services, raising
taxes and laying off workers to do what the federal government
can't seem to accomplish - balance their budgets.
   Not all cities are hurting. Seattle and Denver are thriving,
Houston is rising from an economic abyss and Dallas gets high marks
for steering its budget along the black line of solvency.
   But some strains are universal. Drugs, homelessness and AIDS are
costly burdens for nearly every city. Insurance is ever more
expensive. And while some urban economies are still booming, most
are beginning to feel the effects of a national economic slowdown.
   ``I think all cities are experiencing financial crunches to
different degrees,'' said Lance Simmens, assistant executive
director of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, which represents cities
with populations of more than 30,000.
   ``Most cities are facing problems that didn't exist in 1980.
AIDS. Crack cocaine. The infrastructure has endured years of
neglect, and that's starting to take its toll,'' he said.
   Simmens added there are ``strains being experienced from the
federal disinvestment, from the social problems, from the
restrictions on the ability to issue tax-exempt debt (and) the
beginnings of an economic downturn in many areas of the country.''
   The National League of Cities surveyed 576 communities about
their budgets earlier this year. Two-thirds reported they were less
able to meet their financial needs than the year before.
   ``There's quite a lot of stress to cities of all sizes,'' league
spokesman Randy Arndt said.
   Philadelphia is the nation's leading economic basket case. The
nation's fifth largest city expects to go broke sometime early in
December unless it can plug a $206 million hole in its budget.
   ``If Philadelphia has even a temporary period without sufficient
cash, the result will be a legal, political and public safety
nightmare,'' the city's finance director, Betsy C. Reveal, told
Mayor W. Wilson Goode in a recent memo.
   Standard &amp; Poors Corp. recently downgraded Philadelphia's
general obligation bond rating to junk bond status - CCC.
   No other major city has such a poor bond rating; Detroit comes
closest with a BBB.
   New York could become the next big city to see its bond rating
fall. Standard &amp; Poors recently announced the nation's largest city
was under a ``credit watch,'' a warning to shape up or slip down in
the credit rankings. Its current ranking was A minus.
   Lower credit ratings make it more costly for financially
strapped cities to borrow.
   New York Mayor David Dinkins announced plans Tuesday for $1.3
billion in budget cuts that will dig deeply into nearly every type
of city service except police and jails. Dinkins wants to raise
taxes to pay for them.
   Public concern about crime is at a peak, and cities are loathe
to cut money for police. ``That's why you have to find cuts
elsewhere,'' said Hyman C. Grossman, Standard &amp; Poors' managing
director of municipal finance.
   So residents of fiscally troubled big cities can expect shorter
library hours, less frequent garbage pickup, shabbier streets and
parks and less reliable transit.
   Miami recently eliminated grants to cultural groups, street
festivals, exile groups and charities. The Miami Film Festival lost
$100,000, or 25 percent of its cash budget.
   Officials of Toledo, Ohio, announced plans to limit garbage
pickups to once every two weeks, and to slash most recreation
programs. San Francisco cut public health funds and AIDS programs,
and doubled some city fees.
   Budget troubles cut across regional lines, but most analysts
agree the problems are most acute in the Northeast.
   ``The Midwest ... seems to be perhaps not quite as stricken by
some of these events ... as some other regions, particularly the
Northeast,'' said Arndt of the League of Cities. ``The contortions
and strains that the Midwest went through earlier in the 1980s have
made them perhaps more resilient.''
   No city knows more about fiscal failure than Cleveland, which
defaulted in 1978. Cleveland has since regained relative financ the budget
Mayor Michael White submitted to the City
Council last month showed a potential $25 million deficit.
   ``People get angry when wial
health, bute say this is happening, but I feel we
are in the beginning phase of a recession,'' said James Rokakis,
chairman of Cleveland's City Council Finance Committee.
   Still, Rokakis said, Cleveland has learned its lesson.
   ``Our fiscal house is at least in order. We're not mixing bond
funds and such as we did in the 1970s. We may be broke, but at
least we know why we're broke.''

<HEAD>Anne Frank Becomes Focus of Name-Calling Battle</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diarist Anne Frank has become the
focus of a name-calling match pitting one of her closest friends
against her stepsister and the official group that maintains her
World War II hiding place.
   Jacqueline van Maarsen alleges in a book published Thursday that
Anne Frank's stepsister, Eva Schloss, is opening exhibits and
giving lectures posing as Anne's friend although the two never knew
each other.
   She writes that the government-subsidized Anne Frank Foundation
is supporting that claim even though it knows Ms. Schloss is lying.
   Author Van Maarsen is known as ``Jopie'' in Anne Frank's diary,
because Anne invented pseudonyms for many of the people she wrote
about. The diary, found after Anne perished in a Nazi death camp,
is world famous.
   ``Anne and Jopie'' is Ms. Van Maarsen's 113-page defense of her
claim to being Anne's best friend to the exclusion of all others.
   ``Ever since she's become famous because of the diary . . . I
have heard people say so many times they were close to Anne Frank,
when I know it's not true,'' the 60-year-old author said in a
telephone interview.
   According to Ms. Van Maarsen, Ms. Schloss is being used by the
foundation and is capitalizing on her supposed friendship with Anne
to promote her own book about the Holocaust, ``Eva's Story.''
   Ms. Schloss is the daughter of Fritzi Schloss, who married
Anne's father Otto after his entire family perished in Nazi death
camps.
   Author Van Maarsen argues there's no way the two young girls
could have known each other, even though the Schlosses lived on the
same street as the Franks before the war.
   ``I was Anne's best friend. I feel it is my duty to Anne to
bring these facts to out into the open. It is part of history,''
Ms. Van Maarsen said.
   Anne Frank Foundation President Hans Westra said ``The (``Anne
and Jopie'') story is a lie.
   ``It is a theory she has made up in her head . . . a trivial
debate over who knew Anne Frank better. I have no idea why she is
doing this.''
   Ms. Schloss said ``I don't know what has got into'' Ms. Van
Maarsen.
   ``Anne was a very lively child with many friends . . . I say I
knew her but I never say I was her best friend or even a good
friend,'' she said in a telephone interview from London, where she
now lives.
   The diary contains references to ``Jopie'' as well as ``Eva.''
Levien Rouw, an Anne Frank Foundation researcher, said it wasn't
clear whether that meant Eva Schloss or was just another pseudonym.
   In a Sept. 25, 1942, letter to ``Dear Jacqueline,'' Anne said
farewell to Ms. Van Maarsen after going into hiding and wrote ``I
hope that we will always be `best' friends until the day we meet
again.''
   The Anne Frank Foundation noted that Otto Frank wrote letters
saying Anne and Eva Schloss played together after school.
   Westra said he often invites Ms. Schloss to speak because her
wartime experiences resembled Anne's. Ms. Schloss was deported to
the Aschwitz camp after years in hiding.
   The Franks were German Jews who fled the Nazis in 1933 and
settled in the Netherlands, like the Schlosses, who came from
Austria.
   Anne, her parents, her sister Margot and four other people hid
in an attic closed off by a bookshelf from June 1942 until their
betrayal to German police in August 1944.
   Anne was 15 when she died at Bergen-Belsen in 1945, months
before American troops liberated the camp.
   About 600,000 people a year visit the hiding place, in a
17th-century building, and the Anne Frank Foundation has developed
into a prominent Dutch pressure group against anti-Semitism and
racism.
   Ms. Van Maarsen said Anne was ``spirited, funny, cheerful and
active, but she could also be nasty and jealous.''
   She said that by writing her own book, ``I became part of the
Anne Frank cult, which I had been observing with mixed feelings for
years.''

<HEAD>CIA Chief Says East German Files Providing Valuable Information</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials are gaining important espionage
information from newly available files of the disbanded East German
secret police, CIA Director William Webster says.
   West German officials have shared with the United States
information from voluminous files seized when the communist
government of East Germany was toppled by popular discontent last
fall, he said.
   ``We have pursued a number of important leads,'' the CIA
director said in an interview with The Associated Press on
Wednesday. ``That's not to say we've identified spies, but we've
learned more about some notorious cases,'' he said, declining to
elaborate.
   East Germany's notorious Stasi secret police had about 80,000
agents keeping tabs on its 11 million citizens, Webster said. The
files have yielded a bonanza of secrets and identified some highly
placed West German officials as East German spies, he said.
   Webster said his counterpart in Moscow ``must be wondering'' how
many Soviet spies have been compromised by the seizure.
   The CIA director also said the United States and Soviet Union
have been sharing information about terrorist threats, and the
Persian Gulf crisis may open the way for more intelligence
cooperation.
   But the Kremlin must be careful about sharing intelligence on
Iraq with the United States because it is trying to negotiate the
departure of about 5,000 Soviet citizens trapped there, Webster
said.
   ``Anything they say that suggests they provide intelligence to
us may diminish their chances'' of getting the Soviets out, he
said. Many of the Soviets serve as military advisers, and the Iraqi
arsenal is largely Soviet-made.
   KGB chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov said in a recent interview with
the AP that his organization is willing to share intelligence about
Iraq but hasn't offered because the CIA has rebuffed its past
efforts to cooperate.
   ``Our common interests in the gulf open up an opportunity to
deal more frankly on terrorism,'' Webster said.
   Soviet support for states like Iraq and Libya, which sponsor
terrorism, appears to have declined, making some cooperation with
the United States possible, he said.
   The United States cannot expose its intelligence sources in such
cooperation, but it has passed along warnings to the Soviet Union
about threats to its officials or diplomatic facilities abroad,
Webster said.
   In several cases, ``it was pivotal to their preventive
actions,'' he said. Some of the warnings were specific, others more
general, he said.
   The Soviets, too, have relayed information to the United States
about threats to this country's people, Webster said. He declined
to elaborate.
   Iraq's President Saddam Hussein has isolated himself from his
top advisers and is forming many of his impressions based on news
accounts, Webster said.
   He said Saddam enjoys broad support among poorer Iraqis and
among the military ranks, and any move to unseat him would have to
come from the top echelons of his military.
   Saddam believes ``a sit-tight mode is his best posture,'' but if
he thinks the United States is planning to attack, Iraq likely
would take pre-emptive action, Webster said.
   Iraq has dug in substantial ground forces in Kuwait and ``it
looks like he intends to make it costly'' for U.S. troops to launch
a land-based offensive, the CIA chief said.
   On other matters, Webster said:
   -The gulf crisis has improved chances for the release of eight
Americans held hostage by pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon.
   ``There is good reason why Iran would want to resolve'' the
hostage issue because it wants to improve its image and ease its
international isolation, he said, although Iran doesn't necessarily
control all the hostage-holders.
   ``On the whole, I am more optimistic than I was two years ago,''
he said.
   -Cuban leader Fidel Castro is having serious economic troubles,
especially because the Soviets have cut their support. While he
doesn't appear in immediate danger, ``his trouble thermometer is
up,'' Webster said.

<HEAD>Successor to Nazi War Crimes Company Makes Huge Claims in Eastern
Germany</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The successor to I.G. Farben, the infamous
chemical works that propelled Adolf Hitler's Nazi war machine, is
trying to reclaim vast amounts of property in former East Germany.
   For many, the news comes as a shock, while the goverment agency
returning land and businesses to private ownership has tried to
withdraw a reported statement the claims may be valid.
   The victorious World War II Allies in the West broke up I.G.
Farben into several companies, including the mighty Bayer, Hoechst
and BASF concerns. Communists in East Germany nationalized the I.G.
Farben property there.
   A successor company, called I.G. Farben in Liquidation, was
formed in the early 1950s to handle remaining legal claims,
including pension rights. The Frankfurt-based company went into a
lengthy liquidation process that was expected to be completed by
1992.
   Then, the Berlin Wall fell in November, reuniting families,
thrilling the world and giving hope to 16.6 million East Germans
beyond the Iron Curtain.
   It also gave hope to the thousands of shareholders in the I.G.
Farben successor company, who have a right to any further property
the company can recover. Share prices since January have doubled to
$16 each on the Frankfurt exchange.
   Ernst-Joachim Bartels, one of the two liquidators, is now
actively pursuing the lost property. He is looking into
``reactivating I.G. Farben'' to administer whatever may be returned
to the company's ownership.
   ``It is clear to me we will get something,'' Bartels said,
adding it is too soon to make precise predictions.
   In some cases, I.G. Farben would accept financial compensation
rather than the return of the land and factories themselves.
Bartels and his colleagues work out of a 10-room suite in
Frankfurt.
   The fabled Krupp arms maker and the I.G. Farben conglomerate are
the two names most closely associated with the industrial muscle
behind Hitler's murderous Third Reich.
   I.G. Farben itself stands for for Interessengemeinschaft der
deutschen Farbenindustrie - or German Dye Industry Syndicate. At
its height, it was the largest chemical company in the world.
   The mammoth concern was involved in the production of the
infamous Zyklon-B gas used in mass-killings at the Auschwitz death
camp.
   Profit-hungry managers also used cheap slave labor from
Auschwitz at a neighboring plant to make all-important synthetic
rubber and fuels for Hitler's army.
   In 1948, one of the Nuremberg tribunals sentenced 11 men
connected with the I.G. Farben war crimes to prison terms ranging
from 18 months to eight years.
   Bartels, overseer of the I.G. Farben successor, says the company
paid $7.1 million in reparations in the 1950s. He says that
fulfills the company's obligations.
   Still, the Tagesspiegel daily newspaper of Berlin wrote that
``possible compensation for the survivors of the work camps in the
Third Reich must be discussed'' in the event of a return of
property.
   The newspaper also reported that two British investment
companies had bought I.G. Farben shares over the summer, as
speculators saw the chance of huge profits.
   Joining tens of thousands of others seeking to regain property
in the former East Germany, I.G. Farben filed its claims by
Saturday's deadline.
   The properties named are reportedly worth billions of dollars,
including several still-operating chemical plants and real estate
in the eastern half of Berlin.
   In all, I.G. Farben's holdings in former East Germany totaled 58
square miles, the company says.
   Complicating matters is a section of the German-German
unification treaty wiping out the rights of those whose property
was confiscated from 1945 to 1949.
   That is when the Soviet occupiers reportedly took over most of
the I.G. Farben facilities, although I.G. Farben's liquidators have
indicated they may challenge the legal basis of those
expropriations.
   While interest in I.G. Farben has been growing in recent weeks,
the stock price jumped when a key German official was quoted in
German newspapers this week as saying the claims may be legitimate.
   ``We are trying to go as quickly as possible,'' Wolfgang Nautsch
later told Berlin's RIAS radio. He said speedy action was needed to
settle legal rights and, at the affected plants, employment
obligations.
   Nautsch is a top-ranking official of the Treuhandgesellschaft
agency overseeing the return of East German property to private
ownership.
   However, a spokesman for the agency insisted that Nautsch had
been misinterpreted regarding the legitimacy of the demands.
   ``There are no claims,'' said spokesman Wolf Schoede regarding
the I.G. Farben position. He said Nautsch was only ``thinking out
loud'' about possible court-ordered changes to make such claims
possible.

   The gunfire on Jerusalem's Temple Mount did
more than put Israel back at the Middle East's center stage. It let
loose domestic political squabbles that had been stilled by the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   A week after police killed 19 Palestinians in riots on the
sacred mount, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government is under
fire from Israel's left wing and from human rights activists.
   Even his right-wing allies are bickering among themselves.
   Strangely, the uproar comes as most Israelis are united in anger
over a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning their country
for ``excessive force'' and over a rare U.S. vote against Israel in
the council.
   But political leaders and newspapers both are complaining that
by refusing a U.N. invesetigation of the killings, Shamir's Cabinet
is keeping the world's indignation focused on Israel instead of on
Saddam Hussein's Iraq.
   ``This is an empty and damaging stubbornness that doesn't serve
Israel's political interests,'' Yedioth Ahronoth said in an
editorial Wednesday.
   The daily newspaper said the move ``will certainly lead to a
harsh and unnecessary confrontation with the United Nations and the
U.S. administration.''
   Before the Cabinet vote, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
pleaded for Israel to accept the U.N. probe, and both he and
President Bush have since repeated the plea.
   Mayor Teddy Kollek, Jerusalem's leader for more than 25 years,
says that despite the Cabinet rejection he will meet U.N.
investigators if they come.
   Te center-left Labor Party and several left-wing factions are
engineering a vote of no-confidence next week in Parliament because
of the government's stand.
   Shimon Peres, whose Labor Party is the largest opposition
faction in Parliament, says the Cabinet action has served only to
keep the heat on Israel.
   ``With our own hands, instead of extinguishing the fire, we are
increasing the flames,'' he told reporters.
   Shamir's colleagues in the right-wing Likud bloc have stuck with
him. But they have their own dispute on the emotional issue of
Jerusalem's status.
   Right after the Cabinet challenged Washington by rejecting the
U.N. probe, Housing Minister Ariel Sharon announced plans to build
5,000 new apartments for new Soviet immigrants in Arab east
Jerusalem.
   Washington immmediately made public a letter signed a week
earlier by Foreign Minister David Levy to secure $400 million in
U.S. housing loan guarantees for the thousands of arriving Soviet
Jews.
   Levy promised ``not to direct or settle Soviet Jews beyond the
Green Line,'' which divided Israel from Jordan before the 1967
Middle East war.
   East Jerusalem is beyond the Green Line, and the United States
views it as occupied land just like the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Washington sees Jewish settlements on the captured lands, including
east Jerusalem, as obstacles to peace.
   But Israel annexed the eastern part of the city into its
``eternal capital'' after the 1967 war. Any threat to Israeli
control is cause for alarm, particularly among Shamir and his
fellow Likudniks.
   Thus Levy's letter has raised an uproar.
   Sharon fumed on Israel army radio, ``I don't believe that a
foreign minister could give such an obligation.'' Newspapers have
carried blasts at Levy from other, unidentified Likud officials.
   What embroils east Jerusalem in the U.N. dispute is that the
Temple Mount, where the killings occurred, sits on what was
Jordanian-held territory before the 1967 war.
   Shamir and Levy have argued that no U.N. delegate has a right to
investigate killings of Palestinians that occurred on land Israel
considers sovereign territory.
   Levy complained, too, that the Security Council condemned Israel
even before its probe opened and never mentioned stone-throwing by
Palestinians at Jewish worshipers that set off the police charge on
the Temple Mount.
   Israelis in general share the government's anger at the Security
Council for failing to mention stoning of Jews at the Western Wall,
the last remnant of the ancient Jewish temple and Judaism's holiest
site.
   But a few nagging voices have questioned whether injuries to 34
Israeli civilians and police, minor injuries at that, justified
shooting that left 19 Palestinians dead and more than 140 wounded
at a site also holy to Moslems.
   The human rights group Betselem, comprised of liberal Israelis,
raised the question in a report accusing police of firing
indiscriminately in the Temple Mount killings.
   Betselem's charge added to the roar of debate over the Cabinet
rejection of a U.N. probe and the American role in condemning
Israel before the world.
   The volume has increased since the days when Israel was keeping
a ``low key'' approach to the gulf crisis.

   Young, skin-baring and refreshing are the first
messages as ready-to-wear shows for next spring get under way.
   More than 80 designers will be showing for the next week in a
courtyard in the Louvre and elsewhere, spending up to $200,000 for
the larger runway shows.
   There appears to be as much hype and crowd interest as in the
past, despite of market downtrends and the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Lolita Lempicka got applause Wednesday for a lilting collection
that featured micro-models with bustiers and bras shaped like
underwear.
   This lingerie trend started out with several houses last season,
and Lempicka took it into a perky ingenue vein, adding lace to
little green or pink satin slip dresses, covering them decently
with peppy short trench coats.
   She, like several other designers showing this week, liked the
look of bare backs crossed by straps, and occasional bare midriffs.
As her forte is suits, she put plenty of pep back into grey flannel
by adding appliqued flower details.
   Some of her shortie prints had a certain 1940s nostalgia with
their fit and head-wraps, though they were far too short for that
period.
   Those wanting to dress up Lolita-style might try some of the
little white dresses decked out in big pearl or silver baubles and
buttons. If they were not in light summer fabrics, they would look
just fine along with the skaters at Rockefeller Center at
Christmas.
   Lempicka showed some safari suits and appealing sailor looks,
turning up already elsewhere as well.
   At Dorothee Bis, the clothes also had a youthful bent - with
shorts, shortie jackets, flaring tent dresses, corsair and longer
pants. They came in red-white-blue linens and kabig, a kind of
smooth broadcloth like that used in pea jackets.
   Paco Rabanne's show in a small Left Bank shop was also a hit for
the younger set who can wear the stretch fabrics and micro-minis.
   The Spanish-born inventor of the chain-mail and metallic dresses
put a witty little flourish on some of his bare-midriff cotton
outfits: they were made of cotton patterned just like his original
metal-plate models of some 20 years ago. Some were even cut and
metal ringed, though the plates were cotton this time.
   Metallic lame stripes in green and warm yellow added late-day
dash to trouser outfits.
   Ishiro Kimijima's collection was one of the most creative so
far. This 61-year-old Japanese brought out a smart group of
beachwear with fishnet inspiration, a good use of raffia, lots of
see-through voile over bikinis or shorts.
   He took Nefertiti and ancient Egypt for some inspiration. But he
also used plastic minis to advantage, and many of the clothes had
seashell and starfish embroideries and decor.
   Kimijima's heavily bewigged mermaids ending the show draped in
strands of lame-lace looked as if they'd just emerged from a golden
seaweed sea.
   Another, younger Japanese, Inoue Jun, showed equally short and
youthful lines for his company called June, July, Auguste, who
showed in a small space on the Right Bank.
   His forte for next summer is in the skimpy but well-cut little
jackets with soft shoulders. They're worn over shortie skirts or
shorts with some longer looks thrown in for good measure. He
concentrates on soft, offbeat pastel shades and blues in a bluejean
vein.
   The house of Lecoanet-Hemant opted out of a big runway show. But
their rack line shown in a hotel display room had some fine ideas
for summer, with plenty of expensive couture touches.
   Stone-washed soft silk suits with soft cuts and short skirts
look quite elegant in either salmon or coral pink, deep navy or
black.
   They also pep up a well cut, easily-fitted dark shantung silk
suit with life-saver embroideries in rust-shaded raffia.
   A fine topper here for a slinky stretch skirt or hostess pyjamas
is the generous acid-green waffled organza blouse with a big collar
and billowing sleeves tied under the elbow.
   One striking innovation is the use of copper-metal threads for a
new fabric in a transparent blouse, typical of Lecoanet-Hemant's
occasional enthusiasm for eccentric but beautiful new fabrics.

   State health officials believe an
80-year-old man was the second person to die from the St. Louis
encephalitis virus spreading across central and south Florida, but
they'll never know for sure.
   Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services spokesman Ernie
Durfee said Michael Mulready's death Sept. 21 has been classified
as a presumed case of the mosquito-borne viral illness that causes
brain swelling.
   Insufficient spinal fluid was drawn from Mulready, a resident of
St. Lucie on Florida's Atlantic coast, for tests to confirm he had
the disease, however, Durfee said.
   As of Wednesday, there were 38 confirmed cases of encephalitis
this year in Florida. One death was confirmed, in West Melbourne.
   In 1977, the last major outbreak of the disease in Florida, 110
cases were reported and eight people died.

<TEXT>
   A rookie politician just graduated from high
school, but he already may be drawing the most attention to the
office of justice of the peace since Judge Roy Bean and his
six-guns were the law west of the Pecos.
   In March, while still a senior, 18-year-old John Payton defeated
50-year-old incumbent Jim Murrell in the Republican primary.
   There is no Democratic candidate on the Nov. 6 ballot, so Payton
is assured of victory unless Murrell is successful with a write-in
campaign he's waging to hold on to the $37,944-a-year job.
   ``I didn't take him seriously, but I am certainly capable of
running a campaign,'' said Murrell, who lost 6,549-to-6,029 in the
primary.
   Justices of the peace perform weddings, issue warrants and
conduct trials on criminal and small claims cases. Perhaps the most
well known Texas JP was Bean, whose court was the Jersey Lily
Saloon in Langtry.
   In the 1880s, Bean, a hero of pulp fiction and 20th century
television, dispensed his own brand of justice with the help of his
guns. He once fined a corpse $40 for carrying a concealed weapon.
   Peace justices don't have to be lawyers and the age requirement
is only 18, so Payton chose the job for his first foray into
politics, which he wants to make his career.
   ``I went out there the old fashioned way and worked for it,''
said Payton, whose 19th birthday is Jan. 23.
   He's now a political science major at Collin County Community
College in this town just north of Dallas.
   Murrell says he learned a lesson from his primary loss.
   ``We are doing everything that we know how to do to contact
voters,'' Murrell said.
   ``We're talking about our age, education, time in the area ...
the experience I have as justice of the peace, teaching,
instructing and community service,'' Murrell said.
   He's also asking reporters to check whether Payton had to make
up classes and was fired from his part-time job in the grill at
Chase Oaks Golf Course.
   Lynn Coker in the school registrar's office said she couldn't
release Payton's record without his permission. Payton said he
needed to take extra courses because he transferred from Maryland
during his junior year.
   Golf course manager Gary Black said Payton wasn't fired and was
a good employee for the three months he worked there.
   ``He just basically said he did not have enough time to do his
job and run his campaign and try to do a good job as a justice of
the peace candidate,'' Black said.
   County Republican Party Chairman Jerry Madden predicts another
victory for Payton.
   ``He did an outstanding job in the primary,'' Madden said.
   Payton has promised to conduct night court and weekend weddings.
He also has attacked Murrell as a college dropout.
   Murrell said ministers conduct weekend weddings and says night
court would cost a minimum of $100,000. Murrell acknowledges he
never finished college, but says he has a wealth of life experience
vital to the job.
   ``I do not feel that an 18-year-old is capable of having the
maturity to do the job that we have to do,'' he said.
   Payton responds that Murrell is prejudging him.
   ``I bring to the court ... integrity, honesty, high ethics and
high moral standards,'' Payton said. ``I support hard work. ... I
was out there walking door-to-door.''
   Payton said his campaign has the attention of other teen-agers.
   ``They're very excited because they now can say that what lies
ahead of them is a good and a hopeful and a prosperous future,'' he
said.
   Murrell isn't planning his future beyond the election, but said
he has other job offers to consider if he loses.
   ``I'm not running just to keep a job or to keep a paycheck
coming to my house,'' he said. ``There's always something I'm
capable and qualified of doing.''

   Some say prosecutor Collier Vale blamed
himself for the slaying of a police informant in a tragic mix-up
and believed his career was over at age 39. But no one thought he
would kill himself.
   Perhaps not even Vale thought that - until the last moment.
   ``It appears to have been a spontaneous event,'' Monterey
County's chief deputy coroner, Glen Brown, said of the
self-inflicted gunshot.
   Authorities are still investigating Vale's apparent suicide Oct.
5 at his apartment. He didn't leave a note. And although colleagues
say he seemed to linger with goodbyes the day before he died, he
didn't appear suicidal.
   ``I don't know why this happened,'' said Vale's boss, District
Attorney Mike Bartram.
   Friends say Vale felt tremendous guilt when an informant was
killed Aug. 8, 1989, after information got out that she was helping
police investigate a double killing in Seaside, 115 miles south of
San Francisco.
   Through a mix-up of similar telephone numbers, Vale called
Songia Petite Johnson, 20, instead of Sonjii Yvette Johnson, 23,
who was a witness in the July 16 double killing. Both women lived
in the same high-crime neighborhood and both their names were
pronounced ``Sonya.''
   While trying to interview the wrong woman, Vale said enough for
her to figure out that the other woman was an informant.
   Authorities speculate that, largely to protect herself from drug
dealers, Songia Petite Johnson spread the word that the other woman
was the ``snitch.'' Three weeks later, Sonjii Yvette Johnson was
shot to death. Authorities would not say where Songia Petite
Johnson could be located for comment.
   After the mix-up was discovered, the Johnson slaying was
assigned to the state attorney general's office. Vale was widely
blamed in press reports for the young woman's death. The story also
was televised nationally on ``A Current Affair'' about a week
before Vale's death.
   ``When you have so many fingers pointing at you and saying you
caused another person's death it's going to have an effect on
you,'' said Monterey Police Sgt. Fred Ragghianti.
   Vale claimed he was given incorrect information, and authorities
say a police officer may have confused the numbers. Vale's
defenders also note that he offered the informant police protection
three times.
   Still, Vale's guilt-feelings persisted.
   ``It bothered him considerably, that he might have caused this
lady's death,'' said Superior Court Judge John Phillips, who gave
Vale a job in the district attorney's office in 1979.
   ``When you're a prosecutor or a police officer you're supposed
to be hardhearted and not let things get to you,'' said Sheriff Bud
Cook. ``I think he felt maybe he did something wrong ... and it
finally got to him.''
   Bradley Hardison, 25, is charged with killing Sonjii Yvette
Johnson to prevent her from testifying in the double killing.
Hardison was a friend of Anthony Jacobs, 25, who later pleaded
guilty to manslaughter in the earlier slayings.
   Johnson reportedly overheard Jacobs talking about the double
slayings.
   Melinda Young, a court reporter in Salinas who was Vale's
girlfriend for several years, said that in the weeks before his
death he was consumed with thoughts of the Johnson case.
   ``He felt so helpless, so terribly vulnerable,'' she said. ``He
was miserably unhappy about all this. It was the catalyst for him
feeling that his career was, as he put it, `over.' ''
   Vale was likely to lose his job as a top prosecutor in January
when a new district attorney, Dean Flippo, takes over. During his
campaign, Flippo often said: ``When I run the office no one is
going to get killed.''
   Four years ago, Vale left the prosecutor's office to go into
private practice. But he couldn't stay away. He rejoined the office
within a year.
   ``He was always a fighter in court,'' Ragghianti said. ``Once he
got a case, he took it all the way. He wouldn't let go. But if a
case called for compassion he had compassion, too. I guess he felt
too much.''

   The Senate blocked a rank-and-file Democratic
effort Wednesday to redirect the pain of a bipartisan
deficit-reduction bill more heavily at the wealthy and less sharply
at the middle class.
   The $250 billion budget-cutting measure then withstood its
second crucial test as lawmakers turned aside an effort by Western
senators to kill a doubling of the gasoline tax.
   The votes left intact a compromise budget that mildly raises
income taxes on the rich, cuts Medicare benefits and boosts the
federal gasoline tax from 9 cents per gallon to 18{ cents. Overall,
the Senate plan includes a broader-based tax increase than the
soak-the-rich House version that President Bush has said he will
veto.
   Lawmakers rejected the tax-the-rich proposal, offered by Sen.
Kent Conrad, D-N.D., by 67-32. They then voted 59-40 to keep the
gasoline tax in the bill, defeating an attempt by Sen. Steve Symms,
R-Idaho, to knock it out. Adoption of either effort would have
unraveled the entire package, leaders said.
   ``I'd say to those who want to kill the package, vote with the
senator from Idaho,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
just before the vote on the gasoline tax.
   The defeated effort to tax the rich, proposed by Sen. Kent
Conrad, D-N.D., sought to capitalize on what legislators say is
growing public disenchantment with the tax code. It would have
imposed higher income-tax boosts on the wealthiest Americans, cut
the gasoline tax increase in half, and eased cuts in Medicare and
agriculture.
   But leaders of both parties stuck by their middle-of-the-road
package. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, warned
that the amendment would never be enacted into law.
   ``Adoption of this amendment would make a very strong
statement,'' conceded Mitchell. ``It will result in no law.''
   As debate began, Democratic Budget Committee Chairman James
Sasser, D-Tenn., said, ``We tell the American people that there
will be some sacrifice in this package. But we tell them at the
same time that it will be fair.''
   And the White House said the Senate version could form the basis
for ending the government's long budget stalemate.
   ``The White House is ready to receive the bipartisan package
similar to the Senate package,'' said Bush's chief of staff, John
Sununu. ``Get it to the president's desk and he'll sign it.''
   The administration also said Bush might not shut down the
government Saturday if lawmakers show good faith progress toward a
deficit-reduction package. Sununu said Bush might sign legislation
keeping the government operating if it included budget-cutting
provisions that ``show Congress meant business about it.''
   Until now, the president has tried to keep the pressure on by
threatening to shut the government down unless Congress sends him a
full budget he can accept. Without emergency legislation, federal
authority to spend money expires at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
   Acting one day after the Democrats pushed a bill much tougher on
the rich through the House, Senate leaders chose to face Election
Day just three weeks off with a proposal bearing all the marks of a
political compromise.
   There would be limits on deductions for people with incomes
exceeding $100,000, but no boost in tax rates for the rich as the
House approved. The 9-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax would be doubled,
but the earned-income tax credit for the poor would increase, too.
   The package would shave about $250 billion from the federal
deficit over the next five years by raising $142 billion in new
taxes and paring Medicare, farm support and other benefit programs.
Savings in other bills - mainly defense cuts - would bring total
deficit-reduction to about $500 billion, including $40 billion in
the budget year that started Oct. 1.
   Bush had threatened to veto the House bill because of its
increase in the upper bracket income tax rate. Though
administration officials objected to some provisions in the Senate
version, Sununu said in an interview on NBC-TV the president liked
the compromise.
   Despite the plan's powerful supporters, the Senate's Democratic
and Republican leaders spent the day defending their plan from
lawmakers unhappy for regional or philosophical reasons.
   Western senators complained that the higher gasoline tax would
be a severe blow to states such as theirs, where people routinely
drive long distances. Others insisted that the bill's overall tax
package was unnecessary, that spending should have been cut more
deeply instead.
   ``Grab your wallets and run for cover because Congress is
getting up a head of steam to raise your taxes,'' said Symms.
   Party leaders replied that with the economy teetering, everyone
had to pull together.
   ``I believe the deficit of the United States is so serious that
it isn't a Democratic issue or a Republican issue or the
president's issue,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the
budget panel's ranking Republican. ``The people want us to do
something.''

<TEXT>
   A judge's decision to dismiss a drug charge
against a woman whose baby was born with cocaine in its system
should discourage similar prosecutions of pregnant women, a lawyer
involved in the case said Wednesday.
   The decision was the first in the country to validate a woman's
constitutional privacy rights in such cases, said Nancy Gertner, a
Boston lawyer who represented 20 groups interested in the case.
Among them was the American Civil Liberties Union.
   Plymouth Superior Court Judge Suzanne DelVecchio on Tuesday
dismissed a drug distribution indictment against Josephine
Pellegrini, a 24-year-old Brockton woman. Prosecutors charged
Pellegrini when it was discovered her infant son, Nathan, was born
with cocaine in his body.
   ``It's not that a woman has a right to take cocaine and abuse
her own body,'' Gertner said, explaining Pellegrini's defense.
``What the state can't do is seek to use her status as a pregnant
woman for additional penalties.''
   DelVecchio's ruling has no authority outside Plymouth County.
But Gertner predicted the 19-page decision will sway judges in
Massachusetts and elsewhere.
   ``Whenever a judge ventures into a new area and writes something
this thoughtful, it makes a difference,'' Gertner said.
   ``There is no familiar bond more intimate and more fundamental
than that between the mother and the fetus she carries in her
womb,'' DelVecchio wrote. ``This court will not permit the
destruction of this relationship by the prosecution.''
   Pellegrini was indicted by a Plymouth grand jury in September
1989 on charges of distribution of cocaine to a minor and cocaine
possession. Based on the boy's medical records, authorities
determined Pellegrini must have ingested cocaine shortly before
Nathan's birth.
   District Attorney William O'Malley said he pursued the case to
discourage pregnant women from drug abuse.
   But DelVecchio said education, drug treatment and medical care
are better alternatives.
   ``By imposing criminal sanctions, a woman may turn away from
seeking prenatal care for fear of being discovered,'' she wrote.
   Geline Williams, the assistant prosecuting the case, said her
office has not decided whether to pursue the Pellegrini case
further.
   Williams argued the case fell under legal precedents for
charging third parties with murder or manslaughter in the death of
a viable fetus when a pregnant woman is injured or killed.

<HEAD>National GOP Sees Grant Race as Trailblazer for Democratic
Conservatives</HEAD>

   Rep. Bill Grant switched to the
Republican Party just months after the 1988 elections and Democrats
are out to avenge his ``treason'' on Nov. 6.
   Republicans see Grant's re-election bid as a test case: if GOP
candidate Grant wins in a district where 85 percent of voters are
Democrats, other conservatives - particularly in the South - might
be enticed to leave.
   ``It would show the national Democratic Party can vow all this
retribution and then it comes down to a lot of hot air,'' said Gary
Koops, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional
Committee.
   The message for other Democrats?
   ``I certainly think the conservative Democrats who are more in
tune with the Republican Party nationally would be more
comfortable'' about switching, said Koops.
   Democrats want to make an example out of Grant.
   ``We don't like party switchers and we would like to send them a
definite message,'' said Howard Schloss of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee. ``There hasn't been a referendum
on the Bill Grant switch.''
   Grant won re-election as a Democrat two years ago in the
sprawling North Florida district. A few months later, in a Rose
Garden ceremony with President Bush at his side, he converted to
the GOP.
   Democrats searched for a seasoned candidate to take him on this
year, but couldn't find a big name. That prompted decorated Vietnam
veteran Douglas ``Pete'' Peterson to make his first bid for office.
   For the Democrats, Peterson could help stem a decade of erosion
in Florida. Republicans now make up 40 percent of registered
voters, their highest total ever in the state. The House delegation
tipped to the Republicans for the first time when Grant switched
sides.
   It now stands at 11-8 in favor of the GOP. Rep. Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican, won a special election for the Miami
seat vacated when Claude Pepper died last year.
   Grant's district, one of the largest east of the Mississippi
River, is sparsely populated and rural, more like Alabama and
Georgia than the Florida of beach resorts, Disney World or ``Miami
Vice.'' Grant's theme is that despite the change in party labels,
he's still a good old boy.
   ``I'm not about to forget my heritage and my background,'' Grant
says in a campaign TV ad. ``This ground is sacred to us.''
   Grant, who has enjoyed campaign visits by President Bush, Vice
President Dan Quayle and White House chief of staff John Sununu, is
running as a can-do Washington hand with the contacts to get the
most for constituents.
   Grant says he moved to the Republican Party ``for the right
reason. I can do the job better now because we have the attention
of the administration.''
   ``As someone told me once, people vote for the person, not the
party,'' he said.
   With $450,000 raised through the end of September, Grant has
more than twice as much money as Peterson.
   Peterson, who easily defeated youthful attorney Bob Boyd in the
Sept. 4 primary, is a retired Air Force colonel who was shot down
over North Vietnam in 1966 and spent 6{ years as a prisoner of war.
He's running as the outsider with proven integrity, hoping to
capitalize on the country's anti-incumbency mood.
   ``Pete Peterson - they won't change him in Washington,'' says a
Peterson TV ad that focuses on his years as a POW.
   ``I want to do it as a citizen-congressman as opposed to
somebody who's up there trying to further his political career,''
Peterson said. ``I'm not interested in a long political career.''
   Peterson campaign manager Jon Ausman said he's been somewhat
disappointed in the money raised by the state and national parties.
   ``We're getting a lot of technical assistance, which is
extremely valuable,'' he said. ``They're not providing the level of
support you would have been led to expect when they declared this
the No. 1 race in the country.''
   Peterson could never have expected to outspend Grant and can run
better as the low-budget candidate, say Schloss and Simon Ferro,
chairman of the Florida Democratic Party.
   ``He's going to win this race in the trenches,'' Ferro said.
``The key is telling the voters of Grant's treason. We think
Grant's vulnerable.''
   Koops, however, said the incumbency is a trump card that helps
neutralize any lingering anger among voters over Grant's
conversion.
   ``The Democrats underestimated that strength of Bill Grant,'' he
said. ``I think he has got an outstanding record that people can't
quibble with.''
   No independent polls have handicapped the race, but both sides
say Grant is in the lead although a significant percentage of
voters remain undecided.

<HEAD>Second Fuel Assembly Detached at Indian Point Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A radioactive fuel assembly at the Indian
Point nuclear power plant was successfully detached Wednesday from
overhead equipment it had become snagged on, the utility said.
   Earlier, another fuel assembly was accidentally dropped about 10
feet.
   The two fuel assemblies had been inadvertently extracted from
the fuel core when they failed to detach from at plate that was
being removed as the reactor was prepared for refueling.
   The New York Power Authority has said the public never was
endangered by the mishap at the plant on the Hudson River 35 miles
north of New York City.
   The first fuel assembly dropped into a steel basket placed in a
fuel storage area to receive it Tuesday night, rather than being
slowly lowered by special equipment, said power authority spokesman
Todd Forte.
   About 16 workers left the building, which is designed to contain
any radiation. They returned when it was determined no radiation
was released.
   Workers detached the second fuel assembly from the cover
Wednesday, Forte said.
   The plan to remove the stray assemblies was approved by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   Forte said both assemblies will be inspected by staff from the
Power Authority and from Westinghouse Electric Corp., which
designed the reactor, before they are moved to the plant's fuel
storage area.
   The plant was taken out of service Sept. 15 for refueling,
maintenance and replacement of low-pressure turbines.
   The plnat was scheduled to resume electric generation on
Thanksgiving Day weekend. Utility officials have not determine how
much delay the fuel assembly problem will cause.

<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Charles ``Chip'' Pashayan is a
congressman with two strikes against him.
   The six-term Republican incumbent accepted campaign
contributions from indicted savings and loan figure Charles
Keating. And he's running against a fourth-generation farmer in a
district that covers part of the heavily agricultural San Joaquin
Valley.
   ``Frankly, I'm running a favorite son race,'' said Democrat
Calvin Dooley.
   Dooley say he doesn't believe Pashayan ``provides the
pro-active, progressive leadership this valley needs. He cannot
provide leadership independent of his special interests.''
   Only two California incumbents have lost re-election bids to
Congress since 1982.
   But Pashayan's savings and loan involvement combined with a
general anti-incumbent fervor make him the member of Congress most
likely to lose his job in November, says a Capitol Hill newsletter,
Roll Call.
   The Rothenberg Political Trend Report said Pashayan's is one of
only 20 House elections nationwide in which the party holding the
seat may change.
   Pashayan, of Fresno, won easily in 1988 with 71 percent of the
vote. However, he since has had negative publicity about the
campaign contributions from Keating and his associates.
   One Dooley ad told voters: ``We can sit by and let Pashayan's
contributors clean out our wallets or we can clean house and change
congressmen.''
   Although he returned $26,000 to Keating, Pashayan has been
criticized for failing to return $4,350 from Keating lobbyist
Leonard Bickwit. Pashayan said the Bickwit funds are ``not Keating
money'' but donations from a longtime friend.
   The Bush administration is intensely interested in the race.
   So far, three Cabinet secretaries have campaigned for Pashayan,
and Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter is expected to show up in
the district before the election.
   The district includes all or part of the nation's top two
income-producing farm counties - Fresno and Tulare.
   Despite Pashayan's vote against the budget compromise, President
Bush recently released a 30-second commercial urging voters to
return him to Washington.
   ``I voted for what I felt was in the best interests of the
district and California,'' Pashayan said of his vote against the
budget compromise. ``This is just one enormous struggle because
Congress is attempting to make an enormous solution to an enormous
problem.''
   Dooley has accused Pashayan of being an ineffective congressman
and ``aligning himself with corporate farming interests'' at the
expense of family farmers.
   ``We have to have government that is responsive to the people.
That requires that your elected officials have to live at a higher
standard than the general populace,'' Dooley said.
   House Speaker Tom Foley has virtually assured Dooley a seat on
the Agriculture Committee if he defeats Pashayan. Rep. Beryl
Anthony, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, said he supports Dooley's bid for the committee
assignment because it is critical to the valley's economy.
   Dooley has criticized Pashayan for not sitting on the
Agriculture Committee and pointed out that he has only sponsored
one piece of legislation that has been signed into law. The 1986
bill authorized the interior secretary to let Southern California
Edison Co. continue its contract on a hydroelectric plant in
Sequoia National Park.

   The letter from Chevy Chase Federal Savings

<TEXT>
   The 1990 farm bill worked out by a
House-Senate conference committee is meeting lukewarm acceptance at
best and downright rejection at worst from farm organizations.
   ``The bill was somewhat disappointing,'' Rob Nooter, lobbyist
for the American Farm Bureau Federation, said Wednesday. He said
his organization has not decided whether to endorse the package.
   The compromise was approved in conference early Tuesday and
requires adoption by the full Senate and House.
   It's ``more poison than antidote for the struggling rural
sector,'' said the National Farmers Union, which is urging
rejection.
   NFU President Leland Swenson said the budget-cutting provisions
in the bill will slice farm income as much as they lower the
federal deficit.
   ``It's really ironic that Congress can pass farm law that
practically mandates rural devastation,'' Swenson said.
   The bill contains a rural development package to help businesses
in communities losing their farm base expand with special loans
based on federal matching funds.
   It also would establish satellite hookups for rural schools with
educational programs in urban areas and rural hospitals with
big-city health centers.
   But some view the budget-cutting provisions as so damaging to
rural economy that the development package won't matter much.
   The bill ``is a disaster for family farmers and for recent
cooperation between farmers and environmentalists,'' said Randolph
Nodland, president of the National Family Farm Coalition.
   ``This bill is guaranteed to drive farm income down and restrict
farmers' access to affordable credit,'' he said. ``Further, the cut
in base acreage tells farmers to get out of the program, if not out
of farming.''
   The key to saving the $13.6 billion from agriculture programs
forced on the conference committee by deficit-reduction mandates is
the so-called ``triple base'' program.
   Under the plan, farmers will have to reduce their subsidized
acreage by 15 percent. Those acres could be used for anything but
growing fruits and vegetables, giving farmers the opportunity to
grow for consumer demands rather than the government-protected
programs.
   Proponents of the system say it could actually earn farmers more
money than government dependency, if they plant wisely.
   Another big chunk of government savings comes from calculating
deficiency payments over 12 months instead of five. This will start
in 1994.
   Nodland said the 15 percent cut in subsidized acreage and change
in computation of deficiency payments will encourage farmers to
leave the government programs, which are strictly voluntary and
require conservation efforts.
   ``This triple-base proposal comes at a very bad time,'' said
Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who served on the conference committee.
``A triple-base on, let's say, a hundred bushel-per-acre corn
operation, by our calculations, is about $15-an-acre reduction in
income for the producer.''
   Combined with increased production costs caused by rising oil
prices, farmers will experience a $35 to $40 cash-flow reduction
per acre, Kerrey said.
   ``This bill makes tough but fair budget decisions,'' said Senate
Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who chaired
the conference. ``The major increases in flexibility will give
farmers greater freedom to plant the crops that are best for their
farm.''
   Other savings measures in the bill include:
   -Maximum acreage reduction of 20 percent for wheat and feed
grains, 25 percent for cotton and 35 percent for rice. The
agriculture secretary has the discretion to reduce acreage as
needed to control excess stocks.
   -Frozen target prices of $4 per bushel for wheat, $2.74 for
corn, $2.61 for grain sorghum, $2.36 for barley, $1.45 for oats,
$.79 a pound for cotton, $10.71 per hundredweight for rice.
   -In 1994 and 1995, deficiency payments on wheat, feed grains and
rice computed on a 12-month basis, instead of the current five
months.
   -Price support for wheat and feed grains of 85 percent of a
five-year moving price, with the agriculture secretary given the
discretion to drop the loan rate by up to 20 percent.
   -An 18-cent loan rate for sugar.
   -An assessment on dairy producers if government purchases exceed
7 billion pounds.
   -Soybean non-recourse marketing loan of $5.02 a bushel with a 2
percent service charge.
   -Tighter payment limitations on wool and honey programs, capping
the loans at $75,000 per producer.
   -Service charges of 1 percent on loans for dairy, sugar,
tobacco, wool, mohair and honey.

   Jurors sent the wrong message on gun
owners' responsibilities by acquitting a hunter of manslaughter in
the shooting death of a woman he mistook for a deer, relatives of
the victim said.
   ``There's going to be blood on their hands'' if someone else in
Maine dies under similar circumstances, Gerry Veninsky, brother of
Karen Wood, said after the jury cleared Donald Rogerson on
Wednesday.
   ``It's not a hunting issue. It's not a gun-rights issue. It's
responsibility and accountability,'' Veninsky said.
   Rogerson, 47, a supermarket produce manager from Bangor, shot
Wood in the chest as she walked in woods 130 feet behind her home
in Hermon in 1988. The 37-year-old mother of twin year-old girls
had moved from Iowa four months earlier.
   Rogerson, the lone defense witness, testified Tuesday that he
fired after he spotted what he thought was a deer through the scope
of his rifle. He said he apparently mistook the woman's white
mittens for a deer's white tail.
   The Superior Court jury reached its verdict after nine hours of
deliberations. Rogerson could have received up to 20 years in
prison if convicted.
   ``I'm very overwhelmed at this time,'' he said. ``I hope and
pray the Lord will give Mr. Wood the strength he has given me
through this whole ordeal.''
   The case had pitted hunters against non-hunters and newcomers
against old-timers in Maine, where hunting is a way of life. Maine
sells more than 200,000 hunting licenses each year.
   The state's top wildlife official said the verdict made no
``social statement about Maine and hunting.''
   ``The verdict makes it clear that the jury feels it was an
accident,'' said William J. Vail, commissioner of the Department of
Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. ``Accidents are accidents ... It was
a tragedy on both sides.''
   Members of Rogerson's family embraced after the verdict. Mrs.
Wood's husband, Kevin, who now lives in Bettendorf, Iowa, said he
was stunned.
   ``Perhaps people outside the state of Maine will view this as I
do, that Donald Rogerson was criminally negligent in killing my
wife,'' he said, his voice breaking.
   Some critics had suggested that Mrs. Wood was at fault for
wearing the mittens during hunting season and that because she was
``from away'' - from another state - she was ignorant of Maine's
hunting tradition.
   ``When you are from here, the rules are ingrained in you as a
child,'' Hermon resident Joanna Payne said. ``I wouldn't come out
here during deer season. You just have to know that.''
   The victim's sister rejected such notions. ``Any one that would
think Karen is to blame would be foolish. Let's face facts: If she
couldn't be in her own back yard, where are you safe?'' said Sharon
Veninsky.
   Jurors declined to comment.
   This year, Hebron, a town of about 5,000, is giving residents
red warning signs that advise hunters they are approaching
residential areas. Nearly 100 people have signed up for the
first-ever hunting safety course held in the town.
   Defense attorney Lewis Vafiades said Rogerson hasn't hunted
since the shooting and probably never will.
   Rogerson was arrested the evening of the shooting. But a grand
jury concluded that his actions were neither negligent nor
reckless.
   Prosecutors reopened the case in 1989 after a Portland TV
station reported that a nephew of Rogerson's attorney had served on
the grand jury. A second grand jury indicted Rogerson that year.

<HEAD>Government Protests U.S. Tuna Embargo; Dolphin-Killing The Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is protesting a U.S. decision
to embargo Mexican tuna and says the restriction could complicate
the two countries' move toward a free trade agreement.
   The United States advised Mexico on Monday that it was forced to
halt Mexican tuna imports because of a finding by a California
court that Mexico's tuna fishermen kill too many dolphins.
   Fisheries Secretary Maria de Los Angeles Moreno called the
embargo ``exaggerated'' and said it constitutes a ``non-tax trade
barrier'' that could complicate trade talks between Presidents Bush
and Carlos Salinas de Gortari next month.
   Mexican officials have said that they hope by the end of 1991 to
negotiate a trade agreement similar to the one the United States
signed with Canada last year.
   A federal court in San Francisco ruled on Oct. 10 that Mexico's
tuna catch, the second largest after the U.S. fleet's, violates the
1988 Marine Mammal Protection Law, which limits the number of
dolphins that can be killed in tuna fishing.
   Moreno said the U.S. Commerce Department had assured her it will
appeal the ruling within the next 10 days.
   ``We hope that, since we are on the best of terms and seeking a
free trade agreement, that will be positive for the tuna embargo,''
Moreno said.
   Earlier, the Fisheries Department issued a statement contending
that parts of the U.S. law were ``unilateral, lack scientific
foundation, are discriminatory, run counter to the principles of
international accords on trade and limit coastal countries'
exercise of sovereign rights in their exclusive economic zones.''
   The federal court ruling overturned a Sept. 7 finding by the
Commerce Department that Mexico's Marine Mammal Program provides
dolphin protection comparable to that of U.S. law.
   In April, the three largest tuna canners in the United States -
distributors of StarKist, Bumblebee and Chicken of the Sea brands -
said they would stop buying and selling tuna captured with
dolphins.
   That decision has meant a 15 percent loss of exports by Mexican
tuna producers, Felipe Charat of the National Fishing Industry
Chamber told the government news agency Notimex.
   In June, Mexican officials prohibited night tuna fishing to cut
down on the number of dolphins caught along with tuna.
   Dolphins are air-breathing mammals and swim alongside tuna
schools. They painfully suffocate to death when inadvertently
caught in large purse nets commonly used in tuna fishing.
   The Fisheries Department said Wednesday that Mexican dolphin
captures have been reduced 70 percent since 1986.
   ``Operation of the Mexican tuna fleet would no longer be
economically viable if the levels and percentages established in
the arbitrary U.S. legislation were met,'' the department said.
   Mexico's tuna fleet captures about 150,000 tons a year, half of
which is exported.
   About 14,000 tons are normally sold annually to the United
States, but the amount dropped to 3,000 tons this year when Mexican
authorities, faced with possible U.S. sanctions, instructed tuna
fishermen to seek other markets.
   The United States imposed an embargo on Mexican tuna in 1980 in
retaliation for Mexico's declaration of a 200-mile offshore
economic zone that prohibited U.S. boats from fishing for tuna in
its waters without a permit.
   That embargo lasted six years.

   He's 55, with a slight paunch, salt-and-pepper
hair and a penchant for bologna sandwiches and cowboy hats. He's in
the federal witness protection program ... or maybe producing
movies ... or driving an 18-wheeler.
   He's Elvis in the '90s.
   Or so says Gail Brewer-Giorgio, author of the best-selling ``Is
Elvis Alive?'' She's back with ``The Elvis Files,'' her latest look
at the phenomenon she's helped create about Elvis Presley and his
(alleged) death 13 years ago.
   The folks at Graceland say Elvis remains buried at his Memphis
tourist attraction. Biographer Albert Goldman maintains Presley
committed suicide. Elvis' hairstylist, best man, personal cook and
Memphis Mafia sidekicks - all in books of their own - confirm the
King is gone.
   Gail is not convinced.
   ``The possibility of Elvis Presley's being alive is greater now
than it was a year ago, two years ago. And I am not alone in that
belief,'' Brewer-Giorgio writes in the new book.
   She goes so far as to guess (via a letter from one true
believer) when Elvis will make his comeback: Ag. 16, 1993, the
16th anniversary of his excursion to that Graceland in the sky.
   Brewer-Giorgio is right about one thing: she's not alone. Seven
percent of Americans in a 1989 CBS News poll said they believed
Elvis was alive; most of them, apparently, sent the author
unsolicited accounts of their first-person encounters with the King
of rock 'n' roll.
   There's gas station attendant Alton R., who lives outside
Nashville.
   ``I was talking on the telephone to my mother when a man stopped
in for gas. As he approached the store to pay for his purchase, I
told my mother, `I think this man is Elvis Presley.' ... He turned
to me, smiled with that same crooked smile, and winked and left
without a word. I am convinced that Elvis was in my presence that
night,'' says Alton.
   A woman named Sunny of Jonesboro, Ga., says she received a
bologna sandwich and a bag of Chee-Tos from ``E'' during an October
1987 visit to the Air Force Museum in Dayton, Ohio. A Missouri man
spotted Elvis on the second floor at Graceland earlier that year.
   The book contains divergent tales of Elvis' musical tastes. A
Seattle woman says she spotted a bearded Elvis in a cowboy hat
checking out the competition at a Rolling Stones concert, while a
Michigan man says the King was inspecting old Monkees albums at the
Lakeside Mall.
   Elvis told that same Michigander that he owned an old English
sheepdog and an airedale. Later, in an alleged telephone
conversation with Brewer-Giorgio, Elvis drops several bombshells:
   -Elvis attended his daughter's Oct. 3, 1988, wedding.
   -He's disappointed with the way things are in society today.
``When I was a kid, people treated me cruelly. But they were nicer
back then compared to today,'' the maybe King says on the tape,
which comes with the book.
   -He hangs out in Washington, D.C.
   The last ties in with one of Brewer-Giorgio's pet theories:
Elvis, like ``Wiseguy'' Henry Hill, was forced into the federal
witness protection program for his own safety. Presley, who had 14
prescription drugs in his system at death, could have been targeted
for his work as a federal drug agent, she suggests.
   The possibility of Elvis working at Orion Pictures (they did the
film ``Great Balls of Fire'' about buddy Jerry Lee Lewis) is also
raised, as is the possibility that he could be back driving trucks
(he is often reported talking to folks via CB).
   But the last word comes from an Oglivie, Minn., woman who asked
her local postmaster to explain why there was no Elvis Presley
stamp. The anonymous federal employee provided this ominous
response:
   ``For a person to be on a postage stamp, he has to be dead. The
government is not sure Elvis is dead.''

<HEAD>Soviets Back in Grain Market With Corn Purchase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After shunning the U.S. grain market since
last spring, the Soviet Union once again is buying corn, just as
American farmers are harvesting a bumper crop.
   Agriculture Department officials said Wednesday that private
exporting companies sold 350,000 metric tons to the Soviets under
terms of the current long-term supply agreement between the two
countries. No prices or other details were disclosed.
   The pact, including a three-month extension, expires Dec. 31. A
new five-year agreement will begin at that time.
   Although the Soviet Union recently bought some U.S. soybean
meal, it had not purchased significant quantities of wheat or corn
since May. USDA officials have speculated that Moscow delayed
purchases to see how 1990 harvests turned out in both the Soviet
Union and the United States.
   Other factors mentioned have included Russian hard currency
problems, the direction of U.S. farm legislation and whether the
United States might extend credit.
   Rumors have circulated in the grain trade for weeks that the
Soviet Union was or soon would be in the market for more U.S. corn.
Market prices have been under pressure from this fall's huge
harvest, estimated by USDA at 8.02 billion bushels, up 7 percent
from the 1989 crop.
   A big question is whether the relatively modest corn purchase
was the start of another substantial round of buying by Moscow or
simply a one-shot deal. In the past, the Soviets have bought U.S.
grain every few months, usually in a series of purchases over
several days or a week.
   Large sales to foreign buyers must be reported daily to USDA by
exporters.
   Sales of wheat and corn to the Soviet Union for delivery during
the year that ended Sept. 30 totaled 20.3 million tons, including
nearly 16.5 million tons of corn and more than 3.8 million tons of
wheat.
   In addition, the Soviets in 1989-90 bought 342,300 tons of
soybeans, 1.37 million tons of soybean meal and 7,300 tons of
barley.
   The 350,000 tons reported Wednesday were the first for the
three-month extended period, although soybean meal sales amount to
355,000 tons.
   A metric ton of 2,205 pounds is equivalent to 39.4 bushels of
corn. Thus, the 350,000 tons would be about 13.8 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.23 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA's five-day average. Thus, the latest
sale could have a farm value of about $31 million.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A swarm of Africanized honeybees, thought to
be the first to enter the United States naturally from Mexico, was
destroyed this week, according to the Agriculture Department.
   The swarm was detected near Hidalgo, Texas, James W. Glosser,
administrator of the department's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service, said Wednesday.
   Glosser said the Africanized honeybees were found by department
officials Monday during a regular check of traps baited with a
chemical sex lure to attract and capture migrating swarms.
   The swarm was destroyed and samples of the insects were
identified by the department's Agricultural Research Service
laboratory in Weslaco, Texas, as the Africanized variety.
   Africanized honeybees are hybrid offspring of African bees
brought to Brazil in 1956. Some escaped and mated with native bees.
Their descendants have been moving north since that time.
   The Africanized bee can be aggressive when threatened and swarm
quickly against an intruder. This characteristic has contributed to
their notoriety as ``killer bees,'' which USDA officials have
blamed on horror movies and exaggerated news reports.
   ``Although this is the first time we have trapped a natural
introduction of Africanized honeybees in the United States, we have
intercepted and eliminated ... swarms artificially introduced on
ships arriving from South and Central America many times since
1979,'' Glosser said.
   Bee experts say it is uncertain how fast the bees spread, but
estimates range from 100 to 300 miles a year.
   To the unaided eye, Africanized bees look like other honeybees,
the Agriculture Department says. The only way to tell is through
microscopic examination.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - New projections by the Agriculture Department
show that rising energy costs from the Mideast crisis will add
greatly to the expense of operating the nation's farms next year.
   If the world price of crude oil averages $30 per barrel instead
of an earlier USDA projection of $20.90, farm expenses for diesel
fuel, gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas and electricity will rise
10 to 15 percent, a report said Wednesday.
   And if the crude oil price in 1991 is $40 per barrel - as it is
now - farm energy expenses would go up around 25 percent.
   In 1990, the report said, farm energy costs will increase only
slightly to about $7.2 billion.
   ``This represents a modest gain in total cropland acres planted
and harvested, and a slight increase in the number of acres
irrigated, coupled with higher refined petroleum product prices in
the later part of the year,'' the department's Economic Research
Service said.
   Overall, energy costs are expected to account for about 6.2
percent of total cash production expenses this year.

   Vietnam is promising to increase cooperation
with the United States on obtaining an accounting of American
servicemen still missing 17 years after U.S. forces were withdrawn
from that country.
   Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach met Wednesday with
the President Bush's special envoy for the MIA issue, retired Army
Gen. John Vessey, and both were in an upbeat mood afterward.
   ``He has agreed to all the proposals I made and we agreed to the
proposals that he has made,'' Vessey said with Thach standing at
his side.
   Later, Thach said, ``There are no divergencies ... We will have
much closer cooperation on this issue.'' He added that both sides
agreed to accelerate their efforts to locate missing Americans.
   The subject matter was limited to the nearly 1,700 missing
Americans but the meeting clearly had political overtones.
   For Thach, his invitation to visit Washington was a breakthrough
in that no Vietnamese foreign minister had come here since Hanoi
became independent from France in 1954.
   Vessey, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
technical cooperation for joint investigations was agreed to, as
well as ways to seek information and to return the remains of U.S.
servicemen.
   He said the first priority will be given to the so-called
``discrepancy'' cases. These involve Americans who were last seen
alive but have nonetheless never been accounted for.
   Thach offered assurances there are no American servicemen in
Vietnamese custody, but he allowed for the possibility that some
might still be alive in a remote region without the knowledge of
the government.
   A joint team will be formed to examine the specifics of the new
forms of cooperation, Vessey said. Also participating in the
discussions was Anne Mills Griffiths, head of the National League
of Families, which represents relatives of missing Americans.
   Mrs. Griffiths said the results of Wednesday's meeting remain to
be seen but she expressed optimism about the outcome.
   Before the meeting, Mrs. Griffiths had said cases involving
hundreds of missing Americans could be resolved if the Vietnamese
attitude were more responsive.
   After meeting with Vessey and attending a luncheon that included
high-level State Department officials, Thach had separate meetings
with the foreign affairs committees of the Senate and House.
   He suggested that the two countries should put the bitterness of
their wartime rivalry behind them.
   ``I believe there will be normal relations because abnormal
relations is abnormal,'' said Thach, one of the architects of the
1973 agreement that led to the withdrawal of U.S. forces from
Vietnam. More than 55,000 Americans died there.
   The United States has linked the establishment of
U.S.-Vietnamese diplomatic relations to Hanoi's cooperation on MIAs
and on obtaining a settlement to the civil war in neighboring
Cambodia.
   Thach's ground-breaking visit is consistent with a pattern of
improving relations that dates back to July when the Bush
administration agreed to open discussions with Vietnam for the
first time on resolving the conflict in Cambodia.
   Earlier, U.S.-Vietnamese contacts had been limited to
humanitarian issues.

   Senate documents show Sens. Alan Cranston,
Donald W. Riegle Jr. and Dennis DeConcini had more extensive
dealings with the owner of the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan than
previously acknowledged.
   In one of the documents, Cranston thanks ex-Lincoln head Charles
H. Keating Jr. for a $250,000 contribution to a pet political
cause. In the same memo, the senator expresses pleasure that
Keating's meeting with the chief thrift regulator ``had gone so
well.''
   The Senate Ethics Committee documents, obtained by The
Associated Press, are expected to play a major role in the panel's
deliberations, beginning today, on whether to intensify the
investigation of the three senators - part of the so-called
``Keating five.''
   Committee Counsel Robert S. Bennett has recommended advancing
the investigation against Cranston, D-Calif., Riegle, D-Mich., and
DeConcini, D-Ariz., while dropping the investigation of Sens. John
McCain, R-Ariz. and John Glenn, D-Ohio. A committee decision was
not expected today.
   Some of the documents show:
   -Riegle's March 1987 visit to Keating's major company, a month
before he met with banking regulators on Lincoln's behalf, had a
fundraising purpose. The senator previously contended the visit was
just a ``brief stop'' to meet the employees.
   -Keating's fundraising efforts for Riegle, in the two months
before all five senators met with regulators, were far more
extensive than previously known.
   -A former top U.S. banking regulator, Roger F. Martin, said that
just weeks before the government seized Irvine, Calif.-based
Lincoln in April 1989, he received ``highly unusual'' calls from
Cranston and DeConcini at his unlisted home number urging sale of
Lincoln rather than a takeover. Cranston's call came after 10 p.m.
and DeConcini's at 5:30 a.m. the next morning.
   ``It sounded to me as if they were reading from the same script
or memo,'' Martin told the committee.
   -DeConcini assisted Keating in his crusade to have former top
thrift regulator Edwin J. Gray removed from the examination of
Lincoln. After Gray left office, the senator wrote Keating, ``Maybe
things will change now that he is gone. I sure hope so.''
   Another document shows an application to Lincoln that identifies
Cranston as a prospective ``borrower'' in September 1986. Cranston
spokesman Murray Flander said the application was for a line of
credit in case Cranston needed more money in the closing days of
his 1986 re-election campaign. Flander said the credit line was
never used.
   It was known previously that Keating and associates gave $1.3
million to the campaigns and favored causes of the five senators.
   The Ethics Committee is trying to determine whether there was a
connection between Keating's contributions to the senators and the
help he received from them as Lincoln headed toward collapse.
   The takeover of Lincoln could cost taxpayers more than $2
billion, but Keating insisted he was treated unfairly by U.S.
regulators.
   Flander said Cranston's late-night call on the sale of Lincoln
was an attempt to save jobs and taxpayer bailout expense. He said
Cranston ``never said they should make the sale regardless of
whether it met the criteria.''
   The spokesman added there was no connection between any money
raised by Cranston and contacts with regulators by Keating or the
senator.
   DeConcini spokesman Robert Maynes said the Arizona Democrat is
following his lawyer's advice not to comment and ``unfortunately is
not in a position to defend himself.'' Maynes deplored ``leaks'' of
documents, which he said could be taken out of context.
   Riegle aide David Krawitz said the senator was bound by the
committee's request for confidentiality but ``is confident that his
conduct was proper and ethical at all times.''
   Riegle's trip to Keating's major company, American Continental
Corp. of Phoenix, came a month before Riegle and his four Senate
colleagues met on April 9, 1987, with the federal regulators who
were examining Lincoln.
   The senator's public statement issued last November did not
mention that DeConcini's main Arizona fundraiser, Earl Katz, went
along. The senator's personal itinerary said, ``No discussion of
money. Earl will collect what needs to be collected later.''
   The documents show that in the month before Riegle and the other
senators met with regulators, there was an extensive fundraising
operation for Riegle. It was led by Keating, DeConcini and Katz.
   An Oct. 6, 1987, memo from Cranston to Keating coupled the
subjects of Keating's donations and a Cranston-assisted effort to
ensure better treatment for Lincoln Savings from federal
regulators.
   Cranston wrote that he was pleased ``to hear that your meeting
with Danny Wall (then the top thrift regulator) had gone so well.''
   In the same memo, Cranston said he was ``very grateful for your
willingness to contribute $250,000 this year'' to voter
registration projects for which the senator solicited money.
   DeConcini's help for Keating over a five-year period was
detailed in memos from his staff.
   One memo dated March 10, 1988, said Keating first contacted
DeConcini about his problems with Gray in June 1984.
   A ``confidential'' internal memo from a DeConcini staffer to the
senator on Dec. 20, 1988, mentioned that in July 1985, the senator
had ``phone conversations with both Don Regan (then White House
chief of staff) and Secretary (James) Baker (then secretary of the
Treasury) re: Gray.
   ``They share DDC's (DeConcini's) assessment that Gray is a
problem,'' although no action was promised, the memo said.

<HEAD>House, in Narrow Vote, Seeks to Shift Policy on Covert Aid to
Angola</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House is moving to shift U.S. policy in
Angola by cutting off covert lethal aid to anti-government rebels
if steps are made toward a peaceful end to the country's 15-year
war.
   But the lawmakers, acting after an unusual five-hour public
debate Wednesday on the technically secret program, rejected a move
to stop the aid immediately.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., said the conditional aid cutoff he
sponsored would turn the United States ``from a policy of continued
war to a policy of a creative search for peace'' in the southwest
African nation.
   The House voted 213-200 for the amendment, which would suspend
the lethal portion of U.S. aid to the UNITA rebels if the country's
Marxist government agrees to a cease-fire, sets a timetable for
free and fair elections and the Soviet Union halts weapons
deliveries.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., used a parliamentary gambit to demand a
second vote on the issue after administration officials sought to
turn around Republican votes. But the Solarz amendment survived
207-206, with House Speaker Thomas Foley dramatically casting the
deciding vote from the chair.
   In a related move, the House also accepted on a voice vote an
amendment by Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., to convert a $13 million
covert aid program for Cambodia's non-communist resistance into an
overt program, once a political settlement to the conflict is
achieved.
   The Cambodia vote and the open debate on Angola's lethal aid
program were evidence of Congress' increasing disenchantment with
covert paramilitary operations that many see as relics of the Cold
War.
   ``There is declining support for these efforts,'' Solarz said, a
statement underscored by Senate Intelligence Committee cuts earlier
this year in support for covert wars in Cambodia and Afghanistan.
   And in an interview with The Associated Press, Central
Intellgence Agency Director William Webster acknowledged Wednesday
that there is public and economic pressure on the United States and
the Soviets to abandon such proxy wars in the Third World. He
predicted that such conflicts will wind down ``to our mutual
advantage.''
   Sources say the United States contributes about $60 million in
covert aid annually to UNITA, the Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola. That compares
with about $500 million the Soviets give the Popular Movement for
the Liberation of Angola, the Marxist group that controls the
government.
   The sources say the primary reason for making the operation
covert is to provide cover for neighboring Zaire, which cooperates
with the United States in funneling aid to UNITA.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in a letter circulated on
Capitol Hill, argued against cuts in any of the covert paramilitary
operations, saying that to do so would disrupt efforts to achieve
diplomatic solutions.
   ``We have come a long way, but we are not there yet,'' Baker
wrote. ``I firmly believe that now is not the time for us to reduce
our support for these initiatives ... These programs have made a
critical contribution to bringing each of these conflicts closer to
a negotiated settlement.''
   Covert operations are only a tiny part of the overall
intelligence bill, which authorizes U.S. intelligence activities
around the world from spy satellites to military threat assessments
and economic analysis. The House version now goes to a conference
with the Senate to work out differences between the two versions.
   While most of the bill is secret, it is believed to authorize
spending in the neighborhood of $30 billion, most of which is
hidden in the Pentagon budget.
   It includes authorization for operations of the Central
Intelligence Agency; the Defense Intelligence Agency; the National
Security Agency, which electronically spies on the world; the
National Reconnaissance Office, which is building and launching a
new generation of radar-imaging spy satellites.
   The report accompanying the House bill notes that the
intelligence budget is growing more slowly than in the past decade,
and that the bill provides a 1991 spending level lower than
President Bush asked.

   Pat Boone says he made rock 'n' roll nice at a
time when it was considered dangerous, but he doubts he will get
the recognition he is due.
   Boone, 56, said Wednesday he deserves to be voted into the Rock
'n' Roll Hall of Fame but doesn't think he'll make it.
   ``I think I unwittingly made a significant contribution to rock
'n' roll,'' said Boone, who had 38 Top 40 hits in seven years. ``I
was a catalyst who made it more palatable and acceptable at a time
when there was a hue and cry about it.''
   Boone became famous as a singer and actor in the late 1950s and
early '60s with such hits as ``April Love'' and ``Love Letters in
the Sand.''

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - The Judds say they are breaking up
because Naomi Judd, the older half of the mother-daughter country
duo, has hepatitis.
   Naomi Judd, 44, said at a tearful news conference Wednesday that
she will continue writing songs. Her daughter, Wynonna, 26, will
start a solo career.
   The Judds were voted duo of the year for the third straight year
Oct. 8 by the Country Music Association. Their hits include
``Grandpa,'' ``Mama He's Crazy,'' ``Why Not Me,'' ``Rockin' With
the Rhythm'' and their current ``Born to Be Blue.''
   Their current tour is booked through Nov. 4 at Philadelphia, but
RCA spokesman Greg McCarn said additional dates were certain to be
set.
   Naomi Judd did not specify which type of hepatitis, an
inflammation of the liver, she has. Symptoms include weakness, loss
of appetite, nausea, vomiting and jaundice. Some strains of
hepatitis are chronic, others more short-lived.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Arsenio Hall's former manager says he made
the talk show host a star and is suing for half his profits from
``The Arsenio Hall Show.''
   Robert Wachs, fired by Hall on Aug. 2, said in a lawsuit filed
Wednesday that Hall broke his contract with him. He is seeking $75
million in damages.
   Wachs said he and Hall agreed in a 1988 oral contract that Hall
would pay Wachs' X Management Inc. half the comedian's profits from
his show and 15 percent of Hall's fee as the syndicated program's
executive producer.
   The lawsuit said Hall made about $5.5 million from the show in
1989.
   A spokeswoman for the comedian had no comment on the lawsuit. An

   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - Oscar-winning actress Greer Garson will
miss the opening of a studio complex named for her at the College
of Santa Fe because of the flu.
   The 82-year-old actress was resting at her home in Dallas,
spokeswoman Jean Carpenter said.
   Miss Garson, who won a best-actress Oscar in 1942 for her
portrayal of a courageous English woman coping with World War II in
``Mrs. Miniver,'' was to be honored Friday at a reception for the
Garson Communications Center and Studios.
   The complex, made possible by a $3 million grant from Miss
Garson, has two production offices and 250 acres of desert
property. College officials say it will be a major drawing card for
movie and TV production crews.
   Miss Garson received Academy Award nominations for her roles in
``Goodbye Mr. Chips,'' ``Mrs. Parkington,'' ``Blossoms in the
Dust,'' ``Madame Curie,'' ``The Valley of Decision'' and ``Sunrise
at Campobello.''

   ``I didn't know people were disturbed because no one lives near
me,'' Graham said Tuesday. ``I know I'd be upset, too. I live very
quietly and I'd complain.''
   Police Chief Phil Green said residents near Graham's secluded
estate first complained in June.
   Graham said he will have his pilot land at the Novato airport
and he'll drive the 15 miles to his home.

   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Novelist Marianne Wiggins says her most
rewarding writing lately has been about her months in hiding with
husband Salman Rushdie, author of ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Ms. Wiggins has written an account of her experiences after the
Ayatollah Khomeini placed a death sentence on Rushdie in 1989 and
the author went into hiding. Moslems said Rushdie's novel slandered
their religion.
   The couple slept in 56 beds during one 28-week stretch, she
said. Ms. Wiggins said writing about the experience has been
therapeutic.
   The University of Rochester on Friday will award Ms. Wiggins the
Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize for fiction by an American woman for
her latest novel, ``John Dollar.''

   PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) - Roxanne Pulitzer, who parlayed her lurid
1982 divorce into a career as a novelist, apparently has landed in
the middle of another breakup.
   This time, she has been accused of cavorting with a 27-year-old
race car driver who two weeks ago filed for divorce from his wife
of five years, the Palm Beach Post reported Wednesday.
   Ms. Pulitzer, 39, and the French-born driver, Jean de la
Moussaye, who traces his lineage back to Louis XIV and calls
himself ``Count,'' won't say whether they had an affair. But they
have made a business relationship public.
   De la Moussaye advertised Pulitzer's new novel, ``Twins,'' on
the front of his car last month in the Tampa Grand Prix. She
promoted him on radio and television.
   ``Business indeed,'' said de la Moussaye's wife, Francine.
``Monkey business.''

   Scientists have rushed to southern Texas
to thwart the nation's first invasion of ``killer'' bees across the
Mexican border.
   Officials on Wednesday slapped a quarantine on all bees in the
area to keep the fierce Africanized ``killer'' bees from wiping out
much of the domestically raised variety, which produces more honey
and pollinates valuable crops.
   A swarm of the Africanized bees was trapped Monday near the
border city of Hidalgo in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, said Anita
Collins, head researcher with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
Honey Bee Research Lab in Weslaco.
   The swarm was later confirmed to be killer bees, she said. To
the unaided eye, they look like other honeybees; they must be
identified under the microscope.
   Scientists headed to the area to check for Africanized bees in
all managed hives and to look for any other wild swarms, said John
G. Thomas, extension entomologist with the Texas Agricultural
Extension Service at College Station.
   Africanized bees, hybrids descended from docile European bees
and a vigorous African species, earned the ``killer'' nickname
because of their highly defensive behavior. Upn a perceived threat
to their nests, hundreds of the bees have been known to attack
intruders and chase them for long distances.
   Their sting is no worse than that of European bees commonly
raised in the Americas, but their persistence and swarm attacks
make them more dangerous. Several hundred people in Latin America
have been killed by the bees.
   The killer bees first escaped from a breeding experiment in
Brazil in 1957 and have rapidly expanded their range since.
   Several stowaway swarms have been trapped at U.S. ports aboard
ships from Latin America, and one swarm arrived in California
aboard a truck.
   The bees trapped Monday are the first known to have made it to
the border on their own, said James W. Glosser, administrator of
USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
   Scientists have expected them since a swarm was trapped last
November about 150 miles south of Brownsville in the Mexican border
state of Tamaulipas. Hundreds of traps were placed to detect bees
crossing the border.
   Ms. Collins said the swarm caught Monday was taken alive in a
trap baited with a natural chemical sex lure known as a pheromone.
   Under the state's emergency plan, beekeepers and farmers won't
be allowed to move bees beyond a two-mile radius of where the swarm
was trapped.
   Agriculture officials worry about the impact. Killer bees are
more difficult to manage than European ones, which have lost much
of their fighting spirit through centuries of breeding for
agriculture.
   The USDA has estimated that the Africanization of U.S. bees
could cost beekeepers up to $58 million a year and cost farmers
more than $40 million a year through an estimated 5 percent to 10
percent reduction in bee-pollinated crops.

   Leftist rebels attacked air
force headquarters on Wednesday night and apparently engaged troops
in several other sections of the capital. Authorities said a number
of people were wounded.
   An official of the military press office said the guerrillas
attacked the air force headquarters, located in the city's eastern
sector near Ilopango air base, with automatic weapons and homemade
mortars.
   An air force mechanic was wounded and one aircraft damaged, said
the official, who spoke by telephone and insisted on anonymity.
   He gave no details and said ``the situation is now under the
control of the armed forces.''
   However, reporters also heard explosions and exchanges of
gunfire in the poor neighborhood of Soyapango on the city's east
side, and in Delgado to the northeast.
   The Red Cross said several people were wounded in fighting, but
a spokesman said he did not know how many or have other details.
   Reporters touring the streets saw army helicopters dropping
flares and firing with automatic weapons at suspected guerrilla
positions near Ilopango and at other points in the city.
   Guerrilla leaders and representatives of President Alfredo
Cristiani's rightist government have been negotiating
unsuccessfully for more than a year to end the decade-old civil
war.
   But so far the talks have ended in deadlock, with the guerrillas
of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front insisting the
military should be drastically reduced in numbers, and officers who
violated human rights be prosecuted.
   The Cristiani government has balked at these requests, saying it
would be tantamount to doing away with the armed forces.
   Human rights groups estimate more than 73,000 people have been
killed in the war in this country the size of Massachusetts with a
populaltion of 5 million.
   In November, the guerrillas launched their biggest offensive
ever in the capital. It was repulsed after two weeks, leaving about
2,500 people dead.

<HEAD>Walesa Stumps in Mazowiecki Territory in Polish Presidential Race</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KRAKOW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Invading rival Tadeusz Mazowiecki's
territory in whirlwind campaigning, Lech Walesa told the people of
pollution-devastated Krakow that as president he would work to
protect its historic monuments.
   He also invited 20,000 cheering suporters in the city's
historic market square to join him in governing Poland.
   ``As I was able to overcome Communism together with you, now I
am inviting you to help with building'' a new system, he said
Wednesday.
   Mazowiecki, the country's prime minister, chose Krakow to kick
off his campaign Sunday.
   But Walesa, arriving in the city three days later, appeared to
receive an equally hearty reception - and a much larger crowd than
any that appeared for the prime minister.
   He told workers at Sendzimir Steel Mill in Nowa Huta, formerly
called the Lenin Steel Mill, that their plant might have to close
in part because of the pollution it causes, but other work must be
found for the 28,000 employees.
   Walesa traveled from his industrial home city of Gdansk to
Krakow, the former royal capital in southern Poland that has served
as the political base for Mazowiecki, a former Walesa adviser who
now opposes him in Nov. 25 presidential elections.
   Mazowiecki, officially registered as a candidate for president
Wednesday by the National Election Commission, edited the
Krakow-based monthly Wiez for decades and is linked politically to
the city's progressive Catholic Znak publishing house.
   At his hourlong market square rally, Walesa was applauded after
nearly every answer offered to questions shouted from the crowd. At
the end, almost everyone raised their hand when he asked who would
vote for him next month.
   ``I can see I will build Poland with you,'' Walesa responded.
   Walesa met for 30 minutes with invited Krakow intellectuals at
the National Museum, and appealed for ``agreement'' with the
faction that has largely left his worker-based union and rallied
around Mazowiecki.
   ``Passing through the city, I felt the strength of workers and
here I want to feel the strength of your minds. I want to be wise
with your wisdom and strong with your strength,'' he said.
   Walesa earlier received an honorary citizenship of the city,
conferred by city President Jacek Wozniakowski, a Znak colleague of
Mazowiecki and the father of Mazowiecki's campaign director.
   In Nowa Huta, Walesa said the jobs the steel-making district
provides are important but the pollution it spews ``threatens the
city itself.''
   ``Everyone must stop and think, because 28,000 people are
employed here,'' Walesa said. ``Those 28,000 people must have jobs.
Let's sit down and find something. I don't believe there is no
solution.''
   At city hall, Walesa told city council members and a crowd that
packed the building, ``I promise to do everything in my power to
prevent the devastation of Krakow's great monuments.''
   Krakow was Poland's capital until the end of the 16th century.
   Its medieval monuments include Wawel castle and cathedral with
the tombs of kings, queens and national heroes like Tadeusz
Kosciuszko, writer Adam Mickiewicz and Marshal Jozef Pilsudski.
   Pollutants from the industrial Silesia region and the Nowa Huta
mill, built by the Communists in the 1950s to bring a large
working-class to ``bourgeois'' Krakow, have corroded much of the
centuries-old sculpture and stonework.
   Walesa laid flowers and knelt in prayer at a simple metal cross
monument in Nowa Huta to honor Bogdan Wlosik, a teen-age protester
beaten to death in 1982 in a killing blamed on police during the
martial-law period.
   ``The sacrifice of this life will not be wasted,'' Walesa told
Wlosik's parents.
   Crowds waited for Walesa at each stop, chanting ``Lech Walesa,
Lech Walesa!'' and ``Solidarnosc!''
   The city hall was decorated with banners hailing Walesa, and a
band greeted him playing a new song set to an old folk melody:
``Long live Lech Walesa. Long live Solidarity.''

<TEXT>
   Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald's
bribery conviction disqualifies him from holding office for four
years and throws Navajo politics into turmoil just weeks before the
tribal election.
   MacDonald, 61, was convicted in tribal court Wednesday of 41
counts of bribery, conspiracy and ethics violations for taking
cash, loans, plane rides and use of an car from businessmen trying
to curry favor with him.
   His son, Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr., 36, was convicted of 23
counts.
   The elder MacDonald, who was suspended as tribal chairman last
year, is seeking the new office of tribal president in the Nov. 6
election. His opponent is former tribal chairman Peterson Zah.
   About 180,000 Navajos live on the 21,100-square-mile reservation
in Arizona, Utah and New Mexico.
   Navajo spokesman Duane Beyal said the tribe's nine-member
election board was to meet today to discuss the conviction.
Officials declined to say if they might cancel the election.
   Tribal law bars anyone convicted of ethics crimes from holding
office for four years.
   Prosecution and defense lawyers said they didn't immediately
know how long a prison sentence MacDonald could get at sentencing
Oct. 22. MacDonald, who was acquitted on one count, could have
faced 21{ years if convicted on all 42 counts.
   His son could get up to 12 years in prison.
   Attorneys for both men said they expected their clients would
appeal.
   The prosecution called 23 witnesses during the trial, but the
defense called none, saying the prosecution had failed to prove its
case.
   The trial is the first of three scheduled in tribal court for
MacDonald, a former aerospace engineer and four-term tribal
chairman.
   His second one is to begin Oct. 23 and involves conspiracy
charges stemming from the tribe's purchase of a ranch for $33.4
million from a company that paid $26.2 million for the property
only five minutes earlier. His son, an unemployed lawyer who lives
in San Jose, Calif., is also a co-defendant.
   The third trial, in which MacDonald faces 93 fraud counts
stemming from the tribe's 1986 elections, is scheduled to begin
Dec. 4.

<TEXT>
   Civil rights forces say President Bush will
unleash widespread anger among minorities and women if he arries
out his promise to veto a job discrimination bill on grounds it
would encourage hiring quotas.
   ``If the president vetoes the civil rights act, there will be a
firestorm of protest,'' civil rights advocate Ralph Neas said
Wednesday after the House approved the bill, 273-154, and sent it
to the president.
   The aye votes fell just short of the two-thirds margin sponsors
would need to override a veto. It was the second such
disappointment for civil rights forces in as many days.
   The Senate approved the bill Tuesday but also was a handful of
votes short of a veto-proof margin.
   Bush is expected to veto the measure and return it to Capitol
Hill with an alternative version he would be willing to sign. But
the chances of winning approval for an alternative version this
year appeared all but nil.
   The measure is aimed at overturning six job discrimination
rulings that created a furor when the Supreme Court issued them
last year.
   It would ban racial harassment in the workplace and allow
punitive damages in the most serious discrimination cases.
   The fiercest disputes, however, have come over fine print
changing complex rules on how job discrimination cases would
decided. They would make it easier for minorities to win lawsuits
and harder for employers to defend themselves.
   Bush said Tuesday in a letter to Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., he
would be ``compelled to veto'' the bill because it would force
employers to adopt hiring quotas.
   The measure says it does not ``require or encourage'' the use of
quotas, but critics say it would lead to them all the same. ``It's
not what the label says, it's what's in the bottle,'' said Rep.
Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill.
   Critics say employers would feel so vulnerable to lawsuits that
they would turn to quotas as a ready-made defense.
   ``It is easy for employers to hide behind this false hue and cry
of quotas,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. ``But anyone who
takes an independent and objective look at this bill will see at a
glance that the quota argument is a sham.''
   Sponsors picked up just one additional House vote since Aug. 3,
when an earlier version of the measure was approved.
   ``We're somewhat disappointed because we had hoped that the
additional compromises that were made since the vote last time
would have picked up some votes,'' said William Taylor, a longtime
Washington civil rights advocate.
   Taylor said that if Bush carried out his veto threat, ``I think
there's going to be a great anger.''
   Business critics of the bill were plainly in an upbeat mood.
U.S. Chamber of Commerce official Frederick J. Krebs issued a
statement saying the bill ``balkanizes and tribalizes our nation
rather than addressing the real problems facing many minorities
today - education and drugs.''
   ``Fortunately, there were sufficient `no' votes in both the
House and Senate to sustain the veto promised by the president,''
Krebs said. ``This is the silver lining.''
   But Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a prominent civil rights leader
during the 1960s, wrote a note to Bush recalling that he had been
``beaten and jailed more than 40 times. Why? Because I dared to
exercise my rights as an American citizen and I happen to be
black.''
   ``As one who has tasted the bitter fruit of racism and been
victimized by discrimination and racial violence, I appeal to you
to sign the civil rights act of 1990,'' Lewis said. ``It is the
right thing for you to do.''

   There will be fewer commercials on children's
television shows under a new law that President Bush said he does
not especially like, but nonetheless declined to block.
   Bush said Wednesday that he wholeheartedly backs the goals of
the ``Children's Television Act of 1990,'' but that he objects to
provisions that he believes infringe on First Amendment rights of
free speech.
   Thus, he said, he would not sign the bill, but neither would he
veto it, allowing it to become law today without his signature.
   The new rules will limit commercials on children's television
shows to 10{ minutes for each hour of children's programming on
weekends, and 12 minutes an hour on weekdays.
   Congressional critics said some stations now allow 13 minutes to
17 minutes of advertising during each hour of children's
programming.
   The president said he had constitutional questions about the
bill's requirement that stations provide educational programming as
well as the limits on commercials.
   ``This bill is intended to increase the amount and quality of
children's television programming and to diminish the
commercialization of programming for children,'' he said in a
statement.
   But while lauding the intent, he said he regretted that Congress
``has chosen inappropriate means'' of attaining admirable goals.
   A children's advocacy group criticized Bush's refusal to sign
the bill. Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's
Television, noted his previous pledges to boost American education.
   ``One would have thought that the `education president' would
embrace a measure that gives the TV industry an incentive to become
a partner in the education of this nation's young people,'' Charren
said from her organization's Cambridge, Mass., headquarters.
   Bush said he particularly disliked applying commercial
restrictions to cable stations, which he views as ``analagous to
the print media under the First Amendment.''
   Another section requires that applicants for TV station licenses
provide educational programming specifically designed for children.
   The Justice Department had recommended that the president veto
any bill containing that provision as an unconstitutional intrusion
into program content.
   Although Bush rejected the recommendation, he said in his
statement Wednesday, ``The First Amendment ... does not contemplate
that government will dictate the quality or quantity of what
Americans should hear - rather it leaves this to be decided by free
media responding to the free choices of individual consumers.''
   He said a constitutional challenge to the law might force the
Supreme Court to reconsider its current upholding of content-based
regulations on broadcast license holders.
   Further, Bush said, the limits on commercials ``cannot
reasonably be expected to advance their intended purpose.''
   Because children's TV is financed by advertising, he said, the
quality of programming could actually be diminished by curtailment
of advertising.
   The House and Senate last month approved the bill without
dissent.
   It effectively reverses President Reagan's 1984 deregulation of
the commercial content of children's TV programming. Reagan vetoed
congressional legislation similar to the bill that Bush allowed to
become law.
   Before the deregulation, broadcasters followed industry
guidelines allowing 12 minutes per hour on weekdays and 9{ minutes
per hour on weekend days.
   The new rules require the Federal Communications Commission - in
renewing the licenses of television stations - to weigh how well
broadcasters are serving the educational and informational needs of
children.
   They also require the FCC to complete an inquiry into
commercialization guidelines for children's television. This
provision is targeted at programs featuring toy characters brought
to life.
   The legislation sets up a federally funded National Endowment
for Children's Educational Television to subsidize the production
of children's programming. The endowment will receive $2 million in
1991 and $4 million the next year.

   Burglars breaking into a Danish
life-raft factory drew a little unwanted attention, setting off an
alarm heard across Scandinavia.
   They accidentally tripped an emergency transmitter on a life
raft, which sent out distress signals Wednesday from southern
Sweden to northern Norway, the Swedish news agency TT reported.
   Among the first to notice were passenger plane pilots who
reported the signals, which are used by life rafts, aircraft and
ships, to the air-sea rescue station at Stockholm's international
airport, the agency said.
   The station couldn't locate the source of the signals and
alerted Norway's main rescue center in Bodoe in northern Norway,
which was able to pick up the signals.
   The Bodoe center found that they were emanating from the Danish
city of Esbjerg and alerted the Danish rescue service at Karup,
which in turn told Esbjerg police.
   Police made the connection and sent a squad car to the factory.
There they found a smashed window, a howling burglar alarm and a
switched-on emergency transmitter but no trace of the uninvited
guests.

   Here are major provisions of the civil rights
bill approved by the House and sent to President Bush.
   The bill:
   -Bans racial harassment in the workplace.
   -Limits opportunities for third parties to reopen court-approved
minority hiring agreements.
   -Gives individuals more time to file job discrimination suits
than they have now.
   -Makes illegal any employment decision in which race, color,
religion, sex or national origin played any part, even if there
were other motivations.
   -Requires employers named in job discrimination suits to prove
in court that any of their employment practices with a disparate
impact on women and minorities is required by business necessity.
Currently, the plaintiff must prove that it is not.
   -Says ``the mere existence'' of a statistical imbalance in an
employer's work force is not enough to establish a discrimination
case.
   -States that nothing in the bill is designed ``to require or
encourage'' the use of hiring quotas by employers.
   -Allows courts to award punitive damages in especially serious
cases, and bars such damages except for employers engaging in
practices ``with malice, or with reckless or with callous
indifference to the federally protected rights of others.''
   -Caps punitive damages at $150,000 or the total of compensatory
damages plus back pay, whichever is greater.
   -Applies the provisions of the bill to congressional employment
but provides that the House and Senate themselves rather than a
federal court would rule on complaints.

<TEXT>
   The killer of a sheriff's deputy was
executed in the electric chair despite a plea for mercy for his
role in protecting prison workers during an inmate uprising.
   Wilbert Lee Evans, 44, was pronounced dead at 11:09 p.m.
Wednesday at the State Penitentiary.
   Evans, convicted of grabbing Deputy William Truesdale's gun and
murdering the officer while being returned to jail from a hearing
in 1981, went to his death after Gov. L. Douglas Wilder denied a
request for clemency.
   The inmate said he deserved a second chance because of his
actions during a 1984 uprising in which six death-row inmates
escaped from Mecklenburg Correctional Center. Evans was on death
row there at the time.
   Bart Stapert, assistant director of the Virginia Coalition of
Jails and Prisons, said Evans told him a half-hour before the
execution: ``I want to say to the family of Mr. Truesdale I'm dead.
You don't have to hate me any more.''
   Evans' execution was the 141st in the United States since the
Supreme Court allowed use of the death penalty to resume in 1976,
and the 10th in Virginia.
   Just 3{ hours before he was put to death, the U.S. Supreme Court
denied a stay of execution on an 8-1 vote. Justice Thurgood
Marshall, who opposes the death penalty in all cases, was the
dissenter.
   Marshall said the event at Mecklenburg ``casts grave doubt on
the jury's prediction of Evans' future dangerousness.''
   Evans' lawyers produced statements from prison guards and nurses
that Evans intervened to save them from harm during the breakout.
Of the escapees, three have been executed. The others remain on
death row.
   ``I am taking Justice Marshall's dissent opinion to the electric
chair and to my grave,'' Evans said in a statement.
   On Saturday, a federal judge granted Evans a stay, concluding
that the jury's finding of future dangerousness as a reason for
imposing the death sentence was thrown into question by Evans'
actions during the breakout.
   A federal appeals court lifted the stay Tuesday on grounds that
the relief sought by Evans was clemency, a matter for the governor
to decide.
   About 75 death-penalty opponents carrying candles walked to the
prison from a church service and sang gospel songs as the execution
approached Wednesday.
   ``Here is a guy that turned around,'' Suzanne Hawver said.
``What are we going to do? Are we going to kill him?''

<HEAD>Conferees Call for 90 Percent Cut in Industrial Emissions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Industries that now release more than 2.4
million pounds of toxic chemicals into the atmosphere each year
would have to cut those emissions by 90 percent under provisions
tentatively added to a compromise clean-air bill.
   House-Senate talks produced an agreement Wednesday that would
require factories and many businesses to install new technology
over the next 10 years to contain 189 hazardous chemicals,
including many that cause cancer.
   The members of the congressional conference committee were
expected to formally adopt the measure today along with provisions
tentatively approved last week requiring tougher emission controls
on automobiles.
   Approval of the toxics section of the 600-page clean-air bill
represented a major step toward possible completion next week of
the legislation, the first tightening of federal air pollution laws
in 13 years.
   Only one major section - requirements for utilities to reduce
emissions that cause acid rain - are left to consider and several
participants in the talks said they expect those differences to be
resolved.
   ``It shouldn't be that difficult,'' Sen. Dave Durenberger,
R-Minn., said when asked about the acid rain issue. He suggested an
agreement could be reached within a day or two.
   Bills passed by the House and Senate both call for utilities to
reduce annual sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million pounds by the
end of the decade. The major areas of discord in drafting a final
version is expected to involve efforts by Midwestern lawmakers,
whose states have the dirtiest coal-burning power plants, to seek
additional pollution credits.
   ``The sticking point (on acid rain) will be how much pain will
be inflicted on the dirtiest states,'' said Rep. Gerry Sikorski,
D-Minn., whose state is among those that already have ``clean''
utilities and balk at helping the Midwestern utilities cut their
pollution.
   The air toxics agreement represents the first time the
government would require factories and businesses to make dramatic
reductions in the 189 hazardous chemicals, including many
cancer-causing agents, they release into the atmosphere.
   The new controls would force emission reductions not only on
large petrochemical plants and factories, but also on smaller
businesses such as dry cleaners, furniture refinishers and
commercial boiler operators. The Bush administration estimates the
controls would cost industry $6 billion to $7 billion a year by the
year 2005.
   Environmentalists lauded the compromise agreement.
   ``People can breathe a sigh of relief,'' quipped Daniel Weiss of
the Sierra Club.
   David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the
new requirements will ``make a very giant dent in the toxic air
pollution in this country.''
   The compromise agreement on air toxics comes after lengthy
closed-door negotiations that began last weekend and for a time
were bogged down over whether to give the steel industry additional
time to comply with the new pollution controls.
   The two sides finally decided to provide steel companies 20
years longer than other industries - to the year 2020 - to cut
cancer-causing emissions from coke ovens.
   Toxic chemical emissions from smaller polluters such as dry
cleaners or furniture refinishers would have to be cut by 75
percent. Large polluters such as chemical plants, would have to
reduce emissions by 90 percent by using improved technology.
   The Environmental Protection Agency also would be required to
direct polluters to take additional measures after the turn of the
century if it is determined that ``an ample margin of safety'' from
cancer-causing emissions is not being provided to people living
near a plant.
   The agreement includes new air pollution requirements for
garbage incinerators, new safeguards and response programs in the
event of a chemical release accident.
   The House-Senate conferees began working on the clean air bill
in mid-July, but made little progress until September. A
breakthrough came Oct. 10 when the two sides reached agreement on
measures to reduce smog-causing pollution from automobiles and
trucks.
   Earlier the negotiators had resolved sections on setting a
timetable for cities to meet federal air quality standards,
reducing smog-causing emissions from industrial sources and phasing
out chemicals that damage the ozone layer.

   A day of somber remembrance gave way to a
night of celebration as survivors of the San Francisco Bay quake
marked its anniversary at a restaurant that stayed open a year ago
for those needing a good stiff one.
   ``To some people, it's like surviving the Titanic. They were
panicky a year ago, but now they're just happy,'' Alexander
Mortacavi, owner of L'Entrecote de Paris, said Wednesday night on
the anniversary of the Oct. 17, 1989 earthquake.
   Earlier Wednesday, people throughout the Bay area fell silent or
wept at 5:04 p.m., the moment the quake hit. Church bells tolled
and mourners in Oakland heaped white carnations near where the
Cypress Freeway collapsed and killed 42 people.
   The quake, which measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, killed 67
people throughout the Bay area and caused $7 billion in damage.
   ``My daughter is still scared, that's why I brought her out
here,'' said Jennifer Martinez, who gathered with 3-year-old Jenel
and several hundred others in the town square in Watsonville. The
town 70 miles south of San Francisco was one of the hardest hit.
   In Oakland, grief mixed with celebration as about 200 residents
gathered near the double-deck Cypress Freeway.
   ``A year ago today, we heard the loudest noise ever heard in
Oakland,'' said Paul Cobb, head of the Citizens Emergency Relief
Team, a neighborhood group. ``We saw neighbors grabbing ladders out
of their basements. Those who stood on corners with nothing to do
all of the sudden rose to the occasion.''
   People across the nation first knew something had happened when
the TV signal from the 1989 World Series between the Oakland
Athletics and San Francisco Giants at San Francisco's Candlestick
Park wnt dead.
   At the stadium Wednesday, Mayor Art Agnos said the disaster
``tested our character as a city and a people.''
   ``Those were some of California's most terrifying few seconds,''
Gov. George Deukmejian said at an earthquake conference in San
Francisco. ``But they were followed by some of the finest hours of
our society.''
   At L'Entrecote de Paris, Mortacavi recalled how the Financial
District hot spot stayed open after the quake because so many
people in the neighborhood ``insisted they needed a drink.''
   ``They came again tonight because they all wanted to be together
again,'' he said.
   ``We came back to celebrate surviving,'' said Roberta Aregger, a
patron.
   Much of the Bay area is still rebuilding and many people are
still shaken.
   San Francisco's AfterQuake Project, a mental health hot line,
was deluged with calls Wednesday. ``A lot of people are feeling
some anxiety about crossing the bridge. They are looking at the
weather,'' said counselor Alexandra Charusofsky.
   The mid-day temperature Wednesday was 80, about 10 degrees above
normal - ``earthquake weather'' according to some theories. On Oct.
17, 1989, the high was 83.
   In Watsonville, residents blessed the latest home to be rebuilt
since the disaster.
   In seaside Santa Cruz, more than 1,500 people gathered at the
Town Clock near Pacific Garden Mall, the still-devastated retail
zone where three people died.
   ``Don't just remember the bricks on the pavement, remember how
great it was downtown on a sunny day,'' Mayor Mardi Wormhoudt said.
``Think about what we can rebuild and create. ... Think of the
future.''
   She and others wiped away tears as residents observed one minute
of silence, beginning at 5:04 p.m., and then sang ``This Land is
Your Land.''
   At the Ferry Building in San Francisco, 1,000 people cheered as
the flag was raised for the first time since the quake.
   In San Francisco's Marina District, where the quake caused fires
and destroyed blocks of expensive homes, anniversary events were
scheduled before and after the actual date to avoid heavy media
coverage.
   ``People here are trying to get through the day,'' said Maggie
McCall, publisher of the Marina Times, a neighborhood newspaper.
``We don't like to be inhospitable, but we don't like people
staring at us all the time. It's hard for a lot of people.''

<HEAD>Judge: Jurors Can Laugh During 2 Live Crew Obscenity Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jurors in the 2 Live Crew obscenity
case, who have sat stone-faced during the trial but were seen
doubled over in laughter in the hall, have been told they can laugh
in court, too.
   The ruling from Judge June Johnson came Wednesday after jurors
confided that their efforts to keep from laughing during some
testimony had left them aching.
   The jury spent most of Wednesday straining to hear a barely
intelligible recording of a 2 Live Crew concert and listening to a
play-by-play description of the show by a sometimes red-faced
sheriff's deputy.
   ``The jurors have an unusual request,'' the judge told attorneys
for both sides. ``They want to know if they can laugh. Some of them
are having some physical pain.''
   Attorneys for both sides offered no objection. 2 Live Crew
leader Luther Campbell said it was a healthy sign for him and his
co-defendants.
   ``That's what this music is about,'' Campbell said. ``They're
supposed to be laughing.''
   The tape played Wednesday is the state's primary evidence
against Campbell and fellow 2 Live Crew members Mark ``Brother
Marquis'' Ross and Chris ``Kid Ice'' Wongwon.
   The rappers are charged with obscenity over an adults-only show
June 10 at a Hollywood nightclub. If convicted, they could get up
to a year in prison and $1,000 in fines.
   Prosecutors acknowledged that introducing the murky tape was a
gamble after the judge refused to let jurors have a transcript of
it while it played.
   Instead, they listened to snatches of the tape, many shorter
than five seconds, followed by sheriff's Detective Eugene McCloud's
descriptions of the actions of band members and the crowd.
   He detailed how young women from the audience got on stage and
danced suggestively with band members. One woman gyrated on her
knees with her face an inch from Campbell's crotch, he said, while
another's breast escaped her blouse as she danced closely with
Ross.
   The detective appeared to be uncomfortable describing the show.
   ``The way they were dancing, it was ... I'm embarrassed,'' he
said at one point.
   ``Eugene, we're all grown-up adults here,'' Assistant State
Attorney Leslie Robson prompted.
   During a break late in the day, Johnson's bailiff Mary Palacios
found the six jurors doubled over in laughter as they waited to
return to the courtroom.
   ``They were cracking up,'' Palacios said. ``One of them was
laughing so hard he could barely breathe. I said, `What's the
joke?' They said they didn't know if they could laugh or sneeze or
what during all of this.''
   Another prosecutor, Pedro Dijols, said he wasn't concerned by
the outburst.
   ``Laughter can mean many things,'' he said. ``People laugh when
they're nervous. I laugh when I'm about to convict.''

<TEXT>
   World producers are replacing lost Iraqi and
Kuwaiti oil faster than expected, with the shortfall projected to
be less than 1 percent by December, the Energy Department says.
   ``The loss of oil due to the Iraq occupation of Kuwait has been
almost eliminated,'' the department's Energy Information
Administration concluded Wednesday.
   The agency said the average worldwide shortfall of crude is
expected to be 1.1 million barrels a day this month and will drop
to 600,000 barrels a day in November.
   The agency projected a shortfall of 400,000 barrels day in
December and January, or less than 1 percent of the free world oil
consumption. The shortfall should be reduced to about half of that
in February through March, said Calvin Kent, the agency's
administrator.
   An estimated 4.3 million barrels a day were lost as a result of
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and subsequent oil embargo against
Iraq. The shortfall in September was 3.4 million barrels a day, the
agency said.
   Kent said that while many countries boosted production, Saudi
Arabia accounts for more than half of the additional oil, followed
by Nigeria, Libya, Iran and Venezuela.
   A month ago, the Energy Department estimated that despite
increased production to make up for the lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil,
there still would be a worldwide shortfall of nearly 1.9 million
barrels a day in October and as much as 1 million barrels a day
through January.
   Kent cautioned Wednesday that ``while the worst of the
production loss is behind us, any unforeseen production problem
could cause market reactions since the world is now operating at
near capacity production levels.''
   In another development, the DOE announced that it had awarded
the first contracts for the test sale of crude oil from the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Sun Refining and Marketing Co.
purchased 540,000 barrels and Shell Oil Company bought 95,000
barrels.
   The two were among 11 companies selected for purchases totaling
3.9 million barrels of oil from the reserve under the test
drawdown.

<HEAD>CDC Warns Against Mercury in Latex Paint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Homeowners should air out their houses when
painting inside with latex paint because of the possibility of
mercury fumes, health experts said today.
   Federal researchers reported in the New England Journal of
Medicine that hazardous traces of mercury were found in people's
bodies after they painted with latex paint containing mercury as a
preservative.
   Mercury poisoning can cause a variety of problems, including leg
cramps, rash, low fever, personality changes and nerve problems.
   Because of the danger, the Environmental Protection Agency
prohibited ading mercury to paint after Aug. 20. However, paint
manufactured before the ban can still be sold.
   Experts estimate that until recently, one-third of all interior
latex paint contained mercury. It was added to prevent fungal and
bacterial growth and prolong shelf life. Oil-based paint contains
no mercury.
   ``If I was a consumer, I would contact the paint company to
determine if the paint I was using had mercury in it,'' said Dr.
Mary M. Agocs. ``Whether or not paint has mercury, we recommend
that people ventilate their houses when painting.''
   She said mercury levels are probably highest during the first
few weeks after the paint is applied. She did not recommend
removing latex paint from walls.
   Agocs is a researcher with the federal Centers for Disease
Control in Sacramento, Calif.
   Her study was conducted on 74 people living in 19 suburban
Detroit houses that had been painted about a month earlier with
mercury-bearing paint.
   Their bodies contained almost four times as much mercury as did
28 people in 10 houses who did not use the paint.
   None of the people exposed to the paint appeared to be sick.
However, some had mercury levels that have been associated in the
past with symptoms of mercury poisoning. The mercury levels were
highest in children.
   Concern about mercury in paint arose last year after a
4-year-old Michigan boy suffered mercury poisoning when his home
was painted.

<HEAD>Former Stock Exchange Chairman Sentenced To 4 Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former chairman of the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange who helped transform the British colony's bourse into one
of the best-known in Asia was sentenced today to four years in
prison for corruption.
   Ronald Li, 61, was also ordered to pay an estimated $1.4 million
in court costs and profits reaped from his corrupt acts.
   The high-rolling stock exchange chairman was convicted in High
Court on Wednesday on two counts under Hong Kong's Bribery
Prevention Ordinance.
   Li was found guilty of accepting preferential offerings of
shares in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. and Novel Enterprises Ltd. in
1986 and 1987 in exchange for helping obtain listings on the market
for the companies' shares.
   Justice Kemal Bokhary sentenced Li to two years in prison for
each count. He had faced a maximum penalty of seven years in prison
and $64,000 in fines on each count.
   Prosecutors contended that Li made more than $100,000 in profits
by selling the shares he was awarded. Michael Kalisher, the lead
prosecutor, said court costs reached $1.3 million.
   Li's lawyer, John Lloyd-Eley said he would ``most probably''
appeal the verdict. Li faces other charges along with seven former
members of the exchange scheduled to be tried in February.
   In sentencing Li, Bokhary said he took account of mitigating
circumstances in the case, such as Li's good behavior in the past.
   Li was a powerful figure in this British colony's stockbroking
community for two decades and is the one of the most prominent
figures ever tried in Hong Kong.
   In the trial, Kalisher painted Li as the patriarch of an
exclusive society funded by friendly merchant bankers.
   ``It was a very cozy little club,'' he said in court.
   Li was instrumental in merging the colony's four exchanges into
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange four years ago, turning the bourses of
this British colony into one of the most dynamic in the world.
   His decision to levy a small fee for each stock purchase put the
exchange on solid financial ground.
   But his move to close the exchange for four days during the
world stock market crash in October of 1987 made him a
controversial figure and led to calls for his resignation.
   He stepped down as chairman of the exchange one month before he
was arrested in January 1988.
   Between Li's arrest and his appearance in court, prosecutors
dropped 13 charges lodged against him under the colony's Bribery
Prevention Ordinance because of lack of evidence.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has moved to normalize U.S.
relations with Czechoslovakia for the first time since World War II
and to dramatically reduce tariffs on that nation's exports to the
United States.
   The House, by a voice vote Wednesday night, approved a trade
agreement signed last April by the Bush administration and the
newly elected Prague government under which each country would
grant the other most-favored-nation trade status.
   That status would qualify the exporting country for the lowest
tariffs in effect on the goods it ships to the buying country.
   The agreement is the first U.S. bilateral trade accord with a
former Eastern Bloc country since the Warsaw Pact began collapsing
more than a year ago.
   The Senate also must approve the pact before barriers to trade
with the formerly communist-ruled Czechs are removed.
   President Bush signed the agreement in April but did not send it
to Capitol Hill for congressional approval until last month.
   The accord will effectively reduce by 90 percent the tariffs
paid on some $82 million in Czech exports to the United States last
year and open the way for increased business ties between the two
countries.
   The effect will be to give Czechoslovakia a much broader U.S.
market for its exports by cutting their prices to wholesalers,
retailers and ultimately American consumers by as much as up to 40
percent.
   It also will open the Czech economy to more U.S. exports while
also protecting American companies' patents and copyrights.

<HEAD>Consumer Groups Urge Boycott of Cars Without Air Bags</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three consumer groups want American car buyers
to refuse to buy automobiles not equipped with air bags.
   Motor Voters, the Center for Auto Safety, and the U.S. Public
Interest Research Group staged news conferences and demonstrations
in 12 cities to propose the boycott, focusing their ire on Japanese
economy models.
   Rosemary Dunlap, president of Motor Voters, noted that many
automakers equip only luxury vehicles with air bags, claiming the
$320 devices would drive away bargain hunters.
   She noted that Chrysler has several economy models with driver
air bags as standard equipment. ``If Chrysler can put air bags in a
car for under $8,000, what's Honda's excuse for leaving them out of
the Civic CRX, which costs over $11,000?'' she asked.
   But the groups faulted even Chrysler for not equipping its
popular minivans with air bags, and for not moving more quickly to
make them standard equipment for front-seat passengers in cars.
Chrysler is providing driver-side air bags in virtually all of its
1991 cars.
   Honda has announced it will make air bags standard equipment in
all cars in 1994. Currently, the only Honda-built car sold in the
United States with an air bag is the top-of-the-line Acura Legend.
   According to industry projections for the current model year, 45
percent of Ford's cars and 33 percent of General Motors' cars will
be sold with at least a driver air bag. Six companies, BMW, Isuzu,
Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Saab, and Volvo, equip all their U.S. cars
with air bags, while five others - Hyundai, Peugeot, Suzuki,
Sterling and Yugo - have no such models.
   The figure for Toyota is 27 percent, for Nissan 20 percent, for
Mazda 15 percent, and for Mitsubishi, 1 percent.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Bill To Pay Reparations to Seneca Indians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Seneca Indians would receive millions of
dollars in back rents on leased lands under a bill approved by the
Senate.
   The bill directs the federal government to pay $35 million to
the Senecas, admitting that Congress wrongly forced the tribe to
lease its land for 115 years to the city of Salamanca, N.Y.
   ``We took advantage of the Seneca Nation and now we ought to
correct this injustice,'' said Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., one
of the Senate sponsors.
   The bill was adopted on a voice vote late Tuesday. It passed the
House on Oct. 10.
   The Bush administration has said the government is not
financially liable for the low rents paid to the Senecas and
opposes the measure because of its cost. President Bush has 10 days
in which to sign it, veto it or simply allow it to pass into law
unsigned.
   The bill would ratify an agreement reached by Salamanca, three
nearby villages and the Seneca Nation to replace a 99-year lease
accord expiring Feb. 19, 1991.
   Under the agreements, about 85 percent of the city of Salamanca
is leased from the Senecas at rents that were frozen as low as $1
per year.
   The state of New York must also pay $25 million, which will
require state legislation.

<HEAD>Existing Technologies Could Slow Global Warming, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boosting energy efficiency and stopping the
destruction of forests around the world could prevent the most
disastrous consequences of global warming and save money, says a
new report.
   The report, prepared for delivery to the Second World Climate
Conference in Geneva beginning Oct. 29, says the technical means to
slow global warming are here.
   ``Whether those technologies get implemented depends on the
agressiveness of policies,'' said Michael Oppenheimer, one of the
report's authors. ``Some of this can be done at a cost saving,
because some of the technologies are cheaper to use than what we
already use.''
   For instance, energy efficiency measures can cut energy use,
thereby reducing the emission of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is
the most important of the so-called greenhouse gases, which warm
the atmosphere by trapping the sun's heat like the windows of a
greenhouse.
   ``It is projected by us that energy use will double by 2020 if
no action is taken,'' Oppenheimer said. ``We can cut that growth in
half by simply implementing energy efficiency measures which are
cost effective.''
   The report concludes that a rise in world temperatures of 2
degrees may be inevitable. But it says every effort should be made
to avoid rises higher than that, Oppenheimer said.
   ``A rise of four degrees entails the risk of grave damage to
ecosystems,'' said Oppenheimer, a senior scientist with the
Environmental Defense Fund in New York City.
   ``Those sorts of warmings also entail rapid sea level rise, and
rapid sea level rise is difficult and expensive for society to
respond to,'' he said Wednesday. ``The trouble is, we may be
already be committed to a warming on the order of two degrees
Fahrenheit.''
   Even that level of global warming could cause extensive
ecosystem damage, concluded the scientists, members of the Advisory
Group for Greenhouse Gases.
   The Oct. 29 meeting in Geneva could set the stage for an
international treaty to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, methane
and other greenhouse gases, Oppenheimer said.
   Negotiations on the details of such a treaty are expected to
follow in Washington in February, he said.
   Energy efficiency isn't the only means for reducing global
warming, Oppenheimer said.
   ``We think that a very large emissions reduction can be obtained
by ending deforestation, which we think can be done by the year
2005, and then by planting trees which will suck some carbon
dioxide out of the atmosphere,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Some criticize the snail's pace of the
budget talks on Capitol Hill. Others give it their highest praise.
   The Procrastinators Club of America has given its Procrastinator
of the Year award to President Bush and Congress.
   The club, which champions delayed decisions and postponed
projects, announced the honor Wednesday - and said it will begin
working on a ceremony for the winners sometime in 1992. Or maybe
later.
   Bush and Congress did ``an outstanding job'' of putting things
off, said club president Les Waas.
   ``The procrastinators were aware of what was going on with our
taxes because we eventually read Bush's lips,'' Waas said. ``But we
also like Congress, and people in politics, because they are just
like us, they procrastinate.''
   The Procrastinators Club, established in 1956 by employees at a
   Philadelphia advertising agency, says it has about 8,500 members
and half-million who haven't found the time to sign up.
   The award was accompanied by advice for the president and
Congress:
   ``Spend the money first,'' Waas said, ``then determine the
budget later. That way, they will always come out even and without
any need for quibbling.''
   Previous winners included comedian Jack Benny for putting off
turning 40 for so many years and topless dancer Julie Gibson - the
first winner in 1957 - for always putting things off.

<HEAD>Dollar Plunges Further, Stocks Surge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar's continuing plunge took it to a
22-month low against the Japanese yen in Tokyo today, while stock
prices surged for the fourth consecutive day.
   The dollar closed at 124.40 yen, down 1.40 yen from Wednesday's
125.80-yen finish and its lowest close since 124.05 yen on Jan. 4,
1989. The dollar has now fallen 13.55 yen in the last 13 trading
days.
   After opening at 125.60 yen, it ranged between 124.15 yen and
125.85 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where the yen's rise encouraged
buying, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average finished at 24,367.08,
up 507.72 points, or 2.13 percent. The close was the highest for
the blue chip index since 24,365.60 points on Sept. 17.
   Trading was energetic, and volume on the first section was
estimated at 700 million shares, up from 590 million Wednesday and
the highest since June.
   ``The strong yen is definitely the predominant sentiment,'' said
Katsumi Oshima, a researcher at Sanyo Securities.
   The dollar's dip to the 124-yen level at one point in New York
Wednesday had a psychological effect, he said. The dollar closed at
125.43 yen in New York.
   Traders said many factors discouraged investment in dollars,
including the American deficit, declining support for President
Bush and the Middle East crisis.
   Oshima said the dollar is likely to fall to 120 yen before the
end of the year.
   Recent reports that Bank of Japan officials favor the yen's rise
helped drive the currency up, traders said. Meanwhile, the dollar
was hurt by remarks by U.S. officials that a lower dollar could
help boost American exports by making them cheaper overseas.
   ``The strong yen is the main factor today behind the stock
prices. The other factor is the drop in interest rates. The market
has recovered notably, both in strength and volume,'' said
Masayoshi Yano, a dealer at Nikko Securities Co.

<TEXT>
   A right-wing Hindu party has threatened
to pull out of Prime Minister V.P. Singh's already shaky government
in a dispute over a holy site claimed by both Hindus and Moslems.
   The threat Wednesday by the Bharatiya Janata, or Indian People's
Party, raised fears that the coalition government will collapse
next month, less than a year after taking office.
   The Bharatiya Janata Party said it would withdraw support if the
government tries to stop a Hindu procession to the northern town of
Ayodhya intends to dismantle a mosque and replace it with a Hindu
temple.
   ``This is not a communal issue. It is a matter of national
honor,'' the party said in a resolution passed at an emergency
metting.
   The National Front government has repeatedly said it will not
allow the mosque's demolition.
   Lal Krishna Advani, head of the Bharatiya Janata Party, plans to
lead thousands of Hindus to Auodhya, 300 miles east of New Delhi,
on Oct. 30 and begin the temple construction.
   Hindu fundamentalists claim the mosque, known as Babri Masjid,
replaced a temple destroyed in the 16th century by Moghul
conquerers. Moslem leaders dispute the claim and refuse to leave
the site.
   Advani is traveling across India to build public opinion for
what he calls a case of majority rights. He has completed half of
the 6,000-mile journey in a Toyota pickup converted to look like a
chariot and used during festivals to carry Hindu idols.
   Hindus represent 82 percent of India's 880 million people, while
Moslems represent only 12 percent. Members of the two faiths
commonly clash in most Indian states, leaving dozens of people dead
every year.
   Earlier Wednesday, Singh called a multiparty meeting to resolve
the issue, but it was boycotted by the Bharatiya Janata Party and
the Congress Party of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, which is
now in opposition.
   Other parties passed a resolution at the meeting that said the
government was committed to protecting the mosque.
   Singh's government relies for its survival on the support of the
Bharatiya Janata Party and the Left Front, a coalition of Communist
parties. Withdrawal of support by either group would topple the
government.
   The National Front, a loose coalition of five parties, took
office Dec. 2, 1989, after no party was able to get a clear
majority in national elections the previous month.
   The Bharatiya Janata Party also used the resolution to criticize
the government's performance in the last 10 months, citing rising
prices, growing separatism in Punjab and Kashmir and street
protests by upper-caste Hindus against the government's job policy
that favors lower castes.

<HEAD>Rare Bird Flies Atlantic Only To Die On Hitting Bird Sanctuary
Door</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SLIMBRIDGE, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rare bird that apparently flew
3,000 miles across the Atlantic was killed when it crashed into a
plate-glass door at one of Britain's leading bird sanctuaries, the
facility reported.
   The gray-cheeked thrush is thought to have been blown off course
while migrating from its summer home in Canada to South America,
ornithologist Basil Hughes said Wednesday.
   It died Sunday when it flew into the door of the visitors'
center at the headquarters of the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust at
Slimbridge in the county of Gloucestershire in western England,
Hughes said.
   Hughes, a researcher with the trust at Slimbridge, said a man
selling nesting boxes heard a loud thud and then watched the
six-inch-long bird fall to the ground.
   Hughes identified it as one of the northern sub-species of
gray-cheeked thrush from its drab olive color, speckled breast and
white underside.
   He has preserved the body in a refrigerator so that it can be
stuffed by a taxidermist and put on permanent display.
   ``If it had survived there would have been thousands of
twitchers (bird watchers) traveling from all over the country to
see it,'' he said.
   Hughes said the bird apparently became disoriented after winds
blew it off course last week as it flew south.
   Strong winds, occasional gales and a succession of mild winters
have been responsible for the appearance in Britain of a succession
of birds rarely seen in this country in recent years,
ornithologists say.

   Radical students armed with steel
pipes, firebombs and clubs tried to storm the U.S. Embassy today
but were quickly arrested by riot police.
   Police said one protester was injured. U.S. officials reported
no injuries or damage inside the compound. The sidewalk about 10
yards from one of the embassy's entrance was scorched by firebombs.
   About 50 people, mostly Koreans, were waiting outside for the
offices to open when 11 students launched the attack, witnesses
said.
   ``They tried to throw the firebombs over the walls and they
waved big sticks,'' one man said.
   Witnesses said the students bumped their van against an iron
barricade near the embassy's visa section and tried to scale the
walls from the van's roof.
   Riot police quickly surrounded and arrested the assailants. The
protesters scattered anti-U.S. leaflets before being driven into a
police bus to a nearby police station, police said.
   The protesters were members of Chondaehyop, a nationwide
alliance of radical students. Among the slogans they shouted was
``Oppose Uruguay Round!'' - a reference to the multinational trade
negotiations designed to remove trade barriers.
   South Korean dissidents and farmers say the free trade talks
favor the United States and other industrialized nations. Farmers
worry they won't be able to compete with cheaper imports if South
Korea opens its agricultural markets.
   The embassy compound is surrounded by stone walls about
12-feet-high topped by additional wire fencing. It cannot be
entered without passing through locked doors that are heavily
guarded. Korean riot police are stationed outside the compound 24
hours a day.
   Radical students have also staged violent protests demanding the
withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in Korea. They claim
the troops hinder talks on unification with North Korea.

<HEAD>Iraq Denies Reports of `Inhumanity' in Kuwait</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq has acknowledged that there might have
been ``isolated'' displays of ``inhumanity'' by its soldiers in
Kuwait but denied that they represent government policy.
   Responding to reports of mistreatment of people in Kuwait -
including alleged summary executions, beheadings and stripping
babies from incubators - Iraq's embassy in Washington denied that
any such incidents were widespread and said it was the government's
policy to ``observe basic human rights.''
   The statement released Wednesday was the most thorough of any
Iraqi denials of the reports, which came mostly from refugees in
Kuwait, including some who testified before Congressman Tom Lantos'
Committee on Human Rights.
   Some Western and Kuwaiti leaders have used the atrocity reports
to press for military action to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait, which it
overran in an Aug. 2 invasion.
   ``We were taken aback by the widely reported stories of flagrant
and rampant disregard for human rights which these reports asserted
were committed by our servicemen,'' the embassy statement said.
   ``While we acknowledge that in any conflict which involves the
use of force, there are likely to be isolated incidents in which
individuals misinterpret their mission and display inhumanity, we
categorically deny that such incidents, if they occurred, represent
any official policy of any level of our government.
   ``Moreover, we dismiss any suggestion that there have been
widespread such incidents,'' the statement said.
   It accused the media of reporting the congressional hearing
testimony ``without examining the reasons why the hearings were
conducted, the veracity of witnesses or the lack of completeness of
the testimony.''
   The statement said at least one American who had been in Kuwait
at the time of the invasion, Dr. Mohammed Said, was refused an
opportunity to testify before Lantos' committee although he would
have disputed some of the other testimony.
   ``It is the policy of the Republic of Iraq to observe basic
human rights. Anyone who is found to have committed any of the acts
would be dealt with according to our laws,'' the embassy statement
said.
   ``The war mongers who slander Iraq with propaganda about
make-believe atrocities in a kind of pep rally to build enthusiasm
for the big game will have to dispose of the ashes of the bonfire
built from their youth,'' it said.

<HEAD>Arkansas Prison Chief Thomas Murton Dead at 62</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEER CREEK, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thomas Murton, the controversial
reform-minded Arkansas prisons chief who was the inspiration for
the Robert Redford movie ``Brubaker,'' has died of cancer at age
62.
   He died Oct. 10 at the Veterans Administration Hospital in
Oklahoma City. He was buried here Saturday.
   Murton, who advocated treating prisoners with respect and
opposed the death penalty, rose to prominence as head of Cummins
State Prison in Arkansas in the 1960s. Gov. Winthrop Rockefeller
appointed him head of the prison system in 1967.
   Redford's 1980 role in ``Brubaker'' - as a reform-minded prisons
chief who gets little support from his state's political
establishment - was loosely based on Murton's career in Arkansas.
   A year after Murton's appointment, a national scandal erupted
when authorities dug up three bodies at Cummins that a prisoner
claimed belonged to fellow inmates. The prisoner said they had been
beaten and shot by trusties and guards.
   Murton said he believed as many as 200 inmates were buried on
the grounds, but only the three bodies were found. Police and a
forensic anthropologist said they had been buried in what was an
old but well-known paupers' grave.
   Rockefeller accused Murton of turning the investigation into a
``sideshow,'' and a grand jury accused him of seeking publicity for
himself.
   Murton left Arkansas shortly thereafter, forming the Murton
Foundation for Criminal Justice in 1968.
   He acknowledged years later that the foundation, designed to
help current and former inmates and officers who had suffered
abuses in the prison system, never was successful.
   Through most of the 1970s Murton taught criminology at the
University of Minnesota and later worked on his mother's farm.
   He wrote two books, ``Accomplices to the Crime: The Arkansas
Prison Scandal'' and ``The Dilemma of Prison Reform.''
   Survivors include his father, mother and four children.

<HEAD>ANC Turning to Big Business for Financial Help, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The African National Congress,
which for years has called for nationalizing big business, is now
asking corporations for financial help, a newspaper reported today.
   ANC leaders, including Nelson Mandela, have approached at least
two major corporations in South Africa and are expected to approach
a third soon, said Business Day, the country's leading financial
daily.
   No financial commitments have been made, the newspaper said,
quoting unidentified business sources.
   Corporate representatives said they were wary of offering money,
given the ANC's past hostility toward big business.
   ``We would certainly first demand answers to questions about
their intentions on economic policy, and particularly whether they
expect us to support a party whose strategy is to break us up,'' it
quoted one business spokesman as saying.
   For years, the ANC supported nationalizing mines, banks and
other large businesses. Recently it has been more vague, saying
utilities should be nationalized and the future of other
corporations left open to debate.
   The ANC has an ideological preference for socialism, saying
there is an urgent need to bridge the gap between white wealth and
black poverty.
   But the anti-apartheid organization has acknowledged that the
private sector will play an important role in creating jobs and
other opportunities for the country's 30 million blacks.
   According to Business Day, the ANC is hoping to raise millions
of dollars to pay for a range of activities, including resettlement
of returning exiles and the purchase of office equipment.
   It said one of the businesses approached was Anglo-American, a
gold-mining corporation that is South Africa's largest
conglomerate. Anglo-American chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson met
with Mandela on Oct. 3. The company refused to comment on the
meeting.
   Another large South African corporation has been asked for
money, and a third expects to be approached soon, Business Day
said. Representatives of both spoke to Business Day on condition
the corporations not be identified.
   Both said the idea of funding party political activities also
was of concern, and they might be inclined to limit donations to
social projects, such as resettlement of exiles.

<HEAD>New York's Fiscal Savior of '70s Says City Again Facing Crisis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The fiscal watchdog who helped rescue New York
from the brink of bankruptcy 15 years ago says the city is spending
its way toward an even worse financial crisis - and he's getting
out now.
   Felix Rohatyn, who has run the Municipal Assistance Corporation
since its creation in 1975, said Wednesday he will step down as
chairman at the end of the year.
   The 62-year-old investment banker said he wants to spend more
time with his wife, who is recovering from surgery, but he also
expressed frustration at his inability to persuade Mayor David
Dinkins of the seriousness of the city's troubles.
   He said the city's problems are financial, economic and social
and are of proportions that ``I haven't seen in 40 years.''
   Dinkins replied, ``Reasonable people can differ. I don't know
that his position and mind are so far apart anyway.''
   Rohatyn has headed MAC since its creation in 1975 to assist the
city by using sales tax revenues to back municipal bonds. New York
was near bankruptcy at the time and Rohatyn was one of the
architects of its recovery.
   Among the current financial problems Rohatyn cited are a
predicted budget shortfall of $300 million to $500 million for
fiscal 1991 and a gap for fiscal 1992 that begins at $1.4 billion.
   He also said union leaders are helping lead the city toward
financial ruin by making unrealistic salary demands.
   He urged that a 5.5 percent raise recently promised teachers be
rescinded and the money put into city coffers to strengthen New
York's credit rating.
   Teachers union president Sandra Feldman said Rohatyn ``is really
meddling with things that are not really his affair.''

   The judge in Art Buchwald's lawsuit against
Paramount Pictures named an entertainment accountant to look at the
studio's books.
   Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider is trying to establish how
much Paramount owes Buchwald and his producing partner for their
script that ultimately became the Eddie Murphy blockbuster ``Coming
to America.''
   Franklin Johnson, a managing partner of Price Waterhouse of Los
Angeles, was chosen Wednesday by the judge to help him figure out
how risky moviemaking is.
   The judge previously ruled that Paramount stole Buchwald's idea
and owes him a share of the profits.
   Paramount claims that the film, which has grossed some $300
million, has never shown a net profit and Buchwald and his partner,
Alain Bernheim, are owed nothing. The two claim they are owed
between $6.9 million and $14.6 million.
   Paramount says ``winners pay for losers'' in the movie business
and profits from hits are diluted by losses incurred by box office
bombs.

<TEXT>
   Start rummaging for your long underwear,
flannel sheets and electric socks. The ninth annual Lee County
Woolly Worm Survey, issued today, says there's a cold winter ahead.
   The folksy forecast of Kentucky's winter weather is based on the
coloring of caterpillars, known locally as woolly worms. The number
of foggy mornings in August, inner designs of persimmon seeds and
the height of hornet's nests also are factored into the forecast.
   ``The Lee County woolly worms are never in error,'' said
Rosemary Porter Kilduff of Beattyville in rural eastern Kentucky.
   Mrs. Kilduff compiles woolly worm sightings in and about Lee
County and releases the winter forecast in time for Lee County's
annual Woolly Worm Festival, which begins Friday.
   Organizers expect Lee County's population of 7,000 will double
with visitors for the woolly worm races, crafts show and a '50s
street dance. A parade will feature Tasha Harris of Beattyville,
Miss Woolly Worm Festival Queen for 1990.
   Lee County residents hope the caterpillar's predictions someday
will gain the same status in forecasting as Punxsutawney Phil.
Movements of the Pennsylvania groundhog foretell the coming of
spring on Groundhog Day.
   This fall, 88 of the 188 woolly worms sighted were black.
   ``With black in the lead, it pains me to say that we can predict
a very, very cold winter from beginning to quit,'' Mrs. Kilduff
said.
   The 25 foggy mornings in August mean there will be 25 days of
snow. A sighting of a hornet's nest low to the ground means the
snow won't stay around long, she added.
   The communities of Vermilion, Ohio, and Banner Elk, N.C., also
forecast winter's severity with the caterpillars. Vermilion
forecaster Willis ``Goodnews'' Gebheart predicted chilly weather
for Ohio after examining the bugs, called woollybears up North.
   ``The thick overcoats on the Ohio woollybears are as dark as a
tax collector's heart - the sign of an unusual snowy and cold
winter,'' he wrote in a Beattyville weekly paper.
   Mrs. Kilduff turns the Woolly Worm survey over to the National
Weather Service station in nearby Jackson to aid in their
forecasting.
   Gil Russell, official in charge of the station, promised to take
Mrs. Kilduff's forecast into consideration. Last year, the woolly
worm forecast accurately predicted an early cold winter in
Kentucky, followed by a warming trend. But the worms' prediction of
a harsh ending to winter didn't occur.
   ``There are some things I hear in folklore that I can make some
kind of scientific reason for, but woolly worms is not one of
them,'' Russell said.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said today that it is willing to
sell its oil to all sides in the Persian Gulf conflict, including
the United States, for $21 per barrel, OPEC's benchmark price
before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   The announcement appeared a sign that Iraq was feeling the pinch
of the U.N.-ordered embargo on trade, which is being enforced by a
naval blockade, and seeking to entice nations into abandoning the
alliance arrayed against it.
   Iraq already has offered to give oil free of charge to Third
World countries, but there have been no reports of any takers.
   Oil had been Iraq's only significant source of export earnings
and Baghdad is not now able to sell its crude on the open market.
   Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Chalabi proposed that payments for
Iraqi oil be placed in an escrow fund because of the U.N.
sanctions.
   ``We accept that the price of sold oil is not to be transfered
to Iraq but to deposit according to a special arrangement, and Iraq
will not deal with it normally until we get over this crisis, and
when the problems settle down on the bases of relations empty from
any crisis,'' Chalabi said.
   Chalabi said the offer was made to stem the rise of world oil
prices.
   He said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein approved the measure to
fulfill Iraq's ``humanitarian role.''
   Oil has nearly doubled in price to about $40 per barrel since
Iraq touched off the crisis by seizing oil-rich Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The Iraqi announcement appeared aimed at trying to get countries
that are feeling the economic pinch of high oil prices to losing
their resolve and abandon the embargo on trade with Iraq.
   A prominent Kuwaiti economist, Jassem al-Saadoun of the al-Shall
financial house, estimated Wednesday that the U.N. embargo is
costing the Iraqis $54 million a day.
   Prior to the invasion, Iraq's OPEC production quota was 3.1
million barrels of crude oil a day. Much of that, and Kuwait's
production of 1.5 million barrels a day, has been replaced on the
world market by production increases by Saudi Arabia and other OPEC
countries.
   With the invasion, Iraq increased its share of world oil
reserves to about 20 percent.

Grunseth releasing affidavits denying impropriety at 1981 party</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gubernatorial candidate Jon Grunseth has
released affidavits from 16 people who attended a 1981 party to
counter allegations that he swam nude with four teen-age girls.
   ``To the best of my recollection, the allegations of
improprieties involving Jon Grunseth simply did not occur,''
Richard Chant said, a senior vice president of People Management,in
an affidavit.
   Liane Nelson, 23, of Boston, and her cousin, Elizabeth Dwyer
Mulay, 22, of San Jose, Calif., have alleged in sworn statements
that Grunseth encouraged them, his daughter Nina, now 23, and Lisa
Hare, now 25, to join him for a nude swim. Nelson was 14 at the
time; Mulay was 13.
   Hare has confirmed most of the allegations raised by Nelson and
Mulay, while Nina Grunseth has signed an affidavit denying them.
   According to all the affidavits prepared on Grunseth's behalf,
the party was a wholesome, family event, with the focal point being
the swimming pool. They said they observed none of the activities
alleged by the women, although about half of them said they left
the party by midnight.
   William and Ingrid Emstad said they stayed overnight at the
Grunseth home in a room overlooking the pool.
   ``From approximately midnight until the morning, I did not
observe or hear anyone in the pool,'' Emstad said.
   Grunseth and his campaign officials consistently have blamed
Gov. Rudy Perpich for the accusations, saying they are part of a
``win-at-any-costs'' strategy.
   Nelson and Mulay have denied any contact with the Perpich
campaign, and Perpich and his campaign officials have denied any
connection to the matter.

<TEXT>
   The U.N. secretary general was quoted
today as saying the Security Council can authorize the use of
military power in the Persian Gulf if the trade embargo fails to
force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   ``The U.N. Charter's Article 42 permits military action. Should
the Security Council come to that decision, that would be
completely legal,'' the weekly news magazine Stern quoted Javier
Perez de Cuellar as saying.
   He said it's up to the Security Council to decide whether
military action is needed or to wait and see whether the embargo
against Iraq eventually forces it to leave Kuwait, Stern reported.
   ``It (the Security Council) can't strengthen the embargo and
sanctions against Iraq, because everything possible has already
been done,'' he was quoted as saying in an interview in New York.
   The U.N. chief reportedly said, ``At the moment I see little
movement in the direction of a peaceful solution.''
   He added, however, ``I will never be the first one to say there
remains only a military solution of the conflict,'' Stern reported.

   The ``tabloid TV'' notoriety of a
former Playboy waitress and policewoman convicted of murdering her
husband's ex-wife helped lead to her capture three months after she
escaped from prison.
   Lawrencia ``Bambi'' Bembenek, 31, was arrested at an apartment
in Thunder Bay, Ontario, on Wednesday on a tip from a viewer of
last week's episode of ``America's Most Wanted.''
   Ms. Bembenek, who has steadfastly professed her innocence, was
captured with her fiance, Dominic Gugliatto, 34.
   Her flight had thrilled supporters in Milwaukee - prompting
sales of T-shirts that read, ``Run, Bambi, Run'' - and was covered
on several ``tabloid TV'' shows, which played up her looks and the
romantic elements of the escape.
   ``I think all the TV shows that have aired this thing in regard
to Bembenek and Gugliatto have romanticized, and that concerned me
a little bit early on - that people were getting so hung up on
whether she was guilty or innocent that it kind of detracted from
what we had to do, which was catch her,'' said Lt. Edwin Sheppard
of the Fond du Lac Sheriff's Department.
   But ``obviously in this case, it's a success story for
`America's Most Wanted,' '' he said. ``We're glad they chose to do
it.''
   Ms. Bembenek and Gugliatto, who had scheduled a prison chapel
wedding before the escape, were being held without bail. Sheriff
James Gilmore said extradition proceedings could begin next week.
   ``I wish she would have got away,'' said Deter Day, 32, of
Milwaukee. ``She was dealt injustice by the Wisconsin judicial
system, and I think the case should be looked into further.''
  ``I hope she enjoyed her freedom while she had it,'' said Ann
Martel, 31, also of Milwaukee.
   An anonymous tip from a California man the fugitive had served
while working as a waitress led to the arrest, authorities said.
   Thunder Bay Detective Ron Arthurs, pursuing the tip, interviewed
Ms. Bembenek on Wednesday at the restaurant where she had worked
since July 23.
   When her only piece of identification, a birth certificate,
didn't check out, officers went to her apartment and found the
couple about to move on, Gilmore said.
   ``She obviously made a call: `Pack up let's go.' The car was
packed. They think it was probably five minutes'' before they would
have fled, the sheriff said.
   Once a waitress at the now-defunct Playboy Club in Lake Geneva,
Ms. Bembenek became a police officer in Milwaukee in the late
1970s. She was fired in 1980 for lying.
   The following year, Ms. Bembenek was convicted of murder in the
killing of Christine Schultz, the ex-wife of her then-husband,
Elfred Schultz, a Milwaukee detective. They were divorced after her
conviction.
   Prosecutors contended Ms. Schultz, who was bound, gagged and
shot in the back, was murdered because Ms. Bembenek resented the
$700-a-month alimony Schultz was ordered to pay his ex-wife.
   Supporters contend she may have been the victim of a frame-up
because of her knowledge of questionable police activities. They
noted that one of Ms. Schultz's young sons had testified that the
person seen in the house the night of the killing was not Ms.
Bembenek.
   Ms. Bembenek escaped July 15 from the Taycheedah Correctional
Institute near Fond du Lac.
   While on the lam, Ms. Bembenek worked as a waitress at the
Columbia Grill and Tavern and also worked as an aerobics
instructor, said her landlord, Jenny Beck.
   She knew Ms. Bembenek as Jennifer Gazzana, someone who said she
fled Chicago with her husband, Tony, to find a simpler life.
   ``They were disenchanted with the American way of life,'' Ms.
Beck said. ``She certainly didn't like the violence in the
states.''
   She described her tenant as a friend, a hard worker and a smart,
polite, beautiful woman. ``I felt safe having her in the house,''
Ms. Beck said.
   Gugliatto, a lawn mower factory worker from suburban Milwaukee,
faces a charge of aiding Ms. Bembenek's escape and a possible
five-year sentence, authorities said. Ms. Bembenek could have five
years added to her life prison term.
   Ms. Bembenek was one of 122 fugitives apprehended after being
profiled on ``America's Most Wanted'' since the show began in 1988,
said Jack Breslin, spokesman for the Fox Broadcasting Co. show.
   ``It was a phenomenal amount of interest, not only in terms of
local interest, but in national interest,'' said Jon Wendt, FBI
agent in charge of the bureau's Milwaukee office. ``It was far
beyond our normal interest in an unlawful flight.''

   There ought to be a law: Sisters can't open

   Those were among the ideas for new legislation offered to Gov.
Neil Goldschmidt by about 3,500 youngsters from throughout the
state who gathered on the Capitol lawn Wednesday to celebrate
Children's Day in Oregon.
   Some other suggestions read by children at the celebration:
   - Restaurants must have computers so patrons can order their
food easily.
   - If you are in an airplane crash and survive, you should get
your money back.
   - All official announcements must be written in Spanish, too.
   Goldschmidt wore a Groucho Marx nose and glasses - his ``Arthur

Oct. 17 as Children's Day in Oregon.
   Cake, ice cream, songs, face painting, magic displays and puppet

   Fourteen members of a bankrupt Soviet all-star
circus have applied for political asylum, and hope to restart their
troupe in the United States.
   The members of the Great Circus Bim Bom - nine performers and
crew members and their families - applied for political asylum
Wednesday, claiming they would be treated unfairly and blocked from
pursuing their careers if they returned to the Soviet Union.
   Tom Fischer, regional director of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said they were granted a one-year work
permit as the INS began a 90-day evaluation.
   The circus members said they would take whatever jobs they could
find to earn money to restart their troupe.
   ``The circus was our life. We will do anything to get it back,''
said Vadim Lomakin, whose act included chimpanzees who can ski.
   Last spring, 118 members of Bim Bom began a two-year tour of the
United States. But they ran into problems with the tour promoter
and went bankrupt after just two U.S. performances. Financial
backers then pulled out and creditors seized the animals and
equipment.
   Bankrupt, the circus came here in May, hoping to raise money and
get the show back on the road.
   Three months later, they were rescued. The promoter of the rival
Moscow Circus paid some of Bim Bom's debts and brought most of its
performers and their families home. Last week, most of the animals
and equipment were returned to Moscow, said Dale Schwartz, an
immigration lawyer representing the remaining members.
   Circus director Yuri Turkin said the four Bim Bom families who
remained are afraid to return because Soviet newspapers are blaming
the circus' failure on the performers who refused to return home.
   ``The Ministry of Culture of the Soviet Union is blaming the
situation on the circus members who stayed in the United States,
even though the circus wasn't given one dollar or any help at all
to get out of trouble by the government,'' Turkin said. ``If we
went back, we would never be able to perform our art again.''

   A Cabinet minister whose racial remarks infuriated
American blacks has sent a letter of apology to black U.S.
lawmakers who demanded that he step down, Foreign Ministry
officials said today.
   A group of Japanese legislators, meanwhile, said today they
planned to visit the United States to explain the remarks made by
Justice Minister Seiroku Kajiyama, who compared blacks to
prostitutes.
   Kajiyama's letter of apology was delivered Wednesday in
Washington by Japanese Ambassador Ryohei Murata to Rep. Ronald
Dellums, D-Calif., officials said. Dellums chairs the 24-member
U.S. Congresional Black Caucus.
   Murata asked Dellums to reconsider the caucus' resolution urging
President Bush to demand Kajiyama's resignation and an official
apology from Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, a ministry official
said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Murata had not yet received a reply.
   Kaifu has expressed regret and rebuked Kajiyama but refused to
fire him. The caucus resolution was presented to the House of
Representatives shortly after Kajiyama's racial slur on Sept. 21.
   Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, told a news conference today that the party will
send a group of lawmakers to the United States on Sunday.
   Ozawa said the delegation will meet with congressional leaders,
including the Black Caucus, in hope of heading off the resolution
demanding Kajiyama's resignation. He said passage of the resolution
``could damage the relations between Japan and the United States.''
   After a police roundup of foreign prostitutes in Tokyo, Kajiyama
compared the prostitutes to blacks in the United States.
   ``The area is becoming mixed just like in America where blacks
move in and whites are forced out,'' he told reporters.
   In his letter, Kajiyama said there was no intent of racial
discrimination behind his comment, but ``I learned again how deeply
I have hurt the feelings of the American people, particular of the
African-Americans.
   ``What I thoughtlessly said on Sept. 21 was wrong and grossly
improper,'' he added. ``Although I am acutely aware how difficult
it is to heal the wounds that my remarks inflicted, I will
personally do whatever I can to strengthen Japan's relationship
with the African-American community.''
   Ambassadors from six African countries sent a letter of protest
to Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama. Black residents' groups in Japan
demonstrated in front of the Justice Ministry.
   In the United States, civil rights groups launched a boycott of
Japanese products, and the mayor of Trenton, N.J., Douglas Palmer,
said a planned visit by a delegation of the Tokyo metropolitan
government was not welcome. The Japanese officials had been
scheduled to visit the city to study garbage-disposal methods.
   Kajiyama is the latest Japanese politician to offend minorities
with public racial remarks.
   In 1986, then Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said Americans
have a lower intelligence level than Japanese because the
population includes a considerable number of blacks, Puerto Ricans
and Mexicans.
   In 1988, former Finance Minister Michio Watanabe said American
blacks have few qualms about going bankrupt and implied that tey
walk away from debts.

   A 477-year-old manuscript taken from Germany by an
American soldier at the end of World War II has been returned to
its homeland.
   The law firm Andrews &amp; Kurth said Wednesday the Evangelister
manuscript, noted for its silver cover containing the figure of
Jesus Christ, was returned earlier this month and is being restored
in Munich.
   American soldier Joe T. Meador, who died in 1980, brought the
manuscript and several other items to America in 1945 from
Quedlinburg. They eventually wound up in the hands of First
National Bank of Whitewright.
   This is the second piece of Quedlinburg treasure recovered by
the German Cultural Foundation of the States. The Samuhel Gospels,
made in the 10th century, was recovered in Switzerland for a $3
million finder's fee, according to reports from the New York Times.
   The Lutheran Church is suing for the return of the other works,
which are being held in a Dallas museum.

   The nation's 40 million Social Security
recipients will see their benefit checks increase by 5.4 percent
starting in January, the biggest advance in 8{ years, the
government said today.
   That increase will translate into an extra $31 per month for the
average retired worker, whose monthly check will increase from $571
to $602.
   The maximum monthly benefit for a worker retiring in 1991 at age
65 will rise by $47, to $1,022.
   Since 1975, benefits have risen automatically each year, keeping
pace with the annual inflation rate with the exception of six
months in 1983 that were skipped to help bail the Social Security
system out of a crisis.
   The exact size of the 1991 increase became official today when
the Labor Department announced September's 0.8 percent increase in
the Consumer Price Index, the inflation measure used to determine
cost-of-living increases for the Social Security program.
   The 5.4 percent increase, which will show up in the Jan. 3
benefit checks, followed a 4.7 percent increase that took effect
last January and a 4 percent increase in 1989.
   It was the largest increase since a 7.4 percent jump in July
1982, when high inflation rates translated into bigger
cost-of-living increases.
   The 5.4 percent increase in 1991 also applies to the nation's
4.5 million recipients of Supplemental Security Income, which
provides a minimum income floor for poor people who are aged, blind
or disabled.
   The maximum federal SSI payment will rise by $21, to $407 per
month, for an individual and by $31, to $610, for a couple.
   The government also said today that the maximum amount of wages
subject to the payroll tax that finances Social Security benefits
will climb from $51,300 to $53,400 next year.
   That change will boost taxes for about 10 million higher-income
workers who earn above the current wage cap.
   The tax rate of 7.65 percent, which finances both the Social
Security and Medicare programs, would remain unchanged next year.
   But higher-income workers may still see a bigger bite taken out
of their paychecks, depending on what type of deficit-reduction
bill finally emerges from Congress.
   Both the House and Senate are considering proposals to boost the
amount of wages subject to the Medicare portion of the payroll tax.
The House measure would increase the wage cap to $100,000.
   However, neither chamber is considering trimming Social Security
benefit checks as a way of reducing the huge federal deficit.
   Even though Social Security is the government's biggest spending
program after national defense, efforts to cut benefits in the past
have triggered a heavy backlash from retirees.
   The Social Security Administration gave these examples of how
the 5.4 percent increase will affect average monthly benefits:
   -Aged couple, both getting benefits: up $52, to $1,022.
   -Widowed mother and two children: up $62, to $1,203.
   -Disabled worker, spouse and children: up $52, to $1,022.
   -All disabled workers: up $30, to $587.
   ``For the 42 million people who receive Social Security and
Supplemental Security Income checks each month, this cost-of-living
adjustment will be their assurance that those checks will continue
to allow them to pay for needed goods and services,'' said Social
Security Commissioner Gwendolyn S. King.
   At the start of this year, Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
attracted attention with a proposal to reduce the Social Security
payroll tax to reflect the fact that the system is producing more
revenue for the federal government than Social Security is paying
out in benefits - an estimated $74 billion more for the 1991 fiscal
year.
   However, with lawmakers trying to bridge a yawning budget gap,
Moynihan's proposal to cut Social Security taxes never advanced in
Congress.
   The payroll tax was 1 percent of income up to $3,000 when Social
Security started in 1937. It stayed at that rate until 1950 but has
been boosted since that time with the current rate set by a 1983
rescue plan passed by Congress to bail the system out of recurrent
financing problems.

<TEXT>
   Government bulldozers today began
dismantling the oldest section of the so-called Green Line that has
divided Beirut into Moslem and Christian sectors for more than 15
years.
   Police said government troops were removing mines along the
heavily fortified 1.2-mile strip that has separated the Christian
district of Ein Rummaneh and the Moslem quarter of Shiyah since the
civil war broke out.
   Government bulldozers were also dismantling other parts of the
Green Line and reopening roads linking the Christian and Moslem
sectors of the capital and the central mountains to the east and
northeast, police said.
   The demarcation line began taking shape April 13, 1975, when
Moslems in Shiyah opened fire at Christians in Ein Rummaneh, in
retaliation for an attack by Christian militiamen of the Phlange
party that had killed 27 Palestinians and wounded 19.
   President Elias Hrawi's government decided to reunify Beirut
after crushing rebel Christian Gen. Michel Aoun's mutiny in an air
and ground assault Saturday that police said left 160 dead and
about 800 wounded.
   Most of Aoun's 15,000 troops declared allegiance to Hrawi's army
under Gen. Emile Lahoud. At least six of the defeated general's
intelligence officers were known to have been arrested by Syrian
troops.
   Meanwhile, Aoun was spending a sixth day holed up in the French
Embassy in Beirut's Christian suburb of Hazmiyeh. Hrawi's
government continued to ask foreign banks to freeze Aoun's accounts
in preparation to bring him to trial.
   France on Saturday granted Aoun asylum, but Lebanon said it will
not allow him to leave and that he has to face a court of law for
war crimes and the alleged theft of $75 million from the ailing
state treasury.
   Voice of the Nation, the Moslem radio station, said today that
Aoun's stay in the embassy was ``expected to be long.''
   ``No settlement is in the offing to the diplomatic differences
between Lebanon and France over Aoun,'' the radio said.
   In Paris today, riot police removed about 50 Lebanese
demonstrators from the Lebanese Embassy, which they had occupied
for five days in a show of support for Aoun. Police said there was
no violence.
   Hrawi's government plans to create a militia-free zone covering
the capital's Moslem and Christian sectors and their immediate
suburbs as the first step toward disbanding militias in the country
and ending the civil war.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations, said contacts were under way with commanders of
leftist militias to withdraw them from the 80-square-mile area
formerly controlled by Aoun.
   The leftist newspaper As-Safir said Hrawi will visit the Syrian
capital, Damascus, ``in the coming few days'' for talks with
President Hafez Assad on the plan. Syria is the main power broker
in Lebanon with 40,000 troops deployed mainly in predominantly
Moslem sectors under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 21-nation
Arab League.
   Hrawi's plan would be in line with an Arab League-brokered peace
pact to disband all the warring militias and end the war, which has
killed more than 150,000 people.
   The peace pact, ratified by Parliament in August 1989, divides
power equally between Moslems and Christians. The nation has a
population of 4 million, belonging to 17 sects.
   Aoun had rejected the peace plan and refused to recognize Hrawi
as head of state, saying the president was a ``Syrian puppet.''

<HEAD>Washington Mayor Suggests Curfew, National Guard Help, To Combat
Crime</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington Mayor Marion Barry, saying that
``something drastically different'' must be done to combat murder
on the capital's streets, has suggested invoking neighborhood
curfews and calling out the National Guard.
   The recent rash of homicides is ``getting out of hand,'' Barry
said Wednesday night after a forum for candidates competing for
at-large seats on the District of Columbia Council. ``We have got
to do something drastically different,''
   ``The police chief is as frustrated about this as I am. We can't
let this keep up,'' he said.
   A total of 373 homicides have been reported so far this year.
Last year a record 434 deaths were reported.
   On Monday, after a weekend during which nine slayings were
recorded, Police Chief Isaac Fulwood Jr. announced that he had
created a unit of 100 officers to fight the problem. That squad is
scheduled to begin operation on Sunday.
   But Barry said that if there was no sign the unit has slowed the
homicide rate after about a month, he would establish a nightly
curfew in neighborhoods where crime and violence are high. If that
plan doesn't work, the National Guard would be called in, he added.
   Barry is one of seven candidates running for two at-large
positions on the council. During his drug and perjury trial this
summer when he was convicted on a misdemeanor charge of cocaine
possession, he announced he would not seek a fourth, four-year
term.
   Council attempts to impose a curfew for anyone under 18 have
been rejected twice this year in the courts.
   Barry's plan, however, is broader than the voided laws. He
suggested the curfew apply not only to juveniles but to all
residents in neighborhoods ``where people are killing each other.''
   Barry has previously rejected calls for National Guard help,
saying in 1988, ``The city is not out of control.''
   Wednesday night, however, he said Guard help may be needed ``if
all else fails.''

   U.N. chief Javier Perez de Cuellar was quoted today as saying he
sees little progress toward peacefully ending the Persian Gulf
crisis. He raised the possibility the Security Council could
authorize military action against Iraq.
   At the United Nations, the five permanent Security Council
members have reached general agreement on a draft resolution that
would require Iraq to pay for damages stemming from its Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, diplomats said today.
   Countries that have suffered serious economic losses stemming
from the invasion - such as Jordan, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh
- could apply for compensation out of Iraq's foreign assets, which
have been frozen, or from future oil earnings, the diplomats said.
   No date has been set for the full Security Council to consider
the matter.
   In an interview with the German news magazine Stern, the
secretary general said the U.N. Security Council ``can't strengthen
the embargo and sanctions against Iraq, because everything possible
has already been done.''
   But Perez de Cuellar added he would ``never be the first one to
say there remains only a military solution of the conflict,'' the
magazine said.
   In Washington, the 12-week-old gulf crisis was blamed for some
bad economic news in the United States.
   The jump in energy prices brought on by the crisis sent
Americans' cost of living up 0.8 percent in September, matching the
increase the month before, the government said. It was also
announced today that the U.S. merchandise trade deficit had jumped
2.4 percent in August, spurred by the high price of oil imports.
   Iraq, meanwhile, said it was willing to sell oil for $21 a
barrel, about half the market price. The announcement appeared
aimed at trying to undermine the U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with
Iraq, imposed to try to force an end to the occupation of Kuwait.
   Iraq already has offered free oil to the Third World, but there
have been no reports of any takers willing to get around a naval
blockade.
   On the diplomatic front, Soviet envoy and Middle East expert
Yevgeny Primakov headed to Washington today for talks with
President Bush.
   ``I remain a prudent optimist,'' Primakov said after talks with
French President Francois Mitterrand in Paris on Wednesday. ``I
think the Iraqi position could still become more flexible.''
   Primakov met in Baghdad with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein last
month and has been quoted as saying Iraq might withdraw from most
of Kuwait as part of a settlement.
   Also today, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived
in Vienna for consultations with his French counterpart, Roland
Dumas, about European security and the gulf crisis.
   Asked by reporters if he was bringing any new ideas to his
meeting with Dumas, Shevardnadze said: ``It's difficult to talk
about new ideas. I have not brought any ready made concept with me.
Nobody has one.''
   In other gulf-related developments:
   -About 250 Japanese police entered the Kyoto University campus
in western Japan and arrested two students occupying the dean's
office. The students were protesting a plan to send Japanese troops
to the gulf region in non-combat roles. Police also said about 80
people rallied outside the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo to protest the
plan, which was introduced this week in Parliament.
   -Three Japanese nationals who had been held in Baghdad but were
given exit visas by the Iraqis arrived in Amman, Jordan, today and
then left for London. A fourth Japanese was scheduled to arrive
later in the day. The Japanese Embassy said 140 Japanese remained
in Kuwait and 185 in Iraq.
   Perez de Cuellar, in his magazine interview, pointed out that
the United Nations legally has the power to authorize military
action against Iraq.
   ``The U.N. Charter's Article 42 permits military action. Should
the Security Council come to that decision, that would be
completely legal,'' Stern quoted the U.N. secretary general as
saying.
   ``At the moment I see little movement in the direction of a
peaceful solution,'' he told the weekly.
   Baghdad seized Kuwait in a dispute over oil, land and money and
now has an estimated 430,000 troops on Kuwaiti soil. Combined with
its own oilfields, Iraq now controls about 20 percent of the
world's crude.
   About 200,000 U.S. soldiers have been sent to region to stand up
to Saddam. They lead a multinational land, air and naval force that
has dug in in the Saudi desert and is enforcing a U.N.-ordered
embargo on trade with Iraq.

   Michigan got its first snow of the season today from a storm
that spread snow and ice across the Dakotas and parts ofMinnesota,
and rain fell across much of the rest of the Midwest.
   Rain also fell in parts of the South early today, and in the
Pacific Northwest.
   The first snow of the season fell in much of Michigan's western
Upper Peninsula early today while cold rain and falling
temperatures hit lower Michigan. The National Weather Service said
3 to 5 inches of snow fell in Houghton and Calumet by 7:45 a.m.
   State Police Sgt. Bob Johnson in Calumet said several vehicles
slid off the road as heavy, wet snow coated roads and hampered
visibility.
   ``It's really treacherous driving out there,'' he said. ``The
first one always catches them by surprise.''
   Elsewhere in Michigan, high wind knocked out power for some
Detroit Edison Co. and Consumers Power Co. customers early this
morning. Consumers Power spokesman Paul Knopick said about 7,800
customers lost service.
   On Wednesday, snow blanketed much of North and South Dakota and
Minnesota, and even northwestern Iowa got about an inch. Up to 5
inches fell in parts of South Dakota, where one traffic death was
blamed on the snow and ice, and an inch remained on the ground
today in Aberdeen, Huron and Sioux Falls.
   Elsewhere today, rain was forecast along the Pacific Coast from
northern California to British Columbia, with snow expected in the
mountains of Washington state.
   Rain was forecast ahead of a cold front pushing into the East,
with a possibility of tornadoes developing along the front from
Virginia to New York.
   Pockets of rain were expected in the Rockies.
   The nation's high Wednesday was 96 degrees at Borrego Springs,
Calif., and McAllen, Texas.

   A Honduran-registered freighter sank
two miles offshore early today after its load of construction
material shifted, and all nine crew members were rescued from life
rafts unharmed, the Coast Guard said.
   The 164-foot freighter Raychel went down in 43 feet of water
shortly after midnight after stopping at Miami, said Coast Guard
Petty Officer Jennifer Hogg.
   ``The freighter was carrying a load of construction material -
cinder blocks, wood, nails - that nature,'' Hogg said. ``The report
we received is that the load shifted and the vessel capsized.''
   A small amount of the ship's 5,500 gallons of diesel fuel had
leaked by daylight, said Petty Officer Buddy Dye.
   ``What has come out so far is not really a concern,'' Dye said.
``There is a sheen visible from the air, but they believe it will
dissipate on its own. There are choppy seas out there, and it's
very light and easily dissipated.''
   A Florida Marine Patrol diver was assigned to plug fuel vents to
keep any more fuel from spilling, and Coast Guard crews planned to
check nearby beaches for any signs of the oil, Dye said.
   The ship went down by the approach channel for the port of Miami
but was not blocking the waterway, which is heavily traveled by
freighters and cruise ships, Hogg said.
   The crew included three Americans, she said.
   She said the Coast Guard will decide whether the freighter will
have to be raised to keep the area clear.

<HEAD>Ukrainian Legislative Leader Presses Demands on Kremlin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS GINSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deputy chairman of the Ukrainian legislature
pressed the republic's sovereignty demands on the Kremlin today,
one day after student-led protests forced the Ukrainian prime
minister to quit.
   In the Ukraine's boldest separatist action yet, two weeks of
mass demonstrations, hunger strikes and classroom boycotts
culminated Wednesday in the resignation Prime Minister Vitaly
Masol.
   The Ukrainian legislature also passed a resolution embracing the
students' demands, including the transfer of ownership of Communist
Party property to the government and refusal to sign a new treaty
of union proposed by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Tass
reported.
   The unrest in the nation's second most populous republic -
combined with sharp criticism by Russian Federation President Boris
N. Yeltsin of Gorbachev's latest economic reform plan - could hurt
Gorbachev's efforts to forge a new treaty of union with the 15
diverse republics.
   The proposed treaty would link the republics in a loose
confederation and redefine their political and economic links with
the central government. The economic reform plan would give them
more control over property and some prices. Republic leaders and
liberal national lawmakers have criticized both initiatives as
insufficient.
   ``Interestingly, the right and the left have the same demand
about refusing to sign the union treaty,'' Vladimir Grinev, deputy
chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet, said in an interview
published today.
   ``The center sometimes looks on our declarations as adults'
games. But it is from such declarations that the new state order
will merge - an association of free states,'' Grinev told
Komsomolskaya Pravda, the youth newspaper.
   ``Union law can only become law if ratified by the republics. We
came to Moscow to get that across to the president and Defense
Ministry.''
   The protesters insist Ukranian conscripts be allowed to serve
within the republic, a demand echoed by other republics but
rejected by the ministry.
   Most of the 15 republics and many smaller provinces within them
have declared some form of independence or sovereignty from central
authorities. Most say they want independence first, and will then
decide whether to voluntarily join any new confederation with the
Kremlin.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Former Providence Mayor Cianci Missed Tax Filing
Deadline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayoral candidate Vincent A. ``Buddy''
Cianci Jr. missed the deadline to file his 1989 tax returns, a
newspaper reported today.
   Cianci's accountant, Daniel Kieliszak, said he has asked for a
30-day extension, until Nov. 15, to file the federal and state
returns.
   But Internal Revenue Service spokesmen in Rhode Island and
Washington told The Providence Journal-Bulletin that there is no
provision in the federal tax code that allows for extensions more
than six months beyond the April 15 filing date.
   The state Division of Taxation has the same rules, the newspaper
said.
   Kieliszak said Cianci has not received some bank statements that
he needs to file complete returns.
   Cianci, a former mayor who is running as an independent, has
made public his 1987 and 1988 filings and promised to disclose his
1989 return as soon as it was ready. His opponents have already
released their returns for the three years.
   ``It is not finished and I am not going to release an incomplete
return,'' Cianci said Wednesday.
   A late income tax filing is a civil infraction if the government
is owed money, said IRS spokesman Frank Keith. Penalties of at
least 5 percent a month, plus interest on the amount due, could be
assessed. There is no penalty if the taxpayer is due a refund.
   Elected mayor as a Republican in 1974, Cianci was forced out of
office 10 years later after he attacked his estranged wife's lover
with a fireplace log, an ashtray and a lit cigarette. He pleaded no
contest to two assault charges, and in April 1984 he received a
five-year suspended sentence and probation.

   City police commanders say the deployment of
border policemen without their knowledge on the Temple Mount was a
main factor behind last week's riots in which 19 Arabs were killed,
Israel radio said.
   The disclosure was the first Israeli suggestion that police
could have provoked the violence at the Jerusalem holy site. Arab
witnesses have said police set off the violence, the worst in the
34-month Palestinian uprraeli occupation.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip today, at least 35 Palestinians were
shot and wounded with bullets and rubber-coated steel balls in a
seven-hour clash with soldiers in the Rafah refugee camp, Arab
reports said.
   Witising against Isnesses told Palestinian reporters stoning started
after
soldiers raised an Israeli flag on a building in the camp,
apparently in an effort to make it a headquarters. They said the
clash ended when soldiers withdrew to just outside the camp. The
army said it was checking the report.
   The radio report did not identify the police commanders who made
the statements on the Temple Mount riots. But it said it was
quoting testimony they gave before a three-member committee
 deployment of troops, there was no
force mentioned that was supposed to be stationed on the Temple
Mount,'' the radio said, quoting the testimony.
   It said the force was only discovered once another group of
police stormed the Mount when stones came down on worshipers at the
Wall, injuring 28 people.
   A separate probe of the killings has also been opened by a
magistrates court judge. Jerusalem police spokesman Elhayan said it
was a routine inquiry mandated by law into any violent incident.
The Hadashot daily said the investigating judge may request
autopsies on the 19 victims.
   The riot raised tensions in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, where more than a million Palestinians were kept under
curfew for a week to prevent unrest. Most restrictions were lifted
by Tuesday.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, merchants shuttered their shops
for a second day in mourning for Temple Mount victims.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Reforms Will Cause Inflation, Job Losses, Economists Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two leading economic advisers to President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev warned today that the Soviet leader's plan for
introducing a market economy would cause severe inflation and
unemployment.
   Abel Aganbegyan told Soviet lawmakers in a one-hour report that
preliminary steps toward a market system had already created an
``inflationary spiral,'' particularly for prices of meat and dairy
products.
   He warned that hyperinflation was likely despite measures in the
Gorbachev plan designed to combat runaway prices, such as
restricting the nation's money supply and retaining state price
controls on some items.
   Aganbegyan and another economist, Oleg Bogomolov, spoke to a
meeting of several committees of the Supreme Soviet legislature
before a full legislative session Friday, when Gorbachev is to
formally present and defend his plan.
   Bogomolov said the Gorbachev plan for fails to identify
potential victims of the transformation. He also said it should
have established that no Soviet citizen's standard of living would
be allowed to drop more than 25 percent.
   Bogomolov predicted the reforms were likely to halve the value
of the ruble and force people to dip into their savings. Soviets
have an estimated 500 billion rubles in savings because many
necessities are subsidized by the state and few consumer goods are
available.
   Both economists said the success of the Gorbachev plan hinged on
cooperation from the 15 Soviet republics. The largest, Russia, has
already rejected it and renewed threats to implement its own more
radical program.
   Gorbachev's main political rival, Russian President Boris N.
Yeltsin, has called the plan a ``catastrophe'' and said it would
fail within months.
   But Aganbegyan said during a question-and-answer session with
lawmakers that Yeltsin was criticizing Gorbachev's politics rather
than his economics.
   ``He made a political speech and would have spoken this way
regardless of what we had proposed,'' said Aganbegyan, who headed a
24-member commission that drafted one of the many economic reform
plans considered by Gorbachev.
   The commission was appointed after the government's first
proposals caused panic buying last spring and had to be scrapped.
   Aganbegyan also said Yeltsin's predictions could cause political
instability resulting in millions of rubles of losses. He did not
specify how that might happen.
   Gorbachev's four-stage blueprint begins by reducing the
approximately $100 billion budget deficit and cutting the money
supply. Efforts would also be made in the first stage to increase
production of consumer goods and boost agricultural output through
land reform.
   In the second stage, prices on roughly 70 percent of all goods
and services would be freed to respond to market forces and small
private businesses would be encouraged.
   The third stage would emphasize establishing a free market for
housing, a modern banking system and entrepreneurship. The final
stage would end government monopolies in many industries and allow
the ruble to be freely traded against other world currencies.
   Gorbachev has set no timetable for his reforms but states other
countries have achieved similar goals within 18 months to two
years.

<TEXT>
   The star of a Cambodian dance troupe that
recently completed a U.S. tour has joined four fellow dancers in
deciding to stay in the United States, at least for now.
   After intense questioning by frederal officials, Yim Devi
decided not to leave with the rest of the troupe when its plane
departed New York at 9 a.m. Wednesday, said her attorney, Martin
Garbus.
   Four other members of the troupe defected earlier.
   Garbus declined to describe Devi's action as a defection,
however, noting she may eventually change her mind. Her passport
allows her to stay in the United States as a visitor until
December.
   ``She's going to explore her options,'' Garbus said. ``She might
stay two days, she might stay a week, who knows. She may want to
pursue her studies here.''
   Devi told police a Cambodian man tried to abduct her at
knifepoint in New York on Oct. 8 and told her he would kill her if
she didn't defect.
   Other members of the troupe reported receiving similar threats
during the tour.
   Federal officials questioned the dancers individually Tuesday to
see if any wanted to seek asylum, said Arthur Helton, director of
the Refugee project of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.
   Helton, who was hired by a relative of one of the defectors,
said officials were concerned that those wanting to seek asylum
were being denied the opportunity by Cambodian officials.
   Tour organizers said the dancers were the target of an organized
network of Cambodian-Americans who were urging them to defect.
   The troupe's tour marked the first artistic exchange between the
United States and Cambodia since 1971.

<TEXT>
   The army today drove off leftist guerrillas
who attacked air force headquarters with homemade mortars and
automatic weapons, and authorities said several people were
wounded.
   A military spokesman said he had an initial report that one
military mechanic was wounded and one aircraft was damaged in the
three hours of fighting at Ilopango air base on the east side of
the capital.
   A Red Cross spokesman said several people were wounded, but he
did not immediately know the precise number.
   The fighting began at 9:45 p.m. Wednesday and died down after
midnight.
   Helicopters were patrolling today, but the city was calm and
traffic moving normally in most of the capital. In the eastern
sector, near the air force headquarters, military roadblocks were
set up to search vehicles for arms.
   ``The situation is now under the control of the armed forces,''
said the military spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity
shortly after midnight.
   However, the government indicated it expected more trouble. It
broadcast a communique saying leftist labor and student
organizations planned to launch ``a series of provocative actions
of street violence.''
   The attack came exactly a month after yet another round of
unsuccessful peace talks between rebels and the rightist
government.
   A fifth round of U.N.-mediated peace talks between the rebels
and the government of President Alfredo Cristiani had ended in a
stalemate Sept. 18.
   Rebel commanders have said for weeks that an eventual stalemate
at the negotiating table could provoke a major offensive. The two
sides have agreed to meet again in Mexico before Nov. 4.
   Witnesses said Wednesday's attack began with a string of about
20 loud explosions, presumably caused by homemade mortars hurled
from rebel catapults.
   Heavy small-arms fire followed for about 90 minutes, most of it
on the edges of Ilopango and in the adjacent working neighborhood
of Soyapango, as government paratroopers moved into the areas.
   At least four helicopters provided air support, dropping flares
around the base and firing red tracer bullets and machine guns.
   As many as 100 rebels appeared to have been involved in the
attack on the air force headquarters, located inside the base, a
paratroop sergeant at the scene said.
   As soon as the fighting began, the eastern half of the city
turned into a ghost town, with virtually everyone taking refuge in
their homes.
   When the shooting died down, radio stations opened their air
waves to residents wishing to inform relatives that they were
unharmed and would spend the night in workplaces or at friends'
rather than venture into the streets.
   Guerrilla leaders and government representatives have been
negotiating unsuccessfully for more than a year to end the
decade-old civil war.
   The guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
insist the military should be drastically reduced in numbers, and
officers who violated human rights be prosecuted.
   The Cristiani government has balked at these requests, saying it
would be tantamount to doing away with the armed forces.
   The killings caused an uproar in Washington and calls to scale
back U.S. aid. Since 1980, the United States has provided more than
$4 billion in economic and military aid to bolster a succession of
Salvadoran governments.
   Human rights groups estimate more than 73,000 people have been
killed since the war began in late 1979 in this country of 5
million people.
   Death squads linked to the military and right-wing extremists
are blamed for a large percentage of the deaths.

<HEAD>FBI: Blow Struck Against Hells Angels Nationwide in Amphetamine
Trafficking</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities struck a blow to Hells Angels
motorcycle clubs that traffic in methamphetamines when they
arrested 15 people in the Omaha area and one in California, an FBI
agent said.
   ``We're going to knock the socks off the Hells Angels here,''
said Dennis Aiken, assistant special agent for the FBI in Omaha.
   Surrounded by confiscated rifles, a .22-caliber automatic
pistol, $800,000 worth of drugs, $200,000 in cash as well as Hells
Angels jackets and posters, Aiken said a two-year investigation
culminated in simultaneous raids Wednesday on 14 locations,
including the motorcycle club's headquarters in Omaha.
   A Rottweiler guard dog was killed after it attacked an officer
at the clubhouse and one man at the clubhouse resisted arrest, but
the other searches and arrests were conducted without incident,
Aiken said.
   ``We consider this group to be a major center in the trafficking
of methamphetamines,'' Aiken said at a news conference. Hells
Angels clubs have played a major role in methamphetamine traffic in
the country, he said.
   Many of the fewer than 50 club members in the Omaha area are now
in jail, Aiken said. Everyone arrested in the Omaha area Wednesday
was a Hells Angel club member or an associate of the club, Aiken
said.
   The investigation continued and it wasn't known how much
contraband and money would eventually be confiscated, Aiken said.
   Charges included interstate and foreign travel in support of
racketeering enterprises, money laundering, manufacturing and
distribution of a controlled substance and felony possession of a
firearm, an FBI news release said.
   Eleven of the 16 people arrested Wednesday in or near Omaha and
in Long Beach, Calif., had been named in a federal grand jury
indictment handed up Monday, Aiken said. The five others were
arrested on charges of drug possession based on evidence obtained
during the raids, he said.
   Larry Holmquist, an FBI spokesman, would not comment on the
connection between the arrest in California and the others here.
   Douglas County Sheriff Dick Roth said the suspects had been
investigated as far back as 1978.
   ``We have had tons of intelligence on these people's actions
over the years,'' Roth said.
   A cooperative effort that included the FBI, Nebraska State
Patrol and the federal Drug Enforcement Administration used
electronic surveillance such as wire intercepts, Aiken said. He
refused to say whether undercover agents played a role.
   Homes and businesses were searched in Omaha; in Valley, a town
west of here; and in Council Bluffs, across the Missouri River in
Iowa, the FBI said.

   A projection of a major earthquake in the
Midwest in early December is as about as reliable as a random
guess, a group of scientists said today.
   ``Such a projection, especially at the predicted 50-50 chance
level, implies a level of detailed knowledge ... that simply does
not exist for the New Madrid or any other fault zone in the
world,'' the group said in its report.
   The group released its findings, prepared for the National
Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council, today at a news
conference in St. Louis.
   The 11 scientists were brought together from universities and
governmental agencies to evaluate the scientific validity of Iben
Browning's projection of a 50 percent chance of a big quake hitting
the New Madrid Fault on or about Dec. 3.
   Browning, a climatologist based in Sandia Park, N.M, bases his
prediction on the cyclical forces of tides and gravity. He has said
that for 48 hours before and after Dec. 3, tidal forces will be
particularly strong.
   Earlier this week, Browning said that conditions will again be
ripe for a major quake in the region on New Year's Eve.
   Browning told Cape Girardeau television station KFVS that tidal
forces on that date will not be as high as on Dec. 3, ``but they
will still be dangerously high.''
   In 1811-1812, a series of quakes estimated at up to 8 on the
Richter scale struck the New Madrid region, causing the Mississippi
River to appear to flow backward and forming Reelfoot Lake in
Tennessee. The tremors rang church bells in Washington, D.C., more
than 850 miles away.
   Browning's Dec. 3 claim has been widely reported, causing public
anxiety throughout the region. At least nine school districts in
three states have canceled classes, insurance agents have been
swamped with requests for earthquake insurance and attendance at
earthquake preparedness meetings has been high.
   The New Madrid fault runs from Marked Tree, Ark., across
southeastern Missouri to southern Illinois and produces hundreds of
small quakes every year, most hardly felt. It's named for the
Missouri Bootheel town of New Madrid, about 140 miles south of St.
Louis.
   In today's report, the scientists' agreed with other findings
that ``the long-term potential for a large earthquake does, indeed,
exist for New Madrid.''
   But it said that ``Browning's correlations of earthquake
activity with danger periods at times of highs in tidal forces does
no better at predicting earthquakes of magnitudes greater than 6.5
than does random guessing.''
   The scientific group also said it found no evidence to support
the claim that Browning had predicted the Oct. 17, 1989, earthquake
in northern California.
   ``We can only infer that successes claimed before that time were
retrospective - that he found after the fact that certain
earthquakes occurred during times of his `danger periods.'''
   A quake measuring 4.6 on the Richter scale hit the New Madrid
region Sept. 26. The quake, the second strongest in the region this
century, caused no injuries and no significant damage, but it added
significantly to what has been called the ``earthquake hysteria.''

   A family of dolphins has circled an ailing
young dolphin inside the surf line off Pacific Palisades for 10
days, trying to keep the sick mammal from beaching itself.
   Nicknamed ``Bonnie,'' the Pacific bottlenose dolphin was kept in
the water off Will Rogers State Beach today by six companions,
marine conservationists said.
   Bonnie has a limp dorsal fin, possibly a birth defect, said
Peter Wallerstein, director of the Sea Shepherd Conservation
Society.
   ``She could have been deformed at birth or possibly have been
born with a weakened immune system,'' he said Wednesday.
   Would-be rescuers could do nothing because of the fear their
efforts would further traumatize the 3-foot-long dolphin,
Wallerstein said.
   ``As long as the family is with her, there's no need for human
intervention,'' he said. ``At this point, they're keeping her
afloat, kind of pushing her back and forth. But she's in bad shape.
   ``They'll keep shepherding her along as long as she needs
help,'' he added. ``This is a great example of how these
intelligent animals care for each other.''
   Wallerstein said rescuers would intervene only if any of the
dolphins beaches itself.

<TEXT>
   The number of drug-smuggling cases in the first
half of 1990 was almost four times higher than in all of last year,
according to an official report Thursday.
   Police and customs officials uncovered 2,216 drug trafficking
incidents in the first six months, confiscating 814 pounds of opium
and 1,700 pounds of heroin, the overseas edition of the People's
Daily reported.
   That compares with a total for 1989 of 563 cases, involving 635
pounds of opium and 1,234 pounds of heroin.
   The dispatch said most of the narcotics originated in southwest
China's Yunnan province and were being shipped across southern
China to Hong Kong and elsewhere.
   Yunnan province borders the so-called Golden Triangle, which
produces much of the world's heroin and opium.
   China has set up a 1,300-man anti-drug force to combat a growing
narcotics problem, which had been virtually eliminated soon after
the Communists came to power in 1949.

   A motorist drowned in floodwaters and scores

authorities said Thursday.
   About six inches of rain fell in less than an hour Wednesday
night in parts of the Var region near Toulon, and another four
inches fell in the Alpes-Maritimes.
   The downpour quickly overflowed stream beds hardened by a
prolonged drought and spilled onto highways and into homes.
   Officials said Geneviere Glasner, 60, was swept away by the
current and drowned when she tried to escape from her stranded car
near the town of Vence.
   Rescue crews helped evacuate dozens of people from their houses
and also from a home for retired people.

   The government has closed two more
universities following violent demonstrations calling for the
resignation of the president.
   Rajshahi University and Mymensingh's Agriculture University were
ordered shut late Wednesday. The two universities, both in northern
Bangladesh, were to stay closed for one month.
   Earlier this week, Dhaka University and two other universities
near the capital were ordered closed indefinitely because of
recurring anti-government protests.
   Only two universities in the country are still open.
   Police and stone-throwing students have clashed repeatedly since
Oct. 10 when the country's main opposition parties began a campaign
of general strikes to demand resignation of President Hussain
Muhammad Ershad.
   Protesters accuse the president of inefficiency and say his
administration is corrupt. Three general strikes have been held
since October.
   At least 50 people were injured Tuesday during a half-day strike
in Rajshahi, 120 miles northwest of Dhaka, in clashes between
students and police.
   In Mymensingh, 70 miles north of Dhaka, university students set
fire to the train station and two trains during the strike.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Bruce King's involvement in New
Mexico politics goes back 36 years - a fact that both he and his
opponent are trying to use to their advantage in the governor's
race.
   King already has served longer than anyone as governor of New
Mexico, two four-year terms starting in 1970 and 1978.
   ``I won't need any on-the-job training,'' the 66-year-old King
tells audiences as he bids for a comeback. ``I have the experience
I need to carry out the needs of the state.''
   His rival is Republican businessman Frank Bond, who says he
offers voters ``a new generation of leadership.''
   Bond, 47, reminds voters that since New Mexico governors now can
seek consecutive four-year terms, the next governor could serve
through 1998, when he would be 55 years old, and King 74.
   GOP Gov. Garrey Carruthers, the first Republican governor since
1968, was prevented from seeking re-election by a constitutional
provision that now has been changed.
   Bond, who trailed King by some 12 percentage points in recent
polls, is turning up the heat on the campaign trail as he tries to
boost his name identification.
   He has attacked what he calls an excessive number of executive
pardons issued to ex-convicts by King and has accused King of
cronyism. Two high-ranking officials were convicted of federal
crimes and two resigned under a cloud of suspicion during King's
second administration.
   King responds that hundreds of people are appointed by the
governor and that a few bad apples are a ``small percentage.''
   Known for his friendly ways, King talks often about his
experience and ability to work well with the Legislature and
diverse groups.
   ``I have the political maturity to carry out the needs of the
people,'' he says.
   The state GOP chairman casts King's experience in a different
light.
   ``Yes, he's back, like those tired, old vaudevillian jokes,''
John Lattauzio wrote of King in a recent fund-raising letter. ``But
time has wrung the humor out of Bruce King as well.''
   Bond disavowed the letter and said it was not his style.
   Both candidates come from ranching families with deep New Mexico
ties and each has established himself in modern business. They
first met as adolescents.
   ``There are all these connections and coincidences, but they
don't bring us politically at all close together,'' says Bond.
   King and his two brothers built the family homestead into a
farming, ranching and business empire covering nearly 500,000 acres
and including a propane and butane company, feedlots and land
development.
   His political outlook was influenced by the New Deal of
President Roosevelt. At the same time, King emphasizes that ``the
big thing I'm interested in is reducing big bureaucratic
government.''
   Bond, a lawyer and former state legislator, studied photography
under Ansel Adams and stopped just short of a doctorate in Spanish
literature. His grandfather and great-grandfather migrated from
Canada to northern New Mexico in 1883.
   Bond's Republican roots also run deep. His father helped stat
candidates and his maternal grandmother was a GOP national
committeewoman for 18 years, hosting President Eisenhower in her
Albuquerque home.
   ``I grew up basically with probably a much more conservative
philosophy, particularly fiscally, with respect to taxes, with
respect to the size of government and the like,'' he says.
   Bond hopes to exploit the state's political shift since King's
last election.
   In 1978, Democrats outnumbered Republicans 2.3-to-1, and King
won the election by just 1 percent of the vote. Republicans have
narrowed the ratio to about 1.7-to-1 this year.

   Former convict Seth Morgan, whose first novel
``Homeboy'' won national acclaim last spring, was killed with a
companion when their motorcycle crashed into a bridge abutment,
police said.
   Investigators said Morgan, 41, and Diane Levin, 37, both of New
Orleans, were thrown from the motorcycle and died at the scene
Wednesday. Neither victim was wearing a helmet, as required by
state law, police said.
   Police said Morgan had been arrested Tuesday on charges of
driving his motorcycle while intoxicated, but it was uncertain
whether he was drunk at the time of his death.
   Morgan had drifted into New Orleans in 1986 after three years in
a California prison for armed robbery.
   He had started writing in prison, where he won an award for his
story of the last days of Janis Joplin, the singer who had been his
lover when she died of a drug overdose in 1970.
   He resumed writing in New Orleans. In a few months, Morgan
produced a 1,100-page manuscript that became ``Homeboy,'' a thickly
plotted crime novel set in San Francisco.
   The first novel drew on his experiences with the seamier side of
life and was greeted with strong praise when it was published last
spring, including a complimentary front-page critique in The New
York Times Book Review.
   ``Homeboy'' sold about 25,000 copies, which Jason Epstein, his
editor at Random House, described as ``a lot for an unknown
writer.''
   At his death, Morgan was working on a second novel, ``Mambo
Mephiste,'' set in New Orleans.
   He once said in an interview that he kept writing in New Orleans
because it was the only way he could get control of his life.
   ``You can really stay messed up here in New Orleans very
anonymously. But this is where I regained sobriety, sanity,'' he
said. ``The city's inherent tolerance, I know, was very helpful.''
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   The National Tour Association said today travelers may call for
information on which tourists sites - including the Statue of

   Such facilities could be closed this weekend if Congress and the
Bush administration fail to agree on a deficit-reduction plan.
   Spokesman Chris Dever said the association, which includes

   A frail, gray-haired woman who spent most of the
last four decades in an Albanian prison camp kissed and hugged some
middle-aged strangers who met her at John F. Kennedy International
Airport.
   They were her children.
   ``Which one are you?'' 78-year-old Haxhire Bushka asked each of
her children, the youngest of whom are in their early 40s, after
she stepped off the plane Wednesday.
   ``You're not my son,'' Mrs. Bushka joked with Eddie Bushka, 60,
of Waterbury, Conn., her oldest. ``You're too old.''
   ``I'm Joan, Mommy - Joan, Joan,'' said Joan Ali, 46, of
Waterbury, Conn., as she hugged her mother for the first time since
she was a small girl.
   Mrs. Bushka was imprisoned in 1950 a few days after her husband
fled Albania for Greece, taking Eddie with him. Halil Bushka feared
he would be killed if he stayed in Albania after the Communist
regime confiscated their farm.
   Eddie Bushka returned to Albania in 1951 and led six of his
brothers and sisters seven miles across the border to freedom in
Greece.
   Halil Bushka refused to let Eddie go back for his mother,
fearing for her life as well as Eddie's.
   Bushka took his children to the United States in 1952 and
settled in Connecticut, where the children still live and the
brothers run a construction company, Bushka Lumber. Halil Buskha
died in 1971.
   Mrs. Bushka was imprisoned on and off for nearly 40 years with
her youngest child, Skender, who was 6 months old when she was
first arrested. He accompanied her to the United States.
   The children have tried for years to get their mother and
brother out of Albania, keeping in touch through a trickle of
letters Mrs. Bushka was permitted to receive. They said she kept
her hopes alive with the help of a few tattered photographs of them
as young children.
   Six months ago, as reforms began infiltrating the hardline
Communist government, she was let out of prison.
   ``She had no belongings, nothing,'' said Eddie Bushka. He said
she went to live with friends and wrote to the family in
Connecticut.
   Three of her children went to Rome last week to meet her and
arrange for her visa to the United States.
   ``We are going to give her the very best we know how,'' said
Mrs. Ali. ``Right now there is so much catching up to do.''
   And Mrs. Bushka has to meet her 26 grandchildren and three
great-grandchildren.
   ``This is all so overwhelming for her,'' said Mrs. Ali. ``She is
the very best present in the whole wide world.''
   A reunion at Eddie Bushka's is planned for this weekend, with an
Albanian feast featuring specialties like baklava pastry and byrek,
a vegetable pie.
   ``This is the most wonderful day of my life,'' said Eddie
Bushka.

   No one placed the minimum $100 million bid at a
court-ordered auction of the Crown Building, one of four Manhattan
properties tied to the late Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
and his wife, Imelda.
   A second auction of the 26-story retail and office building will
be held, probably before the end of the year, auctioneer Stephen
Estroff said at the close of the unsuccessful sale Wednesday in
U.S. District Court.
   The auction came in a foreclosure action by Security Pacific
Mortgage and Real Estate Services. Proceeds were to have gone into
an escrow account until the resolution of civil lawsuits in which
the Philippine government and others claim ownership of the four
properties.
   Mrs. Marcos was acquitted in July of criminal charges that she
and her husband used embezzled government funds to buy the
buildings.
   Estroff said one reason for the lack of bidders was concern
about the shaky economy.
   Two of the other Marcos properties already have been auctioned.
The Herald Center, a retail building near Macy's, brought $25
million and an office tower on Wall Street was sold for $77
million.
   The fourth property at Madison Avenue has not come up for
auction.

<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk today
lifted the state of emergency in violence-torn Natal Province,
meeting a key demand that had slowed peace talks with the African
National Congress.
   ``The state of emergency has now been completely lifted,'' de
Klerk told a news conference. ``There is only one route to peace
and reconciliation - that is through peaceful negotiation.''
   He said the door to negotiations ``is now fully open and I am
appealing to all leaders and all South Africans to accept the
challenge.''
   The ANC issued a statement welcoming the move. It has long
demanded that the emergency be lifted as a precondition for
full-scale negotiations on black-white power sharing and ending
apartheid.
   President Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, welcomed de
Klerk's action as ``yet another important landmark on the road
toward full normalization of political activity in South Africa.''
   Fitzwater said, ``We believe that President de Klerk deserves
credit for his political courage and leadership.''
   De Klerk lifted a 4-year-old nationwide state of emergency in
June, but kept the restrictive measures in Natal Province, where a
power struggle between the ANC and the conservative Inkatha
movement has claimed 5,000 lives since 1986. The president said the
violence, though still sporadic, was receding and that law and
order could be maintained through normal police powers.
   Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said the decision to lift
the emergency was ``a step which should bring South Africa nearer
to the negotiating table.''
   The state of emergency gave police and the army widespread
powers, including detention without trial and the authority to
break up political rallies and meetings. But police will retain the
right under security laws to impose stringent restrictions in what
they deem to be emergency situations.
   More than 30,000 activists, mostly black, were detained for
varying lengths of time during the four years of the nationwide
state of emergency.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok told the news conference the
number of police and soldiers would remain the same in Natal but
that they would operate under normal procedures.
   Police still have some special powers in townships around
Johannesburg that have been declared ``unrest areas,'' but the
measures are far short of powers under the state of emergency.
About 800 blacks have died in factional fighting around
Johannesburg in the last two months.
   With de Klerk's latest announcement, he has addressed all of the
ANC's demands, including the release of political prisoners and the
return of some 20,000 exiles. However, the exiles have yet to begin
returning in large numbers, and only a few dozen of the more than
1,500 political prisoners claimed by the ANC have been released.
   De Klerk said there was ``basic agreement'' on any remaining
obstacles to negotiations but that ``there have been some
hiccups.''
   The fighting around Johannesburg had strained government-ANC
relations, with the ANC accusing security forces of instigating the
unrest. The government denied the charge and challenged the ANC to
provide proof.
   De Klerk reiterated that all political parties, including
right-wing conservative and militant black groups, are welcome at
constitutional negotiations he hopes to launch early next year.
   Only the ANC, Inkatha and the white anti-apartheid Democratic
Party have expressed a desire to attend.
   De Klerk said he wants to eliminate apartheid measures and give
all South Africans a ``vote of equal value.''
   He again promised that whites would have a chance to vote on any
new constitutional agreement before it would be implemented. The
president said he wants such an agreement by 1994, when the next
national election is due.

   The fourth chess game in the world title match
between champion Garry Kasparov and challenger Anatoly Karpov ended
in a draw today when the players agreed not to continue after an
adjournment.
   The game was adjourned Wednesday at shortly after 10:30 p.m.
when Kasparov, playing the white pieces, wrote down his 41st move
and sealed it in an envelope.
   The game had been scheduled to resume at 5:30 p.m. today, but
the players this morning decided on a draw instead, officials for
match said.
   Karpov's offer of the draw was made in a written note about
12:30 a.m. today, and was accepted by Kasparov shortly before 11
a.m.
   The sealed move was knight to g6, checking the black king, and
came two hours and 34 minutes into the match.
   The draw had been predicted by experts watching the game
Wednesday.
   ``It's definitely a draw,'' said grand master Stefan Djuric of
Yugoslavia after the game was adjourned.
   ``There's no question about it,'' said international master
Vitaly Zaltsman of Brooklyn. ``Kasparov has a perpetual check.''
That meant Kasparov could make endless checks to Karpov's king, a
draw according to chess rules.
   Games 1 and 3 also ended in a draw, while Kasparov won Game 2. A
win is worth one point and a draw is worth one-half point for each
player. With today's announcement of a draw, Kasparov now leads
2{-1{.
   Kasparov, 27, the highest-rated player in the history of chess,
and Karpov, 39, the former world champion he unseated in 1985, are
playing a best-of-24-game, $3 million match. The first player to
get 12{ points wins.
   The first 12 games are to be played in New York and the rest in
Lyons, France.
   Spectators in the press room at Game 4 included Boris Spassky,
who held the title from 1969 until he was defeated by Bobby Fischer
in 1972, and Viktor Korchnoi, who lost two championship matches
against Karpov in 1978 and 1981.
   Officials running the match removed Karpov's miniature flag of
the Soviet Union and Kasparov's flag of the Russian Republic from
the playing table after Karpov's delegation asked that Kasparov's
be taken away.

<HEAD>Government Distributes $60 Million in Drug Treatment Grants</HEAD>

   Federal health officials on Thursday awarded
$60 million in drug treatment grants to eight large cities and to
almost 100 programs aimed at youth, minorities, public housing
residents and criminals.
   The grants are intended not just to increase services where they
are most needed, but to develop more effective treatment methods,
officials said.
   ``It's not just having enough (treatment) slots, but the
quality'' of the services available to keep addicts in treatment,
said James Mason, assistant secretary for health in the Department
of Health and Human Services.
   The eight cities will receive a total of $28.5 million to
improve city-wide drug treatment systems to eliminate waiting lists
and ensure that drug abusers receive better treatment more quickly.
   The cities will use the money for such things as developing a
central referral service, improving patient monitoring, hiring more
staff and improving outreach services, officials said.
   The Department of Health and Human Services also is giving $24.2
million to 80 drug treatment programs in 35 states and territories
to improve services for three population groups that have a high
prevalence of drug problems - adolescents, minorities and public
housing residents.
   Officials hope these programs can become national prototypes of
comprehensive services that will better serve others, such as the
homeless, people with AIDS and people with mental illness who also
have drug or alcohol problems, or both.
   Also, $8 million will be used to fund 19 demonstration projects
designed to improve drug treatment in the criminal justice system,
including people who are in jail and others who are on probation or
parole.
   The eight target cities and their awards are: Boston, $4.5
million; Baltimore, $4.5 million; Los Angeles, $4.1 million;
Atlanta, $3.9 million; San Juan, Puerto Rico, $3.8; New York, $3.7
million; Albuquerque, N.M., $2.5 million; and Milwaukee, $1.5
million.
   Officials said they expect to fund each city's program for three
year, but said money for the following two years will depend on the
department's budget.
   The funds for all of the cities and programs winning grants come
from the budget for the fiscal year that just ended. They are the
first projects funded by the Office for Treatment Improvement,
which opened last January in the department's Alcohol, Drug Abuse
and Mental Health Administration.

   A shooting rampage in a fast-food
restaurant, a nearby grocery store and a taxi left two people dead
and two others seriously wounded, police said today.
   Authorities arrested Delaney G. Marks, 34, in nearby Alameda at
about 12:30 a.m. today based on a description of the gunman by
witnesses, said Oakland police Sgt. Dan Mercado.
   ``He had the weapon with him and through some admissions we
believe he is the shooter in all four cases,'' Mercado said.
Mercado would not comment on a possible motive.
   Marks was held for investigation of two charges of murder, two
counts of attempted murder, and possession of a firearm by an
ex-felon, police said.
   The shooting spree started about 7:40 p.m. Wednesday when a
gunman walked into a Taco Bell restaurant and shot a cashier in the
face, Mercado said. Mui Loung, 20, was in critical condition today
at Eden Hospital Medical Center, a spokesman said.
   A few minutes later, a man believed to be the same gunman
entered the Gourmet Market about two blocks away, where he shot and
killed the owner and critically wounded an employee, Mercado said.
   Peter Bazea, 60, of San Leandro was pronounced dead on arrival
at an Oakland hospital, police said. His employee John Myers, 30,
of Oakland was in critical condition at Eden Hospital with a
gunshot wound to the chest, officials said.
   Shortly after the shootings in Oakland, a Yellow Cab driver who
had been shot in the face stopped at a fast-food restaurant in
nearby Alameda, where employees called for help. The driver, a
47-year-old man whose name was not released, died about half an
hour later, police said.
   Records showed the last fare the driver picked up was near the
Oakland market, police said.
   Marks' girlfriend was with him at the time of arrest and also
was in the vicinity during the four shootings, but she was released
after questioning, Mercado said.
   Mercado said Marks, a transient, was on parole but would not
release any details of his criminal history.

   U.S. radio stations have rcceived pledges of
$30,000 and are seeking more donations to buy radios and batteries
for use by American troops in the Persian Gulf region, the National
Association of Broadcasters said Thursday.
   The first shipment of radios already has arrived in the gulf,
thanks to the AIR-LIFT listener donation campaign that NAB launched
last month in conjunction with Westinghouse Electric's Group W
Radio. Another 6,000 batteries and receivers, including 5,000 sets
from Sony, will be en route to the Middle East by next week, NAB
said.
   The Armed Forces Radio and Television Service has begun
broadcasting to U.S. troops in the region.
   Other manufacturer contributions are expected, NAB said, but the
public is urged to send cash donations to buy more
military-approved receivers. Radio donations are not needed.
   Contributions should be made by check or money order, payable
to: AIR-LIFT, Rockefeller Center, Box 5493, New York, N.Y., 10185.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is
weighing prospects for a settlement of the Persian Gulf crisis with
a senior Soviet expert who is reporting on his recent talks in
Iraq.
   The unannounced visit Thursday of Evgeny Primakov to the State
Department is a warmup to the session the Soviet official will have
at the White House on Friday with President Bush.
   The two superpowers are cooperating in efforts to force Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait, its smaller, oil-rich neighbor in the Persian
Gulf. However, an embargo on trade and other steps taken by the
U.N. Security Council so far have failed to persuade President
Saddam Hussein to pull out his troops.
   A report from Moscow in today's editions of The Washington Times
quoted unnamed U.S. officials as saying Primakov is carrying a
peace plan from Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that calls on
Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, possibly in exchange for free
elections in the emirate and cash compensation to Iraq from an oil
claims dispute.
   Baker earlier this week ruled out any ``partial solution'' short
of total Iraqi withdrawal or anything that would enable Saddam to
claim benefits from the Aug. 2 invasion. However, Baker also
stressed the U.S. quest for a political settlement.
   On Wednesday, Baker told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
a worldwide arms embargo might be maintained against Iraq even if
it withdrew from Kuwait.
   Baker suggested the Security Council also consider calling for
Iraqi reparations to Kuwait and an international war crimes trial
of Iraq's leaders.
   Baker's latest proposal reflected concern within the
administration and Congress that even if Iraq withdrew its troops,
its large army and nuclear and chemical weapons technology would
pose a danger in the Middle East and Persian Gulf.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., suggested, meanwhile, that companies
providing military technology to Iraq be held liable for war
crimes, as well.
   Baker did not respond to the suggestion, which Helms supported
with a chart showing that firms in 19 countries, including the
United States, had assisted Iraq before the invasion.
   West Germany headed the list, with 87 companies. Austria was
second with 18 and France was third with 17.
   The hearing was marked by demands by key senators that Congress
participate in any decision to send U.S. troops into combat against
Iraq.
   But Baker resisted. He promised only further consultations.
   ``We should not have a constitutional argument over whether or
not the president as commander-in-chief has authority to commit
forces,'' Baker said in an effort to end the debate.
   Besides, Baker said, a vote on Capitol Hill could tip off Saddam
about a pending military operation or even cause the White House to
abandon that option.
   Only two members of the committee, Sens. Rudy Boschwitz,
R-Minn., and Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., supported the
administration in its insistence that consultation with
congressional leaders was sufficient.
   Typical of the demand was an assertion by Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes,
D-Md., that ``consultation is not enough.''
   ``There is a difference between consultation and
authorization,'' Sarbanes said. ``The notion that the president
alone would be able to commit American forces in a military assault
in effect without receiving a shared decision by the Congress is
contrary to the Constitution.''
   Besides, Sarbanes said, ``it is clearly contrary to what makes
good sense'' so far as ensuring support of the American people.
   But Baker responded: ``If you want us to agree to do nothing
unless we get the approval of 535 members of Congress, we can't
agree to that right now.''
   The disagreement, mostly under wraps until now, is rising to the
surface as Congress prepares for a year-end adjournment, beginning
possibly late next week.

<HEAD>Controversy Over Infant Deaths as Clinics Demand Parents Pay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TINA SUSMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   Parents whose babies died
after receiving contaminated intravenous solutions at two clinics
may be taken to court if they continue to refuse to pay bills for
the treatment, officials said Thursday.
   As many as 16 children, all white, may have died at the two
clinics this year from a bacterial infection possibly caused by
contaminated intravenous solution used in the neonatal wards.
   The parents met with an attorney Wednesday and mandated that he
ask the government to order an inquiry into the deaths at the
Morningside and Park Lane clinics in Johannesburg.
   The parents have said they should not have to pay the medical
bills. The clinics have replied that they were not responsible for
the deaths and should not be left with the bills.
   The managing director of the Morningside clinic, Johan van
Reenen, said it is impossible to determine if the fatal infections
were a direct result of contaminated solution.
   He said there are ``1,001-plus causes'' of the bacterial
infection known as Klepsiella. In addition, of the many infants who
received the same drip formula, some became ill and others did not,
van Reenen said.
   ``If it was contaminated solution (that caused the deaths), it's
not the hospital that was negligent,'' he said. He also said most
of the affected parents were covered by medical insurance.
   Four babies died at Morningside after contracting the infection,
and another three who died might have been infected, he said.
   The number of infant deaths at Park Lane was unclear. News
reports mentioned nine. The hospital's managing director, Jeffrey
Hurwitz, said Thursday he could not give a specific figure.
   At the parents' meeting Wednesday night, the mother of one dead
child said Park Lane had threatened to take her to court if she did
not pay a $12,000 bill within 10 days.
   Hurwitz denied any of the bills were that high. He said they
ranged from about $2,000 to $6,000, and he indicated Park Lane
would pursue legal action if parents did not pay.
   ``The point is, we bill patients as a normal procedure and we
give them credit terms the same as any business. We expect payment
within those terms. If we don't receive payment, we take the matter
further,'' Hurwitz said.

   Zombie extras lurked among moviegoers
at a shopping mall at the premiere of ``Night of the Living Dead,''
a remake faithful in plot but deviant in style to the 1968
original.
   ``What makes a good zombie? Dull-eyed savagery, an advanced
state of decomposition and a taste for human flesh. Uncontrollable
drooling helps, but it's not required,'' actor Craig Spector said
at Wednesday's premiere in suburban Pittsburgh.
   The color remake was based on the same script as the
black-and-white thriller - the tale of farmhouse-bound survivors
who bicker among themselves as hordes of slow-moving flesh-eaters
attac.
   Spector and 14 other zombie extras in their makeup joined about
500 moviegoers Wednesday at the Galleria mall. The film is
scheduled to open nationwide Friday.
   Ed Evans, who wore overalls and glued-on bullet wounds as he
staggered in circles around the mall, said he was looking forward
to seeing himself crashing through a boarded-up window and
``getting blown away by a shotgun.''
   Spector said he learned to ``fall down dead and get up deader''
for his big scene, a mob attack on insurance salesman-turned-zombie
killer Ben.
   George Romero, who directed the original ``Dead'' and two
sequels, was the remake's executive producer. Tom Savini moved up
from special effects supervisor to director.
   ``This picture has to stand on its own merits,'' producer Russ
Streiner said. ``It would be a disservice to keep bringing up the
original.''
   The two were filmed on opposite sides of Pittsburgh, Romero's
hometown. In 1968, the dead walked in Evans City, Butler County.
The 1990 crew picked an abandoned dairy farm in Wolfdale,
Washington County.
   ``When I was 13 years old, I saw the original and it set off a
circuit breaker in my head that changed my life,'' said horror buff
and ``Living Dead'' zombie extra John Skipp.
   He and said he and Spector ``live for this kind of thing. It's a
personality disorder. We can't help it.''
   The $130,000 original was shot like a grainy newsreel, but the
$4.2 million remake includes more humor and allusions to horror
landmarks filmed since 1968.
   For example, a sweet little zombie in a nightgown named Sarah
resembles another cinema darling, the little girl from 1973's ``The
Exorcist.''
   ``As a moviegoer, I think fans will be interested in this
picture because there are enough twists and turns in there,''
Streiner said. ``It's not just a carbon copy of the original.''

<TEXT>
   Republican Al McCandless is a
four-term congressman battling for name recognition against a
first-time candidate - actor Ralph Waite.
   Waite, best known as television's ``Papa John Walton,'' has been
campaigning non-stop for eight months. Wherever he goes, Waite is
greeted by fans of ``The Waltons'' who ask him to autograph his
campaign brochures.
   Both he and McCandless have lined up big-name support in the
battle for the nation's fastest-growing congressional district.
   Democrat Waite draws on entertainment celebrities such as ``St.
Elsewhere'' star Ed Begley Jr. and film ``Superman'' Christopher
Reeve.
   McCandless has Bob Hope and Gerald Ford serving as his chief
fund-raisers. Palm Springs Mayor Sonny Bono also is in his corner.
   McCandless, who stresses fiscal conservatism and a strong
military, represents a district where Republicans outnumber
Democrats 200,000 to 165,000.
   But his constituents include voters in half a dozen cities that
didn't even exist a decade ago.
   ``People who have moved into this district don't know the name
of the man who represents them,'' says Indian Wells Mayor Richard
Oliphant, a McCandless supporter. ``He's the incumbent, but he
needs to build name identification. It's a unique situation.''
   The district includes Palm Springs, Rancho Mirage and Riverside,
plus new communities on the Mojave Desert 70 miles inland from Los
Angeles.
   ``In this district, it could be a close race,'' says former
President Ford. ``Just because the registration is plus Republican,
and because Al has been re-elected four times, you can never be
sure.''
   Waite says he has come from 28 percentage points behind
McCandless in polls during the spring to a dead heat in the final
weeks.
   Waite also leads in fund raising, with $450,000, including
$156,000 of his own money. McCandless has raised $250,000.
   ``A lot of it has to do with Waite being a celebrity, and it's
the first time Al has been seriously challenged,'' McCandless
campaign spokesman James Moore says. ``When you get the Hollywood
liberals in a race, it create tension.''
   Republicans have brought in Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter and have scheduled former President Reagan, Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady and Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner to raise funds for McCandless.
   ``We're using the secretaries and former presidents to define
what we represent - as opposed to sit-com actors,'' Moore said.
   Early in the campaign, McCandless ignored Waite and made few
appearances. But McCandless switched tactics in August in response
to the challenge from Waite and challenged his Democratic rival to
debates that have yet to occur.
   McCandless, 63, labels Waite a typical big-spending Democrat.
   For the 62-year-old Waite, the district's heavily Republican
registration is a problem.
   ``Being a Democrat's a tough job in these parts, but someone's
got to do it,'' said a sign on a Waite booth at a community fair.
   Before becoming an actor, Waite was a social worker and a
minister, giving him experience dealing with housing and drug
rehabilitation issues.
   Waite also reminds voters of his Hollywood past.
   ``I guess I've been in almost every one of your homes for 10
years on The Waltons,'' he told a senior citizens group at a mobile
home park.
   ``Being an actor, playing on The Waltons doesn't necessarily
make a good leader or qualify you for Congress, but it might say
something about the kind of values you have,'' Waite continued.
   Waite faults McCandless for failing to act to avert the savings
and loan scandal. McCandless, who has spent five years on the House
Banking Committee, calls that a meaningless ``pot shot.''
   Waite endorses environmental regulations and more federal
spending for seniors, education, health and social programs. He
tells senior citizens McCandless ``does not seem to have your
interests very high on his agenda.''
   McCandless received ``Taxpayers' Friend'' and ``Watchdog of the
Treasury'' awards from conservative groups. He says he won't vote
for increased taxes while Democrats promise ``vague spending
cuts.''
   Even his own campaign brochures acknowledge the low-profile
McCandless ``isn't a smile and backslap politician.'' His campaign
materials credit him with water and flood control projects, highway
construction and housing grants for his district.

<TEXT>
   ``Good Morning America'' co-host Charles Gibson
is going to Saudi Arabia for live Thanksgiving week broadcasts from
U.S. military bases there and a Navy ship in the Persian Gulf, ABC
said Thursday.
   The five-day trip starts Nov. 19. It will be the second time a
network morning show star has broadcast from Saudi Arabia since the
U.S. military buildup began there after Iraq's Aug. 2 takeover of
Kuwait.
   Bryant Gumble co-anchored NBC's ``Today'' show there for a week
of broadcasts beginning Aug. 17.
   ABC's expedition is more ambitious, partly because its show will
be freer to travel to U.S. military bases due to a loosening of
restrictions that were in force when Gumbel went there in the early
days of the U.S. buildup.
   Gibson, accompanied by a 16-member crew to include reporter
Steve Fox, will broadcast from two Army camps, an Air Force base,
and a Marine encampment, in addition to the as-yet unidentified
Navy ship. No specific locations can be announced yet because of
security regulations, ABC said.
   Co-host Joan Lunden will remain in New York, doing other
segments of each day's show.
   The show also will broadcast reunions - via satellite - of
members of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia with their families in the
United States.
   Since mid-August, NBC's ``Today'' each day has shown what its
staff has nicknamed ``Hi, Moms'' - tape-recorded greetings of U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia to their families and friends.
   ABC's announcement came as last week's Nielsens showed ``Good
Morning America'' first in ratings for network morning shows for
the 41st consecutive week, easily beating once-dominant ``Today.''
   ABC's show averaged a 4.7 rating, ``Today'' a 3.3 and ``CBS This
Morning'' a 2.6. Each ratings point represents 931,000 homes.

<TEXT>
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, now a Supreme Court
minority of one on the death penalty, still has an abolitionist's
fervor. He blistered his fellow justices for their ``indifferent
shrug of the shoulders'' in allowing a Virginia execution
Wednesday.
   Marshall, indisputably the court's most liberal member, fired
off a strongly worded dissent as the court, voting 8-1, rejected a
death row inmate's last-gasp legal gambit. Wilbert Lee Evans was
electrocuted in Richmond hours later.
   Marshall said the execution, the nation's 141st since the high
court allowed states to reinstate the death penalty in 1976,
``highlights the inherently cruel and unusual character of capital
punishment.''
   Since Justice William J. Brennan's retirement in July, Marshall,
82, is the only court member who opposes the death penalty in all
cases.
   ``We hope our movement will help Justice Marshall feel less
isolated,'' said Leigh Dingerson of the National Coalition to
Abolish the Death Penalty. ``Even though the ... polls say 70
percent of Americans favor the death penalty, those polls mean 65
million people agree with him.''
   Michael McConnell, a University of Chicago law professor, said
Marshall's persistent refusal to condone capital punishment does
not weaken the court's authority.
   ``I can see no principled objection to a justice refusing to
follow a precedent if he feels it sufficiently important to
register continued disapproval,'' McConnell said. ``But he who does
so must not object when others similarly depart from precedent
regarding some other issue.''
   In the Virginia case, Evans was convicted of murdering a deputy
sheriff in 1981. He was sentenced to death because jurors found one
aggravating factor - the likelihood that Evans would be a future
danger to society.
   While on death row, Evans was credited with saving the lives of
prison guards taken hostage during a 1984 riot and with preventing
the rape of a nurse. Marshall said such action ``casts grave doubt
on the jury's prediction of Evans' future dangerousness.''
   Virginia prosecutors did not argue that Evans still must be
considered a future danger. But they said letting him attack his
death sentence based on his actions in prison would lead to every
well-behaved death row inmate challenging a past finding of future
dangerousness.
   Marshall accused Virginia officials - and his eight fellow
justices - of ignoring ``late-arriving evidence'' that should have
been taken into account.
   ``The indifferent shrug of the shoulders with which the court
answers the failure of its procedures in this case reveals the
utter bankruptcy of its notion that a system of capital punishment
can coexist with the (Constitution's) Eighth Amendment,'' Marshall
said.
   The amendment bans cruel and unusual punishment.
   ``A death sentence that is dead wrong is no less so simply
because its deficiency is not uncovered until the eleventh hour,''
Marshall said. ``A system of capital punishment that would permit
Wilbert Evans' execution notwithstanding as-to-now unrefuted
evidence showing that death is an improper sentence is a system
that cannot stand.''

<HEAD>Candidates Taking on the Duke From N.H. to Nebraska</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Republicans can't stop talking about Michael
Dukakis. Nothing flattering, mind you. They just find the
Massachusetts governor an irresistible campaign issue.
   Oklahoma Republicans offered Dukakis first-class air fare to
come to their state and campaign for David Walters, the Democratic
candidate for governor. The offer was not accepted.
   Democratic candidate David Worley's vote for Dukakis in the 1988
presidential election is an issue in a Georgia congressional race.
   Can Nebraska gubernatorial candidate Ben Nelson overcome the
fact he has dark hair, bushy eyebrows and a prominent nose, giving
him a superficial resemblance to the Massachusetts governor?
   Nowhere, of course, is Dukakis more of an issue than in his home
state, where John Silber, the Democratic nominee for governor,
relishes telling people he voted for George Bush in 1988.
   Dukakis can take some small comfort in the fact he's far from
the first defeated presidential candidate to remain a political
target.
   Republicans ran against Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale long
after their names no longer appeared on any ballot. A whole
generation of Democrats ran against Herbert Hoover, and with
considerable success.
   Sheffield Nelson once raised money for Edward M. Kennedy and for
Jimmy Carter. That was before he became a Republican in 1989. Now
he's running for governor of Arkansas against Democratic incumbent
Bill Clinton.
   During a recent debate, Nelson said Clinton ``wants to run for
president. He wants to do like Michael Dukakis, and if you give him
four more years, he'll bring the Massachusetts Miracle down
South.''
   The souring of the booming economy that Dukakis liked to call
the Massachusetts Miracle triggered a voter revolt that gave the
gubernatorial nomination to outsider Silber.
   Also worried is Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who is being
challenged by Republican Jim Rappaport. Once thought safe, Kerry
now is looking at polls showing him in a very close contest.
   The GOP candidate is running an ad in which a picture of Dukakis
gradually transforms into one of Kerry. ``He's back,'' says the
voice. ``Oh, not Mike Dukakis. He's gone. But the man who was
Dukakis' lieutenant governor, he's back. He and Dukakis were a
team. They think like a team.''
   In neighboring New Hampshire, Republican Gov. Judd Gregg likes
to point out that his Democratic opponent, Joseph Grandmaison, ran
Dukakis' first campaign for governor. During a debate with Gregg,
Grandmaison tried to laugh off any such comparison by pointing out
that he looked nothing like the Massachusetts governor.
   ``I'm the one with the double chin,'' he said.
   That's not so easy for Democrat Ben Nelson, running against
Republican Gov. Kay Orr of Nebraska.
   ``The Michael Dukakis of the Midwest,'' is how the Orr camp
refers to Nelson. So far, at least, Nelson leads Orr in opinion
polls - despite his hair and eyebrows and nose.
   David Worley is running against Rep. Newt Gingrich, the Georgia
Republican who is House minority whip. Gingrich repeatedly
characterizes Worley as a liberal. The proof? He voted for Mondale
in 1984 and Dukakis in 1988.
   David Walters did more than just vote for Dukakis. He ran the
Democratic nominee's Oklahoma campaign.
   Or as Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Price puts it,
Walters tried to ``ram Michael Dukakis down the throats'' of
Oklahomans.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airline cabin crews could save lives by telling
passengers before takeoff how to brace themselves for a crash,
medical investigators said Thursday in a report on an accident that
killed 47 people.
   A separate report released Thursday by the Department of
Transport's Air Accidents Investigation Branch blamed pilot error
for the crash of a British Midland Airways 737-400 jet on Jan. 8,
1989.
   The jet developed trouble in its left engine but the pilots
mistakenly shut off the right engine before attempting an emergency
landing at East Midlands airport near Kegworth, 20 miles northwest
of Leicester.
   Thirty-nine passengers died on impact as the plane crashed short
of the runway. Another eight died later and of 79 who survived, 74
suffered serious injury.
   The Air Accidents Investigation Branch report concluded the
pilots reacted prematurely to initial engine trouble and ``in a way
that was contrary to their training.''
   Both reports called for study of turning airline seats around so
that passengers face the rear, as in some military aircraft.
   The investigators also recommended research to strengthen
floors, improved designs for seats and seat belts, engine
modifications and improved cockpit displays and pilot training.
   The Civil Aviation Authority, the government agency responsible
for airline operations and safety, said research would continue
into the best position to brace for a crash as well as the possible
introduction of rear-facing seats.
   ``The preliminary results of this research indicate that even a
small change in the passenger brace position might improve
survivability or reduce the degree of injury,'' the authority said
in a statement later.
   The Aviation Authority said shoulder harnesses and air bags were
also possible areas for research.
   The medical report by the University of Nottingham Medical
School, commissioned by the Aviation Authority recommended that the
braced crash position be demonstrated before every flight. It said
that was more important than the routine demonstration of life
jackets.
   The report said many leg injuries suffered by 57 passengers were
caused by floors disintegrating and seats collapsing in the forward
cabin. Seventy-seven survivors had head and face injuries, it said.
   Few of the passengers were in the correct position when the plan
crashed, the report said. The doctors said their new recommended
crash brace position offered ``significant protection against head
injury and concussion.''
   The researchers recommended that passengers bend forward with
their heads resting against the seat ahead. Hands should be clasped
behind heads, with elbows tucked outside the knees. Feet should be
together on the floor, resting slightly behind the knees.
   John Wolfe, managing director of British Midland's parent
company, Airlines of Britain, said the airline would change its
flight safety cards to reflect the new position.
   The British Midland jet was flying from London's Heathrow
Airport to Belfast, Northern Ireland when fan blades failed in the
left engine.
   The government report said the combination of heavy engine
vibration, noise, shuddering and smell of fire was ``outside the
training and experience'' of the pilots.

<HEAD>Tentative Agreement Between Menotti, Festival</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP). - A tentative agreement has been reached
to ensure composer Gian Carlo Menotti's lifelong involvement with
the Spoleto Festival U.S.A., the arts festival he created, the
festival chairman said.
   Spoleto board Chairman Ross Markwardt told The News and Courier
the exact nature of that involvement has not been defined. He said
Tuesday talks may continue several days while specifics are worked
out.
   But Menotti will continue as festival artistic director at least
through next year. Last week Menotti said he wanted to resign, but
he has changed his mind for now.
   ``I promised that I want the festival to go on and will
collaborate, will make peace with anybody,'' Menotti said.
   ``I started the program (for 1991) and I will go through with
it. Then, if it is felt that my services are no longer necessary, I
will retire in good graces without any bitterness,'' the composer
added.
   He and board members have said they had a dispute centering on
the authority and responsibility of artistic director.
   The 79-year-old Menotti started the Charleston festival in 1977.
It is patterned on the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy.

<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter on
Thursday gave Brenda Maxwell's 6th grade class a lesson in the
virtues of potatoes, and found ``a smart bunch of kids'' who
already had a paper spud in his name.
   ``We'd like to present you with a `Yeutter'o potato' name tag,''
11-year-old Crystal Ford told a surprised Yeutter.
   All 25 youngsters in the Van Ness Elementary School classroom
donned similar handmade tags in honor of the secretary's visit that
marked National School Lunch Week and World Food Week.
   Yeutter and seven other top officials at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture discussed the potato in second through six-grade
classes at Van Ness, which has been a ``partner'' of the USDA for
about six years.
   ``Most people don't realize how important a food potatoes are,''
Yeutter said, after distributing white potatoes to each of the
students. ``They are the most important vegetable in the whole
world.
   ``Of course there's broccoli. The president says you shouldn't
eat broccoli but don't pay attention to him,'' he said smiling.
   Yeutter rhapsodized on the merits of the spud, using a lesson
plan developed by John S. Niederhauser, the winner of this year's
World Food Prize for advancing the production and consumption of
potatoes.
   Reneya Gaston, 11, eagerly told Yeutter that water is stored in
potatoes, while two other students traded guesses of 100 pounds and
125 pounds as the amount of potatoes most Americans eat per year.
   Joking with teacher Maxwell, Yeutter said, ``You got a smart
bunch of kids here. They don't really need a teacher.''
   Bernadette Goatley, 11, presented to Yeutter a green school cap,
key chain and a framed copy of the school's vision, ``on behalf of
all potato lovers here at Van Ness.''
   Yeutter left the students a potted leafy green potato plant.
   What did she learn in class? ``We eat a lot of potatoes over a
year. My favorite is french fries,'' said Bernadette.
   After class, Yeutter and the officials put on large white aprons
and served the students a lunch of barbecued chicken, macaroni and
cheese, mixed vegetables, oatmeal roll, fresh fruit and pear
cobbler - but no potatoes.
   The National School Lunch program, established in 1946 and
administered nationally by the USDA, is a federally assisted meal
program that provides balanced, low-cost or free lunches to about
24 million children each school day at 91,500 schools.
   At Van Ness, Principal Cassandra Butler said about 90 percent of
the 280 pre-school through sixth grade youngsters receive free
lunch, while a small percent pay either the reduced fee of 10 cents
or the full price of 40 cents.

<SECOND>25 More Films Added to Registry of Best Movies</SECOND>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-five American movies, as old as ``The
Great Train Robbery'' of 1903 and as recent as ``Raging Bull'' in
1980, were named Thursday to the National Film Registry of the
Library of Congress as outstanding films worthy of historic
preservation.
   The list was announced by James H. Billington, the librarian of
Congress, under terms of a 1988 statute that established the
registry to honor 25 films a year deemed ``culturally, historically
or aesthetically significant.''
   ``This is not Academy Awards night,'' Billington told a news
conference. ``These are not annual lists of the `best' American
films.''
   Rather, he said, they were chosen because they ``impressively
display the depth and variety of the American creative spirit'' in
filmmaking.
   This year's selections join the first 25 films chosen last year
for the registry. Listed alphabetically, the 1990 choices are:
   ``All About Eve,'' made in 1950 by director Joseph L.
Mankiewicz; ``All Quiet on the Western Front,'' 1930, directed by
Lewis Milestone; ``Bringing Up Baby,'' 1938, produced and directed
by Howard Hawks; ``Dodsworth,'' 1936, directed by William Wyler;
``Duck Soup,'' the Marx brothers classic made in 1933, Walt
Disney's ``Fantasia,'' made in 1940.
   Also, Harold Lloyd's ``The Freshman,'' made in 1925; Francis
Coppola's ``The Godfather,'' 1972; Edwin S. Porter's ``The Great
Train Robbery,'' a 12-minute classic made in 1903; ``Harlan County,
U.S.A.,'' 1973, directed by Barbara Kopple; John Ford's ``How Green
Was My Valley,'' 1941; Frank Capra's ``It's a Wonderful Life,''
1946.
   Also, Charles Burnett's ``Killer of Sheep,'' 1977; ``Love Me
Tonight,'' produced and directed by Rouben Mamoulian, 1932;
``Meshes of the Afternoon,'' an 18-minute film directed by Maya
Deren in 1943; ``Ninotchka,'' a 1939 Greta Garbo film directed by
Ernst Lubitsch; ``Primary,'' a Time Inc. film made in 1960.
   Also, ``Raging Bull,'' directed by Martin Scorsese, 1980;
``Rebel Without a Cause,'' the James Dean movie of 1955; ``Red
River,'' made by Howard Hawks, 1948; ``The River,'' a 32-minute
Farm Security Administration film made in 1937; ``Sullivan's
Travels,'' a Preston Sturges film made in 1941.
   Also, ``Top Hat,'' a 1935 musical starring Fred Astaire and
Ginger Rogers; ``The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,'' directed by
John Huston, 1948, and ``A Woman Under the Influence,'' directed by
John Cassavetes, 1974.
   The list was based on 1,500 nominations made by the public, and
narrowed by a 14-member National Film Preservation Board
representing the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the
American Film Institute, movie and television producers, directors,
broadcasters, screen writers, the Screen Actors Guild of America,
film critics and scholars.
   The final choices were made by Billington, a cultural historian
and movie buff, based on consultations with advisers including the
staff of the library's division of motion picture, broadcasting and
recorded sound.
   Films are eligible for the registry 10 years after their first
theatrical release. They need not necessarily be American films,
the library said, but the first 50 movies in the registry all were
made in the United States.
   The Library of Congress contains the nation's largest film
archive, and accounts for more than half the number of films
preserved in the United States. Even so, Billington said, half of
all movies made before 1950 - and 80 percent of those made before
1930 - are lost forever.
   ``The cold, hard fact is that, for all their popularity in
America today, films are an endangered species for the America of
tomorrow,'' he said.
   Billington estimated it would cost a minimum of $600 million to
preserve all remaining American movies on nitrate film, a highly
flammable film that eventually deteriorates into gunpowder.
   Other library officials said the cost of restoring those movies
and transferring them to safety film is probably closer to $1
billion or more. The library's annual budget for film preservation
is about $300,000, officials said.
   Billington said the library is still trying to obtain archival
quality originals of two films selected last year for deposit in
its national film collection. They are ``Some Like It Hot,'' the
Billy Wilder movie of 1959, and ``The Best Years of Our Lives'' of
1946.
   So far, library officials said, six of the 50 listed in the
National Film Registry have been released in colorized versions on
videotape cassettes.
   Under the 1988 law, those taped copies must carry a label noting
that they are colorized versions of black and white films that were
``altered without the participation of the principal director,
screenwriter and other creators of the original film.''
   The six are ``The Maltese Falcon,'' ``Casablanca,'' ``Bringing
Up Baby,'' ``The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,'' ``Top Hat'' and
``It's a Wonderful Life,'' officials said.

   A robotic arm once used in an auto assembly
plant has been programmed to spread tomato sauce, sprinkle cheese
and toss pepperoni onto pizzas in a plan to help handicapped people
work in restaurants.
   Carnegie Mellon University's Pizzabot, which takes orders
verbally and warbles back the command in a computer-generated
voice, was unveiled Wednesday at a Pittsburgh pizzeria.
   The robot's developers say it should open up the food service
job market, which needs workers, to the handicapped by performing
tasks they cannot. The technology already is used in the auto and
electronics industries.
   ``This is an effort to bring humans very intimately into the
loop of robot technology,'' said K.G. Englehardt, director of the
university's Center for Human Service Robotics. ``We'd like to
level the playing field in business for the handicapped.''
   Developers say applications extend beyond helping the
handicapped, citing the increase in repetitive strain injuries to
the wrists and hands and potential dangers in restaurant kitchens.
   ``Humans are thinkers. By nature, we're not good at repetitive
tasks,'' said Roger Edwards, president of Intervention Technologies
Inc., which built the arm. ``Just as we created forklifts when it
became inhuman to lift with our backs, we're learning of the
injuries caused by repetitive, menial work.''
   The Pizzabot, which formerly twiddled knobs on dashboards in
General Motors Corp. cars, stands in the center of a semicircle of
nine bins. Its dimensions match those of a human arm, with elbow
and wrist joints and two pinchers for fingers.
   The arm drops up to nine toppings on pizza dough placed on a
spinning, stainless steel disc. Fluidly and silently, it levels the
toppings with a ladle, passing less than an inch over the surface
of the pizza.
   Ms. Englehardt, proud of the robot's smooth movements, said the
arm is a descendant of robots she programmed to dance ballet.
   ``Psychologically, it's important it move like a human moves,''
she said. ``No one likes to see these jerky motions. That's
scary.''
   Ms. Englehardt said the robot and a handicapped worker together
would be able to do the work of one non-handicapped employee. Human
hands still must shape the dough and place the pie in an oven.
   The arm was displayed at Fox's Pizza Den on Pittsburgh's North
Side and will be used to help train the handicapped for jobs in the
food industry.
   James Fox, chairman of a chain of 130 stores in six states with
headquarters in nearby Monroeville, said he hopes a handicapped
franchisee will be able to open a shop, complete with a robot,
within two years.
   With the meat and potatoes of pizza making in the robot's hands,
a handicapped owner should have more time to manage his business
affairs, said Tom Poppa, who owns Fox's stores in Irwin and
Monroeville.
   ``It's still the American dream to own your own business,''
Poppa said.
   Fox's, CMU and Pittsburgh human services industries and
charities founded Robotic Assisted Employment, a partnership trying
to place robots in the region's restaurants, cafeterias and airline
kitchens.
   Fox, whose father was a disabled war veteran, said he was
motivated to help handicapped people because of frustration he saw
while ``growing up by spending my weekends in veterans'
hospitals.''

<HEAD>Kim Offers to Meet South Korean Counterpart</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY SMITH TUNNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korean Communist dictator Kim Il
Sung on Thursday offered to meet South Korea's president for the
first time since the Korean peninsula was divided four decades ago.
   His offer was contingent on progress in high-level talks between
the enemy neighbors, but it was seen as a positive step toward
easing tension.
   The 78-year-old Kim, head of one of the world's most closed
societies and the longest-ruling Communist dictator, told South
Korea's premier he hoped for progress in a third round of
North-South premiers talks.
   The second round of talks finished Thursday in North Korea's
capital of Pyongyang with no tangible results. Both sides claimed
their differences had narrowed and they agreed to meet again in
Seoul Dec. 11-14.
   If the December talks come off as scheduled, it will mean the
rival Koreas will have met three times in roughly three months to
discuss face-to-face issues at the senior levels of government.
   ``The issues being discussed at the premiers' talks would also
be discussed at the summit talks,'' Kim told South Korean Premier
Kang Young-hoon. ``I want the prime ministers to do a lot of work
so that summit talks can be held ... and bring about good
results.''
   He said the talks between Kang and North Korean Premier Yon
Hyong Muk must show ``visible results'' before a summit can be
planned.
   The premiers' contacts are the highest level talks between the
two sides since the peninsula was divided in 1945 and they hold
great symbolic value as a meeting of two enemy nations. The two
Koreas fought a three-year war in the early 1950s; a peace treaty
was never signed.
   The border between them is tightly sealed and remains one of the
most heavily fortified in the world, with 1.5 million troops on
either side.
   The next and most significant step toward easing decades of
confrontation and beginning efforts toward unification would be a
summit between the Communist leader of North Korea and the
capitalist leader of South Korea.
   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo has called repeatedly for a
summit meeting, but North Korea has not responded.
   Kim's willingness to even consider a summit is surprising to
many South Koreans who for years have assumed change can only occur
when the North Korean leader is dead.
   Partially for that reason, South Korea is obsessed with Kim Il
Sung's health. Television reports of Thursday's meetings talked
excessively about Kim's apparently robust health, his erect
stature, his lack of a reported limp, and his voice, which was
slightly hoarse.
   There was no immediate official South Korean response to Kim's
comments, but officials said privately they viewed them as a step
forward in efforts to improve relations.
   The South Korean delegation returns to Seoul on Friday.
   Reports of the two days of talks in Pyongyang said the
differences narrowed on two different proposals calling for, among
other things, mutual recognition, non-aggression and arms
reductions.
   South Korea proposed a joint statement requiring both sides to
recognize each other's government and cooperate through
multilateral exchanges. North Korea insisted on a declaration of
non-aggression.
   In another development Thursday, South Korean opposition leader
Kim Dae-jung said he would end his 11-day-old hunger strike and
call off a three-month boycott of Parliament if the governing party
agrees to laws for prompt local elections.
   Kim said he had instructed his party's floor leader to complete
negotiations with the governing party by midnight Friday. If there
is no agreement, he warned, the turmoil in domestic politics would
worsen.
   And in downtown Seoul, 11 radical students wielding steel pipes
and firebombs tried to attack the U.S. Embassy but were overpowered
by police, police officials said.
   ``Drive out yankees!'' the students shouted as they were taken
away by police, witnesses said.

   The Senate today voted 55-45 to defeat an
effort to raise taxes on the rich and moderate a Medicare premium
increase as it struggled to complete work on a deficit-reduction
plan.
   The vote killed an amendment by Sens. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., and
Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., that would have scaled back increases in
gasoline taxes and Medicare premiums and substituted a
House-approved, three-pronged attack on those with higher incomes.
   The amendment was one of more than two dozen ready for Senate
consideration, many of which have been designed to move the Senate
bill closer to the soak-the-rich package that won House approval
Tuesday.
   ``Do we want to ask senior citizens in the hospital to pay more
so the wealthiest in our society can pay less?'' Gore asked before
the vote on his amendment.
   ``The middle class has no more to give,'' Ms. Mikulski said.
   Democratic leaders praised the aim of the amendment but said it
would have killed the deficit-reduction package because President
Bush has promised to veto any plan raising the top tax rate on the
wealthiest Americans to 33 percent. The proposal would have raised
that rate from 28 percent.
   ``What we have tried to do is put together a package the
president will sign,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman
of the Finance Committee. ``There is substantial divergence with
what came out of the House. ... We will end up with something that
is in between.''
   The budget bill is on a fast track that congressional leaders
hope could place it on Bush's desk for his signature Friday night.
   Without final action, or at least considerable progress on such
a package, Bush has said he'll shut down the government Saturday
morning, when federal spending authority is due to expire.
   A key element of the Senate's deficit plan is a 9{-cent increase
in the gasoline tax. The Senate voted Wednesday to leave that
provision intact. The Gore-Mikulski amendment would have provided a
6-cent increase.
   The amendment would have been attached to a measure raising
taxes and reducing benefit programs by $250 billion over the next
five years.
   In addition to increasing the tax rate for the wealthiest
Americans, the Gore-Mikulski plan proposed imposing a 10 percent
surtax on those with taxable incomes over $1 million and raising to
25 percent the alternative minimum tax designed to snare well-to-do
investors who have so many deductions that they might otherwise
escape any tax.
   The Senate package appeared to be in considerable trouble
Wednesday after Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, proposed stripping the
9{-cent increase in the gasoline tax. The issue wasn't settled
until almost 14 hours later, just before midnight, when the Senate
heeded pleas from Democratic and Republican leaders and used a
procedural vote to dispose of Symms' amendment.
   ``Once again the American people are going to have their pockets
picked,'' Symms protested.
   ``A vote for this amendment is a vote to destroy this effort at
deficit reduction,'' countered Majority Leader George J. Mitchell,
D-Maine. ``No senator who votes for the Symms amendment should have
the temerity to go anywhere and say they are trying to reduce the
deficit.''
   Symms' amendment, which was put aside on a 59-40 vote, probably
was the biggest challenge facing the bipartisan proposal.
   In addition to raising the 9-cent gasoline tax and the 15-cent
tax on diesel by 9{ cents a gallon, the bill would boost taxes on
alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and such luxuries as expensive cars,
boats, furs and jewelry.
   It would require retirees to pay slightly more for Medicare
coverage of doctors' bills; limit itemized deductions of people
making more than $100,000 a year and raise to $89,000 the $51,300
maximum wage against which the 1.45 percent Medicare tax is
applied.
   A bigger package was shot down by the Senate on a 67-32 vote.
   Sponsored by Sens. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., and Max Baucus, D-Mont.,
it would have included those three tax increases on the wealthy,
moderated the gas tax increase and Medicare charges, restored half
of $15 billion in farm-program cuts that would be required for
deficit reduction, and eliminated the proposed limitation on
itemized deductions claimed by higher-income people.
   Raising the gasoline tax in the name of deficit reduction is one
of the less popular ideas in Congress. The House would not accept a
package that included such an increase, and senators were told
Wednesday that drivers would rebel.
   The $250 billion in tax increases and tightening of Medicare and
other benefits represents about half a promised $500 billion
deficit-reduction plan. The remainder, still working its way
through Congress, would come from reductions in appropriations and
in interest the government pays for borrowing.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister `Clarifies' Commitment To US On Loan Guarantees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Under pressure from Cabinet hard-liners, the
foreign minister on Thursday backed off a promise he made to the
United States that Israel would not settle more Soviet immigrants
in Arab east Jerusalem.
   The change could affect $400 million in loan guarantees the Bush
administration approved last week after receiving the minister's
promise.
   The change of position by Foreign Minister David Levy came in a
letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker III. The letter was
sent Thursday and read aloud on Israel radio. A Foreign Minstry
official confirmed its contents.
   Levy said in the letter that he wanted to clarify ``differing
interpretations'' of a letter he signed Oct. 2 while visiting the
United States to secure the loan guarantees to help finance housing
for Soviet Jews.
   In the Oct. 2 letter, Levy wrote that Israel's policy ``is not
to direct or settle Soviet Jews beyond the green line.'' The green
line divides Arab territories captured by Israel from Jordan and
Egypt in the 1967 war - the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east
Jerusalem - from Israel proper.
   But in his new letter Levy said he ``made no commitment,
directly or indirectly'' not to house Soviet Jews in east
Jerusalem, or even in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   He said, however, that U.S. funds would not be used to build
such settlements.
   The Bush administration considers east Jerusalem occupied land,
along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It has opposed settlement
of Jews on such land as an obstacle to ending the Arab-Israeli
conflict under the U.S. policy calling for trading occupied land
for peace.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir also sought Thursday to reverse
any U.S. conditions that Levy agreed to in his first letter.
``Whomever accepts these conditions doesn't mean he agrees to all
these limitations always and under all circumstances,'' Shamir said
on the radio without elaborating.
   The issue of the loan guarantees has become entangled with
Israel's anger over last week's U.N. Security Council resolution
condemning the Jewish state for the police killings of 19
Palestinians in a riot on the Temple Mount.
   On Sunday, Israel's Cabinet rejected the resolution and said it
would not accept a U.N. investigation of the killings, which
occurred in east Jerusalem on what Israel considers sovereign
territory.
   That same day, Housing Minister Ariel Sharon announced that he
planned to build up to 17,000 new housing units for Soviet
immigrants in Jerusalem in the next three years, most in the Arab
eastern sector. In announcing the plans, Sharon said: ``We never
obligated ourselves not to build in Jerusalem, never.'' Levy made
the promise to Baker before the Oct. 8 Temple Mount riots and has
been called to task since by Shamir and Sharon.
   At the same time, the issue has arisen in Washington, and Baker
has said he considers Levy's commitment on housing to apply to east
Jerusalem. Baker told reporters Tuesday, ``We think the United
States is and should be entitled to rely upon assurances received
from the foreign minister of Israel.''
   But Levy said in his latest letter that was not the case.
   He wrote: ``I want to make sure that you are aware that it (the
earlier letter) made no commitment, either directly or indirectly,
to refrain from building in east Jerusalem, or restricting it, or
in any other place, including Judea, Samaria and Gaza.''
   Judea and Samaria are the biblical names for the West Bank.
   The United States took months to negotiate the loan guarantees
with Israel, at a time when it was trying to bring together Israeli
and Palestinian delegates in the first preliminary peace talks
between the two sides.
   It was also when Palestinian leaders and Arab states were
complaining that the housing of Soviet Jews in the occupied
territories could push out the 1.7 million Palestinians who live
there.
   Only several hundred Soviet families are believed to have
settled in the West Bank or Gaza, but more than 3,000 Soviets have
moved to east Jerusalem where Israel has built a ring of Jewish
suburbs around the Arab city. About 140,000 Palestinians live in
east Jerusalem, along with about 120,000 Jews.
   Israel receives $1.2 billion in U.S. economic aid annually and
is the largest recipient of U.S. assistance.

   The Pentagon on Thursday criticized major
parts of the 1991 military budget approved by congressional
negotiators, but a spokesman said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had
not decided whether to recommend a presidential veto.
   Cheney is on an official visit to the Soviet Union. He has been
apprised by his Pentagon office of Wednesday's outcome of House and
Senate negotiations on defense spending for the fiscal year that
began Oct. 1, said spokesman Bob Hall.
   The bill sets military spending at $288 billion, or $19 billion
less than the Bush administration requested last January. The bill,
which must be approved by the full House and Senate, sharply
reduces spending on major strategic weapons programs and imposes
larger troops cuts than Bush had sought.
   Hall said he could not say whether Cheney will recommend that
Bush veto the bill and that the defense secretary won't know all
the measure's details until it is filed formally in the House and
Senate, probably on Friday.
   Hall said that while he could not speak for Cheney on specific
aspects of the spending bill, others in the Pentagon have raised
numerous objections.
   For example, he said, the $2.9 billion budgeted for the
Strategic Defense Initiative is nearly $2 billion less than Bush
requested and $900 million less than Congress provided last year
for the antimissile research program.
   Hall also cited a provision in the bill requiring a cut of
100,000 troops from the 2.1 million now in uniform. Cheney had
urged Congress to hold the cuts to 80,000.
   The Pentagon also is unhappy with a provision that establishes
new procedures for closing military bases. Hall said this would set
up a ``cumbersome process that appears to be designed to delay and
deter and prevent management decisions.''
   Although the bill makes deeper cuts in military spending and
troop levels than Bush had proposed, Sen. John Warner of Virginia,
the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said he
believed the president would not veto the measure.
   ``I'm optimistic that the president will sign this bill - the
best that could be achieved in this conference, given the
circumstances fiscally,'' Warner said Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   A moderate earthquake jolted Orange
County in Southern California today, breaking glass but causing no
injuries or serious damage.
   The 10:21 a.m. quake, a year and a day after the major quake in
Northern California, measured 4.0 on the Richter scale and was
centered one mile north of Costa Mesa, said Dorothy Jennings of the
California Institute of Technology.
   ``It was a pretty good jolt,'' said Susan Maples, spokeswoman
for South Coast Plaza, one of the nation's largest shopping malls,
which is located close to the epicenter. ``We all got up in the
doorway.''
   She said the only damage discovered immediately was a single
fallen ceiling tile. At the May Co., crystal department sales clerk
Ursula Yang said a few things fell off the shelves and broke.
   Costa Mesa is about 50 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.
   At Disneyland in nearby Anaheim, ``we certainly felt it,'' said
spokesman Bob Roth. ``I don't think the people in the park felt it,
though. There was no response. There was no damage.
   ``Everybody looked a little peaked for a minute there, but
nothing fell down or anything,'' he said.
   Dan Carpenter, service manager at a Von's supermarket about four
miles southwest of the epicenter, said the store's only loss was
about six bottles of wine that fell from a shelf. Canned goods also
were knocked off shelves.
   Gary Gray, owner of Orange Coast Jeep-Eagle Inc. in Costa Mesa,
said: ``It was a severe jolt. The showroom is covered with glass
and we lost about four panes of 4 foot by 12 foot each.'' No one
was hurt, he said.
   Police reported no injuries.
   ``It hit home real hard, just boom, you could feel the rattle
and roll coming, like that wave effect,'' said Officer Bob Crogan
of the Costa Mesa Police Department.
   A magnitude 4.0 to 4.9 quake on the Richter scale of ground
motion is considered small to moderate and is capable of producing
some local damage.
   The quake of Oct. 17, 1989, which measured 7.1 on the Richter
scale, killed 67 people and caused an estimated $7 billion in
damage in the San Francisco-Oakland area of Northern California.

<HEAD>Top 10 Cities at a Glance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a look at the fiscal condition of the nation's 10
largest cities, along with Standard &amp; Poors' rating of each city's
ability to repay its bond investors. The highest possible rating is
AAA, then AA, then A plus, and so forth. The lowest possible rating
is D. The cities are listed by population size, beginning with the
largest.
   
   New York:
   Standard &amp; Poors bond rating: A-
   New York City is facing its worst fiscal crisis since it nearly
went bankrupt in the mid-1970s. Mayor David Dinkins is trying to
plug a $1.8 billion budget deficit in this fiscal year's budget. He
announced plans Tuesday for $1.3 billion in cuts, including layoffs
of least 15,000 city workers.
   The city also has a major crime problem and on Oct. 2, Dinkins
announced plans to hire nearly 8,000 more police officers as part
of a four-year, $1.9 billion effort. But its proposed financing
remains in doubt.
   
   Los Angeles
   Bond rating: AA
   A relatively healthy economy coupled with stringent legislative
spending caps have prevented serious fiscal woes from besetting Los
Angeles.
   However, the $3.6 billion budget approved by the City Council in
June provided for 6 percent cuts in all city departments except
police, emergency medical services and sanitation. Mayor Tom
Bradley said the cuts in the 1990-91 spending plan were intended to
``maneuver a soft landing in order to prevent a crash later.''
   Bradley also declared a municipal hiring freeze that began in
March and lasted through June 30.
   
   Chicago
   Bond rating: A-
   Mayor Richard M. Daley has proposed a $3.1 billion 1991 budget
based on the assumption the city will keep collecting revenues from
what is now a temporary income tax surcharge. But if the Illinois
General Assembly doesn't extend the surcharge beyond June 1991, the
budget would be $75 million short.
   Daley indicated he would propose a supplemental budget in that
likelihood and cautioned that ``essential services'' may have to be
cut.
   The budget includes funds for an additional 600 police officer
and for pay raises worth $71 million to the city's unionized
workers, as required by contract.
   
   Houston
   Bond rating: AA
   After struggling through economic hard times brought on by the
collapse in oil prices in the 1980s, the nation's energy capital
has enjoyed a modest recovery the last several years.
   There have been no budget cuts for the 1990 fiscal year that
began July 1 and no layoffs. For the first time in several years,
the city has seen an increase in property tax values.
   
   Philadelphia
   Bond rating: CCC
   Philadelphia faces a $206 million deficit in the fiscal year
that ends next June 30. Mayor W. Wilson Goode has frozen hiring and
delayed pension fund payments and tax refunds, but the city expects
to go broke by Dec. 1.
   Few taxes can be raised or added without state approval. The
wage tax already is among the nation's highest. A proposal to
impose a half-cent sales tax on top of the state's 6 percent tax
was passed by the City Council but awaits action in the
Legislature. The increase would only raise $45 million a year.
Further budget cuts are difficult, because many expenses are locked
in by long-term labor contracts.
   
   Detroit
   Bond rating: BBB
   Longstanding fiscal problems could worsen because of a fluke of
Michigan law. The law allows cities with a population of 1 million
or more to impose special taxes on utilities and paychecks. Detroit
had been the only city to qualify, but preliminary 1990 Census
figures put Detroit's population at 970,000.
   The utility tax generates more than $50 million annually, while
the income tax brings in $190 million. Detroit's budget is about
$1.9 billion. Mayor Coleman A. Young has threatened vast layoffs if
the state doesn't extend the utility tax.
   
   San Diego
   Bond rating: AA plus
   The 1990-91 budget is $956 million. Although it was San Diego's
largest ever, mayoral spokesman Paul Downy said the city had to
freeze some services at the 1989-90 level.
   ``There's been a slight decline in city services but we had no
option, short of raising taxes, and that's something we didn't want
to do,'' Downey said. Still, Downey added that the city is in good
financial shape overall. He said officials are continuing efforts
to ``recession-proof'' the city.
   
   Dallas
   Bond rating: AAA
   Fiscal analysts nationwide point to Dallas as an example of a
city that has weathered tough times by hewing to fiscal
conservatism.
   The 1990-91 budget included some staff cuts to pay for an
increase in police staffing. Overall, spending was cut by slightly
more than $8 million to $1.006 billion.
   Cynthia Marietta, director of budget research, said the city
tried to make cuts without hurting essential services.
   
   San Antonio
   Bond rating: AA
   San Antonio has faced financial problems the past two fiscal
years. In September the City Council adopted a $774.2 million
budget that required the elimination of 225 jobs and an 8 percent
tax rate increase.
   The services cut include public works, parks and recreation, and
libraries. There was much public debate about paying for school
crossing guards until a restaurant chain agreed to help pay for the
service.
   
   Phoenix
   Bond rating: AA plus
   City officials announced delays last month for about 200
capital-improvement projects, which now will take eight years
instead of five. The Phoenix real estate market remains in a slump,
and city officials said the timetable revision was needed because
of slow growth in assessed valuations for property taxes.
   Delayed projects include sewers, parks, low-income housing, fire
stations, improvements to a theater and art museum, and
construction of a science museum and a library.

<HEAD>Troops Wound 35 Palestinians in Gaza Strip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli troops shot and wounded 35 Palestinians
with live ammunition and rubber bullets on Thursday in seven hours
of clashes fueled by army efforts to set up a new lookout post in a
Gaza Strip refugee camp.
   The incident reflected the continuing tension in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip over the Temple Mount killings on Oct. 8
in Jerusalem.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir appealed again Thursday to the
United States and other nations to put the Temple Mount incident
behind them and refocus their attention on the Persian Gulf crisis.
   He defended Israel's rejection of a U.N. fact-finding team,
saying it challenged Israel's control of Jerusalem. Israel seized
east Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   ``Israel can, in no way, sign with its own hands a verdict
abandoning its sovereignty over Jerusalem,'' Shamir told army
radio.
   ``We call on our friends to turn the poor page, to wipe it off
and to concentrate again on the main mission - curbing the terrible
threat to peace and stability in this part of the world,'' Shamir
said.
   Residents of the Gaza Strip's Rafah camp said the incident began
when soldiers raised an Israeli flag on a rooftop in the center of
the camp.
   Scores of teen-agers began throwing stones, and at least eight
military jeeps full of soldiers were sent to try to restore order,
the residents told Arab reporters.
   ``The entire camp was in turmoil for seven hours,'' one said.
   The army said in a statement that ``an army unit in Rafah was
attacked massively by stones.'' It said soldiers responded by
``firing plastic bullets in a controlled fashion.''
   An army official confirmed on condition of anonymity that the
soldiers were setting up a lookout post and said the camp reaction
``was not expected.''
   Arab hospitals said 35 Palestinians were treated for bullet
wounds, most from live ammunition. The army put the toll at 26 and
said most had light wounds.
   On Oct. 8, Israeli police opened fire on Palestinian rioters on
the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, killing at least 19 Arabs and
wounding 140 others. The shooting came after the rioters threw
stones on Jewish worshipers at the Wailing Wall below. The Wall is
also known as the Western Wall.
   It was the worst violence in the 34-month-old Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Some 761 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or
civilians in the uprising, and an additional 281 were slain by
other Arabs as suspected pro-Israeli collaborators. Forty-eight
Israelis also have died.
   The Temple Mount, located in east Jerusalem, is the most
sensitive spot in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Jews revere it as the
site of their ancient temple. To Moslems, it is the place where the
Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven.
   Israel has launched its own investigation into the shooting
deaths, and the three-man commission headed by a former Mossad spy
chief, Zvi Zamir, is expected to conclude its probe next week.
   In Jerusalem on Thursday, city police commanders were quoted as
saying that a force of paramilitary border policemen reportedly
deployed without police knowledge on the Temple Mount may have
fueled last week's riot.
   The disclosure on Israel radio was the first Israeli suggestion
that police might have provoked the violence at the holy site, not
Palestinian demonstrators.
   Arab witnesses have claimed police set off the violence by
firing tear gas, then rubber bullets and live ammunition at Arabs
on the Mount.
   The radio report did not identify the police commanders but said
they made the statement to the Zamir commission, which has kept its
findings private.
   Jerusalem police spokesman Aharon Elhayani declined comment.
   Border police commanders rejected the claims, saying they had
documents proving there had been advance notification of the
paramilitary posting, the radio reported.

<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-five American movies, as old as ``The
Great Train Robbery'' of 1903 and as recent as ``Raging Bull'' in
1980, were named Thursday to the National Film Registry of the
Library of Congress as outstanding films worthy of historic
preservation.
   The list was announced by James H. Billington, the librarian of
Congress, under terms of a 1988 statute that established the
registry to honor 25 films a year deemed ``culturally, historically
or aesthetically significant.''
   ``This is not Academy Awards night,'' Billington told a news
conference. ``These are not annual lists of the `best' American
films.''
   Rather, he said, they were chosen because they ``impressively
display the depth and variety of the American creative spirit'' in
filmmaking.
   This year's selections join the first 25 films chosen last year
for the registry. Listed alphabetically, the 1990 choices are:
   ``All About Eve,'' made in 1950 by director Joseph L.
Mankiewicz; ``All Quiet on the Western Front,'' 1930, directed by
Lewis Milestone; ``Bringing Up Baby,'' 1938, produced and directed
by Howard Hawks; ``Dodsworth,'' 1936, directed by William Wyler;
``Duck Soup,'' the Marx brothers classic made in 1933, Walt
Disney's ``Fantasia,'' made in 1940.
   Also, Harold Lloyd's ``The Freshman,'' made in 1925; Francis
Coppola's ``The Godfather,'' 1972; Edwin S. Porter's ``The Great
Train Robbery,'' a 12-minute classic made in 1903; ``Harlan County,
U.S.A.,'' 1973, directed by Barbara Kopple; John Ford's ``How Green
Was My Valley,'' 1941; Frank Capra's ``It's a Wonderful Life,''
1946.
   Also, Charles Burnett's ``Killer of Sheep,'' 1977; ``Love Me
Tonight,'' produced and directed by Rouben Mamoulian, 1932;
``Meshes of the Afternoon,'' an 18-minute film directed by Maya
Deren in 1943; ``Ninotchka,'' a 1939 Greta Garbo film directed by
Ernst Lubitsch; ``Primary,'' a Time Inc. film made in 1960.
   Also, ``Raging Bull,'' directed by Martin Scorsese, 1980;
``Rebel Without a Cause,'' the James Dean movie of 1955; ``Red
River,'' made by Howard Hawks, 1948; ``The River,'' a 32-minute
Farm Security Administration film made in 1937; ``Sullivan's
Travels,'' a Preston Sturges film made in 1941.
   Also, ``Top Hat,'' a 1935 musical starring Fred Astaire and
Ginger Rogers; ``The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,'' directed by
John Huston, 1948, and ``A Woman Under te Influence,'' directed by
John Cassavetes, 1974.
   The list was based on 1,500 nominations made by the public, and
narrowed by a 14-member National Film Preservation Board
representing the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the
American Film Institute, movie and television producers, directors,
broadcasters, screen writers, the Screen Actors Guild of America,
film critics and scholars.
   The final choices were made by Billington, a cultural historian
and movie buff, based on consultations with advisers including the
staff of the library's division of motion picture, broadcasting and
recorded sound.
   Films are eligible for the registry 10 years after their first
theatrical release. They need not necessarily be American films,
the library said, but the first 50 movies in the registry all were
made in the United States.
   The Library of Congress contains the nation's largest film
archive, and accounts for more than half the number of films
preserved in the United States. Even so, Billington said, half of
all movies made before 1950 - and 80 percent of those made before
1930 - are lost forever.
   ``The cold, hard fact is that, for all their popularity in
America today, films are an endangered species for the America of
tomorrow,'' he said.
   Billington estimated it would cost a minimum of $600 million to
preserve all remaining American movies on nitrate film, a highly
flammable film that eventually deteriorates into gunpowder.
   Other library officials said the cost of restoring those movies
and transferring them to safety film is probably closer to $1
billion or more. The library's annual budget for film preservation
is about $300,000, officials said.
   Billington said the library is still trying to obtain archival
quality originals of two films selected last year for deposit in
its national film collection. They are ``Some Like It Hot,'' the
Billy Wilder movie of 1959, and ``The Best Years of Our Lives'' of
1946.
   So far, library officials said, six of the 50 listed in the
National Film Registry have been released in colorized versions on
videotape cassettes.
   Under the 1988 law, those taped copies must carry a label noting
that they are colorized versions of black and white films that were
``altered without the participation of the principal director,
screenwriter and other creators of the original film.''
   The six are ``The Maltese Falcon,'' ``Casablanca,'' ``Bringing
Up Baby,'' ``The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,'' ``Top Hat'' and
``It's a Wonderful Life,'' officials said.

<HEAD>Stallone Gets 3-Year Court Order to Keep Female Fan Away</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An obsessed fan who has harassed
Sylvester Stallone for years was ordered by a judge Thursday to
stay away from the macho ``Rambo'' and ``Rocky'' movie star.
   Superior Court Judge Irving Shimer granted Stallone's request
for a three-year injunction ordering Elsie Wade to stay at least
200 yards away from the actor's Malibu beach house and his White
Eagle Enterprises.
   Stallone and Ms. Wade didn't attend the brief court session.
   The Santa Monica woman also was prohibited from following or
telephoning Stallone or writing and personally delivering any
letters.
   Gary Compton, the actor's security chief, told the court earlier
that Ms. Wade arrives at the Stallone home between 11 p.m. and 7
a.m. to hand deliver notes.
   One note included a photograph of slain singer John Lennon and a
statement reading, ``Now that's frightening,'' Compton told the
court.
   Over two years, the woman has delivered more than 200 cards and
letters to Stallone's home, placing up to 10 letters or cards a day
in his mailbox.
   Stallone said in a court statement earlier: ``I am extremely
concerned that Ms. Wade may be a great danger and threat to me.''
   Many Hollywood celebrities have been plagued by obsessive fans,
including Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Michael J. Fox, Olivia
Newton-John and Sharon Gless.

   Freedom for British hostages in Lebanon
may take time if the restoration of diplomatic ties between Syria
and Britain is made a condition for their release, a Western
diplomatic source said Thursday.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said he
saw no linkage between British and U.S. hostages. He said there was
``nothing special'' to indicate any U.S. hostages would be freed
soon.
   The Western source responded to comments made by Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa on Wednesday to the NBC television
network.
   In the interview, al-Shaara said the pro-Iranian extremists
holding most of the 13 Westerners missing in Lebanon would take the
hostage issue more seriously if ties were restored between Syria
and Britain.
   ``I can say securing the release of the British hostages would
be easier if there's a diplomatic relationship between Syria and
Britain,'' al-Sharaa said.
   When the hostage-takers know that Syria and Britain have
restored ties, ``certainly they'll take more seriously our pressure
and our efforts,'' he said.
   The missing Westerners are six Americans, four Britons, two
Germans and an Italian. The longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped
on March 16, 1985.
   On Thursday, Sharaa told British journalists that Syria would
keep working to win the release of British hostages, backtracking
from his comments to NBC.
   Syria is the main power-broker in Lebanon, and previous hostage
releases have depended on Syrian help.
   Britain broke relations with Syria in October 1986 after
claiming it had evidence Syrian Air Force intelligence was involved
inan abortive attempt to put a bomb aboard an Israeli airliner at
London's Heathrow Airport.
   Syria has denied involvement.
   The Western source said both Iran and Syria have concluded that
continued captivity for the hostages is in neither nation's
interest.
   He said the recent Syrian-led removal of rebel Lebanese Gen.
Michel Aoun in east Beirut will have a ``positive effect'' on the
hostages because of the diminished role of militias that will
follow.
   Beirut newspapers have reported that one of the British
hostages, Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, would be freed soon.
But informed sources, with some knowledge of the negotiations to
free the captives, said another Briton, journalist John McCarthy,
would be released before Waite.
   Waite disappeared Jan.20, 1987, in Beirut. McCarthy was
kidnapped in Beirut on April 17, 1986. No group has claimed to hold
either man, but they are believed to be the captives of pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem groups.

   A diverse coalition is taking to the
airwaves, handing out leaflets and holding teach-ins in an effort
to awaken opposition to U.S. intervention in the Middle East.
   A round of protests began Thursday at Harvard University, where
students and faculty held teach-ins reminiscent of the Vietnam era.
The events continue through Saturday, when rallies are planned in
at least 15 cities.
   Television ads opposing U.S. intervention and starring Vietnam
veteran Ron Kovic aired for the first time Thursday, and support
was widening for a Marine corporal facing court-martial in Honolulu
after he refused to go to Saudi Arabia with his unit.
   ``The response we've been getting is tremendous, versus how long
it took to build up opposition to the Vietnam War,'' said Charles
Twist, spokesman for the New York Coalition to Stop U.S.
Intervention in the Middle East.
   This time, though, the coalition members range from veterans
groups and labor unions to disabled people and environmentalists.
Groups representing the homeless and the elderly also are involved.
A protest march on Saturday in New York City will begin in Harlem.
   ``It's a big step forward from the '60s when the majority of the
anti-war movement was mostly white and mostly students,'' Twist
said.
   Organizers credit this apparent broad appeal not only to
concerns about the morality of sending soldiers to the Middle East,
but also to the cost.
   ``The front pages are full of the budget crisis,'' Twist said.
``It doesn't take much to make the connection that we're spending
billions to keep our troops there at the same time we're cutting
Social Security.''
   Anti-intervention leaders, who complain they have been virtually
ignored by mainstream media, said the word is being spread.
   ``There's been very little negative response and not a lot of
leaflets end up on the ground,'' said Phebe Eckfeldt, spokeswoman
for the New England Coalition to Stop U.S. Intervention in the
Middle East.
   Veterans group have been particularly active in the opposition.
   ``The days of U.S. veterans blindly supporting their government
are over since Vietnam,'' said Winston Warfield, president of the
400-member Smedley D. Butler Brigade of Veterans for Peace. ``U.S.
soldiers are being asked to pay the ultimate price in a war for oil
and to protect the grotesque profits of multinational oil
interests.''
   Kovic, author of ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' stars in a
30-second television spot, funded by money raised from veteran and
peace groups, and airing in 50 U.S. cities. In it, he says American
troops are risking their lives ``not to defend democracy, but to
protect the big oil companies.'' Kovic is scheduled to address a
Los Angeles rally Saturday.
   Labor unions also have been drawn to the protests.
   ``You've got inflation, budget cuts, joblessness, and now the
war,'' said Nan Genger, an organizer for a United Auto Workers
local that is co-sponsoring the rally scheduled for Boston.
``Working people are under attack.''
   Besides Los Angeles, New York and Boston, protests are planned
on Saturday for Albuquerque, N.M., Birmingham, Ala., Chicago,
Cleveland, Honolulu, Houston, Minneapolis, Olympia, Wash.,
Portland, Ore., San Diego, San Francisco and Seattle.
   They follow rallies held on Tuesday in Honolulu, Washington,
Houston, Seattle and San Francisco in support of Jeffrey Paterson,
a 22-year-old Marine corporal who refused to go to the Middle East
with his unit.
   There also are events planned Saturday supporting U.S. forces in
the Middle East.
   In Atlanta, where protesters plan to gather at a downtown
induction center Saturday, families of soldiers stationed in the
gulf have scheduled a counterdemonstration.
   And in Savannah, Ga., residents will bake and airlift 120,000
brownies to the 24th Infantry Division now in Saudi Arabia.
   President Bush, who has been heckled along the campaign trail
this week, has defended the U.S. involvement amid signs of
decreasing public support.
   ``The bottom line for us is Iraqi aggression will not be allowed
to stand, Saddam Hussein will be held accountable and the
legitimate government of Kuwait will be restored,'' Bush said
Tuesday.
   A recent Washington Post-ABC News Poll showed 60 percent of
people questioned believe the United States should keep troops in
the region until Iraq withdraws from Kuwait. Five weeks ago, the
figure had been 75 percent.

<HEAD>University To Return Rare Music to Austrian Monastery</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A university will return rare copies of
works by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and other composers apparently
stolen from an Austrian monastery at the end of World War II,
officials said Thursday.
   ``We are sad to see them go,'' said John Roberts, chief music
librarian for the University of California at Berkeley.
   The 18 manuscripts include religious works by Mozart and Michael
Haydn transcribed by monks in the 18th century and s- an evening mass -
and liturgical works by
lesser-known composers, Roberts said.
   An Austrian music expert noticed this year that there were
several references to the missing works in a catalogue published by
UC-Berkeley in 1988.
   ``They inquired and we investigated,'' Roberts said. ``It became
clear to us that they had been unlawfully removed during the war
and it seemed appropriate that they be returned.''
   The manuscripts are ``important but not priceless'' parts of the
Berkeley music library, Roberts said. They include 13 copies of
Austrian church music and five Schubert songs, many of which are
unpublished, Roberts said.
   UC-Berkeley has one of the world's foremost music collections.

<HEAD>WPPSS To Try To Keep Options Open To Finish Nuclear Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington state public power officials
said Thursday they will ask the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to
extend a construction permit for a nuclear power plant now in
mothballs.
   An extension for the No. 1 plant at the Hanford Nuclear
Reservation would give the Washington Public Power Supply System
the option of completing the plant that was 63 percent finished
when construction came to a halt in 1982.
   This appears to be the first time any operator has indicated
interest in resuming construction of a commercial nuclear power
plant that was put on hold over the last decade, said Frank
Miraglia, deputy director of the NRC's Office of Nuclear Reactor
Regulation.
   WPPSS officials told NRC staff members during a meeting at
commission headquarters that they have not decided whether they
want to complete the system's No. 1 plant at Hanford or another
mothballed facility, the No. 3 plant at Satsop, Wash.
   The No. 3 plant was 76 percent done when work stopped in 1983.
Construction at the plants was halted due to the default of
municipal bonds and a sharp downturn in energy demand.
   The No. 3 plant's federal construction permit is good until
1999, but the NRC permit issued for the No. 1 plant in 1975 will
expire in June.
   Gerry Sorensen, WPPSS's manager of regulatory programs, said the
supply system will ask the NRC ``probably in February or Marc to
extend the construction permit for the Hanford plant. ``But we have
no direction at this time to pick up the hammer and start building
again,'' he said.
   During Thursday's meeting, WPPSS officials sought the NRC's
cooperation in identifying potential roadblocks to licensing the
plants and reviewing proposed solutions to such concerns.
   ``We would like to enhance the licensability of the plants,''
said Don Bouchey, the supply system's director of licensing and
assurance.
   Sorensen said he could foresee no problems that would be ``show
stoppers ... issues that would stop us dead in our tracks.''
   Miraglia said the NRC will be happy to cooperate, but regulators
will need more specific plans before they can review the licensing
potential.
   Energy demands in the Pacific Northwest are expected to increase
over the next 20 years due to economic growth and the potential for
reduced hydroelectric power as a result of anticipated
environmental protection in rivers where salmon spawn, Sorensen
said.

   The American Civil Liberties Union and a
National Guard official on Thursday criticized Mayor Marion Barry's
suggestion that curfews be imposed and troops called out to help
slow the number of drug-related homicides in the nation's capital.
   Barry said Wednesday night that the city's drug wars and
homicide rate are ``out of control.'' He said he may impose a
curfewto keep drug dealers off city streets and may ask President
Bush to send National Guard troops to conduct traffic patrols and
help man roadblocks in drug-ravaged areas.
   But the ACLU and the Guard were cool to the proposals Thursday.
   ``We don't like the idea of curfews in general, and we certainly
look upon any curfew with suspicion,'' said Arthur Spitzer, legal
director of the national capital chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union. ``One of the elements of a constitutional curfew
would be that it would be a short-term response to an emergency,
not an ongoing response to an enduring problem.''
   Said District of Columbia National guard spokesman Harry Dorsey:
``The military is not permit  Before soldiers could patrol the streets,
the president would
have to declare an emergency, Dorsey added.
   ``Typically, the Guard is called out after earthquakes, other
natural disasters, riots, or other short-term things,'' Dorsey
said. Declaring an emergency for an enduring problem ``could be
done, but it would be unusual,'' he said.
   The mayor's remarks came as the city grappled to control a sharp
increase in homicides, which are already on pace to set a new
record - for the third year in a row. Nine homicides were reported
last weekend. As of Thursday, 373 slayings were recorded so far
this year. Police blame more than 60 percent of the killings on
drugs.
   Barry, who is awaiting sentencing on one misdemeanor cocaine
possession charge, made his comments at a candidates' forum. He is
not seeking re-election but is running for a seat on the D.C.
Council.
   City council member John Ray noted that Barry opposed involving
the Guard in the city's drug war two years ago but is considering
that option just three weeks before the election.
   ``It's real interesting that the mayor has gotten religion on
the National Guard,'' said Ray, who opposes calling in the Guard.
``I think this is the mayor's new platform.'' Ray unsuccessfully
sought the Democratic nomination for mayor this year but will keep
his seat on the council.
   Two attempts by the D.C. Council to institute a curfew in the
past two years were struck down in federal court on constitutional
grounds.
   ``There may be a curfew law, somewhere, that has withstood
constitutional scrutiny, but if there is, I am unaware of it,''
U.S. District Judge Charles R. Richey ruled in striking down a city
law barring youths under the age of 18 from congregating on city
streets at night.
   The ACLU had complained that the law violated teenagers' right
of assembly and also prohibited them from traveling to and from
legitimate activities like band practice and athletic events.
   The National Guard already assists the city police department's
drug war by providing sophisticated surveillance equipment and
helicopters for monitoring drug activity, Dorsey said.
   ``If we are asked to do more than that, the city in effect would
be turning their powers over to us,'' Dorsey said.
   Barry said that before deciding on his next step, he will assess
whether a new, 100-officer homicide task force reduces the
killings.

   A police officer stretched the truth when
he reported having a prisoner in custody.
   Officer Will Platts did take a prisoner Tuesday. But the guilty
party was a 7-foot-plus, 25-pound boa constrictor. And for a while
it was Platts' arm that was in custody.
   Platts made the arrest after answering a call from Alton Ray
Kelly about 10:15 p.m. A reluctant bystander held a flashlight to
the snake's head while Platts picked it up.
   ``The snake got a little irritated when I picked him up. He
hissed a little bit,'' Platts said. ``I thought, well, I've got
him. Now what am I going to do with him?''
   Nobody in the neighborhood acknowledged ownership, or even
knowledge, of the snake.
   ``So, much to my wife's dismay, I brought him home until we can
find out what to do,'' Platts said.

   Blanche Maphis celebrated her 107th birthday
Thursday but had little advice for others hoping to survive more

   She was born Oct. 18, 1883, in New Martinsville, W.Va., and
worked as a bookkeeper in Butler until retiring at age 70.
   Mrs. Maphis said she's grateful she got an education. She tried

   Mrs. Maphis has an 81-year-old son, Edward, and two grandsons,
six great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren.

   Drug-store magnate Jack Eckerd said he was
misled into donating $250,000 to the University of South Florida
Eye Institute - a week before its financial collapse. Now he wants
his money back.
   In a Sept. 14 letter to university President Francis Borkowski,
Eckerd said he was shocked to read a newspaper story about the
private institute closing in September. Its building was paid off
in a $14 million bailout from the Legislature and transferred to
the university.
   ``I can't help but feel grossly misled,'' Eckerd wrote. ``I feel
our good faith and trust has been ... maligned.''
   University spokesman Mark Lono said Borkowski would agree to
return Eckerd's money, but the institute foundation's entire board
of directors will make the final decision.
   Steve Pankau, an institute foundation attorney, said the board
probably would review Eckerd's request at its November board
meeting.
   ``No one has indicated an interest in going against his
wishes,'' Pankau said.

<HEAD>County Residents Get Their Say on Times Beach Dioxin Incinerator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LORI DODGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TIMES BEACH, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   St. Louis County voters may oppose a
government plan to build a dioxin incinerator at Times Beach when
they go to the polls Nov. 6.
   But a ``no'' vote isn't likely to halt the project aimed at
cleaning up this community turned toxic ghost-town 20 miles from
downtown St. Louis - not with the Environmental Protection Agency
and Missouri's governor John Ashcroft solidly behind the plan.
   ``We don't have many vestiges of hope left,'' said Jerome
Wallach, attorney for the neighboring town of Eureka and a
spokesman against the incinerator. ``We fought the thing as hard as
we could.''
   For months, Wallach and fellow members of the citizen-based
Times Beach Task Force have been fighting the plan to build a huge
incinerator to burn dioxin-tainted soil from Times Beach and 27
other sites in eastern Missouri.
   Despite assurances from federal and state environmental
officials, they doubt the incinerator's safety. They say it
shouldn't be built in heavily populated St. Louis County, or in the
Meramec River flood plain.
   They're also concerned that - state and federal pledges to the
contrary - Times Beach will become a permanent hazardous waste
site.
   Times Beach has sat empty and fenced-off since 1983, when the
government bought out the town because of the discovery of dioxin
in the soil on the town's streets. The toxic chemical was in the
waste oil sprayed on the streets in the 1970s to keep the dust
down.
   This summer, federal and state environmental officials reached a
cleanup agreement with Syntex Agribusiness Inc. The plan calls for
Syntex to provide about $100 million in cleanup services, including
building and operating the incinerator, building a levee to protect
the incinerator from Meramec River flooding, and demolishing
abandoned buildings at Times Beach.
   Syntex didn't produce the dioxin, but the government considered
the Palo Alto, Calif.-based firm a responsible party because the
chemical was produced by a tenant in a Verona, Mo., plant owned by
a company Syntex later acquired.
   Martha Steinkamp, regional counsel for the EPA, said the plan
adequately addresses all safety concerns. She said the agency would
go ahead with what it had determined to be the best alternative,
despite public opposition.
   All that's left now is for the settlement with Syntex to be
approved by U.S. District Judge John Nangle. Steinkamp said that
could come before the end of the year.
   ``We're interested in getting this process through so we can
hurry up and get the dioxin dug up and incinerated, so we can
dismantle the incinerator, get out of there and return Times Beach
to beneficial use,'' Steinkamp said.
   Ashcroft agrees, said his spokeswoman, Yolanda Murphy.
   ``He would like to see the proposed cleanup proceed,'' she said.
``The governor feels the EPA plan is the best viable alternative in
dealing with the dioxin in a way that would protect both the health
of the people and environment as well.''
   Wallach said task force members had proposed the non-binding
referendum, hoping a resounding ``no'' vote would sway state
leaders, particularly Gov. Ashcroft.
   ``We're not going to change the EPA's mind,'' Wallach said.
``We're hoping that perhaps our elected officials will recognize
that this is an absurd idea.''
   Since the issue reached the November ballot, Ashcroft has made
his support of the cleanup plan clear and hopes for the governor's
intervention have been all but died.
   ``But hope springs eternal, doesn't it?'' Wallach said.

<HEAD>United Way Charities Face Greater Competition</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charities outside of United Way campaigns are
gaining an increasing share of the millions of dollars that
American workers give through workplace campaigns, a report said
Thursday.
   The report was issued by the National Committee for Responsive
Philanthropy, which has campaigned for giving workers access to
newer and smaller charities that are not usually part of United Way
campaigns. The committee, representing more than 300 fund-raising
organizations, was established in 1976 to monitor developments in
philanthropy.
   Alternative organizations are getting 10.1 percent of the money
raised in workplace campaigns, the report said. Ten years ago, it
said, alternative groups got 3.5 percent of the total.
   Among the alternative organizations are some health agencies
such as the Muscular Dystrophy Association; international agencies
such as CARE and Oxfam America; arts funds; the United Negro
College Fund; and agencies which raise money for social action
causes and women's and environmental groups.
   All told, United Way campaigns are expected to raise $3.2
billion in contributions this year, two-thirds of it through
payroll deductions and other employee contribution programs.
Organizations not under the United Way umbrella are expected to
raise $205 million from employee contribution programs.
   ``We have already witnessed the dismantlement of the United
Way's monopoly of workplace fund raising,'' said Robert Bothwell,
executive director of NCRP. ``Our figures indicate that the 1990s
will produce a 20 to 25 percent market share for alternatives to
United Ways.''
   Clark LaMendola, senior vice president of the United Way of
America said the report failed to make clear that United Way acts
as the campaign manager for raising most of the money collected by
the alternative organizations.
   ``We get the volunteers together, we raise the money, we print
the pledge cards, we count the money and we make sure the
organizations get it,'' he said.
   He said the report gives the erroneous impression ``that these
funds are somehow raised independently.''
   Two-thirds of the $205 million expected to be raised this year
on behalf of the alternative organizations will be solicited by
campaigns managed by United Way, LaMendola said.
   The NCRP report said alternative charities made their most
significant gain in the huge Combined Federal Campaign, which
collects contributions from federal employees.
   CFC is the world's largest workplace charity drive. It solicits
contributions from almost five million workers. In 1987, it
collected $187 million.
   In 1980, United Way organizations got 71 percent of all money
collected by the federal drive. By 1989, their share had fallen to
37 percent, the report said.
   ``CFC donors have sent out a message that has been picked up by
workplace giving campaign decision makers across the country, in
both the public and private sectors,'' said Don Sodo, who champions
broader workplace fund drives.
   ``They have demonstrated that they are interested in a wide
variety of charities, including those that provide services not
within the somewhat limited United Way umbrella.''
   Sodo is executive director of National-United Services Agencies,
which represents 87 widely divergent organizations, including the
NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, National Organization for
Women Legal Education and Defense Fund, Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle
Forum, Ralph Nader's Public Citizen and the National Right to Life
Educational Trust.
   The NCRP fought successfully in court and in Congress during the
1980s to broaden CFC drives to include alternative charities,
including some lobbying and advocacy groups. The federal campaign
now collects for United Way, seven other national federations, 220
unaffiliated agencies and thousands of local unaffiliated charities
and federations, the report said.

   About 250 riot police entered the Kyoto University
campus on Thursday and arrested two students occupying an office to
protest a government plan to send troops to the Persian Gulf,
officials said.
   In Tokyo, police said 80 people, most of them women from a peace
group, rallied outside the Foreign Ministry to protest the plan,
which would allow deployment of Japanese soldiers abroad for the
first time since World War II.
   The two students at Kyoto University had barricaded themselves
inside the dean's office since early Wednesday, in one of the first
public protests against the measure, which was introduced in
Parliament on Tuesday.
   There has been a surge of criticism from Japanese media and
politicians over the plan. Opinion polls have shown significant
public opposition to sending Japanese soldiers overseas.
   Opponents say the bill violates the country's pacifist
constitution, which bars the use of force to settle international
disputes.
   Government officials say the bill is constitutional because the
military would be deployed only for non-combat duty under the
auspices of the United Nations. Soldiers would be allowed to carry
small arms for self-defense only.
   The two students arrested in Kyoto were charged with
trespassing, said Kyoto police spokesman Kenichi Yoshino. Police
believe the students belong to a leftist radical group, Chukaku-ha.
   Yoshino said about two dozen radicals demonstrated at the campus
when the riot police arrived, but there were no major incidents.

   Carpino is one of 325 Italians detained in Iraq by the

   More than 80,000 wildly cheering people
crowded a sports stadium Thursday to hear South African leader
Nelson Mandela, who said the welcome made him ``feel like a man
with his batteries recharged.''
   ``I am full of strength and hope after visiting Calcutta,''
Mandela said at the Eden Garden stadium where he was given a mass
reception by the government of West Bengal state.
   The crowd held up portraits of Mandela as he stepped to the
podium, his dark blue suit speckled with petals showered by a
hovering helicopter. Thousands waved flags of the anti-apartheid
African National Congress, of which Mandela is deputy director.
   Thousands of men, women and children stood along the road from
the airport to the Eden Garden stadium, which was decorated with
welcome arches and buntings.
   ``We are overwhelmed by the kindness and honor shown by the
people. ... I feel like a man with his batteries recharged,''
Mandela said.
   He arrived in the city of 12 million residents Thursday on the
last leg of a five-day visit to India. After being released last
year after 27 years in prison, Mandela has traveled widely to speak
with leaders and garner international support for his
anti-apartheid movement.
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh presented Mandela with a $5 million
check for the ANC on Monday, and President Ramaswamy Venkataraman
presented him with India's highest civilian honor, the Bharat
Ratna, or ``India's Jewel.''
   Later Mandela took in the sights at the Taj Mahal in Agra and in
the holy Hindu city of Varanasi.
   He was to leave Friday for Indonesia and will later visit
Brunei, Australia, Japan and Malaysia. He returns home Nov. 4.
   Mandela earlier noted the worldwide movement against apartheid
began in India, which in 1954 became the first country to sever
diplomatic relations with South Africa.
   Mandela paid tribute to Mohandas K. Gandhi, who began developing
his strategy of nonviolent resistance during the 21 years he lived
in South Africa. Gandhi returned to India in 1914 and led the
struggle for indpendence from Britain.

<HEAD>Memorial to Pogo Creator Walt Kelly to Be Dedicated Saturday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Relatives and fans of the late Walt Kelly,
creator of the Pogo comic strip, will travel to the edge of the
Okefenokee Swamp this weekend to open a memorial to the cartoonist.
   The Okefenokee, located just south of Waycross in southeastern
Georgia, is the home of the fictional Pogo Possum and his critter
friends.
   Among those expected at Saturday's dedication of the Walt Kelly
Room at the Okefenokee Heritage Center in Waycross are Selby Kelly,
the cartoonist's widow, and writer Larry Doyle and artist Neal
Sternecky, the team selected by Mrs. Kelly to revive the strip.
   The current version of the strip is distributed by the Los
Angeles Times Syndicate.
   In addition to the dedication, Waycross' annual PogoFest will
include a screening of a film on the life of Kelly, the auction of
six original Kelly Pogo strips and a question-and-answer session by
Mrs. Kelly, Doyle and Sternecky.
   The Kelly estate has donated to the memorial all the things the
artist used to create his menagerie of Albert Alligator, Pogo
Possum, Howland Owl, Churchy Lafemme, Beauregard Bugleboy,
Porkypine and other swamp critters.
   The room, made to resemble Kelly's New York apartment, will
display the portable typewriter, easel, ink bottles, pens and
brushes Kelly used to draw the original Pogo from the 1940s through
the early '70s.
   On permanent display will be Kelly's hat rack with his everyday
coat and hat, as well as his more formal coat and top hat, his
walking cane, his dark-rimmed spectacles, pipes and ashtrays.
   The room also will contain Mrs. Kelly's baby grand piano with
the out-of-print ``Pogo Songbook,'' for which Kelly wrote both
music and lyrics.
   Worldwide interest in Kelly and the Pogo characters runs high.
The Pogo Fan Club has grown 300 percent since 1988, said Steve
Thompson, who runs the international club from Richfield, Minn.
   Thompson said he hears monthly from fans in Canada, Germany,
Denmark, Italy, England and Scotland. Recently, an Australian
chapter was added.
   ``I knew the baby boomers would welcome the rejuvenation of the
Pogo strip,'' he said, ``but I've been pleasantly surprised by the
interest shown by the younger generation.
   ``It's a strip that makes you think. It takes some effort. But
it rewards that effort. That's why I think it's been popular on
college campuses since day one.''

<HEAD>Education Department Rule Comes Under Attack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officers of several degree-granting trade
schools on Thursday attacked as ``cruel'' and ``discriminatory'' a
proposed Education Department rule that changes the way they would
measure a student's academic progress.
   The rule - among a host of regulations proposed to curb abuses,
waste and mismanagement in the embattled federal student loan
program - would redefine the academic year. Trade and vocational
schools would be required to offer courses in ``clock hours,''
rather than credit hours.
   For the half million students attending ``career-specific''
schools, the rule would result in excessively long hours in the
classroom and several extra years to earn a degree, officers of The
Art Institutes International, DeVry Inc., The Fashion Institute of
Design &amp; Merchandising, and ITT Educational Services Inc said at a
news briefing.
   Colleges, universities and most community college programs would
be excluded from the proposed rule, they say.
   The deadline for commenting on the rule ends this month and
officials are lobbying the Education Department and Congress for an
extension so trade school officials can submit alternative ideas.
   The Education Department, under pressure from Congress, has
taken a number of actions to stem student loan defaults that have
spiralled to $7.8 billion. A large percentage of the money is owed
by students who attended trade or vocational schools.
   Robert Knutson, chairman of the Arts Institute, said, ``The
department is trying to get at abuse and we support the
department's goal to do that. It needs to happen. But our students
already are in school more hours than other collegiate institutions
and counterparts.
   ``It's cruel to have our kids ... go to school 40 hours per
week, in the classroom, in order to receive the same credits and
the same amount of financial aid'' as college students, Knutson
said.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos testified last week before a
Senate committee that the clock hour-credit hour conversions are
``highly questionable.'' He said unscrupulous institutions either
compress or expand what they say is classwork time just to
``circumvent the minimum course length requirements'' and
``dramatically increase the amount of student aid funds they
receive for the same course.''
   The department's inspector general learned of a school where a
13-month, 1,300-clock hour X-ray technician program was reported as
converted to 78 credit hours, Cavazos said.
   The proposed rule, published in the Federal Register Oct. 1,
requires that a semester or trimester hour include at least 37.5
clock hours of instruction, while a quarter hour include at least
25 clock hours of instruction.
   Sharon Thomas-Parrott of DeVry Inc. described the rule as
``discriminatory'' and said, ``Our students receive three-fifths of
what regular college students receive'' in financial aid and now

   Thousands of voters will be in Saudi Arabia
on Election Day, but a Raleigh company is helping some of them
obtain absentee ballots from home via facsimile machines.
   ``This is an emergency ballot process that's been developed to
make sure the troops get to vote,'' said W. Edward Weems Jr.,
president of Election Technology Co., which is handling fax voting
for U.S. personnel taking part in Operation Desert Shield.
   Weems said elections officials can use the system to fax ballots
through a communications system established with AT&amp;T and the
ballots are delivered to the troops. In almost all cases, soldiers
will mail their ballots back to their local elections board.
   Weems said they have transmitted ballots from 20 states. Some
states have not yet determined if they can send ballots over
telephone lines, Weems said. He said elections officials in
Connecticut told him Thursday that their laws prohibit the
transmission of ballots.
   ``It's a whole new approach to ensuring that people get to vote
who are out of the country,'' Weems said. ``They're scratching
their heads, some of them are.''
   Some states are allowing troops to apply for absentee ballots
through the system, Weems said.
   North Carolina is one of the states using the service. State
Board of Elections director Alex Brock said he is convinced that
adequate safeguards are in place to prevent fraud.
   ``We think the safeguards are sufficient,'' Brock said. ``I
won't go into all of them. Many of these individuals are and were
registered voters before they left our state. Therefore their
registration can be checked and it can be determined right away if
that person has or has not voted previously.''
   Election Technology Co. won a Department of Defense contract to
provide the service. Election Technology is a joint venture between
Independent Election Corporation of America and Office Technology
Corp. of Raleigh, Weems said.
   Independent Election Corporation of Lake Success, N.Y., is the
nation's largest processor of corporate proxy ballots and Office
Technology designs voting systems, Weems said.

   The United States on Thursday pushed for
the swift passage of a new Security Council resolution condemning
Iraq's human rights violations in Kuwait and demanding the release
of all hostages held by Baghdad.
   ``It's one we hope will pass quickly,'' a State Department
official said on condition of anonymity. However, no formal council
meeting, or even private consultations of the whole council, have
been scheduled.
   Officials were told the council might act on the resolution over
the weekend.
   The five permanent Security Council members have reached broad
agreement on the resolution, which also lays the groundwork for a
system of compensation. Under the measure Iraq would pay for
damages stemming from its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, diplomats
said.
   The British, French, Soviet, Chinese and U.S. ambassadors
continued meeting Thursday to refine the language of the
resolution, while their capitals studied its legal ramifications.
   The other 10 council members may receive the text later, they
said. Since the five permanent members hold veto power, they
customarily reach agreement on a draft text before presenting it to
the other 10 council members.
   According to the draft resolution, Baghdad would be liable only
for compensation, not for punitive reparations, diplomats said on
condition of anonymity.
   Countries that have suffered serious economic losses stemming
from the invasion - such as Jordan, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh
- could apply for compensation out of Iraq's foreign assets, which
have been frozen. They could also apply for compensation from
future oil earnings, the diplomats said.
   The draft would address the mistreatment of Kuwaitis by Iraqi
soldiers, and would also urge Iraq to let all foreign hostages go,
reiterating a resolution the council passed on Aug. 18.
   It would urge Iraq to permit the sending of supplies to Western
embassies in Kuwait City. Foreign missions in Kuwait have had their
water, electricity, and supplies cut off by the Iraqis.
   Iraq says Kuwait is now a province of Iraq and that the
diplomats must move their operations to Baghdad.
   During their private talks, the five permanent Security Council
members dropped a proposal for a war-crimes tribunal for Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, the diplomats said.
   They said the ambassadors wanted to focus on humanitarian issues
in this resolution and avoid specifically targeting Saddam.
   The Americans, in particular, do not want a text on war crimes.
They fear it could spur Arab appeals for similar resolutions
holding Israeli leaders individually responsible for the deaths of
Palestinians in the uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied
territories.
   The United States would veto any such resolution, thus
endangering its fragile anti-Iraq coalition with Arab states.

   The Kansas Republican provided a little vocal assistance to Paul

``Shakespearean Tutor to Mr. Newman.''
   Newman sent a letter to Dole last year asking for guidance in

school production of ``Romeo and Juliet.''
   Newman provided a script, a blank audio cassette and asked Dole,
``Would you do a little Romeo for me on tape? Kansas style?''
   Dole obliged, starting with the line, ``What light through

   Newman sent a personal letter of thanks to the senator in August
1989, and a movie representative later called to work out the film
credit, Dole spokesman Walt Riker said Thursday.
   The movie will open No. 21 in New York and Los Angeles. A
nationwide release is scheduled during the Christmas holiday
period, according to a spokesman for the distributor, Miramax

<HEAD>Put Honecker in Nursing Home, Says Former East German Dissident</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Erich Honecker fell from power in East Germany one
year ago Thursday, and a dissident who helped topple him said it's
time to put the aging Communist in a nursing home.
   Baerbel Bohley, one of the most heralded dissidents in East
German history, said she disagrees with widespread demands that the
78-year-old Honecker be prosecuted.
   ``I would find it absurd to put him before a court,'' she said.
   Authorities are trying to decide whether to prosecute Honecker
on charges of corruption, harboring leftist terrorists and ordering
authorities to shoot people who tried to flee the country.
   Bohley, however, said she believes he should be put in a home
for the aged. He is suffering from kidney cancer and is staying at
a Soviet military hospital near Berlin.
   Bohley led the activist group New Forum, which helped direct the
peaceful street protests that toppled the Communists and opened the
door to unification of the two German states.
   Her group, comprised of intellectuals, artists and veteran
dissidents, found little political success after East Germany's
brief stint as a sovereign democracy.
   The group remains an opposition force in the united Germany,
frequently opposing what it says are heavy handed attempts by
western Germany to impose its will on the former Communist nation.
   Bohley, a painter, is widely respected throughout Germany,
however, as the mother of the revolt and a dedicated activist who
endured years of harassment by the old regime's secret police.
   She met with reporters on Thursday to mark the first anniversary
of the day when Honecker was forced out of power by members of his
party, who were trying to placate the growing masses of protesters.
   A German magazine reported Thursday that Honecker himself blames
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for his downfall.
   The Hamburg-published Stern magazine said in its latest issue
that Honecker made the statement to Heinz Junge, an old friend who
recently visited the former East German leader at the two-room
apartment where he lives on the Soviet military hospital compound.
   ``From the beginning, I was in Gorbachev's way because my
political experience made me see glasnost and perestroika
differently,'' Honecker told Junge, according to Stern.
   Junge, a former member of the Communist anti-Nazi resistance,
and Werner Cieslak, a former member of the leadership of the (West)
German Communist Party, have both visited Honecker, Stern said.
   The magazine printed a photograph of Honecker and his wife
Margot, a former education minister in his government, sitting at a
table with Cieslak in the sparsely furnished apartment.
   Honecker, 78, was deposed at a stormy Communist party meeting on
Oct. 18, 1989, as the ruling party was trying to hang onto power
with thousands of East Germans demonstrating on the streets for
democracy.
   A little more than a week before Honecker's removal, Gorbachev
visited East Berlin and said in a television interview that life
punishes those who are late, an indirect referrence to Honecker's
refusal to accept reforms.
   Junge told Stern that Honecker's condition appears to have
improved in recent weeks and that he had regained some weight.
   Honecker underwent surgery for kidney cancer in January, and was
briefly detained after leaving the hospital. German prosecutors
have opened a criminal investigation against the former Communist
boss, but there is not arrest warrant against him.
   Stern quoted his friends as saying Honecker did not plan to
leave Germany. It said the former Communist leader has been
receiving a monthly pension of $340.

   Predictions of a major earthquake in the
Midwest in early December are without scientific basis and could
even be dad the Bush administration has been trying to come up
with a way to protect the bird while limiting the loss of 20,000
jobs in the timber industry considered to be in jeopardy.
   The owls are rapidly dying off because of intense cutting in the
old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan prompted an uproar among
environmentalists when he suggested the endangered species law be
made more flexible to better take into account economic
considerations in some circumstances.
   The report concluded that the Fish and Wildlife Service ``has
neither developed nor implemented a basic management system for
effective administration of the (endangered species) program.''
   It said investigators found that in addition to the huge backlog
of petitions to list species for protection, the agency also has
failed to develop recovery plans for plants and animals already are
under the law's protection.
   The investigators acknowledged that lack of money is a major
problem.
   The report said the cost of protecting all of the presently
known endangered species is more than $4.6 billion, while the Fish
and Wildlife Service is provided only about $33 million a year to
administer the program.
   It estimated that the cost of simply listing the 601 species
that are current candidates for protection would cost $36 million,
but that the agency has a listing budget of only about $3.5 million
a year.
   The cost of programs designed to ensure the recovery of
protected species could be $4.6 billion, while currently the agency
has only about $8.4 million a year for recovery programs, the
report said.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party said
Thursday it will send a group of lawmakers to Washington to follow
up new apologies by a Cabinet minister for racial remarks that
infuriated black Americans.
   In his remarks on Sept. 21, following a police raid on a Tokyo
red-light district, Justice Minister Seiroku Kajiyama compared the
arrival of foreign prostitutes in Japan to blacks moving into
neighborhoods in the United States and forcing whites out.
   Foreign Ministry officials said Kajiyama apologized in a letter
to the U.S. Congressional Black Caucus, which demanded his
resignation. They said Japanese Ambassador Ryohei Murata delivered
Kajiyama's letter of apology in Washington on Wednesday to Rep.
Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., chairman of the 24-member caucus.
   Murata also asked the caucus to reconsider its proposed
resolution demanding the resignation, but received no immediate
response, an official said.
   The resolution, to be presented to the U.S. House of
Representatives, urges President Bush to demand Kajiyama resign;
asks that Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu officially apologize; and
suggests programs to improve Japanese officials' understanding of
racial issues.
   Murata later delivered a letter from Kaifu to the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People in which the
prime minister apologized for Kajiyama's remarks and pledged to
work for more awareness among the Japanese of American minority
problems, said a Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Kajiyama retracted his comments four days after making them
after civil rights groups in the United States protested. He also
apologized to U.S. Ambassador Michael Armacost.
   Kaifu expressed regret and rebuked Kajiyama. But protests have
continued, and demands for Kajiyama's resignation have grown.
   On Thursday, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary-general of the Liberal
Democrats, said the party decided to send a group of legislators to
the United States on Sunday to make further explanations.
   He said the delegates would meet with congressional leaders,
particularly the Black Caucus, in hopes of heading off the
resolution. He said passage of the resolution ``could damage the
relations between Japan and the United States.''
   In his latest letter, Kajiyama said he did not intend any racial
discrimination in his comments.
   ``I learned again how deeply I have hurt the feelings of the
American people, particularly African-Americans,'' he said.
   ``What I thoughtlessly said on Sept. 21 was wrong and grossly
improper. Although I am acutely aware how difficult it is to heal
the wounds that my remarks inflicted, I will personally do whatever
I can to strengthen Japan's relationship with the African-American
community.''
   Six African ambassadors also condemned Kajiyama's remarks and
delivered a letter of protest to Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama.
   U.S. civil rights groups asked a boycott of Japanese products,
and Mayor Douglas Palmer of Trenton, N.J., called off a planned
visit by a delegation of the Tokyo metropolitan government.
   On Wednesday, Kaifu rejected an opposition demand to dismiss
Kajiyama, saying, ``He deeply regrets the comment and has
apologized to those concerned. I trust that he will be speaking
with more discretion in the future.''
   Other Japanese politicians have offended minorities with public
racial remarks.
   In 1986, Yasuhiro Nakasone, then prime minister, said Americans
have a lower intelligence level than Japanese because the
population includes a considerable number of blacks, Puerto Ricans
and Mexicans.
   In 1988, former Finance Minister Michio Watanabe said American
blacks have few qualms about going bankrupt and implied they walk
away from debts.

<HEAD>Federal Pay Agreement Will Help Boost Morale, Unions Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal workers' pay would be increased by as
much as 5 percent a year through 1994 and employees living in
high-cost cities would receive extra compensation under an
agreement by House and Senate negotiators.
  the compromise on Thursday,
saying it would provide a much-needed morale boost to the 2.4
million federal employees who have faced furloughs and government
shutdowns in recent weeks because of the budget stalemate.
   ``These are people who've been demoralized and beat about the
head and shoulders,'' said John Sturdivant, president of the
American Federation of Government Employees, which represents
700,000 federal workers.
   ``This is a breakthrough that will allow us to keep those people
and attract bright new recruits as well. The taxpayers win on this
one,'' Sturdivant said of the tentative agreement, reached late
Wednesday.
   Studies have indicated that federal workers are paid an average
of 30 percent less than their private-business counterparts. The
new plan is aimed at closing the pay gap within 13 years, said
George King, a spokesman for the 140,000-member National Treasury
Employees Union.
   Under the plan, civil service salaries would be raised as much
as 5 percent each year from 1992 through 1994. For 1991, federal
pay would increase 4.1 percent, a bigger boost than the 3.5 percent
recommended by President Bush.
   The administration has pledged to commit $3.6 billion for the
federal pay plan over the next five years, King said.
   Starting in 1994, federal workers in high-cost cities, such as
Washington, New York, Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco, would
receive even bigger pay raises. Federal workers now are paid the
same no matter where they live.

<HEAD>Carbon Monoxide Reaches `Potential Hazard' Levels in Tractor Pulls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tractor pulls, those rev-`em-up spectacles where
giant machines test metal and mettle in hauling competitions, can
produce potentially hazardous levels of carbon monoxide, U.S.
health officials warned Thursday.
   Carbon monoxide levels at two tractor pulls in 1988 in Canada
``represented a potential health hazard to both participants and
observers,'' the Centers for Disease Control said.
   Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas in exhaust and
smoke that can cause headache, dizziness, cardiac problems and
death.
   Health officials urged officials of the Winnipeg, Manitoba,
arena not to allow future tractor pulls. The management of Winnipeg
Arena agreed, said Rod Thiessen, the arena's director of
operations. ``They've never come back and made them safe enough.''
   Federal health officials aren't sure whether the problem is
peculiar to the Winnipeg arena.
   ``I wish I knew,''said Dr. Ruth Etzel, a researcher with the
Environmental Health Center of the Atlanta-based CDC. ``We would
certainly like to see some data so we would know if this is a
problem.
   ``We were quite surprised at the levels of carbon monoxide that
can build up in these things.''
   The hazard at the Winnipeg arena prompted cancellation of a
February 1989 tractor pull and no future pulls will be held there,
the CDC said.
   Tractor pulls typically feature a dozen or so truck rigs
outfitted with super-powerful engines made of anything from
supercharged car engines to aircraft turbines. The tractor drivers
are professionals who compete by pulling 50-ton sleds across a dirt
floor. A 2{-hour event can feature 25 competitive pulls.
   In a February 1988 pull at Winnipeg, health inspectors measured
airborne carbon monoxide levels averaging 62 parts per million at
the start, or nearly twice the Winnipeg Health Department's
recommended indoor guideline of 33 parts per million in one hour.
By the event's end, the level had risen to 262 parts per million.
   During a November 1988 pull at the arena, roof louvers were
opened, the duration of the event was extended and one fewer pull
was run. Even then, carbon monoxide levels rose more than five
times, from 78 parts per million to 436 parts per million.
   ``The control measures were not effective,'' the CDC said.
   Adverse effects have been reported in people breathing a
constant 15 parts per million, the CDC said.
   Health officials reported no incidents of carbon monoxide
poisoning during either Winnipeg event, although members of the
ambulance crew reported severe headaches, Etzel said.
   Louisville, Ky.-based TNT calls itself the world's largest
promotor of indoor motor sports, attracting 2.5 million fans a
year. It has never had problems like those cited at the Winnipeg
arena, TNT spokesman Mike Weber said from his office in Lombard,
Ill.
   TNT was not involved in the Winnipeg events.
   ``We present motor sports events in all the major arenas across
the country and we take every precaution. We do constantly monitor
our emitted fumes. ... It's worked very well for us,'' Weber said.
   Weber is also director of public relations for the United States
Hot Rod Association. The organization sanctions TNT events.
   Weber said some giant trucks that might perform in outdoor
stadium shows shouldn't be run indoors. ``There are so many
different classifications of vehicles ... some are appropriate for
indoors, and there are some which are not,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda said
Thursday he was ready to open peace talks with leaders of the
three-week rebellion against his government.
   After talks here with French President Francois Mitterrand,
Habyarimana pledged to hold a referendum on a new Rwandan
constitution by 1992. But he said negotiations could only begin
with a cease-fire in effect.
   Habyarimana also said he asked Mitterrand's help in convening a
session of the U.N. Security Council, so that ``those who are
attacking us will cease their aggression.''
   On Wednesday, Habyarimana met with the leaders of Uganda and
Tanzania and agreed to a cease-fire monitored by neutral troops.
The three leaders said they would later call a regional conference
to discuss the future of Rwandan refugees.
   About 1 million Rwandans live in exile, many in the neighboring
countries - Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and Zaire.
   The refugees are mostl members of the Tutsi tribe, as are the
members of the rebel army that invaded from Uganda on Sept. 30.
Habyarimana is a Hutu, the majority tribe in Rwanda.
   Habyarimana said his government ``solemnly declares that it is
ready to receive all the refugees,'' but said international aid
will be needed to accommodate them. Habyarimana previously said
Rwanda, the most densely populated country in Africa, had no room
for the exiles.
   The rebels said Thursday they would be willing to negotiate if
government soldiers stopped killing civilians and if foreign troops
withdrew.
   Zaire has sent as many as 1,000 troops to help Rwanda's army.
France and Belgium, Rwanda's former colonial ruler, also have sent
troops but say they are there only to protect their citizens and
embassies.
   The rebels, enlisted from a 250,000-strong population of Rwandan
refugees in Uganda, accuse Habyarimana's government of corruption,
human rights abuses and failing to repatriate the refugees.
   As many as 10,000 Tutsis were massacred and hundreds of
thousands driven into exile from Rwanda in the 1960s.
   The current conflict has sparked a new wave of refugees. Several
thousand Rwandans have crossed into Uganda since the invasion. Many
say they fled massacres by Rwandan soldiers and zealous Hutu youth
armed with machetes.
   A photographer for The Associated Press on Wednesdsay saw the
aftermath of an apparent massacre when he visited a small village
12 miles north of Rwanda's capital, Kigali.
   The village had been burned to the ground and the bodies of 20
inhabitants hacked to pieces and burned, the photographer said. The
army appeared to be responsible, he said, citing indications the
village was a Tutsi settlement.
   Many of the Tutsi rebels are former Ugandan army soldiers. They
are led by the former Ugandan deputy army commander, Maj. Gen. Fred
Rwigyema, a Tutsi of Rwandan origin.
   Belgium's foreign minister, Mark Eyskens, said Thursday a
solution to the conflict must be found by African nations, but said
the European Community might help with aid.
   Returning home from a peace mission, Eyskens said he and Belgian
Prime Minister Wilfried Martens had told African leaders the
Organization of African Unity should be responsible for monitoring
a cease-fire.
   Habyarimana and the Ugandan and Tanzanian chiefs said Wednesday
the cease-fire should be supervised by an EC peacekeeping force.
The EC at present has no formal mechanism for deploying such
forces.

   The chairman of a House task force on El
Salvador said Thursday the State Department withheld from
Salvadoran investigators important information about the slaying
last year of six Jesuit priests and two others.
   Rep. Joseph Moakley, D-Mass., said he had learned of an
affidavit given by an American Army major to the FBI in January
detailing a threat against the Jesuits by a Salvadoran officer some
10 days before the Nov. 16 killings.
   The American officer later recanted his statement, but the FBI
believed it important to inform Salvadoran authorities and
forwarded it to the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador. U.S. officials
never passed the information along, Moakley said.
   ``At best, I consider this to be an unbelievable and inexcusable
error in judgment,'' he said in a statement, which also made clear
he did not know whether the affidavit was true.
   The State Department had no immediate response to Moakley's
charge.
   A congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the document told of an incident in which Col. Guillermo Benavides
had been angrily ranting against the Jesuits and making threats
prior to the murders.

   Panamanian authorities said Thursday
they broke up a military ring plotting against the government and
named as a coup leader the man picked as security chief following
last year's U.S. invasion of Panama. Attorney General Rogelio Cruz
accused the band of terrorist activities and of conspiring to seize
military installations.
   He said former Col. Eduardo Herrera and a brother, Capt.
Francisco Herrera, were implicated.
   Eduardo Hererra, who took charge of the newly formed Public
Forces after U.S. troops invaded Panama on Dec. 20, 1989, and
ousted Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, was reported out of the
country. His brother apparently is not in custody.
   Col. Hererra retired last August after 23 years of service.
   Noriega, who as chief of Panama's heavy-handed Defense Forces
was de facto ruler of Panama, now is held on federal drug
trafficking charges in Miami.
   The civilian-directed Public Forces were formed to replace the
Defense Forces in a move to demilitarize Panama.
   Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon said Thursday that members
of the Public Forces ``could be connected to the explosion of bombs
in the province of Chiriqui and possibly to some bombs that went
off in the capital.
   ``There are three military men under arrest and being
investigated by prosecutors.''
   Calderon, who also serves as Interior Minister overseeing the
new police force, said no bombs had gone off since the start of the
investigation.
   The explosions damaged electrical facilities and homes of
government officials, but caused no injuries.
   Cruz said the group had plans to take over military bases in
western Chiriqui province.
   He said Capt. Ivan Moreno, subdirector of Public Forces in
Chiriqui, divulged the conspiracy after he was detained. Cruz said
a corporal and a private also were in custody.
   Cruz said plot leaders deceived other members of the Public
Forces, and told them their plan had American support.
   A communique from the presidency said explosions in Chiriqui
``took place on orders coming from Col. Eduardo Hererra.''
   It said Moreno told authorities that last Tuesday ``he was to
receive a signal to put all the military detachments in the
Chiriqui police zone on alert.''
   The communique called the conspiracy part of a national movement
and said Francisco Hererra was a go-between for his brother.
   It said the goal was to take over the province after a
demonstration of public employees that took place on Tuesday.

   Prosecutors said Thursday that Mayor Marion
Barry should not be granted a retrial on his cocaine possession
conviction, arguing there was no evidence jurors were unfairly
influenced in making their decision.
   Barry's attorney has said he should receive a new trial because
some of the jurors in his case witnessed a drug sting operation at
the hotel where they were sequestered and because deputy U.S.
marshals told at least one juror that an alternate would have voted
to convict Barry of all 14 charges against him.
   Barry's jury convicted him of one misdemeanor cocaine possession
charge, acquitted him of another, and was deadlocked on a dozen
other charges, including a possession charge resulting from his
Jan. 18 arrest in an FBI sting operation at a Washington hotel.
   Lawyer R. Kenneth Mundy asked for the retrial in court papers
filed last week. Prosecutors responded in papers submitted
Thursday.
   ``The defendant has not offered any affidavits in support of his
claim, but instead has referred to post-verdict ... interviews with
some of the jurors,'' U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens argued.
``Generally, in order to make a colorable showing of extraneous
influence to justify further inquiry ... the defendant must submit
affidavits or other sworn statements.''
   Stephens also argued that even if Barry were able to prove the
two ``improprieties'' he alleged in his request for a retrial, he
might not be entitled to another trial.
   ``Not every extraneous influence on the jury warrants a new
trial,'' Stephens said, citing a Supreme Court ruling which
indicates that ``due process does not require a new trial every
time a juror has been placed in a potentially compromising
situation.''
   Stephens also insisted that the deputy marshal's alleged
statements could not have influenced the jury, since it voted to
acquit the mayor on one of the two charges it decided.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has set
sentencing for Oct. 26. A pre-sentencing hearing is set for Friday,
and Jackson could rule on Mundy's retrial request at that time.

<HEAD>Coleman Requests Meeting with Bush on Civil Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Transportation Secretary William T.
Coleman pleaded Thursday for permission to make one last
face-to-face pitch before President Bush vetoes a major civil
rights bill designed to combat job bias.
   ``If you veto it, whether such veto is sustained or overridden,
you subject this country and the Republican Party to years of
divisiveness over these issues,'' Coleman said in a letter to Bush.
   The prominent black Republican recounted how Bush called him in
August and ``asked me to get involved in the civil rights bill. ...
You indicated that I could come to see you if there were any
problems. I herewith request such a meeting before you do other
than sign the bill.''
   The House approved the bill Wednesday and sent it to Bush, one
day after the president promised to veto it on grounds that it
would prompt employers to adopt hiring quotas.
   Provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the
workplace to punitive damages in the most extreme discrimination
cases.
   The fiercest disputes, however, have come over proposed changes
in complex rules under which courts decide job discrimination
cases. The changes would make it easier for those filing
discrimination suits to win and harder for employers to defend
themselves.
   Bush said in a letter Tuesday to Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.,
that he would veto the bill because these provisions would force
employers to turn to hiring quotas. The idea is that the use of
quotas would provide employers with a ready-made defense.
   ``All reliable criteria of reason demonstrate that the bill, as
finally passed, is not a quota bill,'' Coleman said.
   ``First, there is not a word in the bill that would require
quotas; in fact, the bill actually provides that a statistical
shortage of minorities or women in the employer's workforce is not
by itself sufficient to hold the employer liable under this act,''
he said.
   ``It further provides that nothing in the bill shall construed
to require or encourage quotas,'' Coleman added.
   Coleman said his meeting also should be attended by Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, Health
and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan and U.S. Civil Rights
Commission Chairman Arthur Fletcher as well as Sens. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa.; Warren Rudman, R-N.H.; John Danforth, R-Mo., and Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah.

   An earthquake that struck a day after
the anniversary of the San Francisco quake shattered a store's
windows and knocked cans from shelves Thursday. No injuries were
reported.
   The quake, centered one mile north of Costa Mesa, hit at 10:21
a.m. and measured 4.0 on the Richter scale, said Robert Finn of the
California Institute of Technology.
   ``It felt like the building was bouncing up and down,'' said
Susan Wood, who was in a fifth-floor City Hall office when the
quake hit.
   The quake's epicenter appeared to be under the South Coast Plaza
shopping mall.
   ``It was a big jolt,'' said Ursula Yang, a clerk in the crystal
department of the mall's May Co. store. ``Everything is back to
normal five minutes after the shock. A few things fell off the
shelves and broke, just a little bit of stuff though.''
   Mall spokeswoman Susan Maple said some customers and employees
crouched under doorways to wait out the quake, but none appeared
seriously alarmed. She said there was no apparent structural damage
to the mall building.
   The quake shattered four plate-glass windows at Orange Coast
Jeep-Eagle Inc. and frightened customers from the glass-strewn
showroom, said owner Gary Gray.
   ``It was a severe jolt,'' Gray said. ``We are going to have an
open air showroom for a couple of days.''
   Dan Carpenter, service manager at a Von's supermarket four miles
southwest of the epicenter, said canned goods were knocked from
shelves and six bottles of wine shattered, but customers took the
quake in stride.
   ``I guess we get enough small tremors and aftershocks, so the
customers all remained calm. They just got startled for a second
and then went on shopping,'' Carpenter said.
   Thequake came one year and a day after a 7.1 temblor killed 67
people in the San Francisco-Oakland area.
   On Wednesday, Californians remembered the death and destruction
that earthquake caused. Across the nation, television viewers
watching the second game of this year's World Series on Wednesday
were reminded of Oct. 17, 1989.
   The quake struck at 5:04 p.m. that day, as the third game of the
World Series was about to begin in Candlestick Park.
   Wednesday's quake in Costa Mesa struck less than 15 minutes
before Vice President Dan Quayle was scheduled to arrive at the
Marine Corps Air Station at El Toro, about 15 miles southeast of
the epicenter. The visit was not affected by the earthquake, said
Quayle aide Craig Whitney.

   Thunderstorms spun off a tornado that caused damage Thursday in
Virginia, and a snowstorm created near-blizzard conditions in
northern Michigan.
   During the afternoon, lines of showers and thunderstorms reached
across central and western New York state, much of Pennsylvania,
eastern West Virginia, western Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,
South Carolina, northern and eastern Georgia and northern Florida.
   In northern Virginia, a tornado damaged several buildings in
Fauquier County. No injuries were reported.
   State police spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell said several buildings in
Remington, a town of 420 residents, were damaged ``and some
people's cars were gone.''
   ``It ran up and down Main Street and tore roofs off some
buildings and tore down some power lines,'' said Dawn Driggers, a
dispatcher at the Fauquier County Sheriff's office.
   Kay Billingsley, wife of Remington Mayor Gerald Billingsley,
said she was at the Town Hall ``when I heard what I thought was a
train coming down the street. ... At that point, I dove under the
desk.''
   In the Great Lakes region, snow fell over northwestern Upper
Michigan and 8 inches of snow covered Calumet. Strong wind produced
near-blizzard conditions plus wind chills that made it feel like
between zero and 5 below zero over parts of Upper Michigan.
   An accumulation of 6 to 12 inches of snow was possible on the
Keweenaw Peninsula.
   Snow also fell over northeastern Wisconsin.
   South of the snow, rain and rain mixed with snow fell over
northwestern Indiana, western Lower Michigan, northeastern Illinois
and southeastern Wisconsin.
   Advisories for frost and freezing temperatures during the night
were posted for Illinois, Indiana, north-central Kentucky, western
Ohio and extreme northern Arkansas.
   High wind warnings were posted for lakes Erie, Huron and
Ontario, eastern New York state and southern New England. Wind
gusted to 43 mph at midday at Albany, N.Y.
   In the West, rain, with snow at higher elevations, extended over
northern California, western through south-central Oregon,
Washington state and northern Idaho into northwest Montana. Up to 3
inches of snow was possible over the higher mountains of northern
California.
   Showers were scattered over central and southern California.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
1.40 inches at Roanoke, Va.; 1.25 inches at Martinburg, W.Va.; 1.05
inches at Eugene, Ore.; and 1.03 inches at Crescent City, Calif.
   In the Atlantic, tropical storm Nana grew to hurricane strength,
with a sustained wind speed of 75 mph. It was more than 400 miles
south of Bermuda, moving toward the north-northwest.
   Bridgeport, Conn., warmed to a record high of 75, and Daytona
Beach, Fla., tied its record of 89.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 11 at Gunnison, Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 41 at
Yellowstone National Park to 92 at Fort Myers, Fla.

   Sen. Jim Exon's 54 Democratic colleagues in

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Don Avenson's final television
blitz in the Iowa governor's race seeks to cast Republican Gov.
Terry Branstad as a protector of the wealthy.
   A new 30-second Avenson commercial says Branstad ``gave millions
of our tax dollars to the big meatpacking companies while he cut
help for Iowa's children and seniors.''
   The spot hits on several of Avenson's campaign themes. It says
Avenson better represents the views of middle-class Iowans and that
Branstad cares only for the wealthy.
   Branstad's campaign makes points by playing off Avenson's image
as a bully and legislative insider for eight years. Avenson's new
ad tries to turn that to his advantage.
   ``Don Avenson, tough enough to fight for you and me,'' the ad
declares.
   Branstad, who has been widening his lead in the polls, has been
running a mix of ads. One spot attacks Avenson for supporting tax
increases. Others featuring Branstad and his family are designed to
build a positive image.

<HEAD>Accused Assassin of Bashir Gemayel Freed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Habib Shartouni, the man accused of
assassinating President-elect Bashir Gemayel in 1982, was freed
after the Syrian military moved into Lebanon's Christian heartland,
his party announced Thursday.
   A communique from the Syrian Social Nationalist Party said
Shartouni was set free Monday, two days after Syrian troops and
Lebanese government forces overran rebel Gen. Michel Aoun's enclave
northeast of Beirut.
   ``Comrade Shartouni has been freed along with several other
political prisoners,'' said the communique, without giving any
further information.
   The party is a pro-Syrian leftist Lebanese group that advocates
the merger of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Kuwait, Israel and Cyprus into
a greater Syria.
   Shartouni was arrested Oct. 24, 1982, hours after a powerful
bomb exploded at the right-wing Christian Phalange Party
headquarters in East Beirut, killing Gemayel and 21 aides.
   Gemayel, then 34, was elected president by Parliament three
weeks before his assassination. He was slated to take the oath of
office a week later.
   The Syrian party considered Gemayel a collaborator with Israel
for supporting its 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Israel invaded Lebanon
to drive Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization from its
main Middle East power base.
   Shartouni was held for four years by the Lebanese Forces, a
coalition of rightist militias founded by Gemayel.
   He was turned over to the government after Amin Gemayel,
Bashir's brother, was elected president.
   Shartouni, who like the Gemayels is a Maronite Catholic, was
held at the state prison in Romieh in the Christian hinterland
northeast of Beirut.
   He was not tried during Amin Gemayel's term nor during the
subsequent reign of Aoun.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force has imposed new restrictions on
low-level flying in the Persian Gulf area in response to a recent
rash of air crashes, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   Lt. Gen. Charles Horner, commander of the Central Command Air
Force in Saudi Arabia, ordered pilots on training missions not to
fly below 1,000 feet. They previously had flown as low as 150 feet.
   The Pentagon issued a statement quoting Horner as saying the new
limit of 1,000 feet is ``not realistic for combat training, but
it'll get the point across. Then we'll work our way back down to
realistic training altitudes.''
   The statement did not elaborate, and Maj. Margaret Sutter, an
Air Force spokeswoman, said she had no further information.
   The action was taken after the Air Force last Wednesday grounded
all warplanes on training missions in the gulf area for one day.
Pilots were given special ``safety awareness'' briefings during the
flight ban, which did not apply to operational missions such as
reconnaissance, border patrols and air-to-air refueling.
   Twenty U.S. military aircraft have crashed in the gulf area
during Operational Desert Shield since the defensive buildup began
Aug. 7. Last week the Pentagon reported three separate air crashes
in which 12 pilots and crew members were killed. Two of the crashes
involved Air Force planes; the other involved two Marine Corps
helicopters.

   The Arab League issued a unanimous
condemnation of Israel on Thursday, but split bitterly over an
unsuccessful bid by Iraq and the PLO to include a denunciation of
the United States.
   The league's 21 members had convened an emergency session
Wednesday night to draft a statement on the Oct. 8 incident in
which Jerusalem police shot dead 19 Palestinians during a riot on
the Temple Mount.
   On Thursday, delegates from Iraq, the Palestine Liberation
Organization, Yemen and Sudan walked out of the meeting, protesting
the defeat of a resolution denouncing the United States.
   An 11-country bloc led by Iraq's adversaries in the Persian Gulf
conflict blocked the PLO-backed statement, which condemned the
United States for ``prorastination and maneuvering'' in response
to the events in Jerusalem.
   The PLO, which withdrew its draft resolution, has criticized the
United States for threatening to veto a harsh U.N. Security Council
resolution condemning Israel for the violence. The milder
resolution that past called for a U.N. inquiry into the shootings.
   Thursday evening the delegates unanimously agreed to adopt a
statement condemning Israel and urging the United States to become
more sensitive to Palestinian rights. The measure also deplored
Washington's alignment with Israel.
   The final resolution also called for sanctions against Israel
because of its rejection of the proposed U.N. inquiry into the
killings.
   A member of the Iraqi delegation, Saad Kacem Hammoudi, told
reporters the four delegations had walked out because they did not
want to provide ``an Arab coverup for American policy.''

   Residents of Ruse, on the Romanian
border, told the government Thursday that the entire city of
250,000 may pack up and seek ``ecological asylym'' elsewhere unless
pollution stops, the state news agency BTA said.
   Ruse has suffered health problems and ecological damage for nine
years because of chlorine gas clouds drifting across the Danube
River from a chemical works in Giurgiu, Romania.
   Protesters demanded quick official action and asked U.N.
Secretary- General Javier Perez de Cuellar for help at a mass rally
organized by the Ruse Salvation Committee.
   BTA said a declaration warned that the population would leave
Ruse for a time to protest the ``chemical warfare'' from Giurgiu if
the government fails to take effective measures to stop the
``chlorine gas attacks'' within a month.
   If that proved unavailing, people would give up Bulgarian
citizenship en masse and ``seek ecological asylum for the entire
city in another country or community of countries,'' BTA quoted the
statement as saying.
   The move was seen as reflecting Ruse's despair over Bulgarian
failure to get the Romanian factory closed down, and followed road
blockades and other ineffectual protests.
   In the letter to Perez de Cuellar, read at the rally, residents
said that in Ruse, ``the fundamental right to health and life is
not granted.''
   They lashed out at ``the diplomatic helplessness and . . .
transparent demagoguery of those responsible on the Bulgarian and
Romanian side.''
   ``We ask you, please use all your political influence, take a
diplomatic initiative so word will spread at the U.N. that Romania
owes 250,000 Bulgarians the right to ecological security,'' the
letter said.

<HEAD>Whistleblowers: IRS `Sugarcoats' Black Discipline Rate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private group complained Thursday that the
Internal Revenue Service is trying to ``sugarcoat'' evidence that
the agency disciplines blacks at a larger rate than other workers.
But the agency said it is making a good-faith effort to uncover the
cause.
   The National Coalition of IRS Whistleblowers issued a copy of a
memo it obtained in which Michael J. Murphy, a deputy commissioner
for the IRS, acknowledged that blacks had been punished at a higher
rate than other workers.
   ``Enclosed is a bar chart which reflects that black IRS
employees are disciplined servicewide at a substantially higher
rate than their percentage in the workforce,'' the memo said.
   The memo - written jointly with the president of the union that
represents IRS workers - asked IRS executives and union officials
to answer a questionnaire about the agency's disciplinary policy to
uncover why the disparity had occurred.
   The memo noted that the IRS and the National Treasury Employees
Union had formed a task force to review the agency's disciplinary
practice and make recommendations on minority employees.
   ``The task force is trying to determine the causes of the higher
rate and the most appropriate solutions to correct the
imbalances,'' the memo said.
   IRS spokesman Henry Holmes said the joint effort by IRS
management and union officials shows the agency is trying to
uncover the causes for the disparity.
   ``We want to find out why. If it's attributable to anything
unwarranted, such as discrimination, we're going to correct it,''
Holmes said.
   Figures show that both black male and female workers are
disciplined at higher rates than their white counterparts, Holmes
said.
   For instance, in 1989, the IRS took 700 disciplinary actions
involving black females, while there should have only been around
400 if the actions were distributed evenly throughout the
workforce, Holmes said.
   There were about 500 actions taken against white females, when
there should have been around 750 under a statistical model
figuring in the entire workforce, Holmes said.
   George King, a spokesman for the 140,000-member Treasury
Employees Union, said the memo shows both sides are trying to
uncover the cause of the imbalance and see if it needs correcting.
   ``Both the union and the agency are doing everything possible to
begin to further identify these disparities and rectify the
situation,'' King said.
   But Mike Lashaway, a spokesman for the whistleblowers group,
said the IRS is trying to ``sugarcoat'' the evidence.
   ``They're trying to shuffle it under the carpet,'' he said.
   ``It's more or less a white man's world within the upper power
structure (of the IRS). It's been going on for years. It's not like
they were blind to it,'' Lashaway said.
   The group, formed in 1985 by the Church of Scientology's Freedom
Magazine, said it had received ``numerous reports of harassment
against minority IRS employees.''
   The government has had numerous legal battles with the Church of
Scientology, many of them concerning taxes and charges brought
against the church by the IRS.

<TEXT>
   Agriculture Minister Carlos Amat y Leon
resigned Thursday, days after stating that the country faces famine
unless loans to farmers are quickly approved.
   Amat y Leon's resignation took effect immediately, the
government news agency Andina reported. Neither the minister nor
the government gave an explanation for his decision. No replacement
was immediately named to the 14-member Cabinet.
   Amat y Leon was one of three members of the Marxist United Left
coalition named to the Cabinet of President Alberto Fujimori, who
took office July 28 under the banner of a tiny party with a
populist ideology.
   Amat y Leon, a former economics professor, said this week that
Peru faced a famine unless $300 million in agricultural loans were
quickly approved for the October to December planting season.
   The government has been slow to approve the loans for fear they
will heighten inflation, which has risen the past two weeks after
declining to 13.8 percent in September, the lowest rate in many
months.
   The country is suffering its worst drought in history and many
of this year's crops have been almost entirely lost.
   Drought is one of many critical problems facing the Fujimori
government, ranging from drug smuggling and inflation to a
10-year-old insurgency by left-wing extremists.
   The district attorney's office in Ayacucho, in the southern
highlands, said Thursday that farmers had reported the discovery of
a grave with at least 15 bodies they say are the remains of
relatives who were detained by police.
   A spokesman for the office, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the farmers claimed their relatives were arrested in an
anti-terrorist operation in September in Chilcahuayco, 9 miles
northeast of Ayacucho.
   Police detectives left Thursday for Chilcahuayco to investigate
the farmers' story, the official said. The armed forces refused to
comment.
   Ayacucho, a departmental capital 230 miles southeast of Lima, is
the birthplace of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla movement.
   The guerrilla war has claimed the lives of over 20,000 people,
most of them civilians, human rights groups say.

<HEAD>Soviet Republics Challenge Gorbachev Decree on Holiday Parades</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parliaments of Latvia and Armenia said Friday
they would challenge President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's decree
requiring all major cities to hold parades on Nov. 7, anniversary
of the Bolshevik Revolution.
   The dispute threatens to turn Revolution Day, one of the top
holidays on the Soviet calendar, into a day of protest for
republics striving for independence.
   The chairman of the National Democratic Party of Georgia also
urged his republic to prevent any parade in Tbilisi, its capital.
   ``The co-called socialist revolution of 1917 ... abolished
democracy and stopped the people's drive for freedom with
bayonets,'' said the party leader, Georgy Chanturiya.
   ``Any attempt to hold a military parade in Tbilisi on Nov. 7 may
have unpredictable consequences,'' the independent Soviet news
agency Interfax reported.
   Armenia's lawmakers declared the 73rd anniversary of the 1917
revolution ``will not be marked by a military parade'' in Yerevan,
the republic's capital, according to the official Soviet news
agency Tass.
   Latvia's parliament passed a resolution saying there was ``no
legal basis'' for a parade in Riga, its capital, according to the
independent Baltic News Service.
   ``A demonstration of Soviet military power will be in
contradiction with Latvia's sovereignty, and it will sharpen the
political situation,'' the Latvian parliament said.
   Latvia, Armenia, Georgia and most of the other 12 Soviet
republics have been pushing for greater autonomy - or, in some
cases, outright independence - from the central government in
Moscow.
   Gorbachev issued his decree Oct. 10 in an attempt to prevent a
boycott by radicals led by the mayors of Moscow and Leningrad. The
mayors have called for abandoning the traditional Revolution Day
festivities, saying deteriorating economic conditions give Soviets
nothing to celebrate.
   November 7 is usually devoted to patriotic marching, flag-waving
and praising the glories of communism. The parades usually include
military equipment, such as tanks and rockets, followed by
``people's demonstrations'' involving thousands of residents in
major cities.
   May Day, another leading Soviet holiday, was marked this year by
counter-demonstrations involving tens of thousands of people in
Moscow. As they passed through Red Square, many shouted ``Resign!''
and jeered at Gorbachev.

<HEAD>Baker Says Declaration of War Against Iraq May Be Unwise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Thursday it would be self-defeating for the administration to
promise Congress a role in deciding whether the United States
should engage in armed conflict with Iraq.
   Testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Baker
raised the possibility that any such commitment would give a
decided advantage to Iraq's military forces.
   Baker reaffirmed that the administration would be willing to
consult the Congress but offered no commitment beyond that.
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., strongly urged that the administration
call on Congress to declare war if the need arises, consistent with
its constitutional responsibilities.
   Though the president is commander-in-chief of the armed forces,
the Constitution says in Article I, Section 8 ``The Congress shall
have power ... to declare war.''
   Weiss suggested that the administration follow the example of
President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who won a declaration of war by
Congress against Japan the day after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.
The World War II declarations of war were the last in U.S. history.
   But Baker replied that a nightmarish situation would result if
tensions in the Persian Gulf escalated during a period when
Congress were not in session.
   ``I really think it would be self-defeating ... if Congress was
called back into session and we had days of debate about what we
should or should not do.
   ``What I can't do is make a general, across-the-board
commitment,'' Baker said.
   Baker had faced similar questioning on Wednesday by the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
   Congress has become increasingly concerned about the situation
as the stalemate in the gulf continues without solution and as the
current session of Congress winds down. Congressional leaders hope
to adjourn by next Friday, normally not to reconvene until January.
   Baker said repeatedly during his appearance that the
administration is seeking a peaceful outcome to the conflict. He
said he did not foresee an early solution because U.N. sanctions
against Iraq will take a ``substantial period of time'' to cripple
the country's economy.
   Committee Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla., opened the hearing by
suggesting the formation of a new group of lawmakers to consult
with the executive branch on a regular basis. Some senators have
made similar suggestions.
   The group would consist of the House and Senate leadership and
the chairmen and ranking members of the relevant House and Senate
committees.
   It could be convened when the Congress is in recess or has
adjourned and would avoid the need for the administration to
consult with all 535 members, Fascell said.
   Rep. William S. Broomfield of Michigan, the ranking Republican
on the committee, opposed Fascell's proposal.
   ``We should never be placed in a situation where a single
American's life is risked in the Persian Gulf because a requirement
to consult with Congress tipped the president's hand to our
adversaries,'' Broomfield said.

   The Soviet Union announced Thursday it would stop
deploying nuclear weapons on ships or aircraft operating on the
Baltic Sea.
   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Kvitsinski made the promise
to the ambassadors of neighboring Baltic states - Denmark, Norway,
Sweden, Finland, Poland and Germany, the official Soviet news
agency Tass said.
   Tass said Kvitsinski handed the ambassadors a note saying the
Soviet Union had given up ``the deployment in peace time of nuclear
arms on Soviet ships and combat aircraft on the Baltic Sea and in
the airspace above the Baltic.''
   The Soviet diplomatic note proposed other countries also pledge
not to deploy nuclear weapons in the Baltic. It said the Soviet
Union was willing to begin negotiations toward that goal ``with
nuclear powers and Baltic states.''
   There was no immediate response from the Baltic countries.

   Iraq on Thursday said it expects war at any
time and is ready to fend off a surprise attack from either the
United States or Israel.
   ``Our people are mobilized. Their morale is very high. Our 8
million (strong) popular army and 1.5 million soldiers are
absolutely ready,'' Information and Culture Minister Latif Nsayief
Jassim told Western journalists summoned to his office.
   Western analysts have said Iraq's army totals about 1 million
men, including reserves.
   ``We are ready for any surprise attack by either the United
States or Israel,'' Jassim said. ``We will never start the war, but
if we were attacked, we will retaliate with our full might.''
   Iraq has repeatedly tried to link Israel with the U.S.-led
multinational force in Saudi Arabia. The force was dispatched
following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion and subsequent annexation of
Kuwait.
   Jassim also reiterated Iraq's stand that ``Kuwait is the 19th
province of Iraq. We cannot leave an inch of it.''

<HEAD>Defense Minister Warns Syria Against Trying to Spread Influence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens warned Syria on
Thursday against trying to spread its influence from Beirut to the
Israeli-controlled security strip in south Lebanon.
   Syrian forces ousted Christian rebel leader Michel Aoun from
Beirut on Saturday and control almost the entire city.
   ``There is a danger that the Syrians, after their success in
Beirut, and their big influence on the Lebanese government of
(President Elias) Hrawi ... will want to perhaps have influence in
... our security zone,'' Arens said, speaking on Israel radio.
   ``I hope they will not do this because this is something we
cannot accept,'' he added.
   Foreign Minister David Levy, speaking on Israel television, said
Israel ``has certain parameters which it sees as a red line. The
Syrians are aware of this and every other element is aware of this
too.'' A violation of such red lines, he warned, would trigger a
serious response from Israel.
   Levy added, however, that Syrian involvement in Beirut does not
constitute a serious threat to Israel.
   When asked if there were signs of a change in Syria's hostility
toward Israel, Levy responded: ``I want to hope so. There are
small, veiled signs. I want to encourage them.''
   Syria, one of Israel's most heavily armed and hostile Arab foes,
has long been a rival to Israel in Lebanon, where each country has
carved out its sphere of influence.
   The two nations have avoided confrontation since June 1982 when
Israel invaded Lebanon to rout Palestinian guerrillas from the
south.
   The Israeli security zone was formed in 1985 when Israel ended a
three-year occupation of south Lebanon. It runs about six to 10
miles north of Israel's border and is patrolled by Israeli soldiers
and an Israeli-supported Lebanese militia.
   Syria maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon and controls most of
Beirut and eastern Lebanon.
   Arens met Thursday morning with visiting British Foreign
Minister Douglas Hurd, who later left for Athens.
   The Israeli defense minister said on radio later that he doubted
the Western standoff with Iraq could be solved without military
action.
   Mentioning the goals of getting Iraqi forces out of Kuwait and
stripping Iraq of its military capability, he said: ``They (Western
countries) certainly would like to do this through diplomatic
means. I cast a lot of doubt on whether this is possible.''
   Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, and President Saddam Hussein annexed
his oil-wealthy neighbor four days later.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Without fanfare, President Bush on Thursday
signed ratification documents for the treaty formally ending the
post-World War II division of Germany.
   The treaty had been signed in Moscow Sept. 12 by Britain,
France, the Soviet Union, the United States and East and West
Germany. It relinquishes all American rights and responsibilities
over Germany and lifts remaining Soviet, French and British
controls over the country as well.
   The Senate gave its consent to ratification 98-0. Bush's
signature was disclosed in a brief White House announcement.
   The four allies suspended exercise of their rights over Germany
Oct. 1 to allow the reunification of Germany to go forward.
   After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the four allies divided the
country and its capital into four occupation zones. The zones of
the three western powers became West Germany and the eastern zone
occupied by the Soviet Union became East Germany; the four
countries continued to retain formal authority over the city of
Berlin.
   Aside from ending the division of the country, the treaty calls
on the Soviet Union to complete the withdrawal of its estimated
370,000 troops from what was East Germany by 1994.
   U.S., British and French troops will remain in Berlin during the
interim.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of this capital
nervously went about their business Thursday after being rattled by
a guerrilla attack overnight, the latest rebel offensive in El
Salvador's decade-old civil war.
   Dozens of explosions from rebel mortars were heard from the
city's eastern outskirts starting at 9:45 p.m. Wednesday and
lasting until about midnight, when army troops said they drove
rebels off.
   Small-arms fire, however, lasted into the early morning.
   As many as 100 rebels appeared to have been involved in the
attack on the Ilopango air base, which is headquarters of the air
force. The base is four miles east of downtown.
   Gen. Rafael Villamariona, commander of the air force, said at a
news conference Thursday that five soldiers were wounded in the
offensive. He said six helicopters and two trucks were also
damaged.
   Reporters were shown the aircraft, but the damage appeared
slight though only a small sector of the sprawling airfield was
seen.
   The guerrillas, in a communique, claimed they damaged most of
the government's helicopter fleet. They charged the government with
covering up the damage.
   The attack came exactly a month after yet another round of
unsuccessful peace talks between rebels and the rightist
government.
   A fifth round of U.N.-mediated peace talks between the leftist
rebels and the rightist government of President Alfredo Cristiani
ended in a stalemate Sept. 18.
   The two sides have agreed to meet again for peace talks in
Mexico before Nov. 4.
   Rebel commanders have said for weeks that a stalemate at the
negotiating table could provoke a major offensive. Disabling the
Air Force fleet would be key to blunting the military's
effectiveness in rebuffing any guerrilla offensive.
   The rebels used an abandoned commercial building in the La Palma
neighborhood adjacent to the airfield as the main staging area for
the attack.
   About 30 empty packing tubes for 60mm mortar rounds, as well as
tubes for launching homemade bombs were strewn about the building
early Thursday.
   A dozen unfired rocket-like weapons that one officer said were
Chinese-made were lined up on the floor. Also in the building were
ingredients for explosives.
   The government indicated it expected more trouble. It broadcast
a communique saying leftist labor and student organizations planned
to launch ``a series of provocative actions of street violence.''
   The insurgents last November launched the biggest offensive of
the civil war. About 1,000 soldiers, guerrillas and civilians died
in three weeks of intense, mostly urban, combat.
   Guerrilla leaders and government representatives have been
negotiating unsuccessfully for more than a year to end the
decade-old civil war. Each side accuses the other of intransigence.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler issued a
statement Thursday noting U.S. and Soviet officials had met in
Washington last week seeking ways to promote peace talks.
   The Soviet and American participants urged intensified
negotiations toward a cease-fire, said the statement, issued
jointly with the Soviet Union.
   It added: ``They also consider that both sides in the dialogue
should refrain from military actions which would damage the
prospects for peace.''
   The statement appeared to be aimed at the rebel Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front. The FMLN maintains a cease-fire can only
be put in effect after substantive agreements on reform of
Salvadoran society are reached.
   FMLN spokesman Miguel Saenz, in an interview in Tegucigalpa,
where rebel leaders met with Honduran President Rafel Callejas,
said the Salvadoran army was negotiating in bad faith. The
government says much the same of the rebels.
   The FMLN insists the military should be drastically reduced in
numbers, and officers who violated human rights be prosecuted. The
military has not rejected a clean-up of rights abusers but says it
would conduct such a purge on its own.
   Soldiers are charged with murdering thousands of suspected
leftists in cold blood during El Salvador's civil war. Last
November's murder of six Jesuit priests who were out of favor with
the military has led Congress to consider cutting military aid to
El Salvador.
   Rep. Joseph Moakley, D-Mass., chairman of a House task force on
El Salvador, charged Thursday that the State Department had
withheld information about the slayings from Salvadoran
investigators.
   Moakley said he had learned of an affidavit given by an U.S.
Army major to the FBI in January detailing a threat against the
Jesuits by a Salvadoran officer about 10 days before the Nov. 16
killings.
   The U.S. officer later recanted his statement, but the FBI
believed it important to pass along to Salvadoran authorities and
forwarded it to the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador. U.S. officials
never passed the information along, Moakley said.
   The killings led to calls to scale back U.S. aid. Since 1980,
the United States has provided $4 billion in economic and military
aid to bolster a succession of Salvadoran governments.
   Rights groups estimate 73,000 people have been killed since the
war began in 1979 in this country of 5 million people.

   Northwest Airlines said Thursday that two

mixture of hand soap and hydraulic fluid were repaired and back in
service.
   Fifty flights were canceled around the country Wednesday and 12
DC-9s were grounded for inspections of hydraulic systems. Northwest
spokesman Doug Miller said tests showed only two of the grounded
planes contained the soap mixture.
   ``Those two systems were flushed last night and replaced and
those planes are back on the flying line as well,'' he said.
   Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons said Wednesday it was an honest
mistake, not sabotage, that led ground workers in Atlanta to fill
the hydraulic systems with the mixture.
   ``It was certainly inadvertent and nothing suspicious,'' Gibbons
said Wednesday. He said an investigation was under way to determine
how it happened.
   Gibbons said he knew of no problems associated with the mixture.
He said there could have been danger if the problem had not been
detected by a mechanic, who noticed the fluid was an unusual color.
   The planes had been flying with the contaminated fluid no longer
than 10 days, he said.

<TEXT>
   The Salvation Army will resume charitable
work in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and China in the next
year, the organization's worldwide commander announced Thursday.
   The Christian organization, which has 1.5 million members
worldwide, was banned from the Soviet Union in 1923 and Eastern
Europe and China when communist regimes emerged in the late 1940s.
   General Eva Burrows, worldwide commander, said officials in
those countries had invited back the army.
   ``We've been out of these areas too long and need to let the
people of those countries know that they have our concern and
support. We are moving quickly to respond to their needs, wherever
we can,'' she said.
   Burrows, an Australian native based in London, made the
announcement at Baltimore-Washington International Airport on her
arrival from Bermuda, where she had toured army facilities.
   She was on her way to Washington for a one-day visit that will
include a meeting with President Bush on Friday.
   Burrows said preparations for the army's return to Hungary,
Czechoslovakia and what was East Germany began weeks ago. She said
she hoped full-scale operations will get under way by next year.
   ``Under the communist regimes there were no charities allowed.
The state was to provide all,'' Burrows said. ``But now they're
realizing opportunities should be opened to charitable
organizations. We've been welcomed everywhere we've been in Eastern
Europe.''
   Initially, the army will work to regain its confiscated
properties, establish new charity centers and recruit members,
Burrows said.
   Later, as it does in nearly 100 other countries, the army will
provide food and shelter to the poor and homeless and will try to
instill its Christian religious message as well.
   Burrows wouldn't attach a dollar figure on the cost, saying the
figure has yet to be established.
   ``We're looking for funds. We're looking for personnel who have
the language of these countries and who are prepared to identify
themselves with these people who are emerging from years of being
under what I call the cold compassionless hand of the
Marxist-Communist philosophy.''
   She revealed that, about a month ago, the army mounted its first
aid effort in the Soviet Union in 70 years, in Leningrad.
   ``We've taken great lorry (truck) loads of foodstuffs and
clothing for the poor because there are a lot of poor people in the
Soviet Union, especially the elderly.''
   Salvation Army ambassadors are in the Soviet Union this week to
help re-establish its continuing work there, she said.
   Burrows said she will meet Friday in Washington with several
eastern European ambassadors to help speed the army's entry into
their countries.

   Crown Prince Felipe presented Spain's top
cultural prize to representatives of the world's Sephardic Jews on
Thursday, symbolically opening the country to descendants of people
forced into exile in 1492.
   Professor Solomon Gaon of New York's Yeshiva University accepted
the Prince of Asturias prize for harmony on behalf of the
international Sephardic community. The prize was one of eight
awarded by the Spanish heir.
   ``In the spirit of harmony of today's Spain and as an heir of
those who signed the expulsion decree 500 years ago, I welcome you
with open arms and great emotion,'' the prince said.
   The 10th annual edition of the prize, named after the title held
by the 22-year-old Felipe, carries a cash award of $50,000 and a
statuette designed by the late Spanish artist Joan Miro.
   Gaon choked back tears as he read his acceptance speech in
Ladino, a dialect of medieval Spanish that is still spoken by some
Jews five centuries after they were expelled from Spain by a royal
edict.
   ``In this world full of struggle and conflict, we hope this
award brings a message of harmony,'' he said.
   Representatives of Sephardic communities in Spain, Latin
America, Greece, Turkey, Israel and Morocco also received
certificates from the prince.
   Felipe called the Sephardic Jews ``a beloved member of the great
Hispanic family'' and praised them for preserving their Spanish
language and culture over five centuries.
   German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher received the
prize for international cooperation for his work to construct a
united Europe, help slow the arms race and defend human rights.
   Genscher reiterated Germany's support of a European political
and monetary unity that extends beyond the borders of the 12-member
European Economic Community to the recently liberated countries to
the east.
   ``Now that the political and ideological walls have come down,
we need to eliminate the economic and social walls that still
divide East from West,'' he said.
   Other recipients included Venezuelan novelist Arturo Uslar
Pietri, who received the prize for letters; Central American
University of El Salvador, for communication and humanities; and
Honduran pharmacologist scientist Salvador Moncada for scientific
research.
   The arts prize went to Spanish painter Antoni Tapies, while
motorcycle racer Alfonso ``Sito'' Pons took home the sports prize.
Spaniard Santiago Grisolia shared the research prize and Rodrigo
Uria won in the social sciences category.

   France on Thursday demanded U.N. Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar immediately investigate allegations that
Syrian forces have executed officers loyal to defeated rebel Gen.
Michel Aoun.
   The Foreign Ministry in a communique said France is trying to
obtain independent information concering reports that scores of
Aoun's followers had been shot.
   The communique said the allegations of atrocities made by
Lebanese Christians ``aroused extreme emotion.''
   Aoun took refuge in the French Embassy in Beirut on Saturday in
the face of an assault on his Christian enclave by Syrian and
Lebanese government troops.
   He urged his followers to surrender and was granted political
asylum by France. Lebanese authorities have refused to let Aoun

<HEAD>Russian Federation Wants Say in Kuril Islands Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union and Japan will be unable to reach
any agreement over the disputed Kuril Islands without the
involvement of the Russian Federation, the republic's new foreign
minister said Thursday.
   Andrei Kozyrev told a news conference ``there is no such
alternative'' to participation by Russia, the largest of the 15
Soviet republics, in any negotiations.
   The group of islands stretching north from Hokkaido were seized
by Soviet troops in the final days of World War II. The dispute has
kept Japan and the Soviet Union from signing a peace treaty to
formally end the war.
   Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin visited the islands in August
and said they should remain under Soviet control, but be
demilitarized. The official Tass news agency said it was the first
time in postwar years that such a high-ranking leader had visited
the islands.
   Kozyrev, in his first news conference since being appointed last
week, also said the Russian Federation planned to set up overseas
embassies or consulates. He did not provide any details.

<HEAD>USDA Rejects Call for Boost in Wheat Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of farm-state Democrats appealed to
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter on Thursday to prop up
slumping wheat prices by raising the government loan rate.
   Yeutter, however, believes boosting the loan price would have a
``devastating'' impact on U.S. grain exports, an Agriculture
Department spokesman said Thursday.
   Wheat prices have fallen under $2.50 a bushel this fall, the
lowest in five years, because of a bumper crops in the United
States and around the world. A year ago, the price would have been
about $3.50 a bushel.
   In a letter to Yeutter, the nine House members said he is using
the loan price ``to manipulate the market and drive market prices
down.''
   ``We feel that the low-price strategy fails our farmers badly,
because it does not allow them a loan price sufficient to pay off
their own cash operating costs,'' the lawmakers said.
   They proposed raising the loan rate from the current $1.95 a
bushel to about $2.65.
   The loan rate is the price at which farmers can take out
government loans, using their grain as collateral. It effectively
puts a floor under grain prices, since farmers usually forfeit
their stocks to the government if market prices fall below the loan
rate.
   Yeutter and others with a market-oriented philosophy say high
loan rates allow foreign competitors to undercut U.S. exports and
encourage farmers to dump grain on the government.
   ``We tried raising loan rates in 1981,'' said department
spokesman Steve Censky, referring to the 1981 farm bill. ``We saw
grain being produced and simply forfeited to the government instead
of going to the market.
   ``It comes down to a fundamental disagreement on philosophy and
policy. The folks who signed this letter are those who favor high
loan rates and have advocated such policies for years.''
   Signing the letter were Reps. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, who
is the majority leader, Jim Oberstar and Tim Penny of Minnesota,
Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Richard
Stallings of Idaho, David Obey of Wisconsin, Pat Williams of
Montana and David Nagle of Iowa.

   Nine people have died in two days in the

Health Department said Thursday.
   Department head Temel Dagoglu said four of the 22 people
hospitalized Wednesday died that day, and five more deaths were
reported among those under treatment on Thursday.
   He said they had picked the mushrooms in meadows near Istanbul
not realizing they were poisonous.
   Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health asked people to refrain from

urged them to seek immediate medical help if they suspected they
had been poisoned.
   It said the symptoms included heart palpitations, a rise in
blood pressure, high fever and circulation problems.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal engineers are stepping up an
investigation of reported brake disc corrosion in all Ford Taurus
and Mercury Sable models, the government reported Thursday.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it had
upgraded the probe from a preliminary evaluation - an examination
of paperwork - to an engineering analysis, in which engineers will
study the possibly defective parts.
   The investigation could result in a recall.
   In an unrelated matter, the agency said it was discontinuing an
investigation of seat separation in the 1988 and 1989 Ford Festiva
and 1985 Toyota vans and cargo vans because it could find no
pattern to incident reports.
   On the brake issue, Ford Motor Co. said it was conducting its
own investigation of all its models that have the same brake rotor
and hub assembly as the Taurus and Sable. They include the Lincoln
Continental, Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar, spokeswoman Joyce
Stinson said.
   The investigation of the Taurus and Sable brake problem is the
second this year. The government opened a preliminary investigation
but closed it several months later, saying there was no evidence of
a widespread defect, Ms. Stinson said.
   Agency spokesman Tim Hurd said there had been six complaints of
front disc brake corrosion in the Taurus and Sable. An estimated
1.8 million of the vehicles are on the road.
   The complaints allege that the discs deteriorate and fail. The
problem has been blamed for one accident and a minor injury.
   The problem appears to be centered in Northern climes where
roads are heavily salted in the winter, Hurd said. Reports also
have come in from maritime areas of Canada, Ms. Stinson said.
   The agency also announced the following new preliminary
evaluations:
   -Ford Bronco and Bronco II, 1986 models, four complaints of fuel
tank corrosion and leaks. An estimated 170,000 of the vehicles are
on the road.
   -Chrysler Eagle Medallion, 1988-89 models, four complaints of
electrical overload, possible cause of two fires. An estimated
33,130 are on the road.
   -Chrysler Jeep Cherokee, Wagoneer and Comanche, 1989-90 models
with front wheel drive. Two complaints of broken left front brake
hoses. An estimated 330,000 on the road.
   -Buick Reatta, 1989 model. Complaints of cars pulling to the
right or left when pressure applied to brake, blamed for one
accident and four injuries. An estimated 6,300 on the road.
   -Honda Accord, 1990 model. Two complaints of stuck locks on
passenger side door, a safety problem in an emergency.

<TEXT>
   It's certain now that infamous Africanized
``killer'' bees will invade southern Texas, officials said
Thursday, touting a plan to slow down the bees if they can get the
money to pay for it.
   Africanized bees are hybrid descendants of bees that escaped a
breeding experiment in Brazil in 1957. They have been heading
toward the United States ever since.
   To the untrained eye, the bees are indistinguishable from
domestic varieties. They earned the nickname ``killer'' bees
because of their tendency to sting in swarms when they perceive an
intruder is threatening their hive.
   According to unofficial estimates, several hundred people
probably have died from Africanized bee attacks since 1957 in South
America, Central America and Mexico.
   The arrival of the bees in Texas seemed more imminent last
November, when a swarm was trapped about 150 miles south of the
U.S. border with Mexico.
   On Monday, U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists discovered
the first swarm of the dreaded bees in a trap set just east of the
border city of Hidalgo.
   A quarantine is already in place. It bans beekeepers or anyone
else from moving bees from an area 100 miles north of the Rio
Grande River.
   The emergency Texas Africanized Honey Bee Management Plan also
includes search-and-destroy missions against the Africanized bees,
enforcing quarantines, public education and research.
   Fowden G. Maxwell, head of the Entomology Department at Texas
A&amp;M University, estimated it would cost $800,000 to carry out.
   Last year the state Legislature denied a funding request for the
plan, though it funneled $100,000 through other programs.
   ``We are worried that other states will decide that we are not
doing our job to manage these bees and they will place a quarantine
on all Texas bees,'' said Maxwell, who supervises the State Apiary
Inspection Service, which regulates honey bees.
   State and federal officials are still hoping the Legislature
will provide more money when it meets in January.
   Their main concern is to reduce economic damage to beekeepers
and farmers. Africanized bees could cause havoc if they mate with
the domestic variety.
   In the mean time, the federal Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service has stepped in. The agency of the USDA brought in 14
apiarists to search a 2-mile radius of the site where the
Africanized swarm was caught Monday.
   It will take the bee experts about three weeks to take samples
and test for Africanization in all managed bee hives and any wild
swarms they find in that area, said Elba Quintero, program manager
of the search. But the inspection service is committed to stopping
only the first five swarms.
   It may be a year before people in the area notice an increase in
wild bee swarms, said Anita Collins, resaarch leader at the Honey
Bee Research Laboratory in Weslaco.
   Although bee attacks are unlikely, she said people should be
aware that ``there's something out there besides rattlesnakes'' to
watch out for.

   Jurors laughed Thursday as a
flustered detective stumbled through her testimony in the obscenity
trial of three members of 2 Live Crew, unable to understand a tape
she made of the group's rap songs.
   The officer had recorded the allegedly obscene Hollywood concert
that led to the arrest of the three, who were charged with
violating community standards of obscenity by singing about oral
and anal sex, among other things.
   The misdemeanor charges against Luther Campbell, Mark Ross and
Chris Wongwon could bring yearlong prison terms and fines up to
$1,000.
   Broward County sheriff's Detective Debbie Werder was one of
eight undercover vice officers who taped the June 10th performance.
Prosecutors asked her to play a few seconds of the cassette tape,
then tell jurors the lyrics.
   She had trouble understanding the scratchy recording and
repeatedly asked it to be played over. Jurors, who worked through
lunch, were clearly irritated, shaking their heads and laughing.
   ``This isn't the type of music I listen to every day,'' Ms.
Werder explained to the court. ``It's not the kind of music I want
to memorize.''
   One female juror nodded off. A young musician on the jury
lightly tapped his feet during the music.
   Testimony was interrupted frequently by objections. And the
jurors, who Wednesday had sought and received permission to laugh
during the trial, loudly exercised that right in the jury room
while the attorneys argued.
   Later the sequestered panel sent out for videotapes, including
``The Sound of Music,'' ``Fatal Attraction'' and ``West Side
Story.''
   The trial was scheduled to continue through the weekend.
   Two weeks ago, record store owner Charles Freeman of Fort
Lauderdale was convicted of peddling obscenity for selling the
rappers' album, ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be.''

   Israel said Thursday it would try to help
the U.N. chief write his report on the killing of 19 Palestinians
in Jerusalem, but stuck to its refusal to receive a visiting U.N.
team of investigators.
   U.N. officials said Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
would have no immediate comment on what his course of action will
be.
   He summoned Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein to discuss the
extent of Israel's cooperation with a Security Council demand that
Perez de Cuellar submit a report on the Oct. 8 killings on Temple
Mount.
   Bein said later he had been called ``to convey some messages
from the government of Israel, and we agreed that we'll cooperate
in trying to find ways if means to facilitate the secretary-general
to write his report, and present it.''
   When asked if Israel would receive the secretary-general's
emissaries, Bein smiled, said ``Thank you,'' and concluded the
briefing.
   Officials said later, on condition of anonymity, that Israel
would send Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to New York
next week with a copy of Israel's official inquest into the
shootings.
   At least 19 Palestinians were killed when Israeli security
forces fired on protesters throwing rocks down on Jews praying at
the Western Wall, more commonly known in the West as the Wailing
Wall.
   Last Friday, the Security Council condemned Israel's security
forces over the incident. The resolution also regretted that
worshipers were injured, its only reference critical of the
Palestinians.
   The council asked the secretary-general to send a team to
investigate the killings and report back by the end of October.
   Perez de Cuellar told the council he needed clarification from
Israel on its cooperation.
   He was adamant on Thursday that he would not prepare a report on
the violence without firsthand information from a U.N. mission. He
was asked if he might prepare a report based on news reports and
other information.
   ``No. . . . That's not what the Security Council is asking us to
do,'' he said. ``They want that I send a mission to the area. They
are not asking me to prepare a report here in New York.''
   Israel rejects an official U.N. mission as violating Israel's
sovereignty.
   ``The mission goes, or it doesn't,'' Perez de Cuellar told
reporters who asked about a possible alternative.
   Israel has said that U.N. officials could enter as tourists, but
the secretary-general has rejected travel on a less than official
basis.
   Most members of the 15-nation Security Council, including the
United States, are urging the secretary-general to press ahead and
send a mission despite Israel's refusal to accept one.

   The city police chief was arrested in the
mayor's office Thursday on federal charges of embezzling at least
$58,000 in police department funds, FBI officials said.
   Mayor Thomas P. Ryan was present during Police Chief Gordon F.
Urlacher's arrest, the FBI said.
   Later in the day, Urlacher pleaded innocent to embezzling and
misapplying public funds, a charge that carries a penalty of up to
10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. U.S. District Judge Michael
Telesca released Urlacher on $50,000 bail.
   Urlacher and five other department employees were suspended with
pay in connection with the ongoing investigation.
   The investigation began Oct. 1 when the FBI was contacted by an
employee in Urlacher's office who claimed to have helped the chief
embezzle money from the department's special investigation funds,
the criminal complaint filed against Urlacher said.
   Since July 1, 1989, the employee, who was not identified, helped
Urlacher embezzle $58,000, said the complaint. ``A significant
portion of said monies were in fact used by Gordon Urlacher to
benefit himself personally,'' the complaint said.
   The special funds included money intended for drug buys during
undercover drug investigations.
   FBI Special Agent Paul Moskal said the amount of money stolen
may have been higher than $58,000. ``There are indications it's
above that,'' he said. ``The exact figures at this point aren't
known and may never be known.''
   In setting bail, Telesca barred Urlacher from leaving the area
and from carrying a firearm.
   Telesca granted Tyler's request to bar Urlacher from any police
department contact during the continuing investigation by the FBI
and the police department.
   Urlacher was ordered to return to federal court Friday for the
setting of a preliminary hearing.
   After his arraignment, Urlacher would not comment on the
charges. ``Obviously this comes as a shock to me,'' he said.
   Urlacher has been chief since 1985 and a member of the
department since 1964. Ryan named Deputy Chief of Administration
Roy A. Irving as acting police chief.

<HEAD>Exit Poll: Tories Trail in Vote for Seat of Slain Parliamentarian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EASTBOURNE, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An exit poll announced early Frida
indicated the centrist Liberal Democrats may defeat the governing
Conservatives in a special parliamentary election to replace a
legislator killed by the IRA.
   A defeat in this coastal town in southern England, a
Conservative stronghold, would come as a stunning setback to Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's Tories.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. exit poll of 2,000 voters here
had the Liberal Democrats taking 47 percent of Thursday's vote and
the Conservatives 45 percent.
   The Labor Party had just five percent and fringe candidates took
three percent, according to the poll.
   The BBC said the margin of error was three percent and that the
contest appeared a cliffhanger.
   Official results were expected later Friday.
   Ian Gow, the previous legislator, was killed July 30 when the
Irish Republican Army blew up his car. His constituents are among
the staunchest Conservatives in the country.
   But Conservative candidate Richard Hickmet, 42, a lawyer, was
accused of overplaying the IRA card in his campaign to get a
sympathy vote.
   A blacklash, combined with disillusion with the Thatcher
government, was likely to slash the Tories' huge majority of nearly
17,000 votes, observers predicted.
   The Liberal Democratic Party ran an aggressive campaign and said
its candidate, David Bellotti, 47, stood a good chance of snatching
the 71,400-voter constituency to pull off a major special election
upset.
   The main opposition Labor Party, which has led in national
opinion poll ratings for more than a year, has no chance in
Eastbourne. At the 1987 general election, Labor ran a distant third
in Eastbourne behind the Liberal Democrats.
   The Liberal Democrats needed a strong showing to revive their
waning fortunes before the next general election, which must be
held by mid-1992.
   The latest national opinion poll, taken by ICM and published
Thursday in The Guardian newspaper indicated Labor had 49 percent
support, the Conservatives 36 and the Liberal Democrats 9.
   The Conservatives have a 97-seat majority in the 650-member
House of Commons. Before voting, the Conservatives had 373 seats,
Labor 226 and the Liberal Democrats 19. The rest were split among
minority regional parties.

   George Washington was found not guilty on Thursday
of treason against the British crown at a mock trial in which his
lawyer argued that the American Revolution was a case of
self-defense.
   ``I am delighted, elated,'' said Washington, played by Bill
Sommerfield. ``Justice has been done. We've been vindicated and now
I must go back and pursue the war with vigor and bring it to a just
conclusion.''
   Sommerfield and actors portraying Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin
Franklin are members of the Royal Pickwickians of Philadelphia, a
troupe that combines acting with historical research.
   Jefferson and Franklin testified at the trial, which pitted
pin-striped American lawyers against British counsel in wigs and
gowns.
   Harold Braff, a New Jersey trial lawyer and one of the team
defending the commander-in-chief of the American Revolutionary
Army, said the British were the ones who declared war on the
colonists - hurting them economically and depriving them of
liberties.
   ``If the British leadership had played their cards right, there
would have been no revolution,'' he said.
   ``The colonialists weren't interested in severing the
relationships. They felt a loyalty to the king but they were
unwilling to have to accept laws from Parliament.''
   The three judges - Lord Bridge of Harwich, a senior British Law
Lord; Sir Patrick Neill, a British appellate judge; and U.S.
Federal Judge A. Sherman Christensen of Utah - were unanimous in
their ruling of innocent. They found that the way Britain governed
the colonies forced the Americans to react.
   The colonists ``only as a last resort were driven to the
Declaration of Independence,'' Bridge said.
   The judges agreed that Washington and all Americans were
entitled to revolt against repression.
   ``The conduct of the Crown was in violation of the right of
self-determination,'' Christensen said.
   Bill Barker, playing Jefferson, spoke softly in a southern
accent and wore a blue ribbon to hold his ponytail. He told the
court he was the governor of Virginia and an author of the
Declaration of Independence.
   Franklin, played by Robert Gray, testified that he had traveled
to England to try to reach a compromise with King George III and
Parliament.
   Prosecuting Washington under the Treason Act of 1351 was Sydney
Kentridge, the human rights lawyer who defended Steven Biko in
South Africa.
   The lawyers agreed to limit the number of objections so the
trial, filmed for screening on British and U.S. television, would
``make good drama,'' said Lanny Kurzweil, a member of the defense
team.
   About 280 court spectators paid $34 each to attend, the money to
go to the International Scholarships for Young Lawyers fund.
   The mock trial came about after Lord Goff, a member of the House
of Lords made the treason charge at a June meeting of the American
Inns of Court Foundation.
   Lawyers from Illinois and New Jersey took up the challenge and
traveled to historic Lincoln's Inn for the trial.
   The Inn, an oasis of Georgian office buildings and tidy gardens
in central London, was founded in the 14th century. It is the
oldest of four Inns of Court that train and admit barristers,
lawyers allowed to plead cases in court.
   Barristers-in-training must spend 18 months following senior
barristers through the courts and the Inns, so-called because many
barristers used to work and live there.
   The American Inns of Court Foundation, with 128 Inns in 38
states, works to bring the same tutorial methods to the U.S. legal
system, matching young lawyers with senior advocates and jurists,
said the foundation's president, Sherman Cohn.

   The Bush administration on Thursday promised
drought-stricken Hungary $47.5 million in agricultural credits and
loan guarantees and called for international lending concessions to
help embryonic Eastern European democracies.
   President Bush also announced during an official visit of
Hungary's Prime Minister Josef Antall that the United States is
lifting travel restrictions on Hungary's diplomats and has agreed
to permit a Hungarian consulate in Los Angeles.
   ``Hungary is no longer an emerging democracy. Hungary is a
democracy,'' Bush said in a speech welcoming Antall to the White
House.
   In keeping with administration support for the switchover from
communism to democratic government and more free-market economies
in Eastern Europe, Bush said he would push the International
Monetary Fund to expand its lending to those countries by making 5
billion available.
   The president said that lending is needed to help compensate for
the economic the new democracies are facing because they support
U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
   ``We understand that the loss of export markets and rising
energy costs complicate your historic effort to transform a
centrally planned economic system to a free-market economy,'' Bush
told Antall.
   The president also pledged to ask the World Bank to accelerate
aid in the energy field, drawing on $9 billion already committed to
Central and Eastern Europe.
   Hungary, suffering from what one U.S. official described as
``internal economic constriction,'' sought U.S. support to
encourage foreign investment.
   ``They asked for American support in giving a strong signal to
foreign investors that Hungary was a good place,'' for investment,
said Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Curtis Kammen.
   Bush gave that signal in his speech, saying that U.S. companies
already have invested more than $500 million in Hungarian
enterprises.
   ``I encourage more American businesses to find out what Hungary
has to offer,'' the president said.
   Bush announced $47.5 million in credits and loan guarantees to
help Hungary cover its grain shortfall of 800,000 tons after its
drought.
   The money will include $40 million in U.S. guarantees for 7-year
commercial credits for U.S. commodities and $7.5 million in
long-term credits on specific items.
   Hungary has the highest per capita debt in East Europe, standing
at $20 billion for a population of 10 million.
   Antall, the first democratically elected Hungarian leader to
visit the White House in more than 40 years, also met with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and with Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher.
   Later, Antall and his wife Klara were feted at a state dinner at
the White House, where guests included actors Kevin Costner and
Tony Curtis, nuclear physicist Edward Teller and fashion designer
Adrienne Vittadini.
   Entertainment was provided by classical pianist Van Cliburn.
   In a toast to the Hungarian leader, Bush applauded Hungary's
struggle toward democracy.
   ``Especially during the past two years a your gallantry has
evoked our admiration. Your example has been our inspiration,'' he
said.
   For his part, the Hugarian prime minister joked that Bush was so
popular in Hungary that he could find future employment there.
   Since the U.S. Constitution limits the president to two terms,
Antall told Bush, ``I'm sure the Hungarian nation would surely
elect you as president.''

<HEAD>ABC Closing Bureaus In Three Cities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although it's still earning money, ABC News will
close its bureaus in Chicago, Boston and Dallas because of lean
times, but will maintain reporters in all three cities, an ABC
spokesman said Thursday.
   The spokesman, Scott Richardson, said no further cuts were
expected. The bureaus will be closed by Dec. 31.
   The move, which leaves ABC with nine U.S. bureaus, comes as ABC
News is undergoing belt-tighting as a result of Persian Gulf
coverage costs and lower-than-expected advertising revenues that
affect all three networks.
   In Dallas, correspondent Charles Murphy will work from his home.
In Boston, a two-man staff will be kept to work with ABC's medical
correspondent, Dr. Tim Johnson, who reports for several ABC shows.
   In Chicago, correspondent Chris Bury will work out of ABC-owned
WLS-TV.
   Twelve off-camera staff members are affected by the closings.
Some will be reassigned or offered other jobs and others will be
let go, Richardson said. He said it was not yet known how many
would be let go.
   CBS, which has seven domestic bureaus, and NBC, which has nine,
have no plans to close those offices, spokeswomen for those
networks said.
   ABC's action was expected. The network earlier put on hold a
planned 1 a.m. to 6 a.m. news feed to its affiliates that would
have begun in January. That operation would have employed 40
people.
   ``I think domestically, this is it. ... This isn't like a
`first-wave' (of layoffs) thing,'' Richardson said.
   ABC News officials have said the division still will earn money
this year, despite the lean times, although it probably will earn
about $25 million less than the $75 million that had been
anticipated.
   NBC News recently said it would let go 25 staff members, but it
isn't a cutback, said NBC spokeswoman Peggy Hubble. Their skills
were just not needed for various projects being planned. Ms. Hubble
said NBC is hiring an additional 100 staff members, the majority
for the 24-hour NBC News Channel for affiliates it is starting next
year.
   The remainder would work for the new ``Real Life With Jane
Pauley'' series that NBC says it will add to its schedule as a
midseason replacement.

<HEAD>Israeli Police Announce Capture of Motorcycle Bandit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police with helicopter support captured
Israel's ``Bikerbank'' bandit Thursday as he attempted to rob his
23rd bank.
   Police Minister Roni Milo announced the arrest on national
radio.
   The suspect, an Israeli in his 30s, was spotted in the Tel Aviv
suburb of Ramat Gan after parking his red and black motorcycle at a
back entrance of a Bank Leumi branch.
   He reportedly fled without entering the bank when he spotted a
police car.
   But a police team already had blocked off the area. Police on
the goound and in a helicopter pursued him for 7{ minutes before he
was captured.
   ``We were very close to the area, heard reports on the radio ...
and noticed a bike rider who fled on a small road,'' police officer
Shlomo Braunstein told a news conference in Tel Aviv.
   ``I was directed into the courtyard where the suspect was and
stopped him. Afterwards we continued searches and found the
suspect's bike and the pistol,'' Braunstein said.
   The bandit - nicknamed ``Ofnobank,'' Hebrew for ``Bikerbank'' -
robbed 22 banks in a dozen towns the past 22 months.
   He became a local hero because of his ability to elude police.
Israel Television had primetime reports on his exploits, and the
daily Hadashot newspaper ran a series of articles trying to pierce
his mysterious ways. There were even T-shirts that said
``Bikerbank.''
   Before Thursday, police had no description of the man, who
always wore a crash helmet during his robberies. The single
fingerprint found had drawn a blank in police computers.
   His method was always the same - striking between 10 a.m. and
noon, robbing the teller nearest the door, firing one shot in the
air from his .38-caliber Smith and Wesson pistol and escaping on
his high-powered motorcycle.
   News reports say Bikerbank's loot totaled $150,000.
   ``Every legend has its end,'' Israel radio said after the
capture was announced.
   An unidentified Israeli told the army radio, ``The banks are
harming us all the time, it's good that somebody harms them once.''
   Milo made reference to such feelings in his statement:
   ``In the course of the various robberies, we have witnessed a
certain feeling of public sympathy for the robber. I'm convinced
that the public today will see the fact of police success ... as a
great public success, too, that this issue at this stage comes to a
positive ending.''
   A Tel Aviv magistrates court issued an order banning publication
of the suspect's photograph or any identifying details about him.
   But before the order was issued, media reports said the suspect
was 37 years old, married, had no criminal past and came from a
``very wealthy'' Ramat Gan family of industrialists.
   According to radio reports, he was captured at the house of his
parents.

   Soviet space officials have ordered an
old-fashioned remedy for a cosmonaut who caught a cold: take lots
of vitamin C and stay indoors.
   That meant postponing a space walk Wednesday because Gennady
Strekalov, 49, one of two cosmonauts on the orbiting Soviet space
station Mir, caught a cold while working out on an on-board running
track, the official news agency Tass said.
   The space walk was rescheduled for Oct. 30.
   ``A cosmonaut is, naturally, not a robot or automaton. He
remains an ordinary human and, unfortunatey, is susceptible to
ailments lurking in his path even in orbit,'' said Valery Polyakov,
deputy director of the Health Ministry's Institute for
Medical-Biological Problems.
   Tass said Strekalov was taking ascorbic acid, or vitamin C.
Soviet physicians on Earth said no other medicine was necessary.
   Strekalov and Gennady Manakov were to take space walks to make
final repairs on a hatch that failed to close this summer.

<HEAD>Radical Priest of Poor to Run for President in Haiti</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Slum priest Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
who has survived at least three assassination attempts and whose
radical sermons led to his oster from the Salesian order, said
Thursday he will run for president.
   ``If the people say run, I must run,'' Aristide said over the
Catholic Radio Soleil.
   Aristide, 35, was nominated by the Democratic Convergence, a
progressive political action group of about 300 public figures that
has been seeking a unity candidate for weeks. Some grassroots
organizations and small, left-wing parties also endorsed him for
the Dec. 16 presidential election.
   His candidacy was unexpected. Reaction was not immediately
available from the government, the military and mainstream parties.
   The outspoken priest has many enemies among the elite in this
impoverished Caribbean island nation of 6 million.
   The last attempt on his life came in September 1988 as he was
saying Mass at St. Jean Bosco Church. Hooligans with machetes, guns
and spears burst into the church, killed 12 worshipers and wounded
at least 70.
   Today, Aristide seldom sleeps at home and never takes the same
routes.
   Jean-Claude Roy, president of the center-left Union of Haitian
Constitutionals, said Thursday, ``Aristide's influence is
essentially moral, not electoral. His candidacy will not win the
support of conservatives nor even of moderates, who are afraid of
violent confrontation.''
   There are about 20 other presidential hopefuls but only seven
have officially filed. The deadline is Sunday.
   Aristide runs a center for street children and is known as a
spokesman for the poor and downtrodden. He has said in the past he
was not interested in political power unless ``the people called
me.''
   Aristide was expelled from the conservative Salesian order in
December 1988 after his superiors in Rome accused him of fomenting
class warfare and being a ``protagonist of destabilization.''
   A proponent of liberation theology, which advocates church
involvement in the social struggles of the poor, Aristide preached
``active nonviolence'' and repeatedly denounced human rights abuses
by Haiti's military.
   ``Aristide is the one and only candidate on the political scene
who has wide appeal,'' said economist Paul Latourtue, a former
senatorial candidate.
   His candidacy will not be popular with supporters of the
Duvalier regime which ruled Haiti for 29 years, until the fall of
Jean-Claude Duvalier in 1986.
   Duvalierist leaders and militants founded the Union for National
Reconciliation last Sunday and chose Roger Lafontant for president.

because of a possible transmission problem.
   The company said it was possible that a cable to the cars'
floor-mounted shift levers could disconnect, freezing the
transmission in the last gear selected.
   Cars affected by the recall include Buick Riviera and Reatta,
Oldsmobile Toronado and Trofeo and Cadillac Eldorado and Seville

<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk,
meeting a key African National Congress demand, on Thursday lifted
the 4-year-old state of emergency in violence-plagued Natal
Province.
   The ANC and other anti-apartheid groups welcomed the move, which
de Klerk said removed all obstacles to negotiating power-sharing
between the dominant white minority and the black majority.
   ``There is only one route to peace and reconciliation - that is
through peaceful negotiation,'' the president said in Pretoria.
``The door to this is now fully open and I am appealing to all
leaders and all South Africans to accept the challenge.''
   The act officially ended a nationwide state of emergency
declared in June 1986, when unrest spread throughout the country.
   In June, de Klerk lifted the emergency restrictions in the rest
of the country but kept them in Natal, where a power struggle
between the ANC and the conservative Inkatha movement has claimed
5,000 lives since 1986.
   Ending the state of emergency was an ANC condition for
full-scale negotiations with the white-led government on ending
apartheid and giving blacks a voice in national affairs.
   The United States and other nations that have imposed economic
sanctions on South Africa to protest apartheid also have called for
the emergency measures to be withdrawn.
   The ANC praised the move Thursday but urged de Klerk to release
all political prisoners and repeal all security legislation.
   Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi called the decision ``a step
which should bring South Africa nearer to the negotiating table.''
   A spokesman for the white anti-apartheid Democratic Party said
ending the state of emergency forced ANC and Inkatha leaders to
halt violence.
   Delegations from the two black opposition groups have been
meeting in Natal to try to stop the fighting. But Buthelezi and ANC
leader Nelson Mandela have refused to meet in what has become a
political faceoff over control of the black opposition.
   De Klerk said the violence, though still sporadic, had receded
and that order could be maintained through normal police powers.
   The state of emergency gave police and soldiers wide-ranging
powers, including detention without trial and the authority to
break up political rallies and meetings. Under security laws,
police retain the right to impose stringent restrictions in what
they deem emergency situations.
   More than 30,000 activists, almost all of them black, were
detained for varying lengths of time during the four years of the
nationwide state of emergency.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok told the news conference the
number of police and soldiers in Natal would not change.
   Police still have limited special powers in black townships
around Johannesburg that have been declared ``unrest areas.'' About
800 blacks have died in factional fighting around Johannesburg in
the last two months.
   De Klerk has now addressed all of the ANC's demands, including
the release of political prisoners and the return of some 20,000
exiles.
   But exiles have yet to begin returning in large numbers and only
a few dozen of the more than 1,500 political prisoners claimed by
the ANC have been released.
   De Klerk reiterated that all political parties, including
right-wing conservative and militant black groups, are welcome at
constitutional negotiations he hopes to launch early next year.
   Only the ANC, Inkatha and the Democratic Party have expressed a
desire to attend.
   De Klerk also said he wants to eliminate apartheid and give all
South Africans a ``vote of equal value.''
   The ANC, which for years has demanded nationalizing big
business, is now asking corporations for financial help, Business
Day newspaper reported Thursday.
   It said Mandela and other ANC leaders approached at least two
major corporations in South Africa and were expected to approach a
third soon.
   No financial commitments were made, it said, quoting
unidentified business sources.
   An ANC statement acknowledged contacts between ANC leaders and
businessmen, but said only that the ANC was developing a
fundraising strategy which would likely target business
organizations.

<TEXT>
   The Hell's Angels motorcycle club was largely
put out of the illicit business of methamphetamines trafficking
with the arrests of 15 people in the Omaha area and another in
California, an FBI agent says.
   ``We have made a significant impact on their ability to conduct
illegal activity in this area,'' said Dennis Aiken, assistant
special agent for the FBI in Omaha.
   Surrounded by confiscated rifles, a .22-caliber automatic
pistol, $800,000 worth of drugs, $200,000 in cash as well as Hells
Angel's jackets and posters, Aiken said a two-year investigation
culminated in simultaneous raids Wednesday on 14 locations,
including the club's headquarters in Omaha.
   A Rottweiler guard dog was killed after it attacked an officer
at the clubhouse. One man at the clubhouse resisted arrest, but the
other searches and arrests were conducted without incident, Aiken
said.
   ``We consider this group to be a major center in the trafficking
of methamphetamines,'' Aiken said at a news conference. Hell's
Angels clubs have played a major role in methamphetamine traffic in
the United States, he said.
   Many of the fewer than 50 club members in the Omaha area are now
in jail, Aiken said. Everyone arrested in the Omaha area Wednesday
was a Hell's Angel club member or a club associate, Aiken said.
   The investigation continued and it wasn't known how much
contraband and money would eventually be confiscated, Aiken said.
   Charges included interstate and foreign travel in support of
racketeering enterprises, money laundering, manufacturing and
distribution of a controlled substance and felony possession of a
firearm, an FBI press release said.
   Eleven of the 16 people arrested Wednesday in or near Omaha and
in Long Beach, Calif., had been named in a federal grand jury
indictment issued Monday, Aiken said. The five others were arrested
on charges of drug possession based on evidence obtained during the
raids, he said.
   Larry Holmquist, an FBI spokesman, would not comment on the
connection between the arrest in California and the others here.
   Douglas County Sheriff Dick Roth said the suspects had been
investigated as far back as 1978.
   ``We have had tons of intelligence on these people's actions
over the years,'' Roth said.
   A cooperative effort that included the FBI, Nebraska State
Patrol and the federal Drug Enforcement Administration used
electronic surveillance such as wire intercepts, Aiken said. He
refused to say whether undercover agents played a role.
   Homes and businesses were searched in Omaha, in Valley to the
west and in Council Bluffs, across the Missouri River in Iowa, the
FBI said.

<TEXT>
   The state on Thursday shut down one of the
largest sludge and oil transport companies in New York Harbor,
citing a pattern of abuse of environmental laws.
   Thomas C. Jorling, state commissioner of the Department of
Environmental Conservation, said the order was the first against an
entire fleet of barges since the department was created in 1970.
   The order comes after one of the barges, operating illegally,
sank Sept. 27 at the First Marine Shipyard on Staten Island,
spilling 50,000 gallons of oil into the Kill Van Kull between the
island and New Jersey.
   That was the latest in a series of unrelated spills that have
dumped more than 1 million gallons of petroleum products into the
harbor during the past year.
   ``Here we are going further because ... we have concluded that
this corporation cannot operate safely,'' Jorling said Thursday.
   The barges cited in the civil order belong to the family of
former city Ports and Terminals Commissioner Susan Frank.
   The order names three of about 45 family-owned businesses:
Berman Enterprises Inc. of Manhattan and General Marine Transport
Corp. and Standard Marine Services Inc., both of Bayonne, N.J.
   The companies control at least 19 barges, or 10 percent of all
commercial barges operating in the harbor, Jorling said. They are
also being investigated for possible criminal violations, he said.
   Also named in the civil order were Ms. Frank's mother,
72-year-old Evelyn Berman Frank, who heads General Marine; Peter
Frank, president of General Marine and Susan Frank's brother; and
Jane Frank Kresch, secretary of Berman Enterprises and Susan
Frank's sister.
   Phone messages left at their offices and at First Marine
Shipyard by The Associated Press were not returned Thursday.
   The order gives the companies seven days to dock the barges at
First Marine Shipyard. A hearing was scheduled for Oct. 30 to
decide whether the operating licenses should be revoked
permanently.
   The companies hold contracts to dispose of sewage sludge fr
Westchester County and several New Jersey cities, Jorling said,
adding that the state was looking for alternative disposal
companies.
   There should be no interruption in oil supplies, he said.
   Besides the spill last month, the state order blamed the
companies for nine known oil spills, three groundings and two
collisions since 1983. They have also received 21 Coast Guard
citations in other cases since then.
   Fires and explosions involving the barges have killed two people
and injured several others, it said.
   Eight of the 19 barges lack inspection certificates, five failed
to complete required midterm inspections and five lack DEC
licenses, the order said.
   Evelyn Frank and General Marine recently pleaded guilty in New
Jersey Superior Court in a toxic-sludge dumping case and was fined
$1 million.
   According to the criminal indictment, she ordered employees to
dump toxic substances in the waters off Brooklyn and Newark, N.J.

   An alleged drug smuggler surrendered
Thursday, becoming the first to accept the government's promise not
to extradite traffickers to the United States who turn themselves
in, a radio report said.
   Jesus Rincon, 24, took President Cesar Gaviria up on his offer
last month not to extradite smugglers who surrender and to reduce
their jail sentences by up to half, Radio Caracol reported.
   Neither police nor judicial offices were answering the phone
late Thursday to confirm the report.
   Caracol said Rincon, who is sought in the States for drug
crimes, turned himself in to a judge and was jailed in Pereira, a
coffee-growing region of southwestern Colombia and hometown of
President Gaviria.
   To be eligible for Gaviria's offer, surrendering drug
traffickers must confess their crimes and cooperate with police.
Rincon is the first to accept the offer.
   The notorious Medelli  cocaine cartel has rejected Gaviria's
offer. It kidnapped seven journalists and the sister of an
ambassador to pressure the government to grant pardons instead.

   Nana grew from storm to a hurricane Thursday,
heading north toward Bermuda, forecasters said Thursday.
   A hurricane watch was posted for Bermuda as the season's eighth
hurricane generated top sustained winds of 75 mph, just 1 mph above
the threshold for hurricanes, National Hurricane Center forecasters
said.
   The storm was headed northwest at near 15 mph and a turn to the
north or possibly northeast was expected during the next 24 hours,
the center's advisory said.
   ``It probably will remain a minimal hurricane,'' said
meteorologist Joel Cline. However, forecasters said Nana could
strengthen during the next 24 hours.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the center of Nana was located near 27.5
north latitude, 66.4 west longitude, or about 335 miles south of
Bermuda.
   Formed Tuesday as a tropical depression northeast of Puerto
Rico, Nana became the season's 14th named storm.
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30.

39-count federal indictment, U.S. Attorney Dan Bent said.
   The Rivillas caused eight Honolulu financial institutions to
fail to file required currency transaction reports with the
Internal Revenue Service or to file reports that did not identify
Marcos and others, the indictment said.
   The alleged transactions occurred between June 1987 and
September 1988, it said.
   If convicted, Helen Rivilla faces a maximum penalty of 390 years
in prison and a fine of $19.5 million. Her husband faces a maximum
80-year prison term and a $4 million fine.
   Marcos died in exile in Honolulu last year, nearly four years
after being ousted by a popular revolt in the Philippines.
   His widow, Imelda, was acquitted in July of federal fraud
charges in New York. She was charged with looting more than $200
million from the Philippine treasury.

<HEAD>Romania to Lift Most Price and Wage Controls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN PETREANU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Petre Roman on Thursday
announced the lifting of most price and wage controls in
conjunction with a devaluation of the currency.
   The new measures, which take effect Nov. 1, are ``a leap toward
a market economy,'' but could cause inflation and unemployment,
Roman said in a speech to both houses of Parliament.
   However, he said, ``This is the price we must pay to fill
stores, combat speculation and correct the economy.''
   Subsidies are to be maintained for the moment on energy, rent
and some food items. It was not clear how much the uncontrolled
prices actually would increase on Nov. 1.
   Items supplied by less than three producers will remain
price-controlled because of insufficent competition to regulate
prices on a market basis.
   Under the centralized economy inherited from the Communists,
prices and salaries were set without connection to their real
market value.
   Since the December revolution that ousted the Communist regime
of Nicolae Ceausescu, both productivity and production have fallen
by more than 20 percent. Wages, however, have increased 11 percent.
   At present, 50,000 of the country's workforce of 12 million
people are registered as unemployed. But Roman warned that ``hidden
unemployment'' is much higher.
   He estimated that to avoid massive unemployment about 700,000
``inefficient'' workers and another 300,000 of next year's
graduates would have to be retrained.
   According to the government's plan, Romanians should be
partially compensated for expected price increases through a
complex system of indexing.
   Roman said wages are to be ``liberalized'' according to market
principles, ``with the highest wage-earners being those who produce
the most profit.''
   He said he hoped this would stimulate production enough to
counter-act inflationary pressures of the reform program.
   Roman said the Romanian leu would be devalued to 35 to the
dollar from its present, artificially low rate of 20. The move is
an effort to halt the spiralling trade deficit and hasten
convertibility.

   The capture of prison escapee Lawrencia
``Bambi'' Bembenek and her fiances rekindled public interest
Thursday in the one-time police officer and former model who was
convicted of murder.
   ``Minutes, just 10 more minutes and we could have gotten away,''
she said in a jail interview with the television show ``Inside
Edition.''
   Listeners jammed the switchboards of Milwaukee radio call-in
shows eager to debate Ms. Bembenek's conviction nearly a decade ago
for killing her former husband's ex-wife.
   ``As pretty as she is, people don't want to believe she did what
she did,'' said Elfred Schultz, a former Milwaukee police detective
who was briefly married to Ms. Bembenek.
   In her native Milwaukee, residents have long debated Ms.
Bembenek's involvement in the 1981 killing of Christine Schultz,
who was bound, gagged and shot.
   Ms. Bembenek was a university security guard at the time of the
killing. Before that, she worked briefly as a Milwaukee police
officer, a model and a waitress in a Playboy club.
   Royal Canadian Mounted police arrested Ms. Bembenek on Wednesday
in the tourist city of Thunder Bay, Ontario. She fled there with
her fiance after escaping from a Wisconsin prison three months ago.
   Ms. Bembenek was serving a life sentence for killing Mrs.
Schultz, former wife of Elfred Schultz. Authorities allege Ms.
Bembenek, 32, killed the first Mrs. Schultz because she was
receiving $700-a-month alimony payments from Elfred Schultz.
   Ms. Bembenek continued to maintain her innocence after her
sentencing. She was divorced from Schultz shortly after her
conviction.
   Her appeals for a new trial have been rejected three times by
state appeals courts and twice by the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
   Ms. Bembenek escaped July 15 from the Taycheedah Correctional
Institute near Fond du Lac in northeastern Wisconsin and fled to
Canada with Dominick Gugliatto, a suburban Milwaukee factory worker
who courted her in prison.
   ``Dominick and I love each other,'' she said during the
interview from a Thunder Bay jail. ``One of my biggest regrets is
that we were never able to get legally married.''
   The escape thrilled Ms. Bembenek's Milwaukee fans.
   Entrepreneurs sold T-shirts that read ``Run Bambi Run.'' A
private investigator offered to research new evidence that would
help reverse the conviction.
   Several tabloid TV shows also reported on the escape, playing up
Ms. Bembenek's looks and the romantic elements of the prison break.
   Ms. Bembenek and Gugliatto were arrested after authorities were
contacted by someone who recognized the pair in a Thunder Bay
restaurant from the Oct. 12 episode of ``America's Most Wanted.''
   The two were held in the Thunder Bay district jail pending an
immigration hearing next week.
   Those who met the couple during their brief stay in Thunder Bay
were shocked by their arrests.
   Ms. Bembenek worked as a $5-an-hour waitress and Gugliatto was
short-order cook. They shared a small basement apartment and went
by the names Jennifer Lee and Tony Gazzana.
   ``I found her a lovely woman. She was very kind, warm and
outgoing,'' said Jenny Beck, their landlady. ``I can't believe
it.''
   Louis Kebezes, owner of the Columbia Grill &amp; Tavern where Ms.
Bembenek worked, called her ``a beautiful lady, a excellent
waitress.''
   ``I have policemen come here,'' said Kebezes. ``She serves them
and she was terrific. Nobody expected her to have a thing on her
record.''

   ``Once on This Island'' has blossomed on
Broadway.
   The charming Caribbean musical that was a hit last spring at
off-Broadway's Playwrights Horizons has danced into the Booth
Theater with its sweet simplicity and heart-tugging emotions
intact.
   Moving small off-Broadway shows to a much bigger Broadway
theater is risky business. For every ``Chorus Line'' or ``Ain't
Misbehavin' ,'' there's a ``Chu Chem'' or ``The Human Comedy.''
   But Graciela Daniele has directed and choreographed ``Once on
This Island'' with such a sure sense of style and unity that the
leap to a larger space works. The 90-minute show, a seamless blend
of narrative, song and dance, expands to fill the theater.
   The story spun by ``Once on This Island'' is a slight one. It
unfolds as a fable told to a little girl on a storm-wracked island
in the French Antilles. The storytellers, virtually the entire cast
of 11 performers, become the characters in the tale.
   The musical celebrates the love of a dark-skinned peasant girl,
Ti Moune, for Daniel, the mulatto son of a wealthy landowner. She
saves him from an auto accident and nurses him back to life and
love.
   Their relationship is helped and hindered by the gods - a
quartet of deities who represent earth, water, love and death.
Daniel eventually must marry a woman of his own class. The two have
been promised to each other since childhood.
   But the ending is far from downbeat. In fact, it's cathartic and
exhilarating.
   Part of the exhilaration comes from a radiant young actress with
an exotic name - La Chanze - who plays Ti Moune. She sings and
dances with a freshness that is captivating. She gets fine support
from the rest of the cast, particularly Jerry Dixon as the young
man and Kecia Lewis-Evan as the most boisterous of earth mothers.
   On a second hearing, the score remains as melodic as ever.
Stephen Flaherty's atmospheric music is rich in Caribbean rhythms
wedded to more traditional musical theater songs. Lynn Ahrens - who
did the artful adaptation from a novel by Trinidadian writer Rosa
Guy - has carefully matched Flaherty's music with simple but not
simplistic lyrics.
   Designer Loy Arcenas has created a deceptively primitive
background that immediately places the audience in a storybook
frame of mind. He has come up with a bright blue background with a
few painted palm trees, a style that suggests a tropical Chagall
crossed with Matisse. It looks like a giant children's pop-up book
come to life.
   But in the end, it is the show's emotional content that is its
most appealing aspect. We root for the girl and her attempt to find
happiness. But then, that's not too hard when we have such a
sparkling heroine who lifts our spirits and the musical as well.

   The army early today drove off leftist
guerrillas who attacked air force headquarters with homemade
mortars and automatic weapons, and authorities said several people
were wounded.
   A military spokesman said he had an initial report that one
military mechanic was wounded and one aircraft was damaged in the
three hours of fighting at Ilopango air base on the east side of
the capital.
   The fighting began at 9:45 p.m. Wednesday and died down after
midnight, but helicopters continued patrolling the city early
today.
   A Red Cross spokesman said several people were wounded but did
not immediately know the number.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate is considering raising taxes on the
rich and moderating a Medicare premium increase after refusing to
strip a higher gasoline levy from its deficit-reduction bill.
   The measure, which would raise taxes and reduce benefit programs
by $250 billion over the next five years, is on a fast track that
congressional leaders hope could place it on President Bush's desk
for his signatue Friday night.
   Without final action, or at least considerable progress on such
a package, Bush has said he will shut down the government Saturday
morning, when federal
   spending authority is due to expire.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate documents show Sens. Alan Cranston,
Donald W. Riegle Jr. and Dennis DeConcini had more extensive
dealings with the owner of the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan than
previously acknowledged.
   In one of the documents, Cranston thanks ex-Lincoln head Charles
H. Keating Jr. for a $250,000 contribution to a pet political
cause. In the same memo, the senator expresses pleasure that
Keating's meeting with the chief thrift regulator ``had gone so
well.''
   The Senate Ethics Committee documents, obtained by The
Associated Press, are expected to play a major role in the panel's
deliberations, beginning today, on whether to intensify the
investigation of the three senators - part of the so-called
``Keating five.''
   Committee Counsel Robert S. Bennett has recommended advancing
the investigation against Cranston, D-Calif., Riegle, D-Mich., and
DeConcini, D-Ariz., while dropping the investigation of Sens. John
McCain, R-Ariz. and John Glenn, D-Ohio. A committee decision was
not expected today.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. officials are gaining important espionage
information from newly available files of the disbanded East German
secret police, CIA Director William Webster says.
   West German officials have shared with the United States
information from voluminous files seized when the communist
government of East Germany was toppled by popular discontent last
fall, he said.
   ``We have pursued a number of important leads,'' the CIA
director said in an interview with The Associated Press on
Wednesday. ``That's not to say we've identified spies, but we've
learned more about some notorious cases,'' he said, declining to
elaborate.
   East Germany's notorious Stasi secret police had about 80,000
agents keeping tabs on its 11 million citizens, Webster said. The
files have yielded a bonanza of secrets and identified some highly
placed West German officials as East German spies, he said.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A day of somber remembrance gave way to a
night of celebration as survivors of the San Francisco Bay quake
marked its anniversary at a restaurant that stayed open a year ago
for those needing a good stiff one.
   ``To some people, it's like surviving the Titanic. They were
panicky a year ago, but now they're just happy,'' Alexander
Mortacavi, owner of L'Entrecote de Paris, said Wednesday night on
the anniversary of the Oct. 17, 1989 earthquake.
   Earlier Wednesday, people throughout the Bay area fell silent or
wept at 5:04 p.m., the moment the quake hit. Church bells tolled
and mourners in Oakland heaped white carnations near where the
Cypress Freeway collapsed and killed 42 people.
   The quake, which measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, killed 67
people throughout the Bay area and caused $7 billion in damage.

   FOND DU LAC, Wis. (AP) - The ``tabloid TV'' notoriety of a
former Playboy waitress and policewoman convicted of murdering her
husband's ex-wife helped lead to her capture three months after she
escaped from prison.
   Lawrencia ``Bambi'' Bembenek, 31, was arrested at an apartment
in Thunder Bay, Ontario, on Wednesday on a tip from a viewer of
last week's episode of ``America's Most Wanted.''
   Ms. Bembenek, who has steadfastly professed her innocence, was
captured with her fiance, Dominic Gugliatto, 34.
   Her flight had thrilled supporters in Milwaukee - prompting
sales of T-shirts that read, ``Run, Bambi, Run'' - and was covered
on several ``tabloid TV'' shows, whihh played up her looks and the
romantic elements of the escape.

<TEXT>
   Dramatic events elsewhere are drying
up the money pool for Afghan guerrillas, and one group has started
mining gems to finance the 12-year-old war.
   The snow-covered mountains and rocky valleys of the Hindu Kush
have been known for centuries as a rich source of emeralds and
rubies, aquamarines and lapis, but mining has been primitive and
irregular.
   Guerrilla chief Ahmed Shah Masood decided to exploit the mineral
wealth of the Panjshir Valley, the largest area controlled by a
single commander, to replace dwindling outside aid and pay the
bills of his Islamic army.
   For help, he turned to Gary Bowersox, a gemologist based in
Honolulu.
   Bowersox is making a survey of the valley's deposits, using a
Soviet study made in 1977, the year before a coup installed a
Communist government and the Moslem uprising began.
   He said preliminary findings point to a potential in billions of
dollars.
   ``We're seeing crystals of a size and quality that equals or
surpasses material from anywhere in the world,'' he said in an
interview during a month-long visit to the Panjshir. ``What we've
found justifies a closer look.''
   According to Bowerox, the valley could rival Brazil, Zambia and
Colombia, the world's leading producers, as a source of emeralds.
   The richest known emerald deposits are in the Colombian jungles,
but gangs of drug traffickers and bandits have interfered with the
supply.
   Even in the mid-1980s, during the fiercest fighting between
guerrillas and the Soviet-backed Afghan army, precious stones
trickled out of Afghanistan to northern Pakistan and on to other
markets.
   Bowersox said he would like to bring in sophisticated drilling
and sorting equipment to speed the mining process and save more of
the gems.
   ``A lot of the Afghan miners are using explosives taken from
bombs and shells to blast them up,'' he said. ``In the process,
they're destroying a lot of valuable gemstones.''
   During the nine-year Soviet military involvement in Afghanistan,
the United States provided an estimated $300 million of military
aid to the guerrillas. Since the Red Army withdrew in February
1989, Washington been trying to extricate itself from what has
become a political and military stalemate.
   Many oil-rich Arab states that supported the Moslem guerrillas
now are preoccupied with the Persian Gulf crisis that began Aug. 2,
when Iraq occupied Kuwait.
   Guerrilla commanders say their flow of arms, ammunition and
money has nearly stopped.
   Gem mining in the Panjshir is not done by Masood's guerrillas,
but by prospectors who pay digging fees. Masood also either
collects a 10 percent tax on gemstones or buys them to sell on the
world market.
   Masood, whose success against the Soviet army made him a folk
hero, said he hoped the gems eventually would finance his military
operation. He would not be specific about profits, but said:
``We're well ahead of our expectations.''
   Residents say the Panjshir Valley has been relatively free of
attacks by government forces since the Soviets left. Admirers
attribute that to Masood's military prowess, but critics claim he
made a secret deal with President Najibullah.
   Taloqan, capital of Takhar province, has a population of about
50,000 and is the largest city outside government control. It is
administered by an advisory council that collects taxes to run a
police force, schools, clinics and a movie theater.
   ``If Masood can continue to supply the level of security he has
so far, this place is a lot safer than Colombia,'' Bowersox said.

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maria Venus Rozario has faced hunger and
Japanese invaders during 100 years in Hong Kong. After her husband
died when she was 33, she hacked a living for their eight children
from this jungle of free enterprise.
   Now Mrs. Rozario is leaving, lonely for the children already
gone and fearful of China's Communist government, which takes over
the British colony in 1997.
   When she steps onto the plane for Vancouver, Canada, the frail
but spry great-grandmother will become the oldest emigrant in a
mass exodus from Hong Kong.
   The government says 62,000 of Hong Kong's 5.7 million people
will leave this year, but other estimates put the number closer to
80,000. Most emigrants are professionals in their 30s and 40s, but
growing numbers of old people are joining them.
   Hong Kong's elderly, left behind by their emigrating children,
often have the bitter choice of dying alone or leaving home.
   ``It's not too much to ask to be with one's family, is it?''
Mrs. Rozario said, fingering a tattered family photograph. ``But I
will also miss Hong Kong. My whole life is here with all my
memories.''
   Mrs. Rozario, who plans to leave in November, has a daughter in
British Columbia and a son in San F section.
   Downstairs are the Steamy Steam Baths and the Chinese Happy
Tattoo House. Upstairs, in Mrs. Rozario's apartment, are fresh cut
flowers and a small collection of butterflies.
   Maria Venus Gomes da Silva was born into a family of sailors
from the Portuguese colony of Macao, 45 miles south of Hong Kong on
the southern Chinese coast.
   Her father moved to Hong Kong, where he married and started a
family. Maria went to work at 14, teaching English grammar to the
daughters of British soldiers stationed in the territory.
   She left the school in 1913 to marry a Portuguese businessman,
and her first child was born in 1915.
   His death of a heart attack in 1923 left Mrs. Rozario alone with
eight children. She never remarried and supported the children by
working two jobs at once, sometimes three, as secretary, clerk and
accountant.
   ``You don't know how hard hunger is to take, especially when
it's your children who are hungry,'' she said.
   Then came Japan's brutal occupation during World War II.
   One day, Japanese troops lined up a group of young men on a
boulevard by Hong Kong's harbor. A Japanese policeman moved along
the rank, chopping off their heads with a sword.
   One of Mrs. Rozario's sons, Marcos, was last in line. He had
been arrested for resisting the occupation.
   ``I ran through the crowd and pleaded with the man to save my
boy,'' she said. ``He gave in.''
   At the end of the war, Mrs. Rozario collected Marcos from jail.
He was tortured and broken by the Japanese and still lives with his
mother, unable to work.
   Mrs. Rozario said she hopes to take Marcos to Canada, ``but if
we cannot get the visa, then he will stay here. This is what has
become of my family.''
   After the war, her other children left Hong Kong one by one,
attracted by better job prospects or propelled by fear of the
Communists in China.
   ``The family all wanted to stay,'' she said, ``but it was the
insecurity about Hong Kong that made them leave. How can we live in
peace here with the Chinese ready to grab us back?''
   Soon after China's bloody crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement in Beijing last year, Mrs. Rozario also decided to go.
   ``Just like in the Bible, it's really an exodus,'' she said.
``I'm just a little drop of water in all this.''

<HEAD>An Experiment in Independence: Bringing Battered Women Home</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note date in 4th graf</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LISA LEVITT RYCKMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cindy's husband roused their sleeping
12-year-old son at midnight. ``You're the first one that's going to
die,'' he said.
   That night, Cindy and her three kids left the beatings, the
threats, the daily violence of her crazy-jealous husband forever.
After 16 years of marriage, of control so complete she lost
herself, Cindy found the courage to face freedom.
   ``I thank God I'm free,'' said Cindy, who didn't want her real
name used for fear her husband will find her. ``I'm home, with my
kids.''
   The two-bedroom apartment they share is an experiment in
independence for battered women, believed to be the first of its
kind in the nation: permanent homes with social services
downstairs. Thursday marks the official opening. Six women and
their children have moved in, and eight more are coming.
   There are at least 4 million Cindys each year in America,
according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.
Every 15 seconds, a woman is beaten. Every six hours, a woman is
murdered by her husband or boyfriend.
   Still, women stay with their abusers, because a violent home
often seems better than no home at all. And that is the choice.
   The sad truth is that battering causes homelessness. A Victim
Services Agency study showed that 35 percent of women living in
city homeless shelters were there to escape men who beat them.
   ``In order to protect yourself and care for yourself, you have
to let go of everything: friends, family, furniture, clothing,''
said social worker Olosunde Johnson, who is helping these women
face the future. ``Things that you love, that have emotional value
to you. And you have to walk out and leave that. And there's
something wrong with that.''
   Cindy left, and lived in a shelter for battered women, one of
1,700 serving 20,000 cities nationwide. The National Domestic
Violence Hotline receives 108,000 calls a year, about one-third of
which request shelter. But the need far outstrips the available
space.
   A Los Angeles County grand jury found last year that 90 percent
of the battered women and children who sought safety were turned
away. In Washington, D.C., eight out of every 10 women are told
there is no room. Advocates believe the situation is similar in New
York, Chicago and other big cities.
   ``And then, after 90 days, you have to be uprooted again. This
is victimization after victimization,'' Johnson said. ``It just
keeps eating away at the women and the children. `Who am I?' is a
question that comes up. `Who am I?'''
   The victimization stops at the glass doors on a residential
street in Brooklyn, the ones that lead to these 16 apartments.
Permanent homes, ones the women and their children leave of their
own free will and return to, feeling safe.
   ``This man used to tell me when to go to bed, when to take a
bath, when to get up, five minutes to go to the store, and after
five minutes, there would have been a beating or a fight,'' Cindy,
33, said. ``Now it's just me and the kids. Nobody to say, `No, you
can't go, or if you go, I'm going to hit you.' And it's
wonderful.''
   Advocates say this permanent housing, which cost $1.7 million
over 18 months to develop, is the logical conclusion in the
evolution of services for battered women. In the early '70s, people
would open their private homes for abused women and their kids.
Emergency shelters followed, where women could stay for up to three
months.
   It soon became clear that it took more than 90 days to reorder a
life. So transitional housing was born, which allowed stays of a
year or 18 months.
   Even that was not enough. The economy was changing; living costs
were soaring in big cities like New York, and the result was that
during the 1980s, battered women were increasingly returning to the
men who abused them simply because they couldn't afford not to.
   ``And the thing that was different was housing,'' said Lucy
Friedman, executive director of Victim Services Agency, the
independent, non-profit group that created the housing with the
Urban Coalition. ``It got down to going back to an abusive partner
or going to a welfare hotel.''
   Now these women are home for good. The social services, provided
by Johnson, will be here for 18 months. There is a support group
for the women and another for their children. Johnson works on
getting child care, enrolling the kids and the women in school,
helping them achieve their career goals.
   Johnson's desk is in the basement, but her heart is with the
women. She's been there, and that helps her maintain her faith that
these women will come as far as she has.
   ``It also helps me in identifying what's going on with them,
even when they're unable to identify it,'' she said. ``And it helps
me to love them, even when they're unlovable.''
   Sometimes Jennifer gets that way, comes downstairs acting like a
fool. Leaves the tidy, three-bedroom apartment she shares with her
two daughters and young son, and vents some of the anger and
depression that comes of growing up abused with 10 brothers and
sisters, then being abused for two years by a crack-addicted
husband, and being a crack addict herself.
   Jennifer bounced from shelter to shelter for more than a year,
her children in tow, fighting urges to smoke crack again, to drink
herself into oblivion, to kill herself and be done with it all. She
left her husband for her children's sake, but the injustice of
having to walk out that door still galls her.
   ``I left my own apartment. Not his. Mine! He is the one who had
my apartment when I was in the streets, including the nights he put
me in the streets,'' the 26-year-old said. ``Cold, freezing outside
with my children. Five or six in the morning.''
   She left once and returned once. She left again, almost returned
again but thought better of it. Not being involved with the
batterer is one of the criteria for renting one of these heavily
subsidized apartments. That, and being drug and alcohol-free, and
being motivated to move ahead with life. Being willing to learn how
to act independently without fear.
   Jennifer and Cindy are doing their best.
   ``When I finally felt safe, that I could sleep and walk the
street without somebody yelling or doing something, then I started
thinking, `I want a home for my children,'' Cindy said. ``I always
told them, `I'm going to get you a better home.'
   ``Thank God I did. Now we have everything.''

<HEAD>Chamber's Lesher: The Economy Is Under Siege</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Lesher knew that relations with the
White House were less than cordial when, he says, John Sununu
threatened to remove part of Lesher's anatomy with a chain saw.
   Sununu is chief of staff in President Bush's White House, while
Lesher is president and chief executive officer of the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, a strong supporter of free enterprise and economic
growth.
   The communications gap opened several months ago, when the
chamber expressed support for lower Social Security payments and
took a stand against piling mandated benefit obligations on the
back of industry.
   Now, although Lesher says the lines remain open, the rift is
wide, as it is between the White House and other organizations that
many people had assumed would be administration supporters. The
chamber opposed the budget package.
   Lesher's lists the reasons why:
   1. Raising taxes when the economy is in recession is dangerous.
Eighty percent of the original package was in higher taxes, only 20
percent in cuts.
   2. The notion of secret summit meetings for six months, followed
by demands for approval within days and without open hearings, is
wrong, especially since some of the agreements broke new ground.
   3. Among proposals agreed to by the budget summitteers was a
huge increase - to $50,000 from $10,000 - in fines for violations
of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. ``It was carefully
secluded in the package.''
   4. The assumptions that interest rates would decline, inflation
tail off and the economy grow in spite of anti-growth
recommendations were unsupported.
   After extensive talks with professional economists and with
members around the country, Lesher says, ``I feel very strongly we
are heading into a substantial recession, one made more so by the
so-called solution.''
   Popular forecasts generally refer to a mild recession, one
lasting for two straight quarters, each of about 1 percent negative
growth. Many forecasts assume that wise inventory management -
Americans have learned to keep supplies to a minimum - and strong
exports will prevent a more serious decline.
   Lesher doesn't believe it. He concedes that inventory management
is good, but points out that exports already are slowing.
   He speculates about a world recession. Latin America ``already
is in the tank,'' Asia is headed there and Europe is weakening, he
says. Domestically, the recession would last six straight quarters,
including all 1991.
   Vision and leadership in Congress would lessen the blow, he
says, but he laments that it isn't forthcoming. Asked for an
example, he refers to the nondebate on making the United States
energy independent.
   He suggests the country's policy should be one of encouraging
exploration and development of oil, in Alaska, offshore and
elswhere, that distribution pipelines be built, that nuclear
possibilities should be reinvestigated.
   ``These things alone might bring back the economy,'' he said,
while, of course, making the country less dependent on supplies
from abroad. But, he lamented, proponents too often become buried
in blind, emotional reactions.
   It has reached the point, he said, where ``people of common
sense have been shouted down by voices of emotionalism and
distortion.'' He suggested that opponents of oil drilling, posing
as environmentalists, prevent sensible debate on offshore
developments, to wit:
   ``We have drilled thousands of wells on the coasts, and we've
had one major oil spill.'' But, since further efforts often are
thwarted, the United States must transport oil by ship, incurring
vastly greater ecological risks.
   The economy is under siege, said Lesher. Not just from those
whom he feels politicize and emotionalize energy issues, but from
economic policy makers too.

<HEAD>Abortion Re-Emerging as Issue in Campaigns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After taking a back seat to worries about
taxes, the economy and the Middle East, abortion is re-emerging as
a potentially decisive issue in the final days of the 1990 election
season.
   ``It's one of the few issues that's still out there that
distinguishes people,'' said Harrison Hickman, a pollster for
abortion-rights causes. ``I would predict you'll see a lot of
people using it at the last minute to try to push undecided
voters.''
   Conventional political wisdom has held that abortion-rights
candidates had the upper hand this year and that opponents of
abortion were on the defensive after a 1989 Supreme Court ruling
revived the issue. Electoral losses for abortion foes in 1989
contributed to that view.
   Yet abortion hasn't proven to be the ``silver bullet'' for
abortion-rights candidates, in the words of Democrat Donald
Avenson, a pro-choice candidate for Iowa governor. And abortion
opponents point to races where their candidates have stood firm and
are leading - including governor's races in Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Texas and Iowa.
   ``It's not the issue some thought a year ago. On the other hand,
it's more salient this year than it has been in the past in a lot
of states,'' said Doug Johnson, legislative director for the
National Right to Life Committee.
   As a result, some thought abortion was fizzling this year as an
issue.
   But strategists for abortion-rights campaigns say there will be
a flurry of last-minute advertising pushing the abortion issue. In
some races it's already begun.
   Sometimes the push will be on television. But in other cases it
will be more selectively targeted toward young women voters through
direct-mail or telephone.
   ``People are thinking this is a dead issue. I think that's just
a fundamental misunderstanding of this issue,'' said Celinda Lake,
who has conducted polling for abortion-rights candidates around the
country.
   ``It's a last-minute issue,'' she said. ``It's something you lay
out in the last weeks of a campaign.''
   Abortion-rights strategists say their target audience, younger
voters, typically does not pay attention to campaigns until the
final stages.
   Lake says polling shows that increasing economic worries and
lack of trust of Democrats on the economy has caused a drop-off in
support for Democrats among younger women, she said. Abortion may
lure them back.
   ``It's a big drop off - 10 points,'' she said. ``Because of that
you'll see more pro-choice direct-mail geared toward that audience
at the end.''
   In North Carolina's Senate race, both anti-abortion Sen. Jesse
Helms and his Democratic challenger, Harvey Gantt, have been airing
ads on the issue.
   But in most states, it's the abortion-rights candidates who have
been using the issue in television ads.
   In Oregon, Democrat Harry Lonsdale has drawn even in his
challenge to GOP Sen. Mark Hatfield, according to recent polls,
after airing ads that attack Hatfield's opposition to abortion
among other issues.
   One race where abortion hasn't been the factor that was expected
is in Florida, where former Sen. Lawton Chiles is challenging GOP
Gov. Robert Martinez, who opposes abortion. Chiles, who supports
abortion rights, has found the issue uncomfortable for him and
isn't airing ads despite Martinez' seeming vulnerability on the
issue.
   The issue is important in Iowa's Senate race, where Democratic
incumbent Tom Harkin has a double-digit lead over anti-abortion
challenger Rep. Tom Tauke, according to recent polls.
   Harkin has been the abortion-rights point-man in the Senate, and
he led the fight last week to oppose an amendment requiring
teen-age girls to notify their parents before getting an abortion.
Parental consent on abortion tends to gain strong support in most
polls, but Harkin said the overall abortion issue helps him.
   ``The last thing my opponent wants to talk about is the choice
issue,'' Harkin said. ``I'm watching my tracking polls ... and the
number of people viewing his position as extreme is going like
this,'' he added, pointing upward.
   The Senate adopted the parental consent provision on a 48-48
vote, but the amendment was expected to be deleted in later
congressional action. Harkin's side was surprised it drew 48 votes.
   That vote has become an issue in California, where both
candidates for governor are trying to appeal to abortion-rights
supporters. Democratic candidate Dianne Feinstein blasted her GOP
rival, Sen. Pete Wilson, for missing the vote while campaigning.
   Abortion opponents have the upper hand in several races.
   In Kansas, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Joan Finney has
had difficulty explaining her anti-abortion position recently. But
she still leads GOP Gov. Mike Hayden, an abortion-rights supporter,
in the polls.
   Anti-abortion Republican George Voinovich has the lead in Ohio's
governor race, where Democrat Anthony Celebrezze has been
criticized for a startling flip-flop in which he dropped his
long-standing opposition to abortion.
   A September poll by the University of Cincinnati found that the
issue was helping Voinovich more than Celebrezze. Voinovich led
among the 13 percent of respondents who said abortion was the
single most important issue.
   In Iowa's governor's race, Democrat Avenson is running
abortion-rights ads but has yet to catch up with anti-abortion GOP
incumbent Terry Branstad.
   Abortion opponents in Idaho were angered by Gov. Cecil Andrus'
veto of a restrictive abortion bill this year, but he is in strong
shape in his re-election bid.
   It's become more of an issue in Idaho's Senate and House races,
however.
   Idaho Republican Senate candidate Larry Craig surprised his
anti-abortion supporters when he was asked in a debate what he
would do if his wife became pregnant as a result of rape.
   He responded that it was her decision, which seemed at odds with
his opposition to legal abortions. Democrat Ron Twilegar jumped on
the response, saying he wanted all women to have that choice but
Craig seemed to want it only for his wife. Craig says he was
misinterpreted and hasn't strayed from his opposition to abortion.
   Abortion also is an issue in about a dozen congressional races.
   In northern Virginia, for example, Democrat James Moran is
airing abortion-rights ads against GOP Rep. Stan Parris.
   Democrats see the issue helping Moran, the Alexandria mayor,
since the district was won by Gov. Doug Wilder in an important
abortion test last year.

<HEAD>Post-Communist Irony: New Mayor Is Son of Old Lord

<DATELINE>ZAMOSC, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the late 1940s, the Communist
authorities chased Jan Zamoyski from the highlands of southern
Poland, where his aristocratic family had ruled for nearly four
centuries.
   Forty-five years later, another Zamoyski is in charge of Zamosc
- invited back by townspeople who elected him mayor in the first
democratic vote in decades.
   It is one of the many ironies in post-Communist Poland, a nation
at once rushing forward and stepping backward.
   Jan Zamoyski's son, Marcin, walks the Renaissance cobblestones
of Zamosc, greeted by the slight bows of a respectful populace and
kissing hands in the genteel style of Old Poland.
   He is the first to say his name will get him only so far in
today's Polish Republic, however, and that much must be done to
repair ``respect for values, the main thing lost during those 45
years.''
   The Communists nationalized private land and factories. Like all
the vilified gentry, Jan Zamoyski lost everything and was barred
from living within 30 miles of his former estates.
   That law remains on the books, but Parliament is working out
ways to return confiscated property and businesses to former
owners. As Poland plunges toward capitalism, it is welcoming back
the exiled nobility and, in other ways, resurrecting the social
fabric of a prouder past.
   When given a chance to vote, the people of Zamosc turned to the
son of a man the Communists called one of the ``reactionary relics
of feudalism.''
   ``There is no doubt that my name decided it,'' Marcin Zamoyski
said. ``Maybe they imagined that I would do here as much as my
father used to.''
   Zamoyski, born in 1947, was working in Warsaw as a cameraman for
German television. He had little connection with Zamosc, and none
with his family's prewar world of prestige, wealth and public
responsibility.
   His father, nearing 80, turned down an invitation from Zamosc to
run in the parliamentary elections of June 1989. When Marcin was
asked to be a candidate for mayor, the son thought it was ``a nice
joke.''
   Marcin Zamoyski was persuaded to run by the ``great joy'' of the
people he met in Zamosc, a provincial capital three hours' drive
southeast of Warsaw.
   ``They thought I was the one who would assure them what they
imagined the authorities should be: good and just,'' he said.
   His father hugged and kissed him, the son said, ``and it was
only then that I understood how happy he was.''
   It was in 1571 that his father's namesake, the secretary to King
Zygmunt August, inherited ``three and a half villages,'' as the
history books say, and began planning his ideal city.
   That Jan Zamoyski, educated in Paris and Padua, brought the
vision of the Renaissance to Zamosc, building a university and
library in a city underpinned by a geometric street plan and a
sophisticated sewer system.
   Many ethnic groups settled in the city, each contributing its
skills and trades. Zamosc became self-sufficient, a city-state that
grew in prestige as its founder became Poland's chancellor and
military chief.
   The Zamoyski family remained among Poland's most powerful, and
the Zamosc properties were handed down through the generations.
   At the outbreak of World War II, Jan Zamoyski was the
``ordinat,'' or lord, controlling farmland and numerous industries
in the region.
   In 1939, the Soviet army invaded Poland from the east. In three
days, the soldiers carted off everything of value from the family
palace at Klemensow, outside Zamosc. The family mansion in Warsaw
was burned the same year.
   After the war, according to a recent magazine article, ``the
time of `social justice' came. The Zamoyski name could be written
only on graves.''
   Jan Zamoyski and his wife fled to Krakow, where he was arrested
by security forces as the Communists consolidated power.
   They moved to the Baltic Coast after his release. He was
arrested again because his background made him suspect, and
imprisoned from 1948 until 1956.
   The first return to Zamosc, in 1958, was painful for the elder
Zamoyski, who was berated in the newspapers and tailed by security
agents, but Marcin, then 11, remembers a warm reception by
townspeople.
   Zamoyski's father stopped returning to Zamosc and the son came
back rarely, ``mostly for funerals.''
   Marcin Zamoyski's family lives in Warsaw and he stays with a
friend in Zamosc, where housing is scarce. The Communists turned
the family palace into a psychiatric hospital.
   Zamosc, like most Polish cities, is nearly broke because huge
subsidies from the national treasury have ended. The once-admired
sewer system is collapsing and there is no money to restore the
fine architecture, which Zamoyski believes could be a valuable
tourist attraction.
   ``It is not so easy to incite people to work,'' he said, in a
voice tinged with frustration. ``I'm telling them they should start
this work within themselves. . . . They should treat this town as
something that is theirs.
   ``The people came up with the idea that I was the one,'' he
said. ``Now it is hard work and nothing else.''
   Residents of Zamosc appear charmed by their new mayor.
   ``Maybe I am romantic - I like history - but he is from a very
good family that contributed a lot to Poland,'' said Marek
Rzezniak, an artist.
   Rzezniak said the family name ``is money in the bank for him. .
. . The future will tell whether he fulfills the requirements.''

<HEAD>Mexico Cracks Down on Central Americans Trying To Flee North</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is getting tougher on
Central Americans who migrate through its territory in hopes of
trading poverty, war and repression at home for jobs in the United
States.
   U.S. officials welcome the new policy in Mexico, which is
forging closer economic ties with its powerful northern neighbor,
but some Mexicans fear their government will turn next on its own
citizens who sneak across the border.
   Smugglers and thieves prey on the Central Americans, most of
whom are from El Salvador and Guatemala. Crooked immigration
officials take their money and honest ones deport them, but still
they come by the thousands.
   ``They know there is a risk. But it's nothing compared to the
risks they run in their own countries,'' said Jose Luis Perez
Canchola of the Center for Migrant Investigations and Studies in
Tijuana.
   The number of Central Americans deported from Mexico has
increased from 14,000 in 1988 to 80,000 in the first six months of
1990, which makes the long, dangerous trip north even more
difficult.
   ``Mexico is not the easy springboard it once was into the United
States,'' said Duke Austin of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service in Washington.
   Between 300,000 and 400,000 Central Americans are estimated to
be in Mexico at any one time, often working at menial jobs for
money to complete the journey.
   For many, the departure point is Tecun Uman, Guatemala, just
across the border from Tapachula in Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost
state.
   In the town square of Tecun Uman, the migrants meet the
``coyotes'' (coyotes) who smuggle human beings. It is a place to
change your money, your identity, maybe your luck.
   Sabino Gonzalez is a part-time preacher and full-time money
changer who haunts the square, calculator in one hand and a fistful
of cash in the other. He also is a go-between for the smugglers and
their customers.
   ``This guy is good, one of the best,'' he said, introducing a
coyote who gave his name as Jose Manuel Sanchez.
   Sanchez named his price: $1,000 from Tecun Uman to Tijuana, a
journey of nearly 2,000 miles from the Suchiate River on Mexico's
southern border and the Rio Grande on the north.
   ``You won't even get your feet wet,'' Sanchez assured a
prospective client. The price includes bribes, hotels used by the
coyote network and transportation by raft, taxi, bus, train and
private car, he said.
   At dawn, on the river bank, the journey began.
   Why not cross at night? the client asked.
   ``Thieves,'' Sanchez replied. ``They will rob you, and maybe
worse.''
   Some people attribute the increase in the number of Central
Americans apprehended to attempts by the 2-year-old administration
of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to clean up a corrupt
immigration service.
   Sergio Melendez, director of a 220-bed Roman Catholic Church
shelter in Tijuana, is not among them.
   ``Those without money are the ones who are deported,'' he said.
``There is still corruption. We think about two out of five make it
across.''
   At the northern end of the pipeline, two Salvadoran and three
Guatemalan women shared a cramped cell in the Tijuana city jail.
   They made it across both rivers, only to be caught by the U.S.
Border Patrol near San Ysidro, Calif.
   Because they claimed to be Mexicans, they were deported to
Tijuana, where unscrupulous Mexican immigration officers put them
in touch with a coyote. Each paid $800 to cross again, but were
caught and deported a second time.
   They have been in jail since Aug. 8, held as witnesses against
the coyote and as illegal immigrants. They have no idea when the
case will be heard.
   Judith Martinez Salmeron, 39, left three children with their
grandmother in El Salvador to seek work in the United States. The
journey cost everything the family could scrape together.
   ``I can't work,'' she said through the grating that separated
her from a visitor. ``I am worried about my children.''
   She looked down at her hands. ``I don't know what is going to
happen to us.''
   Mexico's 560-mile southern border with Guatemala is even more
hostile to Central Americans than its northern frontier. The
regional head of immigration in Tapachula, Baltazar Mejia, said
50,000 illegal immigrants had been deported from the area in nine
months.
   ``It's a whole lot easier to hold the line'' there, and the
south ``is out of the limelight,'' Bill Freylick of the U.S.
Committee for Refugees in Washington said during a recent trip to
Mexico and Central America.
   The crackdown has had a chilling effect on those who give
sanctuary to the Central Americans.
   A church hostel in Tapachula, the only shelter in the south,
closed recently. The director, Miguel Dominguez, said he feared a
new law providing prison terms of two to 10 years for those who
help illegal migrants.
   U.S. immigration agents have increased their intelligence
activities in the south. ``Virtually all the information they are
gathering, they are sharing with their Mexican counterparts,'' said
a U.S. official familiar with immigration matters.
   Closer cooperation between U.S. and Mexican officials, which
began last year, was an early sign that Mexico's tolerant attitude
toward Central American migrants had changed.
   ``This is part of the price the United States is demanding for a
free-trade agreement,'' said Monsignor Samuel Ruiz, the Catholic
bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas.
   Freylick agreed: ``The U.S. pressure doesn't even have to be
explicit. If Mexico wants a free-trade agreement, it has to seem
simpatico.''
   U.S. officials deny pressuring President Salinas to stem the
flow of Central Americans.
   ``There is no substance to that at all,'' one said. ``Salinas
has ordered this for the good of his own country.''
   Immigration issues, particularly the flow of Central Americans,
have been high on the two nations' agenda and they have established
a high-level working group.
   ``We are asking Mexico to pay attention to the problem, but it
is not a high-pressure situation,'' said the U.S. official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Mexico did not stop its own people from crossing the border
until recently. Last year, Mexican police and U.S. Border Patrol
agents carried out a joint operation at Tijuana-San Ysidro in which
500 people were arrested, most of them Mexicans.
   The Mexican government responded to the outcry by saying the
objective was to protect the migrants from drug dealers and
thieves.

<HEAD>Western Artists' Organization Celebrates Silver Anniversary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MEL REISNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the eye of the cowboy artist, the American
West still rolls unfettered, unsullied and untamed toward a horizon
rich with opportunity and bright with adventure.
   Some critics say the image never reflected reality, but it has
turned the annual sale and art show of the Cowboy Artists of
America into a happening for investors and collectors from more
than 30 states and many foreign countries.
   The event, which started Friday, is the 25th since four hungry
artists met in a tavern in Sedona and drew up plans to market a
brand of realistic, action-based art that was scorned in
avant-garde areas on both coasts but seemed as natural to them as
breathing.
   They and a few others sold $49,000 worth of paintings and
sculpture in 1965; last year's receipts from the offerings of 35
artists totaled more than $1 million. One oil by Howard Terpning of
Tucson brought a record $135,000.
   ``I thought when I first came in contact with their work that it
had no real economic value,'' said Sheldon Reich, a University of
Arizona specialist in modern American and European art.
   ``I have since changed my mind. It has a rather broad audience,
and the pictures do have rather substantial value.''
   Reich said that he nevertheless is no fan of the genre, which
association members call western American realism and which he
calls representational.
   ``Yes, they depict the West, but it's a mythical West for the
most part. They're not into, for example, revealing any accurate
depictions of the American past. It's the West of the imagination.
... From my point of view, it's not much better than John Wayne
movies,'' he said.
   CAA members have heard it all before, along with the jibes that
they are illustrators, not artists.
   In the preface to the 1989 exhibition catalog, then-president
William Moyers of Albuquerque, N.M., wrote that there is ``no
strict demarcation ... between art and illustration.''
   ``The only valid issue is whether our paintings, sculptures and
drawings are the best we can produce,'' he added.
   Terpning, who worked in New York for 25 years as an illustrator
for magazines and advertising campaigns, is equally unbowed by
criticism.
   ``I'm sure some abstract artists probably look down their noses
at what we do, and representational artists would prefer to look at
other representational art,'' he said. ``I know a lot of great art
is being done; I've seen some beautiful abstract art, and I say to
each his own. I've certainly seen some that I thought was
atrocious, but to somebody else it looks great.''
   If the cowboy artists are creating art for the masses, the
Phoenix show indicates the masses are responding.
   The event annually draws more than 1,000 customers at $125 per
head for the Friday night show and some other events, or $200 for
everything else and an awards banquet Saturday night.
   Each artist is allowed to display up to six works and set a
price on each. Few pass up the chance to buy, whether for resale or
collection.
   The bylaws of the invitation-only CAA stipulate that the
organization exists ``to perpetuate the memory and culture of the
Old West.'' They also require it to sponsor a trail ride and
campout each year, in which the real horsemen of the group mingle
with tenderfeet.
   Members such as Terpning and Harvey W. Johnson, another
illustrator who had taught for 19 years at the Famous Artists
School, form one end of the spectrum of the CAA - those who were
born far from the areas they came to love and depict on canvas. At
the other end is Bill Owen, a bona fide cowboy who grew up on a
ranch near Gila Bend and owns another near Dewey.
   Yet regardless of origin, they share the feeling of the genre.
To paint cowboy art, Owen said, each artist must know his subject
intimately.
   ``You have to have that love for the subject matter before you
can paint,'' he said. ``You have to know it inside and out. So many
things you see where it's obvious the painter just doesn't know his
subject matter. To me, it's like telling a lie.''
   Johnson said he was illustrating pulp magazines when he became
fascinated with mountain men and Indians, figures who recur again
and gain in his work.
   Now a resident of Santa Fe, N.M., Johnson echoed Owen's feelings
about authenticity depending on familiarity, and said his
background was helpful in the intensive research he needed to do in
the new field.
   ``Even though the pulps were inexpensive magazines, your things
had to be accurate,'' he said.
   The accuracy required by representational art makes it valuable
in preserving Western history, Johnson said. For example, he helped
restore the memory of the second fort built at what is now Laramie,
Wyo.
   The original was a stockade-style structure of wood. It was
replaced by an adobe fort which had vanished from memory. Johnson
said he was able to paint it from rude sketches done by an Army
officer who had visited there.
   ``The other thing is that the landscape hasn't changed very much
(in rural areas),'' he said. ``People say the Old West is done.
That's baloney. First of all, there's the people. They're the old
raw-boned people; you look in the old photographs ... that's the
same face. And of course the animals are the same - coyotes, deer,
eagles and everything else.''

<HEAD>One Year Later, Questions Persist in Stuart Story</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY ROGERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Charles and Carol Stuart were found shot in
their car on Oct. 23, 1989, they were depicted as a perfect
suburban couple whose lives had been destroyed by a monster from
the inner city.
   A year later, it is clear monsters were unleashed that night,
but no one can say which ones or how many. A husband's murderous
inclinations? Law enforcement ineptitude? A brother's complicity?
Racism?
   The monsters haunt Boston a year after the shootings. The grand
jury investigating the case has yet to issue any indictments. And
though the crime was ``solved'' in a television dramatization
broadcast nationwide, questions persist that may never be answered.
   On that night a year ago, Carol Stuart, a tax attorney who was
seven months pregnant, was shot in the head in the city's Mission
Hill area as she and her husband left a hospital birthing class.
   Mrs. Stuart, 30, died a few hours after her son, Christopher,
was prematurely delivered. The baby died 17 days later.
   Charles Stuart, who was seriously wounded in the stomach, told
police a black man had abducted them in their car, robbed them and
shot them. The next morning, headlines delivered his story to the
world.
   Police kicked in doors and randomly searched Mission Hill
residents in the hunt for the black assailant, whom they eventually
announced they had located.
   But that man was absolved Jan. 4, when Stuart jumped to his
death in the icy waters of Boston Harbor. His death came the day
after his younger brother, Matthew, told police he had been
enlised by Charles to aid in what he thought was an insurance
scam.
   Police say they had no reason to doubt Stuart, but blacks say
the authorities were too quick to pursue a stereotypical suspect in
a city racked by racism.
   ``I don't think the city's learned anything from this,'' Louis
Elisa, head of the Boston chapter of the National Association for
Advancement of Colored People, said recently.
   ``The issues are the same: Violence against people of color
continues. People still complain they still don't get equal
treatment under the law.''
   It still is not known exactly how the shootings occurred or who
fired the weapon. Though police believe Stuart killed his wife -
the conclusion of the television movie - it's possible someone else
fired one or both shots.
   If Stuart did fire the gun, what madness triggered him to kill
his wife for the insurance money to start a restaurant, as reports
have suggested, when the money was scarcely enough to cover the
mortgage on their house?
   Two men apparently know the secrets of the case: Stuart's
brother, Matthew, and his lawyer, John T. Dawley. But laws have
shielded both.
   Stuart apparently told Dawley of his plot to kill his wife the
day before he died. Prosecutors want the state's highest court to
force Dawley to tell what he knows to the grand jury.
   But Dawley is protected by attorney-client privilege, and
lawyers say it is unlikely the court will force him to testify.
   Matthew Stuart told police his brother tossed him a package from
his car in Mission Hill as part of what he thought was an insurance
scam. He allegedly disposed of the .38-caliber pistol used in the
shooting, as well as other items he said he believed would later be
reported stolen.
   He also said he did not recognize Mrs. Stuart in his brother's
car, mistaking her body for a duffle bag or laundry sack.
   Matthew Stuart has been protected from arrest and the intense
examination that would go with it by a state statute that immunizes
blood relatives from prosecution as accessories after the fact.
   ``It's quite likely he would have been prosecuted as an
accessory after the fact were it not for that exemption,'' said
Phyllis Goldfarb, a criminal law professor at Boston College who
has followed the case.
   His attorney, Nancy Gertner, said prosecutors were groping for
Dawley's testimony because they didn't have much of a case.
   ``If the investigation is foundering because they can't get
Dawley to testify, then they've done a bad job,'' she said. ``If
they're waiting on that, then their prosecution is in trouble.''
   Paul Leary, first assistant district attorney of Suffolk County,
has refused comment on the importance of Dawley's testimony. But he
conceded the grand jury probably would not reconvene until the
court rules on whether Dawley must testify.
   ``Even if Stuart's attorney has to disclose what he was told,
that may not clear up everything,'' Goldfarb said. ``The chance of
finding out the answers to this case died when Charles Stuart
did.''
   In retrospect, police had at least several reasons to look more
closely at Stuart, the 29-year-old manager of a fur store.
   Husbands always are considered suspects in such cases, and
Stuart's failure in his call for help to distinguish any landmarks
in a city he knew well seemed odd. He told the police dispatcher
that when the shots were fired, he ducked and his wife was hit. But
ducking would have little bearing on a bullet fired by an assailant
in the back seat.
   When he viewed a lineup containing William Bennett, the black
man police linked to the shootings, he could provide no stronger
identification than to say Bennett most resembled the assailant. By
then, Staart probably had seen Bennett's photo in Boston
newspapers.
   Stuart's death prompted renewed cries of outrage from black
leaders, who contended police ran roughshod over the rights of
minorities in their search for a black suspect.
   ``Police had nothing on Bennett, but still they kicked in his
mother's door, tried to cajole his family to give testimony,''
Elisa said.
   Still, some good has come from the tragedy. A foundation set up
by Carol Stuart's family in her name has raised nearly $500,000 and
funded 33 scholarships for students in Mission Hill.
   For her family, the pain of Carol's death has ebbed little in a
year.
   ``It's painful to talk about. We try not to,'' said her brother,
Carl DiMaiti. ``I'm surprised that it's already been a year. It's
still very hard to think about.''
   DiMaiti has taken over the family's pizza dough business from
his father, who has retired.
   ``Dad comes down to the bakery to help,'' he said. ``I'd rather
have him here with me than home by himself. The worst thing is for
them to sit around the house.''

<HEAD>New Farm Bill Makes Farmers Look Harder at Overseas Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new $40.8 billion farm bill cuts deeply
into spending on federal programs, another indication that farmers
will be linked even more firmly to overseas markets.
   Over the next five years, the Agriculture Department will have
to trim projected outlays by $13.6 billion as its part in an
overall $500 billion federal deficit reduction.
   The net result is that farmers will be looking less toward
Washington for a large part of their incomes and more to Europe,
the Soviet Union, Japan, China and scores of other countries that
need U.S. commodities.
   By reducing the amount of land eligible for crop payments each
year, the 1990 farm bill cuts costs. It also frees the extra land
for use as a farmer chooses by not restricting it to a ``program''
crop base.
   ``It gives the American farmer a great deal of flexibility and
freedom to plant,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, the ranking
Republican on the Senate Agriculture Committee.
   Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas and the chairman of the House
Agriculture Committee, said, ``You cross your fingers and hope that
giving them flexibility will make up for the loss of support.''
   The new farm bill is the latest in a long series of moves to
bring more market-oriented features into U.S. farm policy and to
provide an income safety net for producers.
   It was the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 that
produced a fundamental change in farm programs by initiating the
``target price'' concept.
   Under it, farmers began to get ``deficiency payments'' or direct
subsidies whenever market prices averaged less than the target
levels.
   This introduced federal income supports as a way of life in
American agriculture. Officially, the government said it was
supporting the incomes of farmers, not simply their commodity
prices.
   The concept survives in the 1990 farm bill - but in a reduced
role because of the need to trim federal spending.
   Market-oriented economies have burst upon the world scene faster
than anyone had dared speculate a short time ago, with new systems
undergoing development pangs in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe.
   A final push for the integration of the European Community, the
12-nation trading bloc, is set for 1992.
   Structural adjustments are being made throughout the Third World
as nations try to respond to complex and awesome debt problems.
   These and other factors are being brought to bear on U.S.
agriculture and its producers, says the Agriculture Department.
   Mathew Shane of the department's Economic Research Service says
the multilateral talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade also bear watching.
   The GATT talks, also called the Uruguay Round of discussions,
are scheduled to end by Dec. 31. The goal is to liberalize trading
rules among the 97 GATT trading partners.
   Agriculture is but one of 15 trading areas being negotiated.
However, it is seen as the key to the talks because Third World
countries have balked at agreeing to U.S. proposals on removing
barriers to trade in services and strengthening copyright
enforcement unless they win expanded markets for their farm
products.
   Last week the United States offered a compromise proposal aimed
at breaking a deadlock on the GATT trade reform discussions. The
Bush administration said it would seek agreement from the other
countries to cut farm export subsidies by 90 percent and
trade-distorting domestic supports by 75 percent over the next 10
years.
   Previously, the United States had sought total elimination of
export and other trade-distorting subsidies and policies by the
year 2000.
   The U.S. proposal in Geneva, where the GATT talks are being
held, was endorsed by the American Farm Bureau Federation. The
National Farmers Union, however, had reservations and still viewed
the U.S. position as ``basically anti-family-farm'' in its general
thrust.
   Economist Shane, writing in the October issue of Agricultural
Outlook magazine, described ``a growing consensus that domestic
farm policies have global repercussions.''
   ``A market-oriented outcome to the GATT talks would improve the
environment in which commodity markets operate,'' he said.
``Competitiveness in these markets would then be related to real
comparative advantages of the producing countries.''
   Shane said that for farmers to remain major players in world
markets, U.S. policies ``must be realigned to reflect the new
international realities.''
   He added, ``This would not mean giving up the objectives of
supporting farm income and providing increased stability for
farmers. But redesigning the policies to achieve these objectives
without distorting the market signals would improve U.S. export
performance and promote efficient use of global resources.''

<TEXT>
   His poll ratings have slumped, but it doesn't
show at the Republican cash register as President Bush seeks money
and votes for GOP candidates in a methodical, unmatched off-year
election campaign.
   He's helped raise more campaign money than any president before.
By White House count, Bush campaign events have produced about
$56.5 million for Republican candidates this year. That compares
with about $33 million raised at Ronald Reagan's appearances in the
last off-year election campaign.
   So far, Bush has attended 67 campaign events, with more to come
in the final two weeks. An extra push is likely just before the
Nov. 6 elections, to help mobilize Republicans and turn out the
vote.
   With the slip in Bush's popularity rating, Democrats have been
saying that he's less of an asset, claiming that some Republican
candidates are keeping their distance. ``Wishful thinking,'' said a
White House official, adding that there has been no letup in the
requests for campaign help.
   That held despite Republican differences about the politically
costly stalemate on the swelling federal deficit, which led Bush to
jettison his no-new-taxes pledge while Republican challengers for
Congress were campaigning on that very theme.
   He's campaigned for dissenters, including a senator who called
his budget settlement a turkey and a Senate challenger who likened
the tax provisions to a mugging. Bush skirts their differences by
saying that if there were more Republicans in Congress, the deficit
and the budget wouldn't be such a mess.
   At one point, White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu
suggested that Republicans who broke with Bush on the budget might
be taking a campaign risk.
   Sununu said he didn't threaten punishment. ``What I said was,
`The president will go into your district and campaign for you. He
wants your support on the budget... I hope that you supported him,
because if he looks you in the eye and asks you to do it on the
campaign, it might be a little embarrassing.' ''
   Even that hasn't happened. Bush said he is campaigning for broad
principles, not item-by-item backing. His campaign effort
concentrates on Senate seats and governors, first on defending
threatened Republican incumbents, then on boosting promising
challengers.
   The emphasis all along has been on fundraising, and it began
early, even before the election year, with GOP appearances the
White House said helped raise about $25 million in 1989.
   The rallies and the speeches are the visible side of the effort,
but the vital campaign business is done at the $1,000-and-up
receptions, where donors get a presidential greeting, a handshake
or a photo. That's the most effective kind of campaign work for a
president in an off-year, when he isn't on the ballot.
   For all his campaigning, Bush has avoided themes that would lend
themselves to a reading of the off-year returns as a referendum on
his presidency. The appraisal is inevitable, but he's done nothing
to encourage it, the way Reagan did in his off-year campaigns.
   Reagan campaigned intensively in 1986 in an unsuccessful effort
to keep Republican control of the Senate. He said he didn't want to
be ``a six-year president,'' with programs blocked by a Democratic
Senate. He urged voters to support Republican Senate candidates
``if you'd like to vote for me one last time.''
   But Republicans lost the Senate that year. The Democrats gained
eight seats, to the 55-vote majority they still hold.
   Bush asks support for Republican candidates and principles,
without personalized appeals like Reagan's. Presidents who try that
usually find their popularity is not transferable. And even when he
topped the GOP ticket, Bush showed no coattails in winning the
White House in 1988.
   So the circumstances fit a start-early strategy concentrated on
fundraising, a strong suit for any president.
   ``The president is raising a lot of money for their
candidates,'' said Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic national
chairman, but beyond the help that provides, ``it doesn't really
affect the politics of a state or a district.''
   The chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, Gov.
Richard F. Celeste of Ohio, said the Bush campaign won't deliver
votes. ``It is a cash cow which the Republicans are milking every
effectively,'' he said last month. ``It is not a raging bull aimed
at Democratic candidates.''
   Maybe not, but the Democrats do complain with some frequency
that some of their candidates are at a disadvantage because they
are being outspent.

<HEAD>Cranberry Growers Battle to Keep Environmental Exemption</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT IMRIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CRANMOOR, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a century, cranberry growers have
planted and harvested in the wetlands, exempt from state
environmental rules. Now, however, they are seeing red over
proposals to change all that.
   The state Department of Natural Resources claims the exemption
led growers to destroy thousands of acres of wetlands and rare
wildlife habitat. The growers counter that environmentalists have
misled the public about the quality of bogs converted from
wetlands.
   ``I had a flock of a couple hundred geese that fed every day on
a cranberry marsh,'' Ryan Walker said, peering over his fields as
cranberries were harvested. ``I can't think of one cranberry marsh
in Wisconsin that I would be ashamed to take anyone to.''
   Cranberries grow on low, trailing, woody perennial vines in
beds, usually 2 to 5 acres, which are surrounded by dikes. To
harvest the crop each fall, beds are flooded, the bright red
berries are gently knocked off the vines, and the fruit floats to
the surface.
   Wisconsin produces 36 percent of the nation's cranberries -
second only to Massachusetts. In 1989, Wisconsin produced 130
million pounds of cranberries, valued at $62.3 million.
   At least in part because consumers are eating more fruits and
vegetables, the cranberry business grew in the 1980s, when most
other farmers faced financial crises and drought.
   But environmentalists claim the bogs also have taken their toll:
Wetlands teeming with plant life are being destroyed, and natural
habitat for wildlife, sponges that prevent flooding and filters
that clean water are disappearing.
   Destruction of wetlands by cranberry growers has increased
flooding in some areas, decreased waterfowl production, and
deteriorated the quality of water flowing into some lakes,
environmentalists claim.
   ``I think there is a general consensus among the scientific
community, the environmental community that we have lost as many
wetlands as we can afford,'' said Duane Schuettpelz, a spokesman
for the DNR's Bureau of Water Resources Management.
   A legislative proposal would modify or eliminate the 1867 law
exempted cranberry growers from state regulations. A proposal by
the DNR would impose new rules to restrict growers' activities in
wetlands even if the law is not changed.
   The Massachusetts cranberry industry lives with regulations that
forbid the loss of any more wetlands, said Dave Farrimond, general
manager of the Federal Cranberry Marketing Committee, an agency of
the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   In fact, he said, the industry there expects to put 1,200 acres
into production over the next three years, the bulk of it in
uplands.
   Schuettpelz said new regulations are needed in Wisconsin because
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which approves applications for
expansion of cranberry operations under the Clean Water Act, has
been too lax in enforcing wetland protection standards.
   Wisconsin has 150 growers with about 10,000 acres of mostly
wetlands involved in direct production of cranberries, said Tom
Lochner, executive director of the growers' association. An
additional 100,000 acres - out of 5.3 million acres of wetlands
left in the state - is used for small dams, reservoirs, channels
and flowages needed for water for cranberry bogs.
   But it's the growth of the industry - 2,800 acres of new
cranberry beds in mostly wetlands over the last 10 years - that
sparked the dispute.
   When cranberry bogs are created from wetlands, the ground is
scalped, vines are fertilized and chemically treated for bugs and
wildlife and plants disappear, Schuettpelz said. Under current law,
the state has no say in any expansion.
   State Rep. Spencer Black, chairman of the Assembly Natural
Resources Committee, has formed a committee of environmentalists,
lawmakers and growers to reach a compromise.
   Black believes the growers have abused their ``special
privileges.''
   ``I'm not out to hurt the industry and stop all expansion but I
think reasonable control will make sure growth of the industry
takes places in a positive manner,'' he said.
   But growers say they'll go to court, if necessary, to maintain
the exemption.
   ``I think people are being misled on the destruction of
wetlands,'' said Bob Duckart, president of the Wisconsin State
Cranberry Growers Association and a grower with 100 acres of bogs.
   ``Our feeling is that we are not destroying it, we are
preserving it. We feel we are doing a lot of the things the DNR is
doing when they create a wildlife preserve,'' he said.
   Walker said proposed DNR regulations that would force growers to
expand by building bogs in uplands, away from water, would cost too
much.
   He also believes growers are not being credited for
environmental improvements made in bogs. Wildlife flourishes in
some bogs and growers store water with dams, reservoirs and
flowages, fulfilling functions of a natural wetland, he said.

   Leukemia meant almost certain death when E.
Donnall Thomas was in medical school more than 40 years ago.
   The fascination he developed then sustained him through a
four-decade attack on the deadly disease, and he overcame
skepticism and sometimes shaky financing to develop an effective
treatment.
   Thomas' lifetime of work resulted in bone-marrow transplantation
- a cure for thousands of patients worldwide - and earned him this
year's Nobel Prize in medicine, along with Joseph E. Murray.
   ``Forty years is a long period of time, considering we thought
this could be done in the middle 1950s. It's been slow,'' Thomas
said, reflecting on his work at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center in Seattle after being named a Nobel winner Oct. 8.
   Thomas didn't expect to work solid months at a time and be
constantly on call when he chose to go into clinical research. He
laughed when he recalled how he decided not to be a
general-practice physician after watching his father, the lone
doctor in Prairie Hill, Texas, on call 24 hours a day, seven days a
week.
   ``Then my son looked at all the problems I had getting money for
research, and now he's doing what my father did,'' Thomas said.
   Thomas, 70, became intrigued by leukemia and bone marrow
transplantation while at Harvard Medical School in the mid-1940s.
In leukemia, abnormal white blood cells prevent bone marrow from
producing healthy red blood cells.
   Scientists knew bone marrow produced blood and was vital to the
immune system, but did not know what controlled it or sometimes
made it fail.
   In the early 1950s, while at hospitals and research centers in
Boston, Thomas was one of several scientists searching for the
factor that could stimulate the regeneration of bone marrow cells.
   It was discovered that transplanted marrow could replace damaged
marrow in mice. Thomas extended the work to dogs, and in 1956 he
performed the first human transplant at Cooperstown, N.Y.
   The transplant took, but the patient's leukemia later recurred.
   That pattern was repeated often. Through the 1960s transplants
were performed mainly on twins, whose antigens, or ``cell
identifiers,'' matched perfectly.
   It was in 1965 at the University of Washington that Thomas made
a breakthrough that helped prove transplants could be widely
applied. He transplanted bone marrow in canine siblings that were
not identical but had matching antigens. The dogs survived.
   In 1968 Thomas assembled in Seattle a team of
scientist-physicians from around the country. By the early 1970s he
and his researchers were performing dozens of human transplants.
   Team member Alex Fefer recalled their first paper, which
reported results from 100 transplant operations. Only 12 patients
survived.
   ``There were a lot of people on the outside who said, `This is
terrible, you shouldn't do it, I wouldn't give it to my dog,' and
so on,'' he said.
   Many people felt that was a bad result, Thomas said. ``But we
took just the opposite view, that if we could cure some of those
patients with refractory in-stage leukemia we ought to do much
better if we took the patients in an earlier stage of the
disease.''
   The team persevered. Thomas and his wife, Dottie, continued to
take on what Fefer described as an enormous work load. Mrs. Thomas
has worked with her husband as lab assistant, administrator and
grant expert.
   ``I have met many workaholics in my day, but when I came here he
and Dottie worked literally every single day,'' Fefer said.
   Joleen Kellehere, director of nursing at the Hutchinson Center,
said: ``She struggled along with him, and when there were things to
be done, she did them. She continues to this day to do it. It's an
incredible relationship,''
   Today, thousands of patients with leukemia and types of anemia
have been treated by transplantation, and many have fully
recovered. Survival rates for some forms of leukemia are as high as
90 percent, Thomas said.
   The 60-bed Hutchinson Centerperformed about 430 transplants in
the last year. Ground-breaking is scheduled soon for a new site
that will add 40 beds. Thomas' original handful of researchers has
grown to a team of more than 50.
   It was the combined research talents of the team that made
bone-marrow transplants possible, Thomas said.
   Thomas said government grants are getting harder to obtain, and
the center has been forced to develop private financing sources.
But he and his wife have no plans to quit.
   ``The work is so fascinating that we don't want to leave it,''
he said. ``There are so many new developments that offer solutions
to some of the problems we have. We're looking at applying this
kind of technology to other kinds of cancer and genetic diseases.
It's an exciting time.''

   In the early days of kidney transplants the Murray
children weren't allowed to gab on the telephone for more than a
few minutes at a time.
   Keeping the lines open for possible organ donors was frustrating
for the houseful of teen-agers, but they knew it had to be
important.
   It was. Their father, Joseph Murray, won this year's Nobel Prize
for Medicine, along with E. Donnall Thomas of Seattle.
   The award announced Oct. 8 recognizes Murray's pioneering work
in kidney transplants. The 71-year-old surgeon performed the
world's first successful organ transplant - a kidney from one
identical twin to another - at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital on
Dec. 23, 1954.
   The household telephone regulations, explained his eldest
daughter, illustrated Murray's lifelong commitment to two groups:
his family and his patients.
   ``Our father was good about letting us know what he was doing
and the courage of the patients,'' said Virginia Murray Boyle, who
now lives down the street from her parents in Wellesley. ``He tried
to make us appreciate the simple things in life.''
   In fact, as Murray performed that first successful operation on
Ronald and Richard Herrick, his family was gathered in prayer at
home.
   ``My mother called us in to say a prayer for the courageous and
new type of operation,'' Boyle said. ``Many people didn't think he
should be doing it, but my mother said he was doing his best.''
   At age 5, his second child, Meg Murray Dupont, hardly understood
the significance.
   ``All I knew was my father wasn't around much that Christmas,''
she said from her home in California. ``We knew he was trying to
make kidneys work, but we had no idea it would lead to livers and
hearts and lungs.''
   At times, Murray said it was more difficult convincing doctors
of the promise of organ transplants than the public. ``They thought
I was just pursuing pie in the sky,'' he said.
   Today, however, the significance is recognized.
   ``It was more than just a technical feat,'' said W. Hardy
Hendren, chief of surgery at Children's Hospital. ``What Dr. Murray
did was truly a shot heard 'round the world - once again from
Massachusetts.''
   His colleagues describe Murray as a determined, soft-spoken,
eternal optimist.
   Nicholas Tilney, director of transplant services at the Brigham
and Women's Hospital who was a resident when it was called the
Peter Bent hospital, described Murray as a teacher and mentor.
   ``I learned mostly by his example, one-on-one'' Tilney said. ``I
recall one time a patient of his died in the middle of the night
and he took the trouble to come and talk to the family. Normally,
residents would do that kind of thing.''
   When one of Murray's kidney patients gave birth to her first
baby, Murray was in the delivery room.
   Some patients have kept in touch with Murray for decades.
   Born in Milford in 1919, Murray attended Holy Cross College in
Worcester and Harvard Medical School. He was an intern at the Peter
Bent hospital before serving in the Army.
   His early work treating soldiers became a common thread
throughout his medical career.
   ``Soldiers often died because they had no skin of their own to
be grafted to the burned areas,'' Murray said in a medical journal
in 1985. ``And therein lay the challenge; if only we could
transplant skin from other persons to the burn victims, these
soldiers might live.''
   Skin grafting was impossible at the time because scientists
hadn't discovered a way to counteract the body's inclination to
reject someone else's skin. But Murray sensed that kidneys would be
easier to transplant because they have larger blood vessels to
connect.
   From his early successes, Murray went on to perform the first
kidney transplant from a brain dead person and founded the
International Kidney Transplant Registry.
   After 20 years in the transplant field, Murray returned to his
first love: plastic surgery. He made a name for himself as a
leading physician in reconstructing facial deformities,
particularly in children. In 1983, the Nova television series
featured Murray in its documentary called ``A Normal Face.''
   Although a perfectionist devoted to medicine, friends and family
said Murray has always found time for them and a variety of
interests.
   Every year he took July off to spend with his wife, Virginia,
and their six children, often camping out of their Country Squire
station wagon, recalled Dupont.
   He climbed the Matterhorn for his 50th birthday and has trekked
through the Himalayas with his wife several times.
   Even a stroke at 67 did not hinder the energetic Murray.
   When his friend Tilney visited him in the hospital a few days
later, Murray was already at work on an article to inform doctors
what it's like to be a patient.

<HEAD>Rabbits Increasing to Plague Numbers - Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL ALEXANDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thomas Austin got an award 130 years
ago when he started raising rabbits for hunting in Australia. Today
he might get a swift kick.
   Richard Downward, a senior adviser at South Australia state's
Animal and Plant Control Commission, calls rabbits ``the most
serious environmental pest we have today in temperate Australia,''
an area that encompasses the southern two-thirds of the country.
   Officials conservatively estimate rabbits cost the wool and
cattle industries $79 million annually, not counting environmental
damage.
   ``The cost is not just in lost agricultural production,'' said
Ivan Nolan, who has spent 25 years at the Keith Turnbull Research
Institute in Victoria state working to develop weapons against
rabbits.
   ``Rabbits cause or contribute to oil erosion, increasing
salinity, loss of top soil, poor water quality, silting of streams
and dams, and the destruction of trees, as well as wildlife.''
   John Burley, another Animal and Plant Control Commission
adviser, said, ``They are a very efficient grazing animal and can
destroy the quality of a pasture quickly.''
   Many scientists believe it will be impossible to eradicate
rabbits. But researchers like Nolan fervently hope that's not the
case.
   He estimates his state alone has 25 million rabbits and 28
million sheep. Since eight rabbits eat as much as one sheep, Nolan
figures the sheep population could be boosted by 2 million to 3
million if rabbits were wiped out.
   The first rabbits arrived in Australia in 1788 from Europe. But
it wasn't until 1859, when Austin introduced them to the savannah
woodland of Victoria state for game, that they found ideal
surroundings and started to multiply in earnest.
   At first, trappers found the fur business lucrative.
   Then farmers began complaining about ravaged pastures. They
built great walls of chicken wire, poisoned rabbits and fumigated
their burrows.
   In the peak post-World War II years, hunters and trappers caught
100 million rabbits a year and produced up to 15.4 million pounds
of rabbit skins for export annually.
   The problem was that even if 80 percent of the rabbits were
killed in one area, the survivors could multiply fast enough to
recover their numbers in a year. In theory, one pair could produce
2,000 descendants in 12 months.
   The first breakthrough came when myxomatosis was successfully
introduced in 1950, initially killing 99.9 percent of the rabbits
infected with the mosquito-spread virus. Within three years, the
increase in annual wool production was estimated at 66 million
pounds.
   But rabbits began developing greater resistance to the disease,
which also was mutating into less-deadly strains, and the 1960s
brought a new plague of bunnies.
   Scientists then introduced the European flea, which was more
efficient than mosquitoes in transmitting the most virulent forms
of myxomatosis.
   But the fleas were not effective in the arid outback, and the
rabbits continued developing stronger resistance. As many as 75
percent living in moist areas now survive the disease.
   Still, the Animal and Plant Control Commission recently received
approval to bring in the Spanish flea, which will be able to spread
myxomatosis to rabbits in the outback, where resistance to the
disease remains low.
   Scientists hope to begin releasing them by early 1992.
   Research also is continuing into viral hemorrhagic
tracheopneumonia, known as VHD, an epidemic of which decimated
Europe's domestic rabbit population last year. ``We don't know its
origin or how specific to the rabbit it is,'' said Greg Mutze,
research officer at the Animal and Plant Control Commission.
   In the meantime, farmers are once again digging up rabbit
warrens, sometimes planting explosives, using poison gases, and
leaving out carrots laced with poison.

   Regular exercise is more than a state of
activity - it's a state of mind. People who can stick with exercise
apparently can focus how they feel and what they want, says one
expert.
   ``People who come in for the first time need to be informed
about the kind of experiences they are going through,'' said Lise
Gauvin, an assistant professor in exercise science at Concordia
University in Montreal. Her study of motivation was published in
the Canadian Journal of Sport Sciences.
   Gauvin and her colleagues studied 78 people at a YMCA. Some
exercised alone and others in a class. Still others were taking
language or art classes. The report classed them as autonomous
exercisers, fitness program enrollees, dropouts and non-exercisers.
   Researchers conducted interviews to draw out motivations and
perceptions. The report concedes this does not generate
standardized answers.
   Autonomous exercisers and fitness program enrollees highly
valued fitness and looks. But the dropouts and sedentary
individuals didn't seem to have well-focused goals. Some reported
liking fun and competition. But the report said, ``Answers were so
diverse that other categorizations were virtually impossible.''
   Autonomous exercisers also tended not to be concerned with
motivating themselves to exercise - they already had made it a
habit. The researchers found similar force of habit among the
fitness class enrollees.
   Dropouts, however, had planned extensively before they
exercised, and made sure their other jobs had been done beforehand.
   Regular exercisers generally liked the activity itself, the
researchers said, but dropouts and non-exercisers tended not to.
Dropouts tended to value the social interaction or competition,
while non-exercisers liked fresh air and sunshine.
   The report also says regular exercisers perceived their level of
intensity at 75 percent to 80 percent - a good workout. Recent
fitness enrollees gave estimates of 85 percent to 90 percent;
dropouts claimed 95 percent to 100 percent.
   And the reaction to exercise was different.
   The self-motivated autonomous exercisers reported feeling
energized afterward. Some of the fitness program enrollees reported
being tired. And the dropouts tended to feel glad it was over.
   This might be a sign that those new to exercise or those who
never developed a taste for it have not had a proper introduction
to the stress of exercise, and are confusing exertion with pain,
Gauvin said. Instruction in how to gear themselves mentally might
help them become regular exercisers, she said.
   That approach also is favored by another researcher, Rod K.
Dishman, an associate professor in the physical education
department at the University of Georgia in Athens.
   ``Removing the barriers is as or more effective than increasing
the motivation,'' he said. And, he said, barriers - such as
scheduling and family obligations - are best addressed
individually.

<HEAD>Tips for Buying Fish</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some tips to help make sure the fish you buy is safe
and fresh:
   - Buy from a reputable, popular dealer to be assured of good
turnover of stock.
   - Buy fish that is well-chilled, on ice at about 33 degrees.
   - The eyes of whole fish should be bulging and bright and shiny,
not watery.
   - Skin should be moist, scales shiny. Gills should be red or
pink.
   - The flesh should be firm to the touch. Filets should be firm
and glistening.
   - Fish that smells ``fishy'' probably has gone bad. Fresh fish
smells mild.
   - Eat the fish within 24 hours. Do not freeze fish unless you
are absolutely certain it has not been previously frozen.
   - Shellfish should be alive and lively.
   In her new book, ``Fish: The Basics,'' Shirley King suggests
shoppers go to the market willing to buy whatever fish is freshest.
``The depressing fact is that most of our fish reach us after many
days out of water, but if fish are properly handled they can still
be excellent,'' she writes.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new drug can ease the headaches, nausea and
temporary infertility that afflict about 40 percent of the 1
million Americans with ulcerative colitis, doctors say.
   Those side effects are the result of the sulfa drug
sulfasalazine, the standard treatment for ulcerative colitis. The
new drug, olsalazine, is equally effective against colitis but is
not a sulfa drug.
   That means it doesn't have the side effects of sulfasalazine,
said Dr. Stephan Targan of the University of California Los
Angeles. He is scientific adviser to the National Foundation for
Ileitis and Colitis.
   Ulcerative colitis, a severe inflammation of the colon, is
characterized by diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss and pain.
It can occur at any age but often strikes people in their 20s.
   The new treatment also has side effects, but they are milder
than the side effects of sulfasalazine, doctors say. Olsalazine's
side effects include abdominal pain and diarrhea in a small number
of patients, researchers say.
   Olsalazine wa recently approved for commercial use by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration.

<DATELINE>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Purdue University scientists are
trying to create an enclosed system that relies on four crops to
provide oxygen, water and food.
   They are working under a $5 million grant from the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, which hopes to have small,
self-supporting colonies of astronauts living on the moon by 2010
and on Mars by 2020.
   Cary Mitchell, a plant physiology professor and director of the
research, said the work initially will focus on three plants that
will comprise a complete diet for the astronauts: cowpeas, a
relative of black-eyed peas; brassica, a mustard-like plant; and
two strains of rice.
   The hydroponic crops also would give the astronauts oxygen,
Mitchell said.
   The astronauts shouldn't expect gourmet cuisine, he said.
   ``The species that were chosen are just the bare minimum that
will give a balance of protein and carbohydrates and fat. That
doesn't mean the diet will be interesting,'' he said.
   A fourth crop, blue-green algae, will help produce oxygen and
consume carbon dioxide.
   Unlike the bubble colonies of science fiction, astronauts and
plants on the moon would live underground to protect them from the
sun. Its damaging rays would be unshielded because the moon has no
atmosphere.
   ``On Mars it's a different story. It would be interesting to use
some natural sunlight there,'' Mitchell said.

<HEAD>Eating Fish a Growing Fancy in United States</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 10th graf, `In 1943...' to CORRECT total pounds for U.S.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>

   Unlike programs for meat and poultry, there is no mandatory
inspection of the fish eaten in this country, so as Americans eat
more fish, they should be aware of how to buy and prepare it
safely.
   The U.S. Senate last month passed legislation that would charge
the Agriculture Department with inspecting fish. Action was pending
in the House.
   The legislation, called the Fish Safety Act, is based on a
program in which the USDA already tests meat products for 200
harmful chemicals and other substances.
   The Food and Drug Administration and the Commerce Department
conduct voluntary fish inspections, but less than 12 percent of
U.S. seafood is inspected, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., says.
   Inspection is ``random, it's not enforced,'' said Jodie
Silverman of the Washington-based public interest group Public
Voice for Food and Health Policy. In his book, ``Diet for a
Poisoned Planet,'' David Steinman says he found more than 2,000
advisory warnings against eating certain fish have been issued over
the years by coastal and Great Lakes states.
   In addition to naturally occurring bacteria or parasites, water
can be polluted by industrial and sewage discharge or by blooms of
poisonous algae known as red or brown tide.
   Consumers should check for environmental warnings before going
fishing, eat a variety of fish species, and avoid the viscera, skin
and fatty sections of a fish.
   ``If you and others like you buy seafood from retailers who post
the origin of their seafood, other retailers will follow suit,''
Steinman says. ``Remember, the way you spend your food dollars has
an effect on retailers and ultimately on the environment.''
   Americans are eating more fish each year because of health
concerns and increased availability, but still lag behind many
countries, says Roddy Moscoso, a spokesman for the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration-Fisheries.
   Last year, Americans ate an average of 40.8 pounds of whole
fish, or 15.9 pounds of edible fish, compared with 7.9 pounds of
edible fish in 1943. But the average over the last four years was
152.8 pounds of whole fish in Japan, 46.3 pounds in Denmark, and
56.9 pounds in France.
   By comparison, Americans are expected to eat 64 pounds of beef
apiece in 1990, down from 77 to 78 pounds in the early 1980s,
according to the National Cattlemen's Association.
   Fish generally are low in calories and are a good source of
protein. They contain a range of vitamins and minerals, and their
omega 3 fatty acids have been linked to a lowered risk of heart
disease.
   On the low end of fat content is Atlantic cod, which has 82
calories in a 3.5-ounce portion, about six of them from fat,
according to the book ``Eat Fish, Live Longer'' by Anne M.
Fletcher.
   At the other end is Pacific herring, 195 calories in 3.5 ounces,
125 of them from fat, and black or red caviar, with 252 calories in
3.5 ounces, 161 of them from fat, Fletcher says.
   The tastes of different kinds of fish vary as much, chef Shirley
King says in her new book, ``Fish: The Basics.'' The book provides
drawings, nutritional information, common and scientific names,
cleaning and cooking instructions, and recipes for dozens of kinds
of fish.
   ``Fish taste best when simply prepared - broiled, grilled,
roasted, or baked in the oven, poached or steamed,'' King writes.
   Cooking fish to an internal temperature of 140 degrees will
destroy parasites, she says.
   ``When you eat any type of meat, poultry, fish or shellfish
that's not thoroughly cooked, there's always the possibility of
contracting certain types of food poisoning,'' Fletcher writes,
adding that the exact risks remain uncertain.
   Steinman says, ``By far the greatest immediate toxic risk in
eating seafood lies in raw shellfish.''
   The FDA has determined that the risk from raw oysters, clams and
mussels from water considered clean is too small to warrant a
warning. However, it recommends susceptible people, such as those
with cancer, liver disease or chronic gastrointestinal illnesses,
avoid them.
   Steinman warns that some toxic chemicals that are fat-soluble
will leach out of fish during cooking. Those liquids should be
discarded, he says.

   Housing starts skidded 0.6 percent in
September, continuing an eight-month slide that has become the
longest decline on record.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that starts of new homes
and apartments fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.14
million units on top of a 1 percent drop in August.
   Analysts said they foresee no improvement before next year.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Industrial production rose 0.2 percent in
September, with a 7.5 percent spurt in automobile production
masking an underlying manufacturing weakness.
   Excluding autos, production dropped 0.1 percent, the Federal

   NEW YORK (AP) - Warren H. Phillips, chairman and chief executive
of Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., announced he would relinquish his chief
executive duties on Jan. 1 and retire as chairman next July 1.
   Phillips, 64, has been chief executive of the media and
financial information company since 1975 and chairman since 1978.
He will be 65 by the time of his retirement as chairman.
   Dow Jones said Phillips' decision, announced Wednesday, was
based on the customary retirement age of 65 and was not connected
with recent financial troubles at the company.

   DETROIT (AP) - The nation's Big Three automakers are expected to
report drastically lower third-quarter earnings, walloped by a
slowing economy, foreign competition and rising fuel costs,
industry analysts say.
   Chrysler Corp. likely will report an especially hard quarter,
more than wiping out the profits it made in the first six months of
the year, analysts said Wednesday. Their financial statements are
to be released at the end of the month.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Three auto consumer groups asked Americans to
refuse to buy any car not equipped with air bags and chastised some
Japanese automakers for lagging behind Western counterparts in

billion loss in the last three months of the year.
   AMR said Wednesday it earned $65.6 million, or $1.05 per share,
down from 1989's $137 million, or $2.15 per share. Revenue
increased from $2.73 billion last year to $3.05 billion this year.

   NEW YORK (AP) - A second Eastern Airlines foreman at Kennedy
Airport has pleaded guilty to falsifying aircraft safety and
maintenance records and has agreed to cooperate with authorities,
according to court records.
   Michael Hennessey, Eastern's general foreman at the airport,
admitted to conspiring with other airline employees to falsify log
books, work cards and computer records in a scheme that allegedly
allowed unsafe aircraft to carry passengers.
   He was not charged in a 60-count criminal indictment that was
unsealed in July and accuses the airline and several top managers

<TEXT>
   Kuwait has a bustling economy, a loyal
population, a functioning government - but no territory.
   The emirate's government-in-exile is using Kuwait's huge global
financial resources to keep its national identity alive despite the
Aug. 2 takeover by Iraq.
   But how long can Kuwait - with its dispersed population and
scattered assets - continue to function financially as a sovereign
nation?
   Indefinitely, according to some Middle East analysts.
   The oil revenues that made Kuwait so rich have dried up with the
oilfields in Iraqi hands. And there is a worldwide embargo on the
oil itself.
   But long before the invasion, the Kuwaitis had plowed their oil
earnings into a variety of investments, which are now serving them
well.
   ``They're earning money on their money,'' said Katya Maddison,
an economic analyst with the London-based Middle East Economic
Digest. ``They're pretty stable for a considerable amount of
time.''
   After the invasion, an asset freeze was clamped on Kuwaiti
holdings by world governments to protect the assets from Iraqi
seizure.
   But within three weeks after the invasion, Kuwait's finance
minister, Sheik Ali Said, said the government-in-exile had ``plenty
of cash'' and was in full management control of its assets.
   ``The Kuwaitis have virtually an economy offshore now,'' said
Stephanie Cooke, a financial specialist in the London office of
Institutional Investor magazine.
   ``But in another sense their hands are tied because they're
having to cope with this assets freeze. Although they appreciate
it, it's making the day-to-day operations very difficult.
   ``Every time they have to move assets around, they need the
permission of several governments in terms of where the (financial)
instrument is,'' she said.
   Iraq has looted and ravaged Kuwait itself since the invasion.
But many of Kuwait's most valuable properties are beyond Iraqi
reach.
   Kuwait Airways, which lost most of its planes to Iraq, planned
to restart its operations Thursday from Cairo. The Kuwait Petroleum
Co.'s Q8 service stations are still pumping gas in Western Europe.
   The Kuwait Investment Office in London is gradually regaining
control of its monumental portfolio, estimated to total $100
billion, and the Kuwaiti government has pledged to stand behind the
obligations of Kuwaiti banks.
   ``The very fact that they're able to operate Kuwait Air and
Kuwait Petroleum Co. continues the country's identity,'' said
Maddison. ``The very fact that the name Kuwait is still there, I'm
sure, is a major irritant to the Iraqis.''
   Unlike other conquered nations - for example, the European
countries overrun by Adolf Hitler in the 1930s and 1940s - Kuwait
has reconstituted itself outside its own borders with its
governmental hierarchy and its assets largely intact.
   The investment income from Kuwaiti assets abroad is generally
estimated to exceed the oil revenue from what its leaders say are
the world's fifth-largest oil reserves.
   Kuwait's rulers without a realm, the al-Sabah family, run their
government-in-exile from the Saudi resort town of Taif, and its
international business empire operates mainly out of London.
   Policy-making is concentrated in the hands of the emir, Sheik
Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and a few advisers. A bureaucracy under
the prime minister and crown prince, Sheik Saad, handles day-to-day
decision-making.
   Both Kuwait Petroleum and the Kuwait Investment Office are
controlled by the nation's top leadership.
   Kuwait Petroleum, which operates its own refineries in
Rotterdam, Skaelskoer, Denmark and Naples, has offset the loss of
its own crude oil supplies with Saudi oil and purchases on the open
market, according to the authoritative Middle East Economic Survey
in Nicosia.
   For a nation of only 640,000 citizens, with a territory smaller
than New Jersey, pre-invasion Kuwait had enormous economic clout.
   The Kuwaiti investment portfolio, originally put together as a
hedge against the time when the oil ran out, has given
post-invasion Kuwait a financial infrastructure that can be
effectively operated from exile, said Rosemary Hollis, a financial
analyst with the Royal United Services Institute for Defense
Studies in London.
   But she noted many Kuwaiti banks are still unable to operate
because of the destruction of records in the occupied emirate.

   Farmers who live in this nearly deserted
prairie town, depressed by years of drought and low wheat prices,
are starting to dream again thanks to a conflict halfway around the
world.
   The sound of their tractors is accompanied by a new sound - oil
rigs - suddenly more profitable because Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
more than two months ago has nearly doubled crude prices.
   Balcron Oil of Billings, Mont., has found oil in two wells and
is drilling a third. They call it the Lucky Mound field, the first
in McLean County.
   ``It's very likely going to be a year or more, possibly two
years, before outer limits of the field are defined,'' said Bob
Graveline, associate director of the North Dakota Petroleum
Council.
   The first oil well was found in early August on land belonging
to Ed Wahner and his wife Bette, both 64-year-old retired farmers
from Parshall. Company officials say it's giving out about 120
barrels a day so far.
   ``It all happened so fast,'' said Ed Wahner, who leased his land
to Balcron about two years ago. ``We farmed it for many years and
we had no inkling whatsoever.''
   Owners of the minerals get royalty payments, or about one-eighth
of the production, Graveline said. The Wahners don't know how much
their first check will be, nor have they made grand plans - except
for a reclining chair they bought for the Rev. Thomas Sullivan at
St. Bridge's Catholic Church in Parshall.
   That's what the priest had mentioned when Bette Wahner asked him
jokingly about a year ago what he wanted if she ever got an oil
well.
   Now Sullivan has offered to ``help'' others in the community
strike oil - except he wants a Cadillac as payment this time.
   ``I haven't got any takers on that,'' he said.
   North Dakota, the country's ninth largest oil producer, has
given out 1 billion barrels since oil was discovered in the state
in 1951. State wells currently average 100,000 barrels a day.
   The McLean County wells are part of the Williston Basin, a
geological formation that covers roughly two-thirds of North
Dakota. The Balcron drilling is within the Fort Berthold Indian
Reservation, on land owned by Indians and non-Indians alike. The
Indians own mineral rights to one of the wells, said Rich Schilf,
natural resources department administrator for the Three Affiliated
Tribes on the reservation.
   Hope about the new wells comes as the Persian Gulf crisis
continues to push oil prices into the $40-a-barrel range, compared
with $20 a barrel in midsummer. If that trend persists, exploration
will become more profitable in the state, although Balcron
officials said their McLean County operation was planned long
before the price jump.
   Graveline said the Williston Basin will continue to be probed
because it is one of the least explored parts in the continental
United States.
   That's good news to the county's economy. Annie Hendrickson
remembers the time when she and her husband ran a bar in Raub. The
town died when the railroad passed it by, and the farm economy
slipped.
   Folks come by these days to sit at her kitchen counter, have a
cup of coffee and talk about oil. Jim Odeman, 26, who lives about a
mile away, was welcoming an oil exploration crew late last week.
   ``There's some hope,'' he said. ``Farming hasn't been too
good.''
   Balcron officials held  meeting with area residents to explain
the oil development process, filling the Raub Town Hall for the
first time in years.
   ``It's nice to have some faces behind an oil company name,''
Schilf said.
   Hope has also sprung in the form of jobs. Hendrickson's son Neal
found one to supplement his farm income when he heard about the
drilling.
   He didn't know what an oil pumper was or even what the job would
pay. Now, he goes out every day to check the Wahner well and make
certain it is pumping smoothly.
   ``It's something else to think about, instead of trying to think
about farm prices,'' he said.

<HEAD>Despite Oil Surge, Few West Texans See Return to `Good Old Days'</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ODESSA, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once the epitome of the 1980s oil boom,
this West Texas oil town is now plagued with closed businesses,
for-sale signs and ever-shortening store hours.
   As thousands of oil industry officials gathered here Wednesday
for the 1990 Permian Basin Oil Show, crude prices were at a decade
high.
   Still, no one was talking about a return to the good old days.
   Industry officials here for the nation's largest inland oil show
appeared to be doing more window shopping than buying.
   ``This quick rise in prices will not be the answer,'' Steve
Todt, general manager of Midland-based Cactus Drilling Co., said of
crude's current price. ``This industry was decimated during the
mid-1980s. It will take yearstto get it back on its feet again.''
   The price of a 42-gallon barrel of sweet crude oil, known here
as West Texas Intermediate, closed down $2.17 at $36.72 in
Wednesday's trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Prospective buyers shuffled from booth to booth, inspecting
skyscraper-like rigs and pumpjacks.
   But wallets stayed tucked away.
   ``They are not quite in the spending mood,'' said Rad Cagle, an
oil show director, sporting a Stetson hat and snake-skin boots.
   ``I think people are upbeat, and as soon as those oil prices
stabilize at around $20 to $25 a barrel, the folks will get real
excited. But until then, they are not going to get crazy with the
checkbook.''
   ``Nobody is making plans for next year based on $40-a-barrel
oil,'' said Gary Johnson, a Phillips Petroleum Co. representative
at the oil show. ``We would like to think prices will stabilize
around $25 a barrel soon. But if a war breaks out in the Mideast,
the prices we are seeing now would seem cheap.''
   Towns like Odessa and nearby Midland are hoping for a comeback -
albeit a gradual one.
   Pointing to a graph indicating the number of rigs drilling in
the Permian Basin over the past 50 years, Todt points to a line
drawn nearly off the chart in 1981.
   ``There were 663 rigs pumping in the Permian Basin that year,''
he said. ``Today we have 150 working. Nobody feels like we could
get back to that level again. And I don't think anyone wants to go
back to that. It was excessive.''
   The end of an eight-year war between Iraq and Iran in the
mid-1980s uncovered a huge surplus of oil in the Middle East.
Prices dropped and the bottom fell out.
   Locals watched the demise of nearly every oil-related business
that had lined up for miles on Highway 80, connecting Midland and
Odessa.
   ``It's tough to see Odessa like this,'' Billy Burcham said.
``This town is oil. And when times were good, you would have
thought this was downtown New York. But when the market dropped,
people couldn't get out of here fast enough.''

<HEAD>Dow Jones Chairman Phillips To Retire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman and chief executive at Dow Jones &amp;
Co. announced his retirement, but company officials say the move is
not connected to The Wall Street Journal parent's recent financial
troubles.
   Warren H. Phillips, 64, has been chief executive of the media
and financial information company since 1975 and chairman since
1978. He will relinquish his chief executive duties at the first of
the year and retire as chairman next July 1. Phillips will stay on
as a director.
   He will be 65 by the time of his retirement as chairman.
   Phillips' decision was based on the customary retirement age of
65, said Dow Jones spokesman Roger May.
   Eric Philo, a media analyst at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., said
Phillips' announcement was not a great surprise. He agreed it
probably was not connected with the company's financial problems.
   ``He has been operating in a very difficult environment in the
past several years,'' Philo said, citing the cutbacks on Wall
Street and the softness in the advertising market. ``You can't lay
it at his doorstep,'' he said.
   Journal newsroom speculation differed.
   ``This could be Phillips saying these problems are going to be
tough to solve and take a long time,'' a reporter, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said.
   Peter R. Kann, the company's president and chief operating
officer, will succeed Phillips as chief executive. Kann, 47, also
is publisher of the Journal.
   No date has been set for the board to elect a successor to
Phillips as chairman, said Dana Jennings, another company
spokesman.
   ``These actions will provide an orderly transition of executive
responsibility,'' Phillips said in a statement. ``After an
immensely satisfying 43-year career at Dow Jones and more than 15
years as CEO, it is time for me to step down and allow a new CEO
and his colleagues to provide fresh energy and continuity of
leadership in the years ahead.''
   In addition to the Journal, Dow Jones publishes the weekly
financial newspaper Barron's, produces a weekly financial
television show and provides financial information electronically.
   Dow Jones announced in an internal memo last Thursday that it
was freezing budgets for capital spending and salaries and imposing
other news and business spending cuts to cope with weak financial
results and the sluggish economy. The memo did not rule out
layoffs.
   The memo followed an announced 17.5 percent slide in
third-quarter profits, attributed principally to the company's
acquisition of the financial information service Telerate Inc. Dow
Jones also has been hurt by the recession plaguing Wall Street
since the 1987 stock market crash.
   Operating income at Dow Jones' business publications dropped 80
percent in the third quarter. Advertising linage at the Journal
dropped 16 percent in the period.
   At a regular monthly meeting Wednesday, the company's directors
approved Kann's new duties and elected Kenneth L. Burenga executive
vice president and successor to Kahn as chief operating officer.
Burenga, 46, currently is senior vice president and general
manager.
   The board also elected Burenga and Carl M. Valenti as members of
the board. Valenti, 52, is president and publisher of Dow Jones'
Information Services Group and president and chief operating
officer of Telerate.
   Phillips' career with Dow Jones began in 1947, when he joined
the Journal as a copy reader. He was named news editor in 1953,
managing editor in 1957, executive editor of Dow Jones publications
in 1965 and editorial director in 1971, a post he held for 17
years. Thereafter he held a variety of executive posts, leading to
his appointments as CEO and chairman.
   Dow Jones annual revenue has risen from $238 million when
Phillips became chief executive to $1.69 billion.
   Under Phillips' leadership, the Journal has expanded to three
sections, adding coverage beyond financial news. The paper added a
European edition and Dow Jones completed the purchase of Telerate
Inc., an electronic financial information service in the past
decade.
   The Dow board gave Phillips a $1 million bonus last year for his
long service to the company.
   Last year, the company earned $317 million, compared with a
profit of $228.2 million on revenue of $1.6 billion in 1988.

<HEAD>CBOT Approves Doubling Grain Futures Investors Can Hold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Directors of the Chicago Board of Trade have
approved a plan to double the number of grain and soybean futures
contracts that speculators can control at any one time.
   The directors acted under pressure from large commodity fund
managers. Critics said the move could make prices more volatile as
huge commodity fund trades stir up the market.
   Commissions paid to many exchange members, both brokers and
brokerage firms, likely would increase if the plan is adopted by
the exchange membership and approved by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.
   Approval is expected, and expanded limits could be in place
within a few months, The Wall Street Journal reported in today's
editions.
   ``Focusing on more business overlooks the fact that these funds
already exacerbate price movements,'' Benjamin Raskin, a futures
trader and honorary CBOT member told the newspaper.
   Acting en masse with holdings twice as large as previously
allowed could make price fluctuations even more dramatic than they
currently are, Raskin said.
   Earlier this year, the National Grain and Feed Association said
they thought such a move ``could cause market distortions that
would undermine price discovery.''
   The board approved doubling the total number of contracts
speculators can control to 4,800 for corn and soybeans and 3,600
for wheat. But it voted to limit holdings in any one contract
month, excluding the front month, which retains its current limit,
to no more than one-third of the total position allowed.

   The stock market turned upward today, trying
again to rally from close to its lowest levels of the year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 13.37 to 2,401.24
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in the early
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 665 up, 280

belief that worries about the economy had gone to unjustified
extremes.
   For example, they said expectations about corporate earnings
seemed to have been lowered so sharply that some individual stocks

the third quarter.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which posted flat earnings per

   In the economic news, the Labor Department reported that the
consumer price index rose 0.8 percent in September, just about
matching its rise in August.
   Brokers said the latest figure, though hardly cheerful news, was

<TEXT>
   Soaring energy prices after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait pushed Americans' cost of living up 0.8 percent in
September, the second consecutive monthly dose of bad inflation,
the government said today.
   The September rise matched the August increase in the Labor
Department's Consumer Price Index. If prices continued increasing
at the two-month pace for a year, it would produce an annual
inflation rate of 9.5 percent.
   The pickup in inflation this year translated into the biggest
boost in Social Security benefits in 8{ years. Based on today's
report, the government announced a 5.4 percent raise in benefits
beginning in January for the 40 million Social Security recipients.
   In addition to boosting inflation, the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion
hurt the nation's merchandise trade deficit, which jumped 2.4
percent in August. Rising oil prices pushed imports to a record
high. The gap between imports and exports climbed to $9.3 billion,
the largest since January.
   The stock market shrugged off the news, with the Dow Jones
average of industrial stocks rising 13.37, to 2,401.24 in the first
half hour of trading. Analysts said traders were doing some
cautious buying on the belief that worries about the economy had
gone to unjustified extremes.
   In a separate report, the Labor Department said Americans'
average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, increased
0.4 percent in September. Before adjusting for inflation, they
totaled to $353.92.
   In the inflation report, energy prices in September jumped 5.6
percent, the worst rise on record since the department began
tracking the sector in 1957.
   Gasoline soared 9.5 percent, the worst increase in 17 months,
and fuel oil rose 15.9 percent. For August and September together,
gasoline rose 17.9 percent and fuel oil was up 33.7 percent.
   Electricity and natural gas charges also rose, but less steeply.
   For the first nine months of the year, consumer prices advanced
at an annual rate of 6.6 percent, well above the 4.6 percent
increase for all of 1989.
   Analysts expect the bad news to continue through November or
December, even if oil prices stabilize near $40 a barrel, double
the July price. They anticipate a 1990 consumer price rise near 7
percent, the highest in nearly a decade. Prices increased 8.9
percent in 1981.
   The oil shock will begin feeding through to chemicals, airline
tickets and other energy-related products and services.
   The big bite out of consumers' wallets is expected to slow an
already sluggish economy.
   ``We're going into a recession, very clearly,'' said economist
David Wyss of DRI-McGraw Hill.
   Prices excluding energy rose a more moderate 0.4 percent in
September, the same as the previous month. But the Labor Department
noted several sectors of above-average inflation.
   ``While prices in most components of the index accelerated, the
run-up for petroleum-based energy prices has had the largest
effect,'' it said in its release.
   Medical care was up 0.7 percent, bringing prices 9.3 percent
higher than a year earlier.
   Clothing costs were also up 0.7 percent in September. Men's and
boys' clothing prices fell, but women's, girls' and infants'
clothing costs rose, as did the price of shoes.
   On a positive note for consumers, food and beverage prices rose
a moderate 0.3 percent last month, the same as August. New car
prices edged up only 0.1 percent after remaining unchanged in
August. Car dealers beset with lagging sales have been unable to
wean the public from rebate programs and discounted financing.
   Housing costs were up 0.4 percent, held back by a decline in
hotel and motel costs, which had been rising steeply earlier in the
year.
   The various changes put the index for all consumer items at
132.7 in September. That means a hypothetical selection of goods
and services costing $100 in the 1982-84 base period, cost $132.70
last month, up $7.70 from a year earlier.
   As bad as the short-term inflation outlook seems, analysts
expect inflation to return to normal next year, unless a shooting
war breaks out in the Persian Gulf and sends oil prices up further.
   ``It's important to draw a distinction between a one-time rise
in price level ... and whether or not that works itself permanently
into a higher rate of inflation,'' said Michael Boskin, President
Bush's chief economic adviser.
   ``Thus far, it appears that the most likely outcome will be
similar to its mirror image: The collapse of energy prices in 1986
when consumer prices fell ... but then, the following year
inflation went back more or less to its long-run historical
level,'' Boskin told an American Stock Exchange conference earlier
this week.

   The Treasury is postponing today's auction of
52-week bills because Congress has failed to extend the federal
debt limit, the agency said in a statement.
   The Treasury said Oct. 12 it would auction $10.75 billion in
bills today, to be issued on Oct. 25.
   However, the government's current $3.195 billion-debt ceiling
reverts to $3.12 billion at midnight Friday leaving the Treasury no

<HEAD>Reports 3rd Quarter Profits Down 52 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Chemical Co. said Thursday its
third-quarter profit dropped 52 percent despite increased sales,
citing higher costs for petroleum - used as a raw material for its
chemical products and as fuel to run its plants.
   Dow said its net income dropped to $282 million, or $1.04 a
share, for the three months ended Sept. 30, from $589 million, or
$2.19 a share, for the third quarter of 1989.
   The decline came although sales for the period rose to $4.92
billion from $4.25 billion a year earlier.
   For the first nine months of the year, the company reported net
income fell 46 percent to $1.11 billion, or $4.09 a share, from
$2.06 billion, or $7.61 a share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month sales rose 9.7 percent to $14.63 billion from $13.34
billion a year earlier.
   To delay the fuel cost impact, Dow increased prices for products
such as polystyrene plastic used for video cassette cases and
electronics cabinets, and polyethylene used for packaging and other
applications, spokeswoman Sarah R. Opperman said. Most prices were
raised by 10 percent to 15 percent.
   Financial vice president Enrique C. Falla said the company had
raised prices enough to offset higher materials costs by the end of
the third quarter. He said Dow's global purchasing capability and
manufacturing flexibility let it delay most of the cost impact
until the fourth quarter when price increases were implemented
worldwide.
   Dow, a maker of chemicals, plastics, specialty products,
pharmaceuticals and household products, employs about 55,500
people.

<HEAD>Colgate-Palmolive Reports Strong Growth in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colate-Palmolive Co., a leading maker of
consumer products, reported strong gains in third-quarter sales and
earnings Thursday, attributing the improvement to new markets and
the impact of a weak dollar.
   The company's earnings report contrasted sharply with the
disappointing third-quarter results reported by many major U.S.
companies, which have been adversely affected by a broad economic
downturn in the United States and a large jump in energy costs due
to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Colgate said earnings for the three months ended Sept. 30
totaled $84.44 million or $1.20 a share, up 10 percent from $76.72
million or $1.06 a share reported a year earlier.
   Third-quarter sales totaled $1.46 billion vs. $1.26 billion, a
16 percent increase.
   Colgate said its household and personal-care operations did
particularly well, with notable earnings advances in Europe and
Latin America. Colgate also said its expansion into Eastern Europe,
notably the former East Germany, also helped accelerate sales.
   Like some other large U.S.-based companies with significant
business abroad, Colgate said it was helped by the higher value of
foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar vs. a year ago. That
translates into higher sales and earnings figures when calculated
in dollars.
   For the first nine months of the year, Colgate said it earned
$247.59 million or $3.53 a share, up 14 percent from $217.52
million or $3.09 a share in the year-earlier period. Sales totaled
$4.21 billion vs. $3.75 billion, up 12 percent.
   Based in New York, Colgate is a major consumer product company
focusing on oral care, body care, household products and animal
dietary care, best known for brand-names that include Colgate
toothpaste, Ajax cleanser and Hill's pet foods.

<HEAD>Will Announce Losses More Than Tripled in Fiscal Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc., which reports fiscal year
results later this month, will announce losses more than tripled
from the previous year, a source familiar with the large national
retailer said today.
   Macy, still paying down debt from a 1986 management-led,
debt-financed takeover known as a leveraged buyout, will report
losses of $215.3 million for the year that ended July 28, compared
with a loss of $63 million the previous year, said the source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The retailer's earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation
- a key figure for a company paying down leveraged-buyout debt -
totaled $721 million in fiscal 1990, down from $926.1 million the
year before. The 1990 figure, which was lower than projections made
by Macy last spring, reflected a $30 million accounting adjustment,
the source said.
   Although worse than expected, the numbers were not a major
surprise. Macy announced earlier this year it had a disastrous
Christmas 1989 season and suffered a $39 million loss instead of
turning a profit during its second quarter.
   However, the full-year results also reflected disappointing
sales during the fourth quarter. Macy's August sales fell 5 percent
from a year earlier, the source said.
   Macy reported sales of $7.27 billion for the year, up from $6.97
billion a year earlier.
   The upcoming Christmas season is expected to be sluggish for the
entire retail industry, and Macy's poor showing during the summer
has raised concerns among investors about how the company will fare
during the holidays.
   Macy said it has responded to the poor business forecast by
reducing its costs and planning conservatively for Christmas.
   James Fingeroth, a Macy spokesman, noted that the retailer is
carrying $560 million less in inventory than it had a year ago and
is ``planning for a very sluggish environment going forward for the
forseeable future.''
   Last week, Macy announced it was selling its credit operations
to GE Capital Corp. Macy said the move would reduce its $4.8
billion debt load by $1.5 billion.
   The company has also said it is buying back some of its junk
bonds as another means of lowering its debt and a $595 million
annual interest bill. Macy has sold equity stakes to help finance
the buybacks.
   Besides its flagship Macy stores, located mainly in the East and
Texas, the company owns I. Magnin and Bullock's stores in
California and the West. It also owns specialty stores including
Charter Club and Aeropostale, which are stocked with Macy's private
label apparel brands.

<HEAD>Textron Third-Quarter Earnings Up Nearly 12 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Textron Inc. reported Thursday its
third-quarter earnings increased nearly 12 percent, largely on
improvements in its aerospace business.
   The Providence-based conglomerate, whose products range from
Speidel watches to Bell helicopters, earned $66.6 million, or 75
cents per share, compared with $59.5 million, 66 cents per share,
in the July-September period in 1989.
   The earnings were based on revenue of nearly $1.9 billion, an
increase of 11.7 percent from 1989's $1.74 billion.
   Textron said it was pleased with the results because they were
achieved ``despite unfavorable foreign exchange (rates) included in
corporate expenses, higher interest expense reflecting increased
borrowings and a higher income tax rate.''
   B.F. Dolan, chairman and chief executive officer, said Textron
had improved its performance on contracts in the aerospace
technology sector, where earnings rose 25 percent to $82.1 million.
   Commercial products also were fairly strong, with profits rising
17.3 percent to $31.9 million.
   Textron's financial services division did not perform quite as
well, although its income rose 8.3 percent to $74.7 million.
   For the first nine months of the year, Textron earned $204.9
million, or $2.28 per share, on revenue of $5.8 billion. That
compared with 1989's earnings of $182.1 million, or $2.06 per
share, out of $5.4 billion in revenue.

<HEAD>Sixteen Companies Qualify to Bid For Mexican Telephone System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixteen companies, including a dozen foreign
concerns, qualified to bid for the government-owned Telefonos de
Mexico in a sale that could bring the government more than $4
billion, the Finance Ministry said.
   The telephone company, known as Telmex, is one of a number of
state-owned enterprises to go on the block in recent months.
Interested investors had to deposit $10 million or demonstrate more
than $1 billion in assets to qualify.
   Telmex announced the planned auction on Aug. 13. Bidding will be
Nov. 15.
   Preident Carlos Salinas de Gortari's administration plans to
divest itself of the company by Jan. 31, in line with a policy of
selling off state enterprises, reducing budget deficits and
trimming bureaucracy.
   Telmex stock is estimated to be worth more than $8 billion, and
about half of it is held by the government.
   Mexican firms qualifying were Casa de Bolsa Inverlat, Acciones y
Valores, Gentor and Grupo Carso, the ministry said late Wednesday.
   Foreign qualifiers are Southwestern Bell, GTE, Citibank, US
Sprint, Bell Canada, Telefonica de Espana, France Cable and Radio,
STET, Nippon Telephone and Telegraf, Singapore Telcom, Nynex
International and Cable and Wireless PLC.
   To make the company more attractive, the government has launched
a three-year project to modernize the nation's long-distance
network with optic fibers.
   In March, the government allowed private companies to compete
with Telmex in the newly inaugurated cellular telephone market.
   Mexico has sold or is selling its nationalized bank holdings, an
airline, a hotel chain, mines and other interests.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Petroleum Co. PLC said Thursday it has
agreed to sell the companies holding its exploration and production
interests in New Zealand to Fletcher Challenge Ltd. for about $217
million.
   It said these interests include an 18.75 percent interest in the
offshore Maui field, and a 37.5 percent interest in the onshore
Kapuni field, both of which produce natural gas and condensate for
the local New Zealand market.
   Fletcher Challenge is a New Zealand energy company which holds a
50 percent interest in the Maui field.
   BP said ``the sale is in line with BP Exploration's previously
stated goal to focus on its core assets and dispose of those which
are non-strategic.''
   BP said its oil refining and marketing interests in New Zealand
were not affected by the sale and would continue as an important
element of BP's refining business worldwide.
   BP said its interest in forestry and chemicals in New Zealand
also were unaffected.

<HEAD>Pizza Hut Contract Starts Push for Expansion in Brazil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pizza Hut plans to open at least 100 new
restaurants in Brazil as a result of an agreement signed with a
South American investor, a spokesman said.
   The financial terms of the agreement signed Wednesday with
Ricardo Mansur, a prominent Sao Paulo businessman, were not
announced.
   But the spokesman for Pepsico Food Service International, Pizza
Hut's overseas arm, said it was one of the biggest expansions
abroad for Pizza Hut.
   Mansur started the talks with Pizza Hut and will operate as a
franchise, the spokesman said.
   The favorite pizza in Brazil is called the ``Brazilian.'' It is
made with ham, eggs and cheese.
   In a separate franchise territory near Sao Paulo, another
Brazilian franchise is completing its second Pizza Hut, the
spokesman said.
   Pizza Hut has more than 6,800 locations in the United States and
more than 1,100 in 60 countries overseas.
   A Soviet Union agreement calls for construction of 20
restaurants. Long-range agreements envision 250 Pizza Huts in the
United Kingdom.

<HEAD>Third-Quarter Earnings Rose 32 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medical supply giant Baxter International
Inc. on Thursday reported a 32 percent increase in third-quarter
profits, citing strong overseas markets.
   Baxter's net income rose to $135 million, or 46 cents per share,
for the three months ending Sept. 30, compared with $102 million,
or 34 cents per share in the third quarter of 1989.
   Third-quarter sales were $2 billion, up 12 percent from $1.8
billion a year ago, the company said. Domestic sales for the third
quarter were about $1.5 billion while international sales were
about $492 million, the company said.
   ``These results are excellent, consistent with the program we
laid out earlier this year to improve operating income,'' said
Vernon Loucks, chairman of the health-care manufacturer and
marketer. ``They also reflect continuing strength in our overseas
markets and in our alternate-site businesses.''
   For the first nine months of the year, Baxter reported a net
loss of $138 million, or 74 cents per common share, in cointrast to
a profit of $307 million, or $1.03 a share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month sales rose 9.3 percent to $5.9 billion from $5.4
billion in 1989.
   The company said the loss resulted from a pre-tax provision of
$566 million to cover the cost of a restructuring program.
   Baxter in April announced plans to pare its workforce of 64,300
by 10 percent and close or sell 21 of its 100 manufacturing plants
in 24 countries.

<HEAD>House Raises Tariffs On Goods From China To Protest Tiananmen
Crackdown</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The House voted today to raise tariffs on
Chinese clothing, toys and shoes by hundreds of millions of dollars
to protest the military suppression of China's pro-democracy
movement last year.
   In anticipation of a certain veto from President Bush, it also
prepared a backup, if contradictory, measure that would condition
continued open trade with improvement in China's human rights
records.
   Bush, a former envoy to China, has indicated he is prepared to
veto both, particularly if the milder version is amended later
today to require the release of all protesters arrested after
Chinese authorities ordered the military to crush the student-led
Tiananmen Square democracy movement in June 1989.
   The United States suspended high-level political contacts and
cut off international loans to China to protest the killings of
hundreds, and possibly thousands, of unarmed students and others in
the military crackdown.
   But Bush decided in May to continue for another year the lower,
``most favored nation'' tariffs that China has enjoyed since 1980.
Raising them, he said, ``would only hurt the Chinese people
themselves.''
   The resolution disapproving Bush's continuation of the lower
tariffs was approved on a 247-174 vote. It now goes to the Senate,
where Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has introduced a
similar measure.
   Under a new trade law enacted in August, overturning Bush's
decision requires a majority vote of both the House and Senate
before Saturday.
   The resolution's author, Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y.,
acknowledged that supporters lack the votes to override a
presidential veto, but said just passing it ``will sent a hell of a
message to the People's Republic of China.''
   The administration estimates that the higher tariffs from
suspending China's most-favored status would raise the price of its
exports to the United States an average 40 percent.
   For example, a Chinese-made sweater with an import price of $20
now carries a tariff of $1.20. Without most-favored status, its
import price would be $32.
   The United States imported about $12 billion in Chinese products
last year while sending China some $5.8 billion in U.S. exports.
   The Bush administration and others supporting the continuation
of most-favored-nation status say higher tariffs would hurt
reform-minded Chinese seeking to keep China open to the rest of the
world.
   They argue that increased tariffs would also deal a severe blow
to Hong Kong, through which a large portion of China's exports
pass, lead to Chinese retaliation against American exporters and
mean higher prices for American consumers.

<HEAD>Report: IBM, Motorola End Talks On Sharing Advanced Chip
Technology</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IBM and Motorola Inc. have ended talks on
sharing IBM's technology for making advanced computer memory chips,
The New York Times reported Thursday.
   The companies had been discussing the possibility of Motorola
using IBM's technology for making 4-million-bit chips, the
highest-capacity memory chips now in production.
   International Business Machines Corp. entered into the talks
earlier this year with the hope of establishing a stronger domestic
semiconductor industry, the Times said. IBM is the only domestic
maker of 4-million-bit chips.
   The Times, which based its report on anonymous industry and
government sources, did not say why the talks broke off.
   Motorola has an agreement with Toshiba Corp. of Japan to make
1-million-bit chips and plans to use Toshiba designs to produce
4-million-bit chips in the future, the Times reported.
   IBM spokesman Mike King said Thursday the company never
acknowledged such talks and so it had no comment on the Times
report. A Motorola spokeswoman said her company also had no
comment.
   IBM currently licenses its memory chip technology to Micron
Technologies Inc., a chip maker in Boise, Idaho. IBM does not sell
computer chips on the open market; it uses its entire chip
production in its own products.
   A bit is the smallest piece of information used by a computer.
Because of the way memory chips are designed, new generations of
chips increase in capacity fourfold.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price of Michelin shares fell sharply Thursday
on the Paris stock exchange as the world's biggest tire
manufacturer announced it expected a huge loss for 1990.
   Company officials told financial analysts that Michelin expects
to post a consolidated net loss of more than 2.31 billion francs,
or $440 million, this year. Last year, Michelin had a net profit of
2.449 billion francs.
   Eric Bourdais de Charbonniere, Michelin's finance director,
attributed the sharp erosion to the company's $1.5 billion takeover
of Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. last year, weaker car and tire
markets, and the appreciation of the franc against the dollar and
other currencies.
   Michelin shares were temporarily suspended from trading on the
Paris exchange after disclosure of the anticipated losses sparked a
decline of nearly 10 percent in the share price. The stock closed
at 68.4 francs, down from 74.5 francs at Wednesday's close. The
dollar has been trading at about 5.06 francs.
   Michelin's share price has been rising sharply over the past
week on speculation that the company would make a favorable
announcement at the analysts' meeting.
   The company said the exact amount of the 1990 loss will depend
on the scope of yet-undetermined restructuring charges it will take
for the second half of this year.
   The 1990 forecast is much worse than previous projections by
market analysts, who calculated that this year's loss would reach
between 1 billion and 1.5 billion francs.
   Company officials said Michelin will remain in the red in the
first half of 1991, but should return to the break-even point later
next year.
   De Charbonniere, said it was too early to assess whether the
tire and rubber group will break even for all of 1991.
   Company officials said that in order to be able to break even by
the end of next year, Michelin will have to increase its cash flow
by 2.5 billion francs. They said the return to profitability will
require cuts in oprrating costs that may involve steps leading to
job cuts affecting production, commercial and administrative
employees.
   Carlos Ghosn, director of Michelin's North American operations,
said Uniroyal Goodrich is expected to report cash flow of about $55
million but the unit will not make any positive or negative
contribution to Michelin's consolidated 1990 earnings.
   He said Michelin intends to proceed with sales of certain of
Uniroyal Goodrich's textile assets, but didn't elaborate.

   Positive returns from its insurance unit helped
Primerica's profits jump 20 percent in the third quarter, but
diminished investment banking revenue hurt PaineWebber's profits,
the companies said Thursday.

<HEAD>Primerica</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Primerica Corp., parent of the Smith Barney, Harris, Upham &amp; Co.
brokerage, reported earnings of $94 million, or 82 cents a share,
up from $78.3 million, or 80 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue
totaled $1.5 billion, up 2 percent from $1.47 billion.
   Primerica Chairman Sanford I. Weill said the company's consumer
finance and insurance unit is expected to ``continue delivering
sizable and growing earnings contributions, which cushion the
impact . . . of the cyclical results in Smith Barney's
businesses.''
   The company's insurance services operations, which include A.L.
Williams, saw earnings rise 20 percent to $64.8 million on revenues
of $545.1 million.
   But earnings slumped 43 percent to $15.5 million on $413.2
million in revenue in the investment services unit, which includes
Smith Barney. Primerica cited a decline in commissions amid weak
volume on world stock exchanges and lower investment banking
revenues.
   Weill said Primerica will ``continue evaluating all our
businesses in the difficult environment ahead and will make
whatever adjustments become necessary to sustain profitabilty.''
   For the first nine months, Primerica earned $274.1 million, or
$2.38 a share, up 42 percent from $193.1 million, or $1.98 a share
a year ago when fewer shares were outstanding.
   Revenue for the period totaled $4.5 billion, up 9 percent from
$4.11 billion in the first nine months of 1989.

   PaineWebber Group Inc. said earnings plummeted 43 percent to
$9.57 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with $16.83 million,
or 41 cents a share a year earlier.
   Revenue was marginally higher at $720.65 million, compared with
$719.39 million in the third quarter of 1989.
   Chairman Donald B. Marron said earnings were adversely affected
by risk arbitrage trading results and ``the industrywide softness
in investment banking.''
   Still, the firm has managed to expand its retail customer base,
which saw assets in PaineWebber accounts rise 10 percent to $69
billion.
   For the nine-month period, earnings fell 15 percent to $35
million, or 70 cents a share, from $41.1 million, or 85 cents a
share in the year-ago period. Revenue advanced 8 percent to $2.28
billion from $2.12 billion in the first nine months of 1989.

<HEAD>Accounting Board Takes Step Toward Far-Reaching Rule Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The board that makes the nation's accounting rules has taken a
major step toward changing the way retiree health benefits are
reported by businesses, which if approved could slash billions of
dollars from corporate earnings.
   Diana Scott, a project manager of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, said Thursday that members voted 4-3 Wednesday to
order the board's technical staff to prepare a draft version of the
rule change.
   Scott said the board expects to vote on the draft by
Thanksgiving, and if approved the rule change would be promulgated
by the end of the year and take effect starting in 1993.
   The board, based in Norwalk, Conn., is a federally sanctioned
body that sets the standards for how companies report their
financial condition in quarterly earnings statements and other
documents.
   Since February 1989 it has been considering a retiree-benefit
rule change that would more accurately state a company's long-term
liability in its financial reporting.
   Under the current rule, most companies account for benefits to
retirees on what is known as a pay-as-you-go basis. But under the
change, they would not be able to wait until the costs are
incurred. Instead, they would have to subtract from each year's
earnings a portion of the expected costs.
   Most companies have accepted the logic behind the change,
although they have said it could result in drastic reductions in
their bottom lines. Over the past 20 months, many lobbied
successfully to soften some provisions of the proposal, such as
gradually implementing it over a few years.
   Some retiree benefits analysts have estimated the cost of the
rule change to businesses could be at least $200 billion, just for
the largest U.S. companies. Others have estimated the cost as high
as $400 billion.

<HEAD>Imports Hit New Record Following Oil Price Surge</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surging oil prices drove imports to a new
record in August and helped propel the U.S. merchandise trade
deficit to its highest level in seven months, the government
reported Thursday.
   Analysts said that excluding the oil factor, the trade picture
actually improved as exports continued to grow moderately.
Nevertheless, soaring energy costs were adversely affecting the
economy and driving up inflation.
   In its first report on America's trade gap since Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2 and disrupted international oil markets, the
Commerce Department said imports rose 1.8 percent, to $42.0
billion, while exports gained 1.6 percent, to $32.6 billion.
   The difference meant a $9.3 billion imbalance, up 2.4 percent
from July and the largest since a $10.2 billion gap last January.
The non-oil deficit, on the other hand, fell from $5.4 billion in
July to $5.0 billion the following month.
   The previous record for imports was $41.6 billion in March this
year.
   ``If you throw out energy, the trade picture shows gradual
continuing improvement,'' said Donald Ratajczak, economist at
Georgia State University.
   Nevertheless, ``the deficit is going to be plagued at least
through the end of the year by increasing oil imports,'' said
economist Mark M. Zandi of Regional Financial Associates in West
Chester, Pa.
   The volume of imported oil actually declined in August, down
10.3 percent to 7.95 million barrels a day. But a hefty 34.8
percent price gain, to $19.54 a barrel, pushed overall petroleum
costs up 20.9 percent to $4.8 billion. And the price of oil has
since doubled to nearly $40 a barrel.
   Bruce Steinberg, senior economist with Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets in New York, said despite the boost in the deficit, the
trade gap still could end the year under $100 billion for the first
time since 1983.
   For the first eight months of 1990, the deficit was running at
an annual rate of $96.8 billion, compared to $110.7 billion during
the same period last year.
   Zandi said the nation's trade problems could benefit from a
weakening U.S. economy.
   ``What we may see is that imports of automobiles and industrial
goods will fall and offset the oil import bill,'' he said.
   However, imports of foreign-made cars rose 2.1 percent, to $3.39
billion, in August.
   Exports, on the other hand, rebounded from a 6.1 percent decline
in July.
   ``The good news is that the lower dollar is still helping on the
export side and we saw at least a modest further increase,'' said
economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a New York
securities dealer. ``The hope is that modest growth in the export
sector will help offset the weakness we see in all the other major
sectors of the economy.''
   J. Antonio Villamil, Commerce Department chief economist, noted
that ``export growth has been the major contributor to the
increases in overall economic activity during the year,'' and said,
``We expect this trend to continue.''
   Indeed, fully one-third of overall U.S. economic growth for the
last three years has been supplied by export sales. They had become
even more important recently as consumer spending has slowed.
   But economists believe the oil-price shock is likely to further
weaken the economy and drive it into a recession - if it isn't
there already.
   As usual, the biggest deficit was with Japan - a $3.8 billion
imbalance, up from $3.0 billion in July.
   Other deficits included Taiwan, $1.2 billion; China, $1.1
billion; Canada, $509 million; South Korea, $518 million; Hong
Kong, $397 million; Western Europe, $374 million, and Brazil, $178
million.

<HEAD>Inflation Soars Again, Fueled by Gulf Oil Prices</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans' spendin power sank again in
September as the Persian Gulf crisis pushed prices up a sharp 0.8
percent for the second straight month, the government said
Thursday. Still, inflation not tied to oil prices remained
relatively mild.
   If the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index continued
increasing at the September pace for a year, it would produce an
annual inflation rate of 9.5 percent.
   Most economists believe price increases - absent the outbreak of
a shooting war - will return to a more normal level by the end of
the year. The oil shock nevertheless has added a new burden for an
economy that was already on the brink of recession.
   ``You take out energy and the numbers aren't that bad. But on
the other hand, people have to buy the energy and it gives you an
annual inflation rate roughly double the rate of wage growth,''
said economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University.
   ``It means that people won't have a lot of money to spend on
Christmas,'' he said.
   The ``core'' inflation rate - prices excluding food and energy -
was 0.3 percent in September, down from 0.5 percent in August.
   For the first nine months of 1990, prices increased at an annual
rate of 6.6 percent, well above the 4.6 percent increase for all of
last year. The rate for all of 1990, if it comes in close to 7
percent as now expected, will be the worst since 1981, when prices
shot up 8.9 percent.
   The pickup in inflation so far this year helped bring about the
biggest boost in Social Security benefits in 8{ years. Based on
Thursday's report, the government announced a 5.4 percent rise in
benefits beginning in January for the 40 million Social Security
recipients.
   In addition to boosting consumer inflation based on oil and
various energy products, the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion and its
aftermath hurt the U.S. merchandise trade deficit. It rose 2.4
percent to a seven-month high of $9.3 billion in August. Increasing
oil prices pushed imports to a record high, more than offsetting a
modest rise in exports.
   The stock market shrugged off the news, with the Dow Jones
average of industrial stocks advancing. Analysts said traders were
doing some cautious buying in the belief that worries about the
economy had gone to unjustified extremes.
   In a separate report, the Labor Department said Americans'
average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, increased
0.4 percent in September. Still, they were down 1.5 percent from a
year ago.
   In the inflation report, energy prices in September jumped 5.6
percent, the worst rise on record since the department began
tracking the sector in 1957.
   Gasoline soared 9.5 percent, the largest increase in 17 months,
and fuel oil rose 15.9 percent. For August and September together,
gasoline rose 17.9 percent and fuel oil was up 33.7 percent.
Electricity and natural gas charges also rose, but less steeply.
   Analysts expect the bad news to continue through November or
December, even if oil prices stabilize near where they are now -
around $40 a barrel, double the July price.
   In the next few months, the oil shock probably will begin
feeding through to chemicals, airline tickets and other
energy-related products and services.
   But it probably will not produce a permanent increase in the
inflation rate, said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp;
Co., a government securities dealer in New York.
   ``We simply don't suffer this time around from the same kind of
inflationary psychology as we did during earlier oil shocks in 1973
and 1979. In the `70s, consumers were buying in anticipation of
price increases. Now, consumers are waiting for a bargain,'' he
said.
   Jones said recent increases in consumer prices are great enough
to cause the Federal Reserve to be cautious about stimulating the
economy with lower interest rates but not so great as to prevent a
quarter-point cut in short-term rates if Congress and President
Bush agree on a plan to cut the federal budget deficit.
   In other details, the Labor Department said:
   -Food and beverage prices rose a moderate 0.3 percent last
month, the same as August.
   -Medical care was up 0.7 percent, bringing prices 9.3 percent
higher than a year earlier.
   -Clothing costs also were up 0.7 percent in September. Men's and
boys' clothing prices fell, but women's, girls' and infants'
clothing costs rose, as did the price of shoes.
   -New car prices edged up only 0.1 percent after remaining
unchanged in August. Car dealers beset with lagging sales have been
unable to wean the public from rebate programs and discounted
financing.
   -Housing costs were up 0.4 percent, held back by a decline in
hotel and motel costs, which had been rising steeply earlier in the
year.
   The various changes put the index for all consumer items at
132.7 in September. That means a hypothetical selection of goods
and services costing $100 in the 1982-84 base period, cost $132.70
last month, up $7.70 from a year earlier.

   The stock market chalked up a broad gain today,
rallying from close to its lowest levels of the year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 43.07 to 2,430.94
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,062 up, 445
down and 412 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders were doing some buying on the belief that
worries about the economy had gone to unjustified extremes.
   For example, they said expectations about corporate earnings
seemed to have been lowered so sharply that some individual stocks
were starting to rise in response even to lackluster reports for
the third quarter.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which posted flat earnings per
share for the third quarter, rose 1 to 31~.
   The market's advance got a big boost from falling oil prices.
Crude oil for November delivery traded briefly below $35 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange before rebounding at

<HEAD>Richest Man Supports Income Tax Hike with Capital Gains Tax Cut</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Budget-Taxes Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   John W. Kluge, a Virginia billionaire listed by Forbes magazine
as the richest man in America, said Thursday he favors an increase
in the nation's top income tax rate if the capital gains tax is
reduced.
   ``I recognize that the budget deficit must be reduced and that
issues of tax fairness are prominent in the minds of many
Americans,'' Kluge, 76, said in a telephone interview with AP
Network News, a broadcasting operation of The Associated Press.
   ``To address both of those concerns, I personally would favor
raising the top income tax rate to 33 percent as a part of a
package that included a meaningful reduction in capital gains
tax,'' Kluge said.
   For some time, Kluge said, U.S. businesses have been hampered by
the high cost of capital, ``especially when compared to businesses
in Japan and many European countries.''
   ``I believe that the most effective way to bring down the cost
of capital would be to reduce the rate at which capital gains are
taxed,'' he said. ``The president and many members of the Senate
and the House of Reresentatives share that view.''
   Kluge said tax laws should be written ``to foster and encourage
the American genius for creating new businesses and new jobs. I
firmly believe that the best way to further that goal would be a
lowered tax on capital gains for small and large businesses.''
   Kluge said most people reinvest money from capital gains.
   ``Money just doesn't stay at the sidelines,'' he said. ``It
seems to me that if one is to risk capital, there has to be an
incentive. If there is no incentive to risk capital, why even try
to make an investment? You might as well live off interest on
money.''
   Kluge (pronounced kloogy), owns a 10,000-acre farm near
Charlottesville, Va. and is worth about $5.6 billion, Forbes
estimated in its 1990 ranking of richest Americans released earlier
this month.
   He was speaking from his office at Metromedia Co., the business
he founded and the basis for his fortune. Years ago he sold the
company's radio and television properties for $4.65 billion and
netted more than $1.6 billion.
   Since then, Kluge has invested his profits into other interests,
including cellular telephones and restaurants. He owns the
Ponderosa Steak House, Bonanza and Steak &amp; Ale chains. He recently
sold his New York cellular operations for more than $1 billion in
cash and $850 million in stock.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices were mostly higher, but corn
and soybean prices were off at the close Thursday at the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Wheat futures were supported by an increase in export business
this week, traders said.
   Analysts said severe weather moving into the Midwest growing
regions helped rally prices Wednesday, but now that the wintry
weather was here, there was nothing else to keep prices going much
higher.
   Traders were unimpressed with the U.S. Agriculture Department
announcement overnight that the Soviet Union had purchased 350,000
metric tons of U.S. corn.
   ``They're saying `Who cares,''' said grain analyst Mickey Luth
of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   He said the purchase was a drop in the bucket compared with the
16 million tons the Soviets had bought a year ago.
   Luth also said that demand for soybeans are below what they were
a year ago.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 2{ cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.64} cents a bushel; corn
was { cent to 1{ cents lower, with December at $2.28 a bushel; oats
were \ cent to 1 cent lower, with December at $1.23 a bushel; and
soybeans were 1 cent to 3{ cents lower, with November at $6.11

<HEAD>Bowater Reports 33 Percent Drop in Earnings for Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DARIEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A glut of newsprint and wood pulp
contributed to a 33 percent drop in third-quarter earnings at
Bowater Inc., the paper manufacturer announced Thursday.
   Bowater reported earnings of $23.7 million, or 63 cents per
share, on sales of $346.6 million. That compared with earnings of
$35.5 million, or 95 cents per share, on sales of $360.1 million in
the same 1989 period.
   A June newsprint price increase was not enough to offset
operating problems at Bowater's Calhoun, Tenn., and Nova Scotia,
Canada mills, said A.P. Gammie, chairman and chief executive
officer.
   Gammie said pulp prices continued to weaken on world markets
during the third quarter.
   Bowater manufactures newsprint, bleached pulp and specialty
papers.
   For the first nine months of 1990, Bowater reported earnings of
$60.1 million, or $1.82 per share, on sales of $1.03 billion. That
included an extraordinary charge of $9 million in the second
quarter.
   Earnings totaled $112.4 million, or $3 per share, on sales of
$1.08 billion, in the first nine months of 1989.

<HEAD>Chief Executive Officer Of Mobil Corp. Testifies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHEILA McNULTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mobil Corp.'s chief executive officer,
tesifying in a wrongful firing suit, said Thursday that he knew
nothing about an employee who said he was fired for not going along
with an alleged coverup of environmental problems at a company
plant.
   ``We have too much to lose to defeat the law,'' Allen E. Murray
told U.S. District Judge Harold Ackerman. ``We're not a
fly-by-night business. We've been around for 100 years.''
   The judge had ordered Murray to testify in the case of an
employee of Mobil Chemical Co., a division of Mobil Corp. The
employee, Valcar Bowman, contends he was fired in 1986 as the No. 2
environmental officer in that division because he blew the whistle
on a cover-up at a plant in Bakersfield, Calif.
   Mobil says it fired the Princeton, N.J.-based manager as part of
a cost-cutting campaign. The company later added that Bowman was
fired for insubordination and disobedience.
   In a hearing last year, Judge Ackerman noted that in 1986 - the
year Bowman was fired - Mobil Chemical had its best year ever, with
net earnings rising to a record $140 million, a 164 percent
increase from 1985.
   During testimony, Murray touched directly on several of Bowman's
charges.
   Bowman insists that following a government search of Mobil's oil
refinery in Torrance, Calif., the company ordered his staff to
deliver all records that it could legally move from the
Bakersfield, Calif., plant to the company's outside counsel.
   Bowman says the theory behind moving documents was that
attorney-client privilege would keep the documents confidential and
out of the hands of investigators.
   But Murray said such moves are not unusual for a company the
size of Mobil, the country's second largest oil company behind
Exxon Corp. with about 150,000 employees and hundreds of plants
around the world.
   ``Records are moved around all the time,'' he said. And the
company is not ready to tarnish its image for such a ``two-bit
item.''
   Murray stressed that, as Mobil's top officer, he did not know
about Bowman's firing or operational details in the Bakersfield
plant. Murray noted that he is not the president of Mobil Chemical
Co., the division Bowman worked for, and so was not concerned with
such matters.
   ``I wasn't aware of Mr. Bowman at all,'' Murray said.
   But Bowman's attorney, Stephen B. Wiley, showed Murray a copy of
a letter to Murray that was marked with the chief executive
officer's ``received'' stamp. And he asked if Murray could still
say he had never heard of Bowman.
   Murray explained that he has two secretaries who handle the 100
or so pieces of mail that enter his office each day. The initials
of another Mobil executive at the top of the paper showed that his
secretary had forwarded it to someone else, Murray said.
   Regardless of who eventually received the letter, Murray said,
he interpreted the document differently than Wiley did. Instead of
withholding information from top officials to protect them from
knowing the facts, Murray said the letter indicated that results of
a plant audit would be sent to those who needed the information.
   ``I guess we just interpret this differently,'' Murray said.
``The important thing to me is that nothing is being covered up.''

<HEAD>Caterpillar Earnings Drop 50 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caterpillar Inc. reported Thursday a 50
percent drop in third-quarter profits, blaming the decline on
higher material costs and rising wage and benefit increases.
   Quarterly earnings totaled $54 million, or 54 cents a share,
compared with $108 million, or $1.07 per share in the third quarter
of 1989.
   It was the sixth consecutive quarter in which profits at the
world's leading manufacturer of earth-moving equipment were less
than the comparable period in the previous year.
   However, sales and revenue climbed 6 percent to $2.79 billion
for the three-month period ended Sept. 30, compared with $2.64
billion a year earlier.
   Len Kuchan, Caterpillar treasurer, called the profit outlook for
the remainder of 1990 gloomy despite the possibility that the
75-year-old company could eclipse its sales and revenue record of
$11.13 billion achieved last year.
   ``Our general expectation is that we would always expect to earn
a profit,'' Kuchan said. ``Based on what we see now, we will make a
profit in the fourth quarter.
   ``We're certainly not happy. With record sales we'd like to see
record profits go right along with it.''
   Kuchan blamed numerous factors for the depressed profits,
including higher material costs and wage and benefit increases for
its employees.
   The Persian Gulf crisis, which sent oil prices soaring, has also
hurt Caterpillar, Kuchan said.
   ``Higher oil prices have an impact on inflation and hold
interest rates higher than they might be otherwise,'' Kuchan said.
``We see a rough road ahead for the United States economy and the
world economy and recognize the possibility of a recession.''
   The company announced plans in August to lay off 650 workers at
its Gosselies, Belgium, facility by the end of 1991.
   But no domestic plant furloughs or layoffs are anticipated at
this time, he said.
   For the first nine months of the year, Caterpillar's profits
totaled $199 million, down from $390 million last year. Profit per
share was $1.97, compared to $3.85 for the first nine months of
1989.
   Sales and revenue for the first nine months of year totaled $8.7
billion, up from $8.4 billion last year.

<TEXT>
   Waste Management Inc. on Thursday
reported profits up 26 percent for the third quarter, as its
recycling and trash-to-energy services continue to expand.
   The waste disposal firm said its net income for the three
months, before an extraordinary charge, climbed to $190.7 million,
or 40 cents per share, compared with $151.7 million or 33 cents a
share in the same period last year.
   Sales for the three months ended Sept. 30 were up 34 percent to
$1.59 billion from $1.19 billion in the year-earlier period.
   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, revenues were up 29 percent
to $4.22 billion from $3.26 billion. Net income grew 26 percent to
$514 million or $1.09 a share from $409 million or 89 cents a share
a year earlier.
   ``Waste Management is enjoying an outstanding year, with each of
our primary business units expanding their operations and improving
their performance,'' said chairman Dean Buntrock.
   The company said it had restated its per share results for 1989
to reflect a two-for-one stock split.
   It also recorded an extraordinary charge representing the
company's share of a writedown by Wheelabrator Technologies Inc. of
Wheelabrator's investment in the stock of The Henley Group Inc. and
Henley Properties Inc. to market value. The extraordinary charge
was $24.5 million or 5 cents per share.
   The company said its stake in Wheelabrator adds to its abilities
in trash-to-energy conversion and other environmental services. It
also said its North American recycling services continue to expand,
holding recycling contracts with more than 250 communities.

   Crude oil futures prices swung wildly Thursday
before settling slightly higher as tensions rose following a report
that Israeli soldiers wounded dozens of Palestinians in clashes in
the occupied West Bank.
   Crude prices were sharply lower in the early going as the market
reacted to Wednesday's Energy Department report showing shortages
created by the Persian Gulf crisis have been largely alleviated.
   The near-term contract for light-sweet crude, the benchmark
grade of oil, initially plunged more than $2.25 a barrel on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. That extended Wednesday's $2.17-a-barrel
decline and was well off the record-high level of $41 a barrel
registered earlier this month.
   But prices reversed course following a mid-afternoon report that
an attempt by the Israeli army to establish a new post in a Gaza
strip refugee camp sparked hours of skirmishes and saw 35
Palestinians wounded by live ammunition and rubber bullets.
   The the price of light-sweet crude for November delivery settled
at $36.80 a barrel, up 8 cents on the Mercantile Exchange.The
contract had traded as high as $37.20 a barrel. Other contract
months settled lower.
   ``This just adds to the tension in the Middle East,'' Jim
Fiedler, a vice president at E.D.F. &amp; Man International Inc., said
of the Israeli report. ``The market reacted immediately to it.''
   Fiedler said the market was concerned over the Palestinians'
ability to drive a wedge into the unified front against Iraq.
Non-Arab as well as some Arab nations have harshly condemned Iraq
for its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and have been supporting a
U.S.-led embargo against Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude oil.
   Israel's killing of Palestinians at the Temple Mount holy site
earlier this month met with sharp criticism, and Fiedler suggested
any further moves by the Israelis against the Palestinians could
weaken the United States' position as a leader against the Iraqi
invasion.
   Several traders said they were exasperated with the wide swings
in crude futures prices.
   Since the Persian Gulf crisis erupted, the band in which energy
prices trade has widened considerably. As long as the crisis
remains unresolved, many analysts predict crude prices will
continue to swing between $34 and $41 a barrel.
   Higher oil prices were behind an 0.8 percent hike in the cost of
living last month, according to a Labor Department report released
Thursday. It was the second-consecutive month of bad U.S. inflation
and translates to a 9.5 percent annual rate.
   Crude prices have nearly doubled since the invasion largely on
speculation that a war would disrupt critical supplies from the
Western world's most important source of petroleum.
   The market has been influenced by war jitters for weeks on
little more than rumors, but to date there have been no hostilities
between Iraq and a U.S.-led force deployed in the Gulf.
   Some analysts also said an Iraqi offer Thursday to sell oil to
anyone for $21 a barrel may have had a minor effect on depressing
prices intially. But others dismissed the gesture as propaganda
posturing by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to gain world sympathy and
undercut the U.S.-led embargo.
   Prices for oil products declined. Home heating oil for November
delivery lost 1.74 cents to 96.51 a gallon. Several later months
posted greater losses.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for delivery in November lost .44
cent to 92.96 cents a gallon, with subsequent months dropping more
than 2 cents a gallon.
   In natural gas trading, the November contract closed at $1.890
per 1,000 cubic feet, down from $1.900 on Wednesday.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T's Profit Rises 2 Percent in Quarter, But Credit Card Drags
Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AT&amp;T said Thursday its third-quarter profit rose
almost 2 percent despite the sluggish economy, but earnings
continued to be dragged down by processing costs for the phone
company's highly popular new credit card.
   For the three months ended Sept. 30, AT&amp;T said it earned $712
million, or 65 cents a share, compared with $699 million, or 65
cents a share, in the same quarter last year. Per-share earnings
remained stable due to a higher number of outstanding shares in the
most-recent quarter.
   Revenue advanced about 5 percent to $9.36 billion from $8.9
billion in the year-ago quarter.
   American Telephone and Telegraph Co. Chairman Robert E. Allen
called the results by the nation's largest long-distance phone
company ``solid in the face of a softening economy.''
   Industry analysts generally agreed.
   Richard Toole of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. called the earnings ``flat
but good.'' Despite the economic downturn and drag from the AT&amp;T
Universal card, ``they were able to overcome that and have an
all-time record operating (profit) margin,'' he said.
   Toole credited the company's cost controls and strong
international sales of telephone equipment for the profit increase.
   Shares in AT&amp;T, the nation's most widely held stock, rose $1.12{
cents to close at $32 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Demand for the Universal card, a combination credit and calling
card introduced in March, has exceeded AT&amp;T's projections, causing
greater-than-expected processing costs, the company said.
   Toole estimated the credit card processing costs cut earnings by
5 cents a share in the quarter.
   AT&amp;T's total expenses rose 4.3 percent during the quarter,
reflecting increased marketing and advertising costs, the company
said. In addition, AT&amp;T said, earnings were reduced by 4 cents a
share due to higher income taxes resulting primarily from reduced
tax credits.
   But product sales, including telephone network products,
computers, microelectronic components and consumer products, jumped
almost 13 percent during the quarter to $3.08 billion.
   Service revenues, which include long-distance service,
installation and maintenance of equipment, and finance services,
rose 3 percent to $5.72 billion. Long-distance revenue itself grew
1.5 percent as calling volume advanced 7 percent.
   Charles Nichols, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
said the 7 percent increase in calling volume ``shows that AT&amp;T has
become more effective in stemming market-share erosion'' to MCI
Communications Corp. and U.S. Sprint.
   Toole said AT&amp;T apparently continues to lose long-distance
customers in the residential and international markets, but in the
highly profitable business market ``they're holding their own or
maybe even winning back a little.''
   AT&amp;T has about 65 percent of the overall long-distance market.
   Nichols said he was pleased by the company's earnings growth and
agreed that it was doing well in light of the economic decline. He
called the continued earnings drag from the Universal card ``a
short-term negative, long-term positive'' since the card should
increase earnings in the future.
   But Pat Jurczak, another Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst, projected
the card would continue to lose money for two years.
   ``The real concern is that we are moving into a slowing
economy,'' he said. ``They have to keep the bad debt low. They have
to make sure they have the right customers.''
   While international equipment sales were strong, AT&amp;T said sales
of communications systems to large business customers were flat and
sales to smaller businesses declined slightly.
   For the first nine months of the year AT&amp;T earned $2.04 billion,
or $1.87 a share, up 2.5 percent from $1.99 billion, or $1.85 a
share, in the same period last year.
   Revenue totaled $27.27 billion, up almost 2 percent from $26.81
billion in the year-ago period.

<TEXT>
   If Dallas-based Bonneau Co. has its way, it soon
will provide the answer to the question: ``Who's that behind those
Foster Grants?''
   Bonneau, a leader in the sunglasses business, has offered to pay
$9 million for the assets of Foster Grant, including its name and
trademark.
   Foster Grant, which rode to prominence with ads asking what star
was behind its sunglasses, sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy court
protection from creditors in August.
   The company, with sales of more than $50 million worth of
sunglasses, reading glasses and technical products last year,
blamed the bankruptcy court filing on cash flow problems and
competition from Asian imports. Court papers showed the company had
total assets of about $25 million and liabilities of about $36
million, including nearly $19.3 million in unsecured debt.
   Foster Grant, founded in 1919 by Sam Foster, was the first
company to use abrasion-resistant lens coatings that blocked the
sun's ultra-violet rays, but is best known for its advertisements.
   Bonneau's offer must be approved by a Tucson, Ariz., bankruptcy
court. A hearing is set for Oct. 25 on the proposed sale.
   ``Assuming the court accepts the deal, we will close on it a
short time later,'' said Foster Grant president William Mahoney.
   Bonneau officials said they would continue manufacturing
operations in the two Foster Grant plants in Nogales, Mexico, and
one in Leominster, Mass., and maintain its Tucson packing division.

<TEXT>
   MCA Inc. said Thursday its
third-quarter profit rose 20.8 percent, paced by gains in music,
entertainment and broadcasting earnings.
   MCA, the entertainment conglomerate that is the parent of
Universal Studios, has been in the news recently because Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co. of Japan has offered to buy all or part of
the firm.
   Revenues rose 18.7 percent, from $894.4 million to $1.061
billion. Sales in the music entertainment division climbed 64.9
percent to $347.9 million, reflecting fees earned by MCA from an
agreement to form a new record company in Japan.
   Quarterly profit was $61.4 million, or 71 cents per share,
compared with $50.8 million, or 69 cents per share, during the
third quarter of 1989.
   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, net income rose 14.7
percent, from $120.1 million, or $1.64 per share, to $137.8
million, or $1.70 per share. Revenue rose 21 percent, from $2.4
billion to $2.9 billion.
   Per-share earnings were affected because MCA had the equivalent
of about 92 million shares of common stock outstanding during the
third quarter of 1990, compared with about 73 million during the
same period of 1989. New shares were issued to purchase Geffen
Entertainment and for the $500 million conversion of convertible
subordinated debentures.
   Third-quarter operating profits in the theatrical film
entertainment division fell 6.7 percent to $81 million. Book
publishing earnings fell 54.5 percent.
   But operating earnings in the music entertainment unit soared
120.8 percent to nearly $43 million. And profits from broadcasting
and cable operations rose 152.6 percent to $12.5 million.

<HEAD>Retailer's Losses More Than Tripled in Fiscal Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Losses at R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc. more than tripled
in the company's 1990 fiscal year, a source familiar with the
national retailer said Thursday.
   The company's losses totaled $215.3 million for the year that
ended July 28, compared with a loss of $63 million the previous
year, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Sales rose 4.2 percent to $7.27 billion from $6.97 billion a
year earlier.
   The closely held company is still paying down big debts rolled
up in a 1986 management-led buyout and faces grim predictions for
the Christmas shopping season.
   Macy's earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation - the
key figure for a company trying to reduce debt from a so-called
leveraged buyout - totaled $721 million in fiscal 1990, down from
$926.1 million the year before.
   The 1990 figure fell short of the $743.2 million projection made
by Macy last spring, but the source attributed the gap to a $30
million accounting adjustment.
   Macy had been expected to post disappointing results since it
announced earlier this year that it had a disastrous 1989 Christmas
season. The results were expected to be released publicly later
this month.
   The upcoming Christmas season is expected to be sluggish for the
entire retail industry, and Macy's showing during the summer has
raised concerns among its bondholers and suppliers about how the
company will fare during the holidays.
   Macy's August sales fell 5 percent from a year earlier, the
source said.
   But Macy said it is prepared for a poor Christmas. James
Fingeroth, a Macy spokesman, noted that the retailer is carrying
$560 million less in inventory than it had a year ago, has
controlled other expenses and is ``planning for a very sluggish
environment going forward for the forseeable future.''
   Tom Razukas, an analyst with Fitch Investors Service Inc., said
the company's results do not change his assessment of the retailer
or its prospects. Macy's extremely conservative approach to this
Christmas ``is a good way to be,'' he said.
   Last week, Macy announced it was selling its credit operations
to GE Capital Corp. Macy said the move would reduce its $4.8
billion debt load by $1.5 billion.
   The company has also said it is buying back some of its bonds -
including some of its $1.6 billion in junk bonds - as another means
of lowering its debt and a $595 million annual interest bill. Macy
has sold equity stakes to help finance the buybacks.
   Besides its flagship Macy stores, located mainly in the East and
Texas, the company owns I. Magnin and Bullock's stores in
California and the West. It also owns specialty stores including
Charter Club, Morgan Taylor and Aeropostale, which are stocked with
Macy's private label apparel brands.

<HEAD>Dollar Weaker, Gold Prices Inch Upward</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished sharply weaker against most
key currencies Thursday, reflecting what money dealers called a
loss of confidence in the U.S. government's ability to adopt a
deficit-reduction package.
   Gold prices rose while silver prices were mostly unchanged.
   The dollar's decline was particularly acute against the German
mark, falling through a psychological barrier of 1.50 marks to
1.4970 in New York, down from 1.5125 Wednesday.
   ``The dollar is weakening,'' said William Sterling, an
international economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
``Foreigners are increasingly coming to believe that the U.S.
government is incapable of delivering a competent fiscal policy.''
   Traders said Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's comment earlier
this week that he wasn't ``overly concerned'' about the dollar's
decline also was considered a green light to sell dollars.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 124.40 Japanese yen from
125.80 yen at Wednesday's close and its lowest close since it
finished at 124.05 yen on Jan. 4, 1989. Later, in London, it rose
to 125.25 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at $124.40 yen, down
from $125.43 late Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.9540 from $1.9650 late
Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.9710 to buy one pound, more
expensive than Wednesday's $1.9615.
   Lamakers were working late again Thursday, mindful of President
Bush's promise to let the government shut down again Saturday -
when its authority to spend money expires - unless Congress seems
near a budget he likes.
   But traders said the prolonged political stalemate in Washington
over the deficit, considered a major drag on the U.S. economy, was
causing foreign investors to lose confidence in the dollar and in
the federal government's ability to function effectively.
   Sterling predicted the dollar would weaken further if Congress
misses the latest deadline.
   ``They ought to meet the deadline,'' Sterling said. ``If a
budget is delayed and the government has to shut down again, all of
that would leave the dollar twisting in the wind.''
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday included: 1.2590 Swiss francs, down from 1.2720; 1.1698
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1683; 5.0165 French francs, down from
5.0680; and 1,122.00 Italian lire, down from 1,132.50.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday
included: 1.5115 German marks, up from 1.5105; 1.2735 Swiss francs,
up from 1.2725; 5.0630 French francs, up from 5.0588; 1.7035 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.7015; 1,132.75 Italian lire, up from 1,130.75;
and 1.1750 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1646.
   Gold closed at $370.10 per troy ounce on the New York Commodity
Exchange, up $3.40 from Wednesday. Republic National Bank quoted a
late bid for bullion of $391, up $4.90.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $367.75 a troy ounce, up
from $366.50 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing
bid of $366.50, up from $366.20 bid late Wednesday. Earlier, in
Hong Kong, gold rose $1.77 to $369.58.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled
at $4.198 a troy ounce, unchanged from Wednesday. In London, silver
bullion fell to a late bid of $4.18 a troy ounce, down from $4.24
late Wednesday.

<HEAD>RTC Plans To Sell Off Smallest Properties Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal agency disposing of failed savings
and loans is selling its smallest properties in the next few months
in order to free employees to concentrate on the largest
properties.
   ``We're much better off administratively if we can sell them
(smaller properties) off fast and reduce the bookkeeping and number
of people needed to manage them,'' L. William Seidman, chairman of
the Resolution Trust Corp., said in a telephone interview Thursday.
   ``We want to use our people to move on big assets,'' he said.
   The RTC was created by last year's S&amp;L bailout law. By early
this month, it had taken over 492 failed thrifts with assets of
$258 billion. It has disposed of 286 of those S&amp;Ls but has had less
success in selling the assets owned by the institutions.
   In early August, Seidman announced a ``great fall inventory
clearance sale'' to move more than $50 billion in assets by the end
of the year.
   He said Thursday that effort had been set back by the
cancellation of an auction via international satellite, scheduled
for November, but that the agency still might reach its goal.
   Seidman first disclosed the RTC's strategy shift toward
disposing smaller assets in a speech Wednesday to the Washington
Analysis Corp., a subsidiary of National Westminster Bank.
   He said more than 76 percent of the 40,000 real estate parcels
in his agency's possession had values of less than $100,000.
   It also has a large number of delinquent loans wih book values
of less than $50,000 each. Most of the loans will be packaged and
sold to the highest bidder at auctions, he said.
   In the January-March quarter, the agency will conduct a series
of auctions and accept sealed bids for almost all real estate
properties valued at less than $100,000, he said. Sealed bids will
be used in a program aimed at providing homes to poor people.
   ``The faster disposition of these small assets will maximize
returns by freeing up our staff to concentrate on large sales where
the real dollars are recovered,'' Seidman said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Oct. 8, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,325.5 billion from $3,322.2 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,092.0 billion from $4,085.7 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $821.9 billion from $828.8 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The growth rate in M2 in the last 52 weeks was 4.9 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The growth rate in M3 over the past year was 1.8 percent, which is
within the Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed
has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,304.4 billion, a 3.4
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,085.8 billion, up 1.6 percent, while M1
rose 4.5 percent to an average of $816.9 billion.
   In other reports:
   - The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $377 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$399 million the previous week.
   - The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $318.4 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, up from $317.7 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Mideast News Affects Oil Futures</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   News from the Middle East incited a rebound in the oil market
Thursday, while increased export business pushed wheat prices
higher and consumer demand for beef raised cattle prices.
   November crude oil slid in early trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange to $34.40, down $2.30 a barrel, in a
follow-through from Wednesday's concern over high supplies and low
demand, traders said.
   But prices recovered on reports of renewed Mideast tension.
Eleven of 18 contract months, including November, fnished higher
for the session.
   In Lebanon, an Israeli army unit battled Shiite Moslem
guerrillas and leftist militiamen Thursday near a village believed
used as a base to attack Israel's self-declared security zone.
   ``The Israeli troop shootings today increased tension, and we
were right back from a fundamental mode to a psychological mode. It
shows how susceptible the market is to any crisis overseas,'' said
Peter Beutel, energy director for Pegasus Econmetric Group in New
Jersey.
   Mild weather on the East Coast depressed heating oil prices, he
said.
   Crude oil settled 54 cents lower to 32 cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in November at $36.80; heating oil was 1.53
cents to 4 cents lower, with November at 96.51 cents a gallon; and
unleaded gasoline was .44 cent to 2.25 cents lower, with November
at 92.96 cents a gallon.
   Precious metals futures finished higher on the Commodity
Exchange in New York.
   Gold and silver trading mirrored the crude oil market, with
prices down earlier in the day but recovering at the close.
   Gold settled $2.80 to $3.40 higher, with the contract for
October at $370.10 a troy ounce; and silver .1 cent to .2 cent
higher, with October at $4.198 a troy ounce.
   Wheat futures prices were mostly higher, but corn and soybean
prices were off on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   News that China was bidding for an additional 450,000 metric
tons of U.S. wheat supported trading.
   Traders were unimpressed with the U.S. Agriculture Department
announcement overnight that the Soviet Union had purchased 350,000
metric tons of U.S. corn.
   ``They're saying `Who cares,''' said Chicago grain analyst
Mickey Luth of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Luth also said that demand for soybeans are below what they were
a year ago.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 1{ cents higher, with the contract
for delivery in December at $2.63} cents a bushel; corn was } cent
to 1} cents lower, with December at $2.28 a bushel; oats were
unchanged to \ cent lower, with December at $1.23 a bushel; and
soybeans were 1 cent to 4{ cents lower, with November at $6.10\
bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures were stronger
and pork prices weaker.
   Paul Hare, an analyst with Linnco Futures Inc. in Chicago, said
the cattle pit has been supported by renewed packer interest in the
Southwest and Midwest cash markets.
   ``This is good news because traders have been concerned about
recessionary pressures,'' Hare said.
   Hog futures have gone the other way recently. After a supportive
hog inventory report at the last month, prices have fallen back due
to weaker product demand.
   Cattle settled .22 cent to .55 cent higher, with the contract
for delivery in October at 79.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
.15 cent lower to .48 cent higher, with October at 86.52 cents a
pound; live hogs were .18 cent lower to .15 cent higher, with
October at 57.22 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .70
cent to 1.70 cents lower, with February at 66.00 cents a pound.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Times Co. said Thursday its profit skidded 95.6
percent in the third quarter from results a year ago that were
fattened by a big onetime gain on the sale of its cable television
operations.
   But even without counting the cable sale gain in 1989, the
diversified media company said its income from continuing
operations was down 43.9 percent from a year ago because of a
decline in advertising linage at its flagship newspaper and costs
related to two new plants.
   Affiliated Publications, owner of The Boston Globe, also cited
reduced advertising revenues in reporting its earnings dropped by
more than 50 percent.
   Newspaper companies have reported generally weak earnings this
quarter as demand for ad space has shrunk in some regions as the
economy weakens.
   McClatchy Newspapers Inc., meanwhile, reported its profit was
down 14.8 percent in the third quarter from a year ago, mainly
because of the costs of recent newspaper acquisitions and startup
losses at a newsprint mill.

   The New York-based newspaper, magazine and broadcast company
said it earned $9.2 million, or 12 cents a share, for the three
months ended Sept. 30 compared with $210.8 million, or $2.68 a
share, a year earlier.
   The 1989 results included $2.47 a share for the gain on the sale
and results of NYT Cable TV, which was sold in August 1989.
   Revenue in the quarter edged up 1.3 percent to $420.7 million
from $415.3 million a year earlier.
   Income from continuing operations amounted to $9.2 million, down
from $16.4 million a year earlier.
   Operating profit in the newspaper group dropped 43.8 percent to
$19.6 million in the quarter from $34.9 million a year earlier. Ad
linage was down 10.7 percent at the New York Times, but rose 4
percent at its 35 regional newspapers.
   The operating loss in the magazine group amounted to $2.3
million in contrast to an operating loss of $4.5 million a year
earlier. Operating profit from broadcasting and information
services rose to $3.3 million in the quarter from $2.6 million a
year earlier.
   Depreciation and interest expenses on a new production center in
Edison, N.J., and a new facility for the Gwinnett (Ga.) Daily News
reduced earnings by 9 cents a share in the quarter.
   For the first nine months of the year, New York Times Co. earned
$52.6 million, or 69 cents a share, down 81.6 percent from $285.6
million, or $3.63 a share, a year ago. The 1989 results included
$2.52 a share from the cable sale and operations.
   Income from continuing opoerations fell 39.7 percent to $52.6
million from $87.2 million a year earlier.
   Revenue for the nine months rose 1.5 percent to $1.32 billion
from $1.3 billion a year earlier.

   Sacramento, Calif.-based McClatchy said it earned $7.5 million,
or 26 cents a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared
with $8.8 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier.
   The company said the decline stemmed from the costs of buying
six newspapers in South Carolina in January and losses on its
investment in a new newsprint mill, and that its profit would have
risen slightly otherwise.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 12.8 percent to $107.0 million for
the quarter led by the Sacramento and Modesto Bee newspapers from
$94.9 million a year ago.
   For the first nine months, McClatchy earned $17.7 million, or 62
cents a share, down 25 percent from $23.6 million, or 83 cents a

   Revenue rose 11 percent to $309.7 million for the nine months

<HEAD>Apple Reports 39 Percent Drop In Fourth-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc. on Thursday
reported a 39 percent drop in earnings for the quarter that ended
Sept. 28.
   The computer maker attributed most of the decline to last year's
sale of stock in Adobe Systems Inc., which produced abnormal gains
of about $48 million.
   Apple said 1990 fourth fiscal quarter net income was $98.5
million, or 81 cents per share, on net revenues of $1.354 billion.
In the same period last year, earnings were $161.1 million, or
$1.24 per share, on net revenues of $1.384 billion.
   The results also reflected the slowing economy, cuts in prices
on some products and the long-expected but just-announced switch to
lower-cost Macntoshes, said Apple spokesman Christopher Escher.
   After several years of rapid growth, Apple's sales have slowed
recently, with critics blaming the company's woes on the high price
tag for the Macintosh computer.
   But earlier this week, the company introduced three new
Macintoshes that cost less than comparable models in the current
line. The least expensive, the Macintosh Classic, has a suggested
retail price of $999 - the first time Apple has produced a computer
to sell for less than $1,000.
   ``Because of our strategy to reach many more people with
Macintosh personal computers, we are confident about our company's
prospects in fiscal 1991,'' John Sculley, Apple's chairman and
chief executive officer, said in a statement.
   ``As a result (of the new computers) we enter this new fiscal
year in a much stronger competitive position and better poised for
growth,'' he said.
   Net income for the year was $474.9 million, compared with $454
million for fiscal 1989. Per-share net income for the year was
$3.77, up from $3.53.
   For the year, net revenues rose 5 percent, from $5.284 billion
to $5.558 billion.
   ``While we experienced significant revenue and unit growth in
our Apple Macintosh computer modular products during fiscal 1990,
sales of some of our more established products declined,'' Sculley
said.

   Marion Merrell Dow, which was created in December 1989 with the
merger of Marion Laboratories Inc. and Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals
Inc., said its $625 million in sales were spurred by a strong
performance of its cardiovascular drugs.
   Because the Kansas City, Mo.-based company is in its first full
year of operation, no comparable financial figures from 1989 were
available.
   In the third quarter of 1989, Marion Laboratories reported a net
loss of $101 million, or 67 cents per share, on sales of $237
million. Those results were blamed on costs related to the
settlement of stock appreciation rights.
   Nine-month results of Marion Labs through September 1989 showed
a net income of $25 million, or 16 cents a share, on sales of $741
million.
   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, the company reported
earnings of $375 million, or $1.33 per share, on sales of $1.8
billion.
   Sales for the company's Cardizem cardiovascular drugs - used to
treat angina and high blood pressure - rose by 8 percent for the
third quarter and by 16 percent for the first nine months of the
year.
   The company's Seldane line of anti-allergy products also showed
a 23 percent sales increase in the third quarter and a 28 percent
increase so far this year.

   Madison, N.J.-based Schering-Plough credited a 24 percent rise
in sales by its worldwide businesses for part of the earnings
increase.
   Net income for the third quarter increased to $140 million, or
62 cents per share, compared with earnings of $114 million, or 51
cents per share, at this time last year.
   Sales increased 7 percent in the third quarter to $793.8 million
compared with $743.7 million in the same period in 1989.
   Third-quarter sales were reduced by the July 1990 sale of its
Maybelline cosmetics business to a New York-based investment firm,
said spokesman Linn Weiss.
   A pre-tax gain of $150 million from that sale was offset by the
discontinuance of an anti-hypertensive drug, ongoing actions to

<HEAD>City Agrees To Phase Out Use Of Deadly Acid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mobil Oil Corp. agreed Thursday to a
seven-year phase-out of deadly hydrogen flouride at its refinery
here and to submit to review by an independent safety advisor.
   The agreement settles a lawsuit by the City of Torrance alleging
that use of the toxic, cloud-forming acid endangered thousands of
residents living nearby in the Los Angeles coastal suburb. The case
was scheduled to go to trial Nov. 5.
   City officials called the agreement a landmark settlement, but
warned that they expect a continuing battle over safety at the
refinery.
   A trial would have ``shown the world how dangerous (hydrogen
flouride) is and how poorly managed the plant was operated,'' said
Councilman Dan Walker. ``I think we're going to have to fight every
inch of the way to meet the goals of the settlement.''
   The lawsuit, filed early this year, stems from a November 1987
explosion and fire that ignited when hydrogen flouride overflowed
into a tank and mixed with another chemical.
   The blast caused some $17 million in damage and left four
workers and six bystanders injured.
   Used to manufacture high-octane gasolines, hydrogen flouride
forms a heavy cloud when exposed to open air. City officials feared
an accident or leak at the refinery could send such a cloud
drifting into residential neighborhoods.
   Under the agreement, Mobil would be allowed to develop and use a
derivative of hydrogen flouride that would not form a cloud.
   Refinery Manager Joel Maness said he expected the settlement to
end several years of acrimony between the city and Mobil. He said
he had no concern about permitting an outside inspector to review
the plant's operations.
   ``We feel strongly that we have a safe operation,'' Maness said.
``But I never mind having another set of eyes take a look at our
operations and our procedures.''
   The inspector, who will advise the plant on safety
considerations, will be chosen by joint agreement between Mobil nd
the city and bill be paid by the company, court documents said.
   The advisor will report to retired Superior Court Judge Harry V.
Peetris, who will act as an arbitrator of future disputes over the
phase-out program. Peetris also will be paid by Mobil.
