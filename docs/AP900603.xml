<HEAD>Proposed Techs' Contract Goes to Union Vote</HEAD>

   Communications workers at The Associated Press
will vote on a tentative contract agreement that management called
fair but union leaders said is inadequate.
   The AP announced Saturday that it and Local 1314 of the
Communication Workers of America had reached a tentative agreement
on a contract calling for a ``managed care'' approach to control the
cost of the medical plan.
   The agreement also calls for a $23.50 weekly increase in
top-scale technician salaries in the first year and a $24 weekly
boost in the second, raising the top-scale technician salary to $612
in 1991. Similar percentage increases were proposed for all other
job classifications.
   ``The economic package is fair and the proposals are
reasonable,'' D. Byron Yake, AP's director of human resources, said
Sunday.
   Yake said he thought the union membership would approve the pact
``when they hear details of the package.''
   Leaders of the CWA local agreed to submit the proposed contract
to their 300 members for a vote but said they would recommend that
it be rejected.
   Jim Peecook, president of the union local, said the health plan
proposals represented ``a severe loss to those employees and their
families.'' He also said the proposed increase in pension benefits
was inadequate.
   ``Since they feel that it's a fair, generous and equitable
solution and we do not, we're going to go through the democratic
process,'' Peecook said. ``We'll be putting out a full description
of the changes along with a recommendation to reject the proposals.''
   Terms of the present contract were extended until July 2 pending
the vote, the AP said.

   State police said they arrested three
youths Saturday who were believed responsible for throwing rocks and
bricks from the shoulder of an interstate last weekend, critically
injuring a 15-year-old girl.
   John Burgess, 18, of Forest Heights and Maurice Ford, 18, of this
District of Columbia suburb were arrested with a 17-year-old boy
after the incident early last Sunday, police said.
   Seven people were injured by the bricks and rocks, some weighing
up to 10 pounds, that were hurled from a shoulder of the Capital
Beltway. The beltway passes through both Maryland and Virginia
suburbs of the nation's capital.
   Among the victims was a 15-year-old Hagerstown, Md., girl, who
remained in critical condition at Maryland Hospital Center on
Saturday night. She was riding in one of the vehicles when a rock
crashed through the windshield.
   Between 25 and 30 vehicles were struck by the objects.
   Maryland State Police spokesman Chuck Jackson said the two
18-year-olds were each charged with assault with intent to murder
and malicious destruction of property. He said charges against the
juvenile had yet to be determined.
   Investigators were not sure of a motive, but state police Capt.
John Hughes said the incident likely was a ``spur of the moment type
of thing.''
   The two 18-year-olds graduated Friday from Oxon High School.

   Two masked men fatally stabbed a U.S.
Navy lieutenant in his home near the Subic Bay Naval Base in an
apparent robbery, police said Sunday.
   U.S. officials ordered all personnel restricted to the naval base
immediately following the Saturday night attack, but lifted the
restrictions Sunday after determining the killing was not
politically motivated.
   Police identified the stabbing victim as Lt. Richard Brown, 33,
who was assigned to the Navy Supply Depot at the base. No home town
was given for the victim.
   Meanwhile, hundreds of Filipino troops drove through
Communist-held neighborhoods in the city of Angeles near the
U.S.-run Clark Air Base Saturday in a show of force after U.S.
troops were restricted to the garrison for security reasons.
   The Philippine military also warned foreign aid workers to watch
for terrorism. Five days ago, guerrillas suspected of belonging to
the New People's Army kidnapped a Japanese development official on
the central island of Negros.
   The provincial governor of Negros Occidental province on Sunday
threatened military action to free the Japanese aid worker unless
his abductors make contact with authorities soon.
   Security has been stepped up around Subic, Clark and four other
U.S. bases following the killing of three American servicemen in the
past month.
   In Olongapo, the base town near Subic, police said Brown was
having a manicure in his apartment when the two assailants forced
their way in around 10:45 p.m. Saturday.
   The assailants, whose faces were covered with T-shirts, locked up
the three Filipino women beauticians in a room, threatening to kill
them if they resisted, police said.
   Police said the suspects fled after ransacking the apartment. The
women managed to free themselves and found Brown's bloody body in
the dining room, police said. It was not known how much money or
property was stolen.
   Suspected Communist rebels killed Marine Gunnery Sgt. John
Fredette on May 4 in Olongapo, 50 miles west of Manila. On May 13,
two U.S. airmen were slain near Clark.
   The Marxist New People's Army claimed responsibility for killing
the airmen but has issued no statement on the Fredette slaying.
   In Angeles, 50 miles north of Manila, 500 troops and police
backed by armored personnel carriers motored through the streets
brandishing M-16 rifles and carrying banners denouncing the
Communist rebels. The motorcade passed before Clark.
   Philippine police Lt. Col. Julius Yarcia announced the formation
of neighborhood vigilante groups to help fight the rebels.
   ``We just want to convince the people that we are willing to
fight and that we have the manpower and the firepower to fight the
enemy,'' Yarcia said.
   The New People's Army, the military wing of the outlawed
Communist Party of the Philippines, has waged a 21-year-old
insurgency to establish a Marxist state.
   On Friday, U.S. officials announced renewed restrictions on the
20,300 troops, Defense Department civilians and military dependents
at Clark, largest of the six U.S. bases in the Philippines.
   Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Ron Rand said military personnel
living there were restricted to base and that those living off-post
were told to confine travel to ``essential'' business.
   In a statement broadcast Saturday by the U.S. military's Far East
Network, Rand said there had been no incidents involving Americans
but the restrictions were ordered because of ``current threat
conditions.''
   He said security patrols around the sprawling base have been
doubled to protect American lives.
   Because of the restrictions at Clark, the number of personnel
taking part in Cope Thunder, a two-week Air Force training exercise
scheduled to begin Monday, has been cut by 10 to 20 percent, said an
Air Force spokesman in Hawaii.
   ``I want to make it clear that we are not scaling back the
exercise because of any terroristic activities,'' said Maj. James
Pasierb, public affairs officer at Pacific Air Forces headquarters
at Hickam Air Force Base.
   Philippine intelligence sources said on condition of anonymity
that rebel troop movements Friday prompted the restrictions on Clark
personnel. Angeles has been a Communist stronghold since the 1940s.
   Yarcia said that in addition to the civilian vigilantes, two
companies of troops from the elite Philippine Constabulary Regional
Special Action Force would be sent to Angeles to augment the three
battalions stationed in the city.
   U.S. officials had imposed restrictions after rebels killed U.S.
Airmen John Raven and James Green, but relaxed them 12 days later on
May 25. The two were slain outside a hotel in Angeles a day before
U.S. and Philippine officials began talks on a new lease for the
U.S. bases.
   Communist rebels oppose an extension of the lease, which expires
next year. More talks between Philippine and U.S. negotiators are
expected by July.
   Eight Americans have been slain in politically motivated violence
since April 1989.
   In Bacolod, 300 miles south of Manila, Brig. Gen. Raymundo Jarque
said Saturday that rebels might target foreign government and
private relief workers throughout the Philippines to discourage
foreign assistance.
   Last Tuesday, suspected rebels abducted Fumio Mizuno, 36,
training director of Japan's Organization for Industrial, Spiritual
and Cultural Advancement, at a silkworm farm near Bacolod.
   ``The reason for the abduction of Mizuno was to stop foreign aid
in the province,'' Jarque said. Military sources said they believed
Mizuno was alive but they had received no message from his abductors.

   Truckloads of soldiers roared through Tiananmen
Square on Sunday in a show of force to head off any demonstrations
marking last year's June 3-4 army attack on student pro-democracy
protesters.
   Despite heavy security at the square and elsewhere in Beijing, a
man tried to unfurl a protest poster near Tiananmen but police
immediately dragged him off, witnesses said.
   In a park in western Beijing, police broke up a crowd of about 40
Chinese at the English Corner, a place where people studying English
gather each Sunday morning to practice. The police took five people
away for questioning.
   Authorities ordered the corner closed down in October but English
aficionados have continued to gather weekly with only token efforts
by police to shoo them away.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. and Italian embassies Sunday denied Italian
news reports that China's leading dissident, astrophysicist Fang
Lizhi, and his wife, Li Shuxiasn would be allowed to leave their
shelter in the U.S. Embassy and travel to Italy.
   ``Any rumor concerning Fang, there's nothing to them,'' said U.S.
Embassy press officer Sheridan W. Bell. ``There's nothing going on.''
   The couple sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy last June shortly
after the military suppression of the pro-democracy movement, and
are wanted by Chinese police on charges of counterrevolutionary
activities.
   On Saturday, sources in Shanghai said Wang Ruowang, a leading
71-year-old writer who participated in last year's protests, was
arrested in September. He has not been seen in public since last
summer.
   In Beijing, one student was seen Saturday wearing a T-shirt
emblazoned with the pro-democracy movement's V-for-victory symbol.
But there were no other signs outwardly marking the anniversary that
day.
   ``The Chinese are very practical. They're not going to do
anything that clearly will fail,'' said a student at Beijing Normal
University, which was one of the protest centers.
   Security guards patrolled Beijing campuses, and armed sentries
were posted at a major intersection next to the main foreign
residential compound in Beijing on Saturday.
   The government warned foreign radio stations against broadcasting
a taped program made by exiled Chinese dissidents. The dissidents
had planned to broadcast from a ship off China's coast, but they
abandoned the project when Taiwan refused to allow the ship to load
its transmitter and Japan wouldn't allow the boat into Japanese
ports.
   The protester Sunday approached Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
journalists as they stood beneath Tiananmen Gate just north of the
square, where the protesters had their headquarters last year. The
man wore ordinary workers' clothes and appeared to be in his 50s,
the journalists said.
   He unrolled a yellow poster for the journalists to see. But they
were able to read only the opening words: ``To all foreign
journalists: we have invented a new philosophy ...'' when police
grabbed him and the poster, the reporters said.
   ``Rise up!'' the man shouted to bystanders as police hauled him
into one of their many posts on the edge of the vast square.
   Twelve trucks of soldiers, each holding about 40, drove through
the square in the early morning in a show of force.
   More than 100 soldiers practiced drills with riot sticks,
truncheons and shields in front of the history museum on one side of
the square, where soldiers have been quartered since May 1989.
   The square, where last year's protesters had their headquarters,
was was closed to the public, but dozens of official buses, vans and
cars were parked on it.
   Security around the square was unusually tight, with dozens of
police vehicles parked on the edges and paramilitary police
patrolling in pairs. A shiny new water cannon was parked on one side.
   On Saturday, authorities turned the square into a carnival ground
for selected grammar school children.
   Elsewhere in the city, convoys of police vehicles with lights
flashing drove through the city early Sunday.
   Tiananmen still bears the scars of tank treads from the night of
June 3-4, 1989, when soldiers retook it from protesters demanding
democratic reform. Hundreds and possibly thousands of people were
killed by soldiers as they marched into the city on their way to the
square.
   Some underground activists said they wanted to make a
commemorative gesture on the square Sunday or Monday, but that it
would be too dangerous.
   On at least one Beijing campus, teachers were assigned to make
bed checks in student dormitories. At Beijing University and other
schools, official dance parties were scheduled through the weekend
to distract students.
   On Sunday, authorities planned a ceremony in the square to
commemorate the 1840 Opium War against Britain, which official
histories describe as an example of foreign imperialist aggression
against China. The war was triggered by British trade in opium
bought in India and sold in China, where it became a major social
problem.
   On Monday, 2,000 taxis were to gather in the square to practice
safe driving.
   Police have reported stepped-up arrests of vagrants and common
criminals in Beijing and Shanghai in the past week, apparently part
of the effort to keep order during the weekend.
   The only three political activists who have continued to openly
criticize the government dropped out of sight Thursday and were
believed in police custody. They had planned to release an open
letter to the government calling for the release of last year's
protesters. Hundreds remain jailed.
   The sources in Shanghai said Wang _ a prominent writer who
marched along with student protesters in that city last spring _ was
taken into police custody Sept. 8 after having been held under house
arrest for two months.
   Wang's family has not been allowed to communicate with him, and
he has not been formally charged, the sources said on condition of
anonymity. Police said he was being investigated for alleged acts of
counterrevolutionary incitement.

   Negotiations overseen by a
government mediator failed Saturday to end a week-old strike by
independent truckers in British Columbia who have blocked U.S.
border points.
   Meanwhile, worried shoppers stockpiled food because they feared
the strike, which began last Sunday, will soon leave supermarket
shelves bare.
   Some grocery shelves were emptied by panic buying.
   Provincial Solicitor General Russ Fraser on Friday appointed
Brian Williams to mediate the bitter rate dispute between the
truckers and the hauling industry.
   Williams met for six hours Saturday with trucking companies, the
Western Owner Operators Association representing the independents,
and the Teamsters Union, which speaks for union drivers.
   The talks failed to produce an agreement, but were scheduled to
resume Sunday, Williams said.
   Fraser vowed on Friday that the border blockades would come down,
but they remained in place Saturday, snarling traffic. Customs
officials at border points said police were monitoring the situation
but not interfering with the blockade.
   The striking independent truckers have blockaded the
U.S.-Canadian border in British Columbia with their rigs, persuading
or forcing American truckers to turn their vehicles around or park
them.
   ``This is a major inconvenience to the public,'' Fraser said.
   Buses and cars were getting through, and so were trucks carrying
medical supplies and mail, but everything else was being turned back.
   Some store owners said worried customers bought more food than
usual because of the strike.
   ``Some people are stockpiling,'' said Ken Fowler, the manager of
Thrifty Foods Fairfield store in Victoria. ``Business is up 10 per
cent.''
   Some items, including bananas and other imported produce,
disappeared fast, he said.
   ``The big crunch will hit us next week,'' Fowler said, adding
that 90 per cent of deliveries weren't getting through to his store.
He said his chain is looking for an alternative delivery system.
   Sixty Overwaitea and Save-On-Foods stores were running low on
stock last week, but spokesman Peter Walton said other delivery
arrangements were being made.
   Cargo is also piling up at Vancouver-area docks.
   ``The impact is just starting,'' said Wayne Stoilen,
vice-president of Canadian Stevedoring Co. ``We believe it will
build up quite fast.''
   The 3,000 independent truckers in British Columbia are hired by
trucking companies that also run their own vehicles with union
drivers.
   The independents, who pay their own running costs and maintain
their vehicles, are paid between $22 and $30 an hour. They say
they'll stay parked until their demand for $34 an hour is met.
   The independents are responsible for moving 25 per cent of the
truck freight in British Columbia, but have also won support from
unionized drivers. Since last Sunday, they have blockaded all border
crossings, the Trans-Canada Highway at Yale, near Hope, and Highway
97 near Penticton.
   In an unusual twist, residents of Point Roberts, Wash., might
soon have to head to Canada to buy gasoline and milk. At least one
gasoline station in Point Roberts closed Saturday because it was out
of gasoline. Operators of several others said they were close to
running out.
   Point Roberts is reachable by land only through British Columbia
and all deliveries of goods must travel through the province to
reach the small community.
   Service stations in Point Roberts said they were running out of
gasoline Saturday, and only one store had any milk left. Normally,
the town is a popular spot for British Columbia residents to buy
cheap U.S. groceries and gas.

<HEAD>Roh Leaves For Talks With Gorbachev</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo left
for San Francisco Sunday, saying that his talks with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev would open a new era in relations between the two
once hostile nations.
   Roh is scheduled to meet Gorbachev in San Francisco on Monday
after the Soviet president ends his summit talks with President
Bush. Roh plans to leave for Washington on Tuesday to talk with Bush.
   In San Francisco, Mayor Art Agnos declared Sunday ``Roh Tae-woo
Day'' in honor of the South Korean president. Agnos planned to
present Roh with the key to the city upon his arrival at San
Francisco International Airport Sunday morning.
   The Roh-Gorbachev meeting would be the first formal talks between
the countries' leaders since the Republic of Korea was formed 45
years ago. The Soviet Union is an ally of South Korea's arch foe,
communist North Korea. ``Our summit meeting will be an unusual one
since our two countries have no diplomatic relations,'' Roh said
during a brief departure ceremony at Seoul Airport.
   ``Accordingly, this is expected to open a new era in our
relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,'' he said.
   During his talks with Gorbachev, Roh said he would focus on
bilateral issues, emphasizing the normalization of relations and
measures to promote peace and unification of the divided Korean
peninsula.
   ``I intend to exchange with President Gorbachev extensive views
on how to spread to Northeast Asia, especially to the Korean
peninsula, the waves of openness and cooperation now sweeping the
world,'' he said.
   North Korean officials have denounced the planned Roh-Gorbachev
meeting. North Korean President Kim Il-sung has refused to recognize
the Seoul government.
   South Korean officials said the unprecedented talks could lead to
an early normalization of relations between Seoul and Moscow and
accelerate trade and economic cooperation between the two countries.
   The Soviet Union, which supported North Korea in the 1950-53
Korean War, has greatly expanded economic and other unofficial
contacts with South Korea in recent years, especially after the 1988
Summer Olympics in Seoul.
   Their bilateral trade increased 10 times from 1985 to total $600
million last year and is expected to top $1 billion this year. They
exchanged trade offices and opened limited consular relations last
year.
   Observers here believe that the Roh-Gorbachev talks reflect
Seoul's wish for normalized relations with the Soviet Union and
Moscow's desire to induce more South Korean investment to help ease
its economic problems.
   The talks represent a success for South Korea's policy of seeking
improved ties with Communist nations which can exert influence on
North Korea and help reduce tension on the Korean peninsula.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the Communist North and
capitalist South in 1945. The two Koreas have held talks on and off
since the early 1970's but little progress has been made.
   Since 1988, South Korea has opened relations with all Eastern
European nations except East Germany and Albania. South Korean
officials said they are negotiating to establish ties with East
Germany.
   Seoul officials believe that improved ties with the Soviet Union
would also stimulate China, a close ally of North Korea, to
establish diplomatic relations with South Korea.

   A state of emergency was declared in
Indiana in the trail of twisters that killed at least nine people,
injured more than 100 and littered the Midwest with debris,
authorities said.
   At least 130 people were injured Saturday night in Indiana in
about four tornadoes that touched down 50 times or more in the state.
   Eight people were reported killed in Indiana and one person was
left dead in Illinois, officials said. A few of the injuries in
Indiana were critical, state officials said.
   Elsewhere, twisters or tornado-force winds downed trees, knocked
out power and damaged homes and businesses in Kansas, Kentucky,
Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin.
   Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh sent the state's National Guard to Bedford
and Petersburg, the two hardest hit areas in southern Indiana.
   The Indiana National Guard dispatched medical workers, engineers
and ambulances to the region, where state police set up a temporary
command post to assist injured and homeless residents.
   A temporary morgue was set up at a fire station in Petersburg, a
city of 4,000 people about 40 miles north of Evansville.
   ``It's like a war zone,'' said Ed Thurman of nearby Vincennes,
who walked through Petersburg early today to view damage.
   ``Half of the town was destroyed,'' Thurman said. ``Homes,
businesses, an elementary school. It went right down the main
street. The mayor's house was demolished.''
   Temporary shelters in churches quickly filled up in Petersburg,
where flooding two weeks ago chased people from their homes, Thurman
said.
   Randy Harris of radio station WFPC in Petersburg said he was home
when disaster struck.
   ``It was just a very strong roar, almost like a low-flying jet,''
he said.
   Phil Roberts, deputy director of the Indiana Department of
Emergency Management, said eight people were confirmed killed in
Indiana _ four in Petersburg, two in nearby Union, one in Bedford,
which is 70 miles south of Indianapolis, and one in Putnam County.
   Jerry Hauer, director of the state emergency management agency,
initially had reported three people were killed in Bedford, but
Roberts said early today that figure was based on reports from local
authorities who later changed their count.
   One woman was killed in Putnam County when her mobile home
overturned, said Hendricks County sheriff's Lt. Steve Golden.
Details on the other deaths in Indiana remained sketchy early today.
   The tornadoes were deemed the most destructive to hit Indiana
since 1974, when about a dozen twisters touched down, Hauer said.
   A woman in the small, southeastern Illinois town of Browns was
killed and at least eight people in nearby Findlay and Newton were
injured by tornadoes, officials said.
   Electricity and gas service was turned off in Findlay, where
about 800 people live, for fear of leaks. Eleven homes were
destroyed and 25 others were damaged in the area.
   Hospitals around the Bedford and Petersburg areas treated many of
the Indiana injured, Roberts said. Utility service was knocked out
in those areas. Mike Garvey, a medical specialist for the Indiana
emergency management agency, said at least 75 people were injured in
the Bedford and Petersburg areas. Fewer than ten were critically
injured, he said.
   Among the injured were 27 people in a Bedford restaurant that was
destroyed, Roberts said. A service station and convenience store
were destroyed south of Bedford, witnesses said.
   Indiana State Police in Lafayette reported extensive damage in
Montgomery County about 25 miles northwest of Indianapolis. At least
two tornadoes touched down in that region.
   ``Some houses are reported gone,'' state police Cpl. Dave Murray
said of Montgomery County.
   Elsewhere:
   _In Wisconsin, several thousand residents of Fond du Lac, an
eastern Wisconsin city of 36,000, were temporarily without electric
service as tree limbs tore down transmission lines. No serious
injuries were reported.
   _In Minnesota, thunderstorms with wind gusts up to 70 mph and
hail moved across southeastern and east-central parts of the state.
A tornado damaged four farms Saturday one mile east of Goodhue in
southeastern Minnesota, but no injuries were reported, authorities
said.
   _ In Ohio, a tornado damaged several homes and destroyed a
restaurant in Harrison, outside Cincinnati, the National Weather
Service said. No serious injuries were reported.
   _ In Kentucky, a tornado overturned a house trailer and damaged
three others in the town of West Liberty, and two possible tornadoes
were reported elsewhere in the state, said police and the weather
service. No injuries were immediately reported.
   _ In Michigan, a tornado touched down in Big Praire Township,
damaging some of the many vacation trailers in an area where many
retirees live, said Newago County sheriff's dispatcher Bob Bain. No
injuries were reported and the extent of the damage was not
immediately known, he said.
   _ In Kansas, winds that reached 70 mph tore roofs from homes
throughout the city of Hutchinson. Downed power lines knocked out
power to nearly 50,000 homes and sparked grass fires.

   President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev wrap up their four-day summit on Sunday still divided over
the future of Germany and Lithuania, but saying their warm
relationship will help them deal with the world's problems.
   ``There is ample opportunity for cooperation, even though there
are real problems that neither the president nor I can turn a blind
eye to,'' Gorbachev said Saturday after a day of relaxed
conversation at Camp David.
   ``I set high store by the personal relationship that the
president and I have established _ the personal rapport between
us,'' he said.
   Bush, standing at Gorbachev's side before the two boarded a
helicopter for the short ride back to Washington, said his view of
the talks and his guest's were ``in close parallel.''
   ``Some will argue that we haven't solved all the problems,'' he
said. ``To me, that's not the point. The point is, we have an awful
lot of common ground.''
   Gorbachev said he and Bush had discussed the contentious issue of
German unification and would talk more about it at their joint news
conference Sunday prior to his departure for Minneapolis and San
Francisco.
   Before the televised news conference in the White House East
Room, Bush and his wife, Barbara, attended an early-morning
communion service at St. John's Episcopal Church across Lafayette
Square from the White House. Bush worships regularly at St. John's,
the historic ``Church of the Presidents,'' when he is not spending
weekends at Camp David.
   As he returned to the White House, Bush was asked if things had
gone well in his Camp David discussions with Gorbachev. ``It was a
good day, yeah,'' the president replied.
   The Soviet leader, concerned about the military strength of a
united Germany, has opposed Bush's demand that the new nation be a
full member of NATO. The issue was discussed extensively on the
first summit day Thursday, but was set aside so the leaders could
focus on other matters.
   There were hints of a Bush visit to Moscow as part of an
agreement for regular meetings. ``There has been some discussion of
visits back and forth,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said. ``I think perhaps they'll have something to say at their press
conference.''
   Taking a break around lunchtime, Gorbachev and his wife took
advantage of the brilliant weather to stroll around the mountaintop
compound and stopped to pitch horseshoes _ one of Bush's favorite
pastimes. Bush complained jokingly that although Gorbachev had never
thrown horseshoes before, he managed to score a ``ringer'' by
hooking one on a metal stake on his first try.
   ``Well, I couldn't give in after all,'' Gorbachev replied.
   At dinner, Bush said, Gorbachev explained ``that a horseshoe in
the Soviet Union, when posted in one's house, symbolizes warmth and
friendship. That made an impression on me.''
   Saturday's agenda focused mostly on regional issues, including
Nicaragua, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Cuba, El Salvador, India, Pakistan
and the Middle East, spokesmen said.
   As Bush and Gorbachev ended their talks, the two sides issued a
statement promising to work together to fight starvation in
Ethiopia. They agreed to send food from the United States and have
it delivered to Ethiopia on Soviet aircraft.
   Although the leaders did not dwell on the question of Soviet
pressure on Lithuania, Fitzwater linked Moscow's conduct with the
granting of U.S. trade benefits for the Soviet Union.
   He said ``it will be difficult'' to win Senate approval of a
trade agreement announced by the leaders Friday _ along with two
agreements on slashing long-range nuclear weapons and stocks of
deadly gas canisters _ ``because the United States feels very
strongly about Lithuania.''
   In addition, Fitzwater said, ``This agreement is not going to the
Congress until an emigration law is passed'' in the Soviet Union
protecting free emigration.

   In a signal of growing U.S. business interest in the Soviet
Union, Chevron Corp. on Saturday announced an agreement for
exploration and development of the Soviets' large, newly discovered
oil field near the Caspian Sea. The field's estimated oil reserves
are more than double those of the Alaska North Slope.
   Soviet and American officials said the Chevron deal was an
example of the commercial contacts that would flourish under the
trade agreement which Bush and Gorbachev signed on Friday.

   A British tour bus burst a tire, swerved
into a roadside ditch and overturned Sunday morning, killing at
least 11 people and leaving another 61 injured, police reported.
   An earlier, erroneous police report said 12 died, but the
region's under-prefect, Jean-Yves Caullet, said ``one body was
counted twice.''
   At least 22 of the injured people were reported in serious
condition. They were taken to hospitals near the crash site, 100
miles south of Paris.
   Rescue workers used five cranes to gently lift the crushed
double-decker bus to extract survivors, police said. All the
survivors were pulled out of the wreckage by noon, almost four hours
after the accident, according to police.
   The bus was traveling north at high speed about 8 a.m. near the
village of Courtenay when a tire burst and the driver lost control,
police said.
   The bus veered into a roadside ditch, flipped over on its side
and was crushed by the impact, police said. No other vehicles were
involved in the accident and the bus did not catch fire.
   The British Foreign Office said the bus came from Leek, in
Staffordshire, central England. Police said most of the passengers
were British.
   British diplomats from Paris and the French Secretary of State
for Transport, Georges Sarre, traveled to the scene.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. reported that the bus was
traveling on the main north-south highway toward the English
Channel, taking holidaymakers home from the southern city of Nimes,
where a series of bullfights and religious festivities related to
the Pentecost were held this weekend.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned
Israel on Sunday he would consider suspending the issuance of exit
permits for Soviet Jews if they continue to be settled on the West
Bank or in Gaza.
   President Bush joined Gorbachev at a news conference winding up
their four-day summit with a reiteration of U.S. opposition to
further settlements on the lands captured from the Arabs in the 1967
Mideast War.
   ``I will try to persuade the government of Israel that it is
counterproductive,'' Bush said.
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union is at an all-time high.
Some 20,000 exit permits were issued last month. About 70,000 Soviet
Jews are expected to enter the United States this year. Most of the
others elect to go to Israel, where according to Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir only about 1 percent settle on the West Bank and in
Gaza.
   If East Jerusalem is included as occupied territory _ as Bush
insists it should be _ the percentage rises to about 10 percent.
   Gorbachev, responding to a question, said the Soviet Union ``is
being bombarded by a lot of criticism`` from Arab countries. He said
Presidents Hafez Assad of Syria and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt had
raised their objections ``in acute terms.''
   He said if Israel did not heed appeals to keep Jews from the
territories, ``we must give further thought to it in terms of what
we can do with issuing permits for exit ... postpone issuing permits
for exit.''
   The Soviet leader did not make clear if the objections registered
with him by Arab governments applied only to Jews going to the West
Bank and Gaza or to their emigration to any part of Israel.
   The influx of Soviet Jews has been an unexpected boon to the
Jewish state as it seeks to maintain a sizable population in a
largely hostile Arab world.
   On a related front, Bush defended the U.S. decision to block a
drive in the United Nations for sending permanent observers to the
area to monitor the situation under the supervision of the U.N.
Security Council.
   He said the U.S. preference was an inspection visit by a deputy
of Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Bush sharply condemned last week's guerrilla attack on Israel.
``It is unacceptable,'' he said.
   Turning to the settlements issue, though, he said: ``U.S. policy
is unchanged and clear. We oppose new settlements in territories
beyond the 1967 lines.''
   Some 70,000 Jews have settled on the West Bank and in Gaza since
the territories were surrendered by Jordan and Egypt.
   U.S. policy seeks a withdrawal by Israel, without specifying if
all the land should be relinquished in exchange for recognition by
the Arabs.
   Egypt in 1979 signed a peace treaty with Israel and reacquired
all the land in Sinai it had lost in the 1967 war.

<TEXT>
   A young man drafted into the police force
was beaten to death and authorities suspended six officers pending
an investigation, police sources said Sunday.
   Attorney General Abdel-Aziz Mokhtar will lead the investigation
into the death of 22-year-old Sultan Abdel-Hamid in Assiut, 230
miles south of the capital, Cairo, the sources said.
   Abdel-Hamid was severely beaten on his arms and legs and died in
a hospital, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymnity.
They did not specify when the incident took place or when the three
police officers and three sergeants were suspended.
   All men between 18 and 35 are required to serve in the Central
Security police. University graduates spend one year while
non-university graduates spend up to three years.
   The conscripts are usually based in ill-equipped camps in the
desert and sometimes badly treated. In 1986, thousands rampaged near
the Giza pyramids, burning hotels and cars in protest of a rumor
that the government had extended their conscription periods.

   Italians began voting Sunday in a two-day referendum
on restricting hunting and the use of pesticides.
   If approved, the measures would cancel laws or regulations on
hunting and pesticides, forcing Parliament to enact stricter
legislation.
   About 46.8 million people were eligible to vote in the election,
which was scheduled to end Monday afternoon.
   More than half the eligible voters must cast ballots for the
referendum to be considered valid.

<HEAD>Jail Crowding Worsens as New Inmates Outstrip Construction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Overcrowding in the nation's jails worsened
between 1988 and 1989 as construction of new cells failed to keep
pace with a 15 percent jump in the number of prisoners, the Justice
Department said Sunday.
   The capacity of local jails expanded 8 percent between the middle
of 1988 and midyear 1989, according to the study by the department's
Bureau of Justice Statistics.
   On June 30, 1989, there were 395,553 prisoners held in jails
operated by local governments designed to hold 367,769 people, the
study said. That marked a 15 percent increase from the 343,569
prisoners in custody on the same day in 1988, when the jails had a
rated capacity of 339,633.
   The average daily population of the nation's local jails for the
12 months ending June 30, 1989, was 386,845, also up 15 percent from
an average of 336,017 for the same 12-month period ending June 30,
1988, the study said.
   The occupancy rate of the nation's jails increased from 101
percent to 108 percent between the two periods, the study said. In
1983, the occupancy rate of nation's jails was 85 percent and in
1976 it was 65 percent.
   Overcrowding was worse in the jurisdictions that had the largest
number of inmates. The occupancy rate averaged 116 percent in the
508 local jurisdictions that held at least 100 inmates. These
jurisdictions had 81 percent of the nation's jail prisoners.
   State prison overcrowding also contributed to the problem in
local jails, according to the study. The study found that 88 percent
of the 508 largest jurisdictions held 42,053 prisoners for other
authorities, including 29,358 inmates that had been sent to local
jails because of overcrowding elsewhere, the study said.
   Twenty-six percent of these jurisdictions were under a court
order to reduce overcrowding at one or more jails and 23 percent had
been ordered by judges to improve conditions.
   Despite the increased overcrowding, the number of inmate deaths
declined from 469 during 1988 to 414 last year, the study said. The
number of jail suicides declined from 147 to 121.
   There were 19 million admissions and releases from local jails
during the 12-month period ending June 30, 1989.
   The average daily population of female jail inmates jumped 27
percent between 1988 and 1989. Women comprised 9 percent of all jail
inmates in 1989, the study said.
   The study surveyed local jails that hold inmates after
arraignment, usually more than 48 hours.
   Police lockups that house prisoners, usually drunks, for less
than 48 hours were not included. State-run jails and the combined
jail-prison systems of Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode
Island and Vermont were not included in the survey.

   Miners broke open an underground spring
and it flooded their zinc and lead mine, killing at least 24 workers
1,000 feet below the surface, authorities reported Sunday.
   The accident occurred Saturday night at the Ain Azel mine in
eastern Algeria, the government-owned National Enterprise for
Non-Ferrous Products reported.
   At least 24 miners and possibly more died when the waters rushed
through the underground caverns. Three people were quickly rescued,
but authorities said they held little hope of finding other
survivors.

<TEXT>
   Desmond Harmsworth, who was born into one of
Britain's great newspaper dynasties but quit his publishing job to
become an artist, has died at age 86, his family said Sunday.
   Harmsworth died Saturday at his home in Egham, near London. The
cause of death was not disclosed.
   Harmsworth was of the Harmsworth and Northcliffe families, which
control Associated Newspapers, publishers of London's Daily Mail and
other daily and weekly papers.
   He worked as a journalist and publisher for the families'
newspapers before turning to painting in the early 1930s. He moved
to Paris, where Irish author James Joyce was among those who posed
for him.
   His paintings were exhibited in London, New York, Paris,
Washington and Dallas.
   As a publisher, Harmsworth had been among the first to print
Joyce's poetry and the works of the U.S. poet Ezra Pound. He also
wrote poetry and translated the French poet Paul Valery.
   When World War II began, Harmsworth was painting in Tahiti but
moved to New York, where he worked in the British Information
Services.
   In 1926, he married Dorothy Heinlein of Bridgeport, Ohio, who
survives him with their only child, Margaret, who is also an artist.
   Harmsworth became the 2nd Baron Harmsworth after his father's
death in 1948. The title passes to his nephew, Thomas Harmsworth.

   An hour before dawn, a college dropout pastes
notices onto alley walls and slips them through mail slots.
   ``Citizens who want China to be strong and prosperous, destroy
this national impasse and struggle for China's future,'' they say.
   A red stamp proclaims the notices to be from the Committee of the
Mainland Alliance for Democracy, ``Lie Ma, director.'' Lie Ma is the
collective pseudonym of the group's six members.
   ``Chinese people are gossips,'' said the college dropout, one of
the six. ``Leave one notice and pretty soon the whole neighborhood
knows. If it's an old woman who finds it, even better. You can
always rely on her to talk.''
   He said the goal is simple: ``We want to create an unstable
situation in Beijing.''
   One year after the army crushed the largest demonstrations under
Communist rule, muffled but persistent voices of discontent continue
to rise from underground, defying stringent security measures.
   The Mainland Alliance is one of several tiny groups formed to
continue the democracy movement that was silenced above ground when
soldiers fired on demonstrators in Beijing last June 3-4.
   Some groups are known only from crudely mimeographed political
manifestos distributed hand to hand, or from typed leaflets left in
public places.
   One leaflet is signed simply, ``A group of Beijing citizens and
students.'' Other underground activists have approached foreign
journalists in Beijing, hoping to spread their message and discomfit
the nation's aging leaders.
   A group in western China calls itself the Chinese Democratic
Front, apparently in imitation of the Chinese exile group based in
Paris, which the Chinese government made famous by criticizing it.
The domestic Front says it has no contact with the Paris group.
   The Democratic Front for the Salvation of China, led by one of
last year's student protest leaders, Zhai Weimin, announced its
formation in March.
   Zhai's group is unusual because he remains in hiding, fugitive
No. 6 on a government list of the 21 most-wanted student leaders.
   Most other underground activists lead normal, open lives _ as
students, workers, professors and even police officials.
   The picture that emerges from talks with underground activists
and other Chinese sources is of separate groups, each with six to 12
members, in at least half a dozen major cities.
   These are not the first underground political groups to exist
since the Communist Party gained power in 1949, but taken
collectively, they may be the largest such movement.
   There is no nationwide network. Some groups are aware of the
activities of others or have occasional contacts, but they prefer to
operate in isolation and rely only on trusted friends.
   They are tightly knit, inexperienced and fearful, but they are
learning, the college dropout said.
   When he arrived for an interview, two friends were posted nearby
to watch for plainclothes police. He said the group's equipment
includes invisible ink and a few mimeograph machines smuggled out of
last spring's protest headquarters on Tiananmen Square.
   A public security official is the committee's mainstay, but not a
member. He has taught the six how to recognize plainclothes officers
and police vehicles, how to evade tails and what to do if questioned
by security officials.
   ``We are not against the government or the party,'' the dropout
said. ``We think the Communist Party can reform. We want to force it
to reform.''
   He said the first objective is to force the party to reverse its
verdict that last year's protests were counterrevolutionary, which
would free the participants from lifelong political taint.
   The Democratic Front for the Salvation of China and the Chinese
Democratic Front want a multiparty system. The latter's political
platform calls for a ``genuinely democratic political system that
guarantees the whole people hold the highest political power,''
including general elections and a free press.
   A statement from the Chinese Democratic Front, also made up of
about six people, said: ``Our country has a tradition of fighting a
feudal political system, but the people also have a tradition of
fighting feudal autocratic control.
   ``Our dream of democracy, freedom, equality, justice and dignity
is as strong as that of other races. ... We do not love enslavement.
We have suffered enough.''

<HEAD>Activists Prepare For `Redwood Summer' Protests Against Logging</HEAD>

   Leftist activists of all stripes,
spurred by a bombing that injured two environmentalists, are
preparing for a widespread anti-logging protest campaign they're
calling Redwood Summer.
   Earth First! organizers said they hope to reproduce the
environmental equivalent of Freedom Summer, the 1964 voter
registration campaign centered in Mississippi that helped lead to
the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
   Though Redwood Summer protests are planned as peaceful civil
disobedience to slow the pace of logging and save old-growth
redwoods, a number of violent incidents already have occurred
because of tension between those who make their living from the
northern California timber industry and environmentalists.
   A letter writer, identified only as ``the Lord's avenger,'' has
claimed responsibility for a pipe bomb explosion that injured Earth
First! leaders Judi Bari and Darryl Cherney in Oakland on May 24.
The writer also claimed responsibility for a pipe bomb that exploded
outside a lumber mill May 9.
   Earlier, Bari and Cherney reported receiving numerous death
threats, and last August her car was allegedly rammed by a logging
truck.
   During demonstrations, a protester had her nose broken by a
logger and another protester was dropped by a punch from another
logger. To that extent, Redwood Summer resembles Freedom Summer,
which was marked by violence, including the murder of three civil
rights workers near Philadelphia, Miss.
   Police arrested Bari and Cherney, saying they knowingly carried
the bomb when it blew up inside their car. But so far no charges
have been filed against them.
   Earth First! founder Dave Foreman said in interviews that he
believes the car bombing was an attempt to derail Redwood Summer.
   ``Dari and Cherney were giving it all they had. Why would they
risk losing it all?'' he said.
   Redwood Summer is the kind of event ``that could galvanize
national and even international opinion to stop the destruction of
old-growth temperate rain forests,'' Foreman said. ``Just like
Mississippi Summer that finally turned public opinion around and
brought about the passage of the Civil Rights Act.''
   Foreman is under federal indictment on charges of plotting last
year to destroy transmission lines serving nuclear plants in
California, Colorado and Arizona.
   The car bombing already has helped pull activists involved in
other issues to the anti-logging campaign.
   Amnesty International, which investigates allegations of
politically motivated violence against individuals worldwide, has
offered to look into the bombing incident.
   ``We've had a multitude of groups step forward,'' Pam Davis, an
Earth First! organizer, told a cheering audience last month at an
anti-logging rally in Santa Rosa.
   Daniel Barron, an Earth First! member in San Francisco, said that
the group is starting to form alliances with organizations in the
peace, labor and environmental movements that might have been
enemies or ``lukewarm to us in the past.''
   Offers include manpower, money, technical support and
non-violence training, organizers said.
   They said the recruits include Greenpeace; the Christic
Institute, which claims a secret government undertakes illegal
operations such as the Iran-Contra affair; Industrial Workers of the
World; Rainforest Action Network; Pledge of Resistance, which
opposes U.S. policy in Central America; and United Student Action,
which calls itself the nation's largest progressive student group.
   Many of the activists span the political spectrum but say they
have a common foe: capitalist power and its abuses.
   They are involved in a wide array of issues, including support of
organized labor, the right to abortion, increased AIDS funds and
equal rights for women and minorities.
   As for logging, environmentalists say they are frustrated by
official failure to restrain timber companies from cutting down more
trees than they've been growing.
   Timber officials deny that, and government representatives say
the industry has been properly regulated.
   Redwood Summer's kickoff protest is scheduled at the Port of
Sacramento on Thursday, with a demonstration at a log exporting
business.

<HEAD>Summit Does Not Keep Bushes From Attending Church</HEAD>

   President Bush did not let the summit interfere
with church Sunday.
   The president and his wife, Barbara, attended a 25-minute
communion service at St. John's Episcopal Church, just across
Lafayette Square from the White House.
   The Bushes usually worship at the historic ``Church of the
Presidents'' on the infrequent weekends they do not stay at the
presidential retreat at Camp David, Md.
   The Bushes and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife,
Raisa, spent Saturday in the relaxed confines of the mountaintop
compound at Camp David, but returned to the capital Saturday night.
   Bush was asked as he returned from church if things had gone well
at Camp David.
   ``It was a good day, yeah,'' the president replied as he headed
inside the White House to greet the Gorbachevs one last time for
coffee and the summit finale news conference in the East Room.
   There were only 45 people at the 8 a.m. church service, where the
altar was draped in bright red for Pentecost.
   The Rev. Anne Gavin Amy read a gospel about the Holy Spirit
descending in tongues of fire upon the apostles after Christ's
ascension to heaven.
   The Bushes both took communion.
   The Rev. John C. Harper, the rector, escorted Bush out a side
entrance to his car, telling the president, ``I'm going to pray for
you.''
   Harper is scheduled to deliver the invocation at the President's
Dinner, a annual Republican fund-raiser being held this year on June
12, which is Bush's 66th birthday.

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo meets Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev Monday for historic talks on normalizing
relations and easing hostilities on the divided Korean peninsula,
the last outpost of the Cold War.
   Roh traveled to San Fransisco Sunday for the meeting, the first
between leaders of the two countries, which for most of the past
four decades have viewed one another with hostility.
   The talks are the culmination of Seoul's efforts to court
reformist Warsaw Pact countries to broaden trade ties and influence
Soviet-backed North Korea, which is headed by Kim Il Sung, the
longest-ruling Communist dictator.
   From all indications, the meeting was arranged hastily with the
blessing of the United States.
   There was no firm agenda. Gorbachev was to be in San Francisco
sightseeing following his summit with President Bush. Roh planned to
fly to Washington to see Bush Wednesday before returning to Seoul.
   ``The waves of reform now reshaping the world have started
rushing toward Northeast Asia,'' Roh said as he departed. He said he
hoped talks with Gorbachev would forge a new era in efforts ``to
pave the way for the peace and unification of the Korean peninsula.''
   ``Korea now remains the only country on earth that is still
divided as a legacy of the Cold War,'' Roh said.
   He is expected to invite Gorbachev to visit Seoul and may seek
Moscow's help in arranging a summit meeting with Kim.
   Roh will press for early and full diplomatic relations with the
Soviet Union and ask for protection of Seoul's growing trade and
economic exchanges with Moscow.
   The South Korean president also is expected to propose a
conference on easing tensions, bringing together the Koreas and the
four powers with interests in Northeast Asia _ the United States,
the Soviet Union, Japan and China, news reports said.
   Seoul and Moscow both have an economic stake in increasing trade
and in helping defuse tensions on the peninsula, divided into the
capitalist South and the Communist North since 1945.
   The two Koreas fought a three-year war in the early 1950s. A
peace treaty was never signed and the border between the nations is
the most heavily fortified boundary in the world today.
   The North has an estimated 1.1 million armed troops and South
Korea has 650,000. Last week, the North renewed its 1988 proposal
calling for both Koreas to reduce forces to 100,000 armed men in
three to four years.
   The United States, which has 43,000 troops stationed in South
Korea, has declared strong support for improvement in South-North
relations and is trying to improve its own relations with the
North's government in Pyongyang.
   North Korea has denounced the Roh-Gorbachev meeting and said that
if it occurs, ``it will be a serious political issue.''
   The criticism from North Korea could have prompted Moscow to
treat the encounter casually, as a meeting of leaders whose paths
happen to cross in California. The day before the meeting, Moscow
still had not announced it.
   For its part, Moscow may voice support of North Korea's call for
the signing of a peace treaty, withdrawal of all nuclear weapons and
the pullout of all U.S. troops in South Korea.
   South Korean news reports say Moscow has requested from $3
billion to $5 billion worth of loans and aid before increasing its
trade and consular ties to full diplomatic relations. The Seoul
government has not denied that aid is a possibility.
   Trade between the two countries was $600 million last year and is
expected to top $1 billion in 1990.
   South Korean media have given enthusiastic coverage to the
Roh-Gorbachev meeting. There are stories on everything from Soviet
trade, food and handicrafts to new demand for Russian language
lessons.
   Seoul has established diplomatic relations with every East
European country except Albania and East Germany.

   Intense Soviet television coverage of the
Washington summit put Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the
tricky position of addressing two audiences at the same time -- and
trying to make sure each got the right message.
   For four days, Gorbachev sought to persuade American political
leaders, Hollywood celebrities, intellectuals, ordinary people _
and, of course, President Bush _ that he has world as well as Soviet
security at heart in bargaining on arms cuts, that he's being
reasonable about Lithuania and that the Soviet Union has legitimate
reasons to have something to say about the military future of
Germany.
   At the same time, he was sending messages home to let his
constituents know he was pushing hard for a trade deal to help the
struggling Soviet economy while hanging tough on Lithuania and
Germany.
   In the final minutes of his Washington visit, he was asked by a
Soviet reporter _ at a news conference televised live to the Soviet
Union as well as the United States _ to comment on his political
rivalry back home with Boris Yeltsin.
   ``I don't think you have chosen the best place for clarifying our
internal problems, but c'est la vie, as they say,'' Gorbachev
smilingly replied, as the White House audience laughed.
   He then used the opportunity to take a few political potshots,
saying Yeltsin had recently changed his position on important issues
and scolding him with the comment that ``this is not a political
game.''
   ``Everything will become clear pretty soon what Comrade Yeltsin
is after,'' Gorbachev told his two-nation audience.
   From the moment he arrived last Wednesday, Gorbachev showed his
sensitivity to press coverage by calling Soviet diplomats and
journalists to the Soviet Embassy to ask how the American press was
reporting Soviet affairs.
   The answer was mixed. ``We said the American press generally was
showing good will, but of course, there were various points of
view,'' said Albert I. Vlasov, chairman of the Novosti Press Agency.
   Practically all his public appearances were beamed back to the
Soviet Union, where his popularity has been falling as economic
conditions deteriorate and where his critics were seeking to take
advantage of his absence.
   The dual message was most apparent at a breakfast meeting Friday
with congressional leaders. He talked at length about rising bread
prices and other domestic economic problems _ a lecture shown in
prime time on Soviet television. While ostensibly talking to
American politicians, Gorbachev was actually seeking to reassure
Soviet workers.
   More specifically, he was defending himself against a rear guard
attack by Yeltsin, the populist reformer who last week was elected
president of the Russian republic, the heart of the Soviet Union.
   In Gorbachev's absence, Yeltsin opened talks with Lithuanian
independence leaders and called for the resignation of Soviet Prime
Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who last month introduced an unpopular
plan to raise Soviet food prices.
   Gorbachev said in his breakfast talk that the salary of ordinary
workers would be cushioned against the price rises. He also
reiterated his position that Lithuania was ``breaking the rules of
the game'' by declaring immediate independence instead of following
the Soviet law on secession _ a point he reiterated vigorously at
the Sunday news conference.
   On the Lithuanian issue, Gorbachev walked a public relations
tightrope during the summit, trying to make his position appear
conciliatory to Americans while sending tough signals home.
   He was aided by Soviet ``spin doctors'' _ official commentators
who sought to discredit the Lithuanians in the eyes of the American
press. One of these, Yuri V. Golik, chairman of the Supreme Soviet
Committee on Law Enforcement, went so far as to tell reporters that
Lithuania has a high crime rate ``as a natural consequence of the
political turbulence and adventurism under way there.''
   Gorbachev also sent subtly conflicting messages to his two
audiences on the question of Germany's unification and possible
membership in NATO. On one hand, he seemed to want to reach
accommodation with the West, offering ``new ideas'' and assigning
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to work on specifics with
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   On the other hand, he did not publicly back away from the
Soviets' hard line against NATO membership for a united Germany. And
he made pointed references in his arrival statement at the White
House and in the final news conference to the Soviet Union's heavy
losses against Nazi Germany in World War II.
   ``For Gorbachev, the German question is the toughest of all
international issues in terms of public opinion at home,'' said
Fyodor Burlatsky, a former speechwriter for then-Soviet Premier
Nikita Khrushchev and a prominent Soviet commentator on
international affairs.
   Even if the Soviet Union is unable to prevent German membership
in NATO, he added, ``Gorbachev must show our people that he is doing
everything he can to prevent Germany from becoming a future
threat.''

<HEAD>No More Obstacles for Murder Trial of Diplomat's Son Who Fought
Extradition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   After years of international legal wrangling,
the U.S. murder trial of a West German diplomat's son accused of
slashing his girlfriend's wealthy parents to death has no more
obstacles.
   Jens Soering, 23, is accused of killing Derek and Nancy Haysom in
March 1985 with help from their daughter because they opposed the
romance. He goes on trial this week before the local ``yokels'' he
once bragged would never bring him back.
   The Haysoms were stabbed repeatedly and both victims' throats
were cut.
   Elizabeth Haysom, 26, is serving a 90-year prison term after
admitting she helped plan the slayings. She did not fight
extradition after the fugitive couple was arrested in London in 1986.
   Soering ultimately took his case against extradition to the
European Court of Human Rights, which ruled last July that he should
not be returned to the United States because he faced a possible
death sentence.
   Virginia prosecutors won his extradition after promising British
officials that capital murder charges would be reduced to
first-degree murder carrying a maximum penalty of two life
sentences. Soering arrived in January.
   Jury selection was completed Friday and trial was scheduled to
begin this week.
   ``Time has caught up with all of us,'' Bedford County Circuit
Judge William Sweeney said.
   Soering is the son of Klaus Soering, a diplomat previously
serving as vice consul at the West German Consulate in Detroit. The
elder Soering is now stationed in Mauritania, Africa, but was in
court Friday.
   During the protracted extradition battle, Soering's attorneys
sought to have him tried in his native country, where there is no
death penalty and he would have faced a maximum 10- to 15-year
prison term.
   In a letter to Ms. Haysom written about four months after their
arrest, Soering scoffed at the early extradition efforts of Virginia
authorities.
   ``Those yokels don't know what's coming down,'' he wrote in the
letter made public during Ms. Haysom's legal proceedings. He
predicted he would go to West Germany, ``and then I'll be out in a
surprisingly short time.''
   Soering and Ms. Haysom began their relationship while both were
students at the University of Virginia.
   During school breaks, Ms. Haysom wrote to Soering, who was home
in Detroit, about how she hated her parents and that they could be
rich and happy together only if her parents were dead.
   In recorded statements to investigators played during a pretrial
hearing, Soering said he went to the Haysoms' home the night they
were killed to confront them about their opposition to his
relationship with their daughter.
   On the tape, he said there was an argument and the Haysoms were
dead when he left, but declined to answer when asked if he stabbed
them.
   Investigators concluded Ms. Haysom was not in the house at the
time.
   Haysom, 72, was a retired steel industry executive. He was
stabbed 39 times. Mrs. Haysom, 53, was stabbed five times.
   Their daughter testified at her sentencing hearing that she hated
and resented her parents, but was merely indulging in ``grotesque,
childish fantasies'' when plotting their deaths.
   Author Ken Englade's recently released book ``Beyond Reason,''
chronicles the Haysoms' story and was read by some courtroom
spectators during lulls in the pretrial hearings.
   Englade said a television movie based on his book is under
consideration and he plans to add a final chapter after Soering's
trial is completed.
   ``These are people of intelligence and education involved in a
very serious crime for no apparent reason,'' Englade said in a
recent interview from his New Mexico home. ``These kids had such a
bright future.''

   Here is a text of the joint news conference
Sunday by President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev:
   PRESIDENT BUSH:
   Hello, everybody. Please be seated. Well, when President
Gorbachev and I were in Malta, we agreed that we would try to build
a fundamentally different U.S.-Soviet relationship, one that would
move beyond containment to an era of enduring cooperation. At the
time, no one knew the momentous events would unfold around the
world. And our task is, if anything, more urgent and the case for a
new U.S.-Soviet relationship more compelling, because the
opportunities before us are so great.
   We've not shied away from discussing issues about which we
disagree. There were some tough ones before us _ particularly the
aspiration of the Baltic peoples, a cause which the United States
fully supports. I think it's a mark of how far the U.S.-Soviet
relationship has come that in all our exchanges, whether about
issues on which we agreed or disagreed, the spirit of candor and
openness, a desire not just to understand but to build bridges, has
shown through.
   President Gorbachev and I had intensive discussions on the
transforming events in Europe _ events that have put before us our
best chance in four decades to see Europe whole and free. I stressed
that the long-held aspirations of the German people should be met
without delay. On the matter of Germany's external alliances, I
believe, as do Chancellor Kohl and the members of the alliance, that
the united Germany should be a full member of NATO. President
Gorbachev, frankly, does not hold that view. But we are in full
agreement that the matter of alliance membership is, in accordance
with the Helsinki Final Act, a matter for the Germans to decide.
   Over the last six months and in Washington this week, we made
great progress in our mutual effort toward building a more peaceful
and stable world. We signed a very important chemical weapons
accord, nuclear testing protocols, and gave a political push to
others, including negotiations to reduce U.S.-Soviet strategic
nuclear forces and conventional military forces in Europe.
   I'm also hopeful that the good discussion between President
Gorbachev and the one we had about the importance of open skies will
revive those negotiations. We discussed regional issues and human
rights in considerable detail, made progress in the economic sphere,
concluding a commercial agreement, a long-term grains agreement.
   And in closing, let me say how productive I really feel the last
few days have been. President Gorbachev and I have agreed to meet on
a regular basis, perhaps annually. Both of us would like to think
that we can get together more often with less formality. Because,
you see, we're now at a stage in the U.S.-Soviet relationship and,
indeed, in world history where we should miss no opportunity to
complete the extraordinary tasks before us. Mr. President, it's been
a pleasure having you here, sir.
   PRESIDENT GORBACHEV (through interpreter):
   Ladies and gentlemen, comrades, what has happened over these days
enables me to characterize this summit meeting as an event of
enormous importance, both for our bilateral relations and in the
context of world politics. President Bush has listed the results of
the work that we've done together here which enables you to see the
scope _ the scale of this work _ and I think confirms the conclusion
that I have drawn.
   I agree with President Bush fully, who many times emphasized that
we took Malta as a point of departure and it is Malta that added
momentum to the process which, of course, must _ given all the
difficulties and disagreements which we have and which we do not
deny _ still leads us to a qualitatively new relationship with the
USSR and the USA.
   The atmosphere and the results of this meeting make it possible
for us to speak really of a new phase of cooperation which the
president has just mentioned. I believe that this transition is both
the result and a factor for further changes that affect all
countries. The constructive spirit of these days, the spirit of
responsibility, in which we discussed all questions have made our
success possible, and that's really important because that has a
stabilizing effect on the entire international situation at a time
when we are addressing fundamental issues of civilization.
   I would not want to now list _ give a listing of all that we
discussed, to mention all the agreements, all the important
questions and statements that we have made and that have a lot of
potential for the future. But, let me still mention what is most
important.
   We signed the main provision for a treaty on the reduction of
strategic arms. And I would like to emphasize that this is the first
time that we're not just limiting, but we will be reducing the most
devastating means of warfare. And I hope that we will sign the
treaty itself this year. We also signed a statement about the future
treaty negotiations on nuclear and space arms. We have agreed to
make sure that we will complete the Vienna talks this year and sign
an agreement on conventional arms at a European summit by the end of
this year. Not everything depends on us, but this is our position.
We want to achieve that.
   We also discussed problems relating to the European process,
specifically, external aspects of German unification. I cannot say
that we have reached agreement, but that does not mean that our
efforts were futile. Many new arguments emerged as a result of these
discussions and new possible perspectives. We have clarified our
positions and it is our position that we will continue discussion in
order to find a mutually acceptable solution. We could not resolve
this issue in Washington, with the president, the two of us. There
is also the two-plus-four formula and other European countries which
are concerned, and which want to see a mutually acceptable solution,
a solution acceptable to all of us.
   The position of the Soviet Union is that we have to find
solutions that would fit into the overall positive trend of changes
in Europe and in the world, that would strengthen and not erode
security. I would like, in particular, to emphasize the importance
of our dialogue at Camp David, where we talked during the day
yesterday, and this is a new phase in strengthening mutual
understanding and trust between us.

<TEXT>
   We really discussed all world problems. We compared our political
perspectives, and we did that in an atmosphere of frankness,
constructive atmosphere, an atmosphere of growing trust. We
discussed specifically such urgent international issues as the
situation in the Middle East, Afghanistan, southern Africa,
Cambodia, Central America. That is just some of what we have
discussed. I would not want to go into detail right now. I think
that you will probably seek to get clarification on this, but anyway
I think that the Camp David dialogue was very important.
   We have agreed to make a special statement on Ethiopia to support
efforts to re-establish peace there and also, with the help of the
United Nations, to give humanitarian relief to the Ethiopian people.
   Speaking of bilateral relations, we have some important political
achievements here. Specifically, there is movement on such important
areas as trade agreement, grain trade, agreement on civil aviation
cooperation, maritime agreement, peaceful uses of atomic energy,
science and technology, and education.
   While we and the president were working and our ministers were
also discussing things, there were important contact discussions
with various American companies, and some important decisions were
made, such as Chevron, that will be participating in the exploration
of the Tengiz oil fields. That will mean an investment of about 10
billion rubles.
   A group of our academicians were here with me, and they had a
good discussion which resulted in the signing of a memorandum of
intent with IBM, which will participate in the program of using
computers for education in the Soviet Union. I think that this
economic area and other areas create a good foundation for our
political dialogue and creates a kind of solid support _ solid
pillar of support _ for our cooperation. I would like to express my
profound gratification at this work that we have done together with
President George Bush. I appreciate very much him as a political
leader who is able, in a very human way, and in a politically
responsible way, to engage in dialogue and cooperation.
   We spent many hours together and were able to come to know each
other very well. I don't know whether anyone will be ever able to
say that we know each other totally well or completely. I think that
would take many, many years. But now we have a good human
relationship and, I think, a good human atmosphere between us.
   The president has said, and I would like to confirm this, that we
have decided to have regular meetings on a working basis in a
businesslike manner, and this is really what is necessary. I would
like to tell you that I've invited President George Bush, the
president of the United States, to visit the Soviet Union, to come
for a state visit to our country.
   In concluding, and that is something that is not within the
framework of the official negotiations but was part of our visit, I
would like to say both to the Americans and to the Soviet people
that here we, the Soviet delegation, we have felt very good feelings
of the American people, feelings of solidarity and a lot of interest
from the Americans toward what we are doing in the Soviet Union for
perestroika. I have felt that on many occasions in my short
exchanges with the Americans and also in various talks. I would like
to thank all Americans for that, and they certainly can expect
reciprocity from the Soviet Union for that. And finally, we, the two
of us, were discussing things of concern to us _ various regions,
various problems affecting the lives of other countries. But that
does not mean that we were trying to decide anything for others.
   Anyway, we remembered always that what we were doing must be
useful not only for our countries but for the world and, of course,
specifically for that Third World. And let me at this wrap up my
initial remarks at this press conference.
   QUESTION: I'd like to ask both presidents about Germany.
President Bush, you mentioned that you still have a disagreement
about the united Germany being in NATO. In any concrete sense, did
you narrow your differences on this subject? And are any
alternatives being seriously considered?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I'm not sure we narrowed them. I feel I
understand President Gorbachev's position, but I know this for a
fact certain _ I had every opportunity to explain in considerable
detail why I felt a united Germany in NATO would be stabilizing,
would be important for the stability of a post-German unification
Europe. So, I can't say whether we narrowed them. But the benefit of
a meeting like this is, once again, you can talk in great frankness
about it. I have no suspicion about his position, and I hope he has
no suspicion about mine. And we've got collective decisions to take
with NATO allies on matters of this nature. And -- but in the final
analysis, it's a question for Germany to decide that. And maybe
we're closer on that, but I would defer to President Gorbachev.
   PRESIDENT GORBACHEV: Since I have already made quite a few
remarks on many occasions during these days on this subject, I will
confine myself to comments which I think important in order to
emphasize the thinking on this score, and in order for us to
understand better what they're after. We're not insisting that it
should be an option of the Soviet Union. We are not saying that this
should be a version by the United States of America or anybody
else's option.
   What we are talking about is an option or a solution of external
problems related to Germany unification, which would organically
incorporate the European process and improvement of international
politics as a whole. In order for, so that a solution of these
issues would help enrich this process and make it more stable and
reliable, we're opposed to any options whatever it may come from.
We, ourselves, are not going to offer one, one that would weaken
these processes or create difficulties for the unfolding processes
in the European continent. We're not going to put spokes in the
wheels, as it were.
   So I believe the fact that the president, myself and our
colleagues have devoted a great deal of time to this issue, we have
threshed out this idea very, very thoroughly. I think (it) has been
very helpful and beneficial because we will continue our debates on
this.

<HEAD>Burma's `People Power' Triumphs, but Under Military Threat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burma took a tentative step toward
democracy in the impoverished nation's first multiparty elections in
30 years, but despite an overwhelming opposition victory, Burmese
are still cowed by military control.
   The opposition scored a huge victory over conservative,
pro-military forces in the May 27 vote. Tallies show the Parliament
will be overwhelmingly dominated by the regime's harshest critics,
the National League for Democracy.
   The military has promised to yield power after newly elected
legislators enact a constitution and form a civilian government. But
many express concern over whether the military will be able to wean
itself from power.
   In 1988 Burmese took to the streets to press for democracy,
briefly triumphed then were brutally crushed by army gunfire. Today,
the 10 p.m.-to-4 a.m. curfew is a nightly reminder the military
still holds power.
   And already the junta, led by Gen. Saw Maung, has said the army
won't tolerate ``threats to national unity,'' a vague phrase that in
the past has been used to justify crushing dissent.
   The tense political scene is complicated by economic malaise and
ethnic insurgencies, which could be interpreted as threatening
national unity.
   Within the National League for Democracy, relatively
inexperienced young radicals are vying for control with a more
moderate senior faction. Another flash point could prove to be Aung
San Suu Kyi, the dynamic opposition leader.
   Just as the Philippines' ``people power'' revolution united
behind Corazon Aquino, much of the League's popularity comes from
Ms. Suu Kyi, who led Burmese in the 1988 uprising.
   The 44-year-old former housewife and academic, however, was
barred from participating in the May elections and remains under
house arrest, accused of subversion. Officials allege she has links
to insurgent groups, and they have indicated she won't be freed
anytime soon.
   The military barred other opposition leaders from participating
in the vote, and the opposition says hundreds of League members
remain jailed from the 1988 uprising.
   The league and its supporters dread a repeat of the rebellion,
when the army killed several thousand, mostly unarmed civilians.
   The pro-democracy movement began with small protests led by
students who wanted an end to the one-party rule of Gen. Ne Win. He
seized power in 1962, and since then the formerly prosperous nation
has become one of the world's poorest.
   The protests culminated in massive, nationwide demonstrations by
civil servants, professionals, Buddhist monks and some military
personnel.
   The protestors were already celebrating what they said was the
triumph of peaceful revolution.
   But the short-lived triumph turned to bloodshed when the military
decided enough was enough. Several thousand people were gunned down
by troops.
   Saw Maung, who took over after Ne Win retired in 1988, declared
martial law and arrested thousands of protesters. He also called for
general elections and allowed new political parties, albeit within
strict controls.
   This time around, Burmese expressed their opposition to military
rule at the polls.
   Their overwhelming support for the New Democracy League left no
doubt about their desire for political and economic change.
   ``I'm so happy to see those old cronies who devastated the
economy leave the scene,'' said a retired civil servant.
   ``We have suffered a lot under the military,'' said a younger
man. ``I'm happy that now we will have good leaders.''
   If the military allows it, the leaders will come from the League,
composed of Ms. Suu Kyi's more radical followers hungry for revenge,
as well as moderate, older leaders, who favor a cautious approach in
dealing with the junta.
   ``Our first priority is to build a strong government so that
people will be comfortable,'' said one League official. ``We want to
sow the seeds for democracy so that our country will never again be
ruled by arms.''

   SOVIET JEWS REACT _ Soviet refuseniks reacted indignantly to
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's warning that he might cut the number of Jews
allowed to emigrate if Israel continued to settle them in the
occupied territories.
   ``The statements from the Soviet president about restriction of
emigration from the U.S.S.R. are not very good for any of us,'' said
Mikhail Shapiro, who has been denied permission to emigrate since
1988.
   Leonid Stonov, a spokesman for Soviet Jews said: ``it is a human

<HEAD>Candidates Sharpen Their Attacks as Tuesday's Primaries Near</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dianne Feinstein and John Van de Kamp were on
the attack Sunday as time ran short in their heated battle for the
Democratic nomination for governor of California. Candidates in
eight other states also were getting in their final licks before
Tuesday's primary elections.
   The rival candidates put on closing television blitzes that were
unrelentingly negative.
   The tone was more subdued in other contests, including a
Democratic Senate runoff in North Carolina, gubernatorial primaries
in Alabama, Iowa, and New Mexico and a Republican Senate primary in
Montana.
   Mississippi, New Jersey and South Dakota also were holding
primaries, but none of the statewide contests in those states
appeared in doubt.
   ``Now you know why John Van de Kamp doesn't talk about his own
record,'' said a Feinstein television ad that attacked the two-term
state attorney general on the death penalty, abortion and his
handling of the case of the Hillside Strangler, who was accused of
the rape and murder of 10 Los Angeles-area women a decade ago.
   A Van de Kamp ad described Feinstein, the former mayor of San
Francisco, as ``a Republican in Democratic clothing.''
   Watching the Democrats savage each other was Sen. Pete Wilson,
who has only token opposition in the Republican gubernatorial
primary. Wilson was sitting on a $3.5 million war chest after
raising more that $11 million last year and in the first four months
of this year.
   Van de Kamp has raised about $6.1 million and Feinstein $6.7
million, including $3 million of her own money.
   The most recent polls said Feinstein was marginally ahead of Van
de Kamp but also had both Democrats trailing Wilson in a general
election matchup.
   Harvey Gantt and Mike Easley, locked in a runoff for the North
Carolina Democratic nomination to oppose Republican Sen. Jesse
Helms, concentrated on firing up their supporters on the assumption
turnout would be the key on Tuesday.
   Gantt, the black former mayor of Charlotte, finished first in a
six-candidate field May 8, but fell just short of the 40 percent
needed to avoid a runoff.
   Two polls last week showed Gantt leading Easley among likely
Democratic voters.
   A Charlotte Observer poll said Gantt led Easley, 42 percent to 32
percent, with 27 percent undecided. That poll of more than 400
likely Democratic voters had a margin of error of 4.9 percentage
points.
   A Mason Dixon poll, conducted for several news organizations,
said Gantt led 46 percent to 41 percent. The survey of 424 likely
Democratic voters, taken May 28-30, showed 13 percent undecided and
had a margin of error of about 5 percentage points.
   In Iowa, where three Democrats are vying for the nomination to
challenge Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, house speaker Don Avenson
was leader in a new poll published Sunday in the Des Moines Register.
   The survey of 629 Democrats said Avenson was supported by 32
percent, while Tom Miller, the state attorney general, had the
backing of 25 percent. Banker John Chrystal had 19 percent.
   Avenson recently receiving the backing of the National Abortion
Rights Action League. Miller and Branstad both oppose abortion.
   Four Republicans and four Democrats were competing in New
Mexico's gubernatorial primaries for the chance to run for the first
term in which a governor will be allowed to run for re-election.
Among the Democrats was former Gov. Bruce King, who served two
four-year terms but was forced by the state constitution to step
down after each one.
   In Montana, four Republicans were battling for the chance to
challenge Democratic Sen. Max Baucus.
   In their final weekend of campaigning, Feinstein and Van de Kamp
focused on the minority voters who may decide the Democratic
nomination.
   Feinstein appeared Saturday before the annual state convention of
the League of United Latin American Citizens to criticize Van de
Kamp's record on minority hiring in the state Department of Justice,
which he heads.
   Compared to a guideline of 25 percent Hispanics, Van de Kamp has
only 11.5 percent in his total department and 1.5 percent in his top
management, Feinstein said.
   ``It's time to open doors which have been shut. I believe that is
the symbolic, the practical and the real value of my candidacy,''
Feinstein said. ``I'm not talking about a quota. I'm talking about
what I'm going to do.''
   Van de Kamp disputed Feinstein's figures on his department,
saying the statistics are skewed by the number of career staff
members carried over from earlier administrations. He said the proof
of his commitment to minority advancement is the endorsements he has
from groups such as the Mexican American Political Alliance.
   Van de Kamp also focused on the minority voters who today account
for nearly half of California's registered Democrats, scheduling
campaign visits to five black churches in the Los Angeles area
Sunday.
   ``Someday I'd like it to be said of me, he tried to feed the
hungry _ not only tried but succeeded,'' Van de Kamp told the
congregation of the Praises of Zion Baptist Church.
   Feinstein also blamed Van de Kamp for allowing the sale of up to
$10 million in now-worthless Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan securities. Van
de Kamp's spokeswoman, Barbara Johnson, said Feinstein was
``demonstrating profound ignorance about the role of the attorney
general in state government.''
   California Republican Gov. George Deukmejian is retiring after
two terms.

<HEAD>Human Rights Group Charges Army was Hasty in Opening Fire</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli human rights group said Sunday the
army was too hasty in opening fire on Palestinians protesting an
Israeli's massacre of seven Arab workers last month.
   The May 20 massacre by a deranged gunman and 16 subsequent deaths
in clashes with the army helped produce the Palestinian uprising's
highest monthly death toll in a year, said the Israeli Information
Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territorities.
   The center, known in Hebrew as Betselem, said the latest deaths
came despite army claims that soldiers had learned to exercise
restraint in countering protests in the 29-month-old uprising.
   ``The facts prove that the opposite was true,'' said a report by
the group, founded by Israeli liberals and intellectuals.
   ``The center's initial inquiries give the impression that
security forces did not show enough prudence to give residents
sufficient opportunity to in any way express their pain and anger,
acting instead to nip all protests in the bud,'' the report said.
   A top aide to Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, in response to a
European Community statement calling for restraint in the Middle
East, blamed the violence on the PLO.
   ``This past week there were two sad reminders that the real
obstacle to peace is PLO-sponsored terrorism and refusal by Arab
states to put an end to a state of war and open peace talks with
Israel,'' Dany Naveh was quoted on Israel radio as saying.
   The Arens aide referred to a pipe bomb explosion that killed an
elderly Israeli and a foiled attack along the Israeli coast by
guerrillas from the Palestine Liberation Front, a PLO faction headed
by Mohammed Abbas.
   The European statement Saturday repeated a call for an
international Middle East peace conference to include the Palestine
Liberation Organization. The statement said Israel's continued
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip ``is not sustainable.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government refuses to hold talks
with the PLO, which it considers a terrorist organization lhat seeks
to destroy the Jewish state. He also has rejected the idea of an
international peace conference.
   Including the seven men massacred May 20 in the Tel Aviv suburb
of Rishon Letzion, 33 Palestinians were killed in May by Israeli
soldiers and civilians. An equal number were killed in May 1989 when
the Palestinian uprising was more intense.
   The Israeli human rights center noted that two Israelis were
killed by Palestinians in May apparently in revenge for the massacre
or the subsequent killings by the army.
   The highest monthly death toll in the uprising was 44 in April
1988, when riots erupted to protest the assassination of PLO
military chief Khalil al-Wazir in Tunis, Tunisia. Al-Wazir's death
was widely blamed on Israel.
   Since the uprising began in December 1987, 714 Palestinians have
been killed by Israeli soldiers and civilians, and 45 Israelis have
been slain by Palestinians.
   An additional 217 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs,
most after being accused of collaborating with Israel. Israeli
authorities say few had any such links.

<TEXT>
   QUESTION: I have this question to address to you, Mikhail
Sergeyevich. You have just mentioned President Bush as having
qualities of a statesman. Could you tell us what role they played in
helping you make so many accomplishments at this summit meeting and
advance in the solution of many problems that seem to be intractable?
   PRESIDENT GORBACHEV: I can reiterate what I have said and I can
add the following. Mr. Bush and I met each other a bit earlier,
before finding ourselves in this position together. And during my
contacts with him I felt _ and it was during my first visit here, in
1987 _ that this is the kind of person to do business with, to build
our relations with. Then we had contacts at the Governor's Island,
which persuaded me even more of that. We have maintained
correspondence between us and perhaps Malta was exactly the point
where President Bush and I could get to know each other even better
and to engage in some thinking on one-on-one meetings.
   I must say that everything began with discovering the fact that
President Bush and myself have a desire to do business informally,
which is very, very important. If we added to this the fact that
each of us, while being himself and while representing their own
people, should react in a responsible fashion to everything, and in
context of the real role played by the Soviet Union and the United
States of America, we could very well imagine the human
compatibility which exists between people and which enables them to
create a kind of atmosphere that makes it possible to clarify the
root causes of some particular processes.
   I can say that this dialogue is well under way, and as to
yesterday's meetings at Camp David, they were a great accomplishment
in and by themselves. This is my assessment, and I think the fact
that we have established a rapport will be very important.
   QUESTION: This is a two-pronged question for both presidents.
Beyond words, what guarantees can you give the Palestinians that
decisions you made on emigration will not result in the further
usurpation of their lands? And why is it that President Gorbachev
has shown so much human sympathy for the Palestinians while the U.S.
vetoes even a U.N. look at their plight under military siege?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Would you like to ....
   PRESIDENT GORBACHEV: I, please. Please.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Did you have a particular order you wanted us to
answer that question in? (Laughter.)
   QUESTION: If you can.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: The United States policy on settlement in the
Occupied Territories is unchanged and is clear, and that is, we
oppose new settlements in territories beyond the 1967 lines. It is a
stated, reaffirmed policy over and over again.
   Now, we do not oppose the secretary general sending an emissary
to the Middle East to look at this important question. The question
is compounded, however, when you see on the eve of the discussion of
that, an outrageous guerrilla attack on Israel launched from another
country. That is unacceptable to the United States. Having said
that, we don't want to _ the position of a our country is _ we do
not think that it needs U.N. troops or U.N. Security Council
missions, but we do favor Mr. Goulding, a representative of the
secretary general, going there. So when the question came and we
differed with the Soviet Union _ indeed, we differed with many of
our other allies on this question. It is our view that the most
productive way to handle that question was to have an emissary from
the secretary general, not as the other countries in the Security
Council favored, a Security Council delegation go there.
   QUESTION: Well, Mr. President, do you agree that there have been
settlements, even though this has been our policy for many years?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Yes, I agree there are settlements that go
contrary to the United States' policy, and I will continue to
represent the policy, reiterate the policy, and try to persuade the
government of Israel that it is counterproductive to go forward with
additional settlements in these territories. Our objective is to get
the parties to the peace table, and our secretary of state has
worked diligently with the Israelis, and I have tried to do my best
to get them talking. And that's what we, is the most, the most
immediate step that is needed. And I will continue to reiterate
American policy and continue to push for peace talks.
   PRESIDENT GORBACHEV: Just a moment, I'd like to respond, too. You
formulated your question in precise terms; namely what kind of
guarantees can we issue so that those who want to leave, those who
have chosen Israel as their place of residence, those who leave from
the Soviet Union should not be resettled (in) unoccupied
territories? This is not a simple question and this is what I have
to say in this connection.
   The Soviet Union is now being bombarded by a lot of criticism
from Arab countries. Lately, I have had meetings with President
Assad of Syria and President Mubarak of Egypt. Those were very
important talks with them. Nevertheless, this question _ this was
the question that was also raised by them in acute terms, the
question of guarantees.
   Now, we are facing the following situation. Either after these
meetings and exchanges with the president of the United States of
America on this particular issue, our concern will be heeded in
Israel and they will make certain conclusions. Or else we must give
further thought to it in terms of what we can do with issuing
permits for exit. And some people are raising the matter in these
terms in the Soviet Union, namely; as long as there are no
assurances from the Israelis that this is not going to be done by
them _ to postpone issuing permits for exit, to put it off. But I
hope they will heed what the two presidents strongly advise them _
that they should act in a wise fashion. Perhaps this is what I would
like to express by way of reacting.

   Gorbachev warned Israel that he would ``give thought'' to
suspending the issuance of exit permits for Soviet Jews if they
continue to be settled on the West Bank or in Gaza. Bush condemned a
terrorist incident against Israel, but reiterated U.S. opposition to
further settlements on the lands captured from the Arabs in the 1967
Mideast War. ``I will try to persuade the government of Israel that
it is counterproductive,'' Bush said.

   Bush said he had received no assurances from Gorbachev that the
Kremlin would lift its economic sanctions against Lithuania.
Gorbachev said the rights of republics are being expanded and that
any change must take place within the framework of the Soviet
Constitution. But he said Lithuanians and other are not giving that
process ``due regard.''

   Gorbachev noted new commercial agreements with IBM and Chevron.
Bush said the trade agreement he and Gorbachev signed on Friday
would not go to Congress without Soviet enactment of liberalized
emigration laws. But he repeated that there was no linkage between
trade accords and the Kremlin's treatment of Lithuania. Most favored
trading status ``is linked to the emigration law being passed.
That's it,'' Bush said.

speak of a new phase of cooperation,'' between the United States and
Soviet Union.

   Gorbachev described the Washington summit as one of ``enormous

   The United States and the Soviet Union agreed
at the summit to expand joint efforts to protect the environment and
study global change, they said Sunday.
   A joint statement said the two sides ``emphasized the need for
practical and effective joint measures on environmental protection.''
   They ``affirmed their serious concern about the health of the
global environment, and their commitment to expand U.S.-Soviet
cooperation in the field of environmental protection and the study
of global change,'' the communique said.
   Critics have accused the Bush administration of going too slowly
in dealing with the question of global warming, which many
scientists view as a threat to crops.
   The joint statement said, ``The United States and the U.S.S.R.
attached great importance to full and open exchange of environmental
data and to careful coordination of existing global atmospheric,
terrestrial and ocean monitoring systems.
   ``Accordingly, they endorsed intensified bilateral cooperation in
areas of environmental, ecological and pollution monitoring and in
related research,'' it said.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said
Sunday that he would visit Japan as part of an effort to build ties
with his country's Pacific neighbors.
   Gorbachev's disclosure, at a summit-ending news conference with
President Bush, came on the eve of his planned meeting in San
Francisco with President Roh Tae-woo of South Korea, which is
actively seeking to normalize relations.
   The Soviet Union wants to upgrade its outdated and inefficient
production facilities, and both Japan and South Korea could be
valuable sources of inexpensive technology and consumer goods that
aren't available in the Soviet Union or are in such short supply
that they are practically unobtainable.
   The Japanese had been expecting a Gorbachev visit, perhaps in the
spring of 1991, but relations between the two countries have been
strained by a longstanding territorial dispute.
   The Kuril Islands, which lie to the north of present-day Japan,
were seized and settled by the Soviets at the end of World War II,
and the Japanese want them returned. The dispute thus far has
blocked improved trade relations between the two countries.
   Meanwhile, the South Koreans have launched a major drive to open
relations with former Communist East Bloc countries, and are seeking
new markets for their high-technology exports.
   But Soviet officials have sought to play down the meeting between
Gorbachev and Roh, pointing to the sensitivity of relations with
North Korea, the Soviets' longtime ally.
   Some members of the Soviet delegation also have suggested that
Japanese business leaders are uneasy about the Gorbachev-Roh meeting
because they view the South Koreans as competition for the Soviets'
huge market and natural resources.
   Gorbachev, in his remarks at the news conference, said the Soviet
Union would like to help build a cooperative community among Pacific
nations like the one in Europe.
   ``We must act with due regard for those specifics'' in the Asian
region, he said, ``without copying blind the European process but
borrowing something from it.''
   ``Of course, I think this road will be longer and more thorny,''
Gorbachev said. ``But still, it is especially necessary over there
because those peoples need an opportunity to reallocate their
resources to overcome a lot of social problems that have been
accumulated.''
   He noted the increasing contacts between the Soviet Union and
India and China, countries he has visited within the last two years.
   ``I am planning to go on a visit to Japan so as to open that area
for discussion,'' he said. ``So we're going to intensify our efforts
in that direction.''

   British-born actress Jane Seymour and her
business manager-husband, David Flynn, have bought a $1.2 million
Bel-Air house that they plan to turn into an English country-style
home.
   The couple recently sold their house in nearby Beverly Hills for
$6 million and are about to start renovating the Bel-Air house, said
Jana Jones of the real estate firm Alvarez, Hyland &amp; Young.
   The 6,980-square-foot Beverly Hills house, purchased last year
from singer Carol Lawrence, was too big for the amount of time the
two spend in town, Ms. Jones said.
   Nevertheless, the 3,500-square-foot Bel-Air house will be
expanded, Ms. Jones said.
   The couple's main residence in the United States is in Santa
Barbara. Miss Seymour, whose credits include the TV miniseries ``War
and Remembrance,'' and her American husband also own homes in
England, including one they just bought in the Mayfair district of
London.

   Imelda Marcos was released from New York Hospital
on Sunday after treatment for a stomach ailment that caused her to
collapse in a courtroom.
   Mrs. Marcos, wearing a black dress and accompanied by relatives,
was brought out of New York Hospital at noon in a wheelchair, then
walked about 10 steps to a waiting Mercedes-Benz driven by the
family's spokesman, Roger Peyuan.
   She rolled down the window, smiled wanly and waved to
photographers as the car drove away.
   It was unclear where they were headed.
   On Thursday, Mrs. Marcos, 60, was removed from a courtroom on a
stretcher after she collapsed and coughed up blood. Her condition
was diagnosed as erosive gastritis, an inflammation of the stomach
caused by excessive acid. Doctors said the ailment could have been
caused by stress, but did not appear related to the high blood
pressure that led to two previous trial interruptions.
   After her collapse, U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan recessed
the trial at least until Tuesday. However, Peyuan said the doctors
would suggest to the judge that she get a few more days' rest before
going back.
   The former Philippine first lady's trial began March 20. She is
accused of having helped her husband, the late President Ferdinand
Marcos, steal $220 million from their nation's treasury for their
personal use, including the secret purchase of artworks and four New
York office buildings.

   Astronomer Carl Sagan urged Lehigh
University graduates to shake off apathy and take the lead in
fighting for the environment.
   ``Anything else you're interested in is not going to happen if
you can't breathe the air and drink the water,'' he said Saturday.
   ``Don't sit this one out. Do something. You are by an accident of
fate alive at an absolutely critical moment in the history of our
planet,'' he said.
   Sagan, who teaches at Cornell University, received an honorary
doctorate degree from the school, which graduated 1,148 students
Saturday.
   He told the students the worldwide movement toward democracy fits
with the need for a worldwide environmental movement.
   ``Molecules don't have passports,'' he said. ``Carbon dioxide and
CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) rise over one country and are carried
around the world. No one nation can solve our environmental
problems.''

   Carroll Shelby, whose sports car designs
include the legendary Shelby Cobra and Chrysler's recently unveiled
Viper, has entered Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to await heart
transplant surgery.
   The three-time former U.S. Sports Car driver of the year entered
the hospital's intensive care unit Saturday. He has been on a
waiting list for the procedure since November 1989, said his
publicist, Glenn Campbell.
   Hospital officials declined to reveal when surgery might be
performed.
   Shelby, 67, has a history of heart trouble. He used
nitroglycerine tablets to overcome angina pains during his last year
of competitive racing in 1960. He was operated on in 1963 to repair
damage caused by coronary artery disease and underwent bypass
surgery five years after that.
   Last month, Shelby appeared with Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca in
Los Angeles to unveil Chrsyler's pricey new Dodge Viper sports car.
Shelby headed a team of designers that helped create the two-seat,
V-10 engine vehicle, which Chrysler expects to begin selling in 1992
at a price of $40,000 to $50,000 per car.
   He has also been working on a new car, the Shelby ``Can AM'' for
the Sports Car Club of America.

   Andre Agassi found himself down two sets to
one on the fashion court as Mr. Blackwell joined French tennis
officials in volleying against the athlete's penchant for flashy
attire.
   ``Like an outdated flower child,'' the mild-mannered but
acid-tongued fashion critic clucked Saturday as he described
Agassi's appearance.
   The tennis star had lashed out at the French Tennis Federation
and its president, Philippe Chartrier, the day before for indicating
that an on-court dress code may be implemented if the players don't
cool it with the outlandish outfits.
   ``Those bozos will look for anyone to talk about,'' said Agassi,
who has a preference for bright pink tennis tights and a haircut
that is a cross between punk rock and heavy metal.
   Chartrier made his pronouncement as Agassi was defeating Arnaud
Boetsch to advance in the French Open in Paris.
   ``He has every right to wear what he wants to wear, provided he
has some respect for the sport he's in,'' Blackwell told The
Associated Press. ``Let him wear his neon, flower-child-gone-to-seed
shorts. But I would suggest he get himself in front of a mirror
before he goes out in public.''
   While Blackwell sympathizes with the gatekeepers of tennis
fashion, however, he believes establishing an on-court dress code is
going too far. He said it should be up to the players to show good
taste in fashion.
   ``We've lost the quality of knowing what to wear,'' opined
Blackwell, whose annual compilation of a 10-worst-dressed-women list
has been a fashion world event for years.
   ``That's what's wrong with a lot of our society,'' he added.
``You don't wear jeans to the opera. You simply do not do it. It's a
reflection of us and our self-esteem.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev played horseshoes and
hardball during his four days in Washington.
   He took off his tie and relaxed at Camp David, disarmed critics
with a candid assessment of his problems at home, and sealed deals
with American corporate giants Chevron and IBM.
   He delighted throngs of summit watchers with his patented
``impromptu'' walks along downtown streets, basking in adulation and
saying, ``I feel at home here.''
   He declared the Cold War over but said time and again that Moscow
won't let the West dictate the terms of an emerging new political
and military order in Europe.
   Perhaps alluding to the main prize he won from President Bush _ a
trade agreement _ Gorbachev described his summit partner as ``a man
I can do business with.''
   The Soviet leader is under enormous pressure at home to rebuild a
collapsing economy, and he used his Washington visit not only to
plead for patience but also to draw American technological know-how
into his economic reform efforts.
   While Gorbachev was pitching horseshoes at the presidential
retreat at Camp David. Md., on Saturday, the Soviet Embassy hosted a
signing ceremony for an oil exploration deal with Chevron and an
agreement for IBM to put personal computers in Soviet schools.
   The deals are examples of the kind of commercial contacts that
could prosper under the trade agreement that Bush and Gorbachev
signed on Friday. The Soviet leader touted the Chevron and IBM
agreements at a summit-ending news conference Sunday as ``a good
economic foundation'' for improved superpower relations.
   He candidly acknowledged that his efforts to introduce a
market-oriented economic system had not yet succeeded, saying that
while the United States can draw on a tradition of free markets the
Soviet Union ``must start from scratch.''
   But he was quick to add that no one should think he came to
Washington ``with my hat in hand,'' nor should the West try to take
advantage of Moscow at a time of internal turmoil.
   Throughout a hectic schedule that began with his arrival last
Wednesday evening and included meetings with American entertainment,
academic and political figures, Gorbachev appeared relaxed,
self-assured and in good spirits.
   He was at ease enough to deflect a Soviet reporter's pointed
question about his relationship with political nemesis Boris
Yeltsin, who won election to the presidency of Russia last Tuesday
and immediately called for sovereignty for the largest Soviet
republic. ``C'est la vie,'' a grinning Gorbachev responded.
   He reached out to Americans, literally and figuratively. He
pressed the flesh with ordinary citizens on Washington's crowded
streets. And at a formal treaty signing ceremony in the White House
he asked to be excused for the length of his remarks, saying in a
tone of mock exasperation: ``I'm human, I'm emotional.''
   Gorbachev got the trade agreement he wanted _ albeit with
conditions attached _ but he fell short of convincing Bush of the
Soviet view on perhaps the two most sensitive issues raised during
the summit: the future military alignment of a reunited Germany, and
his handling of Lithuania's demand for independence.
   With a flash of iron will and resentment of what he considers
preaching by the West, Gorbachev did verbal battle with a group of
congressional leaders in a meeting Friday at the Soviet Embassy.
   When Sen. Bob Dole, the minority leader from Kansas, complained
about Moscow's partial economic blockade against Lithuania,
Gorbachev shot back with a gibe on the American invasion of Panama.
   ``When we hear there is a debate in Congress about our affairs
... about what we should do, well, this is resented in our
society,'' Gorbachev said. ``This is a matter of dignity.''

   QUESTION: My question is addressed to Comrade Gorbachev. Your
relationship with President Bush _ perestroika activities are well
assured inside but there is a cooling of interest. Everybody's
concerned with internal matters at home. Taking advantage of this
opportunity I'd like to ask you what do you think of your
relationship with Yeltsin? Are you going to offer a branch, an olive
branch of peace to each other?
   PRESIDENT GORBACHEV: I don't think you have chosen the best place
for clarifying our internal problems _ but c'est la vie, as they
say. There is real life, there are certain processes under way back
home and I thought I tried to respond to this question when I was in
Canada. As soon as I stepped out of the plane they asked me this
particular question and I said that what I was worrying about most
was a kind of an impasse which emerged at the Congress itself
because there is no strong preponderance. It took really three
rounds for Comrade Yeltsin to gain a majority of votes, by just a
few votes, to be elected. So the situation remains.
   And, I said that in recent days something has happened which
calls for thinking on our part. Comrade Yeltsin _ with respect to
some very serious, important political, fundamental issues _ has
changed his position; at least he has introduced clarity. And I
said, if this is not a political game for him to hold high office,
it is one thing. (A) certain approach can be adopted on the basis of
that and we could certainly forecast certain kind of developments in
the Soviet -- in the Supreme Soviet and in Russia.
   But if this is nothing but a maneuver and he will return to what
he has been doing in recent years, not only critical terms _
Americans believe this is to be constructive _ but also in
destructive activities, destructive efforts. He went as far as to
fertilize in the framework of perestroika our efforts with some
ideas, with ideas regarding forms of life where we are making a
turnaround in all spheres. So, if he is going to come back to this,
then, of course, his chairmanship will certainly complicate these
processes.
   I should say that after that he gave an interview and people
began to see that he is changing again. The very next day he was
interrogated at a session. He tried to explain his position. In
short, I always say life will place everything in proper
perspective. Now that we have reached a phase of radical fundamental
change, where everybody is supposed to show great responsibility for
their country, where we are changing everything; now that we have,
we are about to make a radical change about in our economy, it is
all very serious. Everything will become clear pretty soon what
Comrade Yeltsin is after.
   QUESTION: President Bush, I'd like to ask you about the trade
agreement that you signed yesterday, already a matter of some
political controversy and criticism in this country. Secretary Baker
has indicated it will not go to Congress for its action until the
Soviet codification of its new emigration policies. Does that mean,
sir, that when that law is passed in the Soviet Union that you are
prepared to go ahead as well with Most Favored Nation trading status
for the Soviet Union, or will that further step require some action,
some loosening, some shift on the Baltics?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, we had a chance to discuss the Baltics. And
I made clear that the Baltics _ I think I said it at a U.S. press
conference several weeks ago _ caused some tensions, that the
linkage is between the trade agreement and the emigration
legislation. And I'm not going to send that legislation up, and I've
tried to be very frank, until the Soviet Union has completed action
on the legislation guaranteeing the right of emigration.
   QUESTION: What about the further step of actually granting Most
Favored Nation status?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, I've given our position. And the linkage is
between the emigration, and that's it.
   QUESTION: Can we take it then, sir, that Most Favored Nation
status would then be forthcoming if this emigration law is codified?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it,
but the linkage is between the emigration and the _ I mean the trade
agreement linkage is between _ the MFN is hooked into the emigration
law being passed. That's it. We have other trade agreements. We have
other agreements, the grain agreement, and we have a maritime
agreement. And the concern over the difference in position we have
on the Baltics, you might say, affects _ is one of the thorns in the
side of _ an overall relationship. We've always had a difference on
this. We have not recognized the incorporation of the Baltic States
into the Soviet Union. That's been the historic position of the
United States. But that concern, you might say, affects a wide array
of issues that we have with the Soviet Union.
   Frankly, I've been very pleased. First place, I've tried to be
very frank with President Gorbachev, not just here, but before he
came here, saying the difficulties that I faced, and Jim Baker was
very frank with Eduard Shevardnadze saying the problems we face. I
think it is important in this emerging relationship that we share as
directly as we can with the Soviet side, the political problems we
face.
   They've, we've got a Congress that has its rights. They have
every right to look at what I've signed and every obligation to do
that, and make their judgment as to whether it's in the best
interests. I signed the trade agreement because I am convinced that
it is in the best interest to the United States. I believe the same
thing about the grain agreement. I believe the same thing about the
maritime agreement. But I don't want to mislead the American people
and say that I have lessened my concern over the Baltic States. I've
tried to be frank with our, the Soviet side on this. But the linkage
_ back to your question _ with MFN, with trade is on ... emigration
law being passed. And then we go forward.

<HEAD>Newspapers Predict Most Emergency Restrictions Will End in a Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Asociated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major newspapers predicted
Sunday that the 4-year-old national state of emergency will be
lifted next weekend almost everywhere but in Natal province, which
has been plagued by factional fighting.
   The papers said the announcement will be timed to coincide with a
13-nation tour by African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela,
who will visit Europe, Africa, the United States and Canada starting
Monday.
   Revocation of the state of emergency has been a key demand of the
ANC before it agrees to formal negotiations with de Klerk on a
constitution that would set up black-white power sharing.
   The ANC has said foreign governments should not lift economic
sanctions against South Africa until the emergency laws are lifted,
and Mandela is expected to ask that sanctions remain for now.
   The state of emergency was imposed on June 12, 1986, by former
President P.W. Botha to quell nationwide anti-government protests
and political violence that killed more than 2,000 people, most of
them black.
   But since he came to power last August, President F.W. de Klerk
has nullified some provisions of the emergency decrees and says he
intends to dismantle apartheid.
   He has permitted anti-government protests, legalized the ANC and
other banned groups, freed scores of people detained without charge
and lifted most restrictions on news coverage.
   During a trip to Europe earlier this month, de Klerk said he
would review the remaining emergency provisions when they come up
for renewal on June 11.
   They restrict reporting about unrest, some forms of protest and a
broad range of statements the government considers subversive.
   On Sunday, four national newspapers representing a range of
political viewpoints said the state of emergency would be almost
completely lifted.
   ``Most state of emergency measures will be scrapped within the
next few days,'' wrote the anti-government English language Sunday
Star.
   The middle-of-the-road Sunday Tribune said: ``Parts of the
emergency are likely to remain in force, however, particularly in
troubled areas such as Natal.''
   The Afrikaans-language and generally pro-government Rapport, and
City Press, the largest circulation newspaper for blacks, carried
the same news.
   ``The timing of the announcement on the emergency will complicate
Mr. Mandela's position overseas,'' the Sunday Tribune said.
   Mandela's will include stops in Britain, France, Germany,
Ireland, Italy, Botswana, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya and Mozambique.
   Since de Klerk legalized black political groups and freed Mandela
and other prisoners, there has been a surge in violence.
   Supporters of rival black groups have battled one another in
townships nationwide, leaving more than 500 people dead this year.
There has also been an increase in shootings by police, who have
fired on marchers or defended themselves from attacks by crowds in
townships.
   Most of the violence has occurred in Natal, where the emergency
laws have not stopped supporters of the ANC and the Inkatha
organization from fighting each other. In recent years more than
5,000 people have died in the province.
   Mandela has asked the government to use soldiers and police to
stop the factional fighting, and some observers said he agreed
troops should be left in Natal while emergency restrictions were
lifted elsewhere.

<HEAD>Contest Names `Favorite Bureaucrat'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A contest to determine the nation's
``favorite bureaucrat'' found the winning do-gooder not in a haven
of officialdom like Washington, D.C., but in rural Tennessee.
   It wasn't an easy search.
   Matthew Lesko, a best-selling writer and governmental information
access expert, spent a year promoting a contest called ``My Favorite
Bureaucrat.''
   ``I personally thought it was one of the neatest ideas I've ever
had,'' said Lesko, who operates a publishing organization in Chevy
Chase, Md.
   The idea was to get nominations from ordinary folks who had been
helped in some special way by a public servant. The best nominating
letter would win $5,000 and the bureaucrat would get a trophy.
   But after six months, he had received only one nomination _ and
that was from another bureaucrat nominating her boss.
   Lesko's predicament, however, brought true publicity to the
contest. ``Bureaucrats may deserve their bad reputation, after
all,'' wrote The Wall Street Journal.
   Lesko's Information USA Inc. then was flooded with nominations.
More than 1,100 entries poured into the office, staff members said.
   ``I was just so excited,'' Lesko said.
   He heard about a bureaucrat who helped a woman with cancer get
medical attention, one who helped find a father missing for 20
years, another who gave $5,000 in free tax advice and one who gave
free legal help to press a grandmother's sexual harassment charge.
   And then he read the letter from small businessman Charles
``Frosty'' Kimbrough of Morristown, Tenn. This was it, Lesko thought.
   ``I have been in business on my own for seven years,'' wrote
Kimbrough. ``I've had a lot of ups and downs, and at times ready to
give it up.''
   Then last year, Kimbrough wrote, he met Richard McKinney, a
consultant at the Small Business Development Center at Walters State
Community College. The center is partially funded by the federal
Small Business Administration.
   With McKinney's help, ``it's been a great year. My income doubled
and I'm more confident about the future of my business,'' Kimbrough
wrote.
   Kimbrough's company makes picnic tables and cooking grills. His
workforce is himself, his wife and sometimes another worker or two.
   McKinney helped Kimbrough get on a bidding list with the state
parks system, figure his costs, get credit extensions with his
suppliers and locate materials, and showed his wife how to do the
books.
   ``All I had was just a big question mark, you know?'' Kimbrough
said in a recent interview. ``I've never been able to pay anybody to
help me like he has.''
   And when Kimbrough was hurt just as he tried to meet his first
big state contract deadline, McKinney helped paint grills on his own
time to get the order out.
   ``He needed business and I helped bid the stuff. I felt that in
order for him to succeed and get other state orders he had to
deliver on time,'' McKinney said.
   ``The extra personal effort that he did above and beyond the call
of duty really struck me,'' Lesko said.
   But McKinney said it wasn't out of the ordinary.
   ``You can't give very good advice if you sit in an office and
tell a guy how he ought to be doing his business,'' he said. ``If
you do it right, you have to do it because you want to help people.''
   Lesko's contest had two runners-up, each getting a $500 prize.
   Victoria and Rick Coombs of Mesa, Ariz., were second-place
winners for nominating local employment specialist Irvin Gallegos,
who helped a homeless Vietnam veteran and his wife find food,
shelter and a job.
   The other runner-up winner was David Muellenhoff, a University of
California, Berkley, student who nominated Carole Zimmerman of the
Library of Congress. She told him how to preserve his prized comic
book collection.
   Lesko has written about 40 books, including best-sellers
``Information USA'' and ``Getting Yours: The Compete Guide to
Government Money.''
   He said he plans to make the contest an annual event.
   Meanwhile, McKinney has left the bureaucratic ranks.
   ``I took my own advice and went into business,'' he said.

   QUESTION: In connection with this meeting, there was a lot of
speculation about weak and strong points. Somebody speaks from a
position of strength, someone from a position of weakness. How would
you define what a strong position is, a position of strength? What
is the place where factoral force of strength holds? What are the
components of force? What does politics, what makes politics strong?
This is a question that is addressed to both presidents.
   PRESIDENT GORBACHEV: Let me begin first in order to let President
Bush have a little rest. I think this is certain speculation on this
score. Both during the preceding period and in the course of our
talks, we have been acting, representing our peoples and countries,
well aware of what the dialogue is all about. And I think to assume
that someone, myself or President Bush, can dictate to each other,
or to the Soviet Union, is absurd. This would be the greatest
misconception on the basis of which no progress could ever be made.
   I think that this idea is suggested because at this point in
time, the Soviet Union is deep into profound change. And since
fundamental change is involved, we are walking away from one
particular way of life toward different forms of life. We are
changing our political system. We are introducing a new model in
economy. All these are fundamental things, indeed. Debates are under
way, doubts are being expressed, views are being compared, and this
is very important. Because what is at stake is our destiny. Of
course, when you look from outside _ well, we ourselves can feel the
strain of our society. It is very much politicized. But, a look from
outside without knowing all the subtleties, without knowing all the
depth of sentiments, one could certainly arrive at some erroneous
conclusions.
   Hence, the question of, ``How long will Gorbachev stay in his
office?'' and ``How this whole perestroika will end?'' and so on and
so forth, even this, I think, fits into this process of profound
change. And perhaps this is something we cannot do without. But, the
most important thing is that everything is, that is happening
confirms not only the fact that we're cleaning up our courtyard,
we're really revamping our entire society. We are trying to adapt it
to human needs on the basis of freedom and democracy. We want to
make it more open toward the outside world. That is the essence. And
therein, Soviet people do not differ. And I hope there are no
differences on that among the journalistic corps.
   Perhaps some part of society thinks otherwise, but the question
is, how to do all this, to avoid losing everything that we should
keep, and get, jettison everything that we don't need that stands in
the way. I don't think we have ever tackled a task like this in the
history of our country. I don't know whether anybody else has been
able to resolve so many tasks within such a short period of time.
   So, it is for this particular reason that we appreciate so highly
the fact that the whole world understands this greatly. So, from
this particular perspective, I wish to state _ and this goes to show
the farsightedness of President Bush and his colleagues, to say
nothing of (the) American public, which overall understands what is
happening in the Soviet Union today, understands that this is
something that we need above all.
   Of course, it's up to us to solve all these problems, but of
course everybody understands full well that this is something that
the whole world, all the nations need. For without such changes,
without a stronger, balanced, harmonized world, we will not
accomplish our objectives. So today the pivotal point of world
politics is perestroika in the Soviet Union. Not because we are
there, but because this is an objective reality.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: May I simply add that the United States is not
trying to deal from strength or weakness. I tried to say this at the
welcoming ceremony for President Gorbachev. We have a unique
responsibility to deal with world peace. It is, no other countries
have the same degree of responsibility that the Soviet Union and the
United States have. And so we're not looking for winners or losers.
We salute reforms that make our systems more compatible on the
economic side, on the human rights side, the openness side.
   But we're not looking for, for trying to achieve advantage. We
sat down here, one on one, and tried to hammer out agreements and
get closer together on vital matters affecting other countries. And
it is because of the standing of the Soviet Union and the standing
of the United States in the world, that we have responsibilities.
   So I can tell you and all the journalists, from Soviet side,
European journalists, the United States is dealing with mutual
respect here. We salute the changes, of course. But we have a unique
responsibility in the world, and I plan to, one of the things I'm
pleased about in our agreement, is that we will be meeting more
often now, and we can't miss an opportunity to enhance stability and
peace in the world, and I, so that's where I'm coming from on your
question.
   QUESTION: Following on President Bush's comment, on a scale that
had adversaries at one end and allies at the other, would you now
say that each other's country was more of an ally than an adversary?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I think you're, I think, I don't want to get into
semantics. ``Alliances'' have a connotation to some that they might
not have for another. ``Adversaries'' sometimes convey the concept
of hostility or enmity. In my view, we've moved a long, long way
from the depths of the Cold War. We've moved towards a _ I don't
quite know how to quantify it for you _ but we could never have had
the discussions at Camp David yesterday, or as we sat in the Oval
Office a couple of days before with President Gorbachev, 20 years
ago. We all know that. So there's been (a) dramatic move. And the
more this reform and openness takes place, the more compatible the
relationship becomes. Neither of us tried to cover over the
differences. So I know that's too general for you, but that's where
I'd leave it.

   An airliner traveling without passengers
slammed into a fog-shrouded hillside and broke up, injuring all four
crew members who had to be plucked from the wreckage by helicopter.
   The MarkAir Boeing 737 jet crashed about 4{ miles north of the
Unalakleet Airport while on landing approach Saturday.
   Flight attendant Michelle St. Amour, 22, of Anchorage was listed
in critical condition Sunday at Providence Hospital, with a skull
fracture and neck injuries, hospital officials said.
   Capt. Glenn Smith, First Officer Robert Fell and flight attendant
Sonya Nelson were listed in satisfactory condition at the Anchorage
hospital with minor injuries.
   Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation
Safety Board investigators were having trouble getting to the crash
site from Nome for the second straight day because of fog.
   FAA duty officer Victoria Clark in Anchorage on Sunday said it
was too soon to speculate on the cause of the crash.
   The plane had no history of mechanical problems, said Larry
Anderson, a spokesman for the intra-Alaska airline.
   Crew members were the only people aboard the 70-seat Boeing jet
en route from Anchorage to pick up several dozen herring fisherman
at Unalakleet, a small coastal town in central Alaska.
   A helicopter crew transporting fishermen from a nearby ship was
asked to help search for the plane after it failed to arrive on
schedule.
   Searching the ground through the fog that cut visibility to 25
feet, the helicopter crew spotted the wreckage and rescued the
victims.
   ``It looks like a bomb went off up there,'' said helicopter pilot
Tim Enebred.
   The wreckage was strewn over a 300-yard-long area, witnesses said.
   ``By the looks of it, we didn't think there would be any
survivors,'' said rescuer Rick Petre. ``Then we saw a flight
attendant raising her arms.''

<HEAD>Soviet Refuseniks Angry at Gorbachev Emigration Warning to Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet refuseniks reacted angrily to Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's warning Sunday that he might reduce the number of Jews
allowed to emigrate if Israel continues to settle them in the
occupied territories.
   Gorbachev made the comments Sunday at the close of his summit
with President Bush.
   ``The statements from the Soviet president about restriction of
emigration from the U.S.S.R. are not very good for any of us,'' said
Mikhail Shapiro, who has been denied permission to emigrate since
1988.
   Leonid Stonov, a spokesman for refuseniks _ Jews who have been
refused permission to leave the Soviet Union _ said ``it is a human
right to be able to emigrate.''
   ``It is one question to allow someone to leave the country, and
quite another to decide where that person will be allowed to live,''
said Stonov. He said the Kremlin should not determine where
emigrants go.
   He said only ``a rather small number of Soviet Jews settle in the
occupied territories.'' He was referring to the Israeli-occupied
Gaza Strip and West Bank, land Israel captured from the Arabs in the
1967 Middle East War.
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union is at an all-time high,
and 1 million Soviets are seeking to leave.
   About 150,000 are expected to move to Israel this year. Israeli
officials say only about 200 new arrivals have settled in the
occupied lands.
   However, Gorbachev's liberalized emigration policy has not yet
become law, and President Bush says the Supreme Soviet legislature
must pass it before he implements a bilateral trade pact signed at
the summit.
   Last November, the legislature gave preliminary approval to a
bill that would allow emigration for virtually anyone with entry
permission from another country and no outstanding alimony
obligations, criminal charges or recent knowledge of state secrets.
   The bill sets a limit of five years on the period a citizen can
be kept from emigrating because of access to secrets. Jewish
activists, however, say the bill is vaguely worded and could be used
to restrict immigration.
   Shapiro said he was fired from his job as a computer specialist
at a small institute run by the Soviet Academy of Science after
applying to emigrate in 1988. He said he stopped working with
classified material 12 years ago.
   According to lists compiled by the refusenik community, 140
families have been refused permission to emigrate, down sharply from
a few years ago.
   Stonov said Gorbachev's warning ``demonstrates that it is the
good will of the authorities,'' rather than legal changes, that
allows people to emigrate.
   The controversy stems from pressure by Arab governments on
Gorbachev following a recent statement by Israel Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir that his nation wanted more Soviet Jews to settle in
the occupied territories.

<TEXT>
   QUESTION: To President Bush, if I may, to follow up my
colleague's one. Are there circumstances under which you would be
prepared to recommend the total dissolution of NATO? What's the
threat that still keeps it in business?
   PRESIDENT GORBACHEV: How long do you think the transition period
should last before the responsibilities of the four powers run out _
the four victorious powers in World War II?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: You want me to start with that one?
   STAFF: Why don't you answer the first one, why don't you answer
the one?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Me and, all right, the threat, as I looked at the
world, the threat is unpredictability, and stability. How do you, or
instability is the threat. We feel that a continued U.S. presence in
Europe should not be seen as hostile to the Soviet interests, but
indeed we hope a continued U.S. presence there will be seen as
something that's stabilizing. And NATO is the existing machinery
that we feel, with an expanded mission, can best provide that
stability. And herein we have a difference with the Soviet Union.
But it is that, rather than some kind of Cold War mentality, that
drives our decision to one, remain in Europe, and two, to try to
have a broader role for NATO under Article 2 of the NATO Treaty.
There is language put in there, I'm told, by Lester Pearson years
ago that provides a broader than just military assignment for NATO.
So we see this as not exclusive to an expanded role for CSCE, not
contradictory to the aspirations of many Europeans for an expanded
EEC, but as a way in which we can continue without hostility to
anyone to provide a stabilizing presence.
   PRESIDENT GORBACHEV: I'd like to respond to this extremely
important question, if I may. First, as an overall statement of the
fact, it seems to me that if some kind of option is suggested, one
that would replace or would be accompanied by replacing an isolation
on the European continent either of the United States or of the
Soviet Union, then I would say in no uncertain terms, and I could
even make a forecast, that that particular option would be doomed.
It would be doomed in the sense that it would be difficult to put
into effect. But what matters most, it would lead to the
exacerbation rather than improvement in the situation.
   For that reason we believe that we will not be able to make any
further progress in restructuring international relations, including
in the main European area, without an active participation of the
United States of America and the Soviet Union. These are realities.
And there's also a great sense of responsibility behind those
realities. This is the first point.
   The second point now, yes, indeed, we believe that the option
which we think will be found eventually and which will provide a
powerful momentum and which would contribute to the strengthening of
the European process must necessarily include some kind of a
transition period during which we could join our efforts to conclude
a final document, exhausting thereby the rights we are endowed with
as the victorious Four Powers under the results of the Second World
War. These are the issues that were raised by history itself, and so
therefore in the framework of international law it must be brought
to conclusion.
   A concurrent unification of Germany and its presence would mean
the coincidence of these two events. This would mean that this would
be an independent and sovereign state. I really don't know and I
wouldn't like to engage in speculation about the timeliness. But I
think that we must be very, very active now so that, so as to ensure
some kind of synchronization between the internal processes which
lead to the unification of Germany, and the settlement of external
aspects, so that they would be combined.
   I can see, and I offered many options in our position. Those
options are there and it seems to me there are some points, there
are some points the American side has noticed. I am expressing my
supposition. I am not saying that I heard this from (the) president,
but I think they have something to think about, and I think we will
give serious thinking to the U.S. position, too.
   QUESTION: President Gorbachev, on the subject of NATO membership
for a united Germany, you have complained in the past about western
sensitivity to your security concerns. Some of your aides say
privately that Germany, a united Germany, could belong to NATO and
your security concerns could be satisfied both by a limited American
presence in Germany, and primarily by strict limits on German troops
and armaments. The real problem they say is psychological, a matter
of national pride. They say that if you accept Germany in NATO, it
will be a humiliating admission for the Soviet people that you've
lost the Cold War. In your talks with President Bush, were you frank
about this? Is this a problem for you? And President Bush, have you
considered this problem yourself in your own thoughts?
   PRESIDENT GORBACHEV: First, I do not think that whatever I'm
saying on these extremely important question(s) of world politics
appears to be a complaint from me or from the Soviet Union. This
would be humiliating for the Soviet Union to pass his hat around, to
come here to Washington, or to Bonn, or elsewhere. This is out of
the question, and please bear that in mind. This is the first point.
   The second point is, you know, there is a process under way, a
beneficial process, and look how far we have progressed in this
process. We are entitled to raise the question of these terms. Each
subsequent step must strengthen it rather than weaken it. We have a
right to that.
   Take, for example, our negotiations and 50 percent reductions in
strategic offensive arms. If you were, if this whole negotiating
process were to be depicted to you in its entirety, you would
certainly see the kind of battles we are having on each and every
point. Why? Because nobody really wants his security to be
diminished.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev boasted Sunday of their summit rapport and agreed they
should get together more often.
   Gorbachev expressed his ``profound gratification at this work
that we have done together.''
   Bush, retaining a bit of reserve, said, ``Mr. President, it's
been a pleasure having you here, sir.''
   But if they weren't on a first-name basis, it was clear that they
had gotten along well together in four days of talks at the White
House and Camp David.
   Bush said the summit had been so productive that now he and
Gorbachev want to ``get together more often with less formality,''
perhaps annually.
   Gorbachev said he realized the first time he met then-Vice
President Bush in 1987 ``that this is the kind of person to do
business with, to build our relations with.''
   ``Everything began with discovering the fact that President Bush
and myself have a desire to do business informally, which is very,
very important,'' said Gorbachev, who has a reputation as an
all-work-and-no-play politician.
   He extolled the rapport he and Bush developed in their ties-off
dialogue at Camp David, the president's rustic mountaintop retreat
in Maryland.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater described the relationship
between the two leaders this way:
   ``The two guys are very much alike,'' he said. ``When they debate
across a table they see a mirror image. They even have a similar
sense of humor. They make fun of things. They tease each other.''
   For Bush, who originally wanted to take Gorbachev for an
overnight stay at his oceanfront home in Maine, the trip to Camp
David was a triumph for the up-close-and-personal diplomacy he
relishes.
   Bush has done the same thing with other world leaders, getting
Francois Mitterrand, the reserved president of France, out on a
speedboat ride in Kennebunkport, and taking a pleasantly bewildered
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak up to Baltimore to see a baseball
game.
   Beforehand, when Bush pressed to spend a day together informally
at scenic Camp David, some on the Soviet side intimated that
Gorbachev preferred to work, not relax in the great outdoors.
   But the Soviet president clearly savored the time at Camp David,
even tooling through the woods at day's end behind the wheel of a
golf cart, with Bush hanging on precariously in the shotgun seat.
   Gorbachev praised his host ``as a political leader who is able,
in a very human way ... to engage in dialogue and cooperation.''
   ``We now have a good human relationship,'' he said.
   Bush acknowledged they didn't narrow differences on the future of
Germany, ``but the benefit of a meeting like this is, once again,
you can talk in great frankness about it. I have no suspicion about
his position, and I hope he has no suspicion about mine.''
   First ladies Barbara Bush and Raisa Gorbachev, too, appeared to
have become fast friends over the long weekend. They emerged from
the White House arm-in-arm and exchanged kisses on both cheeks as
they bade farewell.
   ``Goodbye, good luck,'' Bush called out as the limousine pulled
away.

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, anxious
for Western expertise and capital to boost his ailing economy, on
Sunday celebrated multimillion-dollar deals signed with Chevron and
IBM.
   Gorbachev said the agreements provided a ``solid pillar of
support'' for a new era of superpower cooperation.
   ``While we and the president were working and our ministers were
also discussing things, there were important contact discussions
with various Americans companies and some important decisions were
made,'' Gorbachev said.
   He mentioned both Chevron and IBM by name in his remarks at a
joint news conference with President Bush wrapping up the four-day
summit meeting.
   The Soviet leader made clear during his Washington visit that he
is hoping to entice many more American companies into doing business
in the Soviet Union. He also planned to meet on Monday with South
Korean President Roh Tae-woo, hoping to boost trading ties between
those two nations as well.
   In addition, Gorbachev said Sunday that he was planning on
traveling to Japan, another capitalist country where the Soviets are
hoping to attract investment support.
   The agreement the Soviets signed with Chevron Corp. on Saturday
would grant the San Francisco-based oil firm exploration rights for
development of the Soviet Union's largest newly discovered oil
field, an 8,900-square-mile region near the Caspian Sea.
   Officials said the reserves of the Tengiz oil field could exceed
25 billion barrels, 2.5 times larger than those on Alaska's North
Slope.
   The agreement will allow Chevron to dispatch a 20-member
technical team to the region.
   The team's findings will form the basis for further negotiations
on a possible joint production agreement with the Soviets, officials
said.
   Gorbachev on Sunday said the Chevron deal had the potential of
being worth 10 billion rubles, which would translate into $6.25
billion at the official currency conversion rate.
   The other agreement signed by the Soviets over the weekend was
for IBM to sell 13,000 personal computers for use in Soviet schools.
   While the purchase price was not disclosed, stock analysts said
the deal could be worth around $25 million to IBM. The company said
that shipments of the computers, which cost between $2,000 and
$3,000 each before subtracting discounts for large purchases, would
start in September.
   Both the Chevron and IBM agreements were examples of commercial
contacts that would be facilitated by the trade agreement signed by
Bush and Gorbachev on Friday. That pact faces an uncertain future in
Congress, where many have insisted it will not gain approval unless
Gorbachev eases economic pressure against the independence movement
in Lithuania.
   In addition to being a necessary first step toward drastically
cutting tariffs on Soviet goods sold in the United States, the trade
agreement would expand opportunities for U.S. companies in the
Soviet Union by reducing red tape and providing greater protections
against copyright piracy.
   Chevron officials stressed that much work would have to be done
before conclusion of a joint venture agreement with a Soviet company
to pump oil from the huge field.
   For one thing, they said there were environmental concerns to
address. The oil field lies along the Caspian Sea, home to the
sturgeon that produce caviar, an important cash export for the
Soviet Union.
   But in the signing ceremony at the Soviet Embassy, Chevron
official Richard H. Matzke said that a joint production venture
between the Soviets and a giant U.S. oil company made a lot of sense.
   ``The Soviet Union is the world's leader in oil production. The
United States is the world's largest consumer of oil,'' he said.

   A PLO official said U.S. policy is pushing the
Middle East into war, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's
political department, also criticized U.S. threats to halt its
dialogue with the PLO if the group does not oust from its governing
body the guerrilla leader who staged a failed seaborne raid on
Israel last week.
   Hani al-Hassan, political adviser to PLO chairman Yasser Arafat,
was quoted as saying that a break in the dialogue would be
``tantamount to rejection of peace in the Middle East.''
   Kaddoumi described current contacts with the United States as
spreading ``illusions about the Palestinian-American relations
rather than a true dialogue.''
   ``We say to the Americans: we don't trust what you are doing
because you are pushing the Middle East to a new war,'' he said in
an interview with the Kuwait daily Al-Watan.
   Kaddoumi lashed out at the United States for its veto Thursday of
a U.N. Security Council resolution that provided for sending an
investigation team to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel
seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
   He vowed to turn the question of sending a Security Council team
to the occupied territories into ``a headache for the United States,
by stirring more Arab protests.''
   Arafat and the PLO have disassociated themselves from the
abortive raid Wednesday on an Israeli beach. Israel foiled the
attack, and four Palestinians were killed and 12 captured.
   Mohammed Abbas, leader of the Palestine Liberation Front, a
faction of the PLO, has claimed responsibility for the operation.
   Arafat has refused to condemn the operation outright and rejected
the U.S. demand to remove Abbas from the PLO executive committee.
   The United States has left the door open to halting direct talks
with the PLO if the demand is not met.
   The dialogue was started following Arafat's explicit renunciation
of terrorism.

   Leaders of the two Germanys said Sunday that
the superpower summit has improved conditions for the unification of
their countries and praised U.S. readiness to expand trade with the
Soviets.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said the summit between
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``has
further improved the international conditions for the unity process
between the Germanys.''
   His foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, and East German
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere also said they saw the summit as
improving conditions for German unity and disarmament.
   ``The resolution of the uttermost aspects of German unity
requires new and far-reaching progress in the CSCE-process, in
disarmament, and in the overall cooperation between West and East,
especially in the area of economics,'' Kohl said in a statement.
   The CSCE, or 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe, deals with military security, economic cooperation and human
rights.
   Kohl said, however, that progress in reducing strategic nuclear
weapons, the beginning of a worldwide ban on chemical weapons and
the ending of nuclear testing were equally important.
   In addition, Kohl said U.S. readiness to expand trade with the
Soviets was of ``psychological importance ... to promote the reform
politics of President Gorbachev.''
   In an interview with West German government TV, Genscher called
the summit ``a great success a great success with it's positive
aspects that will also have postive results on the developments in
Europe.
   ``And that means also for the Europeans and the unification of
Germany, because relations of the two superpowers with each other
have fundamentally improved.''
   De Maiziere, also interviewed by West German TV, said the summit
showed the superpowers were rethinking their approach to security.
   ``The deciding message that I think I heard is that in the area
of stabilizing security they are having new and very different
ideas,'' de Maiziere said of Bush and Gorbachev.
   ``They are trying not to define the security theme militarily _
not end it with rocket counting _ but with considerations of
economic ties, with cultural ties,'' de Maiziere said.
   During their summit, Bush and Gorbachev signed a treaty that
drastically slashes chemical weapons. The two leaders also issued a
statement breaking the deadlock on efforts to reduce long-range
nuclear arms.
   In addition, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and his Soviet
counterpart Eduard Shevardnadze have indicated that prospects for
reduction of conventional forces in Europe had improved. The Soviet
Union had been balking at a plan to cut the superpowers' troops to
195,000 for each side in central Europe.
   Gorbachev, concerned about the military strength of a united
Germany, has opposed Bush's demand that the new nation be a full
member of NATO. The issue was discussed extensively on Thursday, the
first day of the summit, but was set aside so the leaders could
focus on other matters.
   Gorbachev had threatened to review the Soviet defense strategy if
a united Germany insists on joining the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   The West German Foreign Ministry said Baker will meet with
Genscher soon to give him a full report on the summit.
   As of July 2, the two German nations will start to merge their
economies, and the West German mark will replace the virtually
worthless East German currency.
   East Germany's first non-Communist government came to power after
elections in March, following the ouster of hard-line Communist
leaders late last year.

   Norway's 86-year-old King Olav V was partly

doctors said Sunday.
   The king's condition was described as ``unsafe,'' and the next
few days will be decisive, the doctors said in a statement.
   According to the statement, released to the Norwegian national
news agency NTB, the king suffered a stroke Saturday night and the
left side of his body was paralyzed as a result.
   They said that on Sunday he was ``conscious and can speak and
understand.''
   King Olav, the world's oldest ruling monarch, was admitted to the
Rikshospitalet in Oslo Tuesday with a mild infection of the
paracardium _ the sac around the heart.
   Doctors had said Friday the king's condition was satisfactory and
the inflammation was receding. But around midnight Saturday they
reported his condition had worsened.
   Crown Prince Harald, 53, and the king's second daughter, Princess
Astrid, were at the hospital with the king, NTB said. Princess
Ragnhild, his eldest daughter who lives in Brazil, was ill and
unable to return to Norway, the palace said.
   If the stroke incapacitates Olav, Harald would rule in his place
as ``temporary executor of the royal powers,'' according to the
Norwegian constitution.
   Prime Minister Jan P. Syse postponed an official visit to Poland
Sunday because of the king's condition, according to Syse's
spokesman, Finn Langeland.
   King Olav has ruled Norway since 1957. He became the world's
oldest monarch in January 1989 with the death of Japan's Emperor
Hirohito.
   Queen Martha, his Swedish-born cousin and wife, died in 1954. He
never remarried.

<HEAD>Mayor's Drug Trial to Begin Monday Barring Last-Minute Plea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jury selection was to begin Monday in the
cocaine conspiracy and perjury trial of Mayor Marion Barry, but
sources said defense attorneys met with prosecutors over the weekend
to discuss a possible plea bargain.
   Barry is charged with 14 counts of cocaine possession and lying
to a federal grand jury about his involvement with drugs.
   Sources familiar with the case, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Barry's chief attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, U.S.
Attorney Jay B. Stephens and their representatives have met to
explore the possibility of a plea agreement.
   But the 54-year-old mayor last week appeared determined to see
the case through in the courtroom rather than accept an agreement
that would require him to leave office.
   Barry has not said whether he will run for a fourth, four-year
term in November. A recent poll shows that his legal problems have
not significantly eroded his political support.
   Barry was arrested Jan. 18 at a Washington hotel in an FBI sting
operation. FBI cameras taped the operation and Barry later admitted
in a newspaper interview that he had smoked crack cocaine. But he
claimed the government was trying to kill him with a lethal dose of
the drug.
   Prosecutors have investigated Barry before. The government closed
out one probe in 1985, after trying unsuccessfully to prove that
Barry lied to a grand jury when he denied obtaining cocaine from a
former city employee.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: be diminished.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Incidentally, our own position is that we find it unacceptable
that we should have greater security than the United States of
America. In a situation like this, we won't be able to move forward.
I would recommend to all our partners to give some thought to this
position. If decisions are made of the kinds that will cause concern
to the Soviet Union, this would not be beneficial to the Soviet
Union. This would not be beneficial to others as well. So the
question arises. A united Germany, its advent on the horizon, all
this is very important and serious.
   While applauding the Germans' desire to be united, we must, at
the same time, think about ways of preserving the balance that has
been emerging and taking shape for decades. And here is the central
point: If we were to adopt only one point of view, then I would
think that it would not be complete. For it gives rise to concerns,
and if that is the case, then we, if there were no other way out.
But I believe that such a way out will be found, to mutual
satisfaction. But if this were to be the only option _ and some
would like to impose it on us and say that we reject this _ then we
should go back and see where we are. What's happening to our
security? What should we be doing with our armed forces which we are
both reforming and reducing? What should we do about Vienna; how
should we behave there? All these are matters of strategic
importance, for everything happening in Europe is really the highest
level of strategy.
   This is one way, one pathway which gives rise to some doubts or
suspicions, one that can certainly slow down things. There is
another pathway that we are offering. Let it be American or German
or British. We are not claiming to have it as our own. We are
claiming one thing only. We want to see an option that would
strengthen everything in Europe, rather than weaken things.
   As to the second part, it's a question of pride. Well, I'd say
that the problem is not pride, really, if today I have to remind you
once again that we lost 27 million people in the fronts, in partisan
detachments, 27 million people during World War II. And 18 million
people were wounded and maimed. Then I think it's not a matter of
pride but of justice, supreme justice, for these sacrifices of our
people enable us to raise these matters with all nations, and we
have a moral right to do so, so that everything that was obtained at
such tremendous cost, that so many sacrifices would not spell new
perils. So this is what I wanted to say, and I think that this is
what should be said.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: May I just add, Mr. President, may I just simply
add, in answer to your question, the answer is no, because our
policy is not predicated on pride or on humiliation, nor on
arrogance. It is predicated on what do we see, from the U.S.
standpoint, is the best for the future _ best for stability and
peace in Europe and elsewhere. So, it, the considerations that you
ask about have nothing to do with the formulation of U.S. policy on
these important questions. I'm just going to do what I think is best
for the United States and the rest of the free world and the
Soviets. So, we're not dwelling on what you asked about.
   QUESTION: Mr. Gorbachev, you say that you have established new
relations with the United States. Could you tell us how you are
going to develop the process in the area of the Pacific Ocean, and
whether you're going to convene some kind of representative
conference or meeting to discuss those matters with representatives
of different zones?
   PRESIDENT GORBACHEV: It seems to me that I have already expressed
myself in rather great detail on this score. And it also seems to me
that what I said back in Vladivostok, in Krasnoyarsk, remains today,
and I reiterate that approach. This is not a thing of the past, for
the processes are beginning to develop in that region, too, which is
inhabited by billions of people. One way or another, things will be
more complex with due regard for the real specifics over there. We
must act with due regard for those specifics without copying blind
the European process but borrowing something from it.
   At this time I can say that what happened with armaments, with
INF missiles along the border with China, and the kind of dialogue
which is under way now between countries, and, finally, the fact
that we have traveled a certain distance toward a settlement of the
situation in Afghanistan _ all these are signs showing that there is
a positive process emerging over there.
   Of course, I think this road will be longer and more thorny. But
still, it is especially necessary over there because those peoples
need an opportunity to reallocate their resources to overcome a lot
of social problems that have been accumulated. This is number one.
   And number two, I'd like to say that following the intensive
contacts we have had and the dialogue that we're developing with
India and now with China and other countries, such as Indonesia, I
am planning to go on a visit to Japan so as to open that area for
discussion. So we're going to intensify our efforts in that
direction. I wish to say right away that here, too, we must
cooperate with the United States of America. I said this before in
my statements and now, too, I wish to reiterate it once again in the
presence of the president of the United States of America.

<HEAD>Trial of Former `Dairy Princess' Accused of Murder Begins Monday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT IMRIE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former ``dairy princess'' talent contest
winner, accused of strangling another woman in a dispute over the
man both women loved, goes on trial Monday in a case in which the
facts aren't in question but motives are.
   The prosecution contends Lori Esker, 20, strangled Lisa Cihaski,
21, in a fit of jealousy. Marathon County District Attorney Greg
Grau has portrayed Ms. Esker, a college junior who graduated from
high school as an honor student, as a woman unable to control her
rage over the broken romance with Bill Buss, a handsome, 22-year-old
dairy farmer.
   Ms. Esker's version, which she gave investigators, has been that
she acted in self-defense, fearful she could be killed during an
argument with Ms. Cihaski over Buss.
   Friends have said Buss was about to become engaged to Ms. Cihaski
after breaking off a summer romance with Ms. Esker.
   ``Both the defendant and the deceased are the last people on the
face of the earth you would expect to be involved in this kind of
death and that makes the trial unique,'' defense lawyer Stephen
Glynn said.
   Ms. Esker resigned as Marathon County dairy princess _ a award
for leadership and talent in agriculture _ after being charged with
first-degree intentional homicide. The charge carries a mandatory
life prison sentence. She has been free on a $100,000 bond.
   Ms. Cihaski's body was found Sept. 21 in her car at the motel
where she worked near Wausau.
   Investigators for the prosecution and defense have interviewed
more than 150 people about the case, and more than 50 people could
be called as witnesses, said Glynn.
   Jury selection starts Monday in Florence. Marathon County Circuit
Judge Michael Hoover ruled a jury would be selected from Florence
County because of pretrial publicity in Marathon County. Once a jury
is picked, the panel will be transported to Wausau to hear the
testimony.
   Last month, Hoover ruled that statements Ms. Esker gave
investigators, including a confession that she strangled Ms. Cihaski
with a belt, can be used as evidence in the trial.
   ``I don't think there are a whole lot of factual disputes. I
think there are a lot of disputes concerning motivations for certain
things,'' Glynn said. ``I don't think this is a case with a lot of
expert testimony. I don't think it is a case with a lot of esoteric
information floating around.''
   According to police and statements Ms. Esker gave investigators,
Ms. Esker drove on the night of the slaying from the University of
Wisconsin-Park Falls, where she was studying agriculture journalism,
to the Wausau area, intending to patch up differences among herself,
Buss and Ms. Cihaski.
   She drove by the motel where Ms. Cihaski worked and waited in the
parking lot until Ms. Cihaski came out. A fight broke out between
the women when Ms. Esker ``kind of implied'' she was pregnant by
Buss. In fact, she was not pregnant. Ms. Cihaski called Ms. Esker a
``slut'' and grabbed her throat.
   ``I thought she was going to kill me or really hurt me,'' Ms.
Esker told investigators, explaining she grabbed a belt in the back
seat of Ms. Cihaski's car and ``put it around her neck.''
   ``I pushed on her. I don't know if it was the belt or my elbow,''
Ms. Esker said.
   Ms. Esker dumped out Ms. Cihaski's purse, found a mirror and held
it up to her face to see if she was breathing. Ms. Esker also pulled
a ring off the woman's finger.
   Ms. Esker said she thought to herself: ``Oh my God, I killed
her.''
   ``I didn't mean to hurt her,'' Ms. Esker later told police after
Buss identified her as the only person who had recently argued with
Ms. Cihaski. ``I know Lisa knows that.''

   Gov. Mario Cuomo surprised no one Sunday when
he told cheering supporters that he will seek re-election.
   Cuomo, a potential 1992 Democratic presidential contender, was
expected to win virtually unanimous support from delegates at the
state Democratic convention on Monday.
   The popular state chief would then run against Pierre Rinfret, a
millionaire economist and political newcomer chosen by Republicans
last week.
   If he wins, Cuomo would serve his third four-year term as
governor.
   ``The truth is, Matilda and I don't want to do anything else,''
Cuomo said as he and his wife visited the Empire State Plaza
convention center where the Democratic gathering will be held.
   Deborah Ishlon, a Rinfret spokeswoman, said the Republican
candidate would make no immediate comment on Cuomo's re-election
announcement.
   Cuomo refused to promise that he will serve the full four-year
term if re-elected, keeping open the possibility of a 1992
presidential effort.
   ``That wouldn't work at all,'' said Cuomo of such a pledge.
``What would make you believe it?''
   Facing his third straight year of deficits, Cuomo recently
approved a record $1.8 billion tax increase package to keep his
budget balanced.
   The Canadian-born Rinfret has promised to make Cuomo's handling
of New York's economic problems a cornerstone of his campaign. He's
already begun comparing Cuomo to lame-duck Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, who has grappled with state budget problems almost
continuously since he lost the 1988 presidential race.
   Cuomo, 57, is the son of Italian immigrants and grew up behind
his parents' small grocery store in Queens.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: of America.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   QUESTION: This question is directed at President Bush, but
President Gorbachev, feel free to join in, of course. Mr. President,
about six weeks ago, you suggested that your patience was nearing an
end in regards to the Lithuanian situation. I was wondering if
that's still the case. If not, what has changed? And specifically,
have you received any assurances that the embargo will be lifted?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: No, there have been no such assurances. I'm not
sure anything has changed. I don't recall placing it that ``my
patience is nearing an end.'' But I have tried to make clear to
everybody that we have not recognized the incorporation of these
Baltic States into the Soviet Union, and, therefore, we have a
difference with the Soviet Union. They consider this an internal
matter and we say that, having not recognized the inclusion, why we
have a different problem.
   But we had some good discussions of this. I have been encouraged
to see discussions going on over there between various leaders, and
let's hope the matter can be resolved because I haven't lessened my
view as to peoples' aspirations for self-determination. And I feel
strongly about that. That's a hallmark of American belief and
policy. And I haven't changed one bit on that. But I would turn it
over to President Gorbachev who has a different view on it.
   PRESIDENT GORBACHEV: I really don't even know what I can tell you
now, because two days ago in a meeting with representatives of
congressional leadership, I explained our position in great detail.
It seems to me that our position is constructive and convincing. Our
constitution has recorded the right for each people to make a choice
for sole determination up to and including secession. We did not
have laws or legislation that would regulate, we did not have a
mechanism that would regulate the implementation of that right. Now
we have it recorded in the law. So, we are reforming our federation.
We are expanding the republics' sovereign rights. And we hope that a
full federation is something that we are in vital need of to resolve
all the problems that have been accumulated. This is our conviction.
This is the way we're acting.
   And shortly in the next few days, there is to be a federation
council meeting convened to consider specific steps, dates, and ways
of resolving this particular problem in specific, concrete terms.
Perhaps this particular process will develop in a way that would
imply the presence of different levels of federative ties, just like
various ties or links between the republics. This will be a new
process, new forms of links, of the kind that would be in consonant
with the purposes of our perestroika, with the goals of reforming
our federation. This is one direction.
   If, nevertheless, in the framework of this process, some republic
or other is going to raise this question _ and I am sure they will _
they must be addressed and dealt with in the framework of the
constitutional process. We want to see this happen precisely on the
basis of the Constitution. Any other different approach leads only
to an impasse. And the experience that we have by now, not only with
respect to Lithuania, but also with respect to other republics, in
terms of dealing with ethnic problems where some people are trying
to resolve the problem by different methods, without due regard for
the Constitution, leads to exacerbation, aggravation and
confrontation. And this is not beneficial either for people, for
their families, or for the economy, or for the overall atmosphere in
our country.
   The president of the Soviet Union, just like the president of the
United States of America _ and I happen to know the American
Constitution _ have as one of their main responsibilities to defend
and protect the constitutional system. I swore an oath of allegiance
to the Constitution, and for that reason we are prepared and willing
to address any issue including those that have been raised by the
Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR in the framework of the
Constitutional process.
   This implies a referendum, incidentally. As to the referendum,
those who have engineered this kind of solution, if I may say so,
regarding the statehood of Lithuania, will also address our own
option, and let the people decide. After they make a choice, I'm
sure no fewer than five or seven years would be required for us to
sort things out. There will be this divorce proceedings under way,
for there are 800,000 known Lithuanians who live over there.
Defense, missiles, navy, they're all there. Today, Lithuania's
territory includes five areas that used to belong to Byelorussia.
Stalin ceded Klaipeda which the Soviet Union, on the basis of the
result of World War II, received just as it did Kaliningrad and
Eastern Prussia. It received Lithuanian territory. So they raised
this question to return to Russia these lands.
   Recently the president of France _ I held a press conference with
President Mitterrand of France just as I'm doing now with President
Bush here. And I said, ``Listen, in order to make a decision how to
act with respect to overseas territories such as Caledonia, France
has projected a period of 10 years. How is it possible for us to
resolve issues such as this overnight, when people met pending the
opening of the Third Congress of People's Deputies and put the
question to the vote?'' Is that a responsible policy, really, I ask
myself?
   I really think that we are acting in accordance with a mandate
from the Third Congress of People's Deputies, and we have a vast
reserve of goodwill and constructive spirit. And we do our best in
order to resolve on the basis of constitutional approaches this
particular issue. But any other way would be unacceptable.
   I keep referring to _ well, I'm not asking the president to come
over to us and bring order into our house, but I keep saying that
President Bush would have resolved an issue like this within 24
hours, and he would have restored the validity of his constitution
within 24 hours on any state.
   But we are going to resolve it. We are going to do it ourselves.
With full responsibility I wish to declare here now, for all of you
to know, that we are anxious to see this issue resolved in such a
way as everybody's interests would be taken into account, and within
the constitution's framework.

<HEAD>Kiska Volcano Erupts After 21-Year Dormancy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The remote volcano that formed the tiny
island of Kiska in the Aleutian chain has reawakened after 21 years
of dormancy.
   The volcano erupted for several hours Friday, throwing a cloud of
steamy ash thousands of feet skyward over the Bering Sea, witnesses
said.
   Kiska Island, is an uninhabited island that was occupied by
Japanese military forces in World War II and later made a national
historic landmark.
   It is located about 100 miles east of Attu Island, the
westernmost tip of the Aleutian Chain.
   Witnesses 60 miles to the east at a U.S. Navy station on Amchitka
Island first spotted the white steam clouds at about 10 a.m. They
reported watching the steam mix with a dark cloud of ash until
weather conditions obscured the view about three hours later.
   Reeves Air Capt. James Fredenhagen, who took off from Amchitka at
about 3 p.m., said he saw a small plume of steam was rising slowly
from the 4,000-foot Kiska Volcano.
   ``I classify it as a mild eruption,'' he said. ``We caught sight
of it at 7,000 feet. You could see the haze. ... It appeared to be
coming from the crater.''
   Kiska is one of 40 active volcanos in the Aleutian Chain, said
Victoria Avery, a University of Alaska graduate student working at
the Alaska Volcano Observatory.
   The observatory doesn't monitor Kiska Volcano and must rely on
reports from pilots and other witnesses for information, Ms. Avery
said.
   ``As far as magnitude, it doesn't seem to be a major explosive
event,'' she said.
   The last eruption noted at the mountain was in 1969, when six
days of venting sent lava flowing over island tundra. Kiska Volcano
also was active from January 1962 to March 1964, spilling magma and
spewing ash.
   Another dormant Alaska volcano, Redoubt, came to life last
December after a 25-year slumber. It has spewed ash periodically
since then. Redoubt is 115 miles southwest of Anchorage.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to the American
heartland on Sunday recalled Nikita S. Khrushchev's trip to Iowa in
1959 _ both Soviet leaders were looking for ideas to rescue their
failing farms back home.
   Khrushchev returned to the Soviet Union and ordered many farmers
to plant corn _ like Roswell Garst did on his farm that Khrushschev
toured near Des Moines _ in place of the usual wheat.
   The corn did not fare well on Soviet farms, all of which lie
substantially to the north of the American corn belt. In fact, the
44th parallel cuts across the very southern tip of the Soviet Union.
   But climate is only part of the reason that Soviet agriculture is
so inefficient, that food is rationed in many parts of the country
and that the nation every year must import so much American and
Canadian wheat.
   Much of the problem lies in the collectivized system of land
ownership and the government-owned distribution system that
Gorbachev's reforms are just beginning to change.
   Gorbachev said in Washington on Friday that when he began his
reforms five years ago he was naive to think minor tinkering with
the Soviet system would fix the economy.
   ``There was no incentive. There was no motivation for people to
work,'' he said.
   Waste is a big problem. Gorbachev has said 25 percent of his
country's crops are lost in harvest and storage. Soviet economists
have estimated that from 50 percent to 75 percent of the potato
crop, a staple of the meat-poor diet, rots or is lost before it gets
to the table.
   Gorbachev has pushed through the legislature a law allowing
long-term leases of farmland and limited forms of private ownership.
   So far reformers have been unable to enact legislation that would
allow private individuals to own farmland, sell it to whom they
choose and leave it to their heirs.
   In 1913, four years before the Bolshevik Revolution, Tsarist
Russia exported 12 million tons of grain. Historians write that most
of the peasants, who made up 82 percent of the population, were poor
and that a primitive communal system led to small farms and poor
yields.
   But Soviet commentators are now writing that agriculture took a
turn for the worse when dictator Josif Stalin collectivized
agriculture in 1929-32. Millions of people starved in the resulting
famine and livestock herds did not return to 1913 levels until three
decades later.
   A disproportionate number of Soviet people remain on the farm:
24.6 million out of a population of 280 million, versus 2.9 million
in the United States, with 245 million people.
   The Soviet collectives are overstaffed and need farm machinery
and general reorganization that allow U.S. farm to work with fewer
people.

   The victim's names were withheld until family could be notified.
   The Beechcraft Bonanza, which was headed for the Oakland Pontiac

National Weather Service meteorologist Chuck DeFever in Ann Arbor.
   The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating.

   Eager to propose marriage in a big way,
Chris Booth popped the question to longtime sweetheart Donna Hagan
with a message on a billboard.
   The red, white and blue sign just off the highway reads, ``Donna,
Will you marry me? Chris.''
   ``I just wanted to do something different,'' said Booth, 22.
``We've been dating so long.''
   Booth said he and Ms. Hagan, 23, first became sweethearts about
10 years ago.
   He made sure she saw the billboard Friday night by taking her for
a ``little drive'' past the sign located near the junction of the
U.S. Highway 60 Bypass and U.S. Highway 431.
   ``I was very, very surprised,'' Ms. Hagan said later. ``It took

would take an awful lot to make me cry, but it worked.''
   She didn't make Booth wait for a billboard reply, saying ``yes''
on the spot.

   A speeding British doubledecker bus taking
vacationers home from Spain burst a tire Sunday and flipped over
along a French highway, killing 11 people and injuring 61, police
said.
   A French official said the bus driver was going 78 mph at the
time of the crash.
   The blowout happened along the main north-south highway, police
said. The bus swerved into a ditch, tumbled onto its side and slid
more than 300 feet before coming to rest in a wheat field.
   Police said many of those who died were hurled from the vehicle.
A trail of suitcases, handbags and personal belongings littered the
roadside.
   ``Several bodies were trapped under the bus,'' said an off-duty
police officer who witnessed the accident. ``We saw them through the
windows but couldn't do anything.''
   ``All of a sudden, there was a big bang,'' said passenger
Samantha Howes, 17, of Wordsley in central England, from her
hospital bed. ``The coach veered off the motorway, started to keel
over. It was chaos. Everyone was running around screaming, crying.''
   Dozens of rescue workers used cranes and other heavy equipment to
lift the smashed bus in a four-hour operation to extract survivors.
   At least 22 people were reported in serious condition; 39
suffered minor injuries. Helicopters and ambulances carried them to
hospitals in Auxerre, 100 miles south of Paris, and nearby Sens,
Joigny and Montargis.
   ``All those in the front were either killed or badly knocked
about,'' said passenger Norman Wood.
   Another passenger said the bus looked as though it had been
``torn apart by a bomb.''
   The British Foreign Office said the bus was carrying 69
passengers, six guides and the driver. British authorities confirmed
that several children were on board but could not supply a precise
figure.
   Most of the tourists were from the Midlands or Liverpool in
Britain, police said.
   The tourists were returning from holiday resorts along Spain's
Mediterranean coast, said British Consul-General James Daly. French
officials said the bus was bound for Birmingham.
   Secretary of State for Transport Georges Sarre of France said the
driver, who was seriously injured in the crash, was traveling at 78
mph, 22 mph above the speed limit. Sarre said the high speed made
the accident worse than it would have been otherwise.
   The British Department of Transport sent two engineers to France
to help with the investigation.
   The bus company, Montego European Travel of Wetley Rocks,
Staffordshire, England, started business in April with two buses.
Montego leased them to Pineda Holidays of Telford.
   Linda Baddeley, one of the Montego European Travel's three
directors, said the bus involved in Sunday's crash was ``absolutely
roadworthy'' and had been inspected recently.
   It was the worst bus accident in France since July 30, 1982, when
53 people were killed when their tourist bus caught fire in a
chain-reaction collision near Beaune in southern France.

   They cocked their heads and bellowed. But
this wasn't just any barnyard talk.
   About three dozen people competed in the 42nd annual National Cow
Calling Contest, where the only real beef was on the barbecue grill.
   ``Volume is the key,'' Dana Brown said after picking up the
women's title. ``They (the judges) are out there in the field and
they want to be able to hear it.''
   Ms. Brown, of Baytown, was awarded a plaque and $50 for her loud,
long bovine beckoning in front of about 1,000 onlookers. She was
raised on a farm and explained that cow calling comes with the
territory.
   ``I grew up doing it. It's just entertainment. It's something we
like to do,'' Ms. Brown said. ``It's Texas.''
   Jane Bright, winner of the grandmother's division, agreed that
loudness brings success, and she's had plenty of practice.
   ``I have boys,'' said the woman who lives in Miami, about 80
miles northeast of Amarillo. ``It's from raising boys.''
   It was Ms. Bright's first victory in the grandmother's division,
though she placed second two years ago. She has two previous women's
division titles, but conceded she's never tried her talent on a cow.
   ``I've just done it on stage,'' she said.
   Saturday's contest was a smorgasbord of competitors' unique
renditions of the traditional yell. Some were one syllable. Some
were as many as four. There was the long, slow whine and the almost
operatic tenor.
   Hometown contestant Charles Byrum won the men's division, using a
special front-legged stance.

<HEAD>Thatcher Welcomes `Olive Branch' from Iran</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, grasping what she
called ``a significant olive branch'' from Iran, expressed deep
respect for Islam on Sunday and said Britain is anxious to resume
diplomatic ties.
   Mrs. Thatcher, however, speaking on the BBC radio, stopped well
short of meeting Iran's demand to condemn British writer Salman
Rushdie's book, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Instead, she urged Moslems not to put ``too much stress'' on the
book, which had been decried as blasphemous and provoked a death
threat from the founder of Iran's Islamic Republic, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Iran has said ``The Satanic Verses'' is the main obstacle to
restoring diplomatic ties and to Tehran helping to secure the
release of British hostages in Lebanon.
   On Friday, however, the Iranian foreign ministry
director-general, Hussein Musavian, said Iran was prepared to
discuss the Rushdie dispute and a possible resumption of diplomatic
ties, provided Britain first makes clear ``that it respects Islam
and Moslems and condemns insults to Islam'' such as those in
Rushdie's book.
   No such olive branch was offered to the United States by another
Iranian official Sunday.
   Former interior minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, now an influential
hard-line member of parliament, said establishing U.S. diplomatic
relations is against Islamic principles, even to get back Iranian
assets frozen by the United States.
   He spoke on the first anniversary of Khomeini's death as a power
struggle simmered between moderates and hard-liners in Iran.
   Mass demonstrations were planned in Tehran on Monday to honor
Khomeini.
   ``There are those who say it is necessary to have good relations
with the United States if we want to reconstruct our economy and get
our assets and military spare parts back,'' Mohtashemi said in an
interview with the daily Kayhan made available to The Associated
Press in Cyprus.
   ``This is precisely against the standards of and values of the
revolution and the thoughts of the Imam (Khomeini).''
   Mrs. Thatcher said the offer to Britain reached her through news
reports, and she had no additional information. Asked whether she is
now more optimistic about the hostages' release, the prime minister
replied:
   ``I never like to raise false hopes ... (but) it looks as if we
have a new, significant olive branch put out to us.
   ``Anything that we can properly do _ we have the greatest respect
for Islam, the greatest possible respect,'' she added during the
hourlong phone-in on the BBC's World Service. ``We can't stop
freedom of speech in our country.''
   Musavian, meanwhile, denied a report in London's Sunday Times
that Iran had withdrawn Khomeini's call to Moslems in February 1989
to kill Rushdie.
   ``Neither I nor any other Iranian official, or indeed the
government, has the power to revoke that decree,'' Musavian told the
AP in Tehran.
   Iran severed diplomatic relations with Britain in February 1989
after Khomeini issued the decree to Moslems, and Britain refused to
ban the book or condemn Rushdie.
   Rushdie, a naturalized Briton who was born in India to a Moslem
family, has been hiding under police guard since the death threat.
   Mrs. Thatcher on Sunday also made no direct reference to ``The
Satanic Verses'' or to the Khomeini death threat.
   But she said it was Iran which had broken off relations and ``we
have been anxious to start talks again to restore diplomatic
relations.''
   The British hostages in Lebanon are Church of England envoy Terry
Waite, journalist John McCarthy, teacher Brian Keenan who also has
Irish nationality and retired fighter pilot Jack Mann. A fifth
Briton, writer Alec Collett, is reported to have been killed.
   In addition, six Americans, two West Germans, two Swiss and an
Italian are missing.
   Most of the Westerners are believed held by pro-Iranian Moslem
captors.

<TEXT>
   President Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev may be
hailing a new era in superpower cooperation, but a still-skeptical
Congress is moving toward confronting the Soviet Union on Lithuania.
   It's doubtful that Gorbachev can win the trade concessions from
the United States he has lobbied for so hard without a gesture in
return on his part on Lithuania.
   Lack of major progress on the Baltic stalemate guarantees that
substantial congressional opposition will continue to the trade pact
that Bush and Gorbachev finalized during their four-day summit that
ended Sunday.
   And, even as Bush was asserting that there was no link between
the agreement and Lithuania, his aides were suggesting he would take
another look before sending the measure to Congress.
   At the joint news conference that ended the summit, Bush was
reminded that he had said six weeks ago his patience was wearing
thin on the Kremlin's hardline approach in the Baltics.
   But he showed no inclination to repeat such a comment, though
conceding Gorbachev had given him no assurances that Moscow was any
closer to lifting its economic embargo on Lithuania.
   ``I'm not sure anything has changed,'' Bush said.
   Congressional opposition to granting new trade concessions to the
Soviets cuts across party lines _ and some of the most outspoken
criticism comes from Bush's own Republican Party. Congress is
proving far less patient than Bush on the issue.
   Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kans., contends the Senate
needs ``some fairly ironclad assurances'' from Gorbachev that
Lithuania will gain independence _ assurances he didn't grant.
   Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-NY., has vowed an all-out battle
against granting trade benefits to Moscow. ``We are in the strongest
position we've ever been in'' with respect to the Soviet Union,
D'Amato asserts. ``We should not be giving them everything they ask
for to bail them out.''
   Thus, if Bush sent the measure to Capitol Hill immediately, he
would do so knowing its chances were poor.
   For his part, Gorbachev reiterated Soviet dogma that the Baltic
crisis is an internal one. And he suggested that Bush would act to
restore constitutional order ``within 24 hours'' had a U.S. state
declared its independence.
   Those remarks may play well for Gorbachev at home, but don't seem
likely to help his case with a still-skeptical U.S. Congress.
   Bush asserted anew on Sunday that, as far as he was concerned,
Lithuania had no bearing on the trade agreement he signed at the
summit with Gorbachev. ``That's it,'' he said.
   The president says he placed only one condition on the trade
pact: that Moscow must pass a liberalized emigration law before he
will send the agreement to Congress. The trade measure would open
the way for granting Moscow most-favored-nation status and the lower
tariffs that come with it.
   At the same time, despite Bush's public pronouncements, there
seems little doubt to anyone in Congress or in the administration
that approval of the trade treaty is solidly linked to Lithuanian
independence.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, said Sunday that it would
be ``very difficult in the current situation'' to get congressional
approval of the trade measure.
   And White House Chief of Staff John Sununu was even more blunt.
   ``There is no way the president of the United States is not going
to consider a whole host of issues as he determines whether or not
to send'' the trade agreement'' to Congress, Sununu said.
   Sununu, interviewed on ABC's ``This Week with David Brinkley,''
responded to a question on whether Bush would consider Gorbachev's
attitude toward the Baltic state in making a final decision on trade
_ despite the president's own assertion that there was no linkage.
   ``There is going to be linkage with a whole host of issues,''
Sununu added.
   Although it wasn't publicly stated by any participants at the
summit, Bush's decision to throw a major political gift Gorbachev's
way _ the trade agreement _ could mean that Bush now expects a favor
in return.
   And that favor could be a lightening up on Lithuania by the
Kremlin _ a gift that might be hard for Gorbachev to deliver, but
which would certainly go a long way toward sealing the new
atmosphere of cooperation both leaders proclaimed at the summit.
   Bush has called the Lithuanian deadlock a ``thorn in the side''
of otherwise warming U.S.-Soviet relations.
   There was a glimmer _ just a glimmer _ that something might be
afoot towards resolution of the problem in Gorbachev's closing
remarks at Sunday's joint news conference.
   His assertion that a high-level council would be convened ``in
the next few days'' to press the search for concrete solutions was
being scrutinized by U.S. analysts to see if it represented any new
movement.
   And, while the initial assessment was unclear, it might have been
Gorbachev's version of one of Bush's favored phrases: ``Stay tuned.''

   Suspected Moslem militants killed two
paramilitary officers Sunday, and Indian forces searching for the
attackers burst into a house and shot to death two people, news
reports and witnesses said.
   One of those killed by the security forces was a 6-year-old boy,
witnesses reported. Eight people were reported wounded.
   The latest deaths in the far northern region of Kashmir brought
to at least 490 the number of people killed since India began a
crackdown on a Moslem separatist movement here on Jan. 20.
   Most of the dead have been Moslem militants or their supporters,
who want to create a separate nation in the Kashmir valley between
Pakistan and India.
   Sunday's violence broke out when Moslem militants lobbed a
grenade at a patrol of Central Reserve Police Force officers in the
city of Srinagar, witnesses said.
   Four officers were injured and two later died in the hospital,
the United News of India news agency reported.
   Security forces then sealed off the neighborhood, burst into
several houses and opened fire, said the witnesses, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The 6-year-old boy and a 22-year-old man were killed in the same
house, witnesses said.
   Also Sunday, an Indian journalist who covers Kashmir for Western
news agencies was released from military custody after a day in
detention.
   The journalist, Yusuf Jameel, said the soldiers tied his hands
behind his back and interrogated him. He said he was not injured,
however.
   The government, which initially denied military involvement,
later acknowledged that troops were responsible.
   Minister of State for Home Affairs Subodh Kant told reporters
that military units detained Jameel during the investigation of a
suspected Moslem militant.
   Kashmir is claimed by both Pakistan and India, and the region is
divided by a cease-fire line. The two countries have fought two wars
over Kashmir.
   India claims Moslem-dominated Pakistan arms and trains the
militants. Pakistan denies the charges and says India is trying to
crush a movement for self-determination.
   About 64 percent of the state's 6 million people are Moslem.
Nationwide, Moslems account for 12 percent of India's 880 million
people, and Hindus make up 82 percent.

   The archbishop of San Salvador
on Sunday said the year-old government of President Alfredo
Cristiani has failed to bring reform and has worsened the plight of
the poor.
   ``I believe that (Cristiani) is working to maintain the system,
favoring a market economy which is making the poor yet poorer,''
Monsignor Arturo Rivera Damas said during his Sunday homily.
   Cristiani, 42, took office June 1, 1989, after defeating his
centrist Christian Democratic opponent. He called for the coming
year to be ``the year of peace'' after 10 years of war with rebels
of the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   ``Only if 1991 is the year of justice, the year to respect the
dignity of mankind, the year that ends impunity, only then will 1991
be the year of peace that we all want,'' the Roman Catholic
archbishop said.
   By impunity, he was apparently referring to death squads, which
have summarily executed many union, church and peasant leaders. Few
people have been convicted of such crimes.
   More than 71,000 people, most of them civilians, have died in the
civil war.

<HEAD>Frederick's of Hollywood Founder Dies at 76</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT JABLON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frederick Mellinger, whose Frederick's of
Hollywood introduced racy lingerie to a post-war America squeezed
into white girdles and boring briefs, has died of pneumonia. He was
76.
   The purveyor of colorful, risque underwear that included satin
bustiers, edible panties and peekaboo bras died Saturday night at
his home, family attorney Morton Field said Sunday.
   Mellinger said his success came because ``sex appeal is always in
style.'' Born in the Lower East Side of New York City, Mellinger got
his start when he lied about his age _ then 14 _ to get a clerical
job at an ``intimate apparel'' firm where he learned the art of
mail-order merchandising.
   In 1946 he opened Frederick's Fifth Avenue in New York, a
mail-order business selling products that his World War II Army
buddies told him their girlfriends would like.
   A year later Mellinger moved the store to the West Coast, where
the bright purple Art Deco-style headquarters on Hollywood Boulevard
became a landmark.
   The firm went public in the 1970s and is traded on the American
Stock Exchange. There are now 160 Frederick's stores and sales
topped $80 million last year, said Ellen Appel, a publicist who has
worked for Frederick's.
   Mellinger was the guiding spirit of the company, designing
brassieres with names like ``Rising Star'' and ``Cadillac,'' and
teaching himself French, Spanish and German to deal with European
suppliers personally.
   ``He truly revolutionized lingerie in this country,'' Ms. Appel
said. ``When other people were making traditional, white, boring
lingerie, he was making very glamorous lingerie.''
   ``Our clothes cosmetize a woman's body,'' Mellinger said in an
Associated Press interview in 1983. ``They don't just cover the
body, they take the good parts and enhance them.''
   Catalogues featuring scantily-clad models and offering sex toys,
body oils and x-rated videos were mailed to thousands of U.S. homes,
making Frederick's of Hollywood a household name.
   From the 1950s to the more liberated '60s and '70s, Frederick's
continued to offer its collection of inflatable and ``pointed
missile'' bras, garter belts and G-strings.
   ``He stuck by his principles,'' Ms. Appel said. ``Women in the
'70s, during the heights of the liberation movement, were picketing
Frederick's of Hollywood.
   ``He used to say, `Fashions may change, but sex appeal is always
in style.'''
   These days, Madonna and other entertainers flaunt
Frederick's-style lingerie during live performances and department
stores have begun to stock clingy ``unmentionables.''
   But styles do change, and in later years some of Frederick's
stock-in-trade came to seem dated and tacky, rather than risque. In
1984, the firm suffered its first yearly loss, a $148,000 shortfall.
   Mellinger stepped down as chairman and chief executive, replaced
by George Townson. Townson set about changing Frederick's image.
   In current catalogues, Frederick's no longer offers sex aids,
bondage devices and x-rated videos. Tasteful clothing and underwear
are worn by wholesome-looking models.
   And last fall, the purple Hollywood headquarters was painted gray.
   Private services were scheduled for Monday in Los Angeles.
Mellinger is survived by his wife, Harriett, a son, daughter, and
five grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   Archaeologists have unearthed seven
2,600-year-old winged bulls and other artifacts in the first major
discovery for many years at the ancient Assyrian capital of Nineveh,
state television said Sunday.
   Manhal Jabur, chief of archeology in the northern city of Mosul,
was quoted on television as saying the discovery will shed important
light on the Assyrian civilization that extended from the Persian
Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea in the first millennium B.C.
   The television quoted Jabur as saying the discovery was made
several days ago by an Iraqi team in downtown Mosul, close to the
wall of ancient Nineveh.
   The artifacts found in the palace of King Esarhaddon, all
believed to be 2,600 years old, included the huge winged bulls, two
other large statues and other important findings.
   Esarhaddon, who ruled from 681-669 B.C., rebuilt Babylon after it
was conquered and destroyed by his father, Sennacherib.
   The son, known for mastery of both military force and diplomacy,
conquered Egypt, defeated Pharaoh Taharqa and seized his capital,
Memphis.
   Scores of Iraqi and foreign archaeological teams have dug at
Nineveh, about 250 miles north of Baghdad, since British explorer
Henry Layard uncovered huge stone sculptures and inscriptions in the
nearby Assyrian capital of Nimrud in the 1840s.
   Jabur said the seven stone bulls, which were considerably
damaged, were found at the southern gate of Esarhaddon's palace.
   Assyrian kings used winged bulls to decorate the entrances of
their palaces as if they were guards. The seven bulls are marked
with cuneiform inscriptions.
   Jabur said one statue represents a human body that could be the
legendary Sumerian hero Gilgamish. He is holding a lion's head in
his right hand and a sword in his left.
   Other artifacts found in the site were identified as tablets and
inscriptions that could contain important information about the
Assyrian king and his era.

   Anti-Gorbachev protesters chanting ``Free!
Free!'' and waving Baltic republic flags greeted the Soviet
president as he arrived at the Minnesota governor's mansion Sunday.
   When Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, emerged from their
limousine near the mansion at 2:25 p.m., they approached about 200
protesters, some of them waving flags of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia, but did not talk to them. The Soviet leader is known for
his forays into crowds to shake hands and chat.
   ``He's a very charming man, but you have to remember he does have
iron teeth,'' said Karin Berkholtz, a Latvian among the protesters.
   Berkholtz said she objects to Gorbachev's efforts to thwart
movements for independence by the Baltic states. Other protesters
expressed contempt for Soviet interference in Afghanistan and
discrimination against Jews.
   Protest signs said, ``Hands off the Baltics,'' ``Gorby go home,''
``United Afghan Association,'' ``Stop deadly designs in
Afghanistan'' and ``End Russian imperialism.''
   Sen. Dave Durenberger, a Minnesota Republican in the Gorbachev
motorcade, said the friendly crowd shouting out welcomes to the
Soviet leader outnumbered protesters.
   ``Some people have some kind of a message to get across and they
use these occasions for the message,'' Durenberger said, ``but 99
percent of Minnesotans I think are pretty excited that he made the
decision to come to Minnesota.''
   Outside the state Capitol, some protesters in a crowd of about
1,000 sang songs in Baltic languages.
   ``Maybe he does have some good intentions, but he doesn't show
them,'' said Karlis Lubuzis of Robbinsdale, leader of the Latvian
Welfare Association of Minnesota. ``He has a better reception in the
United States and other countries than in his own.''
   About 5,000 people of Baltic descent live in the Twin Cities.

   Students at Beijing University hurled bottles and
bricks from dormitory balconies at security forces Sunday night and
rallied on campus, shouting ``Get rid of (Premier) Li Peng!''
   The protest came on the anniversary of last year's June 3-4 army
attack on pro-democracy demonstrators, including students from
Beijing University and other schools. Hundreds and possibly
thousands of people were killed.
   The protest was the strongest such demonstration since the
crackdown.
   To prevent commemorations, soldiers and police imposed the
heaviest security Beijing has seen since martial law was lifted in
January. Many students had said they were too afraid to commemorate
the anniversary.
   That was not the case in Hong Kong, where tens of thousands of
Chinese demonstrated. ``We won't forget June 4'' and ``We are not
scared,'' banners read in Hong Kong, which reverts to Chinese rule
in 1997. Police said 100,000 people joined the march; organizers
said more than 200,000 rallied.
   Smaller demonstrations were held in Taiwan, Japan, Britain,
Canada and the United States.
   In Beijing, convoys of police vehicles with flashing lights and
soldiers on foot circled the university district all evening, while
security forces checked vehicles at major intersections.
   Witnesses said the protest began when a small group of graduate
students hurled bottles, rusty bicycle wheels and other objects at
security forces on the street beneath their dormitory windows.
   The students then marched to other dormitories, gathering
hundreds of supporters and singing the Internationale _ the theme
song of the international socialist movement that was frequently
sung by last year's student protesters.
   Several students made speeches calling for an end to corrupt
government and respect for intellectuals. One student demanded that
land be returned to the peasants and factories to the workers.
   Students shouted ``Get rid of (Premier) Li Peng!'' Of all the
Chinese leadership involved in the crackdown, Li is the most widely
blamed and hated.
   Witnesses said at least one speaker was taken away by
plainclothes police, and that the students dispersed peacefully soon
after that.
   Soldiers and police armed with automatic weapons sealed off the
streets around the campus. Security forces detained about a dozen
foreign journalists who had just left the campus, and forced them to
line up against a wall, according to one American in the group.
   ``Guns were in our faces,'' the American said on condition of
anonymity. He said the security officials knocked Los Angeles Times
correspondent David Holley to the ground and hit his wife, Fumio,
before allowing the group to leave. The Holleys later were detained
again but released after 15 minutes.
   Earlier Sunday, three Chinese made small, public protests on the
edges of Tiananmen Square, which last year's protesters occupied for
weeks.
   One man approached a Canadian Broadcasting Co. television crew
and tried to display a protest poster. Police immediately dragged
him away, as he shouted to bystanders in Chinese, ``Rise up.''
   The Canadian reporters said they were able to read only the
opening words of his poster: ``To all foreign journalists, we have
invented a new philosophy ...''
   Hours later, someone threw handfuls of white paper money _ a
traditional offering to the dead _ from a car as it drove past the
square. Police immediately tried to shoo away bystanders and pick up
the paper.
   Police also took into custody a woman who stuffed an 18-page
political essay into the pocket of a West German TV reporter.
   The small protests came despite the heaviest security in Beijing
since martial law was lifted in January.
   Thousands of police and soldiers were stationed throughout the
city to discourage commemoration of the crackdown. Tiananmen Square,
the symbolic heart of Beijing, was closed to the public and
encircled by paramilitary police. Soldiers loudly practiced martial
arts next to the square.
   Last year's pro-democracy movement began in April with marches by
Beijing students and grew into a nationwide movement involving
millions of workers, intellectuals and some peasants.
   Troops and tanks rolled into central Beijing on the night of June
3 and retook Tiananmen Square. The attack lasted well into June 4
and was countered by civilians throwing gasoline bombs.
   When it ended, Beijing's streets looked like a war zone, strewn
with burned tanks, army jeeps and buses. Thousands of people were
arrested nationwide in the months that followed and many remain
jailed without charge.
   Since then, only a few isolated protests have been attempted,
although anger over the army attack remains widespread.
   Chinese officials gathered Sunday in the Great Hall of the People
adjoining Tiananmen Square to commemorate another anniversary _ 150
years since the 1840 Opium War with Britain. The Communist Party
regards the war as the start of foreign imperialist aggression
against China.
   In a park in western Beijing, police broke up a crowd of about 40
Chinese at the English Corner, where people studying English gather
each Sunday morning to practice. The police took five people away
for questioning.

   Leaders of the centrist Social Democratic Party
voted to disband Sunday because of waning electoral fortunes, only
nine years after it was founded in a dramatic challenge to Britain's
established political order.
   ``If we did nothing else, we showed the importance of standing by
your principles and policies which you think are in the best
interest of the country,'' said leader David Owen after the national
committee reached its decision.
   Owen helped form the party in 1981 to offer voters a centrist
alternative to the Conservative Party and then-increasingly leftist
Labor Party. But party membership had dwindled to only 6,000 members
and in a parliamentary election last month was even beaten by a
spoof party.
   Labor, led by Neil Kinnock, has abandoned its support for
unilateral nuclear disarmament, unveiled a more centrist platform
last month and recent polls show it leads Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's Conservatives.
   The Social Democratic Party's national committee voted 17-5 to
disband.
   In a statement, it said: ``This is a very sad day for us and for
many others who have campaigned for the SDP and believe in the
values of social democracy.''
   Owen and his two fellow members of Parliament, John Cartwright
and Rosie Barnes, will continue to sit in the House of Commons as
Independent Social Democrats.
   Owen and three other former Cabinet ministers broke with the
Labor Party in January 1981 and formed the Social Democratic Party
two months later. Unable to break through the Conservative-Labor
grip on power alone, the new party fought the 1983 and 1987 general
elections as the Alliance with the established centrist Liberal
Party.
   After winning only 22 of the 650 parliamentary districts in 1987,
a majority of the membership of the two parties agreed to merge as
the Social and Liberal Democrats.
   Owen and loyal supporters opposed to the merger remained Social
Democrats.
   In a special election last month to fill a vacant parliamentary
seat, the Social Democratic Party placed seventh out of eight
candidates and was beaten by the spoof Monster Raving Loony Party.
   Owen said he had no plans, ``at this stage at least'' to rejoin
the Labor Party, where he served as foreign secretary from 1977-79
and was seen as a potential prime minister.
   He said he thought the majority of the party's members would not
join another party.
   ``There is a big unfinished agenda,'' he said. ``There will be a
lot of people who will feel there is nobody they can vote for with
full-hearted conviction now.''
   Owen's principal critic within the party, John Martin, said,
``The party had become a burden to Dr. Owen. He is pleased not to
have it.''
   Martin said he would want to call the party activists together to
see what they would want to do, but he could not say how they would
react.
   Owen said the party was not short of money ``but we are very
short of members.''
   ``We have been pretending to do rather more than we have been
able to do,'' Mrs. Barnes said. ``We cannot pretend to be a
democratically based party with a membership now of just over
6,000.''

<HEAD>Havel Denounces Terrorism After Bomb Blast in Prague</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel called for a
tough stance against terrorists Sunday, one day after a bomb
explosion injured 19 people on a downtown square in the capital.
   ``I consider it very important to show a strong hand, to show
that freedom and democracy are not understood by us as a situation
when everybody can act as they please,'' Havel said in a national
radio interview from his country home at Lany, about 25 miles west
of Prague.
   On Saturday afternoon, a bomb in a plastic bag exploded on Old
Town Square, injuring tourists and children enjoying a concert as
well as other passers-by.
   The police say they still don't know who placed the bomb, but
political leaders and others believe the attack was meant to disrupt
Czechoslovakia's transition to democracy. General elections are set
for Friday and Saturday.
   ``The fact that it happened such a short time before the
elections is a clear indication that one of the probable culprits is
somebody from the circles of enemies of this power, and such enemies
must be clearly shown they do not stand a chance,'' Havel told the
radio without elaborating.
   Saturday's attack also drew strong condemnation from the
country's political leaders.
   ``Democracy ... cannot be stopped,'' said Jan Urban, leader of
the Civic Forum, in a statement released by the official CTK news
agency Sunday.
   ``I am convinced that on behalf of all honest Communist Party
members, I can express my jusified indignation,'' said Vasil
Mohorita, chairman of the Czechoslovak Communist Party.
   Czechoslovakia's transition to democracy had been virtually
without violence. The non-Communist government took over in December
after the country ousted its Communist leaders last year when a wave
of democratic revolutions gripped Eastern Europe.

   A bride and four of her bridesmaids, all
registered nurses, went from celebrating the wedding to tending the
wounded when a tornado smashed through town.
   The reception for newly married Stacy and Clifford White was
under way Saturday night at the Moose Lodge when ``the wind went to
whipping and rolling,'' said Wilma Tuttle, one of the 250 wedding
guests.
   ``It got where you couldn't see hardly anything at all then. It
was just real black and a lot of lightning,'' said Ms. Tuttle. ``I
was standing over there at the back door. And all of a sudden it
just sounded like like a big train roar.''
   The twisters killed eight people in Indiana _ six of them in or
near Petersburg _ and one in Illinois.
   Jim Shoultz, the bride's father, yelled a warning, and most of
the guests rushed into the basement before it hit. But after it was
over, guests went out and found an injured elderly woman in the yard
and and elderly man, his head bleeding, in a nearby home.
   Ms. White, 22, immediately began helping the two victims, her
father said. She was helped by four bridesmaids, who also were
nurses. Linen tablecloths were ripped up and used for bandages.
   ``They all worked in their wedding dresses,'' said Shoultz.
``They worked and worked on those people. Trees blocked all the
streets and the emergency medical vehicles could not get through
town.''
   The two were both alive when they finally were loaded into
ambulances, he said. The groom said the couple postponed their
honeymoon until Monday.
   Down the street, the roof was torn off the Methodist church where
the wedding ceremony was performed two hours earlier.
   ``Within six to 10 seconds, it was over,'' said caterer Jean
Sollman. ``The total parking lot was demolished. It looked like a
junkyard.''
   On Sunday, strong sunlight revealed destruction that had been
blurred by darkness, fear and confusion after the storms ripped
through the town of 3,000 Saturday night, destroying or damaging at
least 270 homes.
   ``Last night, all we could see were shadows, but we could tell
half our house was gone,'' said Laura Britton. ``Now it looks even
worse.''
   Flooding that earned the town a state emergency declaration two
weeks before now seemed trivial, she said.
   Hundreds of people wandered through town, staring at piles of
bricks and twisted metal where homes and stores had stood.
   ``Right after it happened, you couldn't see anything,'' said
Keith Burch, whose home was damaged. ``Power was out. People were
screaming. Power lines were all across the road like cobwebs.''
   Chris Anderson and about 300 other musicians were in a building
at Petersburg's Horonady Park when a twister hit. Anderson, who
plays a mandolin, was next in line to perform in the Indiana State
Picking and Fiddling Contest.
   ``Someone ran in and said, `Everyone hit the floor!''' Anderson
said. ``Then it hit. Doors blew open. Windows broke.''
   Anderson said he knew of no serious injuries at the park,
although more than 50 trees were scattered and cars were smashed.
   Trooper Vinnie Gieselman was dispatched to Petersburg to check
downed power lines during the storm. He was in his patrol car when
he saw a tornado.
   ``It was like one massive wall coming at me,'' he said. ``I
grabbed my jacket and covered my head. It was a rough ride.''
   Gieselman's crippled car, the back window shattered by a tree
limb, was towed out of Petersburg on Sunday. It passed people
picking through the debris of dozens of homes where few belongings
remained in one piece.
   Many residents sat on battered porches, unsure what to do next.
There was no electricity and most homes were without phone service
or plumbing. The Red Cross handed out food and drinking water.
   Gary Ferrier stood alone on the collapsed porch of his
122-year-old Victorian home. A fourth of his roof was gone. In his
front yard, a hand-lettered sign said ``Gone With the Wind.''
   ``We're keeping our sense of humor and looking at the bright side
of things,'' Ferrier said. ``What else can you do?''

   Tired and behind schedule, Mikhail
Gorbachev passed up a chance Sunday to drop in on a picture-perfect
farm in the American heartland. But his loss was another's gain.
   Farmers Richard and Cecilia Brand said the food they planned to
serve the the Gorbachevs would instead be donated to a homeless
shelter in St. Paul.
   ``As a farmer we've been disappointed before,'' said Brand.
``Obviously we're disappointed. But all our friends and family have
been great. It's been a lot of fun.''
   The Soviet leader had requested the 25-minute visit to a family
farm as part of his 6{-hour swing through the Twin Cities area.
   The Brands and their neighbors put in a lot of work for the brief
stop-by at the property 45 minutes south of Minneapolis. They
spruced up the farmhouse and barnyard, and workers using a grader
smoothed 3{ miles of road leading to the Brand farm from the nearest
tarred road.
   But after Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, landed in Minneapolis in
the early afternoon, running almost a half-hour late, the Soviet
president scratched the farm visit from their itinerary, according
to Anne Edwards, a spokeswoman for the planners of the Minneapolis
visit.
   ``He's just tired,'' U.S. Sen. Rudy Boschwitz said in a
television interview. ``I think he won't get to San Francisco until
after midnight.''
   Instead of the cozy gathering around a picnic table that had been
proposed, the Brands and their family were invited to meet the
Gorbachevs on the airport tarmac just before their departure.
   ``We're going to make it a very special occasion,'' said Paul
Ridgeway, lead U.S. advance coordinator for the Minnesota visit.
``President and Mrs. Gorbachev plan to spend time on the tarmac
visiting with them. They're very sorry about this.''
   Neighbor Dick Nielsen's property on Sunday morning played host to
trailers that carried sheriff's patrol horses, and news
photographers worked from a temporary darkroom in his family's
garage. Other neighbors let officials park cars in their driveways.
   The agriculture economy has rebounded in much of the Midwest
following several disastrous years in the early to mid-1980s that
forced thousands of farmers off their land. In the past few years,
farm land values have increased and debt has decreased.
   The Brands had said they wanted to show Gorbachev a ``typical
American farm,'' although what's typical isn't clear in these days
of large-scale corporate farm operations.
   The Brands, who run their 240-acre farm with their two sons, milk
75 cows and raise alfalfa, corn and soybeans. In all they have 250
cows.
   The couple previously has been host to foreign visitors, which
they believe is due in part to their proximity to the Twin Cities
and easy access to the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
State Agriculture Department officials suggested the couple for the
Gorbachev trip.

   For the second time in six months, city
residents voted for a mayor Sunday, but the opposition claimed the
balloting had been rigged, as was an earlier, annulled tally.
   Opposition leaders said the governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party was driving voters to the polls with fake documents and had
taken thousands of opposition supporters off voter registration
lists.
   Allegations of electoral fraud have frequently been made against
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has controlled the
government since the party's formation in 1929. Party leaders have
pledged to end fraud and corruption within the party.
   The special election in Uruapan, a city of 450,000 that is the
second largest in the western state of Michoacan, was being held
because the results of the Dec. 3 vote were annulled because of
charges of fraud.
   Rep. Jose Gonzalez Morfin of the conservative National Action
Party said Sunday that his party's supporters had seen a pickup
truck without license plates and government trucks carrying people
with fake documents to vote. Reporters observed at least one such
truck that appeared to be carrying on such an operation at one
precinct.
   At the same time, people carrying voting credentials at the same
precinct were turned away when electoral officials said their names
did not appear on the voting list.
   No electoral officials were immediately available to comment on
the charges of fraud.
   Members of the center-left Democratic Revolutionary Party and
National Action Party had said before the voting that many of their
supporters had been eliminated from the rolls.
   Uruapan has been governed by a provisional administration since
the state legislature canceled December's vote count.
   Juan Antonio Chavez Mendoza, a Democratic Revolutionary member,
said Saturday the governing party distributed 5,000 voting
credentials to its own members rather than the rightful owners.
   He said some were given to people from other parts of the state
who would be brought in to vote.
   The governing party has denied the allegations.
   Jose Rosario Torres Ramos, the local Democratic Revolutionary
chairman, said the contest is so close that a few hundred votes
could make a difference in the outcome.
   Uruapan, 200 miles west of Mexico City, is one of more than 20
cities where the Democratic Revolutionary Party challenged victories
claimed by the governing party in December. The party's activists
seized city halls in 21 communities around the state after those
elections.
   Army troops ousted the protesters with tear gas and fire hoses
four months later. No injuries were reported.
   Michoacan is the birthplace of former presidential candidate
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who forged the Democratic Revolutionary Party
from an alliance of opposition parties. Cardenas claims that fraud
caused his defeat by Carlos Salinas de Gortari in the 1988
presidential race.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ended
summit talks on Sunday promising to work with President Bush toward
a solution to Germany's military future but sternly warning Israel
and independence-minded Lithuanians on other issues.
   Gorbachev said he had surveyed with Bush ``new possible
perspectives'' on Germany. One of them, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III said, might be a ``political agreement'' between the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.
   ``I cannot say that we have reached agreement, but that does not
mean that our efforts were futile,'' Gorbachev said of his dogged _
and unsuccessful _ campaign to persuade Bush that a unified Germany
should not be aligned against the Soviet Union.
   Bush, at their joint news conference, insisted that a united
Germany in NATO ``would be stabilizing'' and said he did not think
his differences with Gorbachev on the issue had been narrowed during
their four days of talks.
   But the two leaders parted amicably. ``The atmosphere and the
results of this meeting make it possible for us to speak really of a
new phase of cooperation,'' Gorbachev said.
   Baker will pursue the German question with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze while they attend a European
security conference on human rights this week in Copenhagen,
Denmark, and again, in Berlin, later in the month.
   ``Conceivably there could be some sort of a political agreement
of some sort'' to help the East and Central Europeans accept German
membership in NATO, Baker said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.''
   ``There are some ideas'' for resolving the German question, Baker
said. He said those ideas came from the United States, the Soviet
Union and the NATO allies. Among those were many that have been
previously mentioned: a more political role for NATO and the plan,
forwarded by West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, to
keep NATO troops out of territory now part of East Germany.
   ``We'll keep wrestling with it,'' he said.
   Other U.S. officials said last week that Gorbachev had proposed
creation of a new all-European council to consider military
questions arising from the impending merger of East Germany and West
Germany. Among them would be the size of the German army.
   On two other summit issues _ Jewish emigration from the Soviet
Union and the drive for independence in Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia _ Gorbachev took a tough stand in reply to reporters'
questions.
   Having permitted Jewish emigration to soar to an all-time high _
some 20,000 exit permits were issued in May _ Gorbachev aligned
himself with Arab leaders who, he said, had protested in ``acute
terms'' the continuing settlement of Jews by Israel on the West Bank
and in Gaza.
   If ``certain conclusions'' are not reached in Jerusalem, the
Soviet leader said, ``we must give further thought to it in terms of
what we can do with issuing permits for exit.''
   Bush, meanwhile, reiterated U.S. opposition to further
settlements on the lands surrendered by Jordan and Egypt in their
1967 war with Israel. ``I will try to persuade the government of
Israel that it is counterproductive,'' he said.
   Baker said the Soviets had told him last month in Moscow and on
other occasions that they might suspend Jewish emigration if
refugees are permitted to live on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   ``They have a great deal more trouble with that than we do,''
Baker said. While the Bush administration is opposed to the
settlements it firmly supports Jewish emigration, he said.
   Bush said he would not consider lowering U.S. tariffs on Soviet
imports until the Soviet parliament enacts a new law establishing
emigration as a right.
   On the Baltics, an area of sharp disagreement although Bush
declined to let it stand in the way of a new trade pact with Moscow,
the Soviet leader insisted that the drive for independence be
channeled through constitutional means.
   Any other approach, Gorbachev said, ``leads only to an impasse.''
   ``Our Constitution has recorded the right for each people to make
a choice for self-determination up to and including secession,'' he
said. And, he added, the sovereign rights of the Soviet republics
were being expanded.
   Lithuanians and other people ``trying to resolve the problem by
different methods, without due regard for the Constitution, leads to
exacerbation, aggravation and confrontation,'' Gorbachev said.
``This is not beneficial either for people, for their families, or
for the economy, or for the overall atmosphere in our country.''
   Bush, in turn, called U.S.-Soviet differences over Lithuania
``one of the thorns in the side of an overall relationship.''
   After Gorbachev left, a senior U.S. official said the Soviet
leader was ``in full accord'' with Bush that Germans had the right
to make a decision about NATO membership by virtue of the 1975
Helsinki agreement signed by 35 nations.
   ``It's the first time he has done that with the president,'' said
the official, who sought out reporters while insisting he not be
quoted by name or be otherwise identified.
   ``He said that he agreed that this was up to the German people to
decide,'' the official said. ``We'll have to see what that means,''
   Gorbachev, speaking at the news conference on what he called
``external aspects'' of German unification _ meaning how the new
country would relate to other European nations _ said the two sides
had clarified their positions and ``we will continue our discussion
in order to find a mutually acceptable solution.''

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who has in
the past called for quicker economic reform, said Sunday he
nevertheless backs the government's drive to introduce free markets.
   He tempered his support, however, by saying he reserves the right
to offer constructive criticism.
   His remarks came as a rival but less powerful union renewed its
attacks on the government's program to dismantle the centrally
planned economy.
   Delegates at the rival OPZZ union's congress put the blame for
the country's problems on the reform plan.
   OPZZ was the Communist government's sanctioned union before
Solidarity was legalized last year and a Solidarity-led
administration took power.
   Walesa, addressing supporters Sunday after Mass in the Baltic
port of Gdansk, declared, ``Solidarity firmly supports the reform
activities of the government. It will support them _ but not
uncritically.''
   Walesa was speaking to a crowd of about 1,500 people in the
courtyard of St. Brygida's Roman Catholic church.
   The government's radical economic reform plan has achieved its
first major objective of ending three-digit inflation since the
program took effect Jan. 1.
   The plan slashed subsidies to state-run enterprises, eliminated
most price controls and introduced a tight wage policy. More than
400,000 people have registered for umemployment benefits.
   The government has sought assistance from the West to help make
the complex transition, but the amount offered so far has not met
expectations.
   ``Let us remember that we can count only on ourselves. Nothing
has come out of our alliances with the West, like with our
friendship with the East,'' Walesa said Sunday.
   At the final day of the OPZZ congress in Warsaw on Sunday, miner
Rajmund Moric declared that ``if the government's position does not
change by midyear, a protest action will be needed nationwide.''
   The union says the government's program is causing too much
unemployment and making living standards decline. It also objects to
plans to privatize the state enterprises, where many of its members
work.

   President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev proclaimed ``an atmosphere of growing trust'' Sunday at
the close of their four-day summit. They left unsolved nagging
differences on German unity and independence for Lithuania.
   The leaders parted with smiles and warm handshakes and a decision
to meet on a regular basis _ perhaps annually. The Soviet president
invited Bush to Moscow, a state visit that may take place before
year's end.
   The Soviet president and his wife jetted off to meet with
business and farm leaders in Minneapolis and an overnight stop in
San Francisco.
   ``I personally believe that this summit will go down in history
as a summit of hope and optimism,'' Gorbachev said at the beginning
of his meeting in Minneapolis. ``I think that two or three days
later or two or three weeks later, we will really begin to
understand what this meeting has produced.''
   On Monday, Gorbachev has a reunion with Ronald Reagan, and holds
a first-ever meeting with the president of South Korea.
   ``We've moved a long, long way from the depths of the Cold War,''
Bush said at a wrapup news conference, sitting alongside Gorbachev
at the same mahogany table where they sealed agreements Friday to
slash long-range nuclear weapons, halt production of chemical
weapons, and lift trade barriers against Moscow.
   The news conference was broadcast live in America and across the
Soviet Union, where mounting political and economic problems await
Gorbachev on his return.
   Gorbachev said the two leaders compared differences in ``an
atmosphere of frankness, a constructive atmosphere, an atmosphere of
growing trust.''
   Barbara Bush and Raisa Gorbachev, who cemented a warm
relationship over the four days, sat beside each other at the news
conference, listening with earphones to the translations of their
husband's comments.
   Despite the rosy assessments, stubborn problems persisted.
   Bush said Gorbachev offered no assurances that he would ease his
economic stranglehold on Lithuania, the Baltic republic struggling
for freedom. The U.S. leader said the question of Baltic
independence was ``one of the thorns in the side of an overall
relationship.''
   As for Gorbachev's objections to a united Germany belonging to
NATO, Bush said, ``I'm not sure we narrowed them.'' Gorbachev said
the European questions were matters of ``the highest level of
strategy.'' He said of Germany, without elaboration, ``We're not
going to put spokes in the wheel.''
   Separately, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said he will
explore a ``political agreement'' between NATO and the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact to bridge the differences over a unified Germany. He was
skeptical of an idea from a Gorbachev adviser that the Soviet Union
become a member of NATO, the 16-nation Western alliance.
   Overseas, leaders of the two Germanys said the summit improved
prospects for unifying their countries and boosted chances for
disarmament.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher pronounced
the meeting ``a great success.'' East German Prime Minister Lothar
de Maiziere hailed ``new and very different ideas'' about
stabilizing European security.
   Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze will take
up the German question on Tuesday at a Copenhagen human rights
meeting and then again later in the month at the so-called
two-plus-four unification talks. These talks involve the two
Germanys and the four victors of World War II _ the United States,
Soviet Union, France and Britain.
   With impassioned words, Gorbachev said he was obliged to speak
for the 27 million Soviets killed in German-provoked World War II.
``It's not a matter of pride but of justice _ supreme justice. ...
We have a moral right.''
   The news conference was sprinkled with moments of humor. When a
Soviet journalist asked Gorbachev about his problems with political
nemesis Boris Yeltsin, he replied, ``I don't think you have chosen
the best place for clarifying our internal problems. But c'est la
vie, as they say.''
   On the contentious issue of Lithuania, Bush said he did not link
trade benefits for Moscow with a relaxation of pressure on the
Baltic republic. The only price, he said, was passage of a Soviet
law protecting Jewish emigration. ``That's it,'' he said.
   Yet, Baker acknowledged it would be ``very difficult'' to win
congressional approval of a trade treaty as long as the Soviets
crack down on Lithuania. And White House chief of staff John Sununu
said, ``There is going to be linkage with a whole host of issues.''
   Gorbachev demanded that Lithuania follow a constitutionally
prescribed route toward freedom, including a referendum. After that,
he said, it would take ``no fewer than five or seven years'' to sort
things out in what he called ``this divorce proceeding.''
   On Germany, Bush said he and Gorbachev agreed it was up to the
Germans to decide which military alliance they join after
unification, in accordance with a 35-nation agreement known as the
Helsinki Final Act.
   A senior administration official said the U.S. side attached
significance to Gorbachev's agreement on that point, the first time
the Soviet leader had done so. Nevertheless, the official said, ``I
didn't say they're buying our side. We're hopeful this reflects some
movement.''
   Gorbachev said he had offered many options on the question of
Germany. ``It seems to me there are some points the American side
has noticed,'' he said.
   Soviet spokesman Gennadi Gerasimov ridiculed NATO, saying that it
must be changed. ``These letters may stand for `navies, aircraft,
tanks _ obsolete.''
   Gorbachev used the news conference with Bush to warn Israel that
he would ``give thought'' to suspending the issuance of exit permits
for Soviet Jews if they continue to be settled on the disputed West
Bank or in Gaza.
   Although Bush is pressing Moscow for free emigration rights, he
noted that the United States opposes new settlements.
   The summit ended on a friendly note.
   In a prepared statement opening the news conference, Bush said
they had talked with ``candor and openness.'' Gorbachev responded
with a paean to Bush's statesmanship. ``This is the kind of person
to do business with,'' Gorbachev said.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the two leaders
were alike in some ways. ``When they debate across a table, they see
a mirror image. They even have a similar sense of humor. They make
fun of things, they tease each other,'' he said.

   President Bush told Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher on Sunday night that his four-day summit with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev had gone well and they had a good rapport, the prime
minister's office said.
   In a 20-minute telephone conversation, Bush gave Mrs. Thatcher an
account of his discussions with the Soviet president, and the two
discussed the implications for Mrs. Thatcher's trip to the Soviet
Union at the end of the week, a spokesman for her 10 Downing St.
office said.
   Mrs. Thatcher departs Thursday for Moscow on a four-day visit,
during which she will meet with Gorbachev for the fifth time in six
years.
   Mrs. Thatcher, after her first meeting with the Soviet leader in
London in 1984, described him as a man she could do business with.
   Bush and Gorbachev concluded their talks in Washington on Sunday,
and at a news conference the Soviet leader said the two men had
compared differences in ``an atmosphere of frankness, a constructive
atmosphere, an atmosphere of growing trust.''
   During an international radio phone-in on the BBC World Service
earlier in the day, Mrs. Thatcher expressed her admiration for
Gorbachev.
   ``I think President Gorbachev is a quite remarkable president and
a remarkable person. I am a great fan,'' she said.
   ``When you think that for the greater part of this century the
old type of Communism has held sway. .... He had the courage and
vision to say `It is not working'.''
   Mrs. Thatcher also said she was impressed that, unlike other
Soviet leaders, Gorbachev was willing to talk freely about a whole
range of issues.

<HEAD>Storm Front Brings Severe Weather to Northeast after Spawning
Tornadoes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful storm system crossing the Midwest spawned more than
100 tornadoes before bringing some severe weather to the Northeast
Sunday.
   Across Indiana, officials reported eight dead and at least 150
people injured Saturday night in the state's worst tornado outbreak
since 1974. The storms left 24 cities in 15 counties with
significant damage. Officials tracked about 50 tornado touchdowns
during a four-hour period.
   In Illinois a tornado destroyed or damaged scores of houses and
killed one woman, and a 10-year-old boy drowned in a storm-swollen
river in Milwaukee.
   A cold front racing across the lower Great Lakes region and the
upper Ohio Valley brought thunderstorms to northern Vermont and
upstate New York, while showers and thunderstorms ahead of the front
extended from northeastern Texa through central Mississippi and
northern Georgia into southern West Virginia.
   The thunderstorms produced locally heavy rains from southern
Arkansas through northern Alabama to eastern Kentucky.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included nearly four inches at El Dorado, Ark., and three inches at
Texarkana Ark.
   Showers and thunderstorms fell on much of Florida.
   Drizzle and scattered showers stretched across Iowa, Minnesota,
Wisconsin and Upper Michigan, and showers associated with a cold
front crossing the Pacific Northwest were scattered across
Washington state, northern Idaho and western Oregon.
   Strong, gusty winds were circulating about the deep low pressure
system centered over Upper Michigan. On Sunday morning, wind gusts
reached to 52 mph at Chicago, and to 56 at Milwaukee.
   Strong, southerly winds ahead of an advancing cold front
prevailed across the East and temperatures rose to the 70s and 80s
as far north as New England, despite mostly cloudy skies.
   Clouds and light rain in the north-central United States were
keeping afternoon temperatures in the 40s and upper 30s across the
upper Mississippi Valley and much of the northern Plains.
   Sunny skies prevailed Sunday afternoon from California to the
Plains, and much of the Ohio Valley and mid-Mississippi Valley in
the wake of the severe weather outbreak on Saturday.
   Temperatures rose into the 80s and 90s across the south-central
United States, with readings soaring to nearly 100 degrees in the
desert Southwest.
   The nation's temperatures at 2 p.m. EDT ranged from 37 degrees at
Houghton and Marquette, Mich., to 107 at Palm Springs, Calif.
   The low Sunday morning was 28 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.

   President Bush relaxed after four days
of meetings with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev by having
Sunday dinner with family members at Bush's favorite Chinese
restaurant.
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, drove in a rainstorm to this Virginia
suburb of Washington for dinner at the Peking Gourmet Inn. The
president and Mrs. Bush shared a table with son Marvin,
daughter-in-law Margaret and grandchildren Marshall, 4, and Walker,
an infant.
   The family ate in privacy behind a partition. But at one point
Mrs. Bush emerged to get Ranger, a puppy, out of the presidential
limousine.
   ``We're trying to get Ranger home,'' Bush later explained as he
came out of the restaurant. The dog had spent the weekend at the
White House with its mother, Millie. It belongs to Marvin Bush and
his family, who live in Alexandria, Va.

   Recent murders of American soldiers by
Communist rebels and new threats have prompted the U.S. Air Force to
scale back a training exercise to keep all personnel on base, U.S.
sources said Sunday.
   The latest killing of a U.S. serviceman came Saturday night near
Subic Naval Base, but American officials said theft _ not politics _
was the motive.
   About 1,000 troops had been expected to take part in the two-week
military exercise, which was to begin Monday at Clark Air Base, Air
Force officials said.
   But the number was reduced to about 850 so that all personnel
could be housed on the base, 50 miles north of Manila.
   In Honolulu, Air Force spokesman Maj. James Pasierb said the
reduction would not affect the scope of the operation, the final
phase of this year's Cope Thunder series of exercises.
   He claimed the reductions were not prompted by Communist threats.
   ``I want to make it clear that we are not scaling back on the
exercise because of any terroristic activity,'' he said.
   But sources at Clark, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
security was the primary consideration. Last month, Communist rebels
killed two American airmen near Clark and vowed more attacks until
all U.S. troops leave the Philippines.
   A U.S. Navy lieutenant was fatally stabbed Saturday near Subic,
but officials said the motive was robbery and not politically
related. The Navy identified the victim as Richard E. Brown, 33, of
Spring Valley, N.Y.
   On Friday, U.S. officials imposed new travel restrictions on the
20,300 troops, Defense Department civilians and military dependents
stationed at Clark, citing the ``current threat conditions.''
   Clark Air Base is in an area of central Luzon island, a
stronghold of the New People's Army, which has been waging a 21-year
insurgency to establish a Marxist state.
   During the six previous Cope Thunder exercises this year,
hundreds of airmen on temporary duty were housed in civilian hotels
near the base because of a shortage of room on the base.
   The policy was changed, however, after the rebels killed airmen
John Raven and James Green in front of their hotel on May 13, the
day before U.S. and Philippine negotiators opened talks on the
future of the bases.
   Raven and Green were on temporary duty from Kunsan Air Base in
South Korea because their unit was taking part in Cope Thunder
training. After the killings, hundreds of airmen were moved back
onto the base and some were housed in the gym because of the housing
shortage.
   This week's exercises also will include U.S. units from Japan and
South Korea.
   U.S. officials say training facilities in the Clark area,
including the nearby Crowe Valley firing range, are far superior to
those available in Japan and South Korea.

   British Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd urged Israel on Sunday to agree to direct peace negotiations
with the Palestinians, and he warned of large-scale violence without
a Middle East settlement.
   Speaking at the end of a two-day visit to Saudi Arabia, Hurd
called on Washington to maintain its ``constructive engagement'' as
part of a four-point plan to reactivate the stalled Middle East
peace process.
   ``A tremor of danger may shake the region and if things drift
further, we risk a damaging escalation of violence,'' he said at a
news conference.
   Hurd suggested that a U.N. representative make a fact-finding
visit to the Israeli-occupied territories and report back to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   ``The security of Israel cannot be ensured by ignoring the
existence of those whose territories her forces now occupy,'' he
said.
   Hurd's suggestion points to a less binding alternative to a
three-member investigative team considered by the U.N. Security
Council last week. Britain and the other members of the Security
Council backed the resolution, but the United States used its veto
power to block it.
   Hurd's plan to reactivate the peace process proposed:
   ``First, the United States needs to maintain its constructive
engagement in the search for peace.
   ``Second, there is room for a greater degree of international
involvement to which the European Community has consistently given
its support. Some progress could be made by a representative of the
U.N. Secretary General visiting the occupied territories and
reporting on the situation there.
   ``Third, the PLO should not only reaffirm its denunciation of
terrorism but respect it strictly in practice.
   ``Fourth, an Israeli government needs to carry forward the peace
process by entering into dialogue with representative Palestinians.''
   Hurd welcomed the Soviet Union's more liberal emigration policy,
but termed the settlement of Soviet Jews in Israel's occupied
territories as ``unjust'' and ``illegal.''
   ``The Arab world is deeply worried by the prospect of Soviet Jews
settling in occupied territories. It is not right to correct one
injustice and impose another,'' Hurd said.
   In another development Sunday, a U.N. delegation seeking a
nuclear-free zone in the Middle East began a two-day visit to
Israel, which is reportedly the only country in the region with
atomic weapons.
   The three-man delegation was named in 1988 to prepare a report
for the U.N. secretary-general on ways to advance nuclear
disarmament in the Middle East. The team has already visited Egypt,
Jordan, Syria, Iran and Iraq.

   A government minister on Sunday asked Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to visit the occupied territories to see himself that
Israel has no policy of settling Jewish immigrants there, but the
Soviet president said the time was not right.
   The invitation was extended by Absorption Minister Yitzhak Peretz
after Gorbachev warned Israel he would consider suspending exit
permits for Soviet Jews if they continue to be settled in the
territories.
   Gorbachev, in Minneapolis after wrapping up his four-day summit
meeting with President Bush in Washington earlier in the day, was
asked if he would be interested in traveling to Israel.
   ``I will be frank, the time has not yet come to go there,'' he
said in Russian. ``Let the leaders of Israel think about what has
been said today in Washington so they don't turn out to be the only
people in the world who don't understand.''
   President Bush, who joined Gorbachev at a concluding news
conference in Washington, repeated that the United States is opposed
to further settlements in the lands captured by Israel from the
Arabs in the 1967 Middle East War.
   ``I will try to persuade the government of Israel that it is
counterproductive,'' Bush said.
   Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said
Israel was not directing Soviet immigrants to the Gaza Strip and
West Bank.
   ``It is well known that Israel does not have a policy of
directing the new immigrants from the Soviet Union or elsewhere to
the territories,'' Pazner said. ``The new immigrants ... have the
freedom to choose where they want to live.''
   Pazner said only a ``few hundred people'' had chosen to live in
the occupied lands. He said the Arab states were using them to mount
an offensive against Jewish immigration from the Soviet Union to
Israel.
   In Washington, Gorbachev had said the Soviet Union ``is being
bombarded by a lot of criticism'' from Arab countries regarding
Israel's immigration policies.
   Presidents Hafez Assad of Syria and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt raised
their objections ``in acute terms,'' he said.
   Gorbachev said that if Israel does not heed appeals to keep
Jewish immigrants from settling in the occupied lands, ``we must
give further thought to it, in terms with what we can do with
issuing permits for exit.''
   Some in the Soviet Union, he said, have suggested that the
government ``postpone issuing permits for exit, to put it off''
until Israel provides the necessary assurances.
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union is at an all-time high.
About 35,000 Soviet Jews arrived in Israel this year, and the figure
is expected to reach as high as 150,000. About 1 million Soviets are
seeking permission to emigrate.
   Israeli officials say only 200 Soviet Jews have settled in the
occupied areas, joining 70,000 Jewish settlers who live there amid
1.7 million Palestinians.
   Peretz, who said he was authorized by the government to extend
the invitation to Gorbachev, asserted that Soviet Jews who settled
in the occupied lands this year and last ``did so on the basis of
family reunification.''
   Deputy Prime Minister David Levy said Gorbachev's warning
violated his own policy of extending greater freedom to Soviet
citizens.
   ``The Soviet Union is changing direction and it cannot be that
only regarding Jews it would take a step that leads it backward and
not forward, to progress and freedom,'' he said.
   The Soviet leader's remarks also were sharply criticized by U.S.
Jewish leaders.
   Malcolm Hoenlein, executive director of the Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, said the comments
were doubtlessly ``a response to the unrelenting Arab campaign to
halt Jewish emigration.''
   ``But even to suggest a restriction of Jewish emigration to
Israel is unacceptable.''

   Mikhail Gorbachev threw police for a loop
and onlookers into a frenzy Sunday by repeatedly making unscripted
plunges into crowds to shake hands and chat.
   The Soviet president left his limousine to greet crowds before a
luncheon at the governor's mansion, crossed the street after lunch
to the delight of another group and walked the street a third time
near the St. Paul Cathedral.
   One stop he didn't make disappointed both admirers and
protesters: His motorcade didn't even slow down during its 45-second
trip around the state Capitol, where an estimated 6,000 people had
waited seven hours in damp and chilly weather.
   Earlier, through an interpreter at one of his impromptu stops,
Gorbachev told the crowd: ``Thank you all for your feelings. The
Soviet people have just as much respect for American citizens as you
do. I wish happiness and well-being to the people of Minnesota and
this state.''
   Gorbachev smiled broadly and nodded to the crowds, occasionally
saying a few words. Supporters' shouts of ``Gorby! Gorby!'' mixed
with jeers from protesters.
   Crowds held signs reading ``We love Mikhail, Raisa,'' ``Mr.
Gorbachev is a Cool Dude'' and ``Give Gorbachev the Nobel Peace
Prize.''
   After lunch at the governor's mansion, Gorbachev waded into the
throngs outside and walked more than a block. He talked for about
two minutes with 11-year-old Brandon Peterson, but it was not
immediately known what the two said.
   Gorbachev got back into his car, but had the motorcade stop
again. Security ropes were either down or nonexistent, and police
used loudspeakers to tell the crowd to back off the street.
   Gorbachev stuck his hand out his car window and waved at the
throng outside the Capitol, but his face was only barely visible.
   Many people ran the length of the Capitol lawn, leaping hedges
and jumping curbs, hoping for a better look.
   ``I was a little disappointed because he is one of the most
important people that ever lived,'' said Helene Turnbull of
Minneapolis. ``But it was worth the wait seeing all the excitement.''
   ``It did go pretty fast,'' said Shelly Hanson, who, along with
her husband, son, daughter and nephew, made a 2{-hour trip from
Alexandria and then waited two hours for the motorcade to arrive.
   ``I think his actions proved he doesn't care about real people,
that he only wants to meet business people,'' said Vivita
Rozenbergs, a Minneapolis resident of Baltic ancestry. ``His actions
speak louder than his words.''

   Novelist Salman Rushdie on Sunday praised a Chinese
student's account of the Tiananmen Square repression as an important
testament to ``beautiful and terrible'' events.
   Rushdie, who has been in hiding since Iranian religious leaders
called for his death last year for alleged blasphemy of Islam in his
novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' reviewed the book ``Moving the
Mountain'' by Li Lu in the weekly Independent on Sunday.
   Li escaped from China one month after the army crackdown against
pro-democracy students on June 3-4 last year in Beijing and is now
studying in the United States. In London on Sunday he told an
anniversary rally that the movement will rise again.
   In his review, Rushdie recalled the collapse of communist rule in
Eastern Europe last year and said this weekend's anniversary of the
crackdown on the pro-democracy students in Beijing was a ``time to
remember that 1989 was a year not only of miracles but of horrors as
well.''
   Li's book, published in London by Macmillan, tells of his boyhood
during China's Cultural Revolution. He was handed over to a coal
miner's family to be brought up because his parents had been
denounced as intellectuals.
   Li was a student at Nanjing University when he joined the
students in Tiananmen Square. He became one of the leaders and just
before the repression, married his girlfriend in the square. He left
China but gives no details nor say if his bride went with him.
   Rushdie said in his review: ``No doubt, in time, there will be
calmer, less hurried responses to the appalling events of last year
in Beijing. No doubt other surviviors will emerge to tell us their
stories.
   ``But Li Lu's book, rough and ready as it is, is an important
one. He is the first witness to speak, and what he witnessed was
beautiful and terrible, almost _ but not quite _ beyond words.''
   Rushdie has remained in hiding since Iranian officials pronounced
the death sentence Feb. 14, 1989.

   Authorities on Sunday seized a light
airplane loaded with cocaine and arrested its pilot, who identified
himself as a Colombian air force captain, police said.
   Police almost captured the plane at a refueling stop earlier in
the day but were rebuffed by machete- and club-wielding residents
after the pilot told them he was bringing in a shipment of cheese,
police Capt. Carlos Munoz said.
   Police later captured pilot Leonardo Aragon Flores, the plane and
more than 440 pounds of cocaine in the community of Aposentillo on
the Nicaraguan side of the border with Honduras, Munoz said in an
interview.
   He said Aragon identified himself as a Colombian air force
captain and showed documents identifying him as such.
   The plane landed near Managua to refuel earlier in the day, where
the residents had fought with police, Munoz said.
   Munoz said Aragon had told residents of the San Rafael del Sur
community, 30 miles from Managua, that the plane contained a
shipment of cheese.
   He said Aragon managed to fly the plane away, but police and
soldiers arrested a crew member, 30-year-old Oscar Cardenas, who had
left the plane to get gas. Munoz said Cardenas is a Colombian
civilian.
   Aragon had apparently flown the Colombian-registered plane from
Colombia and was on his way to Guatemala with the cocaine, which was
contained in 16 bags, Munoz said. It landed in Aposentillo.
   Munoz said Aragon was carrying a revolver.
   Aragon was jailed in the western city of Leon, about 50 miles
from Managua, Munoz said.

   Chunks of concrete plummetted from a bridge
onto an interstate highway 75 feet below Sunday, damaging at least
20 vehicles and injuring three motorists.
   ``A rock came out of the sky, bounced off our hood and smashed
the windshield,'' said motorist Laura Nizankiewicz. ``There was
glass all over the car. My sister got a piece in her eye, and our
arms were covered with little slivers.''
   State Trooper W. Hughes said 20 vehicles received damage to
hoods, roofs, windshields and bumpers as they passed on Interstate
376 under the city-owned bridge around 3:30 p.m.
   At least three people were injured, Hughes said. Two people were
treated at the scene, and one woman was in stable condition at
Presbyterian-University Hospital in Pittsburgh, he said.
   Al Neri, a spokesman for Mayor Sophie Masloff, said late Sunday
city engineers weren't sure if the debris fell from the bridge or
from collection nets placed under the span during the weekend.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev got a first-hand
look Sunday at $32 million worth of computers his country hopes will
improve the safety of nuclear power plants.
   In remarks to a few hundred people at the headquarters of Control
Data Corp., the Soviet president said he hopes the six Control Data
computers the Soviets have agreed to buy will prevent another
disaster like Chernobyl.
   ``We cannot really do without nuclear energy today,'' he said.
``This particular type of energy has a lot of advantages but it also
has risks.
   ``What can we do to make it as safe as possible? This is
something we must pursue, especially in the civilian sector. We do
welcome and applaud this new step in our economic cooperation.''
   Control Data was the final stop on the seven-hour visit to
Minnesota by Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa. But Mrs. Gorbachev
didn't accompany her husband as scheduled, instead extending her
visit to a Minneapolis family.
   ``I was told your state is a closed state,'' Gorbachev said.
``Right now it is beginning to open toward the Soviet Union. See how
fast things are changing?''
   The six mainframe computers to be exported to the Soviet Union
will be used as information banks to make decisions on handling
accidents, performing maintenance, building new plants and
decommissioning old ones, said Control Data executive Scott Harris.
   The Chernobyl accident in 1986 occurred while Soviet scientists
were running a physical test on the plant, and it ``may have been
possible to run that test as a mathematical model on a computer,''
Harris said.
   Earlier, Gerald R. Giombetti, vice president of international
trade for Control Data, said the U.S. government has indicated it
soon will approve export of the computers.
   The United States requires safeguards to ensure that the
computers will be used strictly for their intended purpose, he said.
The biggest concerns were raised by the Pentagon, Giombetti said.
   ``It's the fear of a dual use,'' he said. ``Even though it is a
civilian application, the big concern is that this is at a nuclear
site.''
   Control Data has been doing business in the Soviet Union for more
than 20 years. The first American-built mainframe in the USSR was a
Cyber 1604, installed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at
Dubna in 1968. The deal was made during the thaw in U.S.-Soviet
relations known as ``Ostpolitik.''
   The pending sale of nuclear safety computers would be Control
Data's first deal with the Soviet Union since 1979, when trade was
restricted by President Carter after the Soviets invaded
Afghanistan, Giombetti said.

   One purpose of Mikhail Gorbachev's
visit to Minnesota was to inspect some merchandise _ $32 million in
Control Data Corp. computers, to be used to improve the safety of
Soviet nuclear power plants.
   The Soviet President and his wife, Raisa, hoped to make a brief
swing through Control Data's headquarters as part of their 6{-hour
visit to the Twin Cities.
   Although the company has slipped from the top ranks of the
nation's computer makers in recent years, its more than 20-year
history of commercial ties with the Soviets was believed to be a
factor in the visit.
   The six mainframe computers are to be delivered to plant and
research sites in four Soviet cities, said Gerald R. Giombetti, vice
president of international trade for Control Data. They would be the
most powerful computers ever exported to the Soviet Union.
   Giombetti said the U.S. government has indicated it will approve
export of the computers soon. The United States requires safeguards
to ensure the computers will be used for their intended purpose and
not for military purposes, he said.
   ``We've had a lot of dialogue with the U.S. government at very
high levels,'' said Giombetti, who noted the biggest concerns were
voiced by the Defense Department. ``It's the fear of a dual use.
Even though it is a civilian application, the big concern is that
this is at a nuclear site.''
   Control Data executives Scott Harris and Bill Selden said the
machines wouldn't be used to run nuclear plants. Instead, they are
to be used as easy-access information banks to make decisions on
handling accidents, performing maintenance, building new plants and
decommissioning old ones.
   Harris and Selden said the purchase was driven partly by the
Chernobyl nuclear accident, which occurred while Soviet scientists
were running a test on the plant.
   ``It may have been possible to run that test as a mathematical
model on a computer,'' Harris said.
   Control Data has been doing business in the Soviet Union for more
than 20 years. The first American-built mainframe in the U.S.S.R.
was a Cyber 1604, installed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear
Research at Dubna in 1968 during a thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations.
   The pending sale of nuclear safety computers would be Control
Data's first deal with the Soviet Union since 1979, when President
Carter imposed trade restrictions after the Soviets invaded
Afghanistan, Giombetti said.
   Control Data also has agreed to sell the Soviets about $6 million
worth of computer equipment for oil exploration. The Soviets have
made this area a priority and Gorbachev announced an oil exploration
agreement had been signed with Chevron Corp. during the Washington
summit.
   Rick Berglund, a Control Data spokesman, said the approval
process for the oil exploration equipment is just beginning.
   The equipment sales come at a time when Control Data is
struggling to turn around years of losses and shift its business
more toward computer services. The company lost a total of $1.4
billion in the second half of the 1980s and was forced to retrench,
selling subsidiaries that made computer chips and disk drives and
folding its supercomputer business.
   Computer products still make up the largest division at Control
Data, but demand for the company's upper-range mainframes has
declined in each of the past two years.

<HEAD>China to Open First Futures Market in August</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China this summer will open what it says is the
first futures market in a socialist country, an official newspaper
reported.
   The market will open in August in the central city of Zhengzhou
and will handle wheat transactions, the China Daily said Sunday.
   If the market is successful, the government may open futures
markets for corn in the northeast city of Changchun, rice in the
central city of Wuhan and pigs in southwest China's Sichuan
province, the paper said.
   In the past, China has branded futures markets as a form of
capitalist speculation. The nation's conservative leaders have
stressed that market forces must play a subsidiary role in China's
planned economy.
   A futures market allows traders and producers to negotiate a set
price for a commodity at a given future date. The seller is
guaranteed that price regardless of subsequent fluctuations in the
market.
   Although most Chinese agricultural products must be sold to the
state for a set price, an estimated 65 million tons of agricultural
commodities circulate in the free market every year.
   Poor regulation of the free market has led to wild price
fluctuations for produce and livestock and serious supply-demand
gaps.
   The paper said foreign dealers will not be allowed to participate
in the Zhengzhou market at the outset.
   But in February, the Chicago Board of Trade signed a memo of
understanding in which it agreed to help the Chinese government set
up futures markets.

   Robert Noyce, who revolutionized electronics
by co-inventing the semiconductor and later sought to revive
American chip-making as head of the government-industry consortium
Sematech, died Sunday of a heart attack. He was 62.
   Noyce suffered a heart attack at his Austin home Sunday morning
and was pronounced dead minutes after his arrival at Seton Medical
Center, hospital spokeswoman Elizabeth McDonald said.
   Working separately in the late 1950s, Noyce and Jack Kilby
invented the integrated circuit, which made rapid gains in computer
power possible by putting multiple transistors on a single chip.
   The Silicon Valley pioneer also was one of the founders of Intel
Corp., the nation's third-largest semiconductor producer, and fought
for the creation of a consortium to promote the American industry.
   ``He was really a legend within the electronics industry,''
spokesman Jim Jarrett said from Intel's Santa Clara, Calif.
headquarters.
   ``He was always referred to as the mayor of Silicon Valley
because he was such a respected and loved figure in the industry.''
   ``Bob was an instrumental figure in creating what has become a
$50 billion industry and semiconductors are the driving force behind
a $500 billion electronics industry,'' said Stan Victor, a spokesman
for Texas Instruments Inc. ``He will be missed.''
   In 1988, Noyce was appointed as the first chief executive officer
and president of Sematech, which was set up to help the United
States recover world leadership in semiconductor manufacturing.
   That leadership was essential to the nation's economic and
military security, he said, and American companies would have to
adopt the cooperative practices of their Japanese competitors to
regain it.
   After first taking himself out of the running for the job, Noyce
said he accepted the post because ``it finally dawned on me it was
far too important for someone else to do. I had to do it myself.''
   The Austin-based consortium, which includes Intel, Texas
Instruments and 12 other U.S. chip makers, has an annual budget of
$200 million provided by the government and manufacturers.
   Sematech spokesman Joe Stroop said the consortium's management
was deep enough to withstand Noyce's death.
   Noyce had asked Sematech's directors last April to begin a search
for his eventual successor, Stroop said. Noyce did not said when he
wanted to step down but ``had indicated he was willing to relinquish
daily operational control,'' he said.
   Noyce had established a three-member management team consisting
of himself, chief operating officer Turner E. Hasty and chief
administrative officer Peter H. Mills, Stroop said.
   ``The office of chief executive will continue to function while
we search for a successor,'' he said.
   ``There's a very solid infrastructure there and it should
continue on with no problem,'' Intel's Jarrett said of the
consortium.
   In addition to his Sematech duties, Noyce had retained his title
as Intel's vice chairman and was an active member of the board of
directors, Jarrett said.
   Noyce was born Dec. 12, 1927, in Burlington, Iowa. He was
graduated from Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, with bachelor's
degrees in physics and mathematics and membership in Phi Beta Kappa.
Noyce earned his Ph.D. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology in 1953.
   He became a researcher at Philco Corp., then later moved to the
Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. He co-founded Fairchild
Semiconductor Corp. in 1957, where he and Kilby of Texas Instruments
separately invented the integrated circuit.
   In 1968, Noyce and longtime associate Gordon E. Moore founded
Intel Corp.
   Noyce was awarded the National Medal of Technology by President
Reagan in 1987 and the National Medal of Science from President
Carter in 1980. He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of
Fame in 1983 and elected to the U.S. Business Hall of Fame last year.
   In February, Noyce and Kilby were presented the first Charles
Stark Draper Award by President Bush.
   ``Integrated circuits have enabled us to do the unimaginable,''
Bush said at the awards ceremony. ``Now, it is unimaginable to
believe we could ever live without them. The microchip ... helped
America change the world.''
   Noyce held 16 patents for semiconductor devices, methods and
structures. He was a founding member and first president of the
Semiconductor Industry Association.
   He also was a member of the National Academy of Science, National
Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Science.
   Noyce is survived by his wife, Ann Bowers; four children and 12
grandchildren. Funeral arrangements were pending, according to
Darryl Thompson of Weed-Corley Funeral Home.

<HEAD>Captains Of U.S. Industry Meet For Visit With Gorbachev</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev pleaded
with some of America's most prominent capitalists Sunday for their
cooperation in reforming his country's sputtering economy.
   ``The important question is, `What kind of Soviet Union does the
president and the U.S. people want to see?''' Gorbachev asked during
a 90-minute session with businessmen at a hotel. ``A Soviet Union
that is in turmoil, or a noble democratic state that is moving?''
   He said the Soviet Union has spent the last five years sorting
out ways to reform its centrally planned economy into one that is at
least partly market-driven. Among other things, the Soviets will
need help in changing decade-old management ideas, he said.
   ``The old system of running the economy has become weaker and the
entire structure of the market economy is only beginning,'' he said.
``It is very difficult to abandon those old ways.''
   The recent unveiling of an economic reform plan that called for a
doubling of some food prices and the gradual privatization of some
state enterprises triggered panic buying that left store shelves
bare in some Soviet cities.
   Gorbachev said the Soviet economy is troubled because it is
caught in a period of change. If economic reforms are successful, he
said, civic unrest will end.
   ``When we begin such a project we feel we need American business
because it is so big,'' Gorbachev said.
   The Soviet leader expressed gratitude for 150 joint business
ventures now under way with companies in the U.S. The deals are
improving Soviet efforts in food distribution, automation, medicine
and farming, he said.
   American companies doing business in the Soviet Union will be
rewarded with expanded business in the future, Gorbachev said. He
warned that ``those who just stand on the sidelines who do not want
to risk'' will remain on the sidelines when the Soviet economy is
prospering.
   Gorbachev was welcomed to the hotel by Dwayne Andreas, chairman
of Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., one of the United States' leading
farm products companies.
   ``To me, Gorbachev is the man of the century,'' Andreas said.
   When Gorbachev's visit to Minnesota was first announced, Soviet
organizers said the business meeting was his biggest priority. He
was to take questions from the executives at the end of the session.
   The 145-name guest list included General Motors Corp. Chairman
Roger Smith, International Business Machines Corp. Chairman John
Akers, August Busch III of Anheuser-Busch Co., Roger Enrico of
Pepsico, H. Lawrence Fuller of Amoco Corp., Frank Popoff of Dow
Chemical Co. and Whitney MacMillan of Minnesota-based Cargill Inc.,
the private grain marketer that is the Soviet Union's largest
private trading partner.
