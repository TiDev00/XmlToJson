<TEXT>
   Enrico Coveri, an Italian fashion
designer known for his use of bright colors and sequins, has died
of a stroke, his company reported. He was 38.
   Coveri died Friday at home in Florence, said public relations
director Paolo Landi.
   Coveri became a success in his early 20s, designing women's
clothes with simple, free lines. He often worked with knits and was
known for tunics covered with large spangles.
   He also produced a perfume called Paillettes, named for the
spangles.
   In recent years, he designed collections for men and children.
   In 1982 he produced his first sport collection, which included a
line of jeans.
   Two years later Coveri opened a boutique in Paris, where he
presented his ready-to-wear shows for women twice a year. His
collections of men's fashions were shown in Milan and Florence.
   His clothes were exported worldwide and were a $180 million
business, according to the Italian news agency ANSA.
   Coveri is survived by his mother Diana; a brother and a sister,
his company said. Funeral plans were not immediately available.

   An ex-convict shouting ``give me a
house'' burst into a town council meeting and opened fire with two
revolvers, killing two councilors, police said.
   The alleged gunman, Michele Manzulli, 50, had spent weeks asking
for public housing in Torremaggiore, about 140 miles east of Rome,
police said.
   Councilors Lucio Palma and Antonio Piacquadio were killed on the
spot in the Thursday melee. Councilor Severino Carlucci and the
mayor, Pietro Liberatore, were wounded.
   Other councilors managed to dive under tables and behind chairs
to avoid the shower of bullets, police said.
   Manzulli fled in a car but was captured by police.
   He had recently been released after serving a prison sentence
for murdering his brother in 1976, newspapers reported.
   The mayor, struck in the head and neck by bullets, was in
guarded condition Friday. The councilor was not seriously wounded
and was listed in stable condition.

   The environmental group Greenpeace
said it has found indications of radioactive material leaking from
a French nuclear test site at Mururoa in the South Pacific.
   Greenpeace spokesman Rick Humphries said Friday that initial
tests outside the 12-mile exclusion zone around Mururoa atoll have
found traces of radioactive cobalt 60 and caesium 134 in plankton.
   Humphries said Greenpeace has invited scientists based at
Mururoa from France's Atomic Energy Commission to discuss the
results.
   ``The presence of any artificial radioactivity as far as 12
miles from the nuclear test site completely undermines France's
claims that testing nuclear bombs under Mururoa is safe,''
Greenpeace France president Alain Connan said. There was no
immediate reply from French scientists at the site.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II has named the first bishop
from the powerful religious organization Opus Dei, which promotes
traditional Christian values.
   Monsignor Alvaro Del Portillo, a 76-year-old Spaniard, was named
titular bishop-for-life on Friday.
   The appointment reflected John Paul's esteem for Opus Dei, a
conservative religious group founded by a Spanish priest in 1928.
   The mainly lay organization says it has 75,000 members,
including 1,400 priests, in more than 80 countries.
   Members of the group take vows of poverty, chastity and
obedience. The organization has been criticized by some Roman
Catholic priests because of its secretive nature.
   Del Portillo joined Opus Dei in 1935 and was ordained a priest
in 1944.
   In 1982, after the pope elevated Opus Dei to a level nearly
equal to a religious order, DelPortillo was named prelate of the
Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei.

   Poland is considering mobilizing troops to
battle a Soviet invasion - of refugees.
   An official said Friday that food shortages and worsening
conditions in the Soviet Union could bring an influx of refugees.
The plans include the possibility of deploying troops on Poand's
eastern border.
   But Col. Zbigniew Skoczylas, head of the new refugee bureau at
the Ministry of the Interior, called the use of troops a ``science
fiction'' scenario.
   Poland, which is also undergoing hardships while making the
transition to a market economy, predicts it could be swamped by up
to 2 million Soviets of Polish origin, mainly from Ukraine and
Byelorussia.
   ``If this horror was to happen, Poland would fall apart as a
state, as an economic system, in two or three months,'' said
Skoczylas.
   Travel restrictions for Soviet citizens are scheduled to be
lifted next year.

<TEXT>
   Jean Duceppe, an actor and crusading Quebec
separatist, has died after a long illness. He was 67.
   The cause of his death Friday was not disclosed.
   Born in Montreal's mainly French-speaking east end, Duceppe's
career in film, television, radio and theater spanned five decades.
The late Quebec Premier Rene Levesque awarded him the ``Ordre
National,'' the province's highest honor.
   Duceppe also was known as a union activist and ardent Quebec
nationalist.
   One of his last public appearances was before thousands of
flag-waving Quebecers at a musical show last June. But he extended
a hand to English-speaking Quebecers by saying the province belongs
to all who love it.
   In August, he left his hospital bed to campiign for his son,
Gilles, who was elected in east Montreal as the first member of
Parliament to run under the ``Bloc Quebecois'' banner.
   Premier Robert Bourassa called Duceppe a ``giant'' and a
``pillar of the theater with remarkable talent.''
   After starting his acting career on the stage in 1941, Duceppe
went on to become a television pioneer. In 1952, he played in the
first televised theatrical production on Radio-Canada, a French
network.
   His fame spread to English-speaking Canada with his depiction of
a small-time hustler in the 1950s TV series ``The Plouffe Family,''
broadcast in French and English.
   Duceppe also founded a theater company that bears his name and
is still active.
   He is survived by his wife Helene and seven children.

   An effort by 107 nations to come up
with new rules governing world trade was widely viewed as a crucial
first test of global economic cooperation in the post-Cold War
period.
   But after five days of frustrating stalemate, the delegates
admitted failure Friday and went home.
   That defeat, many fear, could have far-flung repercussions,
resulting in increasing trade frictions, rising protectionism and
possibly even an all-out global trade war.
   The trade negotiations, known as the Uruguay Round for the
country where the talks began in 1986, had been scheduled to wind
up with five days of bargaining on a 291-page document to govern
trade flow between nations into the 21st century.
   However, the delegates never came close to agreement because of
a fight between the United States and the 12-nation European
Community over farm subsidies.
   The talks are expected to resume in late January in Geneva among
lower-level negotiators.
   The United States, backed by Australia, Brazil and other major
farm exporters, was seeking sharp reductions in subsidies. The
Europeans claimed the U.S. proposal would force more than 2 million
of its 10 million farmers off the land.
   At the end, both sides bittery complained about the
intransigence of the other.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said that a compromise
proposal put forward by Sweden to break the impasse had been
``rejected by a few countries with substantial economic strength,
who were not prepared to negotiate fundamental agricultural
reform.''
   In addition to the European Community, the United States
expressed unhappiness with the intransigence of the Japanese, who
were unwilling to open their closed rice market.
   Hills and other members of the U.S. delegation said there would
be no point to beginning negotiations in Geneva until the European
Community showed more flexibility.
   And the EC gave no hint of any change in its bargaining stance.
EC Agriculture Secretary Ray MacSharry of Ireland said: ``We have
what we believe to be a very concrete proposal on the table.''
   Officials conceded the dispute had put a strain on relations
between the United States and some of its biggest trading partners,
the European Community and Japan.
   There was speculation, which Hills did not rebut, that the
United States might begin taking a series of retaliatory actions
against other countries based on charges that American companies
were being kept out of foreign markets.
   Those disputes involved the Japanese rice market and purchases
of farm products including pork and beef in Europe. Farm groups in
the United States have already asked the administration to
retaliate in these matters.
   ``Those petitions are on my desk and we will be assessing them
under the law,'' Hills said. ``We pledged when we took office to
uphold the law.''
   If the U.S. does retaliate against farm imports from Europe and
Japan, it would more than likely spark similar moves against
American products.
   Some members of Congress said the failure to reach an agreement
is likely to swell protectionist sentiment in Congress.
   ``The U.S. continues to be a leader of the world trading system.
But we can no longer afford to go it alone,'' said House Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., one of the leading advocates of
using retaliatory measures to force open foreign markets.
   It is also likely the trade battle could spill over into other
foreign policy concerns, just as the United States is counting on a
unified front in the campaign to force Iraq from Kuwait.
   The trade talks are being held under the auspices of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the organization charged with
policing international trade rules.
   In recent years, the GATT rules have been swamped by economic
events. Trade in important areas such as agriculture, textiles and
the fast-growing service industries of banking and the like are not
even covered by GATT.
   To correct these problems, the United States had pushed an
ambitious agenda seeking to include the $1 trillion in world trade
not now covered by GATT rules.
   The freer markets expected to result would expand export
opportunities for U.S. businesses and farmers and thus help to
lower American's trade deficit, still stuck at around $100 billion
a year.

<HEAD>U.S. Speeding Military Aid to Salvadoran Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States will speed millions of
dollars in military aid to El Salvador to combat leftist guerrillas
said to have used computer-aided Soviet missiles to shoot down two
Salvadoran warplanes.
   Bush administration officials said a spent canister from an
advanced Soviet-made, A-14 surface-to-air missile has been found
near the area where one of the aircraft was destroyed.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Friday that
the $48.1 million in aid, approved by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, will allow the Salvadoran government to replace
equipment, including planes, damaged or destroyed in the rebel
attacks that began Nov. 20.
   The attacks have caused some 500 casualties in seven of the
Central American country's 14 provinces, officials said, adding
that the dead and injured include government troops, FMLN
guerrillas and Salvadoran civilians.
   The administration officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the rebels used a surface-to-air missile,
apparently an A-14, to shoot down a Salvadoran A-37 fighter-bomber
on Nov. 23.
   A guerrilla missile also destroyed an AC-47 gunship plane on
Tuesday, they said.
   The officials said it had been known at the time of an FMLN
offensive last year that the rebels had received A-7 surface-to-air
missiles and possibly American-made Redeye missiles as well.
   The officials said they now have evidence that the guerrillas
have obtained and are using sophisticated, computer-guided A-14
missiles, a weapon with longer range and greater capability than
the A-7.
   ``It would appear that the FMLN have recently introduced into El
Salvador a new, very sophisticated generation of surface-to-air
missiles, one official said, referring to the A-14.
   The officials said a canister from a Soviet A-14 missile was
found in ``approximately the same location'' in eastern El Salvador
where the A-37 was shot down.
   One official said A-14 missiles are known to exist in the
Western Hemisphere only in Nicaragua, whose armed forces are under
the control of leftist Sandinistas, and in Cuba.
   Salvadoran forces discovered 24 SA-7 missiles and one U.S.
Redeye in a small plane that crashed in El Salvador last year.
   The official said that flight originated in Nicaragua and was
organized by Cuba and the Sandinistas. He said the Redeye could
have been captured by the Sandinistas from the now-disbanded Contra
rebel force in Nicaragua.
   He noted that the Salvadoran guerillas recently have claimed
publicly that they now possess A-7, A-14 and Redeye missiles.
   ``We have information arms shipments do continue from Nicaragua
both by land and by sea,'' the official said,
   But he said he is confident they are being organized without the
assistance or knowledge of Nicaragua's democratically elected
president, Violeta Chamorro.
   Of the $48.1 million total in aid, $10.6 million will come from
money left from the $81 million Congress appropriated for the
Salvadoran armed forces in fiscal 1990, which ended Sept. 30. The
remaining $37.5 million will be drawn from the $85 million
appropriated for the current fiscal year.
   Under conditions imposed by Congress, the final half of the
current year's appropriation can be released only if the guerrillas
launch an offensive that threatens the survival of the Salvadoran
government.
   Ms. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said the money
was intended ``to help the government of El Salvador face the
serious new escalation in FMLN guerrilla offensive actions.''
   She said the administration will continue to review the
offensive, including its use of surface-to-air missiles, ``to
determine whether additional military assistance withheld and
conditioned by Congress should be released.''

   Theresa Murphy is playing a dangerous game.
   In her mind, she has already embraced her father; welcomed him
home from four months of captivity at the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait.
   ``Against my will, I am picturing him home, bouncing my daughter
on his knee,'' Mrs. Murphy said from Fremont, Calif. ``I'm
picturing him walking off the plane ... My emotions are flooding
back and it's painful.''
   Though thrilled at the prospect of having their loved ones home
for Christmas, families won't truly rest until Saddam Hussein makes
good on his promise Thursday to release 900 U.S. hostages in Iraq
and Kuwait.
   By Friday, 17-year-old Kevin Hale had already been reunited in
Baghdad with his dad, an oil worker who was held as a ``human
shield.'' The father and son were confident they'd soon be headed
home to Spring, Texas.
   ``I talked to Ed for the first time today,'' Patricia Hale said
after a phone call from her husband Friday. ``I guess they had
quite a party last night ... with everybody in the hotel. It was
quite a celebration.''
   Kevin Hale was among a group of 18 Americans who, against State
Department advice, went to seek their relatives' freedom. Iraqi
officials had arranged a reunion at a Baghdad hotel, where they
were gathered when the big news broke.
   ``It's just so emotional for everybody being together and then
to have an announcement of such magnitude,'' said Mrs. Hale.
``Imagine the feeling!''
   State Department officials said they have asked Iraq to waive
exit visa requirements, but there was no immediate response. The
government did say foreigners could begin leaving as early as
Saturday.
   Americans in Baghdad raised beer mugs to toast their impending
freedom Friday after the Iraqi parliament overwhelmingly approved
Saddam's directive.
   Thomas Van Baale of Des Moines, Iowa, said from Baghdad that he
expected to return to the United States with his father-in-law,
Charles Keegan, in a few days.
   ``We are going to stay and bring Chuck home with us,'' said Van
Baale, whose sister-in-law, Peggy Keegan, also made the trip. The
pair was reunited with Keegan accidentally Thursday.
   ``Peg and I were outside getting some fresh air and Chuck was
driven up in a pickup,'' Van Baale said. ``Chuck ran up the steps
and it was a happy, emotional reunion.
   ``He was so happy to see two friendly faces after all these
months.''
   For many hostage families, the hows and wheres of such a reunion
remained unclear.
   ``I have to decide in the next hour or two whether to cancel my
ticket (to Baghdad) or not,'' said Debbie Willis, who was separated
from her husband after Iraqi troops caught the couple in an escape
attempt.
   ``I don't know what I'm going to do,'' said Mrs. Willis, who was
among the women and children subsequently freed. ``I'm going to
find in him, though, whether in Boston, New York, Washington,
whatever. I'll be wherever he goes.''

<HEAD>Panel Says Milk Stimulant Hormone Poses No Hazard To Humans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A genetically engineered hormone that forces
cows to give more milk and calves to grow faster poses no health
hazard to humans who eat the products from treated herds, a
government committee concludes.
   The panel's findings were announced Friday at a news conference
that was interrupted repeatdly by protestors who shouted questions
and attempted to make speeches about the hormone, called
recombinant bovine somatotropin, or BST.
   Dr. Melvin M. Grumbach of San Francisco, chairman of the
13-member committee convened by the National Institutes of Health,
said that following three days of intensive review of research on
the hormone, the panel agreed unanimously that milk and meat from
BST-treated cows is safe for humans.
   The committee also decided, however, that more research was
needed to determine the effects of the hormone on a dairy cow
disorder, and to search for possible effects on the human digestive
tract of a tiny elevation of a growth factor in the stimulated
milk.
   ``This is absurd,'' one protestor shouted. ``How can you say it
is safe and then that you need more studies?''
   Grumbach, a pediatrics professor at the University of
California, said the committee was confident that BST could safely
be used in dairy herds.
   ``The evidence clearly indicates that the overall composition
and nutritional quality of milk and meat from BST-treated cows is
equal to that from untreated cows,'' he said.
   Following the announcement, a question-and-answer session for
reporters was repeatedly interrupted by two longtime opponents of
BST, Jeremy Rifkin of the Foundation on Economic Trends, and Samuel
Epstein of the University of Illinois.
   Recombinant BST is a manufactured version of a naturally
occurring hormone in cows. Scientists have known for decades that
shots of the natural hormone causes cows to increase milk
production by up to 15 percent and forces faster growth in young
calves. There has been only rare use of the natural hormone in the
dairy industry, however, because of its high cost.
   In recent years, several drug companies have used genetic
engineering to produce a form of BST and have determined that the
hormone can be made cheaply enough to be of practical use. The
firms have asked the Food and Drug Administration to approve the
manufactured hormone for use in dairy herds.
   Opponents contend that meat and milk from cattle injected with
the manufactured BST will have higher levels of insulin-like growth
factor, or IGF1, and that it will lead to wider use of antibiotics
in dairy cattle.
   Rifkin and Epstein also argue that BST will cause cattle to have
increased incidence of mastitis, an inflammation of the udder, and
have reproduction problems.
   The committee recommended research to evaluate the mastitis
connection, but it said the hormone ``does not appear to affect
appreciably the general health of dairy cows.''
   The panel, which included two veterinarians and a dairy farmer,
said research shows the levels of IGF1 in milk from BST-treated
cows would double, but that even with the increase the amounts are
too small to have an effect on most humans.
   Dr. Raymond L. Hintz, a pediatrician from Stanford University,
said adult human saliva normally contains IGF1 at a much higher
concentration than is found in BST-treated milk. He noted that IGF1
is a protein that is normally metabolized by the intestines in
humans and does not enter the bloodstream.
   Hintz said there was some slight concern by the panel that the
increased IGF1 could have some effect on newborn babies. The
committee called for research to examine the IGF1 effects on the
upper gastrointestinal tract, particularly the esophagus, in
newborns.
   Grumbach acknowleged that the FDA did not give the panel
information from an ongoing study of BST used on 20,000 diary cows.
He said that when the study is completed, the ``committee's
conclusion regarding animal health may have to be modified.''
   Committee members also conceded under questioning that most of
the data studied came from companies that manufacture BST or from
investigators whose work is financed by industry.
   Dr. David Rush, a professor of nutrition at Tufts University,
said companies pay millions to underwrite the research in hopes of
getting government approval to sell the hormone.
   ``That's the American system,'' he said.

   Sears led the way as retailers nationwide
slashed prices and launched big advertising campaigns in hopes of
brightening what looks to be a gloomy Christmas shopping season.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. began an aggressive nationwide television
and radio drive Thursday night promoting steep markdowns on
clothing and incentives like no-interest financing on major
appliances.
   The company is advertising ``after-Christmas prices just in time
for Christmas.''
   Sears and other big national retailers announced Thursday that
their sales fell in November from last year's levels as consumers
translated worries about the economy and the Middle East into
reduced holiday spending.
   As Christmas nears, storeowners are growing nervous.
   ``We looked at the trends through the end of November and have
anticipated those trends would continue,'' Matthew Howard, Sears'
senior vice president for marketing, said Friday.
   Sears is advancing by several weeks planned markdowns on winter
clothes, particularly coats. Warmer weather in many parts of the
country has stalled winter clothing sales.
   Howard said Sears is trying to boost its flagging sales of
big-ticket items by waiving interest charges on major appliances
and home electronics items between now and March.
   Appliances, furniture and other expensive merchandise has been
hit the hardest by the drop in consumer spending that began as the
economy slowed and worsened after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. has also marked down prices, but unlike
Sears, it is not instituting a companywide program, spokesman
Duncan Muir said Friday.
   ``In markets where business is slow, there'll be more
promotions,'' Muir said, noting that sales have been particularly
sluggish in the Northeast.
   Janet Mangano, an analyst with Jesup, Josephthal &amp; Co. Inc.,
said more ``sale'' signs will appear if business does not soon
improve.
   ``Next week is it. They won't be able to hold out'' if sales do
not pick up, she said.
   Muir said Penney would decide price reductions ``on a day-by-day
basis, especially when you're in this critical time.''
   Although customers in many stores have been seeing price
reductions all along, most were planned in advance. Retailers, who
normally expect to make half their annual profits at Christmas,
have resisted taking bigger cuts because of the devastating effect
such cuts can have on their balance sheets.
   The latest reductions should not hurt Sears earnings, Howard
said.
   The 20 percent to 40 percent markdowns on clothing are less than
the 30 percent to 50 percent reductions that would have been posted
later in the month, although more merchandise is affected now.
   Many retailers expect business to improve in the 10 days before
Christmas, and hope for a big weekend right before the 25th, which
falls on a Tuesday.
   They want to avoid the severe price cuts that made for a
disastrous Christmas for some companies last year. But consumers,
besides being more budget conscious this year, have learned that
they may get better prices if they postpone their shopping until
the last minute.
   R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc., hit hard by markdowns last year, has made
fewer reductions this season and does not expect to change its
strategy, said spokesman James Fingeroth.
   On Thursday, Sears said November sales at its stores open at
least a year fell 2.4 percent from a year ago, while the company's
overall sales slipped 1.6 percent.

<HEAD>Top U.S. Trade Officials Move On to Represent Foreign Interests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top U.S. trade officials regularly represent
overseas interests after leaving public service, and some
government trade advisers are also registered as foreign agents, a
private study says.
   But an ethics officer for the Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative denied such conflict of interest among the agency's
unpaid advisers and said a new law taking effect next month will
prohibit quick switchovers in jobs.
   The 90,000-word report, which profiles 74 current and former
senior officers of the agency, said 47 percent of past USTR
officials either went to work for businesses registered with the
Justice Department as foreign agents or were registered as foreign
agents themselves.
   Others worked for foreign interests but failed to register under
inadequate laws, said the report released Friday by the Center for
Public Integrity.
   The report said the USTR office, which conducts trade
negotiations with other nations, has become ``a training ground for
foreign lobbyists.''
   Center director Charles Lewis said the agency has some of the
best-educated, most competent people in the federal government. But
he said too many of its highest officials go on to work for some of
American industry's toughest competitors.
   The year-old center is financed by foundations, labor unions,
news media clients and other companies, including some that would
benefit from freer trade.
   ``I don't think any of us expected there to be so many of
America's best and brightest men and women in the most important
U.S. trade policy positions later going to work for this country's
economic adversaries,'' Lewis said at a news conference.
   He added that the report uncovered no illegal activity or
lackluster performance by trade officials in negotiations with
companies they or their firms later represented.
   Barbara Gordon, ethics officer for the USTR general counsel's
office, said the agency headed by Carla A. Hills is cautious about
possible conflicts but that former officials are not now bound by
its strict standards of conduct.
   A law to take effect in January will prohibit any high-level
government official from going to work for a foreign entity within
one year of leaving public service.
   The report identified Washington attorney Richard Fairbanks as a
trade office adviser whose law firm represented Iraq for four
years. Fairbanks' office said the firm had not represented the
Middle Eastern nation since March, five months before Iraq took
over Kuwait.
   ``We know of no instance where an adviser did or could have used
his or her position as an adviser to the benefit of a foreign
interest client or to the detriment of the United States,'' Ms.
Gordon told a reporter.
   She said the trade office was aware that Fairbanks' firm had
represented Iraq, but the law firm did not handle trade matters.
The unpaid advisers serve on panels of 30 to 150 people who report
by consensus, and thus no one person affects decisions alone, Ms.
Gordon said.
   The report lists former Trade Representatives William Eberle and
William Brock as among officials whose firms have worked for
foreign governments or companies.
   Eberle's company, Manchester Associates, has advised and lobbied
for Nissan Motor Corp. of Japan since the late 1970s, and the Brock
Group has done work for the government of Taiwan, Toyota and Airbus
Industries, the study said.
   Manchester President John Moller said Eberle, who is the firm's
chairman, did not do any work for Nissan until five years after he
left the trade post in 1974. But Moller said the group's study
raises questions about former government officials that ``probably
need to be addressed.''
   Brock's secretary said he was in Brussels and unavailable for
comment.
   Lewis, in releasing the report, said it is ``jarring evidence
that America has lost public service as an ideal.''
   ``We do not expect American arms control negotiators to quit
government and go to work for the Soviets. We do not expect
American generals to leave government and go to work for Iraq,'' he
said.
   ``And Americans do not expect top U.S. trade officials to leave
government and go to work for those companies and governments which
are actively competing against the U.S. in the world marketplace.''

<HEAD>FDA Stresses Sterility Rules For Pharmacists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's pharmacists are being asked by
the Food and Drug Administration to make sure they are not making
and selling impure compounds and solutions.
   In a letter sent to pharmacists this week, the FDA cited two
recent incidences of contamination in which four people died and
two lost sight in one eye.
   The FDA's correspondence issued a ``strong reminder'' to
pharmacists that they must follow standard manufacturing controls
to ensure sterility of the drugs they make.
   The agency has been investigating pharmacies that do a
substantial amount of work preparing special mixtures, compounds
and solutions for hospitals and consumers, spokesman William Grigg
said Friday.
   Though pharmacists generally are regulated by the states, when
they make a drug, they must follow the same federally required
procedures - the Food and Drug Administration's ``Good
Manufacturing Practices'' rules - imposed on drug companies.
   If pharmacists do not follow these practices, they could be
subject to the same sanctions as drug companies, which can include
product seizures, fines and criminal prosecution, Grigg said.
   The two instances in which contaminated solutions caused
infections resulted from incorrect production methods by
pharmacies, the agency said.
   The FDA said in the letter that it ``has determined that other
pharmacies are also using incorrect procedures and controls for the
batch production of drug products intended to be sterile.''
   Some pharmacies also are packaging non-preserved sterile
solutions in multiple dose containers, which the FDA called
``unacceptable.''
   ``These matters are of serious concern to the FDA,'' the agency
said.
   The American Pharmaceutical Association, a trade association for
pharmacists, said the FDA's warning was appropriate.
   ``We're concerned about ... people making sure they take
precautions to prevent contamination of sterilized products,'' said
Arthur Kibbe, senior director for pharmacy affairs for the
association. ``The agency was correct in reminding everybody of
it.''
   In the most recent contamination cases, two women lost an eye
and at least 10 others were treated forserious eye infections last
month after using bacteria-contaminated drops made by a pharmacy in
Pittsburgh.
   In Lincoln, Neb., four patients died after being exposed to a
tainted solution used in open heart surgery at Bryan Memorial
Hospital last May and June. The solution was mixed at the hospital
pharmacy.
   Many of the pharmacies that make drug products in batches are
those in hospitals and nursing homes, and most of that work is in
mixing intravenous solutions, Kibbe said.
   Most community pharmacists spend their time filling individual
prescriptions for standard medications. However, they sometimes
will be called upon to combine different medications into a single
solution or a capsule, he said.

   Another aircraft carrier battle group was
setting sail today for the Middle East.
   The USS Ranger and seven escort ships were leaving their home
ports in San Diego and Long Beach, Calif.
   The carrier, with about 75 aircraft on its flight deck, will
join three others already supporting Operation Desert Shield in the
northern Arabian Sea, the Red Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean,
the Pentagon said Friday.
   Two other carriers - the USS America and the USS Theodore

complete a doubling of American carrier strength in the Middle
East.
   Also on Friday, the Army said elements of the 2nd Armored

approximately 5,000 troops in the regiment have arrived.
   The Army also announced that it alerted an undisclosed number of
National Guard and Reserve members in 10 states to be prepared to
report for active duty for Desert Shield.
   The Marine Corps announced the call-up of 334 reservists from
California and Georgia. Those from California are to report for
active duty Dec. 18 at the Marine Corps Air-Ground Combat Center at
Twentynine Palms, Calif.; those from Georgia are to report to Camp
Lejeune, N.C., on Dec. 10.
   The Navy said it activated 289 reservists from 15 states and the

   Pete Rose confirmed earlier reports that he'll
abandon his longtime hometown and move to Florida after gets out of
prison.
   Rose told a Cincinnati television station in an interview
broadcast Friday that after completing court-ordered community
service in the city where he grew up, played baseball and later
managed the Cinncinati Reds, he'll head south to Boca Raton, Fla.
   Banned from baseball for life because of gambling, Rose said
despite his transgressions he deserves a place in the Hall of Fame.
   ``I don't think of it as a gift,'' Rose said. ``I've given 24
years of my life to baseball. I think I've earned it.''
   Rose, who is baseball's all-time hits leader, began serving a
five-month sentence in August at a federal prison in Illinois for
failing to report gambling income to tax authorities.

   LAS VEGAS (AP) - Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor will appear in Las Vegas
during the New Year's holiday, ending a two-decade hiatus. But
don't ask what she'll be doing.
   ``Don't expect me to sing, don't expect me to do anything and
then you'll be happy,'' she said Thursday. ``Really, I'm too rich
to work too hard.''
   Gabor and Vegas World Hotel owner Bob Stupak teamed up to say
she'll be appearing at the resort's Galaxy Showroom Dec. 28-Jan. 2.
   Gabor said it's been 20 years since she played Vegas, but
admitted she was confused as to where and when she last performed
in the city.
   A publicist said it was the Flamingo Hilton in 1971.

   COATESVILLE, Pa. (AP) - Darren ``Buffy'' Robinson of the rap
group Fat Boys said he thought a 14-year-old girl was 18 when he
videotaped her having sex with another man during a wild party.
   Another teen-age girl told police she invited Robinson and
others to a party in August at her family's mobile home in
Honeybrook Township while her parents were away.
   ``Before anything happened, we asked, `OK, we ain't got no young
ones, right?' They all said they were 18,'' Robinson said Friday.
``It seemed like they had it planned.''
   Robinson, 23; his brother and manager, Curtis Robinson, 27; and
a bodyguard, Pell ``Pony Boy'' Wimeley, 31, all of New York; and
Edward Charles Kelso, 24, of Coatesville, were charged Wednesday
with sexually abusing a minor, corrupting the morals of a minor and
conspiracy, state police said.
   The defendants could face up to 20 years in prison each if
convicted.
   The Fat Boys appeared in the rap films ``Krush Groove'' in 1985
and ``The Disorderlies'' in 1988. Their latest record was ``Coming
Back Hard Again'' in 1988.

   ATLANTA (AP) - Media tycoon Ted Turner revealed a poorly kept
secret when he announced that he and actress Jane Fonda will marry
in about a year.
   ``We're engaged. We are going to wait a year,'' Turner said
Thursday during a private reception before a Variety Club of
Atlanta dinner in his honor.
   Ms. Fonda shyly displayed the engagement ring Turner gave her.
Turner is chairman of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System
Inc., parent company of Cable News Network.
   ``I've been married twice, but I never had one before,'' she
said of the ring, an opal set between two diamonds.
   Turner bought the ring last month. At the time, a publicist for
Ms. Fonda said he planned to give it to her on her birthday, Dec.
21.
   The marriage would be the third for both Ms. Fonda, 52, and
Turner, 51. She has two children, he has five.

   The United States, wary of angering
Israel, has apparently backed away from its earlier support for a
U.N. resolution that would call for an eventual international
conference on the Middle East.
   The U.N. Security Council's president, Ambassador Abdalla Saleh
al-Ashtal of Yemen, said Friday, ``I am very disappointed. We
thought after six weeks we had come to a consensus.''
   Al-Ashtal said the talks broke down over U.S. insistence that
the endorsement of a future peace conference be removed from the
resolution.
   After backing such an idea Wednesday, U.S. officials had issued
a flurry of denials they meant in any way to meet Iraq's
preconditions for a Persian Gulf settlement.
   President Saddam Hussein has demanded an international effort to
solve the Israeli-Arab conflict as part of any gulf accord. U.S.
officials have said there can be no linkage of the two disputes.
   A meeting of the U.N. Security Council on the proposed
resolution was expected this evening. Even though the diplomatic
talks fell apart Friday, the American ambassador to the United
Nations and the State Department were still struggling to work out
some way to avoid casting a veto.
   A veto is apt to upset America's Arab allies in the
multinational force opposing Iraq.
   Complicating the problem was a scheduled meeting today between
U.S. ambassador Thomas R. Pickering and Premier Yitzhak Shamir of
Israel.
   The Israeli leader, who is visiting the United States, said
Thursday that Israel still opposes any international conference on
the Middle East. Shamir, who is also scheduled to confer with
President Bush on Tuesday, said he will seek clarification on the
U.S. stand during his meetings.
   The U.S. Mission to the United Nations was in a particularly
tough spot, because it argued forcefully last week for the U.N.
resolution that authorized use of force if Iraq fails to leave
Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   It suggested that other nations not jeopardize a quick
resolution on that issue by campaigning for the Israeli-Arab
declaration at the same time.
   As a result, a senior U.S. diplomat said privately, some nations
would have ``every right to feel betrayed'' if the United States
didn't go along with any widely accepted Mideast resolution this
week.
   Talks on the new resolution went sour late Friday between
Pickering and the non-aligned nations.
   Malaysian Ambassador Razali Ismail, who represents the seven
non-aligned nations on the 15-member council, said after a series
of meetings with Pickering, ``It appears that the talks cannot go
any further.''
   When asked if the United States would veto the resolution,
Ismail replied, ``That seems to be their national position.''
   Diplomats said the United States was pushing for removal of
language endorsing a peace conference ``at the appropriate time,''
bt the non-aligned nations insisted it be left in.
   U.S. policy has long called for a Middle East peace conference
at some appropriate time in the future, but the United States had
previously blocked the Security Council from adding its voice in
favor of such a plan.

   Members of Congress are protesting a reported
attempt by White House chief of staff John Sununu to block the
reappointment of a top banking regulator faulted for being too
tough.
   Sununu blames Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke for
creating the so-called ``credit crunch'' gripping the Northeast,
government and industry sources said Friday.
   Clarke's five-year term expired Dec. 2; he continues in office
until a successor is appointed. The comptroller is responsible for
overseeing nationally chartered banks and reports to the Treasury
secretary.
   Bankers and borrowers have complained for a year that Clarke's
examiners have overreacted to the savings and loan crisis and are
deepening the economic downturn by discouraging bankers from making
even good loans.
   New Hampshire, where Sununu was governor, has been one of the
states hardest hit by the crackdown.
   According to one source, who demanded anonymity, a group of
large contributors to the Republican Party wrote to President Bush
urging him not to reappoint Clarke.
   Within the last week, White House aides have been calling
bankers and business executives ``asking pointed questions'' about
Clarke, another source said.
   However, members of the House Banking Committee are strongly
defending Clarke.
   ``In my view, bank regulators can never be too tough'' and
Clarke has been ``strong and tough,'' Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill.,
said in a letter to Bush. ``It must be remembered ... the
underlying importance of his job is to protect the American
taxpayers from having to bail out the banking system.''
   ``If there's any lesson of the S&amp;L debacle, it is that financial
institutions that don't recognize their losses early are going to
be greater liabilities later,'' said Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa.
``Clarke has properly been attempting to shore up commercial banks'
balance sheets.''
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said, ``It simply sends the wrong
signal to sack the man who has stood for ... sound banking
regulation.''
   Schumer and two other members of the banking committee, Chairman
Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, and Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., also
expressed their concerns in a letter to Bush. ``Making a scapegoat
of the nation's chief national bank regulator only weakens
regulation of depository institutions and does nothing to solve the
problems of credit availability,'' they wrote.
   Clarke and other regulators maintain they have not tightened
regulation inappropriately. They blame banks' reluctance to lend on
deteriorating real estate markets and on a lack of demand resulting
from the sluggish economy.
   ``One of the difficulties really is that there aren't enough
good loans out there, particularly in certain areas and
particularly in real estate,'' L. William Seidman, chairman of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., told reporters Friday.
   Seidman, who himself has been pressed by Sununu since May to
leave office before his term expires in October, said, ``I did
welcome Bob to the club this morning.''
   Clarke and aides to Sununu did not immediately return telephone
calls seeking comment.
   Sununu's push to oust Clarke comes amid rising concern that a
growing mountain of sour commercial real estate loans will bankrupt
the government insurance fund that protects bank deposits.
   Three private economists are preparing a study for a
subcommittee headed by Annunzio. They are expected to warn the fund
eventually could need a taxpayer bailout.
   Until recently, Clarke's reappointment seemed all but certain.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady was supporting him, albeit
without a lot of enthusiasm, according to the sources.

<TEXT>
   Bored, homesick sailors break
the monotony of Persian Gulf patrols with spending sprees in Dubai,
and they do it for a song.
   American and British sailors from the multinational naval armada
flock to shops in the United Arab Emirates on shore leave, buying
armloads of cheap, pirated music cassettes and videotapes.
   ``The sailors aren't fussy and buy lots of cassettes,'' said
Ishwar Daryanani, owner of the Sound of Space shop in Dubai.
``Knock on wood, we're doing better than normal during these crisis
months.''
   Shops that before Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 sold an
average of about five cassettes a day now sell about 60 a day.
   Shop owners say many sailors buy about 15 tapes at a time, but
some leave with as many as 40 packed away in special carrying
cases.
   Tapes that usually cost about $10 aboard ship or abroad sell for
just over $1 in Dubai, where lax copyright laws allow companies
such as Daryanani's to pirate music cassettes and videotapes.
   Shop owners say most of the American sailors opt for tapes of
M.C. Hammer, Prince or Sybil. But they also buy a lot Madonna and
George Michael or mixed cassettes called ``Hot Black Ninety'' and
``Best in Black.''
   The British tend to buy more Phil Collins, Roxette and Elton
John.
   ``I found quite a good collection of Christmas carols,'' said
Wayne Johnson of Montgomery, Ala., assistant to the chaplin aboard
an American warship.
   Pirated videotapes, also widely available in Dubai, sell for as
little as $10 for copies of some of the latest releases from the
United States and Europe.
   Diryanani said the top-selling video titles are ``Die Hard 2,''
``Total Recall,'' ``Another 48 Hours,'' ``The Hunt For Red
October,'' and ``Dick Tracy.''
   He said other favorites include ``Air America'' and ``Born On
The Fourth Of July'' - two films based on the Vietnam War.
   About a year ago, the United States began a drive to get the
United Arab Emirates to close the loopholes that allow firms such
as Daryanani's to pirate the tapes and export thousands to such
countries as Uganda and Kenya.
   So far the effort has been unsuccessful, and the illicit tape
market continues to flourish.
   Still, despite the crisis-related boom in tape sales, some
merchants lament other missed opportunities.
   ``I've had several customers ask for copies of the Madonna and
Sylvester Stallone posters that I have posted on my wall,'' said S.
Saju of the Moonlight Cassette shop.
   ``But unfortunately, I didn't stock such posters because usually
there's no demand for them here,'' Saju said.

<HEAD>Ruling Says Lower Court Erred in Ordering Tapes Released</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA has another opportunity to show why it
shouldn't be forced to release the taped conversations of
astronauts aboard the space shuttle Challenger moments before it
exploded.
   In a 6-5 ruling Friday, a bitterly divided federal appeals court
held that a lower court erred in ordering the release of the tape
without balancing the public interest against the harm of invading
the privacy of the seven astronauts and their survivors.
   The decision by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia sends the case back to U.S. District Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson, who had ordered the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration in 1987 to release the tapes to The New
York Times.
   The appeals court majority said NASA ``is entitled to an
opportunity to prove its claim that release of the tape would
invade the privacy of the deceased astronats, of their families.''
   The ruling reversed both the original district court opinion and
a 1988 holding by a split three-judge panel of the appeals court
that had upheld the release of the tapes.
   The dispute goes back to a lawsuit the Times filed under the
Freedom of Information Act seeking release of the tapes of cockpit
conversations after liftoff, just moments before Challenger
exploded.
   All seven astronauts died in the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion.
   NASA released a written transcript of the conversations, but the
newspaper contended that an analysis of the audio tapes might help
determine what caused the tragedy.

<HEAD>Elder Bias Pleads for Gun Controls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The father of college basketball star Len
Bias, whose cocaine death triggered an escalation of the war
against drugs, is now calling for stricter gun control laws
following this week's shooting death of his second son.
   ``We need to move now, while we have the interest ... while we
have the people to support us,'' James Bias told reporters Friday
after appearing on Capitol Hill at a forum sponsored by the
Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.
   ``We are under siege here,'' he said. ``We are hostages in our
own homes.'' When his family leaves the house, he said, ``I'm in
constant prayer because I know they're going into the storm.''
   His 20-year-old son Jay was shot to death Tuesday as he left a
shopping mall in suburban Hyattsville, Md. Authorities have charged
Jerry Samuel Tyler, 24, of Temple Hills, Md., with the killing.
They claim Tyler shot Bias twice in the back after accusing him of
flirting with his wife, a jewelry store clerk.
   The younger Bias' funeral was scheduled for today.
   The June 1986 cocaine overdose death of Jay's older brother Len,

<HEAD>IWF Study: Reinforcing Sexual Stereotypes?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An International Women's Forum study that
concluded female managers lead differently than men does not
contribute to sexual stereotypes, its sponsors say.
   The study said women, to a greater extent than men, manage by
personal interaction with their subordinates. It says men are more
likely to manage on a more authoritarian, reward-and-punishment
system.
   ``We are not blaming them. We are not saying it's better or
worse. We are just saying it's different,'' Judy B. Rosener, a
professor in the graduate school of management at the University of
California in Irvine, said at a Friday news conference.
   The study was based on responses from 355 members of the forum,
an organization of prominent women leaders in 16 countries, and 101
men in similar positions.
   It says the typical woman surveyed ``prefers the use of personal
power, that is, power based on her charisma, work record, and
contact, as contrasted with structural power based on the authority
that comes with organizational position, title, and the ability to
reward and punish.''
   Cynthia Maduro Ryan, a Washington lawyer and former corporate
executive who is president of the IWF, said `We are not here in any
way to discredit the command and control or authoritarian style.''
   ``It was basically appropriate and well done for purposes of the
industrial era,'' she said.
   Ms. Rosener said she has received about a hundred telephone
calls about the study since her article on its findings appeared in
the November-December issue of the Harvard Business Review.
   ``People are saying, `Gender has nothing to do with it. You are
really enforcing gender stereotypes','' she said.
   But, she said, ``We are no saying that all women behave one way
and all men behave another way.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. and British hostages say they'll be
leaving Iraq with a deep feeling of good fortune and maybe a new
outlook on life.
   ``If you have your hands in the meat grinder and if you get them
out in one piece, how would you feel?'' said Garry Carr, an
oilworker from Fort Worth, Texas.
   Carr was among 50 to 60 American and British hostages and their
wives who gathered at a Baghdad hotel Friday to sip beer and
celebrate their promised freedom.
   The celebration followed a vote by Iraq's parliament earlier
that day to endorse Presieent Saddam Hussein's call to release all
foreigners trapped in Iraq and occupied Kuwait since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion.
   ``A new character emerges with people who are faced with
adversity,'' said Chris Mayer, 24, of England, who was held as a
``human shield'' at an Iraqi military base north of Baghdad.
   ``I've had my feet on the ground, but you really go through a
self-examination period,'' said Robert Vinton, 58, a Santa Fe, N.M.
businessman who was held at a base south of Baghdad.
   ``I'll become a better person and a better husband after this,''
Vinton added, embracing his wife, Sue.
   ``It is a monumental occasion,'' said Vinton, who had been
brought from the military base to a Baghdad hotel Wednesday to see
his wife. She had come to Baghdad with other American and British
women seeking freedom for their loved ones.
   Hundreds of Americans and other foreigners were held at
strategic installations to deter any foreign attack.
   Carr, the American oilworker, said Iraqi soldiers captured him
in Kuwait in the first hours of the invasion, sent him to Baghdad,
and a few days later to a phosphate plant.
   The hostages had few complaints about their physical treatment,
but they said Iraqi soldiers had stolen their belongings.
   ``We were treated extremely well. They tried to get us
everything we asked for,'' Guy Seago, 45, of Johnson City, Tenn.,
said of his guards.
   ``They provided us with what they could. They did their best,''
said Tallmadge Ledford, 45, of Windhow, N.H.
   ``My main complaint was the loss of freedom,'' said Ronald Ginn,
49, a computer consultant from Seattle who was held at two
communications centers in Baghdad.
   He said his house in Kuwait was stripped clean after the
invasion and estimated he had lost $80,000 worth of property.
   Seago said he and the 20 American, British and Japanese hostages
held at an oil refinery in Basra built their own makeshift
nine-hole golf course to pass the time.
   Vinton said he walked at least 15 miles a day to keep in shape
and also kill time. He said he lost 28 pounds.
   Hamid El Miloudi, 46, of Chattanooga, Tenn., until recently had
been one of the Americans who had sought refuge at the besieged
U.S. Embassy in Kuwait.
   El Miloudi said he spent time tending a vegetable garden he
planted at the embassy, which he said provided a lot of fresh
produce for the two dozen or so people stranded there.
   Ginn complained about the monotony of the available food. He
said his group had been fed smoked salmon every day for three
weeks.
   ``I won't be able to look at smoked salmon again,'' he said.

<HEAD>Woman Survives Two Heart Transplants In Same Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 22-year-old woman who suffered a rare form
of heart failure after giving birth survived two heart transplants
in 23 hours, and doctors are shaking their heads over how quickly
they were able to find two donor organs.
   ``The problem she had after delivery itself is unusual. That we
could find a heart in this area at this time is unusual,'' said
Albert Pfister, the cardiac surgeon who brought the second heart
from Florida to Washington.
   ``And that we could find a second heart right when we needed it
almost borders on making you want to become religious.''
   Rita Tyson, 22, of Alexandria, Va., who gave birth to her first
child in August, underwent the first transplant Nov. 13.
   Two hours after surgery, her body began violently rejecting the
new organ.
   Doctors at Washington Hospital Center began administering
immuno-suppressant drugs, but within hours physicians realized that
if Tyson was to live she needed another new heart.
   At 5 a.m., a second heart was located. That same day doctors
began yet another transplant and by midnight, a new heart was
pumping in Tyson's chest.
   ``I know I could have died,'' Tyson said this week. ``I'm never
going to take anything for granted again.''
   Neither are her doctors. The team of surgeons, nurses and other
medical staff who toiled on Tyson for four days straight are still
talking about the rare hyper-acute rejection of the first heart -
it occurs in less than 1 percent of all transplants - and what
they, in hospital vernacular, call ``a great save.''
   ``Fortunately both operations went like clockwork,'' said Steven
Boyce, who with Pfister heads the hospital's transplant program.
   Tyson had no history of heart disease and, according to her
doctors, had a healthy pregnancy and an uncomplicated delivery.
   One in 4,000 women may develop such failure after delivery. Of
these, only one in 15,000 has a totally unexplained onset. Tyson
was the one in 15,000.

<TEXT>
   Troops have fatally shot five Tamil
rebels who killed six Sinhalese civilians in northeastern Sri
Lanka, military officials said today.
   The officials, requesting anonymity, said the rebels were killed
by a military patrol shortly after they killed the civilians in the
village of Pachchanur south of Trincomalee on Friday.
   The officials said the civilian victims included two women and
two children.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed since 1983 when Tamil
militants launched a separatist insurgency to set up a homeland for
their ethnic minority.
   Tamils, who live mostly in the north and east of the island
nation, claim they are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese in jobs and education.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million people.
Sinhalese comprise 75 percent and control the government and
military.

   Sales of the Bible, the Koran, and books
containing the prophecies of a 16th-century astrologer have
increased dramatically since Iraq invaded Kuwait, publishers and
booksellers say.
   From shortly after the August invasion through mid-October, the
1,300-store Waldenbooks chain showed a 67 percent increase in sales
of prophetic books such as ``The Late Great Planet Earth,''
according to Susan Arnold, company spokeswoman in Stamford, Conn.
   Sales of the Bible and the Koran also increased sharply, she
said.
   At B. Dalton Bookseller in New York, books by Nostradamus, a
French astrologer and physicist who died in 1566, are selling well,
said assistant manager Terrel Holmes.
   Nostradamus has been credited with predicting the rise of
Napoleon and Hitler and the two World Wars. Most books interpreting
his writings say he spoke of a great war occurring in the Middle
East near the end of the 20th century.
   John Lawton, religious book buyer for the 800-store B. Dalton
chain, said religious book sales are up 35 to 40 percent nationwide
since the invasion.
   ``Bible sales have gone crazy,'' said Ken Sherman, sales
representative for Thomas Nelson Publishers, of Nashville, Tenn.,
which publishes Bibles worldwide. He said sales were up 25 percent.
   Several of the Bible's prophetic books refer to the rise and
fall of Babylon, the ruins of rich lie 60 miles south of
present-day Baghdad. Some evangelicals see a coming apocalypse in
Iraq's actions.
   Most mainstream biblical scholars give little credence to such
speculation, saying such analysis takes out of context passages
that were written for a specific culture and time.

   Music may soothe listeners, but it can be murder
on the players. Bruised lips, sore hands and ringing ears are
dangerous occupational hazards for musicians, and other performers
suffer too.
   Many doctors don't see it that way, says Dr. Alice G.
Brandfonbrener, director of the Medical Program for Performing
Artists.
   The sore neck of a violin player, injuries actors suffer during
stage fighting or a singer's lung pangs are hardly emergencies, but
they are typical of serious pains that can affect performers'
livelihoods, she said Friday.
   ``Musicians' problems are not obvious, most of them, and have
been kind of dismissed by physicians in the past as being part of
the neurosis of the musician and, therefore, not real,'' said
Brandfonbrener, whose program is one of about 18 similar efforts
nationwide.
   It is the only such program with a full-time physician, she
said.
   Lola McIntyre, 35, a pianist and teacher from the Indianapolis
area, said her hands were practically crippled by swelling and pain
when she arrived at Brandfonbrener's office three months ago.
   McIntyre said she had visited three other doctors who prescribed
medicine that did not work. One one doctor even told her she might
never perform or teach again, but hand-strenghthening exercises and
a modified practice schedule suggested by Brandfonbrener brought
dramatic improvement, she said.
   Mainstream doctors commonly tell ailing performers: ```Go home
and rest, and don't play,' and that just is not going to happen,''
Brandfonbrener said, since few can afford to miss work.
   The 5-year-old program handles about 600 patient visits a year
and about half are one-time visits, she said. Two-thirds of the
patients are musicians and the rest are dancers and theater people.
Fees are low since about 25 percent of those treated do not have
insurance.
   McIntyre said her injury wasn't unusual. Several of her students
left school with serious performance-related problems, she said.
   Brandfonbrener, a 59-year-old internist who also plays piano, is
studying the physical problems of orchestral musicians under a
$20,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.
   She also serves as senior editor of the Philadelphia-based
journal ``Medical Problems of Performing Artists'' and co-editor a
new medical textbook by the same name.
   ``There's an awful lot we don't understand, but at least we're
beginning to look at it,'' she said. ``Physicians, teachers and
performers are beginning to be willing to look and not being so
threatened by talking about it.''

<HEAD>Soviet Republics Sign Two More Bilateral Agreements</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four of the most independent-minded Soviet
republics have signed bilateral treaties, bringing to nearly a
dozen the number of such agreements intended to circumvent Kremlin
rule.
   Officials from the Ukraine and Lithuania, meeting in Kiev on
Friday, signed a four-year agreement on economic and cultural
cooperation, the official Tass news agency said.
   The republics agreed to maintain current supplies to each other
and establish direct links between their industries and agencies.
   Also Friday, in the once oil-rich city of Baku, officials from
Azerbaijan and Georgia signed an agreement on economic, scientific,
technical and cultural cooperation, Tass said.
   They agreed not to provide fuel or other resources to a third
party without each other's consent, and promised to foster
relations aimed at creating a market economy.
   Lithuania has set the pace for secessionist drives, declaring
independence in March last year. The Ukraine and Azerbaijan also
have declared their laws sovereign over Kremlin rule, and Georgia's
newly elected president said last month he intended to lead the
republic to independence.
   All but one of the country's 15 republics - Kirghizia - have
declared some form of sovereignty.
   Last month, the huge Russian republic signed bilateral treaties
with the Ukraine and with Kazakhstan. At the time, Russian republic
President Boris Yeltsin said six other bilateral treaties had been
signed by various republics, and suggested the pacts might become
the basis for a new Union Treaty.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has proposed a new Union Treaty
to replace a 1922 document that created the union but six republics
already have said they will not sign the treaty.
   Yeltsin, who has not stated a definitive positionpublicly on
the proposal, said he would agree to sign only if the Kremlin
grants greater powers to the republics and endorses their full
sovereignty.

   Science studies have reached dizzying
new heights, thanks to Columbia's astronauts, who launched the
dream of teacher-in-space Christa McAuliffe by delivering the first
classroom lecture from outer space.
   The astronauts conducted the 35-minute televised lecture from
218 miles above Earth on Friday, explaining to 41 middle school
students their 10-day mission to study celestial bodies. They also
discussed the mission's problems, including computer failures, that
have limited their star-gazing time.
   It was similar to what McAuliffe, the New Hampshire
schoolteacher killed in the Jan. 28, 1986 explosion of the space
shuttle Challenger, had planned to do.
   ``We weren't trying to take the place of what they were going to
do on Challenger,'' said Karen Widenhofer, a Madison County, Ala.,
teacher on temporary assignment with NASA who assisted in the
classroom Friday at Marshall Space Flight Center. ``But this shows
that NASA is still interested in education and encouraging students
in science and math.''
   Students also gathered at a classroom at the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
   Denny Elkins, a ninth-grader from Snellville, Ga., said the
lesson helped revive his interest in the space program. He said he
was watching Challenger's launch when the shuttle exploded, killing
all seven crew members.
   ``The explosion was the biggest impression of my life,'' he
said. ``I really wanted to be an astronaut, but when I saw that, I
said, `No.'
   ``Now, I'm reconsidering.''
   The lesson was conducted by Sam Durrance and Jeffrey Hoffman.
Ron Parise and Robert Parker joined in to help answer students'
questions.
   It may have featured another space first: Hoffman appeared
before the TV cameras in a dress shirt and tie.
   ``As far as I know, nobody's ever worn a tie in space,'' he
said, as the tie floated freely in the zero-gravity environment.
   The astronauts also discussed the mission's problems, including
computer failures and difficulties with an instrument pointing
system that have limited the use of the observatory.
   ``You may have heard of some of the problems we've been
having,'' Hoffman said. ``It's been quite an interesting and
dynamic mission.''
   ``Unfortunately some failures with computer terminals have
caused us to redo the way we're doing our mission,'' Parise said.
``We're slowly working around everything.''

<HEAD>NATO Defense Ministers Reaffirm Support For Crotone Air Base</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO defense ministers have reaffirmed
their plan to build a new air base in southern Italy that the U.S.
Congress has refused to help pay for now that the Cold War is over.
   ``All the defense ministers strongly supported such a base and
reaffirmed their commitment to the necessary funds,'' NATO
Secretary General Manfred Woerner said after a two-day ministerial
session ended Friday.
   The U.S. administration and NATO officials have argued that the
base, which will cost $800 million to $900 million, including
building and relocation costs, is needed to give the alliance a
strong base in the Mediterranean.
   The U.S. Air Force's 401st Tactical Fighter Wing, comprising 72
jetfighters, is based at Torrejon Air Base near Madrid and is
scheduled to move out by the end of 1992.
   U.S. officials say the air base near Crotone, Italy, could be
key for U.S. response to crises in the Middle East or North Africa.
   The United States is supposed to pay 28 percent of the costs,
but some congressional leaders want the Europeans to foot more of
the bill, and they have argued the base is no longer necessary
because of the end of the Cold War.
   Earlier this year, Congress directed the administration to ask
NATO whether they still supported the Crotone plan, first approved
in 1988.
   ``They basically reaffirmed the original decision,'' Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters Friday. ``I'll take that back
to the Congress.''
   He said Crotone is an ``important ... alliance project, not just
a U.S. project.''
   Cheney said U.S. military commanders in Europe believe that the
Crotone base would be among the two or three most important NATO
air bases in Europe.
   Woerner said he hoped the ``very strong consensus'' among the
defense ministers in favor of relocating the base ``will play a
role in future decisions of the American Congress.''

<TEXT>
   A Tahitian court has declared Marlon
Brando's daughter mentally incompetent, stalling her brother's
murder case.
   Cheyenne Brando, 20, is wanted by prosecutors as a material
witness in the trial of her half brother, Christian Brando. He is
charged with fatally shooting Miss Brando's Tahitian lover, Dag
Drollet, at the Brando mansion in the Hollywood Hills on May 16.
   Miss Brando's attorney, Michael Nasatir, described her Friday as
a ``very disturbed and very sick young woman'' and objected to
continued pressure from prosecutors to bring her back to the United
States.
   Nasatir told the judge that lawyers in Tahiti informed him that
Cheyenne Brando was declared incompetent and placed under the
guardianship of her mother, Tarita Tarapia Brando, after a hearing
Thursday.
   Deputy District Attorney Steven Barshop said he had been
notified of the conservatorship action but said he had too few
details to judge Miss Brando's condition.
   ``We're dealing with thousands of miles away, with language
problems and a different law,'' he said. ``We've taken the position
all along that a trial will go forward with or without Cheyenne.
However, she is a very material witness.''
   Shortly after the shooting, Miss Brando returned to Tahiti,
where she had Drollet's child, was confined to a mental hospital
and at one point was treated for a drug overdose, according to the
Brando family.
   There was also a report from a family spokesman in November that
she tried to hang herself and was hospitalized.
   She has refused to return to California to testify and Tahitian
authorities also have barred her exit, charging her as an
accomplice in Drollet's slaying.
   Also on Friday, Christian Brando, 32, charged with first-degree
murder in the shooting of the 26-year-old Drollet, missed a court
hearing because of a misunderstanding, his lawyer said.
   Superior Court Judge Robert Thomas ordered him to court on
Tuesday for setting of a trial date. He said he anticipates
starting the trial Jan. 14, more than two months after it was
originally scheduled to begin.

<HEAD>FDA To Probe Findings That People Are Dying In Protective
Restraints</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will
investigate a newspaper's findings that hundreds of people are
strangling or suffocating in protective restraints in nursing homes
and hospitals.
   The reports, which claim the FDA failed to respond to 23
reported deaths, were contained in a four-day series of articles
published in the Star Tribune beginning last Sunday.
   FDA officials said Friday they would try to determine whether
the Posey Co. of Arcadia, Calif., leading manufacturer of the
devices, failed to report deaths and serious injuries to the
agency, as required by law.
   The agency would also evaluate a study, performed for the
newspaper, that concluded at least 200 people die every year in the
restraining belts, vests and jackets.
   Restraints have been used for decades to keep hospital and
nursing-home patients from falling from beds and wheelchairs or
wandering unattended.
   If the FDA finds the hazards of restraints have been seriously
underestimated, it would take action ranging from educational
programs to recalls or seizures of the products, said agency
spokeswoman Susan Cruzan.
   In California, a spokesman for the Posey Co. said the firm will
cooperate with the agency.
   The Star Tribune reported the results of an eight-month
investigation into the use of restraints.
   The newspaper found the Posey Co. has never reported a
restraint-related death to the FDA, even though the firm knew that
people were strangling in the devices. Further, it determined the
FDA did nothing about 23 deaths that were reported by other
sources. The paper quoted agency officials as saying the number was
not large enough to warrant further action.
   Representatives of the state's nursing home industry hailed the
FDA's announcement.
   ``If you look at the products senior citizens use and the
handicapped use, it seems like they get less scrutiny than those
that able-bodied people use,'' said Rick Carter of Care Providers
of Minnesota, an industry trade group.

<TEXT>
   Cargo planes on a mercy mission for the Soviet
Union soared from a freezing airfield, beginning a new Berlin
airlft that carried tons of food and a weight of historical irony.
   The food flown Friday was among supplies stockpiled since the
winter of 1948-49, during the first frost of the Cold War, when
Western allies flew the tons of supplies to beleaguered West Berlin
to overcome a Soviet blockade of the city.
   The Berlin reserves - designed to feed and care for West
Berliners in case of another blockade - are being given to the
Soviets free of charge to help them through the winter.
   Soviet soldiers and German workers began loading 100 tons of
powdered milk from a warehouse onto Red Army trucks before sunrise
Friday.
   Escorted by German police and soldiers, a convoy of 16 trucks
drove to a Soviet military airfield about 20 miles south of Berlin
and loaded the milk powder onto cargo planes bound for the Soviet
Union.
   The Berlin food reserves alone total 214,500 tons, including
wheat, sugar, canned meat and canned fruit, said Andreas
Schuldenzucker of the government press office.
   With East-West tensions virtually at an end, Germany has started
sending the Soviet Union enormous amounts of food and other aid.
   Germans feel a gratitude for Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev because he did not obstruct the unification of Germany,
which became official Oct. 3. Some Germans have even taken to the
streets with tin cans, seeking contributions from passersby in
Potsdam.
   A telethon on Germany's ZDF television has raised $21 million to
date, while companies are rushing to take part in the relief
program.
   Spokesman Hans Klein on Friday said 250,000 tons of food and
supplies will be shipped by air, rail and sea over the next four
months.
   Kremlin officials have asked the Germans to give priority
treatment to shipping badly needed powdered milk.
   The Germans expect the humanitarian mission to continue at full
pace despite questions about the extent of hunger in the Soviet
Union. Officials say bare market shelves there are caused by
distribution problems and panic buying, not an actual lack of food.
   A civic group also has urged eastern Germans to invite Soviet
soldiers home for Christmas.
   An estimated 360,000 Soviet troops are still stationed in former
East Germany. They are to be pulled out by 1994.

<DATELINE>PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korean musicians crossed into
South Korea today for the first time since partition in 1945 for a
series of concerts they hope will be a prelude to reunification.
   ``I feel passionately that Koreans in the North and the South
cannot live separated by the tragedy of national division,'' said
Song Dong Chun, leader of the 33-member North Korean delegation.
   Song vowed to make the Seoul concerts ``a festival for
unification,'' but he also criticized South Korean for jailing
dissidents who had made unauthorized contacts with North Koreans.
   The North Koreans were greeted by Hwang Pyung-ki, chief
organizer of the Seoul concerts, who called the border crossing ``a
prelude to the crumbling wall of division.''
   The musicians will play a series of concerts during their
four-day stay in Seoul. The music will be traditional, with no
political overtones, as agreed on in an earlier border meeting.
   South Korean musicians visited North Korea in October, and the
two countries have played friendly soccer matches.
   Song said he had been uncertain about visiting Seoul after South
Korea earlier this month arrested three dissidents involved in
forming a civilian unification movement.
   South Korea has rejected a North Korean request for the release
of the dissidents, calling it an internal matter.
   North Korean Prime Minister Yon Hyong Muk was to hold a third
round of talks with South Korean President Roh Tae-woo in Seoul on
Tuesday.
   North Korea wants a non-aggression arrangement to be adopted at
the Seoul meeting, while South Korea insists an agreement
facilitating exchanges and cooperation must be signed first.
   South Korea has sought civilian exchanges in an effort to open
the North's closed society.
   The two nations have been bitter rivals since the division of
their peninsula in 1945. The border has been shut since the Korean
war ended in 1953, and there is no mail or other direct
communication between them.

<TEXT>
   More than 50,000 workers at General Motors Corp.
will have at least an extra week tacked on to their holiday
vacations because of slow sales.
   GM officials said Friday that 18 of its 35 North American car
and truck assembly plants in 14 states will be closed for the week
of Dec. 17, in addition to the traditional holiday shutdown.
   The end-of-year break had been scheduled to run from the end of
the last shift on Friday, Dec. 21, until the first shift on
Wednesday, Jan. 2.
   GM officials last week predicted the first quarterly red ink on
operations at the world's largest manufacturer since the 1981
recession. Chairman Robert Stempel said the company would cut
fourth-quarter car and truck production by 111,000, to a total of
1.07 million vehicles for the period.
   Next week, Ford Motor Co. is cutting back from two shifts to one
shift at its car and truck assembly plants in Lorian, Ohio,
affecting 2,000 people. Chrysler Corp., meanwhile will close its
Toledo, Ohio, Jeep plant next week, idling 4,700 workers.
   But it won't be a black Christmas for those employees. United
Auto Workers union contracts with each of the Big Three include
programs aimed at providing the workers with up to 95 percent of
their regular pay during a temporary shutdown.
   Ford and Chrysler haven't announced production plans for the
week of Dec. 17, a week in which GM plans to lay off 50,470
workers. Each of the automakers said the shutdowns are due to slow
dealer orders.
   The number of auto workers on layoff actually will be larger
than the total from assembly plants. Whenever an assembly plant is
shut down, layoffs usually occur at supplier and component plants.
Tracking those numbers is extremely difficult.
   With more than a dozen assembly plants closing down in the next
two weeks, it's likely that thousands more employees at the
component factories will be laid off, at least temporarily.

<HEAD>Fijian Prime Minister Confirms He Will Stand Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUVA, Fiji (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fiji's veteran prime minister described
himself as an unpopular leader in an interview published today and
said he would step down before elections scheduled for next year.
   ``We want somebody who will unite Indians and Fijians
together,'' Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara said in the Fiji Times
newspaper. ``I've proved I'm not. I think it would be to the
benefit of the country if I get out.''
   Fijian politics are split between ethnic Indians and native
Fijians, each of whom makes up roughly half of this South Pacific
nation's population of 720,000.
   Ratu Mara was the elected prime minister of Fiji from 1970 until
1987. He was defeated that year by an ethnic-Indian dominated
coalition, but the army staged two coups to keep the coalition from
effectively taking power.
   Brig.-Gen. Sitiveni Rabuka, the coup leader, installed Ratu Mara
as interim prime minister in December 1987.
   ``I've reached the age the Bible says we ought to reach and I
don't know how much longer I should live,'' said Ratu Mara, 70.
   He defended his government's policies of helping indigenous
Fijians gain more power in business, now dominated by foreigners
and ethnic Indians.
   Peace and stability will be difficult to maintain without a
fairer share of economic wealth for Fijians, he said.
   Under a new constitution promulgated in July, indigenous Fijians
have been guaranteed a majority in a proposed new parliament.
   The Indian-led coalition says the constitution is racist and has
promised to boycott next year's elections.

<HEAD>Officials Investigating Daily News Charges of Organized Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At the request of the Daily News, federal and
city officials are investigating allegations of bombings and arson
in the six-week-old strike at the newspaper.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney said an inquiry by city police
and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms began
several weeks ago at the request of the tabloid's lawyers.
   ``There have been a number of fires and uses of explosive
devices in the strike,'' Maloney said.
   Meanwhile Friday, both sides said they would accept an
invitation to meet with the top federal labor mediator in
Washington as soon as possible.
   News publisher James Hoge claims a conspiracy of violence has
been waged against replacement workers and News distributors. The
unions deny any such conspiracy, and no law enforcement officials
have confirmed Hoge's allegations.
   The unions also claim News employees have attacked strikers.
Police are investigating those complaints.
   Meanwhile, a federal judge said Friday that the paper could be
sold by hawkers at subway and train stations for at least another
10 days.
   U.S. District Judge Miriam G. Cedarbaum of Manhattan extended
her week-old order to Dec. 17. New York Newsday and the New York
Post both quickly applied to gain the same access and were awaiting
an answer.
   Cedarbaum said the Daily News convinced her the paper's First
Amendment rights would be violated if the hawkers were kept out of
the trains.
   Most newsstands around the city and in train stations have
stopped carrying the paper since the strike began Oct. 25.
   The newspaper filed suit to maintain access for the hawkers
after the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the
city's subway system and suburban commuter rail lines, barred them.
   The News has published every day during the strike but
distribution has been a major problem, with circulation cut in half
from the pre-strike 1.09 million copies daily. Newsday and the Post
have made major circulation gains during the strike.

   An explosion aboard a bus in the southwestern
city of Chengdu has killed at least two people and injured many
others, authorities said.
   Unconfirmed reports said more than 30 people died in Friday's
explosion, apparently caused by a bomb, which ripped the roof off
the bus and shattered its windows. There was no word on who might
be responsible.
   An official at the Sichuan province Foreign Affairs Office who
gave only his surname, Yu, quoted a report on Sichuan television
that two people were killed and many others injured.
   The explosion occurred as the bus passed a 50-foot statue of the
late revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung. The statue, which was
undamaged in the explosion, was the focal point of violent protests
that followed the June 3-4, 1989 military crackdown on
pro-democracy protestors in Beijing.
   Police killed up to 30 demonstrators in Chengdu, a city of
nearly 3 million people about 1,000 miles southwest of Beijing.

   Local and federal agents seized money, guns and
even buildings as they busted a murderous Jamaican drug posse with
roots in New York and Texas.
   The raids, which resulted in 18 arrests, began Thursday night
and ended early Friday. Authorities said they seized more than
$150,000 in cash, six buildings owned by the posse and 15 guns,
including submachine guns.
   FBI spokesman James Fox estimated gang members took in more than
$100 million over the past five years and carried out at least 10
murders ordered by its leader, Eric Vassell. He escaped arrest.
   The gang, known as the Gulleymen Posse, distributed heroin
wholesale in Brooklyn during the past decade and branched into
crack in the late 1980s, when it expanded to Dallas, officials
said.
   Gang members spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on car
rentals to run crack from Brooklyn to Dallas and return with guns
every week, the government said.
   The biggest raid was at a Brooklyn apartment building known to
dealers and addicts as ``the `24-7 house,' because it was open 24
hours a day, seven days a week, including Christmas, Thanksgiving
and New Year's,'' Fox said.
   When the gang wanted to discipline members, ``they would simply
kill their people and many of the killings occurred right in the
hallway,'' Fox said.
   Fox said ``as the trucks and SWAT van drove up in front and the
agents and detectives piled out, neighbors in the windows and in
the street were seen applauding and cheering.''
   Fox said posse members offered virtually no resistance.
   Vassell was believed to be in the New York area. Andrew J.
Maloney, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, described Vassell as a
31-year-old Jamaican who has fathered 14 to 18 children by various
women and has ties to the ruling PNP Party in Jamaica.
   In the complaint filed by Maloney's office, an informant is
quoted as saying that guns shipped to Jamaica inside TV sets in
February were ``vote-getters'' to be used in a runoff election on
the island.
   ``Whenever there is a major event in Jamaica ... Vassell sends a
shipment of guns,'' it said.
   Maloney said he was not claiming that Jamaican Prime Minister
Michael Manley was aware of Vassell's actions.
   Eighteen of 42 alleged posse members were arrested. If convicted
they face life in prison on narcotics conspiracy and racketeering
charges that include murder, money laundering and obtaining
fraudulent passports and green cards, Maloney said. Four people
were arrested in raids in Dallas and two in Albany. The others were
arrested during raids in Brooklyn and Long Island.
   It was the second major joint FBI-police operation this week. On
Tuesday, agents toppled the Green Dragons, a Chinese-Vietnamese
street gang that allegedly shook down merchants in the New York
borough of Queens.

<HEAD>Log From Plane That Dropped First Atomic Bomb Fails to Sell</HEAD>

   A flight log from the plane that dropped the
atomic bomb on Hiroshima failed to sell at auction after the
mission's navigator said it was not the original.
   As bidding was about to open at $40,000 Friday, auctioneer
Stephen Massey said Christie's could not guarantee the log from the
B-29 bomber Enola Gay was not a copy.
   No bids were offered and the auctioneer did not go lower.
   Christie's had estimated the flight log would fetch $100,000 to
$150,000, but Theodore J. Van Kirk, the Enola Gay's navigator, told
the auction house last week that he still has the original.
   Meanwhile at Christie's Friday, a letter from Vermont patriot
Ethan Allen - which had been valued at $15,000 to $20,000 - sold
for $38,000.
   The Karpeles Manuscript Library in Santa Barbara, Calif., won a
bidding war with the University of Vermont for the letter, which
Allen wrote to the British governor of Quebec in 1787, when Vermont
was independent.
   Vermont joined the United States four years later. Allen led the
Green Mountain Boys in a raid on Fort Ticonderoga during the
American Revolution.
   The Christie's flight log is owned by Eileen Lewis, widow of
Capt. Robert A. Lewis, the flight's co-pilot. She had hoped to
retire on the money, said Christie's manuscript specialist Chris
Coover.
   The auction house did get $12,000 for a pair of binoculars from
the flight that were owned by Mrs. Lewis.
   Coover said Christie's didn't pull the log from the auction
block because it was confident it was the original, but he added he
doesn't doubt Van Kirk's sincerity.
   ``It is conceivable Van Kirk could have copied the log in
flight, someone else could have, or it was copied immediately after
the mission,'' Coover said. The log offered for sale records basic
flight information, such as position, altitude, air speed and
compass direction, on three yellow, oblong sheets. It's 9:15 a.m.
entry noting the bomb's release simply says, ``Bomb-away.''
   The dropping of the bomb on Aug. 6, 1945, killed 130,000 people
and introduced the era of atomic weapons.

   The government, facing calls for its
resignation and the threat of strikes, has put off plans to
eliminate subsidies for bread, meat, medicine and other goods.
   Protests and strikes followed the lifting of state price
controls on Nov. 1, which doubled and tripled prices on many foods
and consumer goods.
   The announcement Friday on state TV said the lifting of
subsidies for bread, meat, dairy products, sugar, oil, soaps,
medicine and medical services items, which had been scheduled for
Jan. 1, would be postponed until June.
   The decision reflected growing nervousness among officials that
the opposition was gaining strength and could pose a threat to
Premier Petre Roman's government.
   The National Drivers' Union issued a statement Friday
threatening a nationwide strike Monday unless the government
resigned in favor of a ``government of national unity.''
   They also demanded the dismissal of all former Communists who
are still leading local governments and industry.
   The nationwide Fratia union has said it might declare a general
strike next week.
   Silviu Brucan, who helped found the governing National Salvation
Front, said the government has erred in ``underestimating the
social effect of the price rises.''
   ``They should have been more candid with the people,'' he said
in an interview Friday, explaining that the lifting of state
controls ``was inevitable, but would have a very bad effect at
first.''
   The Civic Alliance, an opposition group, has called for
nationwide protests to mark this month's one-year anniversary of
the revolution that overthrew Nicolae Ceausescu's Communist
dictatorship.
   President Ion Iliescu criticized the alliance as a ``street
movement that tries to substitute the political opposition.''
   ``I call on all responsible elements and citizens to assure a
favorable climate for the anniversary of the revolution,'' Iliescu
said in a televised address late Friday. ``Make December a month of
... national conciliation.''
   The National Salvation Front won May elections by promising an
easy transition to a market economy. It has lost popularity as
prices soar.
   Brucan said the front would lose the next election, scheduled
for 1992, because of the toug  economic reforms it must enact to
transform the heavily centralized economy.
   But Brucan, who no longer holds an official position, called on
the opposition to abandon its efforts to bring down the government,
saying this was ``not the moment'' for a change of leadership.
   ``Whoever's in power now will have to take necessarily unpopular
measures, so taking the government would be political suicide,'' he
said.

   Thousands of stockholders are entitled to
part of a $29 million settlement with a biotechnology company
charged with making false claims about medical products in order to
inflate stock prices, a company spokesman said.
   Those eligible include anyone who bought stock in Genentech Inc.
between March 17, 1987, and Sept. 28, 1988, said Jack Murphy,
director of public relations for the genetic engineering company.
   Under the agreement signed Friday, Genentech admits no
wrongdoing but will pay shareholders who bought stock based on
claims of record early sales of the company's heart attack
medicine, Activase, he said.
   ``We decided it was in the company's best interest to settle
because of the large legal expenses,'' he said. ``We put up a
vigorous defense for two years...''
   The settlement was signed Friday and will be filed Monday in
U.S. District Court, Murphy said. Attorney's for the plaintiffs
could not be reached for comment at their New York City offices.
   Murphy said he did not know exactly how many stockholders were
eligible. He said they would be notified by the court, he said.
   The settlement brings to a close several class-action suits,
which were consolidated, claiming violations of securities laws for
artificially inflating the value of stock.
   Genentech sold for at least $50 a share during most of the time
covered by the settlement, but stocks dipped below $17 after
disclosures the company's financial outlook had been exaggerated,
according to one suit.
   It closed at $27 a share Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
   The ashes of a local surfing legend
who suffered a fatal heart attack while riding his board at the age
of 72 will be scattered on the ocean he loved, his widow said
Friday.
   ``I know the surfers will be disappointed because there will be
no special services,'' Virginia Widenmann said Friday. ``He'll be
cremated and the remains taken to Spanish Beach.''
   John Widenmann died off Spanish Beach on Wednesday, 51 years
after he caught his first wave.
   ``A classic place for the dude to go,'' said fellow surfer Todd
Roberts, 28.
   Widenmann, a retired electrical engineer who lived in Pebble
Beach, suffered a heart attack and slipped off his surfboard into
rough water, according to the Monterey County coroner's report.
   Fellow surfers pulled him from the water and unsuccessfully
tried to revive him. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital,
county officials said.
   Widenmann was surfing at an age when most people ``couldn't even
get a wetsuit on, much less paddle out into the surf,'' said surfer
Dave Hemp, 20.
   His wife said Widenmann took up the sport in Hawaii in 1939. He
retired from engineering in 1954 and since then had spent most of
his time at the beach.
   ``That's what he did,'' she said. ``He surfed. He'd just go out
there and wait for the waves. If he had a profession, I guess that
was it.''
   Witnesses said Widenmann was standing on his fiberglass board
when he clutched his chest and fell into the water.
   ``He was definitely part of the landscape,'' Hemp said. ``It's
kind of a blessing that he got to go out there where he loved to
surf.''

   Hundreds of people kicked off several days of
planned protests against violence in the Persian Gulf with
demonstrations in Massachusetts, Wisconsin and Seattle.
   ``I am against all wars,'' Stephanie Atkinson, a former Army
Reservist, told about 200 protesters gathered at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Cambridge on Friday. ``I'm especially
against this one. It's imperialistic. There really is no good
reason for them to be there.''
   Protesters planned to return to Cambridge today to unfurl a
large replica of the U.S. Constitution to block the entrance to the
Armed Forces Recruiting Center.
   In Atlanta, civil rights leader Joseph E. Lowery and the widow
of Martin Luther King Jr. said they would lead a group of civil
rights activists to New York on Monday to speak out against the
threat of war in Iraq.
   Lowery and Coretta Scott King said members of the National
Coalition of Conscience would meet at the United Nations Plaza that
day, Human Rights Day.
   The U.N. has approved a resolution authorizing the use of force
if Iraqi troops do not leave Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   In Madison, Wis., on Friday, about 350 people marched from the
state Capitol to a federal building two blocks away to protest the
buildup of U.S. troops in the Middle East since Iraq invaded Kuwait
on Aug. 2.
   ``The president has unleashed a war machine and propaganda
campaign to silence the peace movement,'' said state Rep. David
Clarenbach. ``The parallels with the war in Vietnam are all too
painful and obvious.''
   In Seattle, about three dozen people were arrested Friday when
they blocked a main street in front of the U.S. Naval Reserve
building. They would be cited for interfering with traffic, police
spokesman Mark Amundson said.
   Organizers said the number of protests represent rising
opposition to war in the Middle East from people inside and outside
the military, as well as among the children of Vietnam War veterans
and protesters.
   ``This is the first time in modern history that one generation
(of protesters) has emerged out of another,'' said San
Francisco-based activist Scott Mackler. ``The young people being
drafted to the Middle East are the product of parents who fought in
the Vietnam War.''
   ``There's a growing movement inside the armed forces,'' said
Scott Cooper, one of the coordinators of the Committee Against a
Vietnam War in the Middle East, which organized the MIT protest.
   Atkinson, 23, a former Army Reservist 4th class, said she was
discharged under ``other than honorable conditions'' because she
sought conscientious objector status. She said her old unit is now
20 miles from Kuwait's border.
   ``I want them to know I'm very concerned about them,'' she said.
``I want them to come home.''

<HEAD>Jury Orders Magazine to Pay Sons of Slain Businessman $12.4
Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The publisher of Soldier of Fortune
magazine says he will appeal a $12.4 million award to two men who
said their father was slain as a result of a ``gun for hire'' ad
the magazine carried.
   A federal court jury made the award Friday to Michael Braun, 21,
and Ian Braun, 26. The two Montgomery men maintained that Bruce
Gastwirth, a business associate of their father, Richard, used the
ad to have the elder Braun killed. ``Quite often in First Amendment
cases, you will see the juries rule against the defendant and it
will be overturned on appeal,'' said publisher Robert Brown, who
founded the Boulder, Colo.-based magazine.
   ``I'm not surprised by the verdict. I think we'll see it
overturned on appeal.''
   The classified ad was placed inthe June 1985 issue of Soldier
of Fortune by Richard Savage of Knoxville, Tenn. It read: ``GUN FOR
HIRE: 37-year-old professional mercenary desires jobs. Vietnam
veteran. Discrete and very private. Body guard, courier and other
special skills. All jobs considered.''
   The magazine stopped running such ads in 1986.
   Richard Braun was shot to death and Michael Braun, then 16, was
wounded when a gunman fired on the elder Braun's Mercedes
automobile on Aug. 27, 1985.
   Gastwirth, Savage and two associates were convicted of Braun's
killing.
   The jury awarded $10.4 million to Michael Braun and $2 million
to the brothers jointly.
   The lawsuit was the second such case against the magazine to go
to trial. In the previous trial seeking damages in a woman's
slaying in 1985, a jury in Houston returned a $9.4 million verdict.
That award was reversed on appeal last year and the U.S. Supreme
Court let the reversal stand.

   Fans of Beatles founder John Lennon remembered
him today on the 10th anniversary of his murder with quiet tributes
honoring the legendary rock 'n' roll star.
   Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono and the couple's 15-year-old son, Sean,
will mark the anniversary quietly, said family spokesman Elliott
Mintz.
   ``Yoko's in Europe with Sean,'' Mintz said. ``They'll spend the
day privately.''
   A small crowd of invited guests gathered Friday in Liverpool,
England, at the Beatles Museum as Mayor Dorothy Gavin unveiled the
plaque honoring the singer-songwriter and guitarist for the band
widely hailed as the greatest rock group of all time.
   Lennon and his wife were returning to their apartment in New
York's Dakota building from a recording session on Dec. 8, 1980,
when he was shot to death by Mark David Chapman, an obsessed fan
who had gotten his autograph only hours before.
   In Los Angeles, fans were invited to gather throughout the day
at Lennon's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and leave flowers
and other tributes.
   Similar tributes were expected in the Strawberry Fields section
of Central Park near the Dakota building and at the Cavern Walk in
Liverpool, where a statue honoring the Beatles is in place.
   ``We invite Beatles fans and people from all over the world to
come along to the Cavern Walk shrine monument to lay flowers and
other tributes in memory of John,'' said John James-Chambers,
founder of the Liverpool Beatles Appreciation Society of the U.K.
   Lennon's death, just months after he had emerged from years of
seclusion to record a new album, ``Double Fantasy,'' left millions
of fans grief-stricken.
   Tens of thousands of people gathered in New York's Central Park
for a ceremony that culminated in 10 minutes of silence, while
thousands attended similar gatherings in cities throughout the
United States.
   Tributes to Lennon have continued over the years. Last Oct. 9,
on what would have been his 50th birthday, radio stations in 130
countries broadcast his song ``Imagine'' to an estimated 1 billion
listeners.
   Chapman, who is serving 20 years to life at Attica State Prison
in New York, recently apologized for the killing.
   ``It was an end of innocence for that time and I regret being
the one who ended it,'' he said.

   Cautious investigators say there is
increasing evidence the shooting deaths of eight male motorists
over the past year is the work of two female serial killers bent on
robbery.
   ``We can't for 100 percent sure say that these cases are
related,'' said police Capt. Steve Binegar, chief of Marion County
detectives.
   ``We haven't put together the linkage until fairly recently.
There are some commonalities in all the cases, and of course there
are a lot of things that are not similar.''
   But police this week released the drawings of two women being
sought for questioning. The women, involved in a traffic accident
in Marion County in July, also have been tentatively linked to a
missing missionary and the most recent killing in Dixie County on
Nov. 19, police said.
   Their names have not been released, however, and investigators
are reluctant to say much about them.
   The victims were probably driving alone, police said. Their
bodies were found in rural areas in northern Florida and southern
Georgia.
   Binegar said bodies of some of the victims were nude or
partially nude, but there was no evidence indicating a sexual
assault was connected to the killings.

   The Defense Department subpoenaed the Hughes
Aircraft Corp. for documents on four missilepprograms widely used
by the armed forces, according to a published report.
   The issuance of the subpoenas, served by the Defense Department
inspector general, was reported in today's editions of the Los
Angeles Times, which quoted a source close to the investigation.
   The reason for the request was not known. The Defense Department
has launched similar inquiries when it believes it has been
overcharged by contractors.
   ``We are not aware of any Hughes conduct that would justify the
issuance of such a sweeping request for documents,'' the newspaper
quoted an unidentified Hughes spokesman as saying. ``Our lawyers
are reviewing the subpoena to determine whether it has been
properly issued and what information Hughes must produce.''
   The subpoena demands documents on the Navy's air-to-air Phoenix
missile; the Air Force's air-to-ground Maverick and AMRAAM
missiles; and the Army's antitank TOW missile. All are built in
Tucson, Ariz., by the aerospace firm's missile division. The
programs date back as far as the 1960s.
   The Nov. 26 subpoena seeks records that, in some cases, date
back to the inception of the missile programs. The Phoenix and Tow
programs are decades old.
   The Defense Criminal Investigative Service also is involved in
the probe.

   Israeli troops and allied militiamen
fought a two-hour artillery battle with guerrillas today inside
Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon,
security sources said.
   It was not immediately known to which Lebanese or Palestinian
group the guerrillas belonged, or whether there were casualties.
   The incident was the latest in a surge of violence in the two-by
10-mile-wide zone that Israel carved out in 1985 to prevent
cross-border guerrilla attacks.
   The guerrillas fired four Katuysha rockets on a position manned
by the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia about two miles
north of Hasbaya, the security sources said.
   Hasbaya, 11 miles southwest of Rashaya, is in the western sector
of the area.
   Guerrillas at the same time shelled a Israeli-South Lebanon Army
hilltop base at Ein Qenya and the militia's headquarters with 60mm
mortar rounds, the sources said.
   ``That touched off a two-hour artillery duel between the
Israelis and the SLA on one side and resistance men on the other,''
said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said Israeli and allied militia gunners responded with 155mm
howitzers on Mimas and Ein Alal, near Hasbaya, and mopped Mimas
valley with heavy machine-gun fire.
   The SLA-run Voice of the South radio station acknowledged SLA
positions came under guerrilla fire but did not speak of any
casualties among its militiamen or Israeli soldiers.
   Five Israeli soldiers were killed and eight guerrillas were
wounded in a clash in the security zone last week.

   IRA attackers threw a bomb
studded with nails at a police station early today, injuring two
officers, authorities said.
   The Irish Republican Army later claimed responsibility in a
phone call to a local radio station, said a spokesman for the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force.
   He said the bomb, made of the explosive Semtex and studded with
nails, was thrown at the gates of the Mount Pottinger police
station in east Belfast.
   The blast did not damage the building but shattered windows in
neighboring houses, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   The two policemen suffered minor injuries, the spokesman said.
   Separately, police announced that two more checkpoints on the
border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will be
closed at night in the future in a bid to deter IRA ``human bomb''
attacks.
   There will be immediate restrictions on the flow of traffic
through checkpoints at Rosscor and Wattlebridge in County
Fermanagh, police said. That brings to six the number of border
crossings closed at night.
   On Oct. 24 the IRA forced two civilians to drive cars loaded
with explosives through checkpoints in Londonderry and Newry,
County Down. Six soldiers and one of the civilian drivers were
killed. A similar attack last month at the Annaghmartin checkpoint
in County Fermanagh failed when the bomb did not detonate.
   The Irish Republican Army is waging a bombing and shooting
campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite the
predominantly protestant province with the mainly Roman Catholic
Republic of Ireland.

   Arab oil ministers today decided to move the
headquarters of their organization from Iraqi-occupied Kuwait to
Egypt until Iraq relinquishes the oil-rich emirate.
   Today's meeting of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting
Countries was the first since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   There had been speculation that the ministers would consider
suspending Iraq from the 10-member organization as punishment for
the invasion. But no such decision was taken and it was not known
if the issue was discussed.
   A final statement said the organization will move in 1991 to
Cairo from Kuwait ``until matters go back to normal in Kuwait.''
   The ministers refused to give reporters details of the closed
meeting, held amid tight security in a luxury hotel on the banks of
the Nile.
   Minister Rashid Salem al-Ameeri of Kuwait earlier told the state
Middle East News Agency that Iraqi occuaation forces had
``pillaged'' the organization's headquarters.
   Seven members - Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Libya, Syria, the
United Arab Emirates and Bahrain - were represented at the meeting
by their oil ministers. Qatar and Algeria sent lesser ministry
officials, and Iraq sent its ambassador.
   Unlike the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, the Arab group does not concern itself with production
and pricing. The Arab group was founded in 1968 to sponsor joint
petroleum ventures and stimulate reciprocal investments in the oil
industry.

   While the United States and Europe
battled over provisions of a new world trade pact, developing
nations say their complaints were ignored.
   If the negotiations ultimately fail to produce a new agreement,
the poor countries say they will be the main victims.
   ``When the elephants fight, the grass gets trampled on,'' R.W.
Chirwa, head of the Malawi delegation, said Friday after the talks
broke down over how to lower trade barriers.
   The industrial power elite spent five days arguing over the
substantial spoils a new world trade order would yield, while the
poor nations largely waited in the wings.
   Neither the United States nor the European Community would
sufficiently compromise at the talks, held under the auspices of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The organization, known
as GATT, is charged with policing international trade rules.
   The talks in Brussels failed and the Third World nations were
left with dashed hopes.
   ``The entire negotiations were hijacked by a bilateral issue,''
complained Indian Commerce Minister Subramanian Swamy.
   The ambitious Uruguay Round talks will resume in Geneva next
year, but the confidence of many developing nations is now badly
shaken.
   ``We were looking for a new dialogue with the industrial
nations,'' said Colombia's economic development minister, Ernesto
Samper. But when the talks were suspended, he said, ``We got
nothing.''
   If the talks ultimately collapse in Geneva, the poor nations
will pay most heavily.
   A revamped world trading system would give developing nations
more access to sell their goods in world markets. It would also
allow them to gain the benefits from a global economic expansion
driven by the reforms.
   If the economies of the rich nations were to grow by an average
annual rate of 1 percent, the exports of the world's net debtor
countries would grow by 1.75 percent each year, said Michel
Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund.
   ``We tried to improve the economic situation in the world, but
we failed,'' said German Minister Helmut Haussmann. ``That is bad
for all, but especially for the Third World.''
   Yet many of the representatives of those nations felt shut out
of the negotiating action.
   Foreign Minister Anisul Islam Mahmud of Bangladesh complained he
felt ``like a little schoolboy waiting outside'' the classroom.
   ``The Brussels meeting was marked by a lack of transparency and
selective participation,'' Madagascar's Commerce Minister Georges
Solofoson said at the close on behalf of the African nations.
   Cutting tariff and non-tariff barriers would boost gross
domestic product, the total annual goods and services, by nearly 3
percent in developing nations, ``approximately twice the amount of
official development aid extended by the industrial countries,''
Camdessus said.
   Eliminating farm subsidies in the rich countries, the major
cause of the talks' failure, could have increased such exports from
the Third World by $50 billion, he said.
   But European Community nations refused to accept the deep
subsidy cuts demanded by the United States, Canada and other
exporting nations.
   Such subsidies keep food from the industrial nations
artificially cheap and prevent developing nations from expanding
their own agricultural sector.
   ``We'd rather produce our own chickens than import frozen
chickens,'' said Roman Catholic Archbishop Isidore De Sousa of
Benin.
   Protectionist limits on textile imports from low-wage countries
like Bangladesh and India into the industrialized nations also cost
the developing nations billions of dollars in trade.

   Police raided a villa on the outskirts of
Naples and arrested one of the reputed top bosses of the Camorra
organized crime syndicate.
   Lorenzo Nuvoletta, who had been a fugitive for 10 years, was
arrested Friday along with seven associates, police said today. The
suspects surrendered without a struggle after more than 100
policemen, backed by helicopters, surrounded the villa, they said.
   Investigators said Nuvoletta is head of one of the most powerful
clans of the Camorra, the Neapolitan version of the Sicilian Mafia.
The Camorra gangs are involved in extortion, drug trafficking,
money laundering and other illegal activities.
   Italian newspapers said Nuvoletta was believed to be one of
three Camorra bosses on the ``cupola,'' or hierarchy, of the
Sicilian Mafia.
   Rome's La Repubblica newspaper said Nuvoletta had built a
criminal empire worth more than $320 million.

   Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan
resigned today in an apparent maneuver to let him make sweeping
changes in his Cabinet.
   The head of a party that is a coalition partner predicted
Chatichai would quickly return to his post.
   He would then be free to revamp his Cabinet, since all the
ministers automatically lost their positions with his resignation.
   The country's powerful military has harshly criticized several
members of the Cabinet. Chatichai's government has come under
criticism for corruption, ineptitude and internal squabbling.
   The resignation was announced by the prime minister's office.
   Bangkok newspapers, which had predicted the move, said Chatichai
had received assurances beforehand from the major parties of his
seven-party coalition of support to become prime minister again.
   Kukrit Pramoj, who heads the Social Action Party, said in a
television interview that Chatichai would probably regain his post
because there were many parties backing him, including his own.
   Chatichai and the Cabinet remain in place in a caretaker status
until the president of the Parliament declares a new prime
minister.
   Prior to the announcement, Chatichai met with King Bhumibol
Adulyadej, the state media said. The constitutional monarch is
consulted by the country's leaders before major changes are made.
   Chatichai, a 68-year-old former army general and diplomat, came
to power in August 1988.

   Manuel Noriega's taped prison conversations were
apparently leaked to CNN by a person assisting the Drug Enforcement
Administration, a federal source said.
   The Miami Herald today identified the source of the leak as Jose
Blandon, a longtime political opponent of Noriega's and a potential
witness against him.
   The FBI is trying to determine who gave the tapes to the
network, which aired some of them over the last month.
   According to court documents filed Friday, prosecutors
subpoenaed 162 Noriega phone recordings made between December and
August at the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside of Miami.
The deposed Panamanian dictator is jailed there on drug charges.
   But investigators found little of interest and reviewed only 52
of the tapes.
   In late June, 22 tapes were ``reviewed under the direction and
supervision of the DEA case agents, by a person assisting DEA'' in
its criminal investigation against Noriega, the government said in
a filing signed by assistant U.S. attorneys Norman Moscowitz and
Sonia O'Donnell.
   A federal law enforcement source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press that the tapes leaked to CNN
were among those 22, and the individual helping the DEA to review
the tapes was believed responsible.
   The official would not identify the suspect, but said the person
could face criminal charges.
   Quoting unidentified sources, the Herald reported that person
who assisted the DEA was Blandon, a one-time senior intelligence
officer in Panama and Panama's consul general in New York. He
testified before a Senate committee in 1988 that his former boss
Noriega protected U.S.-bound cocaine shipments.
   DEA Washington spokeswoman Illa Brown said the agency could not
discuss pending prosecutions, and referred all questions to the
U.S. attorney's office in Miami. U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said
he could not comment on a pending investigation.
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth declined comment. He said the
network does not generally comment on reports from confidential
sources.
   The court documents filed Friday were the prosecution's response
to Noriega's motion to dismiss the case against him on grounds of
government misconduct.
   Attorneys for the deposed Panamanian dictator claimed the
government illegally taped his prison phone calls, undercut his
defense by freezing all his assets and tried to involve lead
defense attorney Frank Rubino in a bribery scheme.
   Lehtinen said Friday the government's response showed there was
no substance to Noriega's charges of misconduct.
   ``The United States maintains that no privileged calls were ever
taped because Noriega was fully advised that all of his telephone
calls would be monitored unless he followed a specific procedure
for privileged calls to his lawyer,'' Lehtinen said. ``Noriega
never invoked that procedure, therefore all of his calls were
properly monitored.''
   Prosecutors said Noreiga, who has unlimited use of a phone
outside his cell, made 1,400 calls between Feb. 1 and Nov. 8.
Nearly all those calls were to his lawyers but some were relayed
overseas by his lawyers, a violation of Bureau of Prisons policy.
   Lehtinen said Noriega's attorneys knew the calls were monitored,
and even discussed that on some of the tapes.
   No hearing date has been set to consider the dismissal motion,
filed last month during the legal battle over CNN's tapes of
Noriega's prison conversations.
   Transcripts of those tapes were made public Thursday after a
request from four news organizations, but most of the conversations
obtained by CNN were in code or about Noriega's personal matters.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million in
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade passing through Panama from
Colombia to the United States.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy said today it was
evacuating Libyan prisoners of war from Chad as part of an
``international effort,'' but Libya called the move piracy and
asked for an emergency Security Council meeting.
   The embassy refused to comment on reports that the United States
had trained the POWs for commando operations against Libya.
   The Libyans were captured by Chad in fighting between 1983 and
1987 by soldiers of former President Hissene Habre, who was toppled
one week ago.
   Habre went into exile in Cameroon, and rebel leader Idriss Deby
was named interim president. Deby, whose movement received much of
its weaponry from Libya, is freeing the Libyan POWS.
   The evacuation effort apparently started on Friday, when a plane
carrying 200 Libyan POWs left for Nigeria, according to news
reports.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Mark Krischik said the evacuations were
``part of an international effort,'' but he declined to say whether
the government of Deby or French soldiers based there were
participating.
   ``I can confirm that we are continuing our humanitarian gesture
to provide transportation out of Chad for those unwilling to return
to Libya,'' he said.
   Agence France-Presse, the French news agency, reported that 500
more Libyan POWs were to be evacuated today to Nigeria, then to a
third country. It cited an unidentified American source for its
information.
   Krischik refused to comment on the freed POWs' destination.
   Barbara Shell, a spokeswoman at the U.S. Embassy in Chad,
refused to comment on an AFP report that the United States had
trained about 700 of the 2,000 POWs for commando operations against
Libya.
   The Libyan Foreign Ministry, in a communique, charged that the
United States on Friday seized 200 Libyan POWs in Chad and took
them away ``against their will'' aboard a C-141 Air Force plane. It
called the move ``international piracy'' equivalent to
``state-sponsored terrorism.''
   Libya's official JANA news agency charged that 17 Libyans were
executed for refusing the U.S. evacuation.
   JANA, citing diplomatic and media sources in Chad, alleged that
POWs refusing ``to obey America's orders are being massacred daily
at a rate of three prisoners every hour before the very eyes of
French troops and the U.S. military personnel present in Chad.''
   The Libya communique, carried by JANA and monitored in Rome,
accused the United States of a ``grave violation of international
conventions and laws.''
   ``The U.S. has launched an aggression against Great Al
Jamahiriya (Libya) representing a dangerous precedent unsurpassed
in history,'' the statement said.
   Libya ``demands an emergency session of the Security Council to
discuss the piracy act pursued by the U.S.,'' it said.
   The State Department in Washington would not comment on the
report of commando training and said it had heard nothing about
Libya's request for a U.N. meeting.
   JANA later reported Libya was sending its foreign minister,
Ibrahim Muhammed al-Bishari, to Nigeria in an effort to get the
Libyans back. It did not say when he would depart.
   The Libyan communique urged the International Red Cross and
human rights groups to condemn the action and ``make every endeavor
to release the prisoners taken as hostages, apart from saving the
lives of those facing the same fate.''
   After Habre's ouster, a delegation of Libyan officials flew to
Chad and arranged for the bulk of the Libyan POWs to return to
Libya. The delegation also reportedly sought to obtain custody of
Libyans who had turned against their nation's leader, Col. Moammar
Gadhafi.

<HEAD>New Subway Line Opens in Rome</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new subway line began operating in Rome on
Saturday, but city officials admitted it will do little to
alleviate the capital's chaotic traffic conditions.
   The new line, an extension of the B-line, is five miles long and
can carry 14,000 passengers per hour from Rome's main train
terminal to a station near Rebibbia prison on the east side of the
city.
   Mayor Franco Carraro, who made an inaugural trip on the subway
Friday, said that although the new line is a step in the right
direction, many more miles of subway tracks are needed to solve
Rome's traffic problems.
   The mayor also stressed the need for improved bus and taxi
service. He reported that Rome has one taxi for every 550 people
while Paris has one for every 150 people.
   The extension of the B-line took eight years and $1 billion to
build and cost the lives of two construction workers in the
process.
   A major impediment to construction of new subway lines in Rome
is the wealth of archaeological treasures lying beneath the city.

<HEAD>After Saving His Job, Rep. Annunzio Gets Kicked By His Own Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   WhileRep. Frank Annunzio and his supporters
were dining on Italian food in celebration of his re-election,
fellow Democrats were working to strip him of a job most never get:
a committee chairmanship.
   It was a great irony for a lawmaker who had just survived the
toughest campaign of his 26-year career, a race that had centered
almost entirely on his ties to the savings-and-loan industry.
   Not only did he defeat his opponent, a popular state senator,
but he also slayed the national Republican party, which had poured
thousands of dollars into Chicago in an unsuccessful bid to take
away Annunzio's seat.
   That triumph didn't matter.
   While a band played and the buffet was laid out that Tuesday
night, Democrats already had approached Rep. Charles Rose, D-N.C.,
about taking the reins of the House Administration Committee, a
panel that takes care of the nitty gritty of lawmakers' offices
essential to daily life in Congress.
   The complaints: Annunzio's staff was abrasive, he didn't take
enough interest in the committee's business, and some of the S&amp;L
charges that were aired during the campaign apparently were too
much for some new lawmakers to stomach.
   One day later, Democrats bounced him, 127-125 in a secret
ballot, and elected Rose.
   With Annunzio stripped of one job, he still has a second
powerful post, chairmanship of a powerful House Banking
subcommittee that oversees the maligned S&amp;L industry.
   For years, Annunzio has received substantial campaign
contributions from S&amp;Ls, a fact that generated much bad publicity
during his 1990 campaign for re-election. But ironcially, one
committee member says Annunzio's loss of one job should shield him
from further setbacks.
   ``That would be two blows,'' said Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., a
committee member.
   Along with Rep. Glenn Anderson, D-Calif., of the Public Works
and Transportation Committee, Annunzio was one of two veteran
chairmen ousted by the Democratic caucus.
   ``Congress does believe in the seniority system,'' Rose said.
``But if a senior member is not performing in a way members think
is useful, they will not hesitate to make a change. ... He
(Annunzio) wasn't a hands-on chairman.''
   ``That's a very bum rap,'' said Dean Coston, the committee's
acting staff director.
   ``It's really cruel what happened to him,'' said Rep. Richard
Durbin, D-Ill., an Annunzio ally.
   Annunzio isn't talking about the coup. But Coston said news of
the discontent stunned his boss, especially after he successfully
defended his seat in the Nov. 6 election.
   Coston said he, Annunzio and others worked the phones Tuesday as
word spread that a revolt was underway.
   ``The man was tired after the election, mentally and physically
worn out. He wasn't prepared to take on another fight, particularly
among friends in his own party,'' Coston said.
   ``He's been a loyal servant in the trenches,'' he added, ``but
then again no one has accused this institution of being fair.''
   ``If you pay your dues, do you get stepped on?'' asked Rep. Mary
Rose Oakar, D-Ohio. ``He's very bitter about it.''
   While other panels tackle transportation, defense, education and
foreign affairs, Annunzio's Administration Committee is in charge
of the housekeeping of the House: staff size, employee pay,
computers, Capitol Hill Police, parking spaces, the barber shop.
   Perhaps not as weighty as MX missiles or student loans.
Nonetheless, a committee chairmanship is a juicy political plum
that only a handful of the 435 House members will ever receive.
   Durbin suggested that if Annunzio had introduced himself to more
of the newly elected Democrats he may have been able to survive the
challenge for the House Administration post.
   ``I'm sure their only knowledge of Frank Annunzio was from
recent news stories about the heated campaign and all the
accusations about his involvement in S&amp;Ls,'' Durbin said.
   ``Even though his own district obviously didn't believe those
charges, they're bound to take a toll on a person's good name,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Tadeusz Kantor, an internationally known
avant-garde theater director, author and painter, died Sunday in
Krakow. He was 75.
   The cause of death was not reported by Polish radio.
   Kantor was known for creating dynamic, inventive theater based
on historical and personal themes. He was present in his
productions not as an actor but sitting on stage, watching along
with the audience. He used scenery of his own creation.
   He was especially popular in France, where a Paris premiere was
scheduled in January for his newest play, ``Today is My Birthday.''
   Kantor was born April 6, 1915, in Wielopole in southern Poland
and studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Krakow.
   During World War II, he founded the underground, experimental
Independent Theater. He organized the first postwar modern art
exhibition in 1948 in Krakow and organized his Cricot 2 Theater
there in 1956.
   Among his productions were ``In the Little Country house'' in
1961, ``The Madman and the Nun'' in 1963 and ``Water Hen'' in 1967.
   His ``Theater of Death'' started with the 1975 premiere of ``The
Dead Class,'' which won international prizes.
   He participated in various theater festivals and art exhibitions
worldwide.

   ``I feel close to the numerous injured, and hope that they will
soon fully recover their youthful energy and the nimbleness that
corresponds to their age, so they can continue in full health to

<TEXT>
   A former leftist guerrilla group is
trying to capitalize on discontent with the two traditional
political parties in Sunday's election for a constitutional
assembly.
   The 70-member assembly will convene in February to rewrite the
104-year-old charter.
   Opinion polls indicate the M-19 party led by Antonio Navarro
could capture 40 percent of the vote and National Salvation, a new
conservative group, may do almost as well.
   Such a result would be a devastating rejection of the two
parties that have dominated Colombian politics for 150 years - the
Liberals and the Conservatives. Many voters blame the traditional
ruling classes for corruption and for failing to curb violence that
has taken tens of thousands of lives.
   If the polls are accurate, Navarro's former M-19 guerrilla
movement will become one of the most important political forces in
Colombia.
   M-19 laid down its weapons nine months ago in exchange for a
government pardon. Its leader, Carlos Pizarro, was assassinated
less than a month before presidential elections in May and his
replacement, Navarro, finished an unexpectedly strong third.
   Navarro was apppointed health minister, but resigned two months
ago to run for a seat in the constituent assembly.
   ``If we take control of the assembly, because that's how the
people want it, the result will have to be respected,'' he said in
an interview.
   Some Colombians fear the army, which has been fought guerrilla
insurgencies for three decades, will take over the government if
M-19 wins control of the assembly.
   Politicians and newspaper columnists are dredging up the group's
violent past to warn or frighten voters.
   ``Immoral acts committed in the past remain unpunished, but not
forgiven,'' said Alvaro Gomez, a former Conservative Party leader
who founded National Salvation. Gomez was kidnapped by M-19 in 1988
and held for 50 days.
   Navarro insists his party is not Marxist and that it seeks,
through political action, to help guarantee the civil rights of
``women, children, the elderly and members of the political
opposition.''
   His organization wants to set itself apart from its own past,
particularly the 1985 seizure of the Palace of Justice in which 100
people were killed, including 11 Supreme Court justices.
   Since giving up its weapons, M-19 has been under constant threat
of violence from political enemies.
   After Navarro told President Cesar Gaviria recently of an
assassination plot, Gaviria strengthened the security detail
protecting the M-19 leader.
   Few election rallies were held. Many candidates, including
Navarro, did not take their campaigns to the streets for fear of
being killed.
   Few doubt Colombia's powerful cocaine cartels donated money to
candidates, but it is difficult to measure their involvement.
Candidates rarely mentioned the government's 15-month-old war on
drug traffickers.
   Drug barons were blamed for the murders of three candidates
before the presidential election in May, including Pizarro of M-19.
   Cocaine traffickers hope the constituent assembly, empowered to
consider any issue, will prohibit extraditions to the United States
and help them receive pardons from the government.
   The campaign was characterized by vague statements on the need
to modernize society and curb corruption.
   Clara Lopez, an outspoken human rights activist, said the
election gives voters a chance to send a message to Colombian
politicians, whose actions she compared to President Bush's
unfulfilled read-my-lips pledge not to raise taxes.
   ``Unfortunately, we've been reading lips for 30 years,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Co-ops That Power Rural America Threatened by Billions in Loan
Defaults</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A historic federal program that modernized
thousands of farms and provides electricity to 25 million Americans
is threatened by financial failures that taxpayers may have to
absorb.
   A handful of rural electric cooperatives have defaulted on
billions of dollars in government and private loans. And those
defaults have undermined the health of the federal agency that
supports hundreds of other co-ops.
   That agency, the Rural Electrification Administration, channels
low-interest loans and other subsidies to America's electric
co-ops. Co-ops owe the agency $20 billion, but in its 1989 fiscal
budget, the REA anticipated as much as 10 percent of that amount -
$2.06 billion - wouldn't be repaid.
   Unlike privately owned utilities, rural electric cooperatives
are owned by the people who use them and are not run for profit.
There are about 1,000 in the United States - from tiny operations
that provide power to a few scattered customers to larger outfits
that serve hundreds of thousands.
   Only a small fraction are in serious trouble, but nearly all
have gotten low-interest federal loans or federal guarantees for
bank loans. If co-ops don't pay back their REA loans, the agency
could have trouble repaying its own debt to the Treasury
Department. Taxpayers would indirectly have to make up that lost
money through an increased federal budget deficit.
   Eight rural electric co-ops currently are in default on $2.3
billion in loans from the REA; four of the eight are in Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization. The eight also owe $1.25 billion to
private creditors.
   The REA itself must repay a $7.9 billion loan from the U.S.
Treasury by 1993.
   The REA charges only 5 percent interest on most loans to
electric co-ops, while it costs the Treasury around 8.5 percent to
borrow the money the REA lends. Because of the growing costs of the
co-op loans, the REA's loan from Treasury ``is drifting toward
insolvency,'' according to Ronald Utt, a Washington economist.
   ``Without substantial reforms, and with this (Treasury) loan
coming due, a major taxpayer bailout will be needed to allow REA to
continue operations,'' Utt concluded in a study published in June
by the conservative Heritage Foundation.
   In most cases, the foundering co-ops were victims of oil price
instability, the farm slump of the mid-1980s, and a dose of
overambition and overbuilding. In one case, a federal bankruptcy
judge found the managers and directors of a big Colorado co-op
incompetent and appointed an outside trustee to run it.
   Many co-ops ``were taking a gamble, and unfortunately they were
leaning on the federal government to finance their gamble,'' said
Harold V. Hunter, the head of the REA from 1981 through late 1988.
   Hunter noted that the biggest losses have been made by electric
co-ops that got into the power generation business, building
expensive new plants. Until recently, the co-ops stuck mainly to
their traditional business of buying power in bulk from privately
owned electric utilities.
   In the 1970s and 1980s, fearing potential oil shortages and high
oil prices, and wary of air quality regulations that made coal
plants costly to run, some co-ops turned to expensive nuclear
power. One of the biggest casualties of that policy was Wabash
Valley Power Association Inc. of Indianapolis, now in bankruptcy
reorganization. It owes the REA $1 billion.
   The rural electrification program, a New Deal legacy that stirs
near-religious fervor among its supporters, was established to
provide electric power to rural America with loans made or
guaranteed by the federal government. It revolutionized farming by
powering refrigeration and liberating farmers from many burdensome
hand chores.
   But critics contend that the program stopped serving its purpose
long ago and is a waste of taxpayers' money. They point to studies
showing that most REA loans now go to finance projects in suburban,
rather than rural, areas - including new electric hookups in
retirement communities and vacation resorts.
   The REA also is tangled in lawsuits with some of its troubled
co-op borrowers.
   In Denver, for example, the agency filed a motion in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court against Colorado-Ute Electric Association Inc.,
charging more than 60 instances of alleged mismanagement by co-op
officials. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Patricia Clark recently appointed
an outside trustee to take over management of the cooperative.
   The Bush administration, looking for ways to cut the ballooning
federal budget deficit, has mounted a behind-the-scenes attack on
the REA subsidies. But those efforts are up against the powerful
electric co-op lobby and rural Democrats in Congress who control
REA's funding.
   The current REA administrator is Gary C. Byrne. He took over
last March, the first banker to hold a position traditionally
occupied by farmers and ranchers.
   ``His mission is to make sure that all the loans are repaid ...
to make sure we don't have another savings and loan crisis,'' said
Stan Lewandowski, general manager of Intermountain Rural Electric
Association Inc. of Sedalia, Colo., and a former REA official.
   While the co-ops' losses don't approach the magnitude of the
$500 billion S&amp;L scandal, they come at a time when the farm sector
already has been shaken by a financial scare of its own. The
federal Farm Credit System, which makes loans to farmers for crop
production, lost billions of dollars in the agricultural slump of
the mid-1980s and had to be bailed out by the taxpayers.
   Could the electric co-op program suffer the same fate? ``There
is that possibility, I'm sure,'' said Hunter, the former REA chief.
   Wall Street already has expressed its apprehension about the
financial health of the electric co-ops. An offshoot of the REA,
the National Rural Utilities Co-operative Finance Corp., sells
bonds to private investors and uses the proceeds to make and
guarantee loans.
   Earlier this year, Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp;
Poor's lowered their ratings on some $4 billion in loans made or
guaranteed by the co-operative Finance Corp. It was the first such
ratings move since 1984.
   Lower bond ratings usually lead to higher interest rates, which
can cost electric co-ops millions of extra dollars on their bank
loans. The co-ops often pass the cost on to customers in the form
of higher electric rates, thereby defeating one of the REA's
primary missions: to provide cheap electricity to rural areas.

   Hostages who were held as ``human shields'' at strategic points
in Iraq arrived in Baghdad today and gathered at a luxury hotel as
they prepared for their departures, which Iraqi officials said
would be complete by Christmas.
   The first of the estimated 8,000 foreign hostages were expected
to leave on Sunday and end their four-month ordeal, two days after
Iraq's rubber-stamp parliament approved President Saddam Hussein's
request to free them.
   A group of 17 Americans left Iraq today with former Treasury
Secretary John Connally, who was on a private visit to Baghdad. It
appeared their release had been arranged prior to Saddam's pledge
to free all captives.
   U.S. Embassy officials said they were en route to Ireland.
   A group of 41 Japanese men whose release was approved prior to
Thursday arrived in Amman aboard a chartered Iraqi Airways
jetliner.
   Nur Eldin Al-Safi, the head of Iraqi Airways, said no foreign
carriers would be allowed to fly the hostages out. He said
chartered Iraqi Airways flights could ferry them out within three
days, provided their travel documents were in order.
   Al-Safi said U.S. officials had chartered a Boeing 707 to fly to
Kuwait Sunday morning to pick up the Americans. He said the United
States also chartered a Boeing 747 to fly those Americans and
others in Baghdad to Frankfurt later Sunday.
   In groups of two or three, the Western hostages were ushered
into the Al-Mansour Melia Hotel and whisked past jornalists by
security agents. The luxury hotel is known as ``Hostage Hotel''
because foreigners headed out of the country and into the Iraqi
hinterlands often passed through it.
   ``We were treated well and did not encounter any hardships or
problems, but we're packed and ready to go,'' said David Singleton,
50, of New Orleans, who was held for four months at an industrial
site near Mosul, 250 miles north of the capital.
   American officials had asked Baghdad to allow the foreigners to
leave without exit visas, but Iraqi officials said today it might
take several days to process all the documents.
   About 900 Americans are among the estimated 8,000 Western, East
European and Japanese hostages in Iraq and occupied Kuwait. An
estimated 600 of the foreigners were believed held at strategic
sites to ward of an attack by U.S. and other forces.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said the processing of the
foreigners, which his government has insisted were ``guests'' and
not hostages, would be quick and he expected them all home for
Christmas.
   But ``it's not going to happen in one day,'' Aziz said in an
interview on ABC's ``Nightline'' program Friday night.
   Aziz also said foreigners in hiding since Iraq invaded Kuwait
Aug. 2 have nothing to fear.
   ``They can appear, and leave the city of Kuwait, or come to
Baghdad,'' he said.
   The State Department announced Friday it will close its besieged
mission in Kuwait once the Americans who wish to leave are free. It
denied the decision was a concession to Iraqi demands that all
embassies in Kuwait close.
   Eight diplomats and other Americans who sought refuge with them
have been living on canned tuna and boiled water from the embassy
swimming pool.
   In August, Iraq ordered all missions in Kuwait closed, cutting
off supplies to those refusing to comply. Only the British and
American embassies have remained open, in part to keep contact with
their nationals hiding in Kuwait.
   In London, the Foreign Office said its two-diplomat mission in
Kuwait will stay open.
   U.S. diplomats were faced with a dilemma today in considering a
U.N. Security Council resolution endorsing a Mideast peace
conference. A veto could alienate Arab allies, while letting it
pass would outrage Israel and its Jewish friends in America.
   Saddam has tried to link withdrawal of his troops from Kuwait
with Israel's abandonment of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
something Jerusalem flatly rejects.
   The U.S. Mission got the Security Council to rush through a
``use of force'' resolution against Iraq last week by assuring
other council members it would go along with a resolution calling
for an international conference to resolve strife in the
Israeli-occupied territories.
   Aziz said passage of the resolution wouldn't end the gulf
showdown, anyway. ``I've seen the draft (of the resolution) and it
is a very weak one,'' he said on ``Nightline.''
   In calling for the hostages' release, Saddam said Thursday that
he was responding to positive diplomatic overtures and that he no
longer needed the hostages because enough of his forces were
deployed in southern Iraq and Kuwait to ward off an attack.
   About 480,000 Iraqi troops are said to be in the region, facing
a multinational force of about 350,000, including 250,000 U.S.
troops. Bush plans to expand the U.S. deployment to more than
400,000 by mid-January.
   The aircraft carrier USS Ranger and seven escort ships were
leaving their home ports in San Diego and Long Beach, Calif., today
for the Middle East, the Pentagon announced. The Stuttgart,
Germany-based U.S. European command announced deployment of more
F-111 fighter planes to the gulf.

   Two men, both held hostage in Lebanon. Two men, now free,
dealing with their ordeal in different ways. Robert Polhill,
released after three years, hasn't lost his sense of humor, despite
his battle with throat cancer. Frank Reed, held 44 months in
blindfolds and bonds, is trying to find his place in the world. For
both men, life now is starting over.

   Seventeen American hostages left Iraq today
with former U.S. Treasury Secretary John Connally in a prelude to
an exodus of foreigners expected to begin in earnest on Sunday.
   Forty-one Japanese also flew to freedom.
   Arrangements for the release of both groups apparently were made
prior to the blanket release promised by Iraq on Friday.
   The head of Iraqi Airways said today his airline was ready to
fly out all foreign hostages within three days, provided their
travel documents were ready. But he said no foreign carriers could
transport them.
   Westerners formerly held as ``human shields'' at various
locations throughout Iraq arrived in Baghdad, hoping to leave the
country as soon as possible.
   ``We're glad we're here and we're happy it's over,'' said Dennis
E. Howard, 43, of Port Sulphur, La., who with another American was
held for four months at an industrial site near Mosul, about 250
miles north of the capital.
   President Saddam Hussein said on Thursday that the hostages
should be released, and the Iraqi parliament approved the plan on
Friday.
   Iraqi officials said the 17 American hostages left Baghdad on a
U.S. plane chartered by Connally. They were accompanied by eight
relatives, three U.S. Embassy personnel from Kuwait and three
Americans who had been hiding out at an unidentified safe haven in
Baghdad.
   The U.S. Embassy in Amman said they were headed to Ireland en
route home.
   The Japanese arrived in Amman, Jordan, aboard a chartered Iraqi
Airways jetliner accompanied by more than 60 relatives who had gone
to Baghdad to seek their release.
   Nur Eldin Al-Safi, the head of Iraqi Airways, said American
officials had chartered a Boeing 707 to fly to Kuwait Sunday
morning to pick up the Americans. He said the United States also
chartered a Boeing 747 to fly those Americans and others in Baghdad
to Frankfurt later Sunday.
   About 8,000 Westerners had been detained since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, including about 600 who were held at strategic
sites in an effort to deter any U.S. attack.
   The hostages included about 900 Americans as well as other
Westerners, Eastern Europeans and Japanese.
   There was no immediate indication when the hostages would be
issued exit visas, compulsory under Iraqi law, and government
officials said it might take several days to process their
documents.
   Dutch television reported today that all its hostages had been
issued exit visas.
   U.S. Embassy officials in Baghdad said they had received no
official notification of whether Iraqi authorities might possibly
waive the visa requirement to enable the detainees to leave sooner.
  Al-Safi said the state airline would ``serve as the exclusive
carrier for guests departing the country.'' It has prepared a fleet
of aircraft, including Boeing 747 jumbo jets, to fly the hostages
out, he said in a telephone interview.
   He said the Italian government had chartered a Boeing 707 to fly
about 50 Italians to Rome on Sunday. However, he said any
British-chartered flight might not be able to go directly to London
because Iraq is afraid British authorities might seize the
airliner.
   A British Airways Boeing 747 that landed in Kuwait before the
Aug. 2 invasion is still being held by Iraqi authorities.
   Al-Safi said any British charter could, however, fly to another
European point, probably Frankfurt or Paris.
   The Americans were elated at the prospect of departure, but
still nervous about delays.
   ``To say that we're glad to be on our way out is an
understatement,'' said David Singleton, 50, of New Orleans.
   Saddam's call to release all hostages came one week after the
U.N. Security Council approved the resolution authorizing an attack
on Iraq after Jan. 15 if Saddam fails to free the captives and
withdraw his troops from Kuwait.
   About 480,000 Iraqi troops are said to be in southern Iraq and
Kuwait, facing a multinational force of about 350,000, including
250,000 U.S. troops. Bush plans to expand the U.S. deployment to
more than 400,000 by mid-January.
   The State Department announced Friday that it will withdraw all
eight diplomats from its beleaguered mission in Kuwait once all the
Americans who wish to leave the emirate are free.
   In August, Iraq ordered all missions in Kuwait closed, cutting
off supplies to those refusing to comply. Only the British and
American embassies remained open, in part to keep contact with
their nationals hiding in Kuwait.
   In London, the Foreign Office said its mission in Kuwait would
stay open.
   In all, 2 million foreigners are in Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
Asians and Arabs, the majority of the foreigners, have been free to
leave.

<TEXT>
   The State Department on Saturday advised all
Americans to leave Somalia as soon as possible because of growing
chaos in the north African country.
   The department also urged Americans to defer all travel to
Somalia until it becomes safe.
   ``Communal violence is occurring in the city of Mogadishu and
violent crime and vehicle thefts are increasingly common. A state
of civil war exists in the countryside,'' the department said in a
prepared statement.
   Somalia, a nation of 8 million on the Horn of Africa, has been
plagued by civil war for several years. The situation worsened last
year when the authoritarian government of President Siad Barre
executed hundreds of Moslems protesting the arrest of their
religious leader.
   At least 20 people have been killed since Dec. 2 in violence in
the capital of Mogadishu, the State Department said.
   Soldiers and civilians have been looting government warehouses
for food, and guerrillas and troops have been exchanging
rocket-propelled grenades.
   A Somali who works for the U.S. Embassy was wounded Dec. 3 when
he drove into an area of Mogadishu where fighting was going on, the
department said.
   Although no Americans have been injured, the wives of U.S.
Ambassador James K. Bishop and of another diplomat were recently
robbed at gunpoint.
   The State Department said it was allowing all non-essential U.S.
personnel at the embassy to leave. It urged private Americans who
choose to remain to keep in close touch with the embassy.
   Sixty-six government personnel remain in Mogadishu, along with
54 of their dependents. There are also about 200 private Americans
in the country, the State Department said.
   With the near-collapse of the government, soldiers supplement
their meager pay with nightly forays into residential neighborhoods
darkened by lack of electricity.
   The city also is jammed with thousands of refugees from fighting
in the northern, central and southern parts of Somalia.
   Barre's government promised a national referendum for Oct. 23 on
a proposed new constitution, but the vote was postponed
indefinitely.
   Critics say the referendum would be meaningless because the
government could not conduct a vote in the vast areas it no longer
controls.
   Barre also proposed discussions with critics and armed
opponents. Two of the three major insurgent groups agreed to
attend. However, the president's enemies still are demanding his
departure as a first step in a solution.

<TEXT>
   In unmarked tents, under
camouflage nets or in mess halls, American soldiers are discreetly
holding religious services and making plans for Christmas and
Hanukkah.
   Religion is a delicate issue for the U.S. military, which has
chaplains in its combat battalions to meet the spiritual needs of
its soldiers.
   Saudi Arabia, a kingdom whose laws are based on the Koran, the
Moslem holy book, bans all religions except Islam.
   What has evolved since Operation Desert Shield began early in
August is a compromise, under which worship is accepted if there
are no outward displays.
   ``It's not as if we're trying to push our religious feelings off
on them,'' said Lt. Jackie Jones, 25, of Springfield, Va., from the
18th Airborne Corps.
   ``Some of us feel that, if these people invited us here to help
them defend their country, let us be ourselves. Why should we have
to pretend to be something we're not?''
   The U.S. Joint Information Bureau in Saudi Arabia does not allow
news coverage of church services because of Saudi sensitivities.
Taking photographs of chapels is forbidden. Chaplains, renamed
``morale officers,'' have been told not to give interviews.
   Codes are used to advertise services - ``C-Word morale
services'' for Roman Catholic Mass or ``J-Word'' for a Jewish
service. Some chaplains cover the crosses on their uniforms and
combat helmets, or even remove them.
   ``To me, that cross is a symbol of what I am and who I am,''
said a Protestant chaplain with the 82nd Airborne Division,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``It offended me that I would have to hide who I am, but in
retrospect, if it was the only means of carrying out our mission as
chaplains, no sacrifice is too great.
   ``In a quiet, unassuming way, the soldiers are being ministered
to. We don't draw attention to what we're doing, but we're able to
provide.''
   Some units are organizing choral groups and making plans for
Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve. Pre-Christmas services already are
being held.
   Dec. 9 is the second of four Sundays of Advent, when Christians
mark the coming of Jesus by lighting candles in a wreath.
   At sundown Dec. 11, Jews will light the first of eight candles
for Hanukkah.
   Many secular signs of the holidays can be found in the desert.
Artificial Christmas trees adorn bunkers, foxholes, offices and
hospital wards, but there are no outside displays.
   There are figures of Frosty the Snowman. English-language
Christmas cards and strands of twinkling lights have even appeared
in Saudi stores.
   ``We may have carried this cultural awareness thing a bit too
far,'' said Lt. Col. Gary Wilson, commander of a Marine recreation
area where Sunday services are held in a movie theater.
   A Saudi government official, speaking anonymouysly, said: ``It's
okay as long as they keep to their designated areas and as long as
they don't impose their beliefs on others.''
   Americans who work for the Aramco oil company have held private
services in their homes for years.
   Religion assumes greater importance not only because of the
holiday season, but because American soldiers are confronting their
own mortality.
   Capt. B.A. Arnold, an Air Force chaplain from Cannon Air Force
Base in Clovis, N.M., used the classic phrase: ``There are no
atheists in foxholes.''
   Marine Cpl. Nathan Lee, 30, of Jasper, Ga., said he had turned
to his Baptist roots.
   ``I never thought about it much before, but it's become more
important,'' he said. ``I could get killed over here. I feel I
should make my peace with God.''
   Cpl. Michael Flaga, 25, of McHenry, Ill., said attendance has
been high at weekly Bible study for non-denominational Christians.
He is Protestant lay leader for the 3rd Battalion, 9th Marine
Regiment.
   ``How can they possibly make someone stop?'' he said. ``We're
out in the middle of the desert. We have all the privacy we need.
We could run from hooch to hooch screaming `Hallelujah!' and no one
would hear us.''

   A law creating 74 new trial judgeships will
help some federal courts better cope with a flood of drug-related
prosecutions, judicial officials say. And the added help will
eliminate some long delays in civil lawsuits that one judge says
are ``lying there vegetating.''
   The law boosts the number of federal trial judges nationwide
from 575 to 649 as of 1991. Federal appellate judgeships will climb
from 168 to 179.
   ``These are the first additions since 1984, and in that period
the caseloads, particularly the number of drug-related criminal
cases, have risen dramatically,'' said David Sellers of the
Administrative Office of U.S. Courts.
   The U.S. Judicial Conference, the federal judiciary's
policy-making board, does not think 85 new judges are enough. It
had requested that Congress create 96 new posts.
   In the political give-and-take of getting the law enacted, some
judges were put in places where little need exists. Places such as
Utah, Wyoming, New Hampshire and Maine.
   But it appears that much of the help is headed for those areas
of the country that most need the help - the southern district of
Texas, for example.
   Stretched across a 45-county area of the Lone Star State that
includes the cities of Houston, Laredo and Brownsville, the
southern district is being expanded from 13 to 18 trial judges.
   ``All of us have more than we can say grace over. This is going
to be a tremendous boon,'' said James DeAnda, the district's
Houston-based chief judge.
   ``We've had amazingly large increases in our criminal docket,''
DeAnda said, ``led by a dramatic upsurge in drug cases. Because of
the priority given to criminal cases, due to the Speedy Trial Act,
we just are not giving any attention at all to our civil docket.
Civil cases are lying there vegetating.''
   The statistics are staggering. Of all the federal drug
prosecutions nationwide in 1989, 13 percent - 1,662 - of them were
filed in Texas' southern district, where 2 percent of all federal
trial judges work.
   That district handled more than twice the number of drug cases
of the district in second place, western Texas. The same
percentages are true for 1990.
   As a result, the average number of civil cases on a Texas
southern district judge's docket is approaching 700.
   ``All this and out there somewhere are lurking all those savings
and loan cases. We haven't seen the tip of the iceberg yet,''
DeAnda said, adding that his district already needs two more than
the five judges it is getting.
   Only one other district - the San Francisco-based central
district in California - is receiving as many as five additional
judges. It has 22.
   In all, 32 states are receiving at least one additional federal
trial judge.
   ``Nationally, I suspect we'll nee  more as soon as the first of
these positions is filled,'' the administrative office's Sellers
said. ``It's the nature of the business.''

<BYLINE>House Voted More Conservatively in 1990
^By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House's voting record was a bit more
conservative this year, and would have been even more so had it not
been for a major vote that paired conservative Republicans with
liberal Democrats against President Bush's budget plan, a survey
released Saturday shows.
   The Americans for Democratic Action said that on a scale of 0 to
100, the ``liberal quotient'' in the House was 49 percent on
average, down from 50 percent in 1989.
   Among Democrats, the quotient was 71 percent, down two
percentage points from 1989. Republicans' liberal rating increased
from 15 percent to 19 percent. Because Democrats outnumber
Republicans in the House, the overall quotient declined.
   Twenty-nine members of the House received perfect scores of 100
from the ADA, based on their voting records on such issues as civil
rights, defense spending, the budget, abortion rights and campaign
finance reform.
   That was an increase of four from the previous year and a jump
of 13 since 1988.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., headed the liberal list, receiving a
perfect score for the eighth straight year. Reps. Lane Evans,
D-Ill., and Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., were awarded scres of 100
for the fifth consecutive year.
   Kastenmeier was defeated in his bid for re-election last month.
   Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., received a 100 score for the
fourth consecutive year, while Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., was
awarded a score of 100 for the third time in three years.
   Thirteen members received scores of zero, including Reps. Edward
Madigan, R-Ill., Larry Combest, R-Texas, William Dickinson, R-Ala.,
and Bill Archer, R-Texas.
   More members would have scored zero on the ADA rating but for
their votes on the initial budget resolution that drew the ire of
liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans.
   ``Thirty-one traditionally conservative members supported the
liberal position in opposition to the summit budget resolution,''
said Amy Isaacs, national director of the ADA.
   ``This entire group was saved from getting a zero liberal
quotient when they rejected the irresponsible budget compromise,''
she said.
   Fifty-seven percent of Democrats scored 70 or more, down from 68
percent in 1989. Twenty-nine percent of Democrats scored between 40
and 69, up from 22 percent last year.
   Two percent of Republicans scored more than 70, down from 3
percent in 1989. Ten percent of Republicans scored between 40 and
69, an increase from 8 percent in 1989.
   Massachusetts ranked as the most liberal state, with an average
score of 85. Delaware was second with 78, Connecticut third at 72,
North Dakota fourth at 72 and New York fifth at 71 percent.
   Wyoming was the most conservative at 11 percent, New Hampshire
had 12 percent, Louisiana 21 percent, Alabama 24 percent and Idaho
rounded out the final five with 25 percent.
   Among the leadership, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., received a score of 83, while House Whip Rep. William Gray,
D-Pa., scored a 94 on the ADA list.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., rarely votes.
   On the Republican side, House Minority Leader Bob Michel of
Illinois scored 11, and House Republican Whip Rep. Newt Gingrich of
Georgia received a 17.
   Founded in 1947, the ADA is the nation's oldest liberal public
policy organization.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Serbia and Montenegro, the last
Communist-ruled Yugoslav republics, on Sunday hold multiparty
elections that could decide whether the country stays together or
disintegrates.
   In the country's largest republic, Serbia, the first free vote
in more than 50 years pits the Socialists, formerly the Communists,
against a host of center-right nationalist parties.
   In traditionally pro-Communist Montenegro, the country's
smallest republic, the vote is being contested by the ruling
Communists and 10 other parties, including some who seek union with
neighboring Serbia.
   In the struggle to shape the country's future, the western
republics of Croatia and Slovenia, where center-right parties
ousted Communists in spring elections, want more independence from
the federation and have threatened to secede.
   They are pitted against Serbia and Montenegro, whose politicians
generally favor a strong central government, although some have
accepted the possibility that the country could break up.
   The race between Socialist leader Slobodan Milosevic and his
bitter rival, Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal Movement, for
Serbia's powerful presidency is the most important in Sunday's
elections.
   Milosevic has so far refused to negotiate with rival Croatia and
Slovenia on the country's future. But Draskovic has suggested there
might be no stopping the country's breakup.
   ``If I become president, I would immediately negotiate with
Croatia and Slovenia in order to deflate this horrible balloon of
hatred in Yugoslavia,'' Draskovic said in a recent interview. ``If
we fail to reach an agreement about living together, we will set up
separate states.''
   The Serbian Reneval Movement poses the biggest challenge to the
Socialists. It demands the restoration of capitalism and the return
of Serbia's glory as a dominant Balkan state.
   The outcome of the vote in Serbia could decide a decade-long
struggle for power in Yugoslavia, which is being wracked by ethnic
and political tensions between its six constituent republics and
two provinces.
   With tensions in Yugoslavia running high, U.S. intelligence has
predicted the country could split in 18 months and civil war could
break out.
   Milosevic and Draskovic face 30 lesser rivals running for
Serbia's presidency.
   Also at stake are 250 seats in the republic's Parliament which
are contested by 44 parties.
   Pre-election polls indicated the Socialists were slightly ahead
of Draskovic's party. But they also indicated nearly 40 percent of
the republic's 6,865,445 eligible voters were still undecided.
   Serbia's opposition claims that the republic's acrimonious
election campaign has claimed five lives. The Socialists say those
were not politically motivated deaths.
   Opposition leaders repeatedly have alleged that the Socialists
were preparing to rig the elections to stay in power. They say that
since April the Communist authorities have stopped registering
deaths in Serbia to enter the non-existing votes in the coming
elections.
   The Socialists deny any wrongdoing.
   In last year's single-party Serbian elections, unregistered
voters, who in some cases were under age, were allowed to cast
ballots. As a result, Milosevic won with 104 percent of the votes
in some areas.
   Polls open at 7 a.m. and close 12 hours later. First official
results of the elections in the two republics are expected early
this week.
   Runoff elections in all districts where one candidate did not
get at least 50 percent of the votes are scheduled for Dec. 23.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle is considering
making a Christmas season trip to the Persian Gulf, where more than
250,000 U.S. troops are currently deployed, an administration
official said Saturday.
   The trip by Quayle to Saudi Arabia and possibly other countries
in the region is under active consideration by the White House but
no final decision has been made, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``There are a lot of considerations and diplomatic relations
with allies and the coalition, sort of a political read,'' before
the trip can be finalized, the official said.
   Among the factors being looked at are whether the trip will have
a diplomatic purpose as well as morale-building for the U.S. forces
who have to spend Christmas in the desert.
   The vice president would likely go before Christmas if he
undertakes the trip. How his travels might dovetail with Secretary
of State James A. Baker III's pending visit to Baghdad was unclear,
the source said. The date of Baker's visit is still up in the air,
but has been proposed for mid-to-late December.
   President Bush and his wife Barbara visited the troops in Saudi
Arabia on Thanksgiving.

   President Bush encountered scattered
anti-American protests during his five-country South America but
the worst example of turbulence occurred at 30,000 feet on his
flight from Argentina to Chile.
   Approaching the Andes Mountains on Thursday, the buffeting was
so bad that a secret service agent flying in a backup plane was
hurled against the ceiling and broke the arm of a seat on the way
down. He also suffered a back injury.
   The pilot of the lead plane in the convoy, carrying the news
media, said it was one of the worst cases of turbulence he had seen
in 30 years of flying. He blamed the wind shifts on distortions
caused by the Andes.
   Having been forewarned by the press plane pilot, the Bush party
aboard Air Force One was strapped in tight during the 10-minute
ordeal. Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it was strange
to see the hefty craft being tossed around like a Piper Cub.

   Speaking of heights, Bush's rhetoric on this trip has been
absolutely soaring. He has a ready answer for critics who accuse
him of a lack of vision: ``Read my South America speeches.'' He
told the Brazilian Congress, ``All of us have been galvanized by a
new era of hope and opportunity throughout the Americas.'' In
Argentina, he spoke of a ``new dawn in a new world.'' In Chile:
``Let us join together, to work toward this new world of progress
and hope for all the peoples of the Americas.''
   Bush's host here, President Carlos Andres Perez, is no slouch
when it comes to rhetorical fluorishes, calling Latin America an
``essential port of the new world...yearning to become an integral
part of that other new world that awakens to the dawn of a
stimulating, hopeful, final decade of the last century in the
second millenium of mankind.''
   Meanwhile, the rhetoric of leftist opponents of Bush's visit had
a vaguely familiar ring. Leaflets passed out in Uruguay called Bush
the ``representative of the superexploitation of our peoples,'' and
of ``the violence expressed in the invasions of Panama, Grenada and
the occupation of the Persian Gulf.''

   It's about a two-hour drive from the Uruguayan capital of
Montevideo to the resort city of Punta del Este, a relatively
simple trek for most people. When a U.S. president makes that kind
of trip, it becomes a major production. Since there is no large
airport in Punta del Este, the president's helicopter, Marine One,
was made available for the occasion, along with a half-dozen Army
Black Hawk helicopters, flown in from Fort Ord, Calif., for staff
and the press pool.
   Lots of man-hours went into preparations for the 30-minute
copter ride to Punta del Este. For Bush, the net result of all
these labors was a jog along the beach and a dip in the Atlantic
surf. Time consumed: about a half hour. The next morning, he
boarded Marine One again for the 1 hour and 40 minute ride to
Buenos Aires.

   The same high oil prices that sent the
nation's economy tottering into recession have left Louisiana with
a problem most state governments wish they had - a budget surplus.
   While New York, California and other states are being forced to
make painful budget cuts, Louisiana officials are haggling over
what to do with as much as $400 million in surplus money. And with
years of pinched budgets and deficit financing forced on the state
by the oil bust of the '80s, there is no shortage of ideas for what
to do with the windfall.
   Louisiana's economy usually bucks trends in the rest of the
nation, said Charles Pasqua, executive director of the Louisiana
Municipal Association.
   ``When we're in good shape, they go down,'' Pasqua said. ``When
they're in their heyday, we're at our low ebb.''
   The state's preliminary unemployment rate for October dropped to
6 percent, only slightly above the national average, after
skyrocketing above 13 percent during the late 1980s when the rest
of the nation was enjoying the longest economic boom in decades.
   A battle is looming in the Legislature on how to use the surplus
to make up for deficits and unmet needs that are left over from the
worst times since the Great Depression.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer has said part of the projected surplus could
be used to help retire about $900 million in bonds sold in 1987 to
help retire the state's accumulated deficit.
   The governor also has said he intends use at least $50 million
to bump salaries at state colleges and universities up to the
average of Southern states.
   Also, school support workers, school bus drivers and other vocal
groups want raises. And state workers want the Legislature to work
toward retiring the $6 billion deficit in the state retirement
system.
   Louis Lambert, a Democrat who plans to challenge Roemer, also a
Democrat, next year, said the windfall should be used to get rid of
1 cent of the state sales tax.
   State lawmakers also are hearing cries from local governments,
which have suffered from a $500 million decrease in federal and
state aid over the past five years.
   ``Reductions we've had in state aid over the past few years puts
us second to last in the states as far as state assistance to local
governments,'' Pasqua said. ``Yeah, we're hurting.''
   Local officials want relief from five years of financial chaos
that has reduced many parish roads to beaten-up paths, restricted
police and fire protection and left some local governments
virtually destitute.
   Problems often worsen because local governments in Louisiana
have little authority to raise money on their own. They must travel
to Baton Rouge each year and lobby for money and the authority to
raise taxes.
   Tangipahoa Parish, for example, had a severe financial crisis in
1988 and 1989. But Roemer refused to let the parish - Louisiana's
equivalent of a county - file for bankruptcy protection because he
was afraid of the effect it would have on the state's bond rating.
   Voters finally approved enough taxes to keep the parish running.
   Pasqua said city governments are reporting increases in sales
tax revenues and in building permits, indicating an upturn, but
things still aren't good.
   James T. Hays, executive secretary of the Louisiana Police Jury
Association, said an improved state economy should help local
governments, but they still will have a hard time digging out of
the hole. A police jury is the rough equivalent of a county
council.
   ``The voters out there have seen state government raise taxes
and it makes it difficult for local governments to raise taxes,''
Hays said. ``Along with inflation, all of these things coupled
together have put the parishes in a severe financial strain.''
   After next year, the state won't have to decide what to do with
extra money from booming oil prices. Effective July 1, revenues
from oil at more than $22 per barrel will go into a highly
restricted fund that can be used only to pay off state debt and
reduce the deficit in the retirement system.

<HEAD>Crowds in Liverpool to Mark 10th Anniversary of John Lennon's
Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIVERPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of fans of rock legend and
former Beatle John Lennon gathered in the snow on a windy Saturday
for a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of his death.
   Liverpool's mayor, Dorothy Gavin, led Lennon devotees who laid
wreaths at the foot of a bronze statue of The Beatles in the city's
Cavern Walks shopping center.
   The center was built on the original site of the Cavern Club,
made famous when The Beatles played there in the 1960s, and has
become a place of pilgrimage.
   ``Give peace a chance,'' the title of one of singer-songwriter
Lennon's greatest hits, was the theme for the day.
   Many friends and followers of Lennon were present, including
Father Tom McKenzie, immortalized as Father MacKenzie in The
Beatles' l966 hit song ``Eleanor Rigby.''
   On Friday, a small group of invited guests had gathered at
Liverpool's Beatles Museum to watch Mrs. Gavin unveil a plaque
marking the 10th anniversary of Lennon's death.
   ``John was always a son of Liverpool and over the last 10 years
Liverpool has been very slow to recognize the fact that the Beatles
came from Liverpool,'' said Lennon biographer Ray Coleman after the
unveiling.
   ``It is right that a world figure like Lennon should be
recognized at last,'' said Coleman, author of ``John Lennon.''
   Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, were returning to their apartment
in New York's Dakota apartment building after a recording session
on Dec. 8, 1980, when Lennon was shot to death by Mark David
Chapman, a deranged fan to whom Lennon had given his autograph only
hours before. Lennon was 40.
   A spokesman for the Lennon family said Ms. Ono and the couple's
son, Sean, were in Europe and would spend the anniversary
privately.
   Journalist Andy Peebles, the last person to interview Lennon
before he was shot, said in an interview with Sky satellitetelevision news:
``Ten years on, it's a ghastly feeling to think
that you had spent ... seven hours ... with somebody you have been
a fan of for years, and I think I left ... thinking `This is great,
he's in really good shape.'''
   Peebles said late in 1980 that Lennon had just recovered from a
period when he had ``gone off the rails'' and his relationship with
Ms. Ono had suffered. ``But (when I saw him) they'd had the baby,
Sean had been born, and everything was great.''

   Young artists are planning a gala
concert to mark the 75th birthday of Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, whose
vocal recitals and opera roles captivated international audiences
for almost four decades.
   The famed soprano will mark her birthday quietly Sunday with
friends at her home near Zurich, but former students and fans have
planned a tribute for Tuesday at Stuttgart's Liederhalle.
   ``You were the musical model of my entire generation,'' said
Russian-born pianist Elisabeth Leonskaya in program notes for the
German concert.
   ``Your light shone to us in Russia, your recordings - there was
no other possibility to listen to you - were a ray in the skies.''
   Miss Schwarzkopf still gives ``master classes'' to top students
in Stuttgart, Salzburg in Austria and the Swiss capital, Bern.
   A native of Jarocin, now part of Poland, Miss Schwarzkopf rose
to stardom after World War II, performing in Europe and the United
States.
   Critics acclaimed her lieder singing, especially her
interpretations of works by Wolf, Schubert and Bach.
   She retired from opera in 1971 but continued lieder recitals
until 1979, the year of the death of her British husband, Walter
Legge, formerly artistic director of a leading international record
company.
   She holds both British and Austrian citizenship.

   Columbia's problem-plagued
astronomy mission encountered more trouble today when lines to
remove waste water from the shuttle became clogged, and NASA
considered shortening the flight by a day or two.
   There was no danger to the crew, but NASA quickly put into place
plans for handling the shuttle's constantly growing supply of waste
water.
   Randy Stone, chief of NASA's flight director office, said it was
doubtful the shuttle would have to return to Earth on Sunday and
that Monday was a more likely scenario. The 10-day mission was not
supposed to end until Tuesday night.
   ``We're hopeful we'll get to 10 days, but from where we stand
right now, I'm not terribly optimistic that we can make it'' until
then, Stone said. ``Certainly, we won't give up on that because we
want to maximize the science we're getting out of the mission.''
   The astronauts already have had to scrap more than a third of
250 planned observations of galaxies, supernovas and other objects
because of prior problems with NASA's $150 million Astro
observatory. The newly developed water line problem was not
affecting this morning's scientific work.
   After the lines to remove waste water from a tank aboard the
shuttle were found to be blocked, crew members tried purging the
lines with air. The astronauts said they succeeded in removing some
debris, but there was still partial blockage.
   Mission Control instructed astronaut Mike Lounge to hook up a
large rubber bag to remove some waste water from the tank. Before
Lounge began the task this morning, the tank was about two-thirds
full and would have been at capacity within 20 hours if current
water usage rates had continued.
   The transfer to the bag should provide another 40 hours of
flight time. THe astronauts were also cutting waste water buildup
by using urine collection bags instead of the toilet, NASA said.
But two days are needed as contingency time for landing the shuttle
in case a problem like bad weather at landing sites forced a delay.
   Officials were hesitant to dump any water from the tank through
the blocked lines because the water might freeze before it reached
heaters and result in a more clogging, Hartsfield said.
   Scientists who have endured equipment failure throughout the
mission said they naturally will be disappointed if the mission
must be shortened.
   ``We feel now that things are going rather well. We would be
very disappointed but we also understand that's also the way the
mission works,'' said Warren Moos, part of the Johns Hopkins
University telescope team. ``If there's something that endangers
the spacecraft, you simply have no choice.''
   The latest problem sprang up just after scientists said Friday
that the mission appeared to be back on track and they were excited
about results so far, even with the delays caused by the problems
earlier in the mission.
   ``We just keep coming back,'' said Chris Anderson, a member of
the scientific team on the ground monitoring one of the telescopes.
``We've worked together ... in bringing this thing back from what
looks like absolute disaster to go on.''
   Unless the newly developed problem changes their plans, this
afternoon the seven astronauts planned to try to spot the Galileo
spacecraft as it passes by Earth, using the planet's gravity like a
slingshot to boost it along on its six-year journey to Jupiter.
Galileo was to fly about 2,484 miles above the shuttle today.
   Observations were halted for half a day Thursday when a computer
terminal aboard Columbia overheated and shut down. The only other
on-board terminal capable of operating the Astro had failed Sunday.
   Earlier in the week, the astronauts lost observing time because
of problems with the system that points the observatory's three
ultraviolet telescopes.
   NASA solved the problems by having scientists on the ground
activate and point the telescopes, then having the astronauts focus
them on exact targets by using a joystick and following directions
from the ground.
   ``Now we're making so much progress it's unbelievable,'' said
Arthur Davidsen of Johns Hopkins University, principal investigator
for one of the telescopes.
   A fourth ground-controlled X-ray telescope with a separate
pointing system has operated well throughout most of the mission.
Scientists used it Friday to discover evidence of a black hole in a
galaxy 325 million light years away.
   ``(That) tells us that indeed there are likely to be giant black
holes at the centers of these galaxies,'' said Peter Serlemitsos, a
scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
   The ultraviolet telescopes were used to observe several objects
Friday, including supernovas, several galaxies and the planet
Jupiter.
   The four astronomers on Columbia discussed the mission's earlier
problems during a televised science lesson conducted Friday from
the spacecraft for 41 middle school students gathered at NASA
centers in Alabama and Maryland.
   ``Unfortunately, we've had some failures with computer terminals
which have caused us to have to redo the way that we operate this
mission,'' astronaut Ron Parise said. ``So it's been quite tedious
and time-consuming to figure out how to do that.
   ``But we're slowly working around everything and we're getting
science data and doing our job,'' he said.
   More than 250 observations were originally planned for the
mission, but many low-priority targets were scrapped because of the
problems.
   NASA officials said it was not known how many objects would be
viewed before the mission ends Tuesday. However, by Thursday's
computer failure, only 70 of a revised list of 187 observations had
been completed.
   The telescopes are designed to study ultraviolet rays and X-rays
from some of the hottest and most violent objects in the universe.
Those rays are invisible to ground instruments because they are
absorbed by Earth's atmosphere.

   A series of aftershocks jolted northern Japan on
Saturday following several earthquakes, and police reported
landslides, cracked roads and damaged buildings.
   There were no reports of injuries from the series of quakes
Friday evening near Takada, 140 miles north of Tokyo.
   A total of 10 aftershocks had been recorded following the first
and strongest earthquake Friday evening, which registered 5.5 on
the Richter scale, the Central Meteorological Agency said.
   No Richter readings were available for the aftershocks.
   All the quakes on Friday were centered at a depth of about three
miles in western Niigata Prefecture along the coast of the Sea of
Japan, it said.
   Police said the earthquakes caused a 75-foot section of a road
to sink, set off 30 landslides, and created cracks in roads and the
ground at 60 locations.
   The hardest-hit area was Takayanagimachi, a town of 4,000
people, where a dozen homes suffered minor damage, including broken
furniture and window panes, police said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.

   While supporters and critics at home cheer
President Bush's decision to seek talks with Iraq, some of his
allies abroad are eyeing a peaceful end to the crisis with distinct
trepidation. ``Saddam will be back to get us,'' said one.
   The allies in Europe fear that while Bush's lips say ``no'' to
negotiations, his actions imply ``yes.'' And the allies in the
Persian Gulf say negotiations may get Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein out of Kuwait but they won't get him off their backs.
   Publicly, the allies expressed relief when President Bush
announced 10 days ago that Secretary of State James A. Baker III
will go to Baghdad. It appeared the United States appeared to have
pulled back from the brink of war.
   But privately, U.S. European allies expressed anger at not being
consulted or forewarned of the proposed Baker trip, said a French
diplomat who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   And the gulf allies, also upset at not being consulted, voiced a
greater concern: that while Iraq still may be forced to pull out of
Kuwait, its million-strong military and abundant conventional and
non-conventional arsenals will remain a heavy menace on their
borders.
   ``He has said this clearly: Saddam will be back to get us,''
Rashed al-Rashed, former Kuwaiti minister of state for cabinet
affairs, said in an interview last week.
   Al-Rashed, who is touring the United States to explain the
position of the exiled Kuwaiti leadership, said he hoped Saddam
will be toppled by Iraqi opposition forces within one year after he
loses Kuwait. The Kuwaiti leadership is supporting the Iraqi
opposition organizing abroad, he said.
   In the meantime, even if Saddam pulls out, the allies will have
to maintain an embargo to prevent anything but food and medicine
from reaching Iraq and strengthening his control, al-Rashed said.
   U.S. analysts don't believe Iraq's opposition is strong enough
to pose a threat to Saddam. But Baker and other top administration
officials are aware of the threat Saddam will pose in the
post-withdrawal era.
   Baker has discussed with the allies creation of a regional
security force to deter Iraqi attack. He has also said the allies
will have to devise sanctions to prevent Iraq from acquiring the
kind of technology it needs to bolster its chemical and biological
weapons, and develop its fledgling nuclear capabilities.
   But this could be a slow and futile battle.
   ``The gulf neighbors' ultimate concern is the threat Saddam
poses to their regimes,'' said Marvin Feuerwerger, an analyst with
the Washington Institute of Near East Policy. ``He has a long
memory. Their greatest fear is he'll target them and bring them
down.''
   Egypt, which has committed a large contingent to the
multinational force in Saudi Arabia, also has mixed feelings about
Bush's actions, even though it isn't an immediate neighbor of Iraq.
   ``To agree to sit down with Iraq before it implements any of the
international community's demands is tantamount to acquiescing to''
Iraqi dictates, the official al-Ahram newspaper said in a recent
editorial.
   The move elevates Saddam's status in the Arab world, the
newspaper said, and ``it could limit and shackle America's freedom
of action under the watchful gaze of an expectant world.''
   First indications of such a limitation came when Saddam, clearly
catching the administration by surprise, announced Thursday he
would let more than 8,000 foreigners leave Kuwait and Iraq.
   ``The administration couldn't do anything but say it was happy,
even while knowing Saddam was manipulating the situation,'' said a
Western diplomat who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   Bush appears aware of this ploy. In reacting to first word of
the hostage release, Bush told reporters in Santiago, Chile, that
he would not give Saddam a ``face-saving'' way out of the crisis
and that Iraq would still have to comply with U.N. demands for its
unconditional withdrawal.
   Bush said Saturday in Caracas, Venezuela, that departure of
American hostages and diplomats from Iraq and Kuwait will make it
easier to go to war if Saddam refuses to pull out of Kuwait.
   ``That's just one less worry I've got,'' Bush told a news
conference when asked about his decision to withdraw the remaining
handful of diplomats from the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait.
   Another U.S. ally that is clearly and publicly unhappy with
Bush's decision to talk to Iraq is Israel, which Saddam has
repeatedly threatened with annihilation.
   Frustrated at being denied membership in the anti-Iraq
coalition, Israel nonetheless agreed to sit on the sidelines as
long as it believed the United States would remove Iraq's military
threat.
   Now that a peaceful solution to the standoff appears in the
offing, Israel is worried.
   Foreign Minister David Levy last week summoned the U.S.
ambassador to tell him that if the United States doesn't remove the
Iraqi threat, Israel might, Israeli officials said.
   Levy himself told Israel Television that ``in order to defend
herself ... Israel will not call on anyone to fight its war or
anyone else's soldiers, but will reply with all its might.''

<HEAD>Bumble Bee Inc., Environmentalists Snipe Over Dolphin-Safe Tuna</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA LEVITT RYCKMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists are making new waves over the
issue of dolphins dying in tuna nets, accusing a U.S. canner of
lying about its commitment to ``dolphin-safe'' policies.
   The company, Bumble Bee Seafoods, Inc., denied the allegations
and said it was the target of a misleading campaign.
   Full-page advertisements placed in major newspapers by the San
Francisco-based Earth Island Institute urged consumers to boycott
Bumble Bee products, saying, ``Alone among the three major canners,
Bumble Bee has lied bout its corporate connection to the netting
and drowning of dolphins.''
   The ads appeared Tuesday in the Los Angeles Times, the San
Francisco Chronicle and the San Francisco Examiner, and Wednesday
in The New York Times.
   On Friday, San Diego-based Bumble Bee, a subsidiary of Unicord
Co. Ltd. and the nation's third-largest tuna canner, responded with
its own ads saying Earth Island has ``mounted a campaign against
Bumble Bee which included false and misleading statements. ... It
is time to set the record straight. Bumble Bee is dolphin-safe.''
   ``We are being lambasted by Earth Island as they try to
grandstand in the twilight of this issue to generate
contributions,'' said Mark Koob, president of Bumble Bee. ``And
it's absolutely irresponsible.''
   ``That's the typical cynical response of a desperate man,'' said
Samuel LaBudde, Earth Island research biologist. ``We're in this
for one reason only, and that's to save dolphins.''
   In April, Bumble Bee, Starkist and Chicken of the Sea brands
announced that they would no longer buy or sell tuna caught with
dolphins. Environmentalists had estimated that more than 100,000
dolphins died each year in huge nets used to catch tuna in the
eastern Pacific Ocean.
   H.J. Heinz-owned Starkist, the world's largest tuna canner, and
Chicken of the Sea, a product of Van Kamp Seafood and the
second-largest, implemented the policy immediately. But Bumble Bee
said it would take six months to phase out its contracts with boats
that caught dolphins with tuna.
   ``By creating this six-month window for themselves, they used it
as an opportunity to buy a lot of cheap, dolphin-unsafe tuna and
engaged in a deception where they were putting these dolphin-safe
labels on individual cans of tuna, while the company was anything
but dolphin-safe,'' LaBudde said.
   ``There have been fish caught in connection with dolphin during
the transition period, yes. That fact has been disclosed and it's a
matter of public record,'' Koob said.
   All Bumble Bee tuna labeled dolphin-safe was just that, he
added.
   Earth Island observers said that after the transition period
expired in October, Bumble Bee purchased 2,600 tons of tuna caught
with dolphins that had been rejected by other canners, including
Starkist. The company then resold it, LaBudde said.
   Koob said that Unicord did buy the cargo, but he called the
purchase a mistake and said it was quickly resold.
   ``We have so many different stories from Unicord and Bumble Bee
officials concerning this shipment of 2,600 tons of tuna that it's
really difficult to say what happened,'' LaBudde said. ``It doesn't
even appear that they know themselves, they've changed their story
so many times.''
   LaBudde, who boarded a tuna boat three years ago and documented
thousands of dolphin deaths, denied that Earth Island was acting
vindictively.
   ``We're taking them to task because they've lied and deceived
the environmental community,'' he said, ``and we feel like they
have through their actions demonstrated their absolute contempt for
the environmental community, the American consumer and for the
concept of dolphin-safe tuna.''
   Koob said the company would decide in a week whether to take
legal action against Earth Island for its statements.
   ``I do believe they're going to hurt us,'' he said. ``But I also
know this is a quality company with a quality brand and quality
people. We've been through tough times before. We'll get through
this.''

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has banned
permanently the peacetime loading of current-model, short-range
nuclear missiles onto strategic aircraft placed on alert, a
Pentagon spokesman said Saturday.
   The decision to ground the Short-Range Attack Missile-A, or
SRAM-A, was based on concerns that an accident could result in
plutonium dust, an extraordinarily potent cancer-causer, being
spread over a large area.
   Cheney issued a temporary order June 8 barring the missile from
being loaded on B-52, B-1 and FB-111 bombers after the directors of
three nuclear weapons laboratories expressed fears over the
``remote'' possibility of such an accident in testimony to
Congress.
   His decision to make the ban permanent follows an internal Air
Force and Energy Department assessment that substantiated the
scientists' concerns, according to Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Oborn.
   The order does not prohibit other nuclear weapons, including
longer-range missiles and gravity bombs, from being loaded aboard
any of the nation's 372 strategic bombers while they are on
``ground alert'' status. Nor will it prohibit loading a safer
replacement for the SRAM-A, the SRAM-2, when it is eady for
deployment in 1993.
   The Air Force has said 1,500 of the SRAM-As were produced
between 1971 and 1975, but the current number deployed is
classified. The Washington Post reported Saturday that hundreds of
the missiles are located at 13 bases in nine states. Oborn declined
to discuss locations of either domestic or overseas deployments.
   The SRAM-A is a 14-foot, air-to-surface missile armed with a
W-69 nuclear warhead with an estimated explosive yield of 170,000
tons of TNT, or 11 to 13 times the power of the bomb that destroyed
Hiroshima in 1945.
   Defense writers have said it is designed for use against targets
that threaten the bombers themselves, such as radar stations,
fighter bases and anti-aircraft missile sites, and have estimated
its range at 100 miles.
   The safety concern is focused on whether accidental aircraft
fires could detonate the conventional explosives surrounding the
missile's nuclear core, and that the blast could disperse the
highly lethal plutonium. Such an accident, scientists say, would
pose no risk of actually detonating the weapon.
   The weapon has not been carried aboard B-52s, B-1s or FB-111s on
training missions. Rather, it has been loaded only on aircraft
assigned to ground alert - meaning they are armed, fueled and ready
to fly within minutes, usually stationed near the end of a runway
for quick takeoff in the event of a crisis. The number of planes on
such alert is classified.
   Oborn said the SRAM-As will remain at storage facilities where
they still could be loaded and used in the event of actual war.

   Hindus and Moslems clashed in a central
city Saturday, and news reports said at least seven people died,
including four passengers dragged from a train by a mob.
   The clashes in Aligarh, 80 miles southeast of New Delhi, forced
the city adminstration to call for army reinforcements and impose
an indefinite curfew, United News of India said.
   Fighting also broke out in the southern city of Hyderabad, and
UNI said one person was slain.
   At least 380 people have been killed in Hindu-Moslem violence in
the last two months after Hindu fundamentalists announced plans to
take over a mosque and replace it with a temple.
   The deaths in Aligarh brought the total number of people killed
in sectarian violence in the city since Friday to at least 16,
Press Trust of India and UNI said.
   The news agencies did not name the victims. Indian media
prohibit identification of victims or the perpetrators of sectarian
violence for fear that it will exacerbate further tensions.
   UNI said the city adminstration called the army to help the
police and imposed an indefinite curfew restricting people to their
homes. It was not immediately known what caused the clashes.
   Among the victims were four passengers of a train who were
dragged out and killed by a mob, UNI said.
   In the Hindu temple town of Ayodhya, the flashpoint of a
lingering dispute between India's Hindu majority and Moslem
minority, at least 1,200 Hindu fundamentalists allowed themselves
to be arrested on Saturday as part of a campaign to replace the
disputed mosque with a temple.
   ``Courting'' arrest is a traditional form of protest in India.
Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of people are detained for few hours
and then released without charges.
   The religious crisis ignited by the Hindu campaign also
triggered the downfall of previous Prime Minister V.P. Singh's
government.
   Singh was replaced Nov. 10 by Chandra Shekhar, who has said he
will attempt to defuse the issue by holding talks with religious
leaders. The talks have made no real progress.
   Hindus say Moslem invaders built the small mosque atop a temple
marking the birthplace of the Hindu god Rama. Moslems say it is
impossible to pinpoint where Rama was born.
   Hindus make up 82 percent of India's 880 million people. Moslems
comprise 12 percent.

   Scott Riddle is making a home where the
elephants roam, where he and the pachyderms can play. Three of
them, weighing at least 4,000 pounds each, lumber around his farm
where cows once grazed.
   Riddle has trained elephants for 26 years for circuses, movies
and advertising. Now the veteran of the Los Angeles Zoo and other
zoos is establishing a breeding farm and sanctuary for elephants on
his 330-acre spread in Arkansas.
   ``He's an unusual man,'' said Tony Valenzuela, curator of
mammals at the Los Angeles Zoo and a member of the board of
Riddle's organization.
   Last fall, Riddle left his home in Melbourne, Fla., for Quitman,
Ark. He and his wife, Heidi, packed up their two children in the
family motor home, and Mary, Mugsy and Solomon climbed into their
custom-built trailer.
   Mary, a 16-year-old Asian elephant, has been with Riddle for
half of her life. She was deemed untrainable when he found her, but
now children climb aboard her for rides at the Little Rock Zoo.
   His other two elephants are from Africa, where they had faced
death in a culling, or herd-thinning, operation. Riddle, who
disagrees with culling, said baby elephants that can be sold are
spared.
   That's how Solomon and Mugsy ended up in Florida. Riddle said
they had been bought by a wealthy man ``who wanted a bunch of
elephants.'' When the novelty wore thin for the prior owner, Riddle
acquired them about five years ago.
   Besides beginning a breeding program, Riddle plans to take in
other orphan elephants. ``We will open the door to any elephant
that needs a home,'' he said. ``And I think that people will call
us.''
   But it's costly to run an elephant farm. Riddle estimated the
weekly cost of keeping one elephant runs about $100. He established
a non-profit corporation last summer to seek donations,
sponsorships and memberships.
   ``We're the only non-profit corporation dedicated solely to
elephants, I believe, in the world. ... The animal business is
getting very hard because of the position in the world of the
animals, especially elephants, getting extinct,'' he said.
   Poaching, culling and loss of habitat are the greatest threats
to the elephant's survival, said Riddle, who calls for a lifting of
limits on importation of elephants to this country.
   At his farm, Riddle plans to offer instruction on basic handling
of elephants. ``You'd be surprised how many people in the public
want to do it,'' he said.
   ``I'm not a bleeding heart but I think if we can save one
elephant, we can accomplish something. If we save one person from
being hurt, we've accomplished something, because elephants can be
dangerous,'' he said.
   Riddle ranks elephants alongside dolphins and the great apes in
intelligence.
   ``I've been around elephants long enough to know that they are
very, very intelligent,'' he said. ``They have a very intricate
social structure, they discipline their young.
   ``They think, they reason, they plan.''

<TEXT>
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's
resignation last week came after his generals withdrew their
support for his embattled regime, a senior aide to the ousted
president said Saturday.
   Ershad feared the military would stage a coup unless he bowed to
the unrelenting pressure of massive public demonstrations demanding
his immediate resignation, the aide said.
   Ershad, a former general who seized power in 1982 and ruled
under military law for four years, announced Tuesday that he was
stepping down following seven weeks of street protests that the
army failed to quell.
   ``Initially, we didn't take it (the protests) seriously,'' said
the source, one of the seven people in Ershad's inner circle during
his final days in office.
   The president expected the army to contain the unrest as it had
before, but Ershad ``had lost touch with the military, which was
his main constituency,'' said the former government official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The backstage role of the army, which had been Ershad's source
of power for eight years, had been a mystery. The campaign against
him was led by university students and a newly united alliance of
opposition political parties.
   Periodic campaigns to to oust Ershad were always undermined by
the rivalries within the opposition. This time the pace of dissent
was set by Dhaka University students, who defied curfews to keep up
the pressure.
   Ershad ``had become overconfident and complacent about the
military,'' said the source, particularly after his decision to
send 2,000 troops to join the U.S.-led multinational force in the
Persian Gulf.
   As late as Nov. 27 Ershad felt certain he could suppress the
public discontent by declaring a state of emergency and calling on
the army and paramilitary forces to impose order.
   But after clashing with demonstrators for two days, the military
stopped intervening. Soldiers watched passively while thousands of
people paraded in the streets of Dhaka in defiance of a curfew and
the emergency rules.
   ``Who took that decision? I don't know,'' said the former
official. ``When we asked the president about it, he said, `All
right, I'm looking into it,' and `I'll see about it.' He didn't
have the total picture of the situation.''
   By Monday, Ershad realized he had lost, the aide said. The
official said Ershad believed further resistance would destroy the
nation's feeble economy, would mean widespread killing and likely
would require imposing martial law, which he vowed in 1986 never to
do again.
   In a televised address, he caved in to opposition demands to
hand over power to a caretaker government that would supervise
elections. He said he would quit 15 days before registering
candidates, or at least 45 days before election day.
   Expecting jubilant celebrations, Ershad was stunned when the
opposition spurned his offer and insisted he quit immediately, the
former official said.
   On Tuesday, the general staff commanders informed Ershad they
would no longer support him, the source said. ``We thought they
would try to take over,'' said the source. Ershad hastily drew up
his resignation announcement, which was read on the state
television that evening.
   The former official and other sources said Ershad seemed unaware
that discontent in the military had been building. Junior officers
were unhappy with what they saw as Ershad's patronage-based
promotions and constant changes of the army command.
   The political opposition, led by Sheik Hasina and Khaleda Zia,
accused Ershad of being a military dictator, although Ershad had
resigned from the army in 1986. The officers were growing
increasingly uncomfortable with the public anger directed at them.
   Two weeks ago, a large group of officers met to discuss the
political situation, the official said. ``Dissenting views came out
for the first time. We should have read the writing on the wall.''

   Whenever Barbara Bush turns back her cuff or
presses her wrist, she may be thinking of the U.S. forces her
husband has sent to the Persian Gulf.
   That's because she wears a constant reminder - a nickel-plated
copper bracelet inscribed with the words ``Operation Desert Shield,
A Call to Freedom.''
   Mrs. Bush said she likes the bracelet because it brings her
thoughts frequently back to the troops that she and President Bush
visited in Saudi Arabia at Thanksgiving. ``It's important,'' she
said.
   ``She never takes it off,'' her press secretary, Anna Perez,
said Saturday.
   Reminiscent of the bracelets worn by Americans for years in
remembrance of those U.S. soldiers imprisoned or missing in action
from the Vietnam War, the bracelets are being sold by a McLean,
Va., couple through their non-profit foundation. Part of proceeds
help fund a phone message line for U.S. troops stationed in the
Persian Gulf.
   Business has boomed since the first lady showed off her bracelet
to reporters who traveled with the Bushes on their Persian Gulf
trip, said Fred Wyatt. Wyatt and his wife Barbara founded the group
Voices for Freedom that distributes the bracelets.
   Mrs. Bush told reporters that she would wear the bracelet until
the troops are home from the gulf. More than 250,000 U.S. military
personnel have been dispatched to stand up to Iraq's President
Saddam Hussein, and the number will soon swell to more than
400,000.
   Wyatt said Saturday that phone and mail requests for the
bracelets, at $9.95 each, have increased about threefold since Mrs.
Bush gave them a public boost.
   ``It was more than a shot in the arm,''' Wyatt said in a
telephone interview.
   He said the group has sold nearly 10,000 since it got under way
in October.
   Mrs. Bush heard about the bracelets first from her daughter,
Dorothy Bush LeBlond, who worked with Mrs. Wyatt on a National
Rehabilitation Hospital volunteer ceremony.
   Ms. LeBlond gave one to her mother and father, and Mrs. Bush
liked it so much she ordered a pair for her son Marvin Bush and his
wife Margaret, said Perez.
   The proceeds from the bracelets, which can be ordered by calling
an 800 telephone number, also support a message hotline for U.S.
troops who are unable to reach friends and relatives when they call
home.
   If a soldier gets a busy signal or no answer when calling home,
he or she can call the Voices for Freedom message center and record
a message which the phone bank then will relay by calling the
family at a time when there is someone home.
   The Wyatts' foundation contracts with a commercial phone service
in Tysons Corner, Va., to handle the 24-hour message line, Wyatt
said.
   Of the $9.95 price for the bracelet, $3.70 goes to the message
center. Each bracelet costs Voices for Freedom $2.77, and 70 cents
is for packaging and postage. The leftover funds are repaying a
$30,000 loan the Wyatts took out to launch the project.

<HEAD>Government Looking into Possible Stasi Links of Former Leader</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government said
Saturday it was investigating whether Lothar de Maiziere - East
Germany's last leader and now a member of Kohl's Cabinet - worked
for the dreaded secret police, or Stasi.
   De Maziere denied the allegation.
   Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said the decision to
investigate was made after a ``reference to a document was found on
a file card, under the cover name `Czerny,' with an address
listing'' in former East Berlin that is identical to de Maiziere's.
   The index card was discovered among documents of the Stasi, said
Vogel.
   Earlier Saturday, the news magazine Der Spiegel said it had
uncovered records indicating de Maiziere had been an ``unofficial
worker'' for the East German secret police using the cover name
``Czerny.''
   Vogel did not comment on the card's authenticity or give further
details about it.
   There is concern that files compiled by the Stasi secret police
could contain doctored-up papers that would incriminate innocent
people.
   Vogel said that ``in agreement with de Maiziere'' the Stasi
files would be examined to try to clear up the matter. De Maiziere
issued a statement denying he had worked for the Stasi.
   De Maiziere's troubles reflect one of the greatest problems
facing united Germany: how to deal with former East Germany's Stasi
legacy and with scandals that could arise during the years to come.
   The Stasi files are kept under lock and in key in former East
Germany, with public access strictly forbidden. They consist of
documents compiled by the Stasi secret service on millions of
people during four decades of Communist rule.
   The files are considered potentially explosive because of the
information they contain on the private lives of East Germans, and
because they likely reveal who worked as informers for the secret
police.
   Allegations that de Maiziere had been a Stasi informer have
surfaced at least twice before.
   De Maiziere, who became East Germany's first and only
democratically elected prime minister on March 18, pointed out
Saturday that East Germany's Parliament had examined his background
and exonerated him before that nation's dissolution and merger with
West Germany on Oct. 3.
   He said prior to East Germany's revolution last fall, when he
was an attorney, his sole contacts with the Stasi were only those
necessary for carrying out his legal work.
   De Maiziere added that he has asked Germany's interior minister,
Wolfgang Schaeuble, to ``carry out a comprehensive examination'' to
show that he is innocent.
   Der Spiegel said it has uncovered evidence that appear to show
de Maiziere began working for the Stasi in 1981. It said one
document identifies de Maiziere as being the Stasi worker
code-named ``Czerny.''
   The magazine said a former Stasi major named Edgar Hasse was
``Czerny's'' control officer. The magazine said Hasse wrote a
document saying he met with ``Czerny'' ``10 or 12 times each
year.''
   Stasi files indicate the secret police were interested in de
Maiziere because he had contacts with activists in East German
church circles and with West German government officials, said Der
Spiegel.
   Der Spiegel provided excerpts of its report to other news
organizations in advance of Monday's publication.

   The Communist Party of Soviet Georgia decided
Saturday to split from the national Communist Party and work toward
the republic's independence, according to news reports.
   In Lithuania, meanwhile, party officials who broke with the
Kremlin last year opened a congress at which they were expected to
drop the word ``Communist'' and rename themselves the Democratic
Labor Party.
   The Georgian Communists announced they were withdrawing from the
Soviet party at a party congress in Tbilisi, the republic's
capital. They adopted new party rules and elected Avtandil
Marguiania, a 45-year-old engineer, as party leader, the official
Tass news agency said.
   He replaces Givi Gumbaridze, who resigned as first secretary of
the party.
   The new rules say the party will work with the Georgian
parliament to make the republic a sovereign state, according to
Tass.
   Soviet television also reported the Georgian party's decision to
become an ``independent political party within the framework of the
constitution of the Georgian republic.''
   The TV report said the Communists would be changing the party's
name and that suggestions would be printed in the local press.
   Delegates from the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, both
autonomous regions in the republic that oppose independence,
rejected the new party rules and decided to split from the Georgian
party, Tass said.
   In October, non-Communist parties won Georgian elections on a
platform calling for independence, private ownership of land and a
capitalist economy. During campaigning, the Communist Party also
took a pro-independence stance.
   In the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, delegates of the
Independent Communist Party of Lithuania heard their leader say
that the republic must increase its economic independence from the
Soviet Union.
   Party leader Algirdas Brazauskas said he continues to follow a
``step-by-step'' process of independence, the Baltic News Agency
reported.
   ``We need evolution, not revolution,'' Brazauskas was quoted by
the independent news service as saying. ``There is no independence
without democracy and there can be no democracy without
independence.''
   Brazauskas said before the session that the party's new name
will most likely be the Democratic Labor Party.
   The Communist Party split into two distinct groups at a party
congress one year ago, with one side remaining loyal to the Kremlin
and the other being reorganized along social democratic lines.
   Brazauskas told the 550 delegates that although the party had
split, it was important for the emerging groups to maintain
relations, Tass reported.
   He also proposed that Lithuania sign a treaty of economic and
political cooperation with the Soviet government for a period of
three years that would define their relationship as sovereign
states, Tass said.
   Elsewhere in Vilnius, thousands of anti-independence
demonstrators rallied and denounced Lithuania's leaders, according
to Soviet TV and Tass.
   ``The republic is on the verge of bankruptcy,'' said Antanas
Kasparas, one of the demonstrators.
   ``Where is the good life promised by Vytautas Landsbergis and
Kazimiera Prunskiene?'' he asked, referring to the Lithuanian
president and prime minister.
   Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union in
March. Its leadership, along with that of its Baltic neighbors,
Latvia and Estonia, have said they will not sign a Union Treaty
proposed by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to preserve the
unity of the 15 Soviet republics under strong central control.

   John le Carre's spies may have come in from
the cold now that the Cold War has thawed, but he says they still
have plenty to do.
   ``For better or worse, espionage is going through a boom
season,'' the best-selling author said. ``In the past, we were
trying to consider the Russian phenomenon. Now we've got a dozen
other minds to explore.''
   Le Carre, who normally shuns such invitations, was presented
Friday with the 1990 Peggy V. Helmerich Distinguished Author Award
by the city's library trust. It carries a $10,000 honorarium and an
engraved crystal book.
   The 59-year-old writer, whose real name is David John Moore
Cornwell, is a former spy for the British foreign service. He
introduced his most famous character, George Smiley, in ``Call for
the Dead'' in 1961. He has since written 12 novels, including ``The
Spy Who Came in From The Cold.''
   The film version of ``The Russia House,'' a 1989 best seller,
opens this week. It stars Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer.

   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) - Disc jockeys looking for a high-profile,
on-air colleague have offered lame duck Gov. Kay Orr a job.
   ``One caller said `Well, the governor will be without a job,'''
said Roger Olson, a member of the morning team on KXKT-FM, a Top-40
station in Omaha.
   So after clearing it with management, the DJs sent a letter
offering her a position. The Republican governor, who lost a close
race to Democrat Ben Nelson in November, has said she wants to
remain in Nebraska rather than accept a job in Washington.
   ``Let's face it, more than 280,000 Nebraskans wanted her to stay
in office another four years,'' KXKT operations manager Mark Evans
said. ``So plenty of people like her and we think she would make a
fine addition to our morning show.''
   A spokesman for Mrs. Orr, Doug Parrott, said he didn't know what
the governor's reaction would be, adding: ``I guess the governor
would have to evaluate it with other options available, and I'm
sure she'd be flattered by the offer.''

   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Singer Julio Iglesias continued his

   Popular worldwide, Iglesias has made more than 60 albums with

   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Lee Atwater, who ran George Bush's 1988
presidential campaign, has outlined a book about his life, from
childhood to his recent religious conversion and bout with a brain
tumor.
   In between, Atwater would sprinkle anecdotes about politicians
he has helped and opposed, according to an outline dated Sept. 4.
The State newspaper obtained a copy and reported on it Friday.
   The tales would give readers a glimpse into how Atwater managed
to undermine the campaigns of political adversaries.
   ``I would create crazy situations if they weren't there,'' he
writes. ``To thrive on chaos is good. If you can create chaos, and
operate in the midst of it, you can't imagine what advantage that
gives you over your opponent.''
   The outline does not elaborate on what Atwater means about
creating ``chaos.''
   The 39-year-old South Carolina native, under treatment for a
cancerous brain tumor, has yet to sign a contract with a publisher
or hire a writer.
   Julian Bach, a New York literary agent retained by Atwater, said
negotiations are under way.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Ed Asner, best known as the gruff television
character Lou Grant, believes his political activism has hurt his
career.
   Asner said his workload is a fraction of what it was during the
1970s and early '80s, when he played the news editor on ``The Mary
Tyler Moore Show'' and its spinoff, ``Lou Grant.''
   The former president of the Screen Actors Guild, the 61-year-old
Asner cited his union activites and open criticism of U.S. policy
in El Salvador.
   The actor has had some work. He's starred as an embattled school
principal in NBC's ``The Bronx Zoo.'' And on Sunday, he's featured
in the NBC movie ``Good Cops, Bad Cops.'' Asner also has formed his
own production company.
   But the occasional role isn't good enough for someone who has
won seven Emmys and five Golden Globe awards, he said, adding:
``Hey, maybe some people think I've already had more than my share
of chances. But considering my reputation and overall ability, it
doesn't make sense.''

   A middle-aged woman stood outside the Wheeler Opera House, where
the show will be taped, scalping tickets for $100 each. The show
will be broadcast this Friday.
   In interviews with reporters, Cher said she's used to the
attention.
   ``The way I dress, the things I do and people think I do'' can
make good copy, she said. She added that being outrageous ``might
be a hindrance in my career. But it is definitely not a hindrance
in my life.''

<HEAD>Palestinians Stage A General Strike, Curfew Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinians in the occupied territories began
a two-day general strike Saturday to commemorate the Temple Mount
slayings and the third anniversary of the Palestinian uprising.
   Large sectors of the occupied West Bank, including such
principal cities as Nablus and Hebron, and most of the Gaza Strip
remained under army-imposed curfews, under which the estimated
735,000 Palestinians in the area were confined to their homes.
   The curfews were ordered on Friday to prevent possible marches
and violence over the weekend. There were no reports of either.
   Saturday was the two-month anniversary of the riot on the Temple
Mount, in which at least 17 Arabs were killed by police. Sunday is
the third anniversary of the Palestinian rebellion against Israeli
occupation.
   In the Oct. 8 riot inside the Temple Mount compound in
Jerusalem, police fired live ammunition on stone-throwing Arabs,
killing at least 17 and wounding about 140 others.
   The Temple Mount, known to Arabs as Haram es-Sharif, is the
third-holiest site in Islam. It is revered by the Jews as the site
of their ancient Temple, which was destroyed by the Romans.
   Life in the occupied territories came to a standstill Saturday
at the onset of the general strike, called by the PLO-linked
Unified National Leadership of the Uprising and the fundamentalist
Moslem Hamas movement.
   Shops were shut and no vehicles, apart from army cars, were seen
on the West Bank roads. In Ramallah, a town declared a ``closed
military area'' by the army, the only sign of life was some
children playing soccer in the street.
   Increased police and paramilitary border police forces patrolled
annexed east Jerusalem. Arab passers-by were stopped and searched,
witnesses said.
   Before dawn Saturday, unidentified assailants, presumably Arabs,
fired several shots at a border police patrol in the east Jerusalem
Arab neighborhood of Shuafat. There were no injuries, Jerusalem
police spokesman Aharon Elchayani said.
   Also Saturday, hundreds of Israelis from the left-wing Peace Now
movement gathered in front of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
residence in downtown Jerusalem to mark the uprising anniversary.
They carried burning torches and placards commemorating violent
events of the revolt.
   In large newspaper ads published Friday, the movement demanded a
``political separation from the territories'' captured by Israel in
the 1967 Middle East war and said the time had come to ``put an end
to the circle of bloodshed.''
   ``The prime minister has to understand ... that the Israeli
public shall not comply with this, that it demands an action, a
dialogue, an end to this endless circle of bloodshed,'' Tzali
Reshef, a Peace Now leader, said on Israel Television.
   At least 776 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians since the uprising began on Dec. 9, 1987. An
additional 316 Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs on
suspicion of collaborating with Israelis. Fifty-three Israelis and
four foreigners also have died in the violence.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Jesuit Case to Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Salvadoran judge on Saturday
ordered eight soldiers to stand trial for the murder of six Jesuit
priests, their housekeeper and her daughter.
   Court spokesman Mario Gonzalez said Judge Ricardo Zamora ruled
that Col. Guillermo Benavides, three lieutenants and four soldiers
will be tried on eight counts of murder as well as charges of
terrorism.
   He said Zamora dropped burglary charges.
   Zamora closed his investigation on Friday, a step that judiciary
sources say diminishes the chances of anyone else being implicated
in the massacre.
   The Society of Jesus, the local Roman Catholic Church leadership
and members of the U.S. Congress who have been monitoring the
investigation contend that Benavides is not the only ranking
officer behind the killings.
   Congressman Joe Moakley, D-Mass., has accused members of the
Salvadoran army high command of obstructing the investigation,
covering up evidence and lying in testimony before Zamora.
   Zamora spent more than a year investigating, and court sources
said it is unlikely - but not impossible - that anyone else will be
charged.
   Several defendants testified that a 40-man unit raided the
priests' residence on the campus of the University of Central
America before dawn on Nov. 16, 1989. The soldiers murdered the six
priest-professors, as well as their housekeeper and her 15-year-old
daughter, according to testimony.
   Two of the lieutenants accused in the case have testified that
Benavides ordered the murders and the elimination of any witnesses.
Benavides denies the charges.
   El Salvador's radical right wing, including many army officers,
had long considered the Jesuits allies of leftist guerrillas waging
an 11-year-old war against a succession of U.S.-backed governments.
   The priests maintained the civil war stemmed from injustice,
official repression and widespread misery rather than international
communist expansion. This viewpoint, as well as their support for a
negotiated settlement to the conflict, earned them the virulent
enmity of rightists.
   Both the prosecution and the defense have the right to appeal
Zamora's ruling that the investigation is complete and his decision
to bring the case to trial.
   Sources say the defense is expected to appeal, a process that is
expected to take about three months.
   If the case goes to trial, a five-person jury will review
transcripts of testimony the judge gathered in his investigation
and return a verdict.
   Juries in El Salvador do not hear testimony directly from
witnesses and their reviews generally last only a few days. The
judge imposes sentence.
   Murder is punishable by a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison
and terrorism by up to 10 years in prison.
   No Salvadoran officer has ever been convicted of a human rights
crime.

<TEXT>
   A few days after a runway crash that killed
eight people, Northwest Airlines officials - and industry observers
- bemoaned what they called a bad luck streak for a carrier with an
otherwise good safety record.
   Northwest earned the nickname ``Northworst'' during a 1987-1988
epidemic of lost baggage and late flights at the nation's
fourth-largest airline.
   And Monday's crash on a foggy runway in Detroit came just three
years after 156 people died when a Northwest MD-80 crashed after
taking off from the same airport.
   The two were the only fatal accidents in 27 years at the
Eagan-based carrier, said Christy Clapp, Northwest spokeswoman.
   Aside from the crashes, the airline has had a spate of
performance and labor problems, including the conviction of three
pilots for flying while intoxicated.
   ``I think they've had an awful lot of problems, but I think you
would be hard pressed to find a carrier without them right now,''
Mike Hamilton, a Minneapolis-based airline analyst, said. ``I don't
think their plagues have been any worse than any of the other major
airlines.''
   Ivar Siqveland, a partner at Bloomington-based Travel
Professionals, said it's been months since he's heard a negative
comment about Northwest from agents in his company's seven travel
offices.
   Clapp said Northwest officials had expected a downturn in
reservations following Monday's crash, but reservation rates were
normal throughout the week.
   Travel agents were overwhelmed with customer complaints in late
1987 and early 1988 when former Republic Airlines employees were
stewing over pay disparities that lingered from Northwest's 1986
takeover of Republic.
   The labor strife coincided with performance problems that peaked
in January 1988 when a whopping 40 percent of Northwest flights
were late. In December 1987, nearly 12 of every 1,000 passengers
filed baggage loss complaints.
   ``Boy, what an ugly time,'' Clapp said.
   Siqveland said there has been noticeable improvement in service
and employee morale at Northwest since Los Angeles investor Al
Checchi led a $3.65 billion buyout in August 1989. Checchi took
over just after the airline made peace with its unions and made
service a top priority.
   In the latest U.S. Transportation Department rankings, Northwest
was third among 12 U.S. carriers tracked by the agency for on-time
performance. Northwest flights were on time 85.5 percent of the
time and it had fewer than two baggage complaints for every 1,000
customers.
   ``They've had some bad deals lately, there's no doubt about
it,'' Siqveland said. ``But I think the feeling still is that they
are doing a good job.''
   The latest spate of problems began Dec. 28, 1989, when Northwest
publicized a bomb threat it received for a Dec. 30 flight from
Paris to Detroit. More than 100 people canceled their reservations;
28 passengers and 14 crew made the trip.
   On Jan. 4, an engine fell off a three-engine Northwest plane
flying from Miami to Minneapolis. The plane landed safely in Tampa,
Fla. Regulators blamed improper maintenance and proposed a $200,000
fine.
   On March 8, three Northwest pilots were arrested after safely
landing a Boeing 727 in the Twin Cities on a flight from Fargo,
N.D. A tipster had complained that they were drinking heavily the
night before. The three were fired, stripped of their licenses and
became the first commercial pilots convicted for flying a jetliner
while intoxicated. Their sentences ranged from one year to 16
months.
   In October, the company reported that ground workers in Atlanta
accidentally filled the hydraulic systems of two DC-9 jets with a
mixture of hand soap and hydraulic fluid. Fifty flights were
canceled and 12 planes were grounded for inspections.
   On Nov. 17, a newspaper reported that the Federal Aviation
Administration ordered Northwest to examine 11 of its Airbus A320
planes for possible safety defects.
   The FAA warned that an instrument critical to controlling the
plane has jammed at least six times on A320s operated by foreign
carriers and in test flights.
   Most recently, an auxiliary generator on a Northwest plane
ignited Wednesday as the plane landed in Detroit. The fire was
extinguished and there were no injuries. And that same dat, a New
York-bound Northwest plane made an emergency landing at Newark,
N.J., airport after running low on fuel.
   ``For the past several months the spotlight or the microscope
has been on Northwest,'' Clapp said. ``We don't think that we have
had any more severe or any more numbers of problems than any other
large airline.''
   Professor Arnold Barnett, a statistician at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology who studies air travel, said Northwest has
an excellent safety record despite its well-publicized problems.
   ``The correlation between the kind of press you get and the
overall level of safety may be a very weak correlation,'' Barnett
said.
   ``Northwest had gone decades without any accidents. Its
aggregate safety record is absolutely excellent,'' Barnett said.
``The only fatal accidents are the two that are right on your mind
now.''

<HEAD>EPA Marks Two Decades; Ruckelshaus Recalls Learning How Complex
Problem Is</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVE EPSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the Environmental Protection Agency was
formed on Dec. 2, 1970, phenomena like acid raid, global warming
and ozone depletion meant nothing to most Americans.
   Today, they're a familiar and grim lexicon of the kind of
environmental problems the agency was established to address.
   ``The environment then was a different kind of issue than it is
today,'' said William Ruckelshaus, the first EPA administrator, now
the chief executive officer of Browning Ferris Industries.
   Since 1970, the agency, which originally faced slow-building
problems like smog and dirty rivers, has had to deal with a host of
environmental catastrophes like the Exxon Valdez oil spill in
Alaska's Prince William Sound.
   Ruckelshaus said his vision of the agency's ability to clean
pollution changed quickly once he realized how expensive it could
be.
   ``I wasn't there very long before I realized this was a much
more complicated problem than I had originally thought,'' he said.
   Other notable environmental disasters the agency faced were the
1979 accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in
Pennsylvania and industrial chemical contamination of the Love
Canal area of Niagara Falls, N.Y.
   One of Ruckelshaus' early decisions was to phase out domestic
use of DDT, a pesticide Rachel Carson warned about in her 1962 book
``Silent Spring,'' which was found to work its way through the food
chain, posing a threat to humans.
   Also under Ruckelshaus, the agency reauthorized the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act and strengthened the Clean Air Act,
which forced automobile manufcturers to meet certain emissions
standards.
   Ruckelshaus left the agency in 1973 and returned a decade later,
after the scandal involving former EPA head Anne Burford, who was
cited for contempt of Congress in 1982 for refusing to turn over
agency records.
   The 20 years of the EPA have seen public awareness and concern
about the environment increase dramatically.
   ``Earth Day 1970 was a major milestone in awakening American
consciousness and it's been on the rise ever since,'' said Michael
Deland, chairman of the President's Council on Environmental
Quality in Washington.
   Environmentalists give the EPA mixed reviews.
   Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate and environmental activist,
said the EPA hasn't performed up to its potential but has made some
progress in cleaning up water pollution and in reducing lead in the
environment.
   ``By and large, it has good equipment, but it hasn't used it
because it's been straitjacketed,'' Nader said. ``It has a good
deal of authority to do things, but it's been corporatized by a
corporate-endentured government.''
   Barry Commoner, social activist and author of the new book
``Making Peace with the Planet,'' was more critical.
   ``If the criterion is the improvement of the environment, they
get low marks, because the improvement has been very
disappointing,'' Commoner said.
   Deland said the EPA's next step should be to find ways to
dispose of waste permanently.
   ``EPA was in the business of moving pollution around from one
medium to another,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Japanese television
company that paid $12 million to send a reporter on a Soviet space
mission will think long and hard before another venture with the
Soviets, a company official says.
   ``My advice: Don't do business with the Soviets for 10 years,''
said Ichiro Sasaki, an executive producer at the Tokyo Broadcasting
System.
   It was Sasaki's idea to send journalist Toyohiro Akiyama into
space, and he helped organize the project.
   Now, even before the mission ends, he is disillusioned.
   ``Their space development is advanced, but their business is
not,'' he said in an interview last week.
   The Soviets have been trying for two years to commercialize
their space program. The space agency Glavkosmos has signed
commercial agreements for space flights with Austria, Britain,
Germany and France, and more are in the works with China, Iran and
Spain.
   Sasaki said the Soviet space industry itself is dependable and
even could be profitable for foreign investors.
   But he complained about a disorganized array of companies and
agencies that often make conflicting demands.
   For example, the company's initial contract with space agency
Glavkosmos, for example, said Akiyama would ``cooperate'' on the
eight-day mission with the two Soviet cosmonauts, flight commander
Victor Afanasyev and engineer Musa Manarov.
   The Japanese company understood its initial payment would cover
the estimated 12 hours of help from the cosmonauts, Sasaki said.
   But in the weeks leading up to liftoff, officials of Energia,
the company that builds rockets and negotiates on behalf of the
cosmonauts, said TBS must pay an additional $100,000 per hour for
the services of Manarov and Afanasyev while in orbit, Sasaki said.
   The help could be anything from holding a camera for Akiyama's
live broadcasts to feeding his experimental Japanese tree frogs.
   A high-level Soviet government committee sided with the
Japanese, but Energia was still insisting on payment, Sasaki said.
   The two sides agreed that five hours of cooperation would be
covered under the contract and cost of the remaining time would be
figured later. But whether or not the company will eventually be
billed for more isn't settled.
   ``We're not intending to pay anything,'' Sasaki said.
   Despite the dispute, Sasaki said his company was less upset by
the extra charges than by the surprises and conflicts that arose
after the contract was signed more than a year ago.
   ``This is their (space officials) first attempt at business with
a foreigner, but they're still using a Soviet way of business,''
Sasaki said.
   The mission is to end Monday.

   Players in a church Christmas pageant
had to interrupt a dress rehearsal to search for a veteran cast
member who wandered away with an unexpected bout of stage fright.
   Jerry, a mule who has appeared in the North Heights Lutheran
Church's production of ``The King'' for the past two years, somehow
got untied and walked away from the church during the Thursday
rehearsal.
   ``He's normally a pretty cool animal,'' said Roger Carlson, who
owns the 19-year-old mule. ``He was just scared.''
   Jerry, led by Joseph, was to carry the Virgin Mary into the
church and to the manger during the production.
   Carlson and other church members searched with sheriff's
deputies for 12 hours before tracking down the animal.
   ``I sighted him three times,'' said Sheriff's Deputy Edward
Whitledge. ``That mule goes 40 miles an hour. And he's street
wise.''
   Carlson said Jerry was accustomed to streets and traffic because
he had pulled a covered wagon in the town's annual Courage Wagon
Train.
   Once he was caught, Carlson said he took Jerry home for a bath,
food and rest before Friday's performance. Jerry also was scheduled
to appear in performances Saturday and Sunday.
   Carlson said he didn't expect any more problems.
   ``I'm sure he'll be great once he gets into church,'' Carlson
said. ``I know he enjoys it.''

<HEAD>U.S. Evacuates 400 Libyans From Chad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>N'DJAMENA, Chad (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States on Saturday evacuated
about 400 former Libyan prisoners of war from Chad in what it
called an international humanitarian effort. Libya called the move
``piracy.''
   Ambassador Richard Bogosian refused to comment on allegations
the POWs had been trained by the United States for commando
operations to destabilize the regime of Libya's Col. Moammar
Gadhafi.
   The evacuation, the second in two days, incured the wrath of
Libya, which called it an ``international act of piracy'' and
demanded an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council.
   Bogosian confirmed that about 200 former POWs had been evacuated
on Friday in addition to the 400 who were airlifted out on
Saturday.
   Chad's interim president, Idriss Deby, said the decision to
evacuate Libyans wanting to leave was made ``in all sovereignty.''
   Deby toppled pro-Western President Hissene Habre a week ago
after his guerrillas, armed in part by Libya, overcame the
government forces in a three-week offensive.
   The French news agency, Agence France-Presse, whose
correspondent witnessed Friday's evacuation, quoted an American
military source as saying the Libyans were being flown to Nigeria,
then a third country.
   The ambassador refused to specify the Libyans' destination,
saying details were not finalized.
   He said he did not believe there would be further evacuations.
   ``When the new government came in last week ... they in effect
allowed these people to leave if they wished,'' Bogosian said in a
telephone interview.
   He referred to the departing Libyans as refugees, saying they
had been disarmed. He would not elaborate.
   Chad captured about 2,000 Libyan soldiers in fighting in 1983
and the spring of 1987. By the summer of 1987, about 700 of them
agreed to help maintain captured Libyan weaponry. They gradually
were turned over to American military advisers for tutoring in
commando and terrorist operations against Libya, AFP reported,
quoting an American military source.
   Deby's decision to allow captured Libyans to go was part of a
reconciliation effort with Libya, Chad's northern neighbor, with
which this poor and landlocked nation has had differences for 25
years.
   ``We inherited this situation,'' Deby told a news conference.
``We don't want to have problems with our neighbors .... We've
given these people a choice, either put down their arms and demand
refugee status, and they would be welcome, or leave.''
   The Libyan Foreign Ministry charged in a communique that the
United States seized the 200 Libyan POWs in Chad ``against their
will.'' It called the move an ``international act of piracy''
equivalent to ``state-sponsored terrorism.'
   Libya ``demands an emergency session of the (U.N.) Security
Council to discuss the piracy act pursued by the U.S.''
   Libya's official JANA news agency claimed that 17 ex-prisoners
of war were executed for refusing ``to obey America's orders'' to
leave Chad.
   JANA, monitored in Rome, said that Libyan Foreign Minister
Ibrahim Muhammed al-Bishari left Tripoli Saturday for Lagos,
Nigeria, in an effort to get the Libyan ``hostages'' back.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Mark Krischik described the evacuation as
a humanitarian gesture with international backing, but refused to
elaborate on involvement by other countries.
   ``We provided the transportation. That's essentially what we
did,'' said the U.S. ambassador. He said Chad's new government had
been consulted and the Red Cross was present and ``had an
opportunity to find out if any of these people didn't want to go.''
   Some former Libyan POWs opted to return to their homeland, a few
asked to remain in Chad and the rest wanted to leave, Bogosian
said.
   Libya's ambassador to France, Saad Mujber, said about 450
Libyans had taken refuge at the Libyan Embassy in N'Djamena. He
denied that those who left were part of an opposition force.

<HEAD>Buthelezi Blames Past Armed Struggle for Continuing Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM COHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zulu leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi on Saturday called the country's continuing violence the
``heritage'' of armed struggle waged against the white-led
government by rival opposition groups.
   Nine people died in scattered violence in the previous 24 hours,
police said, including a policeman shot to death while chasing
suspected car thieves in the black township of Soweto.
   The chronic unrest, mostly clashes between black factions, has
killed about 1,000 people in black townships near Johannesburg
since it broke out Aug. 12.
   It spread to the Johannesburg area from eastern Natal Province,
where more than 5,000 people have died in five years of virtual
warfare between supporters of Buthelezi's Zulu-based Inkatha
Freedom Party and the African National Congress.
   Inkatha has traditionally been more conservative than the ANC
and other opposition groups. It opposed the ANC's armed struggle,
which was suspended in August as a concession to peace talks with
the white-led government.
   The ANC and other groups said the armed struggle, protests and
other forms of mass action were the only political weapons blacks
had under the apartheid system of racial segregation and white
dominance.
   Winnie Mandela, wife of ANC leader Nelson Mandela, told a rally
Saturday the ANC would resume its armed struggle if pushed too far
by the government. Black leaders have accused security forces of
using excessive force against black demonstrators.
   ``If the government continues to shoot our people, we'll shoot
back,'' she told about 3,000 people in the black township of
Alexandra.
   In a speech to about 6,000 delegates at an Inkatha party
congress, Buthelezi said the armed struggle created an environment
of violence for blacks.
   ``The killings now taking place in South Africa were a heritage
of parties which declared an armed struggle, ... called for a
people's war and called for the country to be made ungovernable,''
he said.
   Inkatha will work for a multiparty democracy in South Africa to
prevent any single group, black or white, from gaining dictatorial
control, Buthelezi said.
   Inkatha and the ANC both oppose apartheid, the system of racial
separation, but differ on the leadership and policies of a future
South Africa. Inkatha favors a free-market economy and promotes
tribalism, while the ANC advocates more leftist and pan-tribal
policies.
   Both Buthelezi and Mandela have called for peace in the
townships, but their supporters have continued skirmishing.
Buthelezi has repeatedly called for a one-on-one meeting with
Mandela, saying they are the only two leaders with the power to end
the fighting.
   The ANC has refused to meet with Buthelezi, contending he
instigated the violence to broaden his power base from Natal, the
traditional Zulu homeland. The Inkatha congress on Saturday
reaffirmed Buthelezi as the party's leader.
   President F.W. de Klerk has promised to end apartheid and
negotiate power-sharing with the black majority. The government and
ANC have held talks since May aimed at setting up formal
negotiations on a new constitution.
   A police unrest report for the previous 24 hours provided few
details of incidents near Johannesburg, Cape Town and in Natal that
killed nine people.
   It said three bodies were found in the Bekkersdal township
southwest of Johannesburg, raising to eight the number of people
killed there since Wednesday. There was no indication of who killed
the victims.
   Police shot one man to death and wounded another when fired on
by a group of people in Natal, the report said.
   Another man was shot to death by an unidentified gunman in
Natal, and a stabbed and shot body was found near Cape Town, the
police report said. No details of the killings were provided.
   Two hacked and stabbed bodies were found in the Daveyton
township east of Johannesburg, the report said.
   Police Capt. Ruben Bloomberg told the independent South African
Press Association that officers stopped a suspected stolen car in
Soweto early Saturday and gave chase when the occupants fled. One

<HEAD>Anti-Discrimination Groups Call for Japanese Minister's Ouster</HEAD>

   A coalition of groups representing minorities
called Saturday for the ouster of Justice Minister Seiroku
Kajiyama, who came under fire earlier this year for a remark that
offended many blacks in Japan and abroad.
   The groups also called for measures to fight discrimination.
   The coalition, comprised of groups with a total membership of
more than 200,000, called for the justice minister's dismissal as
supporters demonstrated in downtown Tokyo.
   Kajiyama came under criticism in September after likening
American blacks to prostitutes, who he said were spoiling a Tokyo
neighborhood. ``It's like in America when neighborhoods become
mixed because blacks move in and whites are forced out,'' he said
then.
   Several groups in Japan that called for Kajiyama's ouster
decided they would be more effective if they worked together on
that and other issues, said J.R. Dash, president of the Japan
Afro-American Friendship Association.
   The coalition includes minority Koreans, the indigenous Ainu
group, the lower-class Japanese known as ``village people,''
Africans and Americans.
   The coalition said it is calling for educational programs in
Japan to ``correct the pervasive stereotypes of some Japanese
people regarding the history and achievements of Africans and all
peoples of African descent.''
   It is asking for laws to protect women and for the dismantling
of legal and social structures that discriminate against minorities
in Japan.
   The coalition also is protesting the import of women, mostly
from Southeast Asia, to serve in Japan's thriving sex trade.
   About 30 members of the coalition camped Saturday night under a
patch of trees in a small park in glittery Ginza, one of Tokyo's
main shopping districts.
   Police had not granted a permit for the demonstration but
generally appeared to be leaving the group alone, said Gretchen
Cook, a Columbia, Md. woman who is researching Japanese perceptions
of blacks.
   Most of the thousands of holiday shoppers streaming through the
area seemed unaware of the demonstration, even when a Japanese
parliamentarian stood with protesters.
   ``Through activities like this, we can raise the consciousness
of people in Japan that other people are human too,'' said Ikuo
Aoki, a central executive committee member of the Buraku Liberation
League, a coalition of ``village people'' groups.
   The ``village people,'' or burakumin in Japanese, are Japan's
largest minority group and are estimated to number about 3 million.
Physically indistinguishable from other Japanese, they were
associated in the past with ``unclean'' jobs such as leather
working and undertaking, and continue to suffer discrimination.
   Koreans, the largest foreign minority, are treated as aliens,
although many were born and raised in Japan. Most came or are
descended from people who were brought to Japan during the 35 years
that Korea was a Japanese colony.

   A car bomb exploded Saturday, killing at
least six police officers riding by on their way to a soccer game,
police said. Basque separatists were suspected in Spain's deadliest
attack in three years.
   At least eight people, including two policemen, were injured in
the blast in the industrial town 12 miles north of Barcelona, said
police spokeswoman Maria Luisa Pena.
   There were no claims of responsibility for the bombing, the
deadliest in Spain since a December 1987 attack outside a Civil
Guard barracks in Zaragoza that killed 11 people.
   But police said it appeared to be the work of ETA, the Basque
separatist organization that has claimed responsibility for 18
killings so far this year.
   A Sabadell policeman said a booby-trapped car blew up about
1,500 feet from a police station, just as the van was riding by.
   The police were on their way to handle security at a
second-division soccer match in the Nova Creu Alta stadium. Some of
the soccer playoffs in the Barcelona Summer Olympic games in 1992
are to be played in the stadium.
   The match between Sabadell and Malaga went ahead as scheduled
with a minute of silence for the victims before play began.
   Spanish police said four suspected ETA members who were arrested
in southern France on Nov. 17 were carrying papers and documents
indicating the group planned to set up operations in Barcelona to
attack Olympic targets.
   Last week, specialists from more than 20 countries met in
Barcelona to discuss security at the games.
   ETA, an acronym which stands for homeland and liberty in the
Basque language, seeks independence for the three-province northern
Spanish Basque country. Since 1968 it has claimed more than 650
lives to secure this goal.

<HEAD>Nigerian Turnout is Scarce for Local Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voting was light and some polling stations
were even empty Saturday in Nigeria's first elections in more than
a decade, a prelude to the military's carefully orchestrated plans
to return civilian rule by 1992.
   The small turnout was blamed on lack of interest in the two
government-created parties in the local council races. Other
Nigerians feared violence under a controversial voting procedure
that did not allow secret ballots.
   Excessive security could also have kept voters away. About
80,000 police were deployed around the large West African nation,
and soldiers manned roadblocks to stop people from leaving their
neighborhoods. All vehicles except those of government officers on
essential business were barred from the streets.
   A total of 12,056 candidates were running for 5,572 councilors'
seats and 453 council chairmanships.
   Balloting ended peacefully in Lagos, capital of this powerful
oil-rich country with Africa's biggest population of more than 100
million people
   Voters were required to line up behind the candidate - or a
poster of the candidate - to register their vote. They were counted
at noon.
   Many Nigerians complained that lining up left them open to
intimidation and cast doubt on the fairness of the elections.
   About 42,000 polling stations were designed to each accommodate
200 to 500 voters.
   But some polling booths attracted no voters at all. At one
station in the Lagos suburb of Pedro, only 21 of the 499 registered
voters turned out.
   Results were expected Sunday.
   Last month, the government banned political rallies in Lagos
because of violent intra-party rivalries.
   Nigeria's president, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, had said any
disruption in Saturday's voting could force his government to delay
handing over civil rule on Oct. 1, 1992.
   Electoral commission spokesman Tonnie Iredia said the ``very
peaceful polling seems to have vindicated our resolve to adopt the
open ballot system.''
   Most election candidates were private businessmen and
middle-level executives with university degrees.
   The military banned established politicians from contesting,
saying they were tainted by corruption that caused two previous
civilian governments to fall.
   The last elections, in 1979, brought in civilian President Shehu
Shagari. He was overthrown in 1983 by Maj. Gen. Muhammadu Buhari,
who in turn was ousted by Babangida on Aug. 27, 1985.
   Babangida is the sixth military ruler since Nigeria's
independence from Britain in 1960. He has survived three coup
attempts and narrowly escaped death on April 22, when mutinous
soldiers shelled his barracks residence.
   The general astonished the nation last year by banning 13
independent groups wishing to contest the 1992 elections. Instead,
the government created the right-leaning National Republican
Convention and left-of-center Social Democratic Party.
   Babangida said the banned organizations were organized on tribal
and religious lines. Leaders of the April coup sought to end
political domination by Moslem northerners.
   Critics say the government-sanctioned parties reproduced
longstanding differences, with Republicans attracting mainly Moslem
northerners, and Christians and followers of traditional religions
in the oil-rich south joining the Social Democrats.

<HEAD>Light Fixture Repaired Before Image Appeared</HEAD>

   The church where a shimmering image has
appeared that some believe represents the Virgin Mary had its
hanging light fixtures repaired a day before the image first
appeared, officials said.
   The image, which appears for about one hour each day, has
attracted thousands of visitors to St. Dominic's Church.
   The newly disclosed information about the light fixtures
supports a theory put forward Thursday by Physics Professor James
Phelps that the image is a natural reflection of sunlight bouncing
off a light fixture onto the wall. Phelps is an optics expert from
California State University at Sacramento.
   ``It might explain it,'' said parishioner Edmund ``Mick''
Molloy, whose father, Ed, is the church administrator.
   But the explanation failed to keep more than 2,000 people from
crowding into the church again Saturday.
   The crowds were peaceful, as they have been every day, and
brought welcome business to local restaurants and filling stations.
   ``I hope it goes on for a long time,'' said Teri Simons, who
owns a coffee shop near the church in the town of 1,000, situated
45 miles northeast of Sacramento.
   Parishioner Freda Hoffman, who answered the telephone at the
church Saturday, refused to discuss explanations.
   ``I honestly can't tell you at all about it because they're
trying to make it a hoax,'' she said. ``We believe it is the Virgin
Mary. We believe in it because we are Catholics.''
   The curved image in soft shades of blue, green and pink appeared
again Saturday on the wall over the shoulder of a statue of Jesus,
as it has every day since Thanksgiving.
   Molloy said that one of the fixtures fell to the church floor,
apparently vibrated loose by overhead heating ducts.
   ``I don't know if the one that came zinging down was the one
closest to the vision,'' Molloy said. ``But I do know all of them
were fixed up the same way. They put wire around the outside of the
glass covers and other pieces of metal, various and sundry stuff.''
   Molloy said the work was done the day before Thanksgiving.
   Bishop Francis Quinn of Sacramento said Friday he welcomed
Phelps' theory, but had no plans to test it.
   ``Actually I don't think we will have any kind of official
commission until after Christmas, if it is needed at all,'' Quinn
said. ``It is not customary for the church in the first fervor to
come to a quick resolution.''
   Quinn said he does not like to interrupt the ``genuine fervor of
the people. People are the church, as well as bishops and clergy
and religious sisters.''

   Iraq has rejected the U.S.-proposed dates
for Secretary of State James A. Baker III's trip to Baghdad for
talks with Saddam Hussein, the official Iraqi News Agency said
Saturday.
   The State Department suggested Dec. 20, Dec. 21, Dec. 22 or Jan.
3 for the Baker trip. Iraq proposed Jan. 12, the news agency said.
   A Jan. 12 date would come only three days before the deadline
set down in a U.N. resolution demanding an Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait. The Security Council measure authorizes use of ``all
necessary means'' to dislodge Iraq after that.
   The State Department has not disclosed any proposed dates for
the trip to Washington by Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz. The
Iraqi News Agency said Baghdad had proposed Dec. 17.
   The Foreign Ministry said it had informed the American charge
d'affaires in Baghdad, Joseph Wilson, of its proposal.
   In Washington, an official said the dates for the visits were
still under discussion with Iraq. The official said Wilson had
discussed some possibilities with Iraqi foreign ministry officials
on Saturday.
   The meetings were proposed by President Bush in a surprise
diplomatic initiative last week.
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft said he believes
Saddam prefers the talks to occur as close as possible to the Jan.
15 U.N. deadline.
   ``This is just another ploy that he's trying to use to drag
things out and to avoid serious - seriously facing up to what the
world community is demanding that he do,'' Scowcroft said in an
interview on CNN.
   The Iraqi news agency said it ``learned that the American side
proposed other dates for the two meetings that were found not
suitable for the Iraqi side.'' It did not say what dates had been
proposed by the United States for the Aziz visit.
   The Foreign Ministery declared its ``real desire for dialogue
and exchange of opinion in a comprehensive, serious and thorough
manner,'' said the news agency, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   The ministry added that ``concern must be centered on seeking
understanding as an alternative for the language of threat,'' the
report said.
   It said the Foreign Ministry repeated Iraq's position that an
overall approach to Middle East problems was needed, particularly
the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Bush has insisted that there be no linkage of the gulf crisis
and other Middle East issues. Bush has said he would tell Aziz -
and Baker would tell Saddam - that Iraq must leave Kuwait without
conditions.
   The Iraqi news agency quoted the Iraqi ministry as saying Iraq
would emphasize its ``national rights, including its rights in ...
Kuwait.''
   Iraq declared Kuwait its 19th province after it annexed the
emirate it invaded on Aug. 2.
   Iraqi authorities announced in a Saturday broadcast the public
should ``renew vigilance'' for the possible threat from the
multinational force in the gulf.
   Posters warning the population not to panic in case of attack
appeared on walls of buildings in downtown Baghdad.
   The news agency reported that Saddam presided over a meeting of
the general command of the armed forces on Saturday.
   It said the meeting was attended by Defense Minister Gen.
Abdul-jabbar Shanshal, and Hussein Kamel, minister of industry and
military industrialization. But it gave no other details.

<HEAD>Judge Bars Activists From Disruptive Behavior in Church</HEAD>

   A judge barred AIDS and abortion rights
activists from disrupting services at St. Patrick's Cathedral on
the anniversary of a protest that led to 43 arrests inside the
church last year.
   At the New York Archdiocese's request, state Supreme Court Judge
Harold Baer Jr. issued the temporary restraining order Friday
against the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power and the Women's Health
Action Mobilization.
   The judge's order permits the activists to enter the church
Sunday, but prohibits them from yelling, screaming, lying between
the aisles, throwing objects, handcuffing themselves to pews or
other fixtures, or throwing, dropping or spitting on the communion
wafer.
   The activists contend that Cardinal John J. O'Connor and the
archdiocese are obstructing the dissemination of information about
safe sex and are advocating ``hatred and violence'' against
homosexuals and abortion rights supporters.
   ``Illegal meddling in public health policies (is) resulting in
spreading AIDS and killing thousands of people,'' the groups said
in a joint statement.
   Shraga Lev, a spokeswoman for the activists, said the judge's
order would not affect plans for demonstrations outside the church.
   The groups had planned ``forms of disobedience, religious
dissension and personal prayers of protest'' during the 10:15 a.m.
Mass.
   During the Dec. 10, 1989, demonstration, protesters disrupted
O'Connor's homily by chanting, lying down in the aisles and
chaining themselves to pews.
   Some 4,500 protesters clogged Fifth Avenue and Rockefeller
Center, already thronged with holiday crowds.
   Forty-three people were arrested inside the church and nearly 70
outside, in what a church spokesman said was believed to be the
largest protest ever staged at the cathedral. Six were convicted of
criminal trespass, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and other
offenses. They will be sentenced in January.
   Lori Cohen, a lawyer for the activists, said last year's protest
was a form of worship and that her clients ``have a right to
worship in their own manner.''
   Monsignor Anthony Della Villa, St. Patrick's rector, recalled
that during last year's protest ``the demonstrators called O'Connor
a murderer, tossed condoms around the cathedral at other
worshipers.''
   ``They threw or spat consecrated communion wafers to the floor
of the cathedral ... It would be difficult to imagine a more
offensive act than the desecration of the sacred host,'' he said.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Haitians have been shaken by an
attack at a campaign rally that killed seven people, but officials
say the violence will not derail attempts to hold the nation's
first free presidential vote.
   ``The three key elements in the process - the Electoral Council,
the army and the people - are determined to go ahead and make a
success of these elections,'' said Ismael Diallo of Burkina Faso,
spokesman for the U.N. Election Verification Mission. The sentiment
has been echoed by the candidates and election officials.
   More than 400 international observers, including former
President Jimmy Carter, have agreed to monitor the balloting on
Dec. 16.
   Nevertheless, Wednesday's attack, in which assailants i a jeep
hurled a grenade and sprayed bullets on thousands of supporters of
the leftist Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has caused outrage and
heightened fears of further election violence.
   In addition to the seven killed, more than 50 were wounded,
including a 14-year-old girl who had her legs and a hand amputated.
   Haiti's last attempt to hold free and fair elections, on Nov.
29, 1987, dissolved in a bloodbath. Thugs shot and hacked to death
at least 34 people at polling stations and in the streets.
Elections in January 1988 were controlled by the army.
   This impoverished Caribbean nation of 6 million people has been
ruled by tyrants virtually since independence from France in 1804.
The fall of dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier in February 1986 opened
the way for democracy, but instead there have been five different
governments, four of them run or controlled by the army.
   The latest military ruler, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, fled into
exile in March after widespread demonstrations, and Supreme Court
Judge Ertha Pascal-Trouillot was appointed provisional president to
lead the country to democratic elections.
   The government set up a military commission to investigate last
week's attack, banned street demonstrations and closed schools
early for the Christmas holidays.
   But the danger, some Haitians fear, is that the notoriously
ill-disciplined and corrupt army will fail to pursue the
perpetrators of the violence, provoking street protests while
emboldening the terrorists to make further attempts to scare voters
away from the polls.
   ``Unless the army takes immediate measures to bring these guys
in, you can't stop the people from taking to the streets,'' said
Jean-Claude Roy, a center-left politician.
   ``If these Macoutes are not arrested, they'll think they have a
free hand and do worse again,'' he said, referring to remnants of
the outlawed Tonton Macoute militia that enforced the 29-year
dictatorship of Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier and son Jean-Claude,
known as ``Baby Doc.''
   Aristide accused Dr. Roger Lafontant, a reputed former head of
the Tonton Macoute, of masterminding the attack. Lafontant, who
returned from exile in the neighboring Dominican Republic to
contest the election but was disqualified on a technicality, denied
the charge.
   The bloodshed was not wholly unexpected because of the priest's
strident opposition to Haiti's previous repressive regimes. But it
shattered a calm that had prevailed throughout the election
campaign.
   In contrast to 1987, when hundreds died over several months in a
terror campaign orchstrated by hard-line Duvalierists, not one
election-related death had been recorded since voter registration
opened in October.
   Among the 11 presidential candidates, the charismatic Aristide,
37, is widely regarded as the front-runner.
   Expelled from his ecclesiastical order in 1988 for allegedly
fomenting revolution, Aristide has a huge following among the urban
poor. But rural support for his National Front for Change and
Democracy may not be as great.
   An opinion poll carried out in late November by independent
Radio Metropole and a local polling firm indicated Aristide would
get 58 percent of the vote - enough to get elected without a
runoff. His nearest competitor, former World Bank official Marc
Bazin, 58, was favored by 13 percent.
   The other four leading contenders - evangelical preacher Sylvio
Claude, 56; agronomist Louis Dejoie Jr., 62; industrialist Thomas
Desulme, 77; and sociologist Hubert De Roncerary, 58 - each had
from 3 to 5 percent of the sample.
   The poll was carried out among 1,170 residents of the
Port-au-Prince area, thought to be an Aristide stronghold. Its
statistical margin o  error was not stated.
   If no candidate wins a majority of the vote, a runoff will be
held in January. The president is to be inaugurated Feb. 7, the
fifth anniversary of Duvalier's fall.
   Haitians also are electing 110 members of the bicameral National
Assembly, 134 mayors, 268 municipal council members and 1,695
county officials.

<HEAD>Judge Rebukes Child Welfare Workers in Case of Beaten, Starved Boy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 3-year-old boy who was starved, beaten and left
to die on a bed of leaves ``was killed by every person in this
state,'' a Juvenile Court judge said in an emotional rebuke of the
child-welfare system.
   Judge William Gladstone called state officials into court Friday
to castigate them about the death of Lazaro Figueroa, who had been
under state supervision for two years. The judge also took personal
blame for the death.
   The boy's mother, Ana Marie Cardona, 29, and her roommate,
Olivia Gonzalez-Mendoza, 24, were charged last week with
first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse, and were being held
without bond.
   The dead boy's sister, Taimy Cardona, 5, and a brother, Juan
Puente, 10, have been taken into state custody.
   The case drew widespread attention because the boy's body was
left in front of a home in a wealthy Miami Beach neighborhood and
went unidentified for a month. A baby sitter finally tipped off
police.
   A utility crew found the body Nov. 2. The child was 33 inches
tall but weighed only 18 pounds. His head was disfigured from
swelling around a healed bruise on his forehead.
   As weeks passed with no clues to his identity, he was nicknamed
``Baby Lollipops'' because his T-shirt was decorated with
lollipops.
   His mother and her roommate told police they had left him
``alive but injured'' four days before, but an autopsy determined
he had been dead less than a day. He had brain damage from a skull
fracture, and other fresh and old injuries were found.
   Lazaro came under the supervision of the state Department of
Health and Rehabilitative Services when he and his sister were
abandoned for three months with a baby sitter. The agency lost
track of the family three months later when Cardona vanished.
   The women told investigators they expected someone to find the
boy and take care of him.
   ``In their minds, someone rich would find him. They'd clothe him
and feed him,'' said Miami Beach detective Gary Schiaffo.
   ``This case is my failure, too,'' said the judge, tears welling
in his eyes. ``We all failed. Somehow this child was killed, and he
was killed by every one of us.''
   Gladstone was not told the family had left home because the
caseworker didn't know she was required to tell the judge within 48
hours of the family's disappearance, said Isabel
Afanador-Villalobos, a senior HRS program manager.
   She estimated the caseworker had a caseload of at least 50
children compared to the national standard of 12.
   The death of Bradley McGee, a Florida toddler killed in 1989 by
his parents while under HRS supervision, generated such an outcry
that state lawmakers boosted child-protection spending to avoid a
recurrence.
   ``It's amazing there's not another Lazaro Figueroa - or 80 or
100 more out there,'' Gladstone said. ``If we can't learn something
from this kind of tragedy, we should just fold up the tents and go
home.''

<HEAD>Report: High-Ranking German Demands Soviets Hand Over Honecker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ranking member of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's party demanded the Soviet Union hand over Erich Honecker,
who is wanted by German authorities on manslaughter charges, a
newspaper reported on Saturday.
   Federal lawmaker Johannes Gerster said refusal to turn over the
deposed East German leader for trial could ``burden'' Bonn and
Moscow's ``outstanding relations,'' the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung
newspaper reported.
   A Berlin court has issued an arrest warrant for Honecker, 78, on
the manslaughter charges. He is accused of issuing shoot-to-kill
orders to East German guards at the now-fallen Berlin Wall.
   Honecker has denied all charges against him, including that he
was personally responsible for the estimated 200 people who died
trying to escape his repressive government.
   He has taken refuge at a Soviet military hospital in Beelitz,
outside Berlin.
   Soviet officials have said Honecker is staying at the hospital
for humanitarian reasons, and German police need permission from
the Soviets to gain entry.
   ``I demand that the Soviet government immediately release Erich
Honecker and extradite him to German justice officials,'' the
Osnabrueck newspaper quoted Gerster, a member of Kohl's Christian
Democrats, as saying.
   Honecker's fate is one of the first issues facing Bonn and
Moscow since they signed several treaties designed to draw the two
nations closer together.

<HEAD>Jamaican Governing Party Denies Posse Connection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing People's National Party
denied Saturday any connection with the alleged leader of a
U.S.-based Jamaican gang raided by police on charges including drug
trafficking and murder.
   Following the Thursday crackdown in New York and Texas, a
federal prosecutor in New York City claimed there were links
between the party and Eric Vassell, reputed to head the gang, known
as the Gulleymen Posse.
   A party spokesman said party records were checked by several
officials and no ties to Vassell were uncovered.
   ``No evidence can be found of any personal or official
association with anyone by that name,'' said Hartley Neita, a party
spokesman.
   James M. Fox, head of the FBI's New York office, estimated the
Gulleymen Posse took in more than $100 million in the last five
years and carried out at least 10 murders on Vassell's orders.
   The gang distributed heroin wholesale in New York's Brooklyn
borough during the past decade and branched into crack in the late
1980s, when it expanded to Dallas, officials said.
   Eighteen of 42 alleged posse members were arrested in the raids
in Brooklyn; Hempstead, N.Y.; Uniondale, N.Y.; Albany, N.Y., and in
Dallas. Vassell has not been captured.
   If convicted, all those arrested face life in prison on
narcotics conspiracies and racketeering charges that include
murder, said Andrew J. Maloney, the federal prosecutor in Brooklyn.
   Maloney said Vassell, 31, has fathered 14 to 18 children by
various women and has ties to Jamaican Prime Minister Michael
Manley's party.
   He said Vassell ``used part of his money to contribute to the
PNP, and it's very likely he'll flee back to Jamaica hoping for
some kind of protection there.''
   The raids also netted more that $150,000 in cash and 15 guns.

   In just three days last week, prosecutors of one
of New York's most important murder cases in recent years - the
Bensonhurst racial slaying - suffered a series of stunning and
embarrassing setbacks.
   With little apparent dissent, two separate jury panels
determined quickly that three young white men charged with murder
and accused of being key players in the death of 16-year-old Yusuf
Hawkins were innocent of the most serious crimes.
   At the end of murder trials for five of the eightdefendants,
the district attorney's office in the borough of Brooklyn has won
only one murder conviction - that of triggerman Joseph Fama.
   Three of the alleged attackers were found guilty of lesser
crimes and one defendant was completely exonerated.
   Victorious defense lawyers say it's time to question the
scenario of the Aug. 23, 1989, slaying presented by prosecutors and
the police.
   In the early days of the investigation, said defendant James
Patino's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, ``there were tremendous
pressures on everyone to return indictments quickly to quell the
unrest that was upsetting the city. Prosecutors ran with a theory
that was not supported by the facts.''
   Defense lawyers all say Fama acted alone when he shot Hawkins,
and the other whites had assembled because they believed outsiders
were coming to their insular Bensonhurst neighborhood to cause
trouble.
   But prosecutors stand by their account of the incident,
asserting that Hawkins and his three young, unarmed friends were
set upon by a mob of some 30 bat-wielding whites, only because they
were black.
   Fama emerged from the mob, pointed a .32-caliber automatic at
Hawkins and squeezed off four shots, two of which tore through his
heart.
   Hawkins' slaying was the most serious racial incident in the
city since the 1986 killing of a young black man by a gang of
whites in Howard Beach.
   With racial tensions near the breaking point, Hawkins' murder
sparked a series of massive, and sometimes violent, demonstrations
and protest marches.
   Within days of the shooting, one of the youths, John Vento,
agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for immunity. He
appeared before the grand jury and was expected to be a key
prosecution witness at the trials.
   Hawkins' family has spurned plea bargains with defendants. They
said they wanted to see trials, not deals.
   ``If they had offered my son an option, if they had shot him in
the leg, I would have offered them an option,'' said Hawkins
father, Moses Stewart. ``But they murdered him and there was no
bargaining on that.''
   Vento later dealt a major blow to prosecutors by reneging on his
deal after his family was threatened.
   ``After Vento double-crossed us, these cases were almost
impossible,'' said Assistant District Attorney Edward Boyar.
   The case also was difficult because jurors had trouble
understanding how defendants could be charged with murder although
they neither shot nor struck anyone, prosecutors said.
   The defendants, prosecutors said, were murderers because they
shared the ``mental culpability'' of Fama, while ``acting in
concert'' with him.
   ``It was a very difficult case,'' said Assistant District
Attorney Paul Burns. ``It's always hard to convict someone who is
not the triggerman.''
   The trial judge, Justice Thaddeus Owens of Brooklyn's state
Supreme Court, agreed.
   ``It was the most difficult case I have ever tried. The charges
themselves and the theory under which this case was tried were
difficult concepts that even lawyers have problems with.''
   But defense lawyers say their clients were cleared of murder and
manslaughter because the district attorney's office ``overreached''
and ``over indicted.''
   James J. DiPietro, whose client, Joseph Serrano, was cleared of
murder, manslaughter and other charges, said the defendants were
``sacrificial lambs.'' DiPietro said he places much of the blame on
Elizabeth Holtzman, the former district attorney who was running
for city comptroller when Hawkins was killed.
   Holtzman strongly denied any political motive for the
indictments. She notes that her successor, Charles J. Hynes,
pursued the indictments and added some additional charges after he
took office last January.
   With the trials of three defendants - two of whom face murder
and manslaughter charges - still ahead, the prosecution's
Bensonhurst scorecard looks like this:
   - Fama was convicted of second-degree murder and is serving up
to life in prison. In New York, first-degree murder charges are
brought only if the victim is a law enforcement officer.
   - Vento was acquitted Thursday of murder and manslaughter and
found guilty of riot, unlawful imprisonment and menacing - crimes
that carry a total penalty of four to 12 years.
   - Keith Mondello, ringleader of the whites, was acquitted of
murder and manslaughter, but was found guilty of several lesser
crimes and is serving five and one-third years to 16 years.
   - Serrano was convicted on a misdemeanor weapons charge and
faces up to one year in jail.
   - Patino, 25, was completely exonerated.

<HEAD>Military Takes Time Out For Army-Navy Game</HEAD>

<DATELINE>IN EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. servicemen took time out
from their duties Saturday to enjoy an American tradition, rooting
for their favorites in the Army-Navy football game.
   ``If there was one game I had to pick - the Super Bowl, the
Orange Bowl, or whatever - this is the game I'd want to see,'' said
Lt. Cmdr. Tim Traeen, 36, of Gig Harbor, Wash.
   ``It incorporates all the reasons why I'm in the Navy, the
challenge, the competition, the spirit,'' Traeen said.
   Traeen left his duty station as supply officer aboard the USS
Blue Ridge, the flag ship for the U.S. Navy Central Command in the
Persian Gulf region, to watch the game live on Armed Forces
Network.
   A former tight end at the Naval Academy, he once recalled
listening to the game results during strategic operations in a
missile submarine.
   Also watching the game, which Army won 30-20, was U.S. Army Col.
Bill Mulvey, a 1968 graduate of West Point and now director of the
Joint Information Bureau in eastern Saudi Arabia.
   In 1969, he listened to the game on the radio behind the trigger
of a .50 caliber machine gun while doing perimeter guard duty in an
armored personnel carrier in Vietnam.
   ``The 12th man isn't just the cadets in the stands. We're all
part of the Army team,'' said Mulvey, 44, of Clarksville, Tenn.
   ``These Navy guys get to watch the game in their air conditioned
wardrooms off the coast. In Saudi Arabia, the Army has to listen on
the radio because they're in the desert,'' he said, unable to
resist a dig at the Navy.
   Signs of the rivalry invaded Islamic culture. There were ``Go
Navy'' bumper stickers arrayed against Army banners that read
``Swamp Canoe U.'' and ``Navy's Top Gun Is A Pop Gun.''
   Watching the game was a pleasant break from duty stations
enforcing U.N. sanctions against Iraq or guard posts in the sand to
deter Iraqi aggression as part of Operation Desert Shield. Some
soldiers brought their rifles and gas masks to watch the game.
   Soldiers and sailors whooped and cheered and taunted each other.
   Yet both sides acknowledged that despite the sports rivalry,
they were on the same side in the gulf.
   ``You can beat the heck out of each other on the football field.
But when the stuff hits the fan, we pull together,'' Traeen said.
   One bemused but neutral spectator to the game, on the 100th
anniversary of the first Army-Navy game, was Faheem Hamid, editor
of the Saudi Gazette.
   ``I'm just trying to figure out what's happening,'' said Hamid.
``To tell you the truth, I'm watching for the sake of change. It's
something different. This football is very aggressive. But it's
full of enjoyment.''

   NASA said Saturday it may bring the
space shuttle Columbia back to Earth a day early because of clogged
lines that prevented waste water from being dumped overboard.
   The clog became the latest in a string of problems for the
10-day astronomy mission, which wasn't supposed to end until
Tuesday night.
   Columbia's seven astronauts were in no danger, NASA said. But
flight directors rushed to develop ways to solve the problem.
   Randy Stone, chief of NASA's flight director office, initially
said it was unlikely Columbia would have to return Sunday, adding
that Monday was more likely. Mission Control later in the day
assured the crew it would stay in space until Monday.
   ``I would be hopeful that we can get to 10 days, but where we
stand right now I'm not terribly optimistic that we can make it,''
Stone said. ``But certainly, we will not give up on that because we
do want to maximize the science we're getting out of this
mission.''
   On-board computer failures and a faulty instrument pointing
system already left the $150 million Astro observatory aboard the
shuttle far behind its schedule of observing stars, galaxies and
other celestial objects.
   ``We feel now that things are going rather well,'' said Warren
Moos of the Johns Hopkins University telescope team. ``We would be
very disappointed but we also understand that's also the way the
mission works. If there's something that endangers the spacecraft,
you simply have no choice.''
   The waste water tank's clogged lines were discovered Saturday
morning while the crew was performing the shuttle's daily water
dump.
   As Columbia circled the world for the 101st time, the astronauts
purged the line with air. They said they succeeded in removing some
debris, but a partial blockage remained.
   Astronaut Mike Lounge transferred some water from the 20-gallon
tank, located beneath the cabin floor, into a large rubber bag.
Before Lounge began the task, the tank was about two-thirds full
and would have been full within 20 hours.
   The transfer to the bag, which can hold about 12 gallons, should
provide another 40 hours of flight time unless other water-saving
measures can be carried out.
   To help keep the tank's water level down, Mission Control's
Story Musgrave instructed the crew to start using the 54 urine
collection bags on board. Besides urine, the tank holds water from
humidity removed from the cabin.
   Stone said the astronauts would not be asked to drink less
water.
   ``That is non-productive from a physiological standpoint because
you want them in the best possible shape you can get them in,''
Stone said.
   NASA has had trouble with the shuttle's waste water system in
previous missions. During Columbia's last flight in January, water
collected under the floor because of lint and other contamination
sucked into the plumbing, Stone said. In 1984, ice collected on a
nozzle on Discovery's water output lines.
   Lint was found to be clogging the air vents of a computer that
failed aboard Columbia on Dec. 2. Stone declined to speculate as to
whether lint also might have clogged the shuttle's waste water
lines.
   As the National Aeronautics and Space Administration debated
what to do, star-gazing calmly continued 218 miles above Earth.
Astronaut-astronomers Jeffrey Hoffman and Sam Durrance, with
guidance from ground teams, focused the observatory's three
ultraviolet telescopes on a variety of stars.
   NASA told the crew they might be able to catch a glimpse of the
Galileo spacecraft as it passed within 2,160 miles of the shuttle
on Saturday afternoon, but there was no word from the crew as to
whether they had spotted it. Galileo passed by Earth to use its
gravity like a slingshot and boost it along on its six-year journey
to Jupiter.
   The four astronomers aboard Columbia were forced to rely on help
from scientists and engineers on Earth in running the telescopes
after a flight deck computer overheated and shut down Thursday. The
only other on-board terminal for operating the observatory failed
Dec. 2, nine hours into the flight.
   Astro's X-ray telescope was unaffected by the computer failure
since it has its own pointing system and is controlled by computer
commands sent from the ground.

<HEAD>Ancient Irish Necklace Will Return to Dublin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey said
Saturday his government has negotiated the return of an ancient
Irish necklace from an auction house in Britain.
   Haughey confirmed a cash reward had been paid for the return of
the necklace, but did not say how much or to whom. The domestic
British agency Press Association reported the reward was more than
$19,500.
   The 3,800-year-old Bronze Age necklace, or lunula, will be
displayed in Dublin's National Museum, Haughey said.
   Haughey intervened last month when Christie's auctioneers in
London said they received the necklace from an unidentified client
who wanted its value appraised.
   At the time, Haughey said there was evidence the necklace was
found in Ireland and taken abroad in violation of the national
monuments act.
   Christie's spokesman Mark Wrey said the person whom Christie's
believes to own the necklace was offered $23,500 by the National
Museum.
   The necklace was found in County Galway in 1975. Irish press
reports have valued it at about $39,200.
   Press Association reported the money for the reward came from
Ireland's national lottery, set up five years ago to raise cash for
projects including those in the artistic and educational fields.

<HEAD>Romanian Unions Announce Nationwide Strike Monday</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union leaders and students agreed
Saturday to launch nationwide strikes next week to topple the
government.
   It was the latest sign of growing popular discontent threatening
government leaders, who opponents accuse of ties to the deposed
Communist regime of Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The decision to go on with the protest Monday came despite a
government promise to postpone by six months price increases for
basic foods that had been scheduled to take effect Jan. 1.
   The government concession, announced Friday, had been made in an
effort to defuse the mounting criticism of its actions and the
threat of strikes across the nation. However, union representatives
were unimpressed.
   ``This is a bait, and we won't take it. ... It's very
Ceausescu-like,'' Ion Toth of the National Drivers' Union told
reporters.
   The Communist dictator, who was known to sometimes ease his
repressive rule as a strategic ploy, was overthrown in the Romanian
revolution a year ago. He was executed at that time.
   Prices of most items have doubled and tripled since the lifting
of state price controls on Nov. 1, and people in several cities
have taken to the street in mass protests recently as a result.
   At the news conference at the Union Confederation headquarters,
Daniel Vasile, vice president of the 100,000-member drivers' union,
said the strike will begin Monday and will end ``when the
government comes down.''
   A statement by the Union Confederation said the one-million
member Fratia Union and 300,000-member Hercules Union, which
represent workers in a variety of jobs, would support the drivers'
strike and its ``final aim.''
   In another strike call, a national students' conference in
Timisoara, about 250 miles northwest of Bucharest, proclaimed a
boycott of classes beginning Monday and demanded the resignation of
President Ion Iliescu.
   In his remarks, Vasile also demanded the dismissal of all
``compromised'' former Communists who are still leading local
government and industry.
   The governing National Salvation Front, which ruled
provisionally before overwhelmingly winning democratic elections in
May, is rapidly losing support as the economic situation worsens.
   Many say the government, which contains former Communist Party
officials, is undemocratic, despite official assertions to the
contrary. Others fault it for trying to lead the nation to
capitalism too quickly and disregarding the human costs of mounting
economic hardship.
   In a televised report Friday night, government spokesman Bogdan
Baltazar dismissed the unions' decision to strike as ``illegal,''
``anti-national'' and ``anti-human.''

<HEAD>Amnesty Branch Reports Torture, Detentions of Palestinians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Italian branch of Amnesty International accused
Israel on Saturday of violating international law by torturing
Palestinians and detaining them for long periods without charge.
   The report, marking the third anniversary of the Palestinian
uprising in the Israeli-occupied lands, also charged that Israeli
authorities have allowed excessive use of firearms against
Palestinians.
   The human rights group said tension in the occupied territories
had grown worse in recent months. It attributed the change to the
formation of a right-wing Israeli government, an increase in
killings by Palestinians of suspected Israeli collaborators, and
widespread support among Palestinians for Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein.
   Amnesty also said that thousands of Palestinians had been
subject to torture at the hands of Israeli soldiers or in detention
centers.
   The methods included burning with cigarettes, depriving people
of sleep, and covering their heads with hoods and striking them,
the report said. At least six Palestinians had died after being
beaten in such cases, it said.
   ``Amnesty International is seriously worried about the treatment
of Palestinians during detention and in particular the methods of
interrogation practiced'' by security services, it said.
   It cited the case of Rami Muslah, 14, of the Buraij refugee camp
in the Gaza Strip. The Italian group said the boy was arrested on
Sept. 25 following the death of an Israeli soldier in the camp.
   A lawyer who was permitted to visit him on Oct. 29 said the boy
had been beaten badly in the chest and head, spit blood and had
difficulty breathing and speaking, Amnesty said.
   The boy said he had been beaten during his interrogation and
that authorities put a gun to his head and said they would shoot
him if he did not confess, the human rights group said.
   The report also said that at least 660 Palestinians had been
killed in three years by Israelis using firearms. Nearly half the
victims were under 18, the Italian group said.
   ``Amnesty International feels particularly concerned about
official directives on the use of firearms that seem to give
consent, without any justification, to the killing of people not
necessarily involved in activities that threaten the lives of other
people,'' the report by the Italian group said.
   The report also charged that more than 12,000 Palestinians had
been held in administrative detention since the start of the
uprising.
   Those held under the system are often not informed of charges
against them or given prompt trials, the Italian group said.
   It asked Israeli to re-examine the system of administrative
detention and free those held under it.
   Israel captured the Gaza Strip and West Bank from Arab neighbors
during the 1967 Middle East War. Leaders of the uprising are
challenging Israeli rule there.

<HEAD>Year Later After Famous Salvador Arrest, Peace Worker Still
Anti-War Activist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One year ago, Jennifer J. Casolo sat
blindfolded in a cell in El Salvador, accused of concealing weapons
for leftist guerrillas in an arrest that made her an anti-war cause
celebre.
   The 29-year-old activist said she remains devoted to working for
peace in the war-ravaged Central American nation where she was
imprisoned for 18 days.
   A church worker in El Salvador for four years, Casolo was
arrested after authorities raided her house and unearthed dynamite,
grenades and more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition from the garden.
   She was charged with storing munitions for leftist rebels trying
to overthrow the government. Authorities released her for lack of
evidence and expelled her from the country.
   Casolo insists she is innocent.
   The Salvadoran government has stood by its charges, and has
since alleged that Casolo was a drug trafficker and a main
organizer of a U.S. boycott of Salvadoran coffee.
   Since her return to the United States last December, Casolo has
given hundreds of speeches around the country, recounting her
eyewitness account of El Salvador's 11-year civil war.
   She said she has received threatening telephone calls, was
arrested at a protest in front of the White House, hired a booking
agent and barely squeezes in a quiet social life.
   ``I live and breathe El Salvador,'' she told The Hartford
Courant in an interview published Saturday. ``I live with such an
urgency about it. Every day there's not peace, there's another
person dead.''
   Casolo, a Connecticut native, recently moved to Washington where
she lives in a Christian community of 25 people that bases its
beliefs on the 13th-century teachings of St. Francis of Assisi, who
is associated with the simple love of nature.
   Her arrest brought her fame and the attention of U.S. government
leaders, entertainers and socialites. But Casolo has stuck to a
simple life, preferring talks with church groups in Appalachia to
events in Boston catered with salmon hors d'oeuvres.
   Since she returned to the United States last Dec. 14, little
light has been shed on the charges against her.
   At many of Casolo's speaking engagements, conservative groups
have hung protest banners and challenged her version of the arrest.
   Even in El Salvador, some denounce her. A T-shirt sold across
the country depicts Casolo as a big-mouthed stick figure surrounded
by munitions. It calls her ``La Guerrilla Internacionalista,'' or
the international guerilla.
   Casolo still fears her outspoken criticism of the U.S. and
Salvadoran governments could bring her injury or death.
   Her future is uncertain. She lives off honoraria and donations,
but requests for speaking engagements have declined, and fewer
people attend them now.
   Casolo said she knows Americans are focused on the Persian Gulf,
but she hopes people will remember the 73,000 people who have died
in the Salvadoran civil war and the millions of dollars in U.S. aid
that goes to El Salvador each year.
   The U.S. Congress recently passed a bill that, starting in
fiscal 1991, will halve the $85 million in military aid El Salvador
receives annually.
   ``God has given me something somewhat unique; I can raise
people's voices. I can inspire people to do something,'' she said.

Those aboard were scheduled to continue on a flight to Houston via
Bangor, Maine. But there was no immediate word on details of their
travel plans.
   It was not clear whether their departure had been arranged
before the Iraqi parliament on Friday approved President Saddam
Hussein's call to free the hostages. The exodus was expected to get
under way in earnest on Sunday.
   President Bush, in Venezuela, welcomed the move to free the
captives, but said Iraq still must get out of Kuwait, which it
overran Aug. 2.
   ``When you don't have Americans there, and if force is required,
that's just one less worry I've got,'' Bush said.
   Iraqi authorities, meanwhile, called on the public Saturday to
``renew their vigilance'' in the face of a possible threat from the
U.S.-led international forces.
   The Interior Ministry had instructed civil defense groups and
provincial officials to prepare for ``any eventuality,'' said the
nightly television news broadcast. Posters warning the population
``not to panic in case of attack'' appeared on walls of buildings
in downtown Baghdad.
   Iraqi officials said Saturday all the departing detainees still
need exit visas. U.S. officials have asked them to expedite the
processing.
   Americans who had been held at strategic installations as
``human shields'' began arriving in Baghdad Saturday. Many said
they would not feel safe until they were out of Iraq.
   ``I still think of myself as a hostage because I cannot leave
the hotel,'' said Edward Smiley of Los Angeles.
   Smiley, who said he was moved around to six different locations,
described conditions as ``very bad.''
   He said the hostages were forced to sleep in bug-ridden beds and
to eat fish heads for much of the time.
   About 8,000 Westerners had been detained since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, including about 600 who were held at strategic
sites in an effort to deter any U.S. attack. The hostages included
about 900 Americans as well as other Westerners, Eastern Europeans
and Japanese.
   The first group of 17 American hostages was led through passport
control at Baghdad's Saddam Airport by Iraqi officials.
   ``We're outta here!'' shouted a delighted American.
   The airport departure area was littered with broken suitcases,
clothes and other debris left over from a group of at least 200
Vietnamese workers flown to Hanoi earlier in the day.
   A witness who did not want to be named described how Iraqi
customs officials tore through their luggage pulling out food,
carpets and other items.
   The 23 Americans on the flight arranged by Connally also
included members of the U.S. Embassy staff in Kuwait, and three
people who had taken refuge at the ambassador's refuge in Baghdad.
   Connally went to Baghdad on a private mission to obtain the
release of hostages.
   A group of 41 Japanese men whose release was approved before
Sadam's announcemnt also flew to Amman, Jordan, on Saturday aboard
an Iraqi Airways plane. They later left for Tokyo.
   Nur Eldin al-Safi, the head of Iraqi Airways, said the airline
was prepared to fly out all of the hostages within three days if
their travel documents are ready. He said that no foreign carrier
would be allowed to transport them out of Iraq.
   Al-Safi said U.S. officials had chartered one of the airlines'
Boeing 707s to fly to Kuwait Sunday to pick up Americans. The
United States had also chartered a 747 jumbo jet to fly those
Americans and others in Baghdad to Frankfurt, Germany, later
Sunday, he added.
   Meanwhile, the official Iraqi News Agency said Iraq rejected the
dates the United States has suggested for Secretary of State James
A. Baker III's trip to Baghdad for talks with Saddam.
   Iraq proposed Jan. 12 as the date for the Baker trip, the news
agency said. The State Department had suggested he visit on Dec.
20, Dec. 21, Dec. 22 or Jan. 3.
   A Jan. 12 date would come only three days before the deadline
set down in a U.N. resolution demanding an Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait. The Security Council measure authorizes use of ``all
necessary means'' to dislodge Iraq after that.
   At the United Nations, U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering held
negotiations Saturday to try to find some ``wiggle room'' to avoid
having to veto a resolution endorsing a Middle East peace
conference, a U.S. official said.
   A U.S. veto would outrage Washington's Arab allies in the
anti-Iraq coalition assembled in the Persian Gulf, but Israel will
be equally angered if Pickering lets the resolution pass by
abstaining or voting in favor.
   Increasing the pressure, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
who is on a U.S. visit, was to meet Pickering Saturday evening,
just before the Security Council session.

   Martin Ritt, the maverick director
of ``Norma Rae,'' ``The Front'' and ``The Long Hot Summer'' who
once was blacklisted in Hollywood, died Saturday of complications
from heart disease.
   The director of 25 films and 250 television shows died at Santa
Monica Hospital Medical Center, said Chuck Warn, spokesman for the
Directors Guild of America. Details on the cause of death were not
given.
   His family said he was 76 years old, Warn said, but studio and
other biographies listed him as 70.
   Ritt, who often set his films in the South, never shied from
controversial issues, such as racial prejudice in ``Sounder,''
blacklisting in ``The Front,'' and labor rights in ``The Molly
Maguires'' and ``Norma Rae.''
   ``He was my mentor and my friend and my father,'' said Sally
Field, who won an Oscar for her role in ``Norma Rae'' in 1978. ``He
made me a better actor and a better human being and I loved him to
the core.''
   The son of Jewish immigrants, Ritt started as an actor in New
York in the late 1930s. After serving in the U.S. Army during World
War II, he worked on live television shows until he was blacklisted
in the 1950s.
   He made his first feature, ``Edge of the City,'' with Sidney
Poitier in 1957. One year later, he filmed Faulkner's ``The Long
Hot Summer'' and ``The Sound and the Fury.''
   Both films were adapted by his most frequent collaborators,
Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr., who also worked with Ritt on
``Hombre,'' ``Hud,'' ``Norma Rae'' and ``Murphy's Romance.''
   ``Ours was more than a collaboration,'' Ravetch said. ``It was a
long and enduring marriage of over 20 years, full of laughter,
fulfillment, tolerance and tenderness.''
   In 1965, Ritt worked with Richard Burton in ``The Spy Who Came
in From the Cold'' and with Barbara Streisand in ``Nuts'' in 1987.
He also directed the 1961 jazz movie ``Paris Blues'' starring
Poitier and Paul Newman and worked with Walter Matthau in the
eccentric 1972 comedy-drama, ``Pete 'n Tillie.''
   ``As a poker player, Marty was dangerously conservative, totally
the opposite of what he was in his social and political outlook,''
Matthau said in a statement. ``His conservatism in poker, however,
was the primary stuff all good poker players are made of, because
he combined it with an occasional radical explosion.''
   In 1984, Ritt traded in his director's cap to play baseball
manager Burly De Vito in Neil Simon's comedy ``The Slugger's
Wife.'' In 1989, Ritt directed his last movie, ``Stanley and
Iris,'' which starred Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro.
   Ritt, who resided in Pacific Palisades, is survived by his wife,
Adele; daughter, Martina Ritt Werner; and son, Micheal Ritt.
   A memorial service was scheduled for Dec. 17 at the Directors
Guild of America in Hollywood.

   The spacecraft Galileo grabbed Earth's
gravity coattails Saturday and arced around the planet on a
fleeting visit home 13{ months into a six-year voyage to Jupiter.
   Taking pictures and exploring with instruments, Galileo used
Earth as a gravity slingshot, hurtling 597 miles above the western
Atlantic, the point of closest approach.
   The encounter, at 12:35 p.m. PST, increased the craft's speed by
11,600 mph, giving it a speed of 79,000 mph relative to the sun.
Relative to the Earth, which is also moving, the maximum speed was
30,721 mph.
   ``Everything is working exactly as it should,'' said mission
director Neal E. Ausman Jr. at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory as
the craft flew through Earth's shadow. ``We've had no glitches, no
problems.''
   Project officials said the flyby was a valuable dress rehearsal
for the Jupiter encounter.
   ``Every time we turn an instrument on, we have problems
understanding what we've done to it, and what we probably can do to
the software,'' said Clayne M. Yeates, science and mission design
manager. ``So we're really learning how to operate these
instruments. It's been invaluable for us to collect this data.''
   Project manager William J. O'Neil added, ``Once we do figure out
what they're doing we find that they're operating up to expectation
or beyond.''
   Galileo's looping 2.4 billion-mile route to Jupiter made it the
first planetary spacecraft to approach Earth from space and
provided scientists the first opportunity to look at the world in
the same way as they have other planets.
   Controllers ordered Galileo's instruments to measure gases that
cause ``greenhouse effect'' warming of the atmosphere and study
high-altitude water vapor involved in creating and destroying the
ozone layer.
   The trajectory also allowed scientists to explore the far side
of the moon, always facing away from Earth, with modern instruments
for the first time. The far side observations will occur over
several days.
   Galileo approached from Earth's dark side, measuring its
magnetic field and solar plasma flows, and taking pictures of the
crescent moon.
   Two pictures released soon after the flyby showed a portion of
the near-side of the moon and a cloud-streaked view of central
Australia. Data and pictures will continue to come in as Galileo
speeds away.
   Its path also took it 2,162 miles above the orbiting space
shuttle Columbia.
   Exploration of the blue planet and its moon was an added bonus
to Galileo's $1.4 billion mission.
   The spacecraft was originally designed to make a 2{-year direct
flight to Jupiter for long-term observation of the solar system's
biggest planet.
   But the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's safety
review after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986
led to changes in Galileo's own booster system that made a direct
flight impossible because its new rocket was less powerful.
   Shuttle Atlantis carried Galileo into orbit Oct. 18, 1989, and
launched it on a roundabout trajectory using three gravity assists
from Venus and Earth.
   The spacecraft flew past Venus on Feb. 10. It will get another
boost from Earth on Dec. 8, 1992. That encounter will be closer, at
an altitude of about 200 miles. The pass will also greatly widen
its orbit around the sun in order to intercept Jupiter.
   Galileo will go into orbit around Jupiter on Dec. 7, 1995.
   A probe launched from Galileo five months earlier will plunge
into the atmosphere at 100,000 mph, deploy a parachute and make
measurements for 75 minutes until it is crushed by intense
pressure.
   The orbiter will continue to explore Jupiter and 10 of its 16
known moons for two years.

   The British Army was called out Saturday after one
of the worst snow storms in years left about 500,000 people without
electricity and hundreds of motorists stranded.
   Helicopters were used to rescue drivers along roadways covered
by deep snowdrifts in sections of central and northern England and
Wales. Some motorists were stuck for more than 30 hours. British
Rail service to northern England and Scotland was halted.
   London Weather Center said the deepest reported fall of snow was
nearly nine inches at Nottingham, 126 miles north of London.
However, winds were heavy, and snow drifted more than 5 feet deep
in some places.
   An East Midlands Electricity Board spokesman said conditions
Saturday were ``the worst weather in 20 years.'' Army troops were
used to help repair fallen power lines.
   Weather forecasters said the icy conditions would persist until
at least the middle of this week. Heavy snow was likely on Sunday
in the southeast.
   Snow flurries fell in London on Saturday, but there was no
accumulation.
   In Cumbria, in northern England, one man died after he suffered
a heart attack and an ambulance was unable to get through because
of bad weather.
   British Rail officials said the main line between Edinburgh and
London was blocked by mobile homes blown onto the line.
   Northeast England was also blasted by wind gusts of up to 88 mph
and heavy rain and sleet along the coast.
   In Crimdon, winds destroyed about 100 mobile homes, but there
were no reports of injuries, police said.

   Divers have recovered the bodies of
three Scottish fishermen whose boat was dragged underwater when its
nets were snagged by a British submarine, police said Saturday.
   The bodies were found Friday night on the wreck of the fishing
vessel Antares in the Firth of Clyde southwest of Glasgow, said a
police spokesman in Strathclyde.
   Four fishermen were on the Antares when it was pulled under by
the submarine Trenchant on Nov. 22. Police said Saturday they were
still looking for the fourth man.
   After the sinking, lawmakers complained to Parliament that
fishermen in the Firth of Clyde had long been in danger from
submarines, whose activities the Royal Navy has kept secret.
   On Dec. 5, in a reversal of Cold War policy, the navy agreed to
tell fishermen where and when submarines travel in the waterway.
   Work on raising the Antares was to continue over the weekend,
said the spokesman on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Former City Consultant Charged in Scheme Defends $1 Million in
Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kenneth Weiner, Detroit's former deputy civilian
police chief, testified that the city paid him about $1 million
from its secret police fund for security consulting and trips to
Europe on city business.
   Weiner, 44, is one of three defendants on trial in U.S. District
Court on charges of organizing a precious metals scheme that bilked
more than 100 wealthy investors out of millions of dollars.
   The one-time confidant of Mayor Coleman Young who is now accused
of being a con man testified Friday that his work as a city
consultant took him to ``New York, California, Washington, Europe,
Geneva, London.''
   The mayor's ties to Weiner go back to when Weiner was deputy
civilian police chief between 1978 and 1986, when he resigned amid
an investigation into the precious metals scandal.
   Testifying for a second day in his own defense, Weiner said the
payments between 1986 and 1988 averaged $333,333 a year and were
legitimate, covering ``all my expenses, travel, time, equipment,
any security equipment, any project, anywhere I had to go.''
   Also on trial are Weiner associates Alvin Gendelman and Steven
Lewin.
   Weiner, who was arrested a year ago and is being held without
bond, is also the subject of a federal grand jury probe into $2.4
million missing from the secret police fund.
   While being paid by the city, Weiner also was working undercover
with the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service, authorities say. The
federal agencies were investigating allegations of corruption in
Young's administration.
   Weiner testified that the FBI recruited him in 1986 to look into
claims Young was peddling influence to Japanese interests, the
Detroit Free Press reported Saturday.
   Weiner is the only member of the Young administration charged as
a result of that probe. Young has not been charged with any
wrongdoing.
   Weiner also worked for Young's private consulting firm, Detroit
Technologies and Investment Inc., dealing in gold and diamonds for
the mayor. Weiner said Young began investing with him in 1981.
   An ongoing federal grand jury probe of alleged corruption and
mishandling of funds at the Police Department has subpoenaed
financial records of Young's consulting company, but the government
hasn't disclosed whether Young is targeted in that investigation,
the mayor's attorney has said.
   Weiner said his role in the FBI investigation was complicated by
federal agents, whom he claimed were often uncooperative. Agents
once refused to give him 400 ounces of gold he was due to return to
Young that day, he said.
   Weiner said FBI agents coached him on how to draw information
from the mayor.
   ``I was to tape certain conversations, at their direction,''
Weiner testified. ``In each meeting they wanted facts discussed and
if we discussed gold, they wanted it discussed in a certain way.''
   He said he taped about 75 conversations while working with the
FBI and IRS.

<DATELINE>FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 175 relatives of Fort Campbell
soldiers who died in a 1985 plane crash gathered Saturday to mark
the fifth anniversary of the disaster, which was the target of
congressional scrutiny last week.
   A House Judiciary subcommittee concluded Wednesday that the
federal government should review Canada's findings in the crash at
Gander, Newfoundland, which killed 256 soldiers on a flight home
from a six-month Middle East peacekeeping tour.
   During Saturday's observance, the honorary commander of the
regiment the victims served said relatives should concentrate on
rebuilding their lives rather than dwell on the circumstances of
the crash.
   ``It has been five years of sorrow and healing and remembering.
Let's keep it in perspective and continue to rebuild our lives as
we have done since that tragic day,'' retired Col. Robert E. Jones
told the crowd in Gander Memorial Park, which is dedicated to the
tragedy.
   Jones said military service often means facing danger, such as
members of the 101st Airborne Division from Fort Campbell are
confronting now in Saudi Arabia.
   ``The way of the soldier and his family is often hard and
fraught with danger as evidenced by the present deployment of our
military forces overseas,'' Jones said.
   Jones was selected for the honorary post by the regiment's
troops before the Dec. 12, 1985 crash but did not accompany the
unit on its peacekeeping mission in the Sinai Peninsula.
   The House Judiciary subcommittee on crime heard testimony last
week on a possible terrorist link to the disaster. The panel
concluded that Canada should turn over its investigative reports on
the crash to the FBI while the National Transportation Safety Board
analyzes the cause of the tragedy.
   FBI agents were barred from the crash scene and the NTSB
embraced Canada's findings about the cause without consulting the
chief U.S. investigator who looked into the disaster, according to
testimony before the panel.
   A Canadian panel had concluded that the military charter plane
probably went down because of ice on its wings. The Canadian
findings have been challenged by other Canadian investigators,
several congressmen and families of the victims who suspect
terrorism as the cause.
   But like Jones, some of the family members at the base Saturday
seemed o focus more on families of troops deployed in the Persian
Gulf. One was Louise Wright, who lost her 23-year-old brother,
John, in the crash.
   ``It's not easy,'' Ms. Wright said. ``We just have to deal with
it. I feel for the families who have members over there now.''
   Nearby, 248 Canadian maple trees stand in uniform rows as a
reminder of the same number of soldiers who died.
   Jeff Mollohan, who lost his 47-year-old father, attended the
ceremony along with his wife and two children. Mollohan said the
Christmas season has been an especially hard time of year since the
crash.
   ``It's changed a lot of things as far as what we look forward
to,'' Mollohan said. ``There's an empty void. There's no way it can
be replaced.''

   President Bush said Saturday the evacuation of
Americans from Kuwait and Iraq makes ``one less worry I've got'' in
deciding whether to go to war against Baghdad. ``I don't feel we
are closer to a peaceful solution,'' he said.
   Bush also denied any connection between the hostages' release
and his withdrawal of all American diplomats from Kuwait, as had
been demanded by Saddam Hussein. ``It is no payback,'' Bush
declared.
   ``You can make the argument that this facilitates the tough
decisions that might lie ahead,'' he said of the decision to bring
out the diplomats. He made the remarks at a news conference on the
final day of a five-nation South American tour. He returned to
Washington from his last stop, Caracas, Venezuela, on Saturday
evening.
   As Bush spoke, 23 American hostages left Baghdad on a chartered
plane in a prelude to an exodus of foreign captives. About 900
Americans were among 8,000 foreigners held against their will since
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2.
   ``When you don't have Americans there, and if force is required,
that's just one less worry I've got,'' Bush said, renewing demands
that Iraq pull its forces out of Kuwait.
   Public support for military action against Iraq has grown since
mid-November, according to a Newsweek magazine poll released
Saturday. According to the survey, 56 percent of Americans support
military action, compared with 46 percent a month earlier.
   But more than half the respondents said the UnitedStates should
wait longer than the Jan. 15 deadline for withdrawal set by the
United Nations to give diplomacy and economic sanctions more time
to work.
   The survey of 769 adults was taken Thursday and Friday and has a
margin of error of plus or minus four points.
   Bush spoke in the sun-drenched Venezuelan capital as he wrapped
up a trip that also included stops in Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina
and Chile. His goal was to salute the sweep of democracy throughout
the Western Hemisphere, but the message was obscured each day by
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, standing alongside
Bush, expressed solidarity with the stand against Iraq. He said
small countries such as his own cannot accept ``for anybody to be
able to delete by force the boundaries of an existing nation.''
   ``Good answer,'' Bush told Perez.
   After Iraq announced the release of the hostages, the United
States on Friday said it would remove the handful of American
diplomats who have manned the besieged embassy in Kuwait.
   ``The feeling is when every single American is out of Kuwait, we
will clear the decks and the embassy will have ceased to be
fulfilling any day-to-day functions,'' the president said.
   ``But there is no payback, there is no change in my
determination to get Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait in compliance
with the United Nations resolutions,'' he added.
   Bush said the risk of war had not been diminished either by the
hostages' release or the easing of the global oil crunch.
   ``I want a peaceful solution,'' Bush said. ``I don't feel we are
closer to a peaceful solution. And the reason I don't is because
Saddam Hussein continues insisting that Kuwait is a province of
Iraq and that he will not get out of Kuwait.''
   Bush said, ``I'm glad the hostages are coming home. They never
should have been taken in the first place.
   ``When you kidnap somebody,'' Bush added, you should not expect
a reward when you let the person go.''
   He added: ``I have said from the very beginning that this cruel
policy of taking hostages and holding them in hopes that they will
change the policy of this alliance is fruitless.
   ``But I am very glad that these people are coming out.''
   The State Department was pursuing arrangements Saturday to
evacuate Americans from Iraq.
   U.S. Charge d'Affaires Joseph Wilson informed Iraqi Foreign
Ministry officials in Baghdad that the United States had chartered
a plane to pick up Americans in Kuwait on Sunday morning, fly them
to Baghdad, take on additional Americans there and continue later
in the day to Frankfurt, an official said.
   National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, asked in a CNN
``Newsmaker Saturday'' interview whether freedom of the hostages
would improve the atmosphere for Iraqi-U.S. talks, responded, ``not
so far as we're concerned.''
   Scowcroft emphasized that the United States will neither
negotiate with Saddam nor make concessions. There has been no
change, he said, in the policy of ``trying to convince Saddam
Hussein that he has two options, and that is to withdraw... or to
face catastrophe.''
   Bush praised Venezuela for its increase in oil production in the
face of the cut off from Iraq and Kuwait. He said there is no
worldwide shortage of oil despite the increasing prices.
   He blamed the price surge on ``paper barrels of oil'' being
manipulated by international futures markets.
   Perez said Venezuela and Mexico were helping the poor nations of
Central America and the Caribbean to finance their oil imports.
However, he said ``We cannot do the same with all of our Latin
American clients simply because we, too, have our own
difficulties.''
   He said the surplus profits from oll sales were being deposited
in an economic stabilization fund for the days when oil prices
fall.
   On another matter, Bush defended the presence of American
military troops in Panama and said he did not know how long they
would be stationed there.
   ``We want to see Panama's democracy be successful and we would
like to see them perfect their own police-keeping function so that
they don't need any outside assistance to guarantee against
uprising,'' Bush said.

   His Manhattan home remains a shrine. His fans
have not forgotten.
   On the 10th anniversary of his assassination, John Lennon was
remembered Saturday with spontaneous tributes in New York and Los
Angeles, a plaque in his hometown of Liverpool and a rendition of
``Yesterday'' on Moscow television.
   Hundreds of Lennon fans stopped by Strawberry Fields, the
section of Central Park opposite the Manhattan apartment building
where he was shot to death by a deranged fan on Dec. 8, 1980.
Others left flowers outside the Dakota for his widow, Yoko Ono.
   ``John is an old friend of mine. I grew up hearing his
records,'' said Sam Diaz, 30, who came to leave a bouquet in
Strawberry Fields. ``I feel sad today. I miss his music, but I'll
never forget John Lennon.''
   Ono was not at the Dakota apartment Saturday, said her
spokesman, Elliot Mintz. She and the couple's 15-year-old son,
Sean, were marking the anniversary quietly in Europe, he said.
   Ono said earlier this year she chose to celebrate Lennon's 50th
birthday rather than dwell on his death. The Oct. 9 occasion was
marked by a worldwide broadcast of Lennon's peace anthem,
``Imagine,'' for an estimated 1 billion listeners.
   ``Strawberry Fields'' played softly from a boom box Saturday as
visitors piled flowers and assorted mementos alongside a makeshift
memorial fashioned from a cardboard box in Central Park.
   An ink sketch of Lennon looking down on the world topped the
tribute, which carried the handwritten message, ``Thank you John,
for showing us the way how to care for ourselves and the world.''
   Visitors left behind a green apple symbolic of the Beatles'
record label, a burning candle encircled with strawberries, and a
glass of white wine.
   In Los Angeles, Lennon's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was
piled high with flowers Saturday as about 200 people sat nearby
singing songs. Many called for peace in the Persian Gulf.
   The lyrics to such Lennon songs as ``Imagine'' and ``Give Peace
a Chance'' were plastered on the sides of buildings and on
hand-held signs.
   ``We have to keep that message in our hearts, especially with
the crisis in the Persian Gulf,'' said Jerry Rubin, director of the
Los Angeles chapter of the Alliance for Survival peace
organization.
   In his hometown of Liverpool, England, people paid tribute along
the Cavern Walk, which marks the nightclub where the Beatles got
their start.
   Among the many Lennon friends and followers present were Father
Tom McKenzie, immortalized as Father MacKenzie in The Beatles' 1966
hit song ``Eleanor Rigby.'' The slain rocker also had a plaque
dedicated Friday in his memory at the Beatles Museum in Liverpool.
   The Soviet TV evening news program ``Vremya'' also noted the
anniversary, showing videotape of Lennon fans laying memorial
flowers in Strawberry Fields. The program showed its weather
forecast to the tune of the Beatles' hit, ``Yesterday.''
   Providing the music in Strawberry Fields was Tom Hayes, 37,
whose black sweatshirt bore the words, ``John Lennon, 1940-1980.
Thanks.''
   ``I've been up the last two nights, making these tribute tapes -
six hours of Lennon, the Beatles. My wife thought I was nuts,''
said Hayes of Saddle Brook, N.J.
   Lennon's legacy of good will brought Hayes out early on an
overcast day to sit and listen to the music.
   ``Everything he stood for was good for the world. I'm here to
pay tribute to that. It's just a sad, sad day,'' he said.
   A half-dozen bouquets were left outside the Dakota before noon.
The flowers were brought inside and sent upstairs to Ono's
apartment, said one of the building's doormen. Outside, fans looked
at the spot where Lennon was shot and moved on.
   Lennon was returning home with Ono after a recording session
when Mark David Chapman, a fan who received the ex-Beatle's
autograph just hours before, shot and killed him.
   Chapman, who is serving 20 years to life at Attica State Prison
in New York, recently apologized for the killing.
   ``It was an end of innocence for that time and I regret being
the one who ended it,'' he said.

   Facing the threat of a U.S. veto, the
Security Council on Saturday postponed discussion of a resolution
calling for an eventual international peace conference on the
Middle East.
   Israel, the traditional U.S. ally in the region, strongly
opposes any international conference that would encompass the issue
of Palestinians in Israeli-occupied lands.
   The council voted 9-4 to adopt a Soviet motion to postpone
consideration of the resolution until Monday. The United States
voted in favor of postponement, while France and China abstained.
   When asked if an eventual U.S. veto was likely, the chief
spokesman for the U.S. Mission, Phil Arnold, said, ``That is my
impression.''
   A U.S. veto would anger America's Arab allies in the anti-Iraq
coalition assembled in the Persian Gulf, who feel just as strongly
about Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as they
do about Baghdad's seizure of Kuwait.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has linked a peaceful settlement
to the Persian Gulf crisis to a peace conference taking in the
Palestinian issue. But the United States has said the gulf crisis
cannot be tied to the Palestinian problem or any other issue.
   A veto by the United States or any of the other four permanent
security council members would kill the U.N. resolution, but most
other council members appear to support the measure.
   The resolution, sponsored by Yemen, Cuba, Malaysia and Colombia,
endorses the idea of a Middle East peace conference ``at an
appropriate time'' that would help achieve ``a comprehensive
settlement and lasting peace in the Middle East.''
   The United States has not vetoed a Security Council resolution
since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering met with Israeli Premier
Yitzhak Shamir just before the Security Council session began
Saturday. Shamir is on a U.S. visit, and is scheduled to meet with
President Bush on Tuesday.
   The council met in private session for hours Saturday evening,
with the United States trying to reach a last-minute compromise
with the non-aligned nations favoring the resolution.
   Diplomats said the United States was pushing for removal of
language endorsing a peace conference ``at the appropriate time,''
but the non-aligned nations insisted that it be left in. Some of
those nations support the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   U.S. policy has long called for a Middle East peace conference
at some appropriate future date, but the United States has always
blocked the Security Council from approving the idea by adopting
similar language.
   Earlier this week, however, the United States and the other
permanent council members approved of a draft resolution that would
let the Security Council consider adopting that position. But that
United States backed away from its earlier approval after issuing a
flurry of denials that it was trying to satisfy Saddam.
   ``Precisely because of our consistent position that we will not
link the gulf crisis and the Arab-Israeli dispute, this is
certainly not an appropriate time for an international
conference,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Thursday.

<HEAD>Wal-Mart Close to Surpassing Sears as Nation's Top Retailer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For Wal-Mart Stores Inc., it's one down
and one to go.
   The Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer slipped past Kmart in
November to become America's No. 2 retailer, according to sales
figures released this week. Now, industry analysts say that early
next year Wal-Mart will overtake Sears, Roebuck and Co. as the
nation's top retailer.
   Even Sears is conceding defeat.
   ``In terms of dollar signs, they will surpass us. There's no
doubt about it,'' Gordon Jones, a Sears spokesman, said Friday.
   The figures showed Chicago-based Sears with $27.48 billion in
sales for the first 10 months of 1990. Wal-Mart sales for the same
period were $25.46 billion. But Wal-Mart's growth rate was 25
percent, while Sears grew at just 2.1 percent.
   Kmart's sales for the first 10 months of the year totaled $25.2
billion.
   Analysts say Wal-Mart's strong growth rate will allow the
discount retailer to bump Sears for the No. 1 spot.
   Wal-Mart probably will fall $500 million or $1 billion short of
Sears by Jan. 31, the close of Wal-Mart's fiscal year, said Stacy
Dutton, an analyst with Morgan Stanley and Co. in New York.
   ``But then next year, it's all Wal-Mart,'' Ms. Dutton predicted.
   Sears will have about $32.5 billion in revenues from domestic
and foreign merchandising and credit for this current fiscal year,
she said. Wal-Mart will total about $31.5 billion to $32 billion
this fiscal year, she said.
   ``It will be real close, but clearly next year, Wal-Mart will
surpass Sears, especially with the acquisitions they've made,''
said Craig Weichmann, an analyst with Morgan Keegan and Co. in
Memphis.
   Last month Wal-Mart announced it planned to buy The Wholesale
Club Inc. In October it said it would acquire McLane Co. Inc., the
country's sixth-largest grocery distributor.
   Wal-Mart officially passed Kmart as the No. 2 retailer in the
country in November, with $25.46 billion in sales for 10 months
compared with Kmart's $25.2 billion.

   ``This is just another ploy that he's trying to use to drag
things out and to avoid serious - seriously facing up to what the

adviser Brent Scowcroft, saying he believes Saddam Hussein prefers
talks with Secretary of State James A. Baker III to occur as close
as possible to the Jan. 15 U.N. deadline.

<HEAD>Cuban Novelist Reinaldo Arenas Commits Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reinaldo Arenas, a novelist who spent several
years in prison in Fidel Castro's Cuba and was suffering from AIDS,
took his own life at the age of 47, authorities said.
   Arenas' body was found in his Manhattan apartment on Friday
afternoon by a nurse who had been taking care of him, said police
spokesman Sgt. Ed Burns.
   Burns said there were no obvious wounds on the body and that the
medical examiner would determine the precise cause of death, but
that police had speculated he had overdosed on drugs.
   He said Arenas left a note but he did not know what was in it.
   Arenas was born in the rural Oriente province of Cuba. He joined
the revolution led by Castro as a teen-ager, then worked as a
researcher in the Jose Marti National Library from 1963 to 1968.
   His first novel ``Singing From the Well'' won the Prix Medici in
France for the best foreign novel of 1969.
   Arenas said he was branded a social misfit in Cuba because of
his homosexuality. He spent time in a labor camp, cutting sugar
cane, and was imprisoned from 1974 to 1976 after he was accused of
being a counterrevolutionary.
   He wrote his poem ``El Central'' while in the labor camp, about
a sugar mill that he said represents the history of slavery and
forced labor in Cuba.
   His second novel, ``Hallucinations,'' was never published in
Cuba and his subsequent manuscripts were periodically confiscated
by the police.
   He escaped to the United States in 1980 during the exodus of
more than 125,000 Cubans from the port of Mariel.
   ``El Central'' was published in the United States in 1984, and
``Hallucinations'' was reprinted in a new translation in 1987 under
the title, ``The Ill-Fated Peregrinations of Fray Sergando.'' That
same year, Arenas published ``The Graveyard of the Angels.''
   He wrote ``Farewell to the Sea'' while in prison and then
rewrote it after it was confiscated. It was published in the United
States in 1985.
   Reviewing the book in The New York Times, Jay Cantor wrote:
``Mr. Arenas is not interested in ordinary realistic drama. He
wants to give the reader the secret history of the emotions, the
sustaining victories of pleasure and the small dishonesties that
callous the soul.''
   Viking plans to publish three more novels by Arenas, as well as
his autobiography, ``Before Night Falls.''
   Grove Weidenfeld is scheduled to publish another novel, ``The
Doorman,'' in the spring.
   Arenas is survived by his mother, who lives in Cuba.

<HEAD>Newsweek Poll: Majority Now Support Military Action Against Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 56 percent majority of Americans now support
military action against Iraq to settle the Persian Gulf crisis, a
Newsweek poll released Saturday shows.
   But nearly as many - 53 percent, prefer to wait for the Jan. 15
deadline set by the United Nations to see if diplomacy and economic
sanctions work.
   The poll's results were uneven when gender was considered. Sixty
percent of women surveyed favor waiting past the Jan. 15 deadline
for war, compared with 44 percent of the men.
   And 68 percent of the men supported President Bush's handling of
the crisis, compared with 53 percent of the women.
   In the survey of 769 adults conducted by the Gallup
organization, 60 percent said Iraq's release of all U.S. hostages
would not influence their decision to support or protest military
action.
   The government of Iraq, whose forces invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2,
decided last week that all foreign hostages caught in that country
and Kuwait would be freed. Among more than 8,000 stranded
foreigners are 900 Americans.
   Different age groups in the poll feel differently about
supporting war as a means to end the crisis. The older the
respondents, the less enthusiasm they displayed for war, the poll
showed.
   Those aged 18 to 29 were split down the middle, with 50 percent
favoring war to end the crisis. That compared to 48 percent
favoring war among those 30 to 49 years old and 33 percent among
those 50 or older.
   Approval for Bush's policy in the gulf was 60 percent, up from
57 percent in mid-November, the poll found.
   About 54 percent of those polled said they believe Democrats
taking issue with Bush's handling of the crisis are trying to make
it a partisan political issue.
   The overall approval rating for the president continued to
climb. It is now at 63 percent, up from 58 percent in mid-November
and 48 percent in October, the poll showed.
   The poll was conducted Dec. 6 and 7. It has a margin error of
plus or minus 4 percentage points.

   Iraq has redrawn its border with Kuwait in what
could signal plans to withdraw as early as next month, a newspaper
reported Sunday.
   The Observer, in a story from Washington, said Iraq was laying
claim to an area of the Rumaila oilfield and the islands of Warba
and Bubiyan in the Persian Gulf.
   ``Most Arab governments expect Iraq to withdraw from the rest of
Kuwait in late January ... but completion of the new border fence
may imply an even earlier withdrawal,'' said the report, citing
unidentified Arab sources in Washington.
   The report said Iraq has constructed a new international line by
building a barbed-wire fence around the southern tip of the
oilfield, which extends into northern Kuwait. Iraq has claimed the
area.
   The newspaper said some information for the report came from an
unidentified source who attended the recent Baghdad talks between
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, King Hussein of Jordan and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
   The Observer said Ali al-Sabah, a counselor at the Kuwaiti
embassy in London, confirmed that his exiled government in Saudi
Arabia had received reports of the fence.
   Al-Sabah could not be reached for comment early Sunday.

   Several thousand anti-war demonstrators, chanting
slogans and carrying placards and cardboard coffins, thronged a
downtown square Saturday to protest U.S. policy in the Persian
Gulf.
   ``No blood for oil,'' they yelled between speeches condemning
the troop buildup in Saudi Arabia and exhorting fellow
demonstrators around the country to prepare for a Jan. 26 march on
Washington.
   ``We are going to turn this system upside down,'' said Kim
Feicke, a Northwestern University student who spoke on behalf of
the National Students and Youth Campaign for Peace in the Middle
East.
   Smaller demonstrations were held Saturday in Washington, New
York, Milwaukee, Cambridge, Mass., and Columbus, Ohio.
   Thousands of people kicked off several days of planned protests
against violence in the Persian Gulf with demonstrations Friday in
Massachusetts, Wisconsin and Seattle; Austin, Texas; and Lincoln,
Neb.
   Some activists traveled hundreds of miles from around the
Midwest to Chicago, representing peace groups in Indiana, Iowa,
Ohio, Missouri and Wisconsin, organizers said.
   Six people from the Alliance to Save Ourselves in Madison, Wis.,
carried a black cardboard coffin draped with an American flag as
``a symbolic warning'' of the consequences of war, said one of
them, Brian Rakita.
   A row of white body bags were laid out near the podium,
symbolizing the lives that could be lost if the standoff leads to
war.
   The rally at Daley Plaza included a march through the downtown
business district that stopped traffic at several intersections. No
arrests were reported.
   Rep. Charles Hayes, D-Ill., said that as soon as all U.S.
hostages held by Iraq are released, President Bush should bring the
soldiers home, too.
   ``Our need for health care, our need for housing - these are the
kinds of things we need to do with our tight dollars,'' Hayes said.
   Twenty-three Americans flew out of Iraq on Saturday, the first
to depart since the Baghdad government announced it would free all
its foreign captives. Bush, in Venezuela, welcomed the move to free
the captives, but said Iraq still must get out of Kuwait, which it
overran Aug. 2.

   Both sides in the Daily News strike said
Saturday they hoped a federal mediator could help end the bitter
six-week-old walkout. A union lawyer called the offer to mediate
``the last clear chance for a settlement.''
   Newspaper spokesman John Sloan said management on Monday would
contact Bernard D. DeLury, the director of the Federal Mediation
and Conciliation Service. DeLury called the newspaper and its nine
striking unions on Friday and offered to mediate in Washington.
   ``We consider this a step forward in the negotiation process and
are hopeful that a swift resolution of the strike will be
possible,'' Sloan said. ``We've agreed to fully cooperate.''
   Theodore W. Kheel, a lawyer advising the unions, called the
offer ``the last clear chance for a settlement.''
   Sloan said DeLury wanted separate meetings with News' management
and the unions. However, George McDonald, president of the Allied
Printing Trades Council, an umbrella group for the striking unions,
said a joint meeting would be necessary if a settlement was to be
reached.
   Union leaders fear that the Tribune Co. of Chicago, which owns
the News, would soon close the paper if the mediation attempt
fails.
   Sloan said the parent company would review the Daily News'
situation during a board meeting Tuesday, but said he was confident
the Tribune Co. would continue to support the paper.
   Meanwhile Saturday, police reported several strike-related
incidents in the metropolitan area.
   In Warwick, north of the city, three Daily News replacement
drivers were each charged Saturday with gun possession, police
said.
   Sloan said the men do not work for the newspaper
   ``They are employed by one of our many wholesale distributors,''
he said. ``The only connection is that they were driving a Daily
News truck, which they leased from the Daily News.''
   Earlier the same day, a News deliverer was robbed of $380 in
Brooklyn. Police said a gang told the man not to deliver the papers
and he gave them an envelope containing the money.
   The strike by 2,300 of the paper's 3,500 employees began Oct.
25. Many of the strikers spent Saturday planning a rally scheduled
for Sunday afternoon in front of the News building.

   Actress Joan Bennett, whose 50-year
career took her from innocent blonde roles to sultry temptress
parts on television, stage and screen, died Friday. She was 80.
   Bennett, who lived in Scarsdale, was declared dead on arrival at
White Plains Hospital, said nursing supervisor Laura Siebert. She
died of a heart attack, said her daughter, Shelley Wanger.
   Bennett, who lived in Scarsdale, made her acting debut in 1928
alongside her father, Richard Bennett, in the Broadway play
``Jarnegan.''
   Among her 75 film credits since 1933 are the classic ``Little
Women,'' in which she played one of the sisters opposite Katherine
Hepburn.
   In ``Father of the Bride,'' Bennett played a nurturing mother,
shedding the husky voiced presence she had developed for Fritz
Lang's thriller films. In the 1951 comedy ``Father's Little
Dividend,'' she starred opposite Elizabeth Taylor and Spencer
Tracy.
   The same year, her then-husband, producer Walter Wanger, shot

   Martin Ritt, the maverick director
of ``Norma Rae,'' ``The Front'' and ``The Long Hot Summer'' who
once was blacklisted in Hollywood, died Saturday of complications
from heart disease.
   The director of 25 films and 250 television shows died at Santa
Monica Hospital Medical Center, said Chuck Warn, spokesman for the
Directors Guild of America. Details on the cause of death were not
given.
   His family said he was 76 years old, Warn said, but studio and
other biographies list him as 70.
   Ritt, who lived in Pacific Palisades, never shied from
controversial issues, such as racial prejudice in ``Sounder,''
blacklisting in ``The Front,'' and labor rights in ``The Molly
Maguires'' and ``Norma Rae.''
   Ritt worked on live television shows until he was blacklisted in
the 1950s.
   He made his first feature, ``Edge of the City,'' with Sidney
Poitier in 1957. One year later, he filmed Faulkner's ``The Long
Hot Summer'' and ``The Sound and the Fury.''
   Both films were adapted by his most frequent collaborators,
Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr., who also worked with Ritt on
``Hombre,'' ``Hud,'' ``Norma Rae'' and ``Murphy's Romance.''

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters on Saturday narrowly rejected a referendum
designed to help minorities win seats on the Dallas City Council by
creating a system of 14 single-member districts with a mayor
elected at large.
   With all the precincts tallied, the measure received 45,624 no
votes, or 50.2 percent, and 45,255 yes votes, or 49.8 percent, a
margin of just 369 against the referendum.
   Voter turnout was reported to be light across the city.
   ``I think everybody is out doing everything else,'' said Mark
Rupe, a precinct worker in east Dallas, said on Saturday afternoon.
``Since it's on a Saturday, they have everything else on their
mind.
   ``People might say, `Well, I really don't know what this is all
about,' and decide to go fishing,'' he said.
   Supporters of the proposal to create single-member districts say
the plan would have helped ease racial inequities that make it
difficult for minorities to get elected.
   Opponents say the referendum would resegregate Dallas. They back
a plan voters approved last year that called for some candidates to
be elected by district, others by region and one at large.
   Under the system instituted in 197, eight council members are
elected in individual districts and another three, including the
mayor, are elected by voters citywide.
   The system voters approved in August 1989 called for 10
candidates to be chosen by district, four by region and one at
large. But that system was never implemented because a federal
judge suggested he would rule it unconstitutional.
   Saturday's referendum was held as part of the settlement of a
1988 federal lawsuit brought by Roy Williams and Marvin Crenshaw,
who failed in their at-large council bids. The men, both black,
charged the existing election system made it difficult for
minorities to win election.
   Black and Hispanic leaders nationwide have long charged that
at-large elections dilute minority candidates' political power and
make it difficult for them to win office.
   They maintain minorities have a better chance of winning office
under a political system in which candidates are elected by
individual districts.
   Although minorities are estimated to make up more than half the
city's population, only two of 11 City Council members are black.
None are Hispanic.
   Only one minority, a Hispanic who no longer serves on the
council, has won an at-large City Council election.
   If the plan had been approved, a commission would have been set
up to draw new district lines next year, using 1990 Census figures.
   In the 1980 Census, Dallas' racial makeup consisited of 61
percent white, 26 percent black and 12 percent Hispanic. But a
breakdown of the 1990 Census of 982,250 people is expected to show
a majority black and Hispanic population.

   President Bush believes the threat of
war in the Persian Gulf remains strong, even though Iraq's decision
to release all American and other foreign hostages is a step
forward, his spokesman says.
   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, accompanying Bush on his South
America tour, said Friday night that the United Nations resolution
authorizing use of force against Iraq motivated Saddam Hussein to
reassess his position on the hostages.
   ``It forced Saddam to make concrete changes,'' Fitzwater said.
   He added, however, that Bush is no less adamant than before in
his demand that Iraq fulfill the U.N. Security Council resolution
requiring that the Iraqi leader withdraw his forces from Kuwait.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Sears led the way as retailers nationwide
slashed prices and launched big advertising campaigns in hopes of
brightening what looks to be a gloomy Christmas shopping season.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. began an aggressive nationwide television

clothing and incentives like no-interest financing on major
appliances.
   The company is advertising ``after-Christmas prices just in time
for Christmas.''
   Sears and other big national retailers announced Thursday that
their sales fell in November from last year's levels as consumers
translated worries about the economy and the Middle East into
reduced holiday spending.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The United States will speed millions of

said to have used computer-aided Soviet missiles to shoot down two
Salvadoran warplanes.
   Bush administration officials said a spent canister from an
advanced Soviet-made, A-14 surface-to-air missile has been found
near the area where one of the aircraft was destroyed.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Friday that
the $48.1 million in aid, approved by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, will allow the Salvadoran government to replace
equipment, including planes, damaged or destroyed in the rebel
attacks that began Nov. 20.
   The attacks have caused some 500 casualties in seven of the
Central American country's 14 provinces, officials said, adding
that the dead and injured include government troops, FMLN
guerrillas and Salvadoran civilians.

   The astronauts have had to scrap more than a third of 250
planned observations of galaxies, supernovas and other objects
because of problems with NASA's Astro Observatory.
   Scientists sayd the project appeared to be back on track Friday
and they were excited about results so far.
   ``We just keep coming back,'' said Chris Anderson, a member of

``We've worked together ... in bringing this thing back from what

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A genetically engineered hormone that forces
cows to give more milk and calves to grow faster poses no health
hazard to humans who eat the products from treated herds, a
government committee concludes.
   The panel's findings were announced Friday at a news conference
that was interrupted repeatedly by protestors who shouted questions
and attempted to make speeches about the hormone, called
recombinant bovine somatotropin, or BST.
   Dr. Melvin M. Grumbach of San Francisco, chairman of the
13-member committee convened by the National Institutes of Health,
said that following three days of intensive review of research on
the hormone, the panel agreed unanimously that milk and meat from
BST-treated cows is safe for humans.
   The committee also decided, however, that more research was
needed to determine the effects of the hormone on a dairy cow
disorder, and to search for possible effects on the human digestive
tract of a tiny elevation of a growth factor in the stimulated
milk.

   CHICAGO (AP) - Music may soothe listeners, but it can be murder
on the players. Bruised lips, sore hands and ringing ears are
dangerous occupational hazards for musicians, and other performers
suffer too.
   Many doctors don't see it that way, says Dr. Alice G.
Brandfonbrener, director of the Medical Program for Performing
Artists.
   The sore neck of a violin player, injuries actors suffer during
stage fighting or a singer's lung pangs are hardly emergencies, but
they are typical of serious pains that can affect performers'
livelihoods, she said Friday.
   ``Musicians' problems are not obvious, most of them, and have
been kind of dismissed by physicians in the past as being part of
the neurosis of the musician and, therefore, not real,'' said
Brandfonbrener, whose program is one of about 18 similar efforts
nationwide.

   A major airline filed for bankruptcy protection,
the unemployment rate jumped and retail sales stagnated.
   If not for AT&amp;T's good, old-fashioned takeover war with NCR
Corp., you'd think it was just another bad news week in the
business world.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s unsolicited bid for NCR was
certainly no fun for the old cash register maker. But it was a
mildly positive sign for the credit-squeezed economy.
   After the friendly bid turned hostile during the week, AT&amp;T
unveiled a plan for bank financing to be led by Chemical Banking
Corp., which committed $600 million toward a $6 billion pot.
   AT&amp;T expected little difficulty raising the rest from a group of
45 other big banks.
   While no one was predicting a return to the heady days of the
1980s, the availability of cash for such deals raised spirits on
Wall Street. The AT&amp;T proposal followed by a week the announcement
of a $6.6 billion acquisition of MCA Inc. by Japan's Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co.
   The moves clearly demonstrated that some big companies still
have - or can raise - the cash for strategic deals, even in bad
times.
   The AT&amp;T-NCR fight broke out last Sunday when Ma Bell disclosed
its $90-per-share offer for NCR, which has become a rising star in
the computer business.
   AT&amp;T, needing to rescue its own failed attempts in the computer
field, had tried to woo NCR through a series of contacts in
November. A deal for $85 per share was rejected, leading to the $90
bid, to be accomplished by trading AT&amp;T stock for NCR shares.
   Although it represented a 25 percent premium over NCR's peak
stock price over the past six months, the $90-per-share deal was
rejected by NCR's board at midweek. The company called the figure
inadequate, but said it would be willing to talk turkey at $125 per
share.
   AT&amp;T, calling that suggestion outrageous, chose to bypass NCR
executives and take its case directly to the company's shareholders
in the form a tender offer of $90 cash for each share of NCR,
expiring Jan. 4.
   Early in the week, the two companies were exchanging cordial
correspondence (``Dear Bob'' and ``Dear Chuck'' topped the letters
from NCR chief Charles Exley and AT&amp;T boss Robert Allen). But by
the end of the week, Exley had coined a new advertisting slogan for
his pursuer: ``Reach Out and Grab Someone.''

<HEAD>LOOSER CREDIT: Fed Takes a Step to Help Banks</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   As one of the nation's most creditworthy corporations, AT&amp;T
would likely command a fat credit line regardless of the times. But
the Federal Reserve's actions during the week suggested a more
generalized warming trend in the lending arena.
   On Tuesday, the central bank said it would lower requirements
for banks to keep cash on hand to meet depositor demands, which
theoretically could result in easier credit terms for corporate
borrowers.
   At least it could reduce costs to the banks and bolster their
earnings.
   Experts said the move, the first of its kind in seven years,
also could give the economy a boost in the long run.
   On Friday, the Fed took another move aimed at easing credit by
injecting cash into the banking system. In addition, a handful of
small banks trimmed their prime lending rates a quarter percentage
point to 9} percent.

<HEAD>ECONOMY: Bad News Builds a Case</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Numbers on the state of the economy built the case for a rate
cut.
   The Fed's move on Friday followed an extremely weak employment
report from the Labor Department, which showed a 0.2 percent
increase in the national jobless rate to 5.9 percent.
   Other reports offered more strong evidence that a recession was
taking hold.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said its index
of manufacturing strength sank for the fifth consecutive month to
its lowest point since the 1982 recession.
   The nation's automakers said sales of domestically built cars
and light trucks plummeted 20.4 percent in late November.
   Some major retailers said their November sales ran behind levels
of a year ago, indicating holiday shopping got off to a rocky
start. One big toy retailer, Child World, said it would slash
prices to salvage the season.
   Figures for construction spending were up in October on the
strength of public works projects. But residential building was
down, and sales of new homes dipped to their lowest level in eight
years.
   The American Bankers Association said consumers continued to pay
bills in the July-September quarter, but were scaling back new
borrowing.
   An index based on help-wanted advertising fell in October
reinforcing the gloomy employment outlook.
   A regular survey of regional economic conditions by the Federal
Reserve found business conditions weakening across the country.
   As the hard evidence of recession mounted, some observers blamed
the messengers. Economists at Bear Stearns, a major brokerage
house, said investors were unnecessarily spooked by stories in the
financial press.

<HEAD>COMPANIES: Continental Joins Eastern In Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   There was still plenty of bad news to report, however.
   In contrast to the forward march of AT&amp;T, Continental Airlines
retreated to the shelter of bankruptcy court.
   The move put the entire airline empire built by Frank Lorenzo
into Chapter 11. Sister Eastern Airlines has been flying under
court supervision since a strike in March 1989.
   Continental's filing was the first bankruptcy move by an airline
since the big jump in fuel prices caused by the Persian Gulf
crisis. But experts said Continental's problems were mostly caused
by the huge debts rolled up during Lorenzo's expansion moves in the
1980s.
   Court documents revealed most of Continental's unsecured
creditors were holders of the company's junk bonds.

stock market and a corresponding drop in oil futures prices.
   Oil for next month delivery dropped below $30 per barrel to its
lowest level since August, when the crisis began.
