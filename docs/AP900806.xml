<HEAD>Thousands of Banana Workers End Strike Against Chiquita Brands</HEAD>

   Thousands of workers returned to
their jobs Monday after ending a 7-week-old strike against U.S.
banana giant Chiquita Brands that caused an estimated $60 million
in losses to the Honduran economy.
   Threatened with dismissal after the government sent in troops to
end the strike, the banana workers accepted a 25 percent pay hike
Sunday and agreed to return to work. The strikers had earlier
demanded a 60 percent raise.
   Activity in the fields and installations owned by
Cincinnati-based Chiquita Brands International Inc. appeared normal
Monday morning for the first time since 10,000 banana workers
walked out on June 25.
   ``We did not achieve our demands, but we are satisfied,'' union
president Rene Ayestas said.
   Hundreds of troops and police remained at Chiquita's facilities
in the city of La Lima, 180 miles north of the capital, Tegucigalpa.
   Government spokesman Martin Baide Urmeneta said the army will
stay in La Lima ``until the situation is normal.''
   Police said five people, including two workers and three
security policemen, were injured when troops and police moved in
Saturday to dislodge 4,000 strikers who were occupying company
property in La Lima.
   On Sunday, the strikers announced they had accepted ``without
any conditions'' a proposal by President Rafael Leonardo Callejas
that would raise the minimum monthly salary from $246 to $308.50.
   Callejas had proposed the settlement on July 28, but it was
rejected by the union. The company rejected the union's
counter-proposal, and the impasse led Callejas to send in the
troops.
   Ayestas said Callejas' measures to end the strike were ``drastic
and incorrect.''
   Callejas, in a nationwide radio and television address Sunday,
said the strikers had ``dragged the country toward social and
economic destabilization'' and ``threatened to destroy the
democratic process in Honduras.''
   ``There are no winners or losers,'' Callejas said. ``The
situation was overcome so that we can face the enormous problems
that afflict the nation.''
   Chiquita produces and exports 60 percent of Honduras' banana
crop, the country's main source of foreign exchange, and
preliminary government estimates said the strike caused $60 million
in losses.

<HEAD>Sen. Graham Says He Never Influenced Bank Regulators in CenTrust
Seizure</HEAD>

   A former aide in Sen. Bob Graham's office said
Monday he had arranged a meeting between bank regulators and
Centrust Bank, which later failed causing the biggest bailout of
the savings and loan crisis.
   NBC News reported Monday that the aide, Steve Josias, had used
his position as a special counsel in Graham's office to bring
pressure on bank regulators looking into the thrift's finances.
   But Josias denied the report and Graham's office said the
Democratic senator had had no knowledge of the meeting.
   Josias' Fort Lauderdale firm had handled some real estate
matters for CenTrust before the 1987 meeting with officials from
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said Ken Klein, Graham's
spokesman.
   The day after the meeting, Graham's office manager met with
Josias to tell him such a meeting was against the senator's policy,
Klein said. Graham himself did not learn of the meeting until
earlier in 1990 and characterized it as poor judgment, Klein said.
   ``We do not seek to intervene with regulators on specific
cases,'' Klein said.
   Graham, a member of the Senate banking committee, said in an
interview from his Washington, D.C., office he had done nothing to
delay the seizure of the Miami-based thrift by the government. The
CenTrust bailout will cost taxpayers $1.7 billion.
   ``I would say categorically (my office) did not have any effect
on any action by federal regulators that would have affected their
decisions,'' Graham said.
   Josias told The Associated Press that NBC's report was
``ludicrous.'' He described himself as ``merely a convener'' of the
30-minute meeting. CenTrust officials called it because they felt
federal officials were failing to respond to questions on
regulatory procedures, he said.
   Josias worked in Graham's office for six months as special
counsel, providing legal expertise, Klein said.
   ``When lawyers called (Graham's office), they were given to the
lawyer,'' Josias said, when asked about the CenTrust call that led
to the meeting. ``I should have said then that I know CenTrust and
my legal firm did work for them.''
   When regulators seized CenTrust in February, they blamed its
failure on speculative investing, including purchase of more than
$1 billion in junk bonds.
   They also cited the lavish spending of the institution's
chairman, David L. Paul, who spent millions of dollars of deposits
on a museum-quality art collection kept at his home; a company
yacht, limousines, a corporate jet and gold-plated toilets in the
executive washrooms. Paul has declined comment about CenTrust and
its seizure.
   A ``fraud squad'' of investigators is examining the legality of
$328,000 in political contributions by Paul.
   Graham said he has never received political contributions from
Paul or any CenTrust political action committees.

<HEAD>Suit Filed Against Hanford Contractors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A lawsuit filed Monday against 13
contractors at the Hanford nuclear reservation claims people
working at and living around the plant were hurt by the reckless
release of radiation and toxic chemicals.
   The class-action suit filed in U.S. District Court seeks
unspecified damages for health threats and reduced property values,
said Tom Foulds, who heads a team of lawyers on the project.
   Twenty-one people were named as plaintiffs, but the number of
people affected could eventually reach 5,000, according to the suit.
   It claims that exposure to high doses of radiation and toxic
chemicals and hazardous storage conditions have caused death,
disease, disfigurement, miscarriages, birth defects and infertility
and sterility.
   ``The thrust of the suit is for recovery for personal injuries
and other bodily damage that already has been done,'' Foulds said.
``But the subclasses mention damage to property arising out of the
possibility of explosion and continuing operations. We are trying
to get the hazards abated and removed.''
   The suit seeks an abatement order against the companies,
requiring them to remove and clean up any continuing contamination,
underground storage tanks, radioactive sediments in the Columbia
River and to establish a fund for monitoring health effects.
   Two federal studies are attempting to determine the health
effects of Hanford operations and the state and two federal
agencies have signed a 30-year, $57 billion cleanup pact.
   The partial results of a study released last month indicated a
potential for increased thyroid diseases among people living
downwind of the 560-square-mile government plutonium-production
facility.
   ``This lawsuit came to a head when the dose reconstruction
report was made,'' Foulds said `` ... Once that came out, it seemed
to verify a lot of very strong indications I had already received
during my research.''
   The suit does not name the government agencies that contracted
Hanford operations _ the Department of Energy and its predecessor,
the Atomic Energy Commission _ because the government's immunity
from tort claims would make it difficult to win, Foulds said.
   ``It was clear to us we should try to go after the contractors
that ran this. They don't enjoy the same immunity unless they can
show they complied with all the applicable government
regulations,'' Foulds said. ``I don't think they can prove that.
There is a clear pattern of failure and violations.''
   Bill Whiting, a spokesman for Westinghouse Hanford Co., the
reservation's current prime contractor, said company attorneys had
not seen the lawsuit and could not comment. Attempts to reach
attorneys for other corporations after normal business hours were
unsuccessful.
   The lawsuit accuses past and present Hanford contractors
``carelessly, intentionally, recklessly and unlawfully'' allowed
the releases of radioactive and non-radioactive materials.
   The Hanford reservation was begun in top secrecy as part of the
Manhattan Project that produced nuclear materials for the atomic
bombs that ended World War II.
   The lawsuit was filed on the 45th anniversary of the atomic
bombing of Hiroshima, which killed at least 140,000 people.
   Documents released since 1986 show a pattern of intentional and
accidental releases of large amounts of radiation and hazardous
wastes into the air, soil and water from Hanford operations.

   For two years, a city within a city lived
and grew in the shadow of City Hall.
   Then one morning in July, buses pulled up to Civic Center Plaza
to take away the homeless people who camped under knobby-branched
olive trees amid mildewed mattresses, tattered blankets and
shopping carts heaped with the eclectic possessions of modern
nomads.
   The homeless and their advocates decried the city's
insensitivity.
   ``It's not that they care about these people not having homes,''
said Jill, 28, who had been bouncing in and out of welfare hotels
with her boyfriend, Ron, for six months. ``They just don't want
them to be seen.''
   But Mayor Art Agnos said he does care. That's why he allowed the
homeless to live in the park while he arranged a ``humane
alternative'': two full-service shelters equipped with everything
from job training to drug counseling, facilities designed to ease
people off the street for good.
   In cities across the nation, city officials and advocates for
the homeless talk about how public emotion _ hostility and
compassion, frustration and sympathy _ has escalated as the ranks
of the homeless swell.
   ``People are frustrated it's not over. We're into quick fixes,''
said Mary Ann Gleason, director of the Denver Healthcare for the
Homeless Clinic, which serves about 6,500 people a year. ``There
are hundreds of thousands of people we've gotten off the streets,
but there are more falling in behind them.''
   No one knows how many Americans are homeless. Estimates range
from 300,000 to 3 million. But no one disputes the fact that the
number is increasing, and greater numbers mean greater visibility.
   ``It's a common perception that at least among some parts of
society, there's not only less compassion but more organized
hostility'' toward the homeless, said Gary Blasi, president of the
National Coalition for the Homeless and a Legal Aid Foundation
attorney in Los Angeles, a city with a homeless population
estimated at more than 150,000.
   ``A large part of the source of the hostility is that it's not
great to have a lot of homeless people around when you're a tourist
city,'' Blasi said. ``It's not just the cable cars and the Golden
Gate anymore.''
   What passes for heartlessness often is case of empty municipal
pockets, with compassionate programs succumbing to financial
pressures. The city council in Washington, faced with a $95 million
budget deficit, voted in June to gut its policy of guaranteeing
overnight shelter to anyone who requested it. That ordinance was
championed by the late homeless activist Mitch Snyder and passed
six years ago by more than 70 percent of the vote.
   In Philadelphia, 80 members of the Mayor's Public-Private Task
Force on Homelessness resigned in July to protest massive cuts in
the city's budget for homeless services after the amount dropped
from $34 million to $10 million in two years. At the same time, the
city plans to spend $1 million closing off spaces under train
platforms in a downtown station where people like to sleep.
   ``I see no abatement whatsoever in people's concern, people
calling, people coming in, people of all ages making an effort and
reaching out,'' said Phyllis Ryan, director of the Philadelphia
Committee for the Homeless and one of the former task force
members. ``The government resources have just not been sufficient.
I think they just looked out there and decided who's a voter and
who isn't.''
   In some places, voters aggravated by the homeless problem are
using their electoral clout to protest. Residents in Santa Monica,
Calif., have collected thousands of signatures to place a
proposition on the November ballot to make the city attorney's
office an elected one. The current city attorney, Robert Myers, has
refused to prosecute people for sleeping outdoors.
   ``I think there's an increasing feeling of helplessness,'' said
Barbara Stinchfield, Santa Monica's community development manager.
``We get proposals weekly ... on how to solve the homeless problem.
It's frustrating, it's troubling, it's unsettling, it's not getting
better. But most people are not reacting in a really destructive
way.''
   Citizens in Santa Cruz, Calif., took their anger to the streets.
When 200 homeless activists rallied outside the Santa Cruz County
Courthouse demanding an end to the city's camping ban, they were
outnumbered by 600 counterdemonstrators who said they were tired of
giving ``bums'' and ``squatters'' a free ride in the seaside town
about 75 miles south of San Francisco.
   ``I think what happened in Santa Cruz and San Francisco has to
do with something much bigger than homelessness,'' Gleason said.
   The American public, she believes, feels angry but helpless over
things like the HUD scandal and the savings-and-loan bailout: ``I
think people are feeling so frustrated from being bamboozled and
taken advantage of on every front, homelessness gets lumped in with
the rest of it. It's very easy to take your anger out on the poor.''
   It's more difficult to find effective solutions to the problem,
but citizens in Seattle are trying, said Martha Dilts, executive
director of Seattle Emergency Housing Service.
   Seattle residents are trying to raise $1 million for
transitional housing for homeless families, and a local real estate
company's agents are donating part of their commissions to fight
homelessness.
   ``I see people starting to realize that homelessness is
affecting more people, that it could happen to your family or your
neighbor. There's a feeling of community and a sense of `We can do
it,''' said Dilts, a member of the governor's homeless task force.
   Advocates agree that homelessness will persist until society
deals with the lack of affordable housing, access to drug treatment
and mental health facilities and absence of affordable childcare
and other support services for the working poor. Meanwhile, cities
are eing forced to expand and improve shelter facilities, something
many communities are loathe to do.
   Although Washington has been under court order to expand its
shelter system, council members say neighborhoods will not accept
one without a fight. In one area, a homeless man's arrest on murder
charges galvanized the neighbors; they held bake sales to finance
their effort to close the shelter in which he lived.
   In a suburban Westchester County, N.Y., community, neighbors
have filed five lawsuits to try to stop construction of a 108-unit
complex for homeless women and children. In a San Jose, Calif.,
neighborhood, residents are fighting a homeless shelter they
believe is responsible for a 120 percent increase in felonies in
their area.
   ``If there was a shred of sympathy in me before,'' one resident
said, ``after seeing this, I have lost all compassion.''
   Sometimes, however, neighbors find the cure far less painful
than they had anticipated. A project to help mentally ill homeless
women in Denver was welcomed into a neighborhood after residents'
fears were allayed by the project's planners. The house has been a
smashing, problem-free success: 78 percent of those who passed
through there in the first year now have homes, and neighbors now
drop by to donate lawn chairs and tomato plants.
   ``I don't think the American public knows what's going on in
homeless services today,'' Gleason said. ``Part of it is
misinformation, part of it is honest-to-God displaced anger. When
people understand both what the homeless reality is, and what we're
trying to do about it, it paints a whole different picture.''

   Transcript of President Bush's remarks upon
his arrival at the White House from Camp David on Sunday:
   BUSH: Well, I just wanted to fill you all in on the diplomatic
activity that is taking place, intensive diplomatic activity around
the world. I've got to go in now; I'm getting another call from
President Ozal of Turkey, with whom I have been in previous
conversation. Yesterday, I talked to him. I talked this morning to
Prime Minister Kaifu, and I applaud Japan's stance, cracking down
on the imports from Iraq. I just hung up, up there in Camp David,
talking with Prime Minister Mulroney.
   We're all in the same accord, he and President Mitterrand, with
whom I've spoken, Chancellor Kohl, Margaret Thatcher. And I think
the Alliance, the NATO Alliance, is thinking exactly the same way
on this. I also talked yesterday to Kuwait's Emir and gave him
certain assurances. What's emerging is nobody is _ seems to be
showing up as willing to accept anything less than total withdrawal
from Iraq _ from Kuwait of the Iraqi forces and no puppet regime.
We've been down that road, and there will be no puppet regime that
will be accepted by any countries that I'm familiar with. And there
seems to be a united front out there that says Iraq, having
committed brutal, naked aggression, ought to get out and that the _
this concept of their installing some puppet leaving behind will
not be acceptable.
   So, we're pushing forward on diplomacy. We've gotten _ tomorrow
I will meet here in Washington with the Secretary General of the
United Nations _ I mean the Secretary General of NATO _ and
Margaret Thatcher will be coming in here tomorrow, and I will be
continuing this diplomatic effort. And I'm sure you know of the
meeting I had in Camp David with some of our top military people,
and I will continue that kind of consultation as well.
   Question: How are you going to _ how are you going to keep the
puppet government from being accepted and installed? And are you
going to. ...
   BUSH: There is no intention on the part of any of these
countries to accept a puppet government, and that signal is going
out loud and clear to Iraq. And I will not discuss with you what my
options are or might be, but they're wide open, I can assure you of
that.
   Question: The Saudi Arabians and the Turks, have they _ have you
talked to Saudi Arabia and the Turks about turning off the oil
pipelines through their countries? And are they. ...
   BUSH: All options are open and there is a strong feeling on the
part of the NATO countries to whom I've talked, Turkey being one of
them, that we must have concerted, and I'd say, well, concerted
action to isolate Iraq economically. And you can ... you can just
assume from there that those matters are being considered.
   Question: Are the Saudis inclined to cut off the pipeline, Mr.
President?
   BUSH: I can't tell you the state of play. I've discussed this
with King Fahd and I _ whether I'll be talking to him again today,
I don't know. But I'm not going to characterize their position on
this. Let them speak for themselves.
   Yeah?
   Question: Mr. President, what is the situation on the ground? Do
the Iraqis appear to be dug in or are they readying. ...
   BUSH: Iraq lied once again. They said they were going to start
moving out today and we have no evidence that they're moving out.
   Question: Do we have evidence that there's 18 divisions, new
divisions coming in. ...
   BUSH: I'm not going to discuss the intelligence situation on the
ground right now, but I've not heard a figure of 18 new divisions
going in.
   Question: Have you given any. ...
   BUSH: Just a minute. Anne?
   Question: Are Americans in danger in Kuwait or other areas down
there? And can you. ...
   BUSH: I wouldn't want to say they're in danger, but I _ you know
how I feel about the protection of American life and willingness to
do whatever is necessary to protect it. But I don't have the
feeling that they're in imminent danger right now.
   Question: And the people who are now in control in Kuwait are
saying they may close some of the embassies in Kuwait City, that
they will regard any reaction against them as _ ``You should take
care if you have your nationals in our country.'' Isn't that a
threat?
   BUSH: I'm not trying to characterize threats. The threat is the
vicious aggression against Kuwait. And that speaks for itself. And
anything collaterally is just simply more indication that these are
outlaws _ international outlaws and renegades. And I want to see
the United Nations move soon with Chapter VII sanctions. And I want
to see the rest of the world join us, as they are in overwhelming
numbers, to isolate Saddam Hussein.
   Question: Mr. President, how can you and other world leaders
prevent the installation of what you've termed a ``puppet''
government?
   BUSH: Just wait. Watch and learn.
   Yeah?
   Question: Mr. President, have you, in fact, tried to reach
Saddam Hussein since you're calling all these other people?
   BUSH: No. No, I have not.
   Question: King Hussein has embraced him.
   Question: Mr. President, have we asked the Saudi Arabians for
the use of their military bases?
   BUSH: Hmm?
   Question: Have we asked the Saudi Arabians. ...
   BUSH: I'm not going to discuss what I'm talking to the Saudis
about. I'm not going to discuss anything to do about military
options at all.
   Yeah?
   Question: Mr. President, have you talked to King Hussein of
Jordan
   since he indicated his support. ...
   BUSH: I talked to him once and that's all.
   Question: Are you disappointed in what he said?
   Question: But he's embraced Saddam Hussein. He went to Baghdad
and
   embraced. ...
   BUSH: What's your question? I can read.
   Question: Are you disappointed in what King Hussein said?
   BUSH: I want to see the Arab states join the rest of the world
in condemning this outrage and doing what they can to get Saddam
Hussein out. Now, he was talking _ King Hussein _ about an Arab
solution, but I am disappointed to find any comment by anyone that
apologizes or appears to condone what's taken place.
   Question: Is Secretary Cheney going to Saudi Arabia?
   BUSH: I'm not going to comment on anything that we're doing of
that nature.
   Question: Mr. President, are you disappointed in the failure of
the Arab _ other Arab nations to make more progress toward
resolving the situation?
   BUSH: Well, I was told by one leader that I respect enormously _
I believe this was back on Friday _ that they needed 48 hours to
find what was called ``an Arab solution.'' That obviously has
failed. And of course I'm disappointed that the matter hasn't been
resolved before now. This is a very serious matter. I'll take one
more and then I've got to go to work over here.
   Question: Have you already taken steps to protect Americans over
there? Have you moved. ...
   BUSH: I am not going to discuss what we're doing in terms of
moving of forces, anything of that nature. But I view it very
seriously, not just that but any threat to any other countries as
well as I view very seriously our determination to reverse out this
aggression. And please believe me, there are an awful lot of
countries that are in total accord with what I've just said. And I
salute them. They are staunch friends and allies. And we will be
working with them all for collective action. This will not stand.
This will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait. I've got to
go. I have to go to work. I've got to go to work.

   A Vietnamese man is thrown from a moving
train, a factory fires foreigners to trim its payroll, young toughs
club a Kurd unconcious. Racism is increasing in East Germany.
   Blessed with new freedom and German pride, but plagued by a
crashing economy and competition for scarce jobs, East Germans have
become openly hostile to foreign minorities.
   ``I am ashamed of the behavior of the East German people,'' said
Horst Kinitz, chief of the nation's employment agency.
   Organized bands of neo-Nazi skinheads _ radical youths with
shaved heads and aggressive attitudes _ have attacked Asians and
Africans, who make up the bulk of East Germany's foreign workers.
   About 80,000 Vietnamese, Angolans, Mozambicans and Cubans have
been working in East Germany under arrangements made with those
countries by the former Communist government.
   ``I'm very afraid,'' said Ngo Manh Long, a Vietnamese worker in
an East Berlin textile factory. ``The gangs make problems for us.
The German people are angry we are here.''
   Few such incidents were apparent under the Communists, who
maintained order with a suffocating internal security system.
   Rapid economic and social upheaval, and East Germany's emergence
as a Central European crossroads, have left its people dizzy with
change after four decades of isolationism.
   Lt. Joachim Crannich of the national police said the agency
recorded 32 cases of violence against foreigners in the first half
of 1990, but added the actual count probably was much higher.
   ``You have to see it in the context of our social changes,'' he
said. ``With the move toward democracy and introduction of the free
market, many people are anxious. If you're an East German and you
lose your job, but you see a foreigner keep his job, that creates a
certain frustation.''
   Among the incidents this year:
   _Skinheads attacked a grooup of Vietnamese on a train from
Eisenach to Berlin.
   _A Vietnamese was pushed off a train and seriously injured in
Wittenburg.
   _In Leipzig, skinheads attacked African students, shouting
racial epithets and ``Foreigners out!''
   _A dozen skinheads covered a Vietnamese man with spray paint in
Rudolstadt. An Iraqi Kurd said young toughs jumped him, pulled his
jacket over his head and beat him unconcious.
   ``I felt like a Jew during the Third Reich,'' he said.
   Many people blame organized radical right-wing groups, such as
the National Alternative, for such attacks. The group denies it.
   Juergen Helfricht, spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said
there was no proof the National Alternative was involved in
anything illegal, so police had no grounds to move against it.
   Experts say the skinheads, despite the attention they draw, are
only the violent fringe of a broader problem.
   ``The sensitivity in the East German population about racism is
abominably low,'' said Annetta Kahane, the East Berlin city
official who deals with foreigners' concerns. ``It's going to take
a long time until it reaches the same level as West Germany, and
it's not very good in West Germany.''
   Factories have become bastions of racism. East Germany switched
to a free market and merged its economy with West Germany's on July
1, a prelude to reunification in December.
   Unemployment is growing and there are numerous reports of
foreign workers being fired first as businesses trim payrolls.
   Volker Daehne, deputy chief of the East German employment
authority, said he had 296 documented cases since July 1 of foreign
workers being fired illegally.
   ``It's shameful to bring foreigners into this country and then
fire them at will,'' he said.
   Manh, the Vietnamese worker, is employed by an East Berlin maker
of men's clothing called Becon Classic, a former state concern now
operating independently. He said there is open hostility in the
plant.
   A complaint filed with the East Berlin government by Vietnamese
workers says rents have tripled in housing supplied by Becon and
two other factories. East Germans are protected from extreme rent
increases.
   Manh said he and eight other Vietnamese were living in a
one-room apartment and had paid the equivalent of $19 a month each,
but the rent more than tripled in July.
   Veronika Arendt-Rojah, a West Berlin lawyer representing
Vietnamese at Becon Classic, said she would file suit to block the
increases.
   Plant spokesman Wolfgang Boerner said there were no plans to
fire foreigners. He said rents had to be raised because subsidizing
them was a burden on the company.

   Two months after winning an
overwhelming mandate to govern, Burma's democratic opposition is
being kept out of office by a military administration that shows no
signs of stepping aside.
   The ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council has added new
conditions that could indefinitely delay a transfer of power to the
National League for Democracy, which swept the May 27 parliamentary
election.
   ``The scene is set for a confrontation and the feeling is now
that, unless the NLD stands up to be counted, the (military rulers)
will prevail,'' said a senior Western diplomat reached in Rangoon,
capital of Burma.
   ``The NLD may have scored a major election victory, but the
(military rulers) are the still the ones with the guns,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Anti-government street protests have increased despite
prohibitions under martial law. Diplomats said demonstrations by
young people in Rangoon and Mandalay, to the north, were the
largest in months.
   A cartoon in an exile newsletter expressed the feelings of many
Burmese. A mean-looking soldier points a revolver at the face of a
ragged civilian and snarls: ``Idiot! I said I'd give you elections
_ I didn't say I'd hand over power!''
   On July 29, More than 1,000 supporters of the National League
for Democracy waited outside a Rangoon conference hall where party
officials adopted a resolution demanding Parliament be convened in
September.
   Other demands in the resolution included dialogue with the
government, democratic rights and the release of party leaders.
They include Aung San Suu Kyi, an outspoken critic of military rule
who remains under house arrest although her one-year sentence
expired July 19.
   Police and soldiers surrounded the hall throughout the two-day
meeting.
   Gen. Saw Maung's government promised the election, the first in
30 years of authoritarian rule, after taking power in September
1988. His soldiers killed thousands of civilians who demonstrated
for democracy.
   Western diplomats said the government probably was astonished by
the magnitude of its loss. The National League took 392 of 485
parliamentary seats, and most of the rest went to groups close to
it.
   After it came to power, Saw Maung's government suspended the
constitution and said the parliament to be chosen in the promised
elections must approve a new one before power could be transferred.
   On March 27, the general said political parties could follow
their own programs after the election.
   ``Some are saying an interim government will be first formed and
power transferred under an interim constitution and they will take
time in drafting a constitution,'' he said. ``They can do what they
want.''
   Before the vote, the government spokesmen also said the new
parliament could adopt a constitution based on the charter of 1947,
the one that replaced it in 1974, or entirely new.
   Following their victory, National League officials said they
wanted to adopt the 1947 constitution temporarily and revise it.
   On July 13, the powerful chief of military intelligence, Maj.
Gen. Khin Nyunt, said the 1947 constitution no longer was
appropriate and a totally new one was needed.
   He added more conditions July 27, saying the government would
convene a national conference to provide guidelines for drafting a
charter, which then must be approved by referendum.
   ``Drafting of an interim constitution to obtain state power will
not be accepted in any way, and if it is done, effective action
will be taken according to the law,'' he declared.
   ``A political organization does not automatically obtain the
three sovereign powers of legislative, administrative and judiciary
power by the emergence of a people's assembly,'' he said.
   The new parliament's function was merely to draw up a
constitution, he said. The National League disagreed, and declared
at its conference that the parliament was not merely a constituent
assembly.
   ``It is against political nature that the NLD, which has
overwhelmingly won enough seats ... to form a government, itself
has been prohibited from the minimum of democratic rights,'' the
declaration said. ``It is shameful in the eyes of the people and
the international community.''
   Party leaders had drafted a provisional constitution that would
be refined by the parliament, the statement said.
   A Western diplomat said the declaration was a direct challenge
to the military, but that the National League was treading
carefully.
   Resentment of military rule remains strong and widespread, but
diplomats doubt the huge demonstrations of 1988 will be repeated.
   ``The army has constantly reminded people that it is quite
willing to take the same action as it did in 1988,'' one said.

   Jack Nicholson says TV interviews destroy an
actor's credibility, but he wouldn't mind acting on the tube.
   Nicholson gives interviews to the print media only.
   ``You can say anything in the printed word and both sides admit
that it's open to interpretation,'' he said in the Aug. 11 issue of
TV Guide.
   Nicholson said of TV interviews: ``There is no way you can get
people to believe you on screen if they know who you really are
through television.''
   The actor's latest movie, ``The Two Jakes,'' a sequel to
``Chinatown,'' opens Friday.
   He said he would have liked working on the CBS miniseries
``Lonesome Dove'' and might want to turn to television for a
long-cherished project about Napoleon.
   ``Maybe I made a mistake not doing television,'' Nicholson said.
``Now it might tempt me.''

   Spanish director Pedro Almodovar says lingering
American puritanism is to blame for the uproar over his latest
film, ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!''
   ``Everybody talks about this growing puritanism, which is
true,'' Almodovar said in the Aug. 13 issue of Newsweek. ``People
say it's the result of AIDS. But in fact it's a result of this
conservative nature inherent in American culture.''
   Almodovar, best known for last year's hit ``Women on the Verge
of a Nervous Breakdown,'' lost a fight over an X rating assigned to
his new film and decided to release it without a rating rather than
re-edit the movie. The film is about a former porn star who falls
in love with a man who keeps her tied up.
   Feminists who criticize the film are treating women ``as if they
were dumb animals,'' Almodovar said.

for a 17 percent drop in the ratings of ``Today.''
   Pauley left the NBC morning program last December and said in
the Aug. 13 issue of People magazine she feels guilty about the
ratings slump.
   Guilty, she said, ``to the degree that any of it was my doing.''
   Pauley was succeeded on ``Today'' after 13 years by Deborah

   Three robbers made off with $260,000 in cash
from souvenir sales at a New Kids on the Block concert, police said.
   Police spokesman Jacques Morrisseau said the robbers, armed
Sunday with revolvers and a bogus hand grenade, entered a room in
Olympic Stadium where 12 employees were counting money after a show
by the teen-age pop group.
   The robbers handcuffed the employees and placed the fake grenade
near a door, warning that the device would explode if someone tried
to open the door.

   Rue McClanahan and Casey Kasem criticized the
judge in a trial over a monkey trainer's defamation complaint
against an animal rights group.
   The two spoke to reporters Saturday and criticized state
District Judge Myron Leavitt's participation in the case brought by
Bobby Berosini.
   McClanahan, who appears on NBC's ``Golden Girls,'' Kasem of
radio's ``American Top 40'' and actress Peggy McCay, all animal
rights activists, said Leavitt had taken contributions from the
Stardust Hotel, where Berosini performs.
   The hotel is not involved in the trial between Berosini and
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
   Berosini is suing PETA for $80 million, claiming the
organization slandered him by releasing a videotape showing him
disciplining orangutans used in his show.
   Defense attorneys did not object to Leavitt hearing the case and
did not seek to move the case to another court.

   Forest fires, fed by wind and months of
drought, have scorched tens of thousands of acres across Italy,
disrupting train and highway travel and force evacuation of hill
towns in the path of the flames.
   Tuscany and Liguria in northcentral and eastern Italy were
hardest hit, but blazes were also reported Sunday in the hills
outside small towns near Rome, in the central mountainous Abruzzo
region and in the southern region whose principal city is Naples.
   A major state highway running to Leghorn, a Tuscan port city,
was closed near the city for a second day on Sunday. The rail line
linking Leghorn to Genoa, further up on the Tyrrhenian coast, was
periodically closed.
   No major injuries were reported, but several homes were reported
destroyed in the evacuated hamlet of Castellaccio, in the hills
outside Leghorn.
   Planes sprayed flame-retardant chemicals on the blazes, which
burned for a fourth day through the hills outside Leghorn. Two
French chemical-spraying aircraft were dispatched from Corsica to
help, state television said.
   Rainfall has been 40 percent below normal this year, creating
tinder-like conditions in the woods.

<HEAD>Long, Hot Summer for Cable Mogul Ted Turner</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been a long, hot summer for Ted Turner.
   Mediocre ratings and a loss of up to $26 million plagued his
Goodwill Games, his Cable News Network got a new president and his
relationship with Jane Fonda burned up the gossip columns.
   The fiery entrepreneur from Atlanta kept his chin up Saturday
when he spoke to reporters the day before the Goodwill Games
concluded.
   Speculation was rampant that the games, founded by Turner in
1986, may no longer be sponsored by Turner Broadcasting System Inc.
Turner said he expected a decision from the TBS board of directors
within six weeks on whether to continue the network's participation.
   ``Yes, we did lose some money _ the exact amount will not be
known until later _ but in my opinion it's a reasonable down
payment to an event that will grow in stature and at some point
break even,'' Turner said.
   The Seattle games, which lasted 17 days, received an overall
rating on TBS of 3.2. A rating of 5.0 was anticipated. One A.C.
Nielsen Co. ratings point is equal to 921,000 homes.
   ``Yes, the ratings did not meet our estimates, but the Winter
and Summer Olympics did not meet the estimates of ABC and NBC,''
Turner said.
   Last month, Turner hired an outsider, Tom Johnson, to be
president of CNN. Johnson, a former publisher of the Los Angeles
Times, left his job as vice chairman of the newspaper's parent
Times Mirror Co. to work at Turner's 24-hour, all-news network.
   Turner found time this summer to play his ``Mouth of the South''
role when he insulted religious groups by saying Christianity is
``for losers.'' He later appeared at a Woodstock, Ga., church to
apologize.
   All the while, Turner and Fonda have been burning up the gossip
circuit. An Atlanta magazine lampooned their relationship by
superimposing Turner's head on a photograph of a muscleman for a
cover story.
   Turner, chairman and president of TBS, disclosed last month
during the TBS annual shareholders meeting that the Goodwill Games
would lose as much as $26 million, twice what had been projected.
   He has maintained since 1986 that the games were not designed to
make money but to foster good will between nations and showcase the
world's best athletes. But some observers feel Turner may have
trouble convincing the TBS board of directors the altruistic
benefits of the games justify costs.
   Hank Whittemore, whose book ``CNN: The Inside Story'' was
published earlier this year and chronicles the network's first 10
years, said he couldn't predict whether Turner would stick with the
Goodwill Games, but suggested there are some parallels between the
games and the early days of CNN.
   ``CNN lost $77 million in five years and people said when is
Turner going to sell out and go back to being what he was _ the
owner of another network (the TBS SuperStation) and a bunch of
sports teams,'' Whittemore said.
   Turner officials in charge of the Goodwill Games are cautious
when discussing the future.
   Terence F. McGuirk, TBS vice president in charge of sports, said
financial losses aside, the Goodwill Games were a success. The goal
of the '90 Games was to build the credibility of the event in the
athletic world, which was accomplished, he said.
   Still, McGuirk added, ``We are not in a position today to tell
you definitely that the company is ready to commit to a certain
involvement with the Goodwill Games in the future.''
   It is conceivable, McGuirk said, that TBS will remain with the
Games but in a different role. He would not speculate about what
that role might be.

<HEAD>Heavy Rice Exports By Vietnam Cause Price Jumps at Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam has been exporting so much rice
that domestic prices for the staple have doubled in Ho Chi Minh
City and some provinces in the last month, Radio Hanoi reports.
   Exporters ``have rushed to the city to buy up all the rice
available,'' Vietnam's official radio said.
   ``This has given the people the impression that there is a
scarcity of rice, thus prompting many families to buy rice to keep
in reserve.''
   Domestic rice prices have almost doubled in other provinces as
well, said the report, which gave no price figures. A text of last
week's broadcast was seen in Bangkok today.
   Officials were trying to control rice prices by banning sales to
unauthorized exporters and placing one agency in charge of buying
and selling grain within Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, the
radio report said.
   The government also plans to buy grain for reserve stocks, the
report said.
   Vietnam exported 1.15 million tons of rice in the first six
months of 1990, double its exports for the same period last year.
Analysts predict the Communist country will export a record 2 to
2.4 million tons this year.
   Vietnam went from widespread food shortages in 1988 to become
the world's third-largest rice exporter last year. Economic reforms
have given farmers incentives by allowing them to keep more profits.

<HEAD>Republicans Ask Wyoming to Elect a GOP Woman Governor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA PRODIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans are putting Wyoming's nickname
as the Equality State to the test this year, asking residents to
elect their second woman governor in state history.
   Two women are vying for the GOP nomination in the state's Aug.
21 primary, hoping for a shot at first-term Democrat Mike Sullivan,
who is one of the most popular politicians in heavily Republican
Wyoming.
   ``Wyoming touts the slogan that this is the Equality State. I'll
have to run on that premise,'' Nyla Murphy, one of the GOP
contenders, says. ``We had the first woman governor in our nation's
history, I see no reason why we couldn't have another woman
governor.''
   Her GOP rival is Mary Mead, who says her life on a ranch has
more than prepared her for the governor's office.
   ``I pull a calf at 4 a.m., cook for men for breakfast, go to a
bank meeting at 9 a.m., move cows, try to get my damn snowmobile to
run to check heifers, work outside all day and then have a dinner
party,'' she said. ``That's not untypical for any ranch woman.''
   But Wyoming historian T.A. Larson think it will take more than a
nickname to get Murphy or Mead elected this year. Larson said
Wyoming has been ``mighty slow'' in living up to its Equality State
tag.
   ``I think there has been a little more male chauvinism in
Wyoming than many other states, so I think this election will be a
really substantial test,'' Larson said.
   Sullivan surprised many people four years ago when he left his
law practice to run for governor and handily defeated Republican
Pete Simpson, the brother of U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson.
   This time around, some Republicans who had considered running
for the office pulled out early, saying Sullivan would be too hard
to beat.
   The governor has been criticized by his challengers as lacking
leadership to bring about a strong economic recovery to the
mineral-dependent state. While the campaigns have been focusing on
the need for economic expansion, neither Murphy nor Mead has
offered specific plans on how to bring it about.
   Sullivan said he's hopeful voters will cast their ballots based
on the issues, not gender, but acknowledges: ``I don't think you
can overlook the fact that you have a woman who is a challenger and
you have to at least be sensitive to that fact.''
   Mead agrees gender should not be the deciding factor.
   ``I don't think it should make a difference whether it's a man
or a woman,'' she said. ``I would hope Wyoming people are very
discerning people. They are so capable and quick to size 'em up.''
   Mead had all but sewn up the GOP nomination earlier this year
after a half-dozen competitors dropped out of the race.
   The disappearances led to charges that powerful Republicans,
including Mead's father, former Gov. Cliff Hansen, were playing
``queen makers'' and had effectively discouraged all others from
the race. That rankled Murphy, a 12-year veteran of the state
House, who entered the race in June.
   ``I call them king makers,'' she said at the time. ``I guess I
should say queen makers. But I think that there's a small group of
the party ... money powers, money brokers, behind the opponent's
candidacy.''
   The gender issue has popped up from time to time on the campaign
trail.
   During one campaign stop, the governor remarked that he
considered Mead a ``pretty woman from a nice family.'' While his
statement was widely publicized, the question that prompted it
wasn't.
   ``The question to me was, `Governor ... Mary Mead and the
Republicans say you're a nice man with a nice family. What is your
response?'' Sullivan said. ``And flippantly I said, `Mary's a
pretty woman from a nice family.'''
   For her part, Mead joked during an interview that she was so
busy on the campaign trail that she didn't have time to iron her
clothes and perhaps she could borrow the governor's wife, Jane.
   Mead also initially rejected proposals to debate Murphy, saying
it wouldn't be proper for two women to debate one another.
   Wyoming's one and only woman governor was Nellie Tayloe Ross,
who was elected 66 years ago to fill the unexpired two-year term of
her late husband. She was not re-elected.

   Behind the sun, sand and carefree
islanders of the tourist brochures lies another Caribbean of
hardship and frustration that is a breeding ground for radicalism.
   It became visible when Moslem extremists tried to overthrow the
government of Trinidad.
   ``Trinidad was a ticking time bomb, but it is only one of a
number of such situations in the Caribbean,'' said Larry Birns,
director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs in Washington.
   Economic decay throughout the region provides fertile ground for
civil unrest, analysts say.
   ``Economic prosperity solves a broad range of societal problems,
and economic despair breeds them,'' Birns said.
   Abu Bakr, leader of Jamaat-al-Muslimeen, said he and his
followers seized Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson and 54 other
hostages on July 27 because of the poverty that has replaced
Trinidad's oil bonanza of the 1970s.
   Most of the Caribbean's two dozen islands have similar problems
because of shrinking world markets for bauxite, oil, bananas, sugar
and other traditional exports.
   Unemployment in the region averages 22 percent, foreign debt in
the billions drains tax revenues, inflation erodes buying power and
living standards fall.
   Foreign investment, trade agreements like the Reagan
administration's Caribbean Basin Initiative and expansion of
tourism have not stopped the decline.
   ``Unfortunately, the United States thinks in terms of hundreds
of thousands of dollars to solve Caribbean problems when it's going
to take hundreds of millions of dollars,'' said Birns, whose
organization often criticizes U.S. policy in the region.
   Bakr, a former policeman who converted to Islam, demanded
Robinson's resignation and blamed him for the country's economic
plight. Most of Bakr's support came from poor blacks.
   Robinson won a landslide election victory in 1986, but Birns
said the prime minister had become a ``political pariah,'' largely
because of austerity measures dictated by the International
Monetary Fund as a condition for new loans.
   Consumer price increases, layoffs and reduced spending on
schools and hospitals demanded by the IMF have provoked riots in
Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Guyana, as well as several
Latin American countries.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi stepped into this picture,
analysts say, with handouts for Bakr and radical political parties
with potential to destabilize governments.
   ``It's a well-known fact that Libya has funded leftist
activities in Dominica, Antigua and St. Lucia and separatists
organizations in Martinique and Guadeloupe,'' said John Collins,
Caribbean advisor to the Puerto Rican government.
   ``The left-of-center parties in these small islands use support
from Gadhafi to exploit the economic underdevelopment which exists
in their countries to mount opposition to the right-of-center
parties that are pro-U.S.''
   The six-day hostage siege in Trinidad, which prompted widespread
looting and claimed at least 38 lives, has prompted Caribbean
leaders to review regional security measures.
   ``Our determination that this must not happen again must be
given explicit effect,'' Prime Minister Erskine Sandiford of
Barbados said at last week's annual meeting of the 13-member
Caribbean Economic Community, or Caricom, in Kingston, Jamaica.
   Prime Minister Eugenia Charles of Dominica said a regional
security agreement dating to the 1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada
should be expanded to allow Caricom armies to intervene when an
elected government is threatened.
   In Trinidad's case, Caricom sent a multinational force of 150 on
Friday, two days after the siege ended, to aid the army and police.
   Guyana's independent Stabroek News said in an editorial that the
attempted coup was ``an affront to the aspiration of the region's
people.''
   ``We know the shock waves have reverberated throughout the
Caribbean, where many governments face a difficult economic
situation, and we imagine this will spur them all to greater and
more purposeful efforts to define a democratic future for Caribbean
peoples,'' it said.
   Anthony Maingot, a native of Trinidad who teaches sociology at
Florida International University in Miami, acknowledged the
region's vulnerability, but said democracy was firmly entrenced.
   ``This is the largest gathering of Third World democracies in
the world,'' Maingot said.
   He noted that in Trinidad Prime Minister Robinson ``is still
there, the elected government is still there and parliamentary
democracy is still intact. This is the silver lining of the cloud.''

<HEAD>Industry Claims It's Being Sacrificed in Trade Discussions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The domestic textile industry and its workers
are portraying themselves as sacrificial lambs in the
administration's jockeying to reduce foreign trade barriers to U.S.
exports.
   Casting itself as a victim is nothing new for an industry that
has lost 30 percent of the American textile and clothing market and
about 400,000 jobs to foreigners in the 1980s alone.
   In the past decade, the foreign share of the U.S. fiber and
apparel market has climbed from 28 percent to 60 percent. As a
result, 1,500 domestic plants have been closed and U.S. employment
in the industry has dropped 25 percent.
   The industry blames a wide variety of economic and political
forces:
   _Ideological free traders in the Reagan and Bush administrations.
   _The government's desire to maintain U.S. influence abroad in
the face of a shrinking ability to provide direct foreign aid.
   _The development of export-oriented textile, apparel and shoe
industries in less-developed countries so they'll have cash to pay
back loans from American banks.
   ``There is a belief that many of the debtor (less-developed)
countries must be allowed to ship textiles and apparel to the U.S.
in order to earn foreign exchange,'' said Daniel Frierson, past
president of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute. ``And in
some instances we now see where these debts are being forgiven in
return for barter for textiles.''
   Frierson, chairman of Dixie Yarns Inc. of Chattanooga, Tenn.,
heads an industry coalition that is behind the Senate's passage
earlier this month of a bill to limit further growth of textile,
apparel and footwear imports to 1 percent a year.
   Opponents of the proposed new quotas contend they will raise the
price of apparel, other textile products and shoes to U.S.
consumers by $25 billion to $27 billion a year.
   ``You do not notice it much,'' said Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.
``Just 50 cents a shirt here, a dollar ... two dollars a pair of
shoes there. But add that up by 250 million consumers in this
country; that is a lot of money.''
   The bill has cleared the House Ways and Means Committee and _
with 243 sponsors _ passage seems virtually assured when
representatives return from recess in September. Whether it can
survive Bush's expected veto is another question.
   Nearly identical legislation was approved by Congress in 1985
and 1988 but was vetoed by Reagan. Bush has vowed to do the same
should it reach his desk.
   The administration contends the bill would undermine U.S.
efforts to lower foreign barriers to American farm and computer
exports, banks and other investors.
   ``If this textile legislation is passed into law, then other
nations will take off the negotiating table matters that are
extremely important to us,'' said Ronald J. Sorini, the chief U.S.
negotiator in the 100-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
talks going on in Geneva.
   Sorini and other U.S. officials contend they will support quotas
on textiles and apparel in some form for another 10 years. But
industry leaders fear they will only open the door to more imports.
   ``The U.S. government has two bargaining chips to use to obtain
its GATT goals _ agriculture and textiles,'' said Jay Mazur,
president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union.
   ``With few signs that agreement will be reached on agriculture,
only apparel and textiles remain as giveaways,'' he said. ``And
there is every indication that the administration is prepared to
give them away.''

<HEAD>Roseanne's Husband Clashes With Photographers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roseanne Barr's husband, Tom Arnold, clashed
with paparazzi at Los Angeles International Airport, and three
photographers accused him of assault, police said.
   No injuries were reported, and no arrests were made.
   Arnold and Miss Barr, star of ABC's ``Roseanne,'' had arrived on
a flight Sunday from Minnesota when Arnold tangled with four or
five photographers, said airport police Sgt. Allen Chu.
   Three photographers, Gary Aloian, 38, Robert Scott, 39, and
Ralph Dominguez, 43, filed police reports accusing Arnold of
striking them several times and damaging their cameras, said city
police Sgt. Michael Apodaca.
   The reports did not say where the photographers worked.
   ``Our detectives will look at it and determine the merits of the
case,'' Apodaca said. ``They may hand the case over to the city
attorney, who again will evaluate it and make a decision whether to
file.''
   Miss Barr last month caused a stir by screeching the national
anthem at a San Diego Padres baseball game.
   George Freeman, a spokesman for Miss Barr, did not immediately
return a call Sunday.

   Sammie Harkless rose quickly in the print shop
of an investment banking firm, and he and his pregnant wife live
comfortably in a suburban New Jersey apartment.
   Four years ago, he was a homeless drug addict.
   In between his time on the streets and his arrival at Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co., Harkless discovered Binding Together Inc., a copy
shop that does more than duplicate resumes.
   It takes recovering drug addicts and teaches them the printing
trade.
   ``Four years ago, I thought there was no hope for me,'' said
Harkless, 32. ``I was living on the streets using drugs. Really I
was bankrupt spiritually.''
   Binding Together gave him the chance he needed to change, he
said. ``All I have to do now is just maintain this.''
   Students at Binding Together are referred by drug treatment
centers. They read, on average, at a seventh-grade level and often
need tutoring to handle copy-shop paperwork.
   The program provides six months of instruction in binding,
shipping and receiving and operating state-of-the-art printing
machines. Graduates get $2,000 each. Most use the money to get an
apartment and buy clothes for work.
   The program has 82 graduates ranging is age from 22 to 40 since
it started two years ago. Thirteen people didn't finish the course
and 30 are in training now.
   ``Right now in the graphic arts industry there is a shortage of
trained people,'' said Michael Lamberti, a spokesman for Morgan
Stanley.
   The company started Harkless as a clerk in its in-house print
shop, promoted him to a machine operator and then to a shift
supervisor within 19 months.
   ``It's all because he can do the job,'' Lamberti said. ``He came
to us trained.''
   All Binding Together graduates are placed in jobs that pay at
least $7 an hour. Surveys taken four months after graduates left
found 85 percent were still at work.
   More than half of Binding Together's annual $650,000 budget
comes from sales the business makes of printing services to
corporate clients such as Equitable and Time Warner.
   The rest comes from private foundations, corporations and public
agencies, including the state Division of Substance Abuse Services,
which came up with the idea of opening a business that could pay
some of its own bills while teaching people a skill.
   Binding Together was one of 17 job training programs honored in
March with presidential citations.
   ``It's a well thought-out program,'' said Yvonne DeGaetano,
deputy commissioner for the city Department of Employment, which
also provides money for Binding Together. ``The staff is incredibly
good. It's not just a job. They believe in what they're doing.
People become family and become connected with each other, and
particularly with this population you need to do that.''
   Bruce Sims, 29, a recent graduate, agreed.
   ``I didn't really have faith in myself. When I was ready to give
up, the staff encouraged me,'' he said.
   Sims is a high school dropout and said he would treasure the
certificate he got from Binding Together. ``I'm going to hang this
up on my wall and look at it every night and morning,'' he said.
   Binding Together is run by Phil Calderella, 40, a retired police
officer who also worked for four years in the printing business.
   ``Some people are in a situation where they have hit rock
bottom,'' he said. ``When you come across somebody like that, you
have to put forth the extra effort. Given the right tools to help
them re-enter society, they're going to change.''

   An effort to ban cruising in Milwaukee and
three suburbs has escalated into a legal battle with teen-agers
claiming a right to free travel.
   The laws prohibit cars from passing a given point more than
twice in two hours. Police keep track by recording license plate
numbers on laptop computers.
   ``It's a ridiculous law. I think Checkpoint Charlie was taken
down in Europe and put up here,'' said Diane Brandmiller, 25, the
first person arrested in May under the ordinance in West Allis.
   The American Civil Liberties Union last week sued on behalf of
Ms. Brandmiller and hundreds of teen-age drivers. The lawsuit,
filed against Milwaukee, West Allis, Hales Corner and Greenfield,
contends the bans trample on drivers' rights to travel freely.
   Ms. Brandmiller, who pleaded innocent to the charges, said she
is not a ``cruiser by nature'' but supports the challenge.
   ``It's a Milwaukee tradition,'' she said. ``I expect my parents
were cruisers.''
   Greenfield Police Capt. Phil Hall said that on two streets,
young drivers cruising around were constantly ``screeching tires,
throwing bottles, urinating and (playing) boom boxes.''
   ``It was the volume of traffic where emergency vehicles couldn't
even move on the street. They had to use the sidewalks. The people
in the area were complaining about losing business,'' Hall said.
   Fines for violating the ordinances range from $50 to $200,
depending on the number of violations.
   West Allis police have made only 10 arrests since the ban was
enacted but report a dramatic decrease in the volume of traffic on
main streets. Other departments have reported similar experiences.
   ``The streets are back to normal, back to the way they should
be. They're so you can drive on them again,'' said Lt. Ronald
Hensel, of the West Allis Police Department.
   Jerome Buting, an attorney for the ACLU, said the lawsuit seeks
to have the laws declared unconstitutional.
   The ACLU fears that the cities have gone so far to ``deal with a
perceived problem'' that they have enacted laws that ``hurt more
than cruisers,'' he said.
   Greenfield Mayor James M. Besson disagreed, arguing that police
won't go after drivers who don't appear to be cruisers.
   Protesters angry over the bans picketed in Milwaukee in June.
   ``You should be able to go where you want to when you want to.
Mostly, cruisers are driving around and talking,'' said one picket,
Eric Nelson, 19. ``There's a few cruisers around looking for
fights, but they're a small percentage.''

<HEAD>Congress Heads for Summer Recess</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is on summer recess after a weekend
marathon that produced a Pentagon spending blueprint in the Senate,
campaign finance overhaul in the House and final passage of
emergency relief to cities hard hit by AIDS.
   Left hanging after the burst of legislative activity were the
delicate _ and politically testy _ negotiations between Congress
and the White House on a deficit-reduction plan to avert mandatory,
across-the-board budget cuts.
   Also awaiting action when the House and Senate return after
Labor Day are conference talks on the first major clean air bill in
more than 13 years, a measure to boost aid for child care and a
possible new fight over family leave legislation that President
Bush vetoed earlier this year.
   Lawmakers also face the usual election-year deadline pressures
of trying to complete the major spending bills in time to hit the
campaign trail as early in October as possible.
   The Senate and House face particularly acute differences over
the defense bill. These include policy divisions on how much to
spend on B-2 stealth bomber production and the future of the
Strategic Defense Initiative, once the glittering cornerstone of
Reagan administration defense policy but now dimmed by warming
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   In approving a $289 billion defense bill on Saturday, the Senate
left intact Bush's proposal to build two B-2 bombers in the 1991
fiscal year starting Oct. 1. But the Senate cut $1 billion from his
Star Wars request, leaving $3.7 billion.
   While the Senate pegged total defense spending at $18 billion
less than the $307 billion Bush sought, the House favors even
steeper cuts of $24 billion.
   But even though the Senate version represents the likely
high-water mark in defense spending in Congress this year, the
White House said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is likely to
recommend a veto.
   Cheney objects to the reduction in the Star Wars program and to
the Senate's call for a 100,000 reduction in U.S. military
personnel. The Senate also voted to eliminate $1.6 billion in
procurement money for the MX rail-mobile missile program.
   In their rush to leave the city's August heat behind, the House
and Senate approved a number of measures, including a campaign
finance package backed by the House Democratic leadership making a
number of changes and limiting House campaign spending to $715,000
a candidate.
   The House bill _ which seeks to curb contributions by ``fat
cat'' corporate political action committees _ must be reconciled
with a differing Senate version.
   The AIDS measure would provide more than $4 billion over five
years to help U.S. cities hardest hit by the disease.
   The bill authorizes nearly $900 million per year in AIDS
spending for five years, with $275 million authorized to be divided
among the cities in fiscal 1991 and fiscal 1992 and ``such sums as
may be necessary'' through fiscal 1995.
   A similar amount would be authorized for distribution to the
states for improving quality and availability of care for people
with the AIDS-causing HIV virus.
   A major portion of the money for the cities would be earmarked
to help provide health and social services.
   The first half of the money, about $137 million, would be
divided among the 16 areas singled out for special assistance. The
other half would be redistributed in fiscal 1992 based on the
number of AIDS cases at that time.
   The cities authorized to receive the assistance are Atlanta,
$3.8 million; Boston, $3 million; Chicago, $4.2 million; Dallas, $3
million; Fort Lauderdale, Fla., $2.7 million; Houston, $5.6
million; Jersey City, $2.8 million; Los Angeles, $13 million;
Miami, 5.3 million; New York, $51.3 million; Newark, $6.3 million;
Philadelphia, $3.6 million; San Diego, $2.4 million; San Francisco,
$20.4 million; San Juan, P.R., $4.1 million and the District of
Columbia, $5.3 million.

   Hiroshima came to a halt for a moment
today in observance of the world's first atom bomb attack, which
leveled this bustling coastal city 45 years ago.
   For an eery moment, the city fell silent, automobiles stopped
and people throughout this industrial center of one million
residents joined in a moment of prayer to comfort the souls of the
140,000 people who died from the bomb.
   ``I pay my deep respects to the citizens of Hiroshima who have
built this city of international peace from the ashes,'' Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu said in an address to a crowd of 55,000 at a
commemoration ceremony.
   ``As the only country in the world to have experienced an atom
bomb attack, Japan has resolved not to let it be repeated with our
three non-nuclear principles and our calls for total nuclear
disarmament and everlasting peace.'' The United States dropped the
atom bomb on Hiroshima, a major military center, during World War
II, on August 6, 1945. The bomb wiped out nearly half the 300,000
people who lived in the city, killing most immediately. Many others
died within months from radiation, burns and other afflictions.
   Some 70,000 buildings were destroyed, including most of the
city's hospitals.
   In his annual peace declaration, Hiroshima Mayor Takeshi Araki
called pledges by the United States and the Soviet Union to reduce
their nuclear arsenals the best hope for the future. He called for
the banishment of all nuclear tests and nuclear weapons worldwide.
   By early today, a wide plaza in front of the cenotaph, the
central monument to atom bomb victims, was filled with mourners and
flowers wilting in the heat.
   Dignitaries, Hiroshima residents and foreign guests bowed their
heads in a moment of silent prayer at 8:15 a.m., the moment the
bomb exploded in a blinding flash of light 45 years earlier.
   Hiroshima has been honoring the dead each year for 43 years.
Movies, museum exhibits, monuments and victims' testimony describe
the bombing that reduced Hiroshima to rubble and left its seven
rivers choked with dead.
   Each year, 1.5 million people visit the city's Peace Memorial
Museum, where several graphic exhibits refer to the attack as
genocide and point out that it was carried out against innocent
civilians.
   Not all Hiroshima residents can face the memories. Retired
school teacher Minako Tanabe said her husband has never attended
the annual peace ceremony.
   ``My husband won't come here because it's too sad. So many of
his friends died that day,'' she said.
   At the ceremony, 5,551 names of victims exposed to the bomb who
died in the past year were added to the names enshrined in the
cenotaph.
   Although it is difficult to determine which deaths are directly
related to the bomb, researchers believe the risk of death from
leukemia and lung, bone and breast cancer is much greater for those
exposed.
   Three days after the attack on Hiroshima, the United States
dropped a second atom bomb on the city of Nagasaki, killing another
70,000 civilians. Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945, ending the
war.

<TEXT>
   Al Capone was sent up the river in 1931 on a
federal income tax rap. But the mobster who ruled the Chicago
underworld would be untouchable today if the jury's verdict at a
mock trial is any indication.
   Public Enemy No. 1 seemed sure of the outcome of the fantasy
trial as he strode with a smile on his face and confidence in his
step into a makeshift courtroom Sunday.
   Capone actually was Joe Guastaferro, an actor hired by the
American Bar Association, which sought to demonstrate modern
courtroom tactics at its annual meeting here.
   All bets seemed to be on Capone, who ran Chicago's gambling and
booze rackets in the 1920s with a gang of tommy gun-toting toughs.
   Thanks to a stable of fine ``mouthpieces'' and favorable changes
in tax laws, Capone was acquitted on all 12 counts of money
laundering, willingly failing to file taxes and conspiracy to
defraud the United States.
   The verdict did not surprise Indianapolis attorney Linda Pence,
who played a government lawyer at the trial.
   ``The problem we had was that we were trying to summarize 11
days of testimony in three witnesses,'' she said. ``Usually a jury
hears evidence over and over again from several witnesses, and we
didn't have that.
   ``And the law has changed a bit. When the Capone case was first
tried there were very few guidelines about what you could do.''
   Ms. Pence did express some mock concern at the mock acquittal,
however.
   ``I just hope the jury doesn't let him off so easily next time.
It worries me a little bit that Al Capone is roaming the streets of
Chicago again,'' she said.
   The bar association enlisted a real federal judge and jury and
lawyers who studied transcripts and evidence from the trial 59
years ago. Sunday's trial was held in the ballroom of a Chicago
hotel.
   ``We are going to prove to you that he has exhibited an
arrogance uncommon to the average American taxpayer,'' Ms. Pence
told the jury. ``While living like a king, he never filed taxes,
never filed a return.''
   U.S. District Judge Prentice Marshall, who presided over the
trial, praised the defense lawyers for their apparently successful
efforts to discredit the prosecution's key witness.
   At the original trial, defense attorneys did not attack the
credibility of Capone bookkeeper Fred Ries, a two-time convict.
   But the defense this time said the government coerced Ries into
singing like a canary by sticking him in a cell with a colony of
cockroaches.
   ``It was torture, wasn't it?'' asked the defense attorney,
played by Terence MacCarthy, executive director of the federal
defender program in Chicago.
   ``It was not an enjoyable experience,'' Ries replied.
   ``And after five days, you decided to, quote, `play ball,'''
MacCarthy responded. ``You said, `I'll tell them whatever they want
to know.'''
   The Rev. Patrick Smith, a boyhood friend of Ries and defense
witness, later said the bookkeeper was known as someone who
couldn't be trusted.
   ``I'm afraid if you had a choice between shaking hands with the
devil and with Frank Ries, you'd shake hands with the devil every
time,'' Smith testified.
   In 1931, Capone was convicted on five counts of evading income
taxes and failing to file tax returns. He was sentenced to 11 years
in prison and served almost seven years. Capone died of syphilis in
1947 at his Florida home.

<HEAD>Federal Rural Development Tainted By Money Shortage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rural development efforts by the federal
government are tainted by money shortages and poor management of
the limited funds that are available, a study says.
   The yearlong project, financed by the Ford Foundation, focused
on the Farmers Home Administration, an agency of the Agriculture
Department. The FmHA handles a variety of farm, housing and
community programs.
   A report was released Sunday by the Center for Community Change,
a non-profit advocacy group for low-income rural people.
   ``Federal support for rural development was cut by nearly 70
percent during the Reagan administration,'' said Robert Rapoza, who
directed the study. ``Yet the majority of the remaining funds
failed to reach the neediest rural communities. The federal
response to these communities has been plainly inadequate.''
   Joe O'Neill, a spokesman for the FmHA, said the agency had not
had the opportunity to study the report. But he said, ``We're
always pleased to get these kinds of studies ... and they can be
very useful.''
   The report said rural problems include:
   _Unemployment, adjusted to include underemployment, is one-third
higher than in the cities.
   _Rural Americans are more likely to be poor. One-third more
rural people than urban residents are below the poverty line.
   _Ninety-seven percent of the nation's rural residents rely on
ground water for drinking. Yet, a 1984 survey by the Environmental
Protection Agency found two-thirds of the wells were contaminated.
   _Almost 2 million rural residents live in substandard housing,
usually lacking adequate plumbing.
   _Maternal and infant mortality rates are substantially higher
than in urban areas and are rising at faster rates.
   ``Rural residents are, as a group, less educated, less healthy
and less skilled than their urban counterparts,'' the report said.
``They operate in a comparatively static, more conservative
business environment, and they receive less help from Washington.''
   The report criticized the FmHA _ which has its roots in the
Great Depression era of the 1930s _ for not targeting more of its
resources to poor communities to help build water and sewer
systems, health centers, fire houses and businesses. These programs
add up to about $900 million this year.
   According to the report, poverty-level communities got only 2
percent to 3 percent of total FmHA loans and grants for water and
sewer facilities between 1985 and 1988.
   The report said one reason for not targeting on the poorest
communities is the way FmHA uses poverty data.
   While the agency adjusts the poverty line upward each year, it
uses 1980 census numbers to determine the average income of
individual communities, it said. Thus, some communities whose
average income exceeded the poverty level in 1980 now fall under
today's higher poverty line.
   The effect, according to the report, is that those communities
qualify for FmHA assistance, even though others are much poorer.
   Programs operated by the EPA also were criticized for failing to
provide more help for rural areas to meet federal water standards.
   ``EPA figures indicate that two-third of rural water supplies
violate agency drinking water standards,'' said Maureen Kennedy,
principal author of the report. ``Given this need, it is disturbing
that the EPA has not provided more support to rural areas.''
   Despite the need, the report said, EPA spends ``a very small and
diminishing amount on wastewater projects'' in rural areas.
   Figures for EPA construction grants between 1981 and 1987
declined by 91 percent in real terms, after adjustments for
inflation, the report said.
   The report hedged on recommending a vast reorganization of
federal rural development programs, such as blending them all into
one super agency. But it did propose some administrative changes
within USDA's hierarchy.
   Also, it said many communities lack the know-how for getting
access to federal programs that might help them develop.
   Further, the report said most FmHA staff people come from
agricultural backgrounds ``despite the fact that these programs
demand training in finance, civil engineering and organizing.''
   Consequently, ``FmHA should strengthen its substantive training
programs, but more importantly, the agency should focus its
recruiting efforts on those with backgrounds appropriate to the
changing needs of the agency,'' the report said.

   The oil war between Iraq and Kuwait
jeopardizes an important lifeline for the world economy, and
Americans already are seeing the results at the gasoline pump.
   Here are some questions and answers to help explain the economic
stakes in the gulf crisis.
   Q. Can't we get by without Iraq's oil?
   A. Yes, and apparently we will, since President Bush has ordered
a total cutoff of imports from Iraq. The United States, Japan,
Canada and the European Community announced embargoes on Iraqi oil
after Iraq's invasion Thursday of Kuwait.
   Q. If we don't need Iraq's oil, why would prices go up?
   A. Often the price of oil is influenced more by fear than logic.
If oil companies and brokers decide there's a chance that the
Persian Gulf crisis could worsen, they are likely to bid for the
first available barrel rather than use one already in storage. The
more the bidding, the higher the price goes. Some critics say the
oil companies take advantage of this uncertainty by jacking up
their prices at the gasoline pump, although the industry hotly
disputes this.
   Q. Does this mean I'll be paying more at the pump?
   A. Almost surely. The American Automobile Association says its
survey of gasoline stations showed prices rose by 4 to 14 cents a
gallon in just the first two days after the Iraqi invasion. Edward
Rothschild of Citizen Action, a Washington-based consumer group,
thinks prices will jump 15 to 20 cents a gallon by the end of the
month, but the Bush administration says it sees no risk of a big
rise.
   Q. Wouldn't it help if American oil companies pumped more crude?
   A. Probably, but there's no chance of that. In fact it's the
lack of spare production capacity, in part, that makes the U.S.
consumer vulnerable to price increases caused by foreign wars. U.S.
oil companies have been shutting down wells since 1986 when a
collapse of crude prices made many smaller wells uneconomic.
   Domestic oil production is down 20 percent since 1985, and the
number of oil and natural gas operators in this country has plunged
from 13,000 to 4,500 since 1985, according to the Independent
Petroleum Association of America, a trade group.
   Q. If more oil supply is the answer to keeping down prices, why
is Bush boycotting Iraq?
   A. The embargo is mainly a diplomatic tool. The president
himself said Friday he couldn't assure the American public that the
pressure tactic would pay off. In fact, the administration may not
be anxious for it to work too well. If every nation refused to buy
Iraq's oil, the world would suddenly find itself short of oil, at
least for a short time.
   ``If we were truly successful on the embargo we would throw
ourselves into a serious recession,'' said Rep. Philip R. Sharp,
D-Ind., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
energy and power.
   Q. Doesn't the United States have emergency oil reserved for
crises like this?
   A. Yes, there is a large reserve, but no, it apparently won't be
used under the current circumstances. Known as the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve, the system is a series of salt caverns in
Louisiana and Texas that holds nearly 590 million barrels of oil,
or enough to replace more than one-third of U.S. imports for 170
days.
   The reserve, which was started in 1975 in response to the 1973
Arab oil embargo, has never been used, and the administration says
it sees no need for tapping it now.

   Here are some facts and figures on Liberia:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND: The West African nation is bordered by Ivory Coast,
Guinea and Sierra Leone and covers 42,900 square miles _ about the
size of Ohio. The coastal plain gives way to rocky cliffs, and
strong tides make access to the Atlantic Ocean difficult. The
highest elevations are in the northern highlands, which rise up to
4,500 feet. The capital is Monrovia.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE: The population is estimated at about 2.5 million,
including 16 principal tribal groups and about 50,000 descendants
of freed American slaves who founded the country. English is the
official language. The vast majority of the country practices
traditional African religions.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY: Even before the rebel insurgency began, the economy
was near collapse, although Liberia possesses some of the richest
iron ore in the world. The country has been unable to pay its
foreign debt, and it has been suspended by the International
Monetary Fund. Mining has earned more than 64 percent of Liberia's
foreign exchange but agriculture has remained the main employer.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE HISTORY: In 1822, freed American slaves visited Liberia and
began settlements. They declared Liberia an independent republic in
1847. Descendants of the freed slaves, called Americo-Liberians,
dominated the country until then-Master Sgt. Samuel K. Doe led a
military coup on April 12, 1979. He was popular with the majority
of Liberians, who resented the dominance of the Americo-Liberians.
Doe headed a military government until October 1985, when elections
were held. He claimed victory, but opposition parties and
independent observers said the vote was rigged. On Dec. 24, 1989,
former Doe aide Charles Taylor invaded with a small band of men
from Ivory Coast. Taylor said he intended to topple Doe's
government. Another rebel leader, Prince Johnson, split with Taylor
and now controls much of Monrovia.

<HEAD>States Raised Taxes by $7.6 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States increased taxes by an estimated $7.6
billion during 1990 legislative sessions, pushed by higher costs
for schools, prisons and health care, a study released today said.
   In its annual survey of state budgets, the National Conference
of State Legislatures said it expected state finances to continue
to deteriorate in the coming year.
   ``State balances fell throughout fiscal 1990 and for most states
_ including all the larger states _ are now dangerously low,'' the
group said.
   ``The national average balance fell from 4.5 percent of
expenditures at the end of fiscal 1989 to 4 percent at the end of
fiscal 1990, and is expected to fall to 2.3 percent by the end of
fiscal 1991,'' it said.
   Those balances are considered indicators of state fiscal
conditions, and many states try to maintain a balance of 5 percent
of general fund spending. The balance is considered a cushion
against emergencies for states required by law or constitution to
have balanced budgets.
   The NCSL released its report at its annual meeting, being held
this week in Nashville, Tenn.
   The report said many state fiscal conditions weakened during the
last year. Northeast and New England states were the hardest hit.
   Tax increases were passed in 23 states. Those tax increases are
expected to increase revenue by $7.6 billion in fiscal 1991, an
increase of 2.6 percent of state tax collections.
   The study said spending for Medicaid, education and corrections
grew faster than general state revenue. Medicaid spending grew at a
25 percent annual rate, putting pressure on state budgets.
   Of the three major types of taxes, 10 states increased personal
income taxes, the report said. Ten raised corporate income taxes
and 17 raised sales and use taxes.
   The biggest tax increases were in New Jersey, Massachusetts,
Florida, New York, Kentucky and Texas.
   Other states raising taxes were: Connecticut, Maine, New
Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, Delaware, Ohio, Kansas, Nebraska,
Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee, Virginia, Arizona, New Mexico,
Oklahoma and Washington.
   New Jersey's increase totaled $2.2 billion, or 21 percent of
1989 revenue, the report said. Massachusetts' increase was $1.16
billion, or 12.8 percent, and Florida's was $1.09 billion, or 8.7
percent, the report said.
   States listed as lowering taxes were: Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota,
South Carolina, Utah and Hawaii. All of the decreases were small,
the report said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Chest-Beating on Iraq's Invasion of Kuwait</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Within 24 hours of the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, the House was ready to roar with its condemnation. It was
chest-beating time.
   A resolution calling for an embargo against Iraq arrived for a
vote so quickly that few in the chamber had read it. Rep. Bob
Walker, R-Pa., asked for a few hours' delay. He was ignored.
   As lawmakers streamed in, Rep. Bob Mrazek, D-N.Y., stood in an
aisle urging his colleagues to support the measure.
   ``End the war, end the war, please vote yes,'' he said loudly.
``They're pulling out as we speak, because they never expected us
to do this.''
   Not surprisingly, the measure passed with breathtaking speed and
with no opposition.
   Mrazek's dry humor reflects something most lawmakers readily
acknowledge but like to pretend isn't true: Congress' role is very
limited when it comes to fast-moving world events.
   The House bill called for something President Bush already was
doing on his own _ retaliating economically against Iraq with an
embargo.
   To understand why Congress acted so quickly, the bill must be
put in context.
   Congress is a frustratingly slow and complex place to work, and
laced with political traps. At the same time, lawmakers are
desperately eager to get involved, vent their frustrations and cast
their votes in a politically popular way.
   In foreign affairs _ as in the domestic arena _ Congress' power
is in the control of the purse. But the House and Senate foreign
affairs committees are largely ineffective in this crucial area.
   So for the committees and for Congress as a whole, these foreign
affairs resolutions provide welcome relief.
   As Mrazek implied, few expected the resolution to have any
effect on Iraq or its president, Saddam Hussein.
   ``It would be very foolish to think that a resolution of
sanctions by the United States would have deterred an otherwise
reckless, irresponsible, illegal and dangerous action,'' said House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash. ``I think it is a matter of
expressing our strong disapproval and concern.''
   ``Break Hussein's arm,'' said Rep. William S. Broomfield,
R-Mich., senior Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
``President Bush has a fistful of hard-hitting options. He should
choose one, and choose one now.''
   The House beat the Senate to the punch in this case, but it
doesn't always. In fact, the Senate quickly passes resolutions on
most noteworthy international events _ and, according to Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., sometimes without enough regard for what
they mean.
   It's a well-worn cliche that Congress consists of 535
secretaries of state, but it's more like 535 imitation secretaries
of state.
   Few lawmakers have any true expertise in international affairs.
And their votes on matters affecting other nations are filtered
through the one area in which nearly everyone on Capitol Hill is
truly expert: getting re-elected.
   Since the direct affect on constituents of any foreign affairs
resolution is minimal, it doesn't take long to decide how to vote.
   ``Most of the time it doesn't matter,'' Dole said in a recent
speech on the Senate floor. But sometimes, he said, it does.
   On a trip to the Middle East, Dole found that a Senate
resolution on Jerusalem _ passed without controversy by lawmakers
wanting to show support for Israel and to maintain their own
support in the Jewish community _ was causing consternation there
at a critical juncture in the peace process.
   ``They believe there is still some sense in the Senate, in what
we do and say,'' he said. ``And they despair ... when they see that
sometimes, too often, what we really deal in is the nonsense of the
Senate.''

<HEAD>House Armed Services Chairman Outlines Military Choices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are the United States' military options,
as outlined by House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin,
D-Wis., should Iraq invade Saudi Arabia.
   Aspin discussed the choices on the CBS news program ``Face the
Nation'' on Sunday.
   Asked if the United States would launch an attack in the event
of an invasion, Aspin said:
   ``I think that the question _ the answer is yes. I think that's
almost inevitable. Those Saudi oil fields are so important to the
national security of the United States, and I'm assuming that when
the invasion comes that Saudi Arabia would say `OK,' I would think
we would do it.''
   Aspin said the attack could be managed, although the Iraqi army
is larger.
   ``Well, I guess the first question is, can you do it with air
power? I mean, it's a race to the oil fields. Basically, the oil
fields are the key, and the Iraqis, presumably, most intelligence
think, would go right down the Gulf Coast heading for the Saudi
Arabian oil fields, and it's a race to the oil fields.
   ``Now what we have available to stop that first and foremost
would be some air power. Not probably as much as we ought to have
in the region, but some air power. The question is can you stop the
invading Iraqi force with air power alone?''
   Asked whether the Iraqis would be able to use the powerful
anti-aircraft missiles supplied by the Soviets, Aspin said:
   ``No, no. I think that's not a danger in the area of Saudi
Arabia. They would be moving down with tanks. It's a great
territory to go with tanks. It's flat, it's hard, they could move
very quickly with tanks, but they're in the open. There's no cover.
There's no concealment. It's essentially the air power against the
tanks. I would guess maybe a 1-in-4 chance of stopping those _ and
also as you said at the show here today is the logistics problem.''
   Besides trying to stop Iraq with air power, Aspin said there are
two other things America could do.
   ``None of this is ideal, but option number two is to carry the
war to Baghdad, in other words, to, when the war comes, use air
power and go after the Iraqi homeland. The third option _ high risk
_ high risk _ and it needs Saudi Arabia to invite us in early
enough _ in other words, before the attack _ is to land some
American ground forces along that route down to the Saudi oil
fields.
   ``We can't get enough in there to protect the oil fields, but
essentially get enough in there as a trip wire, a deterrence. And
the message to Mr. Hussein would be, `If you attack those American
troops, right along that line, I mean that is war right to the end.'
   ``Now, those troops would be vastly out-gunned. They would have
to retreat very quickly, but it would essentially be the kind of
thing like the brigade _ like the brigade we had in Berlin through
all the years of the Cold War. I mean, they were there more as a
symbol of anything and as a deterrence than as an effective
military force. High risk to put U.S. troops in that kind of
situation.''

<HEAD>Army Intervention, 25 Percent Raises End Banana Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDDY CUEVAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Threatened with dismissal after the
government sent in troops to end their 41-day strike, banana
workers have accepted 25.4 percent pay hikes and agreed to go back
to work.
   President Rafael Leonardo Callejas announced late Sunday that
the 10,000 Chiquita Brand International workers had accepted his
offer ``without any conditions.'' They were to be back on the job
today.
   The army removed 4,000 strikers from company installations on
Saturday, and a military source said at least two strikers and two
security policemen were wounded by gunfire in the takeover in La
Lima, 180 miles north of Tegucigalpa. A union spokesman said two
other strikers were beaten.
   Under the agreement, troops will remain at Chiquita ``until
banana production is totally normalized.''
   In a statement, the government said: ``The strike movement,
provoked by irresponsible union leaders, threatened to destroy
Honduran democracy as well as causing enormous, irreparable damage
to the national economy.''
   Chiquita Brand produces and exports 60 percent of Honduras'
banana crop, the country's main source of foreign exchange, and
preliminary government estimates said the strike caused $60 million
in losses.
   ``There are no winners or losers,'' Callejas said on nationwide
radio and television. ``The situation was overcome so that we can
face the enormous problems that afflict the nation.''
   ``Free unionism has, the same as the companies and institutions
in which it operates, the enormous responsibility of sharing with
the government social stability as the basic priniciple of peaceful
coexistence,'' he said.
   The increase will raise the average banana worker's pay from
$246 a month to $308.50. Negotiations were to continue today on
sick leave and other points. The strikers walked out on June 25,
demanding an increase of 60 percent.
   The wage increase the union accepted was the same one it had
rejected on Friday. Chiquita had on Saturday refused the union's
counterproposal.
   Several hundred soldiers and police then ousted the workers and
occupied La Lima, a city of 60,000. The government announced in
repeated broadcasts that it was giving Chiquita a free hand to
replace the striking workers but said they still could return to
their jobs.
   Karl F. Koch, local manager of Chiquita, and Rene Ayestas, the
union president, signed the agreement.

<HEAD>Air Force Has Champagne Taste</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force has spent hundreds of millions
of dollars on gold-plated chandeliers, golf course projects and
other luxuries to boost morale, internal Pentagon documents show.
   Back in 1985, the Air Force decided to refurbish its officers'
club at the Mildenhall base in Britain at a cost of $75,000. The
service's champagne taste, however, hardly matched the appropriated
amount.
   Gold-plated chandeliers valued at $145,000 were installed, solid
oak paneling lined the walls and fireplaces with marble fixtures
completed the decor. The final tally was more than $2 million with
U.S. taxpayers picking up the tab.
   The internal Air Force audits, conducted in April and May of
this year, reveal widespread waste and abuse in the Air Force
management of its Morale, Welfare and Recreation Activities.
   Golf course projects at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base cost nearly
$600,000, while parties for a departing officer at Ramstein Air
Base in Germany totaled $26,000.
   In a letter to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Rep. Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif., called for leadership from the highest levels of
the Pentagon to crack down on these abuses.
   The documents reveal ``a mindset among some senior Air Force
officials that the bases they command are their own personal
fiefdoms, with appropriated funds to be used at their discretion
regardless of law and regulation,'' Boxer said in the letter.
   According to the documents, strict restrictions on excessive
spending on renovation projects have been either ignored or
circumvented. Projects valued at more than $500,000 must be
reported to Congress. In some instances, however, major projects
were split into smaller projects to avoid seeking congressional
approval.
   Even the Air Force auditors expressed dismay at the renovation
projects.
   In the documents, Air Force management at the base in England
argued that the chandeliers couldn't be standard-issue.
   ``Low quality chandeliers could not act as the main
architectural highlight of a room as the existing chandeliers do.
The crystal used would not have the capability to break apart the
available light in a room into its primary colors (prism effect),''
the Air Force said.
   In response, the auditors said ``spending an additional $15,900
in appropriated funds to purchase chandeliers that have the correct
`prism effect' is not appropriate.''
   Other instances of abuse include relocation of a skeet shooting
club at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma. The estimated cost of
the project was $722,000 and it was included in the cost of a
construction project for basing of the B-2 stealth bomber.
   But when it was discovered that the project was $1 million over
budget, the Air Force proposed eliminating the work stations at the
facility rather than the Skeet Club.
   ``I find it appalling that the weaknesses in the management and
oversight of Morale, Welfare and Recreation operations have been
repeatedly documented by Defense Department auditors,
whistleblowers and Congress, that hundreds of millions of dollars
are being illegally spent on parties, golf courses and officers
clubs, yet internal recommendations to remedy the problems have
been ignored,'' Boxer said in the letter.

<HEAD>NEA Turns Down Bid to Bar Support For `Point of View' Projects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An advisory council to the National Endowment
for the Arts is rejecting a proposal to bar support for any project
that advances a particular point of view.
   The proposal, offered Sunday by Dr. Jacob Neusner, a professor
of religious studies at the University of South Florida at Tampa,
was defeated 10-2, with one abstention.
   John Frohnmayer, the chairman of the government arts endowment,
said he ``strongly opposed'' the restriction because it represented
``the highest degree of insensitivity.''
   The proposal would have barred support for any project that
``advocates or promotes a particular political, ideological,
religious or partisan point of view.''
   The advisory group, the National Council on the Arts, which
Frohnmayer also heads, instead adopted a proposal reaffirming the
endowment's commitment ``to bring quality art to the American
people'' by fair procedures, careful analysis and an opposition to
obscenity.
   The NEA has been under heavy fire from conservatives since it
funded an exhibit by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe that included
works some considered obscene.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rebounded
slightly Monday afternoon from a dramatic morning fall to close
sharply down on the day, while the dollar closed slightly up
against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 916.23
points, or 3.1 percent, on trading of an estimated 330 million
shares. The index closed at 28,599.53 points.
   The morning's drop of 1,106.69 points, or 3.7 percent, would
have been the seventh-largest fall in exchange history if sustained.
   The sudden fall followed Tokyo's announcement Sunday night that
it would impose tough sanctions on Iraq as punishment for its
invasion of oil-rich Kuwait. The index lost 729.42 points Friday,
the day after the invasion.
   Meanwhile, the dollar finished the day at 149.50, up 0.15 yen
from Friday's close of 149.35 yen. It ranged between 149.40 yen and
150.35 yen during the day's trading.
   In bond markets, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond was 7.960 percent at the close of trading,
up from 7.705 percent Friday.
   The bond price slid to 83.60 points from 84.72 points.
   Worries about higher oil prices and a tighter monetary policy to
combat inflation drove the market fall, said Yoshiro Inoue, an
analyst with Nomura Securities.
   ``But it is not as bad as during the oil shock (of 1973-74).
Japan, Europe and the United States have reduced their oil imports.
Oil prices will probably creep up, so inflation won't rise
suddenly,'' he said.
   He said he thought the market might rebound during the week.
   Another influence on the current economy is the lack of the
commmodity boom that plagued the early 1970s, said Ed Merner, an
analyst at Schroders Investment Management Japan.
   With the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
controlling a smaller percentage of the world's oil output than two
decades ago, ``Not only Japan, but also the world is in a very good
position. I think people in Japan probably overreacted,'' Merner
said.
   But the Middle East situation, and the sanctions announced
Sunday, added one more piece of bad news to a market that has been
heading down since the beginning of the year, he said.
   Japan announced Sunday that it was banning all purchases of oil
from Iraq and Kuwait, as well as all Japanese exports to the two
countries, suspending loans and banning all Japanese investments
there.
   Japanese companies are still trying to collect $3.3 billion in
credits from Iraq. Bankers speaking anonymously said they thought
the debts were not as big a concern as their size might indicate
because they had been difficult to collect for a long time, and
Japanese companies must have accepted that.
   Japan received 6.2 percent of its oil needs from Iraq in the
first quarter of 1990, importing 260,000 barrels a day, and
obtained 5 percent of its oil from Kuwait, or 210,000 barrels a day.
   Japan's current oil stockpile is estimated at about 142 days.
   The stockpile was expanded over the weekend when Japanese
companies bought huge amounts of oil from Iraq at a premium of a
dollar per barrel, industry sources said.

   Pop singer Janet Jackson passed out backstage
after performing three songs at the St. Louis Arena, a spokeswoman
says.
   Jackson, 24, was treated for exhaustion Sunday at Barnes
Hospital and was released, said a hospital administrator who would
not give her name.
   ``She opened with `Control,' `Nasty' and then `What Have You
Done For Me Lately,''' said Maureen O'Connor, her spokeswoman.
``Then she excused herself and passed out backstage.''
   The singer, who canceled a performance last Thursday in
Lexington, Ky., has suffered from exhaustion and flu-like symptoms,
O'Connor said. Sunday night's show in St. Louis had been postponed
from the night before, O'Connor said.
   Jackson's tour began March 1 and concludes Sept. 4 in Richfield,
Ohio.

<HEAD>2nd Blackout in Eight Days Hits Chicago's West Side</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government officials and consumer advocates are
demanding investigations into the cause of a blackout that left
25,000 West Side customers without power for the second time in
eight days.
   Residents and business owners also insisted Commonwealth Edison
reimburse them for their losses Sunday after an explosion and fire
destroyed a substation used to reroute power around a switching
yard that burned July 28.
   Power was restored to all customers in the mostly poor
neighborhood about 7{ hours later, Commonwealth Edison spokesman
Bob Berdelle said.
   There was none of the looting that followed the July 28
blackout, which left 40,000 residents without power, some for three
days, police said.
   The cause of Sunday's explosion was not immediately known,
Berdelle said.
   The blackout sparked complaints that Commonwealth Edison's
backup systems are inadequate.
   Pat Clark, spokeswoman for the consumer group Citizens Utility
Board, said outages have become all too common in Commonwealth
Edison's service area, and she called on the Illinois Commerce
Commission to expand its probe of July's blackout to include
Sunday's outage _ a move the commission took later in the day.
   Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan renewed his call for an
investigation into the utility's emergency plans. Fire officials
began an investigation, and the city will form a committee to study
Chicago's utilities and recommend safeguards against failures, said
Mayor Richard M. Daley.
   ``The people who live in those areas are just pulling their
lives together from last week. Now they're hit by a one-two punch
from Commonwealth Edison,'' the mayor said. ``Commonwealth Edison
owes them for all they've been through.''
   Commonwealth Edison will probably not pay claims for damages
unless the utility is found to have been negligent, Berdelle said.
   ``We try to have perfect service to everybody all the time, and
that's just impossible,'' said Don Petkus, Commonwealth Edison vice
president. ``It's a system that relies on technology that
occasionally fails.''
   About 13,000 homes and businesses in the metropolitan area were
without power at other periods Saturday and Sunday because of four
smaller outages unrelated to the blackout. An opossum that knocked
out a transformer and three other malfunctions caused blackouts of
between 40 minutes and more than three hours in the five suburbs
and on Chicago's South Side, the utility said.
   Police said an additional 200 officers were sent to the West
Side after the second blackout hit. No arrests were made, said Sgt.
Chris Lewis.
   Manny Patel, manager of an ice cream store, said he lost about
$4,000 worth of ice cream last week.
   On Sunday, he said, ``The ice cream was already melting when I
got here.''

   Dethroned heavyweight champion Mike Tyson still
packs a punch at the bank. With an estimated $28.6 million in
income this year, he's the highest paid athlete in the world,
according to Forbes magazine.
   Buster Douglas, little known until he upset Tyson for the
heavyweight title in February, is second at $26 million, followed
by another boxer, Sugar Ray Leonard, at $13 million.
   Next come two race car drivers, Ayrton Senna at $10 million and
Alain Prost at $9 million.
   Forbes lists the top 30 athletes by income in its Aug. 20 issue
and says they will make about $230 million this year, including
salary, winnings and money from endorsements. The magazine said
about one-third of the income from the top 30 comes from
promotional activities.
   In the top 10 are four boxers, three golfers, two race car
drivers and one basketball player. The top 30 include six tennis
players, five from baseball and four each from boxing, golf and
auto racing.
   Jack Nicklaus is sixth on the list at $8.6 million, followed by
fellow golfer Greg Norman and basketball's Michael Jordan tied at
$8.5 million.
   Golfer Arnold Palmer and boxer Evander Holyfield are tied for
ninth at $8.1 million.
   Boris Becker, the top-paid tennis player at $7.2 million, is
11th. Jose Canseco, the highest paid baseball player, is tied for
14th at $6 million, although that includes the $3.5 million signing
bonus from his five-year contract extension that begins in 1991.
   Wayne Gretzky is the highest paid hockey player at $6 million
(tied with Canseco) and Diego Maradona of Argentina and Italy's
Napoli club is the top soccer player at $5 million (19th overall).
Cyclist Greg LeMond is tied for 26th at $4.2 million.
   Two women are on the list, both tennis players: Steffi Graf is
13th at $6.1 million and Gabriela Sabatini is tied for 22nd at $4.5
million.
   Tyson will make $27 million from boxing this year and $1.6
million in outside income, the magazine says. Douglas will make $25
million from boxing and $1 million from endorsements.
   The biggest shares of the two boxers' earnings come from matches
they have signed to fight this year, plus any future deals for
which they're receiving money this year. Tyson is fighting Alex
Stewart in September. Douglas is fighting Holyfield in October.
   Nicklaus and Palmer head the outside income list, each at $8
million. The magazine estimates Nicklaus will earn $600,000 from
golf this year and Palmer $100,000.

<HEAD>13 Arrested in Hiroshima Protests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of anti-nuclear demonstrators gathered at defense
installations in Tennessee, South Carolina and Pennsylvania to mark
today's 45th anniversary of the dropping of the atom bomb on
Hiroshima. Thirteen people were arrested.
   In Oak Ridge, Tenn., 10 protesters were arrested Sunday for
trespassing at the Y-12 Plant, where uranium for the bomb was
prepared. About 150 peace activists took part in a religious
service and hours of speeches at the gates.
   ``Take it apart, tear it down and put it to rest forever,''
Colvin Idol told the cheering crowd. He said the bombings of
Hiroshima and, later, Nagasaki, were motivated by racism.``I
believe it would have never been dropped on white people who look
like us,'' he told the virtually all-white crowd.
   More than 250 people took part in a vigil Sunday outside the
Savannah River nuclear weapons plant to remember Hiroshima's
victims and to protest plans to restart a reactor at the site near
Aiken, S.C., in December or January.
   Hal French, a religious studies professor at the University of
South Carolina, called the attack on Hiroshima ``one of the primary
traumas of the 20th century.''
   ``We're all of us, in a very real sense, atomic bomb survivors.
And we're all of us, in a prophetic sense, atomic bomb victims,''
he said.
   About 140,000 people died in the Aug. 6, 1945 blast, the world's
first atomic bomb attack. Three days later, the United States
dropped an A-bomb on Nagasaki, killing 70,000 civilians. Japan
surrendered on August 15, 1945, ending the war.
   In Liberty Township, Pa., three people were arrested Sunday for
trespassing at a site that would be used as a command center in the
event of nuclear war.
   The three spent the night praying and singing with about 30
peace activists before crossing the road to read a statement
outside the installation, said Elizabeth Small, one of those
arrested.
   ``These facilities are no longer justified in terms of the world
situation,'' she said. ``Even if nuclear weapons are never used, we
really steal from the poor and our children. One out of four
children lives in poverty and if that is not an attack on our
national defense, I don't know what is.''

<HEAD>Prices Down Sharply on Exchange</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices dropped sharply today on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, reflecting wide uncertainty about the long-term effects
on oil prices and interest rates of Japanese sanctions against Iraq.
   Meanwhile the dollar closed slightly up against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at
28,599.53 points, down 916.23 points, or 3.1 percent, on trading of
an estimated 330 million shares. The index lost 729.42 points
Friday, the day after Iraq's invasion.
   The index fell 1,106.69 points, or 3.7 percent, in morning
trading in response to the government announcement Sunday night
that Tokyo would ban all oil imports from Iraq and Kuwait, and
Japanese exports to the two countries.
   Analysts said they expected the market to rebound if the Middle
East situation did not further deteriorate. They said Japan's
economy is still strong, has a 142-day oil stockpile and is less
dependent on oil imports than during the Arab oil embargo of
1973-74.
   ``The market should rebound later in the week,'' said Yoshiro
Inoue, an analyst with Nomura Securities.
   ``Overall, the economy should remain strong _ unless all falls
apart (in the Middle East),'' said Ed Merner, an investment analyst
and manager for Schroders Investment Management Japan.
   Yutaka Yoshino of Nikko Securities said that rising interest
rates as well as an increase in the the yield of government bonds
also influenced the market Monday.
   Industry officials said they would comply with the sanctions.
   Yasuoki Takeuchi, chairman of the Petroleum Association of
Japan, said the sanctions against Iraq were unavoidable and that
companies would look for other sources of petroleum.
   ``The government decision is a necessary measure to prompt an
early withdrawal of Iraqi troops (from Kuwait). Our company will
follow this decision,'' Kentaro Iwamoto, president of Nippon Oil,
said in a statement.
   Nippon Oil imported 30,000 barrels a day from Iraq in the first
half of this year and had planned to import about the same amount
in the second half, a spokesman said.
   While companies said they were in no immediate danger of
dwindling stockpiles, industry sources said Japanese companies
bought an additional 4 to 5 million barrels of Iranian oil over the
weekend.
   The sanctions also could effect Japanese engineering companies,
which have large investments in Iraq.
   Tokyo Engineering lost 20 percent of its value in two days'
trading, said Mahmoud Ghaemmaghami, manager of research for West LB
Securities Pacific Ltd. ``I'm not sure any contracts have been
cancelled, but the market always sees or reads these things in
advance,'' he said.
   Japanese companies are still trying to collect about $3.3
billion in credits from Iraq. Japan and Iraq had agreed to a
repayment scheme several weeks ago, but progress toward repayment
ended with the invasion, a source said.
   A spokesman for Mitsubishi, the top Japanese trader with Iraq,
said it was too early to tell how the sanctions would effect his
company. He described the situation as ``very delicate.''
   Japan received 6.2 percent of its oil needs from Iraq in the
first quarter of 1990, importing 260,000 barrels a day, and
obtained 5 percent of its oil from Kuwait, or 210,000 barrels a day.
   Meanwhile, the dollar finished at 149.50 yen, up 0.15 yen from
last Friday's close of 149.35 yen. It ranged between 149.40 yen and
150.35 yen the the day's trading. Currency market action was
described as hectic by dealers.
   In bond markets, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 7.960 percent as of the close of
trading from Friday's close of 7.705 percent. Their price slid to
83.60 points from 84.72 points.

<HEAD>Motorists Complaining of Price Gouging at Gasoline Pumps</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. gasoline prices have jumped 2 to 15 cents a gallon at the
pump since the Iraqi invasion of oil-rich Kuwait, prompting
complaints of price gouging and demands for an investigation.
   Price boosts since Thursday's invasion stretched from coast to
coast.
   ``It's not a very pretty picture at this time,'' said Al Elkins,
executive director of the Oregon Gasoline Dealers Association.
   Motorists have accused station owners of jacking up prices
unnecessarily and using the Iraqi invasion as an excuse. Station
owners blame the big oil companies for what Elkins called ``good
old-fashioned greed.''
   ``We don't believe the situation warrants any price increase at
this time,'' he said.
   Many oil companies sell more gas than they refine during the
heavy-driving summer months, so they have to supplement their
supplies by buying on the volitile spot market, said John Lord,
spokesman for Mobil Oil Co. in New York.
   Lord on Sunday said many oil companies are apparently
anticipating higher costs from the Iraq-Kuwait war.
   ``When you know future costs are going to go up, if you can
recover some of those costs today, you're going to do it if the
price will hold,'' he said. ``I think that's what's going on in the
marketplace.''
   BP Oil Co. told West Cost station managers to mark up prices 7.5
to 9 cents a gallon, said Anne Straiff, spokeswoman at the
company's Cleveland headquarters.
   Richard Kessel, executive director of the New York Consumer
Protection Board, said Sunday that gas prices have gone up an
average of 4 or 5 cents a gallon since the invasion.
   Kessel, who is investigating the price hike for New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo, said there have been reports of increases up to 15
cents a gallon in the area.
   ``The governor directed us to begin an investigation of whether
these increases are justified,'' he said. ``The product that is
being purchased now at the pump is product that was refined well
before the invasion.''
   Mark Dyen, president of Fair Share Energy Development Corp. of
Boston, said price hikes were the result of oil companies and
traders preying on panic.
   ``It's all smoke,'' Dyen said. ``The price (increase) hits
almost as quickly as the news, whereas the oil itself might take
almost 30 to 90 days to get here.''
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., on Friday urged a federal
investigation of the U.S. oil industry.
   ``There is absolutely no reason consumers should already be
paying more for oil and gas,'' he said. ``It's either panic or
profiteering. Either way it must be stopped.''
   Massachusetts motorists, already paying higher gasoline prices
because of a recent tax boost of 6 cents a gallon, complained of
increases of up to 6 cents since the Iraqi invasion.
   ``I just don't understand how automatically, less than 24 hours
after this thing happened, they already have a price increase on
the board,'' Boston motorist Jerry Whelan said.
   Motorists elsewhere also were angry.
   ``People think it's outrageous,'' said Joe Hedricks, a clerk at
a Harrisonburg, Va., Chevron station. ``I tell them I don't have
anything to do with it.''
   The price at Hedricks' station went up 9 cents a gallon on all
blends since Friday. Prices rose by about 5 cents a gallon by
Friday at many Richmond and Norfolk stations in Virginia and went
up 4 to 9 cents a gallon in Denver.

<HEAD>Archdiocese Announces Investigation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta says it
will investigate whether church funds went improperly to a woman
whose intimate relationships with an archbishop and a priest led to
their resignations.
   Bishop James Lyke, acting administrator of the archdiocese,
ordered an audit of financial records at the archdiocese and two
churches where the Rev. Michael Woods was pastor.
   Church officials announced Saturday that Woods resigned from St.
Jude the Apostle Church after confessing to an intimate
relationship with Vicki R. Long, 27. Woods had been Ms. Long's
pastor at another church where she was a lay minister.
   Lyke last week disclosed that Archbishop Eugene Marino, who
resigned last month, had an intimate, two-year relationship with
Ms. Long. Church officials initially said Marino resigned for
health reasons.
   Lyke ordered the nvestigation to ``put to rest any concerns''
that church funds were used improperly, the Rev. Peter Dora, an
Archdiocese spokesman, said Sunday.
   Ms. Long received $1,500 monthly payments, apparently from
Marino, but no church money was involved, Lyke said.
   The church has not yet accepted Woods' resignation or decided
whether to discipline him, Dora said. He said an investigation will
be conducted.
   ``He is in seclusion. As for his future, we just don't know,''
Dora said.
   Marino, the nation's first black archbishop and highest ranking
black Roman Catholic, has not commented publicly on his
relationship with Ms. Long, who has refused to comment.
   Ms. Long has charged that another priest, Rev. Donal Keohane of
Columbus, Ga., fathered her daughter born in 1986. Blood tests
concluded he was not the father, but the archdiocese is paying her
child support.

   The dollar fell sharply in thin trading in Europe
this morning as investors switched their attention form the Persian
Gulf to the weakness of the U.S. economy.
   Gold prices rose.
   Traders said the market would continue to monitor the situation
in the Gulf closely, although the relative lull in developments had
shifted attention back to the underlying weakness of the U.S.
economy.
   Higher oil prices following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait were
regarded as further bad news for U.S. economic prospects.
   Weak U.S. employment data Friday rekindled perceptions that
further easing in U.S. interest rates is inevitable, traders said.
   ``The dollar had gained impulsively (on news of Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait), and now people are seeing where it's real support
really lies,'' one trader said.
   Foreign exchange traders predicted the dollar would trade
narrowly during the day since no major economic data was scheduled
for release.
   Many market players also were away on summer holidays, dealers
said.
   ``In this kind of market, if even one player comes in and
shortens his position, the impact is striking,'' one Milan trader
said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.15 yen to a closing 149.50 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 149.60 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.5769 West German marks, down from 1.5920
   _1.3340 Swiss francs, down from 1.3505
   _5.2870 French francs, down from 5.3345
   _1.7778 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7945
   _1,153.50 Italian lire, down from 1,164.90
   _1.1487 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1510
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, which was
quoted at $1.8725, compared with $1.8570 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $378.00 a troy ounce,
down from $379.25 bid late Friday. But at midmorning, the city's
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $380.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $380 up from $378 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.20 to close at a bid $378.58.
   Silver held steady in London at a bid price of $4.87 a troy
ounce.

   Three years ago, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
conceded it was ``only too true'' to say that Japan was getting a
free ride through the turmoil of warfare in the Persian Gulf.
   Now Nakasone is out of office and the Iran-Iraq war has been
supplanted by the Iraqi seizure of Kuwait.
   Japan, for a change, is showing itself willing to take a hit in
the pocketbook as the price of taking a stand against Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's aggression in the world's biggest
oil-producing region.
   The sanctions announced Sunday are the toughest this country has
imposed. Fallout from them will affect daily life in Japan, Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu said today.
   Financial markets reacted by selling the yen and driving down
Japanese stocks in anticipation of real economic costs in increased
oil prices and inflationary pressure.
   As a country that imports 99 percent of its oil, including 70
percent from the Middle East, Japan has until now been extremely
cautious in its Middle East policy. But the strong sanctions
announced Sunday night show Tokyo moving toward the global
partnership with the United States and Western Europe that
Washington has encouraged.
   Japan said it will ban imports of oil from Iraq and Kuwait and
all Japanese exports to the two nations. It also will freeze
economic aid and loans to Iraq and suspend investment, financing
and other capital flows to Iraq and Kuwait.
   For much of the weekend, it had appeared Japan's only reaction
would be its issuing Friday of administrative guidance to banks and
financial institutions to freeze Kuwaiti assets in Japan, estimated
at $20 billion.
   The hesitance shows how hard it is to break the habit of basing
foreign policy on domestic economic considerations.
   Japanese news reports said the Foreign Ministry had been urging
the government to join U.S. and European sanctions while the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry argued that sanctions
would badly hurt the Japanese economy.
   ``Sanctions _ Easier Said Than Done,'' said a headline in
Sunday's Mainichi Daily News on an article noting that sanctions
would stop Iaq's repayments on $4.6 billion worth of Japanese loans.
   In the end, U.S. pressure helped tip the balance. President Bush
telephoned Kaifu on Saturday urging Tokyo to join tough sanctions,
and all 100 members of the U.S. Senate urged Japan to take
``mandatory and comprehensive'' sanctions against Iraq.
   Growing more than 4 percent annually in recent years, the
Japanese economy is less reliant on oil than it was during the
1973-74 ``oil shock,'' when the Arab oil embargo knocked Japan into
a recession. Then, oil provided 78 percent of Japan's energy needs,
as opposed to 57 percent now.
   Japan received 6.2 percent of its oil from Iraq in the first
quarter of 1990, importing an average of 260,000 barrels a day. It
obtained 5 percent of its oil from Kuwait, or 210,000 barrels a
day, according to the trade ministry.
   Japanese companies were criticized for buying up Iranian oil in
1979 during the U.S.-Iran dispute, and later when tankers were
attacked by both sides in the Iran-Iraq war, it came under fire for
not doing more to help freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf.
   Nakasone, who tried to lead Japan into a more world-oriented
posture during his 1982-87 tenure as prime minister, said in 1987
that Japan would be isolated if it didn't aid in the international
effort to let oil flow out of the Persian Gulf to Japan and other
nations.
   Japan subsequently paid for a $10 million navigation system to
monitor ship movements in the gulf and made a generous package of
loans to Jordan and other pro-Western countries to try to promote
stability in the Middle East.
   Those measures, and a more evenhanded policy toward Israel, were
touted as steps toward a more active Japanese policy in the region.
   Earlier this year, Japan offered $1.95 billion in economic aid
to Poland and Hungary, flexing its wealth in another region where,
like the Middle East, Japan had kept a low profile.
   The surprisingly strong sanctions announced against Baghdad show
another area where Japan is willing to forge a new policy despite
economic risk.

   Oil prices jumped more than three dollars a barrel
today on news Europe and Japan were joining the embargo of Iraqi
and Kuwait oil.
   Stock prices plummeted in Tokyo and London on fears that higher
oil prices would spur inflation and bring higher interest rates.
   The dollar was lower on concerns about the effect of high oil
prices on the U.S. economy, and gold prices moved slightly higher.
   The spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded
international crude oil, was trading at $26.59 a barrel in London
this morning, up from Friday's closing price of $23.48.
   Traders attributed the rise to the weekend news that the
European Community and Japan had joined the United States in its
embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude oil in an effort to put economic
pressure on Baghdad after its invasion of Kuwait last week.
   Traders said volume was thin.
   Futures prices did not rise as strongly as the spot price,
suggesting that an initial hiccup in world oil supplies could
gradually be overcome by increased supplies from some OPEC member
countries with extra production capacity.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at
28,599.53 points, down 916.23 points, or 3.1 percent.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share index fell 47.8
points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,236.8 by 11 a.m.
   The yen fell because Japan imports nearly all its oil and is
therefore especially vulnerable to disruption to oil supplies.

<HEAD>ANC, Government Discuss Ways To Start Constitutional Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The South African government and
the African National Congress began talks today to try to clear the
way for full-scale constitutional negotiations on ending
white-minority rule.
   President F.W. de Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela, leading
five-man delegations, arrived separately at a state mansion on the
outskirts of Pretoria. Neither leader said anything to waiting
jouranlists as their convoys swept through the gates.
   All leading South African newspapers carried reports Sunday that
the ANC was expected to declare a cease-fire if there was progress
in today's talks. An agreement would clear the way for full talks,
probably early next year, according to political sources.
   The news reports said the two sides expect to reach agreement on
releasing political prisoners and allowing return of political
exiles to South Africa. The government is also expected to meet ANC
demands for a review of security laws that have been used to
suppress political activity.
   ``The government would like to see immediate progresss on the
negotiations. It would like to see negotiations take off. But
negotiations cannot take place if there is no climate of
stability,'' the Sunday Star quoted an unidentified government
official as saying.
   The Sunday Times reported that as many as 1,300 political
prisoners could be released and some 22,000 political exiles could
be returned to South Africa.
   A special committee will consider disputed cases of prisoners
who the ANC says are political prisoners but the government claims
are criminals, it said.
   The release of political prisoners and return of exiles have
been major stumbling blocks to clearing the way for full-scale
talks. The ANC has said it will not take part in such talks until
these issues are resolved.
   De Klerk has countered by demanding the ANC end its armed
struggle.
   The ANC's armed struggle virtually collapsed because of internal
problems, the drying up of support following the fall of communist
regimes in Eastern Europe and the superiority of the South African
military.
   But Mandela has refused to formally renounce the armed struggle
despite intense pressure from the government and many Western
nations anxious for a peaceful settlement in South Africa. He has
said the government must make equal concessions before the ANC
declares a cease-fire.
   The two sides are also likely to seek a greater effort to end
the growing wave of violence that has hit South Africa in recent
months, mainly between rival black groups.
   A special committee was set up after the first round of
ANC-government talks in May to consider ways to settle outstanding
disputes, including political prisoners.
   An agreement today would open the way for formal talks on ending
white rule and giving political rights to the black majority. The
government has already begun dismantling apartheid laws, although
substantial restrictions remain.
   De Klerk legalized the ANC and other black opposition groups
Feb. 2. He freed Mandela Feb. 11 after 27 years in jail for
fighting apartheid.
   De Klerk has promised to end white-minority rule and find a new
political ``dispensation'' for the country.

<HEAD>Dodge City Fires Back After Dinkins' Remark</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dodge City, Kan., population 21,000, had one
reported homicide in the last 20 months, according to its city
manager, Jim Witt.
   New York City has one homicide every 4 hours, 37 minutes.
   So it's no wonder the folks in Dodge City fired back when Mayor
David Dinkins invoked their town's name last week to defend his
city.
   ``This is not Dodge City,'' Dinkins snapped angrily when
questioned about his commitment to crime fighting after four child
homicides.
   The Kansans are used to the comparison, but they wish Dinkins
hadn't shot his mouth off.
   ``It gets a little old,'' said Witt. ``Our murder rate is
nowhere near New York, Washington, Chicago. It's not paradise, with
zero crime, but we don't have that kind of violence.''
   Between 1876 and 1885, the first years that records were kept,
Dodge City had 15 homicides, said Betty Braddock of the Kansas
Heritage Center.
   ``Violence wasn't wanton, it was more man to man. There was
always a reason,'' said Braddock. ``It could be a fight over
gambling, or a girl, but it wasn't somebody just blowing out a
door.''
   Kansans blame Dodge City's undeserved reputation for violence on
media hype.
   ``The one thing about Dodge is that the newspapers blew it all
up,'' Frederic Young, a Dodge City native and historian. ``It was
fun to write about, they'd exaggerate a little ... They didn't
worry much about the laws of libel.''
   Much of New York's violence is attributable to drug dealers with
Uzis; back then, it was drunken cowboys with Colts, Young said. New
York recorded 1,905 homicides last year; Dodge City's big year was
six in 1878.
   Then again, Dodge City had 4,000 residents; New York has 7.5
million. The murder rate was 1.5 murders per 1,000 people in Dodge
to 0.26 per 1,000 in New York, but the numbers are misleading, the
historians said.
   ``There really wasn't that much violence here,'' said Young.
``It was worse in the towns southwest of here, in New Mexico and
Arizona. There were mostly isolated incidents here.''
   Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp were responsible for law
enforcement in the town. Both were more likely to be found sipping
a drink in the Long Branch Saloon than gunning down criminals on
Front Street.
   Masterson wound up coming to New York once the West was won in
1916, and he became a sports columist at the New York Morning
Telegraph. Earp was more of a career lawmen, but Braddock isn't
sure he'd help things in New York now anyway.
   ``If Wyatt Earp was here, we'd send him back,'' Braddock said.
``But we gave you Bat Masterson, and you didn't do much with him.''

<HEAD>Political Feud Speeds German Unification</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Social Democrats issuing more
calls for quick unification; No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A labor union and the second-largest parties
in both German states said today East Germany can only be saved by
dissolving it soon and that German unification may happen this week.
   Pressure built for East Germany to solve its worsening economic
problems by immediately dissolving itself and turning the shambles
of its economy over to wealthy West Germany.
   But at the root of the debate is an intense political feud by
parties jockeying to use unification to their best political
advantage in upcoming united German elections.
   Horst Ehmke, deputy chairman of the West German Social
Democrats, said today that East Germany could vote this week on a
clause in the West German constitution that would result in
immediate unification.
   ``The economic, social and financial developments in (East
Germany) are going downhill at such a speed that I would not be
astonished if we had a very fast unity,'' he said on West German
radio.
   Earlier, he said East German lawmakers could vote on unification
Wednesday, when the Parliament meets.
   The East German Social Democrats planned to meet today to decide
whether to press this week for a vote on unification, and decide on
Tuesday whether to leave de Maiziere's coalition.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's demand last week to move up
united German elections from Dec. 2 to Oct. 14 has prompted his
chief rivals, the Social Democrats, to seek unity even sooner.
   The two Social Democratic parties are closely allied. They are
the leading opposition in West Germany and part of Prime Minister
Lothar de Maiziere's broad governing coalition in East Germany.
   The left-leaning Social Democrats want elections to remain in
December but unity to take place now. Kohl and his conservative
Christian Democrats want to tie the two together and both to take
place in mid-October.
   The Social Democrats want to delay the vote for a united German
government in the hope that the costs of bailing out East Germany's
collapsing economy will hurt the West German chancellor at the
polls.
   Kohl, for the same reason, wants balloting as quickly as
possible, even if it means changing West Germany's constitutional
timetable for eections.
   Friedrich Bohl, leader of the Christian Democrat faction in the
West German Parliament said unity and elections must be tied
together.
   ``Unity and common elections are two sides of the same coin,''
he said today on West German radio. ``I cannot see carrying out
unity without common elections.''
   The head of the German Trade Union, the largest labor
association in West Germany, with more than 8 million members, also
pressed for immediate unity.
   Labor association chief Heinz-Werner Meyer said the July 1
economic unification of the German states _ when East Germany made
a virtual overnight transition from socialism to a free market _
happened too quickly and will have disastrous effects.
   He said West Germany should take responsibility for advocating
such a quick economic merger by following through with an immediate
political consolidation.
   The deputy chairman of the East German Social Democrats,
Karl-August Kamilli, also called for fast unification today.
   It is up to East Germany to enact unification. That will be done
when its Parliament approves a clause in the West German
constitution that will allow it to accede to its bigger neighbor.
   The Social Democrats have sought to slow unification since it
was first proposed by Kohl early this year.
   By now pressing for quick unity and later elections, they can
appear to embrace the process while still benefitting politically
from elections in December, when the economic woes are expected to
be much worse.
   Kohl, meanwhile, would have to spend more West German money on
East Germany right away, and then perhaps pay for it at the polls
in December.
   Kohl, in an interview on West German television on Sunday,
sidestepped questions about whether taxes would have to be raised
to pay for unification.
   Right now, East German joblessness, while climbing, is being
kept artificially low by a West German-financed program to keep
workers on payrolls at shortened hours and lower wages.
   Without that program, unemployment would likely be more than 10
percent, rather than the 2.7 percent it was estimated at last month.
   Joblessness is expected to eventually reach perhaps 30 percent
or 40 percent.

   Firefighters today tried to hold a fire line
cut around a 3,300-acre blaze that jumped a river canyon, destroyed
28 homes in hopscotch fashion and forced the evacuation of 2,800
people.
   The blaze, which broke out Saturday and raced from treetop to
treetop in the dry woods, destroyed more buildings than any Oregon
forest fire since 1936, said Forestry Department spokesman Jim
Fisher. Damage was put at $4.5 million.
   People were evacuated from at least four motels or resorts and
about 2,000 vacation and regular homes, the department said.
   Firefighters cut a line around the fire late Sunday, and
department spokesman Randall Lau said they hoped to contain it
Tuesday and bring it under control Thursday. The fire was reported
50 percent contained Sunday night.
   Meanwhile today, firefighters in Utah and California were
struggling to contain fires that had consumed about 5,700 acres.
   At eastern Utah's Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation,
firefighters planned a new assault on a fire that has burned more
than 5,400 acres in the Florence Creek area.
   The fire was started by lightning Tuesday in rugged terrain
considered ideal habitat for Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, elk and
deer.
   In central California's Sequoia National Forest, firefighters
tried to surround two brush fires sparked by lightning Sunday
afternoon.
   By late Sunday, one fire had blackened about 250 acres northwest
of Kernville and the other had burned about 60 acres 3{ miles away.
The fires posed no immediate threat to any buildings, firefighters
said.
   About 1,100 firefighters battled the Oregon blaze using 12
helicopters and air tankers. The cost was put at more than
$890,000, Lau said.
   The fire erupted three miles west of downtown Bend, a city of
about 19,000 on the eastern slopes of the Cascade Range, and burned
in near 100-degree heat.
   It raced through the pines, jumping roads and the Deschutes
Riverin a canyon where the river is about 75 feet wide.
   It burned eight well-appointed homes in the Sunset Village
subdivision.
   ``It's real odd the way the fire picked one here and one
there,'' said U.S. Forest Serice spokeswoman Ann Carlson. ``When
you see how hit-and-miss the pattern is, it would have been real
scary to have been in here.''
   The cause of the fire was under investigation, but it was being
called human-caused, since no lightning was present when it
started, officials said.
   The blaze was about a mile away from Central Oregon Community
College on the north and the Inn at the Seventh Mountain on the
south. The 325-unit resort was evacuated Saturday.
   The major north-south highway through central Oregon, U.S. 97,
was reopened Sunday in the fire area after being closed to all but
evacuation traffic.
   Norv Ritchey, whose daughter and son-in-law own the Entrada
Lodge, figured only a miracle saved the motel when the fire came
roaring over the hill.
   ``You could have had every fire truck in the state here and you
wouldn't have saved it,'' he said. ``It just split and went by.''
   The motel, which had been full, was evacuated Saturday evening
when fire bore down on it.
   ``It sounded like a freight train coming over that hill,''
Ritchie said, pointing to the hill covered with ash and the black
skeletal remains of trees. ``We spent the night thinking (the
motel) had burned. It's the Entrada Miracle.''

   A high-explosive device fell off an American
woman's car today but did not explode, Scotland Yard said. Police
suspected the device was planted by the Irish Republican Army.
   Police said the car's owner lived in a home in northwest London
formerly occupied by Robert Armstrong, now Lord Armstrong, who
retired as civil service chief and Cabinet secretary in 1987.
Police refused to identify the car's owner at her request.
   The device was defused and was being examined in the police
laboratory, said Cmdr. George Churchill-Coleman, chief of Scotland
Yard's anti-terrorist squad. He said he believed the device was
planted by the IRA, which is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland.
   ``This terrorist action shows recklessness and total disregard
for human life,'' Churchill-Coleman said.
   On July 30, the IRA killed Conservative party lawmaker Ian Gow
at his home in Hankham, England with a bomb placed beneath his car.
   A spokesman at Scotland Yard's press office declined to say
whether Armstrong's name had been on a list of a hundred government
officials, judges and lawmakers _ including Gow _ found in an IRA
bomb factory in South London in 1988.
   Such explosives have also been used frequently by the
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic IRA in Northern Ireland in its
campaign to unite the Protestant-dominated province with the Irish
Republic under a leftist administration.

   The president today dismissed the
federal legislature and brought an abrupt end to Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto's 20-month-old government.
   The decision took Mrs. Bhutto's Cabinet by surprise, and her
supporters accused President Ghulam Ishaq Khan of a ``conspiracy
against all democratically elected people.''
   In dissolving the National Assembly, the law-making lower house
of Parliament, Ishaq Khan accused Ms. Bhutto's government of
corruption and political ineptitude.
   ``The government willfully undermined and impaired the work of
the Constitution,'' Ishaq Khan told a hastily called news
conference.
   ``Corruption has reached such proportions that the govvernment
cannot carry out the constitution,'' he said.
   Ishaq Khan set new elections for Oct. 24 and appointed
opposition leader Mustafa Jatoi as Pakistan's interim prime
minister.
   The president's decision caught members of Ms. Bhutto's Cabinet
by surprise and they promised to fight the dissolution in court.
   ``This is total high-handedness, unconstitutional and illegal,''
said Tariq Rahim, minister for parliamentary affairs. ``It is a
conspiracy against all democratically elected people. We will
challenge it in court.''

   A man trying to sell an automatic pistol at a gun
show accidentally fired the weapon into the crowd, injuring two
people, police said.
   A 27-year-old man was arrested for investigation of aggravated
assault with a deadly weapon after the shooting Sunday, police said.
   The man, whose name was not released pending charges, removed a
safety strap from a .32-caliber automatic Walther, slipped in a
round of ammunition and jiggled the gun, causing it to fire, police
said.
   The bullet passed through a table and struck a woman, who was
holding her 8-month-old daughter, and a man nearby. The woman
suffered a fragment wound in her leg and the man was hit with
fragments in the back of his neck and head, police said.
   Both victims were treated and released Sunday from Ben Taub
Hospital, police said. Their names were not released.
   The arrested man apparently wanted to demonstrate the gun for
prospective customers at the show at the George R. Brown Convention
Center, police said.
   Loaded guns were prohibited at the show and guns on display were
fitted with plastic straps, preventing the triggers and hammers
from moving.
   Gun show officials, working for the promotion company SAXET, did
not immediately return telephone calls from The Associated Press
today.
   Several hundred people attended the show where exhibitors sold
firearms including stun guns, blow guns and scopes.

``He then slipped her a note and, when she looked up, he was
standing there with this grenade.''
   The robber then ordered the teller to hurry up. He fled on foot
with an undisclosed amount of cash, police said.
   Witnesses told police he man had tape on each of his fingers.
Investigators believe it was an attempt by the robber to avoid
leaving fingerprints.
   Police could offer no explanation for why the bank robber
carried the basketball during the robbery on Friday.

<HEAD>Red Cross Hungry For Funds But Slow To Respond, Study Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Red Cross sometimes worries more about its
image than about emergency relief, sending agency camera crews in
ahead of aid workers, a newspaper concluded after analyzing 200
disasters over the past five years.
   A nine-month investigation by The Pittsburgh Press showed that,
in some cases, the Red Cross lived up to its promise to deliver
help quickly, fairly and compassionately.
   But in others, there were widespread deficiencies.
   The problems included delays of up to six days before enough
trained workers arrived at a disaster site, a lack of cooperation
with local agencies and an emphasis on getting favorable publicity
to help raise money.
   The paper, in a series that began in Sunday's newspaper, also
said the charity does not always spend all money donated for a
specific disaster on that disaster.
   The Red Cross is by far the nation's largest recipient of
disaster contributions, totaling $175 million last year. However,
the newspaper concluded that other groups, primarily the Salvation
Army and other national church groups, usually arrive at disaster
sites first and stay longer.
   Agency officials said it was unfair to criticize the Red Cross
because of highly publicized shortcomings following Hurricane Hugo
and the northern California earthquake last year.
   ``It's absurd to look at last fall's hurricane and earthquake
and say the Red Cross can't do the job. The Red Cross may have had
a few little problems, but we were dealing with two unprecedented
disasters,'' said Barbara Lohman, a national Red Cross spokeswoman
in Washington, D.C.
   ``If you want to be fair and get an accurate picture, look at
the hundreds of other disasters that we worked on, and you'll find
that the Red Cross performance was almost flawless,'' she told the
newspaper.
   The Red Cross' unique operating position was created in 1900
when Congress passed a law making it the only volunteer agency
required to aid victims of disaster. It was founded by Civil War
nurse Clara Barton in 1881.
   Today, funded almost totally by donations from the American
public, the $1.2 billion operation promises immediate response to a
disaster with food and shelter, medical care, clothing, temporary
housing and other basic needs.
   To raise money, the Red Cross stresses promoting its image even
in the early hours of a disaster, according to the newspaper report.
   Two of the four names posted on the nightly call-out roster at
national headquarters in Washington, D.C. _ those people to be
notified in case of a major disaster _ are fund-raisers.
   ``We had a film crew and a still photographer on the ground, on
the coast before (Hurricane) Hugo hit the mainland ... and with the
earthquake, we had a video crew in San Francisco within the first
24 hours,'' Ms. Lohman said.
   Most of the national disaster staff did not arrive until several
days later.
   ``When the fund-raising ability of a disaster diminishes, so
does the national Red Cross,'' said Carl Bradford, West Virginia's
director of emergency management. ``The national organization is
clearly driven by how much money it can raise, so when the
television crews and reporters leave, the Red Cross is in the next
cars out of town.''
   George Moody, chairman of American National Red Cross, conceded
that problems sometimes occur. But he said they're rare.
   ``When you have 2,200 active chapters involved in delivering
services, you're going to have inconsistency once in awhile,'' he
said.
   Allegations of diverting funds designated for a specific
disaster area surfaced after the northern California earthquake.
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos said the charity was leaving town
with $55 million contributed specifically to help victims of the
earthquake. The Red Cross announced a month later it would spend
$40 million more for earthquake relief.

<HEAD>Police Prevent Dissidents from Meeting North Koreans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of riot police blocked dozens
of dissidents from traveling to North Korea for a meeting, and the
government banned 42 other activists from leaving the country.
   The dissidents called off their efforts to cross the heavily
fortified border to North Korea after their bus was stopped by
almost 500 riot police on a road mid-way between Seoul and the
border.
   Two dissident leaders were arrested and about 40 others returned
to Seoul.
   The Justice Ministry, meanwhile, announced that 42 other South
Korean dissidents and radical students were banned from leaving the
country, presumably to stop them from traveling to North Korea
during a proposed mid-August border opening.
   ``Their exit is feared to severely hurt national interests,''
said a government spokesman.
   The dissidents had been trying to reach the border so 12
delegates could travel to North Korea's capital of Pyongyang for a
planning session for a proposed joint unification rally scheduled
for Aug. 15.
   Both governments have approved the rally in principle _ which is
scheduled to call for the unification of the two Koreas _ but
disagree on the details. It remains unclear whether the event will
be held and a planning committee has never met to work out the
details.
   The Seoul government has said the committee members will not be
allowed to travel to North Korea unless dissidents and the North
Koreans also accepted conservative groups as part of the delegation.
   The border between the two Koreas is the most heavily fortified
frontier in the world. Citizens cannot travel across the border
without approval from both governments, which is rarely given.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and
capitalist South in 1945 and the two sides fought a civil war in
the early 1950s.

<HEAD>Reports: Dinkins To Hire More Than 1,000 New Cops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor David Dinkins plans to hire more than
1,000 new police officers in an effort to fight a surge in crime,
two newspapers reported today.
   The New York Post and Daily News each said that the new police
officers will be trained at the Police Academy in the October and
April classes.
   Dinkins will obtain the $50 to $60 million the plan will cost by
cutting other city services, the papers said.
   ``What we're doing is flooding the streets with cops,'' a senior
mayoral aide who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Daily
News. ``But the ambition here is to reduce the level of violent
crime, not just put more cops on the street.''
   Police Commissioner Lee Brown recently said he would need 5,000
more police to cope with the city's crime crisis.
   The plan stemmed from a weekend anti-crime meeting of the city's
top law enforcement and prosecution officials at Gracie Mansion,
both papers said.
   Under Dinkins' new plan, money would also be freed to pay for
more prosecutors, jails, court officers and probation and
correction officers.
   Details of the budget cuts needed to pay for the new police
officers were to be announced at a City Hall news conference today,
the News said.
   Dinkins has been under pressure lately to respond to a wave of
high-profile random violence.
   Among those incidents: the slayings of four children by stray
bullets, and the killings of two cab drivers, a 14-year-old boy and
a Greenwich Village executive.
   On Sunday, a man was shot in the head as he spoke on a pay
telephone in front of a token booth at a Brooklyn subway station,
police said. John Myers, 26, was killed by a single shotgun blast
to the back of his head.
   No arrests were made. Myers' brother, who was with him at the
subway stop, ran to a nearby grocery store and called police.
   And in another incident, two men were shot, one fatally, when a
gunman stepped from a car in the Bronx and fired five or six shots,
police said.
   Louis Shevalir, 44, was shot in the chest and hip and was
pronounced dead on arrival at a Bronx hospital late Sunday night.
The other man was in stable condition early today.
   No arrests were made and no motive was known, police spokeswoman
Mary Wrensen said.

<TEXT>
   Jurors resumed their deliberations today in
Mayor Marion Barry's cocaine and perjury trial after a Sunday
respite from the work they started last week.
   The federal panel, kept sequestered during the six-week trial,
finally got the case late Thursday. The jurors deliberated all day
Friday and four hours Saturday.
   Shortly before being given the rest of the weekend off, the jury
asked District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson for another look at
more than 150 prosecution and defense exhibits.
   Barry, whose lawyer has acknowledged he was an ``occasional''
user of cocaine, faces a maximum of 26 years in prison if convicted
of all charges _ 10 cocaine possession charges, three felony
perjury counts and one conspiracy charge.
   While not attempting to persuade the jury that Barry never used
drugs, defense lawyer R. Kenneth Mundy has worked overtime at
casting doubt on whether he did so on the occasions the prosecution
says he did.
   The 5,000 pages of trial testimony include the statements of 10
witnesses who have said they saw Barry use drugs more than 200
times since 1984.
   Among those 10 are four who added an important additional
element: that Barry saw convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis using
narcotics.
   One of the perjury charges stems from a January 1989 grand jury
appearance in which Barry said he was unaware of Lewis' drug
involvement and did not believe his friend was a drug dealer.
   But four of Lewis' female companions testified that Barry was
present when Lewis used drugs during a trip the mayor made to the
Virgin Islands in 1986.
   ``Mr. Lewis lit a marijuana cigarette in the front of the boat
and he passed it to the young lady and the young lady passed it to
the mayor,'' one witness, Jonetta Vincent, recalled about a June
1986 boat trip she took with Lewis, Barry and others. ``The mayor
passed it back to Mr. Lewis and then ... there was another one.''
   In addition, the captain on that cruise testified that he, the
mayor, Lewis and others shared a marijuana cigarette.
   ``Was there anything obstructing Mr. Barry's view'' when Lewis
lit and smoked from the joint, Terry Lee Brenay was asked.
   ``Nothing whatsoever,'' he responded.
   Mundy also has complained that witnesses have provided only
vague dates _ and hazier recollections _ of their drug use with the
mayor. He also tried to expose flaws in the memory of witnesses not
openly hostile to the mayor.
   Most of Mundy's effort went to undermining the government's two
star witnesses: Lewis and former model Rasheeda Moore.
   Lewis ``was willing to sing any tune ... the government wanted
to hear as long as his own fat was in the fire,'' Mundy said.
Barry's chief attorney also elicited testimony from other witnesses
that pointed out minor inconsistencies in Lewis' description of his
drug use with Barry in the Virgin Islands.
   Lewis' testimony was used to back up all three felony perjury
charges and four of the misdemeanor cocaine possession charges.
   Moore, who participated in the Jan. 18 FBI sting operation that
produced Barry's arrest, was portrayed by Mundy as the most
hypocritical weapon in the government's arsenal.
   Although she testified that she used drugs with Barry ``over 100
times'' during the couple's two-year sexual relationship, Mundy
hammered away at the fact that she could provide few specific dates.
   He portrayed her as an opportunistic traitor who, down on her
luck, was ripe for recruitment when the FBI approached her about
participating in the sting operation.

   Tropical storm Diana churned through the
Yucatan Peninsula and headed back to sea today after drenching
Mexico's Caribbean coast but causing little damage.
   At 9 a.m. EDT, Diana was centered about 100 miles west of
Merida, Mexico. It carried maximum winds of 45 mph and was moving
northwest at 15 mph, according to the U.S. National Weather Service
in Miami.
   The service said the storm moved across the Yucatan Peninsula
and toward the Gulf of Mexico.
   The weather service today discontinued tropical storm warnings
in the Yucatan.
   The state government of Quintana Roo, where the storm struck,
said preliminary reports indicated there had been no major flooding
or damage.
   Minor street flooding occurred in the state capital, Chetumal,
the newspaper Novedades de Quintana Roo reported.
   The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm hit
the coast by midafternoon about 70 miles northeast of Chetumal and
well south of the popular resort of Cancun.
   High winds, with velocities ranging from 37 mph to 45 mph, hit
the towns of Felipe Carrillo Puerto and Jose Maria Morelos, state
government spokesman Javier Venegas said, but no damage was
reported.

   Oil industry sources said today that
Saudi Arabia was reinforcing its troops near the Kuwaiti border,
and witnesses reported intense air activity near the airport in the
Saudi capital.
   Local residents reached by telephone said Saudi military
aircraft were sighted during the night landing and taking off at
airfields on the fringes of the capital.
   U.S. Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney arrived in Jiddah today
for talks with Saudi officials. Cheney was accompanied by Lt. Gen.
H. Norman Schwarzkopf, head of the U.S. Middle East force known as
the Central Command. Richard Gates, deputy national security
adviser, and Paul Wolfowitz, deputy defense secretary, were also
with him.
   Oil executives at Khafji, reached by telephone from Bahrain,
said ``more Saudi troops but no heavy vehicles'' were entering the
region. Khafji is a city in northeastern Saudi Arabia on the
Persian Gulf, near the Kuwaiti border. Its port has oil loading and
berthing facilities for small tankers and freighters.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's troops invaded Kuwait on
Thursday and advanced toward the Saudi border, raising fears they
also planned to invade the oil giant. The invasion force set up a
checkpoint about a half-mile from the Saudi border checkpoint at
Khafji.
   Security officials at the Khafji post said the Iraqis made
minor, apparently accidental incursions into Saudi territory Friday
and Saturday, then retreated with apologies.
   The oil executives said the Saudi force deployments were merely
a precaution to defend oil fields run by the Arabian Oil Co., a
consortium of Saudi, Kuwait and Japanese companies.
   ``It's calm down here,'' said one Japanese oil executive, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``There is no shooting anywhere,
neither in Khafji city nor at the port area. But the Saudis are
reinforcing their defenses. It is a slight increase in the number
of soldiers here.''
   However, travelers from the area said Saudi tanks were sighted
moving northward Saturday, possibly to areas near Khafji.
   Gulf-based diplomatic sources said Saudi forces went on alert
with the start of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Thursday. They
were trying to determine the extent of mobilization in the Saudi
armed forces.
   The Saudi borders were closed. The situation inside the kingdom
was described by diplomats and residents reached by telephone as
``tense but calm.''
   An indication of the military preparedness was the continuous
whirring of AWACs over Dhahran, the oil capital and the area with
the highest concentration of American interests in Saudi Arabia.
AWACS are Airborne Warning and Control aircraft.
   In Riyadh, the Saudi capital, long lines of people were at the
banks. Long lines also formed elsewhere in the region. Some
American companies were reported to have begun pulling out their
staff from the United Arab Emirates.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Riyadh insisted however that for the
estimated 26,000-28,000 Americans and their dependents, ``life was
going about as usual.'' Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil
exporter, and most of the Americans work in the oil industry.
   The spokesman estimated the number of Americans in Saudi Arabia
may be presently ``substantially fewer'' because of the summer
holidays.
   The borders of Kuwait with Saudi Arabia run halfway through the
so-called Divided Zone, a new name for what used to be called the
Neutral Zone.
   Under a 1988 agreement, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait agreed to divide
the Neutral Zone, drawing their border through it. Khafji is in the
zone.

<HEAD>Report Calls on Bush to Spend More on Infant Mortality</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A quarter of the 40,000 infant deaths that occur
in the United States each year could be easily prevented with
existing medical knowledge, according to a high-level Bush
administration study.
   The New York Times reported today that the study calls for
spending about $500 million a year more to reduce the country's
infant mortality rate. Ninteen other countries have lower rates.
   The report was begun in July 1989 by a group headed by Assistant
Secretary of Health and Human Services James O. Mason, but appears
to have been put on hold, the Times said.
   The report found that common techniques, including improved
prenatal care, could also prevent vision and hearing loss, mental
retardation and other handicaps that afflict 100,000 newborns each
year.
   ``The United States has not achieved its national goals for
reducing infant mortality,'' the study said. ``Unacceptable racial
disparities and significant geographic inequities are still
evident, and progress in reducing the rate of infant mortality has
slowed significantly, especially among blacks.''
   The Times said it obtained a copy of the report from an official
involved in the study who felt its recommendations were being
ignored. Others involved in the study said it had been shelved
because it was an inconvenient reminder of Bush campaign promises
that would be difficult to keep, the Times said.
   A White House spokesman, Alixe Glen, told the Times that work on
the report was continuing and should be completed by early next
month.
   In 1987, the last year for which data is available, the overall
infant mortality rate for the United States was 10.1 deaths in the
first year of life for every 1,000 births. The rate was 17.9 for
blacks and 8.6 for whites.
   In the 1970s, the Public Health Service set a goal of reducing
the rate to nine by 1990, and said no racial group should have a
rate exceeding 12.

   Iraq told Turkey that embargos against
Iraqi oil today forced it to close one of two pipelines used to
pump Iraqi crude oil through Turkey, the Anatolia news agency
reported.
   Anatolia said Iraq also notified Turkey that it would use only
70 percent of the capacity of the second pipeline.
   The United States, Japan and the European Community announced in
the past week that they no longer will import Iraqi oil to protest
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Those countries bought more than half of
the oil exported from Iraq.
   With the widespread boycott, Iraq would have trouble selling all
the oil flowing through Turkey, said a Turkish government official
quoted by Anatolia.
   Turkey was reportedly under U.S. pressure to close the pipelines
following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Thursday. The Turkish
official said the Iraqi decision was a ``great relief'' to Turkey.
   Government officials said the action would not affect Turkish
purchases of Iraqi oil. Turkey is expected to rely on Iraq for
about 40 percent of its oil needs this year.
   The pipelines take Iraqi crude oil from the Kirkuk fields to a
terminal on Turkey's Mediterranean coast, where it is loaded for
export to other countries. The pipelines have a capacity of 1.6
million barrels of oil a day, more than half Iraq's estimated daily
output of 2.7 million barrels.
   They had been pumping about 1.5 million barrels daily, according
to the Middle East Economic Survey.
   The Turkish official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
Iraq's State Organization of Marketing Oil told Turkey's
state-owned Botac company, which operates the pipeline, of the
closure. It said the move took effect this afternoon. No further
details were given.
   There was no immediate word from Iraq.
   Turkey earns $250 million from Iraq annually for operating the
pipeline.

<HEAD>Forest Service Vows to Remove Protesters from Forest Logging Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ETHERTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials promised to evict
environmentalists who blocked logging roads and ignored orders to
leave a southern Illinois national forest slated for a timber
harvest.
   ``We may hand out tickets, or we may bring a paddy wagon up
there and haul them away,'' Norbert Boe, acting forest supervisor
of the Shawnee National Forest, said Sunday.
   Forest officials posted an eviction notice Friday, ordering the
environmentalists out by Saturday morning. But no one had attempted
to evict the protesters by early today, Jackson County sheriff's
deputies said.
   Environmentalists emulating West Coast demonstrators moved into
the forest June 20, anticipating that a judge would allow a timber
company to cut trees within a 144-acre area of the forest. On June
26, U.S. District Judge James Foreman ruled the timber harvest
could proceed.
   Since then, environmentalists have maintained a round-the-clock
vigil, physically blocking access to the area scheduled for
logging. Loggers have already removed too many trees, threatening
the forest's fragile ecosystem, protesters said.
   The East Perry Lumber Co. of Missouri paid about $50,000 for the
right to harvest in the Shawnee National Forest. Nearly 26 acres
would be cleared in two-acre patches.
   Larger trees in the rest of the harvest area, including oak
trees more than 100 years old, also would be cut down, Forest
Service spokesman Tom Hagerty said.
   Sympathizers brought food and supplies to protesters Sunday.
   Lester Kujawa, who delivered a box of food, said his
great-grandfather moved into the area in the 1800s. The forest
should be preserved as it is for his children, Kujawa said.
   ``I'm here to show support for these people as long as they
need,'' Kujawa said.

   U.S. Marines who rushed to the defense of
Americans caught in the midst of Liberia's bloody civil war have
evacuated 74 people from the capital, the Pentagon said today.
   More than 200 Marines are dug in at the Embassy to defend the
``skeleton size'' diplomatic staff remaining there and to ferry
those people who want to escape the West African nation's civil
strife, officials said.
   Of the 62 U.S. citizens evacuated in the helicopter rescue
mission that began Sunday, 35 have been flown to neighboring Sierra
Leone and ``on to London where travel arrangements are being made''
for them to return to the United States, the Pentagon said in a
statement today.
   Most of the Americans are U.S. government employees.
   Twelve citizens from other nations also have been helped to
leave Monrovia, the capital. The statement identified them as eight
Liberians who are dependents or escorts for Americans, two
Italians, one Canadian and one French Catholic priest.
   ``Marine Corps helicopters will continue to ferry back and forth
from the U.S. Embassy to the USS Saipan'' if further evacuations
are necessary, the statement said.
   ``The Marines are there to protect lives. They are authorized to
use whatever means are necessary and they are there in a battle
situation,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Sunday.
   In a precision helicopter rescue mission, about 225 Marines
plucked the Americans from the embassy grounds and airlifted them
to safety aboard U.S. warships off the coast, the Pentagon said.
   ``No hostile action was taken against the operation, which was
conducted smoothly and without incident,'' the Pentagon said.
   President Bush ordered the Marines to go ashore after one of the
rebel leaders trying to oust President Samuel Doe ordered the
arrest of all foreigners in an attempt to provoke outside
intervention in the civil war, Fitzwater said.
   The United States has steadfastly refused to intervene in the
increasingly violent dispute.
   The maneuver, code-named ``Sharp Edge,'' was launched from four
warships that have been stationed in international waters off
Liberia since early June. The goal was to secure the seaside U.S.
Embassy compound and to retrieve 21 Americans posted at two
transmitter sites just outside the capital.
   The embassy was trying to get word out to any other U.S.
citizens remaining in Liberia, a U.S. official said. ``But they'll
have to reach the embassy compound for the Marines to pick them up,
and that may be hard for most of them because of the fighting,'' he
added.
   Ambassador Peter de Vos was remaining behind in charge of a
``skeleton size'' staff, Fitzwater said.
   About 70 U.S. officials and 300 other Americans were in Liberia
when the operation started, Fitzwater said.
   ``We'll take out as many as want to get out,'' he said. The
Pentagon said the Marines would airlift other foreigners if they
asked.
   Fitzwater stressed that the Marine presence ``does not indicate
or constitute any intention on the part of the U.S. government to
intervene militarily in the Liberian conflict.''
   ``The purpose of this operation is to safeguard lives, to draw
down the number of Americans at the embassy to minimum staff and to
provide additional security for those who remain,'' Fitzwater said.
   Pentagon sources said about 237 Marines _ traditionally the
protectors of diplomatic sites _ would defend the compound ``as
long as necessary.''
   Fitzwater said Doe was told of the operation in advance. The
United States has a standing offer to evacuate Doe, who has holed
up in the presidential mansion. Fitzwater said attempts were made
to contact rebel leaders as well, but he could not confirm that
contact had been made.
   U.S. officials notified Americans on Saturday that the
evacuation could take place, and military officials expected that
many of the 300 Americans would decline to leave.
   Many of those 300 U.S. citizens also hold Liberian citizenship.
They have been living in Liberia for years and have extensive
families that they don't want to leave behind.
   Most of the other Americans are missionaries posted in various
parts of the country. All American employees of the Voice of
America station near Monrovia were evacuated in May.

   Kuwait's oil export facilities are shut
down and will remain so for some time, and there is considerable
doubt Saudi Arabia will be willing to make up the potential world
oil shortage, the Middle East Economic Survey said today.
   The weekly newsletter, published in Nicosia, said the total loss
of supply to world oil markets because of the Kuwaiti shutdown and
embargoes on Iraqi oil could exceed 4 million barrels a day.
   ``There will be a potential restriction of oil supply in the
near future that could range in intensity from significant to
highly severe depending on how circumstances unfold,'' it wrote.
   The respected newletter said Kuwaiti oil production and exports
_ cut after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's powerful army invaded
on Thursday _ would be shut down for some time ``both for
physical-technical reasons and as a consequence of impending
international efforts to interdict purchases of Kuwaiti oil.''
   The newsletter said the impact of the Kuwaiti shutdown could be
compounded by restrictions on Iraqi oil supplies.
   Since Friday, when the article was written, numerous sanctions
have been announced, including Japanese and European embargoes on
Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. The United States announced an on Thursday
just hours after Iraq invaded its oil-rich neighbor.
   As a result of the embargos, Iraq today closed one of two major
pipelines that was pumping its oil through Turkey to a terminal on
the Mediterranean. It said the second pipeline would be used at
just 70 percent capacity.
   The pipelines were carrying about 1.5 million barrels of oil a
day, more than half Iraq's daily output.
   ``If anything like the full Iraqi-Kuwaiti shortfall of 4 million
barrels a day manifests itself, the world will not be able to get
by for very long without some additional supply from other sources,
above and beyond the current OPEC quota levels,'' the newsletter
said.
   It said current spare capacity by members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries amounted to not much more than 3.5
million barrels of oil a day.
   This spare capacity is concentrated in a few countries: Saudi
Arabia with a spare 2 million barrels a day, the United Arab
Emirates with 600,000, Venezuela with 500,000 and Libya with
300,000, the newsletter said.
   ``Here the key obviously lies with Saudi Arabia; and there must
be considerable doubt as to how far the Kingdom would be prepared
to go on antagonizing Iraq by cooperating with measures to restrict
Iraqi oil exports and increase its own production in deference to
the wishes of the United States and the world community,'' it said.
   Iraq and Kuwait have accounted for 20 percent of OPEC's output.
   The newsletter noted that Iraq's pre-invasion oil exports
amounted to 2.7 to 2.8 million barrels a day, divided between three
outlets: pipelines across Saudi Arabia and Turkey, and the Gulf sea
lanes.
   It said 1.5 million barrels a day were exported using the
pipeline through Turkey to the Mediterranean, 900,000 via the Saudi
Arabian pipeline to the Red Sea and 300,000 to 400,000 loaded onto
tankers at Iraq's Mina al-Bakr terminal in the northern Persian
Gulf.
   ``The pipelines across Turkey and Saudi Arabia would clearly be
prime targets for international oil sanctions against Iraq,'' the
Middle East Economic Survey wrote.
   ``But it should be remembered on the one hand that Turkey gets a
substantial part of its own oil supply through the Iraqi pipeline,
and on the other that any action by Saudi Arabia to interfere with
the terminals by means of U.S. naval power could also be a tricky
exercise,'' the newsletter wrote.
   ``The upshot of all this is that although effective global oil
sanctions would undoubtedly cripple Iraq, they would be difficult
to implement and administer in practice,'' it said.
   Turkish officials, however, said the decision to close the
pipeline through their country would not affect Turkish purchases
of Iraqi oil, expected to account for about 40 percent of Turkey's
oil needs this year.
   The newsletter noted the agreement last month by OPEC ministers
_ under pressure from Saddam _ to restrict production in order to
push up oil prices.
   ``Now the normal pattern of oil supply and trade have been
radically distorted, and crisis buying has already lifted prices to
somewhere around the $21-a-barrel OPEC basket range,'' it wrote.
   It said unless ``conditions return to normal pretty soon, the
damage to the agreement _ and perhaps OPEC itself _ may prove
beyond repair.''
   The Middle East Economic Survey said this brought to mind the
two previous occasions in the past 20 years when the oil market was
convulsed by political upheavals: in 1973-74 when the Arabs imposed
an oil embargo during the Arab-Israeli war, and the 1979-81 price
explosion.
   Those ``oil shocks,'' especially the second one, drove the world
into economic recession.

<HEAD>FDA Approves Lung Drug for Premature Babies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration today
approved a drug that could help save thousands of premature infants
born with immature lungs.
   The drug, a powder mixed with sterile water, substitutes for a
naturally occurring foam that coats the inside of the lungs and
keeps them from collapsing when the infant exhales.
   The infants receive the drug through a tube into their
windpipes. They must be on a mechanical ventilator to receive it.
   About 250,000 infants are born prematurely each year in the
United States. One-fifth of them have respiratory distress
syndrome, or breathing difficulties, due to immature lungs. The
problem is fatal in some 5,000 cases a year.
   That makes respiratory distress syndrome the leading cause of
death and disability among premature infants, the FDA said. In
1963, a baby born to President Kennedy and his wife died of the
condition.
   The newly approved drug, called Exosurf Neonatal, can be used
immediately after birth to prevent death in high-risk infants under
three pounds and also to treat infants who have developed the
disease.
   The FDA said the drug represents such an important advance that
it has been widely available since July 1989, when it was still
experimental.
   The drug was invented by Dr. John Clements of the University of
California at San Francisco. Burroughs Wellcome Co. of Research
Triangle Park, N.C. applied to market it in February. The FDA said
its approval came in ``a near-record five months.''
   The FDA also said it has designated Exosurf an orphan drug under
a program that provides incentives for the development and
production of drugs and medical products to treat conditions
affecting small numbers of people.

   Here are some facts and figures on Kuwait:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LAND _ Kuwait, a land of 6,880 square miles, is bordered by Iraq
to the north and west, Saudi Arabia to the south-southwest, and the
Persian Gulf to the east. The oil-rich country is flat and very
dry. The nation gets an average of 5 inches of rain a year.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PEOPLE _ About one-quarter of Kuwait's 1.7 million residents
live in the capital of Kuwait City and its suburbs. More than half
are foreigners, mainly Arabs, including 300,000 Palestinians. Most
Kuwaitis are Sunni Moslem, but 30 percent adhere to the rival
Shiite sect. Shiites of Iranian descent number nearly 150,000. The
al-Sabah clan has ruled Kuwait as an emirate since they settled
there in 1756 after trekking from the Arabian hinterland. More than
70 percent of the people speak Arabic, the official language, while
10 percent speak Kurdish and 4 percent Persian. A constitutional
monarchy rules the country.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ECONOMY _ Oil is the chief resource of Kuwait, a member of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Only 1 percent of
the land is cultivated. Per capita income in 1986 was $13,890. Oil
revenue reached $30 billion in 1983, but has been declining since
because of a drop in oil prices and production curbs. Kuwait
currently produces about 1.5 million barrels of oil a day and has
reserves of 89.7 billion barrels, 12.8 percent of world reserves
and enough to last for more than 250 years. Little grows in the
desert climate, so the emirate has to import nearly all its food.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ The Mongols, Arab caliphs and Ottomans were in turn
overlords of the bleak and largely unpopulated land until 1899,
when the British became the dominant power in the region. Kuwait
gained its independence in 1961. It is a member of the six-nation
Gulf Cooperation Council, a defense and economic alliance. Iraq,
which has historically laid claim to all of Kuwait, invaded
Thursday and announced the formation of a provisional government.
The al-Sabah family fled to Saudi Arabia.

   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
today left Aspen for a meeting in Washington with President Bush
after a five-day visit shortened by the Kuwait invasion and a
terrorist bombing at home.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who arrived Aug. 1, shortened her scheduled
10-day visit to this mountain resort so she could attend the
funeral Wednesday of Ian Gow, a conservative member of Parliament
slain by an Irish Republican Army bomb on June 30.
   The trip was trimmed further to make time to meet Bush. She was
scheduled to return home on Tuesday.
   Mrs. Thatcher spoke Sunday to more than 3,000 people at the 40th
anniversay of the Aspen Institute, a group dedicated to humanistic
values worldwide.
   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's bold takeover of tiny neighbor
Kuwait dominated concerns during her visit. Bush met with her
Thursday to discuss the invasion before he delivered the
anniversary celebration's opening speech.
   The United Nations must work to end the Mideast occupation, she
said.
   ``Iraq's invasion of Kuwait defies every principle for which the
U.N. stands. If we let it succeed, no small country can ever feel
safe again. The law of the jungle takes over,'' she said.
   She also proposed human rights guarantees for all of Europe
similar to those established in Britain's Magna Carta, which
protects freedom of speech, religion, law and commerce, and the
right to hold democratic elections, own property and maintain
nationhood.
   Mrs. Thatcher said all Europeans deserve to remain free from
``fear of an over-mighty state.''
   She also suggested that the European Community should be
prepared to accept all Eastern European nations for full membership.
   ``We don't see this new Soviet Union as an enemy, but as a
country groping its way towards freedom,'' she said. ``We no longer
have to view the world through the prism of East-West relations.
The Cold War is over.''
   During her stay, Mrs. Thatcher visited the ``Star Wars''
Strategic Defense Initiative center and the North American
Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado Springs and the National
Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder.
   Mrs. Thatcher received the institute's Statesman Award for
contributions to democracy and peace.
   The award has been given twice before in the institute's 40-year
history _ to Jean Monnet, founder of the European economic
integration, and former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt.
   Founded in 1950, the nonprofit institute gathers leaders in all
parts of society to discuss critical issues in the world. The
symposium this weekend concentrated on topics ranging from health
care to education.

<HEAD>Bill to Create Cabinet-Level Department of Environment Stalls in
Congress</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Legislation to create a Department of the
Environment to give new focus to environmental issues brought
nothing but cheers six months ago, but now the proposal is mired in
turf wars and its future is in doubt.
   The administration cooled toward the idea after the House passed
a bill it didn't like. Legislation has languished for months in the
Senate with no indication when it might be scheduled for a floor
vote.
   ``I think at the moment it's sort of stalled,'' said Sen.
William Roth, R-Del., one of the key sponsors of the bill
introduced in January to elevate the Environmental Protection
Agency to Cabinet level.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee who has pushed the EPA Cabinet issue, said he
hasn't given up hope.
   Glenn said in an interview that some progress is being made to
get differences resolved. But he added ``I'm not predicting a
date'' for getting the bill to the Senate floor, much less working
out differences from the House bill.
   A number of complex issues, from the budget deficit to child
care and clean air, face Congress when it returns next month from
its August recess with only a few weeks remaining before the
October campaign season.
   Despite all the talk of smooth sailing earlier this year, the
EPA cabinet bill could easily become a casualty to the calendar,
some environmentalists fear.
   With considerable fanfare in January, President Bush announced
his support for the legislation, which would create the
government's 15th Cabinet-level agency.
   The environmental challenges ``are so important that they must
be addressed at the highest level,'' he declared at a White House
news conference.
   Nothing has been heard publicly from Bush on the issue since.
The president made no secret that he had wanted the legislation to
sign on Earth Day on April 22. There was no bill and he went
fishing in Florida instead.
   Meanwhile, what had been seen as a simple piece of legislation
with widespread bipartisan support began taking on political
baggage.
   In March, only four days before Earth Day, the House voted
371-55 to create a Department of the Environment, but added
requirements seen by the White House as an attempt to
``micro-manage'' the executive branch.
   The president made known he likely would veto a bill that
contains the House restrictions. The administration especially
doesn't like provisions to create an independent Bureau of
Statistics _ and bar its director from being replaced short of
malfeasance _ and limit the number of political appointees in the
new department.
   In the Senate a succession of turf battles, involving Senate
committees and parts of the executive branch, have kept the
legislation in limbo since it cleared Glenn's Government Affairs
Committee months ago.
   Committees with jurisdiction over the Commerce and Energy
departments, as well as the Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee, have voiced objections to parts of the bill they fear
might affect them.
   The Senate disputes have not centered on the heart of the
legislation, but on the fringes: How will it affect the president's
Council on Environmental Quality? Who will chair an interagency
group on environmental issues within the White House? Will the new
department usurp powers now in the Commerce or Energy departments?
   Some leading environmental groups, including the National
Wildlife Federation, Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense
Council, urged Senate leaders in a letter to end the stalemate and
move the bill.
   ``The environmental community is pushing for it. The issues in
the 1990s are going to be more global in nature and to give the EPA
equal footing with other (environmental) ministers is vitally
necessary,'' said Bill Klinefelder, legislative director for the
Wildlife Federation.
   But not all environmentalists are as enthusiastic.
   Environmental Action, a Washington-based environmental group,
has not kept close tabs on the bill. Its president, Ruth Caplan,
said creating a Department of the Environment would be nice, but
perhaps not so significant.
   ``It could give the impression of doing something for the
environment without having to spend any real political chips,'' Ms.
Caplan said.

   Machete-wielding cultists
attacked an army outpost after rubbing oil over their bodies to
repel bullets, but soldiers killed two and wounded four other
attackers, the military said Monday.
   The clash occurred Sunday in a village outside Valencia town,
about 50 miles south of here on Mindanao island, said Lt. Col.
Bartolome Bagares, civil-military operations chief of the 4th
Infantry Battalion.
   Thirteen new recruits of the ``Bolo (Machete) Battalion,'' were
sent by their leader to free a detained comrade and to prove that a
``wonder oil'' would make them invincible, Bagares said.
   The cultists raised their machetes in the air, chanted Latin
prayers and charged the soldiers, Bagares said. But the oil proved
ineffective. Two were shot dead and four others were wounded when
troops opened fire, he said.
   Three other attackers were captured and the rest fled when they
saw their comrades fall, Bagares said. There were no casualties
among the soldiers.

   Salvage crews today cleaned the tanks
of a crippled oil barge so it could be cut up and the Houston Ship
Channel reopened to unrestricted traffic for the first time in more
than a week.
   The barge's tanks must be cleaned of oil so that a spark from a
welding torch won't cause an explosion, officials said. They did
not know how long it would take to clean and cut up the barge,
crippled in a collision that left 700,000 gallons of heavy oil in
busy Galveston Bay.
   After an early morning flyover, Coast Guard officials reported
that little oil remained along the shoreline at Houston Point, on
the north end of the bay.
   Only a few patches of heavy oil were spotted along the
shoreline, but a rainbow sheen stretched about two miles into the
bay, said Chief Warrant Officer Rick Meidt.
   ``I think that's good because the heavy stuff is right at the
shoreline where it can be collected by the vacuum trucks. The sheen
is more susceptible to natural breakdown,'' Meidt said.
   Crews also sprayed oil-eating bacteria on marshes Sunday and
vacuumed up heavy sludge from the spill, caused when a Greek tanker
collided with two oil barges July 28. The tanker lost none of its
cargo. Both barges were damaged.
   Vessels became bottled up in the channel while the Coast Guard
worked to free the barge that sank in the accident.
   Ships were allowed to leave the harbor Sunday night, with help
from tugs, for the first time since the accident. Inbound towboat
traffic resumed Friday.
   As of late Sunday, about 40 vessels were waiting to get in, and
fewer than 10 were waiting to leave, the Coast Guard said.
   ``Traffic is moving, just not freely,'' said Scott Inbody, chief
warrant officer of the Coast Guard's vessel traffic service in
Houston. ``We're making sure no vessels meet or overtake each other
in the waters near the accident.''
   The delays were estimated to cost $10,000 to $20,000 per day for
each vessel.
   Coast Guardsmen and salvage crews using skimmers, hundreds of
yards of booms and 18 vacuum trucks worked into the night to
contain and suck up the estimated 100,000 gallons of brown sludge
believed remaining in Galveston Bay.
   Cleanup crews collected about 315,000 gallons of the medium to
heavy crude, and little remained visible in Galveston Bay, said
Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Greene. He said he expected the cleanup to
cost about $5 million.
   The sunken barge is believed to have lost most of its 716,000
gallons of oil; the second barge lost nearly 50,000 gallons,
officials said.
   A ban on shrimping imposed in Galveston Bay on Thursday remained
in effect. The ban on fin fishing was lifted Saturday.
   Cleanup crews sprayed some 150 pounds of oil-eating bacteria on
marshlands that cannot be safely reached with skimming vessels.
   In the process begun last week, the naturally occurring microbes
reduce the oil to a fatty substance that sinks and is eaten by fish.
   ``This is different from oil on rocks or oil in open waters,''
said Texas Water Commission chairman B.J. ``Buck'' Wynne. ``This is
on a living, organic system and it's absolutely the most sensitive
place it can be.''
   Greene said strong winds had pushed some oil from marshlands
back out into the bay. Some of the oil washed ashore, while
streamers up to 100 yards long moved toward Trinity Bay, a
sensitive marine area.
   But Larry McKinney, director of the resource protection division
of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, said such a drift could
be beneficial because the oil would be in open waters where
skimmers and booms could more easily contain and suck up the sludge.
   McKinney said crews had found dead crabs, mussels, small fish
and other small animals along the shore. He said crews searched the
marshlands for oil-soiled wildlife but had been unable to catch any
of the animals.
   ``Really, we've been lucky,'' McKinney said. ``The oil's not up
here like we thought it would be in the marshes.''
   An inquiry board of officials from the Coast Guard and the
National Transportation Safety Board concluded five days of
hearings on the cause of the accident Sunday. An official report is
not expected for several weeks.

   Seton House, a place where AIDS victims may find a
home and be treated with dignity, has been completed and dedicated
by Missionaries of Charity, the order of Mother Teresa.
   ``All of us are witnesses today to what most of us hope to see
once in a lifetime _ a miracle,'' Archbishop J. Francis Stafford
told a crowd that filled the small chapel Sunday.
   Seton House, a former church building that had been closed for
eight years, was reopened by five sisters sent to Denver by the
order. It will provide a home for up to 20 men and women with AIDS
when it begins accepting residents in a few weeks.
   Gov. Roy Romer, who attended the dedication, said to the nuns:
``I am absolutely in awe of the service you have given. Yos, a
tomato reddening on the vine embodies the spirit of summer.
   Moreover, it's easy to grow. You don't even need a garden, just
a pot and a sunny place.
   Amid such poplularity, breeders have developed hundreds of
varieties and more keep coming every year. The oldies are still
around, too, and available from seedhouses specializing in heirloom
varieties.
   Living in the country, with plenty of space for experiment, I
grow the new and the old, the large and the small, the red and the
gold. This year I've grown the smallest tomato in creation, the
currant _ no larger then a marble _ and found the taste intense,
but attractive. The skin was tough, however.
   Taste, of course, is highly personal _ and fickle, too _ but the
small ones are getting high marks for flavor nowadays and many of
us would say they're the best for salads.
   My own favorite smallie is an old cultivar named ``Yellow
Pear,'' producing a tantilizing blend of tart and sweet. Some
people, however, think ``Yellow Pear'' too bland, and prefer
something sweeter, like one called ``Sweet Million.''
   Gardeners, naturally, like earliness in tomatoes and watch the
catalogs for cultivars with that feature.
   The best one to come along for my climate _ chilly spring nights
50 miles north of New York City _ is another smallie called
``Subarctic Plenty,'' which sets fruit in the 40s and even high 30s
Fahrenheit. This gives me salad tomatoes in mid-July, three and
four weeks ahead of my other tomatoes.
   By the middle of August, however, ``Subarctic'' has done its
thing and I'm eating other tomatoes with later and longer maturing
times. A new one called ``Ida Gold,'' small and yellow, has
excellent flavor, but the harvest is short. ``Yellow Pear,'' on the
other hand, keeps bearing until fall and I've seen it survive a few
degrees of frost.
   A new gardener interested in long-bearing tomatoes should look
for varieties labeled ``intermediate.'' Those called
``determinate'' are usually bush types with all-at-once yields.
   Some bush types, like ``Red Robin,'' grow no taller than a foot
or so and have little spread, ideal for the small garden or for
patio or container growing.
   While using smallies for salads, I still grow medium-sized fruit
for cooking such dishes as stuffed tomatoes.
   Among the best-tasting medium tomatoes marketed in recent years
is a red one called ``Carmello,'' which I've seen described as both
California and French. I also raise beefsteak tomatoes for slicing
on sandwiches.
   This may sound like a lot of tomatoes, but all told I limit
myself to about a dozen plants, which is plenty for me and my wife.
Actually, much of my harvest goes into making spaghetti sauce for
the freezer.
   When I first started gardening some 40 years ago, staking and
pruning tomato plants made for a lot of work. But as I got older
and lazier, and maybe wiser, I stopped this. Now I just lay down a
bed of hay around my plants and let them sprawl.
   The hay gives pretty good protection to the fruit. Sure, I get a
blemish and a hole here and there, but I'm not growing for show and
the taste is just as good.
   A historical curiosity about the tomato is that despite its
American Indian origins it was practically unknown as a vegetable
to whites in North America until long after the Europeans, with
some misgivings, ate it.
   The poison fear persisted, probably because the tomato belongs
to the nightshade family. But with today's popularity of small
toamtoes, we are returning to the plant's ancient origins. The wild
cherry tomato from the Andes is indeed believed to be the
granddaddy of them all.

   Hiroshima on Monday mourned the 140,000
victims of the 1945 atomic bomb attack with a solemn look back and
a note of optimism for the future as tensions ease between the
Soviet Union and the United States.
   For an eery moment, the city fell silent. Taxis and street cars
stopped, and people throughout this industrial center of 1 million
joined in a moment of prayer for the souls of those killed in the
bombing.
   Dignitaries, Hiroshima residents and foreign guests bowed their
heads at 8:15 a.m., the exact moment the bomb exploded in a
blinding flash of light.
   ``I pay my deep respects to the citizens of Hiroshima who have
built this city of international peace from the ashes,'' Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu said at a ceremony attended by 55,000 people.
   ``As the only country in the world to have experienced an atom
bomb attack, Japan has resolved not to let it be repeated,'' Kaifu
said. He reiterated Japan's appeals for total nuclear disarmament.
   Kaifu told a news conference that his government was working to
increase medical and financial support for those exposed to the
bomb's radiation.
   Hiroshima Mayor Takeshi Araki, in his annual peace declaration,
praised the growing promises for disarmament in the United States
and the Soviet Union.
   ``Hiroshima has the highest regard for this tide of disarmament,
changing the fate of mankind from one of annihilation to one of
survival,'' Araki said.
   The United States, in an effort to avoid a bloody invasion of
Japan to end World War II, dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima on
Aug. 6, 1945. It wiped out nearly half the city's population,
killing most immediately. Many others died within a few months,
mostly from radiation or burns.
   Hiroshima, a major military center during the war, has been
honoring the dead at a solemn peace ceremony annually for 43 years.
   But not all Hiroshima residents can face the memories. Retired
school teacher Minako Tanabe said her husband has never attended
the ceremony although he has lived in Hiroshima all his life.
   ``My husband won't come here because it's too sad. So many of
his friends died that day,'' Ms. Tanabe said.
   Monday, thousands of visitors streamed through the city's Peace
Memorial Park, leaving flowers, messages and garlands of folded
paper cranes, symbols of peace, draped around the park's 29
monuments.
   At a ceremony, officials added 5,551 names of people exposed to
the bomb who died over the past year to the names enshrined in a
granite cenotaph, raising the total of claimed victims to 167,243.
   But it is difficult to determine which deaths were directly
related to the bomb, and 140,000 victims is the more accepted
figure. Many researchers believe the risk of death from leukemia,
lung, bone and breast cancer is greater for those exposed to the
bomb.
   Three days after the attack on Hiroshima, the United States
dropped a second atom bomb on the city of Nagasaki, killing 70,000
civilians. Japan surrendered six days later, ending World War II.

   Republican Gov. Mike Hayden has never lost
since he first won election to the Kansas House of Representatives
in 1972, but he faces a strong challenge from a political newcomer
in Tuesday's primary election.
   Recent polls have had Wichita real estate executive Nestor
Weigand Jr. gaining rapidly on Hayden in a six-way battle for the
GOP governor nomination.
   One poll last week put Weigand ahead but by such a small margin
that the race was considered too close to call. Hayden claimed his
own polling had him solidly ahead.
   On the Democratic side, former Gov. John Carlin, who served in
1979-87 and was ineligible under the state constitution to run for
a third four-year term in 1986, was expected to have less trouble
than Hayden in winning his party's nomination.
   Carlin's chief rival for the Democratic nomination is Joan
Finney, who has been state treasurer for 15{ years.
   The problems for Hayden, 46, stem from a lack of popularity in
urban areas and the political backlash from property taxes that
soared after the state reappraised all property and implemented a
classification system that assessed property at different rates.
   The changes hit some medium and small businesses especially hard
and taxpayer protest groups came to the Capitol last winter
demanding changes. When the Legislature adjourned in early May
without doing anything Hayden bore the brunt of the blame.
   Weigand, 51, wealthy president of a family real estate business,
the largest in Wichita, has tried to capitalize on the discontent,
billing himself as a candidate who can solve the property tax
problem.
   However, Weigand has been criticized for lacking governmental
knowledge and for proposing impractical solutions, such as
restoring business inventories to the tax rolls, which industry
strongly opposes and probably can block in the Legislature.
   Also at stake on Tuesday's ballot were nominations for one U.S.
Senate seat and five seats in the House.
   U.S. Sen. Nancy Kassebaum faced token opposition in the
Republican senatorial primary from little-known Gregory Walstrom of
Lawrence.
   In the Democratic primary for Kassebaum's seat, former U.S. Rep.
Bill Roy filed for nomination in June, than a week later announced
he would not campaign for it. Roy represented northeast Kansas in
Congress in 1971-75 and lost senatorial races to Bob Dole in 1974
and to Kassebaum in 1978.
   Roy could not get his name off the ballot after the filing
deadline, and could beat political neophyte Dick Williams on name
recognition alone. If so, Roy will have to decide if he wants to
campaign against Kassebaum in the fall.
   On the House side, U.S. Rep. Bob Whittaker, who has represented
southeast Kansas in Washington for 12 years, did not seek
re-election this year and 10 candidates sought the two party
nominations to succeed him. There was no clearcut favorite in
either party.
   Incumbent Republican Reps. Pat Roberts and Jan Meyers and
Democrat Dan Glickman had no primary opposition, while Democrat Jim
Slattery faced token opposition in Mark Creamer, a crusader for the
legalization of marijuana who sat in jail on a possession
conviction during the primary campaign.
   Secretary of State Bill Graves forecast a turnout of 415,000
voters, 275,000 in the Republican primary and 140,000 in the
Democratic primary. Kansas has 1.166 million registered voters, but
346,000 of them are not registered with either party.

<HEAD>Quake Jolts Iranian Town Devastated By Previous Earthquake</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An earthquake sharply jolted a northern
Iranian town on Monday, more than month after a quake killed 40,000
people in the region. There was no immediate report of damage or
injuries.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the
temblor struck Rudbar, in northern Gilan province, at 12:55 p.m. It
measured 4.5 on the Richter scale of ground motion.
   It said more than 2,000 quakes have shaken the region since the
devastating June 21 earthquake, which registered 7.3 on the Richter
scale. That quake also left 60,000 injured and rendered half
million homeless irovinces of Gilan and Zanjan.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one on the northern pf 6.5.
   An earthquake of 4 on the Richter scale can cause moderate
damage in the local area, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A
7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy
damage.

<HEAD>World Health Organization Urges Smoking Ban on All Aircraft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Health Organization on Monday urged a
smoking ban on all passenger aircraft.
   ``We are now calling for all airlines to be smoke-free. We think
it's sensible, we think it's possible and we think the airlines
would support it,'' John Roberts, WHO's tobacco and health program
manager, told reporters.
   Martin Jarvis, senior scientist of the Imperial Cancer Research
Fund, said separately: ``Simply having non-smoking seats on
aircraft is not an answer to the problem. Non-smokers are still
exposed to smoke.''
   Air Canada last month became the first airline to ban smoking on
all its trans-Atlantic flights. Smoking is banned on most domestic
flights in the United States.
   A survey conducted by the World Health Organization and the
British Medical Association found that some airlines would welcome
a smoking ban if it was introduced by a third party such as a
government or aviation industry body.
   The survey showed the main reason airlines changed their smoking
policy was pressure from consumers.
   ``You can't step off an aircraft if you don't like the smoke.
You are trapped,'' Roberts said.
   A pro-smoking group, Forest, attacked the survey, saying: ``Yet
again the BMA forget that the role of doctors is to serve their
patients, not to dictate to them by force of law how they should
live their lives.''

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ruling party members said today that the
government, fearing a U.S. air attack, was distributing automatic
weapons to tens of thousands of supporters and preparing to
evacuate the Iraqi capital.
   A boycott of Iraqi oil forced Baghdad today to close one of two
pipelines in Turkey that were pumping the bulk of Iraq's exported
oil, Turkish officials said.
   A British official said Iraqi troops rounded up American and
British visitors in Kuwait and taking them to Iraq. The Foreign
Office spokesman said most were passengers from a British Airways
flight stranded in Kuwait since the Iraqi invasion Thursday.
``There is no evidence that they are in any way in trouble,'' the
official said.
   Saudi Arabia was reported reinforcing its troops along the
Kuwaiti border following concerns Iraq may try to invade it.
   Pentagon sources said the USS Independence and its carrier
battle group are now on station in the Arabian Sea, a position that
would allow it to launch fighter planes into the Persian Gulf
region.
   Gulf-based diplomats said soldiers from the American rapid
deployment force, formed to react to crises in the Middle East, had
been dispatched to the area.
   In other developments:
   _The new Kuwait government installed by Iraq hinted it might
take hostages or seize property of nations that take punitive
measures against Iraq.
   _Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said the 100,000 soldiers who
invaded Kuwait began to pull back Sunday. President Bush said Iraq
was lying.
   _Oil prices jumped more than $3 a barrel on news Europe and
Japan were joining the embargo of Iraqi oil. Stocks slumped
worldwide.
   _Hospital officials said at least 300 Kuwaiti and Iraqi soldiers
were killed during the invasion. In London, Kuwaitis arriving on a
special plane said 700 Kuwaitis died.
   The embargo of Iraqi oil grew over the weekend to include Japan
and the European Community. Along with the United States, they
bought more than half Iraq's exported oil, with most of it pumped
through Turkey.
   An official of the state-run Turkish pipeline company BOTAS said
pumping stopped at one of the two Turkish pipelines at 5 p.m. Iraq
reduced flow in the second, wider, pipeline to 70 percent of
capacity, they said.
   There was no comment from Iraq.
   The two pipelines pump Iraqi crude from Kirkuk oil fields in
northern Iraq to a terminal at the northeastern tip of the
Mediterranean. They carry 70 million tons of crude annually,
providing the outlet for the major share of Iraqi exports.
   The BOTAS official said all the countries participating in the
embargo purchase their Iraqi crude from the Turkish outlet.
   Iraq also exports oil through a Saudi Arabian pipeline and via
tankers in the northern Persian Gulf.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said today as saying a total of 366
people had been assembled by Iraqi troops in Kuwait, mostly
passengers from a stranded British Airways flight. They were being
transported by bus to the Iraqi border.
   Baghdad did not give any reason for its action.
   Immediately after the invasion Thursday, 11 Americans were
rounded up by Iraqi troops. They turned up safe in Baghdad.
   The new Iraqi-installed foreign minister of Kuwait, Lt. Col.
Walid Sa'oud Mohammed Abdullah, warned against further sanctions in
a statement broadcast Sunday by Iraqi radio.
   ``Countries that resort to punitive measures against the
provisional free Kuwait government and fraternal Iraq should
remember that they have interests and nationals in Kuwait,'' he
said.
   Iraqi soldiers invaded Kuwait after complaining that its
violation of OPEC production quotas was driving down world crude
prices, lowering Iraqi oil revenues. Saddam also accused Kuwait of
stealing oil from a field that includes land both sides claim.
   The respected Middle East Economic Survey reported today that
Kuwait's oil export facilities had been shut down.
   It also said there was considerable doubt Saudi Arabia, with the
world's largest oil reserves, would be willing to make up the
potential world oil shortage. Kuwait and Iraq together account for
one-fifth of the 23.5 million barrels produced daily by the 13 OPEC
nations.
   Tensions remained high in the region; a U.S. official said in
Washington that Iraqi troops massed on the Kuwaiti-Saudi border
were apparently digging in. An American technician at a secret
Saudi Arabian base said the kingdom had sent 200 to 300 tanks
toward its border with Kuwait.
   Oil industry sources in Saudi Arabia reached by telephone from
Bahrain said Saudi troops were entering the region of Khafji, near
the border. Residents reached by telephone reported intense air
activity near the Saudi airport overnight.
   The Washington Post reported today that Egypt was mobilizing
some elements of its armed forces to assist Saudi Arabia in the
event of an invasion.
   U.S. officials said there was no indication Iraqi troops were
preparing to invade Saudi Arabia. But Bush sent Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney to the kingdom to confer with its leaders, and the
White House said Secretary of State James A. Baker would go this
week to Turkey.
   Saadi Mehdi Saleh, the Iraqi army commander, was quoted by the
Al-Iraq newspaper as saying tens of thousands of volunteers had
joined the army to defend what he called ``Iraq and the revolution
in Kuwait.''
   Americans, he was quoted as saying, ``should understand that the
people of the great leader Saddam Hussein cannot be frightened.''
   Local members of the ruling Baath party said preparations were
under way to evacuate all of Baghdad's 4 million people to camps
outside the city. They were being told that the U.S. Air Force
might attack or that Israel might attack with chemical or nuclear
weapons.
   The party members also said the party had distributed guns,
mainly AK-47 automatic rifles, to tens of thousands of people
around the country.
   State radio said Saddam had ordered the formation of 11 new
Iraqi army divisions, expected to generate 100,000 troops. The Arab
world's most formidible military force is already estimated at 1
million men.
   At a border checkpoint 30 miles south of the Iraqi port city of
Basra, dozens of tanks, armored personnel carriers and trucks
carrying hundreds of soldiers crossed back into Iraq on Sunday.
   But thousands of Iraqi soldiers remained behind in Kuwait,
controlling major government buildings, commerical centers and
ports.
   Diplomats in the region said a new Kuwaiti army fanned out
through Kuwait. The force comprises about 80,000 troops, mostly
Iraqis.
   The nine-member Kuwaiti military government, announced by Iraq
on Saturday, remained a mystery. No photographs of the named
leaders have been shown and 12 reporters brought to Kuwait by the
Ministry of Information could not locate any of them.
   Kuwaiti diplomats said they were all Iraqis, including a
son-in-law of Saddam, a charge official Iraqi media denied.

<HEAD>American Workers' Productivity Rebounds in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The productivity of American workers improved
for the first time in 18 months, climbing at an annual rate of 1.6
percent, the government said Monday.
   Analysts said they were encouraged by the gain in non-farm
productivity _ defined as output per hour of work _ especially in
light of recent data showing rising unemployment and stagnant
economic growth.
   ``It's one tiny bright spot in the midst of a lot of
negatives,'' said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston
&amp; Co., a government securities dealer in New York.
   However, economists said the 1.6 percent gain was still below
the level needed to dramatically boost Americans' standard of
living and improve the nation's ability to compete internationally.
   They also were disturbed at the report's findings on hourly
labor costs, a major inflation measure for businesses. Those costs
rose at an annual rate of 5.6 percent the second quarter of 1990,
well above the 3 percent rise for all of 1989.
   ``The inflation numbers for the rest of the year look horrible,
especially with the shock of the Middle East oil crisis,'' said
Michael K. Evans, who heads a Washington economic forecasting firm.
   The rise in productivity in the second three months of the year
was the first increase since productivity climbed 0.5 percent in
the final quarter of 1988, the Labor Department said.
   Though the report offered good news on American workers'
performance in the April-June period, the agency said revised
figures on last year showed productivity actually fell 0.3 percent
rather than increasing 0.9 percent as first reported.
   The poor 1989 showing was the worst since non-farm productivity
dropped 0.9 percent during the 1981-82 recession, the government
said.
   The report showed that from April to June, the number of hours
Americans worked fell 0.1 percent _ a likely sign that workers were
being laid off in the face of slower economic growth and businesses
just weren't hiring as many new workers, analysts said.
   ``It's a good news-bad news thing,'' Evans said. ``The good news
is that producers are starting to cut costs and lay off
(inefficient) workers and the bad news is that when they lay off
too many workers, we have a recession.''
   In revising numbers for the first quarter of 1990, the agency
offered slightly better figures, saying productivity fell 1.9
percent rather than the 2.7 percent plunge first reported.
   Monday's report showed that unit labor costs, a key gauge of
future price inflation, rose 3.9 percent for the April-June period,
compared with a 3.3 percent increase during all of 1989.
   In the manufacturing sector, productivity increased 3.7 percent,
a big improvement over the 2 percent increase during all of 1989.
Unit labor costs in that sector rose 2.6 percent, compared with the
2.2 percent increase during all of last year.
   Total business productivity, including farming, rose 1.9 percent
for the first quarter, compared with a 0.2 percent drop for all of
1989.
   Since 1982, productivity growth has averaged 1.4 percent a year.
   Increasing productivity is considered basic to boosting living
standards because it allows businesses to pay workers more as their
output rises without risking higher inflation.

   The White House said today it is ``clearly in
the national interest'' to end Iraq's aggression. Sources said the
USS Independence moved close enough to the tense Persian Gulf
region to launch fighter planes.
   The White House said Secretary of State James A. Baker III will
travel to Turkey mid-week, as Defense Secretary Dick Cheney arrived
in Saudi Arabia to open talks on ``appropriate ways to defend their
country.'' Oil pipelines critical to Iraq's oil distribution run
through Turkey and Saudi Arabia.
   Bush also stepped up discussions with Western allies.
   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the president would meet
over dinner tonight with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney,
following meetings with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
and NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner.
   The White House continued its tough line on Iraq's military
invasion of Kuwait.
   ``It is true that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait threatens regional
and world stability, threatens OPEC and could force severe economic
consequences on the United States,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``From the moment the first Iraqi soldier entered Kuwait, it has
been clearly in the national interest to stop Saddam Hussein. This
is an overt situation. His tanks are real and moving. Our response
is real and moving on all fronts, diplomatic, economic, political
and military,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Pentagon sources said the USS Independence and its
carrier battle group are now on station in the Arabian Sea, a
position that would allow it to launch fighter planes into the
Persian Gulf region.
   Officially, the Pentagon would only say that the huge warship
was operating in the Indian Ocean, and that it is being escorted by
eight smaller warships and four support ships.
   Asked the purpose of Baker's mission to Turkey later this week,
Fitzwater said every country in the region faces ``a degree of
threat'' from Iraq, which last Thursday launched a lightning
invasion of Kuwait.
   ``We don't know what Saddam Hussein's intentions are. And
certainly every country suffers a more indirect threat of OPEC
takeover'' by Iraq, he said.
   He said the situation in the Gulf ``remains extremely serious.
There is no information suggesting that Iraqi military units are
departing Kuwait. To the contrary, the Iraqi military presence
throughout Kuwait, including along the Saudi border, remains
extremely large and threatening.''
   Asked if the Cheney was offering the Saudis assurances that the
United States would defend the desert kingdom, Fitzwater said, ``We
have discussed military possibilities and our abilities with all
the countries in the gulf.''
   ``The defense of Saudi Arabia is of paramount concern,'' he said.
   Fitzwater declined comment on reports that Turkey, a member of
NATO, had agreed to cut off the pipelines that carry much of Iraq's
oil to market. He also said the White House could not confirm a
report that Iraq itself had reduced the flow of its oil through
Turkey.
   ``Iraq's invasion of Kuwait threatens regional and world
stability, threatens OPEC and could force severe economic
consequences on the United States,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said Jordan's King Hussein, who has defended Saddam,
called Bush Sunday night. He did not offer details.
   He also expressed concern about possible price gouging by oil
companies that sharply raised gasoline prices within hours of the
Iraqi invasion.
   ``We are concerned about the price increases. There have been
some immediate increases in the spot price of crude oil. It is not
clear that all of the increases that have been reported at the
consumer level are necessary,'' said Fitzwater.
   ``It would be most unfortunate if there were any gouging or
anyone was trying to take advantage of this situation,'' he said.
   Currently, he added, ``the disruption is fairly moderate'' in
U.S. oil supplies.
   An irate Bush on Sunday vowed that Iraq's ``brutal, naked
aggression ... will not stand.''
   The Cheney delegation to Saudi Arabia included Bush's deputy
national security adviser Robert Gates, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf,
commander in chief of the Central Command, which includes the
Persian Gulf, and Paul Wolfowitz, undersecretary of defense for
policy.
   They undertook the mission as the United States intensified
efforts to build worldwide support for a boycott of oil from Iraqi
and Kuwait and to press for United Nations sanctions that could
include a ban on trade with Iraq.
   Bush met with top military and civilian advisers Sunday evening
at the White House after issuing a stern denunciation of the Iraqi
invasion that has inflamed the Middle East.
   The president said Sunday there was ``a strong feeling'' among
the NATO allies including Turkey, which controls a pipeline vital
to Iraq's oil exports, ``that we must have concerted action to
isolate Iraq economically.''
   To Baghdad's claim _ accompanied by government television
footage _ that it had begun pulling out its 80,000 troops, Bush
snapped that the Iraqis ``lied once again.'
   Bush said he knew of no country willing to recognize the
``puppet regime'' of military officers that Iraq has installed in
Kuwait to replace the ruling royal family. The emir fled to Saudi
Arabia as the Iraqi tanks rolled down on Kuwait City.
   ``I want to see the Arab states join the rest of the world in
condemning this outrage and doing what they can to get Saddam
Hussein out,'' said Bush.
   Asked about Jordan King Hussein's defense of the Iraqi ruler,
Bush said, ``I am disappointed to find any comment by anyone that
apologizes or appears to condone what's taken place.''
   Jordan's monarch said Saturday that other Arab states were
``premature'' in condemning the Iraqi invasion. He called Iraq's
ruler ``a patriotic man.''
   But Jordan's foreign minister, Mudar Badran, said his country
would not recognize the new Kuwaiti government.
   Bush lauded Japan, which has joined the U.S. and European
boycott of oil from Iraq and Kuwait despite Japan's heavy reliance
on Persian Gulf oil. Iraq and Kuwait have supplied more than 11
percent of Japan's oil.
   Bush refused to discuss any military moves, but told reporters
his options were ``wide open.''
   The United States imposed an economic boycott on Iraq hours
after its lightning invasion of Kuwait last Thursday. Bush has
spent much of his time since then urging other nations to use
economic pressure to bring Baghdad to heel.
   Asked how he and other world leaders could thwart the Iraqis'
puppet regime, a clearly agitated Bush said, ``Just wait. Watch and
learn.''
   Tens of thousands of Iraqi troops were reported massed in Kuwait
near the Saudi border.

   A 29-year-old unemployed oil equipment salesman
said today that his father was one of three men who fired the shots
that killed President John F. Kennedy on CIA orders.
   During a press conference, Ricky White said his late father,
Roscoe White, joined the Dallas Police Department two months before
the Nov. 22, 1963 assassination so he could carry out the
assassination.
   White, who said his father went by the code name ``Mandarin,''
was stationed at the grassy knoll.
   Two other CIA operatives with code names ``Lebanon'' and
``Saul'' were stationed in the Texas School Book Depository and the
County Records Building overlooking Dealey Plaza, the assassination
site, he said.
   ``He was told by the government to do something,'' White told
dozens of reporters. ``You don't question the government.''
   White said that Lee Harvey Oswald was a part of the plot, but
did not fire shots. He described Oswald and police officer J.D.
Tippit as ``patsies.''
   The Warren Commission concluded that Oswald, acting alone, fired
the shots that killed Kennedy and wounded John Connally, then the
Texas governor. Despite the commission's findings, conspiracy
theories have abounded since the assassination.
   Woody Specht, an FBI agent in Dallas who spent nine years
assigned to the Kennedy assassination case, refused to comment on
the claims other than to say: ``You really need to evaluate the
source on these types of things.
   ``There's been so many claims like this in the last 27 years,''
Specht said. ``You have to use good judgment here, especially from
somebody who was, what, 2 years old at the time?''
   White said today that his father and Tippit picked up Oswald
following the assassination, although Tippit apparently had no
knowledge of the assassination or the plot.
   White said the plan was to drive Oswald to Red Bird Airport but
somewhere along the way, Oswald panicked and got out of the car. At
that point Tippit apparently became suspicious and told Roscoe
White that they would have to go to police headquarters for
questioning.
   At that point, White shot Tippit, Ricky White said.
   ``I know he had to live with this the rest of his life because
J.D. Tippit was a close friend of the family,'' White said.
   Roscoe White's pastor at the time of the assassination, the Rev.
Jack Shaw, was also at today's press conference held in the JFK
Assassination Information Center, which has examined various
conspiracy theories over the years.
   Shaw said Roscoe White discussed the assassination with him on
several agonizing occasions, including a last conversation on his
deathbed.
   Shaw said he believes Roscoe White, who died in a 1971 fire, was
killed by a witness elimination team activated after Kennedy's
death. White had resigned from the Dallas Police Department in 1965
to go into private business, his son said.
   Roscoe White's wife, Geneva, told Shaw of overhearing her
husband and Jack Ruby discuss the assassination plot, Shaw said.
She also overheard them discuss how White would kill Tippit and
Ruby would kill Oswald at police headquarters.
   Ruby fatally shot Oswald two days after Kennedy was assassinated.
   Shaw said Mrs. White overheard Ruby say ``I will take care of
Oswald.'' White responded, ``I will take care of the president and
I will take care of Tippit.''
   Ricky White and several others today characterized Roscoe White
as a CIA operative who had committed several other killings at the
government's behest.
   White said he learned of his father's involvement in the plot 12
years ago and struggled to come to terms with that knowledge. White
said he read part of a diary that discussed the assassination plot,
but he said the diary was taken from the family by the FBI in the
last couple of years.
   White showed reporters documents Monday that he said buttress
his claims that his father killed Kennedy. Among the items were
embarcation slips showing that both White and Oswald left on the
same ship for Marine duty in Japan on Aug. 22, 1957.
   He also gave reporters copies of three faded messages he
believes were sent by U.S. intelligence officials ordering
Kennedy's assassination.
   Bobby Inman, the former deputy CIA director, viewed the messages
and said they were not genuine.

   Former President Jimmy Carter said Monday it
would be a mistake to send U.S. troops to the Middle East in
retaliation for the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, unless Iraq also
invades Saudi Arabia.
   Carter said in an impromptu news conference in his hometown that
he believes President Bush and other U.S. leaders have taken the
right economic and political steps to address last week's invasion.
   ``I don't have any criticism to make of what President Bush and
our leaders have done,'' Carter said. ``I think they have taken
very strong economic and political action _ the condemnations of
Iraq in the United Nations. The martialling of economic punishments
for deprivation of Iraq in Japan and Europe have been a pleasant
surprise for me.''
   ``It would be a mistake at this point, obviously, to deploy any
American troops halfway around the world in an area that's almost
totally inaccessible to us,'' he said.
   During his administration, Carter sent a secret military force
to the region in an effort to rescue American hostages in Iran. The
attempt failed when several of the rescue aircraft crashed and
burned.
   But, Carter said, if Iraq crosses the border of Saudi Arabia, it
is ``inevitable that our nation would respond militarily.''
   He cautioned that trade embargoes will not be a successful
long-term sanction if Iraq refuses to withdraw from Kuwait, noting
that nations will resume buying oil in order to avoid hurting their
own economies.
   ``If Japan does maintain their present decision not to purchase
oil from Kuwait or Iraq, that would be a notable achievement and a
pleasant surprise,'' he said.
   Carter told reporters that Americans must realize many Arab
leaders, out of fear or other considerations, support what Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein has done.
   ``My guess is he hopes to consolidate his position in Kuwait to
let time pass, to let the economic punishments fade away and then
to hold what he's got,'' he said.
   Carter's comments came as he and his wife, Rosalynn, toured the
Plains High School, which they attended. The school is being
restored as part of the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site.

   The grim business of fighting crime will
lighten up a little Tuesday when millions of people are expected to
join in the seventh annual National Night Out.
   The event started with the suggestion that, for one night,
people turn on their exterior lights and go outside as a presence
against street crime.
   More people join in every year and they find novel ways to make
a statement, said Matt Peskin, national co-ordinator, from this
Philadelphia suburb.
   ``It's a July 4 atmosphere, but there's seriousness,'' said
Peskin. ``We call it a party with a purpose.''
   Cities will sponsor hundreds of block parties for residents and
police. Milwaukee is planning 1,000 of them, plus demonstrations to
show people how they can illuminate their properties.
   Night Outers in Syracuse, N.Y., will hold a candlelight march.
Organizers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, will hand out lollipops wrapped
in the local theme: ``Light it Bright, Lock it Tight, Lick Crime.''
   In Louisville, Ky., fire sirens and church bells will sound at 8
p.m., a signal for people to turn on their outside lights and check
the batteries in their home smoke detectors.
   ``The first year, we had about 2{ million people in 400
communities in 23 states,'' Peskin said. ``After the second and
third ones, things began to pick up. Last year we counted 20.2
million people participating in 7,620 communities.''
   This year, the Night Out organizers hope more than 21 million
people will turn out in 8,000 communities in all 50 states, plus
Canadian cities and on U.S. military bases around the world.
   There have been a few success stories _ Night Out people who
spotted a break-in and notified police, Peskin said, and so far no
confrontations or incidents of retaliation.
   ``Generally speaking, crimewise, it's pretty quiet that night,''
Peskin said. ``Houston measured it last year, and they were down 51
percent in major crimes for that full day.''

<HEAD>President Dismisses Bhutto Government, Alleges Corruption</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The president dismissed Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto and her government Monday, alleging rampant
corruption, and the army took over state-run television and the
telephones.
   Opposition leader Mustafa Jatoi was immediately sworn in as
acting prime minister. President Ghulam Ishaq Khan said elections
for a new National Assembly would be held Oct. 24.
   Ms. Bhutto called the president's action ``illegal and
unconstitutional'' and said the corruption allegations were part of
a ``slander campaign'' against her government.
   Ms. Bhutto, the daughter of a former prime minister, took office
in December 1988 and became the first woman to head a modern Moslem
nation. She was hailed as a heroine for restoring democracy to
Pakistan after 11 years of military rule. However, the image
steadily eroded amid allegations of corruption among senior members
of her government and even members of her family.
   Ms. Bhutto also has been accused of inaction for failing to
control ethnic violence in her home province, Sindh.
   ``The government has willfully undermined and impaired the
working of the constitution, resulting in discord, confrontation
and deadlock adversely affecting the integrity, solidarity and
well-being of Pakistan,'' Ishaq Khan told a hastily called news
conference.
   ``Corruption and nepotism in the federal government has reached
such proportions that the orderly functioning of the government
does no longer carry public faith and credibility and despite being
subject to wide public condemnation, the government has failed to
take approriate action,'' he said.
   Pakistan's constitution gives the president the authority to
dissolve the National Assembly if he believes the government is
unable to carry out its duties.
   But many diplomats and observers said the president's decision
appeared to have been based largely on hearsay and could not have
been done without the consent of the powerful army generals.
   The military ruled Pakistan for 25 years of its 43-year history.
Soldiers were deployed throughout the capital Monday, but the army
chief of staff, Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, insisted the military had no
intention of seizing power.
   ``We are not involved in politics. We have never been involved
in politics. We are not going to get involved in politics,'' Beg
said.
   Ms. Bhutto told a news conference that soldiers had surrounded
her house Monday and sealed government offices, including the
intelligence bureau. She said her Pakistan People's Party would
decide later whether to challenge the president in Supreme Court.
   ``I don't feel betrayed by the president. I believe there were
other elements that wanted me out,'' she said. Asked if she planned
to run in the October elections, she replied: ``Most certainly. I
intend to win.''
   The president said his decision was motivated by his commitment
``to democracy and the integrity and stability of Pakistan.'' He
accused the government of ``flouting the constitution, disrepect of
the judiciary, misuse of the official machinery.''
   The move caught members of Ms. Bhutto's Cabinet by surprise.
   ``This is total high-handedness, unconstitutional and illegal,''
said Tariq Rahim, minister for parliamentary affairs. ``It is a
conspiracy against all democratically elected people.''
   Rumors had been circulating for weeks that Ishaq Khan planned to
dissolve the 237-member National Assembly.
   The assembly, which Ms. Bhutto's party narrowly controls, had
been expected to convene Wednesday. But by Monday, the president
still had not formally called the session, giving credence to the
rumors.
   On Sunday, political opponents announced they intended to
introduce a no-confidence motion against Ms. Bhutto's government,
the second in nine months. Ms. Bhutto narrowly survived a
no-confidence vote in November.
   A month after Ms. Bhutto took office, polls placed her
popularity at 54 percent. The latest Gallup Pakistan poll showed
that in June her popularity had tumbled to 34 percent.
   Many Pakistanis, from the tea vendors in the local bazaars to
the country's most powerful industrialists, began to see their
young and inexperienced prime minister as arrogant, unwilling to
compromise and even vindictive.
   Members of her own party privately expressed disillusionment
with Ms. Bhutto's government, complaining that daily life was worse
than under the dictatorship of Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq.
   Zia died in a mysterious plane crash in August 1988, leading to
Ms. Bhutto's election in Pakistan's first free vote in more than a
decade. Zia had seized power in a 1977 coup that toppled Ms.
Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was hanged two years
later.
   Many of Ms. Bhutto's party members in Parliament have expressed
fears of an early election, saying they have nothing to show
voters. During 20 months in power, the government has passed no
legislation except the federal budget.
   Ms. Bhutto's relationship also has deteriorated with the army,
which has become increasingly critical of the government's
inability or unwillingness to deal with the violence in Sindh
Province. Gang warfare between rival ethnic groups claimed more
than 400 lives since late May.

   Iraqi troops in Kuwait rounded up American and
British visitors from two hotels in Kuwait for transport to Iraq,
but the foreigners did not appear to be in danger, the British
Foreign Office said today.
   Thirty-eight Americans were among those rounded up, the State
Department said in Washington.
   A Foreign Office spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the government believed 366 people had been assembled, mostly
passengers from a British Airways flight stranded in Kuwait since
the invasion by Iraqi troops Thursday.
   ``We are trying to establish the precise details now,'' said the
spokesman. ``There is no evidence that they are in any way in
trouble.''
   Word of the roundup was received from the British Embassy in
Kuwait.
   The official added that Baghdad had not given any reason for its
action and Britain was trying to organize a team of diplomats to
meet the buses carrying the foreigners at the Iraq-Kuwait border.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said: ``We hold Iraq responsible'' for the safety of the 28
Americans.
   Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly summoned Iraqi
Ambassador Mohamed Sadiq al-Mashat to demand information about the
whereabouts of the 28, she said.
   ``It's premature to call them hostages,'' she said. ``We don't
know their destination.''
   The British Foreign Office said the tourists apparently were
being taken to Baghdad.
   ``We hope the idea is that they will be able to continue their
flight from there,'' a Foreign Office spokesman told Britain's
domestic news agency, Press Association.
   The British and U.S. visitors were staying at a transit hotel at
Kuwait airport and at the SAS hotel in Kuwait city.
   The spokesman said the Iraqi move did not appear to involve
foreigners who live in Kuwait.
   Shortly after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi troops took 34
British military advisers to Baghdad. They are still being held
there.
   The government said it did not consider the soldiers to be
hostages but rather in ``temporary custody.''
   The Foreign Office said today it was holding negotiations both
with the Iraqi Embassy in London and through officials in Baghdad
for their release.
   The Foreign Office summoned Iraqi Ambassador Azmi Shafiq
Al-Salihi, who was told in ``robust'' language about Britain's
anger over the invasion of Kuwait.
   The ambassador was also warned of Iraq's international
obligations toward British citizens in Kuwait and the servicemen
who were taken to Baghdad.
   Eleven American oil workers were also seized by Iraqi troops
after the invasion, but they turned up unharmed in Baghdad.
   In Bonn, a West German Foreign Ministry spokesman said it heard
reports from its embassies in Kuwait and Baghdad that over the
weekend a number of Germans also were taken from hotels in Kuwait.
   ``We don't have precise information about how the action
occurred. We have information that at least some of them were
brought to Baghdad,'' said the spokesman, who asked not to be
further identified.

   Five West African leaders agreed today to
send troops and a naval task force to Liberia to help end a tribal
war one leader said has turned the nation into ``a slaughterhouse.''
   Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary-general of the Organization of
African Unity, told The Associated Press the summit had agreed in
principle to intervene militarily and were discussing modalities
and logistics.
   Conference sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said
leaders were considering sending in troops by land from neighboring
Sierra Leone and Guinea as well as a naval force to impose a
cease-fire and install an interim government. The government would
organize free and fair elections in the West African nation
devastated by seven months of civil war, according to the plan.
   It comes a day after the United States sent Marines into
Monrovia to evacuate Americans.
   In Liberia, the rebel National Patriotic Front said it was
organizing demonstrations in four Liberian towns against the
African intervention.
   Nigeria, the most powerful nation in the region, already hasese companies
are usually given two
options: the traditional ``mommy track'' or the same professional
track taken by male employees. Fearing the overtime and transfers
that men endure for a business career, about 95 percent choose the
traditional track.
   When those women return to work after having children, they find
only ``part-time'' jobs, positions that are really full-time work
without the benefits of lifetime employment.
   Many firms rely on non-permanent female employees, who earn
one-half to two-thirds what their male colleagues earn for similar
work, to cut personnel costs.
   Eiko Shinotsuka, a labor economist at Ochanomizu Women's
University in Tokyo, says the system is efficient, but it means
that most women work as clerks or in other dead-end jobs.
   And remaining single or childless is no guarantee of career
opportunity, Shinotsuka says.
   Surveys show that just over 1 percent of all managers in major
Japanese corporations are women, mostly at lower levels of
management. Only 3.8 percent of all Japanese companies, in most
cases tiny entrepreneurships or family businesses, are headed by
women, according to Tokyo Shoko Research, a private research
institute.
   Sexual equality is guaranteed by the Japanese Constitution.
Since 1986, an equal employment opportunity law has required
companies to let women apply for positions previously open only to
men.
   Unlike the United States, the law does not specify penalties or
require that women be hired or receive equal training or promotion
opportunities.
   In July, a Japanese court made the first ruling in favor of
women who complained they had been denied promotions on the basis
of their sex, but the court did not order any mechanism for
promoting the complainants. The 18 women, however, were awarded
$640,000 in compensation.
   ``Women can't go to the courts with a law that only says firms
should `try' to provide equal treatment. The law has helped, but
it's still no good. It needs penalties for enforcement,'' Mrs.
Shinotsuka says. ``It would be better to eliminate discrimination
altogether.''
   The absence of a popular women's movement and customs prevailing
outside the office have inevitably slowed progress in overcoming
discrimination.
   Most Japanese men still expect their mothers and sisters, their
wives and even their female colleagues to wait on them. After
working hours, many men entertain clients in bars where beautifully
clad women light their cigarettes, flatter and serve them.
   Attitudes are beginning to change slowly.
   Some women also have begun to protest against Japan's immense
sex industry, against violence and pornography in comics read
openly by Japanese men on subways and elsewhere, and other images
that they say dehumanize women.
   The nation's first sexual harassment case ever was filed last
year and since then complaints of such problems have ballooned.
   Some analysts credit the rising awareness of women's problems to
Takako Doi, a sharp-witted former law professor who has led Japan's
top opposition party since 1986.

   By Monday, Ali al-Sabah, counselor at the
Kuwaiti Embassy, had shed his traditional, coat-and-tie diplomat's
uniform in favor of a short-sleeved shirt.
   Like the other 15 diplomats at Kuwait's embassy, al-Sabah has
been pulling round-the-clock shifts at the heavily guarded,
suburban chancery.
   But sleep deprivation was nothing, he said, compared to the
hardship of Kuwaitis in their homeland, invaded by Iraq last
Thursday.
   ``We have people suffering back home,'' said al-Sabah.
   Although Kuwait is under occupation, al-Sabah said the embassy
was functioning: Ambassador Saud Nasir al-Sabah has met with State
Department officials, granted interviewed and appealed for the
United States to take military action to oust the Iraqis.
   Embassy officials stay in touch with Kuwait's royal family, who
fled to neighboring Saudi Arabia after the invasion.
   Life, however, was far from normal at the embassy _ a low-slung
building, opulently furnished with plush couches and thick red
carpet.
   ``Things are about as abnormal as you can get,'' said one of the
eight armed State Department security officials assigned to guard
the embassy since the crisis started. Al-Sabah said embassy
officials had received telephone threats.
   Outside the mammoth iron gates leading to the embassy is a sign
that reads: ``No passports or documents will be accepted until
further notice.''
   Al-Sabah said a telephone hotline had been established to allow
Kuwaiti students around the country to stay in contact with the
embassy. Some 2,000 Kuwaitis live in the United States.
   Meantime, al-Sabah said the embassy was in full support _ but
did not pay for _ a full-page advertisement placed in Monday's
editions of The Washington Post.
   ``Stop Iraqi Aggression Against Kuwait,'' read the ad, which
urged people to call the White House and members of Congress. It
provided a number for the White House, where an aide said the
telephone was ringing constantly.
   A group calling itself the Committee to Free Kuwait from Iraqi
Occupation and for the Restoration of Sovereignty placed the ad. A
spokesman, who didn't want his name used, said the group was
composed of Kuwaiti citizens and their friends.

   The president today dissolved Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto's government and declared a state of
emergency. The army took over the national television station and
telephone exchanges.
   Ms. Bhutto called the president's charges of corruption and
ineptness during her 20-month administration a ``slander
campaign.'' She hinted the military might have been involved in the
dismissal.
   Army chief of staff Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg said the military moves
were taken to assure an orderly transition to other civilian
authorities, and were not an attempt by the military to seize power.
   ``We are not involved in politics,'' Aslam Beg said of the
military, which has controlled the country for 25 of its 43-year
history. ``We are not going to get involved.''
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan's dismissed the government, called
for new elections, appointed an interim prime minister and declared
a state of emergency.
   ``The president is satisfied that a grave emergency exists in
which the security of Pakistan is threatened by external aggression
and by internal disturbance beyond the power of the provincial
governments to control,'' said the proclamation issued by Ishaq
Khan on Monday night.
   In dissolving the National Assembly, the law-making lower house
of Parliament, Ishaq Khan said Ms. Bhutto's government was corrupt
and politically inept.
   Ishaq Khan, who as head of state has the constitutional power to
dissolve the government, set new elections for Oct. 24. Opposition
leader Mustafa Jatoi was immediately sworn in as acting prime
minister to head a four-member caretaker government.
   Ms. Bhutto, 37 and the first woman to lead a modern Moslem
nation, called the president's action ``illegal and
unconstitutional'' and said corruption charges were part of a
``slander campaign.''
   ``He has established an undemocratic interim government by
disbanding a democratic government,'' said a subdued Ms. Bhutto,
adding her Pakistan People's Party would decide later whether to
challenge the president in the Supreme Court.
   ``I don't feel betrayed by the president. I believe there were
other elements that wanted me out,'' she said.
   Asked if she planned to run in the elections, she replied:
``Most certainly. I intend to win.''
   ``I have told members of the People Party to stay peaceful. We
will not ask them to take to the streets,'' she said. ``The
situation should be tackled politically. We must not give any
pretext to the present regime to get away from the promise to hold
elections on Oct. 24.'
   Ms. Bhutto has been criticized widely for inaction,
unwillingness to compromise, failure to control resurging ethnic
violence in her home province and mounting charges of corruption
within her government.
   But many diplomats and observers said the president's decision
would not have been done without the consent of the powerful army
generals, who still cast a long shadow on Pakistan's infant
democracy.
   Ms. Bhutto said the army this afternoon had surrounded her
house, sealed the offices of the Prime Minister's Secretariat as
well as the offices of the Intelligence Bureau.
   ``This is very strange if this is a civilian process,'' she said.
   Rumors have been circulating for weeks around Pakistan's capital
that Ishaq Khan planned to dissolve the 237-member National
Assembly and call new elections.
   The army has become increasingly critical at the government's
handling of ethnic strife that has claimed more than 400 lives
since late May. The army blames members of Ms. Bhutto's party for
much of the violence, which is centered on Ms. Bhutto's home
province of Sindh.
   Ishaq Khan cited the violence as another reason for dismissing
the government.
   Ms. Bhutto took office on Dec. 2, 1988 and at age 35 became the
first woman to lead a modern Moslem nation. She was hailed as a
heroine for restoring democracy to Pakistan after 11 years of
military rule.
   But that image has steadily been eroded, largely because of
increasing charges of corruption among senior members of her
government and even members of her family.
   Even members of her own party privately express disillusionment
with Ms. Bhutto's government, complaining that life was worse under
her than under the dictatorship of Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, who
seized power in a 1977 coup that toppled Ms. Bhutto's father,
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
   Bhutto was hanged two years later for his alleged complicity in
a murder plot.

<TEXT>
   The slaughter of a cow by Moslems led to
rioting with Hindus that injured at least 50 people and left 82
houses burned, witnesses said Monday. Hindus revere cows.
   The clash took place Sunday at Gojeta, 62 miles south of
Katmandu, three days after the dispute began during a Moslem
festival, said the witnesses contacted by telephone.
   The witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Hindus objected when Moslems killed a cow as part of the festival
Thursday.
   Nepal, the world's only Hindu kingdom, bans the slaughter of
cows. It is punishable by 14 years imprisonment.
   The witnesses said that in retaliation, Hindus killed a pig
later Thursday and threw the carcass in front of a mosque,
escalating tensions. Pork is banned under Islamic law.
   Tensions simmered between the two communities over the weekend,
and the violence broke out Sunday after an argument between the two
groups.
   At least five of the injured were in serious condition, the
witnesses said.
   About 90 percent of Nepal's 17 million people are Hindus.
Moslems comprise 3 percent of the population and live mostly in
southern Nepal along the border with India.
   Clashes between the two communities are not unusual.

   A police officer was slightly injured while on

_ driven by his mother.
   The accident occurred when Senior Cpl. Joe Copeland, 26, slowed
down on a freeway Sunday to avoid a rolled-up tarpaulin that had
just fallen onto the pavement from a truck, said Sgt. W.D. Elsey.
   The driver of the car that struck his squad car was Joyce
Copeland, 45, of Lancaster. Copeland's 16-year-old sister was a
passenger in his mother's car.
   Police Sgt. Jay Cooper said the three Copelands were slightly
injured and stayed in their cars until other officers arrived. Mrs.
Copeland asked the officers to relay a message to her son that she
had been in an accident.
   ``They informed her that she was in an accident with her son,''
Cooper said.
   The three Copelands were treated at Methodist Medical Center and
released. Both mother and son refused to comment.

   Disruption of oil supplies from Iraq and Kuwait
poses no immediate danger of shortages, experts said Monday.
   But the world's oil reserves could be called upon quickly,
putting upward pressure on prices, they said.
   All eyes will be on Saudi Arabia, which has the greatest
capacity to make up for the disruption, but would fear retaliation
from neighboring Iraq, the experts said.
   ``In the short-term, I don't think people are panicking too
much,'' said Lucy Mullins, an oil analyst at the London investment
firm of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd. ``The world could last six
months or so almost quite happily.''
   The Iraqi supply is being disrupted by a joint embargo by the
United States, the European Community and Japan. Iraq on Monday
reduced the flow of oil through Turkish pipelines which can carry
up to half of Iraq's oil production.
   Kuwaiti production has come to a halt since Iraq's Thursday
morning invasion.
   Although Iraq and Kuwait are among the world's biggest
producers, their combined production of 4.7 million barrels a day
represents just 9 percent of the world's output.
   The oil market has been experiencing an excess of supply and oil
importers' stocks are high, experts say. The oil shocks of the
1970s also have made industrial nations used to cutting demand.
   Oil prices still jumped about $3 a barrel Monday, as oil buyers
scurried to secure supplies. The spot price of North Sea Brent
Blend, the most widely traded international crude oil, was trading
at $26.29 a barrel in London late Monday afternoon.
   The 24-nation International Energy Agency's governing board
planned to meet at its Paris headquarters on Thursday to assess the
situation's impact on its members, spokeswoman Joyce Heard said.
   But the meeting was unlikely to result in the imposition of the
agency's emergency oil sharing program, she said.
   One or more member countries must be deprived of at least 7
percent of its normal oil supply before the countries start sharing
their oil, she said.
   But the board was expected to discuss demand restraint measures,
which can include taxes, fuel switching and the use of oil stocks,
she said.
   Iraq produced 3.1 million barrels a day in July and Kuwait 1.6
million, the IEA said.
   Total world production came to 54.2 million barrels a day in the
second quarter, the agency said.
   Consumption in the traditionally weak three-month summer period
came to 51.4 million barrels a day.
   As of July, the 24-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development had 99 days worth of oil stocks, the IEA said.
   The Middle East Economic Survey, a weekly newsletter, reported
Monday that current excess capacity by members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries amounted to 3.5 million barrels of
oil a day.
   This extra capacity is concentrated in Saudi Arabia with a spare
2 million barrels a day, the United Arab Emirates with 600,000,
Venezuela with 500,000 and Libya with 300,000, the newsletter said.
   Venezuela, far from Iraq, is most likely to increase its output,
experts said. Norway, which doesn't belong to OPEC, might be able
to kick in an extra 200,000 barrels a day, Ms. Mullins said.
   But supplies from the North Sea have been constrained by summer
maintenance and industrial action by oil workers.
   It is still unknown if OPEC members will observe their output
quotas and back the oil shortage.
   Some members would welcome the higher prices prompted by Iraq's
actions. But pricing moderates in the cartel might increase output
to ease prices and reduce the crises.
   Said Ian Graham, an oil analyst with County Natwest Woodmac:
``It's a matter of whether Saudi Arabia feels confident enough to
bump up its production in the face of a belligerent neighbor.''

   The young survivors of the 1988 quake were brought to this

New York. Diocese members decided to sponsor the trip because they
believe the survivors need help long after the tremors have

   They already had visited Washington and Boston, and spent two

<TEXT>
   President Bush is postponing a South American
trip in September under the pressure of budget negotiations with
Congress, but still plans to spend five days stumping for
Republican candidates around the country, the White House said
Monday.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush put off
a scheduled Sept. 16-22 trip to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay
and Venezuela.
   Bush postponed the trip because of ``the need to be personally
involved in the budget negotiations in September and the prospect
of preparing for a sequestration on Sept. 30,'' he said.
   If the budget talks fall, the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law
will require an estimated $100 billion in automatic,
across-the-board cuts on federal programs in October.
   In addition to political trips to 10 cities over five days, Bush
will visit New York City twice next month _ to dedicate Ellis
Island on Sept. 9 and attend a U.N. conference on children on Sept.
30. He also will address the U.N. General Assembly on Oct. 1.
   Fitzwater said Bush plans to travel to Kennebunkport, Maine, on
Friday for a 24-day summer vacation.
   Here is the president's full travel schedule:
   Aug. 10: Departs White House for summer home in Kennebunkport.
   Aug. 20: Travels to Baltimore to address Veterans of Foreign War
convention, returns to Maine.
   Sept. 3: Returns to White House from Maine.
   Sept. 6: Tsravels to Topeka, Kan., for fund-raiser for Gov. Mike
Hayden and Tallahassee, Fla., for Rep. Bill Grant, R-Fla., and the
Florida GOP.
   Sept. 9: Attends dedication of the restored Ellis Island in New
York harbor, the historic waystation for immigrants to the United
States.
   Sept. 11-12: Flies to Denver for fund-raiser for Rep. Hank
Brown, a Senate candidate, and the Colorado GOP. Proceeds to Los
Angeles for a fund-raiser for Sen. Pete Wilson, running for
governor, and spends night in Los Angeles. Flies to San Francisco
Sept. 12 for another Wilson fund-raiser.
   Sept. 26-27: Flies to Akron, Ohio, for fund-raiser for former
Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich, now running for governor, then to
Chicago for a fund-raiser for Rep. Lynn Martin, a Senate candidate.
Spends the night in Minneapolis.
   He attends a fund-raiser on Sept. 27 in Minneapolis for the GOP
gubernatorial candidate, flies to Cleveland for another fund-raiser
for Voinovich and then Detroit for a fund-raiser for Senate
candidates.
   Sept. 30: Travels to New York City to attend the U.N. Conference
on Children, remains overnight.
   Oct. 1: Addresses U.N. General Assembly.

<TEXT>
   President Bush paid a brief visit Monday to
Republican Party Chairman Lee Atwater, back in a hospital in his
fight against a brain tumor.
   Atwater re-entered George Washington University Hospital
Thursday and reportedly was running a fever. A press aide at the
Republican National Committee said Atwater was ``fine.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush decided
to visit the GOP chairman on the spur of the moment.
   ``He just got to thinking about Lee this morning and called him
at the hospital and during the phone call said he'd like to come
over and see him. Lee said, `Great,' and he went over,'' Fitzwater
said of Bush.
   The president spent 15 minutes in the hospital, a few blocks up
Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House.
   Atwater, 39, collapsed before a speech in March and subsequently
underwent radiation treatment for an inoperable brain tumor. He has
also been undergoing physical therapy.
   The party recently named Republican strategist Charles Black to
act as its chief spokesman during Atwater's convalescence.
   Scott Sowry, deputy press secretary at the Republican National
Committee, said Atwater re-entered the hospital Thursday.
   ``The tumor is dying. Everything is fine and he's working on his
therapy,'' said Sowry.

   The U.N. Security Council today
overwhelmingly approved sweeping trade and military sanctions
against Iraq, including a ban on oil purchases, to punish Baghdad
for invading Kuwait.
   The vote was 13-0, with two abstentions by Cuba and Yemen on the
15-member council, which adopted the sanctions resolution proposed
by the United States. It said Iraq had launched an armed attack
against Kuwait and usurped the authority of Kuwait's legitimate
government.
   The sanctions were intended to force Iraq to withdraw its troops
from Kuwait and the resolution bans ``the import into their
territories of all commodities and products originating in Iraq or
Kuwait and exported there from after the date of this resolution.''
   President Bush praised the decision and called for ``full and
total implementation of these sanctions, ruling out nothing at
all.''
   He told reporters at the White House: ``The will of nations
around the world will be to enforce these sanctions.''
   It was the third time in its 45-year existence that the world
body had voted sanctions against a member state. The last time was
1967 when the Security Council voted similar, comprehensive
sanctions against the white minority government of Rhodesia.
   An arms embargo against South Africa still is in effect.
   The sanctions are legally binding for all member nations,
although past council resolutions have often been ignored or
flouted. The United Nations has no enforcement mechanism but later
could call on members to take military action against Iraq or
impose a blockade.
   The vote followed similar sanctions imposed on Iraq by much of
the West, including the United States, Japan and the European
Community. The Soviet Union and China said they would halt arms
shipments to Iraq.
   In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency on Sunday, the
Iraqi-installed military government of Kuwait warned other nations
not to take ``punishing measures'' against it or Iraq. The
provisional government said countries ``have to remember they have
interests and citizens in Kuwait.''
   The U.N. role in the Iraq-Kuwait crisis assumed increasing
importance after divided Arab nations canceled a weekend emergency
summit on the invasion.
   In an emergency session just hours after Thursday's invasion,
the Security Council condemned Iraq's invasion, demanded immediate
and unconditional troop withdrawal, and called for negotiations
between Iraq and Kuwait.
   The council threatened to impose sanctions if Iraq did not
comply.
   The council includes the five permanent members with veto power
_ the United States, Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union.
The 10 non-permanent members are: Canada, Colombia, Cuba, Ethiopia,
Finland, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Romania, Yemen and Zaire.

<HEAD>FDA Approves Drug For Lung Disease Of Premature Infants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said
Monday it has approved a drug that cuts the death rate in half in
premature infants suffering from a severe lung disease.
   The disease, called respiratory distress syndrome, is the most
common cause of death in infants under 30 days old, the American
Lung Association said. The ailment afflicts 50,000 infants each
year and kills about 3,000 of them, the lung association said.
   The drug, called Exosurf, is a mixture of synthetic chemicals
that mimic the action of lung surfactant, a liquid found in the
lungs that helps keep them inflated. Premature infants are unable
to make surfactant, and their lungs can collapse if not treated.
   The drug was invented by Dr. John Clements of the University of
California, San Francisco, and is made by Burroughs Wellcome Co. of
Research Triangle Park, N.C.
   The approval of the drug ``is a very important development,''
said Dr. Mary Ellen Avery, professor of pediatrics at Harvard
Medical School in Boston. ``There has been a significant reduction
in deaths among those who were treated.''
   Exosurf and another experimental surfactant made from cows'
lungs have both been available since last year, when the FDA
allowed distribution under what is called a ``treatment IND.'' That
is intended to make life-saving experimental drugs available before
approval.
   The bovine surfactant, called Survanta, is made by Abbott
Laboratories in Abbott Park, Ill.
   Both have been widely used, and although they have not been
directly compared, ``both work pretty well,'' said Avery, who has
used them. ``I don't think anyone is in a position to say which is
better.''
   A spokesman for Abbott said approval of Survanta was expected
soon.
   Dr. Anthony Corbet, a neonatologist at the Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston who has participated in experimental studies of
Exosurf, said: ``This drug will have its greatest place in treating
very small premature infants, perhaps those under 3 pounds. But
those babies under 3 pounds make a very large contribution to
infant mortality.''
   The infant mortality rate in the United States is 10 deaths per
1,000 live births, Corbet said. About three infant deaths per 1,000
are due to respiratory distress syndrome, he said. Cutting the
number of those deaths in half with Exosurf could significantly
lower the U.S. infant mortality rate, he said.
   In studies with 1,600 infants with respiratory distress
syndrome, Exosurf cut the death rate by 66 percent, the company
said. When given to 1,800 infants who were at risk of developing
the disease but had not yet contracted it, the drug reduced the
death rate by 50 percent, company officials said.
   Corbet said he is giving Exosurf routinely to premature newborn
infants weighing 3 pounds or less, whether they have the disease
yet or not. They have about a 70 percent chance of developing the
disease, he said.
   In less premature infants, Corbet said he generally administers
the drug when the disease appears.
   Dr. Richard Kent of Burroughs Wellcome explained that in the
absence of surfactant, the little air sacs in the lung called
alveoli collapse like inflated balloons if air pressure is not
maintained. When surfactant is added, the alveoli become more like
bubble-gum bubbles and maintain their shape when air pressure
falls, he said.
   About 10,000 infants have been treated with the drug so far,
Kent said. Infants getting the drug in the clinical trials showed
few side effects, with the exception of apnea, a treatable disorder
in which infants intermittently stop breathing for short periods,
the company said. There was also a slight increase in bleeding in
the lungs, the company said.
   Corbet said the drug reduces the need for oxygen and ventilators
with premature infants, and thus can reduce lung injury.
   ``Both oxygen and the pressure from the ventilator damage the
lungs,'' he said. ``And you get lung injury, which doesn't go away
very quickly. That causes a great lengthening of hospitalization.''

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Federal Civil Suit Filed by Peggy Buckey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Monday dismissed Peggy
McMartin Buckey's $1 million civil suit alleging malicious
prosecution in the marathon McMartin Pre-School molestation trial
that ended with her acquittal.
   U.S. District Judge Richard A. Gadbois Jr. said he could
understand how Mrs. Buckey could feel about her seven-year ordeal.
But ``being very, very upset does not state a cause of action,'' he
said.
   Because Mrs. Buckey was ultimately acquitted, the civil action
``just isn't going to fly,'' he said.
   Mrs. Buckey filed the civil suit in January after she and her
son, Raymond, won acquittal on 52 felony charges of child
molestation at the now-defunct pre-school in Manhattan Beach. Ray
Buckey was not named as a plaintiff.
   A second trial, with Ray Buckey as the sole defendant, ended in
a mistrial last month when jurors deadlocked on eight counts. Los
Angeles County District Attorney Ira Reiner said he would not retry
Buckey.
   An attorney for Mrs. Buckey said he would appeal Gadbois' ruling.
   ``The only way we have been able to stay in court anywhere is to
take it to the appellate level,'' said attorney James H. Davis.
``Nobody wants to hear this case. Everybody has had enough of this
case.''
   Mrs. Buckey's civil suit contended she was the victim of a
conspiracy by Los Angeles County, the city of Manhattan Beach,
former District Attorney Robert Philibosian, Children's Institute
International and therapist Kee MacFarlane, Capital Cities-ABC Inc.
and its former reporter Wayne Satz.
   The defendants were accused of defamation, malicious
prosecution, conspiracy and violation of Mrs. Buckey's civil
rights. The suit sought general damages of $1 million and
unspecified punitive damages.
   Although the judge tossed out the federal suit, Mrs. Buckey may
still file claims in state court.
   After the second trial, Raymond Buckey filed a civil suit in
state court against the same defendants.

   An American tourist who spent four days in a
military jail in his native Yugoslavia last week headed home Monday
after paying a $4,500 fine for deserting the Yugoslav army 30 years
ago.
   Zjelko Skalicki, a Cleveland industrialist and naturalized U.S.
citizen, also was given a suspended four-month prison sentence by a
Yugoslav military tribunal, said Pero Novak of Cleveland, who
lobbied Congress for Skalicki's release.
   Skalicki, 53, was making his first visit to his homeland with
his wife and three children when he was arrested last week in a
hotel in Porta Rose, Slovenia.
   Skalicki, who became a U.S. citizen 22 years ago, was a young
man nearing the end of a mandatory two-year tour of duty in the
Yugoslav military when he fled the country.
   ``He did not like the Communists, he did not like the
government, he wanted to be a free man,'' Novak said in a telephone
interview from Cleveland.
   Before he left on vacation, Novak said, Skalicki obtained visas
from the Yugoslav consul in Cleveland and discussed his defection
30 years ago.
   ``They said, `You have amnesty, you're free to go,'' Novak said.
   As for Skalicki's arrest, Novak said, ``You never can depend on
a Communist government. They are ruthless, they are undependable.
They just wanted to get his money.''
   Novak said he did not know whether the Yugoslav military
returned the $7,000 bond that Skalicki posted for his release from
jail on Friday.
   After Skalicki's arrest, about 100 members of several
American-Croatian organizations appealed repeatedly to diplomats
and members of Congress to call attention to Skalicki's plight,
Novak said.
   Among the legislators who contacted diplomats on Skalicki's
behalf were Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan.; Reps.
William Broomfield, R-Mich., and Edward Feighan, D-Ohio, and Ohio's
Democratic senators, Howard Metzenbaum and John Glenn.

<HEAD>Study: Income Gap Between Hispanics And Others Grows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widening income gap between the rich and
the poor in the United States has hit Hispanics especially hard, a
research group said Monday.
   Hispanics have traditionally earned less than non-Hispanics. But
a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said the
difference grew in the 1980s because Hispanic income stagnated.
   Wage levels declined and there were fewer government assistance
programs to aid the poor, the center said.
   In 1979, the group said, the income of the typical Hispanic
family was 71 percent that of the average non-Hispanic family. That
figure had fallen to 66 percent by 1988.
   The center found 28 percent of Hispanics had incomes placing
them in the poorest one-fifth of households in 1987. Eleven percent
of Hispanic households had incomes that put them in the wealthiest
one-fifth that year.
   The report came two weeks after the center reported a post-World
War II high in the earnings gap between poor and rich Americans.
The top 20 percent of households will receive as much after-tax
income this year as the other 80 percent combined, the center said.
   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is a non-profit
research organization, financed by foundations, that studies
government spending, programs and policies affecting low- and
moderate-income Americans.

<HEAD>City To Hire 1,058 New Cops, Cut Other Departments to Pay for Them</HEAD>

   Mayor David Dinkins on Monday ordered the hiring
of 1,058 new police officers for expanded street patrols to combat
what he called ``a surge in violence'' citywide.
   Among the recent incidents that have put Dinkins under pressure
have been the slayings of four children by stray bullets, and the
killings of a 14-year-old boy and a Greenwich Village executive. In
addition, 19 cab drivers have been killed this year.
   On Monday, a sleeping baby was wounded when a bullet went
through the wall of his apartment. The bullet cracked his skull but
didn't penetrate his brain, said Judy Murphy, a spokeswoman for St.
Luke's Hospital. Police had no suspects.
   The mayor said he ``scraped, scratched and squeezed'' to find
$24 million in the just-passed, $27.8 billion fiscal 1991 city
budget to pay for the new officers. The police force now numbers
26,000.
   Among the cuts are $4.6 million from reserves and overhead at
city schools, $4.1 million from city hospitals, $2.8 million from
city-owned residential buildings, and $1.5 million from the
Transportation Department.
   The first group of new recruits will enter the police academy in
October and should graduate by April, when the second class of
recruits enters the program.
   Speaking in Brooklyn's East New York section, which had the most
homicides in the city last year, Dinkins said his goal is not
simply a larger police force.
   ``We want to reduce the rate of violent crime,'' he said. ``To
accomplish that we must do more than simply arrest the criminals.
We must also keep them off the streets.''
   Toward that end, Dinkins also authorized $4.3 million more for
the district attorneys' probation offices and other criminal
justice agencies.
   Most of the 1,058 new officers will be assigned to walk beats,
Dinkins said. Last month, more than 1,100 officers were shifted
from specialized units into seven high-crime precincts. An
additional 200 senior officers were assigned to overtime duty in
those areas.

   While the United States was moving on diplomatic,
economic, political and military fronts against Iraq, the Soviet
Union was working its own diplomatic channels on Monday and keeping
its options open.
   The official news agency Tass said Deputy Foreign Minister
Alexander Belonogov met for a second day with Iraq's ambassador
here, Ghafil Jassim Hussein. It said they discussed Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait but gave no details.
   Belonogov also met Monday with Kuwait's ambassador in Moscow,
Abdulmokhsin Yusef al-Duadj.
   The Soviets were also pursuing an end to the crisis in diplomacy
at the United Nations, where Belonogov previously served as Soviet
representative.
   No sign emerged that the Soviets were working militarily with
the United States against Iraq.
   However, Stanislav Kondrashov, a Soviet commentator on foreign
policy, said no options were ruled out.
   In a front-page article in the government daily Izvestia,
Kondrashov wrote, ``By no means is the Soviet Union automatically
giving its consent to everything that could be done in Washington,
but so far it has not hindered the freedom of ... (U.S.) actions by
not defining beforehand the line beyond which the coincidence of
our positions could end.''
   That appeared to keep Soviet options open further than indicated
by Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on Friday.
   ``As for military intervention, the Soviet Union has no plans,
no operations,'' Shevardnadze said when asked if the Kremlin
planned any military action in connection with Iraq's invasion. He
spoke in Moscow after making a joint call with U.S. Secretary of
State James A. Baker III for a world arms embargo against Iraq.
   The Soviet Union, Iraq's biggest arms supplier, stopped weapons
deliveries last week.
   Soviet security interests are not threatened as much as those of
the United States and other Western countries, but there are
humanitarian concerns. Shevardnadze said 900 Soviets are in Kuwait
and 7,000 to 8,000 are in Iraq and that ``very, very severe
consequences'' would result if they are harmed.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Francois
Mitterrand of France spoke about the crisis by phone Saturday,
Soviet media reported.
   Kondrashov kept up the Soviet media's harsh criticism of
one-time ally Iraq. He said a 1972 friendship and cooperation
treaty between Baghdad and Moscow, which involved military aid, was
a holdover from ``the epoch of global East-West confrontation.''

   Here is a transcript of remarks Monday at the
White House by President Bush, British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner on the
situation in Kuwait.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PRESIDENT BUSH: This was basically a chance to have a photo to
show that we were having this very _ these very important
consultations.
   I might say that we are very encouraged, all of us, by the
action taken in the United Nations _ a strong resolution up there
that shows, I think, that the world is united against the kind of
aggression that we've witnessed.
   But I'd like to ask our guest, the prime minister, to say a
word. And then the secretary general, who has just arrived. And we
were going to do this differently, but now we're out here, go
ahead, please, Margaret.
   PRIME MINISTER THATCHER: May I support the President of the
United States in saying that the news from the United Nations and
the strength of the vote _ 13 votes in favor of mandatory,
comprehensive sanctions, and no votes against _ is very good. That
means that it becomes law in all the countries of the world. That
is extremely good.
   It also follows the strong support that has been given by the
European countries in their condemnation of the action of Saddam
Hussein in invading Kuwait. Japan also condemned strongly, and so
did the Soviet Union. So really, the world is condemning the action
and the United Nations resolution will become mandatory and mean
that those sanctions must be enforceable.
   I cannot remember a time when we had the world so strongly
together against an action as now. And I hope that those sanctions
will be properly and effectively enforced as a positive action
against what we all totally and utterly condemn.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Manfred, are you prepared to say a word?
   SECRETARY GENERAL WOERNER: Well, I just arrived. Just a few
thoughts which we have exchanged. My impression is that this is the
moment for the West to show cohesion, determination, and to make it
clear what cannot be accepted in this world, and to safeguard its
own security interests.
   Q: Mr. President, have you received _
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Thank you all.
   Q: Mr. President, did you hear from Saddam today?
   Q: _ any assurances from Saddam Hussein that he won't invade
Saudi Arabia?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I've had no such assurances directly to me.
   And what was the last question? We really have to get in. You
all are getting _
   Q: Did you get a message _ a personal message from Saddam?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: No, I've not had a personal _
   Q: Do you hope that these sanctions _ do you _ in light of these
sanctions, that you can forego a blockade?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: These sanctions _ we need to discuss full and
total implementation of these sanctions, ruling out nothing at all.
These sanctions must be enforced. I think the will of the nations
around the world _ not just the NATO countries, not just the EC
(European Community), not just one area or another _ the will of
the nations around the world will be to enforce these sanctions.
   And so, we'll leave the details of how we implement it to the
future, but we'll begin working on that immediately, working _ one
of the consultations that's going on right now in the Oval Office
is just exactly how we go about encouraging others to do that and
what we ourselves should be doing.
   Q: Mr. President, the oil pipeline _ the pipeline through Saudi
Arabia _
   Q: What did Saddam tell the US counselor _ charge?
   PRESIDENT BUSH (off mike): These sanctions will be enforced,
hatever it takes.

<HEAD>With AM-Iraq-Kuwait Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a brief chronology in the dispute between Iraq and
Kuwait:
   July 17 _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accuses Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates of flooding the oil market and driving prices
down. He says Iraq has lost $14 billion in oil revenue. He further
charges that Arab states in the Persian Gulf are conspiring with
the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq's economy and undermine
its military buildup.
   July 18 _ Iraq accuses Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion worth of
oil from wells along the disputed border and of seeking to wreck
Iraq's economy by overproducing oil.
   July 20 _ Kuwaiti officials suggest Iraq's sudden outburst of
belligerence is aimed at getting its creditors _ including Kuwait _
to write off billions of dollars in debts from the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war.
   July 24 _ The U.S. Defense Department announces that U.S. Navy
warships and aircraft are holding a ``short-notice exercise'' in
the Persian Gulf with the United Arab Emirates, about 600 miles
southeast of the Kuwait-Iraqi border. Kuwait calls a state of alert.
   July 25 _ The Iraqi government in Baghdad says that it will not
be intimidated by U.S. pressure in its oil dispute with neighboring
Kuwait, and Saddams summons the U.S. ambassador for talks.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt says Iraq and Kuwait plan to meet
in Saudi Arabia in an effort to resolve their dispute.
   July 26 _ OPEC ministers in Geneva agree to halt overproduction
in hopes of pushing up the price of crude oil. Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates pledge to abide by the agreement. Analysts say
Saddam clearly influenced the outcome of the meetings.
   July 31 _ Kuwaiti and Iraqi delegations meet in Jiddah, Saudi
Arabia, to negotiate the oil and border dispute. Diplomats say Iraq
has massed 100,000 troops on Kuwait's border, more than triple the
number originally estimated. Aug. 1 _ Iraq pulls out of talks on
the 2-week-old border, oil and money dispute with Kuwait.
   Aug. 2 _ Iraq's powerful army overruns Kuwait before dawn.
Tank-led troops quickly seize the ruler's palace and other
government buildings.
   Aug. 3 _ Shelling and gunfire shake portions of Kuwait's
capital, indicating a last-ditch attempt by Kuwaiti forces to hold
out against the more powerful Iraqi army. Iraqi troops push to
within 5 to 10 miles of the Saudi Arabian border.
   Aug. 4 _ Baghdad announces a new military government for
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. The 12-member European Community imposes an
embargo against imports of Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil.
   Aug. 5 _ Kuwait's new Iraqi-installed government claimes Iraqi
troops begin pulling out of Kuwait, but the United States says it
doubts a withdrawal is really under way.
   Aug. 6 _ The U.N. Security Council orders a worldwide embargo on
trade with Iraq to punish the Arab oil and military power for its
invasion of Kuwait. In Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney and other U.S. military leaders confer with Saudi leaders
about how to defend the oil kingdom against any attack by Iraq.

   Here at-a-glance are some of the developments Monday in the
Iraq-Kuwait dispute.
   _In New York, members of the U.N. Security Council voted for a
mandatory worldwide economic embargo against Iraq, the first such
total U.N. boycott in 23 years.
   _Iraq curtailed its oil through Turkishpipelines, handed out
weapons to civilians and declared its people ``cannot be
frightened'' by U.S. economic and military threats.
   _In Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and
other U.S. military leaders conferred with Saudi leaders about how
to defend the oil kingdom against any attack by Iraq.
   _Tension remained high along the Saudi Arabia-Kuwait border.
Saudi Arabian forces were reported moving northward into areas near
the Iraqi units in Kuwait. Diplomats in the Persian Gulf _ in
reports otherwise unconfirmed _ said the U.S. Rapid Deployment
Force had been dispatched to the Middle East.
   _In the Arabian Sea, a 13-ship U.S. Navy battle group, led by
the aircraft carrier USS Independence, took up station outside the
mouth of the Persian Gulf, within striking distance of Gulf
flashpoints, Pentagon sources said.
   _Major stock markets worldwide plummeted again, worried that an
oil crisis could touch off a recession. Oil prices rose more than
10 percent. Many motorists in the United States and elsewhere were
paying sharply higher prices for gasoline.

<TEXT>
   Five West African leaders agreed Monday to
send troops into Liberia to impose a cease-fire in that country's
civil war.
   Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary-general of the Organization of
African Unity, told The Associated Press the leaders were working
out logistics, but he gave no details.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said rebels seized 14 or 15 foreigners in the Liberian capital of
Monrovia on Monday, including one American, and moved them to an
insurgent headquarters outside the city. She said the U.S. Embassy
reported that forces of Prince Johnson, the leader of one of two
rebel factions, ``have seized hostages.''
   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the leaders at
Banjul were considering sending in troops by land from neighboring
Sierra Leone and Guinea, as well as a naval force. The troops would
impose a cease-fire and install an interim government to organize
free elections, according to the sources.
   They said the interim government would not include any warring
party.
   The task force would comprise troops from Nigeria, Ghana,
Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Gambia. Nigeria already has three ships _
one armed with missiles and heavy guns _ off Sierra Leone, which
neighbors Liberia.
   Thousands of rebels and sympathizers of Liberian rebel leader
Charles Taylor rallied in opposition to the plan. They gathered in
Monrovia and waved banners reading: ``Liberia will be the graveyard
of foreign aggressors.''
   Taylor told them his forces ``will resist any foreign
intervention to the last man,'' the British Broadcasting Corp.
reported.
   The intervention plan was agreed at a summit of the West African
Economic Community. Gambian President Sir Dawda Jawara said in his
opening address that the world was looking to West African leaders
to end the Liberian war.
   ``We can no longer afford to let the situation deteriorate
further,'' he said.
   Most of the 5,000 people killed in the war have been civilians
from the Gio or Mano tribes, which form the backbone of the
rebellion, or from President Samuel Doe's Krahn tribe and the
Mandingo tribe, which also supports Doe.
   The only Liberian at the meeting Monday was the Rev. Regis Carr
of the Liberian Council of Churches, which with the West African
Economic Community had tried to mediate peace talks between the
rebels and the government.
   Those talks broke down after Doe refused to surrender to rebel
demands that he step down.
   Other representatives at the meeting Monday were from Sierra
Leone, Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Togo, and Mali.
   The heads of state and Cabinet members refused to comment on
their three hours of talks. They planned to meet again Tuesday.
   The African initiative would follow U.S. intervention by
hundreds of Marines who flew into Monrovia on Sunday from warships
off Liberia to begin evacuating Americans and some other foreign
nationals. The operation continued Monday without resistance.
   A joint African military intervention is unprecedented, though
individual nations have sent in troops to help friendly leaders.
Senegal, for example, sent 3,000 troops into Gambia in 1981 to put
down a coup attempt against Dir Dawda Jawara.
   Both Doe and Johnson, who split from Taylor's mainstream rebel
army, have appealed for the United States to intervene militarily.
They also have said they would welcome African peacekeepers.
   Johnson precipitated the U.S. evacuation by threatening to start
kidnapping foreign nationals Monday, targeting Americans, Britons,
Indians and Lebanese. He made it clear he wanted to provoke
military intervention.
   Taylor's opposition to intervention stems from distrust of
Nigeria, whose president, Ibrahim Babangida, has been a close ally
of Doe.
   Ms. Tutwiler said Monday's hostages were sent to Johnson
headquarters in Caldwell. No indication emerged that any hostage
was harmed. Nationalities of the non-American hostages were not
disclosed.
   Cuba warned that the use of U.S Marines in the evacuation is a
``gross interference which could bring grave consequences.''
   Cuba's news agency, Prensa Latina, monitored in Mexico, said
Monday that President Fidel Castro wrote to Yoweri Museveni, acting
head of the Organization of African Unity.
   The message said Cuba condemned the Marine action, done ``with
the well-known pretext of protecting the lives and property of
American citizens in Monrovia, cynically declaring that they would
stay in the African country as long as necessary.''

   Andrew Young recalled his days in the civil
rights struggle Monday as he implored Georgians to defy the
pollsters and give him the Democratic nomination Tuesday to become
the state's first black governor.
   Meanwhile, the former Atlanta mayor's front-running opponent,
Lt. Gov. Zell Miller, expressed gratitude to a group of black
supporters.
   In Michigan, Republican candidates wrapped up campaigns in
primaries to choose challengers to Democratic Gov. James Blanchard
and U.S. Sen. Carl Levin.
   And Kansas Republican Gov. Mike Hayden braced for a strong
primary challenge from wealthy real estate agent Nestor Weigand.
   Missouri also has primaries Tuesday, but no statewide races.
U.S. House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., is expected to
have no trouble winning renomination.
   The winner of Georgia's gubernatorial primary will meet
Republican state Rep. Johnny Isakson in the November general
election. The incumbent, two-term Democrat Joe Frank Harris, wasn't
eligible to seek re-election.
   On Monday, Miller and Young held news conferences in television
markets across the state, winding up a three-week campaign that
began when they emerged from a five-man field in the July 17
primary.
   Miller received 41 percent of the vote in that race to 29
percent for Young, and two polls last week gave the white
lieutenant governor a lead of about 20 percentage points.
   Despite the prospect that Young could be Georgia's first black
governor, race had come up rarely until Monday, when both
candidates mentioned past associations with black groups. Blacks
make up about 28 percent of the state's registered voters.
   Young's campaign day began at Paschal's Motor Lodge in Atlanta,
a headquarters of the civil rights movement.
   He noted that Monday was the 25th anniversary of the signing of
the Voting Rights Act by President Johnson, and recalled that some
fellow supporters of the late Martin Luther King Jr. died in the
struggle for that law.
   Young then took a jab at Miller's main issue, a proposed state
lottery.
   ``I don't believe anybody marched, I don't believe anybody went
to jail _ or died, for certain _ for a lottery,'' Young said.
   Miller appeared in Savannah before about 50 members of the
Political Advisory Council of Chatham County, a black group that
endorsed him over Young. Miller said the group helped him 16 years
ago when he won his first race for lieutenant governor. Appearing
to choke up, he said, ``Now, 16 years later, when it's so difficult
to do what you're doing, you're reaching out to me again.
   ``We're going to be the Democratic nominee, and you're going to
play an important part in it, and I ain't going to forget it,'' he
promised.
   In Michigan, conservative U.S. Rep. Bill Schuette is running
against the more conservative Clark Durant for the right to take on
Levin, who is unopposed in the Democratic primary in his bid for a
third Senate term.
   Recent polls favored Schuette. He said Monday that he wasn't
taking anything for granted, but said, ``I'm going to take it right
to Carl Levin. We're going to be aggressive. I'm pulling no
punches.''
   Michigan Senate Majority Leader John Engler is expected to roll
over his primary opponent, General Motors Corp. engineer John
Lauve, to win the GOP gubernatorial nomination.
   Engler has focused on Blanchard, a two-term Democratic
incumbent, and his 20 years experience in the Legislature.
Blanchard, who is seeking a third four-year term, has no primary
opponent.
   In Kansas, Hayden's bid for a second four-year term faces strong
opposition from Nestor Weigand of Wichita, and Democratic former
Gov. John Carlin is favored to win the Democratic nod to seek his
old job.
   U.S. Sen. Nancy Kassebaum is opposed by political unknown
Gregory Walstrom of Lawrence in her bid for the GOP nomination to a
third six-year term.
   In Missouri, Gephardt's only challenger in the Democratic
primary in his St. Louis district is Nicholas F. Clement, a
supporter of right-wing extremist Lyndon LaRouche. Three
Republicans are running for their party's nomination in the
district.

   Perhaps ``Room Arranging Dos and Don'ts''
won't sell as many videocassettes as ``Batman.'' But business for
how-to videos is up, and even the most obscure instructional
cassettes have a chance.
   At the ninth annual Video Software Dealers Association
Convention here this week, hit films like ``Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles'' are drawing most of the attention from the 15,000 video
retailers, distributors and producers. In the corners of the VSDA's
convention floor, though, lurk more intriguing productions.
   Pacific Arts Video offers ``Sirius Puppy Training,'' with hints
on how to teach man's best friend to sit, stay, heel and go to the
bathroom outdoors. The Crocus video distribution company is pleased
with sales for ``Aerobics With Soul,'' a workout set to African
music. Wood Knapp Video is featuring ``Yo-Yo Man,'' an
instructional cassette hosted by the Smothers Brothers that comes
with a free yo-yo.
   ``The how-to, self-instruction category is one of the fastest
growing,'' said John Bjerke of Better Homes &amp; Gardens Video. In
addition to its new ``Room Arranging'' release, Better Homes is
selling the popular ``Building a Deck,'' ``Refinishing Furniture,''
``Wallpaper Like a Pro!'' and ``Foolproof Flower Beds.''
   According to figures compiled by Nielsen Media Research,
exercise and instructional titles accounted for an estimated 16
percent of pre-recorded cassettes sold last year. Another study
found that demand for instructional titles is growing.
   Two of the four most popular selections from Wishing Well
Distribution are yoga cassettes: ``Alive With Yoga With Lilias
Folan'' and ``Richard Hittleman's Yoga Course.''
   ``People are focusing more on stress reduction and relaxation
these days,'' said Wishing Well's Kim Heron. ``And that's what yoga
is.'' The cmpany's sales more than doubled from 1988 to 1989.
   Proudly proclaiming ``Identify birds by video!,'' MasterVision
is showcasing a five-volume series called ``The Audubon Society's
Video Guide to Birds of North America.''
   ``It's sight and sound _ perfect for bird-watching,'' said
MasterVision President Richard Stadin. ``No book can do this. Books
are two-dimensional, but the video is three-dimensional.''
   Other MasterVision cassettes include one on little-league
baseball tactics and ``Basic Arabic by Video.'' ``This is very
current today,'' Stadin noted.
   Not all of the new how-to titles are necessarily tame. Playboy
Home Video introduced ``Secrets of EuroMassage,'' with a Playboy
bunny giving convention goers free massages to help boost sales.
   One how-to video that would interest convention guests isn't
available in any booth. That's a cassette that would give
distributors and retailers tips to help stop slowing video sales
and consumer dissatisfaction.
   In a glum convention keynote address, Robert Klingensmith,
president of the Paramount Picture's video division, said that
after 10 years of explosive growth the cassette business now has
stalled.
   ``We have new customers who are hard to reach and old customers
whose interests may be waning or need to be reinforced,''
Klingensmith said. He called on store owners to make the practice
of renting and buying tapes more pleasant.
   To help generate business, Paramount pledged $100,000 to a
proposed industry-wide advertising campaign that would highlight
the joys of videocassettes.
   For another reason, Paramount wasn't welcomed warmly on the
convention floor. Its decision to sell copies of ``The Hunt for Red
October'' at a retail price of $99.95 _ instead of the traditional
$89.95 or less _ means that many store owners may have to raise
their rental fees or see their profit margins narrow.

   Adding yet another theory to the bulging file on
the assassination of John F. Kennedy, an unemployed Texas salesman
on Monday claimed his father was one of three people who killed the
president.
   Ricky Don White contends his father joined the Dallas police
department in September 1963 to carry out the assassination. He
said his father, Roscoe White, was one of three CIA operatives who
fired the shots.
   The CIA issued an unusually strong rebuttal to White's claims.
   ``These allegations _ that this was done on CIA orders, that
this guy worked for us and that CIA had any role in the
assassination of President Kennedy _ are ludicrous,'' CIA spokesman
Mark Mansfield said in Washington.
   Roscoe White never worked for the CIA, Mansfield said.
``Normally, we never confirm nor deny employment, but these
allegations are so outrageous that we felt it necessary and
appropriate to respond,'' he said.
   The FBI said in a brief statement that it had received the same
information in 1988 but ``determined that this information is not
credible.''
   The Warren Commission concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald, acting
alone, fired the shots that killed Kennedy and wounded John
Connally, then the Texas governor, on Nov. 22, 1963 in Dallas.
Despite the commission's findings, conspiracy theories have
abounded since the assassination.
   Ricky White said at a news conference that his father also
killed Dallas police officer J.D. Tippit about an hour after the
assassination. Tippit's killing has been blamed on Oswald.
   White said his father served in the Marines with Oswald, who he
said also was part of the conspiracy but fired no shots.
   Roscoe White died in 1971 from burns suffered in a fire.
   Ricky White, 29, is a former oil equipment salesman from
Midland. He made his claims during a news conference at the JFK
Assassination Information Center, a privately run group that
researches various assassination theories. White acknowledged he
has tried to sell a book or movie on his theory.
   White said he drew his conclusions from what he read in his
father's diary and from his parents' discussion with a minister.
   White said he got the diary after his father's death and never
showed it to anyone. He said the diary disappeared after he talked
to the FBI about his theory in 1988.
   White said his father referred to himself in the diary by a CIA
code name of ``Mandarin'' and to two other CIA operatives _
``Lebanon'' and ``Saul.'' White claimed his father was on a grassy
knoll in front of the presidential caravan and fired two shots that
struck Kennedy, according to the diary.

<HEAD>U.N. Sanctions Aim at Crippling Iraqi Oil Exports, Forcing
Withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY CHENAULT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. Security Council on Monday
imposed broad sanctions against Iraq for invading Kuwait, including
a ban on trade aimed at cutting off the Middle Eastern nation's oil
trade and arms supplies.
   The 15-member council voted 13-0 to adopt a U.S.-crafted
resolution calling for the measures in an effort to force Iraq to
unconditionally withdraw its troops from Kuwait. Yemen, the
council's only Arab member, and Cuba abstained.
   The resolution, which was sponsored by 10 council members, said
the Security Council is ``determined to bring the invasion and
occupation of Kuwait by Iraq to an end and to restore the
sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Kuwait.''
   The measure, which takes effect immediately, bans all imports
from Iraq and Kuwait. It also prohibits any activities, including
the transfer of funds, that would help Iraq and Kuwait export their
goods and forbids loans to the two countries.
   If successfully enforced, the sanctions could cripple the
oil-dependent Iraqi economy. Its sweeping provisions would in
effect bar U.N. members from importing Iraqi oil, and oblige Turkey
and Saudi Arabia to shut down Iraqi oil pipelines running through
their territory.
   The Iraqis, fast losing customers for their oil, stopped pumping
petroleum on Monday through one of their two pipelines that run
through Turkey to the Mediterranean. They reduced the flow in a
second pipeline there.
   Turkish President Turgut Ozal, in an interview with ABC News,
had indicated that Turkey would close down the pipeline completely
once the Security Council adopted the sanctions resolution. ``We
will obey the U.N. embargo,'' Ozal said.
   The resolution also bans the sale or supply of any commodities
or products to Iraq and Kuwait, which would include weapons and
military supplies.
   The only exceptions to the trade embargo under the resolution
were for such items as food and medical supplies ``in special
humanitarian circumstances.''
   President Bush praised the council's decision and called for
``full and total implementation of these sanctions, ruling out
nothing at all.''
   He told reporters at the White House: ``These sanctions must be
enforced.''
   It was only the third time in its 45-year existence that the
world body had voted sanctions against a member state. In 1967, the
Security Council voted similar, comprehensive sanctions against the
white minority government of Rhodesia. A mandatory U.N. arms
embargo against South Africa, approved in 1977, is still in effect.
   The sanctions are legally binding on all U.N. members, although
past council resolutions have often been ignored or flouted. The
United Nations has no enforcement mechanism but later could call on
members to take military action against Iraq or impose a blockade.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, speaking to reporters
at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, said Britain and its
allies will consider a naval blockade of Iraq if the U.N. sanctions
prove ineffective.
   The vote followed similar sanctions imposed on Iraq by much of
the West, including the United States, Japan and the European
Community. The Soviet Union and China said they would halt arms
shipments to Iraq.
   At Monday's council session, U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering
accused Iraqi President Saddam Hussein of plunging ``into crisis
the strategically critical area of the Persian Gulf.''
   ``Iraq must learn that its disregard for international law will
have crippling political and economic costs, including but not
limited to arms cutoffs,'' Pickering said.
   Iraqi Ambassador Abdul al-Anbari denounced the sanctions and
accused the United States of pressuring other countries to take
action against Iraq.
   ``One superpower is trying to use the U.N. and the Security
Council to realize its objectives, as if the Security Council was
simply its foreign ministry,'' he said.
   The Iraqi ambassador said the sanctions resolution would only
exacerbate the crisis and impede Iraqi troop withdrawals from
Kuwait, which Baghdad says have already begun. The United States
has disputed Iraq's claims about the troop withdrawal.
   Before the vote, Kuwait's Ambassador Mohammad Abulhasan called
the invasion a threat to international security and said strong
U.N. action was needed to protect small nations against aggression.
   ``You are representing the conscience of the world.'' he told
the council. ``Now it is your responsibility by proving to the
whole world that the security of nations, be it big ones or small,
is not a commodity for sale, or for terrorism or for threats.''
   Security Council members had been discussing possible sanctions
for days after passing a resolution condemning Iraq on Thursday,
just hours after Iraqi troops moved into Kuwait.
   The council includes the five permanent members with veto power:
the United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain and France. The 10
non-permanent members are: Canada, Colombia, Cuba, Ethiopia,
Finland, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Romania, Yemen and Zaire.

   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
Monday that Britain and its allies will have to consider mounting a
naval blockade of the Persian Gulf if United Nations sanctions
against Iraq prove ineffective.
   Britain, she said, had ordered two frigates to join its two-ship
Persian Gulf patrol.
   Mrs. Thatcher said she was heartened by the overwhelming vote by
which the U.N. Security Council adopted a comprehensive ban on
trade with Iraq and Kuwait, and expressed confidence that the
sanctions will work.
   Mrs. Thatcher spoke after meeting with President Bush on her way
home from a Colorado vacation. She said the U.N. sanctions follow
``one of the most complete condemnations we have seen for a very
long time.''
   She said other past sanctions, including one against Rhodesia _
now the African nation of Zimbabwe _ could not be effective because
they did not have comprehensive backing by the world community.
   But she said the world clearly agrees that Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's military seizure of Kuwait is ``the act of an
aggressor that must be stopped.''
   Speaking of the U.N. sanctions, she said: ``I see great
determination and great perseverance that that resolution will
work.''
   Asked about the possibility of a naval blockade to reinforce
U.N. sanctions, the prime minister said the first priority is to
ensure that the sanctions are effective by themselves.
   But if Britain, the United States and the world community
concluded that a blockade was a vital next step, ``you would have
to consider'' such action, she said.
   She said Britain has one warship and an associated supply ship
already in the Persian Gulf and that two additional frigates, one
in Mombassa, Kenya and the other in Malaysia, will reach the gulf
by Sunday.
   ``If it comes to considering blockades, then of course we would
have to consider those,'' she said. ``If not, we will have to
consider joint action ... such as a blockade.''

<HEAD>Judge Rules Psychologist's Tapes Can Be Used in Murder Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Conversations between a psychologist
and two brothers after their parents were slain can be allowed as
evidence in the brothers' murder case, a judge ruled Monday.
   Superior Court Judge James Albracht said the psychologist, L.
Jerome Oziel, had believed Erik and Lyle Menendez made threats
during their psychotherapy sessions with him and it was necessary
to disclose their conversations to prevent danger.
   Albracht said that such a threat constitutes an exception to the
psychologist-patient privilege and the exception applies to all
taped conversations between the brothers and their therapist.
   The tapes of counseling sessions ``concern the brothers'
emotional and psychological state after the murder of their
parents,'' Albracht said.
   The brothers are charged with shooting to death their parents,
Jose and Kitty Menendez, in the family's Beverly Hills mansion last
Aug. 20.
   Prosecutors say the gruesome shotgun slayings were prompted by
the brothers' greedy hurry to collect their parents' $14 million
fortune. Jose Menendez was president of Live Entertainment, a video
production company.
   Erik, 19, and Lyle, 22, who have pleaded innocent, remain in
jail without bail. They could face the death penalty if convicted.
   The murders, in the heart of plush Beverly Hills, remained a
mystery for six months until police arrested the brothers. At one
point there were rumors Menendez and his wife were victims of a
Mafia execution.
   There was a stunned gasp in the courtroom from the Menendez
family as the judge announced his ruling.
   The grandmother, aunts and uncles of the defendants have
attended all of the hearings. Erik and Lyle Menendez, clad in blue
jail uniforms, exchanged glances with their relatives as they were
led in and out of court.
   ``If the judge's ruling is upheld it brings a virtual end to the
psychotherapist-patient privilege,'' said defense attorney Leslie
Abramson.
   Albracht did not give the legal basis for his ruling and said he
would seal his written opinion until Aug. 15. He said defense
attorneys could seek an appeals court order before that to have the
decision sealed permanently.
   Defense lawyers, claiming the conversations are privileged, said
they would appeal to prevent the tapes from being used in the
brothers' prosecution.
   He said the law required that the tapes be kept confidential and
that even the prosecutors could not hear them or know what was in
them until the matter was resolved.
   The prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Elliott Alhadeff, said
he felt the tapes contained ``very important evidence, but it is
not crucial to the case.'' The judge said months of hearings on the
issue were exceptionally complex.
   Ms. Abramson said Albracht based his ruling on a recent court
decision that held that if a psychotherapist discusses a patient's
statements with someone else the privilege disappears.
   But other courts have held that the privilege belongs to the
patient, not the therapist, she said.
   ``The therapist cannot simply be a gossip or a liar _ which we
claim in this case _ to make the privilege disappear,'' she said.
``In my opinion, Dr. Oziel was less than credible with this court.''

   The tanks of a barge that spewed oil into the
Houston Ship Channel were cleaned Monday so the vessel can be cut
up and moved out of the way of ship traffic, and crews scooped up
oil patches that washed ashore.
   Two-way traffic can't resume in the Houston Ship Channel until
the barge is removed.
   An estimated 700,000 gallons of oil spilled into the vital
Galveston Bay on July 28 when a tanker collided with two barges in
the ship channel.
   Cleanup crews scoured the barge's emptied tanks Monday.
   ``We want to get whatever oil is on it, off of it. We don't want
to cut it open and have a mini-oil spill added to what we've
already got,'' Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer Rick Meidt said.
   The tanks also must be cleaned of oil because a spark from
cutting torches could set off an explosion, the Coast Guard said.
   The channel was open Monday to two-way barge traffic, but
deep-draft ships could only travel one way because the Coast Guard
is concerned their wakes could disrupt the salvage operations.
   A few heavy patches of oil remained to be cleaned up along the
shoreline and a light sheen floated about two miles into the bay.
   ``There's not much oil out there right now,'' Meidt said. ``The
heavier concentrations are just splotches here and there along the
shore.''
   ``I think that's good because the heavy stuff is right at the
shoreline where it can be collected by the vacuum trucks. The sheen
is more susceptible to natural breakdown,'' Meidt said. ``Most of
the oil that was in the water, that was visible, is gone. It's been
picked up by vacuum trucks.''
   The oil stained several beaches. Oil also seeped into some
marshes and collected around several residential docks, but
officials said it had not washed into additional marshes, breeding
grounds for much sea life.
   Crews used vacuum trucks again Monday to clean up the remaining
oil that has washed ashore.
   More than 316,000 gallons of an oil-and-water mixture has been
picked up so far, Meidt said.
   Crews also sprayed oil-gobbling microbes on an oil-tainted marsh
area south of Cedar Bayou, said Petty Officer Scott Campbell. The
microbes were sprayed on another marsh area Sunday and a beach last
week.
   The microbes, used in a process call bioremediation, reduce the
oil to a fatty emulsion that is eaten by marine life. When the oil
is gone, the microbes die.
   The cleanup is expected to last about a week, and the total cost
is estimated at $5 million, Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Greene said.

   An Air Force jet and a single-engine Cessna
collided Monday, sending the military aircraft plunging to the
ground in a fireball, authorities said.
   Two military crewmen ejected from the T-38 jet as the aircraft
collided shortly before 3 p.m.
   The crewmen, whom the Air Force identified as as 2nd Lt. James
Kline, 23, of Freemont, Ohio, and 1st Lt. Steven Perlman, 25, of
East Chester, N.Y., were not seriously hurt, said Charles Metzger,
chief of the Sandy Oaks Volunteer Fire Department.
   A flight instructor and teen-ager in the private Cessna escaped
injury after the instructor landed the small plane, minus its front
nose section.
   ``All I saw was a fireball. Then I saw black smoke everywhere,''
said Metzger, who was at an intersection near the collision when it
occurred.
   The pilot of the T-38, based at Laughlin Air Force Base in Del
Rio, was making training approaches into Kelly Air Force Base in
San Antonio, said Bill Czervinske, a Federal Aviation
Administration manager.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Social Democrats, the
second-biggest party in both German states, demanded Monday that
the nations unite by mid-September, saying East Germany's social
and economic conditions are ``catastrophic.''
   Earlier in the day, German union leaders and the German Social
Union, a small East German archconservative party, also pushed for
quicker unification.
   The Christian Democrats of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere insist unity must
wait for united German elections that should be held Oct. 14.
   However, left-of-center Social Democratic leaders from both
nations _ in a joint three-hour meeting in Bonn _ set Sept. 15 as
their deadline for formal German unity.
   The East German Social Democrats backed off a threat to pull out
of de Maiziere's government this week over a disagreement on when
all-German elections should occur. But they could resurrect the
threat.
   Wolfgang Thierse, head of the East German Social Democrats, said
the party would seek a vote in the East German Parliament on
Wednesday that would set Sept. 15 as the deadline for unification.
   ``The coalition question is not the decisive one,'' said
Thierse. ``The decisive question is what can be done for the people
of the DDR (East Germany).''
   The conflict had threatened to break up de Maiziere's broad
coalition government and further fuel the political, economic and
social upheaval in the young democratic nation.
   Oskar Lafontaine, the West German Social Democrats' candidate
for chancellor, said a ``catastrophic situation'' has developed in
East Germany.
   He told reporters the best way to rescue East Germans is forging
unity ``as quickly as possible.''
   Lafontaine said quickly joining East Germany to West Germany
would make Kohl's government ``responsible for the DDR'' and for
what the Social Democrats say are mistakes by Kohl that have led up
to East Germany's problems.
   ``The federal chancellor has nothing else on his mind but
becoming chancellor of all Germany. But that is not the question,''
said Lafontaine, adding the important task is to worry about the
welfare of all Germans.
   At the heart of the debate is an intense political struggle by
parties jockeying to use unification to their political advantage
in united German elections.
   It is up to East Germany to enact unification. That will be done
when its Parliament approves a clause in the West German
constitution allowing it to join its bigger neighbor.
   The Social Democrats began pressing for quick unification last
week after Kohl and de Maiziere called for united German elections
to be moved up from Dec. 2 to Oct. 14.
   The Social Democrats believe voters will start turning against
Kohl as conditions in East Germany worsen, and therefore see a
later election date _ but early unification _ as their best chance
to defeat him.
   The two German Social Democratic parties are closely allied.
They are the leading opposition in West Germany and the
second-largest faction in de Maiziere's strife-ridden coalition.
   Kohl's Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats seemed to be
moving toward a compromise on an election date.
   Social Democrats said holding all-German elections on Nov. 18 is
one possibility. Kohl is to meet with leaders of the West German
Social Democrats on Tuesday in Bonn to discuss their disagreements.
   But a spokesman for Kohl, Dieter Vogel, said the chancellor was
not ready to accept any compromise on the election date. ``The
chancellor assumes the date will be Oct. 14,'' said Vogel.
   The head of the German Trade Union, the largest labor
association in West Germany with more than 8 million members, also
pressed for immediate unity.
   Labor association chief Heinz-Werner Meyer said the July 1
economic unification of the Germanys _ when East Germany made a
virtual overnight transition from socialism to a free market _
happened too quickly and will have disastrous effects.
   IG Metall, a West German metal workers union and West Germany's
largest individual labor union, also called for immediate unity.

   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
met King Fahd on Monday to discuss defense strategy for Saudi
Arabia against a possible attack by Iraqi troops deployed along its
border with Kuwait. Residents reported increased military activity
here.
   In Iraq, President Saddam Hussein told the U.S. charge
d'affaires he had no plans to invade Saudi Arabia and said the
United States was fabricating reports about troop buildups to
justify an attack on Iraq. Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait on Thursday.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said,
``The defense of Saudi Arabia is of paramount concern.'' He said
Cheney was in Jiddah to discuss the possible Iraqi threat and
``appropriate ways to defend'' Saudi Arabia.
   One U.S. military official, requesting anonymity, said Cheney's
talks with the Saudis are crucial to U.S. hopes of halting further
Iraqi aggression. The official said it would be impossible to carry
out a major air strike in the Persian Gulf without overflight or
landing rights from friendly nations in the region.
   Cheney's talks with the Saudis centered on direct U.S.
assistance in the event of a full-scale Iraqi invasion, as well as
options for possible U.S.-Saudi military cooperation.
   Cheney was also to confer with Prince Sultan, Saudi defense
minister, and other senior officials. With Cheny were Lt. Gen. H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, chief of the U.S. Middle East force known as
the Central Command; Richard Gates, deputy national security
adviser; and Paul Wolfowitz, deputy defense secretary.
   Saudi TV showed segments of the meeting but gave no details. The
foreign ministers of the small Arab states around the Persian Gulf
were to meet Tuesday in Jiddah, but it was not confirmed they would
meet with Cheney.
   Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, also came to Jiddah on Monday following his talks
with Saddam in Baghdad and with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in
Alexandria.
   The PLO and Libya said they were pursuing a joint peace plan but
released no details.
   Cairo papers briefly referred to that plan as having four
points: Iraq would withdraw; Iraq would receive economic aid; the
Kuwaiti people alone must choose their government; and Egypt, Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Iraq and Yemen would
create an Arab force to protect Persian Gulf waterways and
coordinate passage through them.
   The United Nations voted on Monday to impose sweeping sanctions
on Iraq, which invaded Kuwait early Thursday.
   The official Saudi Press Agency denied reports that the kingdom
called a general mobilization and was reinforcing its military
along the borders.
   But witnesses reported intense air activity overnight near the
airport area in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Oil executives at
Khafji, reached by telephone from Bahrain, said the Saudis were
bolstering their forces near the Kuwait border.
   Residents speaking on condition of anonymity said the
deployments were a precaution to defend oilfields run by the
Arabian Oil Co., a consortium of Saudi, Kuwait and Japanese
companies.
   ``It's calm down here,'' said one Japanese oil executive.
``There is no shooting anywhere ... But the Saudis are reinforcing
their defenses.''
   Khafji is a small city in northeastern Saudi Arabia on the gulf.
Its port has oil loading and berthing facilities for small tankers
and freighters.
   Travelers from the area said Saudi tanks were sighted moving
northward on Saturday, possibly to areas near Khafji.
   An American technician who returned Sunday from Saudi Arabia
said in New York that the kingdom deployed 200 to 300 tanks toward
its border with Kuwait; moved families of American civilian
employees at a Saudi military base in the northern desert to
Riyadh, and put ``all others ... on notice to evacuate.''
   He spoke on condition that he not be identified.
   Reports reaching Bahrain indicated that parts of the Iraqi
invasion forces in Kuwait have been moving in the direction of
Khafji and were deploying at points about 15 miles from the oil
region.
   They reinforced Iraqi troops who set up a checkpoint on the
second night of the invasion about half a mile from the Saudi
border checkpoint at Khafji.
   The border was closed.
   Gulf-based diplomatic sources, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said no indications surfaced of any significant crossing
of Iraqi forces into Saudi territory.
   They said Saudi forces went on alert with the start of Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
   Security officials at the Khafji post in the Divided Zone said
Iraqi troops were making minor incursions into Saudi territory and
then ``politely'' retreating with apologies.
   Kuwait's borders with Saudi Arabia run halfway through the
so-called Divided Zone, a new name for what used to be called the
Neutral Zone.
   Under a 1988 agreement, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait agreed to draw
their border through the Neutral Zone, but to share the revenues of
the oil field that straddles it.

   The Justice Department said Monday it would

gasoline price run-up _ and it's looking for them.
   The Energy Department, meanwhile, noted that consumers could
reduce pressure on prices by conservation.
   A joint statement by the Justice, Energy and Transportation
departments ``expressed concern'' over sharp increases in petroleum
prices that saw average gasoline pump prices rise by about 10
percent since Thursday, according to an American Automobile
Association survey.
   ``We will look closely for any indication that these increases
may be the reult of anti-competitive activity,'' said James F.
Rill, assistant attorney general in charge of the anti-trust
division, according to the statement.
   Such activity ``will be met with vigorous anti-trust
prosecution,'' he said.
   W. Henson Moore, deputy energy secretary, said his department's
Energy Information Administration `is monitoring the commerical oil
market hourly to track any sharp fluctuations in the marketplace,''
and would share its findings with the Justice Department.
   ``The domestic and international markets are reacting, as one
would expect, to uncertainty about future petroleum supplies,''
Moore said. ``While this reaction is normal, the fact remains that
oil stocks, at home and abroad, are at record high elevls. We
believe that the oil industry should not be carried away by
speculation about future events.''
   Moore also said, ``Consumer efforts to conserve can contribute
to reducing immediate demand pressures.''
   ``We just do not understand the basis for the price increases
seen in the last several days,'' Transportation Secretary Samual
Skinner told the American Bar Association's annual convention in
Chicago.
   The statement quoted him as urging transportation companies
``not to overreact.''
   Several airlines have raised ticket prices on their grounds
their fuel costs suddenly were rising out of control
   The early evening three-department statement followed a day of
congressional outcry and hasty scheduling of hearings for Tuesday.
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., said oil companies have gone on ``a
feeding frenzy'' despite near-record oil stocks. ``The oil
companies are playing the old game, heads they win, tails you
lose,'' he said.
   Bryan scheduled a hearing before the Senate Commerce consumer
subcommittee. Rep. Philip Sharp, D-Ind., called a similar session
before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on energy and
power he chairs.
   Sharp also called on Bush, in cooperation with allies, to dampen
price increases by releasing crude oil from the 90-day emergency
supply stored by the government in Louisiana and Texas.
   ``The Strategic Petroleum Reserve has to be used to make sure
shortages don't show up ... to short the market and protect the
consumer,'' said Sharp.
   Moore last week ruled out such a course, saying the reserve was
not meant to dampen price fluctuations.
   Seventeen senators signed a letter circulated by Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., asking Bush to establish an Emergency Oil Price
Task Force to focus public scrutiny on the industry.

<HEAD>Iraq Stops Oil Flow Through One Turkish Pipeline, Reduces Another</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iraq stopped pumping oil on Monday to one
of two pipelines running through Turkey and reduced crude running
through the other as a world embargo shrank the Iraqi market.
   The United Nations voted to clamp an embargo on Iraqi and
Kuwaiti oil as part of broad sanctions to punish Iraq for its
invasion of Kuwait. President Turgut Ozal, in an interview with ABC
News, had indicated earlier that Turkey would stop transporting
Iranian oil if the Security Council adopted the sanctions.
   ``We will obey the U.N. embargo,'' Ozal said to ABC news.
   One Turkish government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Iraq's decision to curtail oil on its own came as
``a great relief.''
   Even before the U.N. sanctioons, the United States had been
pressuring Turkey to cut off the pipeline flow.
   The White House announced that U.S. Secretary of State James A.
Baker III will travel to Turkey, a member of NATO, this week for
consultations on the crisis set off by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on
Thursday.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran also was sending a special
emissary to Ankara for similar talks, Ozal's office said.
   Vural Oktay, director of the state-run Turkish pipeline company
BOTAS, said pumping stopped at one pipeline at 6 p.m. Iraq reduced
flow in the second, larger pipeline to 70 percent of capacity, he
told reporters.
   The United States, the 12-nation European Community and Japan
were among countries that had earlier imposed an embargo on Iraqi
oil purchases.
   They said that before Iraq's decision was announced, a Norwegian
tanker waiting at the terminal to load crude for Britain sailed
away empty.
   Iraq acted a day after a high-level envoy of President Saddam
Hussein visited Turkey and talked with Ozal and Prime Minister
Yildirim Akbulut.
   Asked if the official mentioned the plan for oil reduction,
Akbulut told reporters Monday: ``He said they had some measures
they were planning to take and it appears this was one of them.''
Akbulut did not elaborate.
   In the talks Sunday, Turkey demanded Iraq's unconditional
withdrawal from Kuwait and reinstatement of Kuwait's deposed rulers.
   On Monday, Foreign Minister Ali Bozer again asked Iraq to heed
world reaction and restore Kuwait's sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
   The two pipelines run parallel for 620 miles from oilfields in
northern Iraq to a terminal in Yumurtalik on the Mediterranean.
   Iraq's daily output is reportedly 2.7 million barrels, of which
1.5 million barrels would flow through Turkey. Now only about half
that amount will be pumped through the Turkish connection, a BOTAS
official reported, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The shutdown of Kuwait's oil export facilities followed by the
reduction in Iraqi output is expected to cause a shortfall in the
world market of at least 4 million barrels daily, oil experts have
said.
   Turkey will have no problems, the BOTAS chief said Monday,
because it had completed most of its purchases from Iraq this year
and has another part in storage tanks at the terminal.
   Turkey purchased 60 percent of its oil imports from Iraq last
year. This year Turks, diversifying their oil sources, reduced the
Iraqi share to 40 percent.

   A force of 2,500 Marines are shipping
out to relieve another Marine unit off war-torn Liberia's coast,
military officials said Monday, denying reports the troops were
headed for the Persian Gulf.
   Meanwhile, troops at the Army's Fort Bragg rapid deployment base
have been put on alert.
   And a carrier battle group is scheduled to leave Atlantic ports
on Tuesday for the Mediterranean in a deployment planned before the
Iraqi invasion.said Lt.j.g. Cate Mueller, a spokeswoman for the
Navy's Atlantic Fleet.
   The battle group of nine ships, including the aircraft carrier
Saratoga, and 11,500 sailors is to sail Tuesday from Norfolk and
Mayport, Fla., Mueller said. Four air squadrons from Virginia Beach
will join the carrier off the coast.
   The 2,500 Marines from Camp Lejeune and the New River Air
Station, including a helicopter squadron, are to depart Morehead
City at noon Tuesday aboard ships of Amphibious Squadron 2, said
1st Lt. Colleen Ryan, a spokeswoman.
   The movement is not related to the crisis stemming from Iraq's
invasion Thursday of the Persian Gulf nation of Kuwait, she said.
   The unit is scheduled for a six-month deployment in the
Mediterranean, but will first replace a 2,200-member Marine unit
from Lejeune and New River operating from a flotilla off the
Liberian coast, Ryan said.
   Two rebel factions have been fighting the government of Liberian
President Samuel K. Doe.
   Rebels on Monday seized 14 or 15 foreigners, including one
American, and moved them to an insurgent headquarters outside the
Liberian capital of Monrovia, the State Department announced.
   Early Sunday, a force of 225 Marines from the 2,200-member unit
landed in Monrovia, and began evacuating Americans and other
foreigners.
   The five ships of Amphibious Squadron 2 _ the USS Nashville, USS
Inchon, USS Whidbey Island, USS Fairfax County and USS Newport _
left Norfolk, Va., on Monday morning for Morehead City, the
Atlantic Fleet's Mueller said.
   Meanwhile, spokesmen at Fort Bragg and the Defense Department
refused to comment on speculation that forces were being massed for
possible use in the gulf region.
   Some Fort Bragg soldiers said units at their base have been on
standby.
   Pfc. Cheryl Curtis of the 17th Military Intelligence Company
said her unit has been on one-hour recall since Friday afternoon,
meaning soldiers have one hour to report to duty stations if called.
   Members of the 82nd Airborne Division also were on one-hour
recall, said Spec. David Lykens of the military intelligence
company.

   Tropical Storm Diana slowed and picked up some
strength in the Gulf of Mexico on Monday after soaking the Yucatan
Peninsula but doing little damage.
   The government of Mexico late Monday afternoon issued a
hurricane watch for the coast from Boca Jesus Maria south to
Tuxpan, according to the National Hurricane Center in suburban
Coral Gables. Small craft were warned to remain in port from Baffin
Bay, Texas, southward.
   At 9 p.m. EDT, Diana was centered about 270 miles east-southeast
of Tampico, Mexico, near 20.7 degrees north latitude and 94 degrees
west longitude. Maximum winds had increased slightly to 65 mph, and
the storm was moving west at 12 mph.
   Gusty winds and heavy rains were expected along Mexico's Gulf
coast well in advance of the westward moving storm, said hurricane
specialist Bob Case.
   The storm hit the Yucatan at midafternoon Sunday about 70 miles
northeast of Chetumal and well south of the popular resort of
Cancun, causing only minor flooding.
   Meanwhile, tropical storm Cesar weakened to a tropical
depression Monday in the mid-Atlantic.
   At 6 p.m. EDT, the center of Cesar was located near latitude
27.0 north, longitude 46.5 west, or about 1,15o miles
east-southeast of Bermuda. It was west-northwest near 3 mph and was
expected to continue through noon Tuesday.
   Maximum sustained winds were near 35 mph.
   A new depression formed Monday about 175 miles southwest of the
westernmost Azores island, the hurricane center said.
   Tropical depressions become named storms if sustained winds hit
39 mph. They become hurricanes if the sustained winds hit 74 mph.

   Justice Thurgood Marshall could not attend an
American Bar Association meeting Monday, but a former law clerk
stepped in and delivered Marshall's speech calling for better legal
protection for murder defendants.
   Marshall injured himself in fall in Chicago last week and was
forced to return to Washington for treatment.
   Karen Hastie Williams, a former clerk and Washington lawyer,
pinch-hit for the justice, delivering a speech in which Marshall
said steps must be taken to provide competent lawyers for those
facing execution if convicted.
   ``If not remedied, the scandalous state of our present system of
capital punishment will cast a pall of shame over our society for
years to come,'' he said. ``We cannot let it continue.''
   Marshall opposes the death penalty under all circumstances,
arguing it violates the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual
punishment.

   The U.N. Security Council on Monday ordered a worldwide embargo
on trade with Iraq to punish the Arab oil and military power for
its invasion of Kuwait. A defiant Iraqi leadership vowed to resist
the economic and military pressure being marshaled by the United
States.
   The Iraqi people ``cannot be frightened,'' Iraq's army commander
said.
   The Security Council vote, 13-0, came on a U.S.-sponsored
resolution and represented the first such total trade and arms
boycott by the United Nations in 23 years. Two members of the
15-nation council, Cuba and Yemen, abstained.
   If successfully enforced, the sanctions could cripple the
heavily oil-dependent Iraqi economy. In Washington, President Bush
declared, ``These sanctions will be enforced _ whatever it takes.''
   Britain's visiting Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said after
meeting with Bush that the West would have to consider a naval
blockade of the Persian Gulf if the U.N. sanctions proved
ineffective.
   The vote in New York came on the fifth day of a crisis
precipitated by the Iraqi army's blitzkrieg takeover of neighboring
Kuwait.
   In occupied Kuwait, meanwhile, Iraqi troops rounded up some
Americans, Britons and other foreigners Monday, but they appeared
to be in no danger, British officials said.
   Tension remained high along the Saudi Arabia-Kuwait border.
Saudi Arabian forces were reported moving northward into areas
close by Iraqi units in Kuwait. Diplomats in the Persian Gulf _ in
reports otherwise unconfirmed _ said U.S. rapid deployment units
had been dispatched to the Middle East.
   In other developments:
   _In Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
conferred with Saudi leaders about how to defend the oil kingdom
against any attack by Iraq. The White House said it was discussing
``military possibilities'' with Gulf states to stop Iraqi
aggression.
   _The U.S. aircraft carriers Independence near the Persian Gulf
and Eisenhower in the Mediterranean Sea moved within range to
launch warplanes to the gulf and as far as Iraqi targets, Pentagon
sources said.
   _Major stock markets worldwide plummeted again, worried that an
oil crisis could touch off a recession. Oil prices rose more than
10 percent Monday. Many motorists in the United States and
elsewhere were paying sharply higher prices for gasoline.
   Iraqi tanks and infantry poured into Kuwait on Thursday after
President Saddam Hussein complained that the Kuwaitis' violation of
OPEC production quotas had driven down world crude prices, lowering
Iraqi oil revenues. Saddam also accused Kuwait of stealing oil from
a border oilfield both countries claim. Together, Iraqi and Kuwaiti
output equals 9 percent of world daily oil production.
   The United States led the worldwide condemnation of the invasion
as a threat to international order, and mobilized world governments
to cut off oil and other business with Iraq.
   Bush says Iraq's ``naked aggression ... will not stand,'' and
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday that ``the
defense of Saudi Arabia is of paramount concern.''
   But Iraq defied the diplomatic, economic and military pressure.
   In Baghdad, President Saddam summoned the U.S. charge
d'affaires, Joseph Wilson, and ``warned against any act that might
endanger the region's peace and security,'' the official Iraqi news
agency reported.
   Iraqi army commander Saadi Mehdi Saleh was quoted by the Al-Iraq
newspaper as saying Americans ``should understand that the people
of the great leader Saddam Hussein cannot be frightened.''
   Members of Saddam's ruling Baath Party said preparations were
under way to evacuate all of Baghdad's 4 million people in case of
U.S. air attack. They also said the party distributed weapons to
tens of thousands of people throughout Iraq.
   State radio said Saddam had ordered formation of 11 new Iraqi
army divisions, adding 100,000 troops to his 1-million-man military
force, the strongest in the Arab world.
   Iraqi officials continued to dismiss suggestions Iraq has any
intention to strike against Saudi Arabia. But the vastly
outnumbered Saudi military was taking no chances.
   Oil executives in the northeastern Saudi city of Khafji, an
oil-loading port near the Kuwait border, said Saudi ground
reinforcements were moving into the area. The Iraqi invasion force
had set up a checkpoint just a half-mile from the border near
Khafji.
   In addition, Saudi military aircraft were sighted landing and
taking off at airfields on the fringes of Riyadh, the Saudi
capital, said local residents reached by telephone.
   Americans and Britons were among an estimated 366 people who
were rounded up from hotels in Kuwait city by Iraqi forces and put
aboard buses. They were apparently mostly passengers from a British
Airways flight stranded in Kuwait, a British Foreign Office
spokesman said. ``There is no evidence that they are in any way in
trouble,'' he said.
   The Iraqi move did not appear to involve foreigners who reside
in Kuwait, including about 3,000 Americans, the spokesman said.
   The State Department said 28 Americans were among those rounded
up and said Iraq would be held responsible for their safety.
   ``It's premature to call them hostages,'' spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said. Bush said Sunday he would ``do whatever is
necessary'' to protect American lives.
   The U.S. Navy was dispatching another carrier force, led by the
Saratoga, from the U.S. East Coast to the Mediterranean. A French
missile frigate was en route to the Gulf to join two French
warships already there.
   There was no immediate confirmation of diplomatic reports that
units of the U.S. Rapid Deployment Force, organized for crisis duty
in the Mideast, had been sent to the region.
   Meanwhile, Kuwait's ambassador to Britain said a resistance
force was being organized among Kuwaitis living abroad. ``We will
get back,'' Ambassador Ghazi Al-Rayes told reporters.

   The growing anti-Iraq economic embargo produced its first
results Monday, when Turkish officials reported that the Iraqis,
fast losing customers for their oil, stopped pumping petroleum
through one of two pipelines that cross Turkey, and reduced the
flow in the second.
   A total cutoff of Iraqi oil flow through Turkey and Saudi Arabia
``is key'' to squeezing Saddam's government economically, the
British foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, said in London.
   He said he believed the Saudis and Turks would take that step
once the U.N. Security Council ordered a total embargo.
   In an interview with ABC News before the embargo vote, Turkish
President Turgut Ozal indicated Turkey would close down the
pipeline completely if the U.N. sanctions were ordered. ``We will
obey the U.N. embargo,'' Ozal said.
   A flurry of diplomatic contacts continued among Middle Eastern
governments trying to defuse the explosive situation.
   Prime Minister Mudar Badran of Jordan, whose King Hussein is
trying to mediate a peaceful end to the crisis, arrived in Damascus
to discuss the impasse with Syrian leaders. Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat was in Saudi Arabia bearing a proposed peace plan
under which, Egyptian newspapers said, Iraq would withdraw from
Kuwait in exchange for Western financial aid.
   But more ominous notes also emerged. Iran's foreign minister,
Ali Akbar Velayati, delivered a letter to Syrian President Hafez
Assad from Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, and said upon
departing from Damascus, ``We cannot remain idle toward this
invasion.''
   Iran fought an eight-year war with the Iraqis in the 1980s, and
Syria has long quarreled with neighboring Iraq.

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mausoleum wall in one of the city's old
cemeteries collapsed under the battering of a violent storm,
scattering bricks and the contents of dozens of tombs across a
Garden District sidewalk.
   The storm Sunday night knocked out a 30-foot stretch of the
plastered wall in Lafayette Cemetery No. 1, across the street from
Commander's Palace, one of New Orleans' premier restaurants.
   A clutter of bricks, skulls, bones and coffins pieces cascaded
10 to 15 feet into the street, said Bret Clesi of Save Our
Cemeteries, a volunteer group that gives tours to raise money to
restore New Orlean cemeteries.
   ``Fortunately, the wall vaults really haven't been used in years
and years and years,'' Clesi said Monday.
   ``I would be surprised if there's been a burial in those wall
vaults in 50 years,'' he said. ``The size is different than modern
caskets, and many were not owned to begin with. The cemetery was
almost deserted by the 1950s.''
   The cemetery, a city-owned owned national historic landmark, was
opened in the early 1850s. Only three standing graveyards are
older, and all are owned by the Archdiocese of New Orleans, Clesi
said.
   The wall contains a honeycomb of about 1,000 vaults roughly big
enough to slide a coffin into. About 50 of the tombs were exposed
by the collapse. New Orleans, which is below sea level, buries its
dead above ground.
   Most of the vaults in the wall were used in the 19th century as
temporary rental space until a family tomb could be built or
opened, Clesi said.
   ``There was a sort of rule that tombs could not be opened within
a year and a day after the last burial,'' he said. ``So if someone
in a family died six months after a funeral, the family could rent
one of these vaults and use it as a receiving vehicle until the
tomb could be opened.''
   City officials attributed the damage to lightning. But Clesi
said he believed the wall was buckling before the storm pounded New
Orleans with rain and hail, knocked down tree branches around the
city and battered the air with nonstop thunder and lightning.
   ``I suspect they were water-soaked from the downpour. Vibration
from the thunder may have done it. ... I sort of doubt it was in
fine form and a bolt of terrific lightning sheared it away in one
stroke,'' he said.
   The marble headstones inside the cemetery were undamaged. And
there appeared little damage to the concrete and brick vaults
themselves.
   Only seven of the tombs were marked. The rest had been closed in
with plain marble tombstones in the 1960s and '70s, because the
original stones were broken past repair.
   The most recent burial date was 1914; the others were all in the
middle to late 19th century, including five family members who died
from 1848 to 1888.
   Save Our Cemeteries has been trying for five years to persuade
the city to turn over maintenance of the cemetery to the volunteer
group.

   The State Department said Monday it regards
Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's dismissal from office as
an internal matter, but Democrats in Congress called for sanctions
against that government.
   ``A constitutional change in government is an internal matter
for the people in Pakistan to decide,'' said State Department

development in Pakistan has been repeated many times.''
   Congress was in recess but several Democrats issued strong
statements and two, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., and Rep. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., sent President Bush letters urging suspension
of all economic and military aid to Pakistan under the U.S. law
applying to any democratically elected government ousted by
military coup or decree.
   ``In view of the armed forces' role in holding Ms. Bhutto under
house arrest and controlling state television and telephone
operations, I urge you to immediately suspend all economic and
military foreign aid to Pakistan,'' Mikulski wrote in her letter.

   Here are excerpts from the text of
a joint statement Tuesday by the South African government and the
African National Congress after talks on clearing the way for
constitutional negotiations. The ANC agreed to halt its armed
struggle against the white government:
   The Government and the ANC have held discussions at the
Presidency, Pretoria, today 6 August 1990.
   The meeting has instructed the Working Group (on political
offenses) to draw up a plan for the release of ANC-related
prisoners and the granting of indemnity to people in a phased
manner and to report before the end of August. In the interest of
moving as speedily as possible towards a negotiated peaceful
political settlement and in the context of the agreements reached,
the ANC announced that it was now suspending all armed actions with
immediate effect. As a result of this, no further armed actions and
related activities by the ANC and its military wing Umkonto We
Sizwe (Spear of the Nation) will take place.
   Both sides once more committed themselves to do everything in
their power to bring about a peaceful solution as quickly as
possible.
   Both delegations expressed serious concern about the general
level of violence, intimidation and unrest in the country,
especially in Natal. They agreed that in the context of the common
search for peace and stability, it was vital hat understanding
should grow among all sections of the South African population that
problems can and should be solved through negotiations. Both
parties committed themselves to undertake steps and measures to
promote and expedite the normalization and stabilization of the
situation in line with the spirit of mutual trust obtaining among
the leaders involved.
   The Government has undertaken to consider the lifting of the
State of Emergency in Natal as early as possible in the light of
positive consequences that should result from this accord.
   The government will continue reviewing security legislation and
its application in order to ensure free political activity and with
the view to introducing amending legislation at the next session of
Parliament. The Minister of Justice will issue a statement in this
regard.
   We are convinced that what we have agreed upon today can become
a milestone on the road to true peace and prosperity for our
country. In this we do not pretend to be the only parties involved
in the process of shaping the new South Africa. We know there are
other parties committed to peaceful progress. All of us can
henceforth walk that road in consultation and co-operation with
each other. We call upon all those who have not yet committed
themselves to peaceful negotiations to do so now.
   Against this background, the way is now open to proceed towards
negotiations on a new constitution.

   Panic over the Persian Gulf plunged the stock market in its
worst one-day dip in almost a year Monday, and gasoline station
owners, officials and consumer groups accused the major oil
companies of exploiting the crisis by jacking up prices.
   Oil prices soared to a five-year high, and stock markets were
shaken by panicky selling sparked by fears the consequences of the
crisis could topple the teetering U.S. economy into recession.
   The Dow Jones average fell 93.32 points to 2,716.34, its
steepest decline since Oct. 13, 1989, when the widely watched
market barometer fell 190.58 points. The Tokyo market fell sharply
for the third straight day upon opening Tuesday.
   Companies and some anlaysts attributed the soaring gasoline
price increases over the weekend to higher costs, fluctuations on
the frenetic oil markets and added demand during the summer driving
season.
   ``This whole damn thing stinks to high heaven,'' said Rocco
Gentilella, a Gulf service station operator in Freeport, N.Y. ``Why
are they able to get away with it by raising the price of gas the
way they have?''
   ``There's no shortage of crude oil, there's no shortage of
gasoline,'' said Lee Lauer, who heads a group of service station
dealers in Kansas and Missouri. ``It's just a thing the refiners
are doing to make extra profits.''
   Random checks of gas stations around the country showed gasoline
prices at the pump rising as much as 14 cents per gallon since Iraq
seized Kuwait on Thursday. Prices for home heating oil also have
risen sharply.
   The American Automobile Association said the average cost of
self-service unleaded gasoline increased 11.1 cents from last
Thursday to $1.186 per gallon, including a 7.1-cent jump over the
weekend.
   The Interstate Commerce Commission said the average price of
diesel fuel, based on a check of 16 stations nationwide, rose 8.6
cents to $1.186 per gallon Monday from last Tuesday.
   The American Trucking Associations, representing 4,000 motor
carriers and trucking organizations, asked the ICC for authority to
raise freight rates on one day's notice because of higher diesel
fuel prices. Increases normally are allowed only on seven days
notice.
   Pan American World Airways announced a 10 percent fare increase
on all its flights to offset rising jet fuel costs. Northwest
Airlines announced an $8 per ticket fuel surcharge on Friday.
   State officials in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York,
Texas, North Carolina, New Jersey and Pennsylvania said they would
investigate allegations of price gouging by oil companies. In
Washington, a House panel set a hearing Tuesday on the price jumps.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said his department
would gather information in the coming days about the rapid hikes.
   ``We just do not understand the basis for the price increases
seen in the last several days,'' Skinner told the American Bar
Association's annual convention in Chicago.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``It is not clear
that all of the increases that have been reported at the consumer
level are necessary.''
   Gas station owners say they have little influence over prices
set by gasoline distributors and refineries owned by the major oil
companies.
   They contend the oil companies shouldn't be increasing their
prices immediately because the higher-priced crude from the Middle
East can take up to 90 days to reach the refineries, and
theoretically the costs shouldn't be passed to consumers until then.
   Oil companies note that crude oil prices have shot up
drastically since last month and the Iraq invasion of Kuwait is
only the latest reason. Prices for the benchmark grade of crude
exceeded $28 a barrel Monday, vs. $16 a barrel in early July.
   It was the highest level for the West Texas Intermediate crude
grade since August 1985, when the price reached $28.08 per barrel.
   
   ``But retail prices have gone up much less,'' Texaco Inc.
spokeswoman Anita Larsen said. ``Refiners are not yet recovering in
the marketplace a significant portion of crude oil cost increases
that they've already incurred.''
   An embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil by the United States and
Europe has reduced world oil supplies and increased demand, raising
more pressure on prices. In addition, U.S. oil companies now
purchase large amounts of gasoline on ``spot'' markets for
immediate delivery, where prices can move rapidly.
   ``The marketplace is reacting to uncertainties in the near-term
supply situation resulting from the Iraqi invasion and the
sanctions,'' Exxon Corp. said in a statement.
   Industry officials said companies also are increasing the price
at the pump now to cover for higher cost of replacing crude oil in
the future if crude prices fall.
   ``This is not a major oil company phenomenon at all,'' said
energy industry analyst Trilby Lundberg. ``It is a general refining
capacity crunch in the summertime ... that ordinarily wouldn't hit
us this hard except for the invasion of Kuwait.''
   Citizen Action, a Washington consumer group claiming more than 1
million members, called the pump price increases ``blatant acts of
economic aggression'' by large companies ``profiteering at a time
of international tension.''

<HEAD>Hanford Tank Releases Hydrogen Gas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A radioactive waste storage tank that
officials at the Hanford nuclear reservation fear might explode
belched hydrogen gas, and the level of waste inside dropped,
officials said Monday.
   Workers had been preparing to take a sample of the tank's
contents but were waiting for the complex chemical reactions inside
to create a ``burp'' to vent off hydrogen, said Westinghouse
Hanford Co. spokesman Mike Berriochoa.
   Tank 101-SY, which is one of 177 tanks at Hanford containing
waste from the production of plutonium for hydrogen bombs, vented
at 5:30 a.m. Sunday, according to a company statement.
   No environmental contamination occurred, the company said. The
gas is released through filters that trap any radioactivity,
company officials have said.
   The venting caused waste in the 1 million-gallon tank to drop
from a depth of 416 inches to about 411 inches by Sunday evening,
and a slower decline continued, said Berriochoa.
   ``That's why we waited until after the burping, so we didn't
risk running into a hydrogen bubble,'' Berriochoa said.
   The tanks at the reservation in south-central Washington are
managed by Westinghouse for the Department of Energy.
   Earlier this year, Hanford officials said a buildup of hydrogen,
ammonia and nitrous oxide in 20 of the 177 tanks had the potential
to cause a fire or explosion.
   Efforts to reduce the danger have been stymied by a lack of
knowledge about the chemical reactions occurring inside the tanks.
   Last week, Ron Bliss, Westinghouse vice president for waste
management, said the company planned to insert a probe into tank
101-SY soon to gather waste samples that will take months to
analyze.
   Venting has been occurring about every eight weeks and dates
from 1979, Westinghouse said. The last venting occurred in April.
   Tank 101-SY is believed to contain the greatest hydrogen buildup
because it has the greatest fluctations in waste depth. Bliss has
suggested that might be the result of experiments in which large
amounts of liquid were removed from the tank in the late 1970s in
an effort to increase its storage capacity.
   Department officials have said the hydrogen buildup comes from
organic matter in the tanks decaying, leaving the gas trapped
beneath a hard crust on the surface of the waste.
   The double-walled tank has been under continuous scrutiny since
the hydrogen buildup problem was announced in March.
   ``The risk of ignition of the hydrogen is considered to be
low,'' Westinghouse repeated in its latest statement
   A critical report last week by the Energy Department's Advisory
Committee on Nuclear Facility Safety raised questions of whether
the risk of an explosion was as low as officials have contended.
   In a letter to Energy Secretary James Watkins, panel Chairman
John Ahearne declined to characterize the risk of an explosion
because of the lack of information. Ahearne said no one knows what
chemical combinations are in the tanks and that unreliable
temperature sensors may be misleading.

   The discovery of the bodies of two slain
Israeli teen-agers prompted hundreds of Jews to take to the streets
Monday, hurling rocks and yelling threats during anti-Arab riots.
At least 22 people were reported injured.
   Earlier in the day, search teams discovered the stabbed and
bound bodies of the two Israeli teen-age hitchhikers in a dry river
bed in Jerusalem. Police said they suspect the two were killed by
Arab nationalists.
   The riots that followed were the worst anti-Arab unrest since
spring 1989, when two Israeli soldiers were kidnapped and killed by
Arabs.
   Israel army radio estimated that 10,000 Jews were involved in
rioting around Jerusalem. Most of the anti-Arab attacks were
carried out by groups of dozens or hundreds, including many
teen-agers and women.
   Hundreds of angry Israelis _ some chanting ``Death to the
Arabs!'' _ blocked main highways in several Jerusalem
neighborhoods, hurling rocks and cinderblocks at Arab-owned cars.
   The rioting continued into the night with scattered
stone-throwing incidents and fist fights. Police bolstered forces
in the city and canceled all vacations, saying they viewed the
situation as an emergency.
   Police said 20 to 30 Arabs were injured, and a Jew was also
hurt. They said a police officer was injured in an attack by an
angry mob. Seven Israeli rioters were detained.
   Security forces clamped a curfew on one Palestinian village and
searched other villages near where the bodies of the teen-agers
were found, but there were no reports of arrests in the slayings.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir vowed that ``our hand will reach
these mean killers.''
   ``This cruel and evil murder ... is an expression of the deepest
hate and despair of criminals who wanted revenge because they
cannot kill all the people of Israel,'' Shamir added.
   Teen-age volunteers discovered the bodies of Ronen Karamani, 18,
and Lior Tubul, 17, in a dry river bed near the Jewish neighborhood
of Ramot in Arab east Jerusalem.
   Ramot is just inside the Jerusalem city limits and surrounded by
the West Bank villages of Beit Hanina and Beit Iksa.
   Both bodies had multiple stab wounds, National Police
Commissioner Yaacov Turner said.
   Tubul, who had a pink towel tied around his mouth, ran for about
70 yards after being stabbed, then collapsed and died, Turner said.
   Karamani, who had his hands tied behind his back, was pushed
after being stabbed. He fell and died.
   ``The way they were tied down, the way they were stabbed points
definitely to a political murder,'' Turner said. ``There was no
reason to think that these two normal, good teen-agers were
murdered for any criminal reason.''
   Tubul and Karamani were last seen Saturday evening on the
outskirts of Ramot. They had told friends they were headed to the
West Bank settlement Givat Zeev to visit girlfriends.
   Turner said this was the second time within a month that
hitchhiking Jewish teen-agers had been attacked. Late last month,
two Israeli youths said a Palestinian picked them up and tried to
kidnap them. The youths jumped out of the moving car.
   The slayings of Tubul and Karamani brought to 47 the number of
Israelis killed in the 31-month Palestinian uprising.
   A total of 725 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
and civilians during the uprising. In addition, 245 Palestinians
have been slain by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of helping
Israel.
   At least two buses and dozens of car window were smashed in the
anti-Arab rioting that followed the discovery of the bodies, police
said.
   In one case, demonstrators trapped and stoned a Palestinian bus,
forcing about 70 passengers to lie on the floor. One passenger
suffered a bloodied head. Police stood nearby but did not detain
anyone.
   In Beit Tzafafa, an Arab village in Jerusalem, a stone-throwing
melee broke out between a crowd of Jews and dozens of Arabs armed
with clubs and metal bars. Police said one Jewish woman was injured.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney held sensitive
talks with Saudi Arabian officials Monday about U.S. military
options for defending the oil-rich desert kingdom against a
possible blitzkrieg by Iraqi forces massed along its border with
Kuwait.
   The U.S. aircraft carrier Independence and its escort of a dozen
warships and supply vessels reached the Arabian Sea, putting the
naval battle group close enough to launch air strikes against Iraq
and other targets in the Persian Gulf.
   The Independence joined the carrier Eisenhower, cruising in the
eastern Mediterranean, in the Middle East to guard against the
possibility of expanded hostilities by Iraq, which seized Kuwait
last Thursday. A third U.S. carrier, the USS Saratoga, will leave
Mayport, Fla., on Tuesday for the Mediterranean.
   ``The defense of Saudi Arabia is of paramount concern,'' said
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, as Cheney began
conferring with Saudi officials after an overnight flight from
Washington to Jidda.
   ``Quite obviously, we are discussing a possible threat by Iraqi
forces directly to that country,'' Fitzwater said. ``... It's quite
clear that would involve appropriate ways to defend their country.''
   Added the White House spokesman: ``We have discussed military
possibilities and our abilities with all the countries in the
gulf.''
   Both Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada said after talks with President
Bush that a blockade might prove necessary to halt Iraq's oil trade.
   The Washington Post said in Tuesday editions that the Pentagon
had sent the White House a proposal for an international naval
force, including vessels from the Soviet Union, to be activated if
desired to enforce trade sanctions. A Pentagon spokesman, Air Force
Capt. Sam Grizzle, said he had no information on such a proposal.
   One U.S. military official, who spoke only on condition that he
not be identified, said Cheney's talks with the Saudis are crucial
to U.S. hopes of halting further aggression by Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
   The official said it would be difficult to carry out a major air
strike in the Persian Gulf without overflight or landing rights
from friendly nations in the region.
   Some assistance is available from Bahrain and Oman, he said, but
those gulf states are loathe to acknowledge cooperation with
Americans. Such cooperation enabled the reflagging of Kuwaiti
tankers and escorts by U.S. naval vessels during the height of the
eight-year war between Iraq and Iran.
   Both CBS and NBC said in their evening news broadcasts that
FB-111 bombers from U.S. bases in England were seen in Turkey, at
Incirlik air base some 425 miles from the Iraqi border. It was
these planes that bombed Libya in 1986.
   A Pentagon spokesman who was not identified told NBC it was
coincidence the planes were in Turkey. Asked about the reports,
Capt. Grizzle told The Associated Press, ``We do not discuss
operational movements or the alert status of forces, particularly
at a time like this.''
   Other Pentagon sources, however, said the Strategic Air Command
was conducting a world-wide exercise, ``Giant Warrior,'' announced
on July 15, and reports of U.S. bombers in unfamiliar places could
be expected.
   Cheney's talks with the Saudis centered on direct U.S.
assistance in the event of a full-scale Iraqi invasion, as well as
options for possible U.S.-Saudi military cooperation.
   Cheney accompanied by U.S. Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, who
commands U.S. forces in the Mideast; deputy national security
adviser Robert Gates, and Paul Wolfowitz, undersecretary of defense
for policy.
   Fitzwater described the situation in the Gulf as ``extremely
serious'' and there was no evidence Iraq had fulfilled its promise
to begin withdrawing its military forces from Kuwait on Sunday.
   Officially, the Pentagon would say only that the Independence
was operating in the Indian Ocean and was being escorted by eight
smaller warships and four support ships. Three additional support
craft loaded with fuel and food are shifting to the region to boost
U.S. supply lines, officials said.
   Carriers are outfitted with a range of F-A-18 Hornet jet
fighters, F-14 Tomcat attack aircraft, A-6E Intruder bombers and
specially outfitted KA-6D jet planes assigned to carry out airborne
refueling of fighters and bombers.
   Meanwhile, five Navy amphibious vessels headed for Camp LeJeune,
N.C., to pick up 2,100 Marines for a rendezvous with the Saratoga
in the Mediterranean.
   The battleship Wisconsin was scheduled to leave Norfolk, Va., on
Tuesday to join the Saratoga, which is expected to take at least a
week to reach its new duty station.
   Three other vessels will leave Norfolk on Tuesday for what an
Atlantic Fleet spokesman called ``previously scheduled
deployments'' with the battle group. Four air squadrons from
Virginia Beach will join the Saratoga.
   Altogether, the departing naval vessels will be carrying more
than 15,000 sailors and Marines.
   The Eisenhower and its 12 escort ships are steaming in the
eastern Mediterranean, Pentagon sources said, while the eight-ship
Middle East Task Force led by the command ship LaSalle remains in
the Persian Gulf.

<HEAD>Survey Says Patients Hurt by Restrictive Drug Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM McCALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health maintenance organizations are
risking patients' lives by cutting costs on prescription drugs,
according to a national survey of doctors commissioned by the
Oregon Medical Association.
   ``Cost is affecting quality. Quality is being sacrificed,'' said
Dr. Michael Graham, president of the Oregon Medical Association.
   The telephone survey of 700 physicians, including 200 in Oregon,
was conducted by the Gallup Organization in January and the results
were released Friday.
   Graham said Monday the survey of cardiologists, internists and
general practitioners showed they were concerned about limits on
the way they prescribe drugs.
   ``What it amounts to is the HMOs and other managed-care
organizations are restricting the choice of medications,'' Graham
said. ``It restricts the ability of the physician to prescribe
what's necessary.''
   Graham said nine doctors in the survey reported that a patient
had died because of cost-cutting practices by HMOs.
   ``I can't give you the details on those nine deaths,'' Graham
said, ``but the physicians felt that the restrictions or lack of
availability of a drug led to the death of the patient.''
   He also blamed those practices for slowing the recovery of
millions of Americans suffering from various health problems.
   Larry Freshnock, vice president of health care research for
Gallup, estimated drug prescription restrictions already may have
affected 2.7 million people, based on the survey.
   However, a spokesman for one of the largest HMOs in Oregon said
the medical association's claims were exaggerated.
   ``This could scare a lot of people,'' said Ron Morgan, spokesman
for Blue Cross of Oregon, which operates Health Maintenance of
Oregon.
   ``From our experience with these practices, we haven't seen any
problem with the quality of care,'' Morgan said. ``You have to
balance cost containment with finding a way to make drugs available
to everyone, but you just don't sacrifice quality of care.''
   Health maintenance organizations attempt to hold down medical
costs by paying doctors a fixed amount no matter how many services
they provide, rather than a fee for every service. Managers of HMOs
also try to hold down costs on medical equipment, supplies and
drugs by seeking the least expensive source.
   Among the restrictions opposed by doctors and cited in the study
were:
   _Therapeutic drug interchange, a policy that requires
pharmacists to substitute less expensive drugs when possible,
despite differences in chemical ingredients.
   _Prior authorization, which requires physicians affiliated with
HMOs or other managed-care plans to obtain approval before
prescribing certain drugs.
   _Step-care protocols, a practice that forces doctors to
prescribe drugs in a fixed order, using lower-priced drugs first
and more expensive or advanced drugs later.
   _Mandatory generic substitution, which requires pharmacies to
substitute chemically identical generic drugs for brandname drugs.
   Morgan said that therapeutic drug interchange is illegal for
outpatients in Oregon, and Health Maintenance of Oregon does not
use step-care protocols.
   Morgan also said the Blue Cross HMO does not have a mandatory
generic substitution policy and its formulary is only a recommended
list.
   Representatives of other state and national HMOs said they could
not comment on the survey because they had not seen it.
   The most common problem resulting from drug policies, according
to the study, was slower recovery from illness, followed by failure
of the drug to work. Other problems cited by doctors in the survey
were allergic reactions, heart problems, pain, nausea and
convulsions.
   ``I don't think they're trying to implicate any particular drug
or a particular class of drugs,'' Graham said. ``The main point of
the study is that we think that employers and companies should be
cautious about signing contracts with restrictive policies.''

<HEAD>Sri Lankan Military Says Tamil Separatists Kill 23 Villagers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Military officials said Monday that
Tamil militants shot and hacked to death 23 Moslem villagers in
eastern Sri Lanka in the second attack on the Moslem community in
three days.
   They said rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam raided
three adjoining villages in Ampara district on Sunday and rounded
up the villagers before killing them.
   No independent confirmation or rebel version of the government
account was available.
   Most communications were severed after the Tigers broke a
13-month truce on June 11 and resumed their 7-year-old war for
independence in Tamil-dominated territory in the north and east of
this Indian Ocean island nation.
   On Friday, gunmen stormed two mosques at Kattankudi village in
eastern coastal Batticaloa district and killed at least 140
worshipers, the government said. It blamed Tamil Tigers.
   The militants accuse the Moslems of siding with the
Sinhalese-dominated government. The Moslems say they are neutral.
   The officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said all the victims were farmers. Their bodies were dumped in
paddy fields, they said.
   Mohammad Ashroff, leader of the opposition Sri Lanka Moslem
Congress party, said, ``All the dead had their hands tied behind
their backs and were either shot or cut with swords.''
   The killings took place in Addalachena, Oluvil and Palamuna
villages, about 125 miles east of Colombo.
   In other fighting, at least 35 Tamil rebels and three government
security men were killed Sunday, the officials said.
   They said 12 rebels were killed when naval gunboats destroyed a
fiberglass dinghy trying to land on a beach of northwestern Mannar
town, and two more rebels were killed in the north in a landmine
explosion.
   Two policemen and a soldier were killed when rebels fired
mortars, rockets and small arms at a military-held fort in Jaffna
town, the officials said.
   Helicopter gunships straffed rebel positions, killing at least
21 guerrillas, they added.
   About 14,000 people have been killed since 1983 when Tamil
rebels took up arms, claiming they were discrimnated by the
majority Sinhalese in jobs, education and the use of Sinhala
language.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
Sinhalese make up roughly 75 percent, and Moslems 7 percent.

<HEAD>New Crossbred Owl Appears in Northwest Forests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEDFORD, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists in Oregon and Washington have
discovered two cases 600 miles apart in which a rare northern
spotted owl has bred with the more common and aggressive barred
owl, producing a new hybrid.
   Biologists don't know whether the crossbreeding is an isolated
quirk of nature or the first sign of evolution into a new owl
species.
   But the barred owl is a much hardier owl, and there have been
concerns that the growth in its range could threaten the survival
of the spotted owl, listed as a threatened species in June.
   The first ``sparred owl'' was confirmed about two weeks ago near
Mount Baker in the northern Cascade Range in Washington, said Eric
Forsman, who leads a U.S. Forest Service spotted owl research team.
   The second was confirmed Wednesday east of Medford in
southwestern Oregon.
   ``I don't know where it's going to lead us,'' Forsman said.
``Nobody does.''
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's designation of the spotted
owl as threatened cast doubt on the future of logging in old growth
forests, the bird's sole habitat.
   The barred owl appears similar to the spotted owl, except that
it is somewhat larger, has vertical bars on its chest instead of
brown and white spots and is paler. The more aggressive barred owl
can live in a variety of forest types.
   There are only about 2,000 known pairs of spotted owls. The
barred owl is common in the United States and Canada.
   Only in the past 15 or 20 years, however, has the barred owl
expanded its range south from British Columbia into Washington,
Oregon and Northern California, where the spotted owl lives.
   The barred owl's ability to thrive in logged areas of the
Pacific Northwest probably explains its invasion of the region,
biologists say.
   That ability, its aggressive behavior and similar prey make the
barred owl a competitor with the potential for cutting the spotted
owl population, a Fish and Wildlife Service review team said in its
recommendation to designate the spotted owl as threatened.
   Forsman alerted biologists two weeks ago to the first confirmed
hybrid, a male adult found by Washington state biologist Tom Hamer.
   ``A very strange looking bird!'' Forsman wrote. He said it
looked like a pale spotted owl, but weighed a little more than 1{
pounds, more than a male spotted owl.
   ``His call is intermediate between a barred and spotted owl. It
goes, `Hoo ... hoo-hoo ... hoooawww!'''
   The last note is characteristic of the barred owl, Forsman wrote.

<HEAD>Newsrooms Should Hire More Minority Journalists, Group Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers should hire minority journalists
to reflect the country's racial composition, the vice president of
the National Association of Black Journalists said.
   ``America is browner and tanner and is going to continue to be
in the future,'' said Denise Johnson at the association's annual
convention Aug. 2.
   Hiring rates for minorities have increased little in recent
years, according to a report by the American Society of Newspaper
Editors released at the convention.
   The report said that 4 percent of newsroom employees, including
reporters, editors, artists and photographers, were minorities in
1978, compared with 7.86 percent this year. Blacks now account for
4 percent of the newsroom population, the highest percentage among
all minority groups.
   ``If you look at the percentages and how slowly the industry has
moved to respond to a very rapidly changing population, the
progress isn't nearly as impressive,'' said Johnson, an editorial
writer and columnist for the Saint Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press.
   The report also said that 4 percent of newspapers across the
United States employ no minorities.
   ``Most institutions in this country are still pretty much
dominated by white middle-age males and I think the tendency on
their part is to look out over the staff of people they direct and
take under their wing a person who reminds them of themselves,''
Johnson said.
   Editors surveyed by the ASNE said the most frequent reasons for
not hiring more minorities include the lack of qualified journalism
graduates, poor starting salaries and a lack of commitment to
affirmative-action hiring.
   The study queried more than 300 newspaper editors, said
Cornelius Foote Jr., minority affairs director of the ASNE.
   On another front, Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder said negative
media focus on the private lives of black politicians does not mean
there is a white conspiracy against leading blacks.
   Recent stories, including those on the drug trial of Washington,
D.C., Mayor Marion Barry, only leave that impression, Wilder said.
Wilder himself has been the focus of stories saying he has used a
state helicopter to spend weekends with socialite Patricia Kluge.
   ``If I thought that there was a conspiracy, I couldn't exist,''
Wilder said. ``I couldn't have existed in the courtroom where,
being an African-American lawyer, I was asking for justice from a
jury that was all white and judges who were all white. But I found
justice.''
   Wilder called for journalists to go beyond problems of the black
community and focus on problems that blacks and whites have in
common.
   ``We do the public a disservice _ we limit our perspective _ if
we think of ourselves as `black' officials or as `black'
journalists,'' he said.

<HEAD>Paper Sues to Keep State Out of Labor Negotiations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Daily News filed suit Aug. 1 to
stop the state from intervening in contract negotiations between
the newspaper and its 10 unions.
   The lawsuit in Manhattan's federal court seeks to dissolve a
fact-finding panel appointed by state Labor Commissioner Thomas
Hartnett to help the two sides reach agreement.
   It also asks for a court order stopping the panel from taking
any immediate action in the labor negotiations.
   The unions, under the umbrella of the Allied Printing Trades
Council, requested the state board of inquiry because they said
they weren't getting a fair shake in the negotiations over
contracts that expired March 30.
   The Daily News said actions by the board of inquiry, which has
the power to subpoena witnesses and gather evidence, would cause
``substantial and irreparable harm'' to the newspaper.
   ``This action will exert governmental and public pressure on the
Daily News and the unions in an undue and unwarranted attempt to
coerce or otherwise improperly influence a resolution of the labor
dispute and negotiations,'' the lawsuit said.

<HEAD>Buffalo News, Guild Settle Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Buffalo News and the Newspaper Guild
reached tentative agreement on a new four-year contract calling for
5 percent pay raises each of the first three years. Talks on
economic issues would be reopened in the fourth year.
   Health insurance was the main issue in bargaining before the
Aug. 2 agreement. The News agreed to pay $300 for each employee
with individual coverage and $600 per employee with a family plan
into a special fund on Jan. 1.
   That fund will be drawn down over the next two years to cover
the employees' 20 percent share of any increase in health insurance
premiums, said Robert McCarthy, president of Local 26 of the
Newspaper Guild.
   A cost-saving ``cafeteria-style'' health plan will go into
effect in 1994 and any money left in the fund at that time will
revert to the Guild.
   Also in the contract are new provisions for job security for
non-editorial employees, family leave and a new section on
professional standards that covers such topics as libel suits and
dealings with confidential sources.
   The Guild represents nearly 400 of the News' 1,100 employees.
   The News is owned by Berkshire-Hathaway Inc. of Omaha, Neb.,
which is controlled by investor Warren Buffett, who also owns stock
in the Washington Post Co.

<HEAD>News Employees File Third Liability Lawsuit Against Computer
Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atex Inc. has been sued for a third time by news
employees who claim they were injured while using the computer
company's keyboard and video display terminals.
   A $210 million lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
claims Atex ``knew or should have foreseen'' that users of its
computer systems would develop repetitive strain injuries or
cumulative trauma disorders.
   The lawsuit said Atex failed to adequately warn workers of ``the
risks, dangers and harm'' resulting from exposure to its product.
   Two similar lawsuits against Atex were filed in June _ one by
eight journalists from five different organizations and the other
by four employees of Newsday and New York Newsday.
   The new lawsuit was brought by two employees of the New York
Daily News, Margaret Kleinman, a copy editor, and Joseph Bulfaro, a
supervisor; Kathy Sizemore, an assistant news editor at Newsday;
Domenica Trevor, a copy editor at American Banker; Darcy Reid
Trick, a reporter for USA Today, and Jennifer Paradis Hagar, a
typesetter at People Magazine.
   The husbands of three of the journalists also are plaintiffs,
saying they suffered ``loss of consortium, companionship, services,
society and support'' as result of their spouses' injuries.
   A call for comment to Atex was not immediately returned.
Previously, the company said it would not comment on pending
litigation.

<HEAD>Times Mirror Purchases 50 Percent of Spanish Daily</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Times Mirror Co. said it has agreed to
purchase 50 percent of La Opinion, one of the nation's largest
Spanish-language daily newspapers.
   Executives of Times Mirror, parent company of the Los Angeles
Times, and La Opinion said Aug. 2 that the two Los Angeles-based
newspapers will maintain separate staffs and operations. Terms of
the purchase were not disclosed.
   ``Through the partnership with the Times Mirror Co., we can
continue to strengthen the newspaper, expand its coverage and make
it even more relevant to the lives of our readers,'' said Jose
Lozano, La Opinion's publisher.
   The partnership is ``something that's been under consideration
for some time,'' said David Laventhol, president of Times Mirror
and publisher of the Times. ``The Latino community is an
increasingly important part of our readership.''
   Federal antitrust officials must review the agreement before it
is final.
   A board of directors will be formed to oversee the partnership,
with a majority of seats filled by representatives of La Opinion,
which is owned by Lozano Enterprises of California.
   The Spanish-language daily has been a family-controlled
operation since it was founded in 1926 by Lozano's grandfather. It
has a daily circulation of about 100,000.
   El Nuevo Herald of Miami, published by The Miami Herald, claims
a daily circulation of 102,000, and almost 118,000 on Sundays.
   The Times has a daily circulation of about 1.2 million and about
1.5 million on Sunday.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Says Newspaper Treated Him Unfairly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only black federal judge in the city
accused The Pittsburgh Press of being racist by trying to force him
from the bench.
   Senior U.S. District Judge Paul Simmons made the accusation
during a hearing July 26 in which he was asked by John Bingler,
attorney for the Press, to remove himself from a lawsuit against
the paper. The Pittsburgh Press obtained a copy of the transcript
of the 35-minute hearing.
   ``I think it's a case of pure racism, that's what I think,''
Simmons said during the hearing. ``The way I've been treated is
just scandalous by The Pittsburgh Press.''
   He criticized the newspaper and Bingler before agreeing to
remove himself from the case.
   Alan Frank, an attorney convicted of tax evasion and fleeing
Pittsburgh to avoid prosecution, filed the lawsuit in September
against the newspaper, Allegheny County police and a McKeesport
attorney. The lawsuit will be assigned to another judge.
   Frank charged in his suit that the newspaper libeled and defamed
him by conspiring with two county detectives to damage his
reputation by printing a false story that he stole money from his
son.
   In a motion, attorneys for the Press said the newspaper alleges
Simmons ``has a personal bias or prejudice against it due to
articles and editorials which it has published in the past.''
   The motion cited articles and editorials about the judge,
including an article in April in which he was quoted as accusing a
woman of being greedy and vengeful for suing her ex-husband in a
child-custody case.
   The local bar association filed a complaint in connection with
the comments. The Press published an editorial criticizing Simmons,
68, for the comments he made and suggested he retire.

<HEAD>`Doonesbury' Controversial Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some editors are taking a close look at
a ``Doonesbury'' comic strip in which a character clad in nothing
but rope utters provocative language.
   ``Frankly, it didn't offend me, but I'm thinking of all the
people out there,'' Jim Hughes, executive editor of the Baton Rouge
Morning Advocate@State Times, said Aug. 1.
   The strip by Gary Trudeau features the character J.J. giving her
rendition of ``performance art'' with a bucket over her head and
nothing but rope covering her privates.
   She speaks in fragmented sentences laced with words with sexual
connotations such as ``ooze,'' ``lubricate'' and ``hot juices,''
but makes no direct reference to sex acts. The strip is scheduled
for release from Aug. 6 to Aug. 11.
   ``The way I read it, it's an attempt to show the lengths that
the art community will go to thumb their noses at government
grants,'' said Jack Morrissey, an associate editor at Universal
Press Syndicate, which distributes the strip to about 1,000
newspapers.
   Morrissey said Trudeau appeared to be referring to controversy
over National Endowment of the Arts funding. Some conservative
politicians have tried to block government money going to artwork
they consider obscene.
   Morrissey said several editors had called with questions about
taste and the reason behind releasing the strip. But no paper
indicated that it would pull the comic, he said.

<HEAD>Newspapers Hail End of Most Censorship Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers that once trumpeted government
propaganda hailed the end of most censorship rules Aug. 1.
   ``Goodbye, censorship,'' read a headline in Izvestia about the
Soviet Union's first press freedom law, which guarantees broad
rights for journalists and potential publishers.
   ``Almost everything was forbidden, even mention of the existence
of (the censorship agency) Glavlit itself,'' said Izvestia, the
main government newspaper. ``The truth was the main secret.''
   Editors wrote that the guarantees won't stop attempts at
interference overnight. The government can still censor articles
construed as calling for the violent overthrow of the government,
promoting racial or religious intolerance, or publishing propaganda
for war, violence or cruelty.
   In addition, the shortage of newsprint and its increasing costs
could be a major barrier for independent publications.

<HEAD>Israel Denies Paying for Favorable Radio Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two journalists claim that some radio reporters
working free-lance for foreign stations accepted money or favors
from the Foreign Ministry.
   The gifts were said to be in exchange for pro-Israel stories
packaged as independent news items.
   The two, speaking July 30 on condition of anonymity, said the
free-lancers worked out of a Jerusalem recording studio that has
close ties with the ministry.
   The ministry denied the allegations, but said it suspended all
ties with the studio lest ``some aspects of the current
arrangements ... be misconstrued as involving a conflict of
interest.''
   The New York Times reported that ministry officials secretly
channeled money to the studio to pay the reporters' salaries. It
also said Israeli diplomats abroad helped the free-lance reporters
recruit radio clients in major locations.
   One Jerusalem-based radio reporter told The Associated Press the
ministry paid the studio fee of $75 per hour for some free-lance
reporters who otherwise would have to cover the expense themselves.
   In return, ``sometimes they (ministry officials) ask the
reporters to publish certain information,'' the reporter said.
   Another broadcast journalist said some colleagues working for
foreign stations accepted money from the ministry in exchange for
stories favorable to Israel packaged as independent news reports.
   The ministry said it has worked with the studio for years,
commissioning programs on current events and other subjects that
are distributed by Israeli embassies abroad.
   It said the programs were ``distributed by us and in our name.''
   The ministry claimed that it decided to suspend ties with the
studio on July 18 _ 10 days before it was first asked by The New
York Times about the relationship.

   The Editors Guild of India condemned
what it called growing intimidation by gun-toting militants
threating to kill editors who refuse to publish their statements.
   The guild said July 31 that newspaper editors in the state of
Punjab were forced at gunpoint to print the full text of a 21-page
letter by Sikh militants seeking independence from India.
   The statement also cited cases last year when gunmen killed an
unspecified number of newspaper vendors in Punjab for selling
papers hostile to the militant cause.
   Other cases of death threats were reported in Kashmir, where
Moslems are seeking to break away from the Indian federation, and
by separatists in the far eastern state of Assam.
   The guild, the smaller of two professional associations of
editors in India, represents about 100 newspapers.

<HEAD>TV Service Being Launched in Pediatrician's Waiting Rooms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A video program that lets advertisers reach
patients in doctor waiting rooms could be in 2,500 locations by the
end of the month, its director says.
   Healthlink Television debuted Aug. 1. The executive overseeing
it, David Moore, said TV sets and video disc players were placed in
100 pediatricians' offices in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
   Plans are to expand nationally to 5,000 doctors' offices by the
end of September and 20,000 by early 1991, he said.
   Doctors will be given a one-hour program on a laserdisc that is
to be played continuously on the TV system during the business day.
The program will focus on health care topics with up to nine
minutes of commercials _ each two to four minutes long _ per hour
between program segments.
   Healthlink Television is the first of two commercially-sponsored
video programs that are being produced for audiences in medical
waiting rooms.
   Healthlink is a subsidiary of Hearst-ABC-Viacom Entertainment
Services, a joint venture of Capital Cities-ABC Inc., the Hearst
Corp. and Viacom International Inc.
   The other video program is Special Reports Television, being
produced by Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn., and
debuting in October. Whittle is half-owned by the entertainment
giant Time Warner Inc.
   Both services are aimed principally at mothers visiting the
doctor either for themselves or with their children.
   They are the latest example of media vehicles developed to
enable advertisers to reach narrowly defined audiences. Similar
programming includes the Channel One news show for teens in the
classroom, programs for women at the beauty parlor and a news show
for shoppers in the grocery checkout line.

   Hiroshima came to a halt for a moment
today in observance of the world's first atom bomb attack, which
leveled this bustling coastal city 45 years ago.
   For an eery moment, the city fell silent, automobiles stopped
and people throughout this industrial center of one million
residents joined in a moment of prayer to comfort the souls of the
140,000 people who died frm the bomb.
   ``I pay my deep respects to the citizens of Hiroshima who have
built this city of international peace from the ashes,'' Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu said in an address to a crowd of 55,000 at a
commemoration ceremony.
   ``As the only country in the world to have experienced an atom
bomb attack, Japan has resolved not to let it be repeated with our
three non-nuclear principles and our calls for total nuclear
disarmament and everlasting peace.'' The United States dropped the
atom bomb on Hiroshima, a major military center, during World War
II, on August 6, 1945. The bomb wiped out nearly half the 300,000
people who lived in the city, killing most immediately. Many others
died within months from radiation, burns and other afflictions.

Wyoming.
   ``Wyoming touts the slogan that this is the Equality State. I'll

   The Air Force has spent hundreds of millions
of dollars on gold-plated chandeliers, golf course projects and
other luxuries to boost morale, internal Pentagon documents show.
   Back in 1985, the Air Force decided to refurbish its officers'
club at the Mildenhall base in Britain at a cost of $75,000. The
service's champagne taste, however, hardly matched the appropriated
amount.
   Gold-plated chandeliers valued at $145,000 were installed, solid
oak paneling lined the walls and fireplaces with marble fixtures
completed the decor. The final tally was more than $2 million with
U.S. taxpayers picking up the tab.
   The internal Air Force audits, conducted in April and May of
this year, reveal widespread waste and abuse in the Air Force
management of its Morale, Welfare and Recreation Activities.

<HEAD>Want Action on S&amp;L Mess? Start an Investigation</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When politicians face a problem issue with no
easy way out, their instincts often create an urge to investigate.
Or at least to demand an investigation.
   That way they are advocating action, even if it isn't a solution.
   That's happening now in the savings and loan mess.
   The bailout price is going up, the voters are getting angry, and
the only solution is to keep spending money Congress doesn't want
to appropriate and taxpayers don't want spent.
   But that is the unavoidable bill for decisions made a decade
ago, coming due in a congressional election year. So campaigning
incumbents are being forced into an unpopular position, and that
puts a premium on votes that seem to do something about it.
   Something like investigating, and supporting legislation to
impose stiff sentences on people convicted of savings and loan
crimes, with life terms for kingpins _ laws that can apply only to
future wrongdoing.
   As with punishments, so with payments. The past is not subject
to reform, and the costs _ estimated as high as $500 billion _
stretch on for years.
   The administration has alerted Congress that it will need more
money, probably about $100 billion, to pay for the savings and loan
bailout during the budget year that begins Oct. 1. That is
particularly uncomfortable timing, five weeks before congressional
elections, so it may be handled with a stopgap appropriation until
early 1991.
   That prospect produced a chorus of congressional complaints
about blank check spending. To which Robert R. Glauber, the
treasury official dealing with the S&amp;L crisis, replied that the
blank check was written long ago, when deposit insurance was
boosted to $100,000 an account.
   That was done by act of Congress in 1980, during the Carter
administration. Then, and in another measure enacted in 1982 and
signed by Ronald Reagan, the rules were changed to let savings and
loans make investments far more speculative than the home mortgages
that had been their business.
   With more insurance on deposits, and less regulation of a
savings and loan industry that already was having problems, the
meter started running up the costs the taxpayers face now.
   When insured institutions fold, depositors have to be paid. ``We
don't really have a choice,'' said L. William Seidman, the man in
charge of the bailout.
   But what can't be changed can be investigated.
   So the National Governors' Association adopted a resolution
urging an investigation of ``this unprecedented disaster'' by an
independent commission.
   A measure seeking a commission investigation has been proposed
in the Senate. The House approved creation of a million-dollar
bipartisan commission to investigate the S&amp;L mess, as part of a
bill to speed prosecution and stiffen punishments for S&amp;L crimes.
There were only four votes against it.
   The administration didn't like the idea, with a White House
spokesman saying there was no need for a new bureaucratic entity to
investigate. But after the overwhelming House vote, the
administration decided it would not oppose an investigation.
   That makes a commission investigation a virtual certainty,
satisfying the political urge to be seen doing something about the
S&amp;L mess before election time.
   A skeptical senator says the findings of an investigating
commission are predictable and he wonders about its value to the
taxpayers, but he'll vote for it anyhow. But Sen. Bob Kerrey,
D-Neb., said that is less important ``than knowing what is going on
today, right now,'' in a bailout he contends is being mismanaged.
   Investigations, some by commissions, some by Congress, can and
have served vital purposes.
   The Warren Commission did so after the assassination of John F.
Kennedy, even though conspiracy theorists still dispute its finding
that a lone gunman murdered the president in 1963.
   The Senate Watergate committee discovered the existence of the
White House tapes that sealed the case against Richard M. Nixon and
ultimately led him to resign the presidency in 1974.
   After the Challenger disaster of 1986, the Rogers Commission
conducted an inquiry that otherwise would have drawn contentions,
competing investigations in Congress.
   In the savings and loan debacle, said Gov. James R. Thompson of
Illinois, ``We already know the answer.'' Thompson opposed the
investigation the governors sought.
   He is not running for another term.

<HEAD>For Cold War Junkies, a Berlin Wall in Manchester</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nostalgic for Checkpoint Charlie?
Miss those snarling East German border guards? Cold War junkies,
despair not: The old days live on in Manchester.
   The real Berlin Wall may be vanishing, but its English replica,
complete with mock-nasty guards, stands firm for the tourists at
Granada TV Studios in the northwest city.
   When it went up two years ago to honor Granada's spy series
``Game Set and Match,'' based on the Len Deighton trilogy, its
architects never dreamed it soon would be old hat.
   ``We're keeping it as a piece of history,'' said Marina
Efstathiou, public relations officer for the 90-minute tour of
Granada's sets.
   The tour, similar to those which have been conducted for nearly
two decades at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, has attracted one
million visitors since it opened for business July 20, 1988.
   Granada's graffiti-smeared Berlin Wall hoves into view between
Sherlock Holmes' Baker Street and Coronation Street of British soap
opera fame. The Edwardian tram carrying 40 tourists stops, and the
atmosphere becomes bleak.
   Two men in Berlin border guard uniforms board the upper level of
the tram. One of them, tall and blond, demands my briefcase and
admonishes me for smiling.
   ``Don't laugh,'' he barks in German-accented English while his
companion, short and dark, glowers at his side. ``It will give you
wrinkles in later life.''
   Returning my briefcase, the two move on, and the tour resumes on
foot.
   Granada, which charges 6.95 pounds (about $12) for the tour, has
adapted the wall experience to keep pace with history. When the
Cold War was for real, there were guard dogs and tourists got
frisked. Now such niceties are reserved for corporate clients who
specially request them.
   ``We used to pick up dad and take him off the tram and children
would say, `Don't take my daddy away.' We would threaten to lock
people up,'' recalled Roy Stonehouse, the Yorkshireman who designed
the tour.
   After the wall opened, ``We toned it down, obviously,'' he said.
   Stonehouse said he tried to acknowledge the geopolitical change
by carving a hole in his wall after the real one opened last
November.
   ``It wasn't very successful,'' he said. ``It looked as if the
mice had been at it.''
   ``Game Set and Match,'' starring Ian Holm, was a 13-hour series
filmed partly at the real Berlin Wall and partly on a studio set.
It was the first time permission was given to film on location at
Checkpoint Charlie.
   The wall serves a practical purpose as well, screening off the
adjacent Science and Industry Museum whose visitors otherwise would
be able to gaze down at the Granada Tour for free.
   That unpleasant border guard turned out in an interview in the
replica Checkpoint Charlie hut to be Gareth Williams, 20, an
amiable college student.
   ``We've had one or two comments like, `It doesn't exist
anymore,' but there's nothing you can say to that,'' Williams
remarked during a break between tramloads of tourists.
   ``There's a lot of patriotism that comes out. People still get a
buzz out of it,'' said Terry Holm, 26, a drama student at the
Manchester Polytechnic theater school.
   ``It seems to me the public are here to be entertained
basically, aren't they?'' said Williams, whose mother is a Berliner.
   Visitors seemed to take this bit of history in stride.
   ``I can handle it,'' said Paul Russell, from Basingstoke near
London.
   ``I enjoyed it,'' said Irene MacPhee, a Canadian tourist from
Calgary, adding, ``I bet they've had to change their dialogue in
the last year.''
   And besides, imitation East German guards are nothing compared
with Granada's own security. ``Excuse me; what paper do you
represent? Who have you OK'd it with?'' snapped a Granada official,
who emerged out of nowhere to challenge a reporter taking notes.
   After explanations, her tone softened. ``We have to be very
careful because of press leaks,'' she said with a smile, and
vanished.

<TEXT>
   Ryoko Ishida is dead because she was a few seconds
late in slipping through the school gate.
   Television programs provide constant reminders of the tragedy by
showing the closing of the quarter-ton gate of the Kobe Takatsuka
High School, which crushed the 15-year-old's skull.
   Her death caused an outcry by critics who feel Japan's acclaimed
secondary education system is far too rigid. Parents and educators
generally defend the rules.
   Miss Ishida was killed July 6 by the school gate in Kobe, a port
city 270 miles west of Tokyo. A teacher, Toshihiko Hosoi, 39,
pushed the gate shut promptly at 8:30 a.m. to teach the children a
``lesson'' about promptness.
   Hosoi has been fired and charged with professional negligence
resulting in death. Other school and education officials have been
disciplined.
   Commentators and human rights groups blame the death on
overzealous application of strict rules.
   At a minimum, schools require students to wear uniforms. These
often are sailor-type dresses for girls and black Prussian-style
outfits for boys.
   Some prescribe white socks and even white underwear, crewcuts
for boys and pageboy haircuts for girls, with black hair bands.
   Students at many schools are not allowed to patronize coffee
shops or obtain drivers' licenses. Rules even describe exactly what
a student may bring to school and list what is banned, such as
playing cards and hair dryers.
   ``In some schools, if you go from your neighborhood to a
neighborhood where there is another high school, you have to bring
your high school identification card,'' said Seiji Fujii, a writer
whose frequently criticizes the rules.
   Enforcement usually is strict. Teachers patrol neighborhoods,
inspect students at the school gate as they arrive, and search book
bags and luggage.
   Punishment often ranges from humiliating to violent. Students
were buried in sand up to their necks in one recent case and
corporal punishment is widely practiced, although it has been
illegal since World War II ended.
   ``Teachers often slap, punch, kick,'' said Morikatsu Imahashi,
an opponent of corporal punishment who teaches at Ibaraki
University in Mito, 60 miles northeast of Tokyo.
   Imahashi demonstrated with his hands how teachers sometimes clap
their hands suddenly over students' ears. Fujii, the writer, said
the practice broke the eardrum of a friend.
   Five deaths from corporal punishment were reported in 1985-1987.
After a student's death in 1988, the Education Ministry advised
schools to ease their rules.
   A few students have filed lawsuits, including a Tokyo senior
expelled from a private high school for waving her hair, said
Yasuhiro Yoshimine, a lawyer active in children's rights issues.
   In Kobe, where about 30 percent of junior high and high school
boys are required to wear crewcuts, more than 3,000 names of
individuals and groups appeared in a March newspaper advertisment
against the rule.
   Rebellion can be costly. Adverse comments on obedience might
show up in the secret record that follows a student from grade
school and helps determine whether he or she will get into high
school or win a job recommendation.
   ``In Japan, if the parents insist on their rights, they will be
called strange, a problem,'' said Yoshimine, the lawyer. In Japan's
homogeneous society, being seen as different or a problem is a
major stigma.
   ``It can be tough,'' said Kurumi Tanabe, a 40-year-old mother
from the Mito area. ``I got many letters criticizing me, saying the
idea is bad, that I should have my son cut his hair.''
   Kentaro Tanabe, 14, is one of four in a 1,000-student middle
school who refuses to wear a crewcut.
   Some students crack under the strain. Newspapers occasionally
carry reports of students beating their teachers, and many who
refuse to attend school blame strict rules.
   Strong regulations are popular with teachers and school
authorities. In a 1988 survey, 95 percent of middle-school teachers
responding agreed with the statement that ``disorderly attire is a
sign of mental disorder.''
   Atsuo Nomura, principal of Kobe Takatsuka told students after
Miss Ishida was killed: ``If all of you had woken up 10 minutes
earlier, the teacher would never have had to raise his voice. I
don't mean to put the responsibility on your side, but now I still
want all of you to improve your life habits.''
   Nomura later resigned.
   ``Parents generally believe stricter rules mean better
education,'' said Tetsuo Tsujimura, who directs the Education
Ministry's middle-school division and feels some rules are too
strict.
   Critics say tough school regulations and rigid curriculums
suffocate individual differences and hurt Japanese education.
   Strict rules were adopted by schools in the 19th century.
Enforcement eased in the 1960s, but tightened again in the early
1980s in response to unruliness among teen-agers.
   Yoshimine and others say the strict regulations reflect
authoritarian attitudes left over from prewar militarism.
   Since April, the Education Ministry has required schools to
display the national flag and play the unofficial national anthem,
both symbols of the prewar years, at entrance and graduation
ceremonies.
   News reports have linked rigid education with grisly crimes,
such as the case of four boys who kidnapped, raped and beat a high
school girl, then encased her body in a drum of concrete. At the
sentencing last month, their lawyer blamed an ``ailing society''
for the boys' actions.

   Imagine John, Paul and George making music
without Ringo. Ben, Little Joe, and Adam running the Ponderosa
without Hoss. The Cowardly Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow off
to see the Wizard without Dorothy.
   Unthinkable!
   Would we have loved the Beatles, the Cartwrights and the Oz gang
as trios? Perhaps. But author Harold Schechter, an expert on myths
in popular culture, thinks it's likely some of their magic would
have been lost.
   Quaternity, the mythic union of four characters into a single,
cohesive unit, often results in ``an invincible psychic totality,''
says Schechter, a professor of English at Queens College in New
York.
   Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung defined the special power of
four in terms of four functions of consciousness working in balance
and harmony: sensation, thinking, feeling and intuition.
   ``The Beatles spoke of themselves as being four parts of a
single personality,'' Schechter says. Mythically speaking, they
were right.
   ``The literate, sardonic Lennon stood for thinking; Harrison _
deeply immersed in Eastern mysticism _ for intuition; the romantic,
androgynously pretty Paul McCartney, for feeling; and the clownish
Ringo, with his puppy-dog charm, for sensation.
   ``Together these four musicians constituted an astonishingly
creative and dynamic entity; separated from one another, however,
they seem to have lost most of their artistic power.''
   Other famous foursomes break down as follows, Schechter says:
   Sensation was a function shared by Hoss, the Cowardly Lion, and
Scotty, chief engineer of the Starship Enterprise.
   Thinking was the role of Ben Cartwright, the Scarecrow and the
logical Mr. Spock.
   Feeling fell to Little Joe, the Tin Man and Enterprise physician
``Bones'' McCoy.
   And intuition was the realm of Adam, Dorothy and Captain James
T. Kirk.

   As chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party, Ms. Doi, 61, helped
draw many women into politics last year after veteran politicians
came under fire for money and sex scandals, including the alleged
keeping of paid mistresses.
   The new female politicians made some inroads in their campaign
against money politics and against a sales tax that squeezed the
purses of Japan's traditional family spenders, the housewives.
   A record 22 women won seats in Parliament's upper house in the
July 1989 elections, and 12 were elected to the lower house in
February. Before the two elections, about half that number were in
Parliament.
   Seeking to placate angry female voters, Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu, who succeeded two scandal-tainted leaders, named two women
to his first cabinet last August.
   But Kaifu's second cabinet, named after the February election,
was all male.
   Females still account for less than 5 percent of Parliament's
764 members. And most women legislators belong to the opposition,
which has little chance of passing laws on women's issues in the
face of the big majority held by the Liberal Democratic Party. The
conservative governing party did not run a single woman candidate
in last February's election for the more powerful lower house of
Parliament.
   Economic trends have done more to create opportunities for women
than politics.
   Enterprising female entrepreneurs are finding niches in new
businesses, ranging from computer software engineering to household
and catering services that have emerged to meet the demands of
working mothers.
   The growing influence of women as consumers _ both professionals
and traditional holders of the purse strings _ is leading companies
to listen more to women employees and generating new opportunities
for career-oriented women.
   A growing labor shortage also is opening doors, especially in
computer-related industries, says Tomoko Shibata, executive
director of the Japan Institute of Women's Employment.
   ``Even if companies don't really want to employ women in
mainstream jobs, they simply have no choice,'' Mrs. Shibata says.
``They're so desperate for good people they feel it's worthwhile to
hire women even if they're likely to quit when they have families.''
   Japan's major electronics companies are energetically recruiting
female college graduates for specialized technical jobs, and some
are developing child care programs so that those women can return
to work as soon as possible.
   In a groundbreaking decision, the managements of those companies
agreed this spring to labor unions' demands for a one-year unpaid
leave for childbearing, up from the current eight weeks' leave
required by law.
   Ms. Higuchi, a frequent participant in committees on women's
issues, says she believes such a policy will spread throughout
Japan in the next few years.
   But merely providing lengthier maternity leaves will not solve
the real problems facing the Japanese family, she says.
   ``Japanese companies treat men as if they were bachelors,
without any family responsibilities other than a paycheck. They
might as well be bachelors, given their lack of real involvement in
their families,'' Ms. Higuchi says.
   Most Japanese men spend their waking hours outside the home _
working overtime, socializing with business associates and
commuting two to four hours a day. They leave decisions on
education, child rearing and household spending to their wives.
   ``It's unnatural for a society to leave no room for families. We
have to make it possible for men to share the responsibility for
bringing up children,'' Ms. Higuchi says. ``The way things are now,
many married women are virtually running single-parent households.''

   EDITOR`S NOTE _ An American missionary family makes its home in
Thailand as protectors of the Mlabri _ one of the world's smallest
and most primitive tribes.

<TEXT>
   The Spirits of the Yellow Leaves,
some of the world's most primitive and timid tribal people, have
found protection from an unlikely source: an American missionary
family.
   Eugene Long, his wife Mary and their three children have lived
among the Mlabri for nine years.
   While their goal is to Christianize, the Longs have yet to bring
up God or the Bible. Their more immediate task is to ensure the
tiny tribe's survival and bridge a vast gap between these
hunter-gatherers and the 20th century.
   There are fewer than 200 Mlabri in Thailand. A small number is
also believed living deep in the forests of neighboring Laos. The
Thai population has decreased over the past decade and Long says
further shrinkage would probably mean the tribe's extinction.
   Not long ago, all Yellow Leaves roamed the jungles in small
family groups, eating wild fruits, roots and any animals they could
snare or spear. In Laos, they may still live this way.
   Myths spread about these furtive people, who were said to move
their homes each time the leaves of their flimsy shelters turned
yellow.
   They wore little more than loincloths and used crude implements
of a prehistoric age. Their language, which has no written form,
identifies just three colors _ green, red and blue; does not
distinguish between a month and a year, and provides for a counting
system that includes only the words for ``one,'' ``two'' and
``many.''
   The first known outsider to meet and study the group was
Austrian anthropologist Hugo Bernatzik who made contact in 1937.
Danish scholar Jesper Trier described them as technologically among
the most primitive people on Earth, ancient remnants of Australoid
tribes overwhelmed by the great Mongoloid migrations into Southeast
Asia from the north.
   When Long first encountered the Yellow Leaves he had images of
cannibals feasting on missionaries, while some of its members later
confided they thought he had come to eat them.
   His trail to the tribe had been circuitous. At 14, Long was a
self-described ``hood'' with a police record. The turning point
came after a close brush with death from alcohol abuse.
   After graduating from high school near Orlando, Fla., he joined
the New Tribes Mission, which works with remote, little-known
tribal groups around the world. At its school he met his wife, who
is from Muscatine, Iowa, and the couple were sent abroad.
   The family moved to the hills of Phrae Province in northern
Thailand. Their rough, wooden home is located in a lovely valley, a
three-mile trek from the nearest village.
   The house has no refrigerator or window panes and no television
to distract Allen, 14, Jared, 11, and 7-year-old Crystal from their
studies, done by correspondence. Staying healthy is a problem; Long
has suffered two bouts with malaria.
   Initially, the Mlabri _ which translates as ``People of the
Jungle'' _ came and went. Their faces would be expressionless. The
women and children would run away when Long approached. They lied
or refused to talk about themselves and their culture, even after
the Longs became the first known outsiders to speak their language.
   ``The lives of the Yellow Leaves are ruled by fear _ fear of
human enemies, tigers, disease, the spirits of their animist
world,'' Long said. ``They themselves are passive. Resolution of
conflict is flight.''
   But the widespread disappearance of Thailand's once great
forests has shut off their escape hatch and most of their
traditional sources of livelihood. Waiting for them as they came
out of the jungles were the Hmong, a large, more aggressive and
technologically sophisticated tribe.
   Long says the Hmong treat the Yellow Leaves ``like slaves,''
luring them with pigs _ their great dietary obsession _ and then
forcing them to work off their ``pork debt'' under appalling
conditions and for abysmally low wages.
   Now, 25 of the tribespeople are living in simple, leaf-roofed
huts on hillsides around the Long home, and much of their suspicion
and fear seems to have subsided.
   The family provides meals, medicine and basic first aid; the
Yellow Leaves are given wages for work that ultimately benefits
them.
   Long paid the equivalent of $750 to acquire squatter's rights
over several hundred acres of land on which the Yellow Leaves have
planted fruit trees, sunk fish ponds and reforested denuded strips
of hillside with teak trees. Pigs are raised.
   Long is aware of criticism leveled by some anthropologists that
his kind of involvement leads to ``detribalization'' of people like
the Mlabri.
   ``I want to preserve aspects of their culture. Ideally, I would
want them to live in undisturbed forests and have them come out to
see us when they needed help,'' he counters.
   ``But that doesn't seem possible now, so we want to give them a
fair chance in today's world. In order to be Yellow Leaves, do they
have to be slaves of the Hmong and die of malaria? Do they have to
be extinct? If so, then yes, I am ruining them.''
   Unlike some foreign missionaries in Thailand, the boyish,
35-year-old Long and his family, all of whom have informally taken
Thai names, get favorable coverage from the Thai press.
   Long says the support he has received from Phrae provincial
authorities and the Thai military has been good, although the Thai
government does not have a formal program to help the Yellow
Leaves. But serious problems remain, he says, in neighboring Nan
province where the majority of the Mlabri live and where
exploitation by the Hmong continues.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Eagles fly again above the Great Lakes, but they
are dying faster than they can reproduce. The majestic birds are
victims of high levels of the same poisons that wiped them out of
the area 20 years ago.

<TEXT>
   More than two decades after the oily
Cuyahoga River caught fire, after Lake Erie was declared dead and
DDT was banned, eagles again soar above the Great Lakes.
   They are not doing well.
   Yearly, they return to try to colonize the contaminated
shoreline. And yearly, scientist Bill Bowerman climbs to their
nests to remove the unhatched eggs.
   In the dead embryos and in the blood of surviving eaglets, the
Michigan State University researcher sees high levels of the same
poisons that wiped eagles out of the Great Lakes 20 years ago.
   The birds are dying faster than they can reproduce, Bowerman
says. For them and more than a dozen other animals that feed on
Great Lakes fish, the shore is a zone of death and deformity.
   It's a red flag warning, Bowerman says, ``a sign of what's
happening to everything in the food chain.''
   The bald eagle is a perfect example, said Conservation
Foundation researcher Dr. Theodore Colborn in Washington, D.C.
   Up and down the inland sea, from cold, deep Lake Superior to the
roiling St. Lawrence River, wildlife scientists tell of shore birds
born with twisted beaks, clubfeet and stomachs outside their
bodies. They tell of whales wracked with cancers and diseases, of
expanses of beach where mink have vanished, and of eagles that can
barely reproduce.
   In a report to the U.S.-Canadian International Joint Commission
last year, Colborn listed 16 predator species whose shoreline
populations have dropped in association with high toxin levels.
   The killer is silent. Pesticides such as DDT, mirex and dieldrin
and toxins such as PCBs and dioxin persist in the mucky lake
sediments despite 20 years of cleanup efforts.
   The toxins are picked up by worms and leeches and travel up the
food chain, from smelt to trout to gulls to eagles. The
concentrations of poisons increase 10 times at each level.
   Contamination levels vary from lake to lake, but there are
basin-wide warnings for humans to limit the sizes and kinds of
Great Lakes fish they eat.
   Fish contamination in some areas has dropped because of controls
and bans on toxins pumped into the lakes by industry. Researchers
say it will be a century or two before the vast lakes shed the
poisons they have absorbed.
   Meanwhile, the eagles try to return.
   Bowerman's research shows Michigan eagles on lakes Michigan and
Huron are reproducing at less than half the rate of those who nest
inland.
   A pair must raise one chick a year to keep the population
stable. Lake Huron eagles have one chick for every three nests.
After five years of eating Great Lakes fish _ the time when inland
birds reach their reproductive peak _ shore bird reproduction in
Michigan falls to one chick for every seven nests.
   Wisconsin's only Lake Michigan eagle nest, near Green Bay, has
not produced a chick in four years. Another pair on the Straits of
Mackinac near St. Ignace has not produced a chick in eight years.
   In the Hiawatha National Forest in Michigan's untamed Upper
Peninsula, prime eagle territory, seven shoreline eagle pairs went
three years before one of them produced a chick this year.
   The eagle has made a remarkable comeback inland. Michigan, with
150 inland nesting pairs, has surpassed its federally set goal of
140 pairs. Minnesota reports 390 inland pairs and Wisconsin has
336, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In the three
states, the eagle is classified as threatened, not endangered.
   Bowerman believes that as those healthy eagles fly to the shore,
their stunted efforts to reproduce are sapping the entire
population.
   There are no nests on Lake Ontario, the most contaminated of the
Great Lakes. The Canadian side of Lake Huron is barren. Five of the
eight U.S. Great Lakes states _ Illinois, Indiana, Pennsylvania,
New York and Minnesota _ have no eagles on their shores.
   ``There's some beautiful land there,'' Bowerman said. ``I don't
know why. I don't know what the flow is from the pulp mills in
Canada. I don't know where it's all coming from.''
   He lost nine nests on Lake Superior this year. The parent birds
have vanished.
   Tim Kubiak of the Fish and Wildlife Service in Lansing said the
eagles' problems are a sign of the poor health of the entire Great
Lakes basin, the world's largest freshwater system.
   ``Growth problems, retardation, smaller head sizes, lower birth
rates ... we see it in mink, the birds,'' Kubiak said. They are
clues to the health of shore-dwelling humans.
   The toxic problems show no signs of abating.
   This spring, a research team found 22 deformities in cormorant
chicks in Wisconsin's Green Bay colony _ a deformity rate of 1 in
72 where 1 in 10,000 would be the norm.
   Last year, Bowerman tested a Saginaw Bay eaglet with 2.25 parts
per million of PCBs in its blood. The 5-week-old Lake Huron chick
carried contamination 100 times higher than inland eaglets.
   Like other Great Lakes researchers of terns and whales and mink,
Bowerman is unable to say what the toxins actually do inside the
bodies of their subjects.
   ``We're seeing messages from the environment, indications that
there are problems,'' New York biologist Robert Foley said. His
work shows elevated PCB concentrations in Lake Ontario mink _ when
he can find them. He thinks the toxins and the population problems
are related, but he has yet to prove it.
   Eight years of analyzing the blubber of dead beluga whales
beached in the St. Lawrence River have given Canadian researcher
Pierre Beland a chemical catalog of the lakes.
   The dead whales' ailments run an odd list of cancers and
diseases previously unseen in belugas. Yet Beland cannot explain
what is happening to the living whales. Why do some of them have
bent spines? Why are St. Lawrence belugas failing to recover
despite a ban on commercial hunting?
   ``We're simply hoping the population will hold out until things
get cleaner,'' he said.

   After 20 years as an actor, Michael Moriarty
says, he thought it was time to settle down and get a steady job.
   Moriarty, a jazz pianist and composer who moonlights on the
stage, television and movies _ or maybe it's the other way around _
stars in his first television series this fall.
   He won a Tony Award for his role in ``Find Your Way Home'' and
Emmys for ``The Glass Menagerie'' and ``Holocaust.'' One of his
most memorable parts was in the 1974 movie ``Bang the Drum
Slowly,'' as the ballplayer whose friend, played by Robert De Niro,
is dying. He's also starred in such movies as ``Pale Rider'' and
``Hanoi Hilton.''
   Moriarty is well known to those who frequent clubs in New York
for his jazz work on the piano. Five years ago, he turned to
composing.
   Moriarty plays a New York prosecutor in NBC's ``Law and Order,''
a one-hour drama that follows a case in a quasi-documentary style
from investigation to trial.
   ``I thought I was mature enough to finally do a series,'' he
says with a slight smile. ``I thought a steady job would suit me
fine. I'm as happy as a clam at high tide.''
   Moriarty portrays an assistant district attorney. George Dzundza
and Christopher Noth are the detectives and Richard Brooks is
Moriarty's fellow prosecutor. The show also stars Dann Florek and
Steven Hill.
   ``This reminds me of `Naked City,''' says Moriarty, who's
completed 13 episodes. Like ``Naked City'' in the 1950s, ``Law and
Order'' is filmed on location all over New York City.
   ``We tell stories. The six of us take you through the lives of
other people, played by New York actors. It captures the very rich
fabric of the city. I play Ben Stone, who's in a state of evolution.
   ``The more I play him the more he gets like me. The only
difference between us in the beginning was that he had a steady
job. Now I have a steady job.''
   Moriarty says ``Law and Order'' doesn't show personal
relationships.
   ``So it's hard to show a man in his profession when he has no
personal life,'' he adds. ``You have to find a hook. I tried to
flirt, and they got all upset. I want Ben to take his job
seriously, but not himself. Sometimes he does, and I have to pull
him back. We have to open up the show and bring in a woman
character.''
   Moriarty, nevertheless, is lavish in his praise of the series
and those people connected with it.
   ``I liked this show and I liked the fact that Joe Stern was the
co-executive producer,'' Moriarty says. ``I felt good about that.
Joe's been an actor in the theater. We'd never worked together, but
we were professional friends. When you sign on a series for five
months, let alone five years, you need to feel at home. I feel very
comfortable. Joe knows every actor in New York, and we're getting
those wonderful faces.''
   He says the show looks at many issues, including vigilantes,
alcoholic doctors, abortion, euthanasia, AIDS and racism.
   Moriarty lives with his wife and son in New York. He grew up in
Detroit, attended Dartmouth and went to the London Academy of Music
and Dramatic Arts on a Fulbright Scholarship. He began his acting
career in off-Broadway shows and in regional theater, including
four years at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. He made his movie
debut in ``Glory Boy'' in 1972.
   His portrayal of a hockey player charged with manslaughter in
the CBS movie ``The Deadliest Season'' led to his Emmy-winning role
as a Nazi SS officer in ``Holocaust.''
   Although ``Law and Order'' is his first series, he has done
guest roles before. He's been on ``Hotel'' and ``Cagney &amp; Lacey,''
and a role on ``The Equalizer'' brought him an Emmy nomination.
   Moriarty has played piano in New York's jazz clubs for many
years. In 1985 he began composing for chamber orchestras, string
quartets and piano and violin solos. His first album, ``Reaching
Out,'' was released earlier this year. He also did the score for a
television movie.
   ``I think Ben Stone might play the piano or conduct a chamber
orchestra in a future episode,'' says Moriarty. ``But if he does,
it won't be my own music. MCA demands all rights to the music.''
   The series is made in association with MCA's Universal
Television.

   ``The Two Jakes''
   The mood of Jack Nicholson's ``The Two Jakes'' is established
before the titles. The Paramount Pictures logo appears, but not as
the usual bright and shining pinnacle. The mountain peak is
shrouded in gloom, like Mount St. Helens poised to blow its top.
   ``Chinatown,'' the earlier saga in the violent life of detective
Jake Gittes, dealt with Los Angeles in the 1930s. Director Roman
Polanski and writer Robert Towne told a grim but fascinating tale
of corruption, betrayal and incest, against the background of the
power plays in securing water for the booming metropolis.
   ``The Two Jakes'' takes place 11 years later. The war is over,
and the new power battles concern the housing developers and the
oil interests. Private detective Gittes has returned from the war
and is back at his old stand, sneaking evidence for divorce cases.
   Builder Harvey Keitel brings Nicholson what seems to be a simple
case of adultery. But when the setup is made at a motel, Keitel
shoots his wife's lover, who turns out to be his business partner.
That's just the first of many discoveries in the labyrinthine
script, also written by Robert Towne, who won an Academy Award for
``Chinatown.''
   ``The Two Jakes'' ranks with ``The Maltese Falcon'' and other
private-eye classics in the richness of characters and prevalence
of mood. Since Nicholson also directed, you could expect strong
perfomances, and the gallery is rich: Keitel, an enigmatic
villain-hero; Meg Tilly, his mysterious wife; Madeline Stowe, the
explosive widow; Ruben Blades, a vicious mobster; Eli Wallach, a
sympathetic lawyer; Joe Mantell, Gittes' dutiful aide; Perry Lopez,
a friendly cop; James Hong, a Chinese mystic. The latter three
appeared in ``Chinatown.''
   The postwar Los Angeles is brilliantly captured in Jeremy
Railton's production design and by Zilmos Zsigmond's photography.
Van Dyke Park's score makes excellent use of 1940s music, played
low-key.
   The problem with ``The Two Jakes'' is the same with others in
the genre: understanding the plot. A knowledge of ``Chinatown'' is
utterly essential; the nuances of the new film are lost without it.
Nicholson's narration, added post-production, helps untangle the
plot, but many of the early scenes are abruptly cut.
   Nicholson's Gittes is another of his masterpieces: a rare,
complex man, battered by police, mobsters and lying women, but ever
in pursuit of the truth. Nicholson remains today's premiere film
actor.
   The producers: Robert Evans and Harold Schneider. The rating is
R for language, violence and sexual content.

   ``Metropolitan''
   The time is Christmas vacation, not so long ago. The setting is
a Manhattan as white as frosted glass, a city of opera and hotel
ballrooms, where erudite youths stroll in top hats and purple gowns
and the parents who pay for it all conveniently disappear each
evening.
   It is also, perhaps, the last deb season as we know it.
   ``I think we are, in a sense, doomed _ the whole preppie
class,'' laments one young Park Avenue socialite in
``Metropolitan,'' a witty, sweetly-paced film by writer-director
Whit Stillman.
   Stillman cites F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1920 novel ``This Side of
Paradise'' as inspiration, and the ill-fated Sally Fowler Rat Pack
is a worthy update of the author's celebrated chronicle of egotists
and debutantes.
   Here is ``The Breakfast Club'' with a sense of humor, a world of
young people terminally bored but never boring. Led by the mocking,
self-satisfied Nick Smith (Christopher Eigeman), the SFRP (as they
sometimes call themselves) drifts from party to party,
contemplating morality, class conflict and the imminent
obsolescence of the ``urban haute bourgeoisie.''
   It all begins with a recital at Carnegie Hall, attended by the
SFRP and Tom Townsend (Edward Clements), a red-headed loner
brooding inside a rented tux. When each happens to hail the same
cab, Tom is offered a free ride, not only for the taxi but as a new
member of the rat pack, which suffers from a shortage of good
escorts.
   Considering himself a principled socialist (and one who eats
cornflakes for breakfast), Tom wants no part of it. ``It wouldn't
be any great tragedy if these people lost their social
perogatives,'' he says huffily, knowing well that Karl Marx would
never succumb to an evening of duplicate bridge.
   But Nick sees right through him. Why spend all your time with
the more fortunate, he observes, ``when one can be at home worrying
about the less fortunate.'' Promised a life of ``music, drink,
entertainment and hot, nutritious meals,'' Tom stays, buying the
tux instead and welcoming the chance to get away from his unfeeling
stepmother.
   Nick appreciates him and so does Audrey Rouget (Carolyn Farina),
a shy, Jane Austen devotee who develops a crush on Tom despite
literary disagreements and his lingering infatuation with the
beautiful Serena Slocum.
   The story is about Tom and Audrey, but Nick carries the film,
right from the moment he derides Tom as a ``public transportation
snob'' for preferring buses to cabs.
   Eigeman, his head cocked, his lip curled, offers running
commentary on the rat pack's vapid lifestyle _ and his own
inability to resist it.
   Whitman makes the film in Nick's spirit, never missing an
opportunity to make fun of these people but helpless to do anything
except wish them well.
   ``Metropolitan'' moves along so effortlessly you'd never guess
Whitman and all the actors are making their film debuts. In fact,
Farina still works as a sales clerk at Macy's.
   But not for long.

   ``Lohengrin'' (CBS Masterworks) _ Woldemar Nelsson conducts the
Bayreuth Festival Orchestra, with Karan Armstrong, Peter Hofmann,
Leif Roar, Siegfreid Vogel, Bernd Wiekl and Elizabeth Connell.
   
   Wagner's ``Lohengrin'' doesn't make superhuman demands of its
singers the way some of his later works do. But assembling an ideal
cast isn't easy, either.
   The lineup for the 1982 Bayreuth performance that was recorded
live by CBS Masterworks and has now been transferred to compact
disc, was, unfortunately, far from ideal.
   ``Lohengrin'' is a romantic fairy tale with nationalistic and
religious undercurrents. Elsa, the heroine, is a maid in distress
who calls on the man of her dreams for help when she is falsely
accused of murder.
   He arrives in a boat drawn by the famous swan, saves her
reputation and marries her. But all their happiness is on one
condition _ that she never ask him his name. Elsa can't bear the
mystery and soon ruins everything.
   The title role is sung here by Peter Hofmann, whose pleasant
sound and handsome physique made him the most sought-after of
Wagnerian tenors for a few years in the late 1970s and early '80s.
It wasn't long before his voice grew coarse and strained under the
pressure of singing roles too strenuous for him.
   In this recording, he still sounds pretty good. But there are
some forced high notes that in hindsight show he was pushing his
voice to do things it wasn't meant to do.
   Elsa is Karan Armstrong, whose thin, basically unattractive
soprano copes adequately with the music but fails to convey the
warmth and passion that make her one of Wagner's most treasurable
heroines.
   Elizabeth Connell, as Ortrud, the sorceress who plants fatal
seeds of doubt in Elsa, also has a thin voice, but it's more
appealing to the ear than Armstrong's.
   Her husband, Telramund, is sung with little impact by baritone
Leif Roar. Siegfreid Vogel is King Henry, and Bernd Wiekl, who
would go on to sing more substantial roles at the Metropolitan
Opera and elsewhere, is heard in the small part of the Herald.
   Woldemar Nelsson conducts the Bayreuth Festival Orchestra in a
fast-paced reading of the score. The sound is naturally not as
well-focused as with a studio recording, but some of the excitement
of a live performance comes through.

   ``Hell to Pay'' (Arista) _ The Jeff Healey Band
   
   Since Paul Shaffer plays keyboards on the Jeff Healey Band's
``Hell to Pay,'' here are 10 reasons the album doesn't deserve a
plug from David Letterman:
   10. It will be controversial, with the title likely to draw
objections from those that applauded the 2 Live Crew album ban.
``Heck to Pay'' would've been better.
   9. George Harrison and Jeff Lynne both sing harmony on
Harrison's ``While My Guitar Gently Weeps.'' Since their voices
sound alike, this is a redundant use of Traveling Wilburys.
   8. Guitarist-singer Healey and bandmates Joe Rockman (bass) and
Tom Stephen (drums) are poor songwriters. The six songs written by
one or more of them are built on recycled riffs, and it seems every
chord change is telegraphed.
   7. Of the four covers, only the bluesy ``I Think I Love You Too
Much'' by Mark Knopfler supplies much sizzle. Highlighted by some
nifty guitar interplay from Knopfler and Healey, the song makes the
rest of the record just that much more disappointing.
   6. Other sparks ignited by Healey's guitar are quickly doused
when he sings. His voice is dead on arrival.
   5. The opening cut, ``Full Circle,'' sounds as though it came
from the Foreigner songbook.
   4. Even worse, the title cut sounds as though it came from the
Bachman-Turner Overdrive songbook.
   3. Healey sounds tired on only the second album of a promising
career. There are few surprises, few fresh ideas. Producer Ed
Stasium must share the blame.
   2. Paul Shaffer plays keyboards.
   1. With better singing and better songs, the 23-year-old Healey
has the talent as a guitarist to make a great album. Letterman
should save his plug for it.

   Mariah Carey (Columbia) _ Mariah Carey
   
   Not Whitney Houston, the commercial voiceover could say, but an
incredible simulation ...
   That's 20-year-old Mariah Carey, who's making a big splash with
her debut album. She's a formidable talent at risk of being a
victim of corporate gamesmanship.
   Trade papers tell of how Columbia Records, concerned about a
competing label's plan to release a new Whitney Houston record this
fall, tried to steal some thunder with Carey's new record.
   Consider it stolen. Carey mimics Houston's stylish mixture of
light dance pop and synthesized ballads so adeptly one half expects
her to break into a chorus of ``How Will I Know.''
   This is not to belittle young Carey's talent. The daughter of a
New York City opera singer, she's got an amazing seven-octave
singing range and is responsible for some other-worldly sounds. Not
since the late Minnie Riperton has a pane-shattering voice such as
this come around. Hide your dogs for the end of ``All in Your
Mind.''
   However, while Carey has the ability, she's yet to match it with
a vision. The songs and instrumentation are like something you'd
find in the generic aisle of a grocery store. If she ever matches
her voice to the right songs, watch out.

   The striking images of James Lesesne Wells are on view at
Hammonds House Galleries in Atlanta as part of the National Black
Arts Festival.
   ``James Lesesne Wells: Selected Works, 1926-1988,'' illuminates
the range of the artist's work, from the lithograph ``Negro
Worker,'' to the delightful nude, ``The Vamp.''
   Wells, who was born in Atlanta in 1902, flourished in New York
during the Harlem Renaissance, and his modernist black and white
prints established him as a leading printmaker of that period.
   Watercolors and drawings from the George A. Lucas collection are
on show at the Baltimore Museum of Art through Oct. 14.
   The Lucas collection, known for its fine paintings by Corot,
Gerome, Pissarro and others, and for its holdings of more than
20,000 French 19th-century prints, also contains an extraordinary
group of about 100 watercolors and drawings, including works by
Barye, Besnard, Daubigny, Daumier, Delacroix, Jongkind, Millet and
Whistler. It is particularly strong in landscape views and scenes
of daily life in France.
   Thirty-five of the finest works, most of which are rarely seen
because of light sensitivity, have been selected for the
exhibition. The Lucas collection came to the Maryland Institute
College of Art as a gift in 1910 upon Lucas' death. It has been on
indefinite loan to the BMA since 1933.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Working With Marlon</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imagine being a foreigner and learning
English from Marlon Brando.
   That happened to Maximilian Schell 28 years ago, but he still
has managed to win an Academy Award and a host of other honors.
   The English lessons happened when Schell made ``The Young
Lions.'' The Austrian actor had to learn his lines by phonetics,
and Brando, the notorious mumbler, proved a big help.
   ``It was my first experience in a Hollywood movie,'' Schell
recalls. ``I didn't speak much English at that time, and Marlon was
extremely kind to help me with the part.
   ``Whenever people say that Marlon was difficult, I just say with
me he's the easiest guy in the world.''
   The two actors have met on occasion over the years, but they
lost touch because, says Schell, ``I don't like to bother famous
people.''
   They staged a reunion for ``The Freshman,'' in which Brando
parodies his classic Don Corleone portrayal in ``The Godfather.''
Schell plays an expert chef who joins the mob boss in an outrageous
scheme.
   ``We embraced each other,'' reports Schell, ``and we sat in the
trailer and talked, not about old times, but about philosophy; that
was our favorite theme (on `The Young Lions'). He has become more
of a philosopher than he was at that time.
   ``While he has lost some of that young drive that he had, he
still is a great screen personality. When he's on the screen, you
always have to find a way to stand up against him. That was the
same problem on `The Young Lions.'
   ``I come from the classical stage _ `Hamlet' and `Everyman' and
so forth. So I was a very eloquent actor, especially in my native
tongue. And Marlon, of course, was famous for this: `mumble,
mumble.' It was fascinating, because you had to listen and figure
out what he was saying. He changed the style of acting.
   ``Obviously there is a chemistry between us,'' Schell said.
``Even while we were shooting `The Freshman' we talked about a
sequel. We thought it was a good idea of two guys, both retired,
one in Switzerland and the other in Sicily. They call each other
and say, `Are you bored?'
   ```Yes.'
   ```Let's do something together.'''
   Schell, 59, hadn't heard of Matthew Broderick, the college
freshman who stumbles into the Mafia, but found him to be ``fresh
and innovative; he stands up very well.''
   Acting was inevitable for Maximilian Schell, whose father was a
Swiss writer and poet and mother a Viennese actress. Four of their
children became actors, including Maria, who starred in ``The
Brothers Karamazov,'' and ``Cimarron.'' After the Nazi invasion of
Austria in 1938, the family moved to Switzerland, and that's where
Max grew up, attending universities at Zurich and Basel.
   Schell appeared in the classical theater and in German films,
and in 1957 he was cast as a German officer in ``The Young Lions,''
along with Brando, Montgomery Clift and Dean Martin. He managed to
hold his own in that high-powered company, and Stanley Kramer chose
him to play the enigmatic defense attorney in ``Judgment at
Nuremberg.''
   Both Schell and Spencer Tracy were nominated for the best-actor
Oscar for their roles in the drama of the Nazi war-criminal trials,
and Schell was the surprise winner. He has also been nominated for
best actor in ``The Man in the Glass Booth'' and supporting actor
in ``Julia.'' He has continued to act and direct on the stage, and
he has directed such films as ``Marlene'' (Academy nomination for
documentary), ``First Love'' and ``End of the Game.''
   Long one of Europe's most eligible bachelors, he surprised his
friends three years ago by taking a bride, Natalia Andreichenko, a
Russian actress he met while filming ``Peter the Great.'' They have
a daughter 18 months as well as a 7-year-old son by her previous
marriage. The Schells now live in Los Angeles.
   ``It all goes together, I think,'' explains the philosophical
Schell. ``You see, the moment I left Switzerland and went to
Germany, Austria, London and New York, I became an immigrant. Or
emigrant. I once said to a sculptor, `You know, what I miss is a
home base; like a tree needs ground, instead of putting a palm tree
in the mountains or a pine in the desert.'
   ``He said, `No, Max, you're a part of the future. We all live on
one planet, and you represent that artist who is home everywhere.'
That is a consolation for me.
   ``Marriage was also a new experience. It was unavoidable. When I
was in Russia playing Peter the Great, Natasha played my first
wife. She said, `I'm very angry with you, because you're putting me
into a monastery.' That was a line from the (TV miniseries) because
she couldn't speak English.
   ``That was a good way to introduce herself. Instead of sending
her to a monastery, I took her with me to Hollywood. When we came
in January, she said, `I will never leave here.'
   ``I like it, too. When I was a bachelor, I was always going
home. You know Hollywood; it can be very cruel. A bachelor can be
lonely, even with all the friends you have. So, I went back to
Europe.
   ``Now, with my wife and the babies, you come home, you may be
sad, but she throws her arms around your neck, and it's all good.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Cynthia Gregory Reflects on ``Swan Lake''</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARGARET HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cynthia Gregory, whose exquisite
turns and elegant phrasing helped make American Ballet Theatre an
international treat in the dance world, is well-suited to the roles
of Odette and Odile in ``Swan Lake.''
   Dancing Odile in the Black Swan pas de deux requires 32
consecutive spins. But Odette, the White Swan, is her favorite
role. While other ballerinas dance the role with melancholy and
pathos, Gregory depicts strength with vulnerability and triumph
instead of gloom.
   ``I think I'm more of a woman falling in love,'' said the
American Ballet Theatre prima ballerina. ``She's ... saying to her
sisters, the other maidens, `Maybe we'll be saved because I fell in
love.' And so it's almost a joyous solo rather than a tragic one.''
   She was referring to the touching solo after the Act II pas de
deux.
   When Gregory talks about ``Swan Lake,'' set to music by
Tchaikowsky, she makes the swans sound like old friends rather than
feathered characters from a fairy tale.
   Odette is a maiden turned into a swan by a magician's spell;
Odile, an evil twin who tries to destroy the love of Odette and the
Prince.
   The role makes even seasoned ballerinas nervous, but not
Gregory, who has been dancing it since 1967.
   ``I feel I was born to dance that role,'' she said in an
interview before a recent performance at the Teatro Colon. ``I love
being the swan, and I love being two characters in the same ballet.
... And the music is glorious. It moves me no matter what.''
   Her role in ``Swan Lake'' is her signature work.
   ``Even though some ballerinas say it's the most difficult role,
for me it isn't,'' she said. ``Technically it's my kind of steps.
... It's not a lot of jumping, which I don't like to do.''
   Gregory, 44, is nearing the end of a career that has lasted
almost three decades. Before she retires in another two or three
years, she'd like to make a video of ``Swan Lake.''
   The dancer once described by Rudolf Nureyev as America's ``prima
ballerina assoluta'' talks about life after ballet with
characteristic candor, humor and realism.
   ``It takes a lot more willpower and a lot more getting past the
pain now,'' she said. ``If I take a day off, I really feel it.
   ``I also want to dance my best, leave it at that point and have
people say, `Why did she stop? She was so wonderful,' rather than
go, `It's time this woman stopped dancing.'''
   Class and rehearsals will become things of the past, she said,
but unfortunately so, too, will cherished moments ``when I am
completely in my element and God is moving me around on a string,''
she said.
   ``Sometimes that happens, when I come out of myself and things
happen on the stage that seem impossible to me, and yet they're
happening to me. I guess it's from a lot of hard work, but I think
I was just meant to dance, and God is holding me up.''
   Her partners have included some of the most celebrated male
dancers of the latter part of the 20th century: Nureyev, Fernando
Bujones and Ivan Nagy.
   And though, she might miss the world of ballet, there is one
role she will be happy to bid farewell to: Myrtha, the queen of the
vengeful wraiths in the second act of ``Giselle.''
   ``It was all jumping, and once you're finished with your part,
then you just stand there for the rest of the time and order people
around,'' she said.
   ``And musically it never seemed to work for me. She's supposed
to be this cold, cold woman, full of hate, and her music is this
tinkly music that has nothing to do with hate.''
   Gregory speaks often of music. A Californian of Greek and French
Canadian descent, she is from a musical family. Her grandfather
arranged the national anthem of Canada.
   ``I think a lot of dancers don't use the music the way they
could,'' she noted. ``They don't pay that much attention to it
except for the beat and the rhythm. But I think there's the essence
of what the music is trying to tell you, and that's what they
should be on stage _ the essence of the music.''
   Gregory is putting those and other thoughts in an autobiography
she hopes to finish by the time she retires.
   Retirement will give her more time to spend with husband, New
York banker Hilary Miller, and son, Lloyd Gregory Miller, 2{.
   ``I think I'm more of a complete person being a mother,'' she
said, ``and maybe that has brought something else to my dancing. I
do have a new joy in me that probably shows. People say that,
anyway.''
   Gregory was in South America on a 16-day tour last month. Her
son often travels with her, but did not accompany her on this trip.
   ``Sometimes now I resent going to dance,'' she said. ``He'll
say, `Good luck, Mom,' and I say, `I don't want to leave you.'''
   Gregory's last pirouette may not mean the end of her love affair
with the audience because the ballerina wants to go to Hollywood.
   ``I guess I'm a ham at heart,'' she said with a laugh. ``I'd
even do a television sitcom.''

   She has been described as having ``one of pop music's most
gorgeously appointed voices.'' She has won three Grammy Awards as
best rhythm 'n' blues female vocalist plus one for best soul gospel
singing and two songwriting Grammys for ``Sweet Love'' and ``Giving
You the Best That I Got.''
   But she has insecurities and worries about maintaining her
individuality.
   ``Record companies have come to see what I do is profitable,''
she said. ``They're churning out female artists who sing ballads
with jazz overtones.
   ``How do I maintain my identity when there's an assembly line of
me coming out?''
   Baker has a new Elektra Records album, ``Compositions,'' on
which she wrote or co-wrote seven of the nine songs. She also
recorded seven live with a rhythm section.
   ``They were out with Eric Clapton. We had 11 days to cut. We cut
10 songs in 11 days, the fastest cutting I've even done.
   ``It was great. I never knew you could have fun in the studio.
I'd hated it. Doing it live, everything at the same time, I'm not
thinking about myself. If you hear something great being played, it
spurs you to do something cool.
   ``I tried to get my manager to get a film crew in, once we got
the bugs out. He said, `You could have got self-conscious. You
never would have finished.' I said, `Thanks for second guessing
me.' He called to see if we could recreate it. The guys were out
with Clapton.''
   In the late 1970s, Baker became vocalist for a Detroit group,
Chapter 8. ``We did an album in 1980 and Ariola didn't pick up the
option. They said, `You don't have what it takes to make it. I
figured they knew what they were talking about. I went and got a
day job.''
   So she went to work at her aunt's beauty shop as a gofer and
later as a shampooer.
   ``With Chapter 8, I was singing ballads,'' Baker said. ``There
was nothing on the radio except dance music. Now the trend is
toward what I do, fireside love songs with jazz, blues and gospel
overtones. The good thing is that a lot of young singers are
discovering their predecessors. I listened to Sarah Vaughan and
Nancy Wilson. If there is going to be a fad, let it be for love
songs with jazz overtones, because that's what I do.''
   Baker's in the middle of a huge summer tour, and quips that her
songs are, ``Not fireside love songs. Seaside. Love songs from the
pier.''
   She's been accused of being quick tempered, but says she isn't.
   ``I'm impatient with incompetence. We have 30 to 50 people on
the road when I'm traveling, lighting crew, stage managers,
carpenters, bus drivers, limo drivers, security. I don't know how I
got a reputation for being that witch with a `b' on the front of
it,'' she said.
   ``It comes from people talking to people that have been fired.
The only way you can get fired is that you complicate very simple
things by not listening or not having any pride about your job or
having to be told something 50,000 times. Who has got time for
that?''
   Gradually, she says, ``The best people have kind of found their
way to us. We've got the same band I had the last tour and a great
crew, which makes life as easy as it can be on the road.''
   Audiences have been great, Baker said. ``The kind of confidence
that fosters in me is not the kind of confidence record companies
want their artists to have. What happened at Wembley (in England)
and Copenhagen and here has given me a confidence that I needed.
They play on the insecurity of an artist, saying audiences were
there the last time but we don't know if they're going to be there.
   ``The first leg of this tour has given me confidence in knowing
my audience is there for me.''
   Baker carries an exercise tape on tour. She also carries a book
about chord structures and progressions which she studies on
airplanes.
   When she was growing up, her aunt suggested piano lessons. She,
youngest of five girls, was ``a rebel without a cause'' and
refused. She's sorry now. ``I do play. I'm not a pianist.''
   In 1988, Baker married Walter Bridgeforth, who has a small
investing company and operates a restaurant. When their opinions
don't coincide, she says, he doesn't debate or argue. ``He says,
`You're entitled to an opinion. I'm going to the golf course.' I
like it, though.
   ``He travels with me when he can. I wouldn't want him with me
all the time. Somebody is going to read something into that. I like
the fact he has a life independent of mine. And it makes for
sweeter rendezvous.''
   They live on Lake St. Clair in Grosse Pointe, Mich., and have
recently bought a house nearby that they will tear down. ``We'll
build something that will fit the community. We're not ones to try
to outdo everybody. I'm in a very iffy business. If I'm milk toast
tomorrow, we could sell off the adjoining land to developers and
we'd be quite all right.
   ``No matter what I do and no matter how much property we acquire
or investments we make, there's this little person in here that's
the inner-city kid saying, `Anita, somebody is going to come and
take your credit card.'
   ``When we walked into the new house, I had to go into another
room and sit down. I lost it. When I was a kid, and Walter, too,
the thing to do at Christmastime was parents would pack their
children into the car and drive along the lake shore and look at
the pretty lights on the houses.
   ``Now, it's like I'm walking through a dream sometimes.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Pure Cider and Ice Floes as Large as Cars</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On his 200-year-old farm in the mountains of
western Maine, author Michael Rothschild likes to pick apples from
the orchard, grind them up and press them into cider.
   The cider is difficult to drink; no water or sugar is added. It
catches in your throat the first time and makes you shake your head
and squeeze your eyes shut as if you had dipped your tongue in a
spoonful of vinegar.
   Rothschild's writing goes down just as hard. The stories from
his second collection, ``Wondermonger'' ($17.95, Viking), need to
be read a few pages at a time, with long pauses in between. Unless
you have an intricate knowledge of Maine folklore, they're
difficult to understand at first, and you may not bother trying
again.
   But it's like drinking pure cider. Read ``The Toad'' two or
three times, grab hold of the words as if each one hangs from the
tip of a branch and you get caught up in simple miracles such as
how wide a snake's mouth can open, as well as the author's pleasure
in telling the story.
   ``You're putting a terrible pressure on the person and I think
you'd better have something where if the person does read you
again, you'd better deliver,'' Rothschild explained between deep
puffs of cigarettes at his publisher's offices. ``I think readers
will be taken to a place where they're not taken in fiction anymore.
   ``There are people who talk to a kid and say, `This kid's smart,
I'll talk to him on the level of 7,' and, `This kid's dumb, I'll
talk to him with a 3.'
   ``But I don't change my vocabulary or my expressions when I
write. I'm not writing for this person or for that person. Maybe it
would be better if I was writing to appeal to an audience in a
certain way.''
   So imagine being dropped in a forest of pine in the dead of
winter, with snow falling as if sifted through the clouds and the
north wind pulling at the trees. There are no maps or tour guides,
just a copy of ``Wondermonger'' to safely get you home.
   ``Winter fostered neighborliness among the denned-up settlers of
Tantrattle,'' he writes in the title story. ``Just as deer, to
survive the depth of snow and boreal winds, yard beneath a
sheltering stand of cedar and paw after browse within the
steep-walled confines of their maze, so the scattered families
tunneled out from storm upon December storm to call upon friends
or, with new fervor and frequency, congregated, Sunday morning and
Wednesday evenings, at the Reverend Cawkin's meeting house.''
   Now Rothschild admits he has a hard time explaining what that
means _ even his mother complains she doesn't understand _ but
compare it to looking at a landscape painting; steep-walled
confines and a sheltering stand of cedar are the story.
Rothschild's fiction isn't about characters getting from one place
to another, it's about the places themselves.
   ``When there's a terrible blizzard, the master blizzard of the
winter, there are people that stay by their stoves, and I suppose
there are some people that like to go out and bundle up and go out
because they like to see what's going on,'' Rothschild said.
   ``For better or worse I'm one of those people. When there are
rivers breaking up and ice floes large as cars, I ruffle up my hair
and my eyes roll back in my head and I feel great.''
   The nine stories of ``Wondermonger'' can be divided between
tales of the awful and the awe-inspiring, between shotguns and
bleeding dogs and pregnant women and mystical children.
   They run chronologically, starting in colonial times with the
title story and leading up the present _ and beyond _ with ``A Land
Without Fossils.'' ``The Toad'' lasts just three pages;
``Wondermonger'' runs over 60; and only ``A Land Without Fossils,''
in which a father contemplates the maps drawn by his 5-year-old
son, resembles the author's own life.
   Rothschild was born in Maine in 1947. He's a rugged looking man
_ Ernest Borgnine with a ponytail _ and between tending to the
farm, raising four children, sculpting and making trips to China,
he hasn't had much time to write. His first set of stories,
``Rhapsody of a Hermit'' was published in 1973 and the back of the
book promises a novel that has yet to be completed.
   His friends include woodsmen who remove their hats in front of
his sculptures of naked women, and an elderly neighbor who responds
to the word ``art'' by asking, ``Art who?''
   So rather than attend writers' conferences or philosophize at
cocktail parties, Rothschild can be found setting snares, or
reading Nathanial Hawthorne to children on July 4 or helping a pig
give birth in the middle of the night.
   He dismisses suggestions that staying on the farm means writing
in the wilderness. Just looking at the moon is inspiration for
Rothschild, a man who has no interest in living in a big city, who
sees chatting up authors as unnecessary as going to town to buy a
carton of apple juice.
   ``People ask me why I write in a void and it always seems
peculiar when I think about it,'' Rothschild said, ``because I'm
surrounded with people who are living their lives, farmers and
millworkers. People living in the hills trying to hang onto their
farms, people of all ages, kids and animals.
   ``It seems like an absolute plenitude, the opposite of the void.
Now a group of artists talking about writing or talking about
painting, that seems to me almost dead center void.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Lots of Goals Left for Reba McEntire</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Reba McEntire is the only singer ever
voted female vocalist of the year four times by the Country Music
Association.
   She has performed live for millions She has a platinum album
(more than a million copies sold) for her ``Greatest Hits.'' She's
won a Grammy, appeared on three Bob Hope TV specials and branched
out into acting.
   What's left?
   ``Everything,'' she said. ``We want to sell more tickets and
more albums. Do movies and television. Produce records. Have a
bigger publishing company. Have more acts for my company.
   ``We've got lots to do.''
   McEntire, 35, who took off five months to have her first baby in
February, has had six straight gold albums, and was voted best
female country vocalist from 1984-87.
   She's in the midst of a 115-city concert tour that began May 3.
Her 17th album, ``Rumor Has It,'' has just been released.
   She recently acted in her first movie, ``Tremors,'' appearing as
a survivalist with star Kevin Bacon.
   ``I like to act and I want to pursue it more,'' she said in an
interview in her office a few days after singing at the Goodwill
Games in Seattle. ``Of course music and touring is No. 1.''
   Her single, ``Walk On,'' reached No. 2 on the country music
charts in July. It was about persevering during hard times, and
joined other topical issues she previously has tackled: ``The
Stairs'' was about wife abuse, and ``Am I the Only One Who Cares''
dealt with teen-age suicide and alienation.
   ``Fancy,'' in her new album, is about a mother pushing a girl
into prostitution to get ahead in life.
   ``I chose it because I liked it,'' McEntire said. ``I've wanted
to record it for five years.''
   Her 1987 Grammy was for ``Whoever's in New England.'' Her other
hit records include ``Cathy's Clown,'' ``New Fool at an Old Game,''
``Little Rock,'' ``Love Will Find Its Way to You,'' ``One Promise
Too Late'' and ``What Am I Gonna Do About You.''
   McEntire recently was co-host of ABC's ``Good Morning America,''
filling in for Joan Lunden who was on vacation. She appeared on the
Hope specials on NBC during the past few years.
   ``He liked me, and he likes to work with people he gets along
with and are easy to work with,'' McEntire said. ``We were told to
be there at a certain time, and we were there, usually early.''
   McEntire was the third of four children who grew up in Chockie,
Okla., where she mixed ranching, rodeoing and singing. She is a
former rodeo barrel racer and spent several years on a ranch in
Stringtown, Okla.
   She first appeared on country music charts in 1976, one year
after she gained notice by singing the National Anthem at the
National Rodeo Finals in Oklahoma City.
   But McEntire wasn't always on top. ``I've been booed off stage.
At times I haven't drawn flies. I've sat in a store to sign
autographs and someone asked me where the bathroom is!''
   Nevertheless, her string of four straight honors as country
music's top female singer likely will never be matched. Looking
back on it today, she's actually relieved K.T. Oslin finally
displaced her as the winner.
   ``It would have been sudden death for me if I had won it
again,'' McEntire said. ``You don't want to ride a good horse to
death.''
   She dismissed a story in a supermarket tabloid that she and
Oslin, best known for her hit record ``80s Ladies,'' are feuding.
   ``It was good that K.T. won. She is spunky and she brought
something to country music that we all needed, something totally
different. I really appreciate K.T.''
   Having a child has made her career even more meaningful to her.
   ``I have something to work for now that I have Shelby: to
accumulate more, allow him to be secure if something happens to
me.''

   There is nothing new under the sun, goes an old
proverb, but skin specialists say they are learning more all the
time about the sun's damaging effects and how people can protect
themselves.
   A popular belief _ that ultraviolet A rays are benign compared
with ultraviolet B rays _ is giving way to evidence over the past
few years that both types wreak similar havoc on the skin, doctors
say.
   ``UVB is the most damaging, but UVA is also damaging,'' says Dr.
Vincent A. De Leo, assistant professor of dermatology at Columbia
University Medical School in New York.
   ``UVA can do all the things to skin UVB does _ promote skin
cancer and premature aging _ it's just not quite as efficient,'' he
says. ``The important thing is there's a lot more UVA out there
than UVB, at least 10 times as much in sunshine, some quotes say
100 times as much.''
   Almost all tanning parlor equipment now uses UVA radiation, De
Leo says. It is only one-thousandth as powerful in causing burns as
UVB, but it has been found to cause almost all the adverse
reactions occurring in people who take medications that make them
sensitive to light, he said.
   Adverse reactions to such medications, which include common
antibiotics, blood-pressure drugs and pain relievers, can include
blistering and bruising when the skin is touched, severe sunburn
reactions and rashes, he says.
   Dr. Fred Castrow of Houston, an officer of the American Academy
of Dermatology and a leader in the effort to get tanning parlors
regulated, says his advice is the same regardless of whether people
take medication: stay away from tanning parlors.
   ``We can't get out of the sunlight _ we can try to protect
ourselves from as much damage as possible. But tanning parlors are
one of those non-necessities that are damaging.''
   Joyce Burdette, executive director of the Suntanning Education
Association, a tanning-salon industry group in Frederick, Md.,
disagrees, and says, ``The public is going to continue to want to
tan and get some color.
   ``The theory behind indoor tanning is that you are receiving a
controlled, measured dose,'' she says. ``Moderation is the key,
like anything else.''
   The American Medical Association last year issued guidelines for
people who insist on tanning cosmetically or who underestimate the
risks of being in the sun:
   _ Minimize exposure to ultraviolet radiation by staying out of
the sun between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. and wearing a hat and protective
clothing while outdoors.
   _ Beware of surfaces that reflect sunlight, such as sand, snow,
ice and concrete, that can intensify the effects of the sun's rays
by 10 to 50 percent.
   _ Use a sunscreen, with a sun protection factor of at least 15
for skin that burns easily or tans only gradually, or higher at
greater altitudes or for other intensive exposures. A person
wearing a sunscreen with a protection factor of 15 would get the
same amount of exposure after 15 hours as he would in one hour if
he were wearing no sunscreen.
   _ Avoid tanning machines. But if tanning equipment is used,
people who tan moderately well should limit exposures to 30 to 50
half-hour sessions per year, use a properly calibrated device with
a timer, keep a record of exposures, wear protective goggles and
make sure an attendant is nearby in case of an emergency.
   De Leo says most sunscreens currently protect only against UVB,
and manufacturers have begun to add chemical agents to protect
against UVA.
   One type is the benzophenones, already present in most
sunscreens with sun protection factors higher than 15, and another
is dibenzoylmethane, found only in a lotion called Photoplex, made
by Herbert Laboratories of Irvine, Calif., he said.
   No scientific consensus has been reached on how to rate UVA
sunscreen protectiveness, and it is believed that present lotions
carry a protection factor no higher than 5, he said.
   Doctors currently are trying hard to get adults to have their
children wear sunscreens, since at least 50 percent of lifetime sun
exposure usually occurs before age 18, and cumulative exposure is
blamed for at least one type of cancer as well as for premature
aging.
   But De Leo says children under 6 months old should not have
sunscreens applied to their skin, since no one knows how much of
the agents are absorbed.
   For people who already have premature aging associated with sun
exposure, a variety of products are being tested. But the only one
so far proven to smooth wrinkles and fade spots is tretinoin, a
cousin of vitamin A marketed under the trade name Retin-A, says Dr.
Barbara Gilchrest, chairman of dermatology at Boston University
School of Medicine.
   ``The sun does quite a job on people's skin,'' she says. ``I
don't think we'll ever have a product that will allow people to go
out and bake themselves in the sun and then go to the corner store
and buy something that will fix that.''

   You woke up late and now you have to rush to catch the bus.
Twisting and hopping from one foot to the other, you'll save time
by pulling on your pantyhose standing up. Ping. Ouch. What's that
sharp feeling in your back?
   Or: You decided to rearrange the furniture in your office to
make way for a new computer. Moving a small file cabinet or two
shouldn't have been any trouble for a strong fellow like you, but
you must have overdone it, because now you feel like you've been
hit in the back by a truck.
   Back trouble is the great leveler, hitting perhaps as many as 70
percent of the population sooner or later _ the athletically
inclined and couch potato alike. Economic costs of back pain have
been estimated at about $16 billion annually, says the American
Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Low back pain is the most common
disability among those under 45, according to a National Health and
Nutrition Examination survey.
   You're a candidate for low back pain if you're out of shape, if
you've overexerted doing something you're not used to, or if you
didn't warm up muscles and joints before plunging into activity,
says Dr. Jerold Lancourt, a Dallas orthopedist who specializes in
back problems. A sudden twisting or turning motion can add up to
weeks or months of misery.
   What to do? ``Most back pain will get better by itself,''
Lancourt says. ``I like to use common sense about these things.''
He recommends lying down for a day or two, aspirin, ice, and warm
baths. Avoid too much activity for a while.
   If the pain is still around a week later, if it's bad enough to
keep you from resuming your normal activities, or if you have pain
running down your leg, call the doctor. An orthopedist, who
specializes in bones and joints, probably is your best bet, though
your general practitioner usually can help, too. Lancourt observes
that ``there's enough back pain to go around'' for all doctors.
   The doctor will analyze the source of your pain. It could be a
disk problem, such as disk material protruding and pressing against
a nerve or more seriously, a ruptured disk. It could be from muscle
spasms, arthritis, osteoporosis. Stress, overweight, overload, and
other lifestyle-related conditions are possible contributors.
   Whatever the cause, the probability that you'll need drastic
treatment such as surgery is slight. ``About 90 to 95 percent of my
patients go to physical therapy,'' Lancourt says. Physical
therapists will work out an exercise program designed to increase
flexibility and strength in your back.
   You'll also learn something about the mechanics of your back and
what to do _ or not do _ to keep back pain at bay.
   ``The best way to avoid problems is to understand how your body
works,'' Lancourt says. He characterizes the back as a complex
piece of engineering, with the jelly-like disks between the
vertebra functioning as a hydraulic system that distributes load
stress. The natural ``S'' curve of the spine is the architecture
that supports and balances the weight of the head; the five lower
vertebra of the lumbar spine act as foundation for carrying the 70
percent of your body weight located in the upper body.
   What usually goes wrong is that because of your habits and
lifestyle, your back isn't as strong and flexible as it should be.
Or you misjudge your capacities. ``You can expect pain if you're
not accustomed to say, moving furniture, or if you spend 20 hours
on the road or in an airplane,'' says Lancourt.
   You can minimize your chances of back pain by being aware of
proper positions for sitting, standing, lifting and resting, he
says. When seated, pull your knees up so they're higher than your
hips. When standing, find something to rest one foot higher, like a
rail or step, to distribute the pressure -- the so-called
``bar-rail position.'' When lifting, squat down to pick up the
load, then hold it close to your torso, which is your center of
gravity. At rest, lie on your back with your knees propped up.
   Lancourt advises to always avoid twisting and bending, and
always warm up for any kind of physical activity.
   The best recreational sport for strengthening the back, in his
opinion, is swimming. Biking and walking also are good, but he
cautions that golf may involve too much twisting of the spine.

   Statistics from the surgeon-general show
that women, once hooked, have a tough time kicking the cigarette
habit. Sue Delaney, an ex-smoker, says it hasn't helped that most
smoking cessation programs are designed for men, who smoke for
different reasons than women.
   ``Most approaches to quitting are based on the experience of
male smokers, whose needs sharply diverge from those of women
smokers on several key points,'' says Delaney, whose book, ``Women
Smokers Can Quit: A Different Approach'' (Women's Healthcare
Press), is used in hospitals and no-smoking programs.
   She points to research that shows men usually smoke for pleasure
and quit for the positive benefits, while women may smoke to
suppress depression and other negative feelings and quit primarily
to please others. Cultural expectations reinforce men as
independent problem solvers; women are expected to share their
feelings and bond with others to solve problems. And women are more
likely to fear weight gain because thinness is such an ingrained
cultural value for them.
   ``We have to help women feel less guilt, help them feel that
quitting smoking is a positive thing, a matter of taking control of
their own lives,'' says Delaney.
   She says most women start smoking in their teens, and one of the
most powerful reasons is that they respond to glamorous images
shown in cigarette advertising. She thinks that publications who
rely on revenues from the ads may pull their punches when it comes
to editorial matter about smoking and health. ``The amount of
tobacco advertising directly correlates with the percentage of
articles,'' she says. ``We're not going to get straight information
from magazines.''
   Some of that information is in her book, which offers practical
tips to the woman smoker who wants to quit. Much of the advice is
based on her own experience in breaking a 40-year cigarette habit
nearly two years ago, as well as research and interviews with other
women smokers.
   She recommends making a list of reasons to quit, but she
emphasizes that it should be an ``I-me-my'' list: ``If you're
tempted to write, `My husband wants me to quit,' write instead, `I
love my husband and want to spend many more years with him.' If you
want to write, `My friends are worried about me,' write instead,
`I'm worried about my blood pressure, my cough, my fatigue.' If you
start to write, `My children don't like it,' write instead `I want
to get the kids off my case.' ''
   Delaney quit cold turkey, but she says preparing to quit is
better for most women. Preparation helps them analyze why they
smoke and to recognize people, places and routines that trigger the
urge to smoke. They learn new habits and alternative ways to relax
and to deal with problems. ``Then they find that smoking is just
incompatible with this new lifestyle.''
   Many no-smoking programs recognize the connection of smoking and
depression among women by an acronym, HALT (Hungry, Angry, Lonely,
Tired), but Delaney says it's not known whether depression triggers
smoking or if it works the other way around. ``We don't know the
answer to that, but I know that when I want a cigarette, it's an
emotional barometer to me. I ask myself, `What's going on with me?
What's causing this?' ''
   Nearly all no-smoking legislation is negative, she points out,
and it just drives smokers outside into non-restricted places to
smoke. While non-smokers need to defend their rights, they should
appeal to ``sensible behavior'' in dealing with and helping the
smoker, Delaney says. Be firm but understanding. ``If a smoker is
riding with you in your car, stop and ask her to get out of the car
to smoke.''
   At what point does a woman smoker become an ex-smoker? ``I think
that if you can make it through two years without smoking, then you
can consider yourself an ex-smoker. Then, of course, you'll want to
try to lengthen your record.'' _
   ``Women Smokers Can Quit: A Different Approach'' is distributed
primarily through hospital and no-smoking programs, but it can be
ordered by mail for $6.95, including postage. Call 1 (800)
543-3854, or write Women's Healthcare Press, 500 Davis Street,

   Get ready, get set, stop.
   Here are some tips to help you get off cigarettes for good. The
list is based on ``Women Smokers Can Quit: A Different Approach''
(Women's Healthcare Press), by Sue Delaney:
   _ Start by analyzing where, when, why and how much you smoke.
   _ Make a list of the reasons you want to quit. Carry it with you
and look at it for inspiration when you have the urge to smoke.
   _ Get your doctor's help. He may be able to prescribe a nicotine
substitute to help you control your smoking.
   _ If you're afraid of gaining weight, try to modify your eating
before you stop smoking. But don't wait until you lose weight to
begin your no-smoking campaign.
   _ Develop a support network of friends and family who can
provide a sympathetic ear or active help over the long term. Women
with supportive husbands, partners or families have a better chance
to quit than those who don't.
   _ If you enroll in a program, find one that uses multiple
techniques, including behavior modification, long-term support and
followup.
   _ Set a date for quitting and announce it to your support
network. You might even draw up and sign a contract with a friend,
partner or doctor.
   _ The day before quitting, smoke heavily. ``Make yourself really
sick of smoking,'' says Delaney. ``Spill the ashes, look at the
mess, smell the stink.'' Plan a reward to yourself for your first
smoke-free 24 hours. Get rid of your cigarette supply and smoking
apparatus. Make a ceremony of smoking your last cigarette.
   _ On quitting day, change your routine every way you can. Plan
different activities that occupy your hands or mouth _ knitting,
working a crossword puzzle, or chewing gum _ to substitute for
smoking.
   _ Cope with cravings by waiting them out or finding something
else to put in your mouth _ a toothpick, sugarless gum, carrot
sticks or celery.
   _ Practice assertive, direct communications to help head off or
deal with unpleasant emotions that may turn up at this time. If
that's not possible, turn to your support network to vent your
feelings.
   _ Recognize people, places or events that may trigger a relapse.
Then anticipate, alter or avoid them.
   _ Remember that slips or lapses are common and can be followed
by periods of successful abstinence. Look at successive attempts to
stop smoking not as failure but as positive rehearsals for finally
quitting.

   The campaign for no smoking has inspired some quirky news notes,
as culled by Sue Delaney in ``Women Smokers Can Quit: A Different
Approach'' (Women's Healthcare Press):
   _ The island of Capri sued the makers of Capri cigarettes,
saying it doesn't want its name associated with a potentially
harmful product.
   _ Dust from cigarette smoke and ash, when deposited on computer
screens and disks, can garble or ruin your data.
   _ The only neon sign at the Ponderosa Casino in Reno, Nevada,
says ``NO SMOKING.''
   _ Oregon and Utah were the first states to ask doctors to list
on death certificates whether tobacco use contributed to death.
   _ An etiquette expert has declared that lighting a cigarette for
someone else is not good manners. It's the social equivalent of
signing a death warrant.

   Fat is like a secret agent. It slips in
where you don't expect to find it, and you may not recognize it at
all.
   ``There are many surprises. Salted peanuts, for example, are
higher in fat than potato chips,'' says Kay Stanfill, adjunct
professor of clinical dietetics at the University of Oklahoma
Health Sciences Center. ``Croissants have more fat than sweet
rolls. Most margarine contains the same amount of fat as butter.
And avocados, which are technically vegetables, are in the same
category as butter on the fat chart.''
   She says you also may be fooled by grape jelly, colas and honey.
Fattening? Guess again: They contain no fat at all. ``People tend
to confuse sweetness with fat content, while believing that `health
foods' such as sunflower seeds and wheat germ must be low in fat,
when they are not.''
   Oat bran muffins, popular among many health-conscious consumers,
are foolers, too. ``People will force themselves to eat oat bran
muffins to lower their cholesterol, and in reality, most muffin
recipes are very high in fat,'' adds Rachel Barkley, an assistant
professor clinical dietetics at the university.
   More surprises:
   Chicken and fish, while perhaps healthful choices, change their
profiles according to preparation. ``If the chicken and fish are
fried, or if the chicken is cooked with the skin on, fatwise you
are much better off with a hamburger or a lean cut of beef. And
lean pork has even less saturated fat than lean beef,'' says
Barkley.
   Then there are salads. A salad with cheese, croutons and
dressing can contain more fat than a quarter-pound hamburger,
Stanfill says. If you want a truly lean salad, make it with chopped
egg instead of bacon bits or sunflower seeds, which have twice as
much fat.
   They point out that the American Heart Association and the
American Cancer Society both recommend you limit fat intake to
about 30 percent of your calories. To hold the line, they recommend
eating a variety of foods from the four major food groups. Also,
watch both fat and sugar intake through some beverages, sandwich
spreads, some meats, cheeses, chips and desserts which may add
calories but little nutrition. If you must have butter, margarine,
mayonnaise, salad dressings, cheeses and meats, eat them in small
quantities. Include foods with dietary fiber _ fruits, vegetables
and whole grain breads. And choose low-sodium foods, such as fresh
fruits, vegetables, lean meat and poultry.

   If it seems to you that restaurants
are engaged in a conspiracy to undermine your diet resolve, it may
be because you aren't speaking up, says a nutritionist whose
students surveyed restaurants in this area.
   The survey showed that restaurants were ready, willing and able
to make healthful substitutes, says Letitia Mitchell, a Purdue
University nutrition instructor. ``They have to be aware of what
their customers want if they want to compete in the business.
   ``Most restaurants already have diet beverages on the menu,
offer sugar substitutes and decaffeinated coffee _ things like
that.'' But Mitchell says that customers need to make their desires
known.
   She cites some tips from the American Dietetic Association and
the National Center for Nutrition and Dietetics:
   _ Never assume how food is prepared. Ask.
   _ If the serving is too big, leave the excess on your plate. Or
ask for a doggie bag. Or split an entree with someone else.
   _ Request dressings on the side. Dipping a bite of food into the
dressing can let you control the calories.
   _ Ask to have the bread basket served with the meals rather than
before so you won't overeat while waiting for your order.
   _ Ask for vegetables without butter, skinless chicken, and
substitutions of fruit or small green salads for french fries.
   ``Most restaurants offer sherbet as a substitute for ice cream
or offer low-cal gelatin and fresh fruit,'' she adds. ``Or, ask for
a half portion of a more fattening item.''

   Why is it important to be strong and healthy?
   ``So that you can eat and live and so you don't grow up wimpy
and stuff,'' says Jennifer, 9, of Aurora, Colo.
   `` `Cause you don't need a whole bunch of cholesterol and heart
attacks and stuff like that,'' adds Katie, 10, of Memphis.
   Childrens' opinions were sought by Rainbo Bread for publicizing
its Ironkids Program, designed to help youngsters learn about
nutrition, exercise and health. The company's program includes a
series of regional triathlons for youngsters, a ``Path to Health
and Fitness'' lesson plan offered free to teachers, and a IronKids
Club, which entitles its 15,000 members to newsletters with advice
about food, athletics and other issues, along with jacket patches,
posters, and membership cards.
   The program's advisory board cites the prevalance of childhood
obesity _ one in four, or 11 million _ that put children at risk
for heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. ``Inactivity
influences all facets of their health and well-being,'' says Dr.
Liz Applegate of the University of California at Davis, a board
member.
   Or as Ivy, 12, of Dallas puts it: ``Well, be sure and eat at
least some healthy foods and try not to get into the habit of
smoking. And exercise. Try not to get too stressed out. It's really
hard on your heart.'' _
   Another program aimed at children is the Washington Apple
Commission's ``Healthy Choices for Kids,'' a health education
project available to teachers all over the country. The program
encourages classroom discussion of nutrition issues and helps guide
youngsters in their food choices. _
   A handful or two of raw almonds in your diet every day may help
you regulate your level of serum cholesterol, says the Almond Board
of California. The group points to a study by Dr. Gene A, Spiller,
director of Health Research and Studies Center in Los Altos,
Calif., which indicates that monounsaturated fatty acids like those
found in almonds can control or lower cholesterol levels when
substituted for saturated fatty acids in the diet. The board
recommends that the nuts be included in a balanced, low-fat diet. _
   Diet-conscious consumers in New York area suburbs now can order
freshly prepared, calorie-controlled foods that will be delivered
to their home or office doors. Fresh `n Fit, a company based in Mt.
Kisco, N.Y., will serve up such dishes as chicken fajitas, turkey
szechuan or scrod fra diavlo in microwaveable trays, delivered on a
regularly scheduled basis. Meals, which are refrigerated but not
frozen, also will be available at a number of retail stores opening
up in the tri-state area. The company also offers customized
weight-loss counseling which can be integrated with the food plans.

   You don't have to be a kid to straighten out
that smile or your bite. The number of adults wearing braces has
more than doubled in the last ten years, according to the American
Association of Orthodontists.
   Orthodontics go well beyond cosmetic effects, though those are
important psychologically, the organization says. Treatment can
help patients avoid tooth decay, gum disease and tooth loss, and
that usually means less cost in the long run.
   The AAO says that one of the most prevalent problems in adult
teeth is overcrowding, which makes them difficult to clean and
prone to decay. Conversely, open spaces can cause healthy teeth to
tip, with deterioration of supporting bone and consequent looseness
of teeth. Another problem is protruding front teeth, which don't
meet properly while chewing, causing abnormal wear of tooth
surfaces and stress on supporting bone and gum tissue. And then
there are related problems outside the mouth, like disorders of the
temporamandibular joints (TMD) connecting the lower jaw to the
skull, which can cause chronic headaches, earaches and facial pain.
Orthodontics, and sometimes surgery, can alleviate these conditions.
   For treatment, the traditional ``tin-grin'' braces have been
improved on, especially from the adult point of view. Most
orthodontists now are using the more aesthetically pleasing
brackets, bonded directly to teeth and attached to the main arch
wire that moves them. There also are nearly invisible lingual
braces, which are applied to the inside surfaces of the teeth.
Though these are more expensive due to longer wearing time (and
also not applicable to all orthodontic problems), many people
choose them if they feel appearance is important professionally.
Other types include clear or tooth-colored brackets which are less
noticeable than regular braces.
   New technology has brought ``space-age'' wires that are more
flexible and hold a pre-formed shape, often resulting in less
discomfort and shorter treatment time. Also new are tiny magnets
attached to upper or lower molars, which help move teeth by
magnetic force. These may eliminate the need for orthodontic
headgear worn outside the mouth.
   Technology also will help you visualize what you'll look like
after treatment. The AAO is offering a complimentary
computer-imaged likeness that will show a what a re-arranged smile
can do for your appearance. The organization has created a ``Smile
Bank'' of hundreds of smile photogaphs, programming them into a
computer that will combine an appropriate one with your current
photo or video image. Send a clear color photograph _ a closeup
frontal shot with a wide ``toothy'' grin _ along with your name,
address and phone number, to the American Association of
Orthodontists, 460 North Lindbergh Boulevard, St. Louis, Mo. 63141.

<TEXT>
   Biking may be one of America's favorite pastimes,
but without precautions, it can result in head injuries, nerve
damage or impotence.
   More than 500,000 people are injured each year in bicycle
accidents, with about 1,000 dying of their injuries, says Dr.
Michael Chapman, chairman of the American Academy of Orthopaedic
Surgeons Committee on Trauma.
   Bicylists have an even higher incidence of severe head injuries
than motorcyclists, and three out of four such injuries result in
death, he notes.
   Accidents cause the most serious bike injuries, but regular
biking also can cause neuropathy _ a malfunction of the nerves,
says Chapman.
   For example, pressure from the cyclist's grip on the handlebars
can result in neuropathy affecting the hands with numbness,
weakness, pain and lack of coordination, while nerve damage in the
groin area from a poorly adjusted or improperly sized seat can lead
to impotence in men.
   Pressure from the bicycle seat also can cause blood in the
urine, inflammation of the urethra, and irritation of the buttocks.
   Bikers can protect themselves from injury with some basics
recommended by Chapman:
   _ Always wear a helmet with a hard shell.
   _ Wear proper clothing. Bright, reflective clothing makes a
rider more visible at night. Padded gloves and handlebars help
protect the hands from chronic pressure injuries.
   _ Wear shoes and socks. Children, especially, like to ride
barefoot, but many sustain broken or crushed bones and bruises when
their feet get caught in the spokes, whether pedalling or riding on
the back of a bike.
   _ Fit the size of the bike to the rider. When the rider
straddles the bike standing there should be one or two inches of
space between the groin and the bike frame. When the rider sits on
the bike and the right pedal is at its lowest position, the right
knee should be flexed about 10 or 15 degrees.
   _ Drink plenty of water. Constant air movement around the
cyclist evaporates sweat, and that can contribute to dehydration.

   Overenthusiastic exercisers who do aerobics
in tune with music from their personal headphones may be doing
themselves more harm than good, says a Miami University researcher.
   Dr. Helaine Alessio, a Miami assistant professor of physical
education, says oxygen stress from this kind of exercise regime can
damage cells of vulnerable people. In a worst-case scenario, this
could lead to cancer, she says.
   Added to that is the possibility that the diversion of blood and
thus oxygen from the ears can make them more sensitive to noise.
Alessio and Dr. Kathleen Hutchinson, Miami assistant professor of
communications, have discovered significant temporary hearing
losses among exercisers they tested after 10 minutes of exercise
while listening to headphones. While normal hearing returns after
24 hours, repeated episodes can lead to permanent hearing loss,
they say.
   ``Appropriate exercise is the key,'' says Alessio, who is
working on a blood serum test to be used to determine people's
tolerance to oxygen stress. ``Our cells can handle certain stress
levels and still repair themselves, but perhaps the stress
associated with vigorous exercise is too much for some people.
   ``I`m not talking about athletes who go through pain when they
are training hard to excel. I'm talking about the average person
who exercises to reduce weight or stay fit.''

   When it comes to fitness, ``no pain, no gain'' may be not true,
not true.
   Pain is a warning signal and if ignored might mean injury or
other negative medical condition, say the editors of Weight
Watchers magazine.
   They note some other fitness theories they consider fallacies:
   _ ``Muscle turns to fat when you stop exercising.'' A fit
individual who stops exercising may lose muscle mass and put on fat
if food intake is not adjusted accordingly, but this is new fat,
not converted fat.
   _ ``You can `sweat off' excess weight through exercise.'' What
you ``sweat off'' is water; you ``burn off'' excess weight by
exercising and cutting calories.
   _ ``Stretching before a workout is unnecessary.'' On the
contrary, it's one of the most important parts of the workout. It
helps prevent injuries and increases circulation.
   _ ``Never drink while exercising.'' By all means, drink; it's
important to avoid dehydration and overheating during exercise.
Water is preferred, since it is absorbed quicker, won't upset your
stomach and helps the internal cool-down process.

   Americans spent an estimated $5 billion last year on physical
fitness equipment to fight the paunch-and-wheeze war, but about 90
percent of it went into the closet after a short time, equipment
marketers estimate.
   ``People in the 35-to-50 age bracket with yearly incomes of
$50,000 and more want to live to enjoy the money they're making,
and so they invest in equipment and programs,'' says Michael
Simmons, president of California-based Pro-Tec Sports
International, a manufacturer and distributor of recumbent exercise
cycles.
   ``But most of them stop using the equipment regularly because
they bought the wrong device for the wrong purpose. By far, most of
the people who buy sophisticated exercise equipment for home use
should buy health equipment,'' he explains.
   Simmons says industry studies show the majority of such
purchasers are past 40, in essentially sedentary occupations.
   ``They need aerobic exercise for heart and lungs and muscle tone
rather than bulging biceps, but they mistakenly buy $15,000 home
`gyms' designed for anaerobic, lower-oxygen-use workouts,'' says
Simmons.
   ``They infrequently use the equipment, and it doesn't deliver
the vascular conditioning they need, so they stop the program and
store the equipment.''
   The high dropout rate also can be attributed to perceived lack
of time and convenience, soreness and boredom, according to Jim
Warren, a corporate fitness and conditioning consultant.
   ``What most people who say `I'm not an athlete' don't realize is
that it takes what we call `foundational' fitness for the average
man and woman to maintain the energy, overall muscle tone and
freedom from back and other chronic pain to get through 365 days of
work, family life and recreation,'' says Warren, who heads
California-based FitAmerica, Inc.
   Warren agrees with Simmons that changes both in fitness concepts
and equipment are good news.
   ``Physicians who specialize in aerobic exercise dynamics have
scaled down by as much as 70 percent the requirements for effective
workouts,'' Simmons notes.
   He cites an American Medical Association study showing that
individuals as old as 90 can exercise in moderation, maintaining
body and muscle tone through milder isometric resistance exercises
performed for a few minutes every day.

   Adolescent women could be the next major
victims of AIDS unless they change behaviors that predispose them
to risk, say two researchers who have been conducting a study of
health risks among inner-city youths between 18 and 23.
   ``We've got to find a way to get to them, because so far they're
not paying attention,'' says Arlene Rubin Stiffman, a social work
professor at Washington University. ``No matter how much young
people know about AIDS, they are not doing what they need to do to
prevent it.''
   Stiffman and Felton Earls, a behavioral science professor at
Harvard University, discovered that while their study group was
mostly black and mostly female, the high-risk portion of it was
almost evenly divided between whites and blacks and males and
females. That means that a disproportionate percentage of white
youths and women engaged in highest-risk behaviors.
   The professors note that their study, concentrating on
inner-city youths who are demographically at higher risk in the
first place, does not reflect the population at large. ``But it
tips us off that the AIDS epidemic is at a point that it can invade
this age group by the fact that it is showing up even in those who
haven't been considered high risks,'' says Earls.
   Stiffman and Earls found that despite the availability of
brochures and classes about AIDS prevention, the young people
covered in the study didn't seek it out or change their behaviors
until confronted with a pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease.
They think this may be due to the tendency of people in that age
group to feel invulnerable and to the limited possibilities they
perceive in inner-city life. ``The limited life options of many
poor or minority segments of our youthful populations prevent them
from valuing their lives enough to engage in short- or long-term
preventive behaviors,'' says Stiffman. _
   ``Risky Times: How to be AIDS-Smart and Stay Healthy''
(Workman), by Jeanne Blake is aimed at making teen-agers more aware
of the risks and prevention of AIDS. The author, a television
medical reporter in Boston, includes first-person vignettes from
celebrities, from people whose lives are affected by the disease,
along with information about its risks, prevention and consequences
such as discrimination.

   Americans who suffer from seasonal allergies face a tough season
of wheezing and sneezing this fall, according to a nationwide
survey of aeroallergen specialists.
   Extreme weather patterns, including milder winters in the North
and sporadic frosts in the South, have created fertile growing
ground for tree, grass and ragweed allergens, the study indicates.
   Midwesterners face the ``worst ragweed year yet,'' and sufferers
in the Northeast should brace themselves for an intense weed
season, members of the Chlor-Trimeton Allergy Index Panel report.
   The Southwest is expected to have flareups of grass pollens in
the early fall. In the Southeast, frosts last winter destroyed and
delayed tree growth, resulting in an overlap of tree and grass
seasons, which the panel describes as ``a devastating combination.''
   In the Far West, the study predicts a long, severe grass season
extending through October will cause sufferers a good deal of
discomfort.
   An estimated 40 million Americans suffer from allergies, spend
more than $1 billion annually treating their hay fever symptoms,
and lose about 35 million sick days and $800 million in wages, the
panelists note.
   Some suggestions for controlling allergens include:
   _ Keep windows closed at night and use air conditioning, which
cleans, cools and dries the air.
   _ Limit early morning outdoor activity when pollen levels are
highest, and exercise later in the day when pollen levels taper off.
   _ After exercising, wash your hair and hands to clear clinging
allergens.
   _ Take an antihistamine tablet 30 minutes before going outdoors.

   Don't send your cat packing if you're pregnant, says Dr. Warren
M. Crosby of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, who
says concerns about picking up a toxoplasmosis infection from your
pet may be overrated.
   ``Toxoplasmosis is transmitted through two avenues _ raw meat
and cat feces. Cats get the disease from eating infected animals,
usually rodents,'' he says.
   Once a person has been infected, he or she becomes immune, and a
pregnant woman will pass this immunity on to her unborn child.
However, if a non-immune pregnant woman comes into contact with the
disease, there is a 10 percent chance her child will pick it up and
suffer from birth defects such as deafness, mental retardation,
impeded brain development _ but not limb deformity _ according to
Crosby.
   He advises pregnant women who own cats to let someone else
change the cat litter box. Otherwise, there is little risk of
contact through the cat, since this fastidious animal washes itself
frequently. ``Indoor cats are generally safer than outdoor cats,
because they have had less exposure to infected animals. However,
with an outdoor cat, the odds are greater that the woman already
has been exposed to the organism and has built up an immunity.'' He
recommends that women planning to become pregnant have blood tests
for the disease for herself and her pet. _
   Homes where cats have never lived and public places where cats
are not welcome can nevertheless be irritating to the more than 8
million Americans who are allergic to them, says an allergy
specialist.
   This is because cat allergen, which triggers the asthmatic and
allergic misery, remains potent long after it has left the cat,
says Dr. Jeffrey Miller, whose study was recently reported to the
American Academy of Allergy and Immunology.
   ``In the past, the classic prescription for those suffering from
cat allergies was `get rid of the cat','' Miller says. ``But now
that we know that cat allergen clings to carpets and mattresses for
months, even years, after the cat has departed, the emphasis has to
be on reducing or eliminating the allergen.''
   One way is to wash the cat regularly, he says. He adds that
experiments have shown that allergen levels can be dramatically
reduced if carpets are sprayed with a 3 percent tannic acid
solution.

   Some graduates at Bowling Green State
University will have one extra selling point as they enter the job
market: A certificate that says they are physically fit, have
healthy lifestyles and therefore will cost a company less money in
health care costs.
   To get a Fit For Hire certificate, students must pass tests for
cholesterol levels, blood pressure, body composition, aerobic
fitness and lifestyle analysis. Preparation includes a meeting with
Dr. Richard Bowers, fitness director of the university's Student
Recreation Center, where a senior student may start an
individualized fitness program which might include exercise, a
diet, or help in breaking a cigarette habit.
   Students who pass all fitness tests receive a gold certificate
they can show to prospective employers. Others who don't meet all
standards get a silver certificate, which states they understand
the significance of fitness in the workplace. Those who do not pass
have the option of continuing their fitness programs and trying
again.
   The university points to studies that show that a physically fit
employee can save a company as much as $1,000 a year, reflecting
lower health care costs and less absenteeism. These employees are
also less likely to smoke, abuse drugs or alcohol, and are more
likely to use seat belts when driving _ all factors in reducing the
chances of illness and injury.
   JoAnn Kroll, director of the university's placement service,
says that she knows many recruiters from large corporations take
fitness seriously, since health care is one of the fastest rising
costs in business. ``They are very wellness and fitness oriented,
and we believe that they look more favorably upon students whom
they believe are better health risks. They seem to be genuinely
impressed with Fit For Hire program.''
   Bowers observes that while the certificate may give students an
edge in the job hunt, it also gets them thinking about the need for
physical activity and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

   The emotional fitness of employees is one of the growing
concerns of U.S. companies, according to an specialist in the field.
   ``Employees don't leave their personal concerns at home,'' says
Margaret Koepp, a clinical director for Managed Health Network, a
Los Angeles-based mental health benefits firm. ``Whether it's their
own financial situation, a child with a learning difficulty, their
elderly parent who needs home health care or a sibling in another
state who's abusing drugs, these problems weigh on them. They force
workers' attention away from their jobs and cause them to be less
productive.''
   Koepp says one of the results of corporate management's growing
awareness of employees' emotional concerns is a dramatic increase
in ``hot lines.''
   According to Koepp, companies are recognizing the value of hot
lines which employees can call when experiencing crisis or life
management problems.
   ``Very often,'' Koepp says, ``companies will tell us that an
outstanding employee might have quit or been fired if he had not
been able to call us and receive help to overcome the problem.''
   Koepp, whose company has a 24-hour Warm Line which provides
clinical assessments for troubled employees, says that the number
of companies providing these services is increasing dramatically.

   Napoleon Bonaparte and Thomas Edison were ``short'' sleepers.
   Albert Einstein was a ``long'' sleeper.
   Not everyone needs the same amount of sleep, says a University
of Rochester sleep disorders specialist _ and not everyone needs
eight hours of sleep a night.
   Yet, says Dr. Donald Greenblatt, ``the great majority of adults
sleep between seven and nine hours, and there is evidence that
people who fall within this range live longer than those who sleep
fewer, or more, hours.''
   Napoleon and Edison, Greenblatt says, needed only four to six
hours of sleep; Einstein often slept 14 to 16 hours.
   The sleepiest creatures on Earth, says the sleep doctor, are
sloths, bats and armadillos, which doze as much as 20 hours of the
day. Horses function well on five hours, and giraffes and elephants
sleep only four hours, he says.
   His advice for the most restful sleep:
   _ Keep a regular schedule, getting up and retiring at about the
same time each day.
   _ Exercise in the late afternoon; exercising too close to
bedtime may keep you awake.
   _ Sleep in a cool, quiet room.
   _ Don't take sedatives or alcohol before bed. Though they may
cause you to fall asleep sooner in the short run, they can cause
``rebound'' insomnia when their effect wears off.
   _ Sleep only until refreshed.

   Aerobic exercise is more crucial to an older person than a
younger one because the activity counters many problems of old age,
says a New Jersey doctor.
   According to Dr. Howard Liss, chief of rehabilitation medicine
at Englewood Hospital, three 20-to-30-minute aerobic workouts a
week can lower cholesterol, reduce depression, help sleep and
strengthen the immune system.
   He cautions, however, that older people should modify their
exercise to reduce stress to their bodies. No basketball or
football, for instance.
   Aerobic activities he recommends include:
   _ Doubles tennis.
   _ Cycling, on a bicycle with upright handle bars.
   _ Walking on a treadmill pitched slightly uphill, or around an
outdoor track with a soft surface.
   _ Lap swimming.

   The elderly are finding insurance for
long-term health care becoming easier to buy but not necessarily
easier to collect, says a University of Michigan health insurance
specialist.
   A study conducted in several states in 1988-89 showed that
``very few of the long-term care policies offered were likely to
produce a better than 50-50 chance of a benefit payout,'' reports
William Weissert, professor of health care management and policy at
the university's School of Public Health.
   ``Given these odds, savvy consumers should look long and hard
before they settle on a policy.''
   More than a million long-term care policies have been sold by
more than 100 companies since the mid-1980s, Weissert notes.
   He says that market is likely to increase because the dependent
elderly population, which needs help with daily tasks like bathing,
dressing and eating, is expected to double in the next 12 years.
   Weissert points out that Medicare and traditional medical
insurance cover virtually no long-term nursing home costs, which
average about $25,000 a year for basic care.
   More than 50 percent of the nation's elderly are likely to enter
a nursing home, he says, and if they stay for more than three
months, they are unlikely ever to leave.
   ``Only 20 percent of nursing home residents staying more than 90
days survive the stay,'' he says.
   He advises people considering buying a long-term care policy to
shop around, since policies offering the same kinds of coverage
range from $550 to $1,200 annually.
   The real reason people buy long-term care policies, he says, is
to protect their estates so their children and grandchildren can
inherit them.
   ``So I think the children should pay the premium,'' he adds.
``Not everyone will agree with that, of course.''
   Since some policies have benefit periods that last only three or
four years, Weissert says, buyers should select a policy with the
maximum number of benefit years they can find.
   Consideration also should be given to buying a policy that does
not require a patient to have been hospitalized before entering a
nursing home, he says.
   Of those policies that do require prior hospitalization, he
cautions, many require that patients enter the nursing home between
14 and 30 days after they are released from the hospital.
   ``Some even require direct transfer from hospital to nursing
home,'' Weissert says. ``Consumers should look for the longest
grace period between hospital and nursing home they can find
because it will give the family more time to look for the right
nursing home.''

   Eating Well, a national consumer magazine on food and health,
offered its first issue in July.
   ``Our intention,'' says publisher James M. Lawrence, ``is for
this to be a magazine that one reads out of fascination and
pleasure, not guilt. We think it should appeal to men and women
with an uncommon curiosity about and love of good food, inspiring
them to try new foods and new recipes, to strive for nutritional
wellness without sacrificing the sensual pleasures of cooking and
eating well.''
   The first issue featured ``Something Fishy at the Seafood
Counter,'' a look at the seafood industry. _
   Reader's Digest launched the ``American Medical Association Home
Medical Library'' this summer as part of a planned 18-volume series
concerning health and medicine.
   Each volume will treat a different topic _ diagnosing disease,
the heart, nutrition, drugs and the battle against infection _ and
will be sold by direct mail. The first in the series is ``Practical
Family Health.'' _
   The complexities of filing claims for health care coverage can
be bewildering for many, and they may not collect what they're
entitled to, says the owner of a service to help patients or their
relatives sort out claims paperwork.
   ``When a claimant is ill, paperwork is the last thing on his
mind.'' says Serena Kalker, who started Medical Claims Assistance
Co. in Brooklyn, N.Y., when she discovered that many clients of her
husband's accounting firm were overwhelmed by the claims process.
   ``Many claimants just give up. So they pay huge medical bills.
Meanwhile, the funds which are intended to reimburse them _
coverage they have paid for and to which they are entitled _ go
uncollected.''
   She says her service, with fees based on a percentage of
recoveries, helps consumers avoid ``unexpected traps'' that can
cost them money through lost or unqualified claims. ``We try to
make sure that the individual doesn't cheat himself by filing
overlapping claims that allow insurors to sidestep their
responsibilities,'' she says. _
   You're not goofing off. You're resting your eyes when you stare
off into space, says the American Optometric Association. And it's
a good idea to take a staring break for 10 minutes every hour or
two you're occupied with eye-intensive activities such as using a
computer, reading, watching television or playing video games.
   The association also advises using eye safety equipment for
sports such as tennis, softball, or baseball or for home projects
like cleaning and gardening. Also recommended are maximum
protection sunglasses that block 75 to 90 percent of the light,
which can help prevent cataracts and damage to the inside lining of
the eye. Other eye protection tips include keeping room lighting
soft but using lamps for reading, sewing, preparing food and other
projects. Task lighting should be no more than three times brighter
than the general room light. And cut room lighting in half for
computer areas. _
   Protect your ears, too. Noise is one of the biggest culprits in
premature hearing loss, but you can take some simple measures to
minimize it, according to the E-A-R Group of Cabot Corp., which
makes soft foam earplugs and other protective devices. Close
windows when noisy construction work is going on in your
neighborhood. Don't sit too closely to the speakers at amplified
concerts. Keep stereos and television volume at a reasonable level.
These tips and other information, including warning signs of
hearing loss, are in their booklet, ``A Helpful Guide to Ear
Protection.'' For a copy, write the company at 5457 West 79th
Street, Indianapolis Ind. 46268. _
   Many Americans are totally edentulous and a growing number are
trying osseointegration.
   In plain language, that means 42 percent of Americans over 65
are without teeth, and many are opting for oral implant surgery
rather than conventional dentures.
   According to a national survey conducted by the American
Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, the use of oral
implants has almost tripled in the past five years and is expected
to climb.
   Difficulties in denture retention and chewing were the most
important reasons patients chose implant surgery, the study found.
   Other reasons included mouth irritation from dentures,
inadequate support from existing teeth for bridgework, and
difficulty in speaking.
   Most of the maxillofacial surgeons surveyed said they have
performed implant surgery on patients as young as the mid-20s.
   ``These findings show that missing teeth are not unique to the
older population,'' says Dr. Gerald Laboda, the association
president.
   ``In appearance, form and stability, oral implants are the
closest thing modern science has to natural teeth. Oral implants
bond to the existing bone structure of the mouth, thus eliminating
the instability, chewing difficulty and irritation many denture
wearers endure.'' _
   Barnyard chores, such as feeding chickens and playing with pygmy
goats, are being used in therapy programs for head-injured patients.
   ``Animal therapy offers a unique method ot treatment because it
uses a living, responsive stimulus in treating the physically and
mentally impaired,'' says Dr. James Wasco, medical director of the
New Medico Head Injury System, a nationwide network of
rehabilitation facilities.
   ``Techniques used for the elderly and neglected children are now
being expanded for head-injured individuals.''
   The barnyard program is used at the organization's Lindale,
Texas, facility, while equestrian therapy programs help
head-injured patients at facilities in Center Ossipee, N.H., and
Canonsburg, Pa. Riding horses and petting and caring for them are
both offered in the therapy.
   ``For both children and adults, caring for an animal increases
self-confidence because the individual is responsible for the
animal's well-being,'' Wasco notes.

   Why do some people live to be 100?
   ``I have nothing to do with this getting old,'' protested Mary
Wallace, 106, a child of slaves in Georgia who raised white
children as well as her own family of nine.
   Here's the secret from Palmina Canovi, 101: ``We're so old
because we haven't died yet.''
   Author Jim Heynen and photographer Paul Boyer spent 1987 through
1989 traveling the United States and Canada to talk with
centenarians about their lives.
   The result is ``One Hundred Over 100,'' a book of interviews
with 100 North Americans in their second century of life.
   Heynen, 49, got the idea for the book while jogging and thinking
about aging. Boyer, 45, joined later to take the black-and-white
portraits that accompany each brief interview.
   ``I think most people do not respond well to old people. ...
Most people equate growing old with growing sickly,'' Heynen said
in a joint interview with Boyer recently.
   ``May this book diminish your fear of aging,'' he wrote in the
introduction.
   The 100 subjects are not a representative sample of the 54,000
Americans that the U.S. Census Bureau estimates will be at least
100 years old in 1990.
   Heynen sent news releases to about 100 newspapers seeking
nominees for the book. He also sought out minority centenarians.
   The interviewees include 10 blacks, two Hispanics, three
American Indians, and three Japanese-Americans. Some of the
remaining whites were immigrants. Women outnumber men by 3-to-2.
   Still, there is something of all of us in each of them, the
authors found.
   Some had survived cancer, bad hearts and life-threatening
diseases. Many married several times and divorced. Some smoked and
drank. Some broke all family records for longevity. Some were
worrywarts. Some loved salt.
   The authors also found that many of the men were Masons. Two
bald men began growing their hair back after age 100.
   The longest-lived group were single women without children, but
common traits appeared to be no children or one child, a careful
diet all their lives, and a lot of caring for others, both
relatives and strangers, Heynen said.
   ``Many of these people have lived altruistic lives,'' Heynen
said.
   Many attributed their long lives to hard work, but that didn't
always mean physical labor. Heynen and Boyer often took it as, ``I
was seldom bored.''
   David Kane, a 102-year-old painter whose portrait of Henry Clay
Folger, founder of Standard Oil, hangs in the Folger Library in
Washington, D.C., is the Greater Miami American Heart Association's
leading door-to-door fund-raiser. Kane has died since the book was
published.
   Rosa Mae Wolfe, who never married, was involved all her life in
church work in Idaho and helped found Boise Bible College.
   Kisa Iseri, 102, a Japanese immigrant in Ontario, Ore., is a
busy gardener. She grew marijuana 20 years ago without knowing what
it was, and her daughter used it to improve the flavor of sukiyaki.
   About 40 of the interviewees were in nursing homes. Others lived
with relatives, but some were still on their own.
   Meeting the centenarians caused Heynen to stop smoking and
drinking, and Boyer to give up coffee. They also learned to savor
life more.
   ``Knowing you could die any moment gives the sense of living for
the moment,'' Boyer said of the centenarians. ``We didn't start
imitating their lifestyles. Where we did change was in being at
peace with the moment.''

   Suppose you're an elderly man living alone and
using an electric wheelchair. Financial difficulties force you to
pawn the chair, but you can't move without it. What do you do?
   Imagine you're an elderly woman living alone and a salesman
knocks on your door, saying one of your friends referred him. He
comes in, describes the product, and you say you're not interested.
But instead of leaving, he stays for hours until you sign a
contract and buy the product. Now what?
   In Arizona, you can call the Elder Abuse Project. These
situations happened, and project staff members or volunteers found
remedies.
   Of 3.7 million Arizona residents, nearly 468,000 are 65 or
older, the Arizona Center on Population Statistics estimates. The
center says that total grows by an estimated 250,000 during winters.
   About four years ago, Attorney General Bob Corbin and his chief
assistants noticed the number of cases involving financial
exploitation of the elderly was growing, says project director
Anita O'Riordan. The project was developed to help attorneys and
investigators prosecute such cases and to help the victims. It has
evolved into a broader community service.
   In the wheelchair case, the man tried to retrieve his chair from
the pawn shop but learned it had been sold. The project persuaded
the pawn shop to locate another electric wheelchair for him.
   In the other case, the woman told the abuse project that a
carpet cleaning salesman had come to her home and stayed seven
hours. During that time, he sold her an expensive ``vacuum system''
she couldn't use.
   The woman suffered from a heart condition and was so upset by
the salesman's visit that she spent the night in a hospital
emergency room. When she returned home, she was told by the carpet
cleaning company that she was too late to cancel the contract. That
contract included a lien on her home if she failed to make payments
on the system.
   Ms. O'Riordan contacted the company's headquarters in another
state. The company refunded nearly $2,000 to the woman and released
her from the contract.
   Situations like these happen all the time, and not only to older
people, Ms. O'Riordan said.
   But older people are more likely to become victims because they
are more trusting, she said. Many grew up in small towns where
everybody knew everybody else, and a handshake was enough.
   ``Even after they've been taken ... they'll say something like,
`I can't believe he would do that, he looked so nice,' '' said Jack
Confer of the project staff.
   Among other cases were:
   _ Alleged fraudulent sales of fiberglass burial containers
totaling about $550,000. A man was charged in April with violating
the Arizona Consumer Fraud Act.
   _ A Phoenix man pleaded guilty in May in connection with
fraudulent sales of energy-saving products. Under the plea
agreement, he will be liable for restitution to victims. The
investigation was triggered by a complaint to the project.
   The office also sometimes prosecutes physical abuse cases. Those
cases are referred first to either the Department of Health
Services or Adult Protective Services, but the agencies may refer a
case back to the Elder Abuse Project.
   A case usually starts with project and ends with the project,
which can prosecute physical abuse as either a criminal or civil
case, Confer said.
   The project has three full-time paid staff members, plus an
average of 35 volunteers a year. The $82,000 in salaries and other
costs are covered within the attorney general's budget.
   Some people bring their complaints to the project. Others use
its ``Fraudline'' phone number. Additionally, volunteers travel to
senior centers throughout the state.
   After someone contacts the project, a volunteer assists in
preparing a complaint for the project's files. If the matter
involves an individual or company licensed by a state agency, the
elder is assisted in filing a complaint with that agency.
   Project staff members and volunteers work to clarify issues in
the case, verify facts and obtain documentation. They may consult
experts.
   The staff then may try to resolve the complaint through
mediation, or it may be referred to the appropriate division of the
attorney general's office.
   Volunteers also speak at crime prevention meetings arranged in
response to community or group requests.
   Under the project's BEEP system, for Beware of Elderly
Exploitation Program, volunteers are trained to speak to community
groups about health quackery, financial exploitation, and how not
to be a victim. The project also offers a brochure: ``Consumer
Protection Kit: An Older Person's Guide.''

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Louisiana, barely able to balance its
budget each year, may be the only state that does not finance a
program to curb abuse of the elderly.
   An estimated 1.5 million older Americans, or 5 percent of all
elderly, are abused each year, up from 1 million in 1980, according
to a congressional report. Only one in eight cases is reported,
according to estimates.
   Information was not available from 10 states in the 1989 survey
for the U.S. House Select Committee on Aging. Of the other 40, only
Louisiana provided no money for Adult Protective Services.
   A program still exists under state law, but the money ran out in
1988 and has not been included in the state budget since.
   It's not that nobody wants to provide money for adult
protection. Gov. Buddy Roemer included $1.4 million for the program
in his proposed budget for the fiscal year that started July 1.
   However, the Legislature couldn't reach a consensus on numerous
Roemer tax proposals, and lawmakers found themselves having to trim
hundreds of millions of dollars in programs in the session's final
hours.
   They salvaged an $85 million teacher pay raise _ part of a
three-year commitment that was among Roemer's highest priorities.
But they couldn't save numerous other programs, including Adult
Protective Services.
   An APS office would check out complaints of abuse or reports of
adults unable, because of age or other reasons, to take care of
themselves, said Brenda Kelly of the state Department of Social
Services.
   If the reports were valid, the office could then refer the
victim or the victim's loved ones to the proper government or
private agency.
   Police and local councils on aging _ the offices that run
federal- and state-financed programs for old people _ do what they
can, Kelly said.
   ``But when you look at law enforcement and councils on aging,
they're pretty stretched,'' she said.
   Mike Edwards, administrative director of the Jefferson Parish
Council on Aging, agrees.
   ``There is a need out there for it. We have the legislation on
the books. The authority to investigate lies with Adult Protective
Services workers,'' he said. ``There's nothing we can do. We're
strapped.''
   Re-establishing an Adult Protective Services system would give
the public a single place to call to report abuse and neglect
problems, Kelly said.
   ``Relying on information from local councils on aging, I think
what's missing is that front-end piece _ some central place that
the public can call and have someone look into it,'' she said.
   When the money ran out in 1988, 12 people were working Adult
Protective Services cases statewide, Kelly said. Often those people
also were working on programs protecting children, too.
   The total monthly case load for Adult Protective Services staff
members from June 1985 through June 1988 averaged more than 800,
Kelly said.
   The $1.4 million Kelly had hoped would be available this year
would have paid for a staff of 44 that would have concentrated
efforts in 12 of the state's more populous parishes, which are
Louisian's equivalent of counties.

<HEAD>Avoiding Problems of the Summer Heat and Sun</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Dr. T. Franklin Williams</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For many people summer is the time for
swimming, sailing, picnics and outdoor recreation. However, summer
heat and sun can be treacherous.
   Older people should be wary of food poisoning and heat strokes,
two potentially fatal illnesses associated with summer.
   These days, most people do not give much thought to food
posoning. Modern methods to preserve food and retard bacteria
should make the food we eat safe. Bacteria such as salmonella,
botulism, staphylococcus and campylobacter are presumed to be fears
of a former generation.
   In fact, most people would be surprised to learn that about 2
million cases of food poisoning occur each year in this country due
to improper handling of food in the home.
   Food poisoning can become epidemic at picnics or other events
where food is left unrefrigerated for a long time, when power
outages cause refrigerators to shut down, and from canning
procedures that fail to kill bacteria.
   Older people are especially vulnerable to foodborne illness
because they are more likely to have medical problems that lower
their resistance.
   Further, many people experience sensory losses that affect food
handling. Older people with impaired vision, for example, may have
problems recognizing spoiled food or dirty utensils.
   Diminished taste and smell also may be significant in
determining if food is spoiled. Older people who live on a fixed
income may be wary of throwing food away. And, in order to hold
utility bills down, refrigerators often are kept above the
recommended 40 degrees.
   The following precautions can eliminate most sources of bacteria
and prevent food poisoning:
   _ Refrigerate food at 40 degrees; freeze it at 0 degrees
Fahrenheit.
   _ Freeze raw meat and poultry that will not be used within two
days.
   _ To thaw food, place it in the refrigerator, not on the
counter, where bacteria can grow quickly.
   _ Make sure food and utensils are clean.
   _ Wash hands with soap and water before preparing food.
   _ Cook food thoroughly, including food prepared in a microwave.
Avoid recipes that call for raw eggs or raw fish.
   _ Freeze or refrigerate leftovers promptly.
   _ Never leave a perishable food out of the refrigerator for more
than two hours.
   Symptoms of food poisoning include diarrhea, abdominal pain and
nausea. Sometimes it is accompanied by fever and general discomfort.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture has established a toll-free
number to respond to consumer questions about safe handling of meat
and poultry. Call 1-800-535-4555 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays
for information on proper food handling.
   Heat exhaustion and heat stroke are other potentially dangerous
conditions associated with hot weather. Many people become
needlessly ill each year because they do not take simple,
preventive steps.
   Heat exhaustion is a warning that the body is getting too hot.
Symptoms include thirst, giddiness, weakness, nausea and profuse
sweating. If not attended to, heat exhaustion can develop into a
more serious condition known as heat stroke.
   Older people are especially vulnerable to heat-related
illnesses. Changes that can effect a person's ability to cope with
heat include inefficient sweat glands, poor circulation and changes
in the skin.
   Frail older people who cannot move easily to a cooler place or
who are not aware of the heat also are in jeopardy.
   Some medications such as diuretics, sedatives and tranquilizers,
and certain heart and blood pressure drugs, may affect the way an
individual copes with heat. Don't discontinue medication, but
discuss potential problems with a doctor.
   Diseases that require special diets also may make a person more
vulnerable to heat stroke. People with high blood pressure, for
example, generally reduce the amount of salt in their diet, making
temperature regulation more difficult. However, a person should not
take salt tablets without consent of a doctor.
   Avoid heat exhaustion and heat stroke by following some simple
steps:
   _ Drink plenty of water and juices.
   _ Wear light-weight, light-colored and loose-fitting clothing.
   _ Avoid activity during the hottest part of the day.
   _ Keep meals simple and light. Keep oven use to a minimum.
   _ Use air-conditioners liberally or, if none is available, plan
trips to cool places such as shopping malls, theaters and libraries.
   Anyone suspected of suffering heat stroke should receive
immediate attention. Victims of heat stroke have a body temperature
of 104 degrees or higher. The pulse may be rapid.
   Other symptoms may include flushed skin, a faint feeling,
confused and bizarre behavior and combativeness. If symptoms are
mild, get into a cool place, drink non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated
fluids, and sponge off with cool water or take a cool bath or
shower.
   If symptoms are severe, get emergency medical assistance
immediately. Without quick attention heat stroke is frequently
deadly, especially for older people.

<HEAD>Pepper Commission Urges New Aid for Elderly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New help for the poorest elderly and
improvements for those who buy private insurance to supplement
Medicare coverage are being urged by the U.S. Bipartisan Commission
on Comprehensive Health Care.
   Known as the Pepper Commission in honor of the late Rep. Claude
Pepper, a champion of the elderly, the panel said implementation of
the recommendations would close gaps in Medicare that ``expose the
elderly to considerable financial risk'' and may result in their
receiving less health care.
   The recommendations are intended to complete the commission's
set of proposals for a comprehensive national policy designed to
provide adequate health care and long-term care for all Americans.
   The newest proposals would:
   _ Help the poorest elderly pay premiums, deductibles and
co-payments required under Medicare. The commission said this would
require $2.6 billion in additional federal spending if implemented
this year.
   _ Expand Medicare to cover certain preventative services,
including tests for cancer and prostate screening. Estimated yearly
cost: $200 million.
   _ End or reduce abuses in private insurance coverage by creating
federal standards for ``Medigap'' insurance.
   The standards would include requiring insurers to pay out a
higher proportion of their premium revenue as benefits; bar
insurers from refusing to sell insurance to anyone based on health
standards and develop simpler and easier to understand premium
language to be standard for each company.
   _ Establish registries of Medigap policies to minimize
duplication of coverage.

<HEAD>`Real Life Poverty' Affects Millions, Foundation Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The official U.S. government poverty line
understates the number of Americans who live in poverty, a report
by the Families USA Foundation says.
   The report estimated that 45 million people live in ``real life
poverty'' in the United States, significantly higher than the 32
million counted by the government.
   The report also said that by its standards, the poor are more
likely to be white, older and better-educated than government
figures would indicate.
   The report is based on an analysis of 3,511 responses to four
Gallup polls conducted between July and October 1989.
   People were asked what income they would use as a poverty line
for a family of four in their communities. The average response was
$15,017 a year compared to the government's official poverty line
of $12,092.
   Ron Pollack, the foundation's president, contended the
government poverty line is based on an arbitrary and outdated
formula.
   ``The real life poverty line is rooted in the experience of
America's consumers who know the real costs they have to pay to
purchase the essential necessities of life,'' Pollack said.

   As a child, Tom Flatley was separated from his
parents and placed with his brother in a Missouri home for the
retarded, mentally ill and criminally insane _ even though both
children were normal in all respects.
   Flatley, now 79, who suffered ``environmental retardation''
because of his surroundings, has returned to the same institution
as a volunteer, working with children who need help.
   Flatley is a part of Foster Grandparents, a low-key, relatively
inexpensive government program that pairs low-income elderly people
with children in need.
   Foster Grandparents is celebrating its 25th anniversary this
summer and Flatley and 27 of his colleagues from programs around
the country were welcomed to the White House by President Bush and
his wife, Barbara, to mark the occasion.
   Over the last quarter-century, since President Johnson signed
enabling legislation on Aug. 28, 1965, 400,000 Foster Grandparents
have offered cheer and a ready ear to millions of children.
   Today, there are 27,000 Foster Grandparents, ages 60 to 100.
   Each is paid a stipend of $2.20 an hour for 20 hours of work
each week. Some get assistance with transportation and meals, and
each is eligible for a free yearly physical checkup. Sixty is the
minimum eligible age. An income near the poverty line also is a
requirement.
   The volunteers serve some 79,000 children with special needs in
275 programs in every state, the District of Columbia and Puerto
Rico. The program's budget last year was $58 million.
   Foster Grandparents are found in halfway houses, schools, Head
Start facilities, drug abuse rehabilitation centers, foster homes,
juvenile detention centers and homes for unwed mothers.
   The children they help may be blind, deaf, or retarded; they may
be emotionally disturbed, or suffer from drug or alcohol abuse,
parental neglect or abuse, learning disorders or any combination of
conditions.
   Some are ``boarder babies,'' abandoned at birth and cared for at
hospitals.
   Many were born to addicted parents and suffer the inherited
effects of alcohol or drug abuse. Many are AIDS babies, born to a
parent who has the disease.
   ``Some of these situations are not in any way easy,'' says Nancy
Yde, public affairs director for ACTION, the federal domestic
volunteer agency that directs the Foster Grandparents program.
   She said one Foster Grandparent is working with an emotionally
disturbed child who killed her father, saying she did so because he
had killed her mother.
   At the White House ceremony, Mrs. Bush said the need is growing
for older people with ``precious gifts to exchange with the
children of this world.''
   Mrs. Bush said William Bennett, head of the U.S. government's
war against drugs, told her that more Foster Grandeparents are
needed than ever before ``because unfortunately the boarder babies
and the other babies that need you are multiplying.''
   Tom Flatley says he talks to the mentally retarded children with
whom he works and reads them stories.
   ``They can do for themselves a little bit, but I help them
along,'' he says. ``One little boy can walk a little, with help.
   ``The other child I have doesn't respond at all; but he still
needs someone to love him,'' Flatley told ACTION for a profile
written about his work. ``Children all over the country need
someone to love them and I am going to do my part.''

   Share prices plummeted Monday on London's Stock
Exchange as worries over increasing oil prices gripped the market.
   At midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was down 60.4 points, or 2.6 percent, at 2,224.2.
   Volume was 377.6 million shares at midday, compared with 290.3
million shares at the same time Friday.
   The rapidly rising oil price has sparked fears of low economic
growth plus inflation in the British economy, which already has
been under pressure from the government's high interest rate
policy, dealers said.
   Most of the share price declines came from markdowns by market
makers. Few investors were entering the market, dealers said.

   The convulsions continued on Wall Street this
morning where stock prices plunged in the wake of setbacks on
foreign markets.
   Worries about the economic impact of the Persian Gulf crisis and
resulting oil price spiral caused investors to bail out of stocks
in a big way earlier in Tokyo, London and elsewhere.
   Circuit breakers designed to cushion market declines were
tripped by early activity in stocks and stock index futures, the
New York Stock Exchange said. A ``sidecar'' computer file had
assumed the role of handling computer-driven program trades.
   After the first 30 minutes of trading, the Dow Jones average of
30 blue chips was off about 85 points at 2,724.
   Most of the stocks included in the most widely watched U.S.
market barometer were delayed in opening due to imbalances between
sell and buy orders. But by 10 a.m. EDT, 27 issues had opened.
   Declining issues took a huge lead over advances on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,083 down, 144 up and 199 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board amounted to 36.04 million
shares.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
4.12 to 184.70.
   Meanwhile, at the American Stock Exchange the market value index
lost 4.81 to 341.82.
   U.S. stocks, already weakened by concerns about U.S. economic
health, have been battered by speculation that sharply higher oil
prices could trigger a recession accompanied by rising inflation.
   A few stocks, particularly oil and gold issues, benefited from
the situation. Exxon added 1&rsqb; to 54{ and was the most active issue
on the Big Board with volume of nearly half a million shares.
   Texaco rose 2&rsqb; to 67, Chevron gained 1\ to 80, Mobil moved up 1|
to 68{ and Amoco jumped 1&rsqb; to 58~.

Telephone &amp; Telegraph skidded 1{ to 34{.
   Market watchers had expected stocks to get off to a rocky start
in the United States.
   Earlier, the Toykyo market's Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues closed at 28,599.53 points, down 916.23 points, or
3.1 percent, on trading of an estimated 330 million shares. On the
London market at midday, the Financial Times-100-share index was
down about 60.4 points, or about 2.6 percent, to 2,224.2.
   Eugene Peroni, director of technical research at Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia, said ``I think it's going to
be pretty rough.''
   But he said that ``later in the session we'll see the market
begin to turn.''
   On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than
100 points early on and then recovered some of its loss, ending the
day off 54.95 points at 2,809.65. The average lost 88.86 points in
the week.
   Losers swamped gainers in nationwide trading of NYSE-listed
stocks. Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 5 to 1
with 264 up, 1,457 down and 305 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board reached a 1990 high of
292.36 million shares, up from 253.09 million in the previous
session.
   The NYSE's composite index tumbled 3.54 to 188.82.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index slumped
5.52 to 346.63.

   Oil prices rose more than $3 a barrel today after
Japan and the European Community joined other nations in halting
imports of Iraqi oil to protest the invasion of Kuwait. China
halted weapons sales to Iraq.
   Australia's government today banned oil imports from Iraq and
Kuwait and defense sales to Iraq, revoking an export license for
the sale of $680,000 worth of engine components to the Iraqi air
force.
   The spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded
international crude oil, was $26.59 a barrel in London this
morning, up from Friday's closing price of $23.48.
   In early trading today on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
September contract for West Texas Intermediate _ the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude _ was trading at $26.75 a 42-gallon barrel, up
$2.26 from Friday's close.
   The rising prices led to fears of inflation, and stock prices
fell in Tokyo, London and the United States.
   Japan, which imports 99 percent of its oil, announced Sunday it
would stop importing Iraqi oil. It also imposed an embargo on oil
from Kuwait, which Iraq seized Thursday.
   Japan's prime minister, Toshiki Kaifu, said today that 142 days
worth of oil reserves should cushion the impact for Japan.
Nevertheless, the Tokyo Stock Exchange took a sharp tumble. The
Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at 28,599.53
points, down 916.23 points, or 3.1 percent.
   In London at midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was down 60.4 points, or 2.6 percent, at 2,224.2.
   On Wall Street, the closely watched Dow Jones industrial
averaged plunged around 93 points to the 2,716 level in the first
half hour of trading.
   In Beijing, Premier Li Peng reiterated China's opposition to
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and said Beijing supports the U.N.
Security Council resolution condemning the invasion and demanding
an immediate pullout.
   ``Under such circumstances, it is only natural that China will
not sell arms to Iraq,'' he said.
   Western intelligence reports indicate China has sold billions of
dollars worth of arms to Iraq, including Silkworm missiles, but
Beijing has denied supplying weapons.
   The Soviet Union and France, Iraq's main arms suppliers, halted
weapons sales to Baghdad last week.
   The governments of France, Italy and Spain declared Sunday they
would follow EC guidelines and impose sanctions voted by that group
Saturday. Sanctions include oil embargoes, freezing of Kuwaiti and
Iraqi assets, and ending preferential trade agreements with Baghdad.
   This significantly broadened the campaign to punish Baghdad.
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in Washington that
President Bush welcomed Tokyo's decision.
   Such measures ``will help intensify international pressures
aimed at achieving the immediate, complete and unconditional
withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait,'' Fitzwater said.
   Just hours after Thursday's invasion, Washington imposed an
embargo on oil and other imports from Iraq, and froze Iraqi and
Kuwaiti assets in the United States.
   Japan's action was seen as especially tough because Tokyo has
taken a low profile in the Middle East with an eye to guaranteeing
oil imports.
   Kaifu said the Iraqi invasion ``was not a permissible act.''
   The sanctions, he said ``will press Iraq to consider its action,
and we have to consider how this will affect our people.''
   Japan relied on Iraq and Kuwait for 11.2 percent of its oil
supplies in the first quarter of the year, the trade ministry says.
   ``This is a problem that will have an effect on our lives to
some extent,'' Kaifu conceded. ``We will come up with necesssary
measures to cope with the problem, but Japan, after the past oil
crises, has 142 days of reserves.''
   Iraq and Kuwait supplied about 11 percent of the European
Community's oil needs. Those countries will face difficulties
roughly equal to Japan's in maintaining oil supplies if the crisis
drags on for a long time.
   Kaifu called on Japanese to conserve energy, a recurrent theme
this summer as a long hot spell had the Tokyo area's electricity
generators working at full capacity.
   The dollar was lower on concerns about the effect of high oil
prices on the U.S. economy. It closed at 149.50, up 0.15 yen from
Friday's close of 149.35 yen.
   Oil traders in Asia say Japanese companies made large purchases
of Iranian oil over the weekend to bolster their positions ahead of
the announcement of the oil embargo.
   Japan's sanctions also include a freeze on Iraqi assets in
Japan, suspending loans to Iraq and banning investment and
financing in both Iraq and Kuwait.
   The sanctions will hurt Japanese companies hoping to recover
debts from Iraq, which owes $4.6 billion to Japan, much of that
held by the private sector. Repayments were coming through sales of
Iraqi oil to Japan.

<TEXT>
   Economic reprisals against Iraq are piling up
as Europe and Japan join the U.S. boycott of Iraqi oil. But for
international pressure to defeat the invasion of Kuwait, two Middle
Eastern neighbors may have to take an even tougher step.
   Turkey and Saudi Arabia would have to choke off the oil
pipelines _ literally.
   More than half of Iraq's daily export of 3.14 million barrels
pours through two pipelines, one through Saudi Arabia and the other
through Turkey. The rest is shipped in tankers through the Straits
of Hormuz, which have become difficult to traverse because of
wreckage and mines left over from the Iran-Iraq war.
   Despite subtle pressure from President Bush, neither Saudi
Arabia nor Turkey has been willing _ so far _ to incur the wrath of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein by taking such a dramatic step. With
Iraqi forces massed menacingly along its border, Saudi Arabia seems
particularly vulnerable.
   In an apparent attempt to forestall such a blockade, Iraq today
notified Turkey it would stop pumping through one of the two
pipelines and would use only 70 percent of the capacity of the
second, Turkey's semi-official Anatolia news agency reported.
   Many experts believe the current embargo will be difficult to
sustain. Without oil from Iraq and Kuwait, prices will rise and
economic growth will drop _ distasteful scenarios in any of the
Western democracies.
   Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,
predicted the oil boycott could collapse. ``Some people lie. Some
people don't get on board,'' he said. On CBS-TV Sunday, Aspin said
a blockade cutting off Iraqi oil deliveries might stand a better
chance of forcing Saddam to blink.
   ``Saddam Hussein did not make his decision lightly,'' said James
Schlesinger, a former defense and energy secretary and one-time CIA
director. ``Because he has decided to accept the diplomatic flak
... it will be hard to bluff him out of his booty.''
   International navies _ especially the Americans, French and
British, which maintain ships in the Indian Ocean _ could mount a
sea blockade at the southern tip of the Straits of Hormuz. But to
be fully effective such a move would have to be carried out jointly
with a disruption of the land pipelines.
   Incensed at Saddam's flagrant invasion of his tiny neighbor last
Thursday, the United States succeeded in gaining unprecedented
international support for a campaign to strangle Iraq's limping
economy.
   The administration, followed by the 12-nation European Economic
Community, wealthy Japan and Canada, banned oil purchases from
Iraq. The Soviets, French and Chinese _ Iraq's main arms suppliers
_ promised not to send Saddam any weapons.
   The United States, Britain and Japan froze Kuwait's considerable
assets so that Iraq couldn't loot them, and banned food shipments
to Baghdad. Japan, one of Iraq's main bankers, also suspended
lending to cash-hungry Saddam.
   Saddam, his economy in tatters from a ravaging eight-year war
with Iran, is vulnerable. He launched the invasion of Kuwait after
failing to pressure that country into reducing oil production so
world oil prices would rise and fill Iraq's coffers.
   Saddam faces 45 percent inflation, food shortages and a lack of
ready cash for badly needed reconstruction. Despite massive oil
reserves _ Iraq is second only in proven reserves to Saudi Arabia _
debt-ridden Iraq has had trouble getting loans.
   But Saddam, by all accounts a clever man, probably figured the
potential gain from taking over Kuwait's bountiful oil fields and
rich treasury was worth the risk. He knows a successful oil embargo
against Iraq could backfire by punishing Western motorists with
higher gasoline prices, Schlesinger wrote in the Washington Post.
   Barely a day into the U.S. sanctions, prices at many gas
stations went up several cents despite the fact that little U.S.
oil comes from Iraq and that oil storage facilities here are full
to overflowing.
   Price hikes are unlikely to sit well with Americans.
   ``We're back to driving big cars again,'' said Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio. ``Will the American public make a long-term commitment to
seeing that those oil lanes remain open from the Mideast? That's
something we've never done.''
   European leaders, too, might have a problem getting support for
a long-term oil boycott. Europe imports 11 percent of its oil from
Iraq and Kuwait.
   Finally, there are many who believe Saddam _ a military man _
only understands one language. Sanctions, said Kuwaiti Ambassador
Saud Nassir al-Sabah, ``take months and months to have any
effective return ... to deal with this man and with his regimes, he
can only understand force.''

<TEXT>
   Firstar Corp. and Banks of Iowa Inc. said
Monday they had agreed to merge in a stock swap valued at about
$200 million.
   The companies said it would be the first interstate merger
agreement in Iowa since that state approved an interstate banking
law earlier this year.
   The agreement calls for Firstar, which is an $8.5 billion bank
holding company based in Milwaukee, to exchange 2.7 of its shares
for each outstanding share of the common stock of Banks of Iowa, a
$2.5 billion bank holding company based in Des Moines.
   Based on the closing price of Firstar stock Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange, Banks of Iowa shareholders would receive a
Firstar stock with a value of about $75.60 per share or a total of
$219.1 million.
   The Iowa company would become Firstar Corp. of Iowa upon
completion of the transaction, and the combined organization would
have 52 banks and 174 offices in Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota,
Illinois and Arizona, as well as a trust subsidiary in Florida.
   The agreement is subject to, among other things, approval by the
shareholders of both companies and state and federal banking
authorities.
   The merger ``benefits Firstar by moving us into the growing
urban areas of Iowa, which enjoy healthy diversified economies. It
benefits Banks of Iowa by adding major new resources for its
customers and operations,'' said Firstar Chairman John H. Hendee Jr.
   Banks of Iowa Chairman Holmes Foster said James R. Lang would
become president and chief executive of Firstar Corp. of Iowa upon
the closing of the transaction, which is expected in the first half
of 1991.
   Iowa's interstate banking law does not go into effect until Jan.
1.
   Lang is now president of the First Wisconsin National Bank of
Madison. Foster, 63, is to retire upon completion of the
transaction.
   The agreement calls for two members of the Banks of Iowa board
to be added to the Firstar board, bringing the total number of
Firstar directors to 22.
   The transaction grants Firstar an option to purchase newly
issued shares of Banks of Iowa common stock in an amount equal to
24.9 percent of Banks of Iowa's current outstanding shares.

   The stock market moved broadly lower amid heavy,
panicky selling today as the Middle East turmoil and resulting oil
price surge unsettled investors.
   Severe setbacks in foreign financial centers also set the stage
for a volatile day on Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 blue chips was off 78.71 points at
2,730.94 by 12 a.m. on Wall Street, an improvement from a morning
loss of about 105 points.
   Declining issues took a huge lead over advances on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,448 down, 194 up and 223 unchanged.
   Trading activity was close to Friday's brisk pace. Volume on the
floor of the Big Board was a heavy 131.07 million shares, compared
to 132.72 million at the same point Friday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
4.94 to 183.88.
   Meanwhile, at the American Stock Exchange the market value index
lost 5.93 to 340.70.
   Circuit breakers designed to cushion market declines were
tripped by early activity in stocks and stock index futures.
   NYSE spokesman Richard Torrenzano told reporters the nation's
biggest stock market was weathering the session with no problems.
The levels of trading and price swings were far below the hectic
thresholds that the exchange experienced during the October 1987
crash and October 1989 minicrash, he said.
   ``The market continues to react to current economic and
political situations coming out of the Mideast,'' Torrenzano said
at an impromput news conference.
   In Washington, a Securities and Exchange Commission spokesman
had no comment while a spokeman at the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission said the agency was monitoring the situation.
   U.S. stocks, already weakened by concerns about U.S. economic
health, have been battered by speculation that sharply higher oil
prices could trigger a recession accompanied by rising inflation.
   A few stocks, particularly oil and related issues, benefited
from the situation.
   Exxon added 1&rsqb; to 54{, Texaco rose 1&rsqb; to 66, Chevron gained { to
79\, Mobil moved up 1&rsqb; to 68\ and Amoco jumped 1} to 59\.

slid 3\ to 103|, Philip Morris lost 2&lsqb; to 44&rsqb;, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph skidded 1\ to 34} and General Electric lost 3&rsqb; to 66&rsqb;.
   Market watchers had expected stocks to get off to a rough start
in the United States.
   Worries about the economic impact of the Persian Gulf crisis and
oil price spiral caused investors to bail out of stocks in a big
way earlier in Tokyo, London and elsewhere.
   The Toykyo market's Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues
closed at 28,599.53 points, down 916.23 points, or 3.1 percent, on
trading of an estimated 330 million shares.
   But market analysts said stocks could stabilize later in the
session.
   Eugene Peroni, director of technical research at Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia, said ``later in the session
we'll see the market begin to turn.''

   The number of working oil and natural gas rigs in
the United States plunged again this week, dropping by 30 to 966,
Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   Last week, the count dropped by 26 to 996. A year ago this week,
the count was 874.
   Ike Kerridge, a vice president at Baker Hughes who keeps track
of the count, attributed the decline to weak gasoline prices in the
past few months. He said the effects of the higher gas prices that
followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait probably will not be felt in the
drilling industry for several weeks.
   ``Gas prices have been very disappointing for several months. I
think there is a time lag, so you haven't had the effect of higher
oil prices. I'd expect (increased drilling) before too many
weeks,'' Kerridge said Monday.
   Baker Hughes' rig count reflects the number of rotary rigs
actively exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the
number of producing wells.
   The Houston-based oil toolmaker company has kept track of the
rig count _ the widely watched index of drilling activity _ since
1940.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   Among major oil-producing states, Texas' count was down by 16,
Oklahoma lost 10 and New Mexico was down by seven. Pennsylvania
lost four, Michigan was down six and California and Colorado lost
two rigs each.
   Wyoming gained nine rigs, Louisiana's count increased by seven
and North Dakota was up two.

   The crisis in the Persian Gulf sent more shock
waves through the financial markets today, with stocks, bonds and
the dollar plunging because of anxiety about the economic impact of
rising oil prices.
   The panicky selling on Wall Street, meanwhile, heightened the
demand for Treasury bills, considered among the most secure
investments anywhere. Short-term interest rates declined as a
result.
   ``The situation is sort of confused and chaotic,'' said Robert
A. Brusca, chief financial economist for Nikko Securities Co.
International. ``Investors are adrift. They don't know what to do.''
   The Dow Jones industrial average, the best-known barometer of
the stock market, declined about 85 points to the 2,724 level by
12:30 p.m. EDT today, after slipping as much as 105 points earlier
in the trading session.
   In the broader market, declining issues far outpaced advances
among stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Overseas stocks also fell sharply.
   The early plunge tripped so-called ``circuit breakers'' designed
by the nation's financial markets to cushion market declines in
stocks and stock index futures.
   The NYSE said a ``sidecar'' computer arrangement had assumed the
role of handling computer-driven program trades, which sometimes
can inject volatility into prices. NYSE spokesman Richard
Torrenzano said the nation's biggest stock exchange was weathering
the session with no problems.
   Traders said speculation that sharply higher oil prices stemming
from Iraq's invasion of neighboring Kuwait last week could trigger
a recession, accompanied by rising inflation, were responsible for
today's selloff.
   ``The outlook for stocks had been decidedly bad for quite
awhile,'' said Brusca. ``The problems in the Middle East have made
things worse.''
   A key issue now is what action the Federal Reserve might take in
directing interest rates, economists said. Inflationary pressures
are high as oil prices continue to soar but recent economic data
have shown the economy is weakening and could fall into a
recession, they said.
   Those concerns contributed to the drop in the bond market.
   Investors, unwilling to lock their money into anything long
range, dumped long-term Treasury bonds. The government's bellwether
30-year issue, for instance, plunged about 1{ points, or $12.50 per
$1,000 face amount, by midday today. The drop was far less
dramatic, however, in shorter-term bonds and notes.
   In foreign exchange trading, the dollar also weakend against
most major currencies, although it was showing some signs of
recovery.
   For instance, it was trading at 149.80 Japanese yen, down from
149.925 at Friday's close; 1.5715 German marks, down from 1.5935;
and 1.33 Swiss francs, down from 1.3505.

   Share prices closed sharply lower on London's
Stock Exchange Monday, battered by concerns about the conflict in
the Middle East and pessimism over oil prices.
   Stocks opened significantly lower and fell for most of the
session, with market watchers nervous about when the price slide
would abate.
   ``Until the (Middle East) situation is resolved, I can't see
anyone being enthusiastic about doing any bargain hunting for the
moment,'' said George Hodgson, U.K. equity market strategist at
Warburg Securities in London.
   ``There's a total preoccupation with events in the Gulf. All

   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index

   The session low was 2,202.5. It peaked at 2,253.1.

   The U.S. dollar fell today against most major
foreign currencies in dealings in Europe where traders appeared to
focus on recent evidence of weakness in the U.S. economy.
   Gold prices were higher.
   Market participants said the dollar slipped mostly in the
absence of fresh news from the Middle East, where last week's Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait has raised grave doubts about the stability of
the region and drove the dollar higher as investors sought safety
in the currency.
   Today's decline reflected speculation that weakness in the U.S.
economy will prompt the Federal Reserve to encourage lower interest
rates, traders said.
   ``It if hadn't been for Iraq-Kuwait, the dollar would have
dropped to these levels days ago,'' said a senior trader at a large
Frankfurt bank.
   Sharply higher oil prices and a big drop in stock prices on Wall
Street where the Dow Jones industrial average was down more than
100 points in early trading also pushed the dollar down, dealers
said.
   ``I think the dollar's losing some of its safe haven status,''
said Michael James, head of interbank dealing at Midland Bank in
London. ``People are focusing on the fundamental weaknesses (in the
dollar).''
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 149.50 Japanese yen from
149.35 yen at Friday's close. Later in London, it rose to 149.55
yen. At midday in New York, the dollar was quoted at 149.85 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8725 from $1.8570 late
Friday. At midday in New York, the pound was trading at $1.87665.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.5762 West German marks, down from 1.5920;
1.3315 Swiss francs, down from 1.3505; 5.2863 French francs, down
from 5.3345; 1.7760 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7945; 1,154.00
Italian lire, down from 1,164.90, and 1.1490 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1510.
   Selected midday dollar rates in New York included: 1.5770 West
German marks, 1.3255 Swiss francs, 1,150.00 Italian lire and
1.15125 Canadian dollars.
   Gold rose in London to $382.50 a troy ounce, up from $379.25

<HEAD>Eastern Airlines, Managers Enter Innocent Pleas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines pleaded innocent Monday along
with eight top managers to charges of falsifying safety and
maintenance records.
   U.S. District Judge I. Leo Glasser in Brooklyn released all
eight without bail and continued proceedings to Sept. 12.
   Prosecutors allege the violations took place from July 1985 to
October 1989 and were meant to avoid expensive flight delays and
cancellations.
   Phony records allegedly were kept at Kennedy International and
La Guardia airports in New York, Hartsfield International Airport
in Atlanta and Eastern headquarters in Miami.
   Eastern and the managers were indicted July 25 on charges of
conspiracy to defraud the government, wire fraud, falsification of
documents and obstruction of justice. It was the first time an
airline has faced a criminal indictment.
   Attorney Jane Parver entered the innocent plea on behalf of
Eastern. The eight managers appeared in court but made no
statements other than to enter their pleas.
   The managers include Thomas Lewis, Eastern's maintenance
director for the region from Washington to Montreal; Edward Upton,
former vice president of maintenance and engineering; and Joseph
Moser, former maintenance manager at Kennedy.
   The other five were maintenance foremen at Kennedy. They are
Charles Catarelli, Stephen Jones, Roy Hardy, Robert Knox and
Jacques Jean.
   The ninth Eastern official charged, former foreman Elia Dragone,
pleaded guilty July 31 to two of the 20 counts in which he was
named. He faces five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each
count at sentencing Oct. 17.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles Gerber refused to comment Monday
on whether any more plea bargains were in the works.
   Eastern's employees struck the airline March 4, 1989, and the
company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection five days later.
Pilots and flight attendants quit the strike several months later
but mechanics remain on strike.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney said in announcing the indictments
that there was no evidence of improprieties at Eastern since Martin
Shugrue, the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee, assumed management
in April.

<HEAD>Rising Fuel Costs May Boost Airline Fares</HEAD>

   Higher airline ticket prices almost certainly
await U.S. travelers with jet fuel costs rising due to the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait, industry analysts said Monday.
   Northwest Airlines announced an $8 fuel surcharge on Friday.
Other airlines said they were considering whether to follow suit.
   But several said such increases were still premature.
   ``We have not decided to put such a surcharge on yet,'' said
Delta Air Lines spokeswoman Glenda Johnson. ``I can't say that we
won't, but we don't want to pass these costs on to the consumer.''
   She said the airline considered it ``premature'' to increase
ticket costs, but didn't rule out an eventual price hike. She said
Delta calculated that each penny-per-gallon increase in jet fuel
prices costs the airline about $20 million a year. The average
domestic price of jet fuel is 61 cents a gallon.
   Spokesmen for Continental Airlines, Pan American and Eastern
Airlines each said their companies were considering increases to
offset fuel costs but hadn't reached a decision yet.
   United Air Lines said it had decided not to comment on the issue.
   Robert J. Joedicke, an airline analyst at Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc., called Northwest's price increase ``a little
premature because most fuel contracts aren't negotiated until the
end of the month.''
   But he added: ``It's safe to say there will be an eventual
increase by other airlines. I'm certain that depending on the
magnitude (of oil price increases) that there will have to a pass
through.''
   David Swierenga, assistant vice president of airline industry
data for the Air Transport Association, a Washington-based industry
group, pointed out that a $5-a-barrel rise in world crude oil costs
raises jet fuel prices by about 15 cents a gallon.
   ``The industry consumes about 15 billion gallons of jet fuel a
year,'' he said. ``Every penny increase in the price translates
into an added $150 million in costs. If, in fact, the industry is
faced with a 15-cent-a-gallon increase, that translates into $2.25
billion in added costs.''
   Such an increase could well lead to higher ticket prices, he
said.
   But he said that with air travel approaching the post-Labor Day
lull, airlines try to hold back or temper any price hikes to avoid
cutting too deeply into consumer demand.

   The stock market remained broadly lower this
afternoon in heavy selling sparked by the Middle East turmoil and
resulting oil price surge.
   Severe setbacks in foreign financial centers had set the stage
for a panicky day on Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 blue chips was off 74.01 points at
2,735.64 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street, a slight improvement from the

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
5 points to 183.82.
   Meanwhile, at the American Stock Exchange the market value index

   Iran Air has signed a deal to buy six
Dutch-manufactured Fokker-100 passenger aircraft, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported Monday.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Hassan Shafti, head of
the state-owned airline, as saying the first of the twin-engine,
short-haul aircraft will be delivered next month. The rest will be
shipped by the end of the year.
   Shafti added that a number of Iranian pilots and engineers were
being trained in the Netherlands at Fokker's expense, IRNA said.
   Iran, with one of the fastest growing populations in the world,
has faced surging demand for air travel.
   Aviation experts say the Fokker-100s are too small for Iran
Air's needs. The Fokkers are normally equipped with 120 passenger
seats.
   Iran Air ideally would have liked to buy the newer Boeing 757s,
767s, or Airbuses. But it has been unable to add to its fleet of
U.S.-manufactured Boeing aircraft and European-made Airbus planes
due to American embargoes banning the export of American technology
to Iran's anti-American government.
   Airbus aircraft, manufacted by Aerospatiale, a European
consortium, are powered by American-made jet engines.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board will lower
short-term interest rates soon to stimulate a tottering economy
that faces a damaging new blow from higher oil prices resulting
from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, analysts predicted Monday.
   An economy that already had slowed to barely perceptible growth
during the first half of the year is threatened further by
embargoes imposed by the United States and many other Western
nations on imports of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.
   As a result, many analsysts said the Federal Reserve probably
will nudge its federal funds rate down from 8 percent to 7} percent
to stimulate growth.
   The federal funds rate, the interest charged by the Fed for
overnight loans to banks, has remained high for more than a year as
the central bank sought to slow the economy and reduce inflationary
pressures.
   ``Historically, the Fed has actively fought inflation only as
long as the economy was not threatened by recession,'' economist
Samuel D. Kahan wrote in the current issue of Perspectives, the
Fuji Securities Inc. weekly commentary.
   ``When it appears that the U.S. economy is about to fall into a
recession, the Fed must shift its policy efforts,'' he said.
``Recent economic releases suggest that we have entered this zone
and we look for the Fed to shift its policy directive and emphasize
economic growth.''
   ``We expect the Fed to ease the federal funds rate to 7} percent
any day soon,'' said Mark M. Zandi, an economist with Regional
Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa.
   If the United States manages to escape a recession induced by
Middle East developments, some analysts said higher energy costs
combined with rising unemployment would produce something similar
to the ``stagflation'' of the late 1970s.
   ``Its won't be as severe ... but it's an unpleasant
combination,'' said Donald Straszheim, chief economist with Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets in New York.
   Charles Schultze, former chairman of the White House Council of
Economic Advisers in the Carter administration, suggested during a
weekend TV interview that the Iraqi invasion could produce a ``mild
recession'' if nothing else happens.
   Many private economists believe the stagnant economy is as close
to no-growth as possible without actually being negative. ``Right
now, we're skirting the edge'' of a recession, says Robert G.
Dederick, chief economist of Northern Trust Co. of Chicago. ``The
economy is just creeping ahead.''
   The gross national product, the nation's total output of goods
and services, rose just 1.2 percent in the second quarter. Some
economists said the economy had worsened in July, even before the
Iraqi invasion.
   However, Zandi and some other analysts noted that business
inventories, one of the classic portents of a recession, had
declined since the first of the year.
   ``In other major recessions, businesses accumulated big
inventories,'' Zandi said, resulting in production declines and job
layoffs to correct the situation.
   Zandi predicted that unemployment will reach about 6 percent by
year's end. The jobless rate rose to 5.6 percent in July, the
highest level in two years. It exceeded 10 percent during the last
recession in 1981-82.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Futures Lead Gains in Grains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade, paced by sharp gains in corn
and soybeans as the surging crude oil and gold markets stoked
inflation fears.
   The jump of more than $3 per barrel in crude oil futures also
sparked speculation that the Soviet Union, which exports oil to
European countries, might soon have more money to spend on grain
imports, said Joel Karlin, a grain market analyst with Research
Department Inc. in Chicago.
   ``There are ideas that the higher crude prices will give them a
few more dollars to play with and, putting two and two together,
they'll have more to spend on food,'' Karlin said.
   Crude-oil traders bid prices up dramatically Monday in reaction
to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait and the potential for further
armed conflict in the Middle East.
   Karlin said unseasonably cool overnight temperatures in the
Midwest revived concerns about the possibility of early frost
damage to soybeans, which added further support.
   But Karlin said market fundamentals remained bearish. For
example, the Agriculture Department's weekly grain
export-inspections report indicated export demand for U.S. grains
and soybeans is relatively sluggish.
   At the close, wheat futures were unchanged to 2{ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.83 a bushel; corn
was 2{ cents to 4} cents higher with September at $2.54 a bushel;
oats were 1 cent to 3 cents higher with September at $1.17 a
bushel; soybeans were 5} cents to 13 cents higher with August at
$5.95\ a bushel.

<HEAD>Ex-Wall Street Trader Agrees to Settle Civil Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Wall Street trader Salim B. ``Sandy''
Lewis agreed Monday to pay $475,000 to settle a Securities and
Exchange Commission lawsuit arising from his guilty plea to
criminal stock manipulation charges.
   The SEC suit, filed Monday in federal court, alleged Lewis
violated securities laws by helping to manipulate the price of
Fireman's Fund Corp. stock in 1986 _ the same accusations to which
he pleaded guilty in a criminal proceeding.
   SEC attorney Bruce Hiler said the $475,000 would be placed in a
fund and an administrator would return the money to victims of the
scheme.
   Lewis, 51, of Short Hills, N.J., also consented to an order that
bars him from any future securities violations.
   ``Although we believe no one was hurt by the trades in question
and there were no financial losses by investors in the marketplace,
the settlement was made to avoid lengthy and costly litigation with
the government,'' Lewis' attorney, Theodore Wells Jr., said.
   During his guilty plea last August, Lewis admitted that he
manipulated the stock price of the Fireman's Fund in May 1986 on
the same day American Express Co. planned to sell to the public a
large part of its stock in Fireman's Fund.
   Lewis was implicated by West Coast trader Boyd L. Jefferies, who
said he helped in the Fireman's Fund stock manipulation.
   Lewis was sentenced to three years probation and a $250,000
fine. His former firm, S.B. Lewis &amp; Co., also pleaded guilty in the
criminal case.
   Jefferies was sentenced to five years probation and a $250,000
fine.

<HEAD>Honda Denies Report It Will Make Trucks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An automotive trade journal reported Monday that
Honda Motor Co. Ltd. plans to enter the truck market and boost its
U.S. sales by 50 percent by 1995, but Honda denied the report.
   Honda, which makes no trucks, denied the story in Ward's
Automotive Reports, saying only that the company is studying an
expansion into the truck market, which includes minivans, pickups
and sport-utility vehicles.
   ``Eventually, we want to be in every segment of the market with
the possible exception of full-size,'' Ward's quoted Honda's
executive vice president for car sales Thomas Elliott as saying.
``We want to be in trucks, vans and sport-utilities.''
   On Monday, Honda spokesman Bob Butorac said Elliott's comments
last week at the introduction of the company's new Acura NSX sports
car meant only that the company was studying entering the truck
market.
   ``We have no plans to enter it at this time,'' Butorac said.
   James W. Bush, editor of Ward's Automotive Reports, said the
weekly journal stood by its story.
   There has been speculation in the past that trucks may be in
Honda's future in the United States. Honda makes the Accord, the
best-selling car in the United States last year; the Civic
subcompact; and the Acura line of upscale cars.
   The truck segment has been one of the fastest growing segments
of the entire market. One truck is sold for every two cars in the
United States.
   Honda sold 515,439 cars during the first half of this year, up
13.2 percent from last year. The company commands 9 percent of the
U.S. car market with vehicles made in Japan and at its two Ohio
assembly plants.
   Ward's also said Monday that Honda plans to sell 1.5 million
vehicles in the United States by 1995.
   Butorac denied that. ``We've never talked about sales
projections beyond the early to mid-1990s, and that's 1 million.''

   The stock market took its worst hit since the
``mini-crash'' last October amid panicky selling sparked by fears
that consequences of the Persian Gulf crisis could topple the
teetering U.S. economy into recession.
   Severe setbacks in foreign financial centers had set the stage
for a wild day on Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 blue chips ended down 93.31 points,
or 3.32 percent, at 2,716.34. Since July 30, the widely watched
market barometer has lost 200.99 points.
   It plunged about 105 points in the first 45 minutes of trading
Monday and never managed to recover much ground. The day's point
loss was the largest since Oct. 13, 1989, when the Dow Jones
industrial average fell 190.58 points. Declining issues swamped
advances in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
issues, with 1,530 down, 255 up and 255 unchanged.
   Trading activity slowed slightly from Friday's brisk pace. But
volume on the floor of the Big Board still came to a heavy 240.40
million shares, the third highest of the year and compared to
292.36 million shares on Friday, which was the 1990 high. Last
Thursday's volume of 253.09 million shares was the second highest
total for the year.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 273.26 million shares.
   Market watchers had expected stocks to encounter rough going.
Worries about the economic impact of Iraq's occupation of Kuwait
had caused investors to bail out of stocks in a big way earlier in
Tokyo, London and elsewhere.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues closed at 28,599.53 points, down 916.23 points, or
3.1 percent, on trading of an estimated 330 million shares. In
London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell
64.4 points, or 2.9 percent, to 2,220.2.
   NYSE spokesman Richard Torrenzano told reporters the nation's
biggest stock market coped well with the powerful wave of selling.
   ``Circuit breakers'' designed to cushion market declines were
tripped by early activity in stocks and stock index futures. He
said the mechanisms worked without a hitch and appeared to have
calmed the volatile market.
   Investor confidence has been eroded by speculation that the
struggling U.S. economy will slump into recession if it must
weather a prolonged oil price spiral. Recession fears were fanned
Friday by a Labor Department report that showed the nation's
unemployment rate jumped to 5.5 percent in July from 5.2 percent in
June.
   Airline and trucking stocks were among the biggest losers. The
Dow Jones transportation average skidded 58.76 to 980.29, its
lowest close in 19 months.
   A few stocks, particularly oil and related issues, benefited
from the situation. The contract for September delivery of the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil jumped $3.56 to $28.05 per
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   But a plea from the White House for oil companies to resist
price hikes tempered the rally. Exxon added 1&lsqb; to 54\, Texaco rose
&rsqb; to 65, Chevron gained | to 79&rsqb;, Mobil moved up 1&lsqb; to 68 and Amoco
added &rsqb; to 57~.
   The volume leader on the Big Board was Philip Morris, which
tumbled 2{ to 44 as more than 3.65 million shares changed hands.
   Among other heavily traded blue chips, International Business
Machines slid 3 to 103~, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph pulled back
by 1| to 34&rsqb;, American express fell 1{ to 26\ and General Electric
lost 3} to 66.
   UAL plunged 12} to 110 after a published report indicated a
proposed employee-led buyout of the parent of United Airlines has
run into new difficulty.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $95.47 billion, or 2.92
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slumped 5.50 to 183.32.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 12.32 to 394.74, and

<HEAD>Gold Futures Surge On Oil-Fueled Inflation Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices climbed strongly Monday on New York's
Commodity Exchange, reflecting growing fears that the soaring price
of crude oil will lead to higher inflation.
   Crude oil futures rose to their highest levels in more than 4{
years as Iraq and the United States appeared to be headed for a
showdown over Iraqi aggression in the Middle East.
   On other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures rose; and
livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $7.30 to $7.80 higher in New York with the
contract for delivery in August at $384.70 a troy ounce; silver
ended 5 cents to 5.7 cents higher with September at $4.92 a troy
ounce.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude oil finished $1 to $3.56 higher with September at $28.05 a
barrel, the highest settlement for a near-month crude oil contract
since the latter half of 1985; heating oil futures settled 3 cents
to 8.97 cents higher with September at 75.55 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was 3 cents to 9.34 cents higher with September
at 81.52 cents a gallon.
   Strength in petroleum and precious metals _ as well as weakness
in the stock market _ was attributed almost entirely to investor
fears that Iraq's occupation of Kuwait could draw the United States
into a Middle East war.
   Especially disturbing, analysts said, were reports that 28
Americans were in Iraqi hands; that American naval forces were in
position to launch an aerial attack on Baghdad; and that Iraq
appeared to be increasing the size of its force near the border
between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
   ``You have Iraq's leader and you have President Bush and they're
looking at Saudi Arabia, staring each other down, seeing who will
be the first to flinch,'' said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals
analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   Analysts said the gold market was thinly traded and seemed to
have encountered strong resistance near a bid of $385 an ounce.
They said the market's next move probably would depend on overnight
developments in the Middle East.
   Grain and soybean futures rose on the Chicago Board of Trade,
paced by sharp gains in corn and soybeans as the surging crude oil
and gold markets stoked inflation fears.
   Crude's gains also sparked speculation that the Soviet Union,
which exports oil to European countries, might soon have more money
to spend on grain imports, said Joel Karlin, a grain-market analyst
with Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Karlin said unseasonably cool overnight temperatures in the
Midwest revived concerns about the possibility of early frost
damage to late-planted soybeans, which added further support.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department released weekly
crop-progress statistics, showing slight deterioration in the
condition of the soybean crop and slight improvemet in the corn
crop's condition, although both crops remained in mostly good to
excellent shape.
   Crop development continued to lag far behind the normal pace, a
function of the heavy spring rains that delayed planting in some
areas.
   A National Weather Service forecast for cooler and dryer than
normal weather in the Midwest during the first half of next week
could add to worries about the crops, analysts said.
   Wheat futures settled unchanged to 2\ cents higher with
September at $2.82\ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 5 cents higher
with September at $2.54\ a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 2} cents
higher with September at $1.16} a bushel; soybeans were 6\ cents to
13 cents higher with August at $5.95\ a bushel.
   Slack demand and lower cash prices weighed on cattle futures on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange; most pork futures advanced, paced
by powerful gains in pork bellies, reflecting strengthening demand.
   Live cattle futures settled unchanged to .35 cent lower with
August at 76.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .40
cent lower with August at 88.55 cents a pound; live hogs were .03
cent lower to .82 cent higher with August at 58.72 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 2 cents higher across the board with
August at 50.55 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower, Gold Up</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar lost more ground Monday against all
major foreign currencies except the Japanese yen amid speculation
that recent signs of economic weakness will lead to lower U.S.
interest rates.
   But the decline was tempered by uncertainties about Iraq's
occupation of Persian Gulf neighbor Kuwait. Those worries made
traders reluctant to push the dollar lower because of the
possibility that a military outbreak could send investors in search
of the perceived safety of the currency.
   Gold prices climbed, benefiting from its status as a haven
against international turmoil and a hedge against inflation.
   The dollar moved sharply lower as trading resumed in the United
States, pushing the dollar toward its lowest level in 2{ years
against the German mark. But the dollar later recovered somewhat as
rumors swirled about what may happen overnight in the Persian Gulf.
   ``This is all emotional trading,'' said Liliana Nealon, first
vice president at the New York office of the Union Bank of
Switzerland.
   She said traders expect interest rates to fall in the United
States in the wake of last week's unemployment report that
indicated the economy may be headed toward a recession, increasing
chances that the Federal Reserve would encourage lower interest
rates.
   But she said they are fearful that an eruption of new military
action in the Persian Gulf would drive the dollar higher because
investors view it as the safest to hold during international
turmoil.
   President Bush said Monday he was ``ruling out nothing at all,''
including a military blockade to choke off Iraqi trade, in response
to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week.
   The invasion has led to sharply higher oil prices around the
world, and triggered a big drop Monday in world stock prices.
   The dollar gained against the Japanese yen, largely because the
Japanese economy is seen as vulnerable to oil price hikes since
Japan depends almost entirely on imported oil.
   By the end of trading in New York, the dollar had risen to
150.35 yen, up from 149.925 yen late Friday. Earlier, the dollar
rose to a closing 149.50 yen in Tokyo from 149.35 yen on Friday. In
London, it rose to 149.55 yen.
   But the dollar lost ground against the British pound. In New
York, the pound rose to $1.8725 from $1.85375 late Friday. In
London, the pound rose to $1.8725 from $1.8570 late Friday.
   It also dropped against the German mark, falling to 1.57875
marks from 1.5935 marks late Friday. That approached the lowest
level for the dollar since it hit an intraday low of 1.5615 marks
Jan. 4, 1988.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.3310 Swiss francs, down from 1.3505; 5.2890
French francs, down from 5.3415; 1,154.50 Italian lire, down from
1,166.00; and 1.14955 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15125.
   Selected late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.5762 German marks, down from 1.5920; 1.3315
Swiss francs, down from 1.3505; 5.2863 French francs, down from
5.3345; 1.7760 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7945; 1,154.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,164.90, and 1.1490 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1510.
   Selected midday dollar rates in New York included: 1.5770 German
marks, 1.3255 Swiss francs, 1,150.00 Italian lire and 1.15125
Canadian dollars.
   Gold prices moved higher in what analysts said reflected the
uncertain international state. Gold is often seen as a haven in
troubled times, and is also seen as offering a hedge against
inflation.
   On New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery rose
$7.30 an ounce to $384.70. At Republic National Bank in New York,
an ounce of gold was quoted at $384 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up
$6.75 from late Friday.
   Gold rose in London to $382.50 a troy ounce, up from $379.25
late Friday. In Zurich, the metal rose to $382.00 an ounce, up from
$378.00 late Friday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.20 to close at $378.58 an
ounce.
   On the Comex in New York, silver for current delivery rose to
$4.892 an ounce, up from $4.842 an ounce last Friday. Silver
bullion rose in London to $4.91 a troy ounce, up from $4.87 late
Friday.

<HEAD>Complaint Alleges Shearson Agent Squandered Widow's Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Massachusetts official filed a complaint Monday
against a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. agent accusing him of
squandering the life savings of a 90-year-old widow.
   A complaint filed by Secretary of State Michael J. Connolly's
office alleges that George Prebola, a Shearson vice president and
registered agent based in Boston, conducted unsuitable and highly
speculative trading with money invested by Mary Dillon of Walpole,
Mass., who was on a fixed income.
   Connolly's office is seeking to have Prebola's license revoked
and to have Prebola and Shearson return the money they made from
her investments.
   Steven Kaigen, a Shearson spokesman in New York, said the matter
had been settled privately in May between Shearson and lawyers for
Dillon's granddaughter, Bernadette Carty. He said the firm had had
no previous problems with Prebola.
   ``We will work with the commonwealth of Massachusetts to resolve
the matter,'' Kaigen said.
   The complaint alleged that Prebola engaged in dishonest and
unethical conduct that resulted in Dillon losing almost all of her
initial investment of $150,000.
   From the initial investment, Prebola earned commissions of about
$87,000 and Shearson earned interest charged on margin debts of
about $36,000, the complaint alleges.
   Dillon, who has since died, sold her house when her husband died
and sought to invest the proceeds, said Marty Meehan, a deputy
secretary of state.
   According to the complaint, Carty sought an investor in April
1985 to invest her grandmother's money and provide her with a
secure income.
   Prebola assured Carty that Dillon's funds would be safely and
profitably invested, the complaint alleges.
   But in 1986 and 1987, Prebola changed Dillon's investment
objective from a conservative investment strategy of ``appreciation
with safety,'' to ``speculative,'' the complaint alleged.
   The complaint also alleges that on several occasions Prebola
altered Dillon's personal account information to make her look like
a younger, more experienced investor.
   ``The pattern of trading conducted in the Dillon accounts by
Prebola was clearly unsuitable for a 90-year-old woman on a fixed
income,'' Connolly said in a statement.
   Meehan said that by October 1987 Dillon's money was gone.
   The complaint also alleges that Shearson failed to properly
supervise Prebola, allowing him to conduct improper trading in
Dillon's accounts, failing to recognize the excessive,
disproportionate commissions and margin interest generated in her
accounts, and not enforcing its own compliance procedures and
guidelines.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a House energy subcommittee
called Monday on the Bush administration, in coordination with
Japan and Europe, to start pumping oil from emergency government
reserves to halt the price spiral brought on by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   ``The Strategic Petroleum Reserve has to be used to make sure
shortages don't show up ..., to short the market and protect the
consumer,'' said Rep. Philip R. Sharp, chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce Committee's subcommittee on energy and power.
   Just before it adjourned Saturday, Congress extended Bush's
authority to begin drawing upon the 587-million-barrel U.S. reserve
stored in salt caverns along the Louisiana-Texas coast while it is
on vacation for the rest of August.
   Sharp, D-Ind., said a flooding of market with government
reserves from emergency stockpiles in the United States, Europe and
Japan could stem rapidly escalating oil prices on the world market.
   Since Thursday, the price the West Texas intermediate crude has
jumped to more than $28 a barrel as of the close of trading Monday,
the highest level in five years.
   An embargo or blockade of oil from Kuwait and Iraq by cutting
off pipelines in Turkey and Saudi Arabia, as advocated by the Bush
administration, would put further upward pressure on prices.
   Currently, between 3.5 million to 4.5 million barrels of oil per
day _ about 15 percent of the world's supply _ move through those
pipelines and via tankers passing through the Straits of Hormuz.
   The Energy Department has the capacity to pump a maximum 3
million barrels a day from its emergency reserve _ a roughly
200-day supply.
   A more likely scenario, according to government and private
experts, would be to pump between 1 million and 2 million barrels
per day from the U.S. reserve in coordination with similar draws
from allies' government reserves.
   Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore said last week the Bush
administration has no intention to use the reserve only to stop an
increase in oil prices.
   ``The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is not designed as a pricing
mechanism,'' he told reporters last Thursday. ``It was designed as
a reserve of needed oil in this country, not to set prices.''
   The administration of Bush's predecessor, Ronald Reagan, had
reached agreements with energy ministers in Japan and the European
Community in the middle 1980s to coordinate early draws of their
respective reserves if a disruption in world supplies set off a
price spiral.
   The reserve was established as as rainy-day stockpile in
response to the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo. It has been tapped only
once before, in a congressionally ordered 1985 test drawdown of 2
million barrels auctioned off to oil companies.
   Meanwhile, lawmakers hastily scheduled hearings for Tuesday on
what they said was price gouging by the oil companies, wholesalers
and service station dealers.
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., said oil companies have gone on ``a
feeding frenzy'' despite near-record stockpiles on hand. ``The oil
companies are playing the old game, heads they win, tails you
lose,'' he said.
   Bryan scheduled a hearing before the Senate Commerce consumer
subcommittee, with industry figures, federal regulators and
consumer advocates invited to testify.
   Seventeensenators signed onto a letter circulated by Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., asking Bush to establish an Emergency Oil Price
Task Force to focus public scrutiny on the industry.

   Panicky traders scoured the world for oil because they feared
shortages, and pushed the price to the highest levels in five
years. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price of key West
Texas Intermediate crude jumped $3.56 a barrel to settle at $28.05.
Prices for refined products such as heating oil and gasoline also
surged dramatically.

   The impact of rising oil prices on the already weak U.S. economy
pummeled Wall Street again, where stocks tumbled and the widely
watched Dow Jones industrial average took the worst one-day spill
since the October 1989 ``minicrash.'' The index of 30 blue-chip
stocks ended down 93.31 points, or 3.32 percent, at 2,716.34. In
the bond market, a sensitive barometer of the economy's health,
most prices fell sharply and interest rates rose on fears of higher
inflation. But those same fears strengthened the price of gold,
historically considered a safe haven investment. The dollar
weakened against most other key currencies.

   From airport ticket counters to gas pumps nationwide, consumers
began paying for the uncertainty in the oil market. Pan American
World Airways became the second major carrier after Northwest to
jack up prices because of rising fuel costs. Gasoline prices at
service stations were up as much as 14 cents a gallon from levels
prior to Iraq's seizure of Kuwait last week, provoking cries of
price gouging. Several states said they would investigate alleged
profiteering. In Washington, the chairman of a House energy
subcommittee called on the Bush administration to tap emergency
government oil reserves created after the 1970s Arab oil-price
shocks in order to halt the latest price spiral.

   Many economists speculated that the Federal Reserve Board would
lower short-term interest rates soon to stimulate the economy and
forestall a recession caused by the new blow of higher oil prices.
Some suggested the central bank will nudge interest rates lower
through its influence over the federal funds rate, the interest
charged on overnight loans to banks.

<HEAD>Western Union Management, Communications Workers Face Contract
Deadline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UPPER SADDLE RIVER, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for Western Union
Corp. and representatives of 2,500 unionized workers wrangled over
wages and health benefits Monday as the contract's scheduled
midnight expiration approached.
   Ballots in a strike-authorization vote were being counted late
Monday, said Dan J. Backstead, president of the Communications
Workers of America's United Telegraph Workers Bargaining Council.
   The CWA has been pushing for higher wage increases. The union
also opposes the company's plan to shift some medical premiums to
workers and add part-time employees.
   Negotiations between the union and Western Union traditionally
go to the last day of a contract, said company spokesman Warren
Bechtel.
   The union opposed the company's offer of a 2.5 percent annual
wage increase over two years, but have not countered with another
offer, Beckstead said late Monday in a telephone interview from the
negotiating site in Virginia Beach, Va. Western Union is based in
Upper Saddle River.
   Neither Bechtel nor Beckstead would provide specific details
about how the insurance costs would be shared, but Bechtel said the
company proposed union employees' payments match those made by
non-union workers.
   The union similarly resisted the company's proposals to merge
the duties of operators and customer relations clerks and to
increase the number of part-time employees not entitled to benefits
under the union contract.
   The company was prepared to use management and 1,000 recently
trained temporary workers to keep operating in the event of a
walkout, Bechtel said.
   For most of its 140 years, Western Union held a monopoly on
telegram service in the United States. In recent years Western
Union has diversified into other communications businesses.
   Union workers last struck Western Union in 1985, for 10 days.
   A 1971 labor dispute took 57 days to settle and another in 1952
stretched on for 53 days, Beckstead said.

   For the fourth year in a row, Mercedes-Benz
owners rated their car-buying experiences higher than any other
make, the J.D. Power &amp; Associates group said Monday.
   In their first two years covered in the annual survey by the
Agoura Hills, Calif.-based market research organization, Toyota
Motor Corp.'s Lexus and Nissan Motor Corp.'s Infiniti divisions
received high marks.
   Customers were asked about their experiences in buying their
cars, including the appearance and product knowledge of the
salesperson and preparation of the car before delivery.
   The organization surveyed more than 26,000 owners of 1990-model
cars bought about 90 days before the survey.
   Infiniti cars came in second and Lexus was fourth. General
Motors Corp.'s Cadillac Division held down third place. In fifth
place was GM's Buick Division.
   The organization releases the rankings only for those cars
consumers judge to be average or above. Full copies of the reports
are given to people who subscribe at a cost of hundreds of dollars
a year.
   Automakers frequently use results of the Power studies in their
advertising.
   In its monthly Power Report, which announced the results of the
new survey, the group said its own index showed that overall
customer satisfaction with salespeople and dealers rose slightly
from last year.
   Roundin out the top 10 in the latest Power sales survey were:
Lincoln at No. 6, Oldsmobile No. 7, Mercury and Jaguar tied for No.
8, and BMW 10th.

<HEAD>Lotus Moves To Reduce Costs With Hiring Freeze, Some Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lotus Development Corp., struggling with
slumping earnings, has begun a cost-cutting program that includes a
hiring freeze and layoffs of up to 40 people, the company said
Monday.
   Lotus, the Cambridge-based software company, has a workforce of
3,100. In the past, Lotus has occasionally closed small divisions,
but employees were generally absorbed elsewhere.
   Susan Yeomans, director of investor relations, said Monday that
Lotus has instituted a freeze in some areas in which the company is
consolidating and reorganizing.
   Lotus has merged some sales and marketing functions and plans to
eliminate positions where there is redundancy, Yeomans said. Lotus
plans to add employees in other areas.
   David Bayer, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San
Francisco who follows Lotus, said the freeze comes as no surprise.
   Lotus reported that earnings more than doubled in the second
quarter to $23.5 million, or 54 cents a share on revenue of $175.2
million. But Bayer said he expects earnings to slow in the third
quarter.
   ``I expect them to be profitable, just a lower level of

in revenues.''

   Oil prices leaped to their highest levels in
nearly five years, and the Dow Jones industrial average took its
biggest dive since last October as the financial markets continued
to wrestle Monday with the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The dollar also fell sharply against most currencies in foreign
exchange, shedding its historical role as a safe haven during times
of political turmoil.
   Money flowed instead into Treasury bills, among the most secure
short-term investments available.
   ``We have a selling panic going on in the stock and bond markets
and a flight to quality to T bills,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief
economist for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``When investors are
nervous they tend to pull back.''
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average _ the
best-known barometer of the stock market _ slid 93.31 points to
close at 2,716.34, after slipping as much as 105 points earlier in
the day.
   The plunge _ the biggest since last October's ``mini-crash'' _
tripped so-called ``circuit breakers'' designed by the nation's
financial markets to cushion market declines in stocks and stock
index futures.
   Declining issues far outpaced advances among stocks listed on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Monday's drop extended a week-long slide in the market that has
erased just just over 200 points from the Dow average.
   In oil-dependent Japan, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues closed at 28,599.53 points, down 916.23 points, or 3.1
percent. In Britain, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index dropped 64.4 points, or 2.9 percent, to 2,220.2.
   In early trading Tuesday, the Nikkei was down another 457.28
points, or 1.6 percent, at 28,142.25.
   In the United States, traders blamed the rout on continued
worries that sharply higher oil prices, stemming from Iraq's
invasion of neighboring Kuwait last week, could trigger higher
inflation and push the nation into a recession. ``The economy is in
pretty bad shape now. This could make things worse,'' Yardeni said.
   Oil prices continued their upward trend Monday, with no end in
sight. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September contract
for West Texas Intermediate soared $3.56 to settle at $28.05 a
42-gallon barrel.
   It was the highest level for the the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude since August 1985, when the price reached $28.08 per barrel.
   Among refined petroleum products, wholesale unleaded gasoline
jumped 9.34 cents to 81.52 cents a gallon. Wholesale home heating
oil was up 8.97 cents to 75.55 cents.
   Market observers said that if the United States and its allies
move aggressively to end the conflict in the Middle East, the
economic impact may be minimal. But if allowed to linger for weeks,
the crisis could erode business confidence, resulting in job
layoffs or lower production, the ingredients for a recession.
   ``We're in the hands of a very, very unpredictable ruthless
madman running Iraq, so most people's investment portfolios are
being held hostage to what (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein does
next,'' Yardeni said.
   Part of the nation's economic future also hinges on the Federal
Reserve's credit policies, economists said.
   ``The policy options were not good even without thinking about
what hostilities lie on the horizon,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief
financial economist for Nikko Securities Co. International. ``The
Fed has these conflicting signals.''
   A move by the Fed to lower interest rates could stimulate the
economy, but it could also further aggravate the inflation outlook.
   Speculation that the Fed will cut rates helped push the dollar
lower against all major currencies, except the Japanes yen. Among
the dollar's biggest drop was against the German mark, where it
slipped to 2{-year lows.
   Interest rate concerns, coupled with worries about oil prices,
contributed to Monday's drop in the bond market.
   Investors, unwilling to lock their money into anything long
range, sold long-term Treasury bonds. The government's bellwether
30-year issue, for instance, plunged about 2{ points, or $25 per
$1,000 face amount. The drop was far less dramatic in shorter-term
bonds and notes.
   Also hurting bonds were concerns about the budget deficit and
how it might be affected by the Mideast turmoil.
   ``With higher oil prices you won't have an energy tax (as
lawmakers have discussed) ... and you won't see cuts in defense
spending,'' said Maury Harris, chief economist for PaineWebber Inc.
