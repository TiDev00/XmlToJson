<HEAD>Philadelphia Inquirer Asks Judge to Throw Out Libel Verdict</HEAD>

   The Philadelphia Inquirer asked a judge
Monday to dismiss a $6 million libel verdict a state Supreme Court
justice won after the paper allegedly defamed him.
   ``The verdict was against the evidence (and) improper, contrary
to law and fact,'' according to a motion for a new trial by
Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., which owns the Inquirer.
   Attorney William Hangley filed the motion, which went to Common
Pleas Judge John Lavelle of Carbon County. There was no indication
when Lavelle would rule or set a hearing.
   Inquirer reporter Daniel Biddle wrote a 1983 series of articles
that questioned the ethical conduct of members of the state's
highest court.
   Justice James T. McDermott filed two lawsuits against the
newspaper, one for the original series, and one for the reprint
which went to the 1984 conference of the American Judicature
Society.
   The jury decided on Dec. 7 that Biddle's original series was not
libelous but that portions of a February 1984 reprint were false.
The reprint contained the same text as the original series but was
accompanied by an introduction, two editorials and two cartoons
that had not appeared with the original series.
   ``There was no evidence that anyone at the AJS meeting actually
read the articles in reprint form at the seminar or anywhere
else,'' Hangley said in the motion.
   Hangley argued a new trial was warranted because the award of
compensatory and punitive damages ``is so excessive as to shock the
conscience.''
   ``The jury's verdicts were inconsistent and irreconcilable,''
the motion said. ``The court should correct and set aside such a
verdict.''
   The ruling was the second libel judgment against the paper in a
year. In May an attorney won a record $34 million finding against
the paper for a 1973 story criticizing his handling of a homicide
case while he was assistant district attorney. The paper is
appealing that ruling as well.

   A businessman was found guilty in the sale
of U.S. warplanes left behind in Vietnam to undercover Customs
agents.
   A federal jury Monday convicted Cenon Rey Avelino, 40, of filing
false documents and illegally importing weapons but acquitted him
of five more serious charges, including violations of the Trading
With the Enemy Act.
   The jury partly accepted Avelino's defense that he was entrapped
by Customs agents who pressured him to come to the United States to
complete the $306,000 deal for two A-37 Dragonfly light attack
planes.
   Avelino, a former pilot for the family of deposed Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos who later went into the aircraft
business, faces a 12- to 20-month prison sentence under federal
guidelines. No sentencing date was set.
   The jury deliberated for 21{ hours over four days.
   Avelino, a Canadian citizen, purchased the planes from the
Vietnamese government and had them shipped to Toronto.
   Roy Stafford, a Jacksonville, Fla., aircraft dealer working with
Customs agents, had led Avelino to believe he could sell the planes
to El Salvador. One agent played an Iranian businessman who was
supposedly the financier of the deal.
   Avelino was arrested in Buffalo in 1989 after the dismantled and
crated planes were seized at the border.
   He was convicted of filing documents that misstated the value
and nature of the planes, and illegally importing 7.62mm machine
guns installed in the jets.
   ``If they did not manufacture a crime, there would be no case,''
he said after the verdict. He was allowed to remain free on
$250,000 bail.
   The Pentagon has estimated that nearly 1,000 planes, 940 naval
vessels, 42,000 trucks and 791,000 M-16 rifles were abandoned in
Vietnam when the U.S. military pulled out in 1975.

   Fearing the values they hold paramount are
slipping away, religious groups have entered the political fray
with a newfound vigor on issues from abortion to civil rights. The
second of a four-part series, ``Unholy Wars: Religion in Public
Life,'' looks at the increasing mingling of politics and religion.

   Presiding Bishop Edmond Browning couldn't get his phone calls
returned when Ronald Reagan was president. Now, with fellow
Episcopalian George Bush in office, Browning considers himself a
pastor to the president.
   But while presidential access is improving for mainline
Protestants, some disgruntled religious conservatives are slamming
the White House door on their way out. They contend Bush took their
votes and then pushed aside their concerns on abortion,
homosexuality and obscenity.
   Describing a meeting with Bush in late October, Robert Dugan,
public affairs director of the National Association of
Evangelicals, said, ``We told him the truth - that his
administration is on the ropes with evangelicals.''
   Welcome to the new world of religion and politics.
   Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson have stepped out of the
political limelight. Mainline Protestant churches see signs of a
return to political influence. And the Catholic Church may emerge
as the most powerful religious power broker of all, because of its
willingness to enter into coalitions with a wide range of allies.
   An Associated Press poll conducted in November by ICR Survey
Research Group indicates Americans believe that, within some
limits, religious leaders have a responsibility to enter public
policy debates.
   Three-quarters of the poll respondents said religious leaders
such as priests, ministers and rabbis should speak out on social
issues. But 58 percent, including 63 percent of the Catholic
respondents, said the clergy should not endorse political
candidates.
   The emergence of issues such as abortion, civil rights, child
care and federal funding of the arts into the forefront of national
public policy debates has shown that no American religious group
appears willing to give up the ``good'' fight.
   ``Perhaps the single most dramatic defeat of the forces of
militant secularism in America is that almost 18 years after Roe
vs. Wade, the abortion issue just hasn't gone away,'' said Richard
Neuhaus, author of ``The Naked Public Square'' and the director of
the Institute on Religion and Public Life in New York.
   In the new ballgame, the ability to deliver votes, not past
status as the religious elite, is what counts.
   The heyday of mainline Protestantism, highlighted when President
Eisenhower laid the cornerstone for the new National Council of
Churches building in New York in 1958, declined two years later,
coinciding with the election of the country's first Catholic
president - John Kennedy.
   Born-again Christian evangelicals, jolted from political apathy
by judicial rulings eliminating school prayer and legalizing
abortion, entered the fray.
   Leaders such as Falwell and Robertson helped mobilize voter
registration drives that drew millions into the political process
and contributed heavily to Reagan's two presidential victories. In
1988, Dugan said, Bush received 82 percent of the white evangelical
vote, his largest single voting bloc.
   But as Robertson and Falwell left the political spotlight to
concentrate on less earthly matters, some say evangelicals'
influence has waned.
   ``The well is dry for now,'' said Barry Lynn, legislative
director of the American Civil Liberties Union, a frequent opponent
of religious conservatives on church-state issues.
   Others, including University of Chicago historian Martin Marty,
say the ``superstars'' such as Falwell and Robertson have been
replaced by new leaders like radio psychologist and author James
Dobson, whose Family Research Council has chapters in 17 states
lobbying on issues such as abortion, home schooling and
pornography.
   The arrest of a Florida record store owner and two 2 Live Crew
members grew from a Focus on the Family mailing containing the
lyrics of the group's explicit rap album ``As Nasty as They Wanna
Be.''
   Upset with the Republican Part's apparent wavering on its
anti-abortion stance and the lack of concern expressed by Bush over
the National Endowments for the Arts controversy, evangelicals may
be looking for new political partners.
   ``If the president and the party don't wake up, they face the
possibility of a third party in 1992 that would end up giving the
White House to the Democrats,'' said Gary Bauer, a former domestic
policy adviser under Reagan who now oversees the Family Research
Council. ``These people are up for grabs in a major way.''
   Mainline churches have shown their political influence by
helping focus attention on human rights abuses in El Salvador and
working for congressional passage of the Civil Rights Restoration
Act, said Browning, the Episcopal bishop.
   But other observers say those churches are hurt by their
inability to mobilize grass-roots support among their
congregations.
   Alan D. Hertzke, author of ``Representing God in Washington,''
said liberal churches have been effective in lobbying for funds for
hunger relief and in limiting aid to the Nicaraguan Contras but
that some members of Congress discount their influence.
   ``There's pretty good evidence that most church members have no
knowledge of what their national church leaders are doing,'' said
Hertzke, a professor at the University of Oklahoma.
   Despite its absolute theological stance on many issues, the
Catholic Church has proven to be one of the most effective
religious players in the game of practical politics, Hertzke said.
   For example, he said, Catholics took the lead among religious
groups in the abortion debate in Pennsylvania and forsook an
``all-or-nothing'' approach to work successfully for a law
requiring a waiting period, for the woman's husband to be notified
and for parental consent to be required for minors.
   Catholic lobbyists also helped open the door for aid to
parochial schools by working for a child care bill that allows
church-run day care centers to be eligible for federal subsidies.
   But what may hurt the church's sway, some observers say, are
high-profile disciplinary actions such as the banning of one
legislator from the Communion rail and threatening others with
eternal damnation for their abortion-rights stands.
   Demoralization within the church over the clergy shortage and
internal liberal-conservative tensions also limit its influence,
said Marty, the University of Chicago historian.
   ``They're power brokers, but they're not all that powerful.
They're divided,'' he said.
   As the nation prepares for the possibility of war in the Middle
East, James Childress, author of ``Moral Responsibility in
Conflicts,'' is among those who fear religious groups aren't doing
enough to hold the nation accountable to its ``just-war''
tradition. That tradition requires war to be justified in moral
rather than economic terms.
   ``There's been fairly ready acceptance of the definition of our
national interest in this setting,'' said Childress, a University
of Virginia professor.
   If America enters a war with Iraq, Childress said, it appears a
majority of religious groups would support the administration.
   Others say that would be a serious miscalculation.
   The National Council of Churches has urged the administration to
halt its Persian Gulf buildup and begin withdrawing troops, and the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops has repeatedly expressed
reservations about the possibility of a U.S. offensive.
   ``We ignore the religious element to our peril,'' said Bishop
Herbert Chilstrom, spiritual leader of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America. ``There is a profound sense of religious belief
in our people.''

   The Associated Press poll on religion was
conducted by telephone Nov. 16-20 among a random sample of 1,006
adults in the contiguous United States. Interviewing was done by
ICR Survey Research Group of Media, Pa.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of sampling error, meaning
that 19 of 20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the
result if every adult American were asked the same questions. The
error margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of poential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions.
   Here is how the questions related to this story were phrased;
because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   - Is it all right for religious leaders, such as priests,
ministers and rabbis, to speak out on social issues? Yes: 75
percent. No: 20 percent. Don't know or No answer: 6 percent.
   - Is it all right for religious leaders, such as priests,
ministers and rabbis, to endorse political candidates? Yes: 34
percent. No: 58 percent. DK-NA: 8 percent.
   The people polled were asked, ``What is your religion?'' If they
said Protestant, Congregational, Episcopalian, Lutheran, Methodist,
Presbyterian or United Church of Christ, they were categorized as
mainline Protestant. The evangelical category comprised 10 other
responses, including Baptist, Church of God and Pentecostal.

   Juan Arreola crouched over a makeshift grill
beneath an interstate bridge, heating his supper of corn tortilla
and chile peppers.
   ``We are the poorest of all the workers, and that's why we are
here,'' Arreola says of the chile pickers who sleep under the
bridge they call ``Hotel Mira Estrellas,'' or ``The Hotel Star
Gazer.''
   He and the others can't afford the $2 a night for the
alternative, Arreola says, a soiled pad atop a metal frame in a
dingy laborer's barracks, where one toilet and sink must suffice
for 20 workers.
   Farm workers in the chile fields of New Mexico have demanded an
end to what they call exploitation. Growers say the pickers'
allegations unfairly tarnish all of them for the transgressions of
a few.
   But recent federal investigations support the complaints of the
pickers, who disrupted this year's multimillion-dollar harvest with
protests, strikes and demonstrations over substandard living
conditions and poverty-level wages.
   A backyard garden vegetable 15 years ago, chile peppers now are
New Mexico's largest cash food crop, and the state is the nation's
largest chile producer and exporter. Last year's crop was valued at
nearly $42 million.
   But some workers, who won legal stats through a 1986
immigration amnesty program, say they haven't shared in the
prosperity.
   ``They think it's a lot of money they're paying us,'' said Jesus
Vasquez of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, who has been living beneath the
bridge since May. ``But it's not enough.''
   Carlos Marentes, director of the Union de Trabajadores Agricolas
Fronterrizas, the border agricultural workers' union, said farm
workers earn an average of $6,000 for a family of seven, $12,000
less than the federal poverty line.
   Although federal law requires farmers to pay laborers the
minimum wage of $3.80 an hour, pickers are being paid the same
rates for a bucket of peppers as they were a decade ago, he said.
Meanwhile, the size of the bucket has gone from 6 gallons to 10
gallons.
   Farmers pay by the bucket picked, an average 60 cents to 70
cents. Even if a worker does not pick enough buckets to earn
$30.40, the minimum wage for an eight-hour day, farmers or labor
contractors are required by law to pay the hourly wage anyway.
   Union organizers and some pickers say farmers aren't complying.
   ``I have a wage receipt from a lady who worked ... eight hours,
and they have four hours on her work receipt. She made $21,'' said
Sandy New-Lopez, a union staff member.
   ``I think what they want is, they want the undocumented workers
they had before 1986 that would stay in the field all day and pick
for a few cents a bucket,'' Marentes said.
   Farmers believe the union has exaggerated the problems of a
minority of workers.
   ``I think they bring up isolated incidents,'' said Don Hackey,
chairman of the New Mexico Chile Commission, which represents many
of the state's estimated 400 chile growers. ``They find something
that's happened to an individual and then portray it as widespread
and say that's how we all work. That's absolutely not true.''
   Hackey said he pays 100 to 150 workers picking his 300 acres as
much as 80 cents a bucket. His own survey of workers on his field
found the average wage was $54 for about eight hours work.
   ``The only complaint I hear from my people is, `Gosh, I wish we
had this all year,' '' Hackey said.
   U.S. Labor Department investigators sent out in August found 63
cases of violations of various federal laws, said Andy Chavez,
district director of the Albuquerque Wage and Hour Division of the
Labor Department.
   A second investigation of 51 growers and farm labor contractors
that ended in October found 142 violations. Only six of the 51 were
in compliance with laws protecting farm workers, many of whom say
they were better off before they were granted amnesty.
   ``I thought it would be a lot better now that I am legal,'' said
Jose Cadena, 25, who was trying to sleep one night in a pickup
truck parked beneath an interstate bridge. ``But now it's a lot
worse. They used to give housing to the illegal aliens and food.
Now we have to pay for our own.''
   Tierra del Sol, a non-profit group that provides housing for
farm workers, estimated about 17,000 work in southern New Mexico.
Among them are permanent laborers who live in the towns where they
work, migratory workers who follow the crops, and a commuter
population that comes from Juarez and is recruited in El Paso,
Texas, about 90 miles from Hatch.
   On the same night Cadena was sleeping his camper, a few workers
huddled beneath flimsy blankets on an El Paso street, trying to get
a little sleep. Many workers sought shelter inside parked buses;
others paced the street to stay awake.
   Most of those workers can be found in pre-dawn hours at the foot
of the Paso del Norte Bridge in downtown El Paso, waiting for labor
contractors who will hire them for another day's work.
   Gregorio Lopez, 33, said he usually arrives at the bridge about
1 a.m. after catching a 10 p.m. bus from his home in Juarez. The
buses usually return him from the fields at about 6 p.m. or 7 p.m.
   ``All I have a chance to do is shower and eat and come back,''
he said. ``I sleep on the bus. I get about 1{ hours sleep.''
   Lopez said he didn't like to sleep on the street because workers
who do often awake to find their shoes, jacket or money stolen.
   ``More and more people are sleeping out on the street. They're
not street people, they are farm laborers,'' said Bill Belt,
regional administrator of the U.S. Department of Labor Wage and
Hour Division. ``These are good, hard-working people.
Unfortunately, they are caught in a bad situation.''
   Grower Eliseo Flores believes the producers are the ones with
the problems.
   ``We need some real help. What we got is a bunch of dadgum trash
that litter the town and litter the fields. We were better off with
wets (undocumented workers),'' said Flores, who farms 200 acres.
``These people, they go to the bathroom 20 times a day, or they go
in the fields. ... We got a bunch of winos and drug addicts.''
   Flores said he's been forced to knock down houses he set up for
workers because the structures were vandalized and didn't meet
federal standards.
   Hackey, the chile commission chairman, said farmers already pay
taxes and shouldn't have to subsidize housing for workers.
   Instead, he said, the commission supports Tierra del Sol, which
has built an apartment complex for laborers in Hatch and is trying
to build another in Anthony on the Texas-New Mexico state line.
   ``No one is really at fault for their situation,'' said Rose
Garcia, Tierra del Sol's executive director. ``Unfortunately,
because they are farm workers, they are the working homeless.''

<DATELINE>GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Perhaps it's a sign of better times in
tough old Glasgow that this year's biggest uproar was about the
past.
   Critics attacked an exhibition about the city's 800 years, which
stressed its relations with the world, for ``sanitizing history.''
   Glasgow's Glasgow, as it was called, closed Nov. 5 and was the
city's biggest attraction in 50 years, drawing half a million
visitors. The show may have lost more than $8 million in a 30-week
run, which the city will have to cover.
   City Hall will announce the cost in February when it presents
the entire bill for the city's year as the European Capital of
Culture.
   The exhibition, promoted as ``Everything Glasgow gave to the
world ... and more,'' was the centerpiece of the year-long festival
celebrating the title bestowed by culture ministers of the
12-nation European Community. Athens, Florence, Amsterdam, Berlin
and Paris were chosen in earlier years.
   Jill Campbell Mackay, public relations director for the cultural
year, said the title Glasgow's Glasgow ``meant how the city
perceived itself as perceived by the outside world.''
   Under 22 arches of storage space below the central railway
station, unused for 60 years, the show assembled 3,200 artifacts of
history, industry and social life.
   They ranged from a model of the yacht Shamrock V, with which
Glasgow grocery tycoon Sir Thomas Lipton made five unsuccessful
tries for the America's Cup, to the suitcase of an emigrant who
paid 2 pounds (then $10) for passage to Canada in the 1920s.
   Documentary films lauded Glasgow's greatness as the second city
of the British Empire, an industrial cornucopia that poured out
textiles, locomotives, weapons and, by 1913, about 60 percent of
the world's ships.
   ``I think the exhibition was a great success,'' said Robert
Palmer, director of the cultural year. ``A space which was dripping
wet, unusable and derelict was renovated, and that space and the
new Arches Theater there seem certain to become a permanent part of
the city's life.''
   An unusual partnership of business and a socialist council
budgeted 50 million pounds ($80 million when the year began) to
make Cultural Capital 1990 a success. About $7 million went for
Glasgow's Glasgow.
   Commercial sponsors contributed cash, materials and assistance
valued at about $1.2 million.
   U.S. Ambassador Henry E. Catto visited the show June 20 and
called it the ``most imaginative exhibition of its kind I have ever
seen.''
   Sniper fire was aimed at it regularly, however, by the daily
Glasgow Herald and Workers' City, a group of left-wing and
anarchist writers, poets, folk musicians and workers. The 60 or so
active Workers' City members champion the class struggle against
what they regard as Glasgow's yuppie ascendancy.
   Glasgow is renowned for fierce partisanship. Alone among British
cities, it is regarded as having come close to revolution - in
1919, during a general strike.
   The red flag was raised in George Square when 20,000
demonstrators demanded a 40-hour work week. While the sheriff read
them the Riot Act, ordering them to disperse, a bottle hit him on
the head. Forty people were seriously injured when horse and foot
police charged the crowd.
   A photograph of tanks and troops assembled at the Cattle Market
was part of Glasgow's Glasgow.
   Although unemployment remains above 14 percent, the cultural
capital designation recognized Glasgow's self-regeneration from
industrial blight, slums, ill health and violence to a humming
center of commerce, tourism and the arts.
   The poor have been moved out of the city center and their
tenements demolished, but to Workers' City they are no better off
in the bleak, damp tower blocks erected for them on Glasgow's
periphery.
   ``We have been accused of being pro-poverty, but it isn't
true,'' said Brendan McLaughlin, owner of the Scotia Bar, where
Workers' City meets.
   ``In the interests of privatizing Glasgow and presenting it as a
place without problems, the Glasgow's Glasgow exhibition buries our
history of industrial struggle.''
   John Murray, the show's marketing executive, said: ``We had the
slums, the drink, the gambling, the crime, the sickness and death
alongside the shipyards, the factories, the scientists and the new
industries.''
   In hopes of making a profit, Glasgow District Council set an
admission charge of 4 pounds (then $6.50) when the show opened in
April.
   After public and press criticism, the price was reduced in July
to a pound (about $1.60). Total attendance was 501,105, largest for
such a show in Glasgow since the Empire Exhibition of 1938
attracted 12{ million visitors from around the world. That one lost
money, too.
   ``No exhibition makes money, but the cost of subsidizing
Glasgow's Glasgow was only half the cost of others in Europe,''
said Doug Clelland, the architect who devised it.
   Clelland is proud of the exhibition's appeal. ``We did three
exit surveys and found 30 percent of the people visiting it had
never before set foot in a museum or gallery,'' he said.

   One year after parachuting into
Panama at the height of fighting that overthrew Manual Noriega,
Pfc. Bruce Krot faces another Christmas away from home threatened
with war.
   This year, at least, he'll have Christmas dinner with his wife,
Melissa. She's also in Saudi Arabia with the U.S. Army's 82nd
Airborne Division, which she joined nine months ago.
   ``We were separated last year. She didn't want it to happen
again,'' said Krot, 21, of Dearborn, Mich., who serves with a
company of military police. ``But I consider my company part of my
family. We support each other.''
   It is a soldier's lot in life sometimes to celebrate a season of
peace and good will in a theater of war. The 82nd Airborne landed
the first U.S. ground forces in Saudi Arabia under Operation Desert
Shield.
   The 82nd, known as the All American division, is the Army's only
division with what the military calls ``forced entry capability.''
Its troops can parachute into a country or wade ashore if there are
no friendly airfields or bases.
   Last Dec. 20, elements of the 82nd carried the brunt of fighting
in Panama to overthrow and arrest Noreiga during Operation Just
Cause. Some like Krot jumped in. Others were on the ground doing
jungle training or came ashore on helicopters or in amphibious
assaults.
   This year, the division is part of a multinational force
assembled against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   ``It's a trying time. Everybody would love to be back home with
their families and loved ones, but we have to carry out our
mission,'' said Sgt. Elton Moton, 25, of Newport News, Va. ``You
live with it. Accept it. We're all volunteers.''
   Spec. Lee Etris, 25, of Greenville, S.C., said, ``When you're
away from home, these guys tend to become family. We all put up
with the same hardships. We're all in it together.''
   There's a bond in enduring the same misery. Somehow, it's easier
to take when your buddy has to bear the same relentless heat, slug
it out in the sand, put up with the flies, cope with the same
isolation.
   ``It's been hell. You end up falling back on your buddies to
pull you through,'' said Spec. Brian Langston, 22, a medic from
Daytona Beach, Fla. He treated four of them for wounds last year in
Panama.
   The lead elements of the 82nd fully expected to be in a shooting
match with the Iraqis when their plane doors opened in August and
they got their first blast of desert heat. They were given bullets
for their rifles and double-checked their gas masks to face down
Saddam's 20 divisions.
   ``We were calling ourselves speed bumps for a while. All we
could have done is slowed him down,'' said Spec. Mark Mattson, 30,
of Port Huron, Mich.
   Since then, about 250,000 U.S. troops have followed the 82nd
Airborne into the Saudi desert. But the four months of waiting have
taken their toll while the diplomats wage a war of words.
   ``It's been a roller coaster,'' said Sgt. Duane Barker, 23, of
Mansfield, Ohio, who has been away at Christmas five times in the
past six years. ``The worst part of all is not knowing. Nobody
minds doing the job. Nobody has a fear of fighting. The frustration
comes from not knowing.''
   So the paratroopers train and wait, knowing that Christmas
brings them even closer to the Jan. 15 deadline for the use of
force set by the United Nations if Iraq hasn't pulled out of
Kuwait.

   Parliament has banned nude advertising and
paved the way for restaurants and cinemas to be shut down during
the Sabbath.
   The laws are part of a package of sweeping religious legislation
that the ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel party demanded when it joined
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's governing coalition.
   They are likely to heighten the rift between Israel's
non-observant Jewish majority and religious Jews who have political
clout far outweighing their numbers.
   In a vote of 44 in favor to 42 against, the Knesset, or
parliament, gave final approval Monday to a law prohibiting nudity
or partial nudity ``with sexual overtones,'' on city billboards or
bus stops.
   Religious legislators claim posters featuring partially clad
models violate Jewish dictates of modest dress for men and women.
   A second bill, submitted by the National Religious Party,
enables local councils to shut down restaurants, theaters and other
places of entertainment on Friday night and Saturday, the
sunset-to-sunset Jewish Sabbath.
   The bill passed 50 to 44 with one abstention.
   Left-wing legislators argued that the bills are an infringement
on the rights of the roughly 70 percent of Israelis who are not
orthodox Jews. They appealed to secular right-wing Knesset members
not to support what one called the law of the ``Middle Ages.''
   Tel Aviv Mayor Shlomo Lahat condemned religious parties as
increasing tensions with secular Israelis.
   He told Israel Television that places of entertainment will
remain open in his city during the Sabbath despite the new law.
   Ultra-Orthodox parties are also seeking legislation tightening
restrictions on public buses that travel on Friday nights and
Saturday. Religious law expressly bans travel on the Sabbath.
   The Agudat Israel party is demanding a fourth law that would ban
the sale of pork in Israel. Jewish dietary laws forbid pork
consumption.

   Byron De La Beckwith, twice tried but
never convicted in the 1963 shooting death of civil rights leader
Medgar Evers, was arrested Monday as a fugitive from Mississippi,
authorities said.
   Beckwith, 70, who lives nearby in Signal Mountain, Tenn., was
being held Monday night at the Hamilton County jail pending an
extradition hearing, said Lt. F.A. Wilson of the Hamilton County
Sheriff's Department.
   Wilson said he didn't know the charges against Beckwith.
   ``He's a fugitive from Hinds County, Miss., and that's what the
warrant says,'' Wilson said.
   Beckwith's extradition to Mississippi hinges on whether he signs
a waiver at a hearing Tuesday in Chattanooga, Wilson said.
   An investigation of Evers' slaying has been reopened in Hinds
County, Miss., where a grand jury heard testimony last week in the
case.
   Hinds County District Attorney Ed Peters said he had no comment
on Beckwith's arrest and would not say whether Beckwith had been
indicted in connection with the revived Evers' investigation.
   Peters said if there were indictments in the Evers' case, they
would not be unsealed until an arrest is made. He would not say if
there were indictments, however.
   Evers was shot in the back with a high-powered rifle as he stood
in the carport of his Jackson home on June 12, 1963.
   Beckwith, a Delta fertilizer salesman at the time, was arrested
in the shooting. He was tried twice in 1964 and twice both
all-white juries deadlocked on verdicts. The murder charge was
dismissed in 1969.
   Evers, 37 when he died, was field secretary for the Mississippi
branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People. Beckwith has maintained his innocence, but his philosophy
permits no room for blacks, Jews, Asians or any race other than
white.
   ``There are only three kinds of people that live in
Mississippi,'' Beckwith told The Clarion-Ledger of Jackson, Miss.,
in an interview from his home published last Sunday. ``Whites,
colored and trash, and there's very little trash in Mississippi.''
   Beckwith said that while he was ``not willing to lay my life
down to rid evil from this country,'' he said. ``I'm willing to
kill the evil in this country that would try to push me out.''
   Beckwith was released Friday from the Veterans Administration
Medical Center in Nashville after undergoing surgery for a clot in
his carotid artery.
   He said he expected to return to the medical center soon for
further treatments for high blood pressure.
   Despite failing health, Beckwith said he would possibly
represent himself in court if he was charged again in Evers's
death.

<HEAD>Alleged Health Insurance Scam Leaves Victims in Shock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PUL NOWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald Gilmore got a shock when he
returned home after his heart transplant operation.
   Like thousands of other victims of a $21 million fraud scheme,
Gilmore learned his health insurance policy was worthless and
couldn't cover the cost of the $200,000 procedure.
   ``The hospital has been pretty good through it all. They haven't
pushed me for the money. But this whole thing's been pretty bad,''
said the 49-year-old retired brewery worker from Robbins.
   A federal grand jury last week charged six officers of a
Charlotte company with bilking Gilmore and more than 1,350 other
families and individuals out of their insurance benefits and
pocketing $21 million.
   CAP Programs Inc. and several associated businesses never paid
millions in medical claims for workers at 120 small businesses, the
indictment charged.
   To Gilmore, the first hints of trouble came when he was
recovering at Duke University Medical Center after receiving his
new heart in October 1989. His coverage was provided by his wife's
employer, a small textile company.
   ``The bills started coming in right away. I called them (CAP)
and they kept giving me the runaround,'' he said. ``Finally, it
came out that they just weren't going to pay.''
   All the while, prosecutors say, the defendants were living the
high life, using the premiums to buy lavish homes, beachfront
condominiums and luxury cars.
   ``I'd like to see them serve a long hard time in prison,'' said
Gilmore, who retired from Stroh's Brewery in Winston-Salem after a
heart attack in 1981. ``I'd like to see them spend their time
making little rocks out of big rocks.''
   Gilmore has been unable to get health insurance now because of
his medical condition.
   ``They took advantage of people who had no reason to suspect a
thing,'' he said, explaining that CAP had paid $14,000 in bills
when he had an earlier hernia operation.
   Federal officials said that was typical of a ``Ponzi'' scheme, a
fraud in which money taken in initially by swindlers is used to
make early payouts and lure in more money.
   Julian De La Rosa, inspector general of the U.S. Labor
Department, said the health insurance scheme was one of about three
dozen now under investigation. He estimated the victims of such
frauds numbered in the tens of thousands.
   ``What is especially frightening is that we all can be
victimized by this type of criminal enterprise because each of us
has a very fundamental need for a health insurance policy that will
assure us and our families that we can afford the health care we
may need,'' he said.
   The indictment said CAP told customers their medical bills would
be covered by the Travelers Insurance Co. But Travelers was
responsible only for processing claims.
   In an agreement with North Carolina officials, Travelers has
paid some medical claims. The company also is suing CAP.
   The 120 companies that used CAP are in North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania and
Illinois.
   The issue of such health insurance scams was the subject of
hearings last spring in the Senate. Lawmakers heard numerous tales
like that of Gilmore.
   For example, the parents of a 3-year-old leukemia victim from
Alabama testified they were left with $250,000 in bills when CAP
did not pay their claim.
   The six defendants are Robert W. Long, Victor S. Blackwell and
Jerry M. Wolicki of Charlotte; David R. Harris, of Greenville,
S.C.; Michael A. Krebser, of Stuart, Fla., and Michael H. Spieles,
of Palm City, Fla.
   None of the defendants could be reached for comment. Long,
Blackwell and Krebser all have non-published numbers, and there
were no listings for Wolicki, Harris and Spieles at the addresses
given by law enforcement officials.
   Officials also seized seven homes, 26 vehicles and business and
personal bank accounts from the men worth an estimated $3 million.
   U.S. Attorney Tom Ashcraft said the seized assets would be used
to help the victims of the scam, but ``it would be a mistake to
think there is a big pot of gold out there.''
   Charges include mail fraud, money laundering, embezzlement and
conspiracy. If convicted, they could get five to 10 years in prison
and fines of $250,000 to $500,000 on each of the counts.

<HEAD>Tree Farm Experience Unnecessary, Prison Sentence Is</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELLEFONTE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experience isn't necessary for a job
working with 5,000 Christmas trees on a central Pennsylvania farm.
A prison sentence is.
   On the north flank of Mount Nittany, 53 felons from the
medium-security Rockview state prison grow firs, pines and spruce
from seedlings to centerpieces.
   Forty-one of the prisoners live in unlocked trailers on the side
of the mountain. In the last 13 years there has been one escape.
   ``The guys who would cause a problem will not even get a smell
of his place,'' said Jack Allar, the superintendent's assistant at
the prison.
   The camp was set up in the mid-1950s to manage the 3,500 acres
of forest on prison property.
   ``We started 10 years ago putting an emphasis on the Christmas
trees, and we're just a year or two away from having enough to
supply all the other state institutions,'' said Sgt. Jim Moore, a
prison guard and instructor.
   A 15-footer is in the Rockview rotunda and a tree 7 feet, 8{
inches tall is in the prison chapel. About 150 others were chopped
for State Police barracks, the Transportation Department and other
Pennsylvania offices.
   Only government agencies get the trees; they can't be bought.
State law prohibits anything being taken off prison property unless
it goes to other state facilities or is sold as surplus.
   ``The theme is not to compete with private industry. It's to
train prisoners in a skill,'' Allar said.
   The camp is a mile up a narrow road from the prison's main
cellblocks. There are no locks on the trailer doors, the guards
aren't armed and a major state highway is a short hike away.
There's not even a fence to climb.
   ``If you think that's something, imagine taking 15 inmates over
the mountain with two chainsaws and 15 axes and all you have is a
radio,'' said Moore.
   The incentive to stay in line is a quick trip back to the main
prison, said inmate Elwood F. Barnes, who is serving time for
burglary. ``No one wants to go back there,'' he said.
   In a twist, the crimes committed here are perpetrated from the
outside.
   ``Somebody always steals the best tree. We have to keep cutting
earlier and earlier to beat the people who come and cut the best
trees,'' Moore said.
   The Christmas trees start out as seedlings in a wood-and-plastic
greenhouse and are transplanted to plots on the 7,000-acre prison
complex. Instructors from a nearby university, and videotapes they
leave behind, show prisoners how to shear.
   In six to 12 years, the trees are ready for harvest. Trees that
aren't perfect wind up in Yule logs that are sent to prison
offices.
   Most of the inmates won't be in prison long enough to see a
seedling turn into a room's centerpiece. Many are here long enough
to learn enough of a new skill, though.
   ``One man now has his own tree surgery business,'' said Bb
Radomsky, who runs the forestry work camp. ``He never had a job
before he came in here, except selling drugs.''
   Another man who excelled at tree pruning left with two skills,
since he also had completed the prison's barber course.
   ``He was the best Christmas tree shearer in the place,''
Radomsky said.

   EL-OBEID, Sudan (AP) - Like thousands of others suffering the
effects of a worsening drought and threatened by famine, Awadalla
Bakheit and his family straggled across western Sudan seeking help.
   Yet, like other refugees streaming into this regional capital,
they may merely be given some food and money and shipped back to
the countryside.
   The government is trying to discourage a large permanent camp in
el-Obeid, which is proving to be an uphill battle.
   ``I walked four days to reach here. We're just waiting for the
will of God and what the government will decide,'' said 35-year-old
Bakheit at the Rukub camp for displaced persons 10 miles north of
the city.
   Weary-looking men, women and children cluster under the few
trees, seeking shade. Tents are not provided, a tactic by the
military government to prevent settlement.
   Across Sudan, Africa's largest nation, two consecutive years of
drought conditions have led to fears a serious famine may loom.
   In the Kordofan region of which el-Obeid is the capital, nearly
a third of the 3.5 million inhabitants have been affected.
   Authorities in el-Obeid, about 200 miles southwest of Khartoum,
have delcared the region a disaster area, but the central
government refuses to officially acknowledge the crisis.
   Famine has struck most of the country, affecting up to 7 million
of its 25 million people, and much worse is expected within six
months. Relief professionals say a million tons of food are needed
to avert disaster.
   The United States and other Western donors have condemned the
government for refusing to acknowledge that an emergency exists,
thus preventing the international relief operation needed to head
off mass starvation.
   Ahmed Omer, deputy director of the Rukub camp, said 9,000 people
recently arrived from the nearby countryside.
   ``We will supply them with a month's food and pocket money,'' he
said.
   They are then sent packing in trucks, either back home or to
areas where they can find work.
   Omer said turning people away from the camp was part of the
policy of Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir's government not to
encourage large settlements.
   In 1984-85, thousands died in Sudanese camps from lack of
adequate food and medicine.
   Col. Faisal Medani Mukhtar, the region's military governor, was
quoted by the government newspaper Al-Inkaz Al-Watany as saying his
region needs 330,000 tons of food to see it through until the next
harvest in late 1991.
   A lack of rain made this winter's harvest a total failure, and
schools were closed after recent rioting and looting of food
stocks.
   Omer said the emergency has been eased somewhat by distribution
in some areas of 3,500 sacks of dura, the Sudanese staple sorghum,
provided by the European Community and the government.
   Displaced people arrive at the camps in ``fairly good health,''
according to Omer, although he attested to a few malnourished
children.
   Comprehensive health records do not exist, but el-Obeid's
hospital admitted 15 adults and children over a two-day period
suffering from malnutrition or related problems such as overeating.
   An official at the hospital said the overeating occurred when
people who had gone without food for days stuffed themselves at a
relief kitchen. He said no hunger-related deaths had been reported
in the el-Obeid hospital.
   Western Kordofan also faces a shortage of drinking water because
it depends on rainwater as its main source.
   The regional capital's 600,000 residents have only a third of
the 1.5 billion gallons of water they need daily, government's
television has reported, and the locals blame their thirst partly
on the displaced people at Rukub and other camps.
   Libya has offered to help build a pipeline more than 30 miles
long to solve the region's water needs. But the project would not
be completed in time to help this year's drought victims.
   The United Nations' children's organization UNICEF has provided
$50,000 to buy water pumps.

   Everybody and his dog now can munch tropical
treats being pitched to consumers as the new way to save shrinking
rain forests.
   Sales of such products as ice cream, mixed nuts and peanut
brittle for pooches are beginning to channel money from
environmentally conscious customers in the United States to the
impoverished inhabitants of the distant forests.
   So far, the products are heavily dependent on nuts for snacks.
But promoters are hoping to expand to a broader range of consumer
goods like soaps, cosmetics and furniture polish.
   The idea is to make sure that the world's rain forests are worth
more standing - and producing sustainable harvests - than cut for
timber or cleared for pasture.
   ``This by itself is not going to save the world's rain
forests,'' said Jason Clay, an anthropologist who has become an
importer of forest nuts, oils and fruits. ``But this can become an
important part of saving the rain forests and other fragile
ecosystems.''
   Clay is research director of Cultural Survival Inc. in
Cambridge, Mass., a non-profit group set up in 1972 to promote land
rights and alternative development schemes for indigenous peoples
in the Third World.
   The World Resources Institute estimated recently that 40 million
to 50 million acres of tropical forests are vanishing each year, a
pace that could wipe them out by the end of the century.
Environmentalists say this is likely to accelerate global warming,
because the forests soak up some of the world's production of
carbon dioxide.
   Scientists say the rain forests also are valuable as a home to
an abundance of plant, animal and insect species that live nowhere
else, some of which could prove useful in ways no one today can
imagine. Many are likely to become extinct as their habitat
shrinks.
   In 1989, Cultural Survival got into the business of promoting
trade in forest products as a way to get money into the hands of
the people they were trying to help.
   It is selling imports, mostly Brazil nuts and cashews, to 17
companies currently marketing products in the United States -
including Rainforest Crunch and Bowser Brittle. It also has
provided samples to 75 companies for product development, Clay said
in a telephone interview.
   ``In hand, we have about $4.1 million in orders for 1991,'' Clay
said. ``We estimate that within five years we're going to be doing
more than $50 million worth of business.''
   Besides creating new income for people living in the forest,
Cultural Survival is plowing its profits back into projects to
strengthen native groups, producer co-ops and other local
organizations, including rubber tappers.
   So far, most of its work has been in Brazil, but it is expanding
into Bolivia and Peru and has bought some dried fruit from Honduras
and Belize, honey and beeswax from Zambia, jams and jellies from
the Philippines and other products from Ecuador, Colombia and
Botswana.
   Cultural Survival's biggest customer is Community Products, set
up by Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben and Jerry's Homemade ice cream.
It produces Rainforest Crunch, both as candy for direct sale and as
an ingredient in Ben and Jerry's Rainforest Crunch ice cream.
   ``The concept is a really powerful one,'' said Martha Broad,
co-manager of Community Products, which is based in Montpelier, Vt.
Customers like the taste, but ``they're also excited that we're
helping the people in the rain forest.''
   This year, 300,000 pounds of cashews and Brazil nuts went into
Rainforest Crunch, Ms. Broad said, adding that a new product is
coming: chocolate chip Brazil nut cookies.
   Then there's Bowser Brittle, a concoction of rain forest
cashews, vanilla extract, wheat germ, flour, eggs and peanuts with
a label telling buyers they ``contribute to the saving of the rain
forest.''
   ``The dogs seem to like it. It's one of our two top sellers,''
said Teri Goodman, a partner in Dandy Doggie, a San Francisco-based
manufacturer of dog treats.
   Randy Hayes, head of the San Francisco-based Rainforest Action
Network, said environmental activists see marketing of forest
products as a necessary part of a strategy to save the forests.
   ``There's a common misconception that the tropical rain forest
is unoccupied by humans,'' Hayes said.
   In addition, he said, such products as Rainforest Crunch reach
people unlikely to read ecology magazines or join environmental
groups, but who may take an interest in the world's threatened
forests.
   ``There's been too much preaching to the choir,'' he said. ``The
environmental movement has sadly become a special interest group.
This is an excellent way of reaching out to other segments of
society.''

   Former Chief Justice Earl Warren, songwriter
Cole Porter, the game of basketball and the effort to explore space
are among the subjects planned for the nation's 1991 postage
stamps.
   The year is expected to lead off with a flower stamp, carrying
no cost denomination, and a so-called make-up-rate stamp.
   New postage rates are expected to take effect in late January or
early February, with a 30-cent first class charge considered
likely.
   But the rate won't be determined until the Postal Rate
Commission reports next month, so non-denominated stamps have been
printed to handle any eventuality.
   As with past rate changes, the stamps carry a letter, and the
progression is up to ``F.'' This stamp will carry a flower design
to match the letter, much as the last such stamp, lettered E,
carried an image of the Earth.
   In addition, the make-up stamp will be valued at the amount of
the cost increase - which means that adding it to a 25-cent stamp
will equal the new rate. The design for this stamp hasn't been
disclosed yet.
   The first regular stamp issue of 1991 will come on Jan. 25 as a

<HEAD>With Threat, Sikh Militants Force Women To Give Up Western Dress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARBAKSH S. NANDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHANDIGARH, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After killing thousands of people in a
seven-year separatist insurrection, Sikh extremists in Punjab state
are now telling people what they to wear.
   The extremists, fighting to set up a theocratic nation in the
rich farming state, have threatened to kill Punjabi women unless
they stop wearing jeans and other Western clothing.
   Sikh men have been told not to trim their beards and women have
been warned not to pluck their eyebrows or use makeup.
   The dress code was announced Dec. 10 by the Panthic Committee,
an umbrella group for five militant Sikh organizations. About 54
percent of Punjab's 17 million people are Sikhs. Most of the rest
are Hindus.
   Failure to comply with the ``dress code'' will mean death, the
Panthic Committee said in its decree, which was published in local
newspapers.
   The threat has had considerable impact.
   A survey Friday of colleges and other public haunts of the young
in the state capital of Chandigarh found no girl or woman wearing
jeans, skirts or other Western dress.
   Most were clad in salwar kameez, the traditional knee-length
tunic worn over voluminous trousers. Their heads were covered with
flowing scarves called dupattas.
   B.K. Sharma, a leading garment seller, said his sale of jeans
has ``nose-dived,'' dropping by 25 percent. ``I am now planning to
switch over to selling Punjabi dresses,'' he said.
   Threats from the militants last month prompted state government
officials to stop using Hindi, the national language, at the
workplace and instead use Punjabi.
   Two local stations of government-run All India Radio stopped
relaying Hindi- and English-language news and song programs from
its headquarters in New Delhi. Sikh gunmen killed the director of
one of the stations Dec. 6 because he had not immediately stopped
the Hindi-language broadcasts.
   Punjab's outgoing Gov. Virendra Verma admitted Friday that the
government had ``to some extent'' succumbed to pressure from the
extremists, the Times of India newspaper reported.
   The militants have also banned the singing of India's national
anthem, which is in the ancient Sanskrit language, at morning
assemblies in schools.
   A school principal, Nirmal Kanta, was murdered Thursday after
refusing to stop the singing.
   The secessionist movement began in 1983, but this is the first
time the militants have sought to enforce a wide range of social
changes through the threat of force.
   The separatists this year have killed 3,100 people, according to
the government, more than any previous year.
   The Panthic Committee last week asked journalists to stop
referring to Sikh extremists as ``terrorists.'' Three days later
``militant'' had largely replaced ``terrorists'' in major
newspapers and the two national news agencies.
   Police officials still refer to the Sikhs as ``terrorists.''
   Khushwant Singh, a respected Sikh historian and journalist who
lives in New Delhi, said people are obeying the militants' orders
out of fear. But he predicted the scare was temporary.
   ``It happens, but it dies down. Nobody will give a damn about
these thugs in a week or two,'' said Singh, who opposes the
separatist campaign.
   Sikh separatists complain of cultural, political and economic
discrimination by India's officially secular but Hindu-dominated
government.
   The Sikh faith, founded about 1500, has roots in both Islam and
Hinduism. While they constitute a majority of the Punjabi
population, Sikhs nationwide comprise 2 percent of India's 880
million people, who are 82 percent Hindus and 12 percent Moslems.

<HEAD>Researchers Successfully Deepfreeze, Revive Water Fleas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese research team has successfully revived
small insects after deepfreezing them for nearly two weeks in what
could be a step toward prolonging the life of larger animals.
   Scientists say they believe the defrosting of water fleas by a
team led by Professor Ichiro Tanasawa of the Tokyo University was
the first time complex multicellular organisms have been revived
after being frozen to minus 321 degrees.
   At that temperature, metabolism virtually halts, ``and
theoretically, organisms can be kept frozen for any length of time
and then revived,'' Tanasawa says.
   Tanasawa's team first chilled the water fleas to almost freezing
to slow their metabolism. It then soaked them for several hours in
a glycerin solution, which penetrated their cells and lowered the
freezing point, like the anti-freeze in a car radiator.
   The glycerin also prevented formation of large ice crystals
inside the fleas' organs and caused the insects to freeze more
uniformly, Tanasawa said. They then were cooled at a controlled
rate to minus minus 321 degrees (196 Centigrade).
   A British research group first successfully used glycerin, a
non-poisonous, syrupy liquid, to freeze chicken sperm in 1960, and
the technique is now widely used to preserve blood cells and simple
organisms.
   The main difficulty in using it for more complicated organisms
has been glycerin's low penetration rate.
   Without its anti-freeze effect, ice crystals form from the water
inside cells, drying them out and damaging them, said Dr. Harold
Meryman, assistant director of blood services for the U.S. Red
Cross.
   ``Ice inside the tissue causes tremendous damage,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   Tanasawa said about 90 percent of the water fleas, which
resemble regular fleas but live in water, were defrosted in perfect
condition in his experiment.
   He said his research group spent two years experimenting with
different glycerin concentrations and freezing rates before it
achieved success.
   ``We hope to make the process more sophisticated so we can have
a 100 percent success rate and be able to use it for larger
organisms,'' he said.
   ``Then people will be able to freeze things that they want to
revive at a later time. For example, baby fish could be frozen
until there is greater seasonal demand, and then be defrosted and
allowed to grow.''
   But humans hoping to prolong their own lives will have to wait.
   ``I will not accept a generalization that this opens the door
for the freezing of much larger tissues,'' Meryman said.
   ``Many other people have tried freezing mammalian tissues using
similar methods without success. It is not currently possible to
prevent significant damage to large organs from ice crystals.''
   Tanasawa says his goal is much smaller - to successfully freeze
and revive organisms about 10 times the size of a flea.
   ``Water fleas don't do anyone much good,'' he said. ``Next I
want to try something useful.''

<HEAD>Politicians, Pentagon Weigh Target Bombing of Island off Maui</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DIPIETRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bombing of Kahoolawe has stopped. The
question is, for how long?
   Use of the pockmarked, 27,000-acre island by the military for
target practice has been suspended for two years. The political
maneuvering over who ultimately will get control of Kahoolawe is
just beginning.
   The dry, mostly barren island 10 miles west of Maui has been
ravaged by 49 years of conventional bombing by U.S. planes and
warships. Some historical sites have been damaged, the landscape
has been scarred and topsoil has been lost to erosion caused by
bombs and grazing goats and sheep. The bombing has also been a
source of deep pain for native Hawaiians who view the island, with
its ancient shrines, as a sacred place.
   The former penal colony and cattle ranch was seized by the Navy
in 1941 after Pearl Harbor. Kahoolawe had been used for target
bombing since 1953, until President Bush signed the 1991 Defense
Appropriations Bill on Nov. 5.
   The bill contained an amendment sponsored by Sen. Daniel Akaka,
D-Hawaii, that puts a halt to the bombing for two years. The law
also established a commission to help determine the best way to
return the island to the state.
   But the threat of war in the Middle East has military officials
pressing for limited use of the island. Some who worked to halt the
bombing worry that Bush may issue an executive order permitting
military use of the island if war begins with Iraq.
   The Kahoolawe Island Conveyance Commission includes two
appointees from Gov. John Waihee, two Navy appointees and an
appointee from the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. The commission's
first meeting was scheduled for today.
   The panel can recommend a ban on all military use or allow the
military unlimited or partial access to the island. The three
non-Navy appointees oppose any bombing. The panel's recommendations
are subject to approval by Congress.
   Cmdr. Joel Keefer, a spokesman for the Navy's Pacific Command,
said Kahoolawe is needed to train troops for the long term, not
just for Operation Desert Shield.
   ``Kahoolawe offers us the only place for the kind of training we
need to perform ... aircraft, gunfire support, amphibious
landings,'' Keefer said. ``We have forces in the Pacific and we
need to train them where they are.''
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, has flip-flopped on the the issue
twice in recent months. He was a longtime advocate of the
military's use of Kahoolawe, then came out in support of Akaka's
bill before the November election and pledged to work for the
return of the island to Hawaii.
   Last week, he said the island is needed to train troops for
Operation Desert Shield.
   Inouye's reversal ``disappointed many of us,'' said Dr. Noa
Emmett Aluli, co-founder of the Protect Kahoolawe Ohana and a
member of the commission. Aluli helped form the Protect Kahoolawe
Ohana in 1975 and has taken part in several ``occupations'' of the
island to prevent target bombing.
   Aluli said the island holds a special spiritual and cultural
significance to native Hawaiians. Ancient Hawaiians were the only
people ever to inhabit the island. There are fishing shrines,
agricultural shrines, major temples and housing sites, which have
landed Kahoolawe on the National Register of Historic Places.
   ``The history of our ancient Hawaiian people is intact on
Kahoolawe,'' Aluli said. ``No way will I allow a resumption of
bombing.''
   Maui Mayor Hannibal Tavares, another commission member, said as
the western part of Maui becomes more populated bombing of
Kahoolawe becomes more dangerous because errant shells can strike
the cities of Lahaina and Kihei.
   Tavares and others say the military has better sites to train
personnel for a desert war, including desert areas near bases in
California, Nevada and Texas.
   It's unclear how much it would cost to restore the island.
   Aluli said the government should find money to ``green'' the
island back to its natural state, whatever the cost.

<HEAD>Companies Can Find You Quickly With Computerized White Pages</HEAD>

   Telephone companies are making it easier for
the government and big business - including the IRS and credit
agencies - to reach out and touch someone, thanks to computerized
phone directories.
   For a hefty fee, large-volume users of white pages directories
may tie their computers into phone company computer banks. Then
they can enter a name, city and state and get an up-to-date
address, ZIP code and phone number.
   If a user has only a name and no city or state, they most likely
will get multiple listings - about 10 names at a time on their
computer screens. The customer pays for each screen of material
that is displayed, plus monthly connection charges, passwords and
long-distance charges, if any.
   The phone companies are prohibited by a federal consent decree
from providing anything more than a person could find in a printed
white pages directory. That means no electronic Yellow Pages; no
special groupings by regions, addresses or phone numbers. That also
means no unpublished or unlisted numbers.
   But Beverly Hollifield, a product manager for BellSouth
Services, said computerized white pages should be useful for
``credit verification, possibly government organizations - the
IRS,'' or companies that make mass mailings and need to verify
addresses.
   The service began in Southwestern Bell Telephone's five-state
territory in June and now is being adopted by other regional Bell
phone companies.
   American Telephon &amp; Telegraph Co. is providing nationwide
access to the regional services, meaning a caller in New York may
electronically find listings in Texas, for example. AT&amp;T expects to
be able to offer its service to 80 percent of the country by spring
1991.
   The advantages of such a service is speed - meaning time and
money saved. And the listings are updated daily, making them as
effective as traditional operator assistance and more reliable than
most white pages directories.
   ``It's targeted at customers that really use quite a bit of
directory assistance - banking, telemarketing, insurance, credit
collections,'' said Ellen Zundl, an AT&amp;T spokeswoman.
   ``If you run the kind of operation that deals with, let's say,
20,000 listing requests a month or more, this really saves you a
lot of time,'' Zundl added.
   She said the AT&amp;T Find America service takes just 3.6 seconds
per listing on average, compared with an average 36 seconds through
a long distance directory assistance operator.
   Southwestern Bell expects its service will generate about $1
million in revenue in 1991, said Dean Jeffries, the company's
product manager. That's small change for a company that had nearly
$9 billion in revenue last year.
   ``It did get off to a slow start,'' Jeffries said of the
DirectLine Custom Service, but the growth has been much as
expected. The service now has ``four solid customers and the demand
is starting to pick up,'' Jeffries said.
   One company, US West Communications, is offering local listings
to residential users of the Community Link videotext service in
Omaha and Council Bluffs, Neb. The service will be expanded to
Minneapolis next year, said Tom Lee, a US West spokesman.
   But the cost probably will make this a business-only service for
the foreseeable future.
   Subscribers to US West's Electronic White Pages Access Service,
which began in the company's 14-state region last month, must pay a
$243 start-up fee; a $163 monthly charge; $8.50 for each
identification number needed to reach the service; and 14.63 cents
for each screen of numbers viewed.
   The user also must pay any long-distance charges accrued while
connecting with US West computers.

   Donald Trump sold off a piece of his
empire, raising $8.8 million to satisfy bankers in an auction of 35
luxury condos built on the wrong side of this prestige-conscious
resort.
   Buyers on Sunday paid from $185,000 to $720,000, or one-half to
two-thirds of previous asking prices, for the waterfront units at
Trump Plaza of the Palm Beaches. The twin 32-story towers are
across the Intracoastal Waterway from exclusive Palm Beach.
   The original prices, which ranged as high as $1.8 million for
the penthouse, were cut under pressure from Marine Midland Bank.
The bank wanted Trump to unload the units that had gone unsold
since the developer took over the building in 1986, boasting that
the complex would be Florida's hottest property.
   Trump, who must meet $34.5 million in payments today on two of
his casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., said he was pleased by the
auction.
   ``We far exceeded our expectations today. This was a tremendous
sale for Trump Plaza,'' said Trump, who congratulated several
buyers as they left the auction ballroom at The Breakers hotel to
sign sales papers.
   Trump was pushed into the auction by Marine Midland, which
loaned him $60 million, after he missed a $27.1 million payment due
Oct. 22. Only one sale had been recorded this year, and about 85 of
the 221 units remained unsold after the auction.
   ``We think that our buyers got a tremendous buy,'' said William
Lange, president of Lange Financial Corp., the auctioneer. ``We
just brought in 35 new neighbors and made a community out of the
Trump Plaza, as opposed to an empty building.''
   The development boasts a spacious leather- and marble-dominated
lobby, concierge, valet parking, swimming pools that catch morning
and afternoon sunlight, a fitness center and tennis court. But the
penthouse has no interior walls, and the other units have concrete
floors and drywall.
   The satisfaction of the auction may be short-lived for Trump.
   Today is the deadline for paying bondholders $18.4 million on
the Trump Castle and $16.1 million on the Trump Plaza Hotel and
Casino in Atlantic City. The Trump Castle has a 10-day grace period
and the Trump Plaza 30 days if the deadlines are missed.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Friday that Trump Plaza has
just $17 million in the bank and Trump Castle has only $18 million
handy.

<HEAD>States Cracking Down on Drug Offenders, Study Shows</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of people convicted in state courts
of drug-related felonies leaped by 69 percent over two years,
according to Justice Department research.
   About one-third of the 667,400 people convicted of felonies in
state courts two years ago - about 227,000 people - were found
guilty of drug trafficking or possession, according to the Bureau
of Justice Statistics report released Sunday.
   In 1986, just under one-fourth of the 582,800 felony convicts,
or about 134,000 people, had been found guilty of drug-related
offenses, according to information provided by bureau statistician
Patrick A. Langan.
   ``It's certainly what one would expect these days,'' said
Langan, who wrote the report with fellow bureau statistician John
M. Dawson.
   The states apparently were cracking down on drug offenders long
before the Bush administration began exhorting them to do so, the
report indicates.
   Felony convictions for drug trafficking increased from 13
percent to 17 percent of the total felony convictions from 1986 to
1988, the report found. At the same time, drug possession felony
convictions rose from 10 percent to 17 percent of the total, Langan
said.
   Drug-related cases represented 23 percent of the felony
convictions in 1986 and 34 percent in 1988. Given the larger number
of total felony convictions two years ago, the increase in
drug-related felony convictions amounted to 69 percent.
   This was occurring as the total number of felony convictions in
state courts was increasing at the much lower rate of 14.5 percent,
the report says.
   Langan said he believed the increase in drug-related felony
convictions was due to an increase in lawbreaking and arrests, not
to new laws targeting a greater range of behavior.
   ``I don't think you're going to find much evidence of that,''
Langan said.
   For example, he said, ``One of the changes that I'm aware of in
the laws regarding drugs is a growing number of states are passing
laws that increase the penalty for trafficking drugs within 100
yards of a school.
   ``People who are convicted will have to pay a heavier penalty,''
Langan said. ``But it's not as though that wasn't a felony before
those laws were passed.''
   The study's most reliable data concerns the 75 most populous
counties, Langan said, as those were studied in depth in 1986 and
1988. The margin of error is 2 percent for those counties in both
years; 3 percent for the 1988 national figures and 12 percent for
the national figures in 1986, the first year the research was done.
The number of counties checked nationwide increased from 100 in
1986 to 300 two years ago.
   For the 75 counties, total felony convictions in state courts
rose 27 percent to 310,547.
   Drug-trafficking felony convictions rose 61 percent in those
counties. Other large increases there were in aggravated assault,
19 percent; larceny, 17 percent; and burglary, 14 percent. Murder
convictions rose 5 percent, robbery convictions remained the same
and rape convictions declined 4 percent. ``Other felonies,'' a
category including drug possession, forgery, fraud, weapon
possession and other offenses, rose 34 percent.
   On a national basis, the report also found that:
   -State courts sentenced 44 percent of their convicted felons to
state prison, 25 percent to jail, 30 percent to probation and 1
percent to alternative sentences.
   -Death sentences were given to 2 percent of those convicted of
murder or non-negligent manslaughter.
   -About 79 percent of the felons had one felony conviction; 15
percent had two and 6 percent had three or more. The likelihood of
receiving a prison sentence increased with the number of felony
convictions. Of those with one felony, 39 percent went to prison;
of those with two, 56 percent; among those with three or more, 66
percent.
   -Among those convicted of felonies, 91 percent pleaded guilty, 5
percent were convicted by a jury and 4 percent were found guilty by
a judge.
   -About 57 percent of the felons convicted in 1988 were white, 41
percent were black and 2 percent were of other races. Of the total,
87 percent were male. The average age was 29 years.

   President Bush meets today with his nominee
for labor secretary, Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., to talk about the
course she will set at the Department of Labor.
   But another meeting that had been tentatively scheduled for
today will not take place. Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz was to
have faced Bush at the White House.
   But that encounter has been put off due to Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's refusal to set an early date to see Secretary of
State James A. Baker III in Baghdad.
   Saddam offered to see Baker on Jan. 12, three days before the
United Nations-imposed deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait or
face military force. Bush has offered to send Baker no later than
Jan. 3.
   Bush returned to the White House Sunday morning from Camp David
for an interview with British television journalist David Frost
that will be aired Jan. 2. The president also hosted a private
Christmas brunch for family members.
   Martin last month lost her bid to unseat Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.
She was in Illinois on Friday when Bush called and offered her the
job.
   Bush said then that he looked forward to today's meeting ``to
talk about her direction of the Department of Labor.''
   Bush still has two other key vacancies to mull over: secretary
of education and the chairmanship of the Republican Party.
   Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos was forced out of his
post last week, and William Bennett withdrew as Bush's choice for
the GOP job. Bennett said it would crimp his income from books and
speaking engagements.
   The Bushes will return to Camp David on Friday and host an
overnight visit by John Major, the new British prime minister, and
his wife.
   The Bushes will spend Christmas at the scenic hideaway in
Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, about 75 miles outside the capital.
   They hosted four big Christmas parties last week for members of
Congress and other guests, and are holding more parties each night
this week through Thursday.

   Two foundations have awarded grants totaling
$2.45 million to help devise better ways of judging students'
knowledge and ability to think clearly.
   One grant, announced Sunday, is a $1.15 million award from the
Pew Charitable Trusts of Philadelphia to the University of
Pittsburgh's Learning Research and Development Center.
   The second, $1.3 million from the John D. and Catherine T.
MacArthur Foundation of Chicago, will go to The National Center on
Education and the Economy in Rochester.
   The two research centers will work together to devise ways of
assessing student performance other than through the usual
multiple-choice exams. The collaboration could extend over a
decade, a joint announcement said.
   These are some of the testing methods the researchers are likely
to look into:
   - examinations in which students demonstrate specific skills to
panels of examiners, much as an Olympic figure skater performs for
a panel of judges.
   - projects in which students show their ability to use
problem-solving skills over time, often with other students.
   - portfolios consisting of the best work done by students in a
variety of areas over time.
   The two research centers said they planned over the next three
months to assemble a group of school districts and states that
would help develop and test the new methods.
   If successful, the methods could replace standardized
multiple-choice tests now common at most U.S. schools.
   Several recent studies claim that the most frequently used
standardized tests give misleadingly positive signals about how
well prepared American youngsters are for the complex problems they
will face as adults.
   Critics say such tests fail to assess a student's ability to
solve problems creatively or to cooperate with others.

<HEAD>One in Four Stores May Cheat on Food Stamps, USDA Report Concludes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new report to Congress says about 25 percent
of the nation's grocery stores authorized to accept food stamps may
be accepting them for forbidden items - such as beer and cigarettes
- and cash.
   The Agriculture Department's Office of Inspector General said
most of the violations apparently involve small and medium-size
establishments among the 220,000 stores nationwide that participate
in the program.
   ``Supermarkets make up about 15 percent of the stores authorized
to accept food stamps but handle about 74 percent of all food
stamps redeemed,'' the report said. ``Our studies have shown that
these large retailers general have adequate controls and systems in
place to prevent program abuse.''
   The report said the department's Food and Nutrition Service,
which administers the program, estimated that 53,000 of the 220,000
stores may be selling non-food items for stamps and that more than
3,200 retailers may be exchanging food stamps for cash.
   The semiannual report, as required by law, covered audit and
investigative activities for the last half of the 1990 fiscal year,
April 1 through Sept. 30.
   A special look at food stamps was included as ``an area of
particular interest to Congress and USDA management.''
   Although the report was not distributed generally, a copy was
provided to The Associated Press upon request.
   The report said about 28 million people received food stamp
benefits at some time during fiscal 1989. On average, 18.8 million
people in more than 7 million households received assistance each
month.
   Overall, more than $11.7 billion worth of food stamps were
issued in fiscal 1989, the report said. Administrative costs added
$1.2 billion to the federal bill.
   By law, food stamps can be used to buy only food in authorized
stores. In practice, the coupons sometimes are illegally sold or
traded.
   ``Of particular concern in recent months has been the use of
food stamps as a second currency to purchase drugs, weapons, stolen
property and other illegal items, the report said. ``As a result of
these transactions, family members who should receive food through
the program do not.''
   In the 1990 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, compliance officers
of the Food and Nutrition Service reviewed 5,447 retailers. Of
those, 1,395 were found to be in violation.
   Food stamps are issued to eligible recipients through state
welfare agencies. The recipients ``spend'' the stamps at stores for
groceries, and the stores deposit the stamps at banks, which credit
the stores with the full face values of the coupons.
   The banks send the redeemed stamps to a Federal Reserve bank,
which credits the account of the local food store's bank. The
federal bank then bills the U.S. Treasury for the face value of the
stamps and then destroys them.
   Errors in food stamp certification often result with some
households getting more or less than they are supposed to. Outright
``recipient fraud'' sometimes exists on the part of householders.
   States are responsible for certification and issuance of stamps,
and therefore state agencies conduct the majority of investigations
of recipient fraud, the report said. In return, USDA reimburses the
states for 75 percent of their investigative expenses.
   The report said that in fiscal 1989, the states conducted more
than 360,000 recipient fraud investigations which produced nearly
16,000 criminal convictions and 24,000 recipient disqualifications.
   Food stamp buying and selling - trafficking - have attracted
news media attention in recent months, especially when stamps are
traded for drugs.
   Often this involves non-authorized retailers, the report said.
Therefore, it's difficult to estimate the volume of dealings,
except that investigators say it's widespread.
   ``For example, local welfare officials in a large metropolitan
area estimated that at certain issuance points where trafficking
was believed to be most widespread, about 50 percent of recipients
were approached by individuals who offered to buy their food stamps
for cash,'' the report said.
   ``It was further estimated that about 50 percent of those
approached appeared to sell at least some of their food stamps.''
   The report added that ``it is not uncommon for food stamp
trafficking to be part of larger criminal enterprises, such as
theft and fencing rings, or drug trafficking operations.''
   Department investigators said they ``strongly support'' a number
of initiatives under consideration that would reduce food stamp
abuse. One system being tested is electronic benefits transfer, or
EBT, which would be an alternative to the use of paper food stamps.
   States also are being urged to upgrade specific criminal
statutes so food stamp traffickers can be prosecuted more
effectively, the report said.
   Also, it said, the establishment of a ``strike team of
investigators'' has been proposed in 1992 to detect and investigate
food stamp fraud at the retailer level.

   The dollar closed higher Monday, reflecting the
stalemate over talks between the United States and Iraq, while
share prices fell on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 133.10, up 1.23 yen from last Friday's
close of 131.87 yen. The dollar opened at 133.27 and ranged between
132.90 yen and 133.35 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, fell 261.59
points, or 1.07 percent, to close at 24,087.91.
   In bond dealings, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds was 87.91, up from Friday's close of
87.64. Their yield was 7.080 percent, compared with 7.140 percent
last Friday.
   Currency dealers said the dollar was strong because disagreement
between the United States and Iraq over the date of talks increased
the likelihood of war.
   ``The dollar will trade in a narrow range in the low-133 yen
level,'' said a dealer with Daiichi Kangyo Bank, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Dealers also said the U.S. currency is expected to fluctuate on
speculation that the U.S. discount rate may be lowered.
   The key U.S. interest rate stands at 7.0 percent, and a 0.5
percentage point cut is expected shortly, dealers said.
   ``The rate cut may come right after the meeting of the U.S.
Federal Open Market Committee,'' scheduled Monday and Tuesday in
New York, said a dealer with Daiichi Kangyo Bank, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``But the rate cut is already discounted
more or less in the market.''
   On the stock market, securities dealers said pessimism about the
prospect for a peaceful solution to the Gulf crisis prompted
investors to sell a large volume of shares at the opening of the
day's trading.
   Large-capital shares, such as steel, electric and shipbuilding
shares, lost ground in thin trading, dealers said.

<HEAD>Dairy Industry: Where Mom Failed, Madonna Might Succeed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mom couldn't get you to drink your milk, but
Madonna might.
   At least that's what a big-time New Jersey dairyman and an
outgoing Minnesota senator hope.
   They're trying to persuade the dairy industry to levy a tax on
itself to finance a multimillion-dollar advertising war with the
soft drink industry.
   Skeptics, such as Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, believe
Americans already drink as much milk as they're going to.
   But Marc Goldman, who runs an independent dairy in the New York
City area, and Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., say milk's problem
isn't that Americans don't want to drink it, but that they haven't
been sold on it.
   ``If your mother tells you to drink milk and Madonna tells you
to drink soda, Madonna wins most of those arguments,'' Goldman
said. ``We've got to get Madonna and others like her on our side.''
   At Boschwitz' initiative, the 1990 farm bill passed by Congress
authorizes the government to collect a tax of 20 cents per 100
pounds of milk, if a majority of the nation's milk processors
approve of it in a referendum. No vote has yet been scheduled.
   The assessment would work out to about 1{ cents a gallon.
Processors could take it out of their profits or pass it on to
consumers.
   Soft drink manufacturers spend $500 million a year hawking their
product, while dairy farmers invest a relatively meager $60
million, Goldman said. So it's no wonder to him that U.S. milk
consumption has fallen markedly over the last two decades.
   In 1965, Americans drank 24 gallons of milk and 18 gallons of
soft drinks each. Today, the average consumer drinks 46 gallons of
soda and just 21 gallons of milk.
   ``Milk has been relegated to the dowdy and to babies too young
to understand marketing tactics,'' Goldman said in a column for
Dairy Foods, an industry publication.
   Goldman is president of Farmland Dairies, an independent milk
handler in Wallington, N.J., that buys from 800 producers and
claims 15 percent of the New York-area market.
   Boschwitz, a longtime friend, won passage of the promotion plan
before losing re-election in November. He sees the program as an
``enormous boon'' to the dairy farmers in Minnesota and around the
country.
   U.S. milk consumption, which has been relatively flat, could
rise 4 percent to 6 percent a year, the senator claims.
   Goldman believes there is a future in products like skim milk he
sells that is fortified to taste like the fat hasn't been removed
and flavored drinks like the strawberry and root beer milk that
Boschwitz has sold each year at his Minnesota State Fair booth.
   There is some evidence to support their optimism.
   The hottest growth in the beverage industry has been in bottled
water, carbonated juices and other drinks considered more healthful
than soda, said Hellen Berry, an analyst with the consulting firm
Beverage Marketing.
   Milk has never been creatively marketed, she said. ``Whenever
anybody makes noise about a beverage product it does have an effect
on sales,'' she said.
   Yeutter, whose department would set up the advertising fund,
believes that U.S. milk consumption has peaked, despite recent
marketing success stories with yogurt and high-priced ice cream.
New markets will have to be found overseas, he said.

<TEXT>
   South Carolina legislators, their
reputations tainted by a bribery scandal, soon will have the chance
to show whether they want to put words about reform into action.
   When the Legislature returns in January, it faces the challenge
of restoring public confidence in the wake of an FBI sting that led
to the indictment of 10 lawmakers and one lobbyist.
   ``I figured politics was pretty corrupt around here. We found
out how,'' said William Carter Jr., an inventory manager at a
hardware company in Sumter.
   The sting, Operation Lost Trust, was set up to look for bribery
and other corruption at the Statehouse. It succeeded.
   Nine legislators were charged with selling their votes for cash.
Another legislator and a lobbyist were charged with drug
possession.
   Seven have pleaded guilty, and one legislator was convicted at
trial. The three others await trial in January. Earlier this month,
a former senator was sentenced to six months in a halfway house and
an ex-representative got a 6{-year prison term.
   The indictments shined a bright light on South Carolina's lax
regulation of campaign finance, lobbying and ethics.
   The state allows any person or group to give an unlimited amount
of money to political campaigns. Candidates do not have to report
donations until after the election. Lobbyists can give gifts to
legislators.
   After the scandal broke in July, lawmakers began scrambling to
reform the system. Legislators and other interest groups have
proposed more than 100 reform measures.
   ``Much as the cross gave Christianity a focal point and purpose,
so should the tragedies of the past 120 days give each of us the
zeal and much needed attention to (reform),'' Senate President Pro
Tem Marshall Williams said in a letter to colleagues last month.
   Williams has written a 105-page bill that would radically reform
campaign finance, ethics and lobbying laws.
   Sen. Ed Saleeby, a co-sponsor of the bill, said it could run
into trouble for being too restrictive. He said, for instance, that
it would hurt the system if legislators were not permitted to take
trips to inspect industrial sites at a business's expense.
   House Speaker Bob Sheheen pushed the House earlier this month
into adopting a wide-ranging ethics package as part of its own
internal rules.
   The House limited the amount of money lobbyists can donate to
campaigns and also banned legislators, with some exceptions, from
accepting meals or entertainment from lobbyists. The rules apply
only to House members.
   Some lawmakers argue they cannot create a perfectly clean
system. Bribery already was illegal, they note, so anyone open to
accepting bribes still will find ways to do so.
   ``What we can do is throw up roadblocks to make bribery less
tempting,'' said Sen. John Courson.
   Many of the proposed reforms attack problems linked not directly
to the bribery scandal but to the impression of an ethically weak
Legislature.
   ``What the sting did was force the disclosure of other unseemly
aspects of the Legislature,'' said John Crangle, head of the
state's Common Cause chapter. ``It galvanized a number of media
people into looking at what's going on up there.''
   Crangle cited stories about lobbyists picking up bar tabs,
golfing fees and the cost of trips as well as late-night poker
games at a Columbia hotel.
   Legislators who had never embraced reform now know they must
change the way the Legislature does business, Crangle said.
   ``I don't think they realized how bad the system had gotten,''
he said.

   Lew Schneider says his car was broken into
shortly after he moved here from Chicago. ``I told the police,
`I've been here 28 days. What the hell's going on?'
   ``And the way they explained it to me was: `Look, they got a lot
of cars to break into, and they get to them as fast as they can.'
''
   Schneider may sound like just another comedian mining New York's
misery for cheap laughs, but he's supposed to be boosting local
morale.
   That, at least, was the stated purpose for ``Comedians for New
York'' a Monday night fixture at a comedy club called Stand Up New
York.
   Two months ago the club was looking for a Monday theme to
replace ``What's So Funny About the Persian Gulf?'' because
comedians were having trouble coming up with new material. And
since Time magazine had just bashed the city in a cover story, ``we
decided to make an attempt to counteract the city's negative
image,'' said publicity director Jennifer Walker.
   In reality, however, Schneider and his colleagues answer the
weekly call to stand up for the city with jokes about surly
cabbies, outrageous prices and wooden fire escapes.
   Not that they don't love New York. Taylor Mason, a New Jersey
resident, says he comes in to try out his car alarm. And Billiam
Coronel enjoys watching the garbage change color with the seasons.
   Coronel also was pleasantly surprised by the Bronx Zoo: ``It's
very nice, because whenever you think of a zoo in New York, you
assume ... dead animals - bullet holes in the cheetah, maybe a
rhino jacked up on cinder blocks and homeless people living inside
the kangaroos.''
   But no one has a good word for the taxi drivers. How can a
passenger sit back and relax, asks Adrianne Tolsch, when the ``Sit
Back and Relax'' sign has bullet holes in it? When the driver's
hack license photo is a police sketch?
   Scott Blakeman, on the other hand, says he doesn't like to
complain about cabbies: ``Many of them have fled persecution in
other countries. And maybe the quickest way to 81st Street IS
through Canada.''
   Anyway, most comics can afford only the subway. ``They call my
train the No. 1, but it smells like number two,'' says Sam
Greenfield.
   He notes that in Boston, people formed a human chain to rescue
someone who had fallen onto the tracks next to an electrified third
rail; in New York, ``Someone would say, `Spit on her, let's get a
spark going.'''
   Jim David was riding the subway when he noticed a poster ad that
said, ``Pregnant? We can help.'' Next to it someone had written in,
``Not pregnant yet? I can help.''
   Crime is funny. Jon Solomon suspects that when aliens from outer
space finally land here, New Yorkers will snap the antennas off
their heads.
   Ms. Tolsch learned to use her apartment keys as a weapon by
sticking them between the fingers of her fist. So she tried this
against a mugger. ``My luck, the keys fit right into this guy's
face.''
   Mike Sweeney is skeptical about Mayor David Dinkins' plan to
hire thousands of additional police officers but says it suggests a
stock tip: Buy Dunkin' Donuts.
   Coronel, the man whose apartment has a wooden fire escape, notes
that New York has a doorman's union. ``Why?'' he asks. ``They can't
go on strike. What are they going to do, stand in front of your
building?''
   As a special service, Stand Up New York has posted this offer at
its Monday night shows: ``We will allow any audience member who
wishes to give a funny anecdote about the good things in New York
to go on stage.''
   So far, said Ms. Walker, there have been no takers.

<HEAD>Study Warns Against 1993 SDI Deployment Without Testing Data</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first phase of the Strategic Defense
Initiative could be the next version of the ill-fated Hubble
telescope mission, a congressional panel is warning.
   The House Government Operations Committee, citing Pentagon
documents, testimony at hearings and a General Accounting Office
report released in July, on Sunday raised serious questions about
deploying the system, commonly known as Star Wars in 1993.
   In January, the Pentagon incorporated the ``Brilliant Pebbles''
concept into Phase 1 of the SDI system. That technology involves
several thousand interceptors that would orbit the Earth to seek
and destroy a target by smashing into it at high speeds.
   Phase 1 also involves seven highly integrated elements,
including two space-based sensors, a space-based weapon, two
ground-based sensors, a ground-based weapon and a command and
control system.
   The GAO also said that detailed tests planned by the SDIO or the
Strategic Defense Initiative Organization won't be completed before
the scheduled executive decision on deployment in 1993.
   SDIO is a Defense Department agency that oversees the Star Wars
program.
   Based on the problems of incomplete testing, the GAO said it
doesn't believe the SDI organization ``will be able to give the
president enough information to support a 1993 decision to deploy
Phase 1.''
   ``The fallacy of sacrificing adequate testing for early
deployment is highlighted by the Hubble Space Telescope,''
Democrats and Republicans on the committee said in the 39-page
report.
   ``This is but a small example of the problems that could beset a
far more complex (SDI) system composed of thousands of space-based
components,'' the report said.
   Shortly after the $1.5 billion Hubble telescope was launched
from the Space Shuttle Discovery last April, officials discovered a
problem with the primary mirror which was providing a blurred view
of the universe.
   Nine of 15 Republicans on the committee dissented from the
report, saying it was unclear why the panel prepared the report.
The GOP members also contend that a possible delay in deploying the
SDI system is not due to problems with the program but rather
congressional cuts in the SDI budget.
   President Bush recently signed a defense budget for the fiscal
year that began Oct. 1 that provided $2.9 billion for SDI, nearly
$2 billion less than Bush requested from Congress and $900 million
less than Congress provided last year.
   ``What is most troubling ... is what appears to be an underlying
assumption that the likely inability of SDIO to support a 1993
deployment decision is the result of the way SDIO is conducting the
program,'' said the GOP lawmakers. ``This is unfortunate, and
untrue.''
   Maj. Mike Doble, a spokesman for SDIO, said Friday the agency
had not seen the report and would have no immediate comment.
   The report is based largely on a GAO study that said deploying
the first phase of Star Wars would be ``premature and fraught with
high risk'' because of problems with design and testing.
   The investigative arm of Congress said the introduction of the
``Brilliant Pebbles'' concept had drastically changed the system's
design, leaving it in a state of flux.
   The committee report also questions the cost estimates of the
SDI program. The Pentagon plans to spend between $69 billion and
$87 billion to develop and deploy the first phase of the Strategic
Defense System, designed to protect the United States from a Soviet
nuclear ballistic missile attack.
   To date, $2 billion has been spent on the Phase 1 aspect of the
system. The committee contends that the cost could easily increase.
   ``SDIO's $69 billion estimate for Phase 1 represents only a
`snapshot at a point in time' as the system is still changing.
However, Department of Defense experience has shown that such early
estimates usually increase significantly for a variety of
reasons,'' the committee said.
   The Pentagon also believes that the ``Brilliant Pebbles''
concept will be cost effective. However, the committee notes a
March 1990 report by the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory concluding
that it is ``highly unlikely that Brilliant Pebbles will be cost
effective.''
   ``According to the report, each Pebble would cost about $2
million to produce and deploy - this is almost double earlier
estimates,'' the committee said, citing the laboratory report.
   Eleven of 23 Democrats on the panel said in an addition to the
report that the country ``could ill-afford the folly of Reagan's
Star Wars dream a decade ago. Twenty billion dollars later, we can
barely afford even the more prudent course of continuing with its
basic research.''

<HEAD>Scientists Use Sound Waves to Improve Processing of Soy Oil</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There may be a whole lotta shakin' going on
if sound waves become the industry standard for processing soybean
oil.
   Researchers at the National Center for Agricultural Utilization
Research devised the use of ultrasound to remove gummy impurities
from the nation's No. 1 vegetable oil.
   The technique is faster and more effective than the conventional
method of mixing water with crude soy oil so that the sticky gums
can be removed in a centrifuge, said food chemist Timothy Mounts.
   ``This would be an avenue to look at - maybe better than the
mechanical means,'' said David Erickson, director of technical
services for the American Soybean Association.
   When soybeans are crushed to make oil for cooking and salad
dressing, processors must remove gummy impurities - fatty acids and
phospholipids - that can increase refining losses and create
flavors that are slightly off.
   Mounts, who developed the system with colleague Karl Moulton,
said it has been done only at the government laboratory.
   ``We have demonstrated the feasibility of the technology, but we
don't know about the commercial costs,'' said Mounts. ``It should
be equivalent to the current process, maybe cheaper on a per-unit
basis because you move the product through the system more
rapidly.''
   The process uses high-frequency sound waves to vibrate the oil
and water mixture at 20,000 times per second, creating tiny bubbles
and causing the gums to cluster.
   The gums, which bond with hydrogen from the water, then are spun
away from the oil in a centrifuge.
   Taste panelists could not tell the difference between soy oil
refined the conventional way and oil processed with the ultrasound
system.
   Mounts said the technology is available to the soybean
processing industry at no cost.
   ``There's no patent,'' he said. ``They can do with it what they
will.''

   ``Feel-ings.'' (Cringe!) ``Nothing more than ...
feel-ings.'' (Ahhhhhh!) ``Trying to forget myyyyy ... feel-ings of
love.''
   (Get that guy off the stage!)
   This is karaoke, the Japanese answer to ``sing along with
Mitch,'' the craze that has people coming out of the shower and
onto the stage to belt out songs before an audience.
   Karaoke - Japanese for empty orchestra - is no Milli Vanilli lip
synch deal. While music plays in the background, people grab the
mike and go to town. The lyrics pop up on TV monitors for the
singers to follow.
   ``It feels good to get up there and let loose,'' said Eddie
Pineda, a computer operator who got down on one knee, bowed his
head and belted out Elvis Presley's ``Jailhouse Rock'' at the
Singalongs club.
   ``Everybody wants to have their chance in the limelight
sometime,'' said Pineda.
   The crowd, loving every minute of it, sang along and danced
until the next person took the stage.
   ``This is the hottest new form of entertainment to hit this
country in many years,'' said Bill Fowls, sales and marketing
director at DKKaraoke Inc. of Los Angeles, a subsidiary of a
Japanese compact disc manufacturer.
   More than 10,000 American taverns, clubs and discos have
karaoke, which came to the United States in 1983, said Mark Makabe,
senior vice president of sales and marketing at Pioneer Laser
Entertainment Inc.
   Pioneer, along with Nikkoda Inc., DKKaraoke Inc., Sony, JVC and
Panasonic, all produce karaoke equipment or software.
   ``It's kind of a Japanese culture, but the karaoke was really
born in the U.S. It follows the concept of the bouncing ball. We've
just developed the product to sell it,'' Makabe said.
   An estimated 400,000 establishments and 7 million homes in Japan
have karaoke, Makabe said. Karaoke's popularity there is
attributable to businessmen's use of singing as an outlet for
stress.
   ``The shyest person says they won't get up. ... Once they've
tried it, you can't get the mike out of their hand. It's very
infectious,'' Fowls said.
   Nell Carpenter, a marketing director transformed into
country-western singer Patsy Cline, left the Singalongs stage
breathless and thirsty.
   ``It felt like you were really singing - even though you knew
you were blowing it,'' she said.
   The original karaoke, created in Japan about 20 years ago, was
simply an electronic box that zapped the lyrics from audio
cassettes and left the music.
   Now karaoke systems, such as DKKaraoke's, include a remote
control unit that lets a DJ select one of 700 songs at the press of
a button; a graphic decoder to match video themes with songs; an
amplifier, and a compact disc loader. A home version will be on the
market this spring, Fowls said.
   The average home karaoke system costs between $700 and $1,600.
Commercial systems can start at about $10,000.
   ``When people get up there, the business people, blue-collar
people, they leave their ties on their heads, they wriggle their
skirts and leave the office behind,'' said Singalongs entertainment
director Donnie Kehr.
   Kehr said some of the most requested songs include Meat Loaf's
``Paradise by the Dashboard Light''; ``New York, New York'' by
Frank Sinatra, and - yeah, you guessed it - ``Feelings.''

   Here are some facts and figures on Haiti's general election
Sunday:
   ---
   WHO'S ELIGIBLE - About 2.9 million Haitians were registered to
vote, more than 92 percent of those eligible. Haitians must be at
least 18 to vote.
   ---
   AT STAKE - Haitians were electing a president, a 110-member
bicameral National Assembly, 134 mayors, 268 municipal council
members and 1,695 county officials across the Caribbean nation of 6
million. The president has a five-year term, National Assembly
senators six years and deputies four.
   The constitution, approved in a referendum in 1987, placed the
elections in the hands of an independent Electoral Council.
   This was the first free presidential election since independence
from France, 186 years ago. The last attempt, on Nov. 29, 1987, was
aborted when army-supported thugs shot and hacked to death at least
34 voters on election day. Elections in January 1988 were
controlled by the army.
   The country has been under dictatorial rule virtually since
independence from France in 1804. Since the fall of the 29-year
Duvalier family dictatorship in February 1986, there have been five
different governments, four of them run or controlled by the army.
   The new government will replace the caretaker administration of
President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, a Supreme Court justice appointed
in March.
   ---
   ELECTION RESULTS - Ballots were being counted at about 14,500
polling places and the results reported to election headquarters in
the capital of Port-au-Prince by telephone and facsimile. The final
count was not expected to be completed before today.
   If no presidential candidate wins a majority of the votes, a
runoff will be held on Jan. 20. The president is to be inaugurated
Feb. 7.
   More than 800 international observers monitored the election.
   ---
   WHO RAN - There were 11 presidential candidates. The leading
candidates were the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a 37-year-old
Roman Catholic priest and longtime critic of Haiti's totalitarian
governments; Marc Bazin, 58, a former World Bank official; Sylvio
Claude, 36, an evangelical preacher and Duvalier critic; agronomist
Louis Dejoie Jr., 62; industrialist Thomas Desulme, 77; and
sociologist Hubert de Ronceray, 58.

   Here are some significant dates in Haiti's modern history:
   Oct. 22, 1957 - Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier becomes president
in disputed election.
   April 1, 1964 - Duvalier proclaims himself president for life.
   April 21, 1971 - Duvalier dies and 19-year-old Jean-Claude
``Baby Doc'' Duvalier becomes president.
   Feb. 7, 1986 - Duvalier flees to exile in France after a month
of popular uprisings that leave more than 50 people dead. A
three-man junta led by Duvalier's army chief of staff, Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy, takes power.
   Oct. 19, 1986 - Low participation in first national election in
30 years for a 41-member Constituent Assembly to write a new
constitution.
   March 29, 1987 - Voters overwhelmingly approve a new
constitution putting elections for president and National Assembly
in the hands of a civilian, independent Electoral Council.
   Nov. 29, 1987 - Election Day. Assassins protected by the army
kill at least 34 voters and the voting is called off. Namphy and
junta dissolve Electoral Council. The United States suspends $70
million in aid in protest.
   Jan. 17, 1988 - Leslie Manigat, a university professor, is
elected president in army-controlled elections. Few Haitians vote
and most opposition leaders refuse to participate.
   June 19, 1988 - Troops storm the National Palace, deposing
Manigat and replacing him with Namphy.
   Sept. 17, 1988 - Namphy is ousted in a coup led by
noncommissioned officers and exiled in the neighboring Dominican
Republic. Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, chief of the Presidential Guard
and a former Duvalier adviser, becomes president a day later.
   April 1988 - Presidential Guard rescues Avril from coup attempt
by rebel officers and puts down subsequent mutiny by two army
units.
   Jan. 20 - Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril declares a 30-day state of
siege after the mysterious killing of an army colonel. Fifty
opposition leaders are arrested, jailed and reportedly beaten and
tortured. Seven political leaders are exiled.
   March 10 - Avril steps down as Haiti's leader after weeklong
anti-government demonstrations. He later flees to U.S. exile.
   March 13 - Supreme Court Justice Ertha Pascal-Trouillot takes
office as president of provisional civilian government to govern
jointly with 19-member Council of State and lead nation to
democratic elections.
   Dec. 5 - Seven people are killed in a grenade and bomb attack at
a campaign rally for the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the apparent
front-runner.
   Dec. 16 - Haiti holds what appear to be its first free elections
ever, and Aristide supporters take to the streets to celebrate
anticipated victory.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Tokyo Market Declines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose sharply against the yen today,
reflecting the stalemate over talks between the United States and
Iraq, while share prices fell on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 133.10 yen, up 1.23 yen from last Friday's
close of 131.87 yen. It opened at 133.27 yen and ranged between
132.90 yen and 133.35 yen. The dollar has gained 1.80 yen in the
last two trading days.
   Spot trading totaled $5.9 billion, compared with $4.9 billion
Friday.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues fell 261.59
points, or 1.07 percent, closing at 24,087.91 in slow trading.
   Volume on the first section was 270 million shares, well below
last Friday's 800 million.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's rise in Tokyo followed its
gains in foreign markets because the United States and Iraq
disagreed over the date for talks on the gulf crisis.
   The dollar often is seen as a safe haven in times of tension.
The yen also suffers from fears of Middle East war because Japan
imports almost all of its oil, 70 percent of it from the Middle
East.
   Dealers also said demand for dollars has increased for trade
settlements and overseas trips by Japanese during their year-end
holidays.
   On the stock market, an official of Nomura Securities Co., who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said investors refrained from
buying while watching efforts for a peaceful solution of the gulf
crisis.
   In bond dealings, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds was at 87.82 at 5 p.m. (3 a.m. EST), up
from Friday's close of 87.64. Their yield was 7.100 percent,
compared with 7.140 percent Friday.

<HEAD>San Francisco Considers Landmark Law Affecting Computer Terminal
Workers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Meeting begins 5 p.m. EST.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed city measure to regulate the use
of computer screens could cost employers up to $76 million over two
years and, according to some critics, drive a lot of business out
of San Francisco.
   The video display terminal, or VDT, ordinance was scheduled to
go before the Board of Supervisors today for a final vote, with
approval expected.
   The ordinance would mandate adjustable chairs, special lighting
and rest breaks. The law, which would affect city government and
businesses with 15 or more employees, also would require glare
shields, detachable keyboards and tables with sufficient leg space.
   ``Obviously, this will have a wider impact than just in San
Francisco. I am sure that many municipalities will be looking at it
and will probably think about similar types of legislation,'' said
Bruce Dickerson, executive director of a national industry
organization, the Center for Office Technology.
   Mayor Art Agnos has not committed himself to signing the
proposal. If he refuses to sign it, the supervisors, who favored it
in an 8-1 vote last week, could override his veto with eight votes
from the 11-member board.
   Agnos and his staff have spent the last week meeting with
supervisors and labor and business leaders in an effort to work out
a compromise.
   City budget analysts estimate San Francisco would have to spend
$1.4 million to $6 million during the next two years to comply with
the bill in its present form, while business would have to spend
$31.5 million to $76.5 million.
   The Chamber of Commerce and other business officials have warned
that the proposal drive companies out of the city.
   ``Legislating seems counterproductive,'' said Bill Allen, AT&amp;T
district manager for government relations. ``Our feeling is that we
can best address the issue on a voluntary basis.''
   Supporters believe the cost estimates are too high. They also
say analysts have overlooked how much money would be saved by
reducing VDT-related injuries, which can cost thousands of dollars
to treat, and boosting productivity.
   ``If someone thinks it's cheaper to move out of the city than to
provide an adjustable chair or decent lighting, that's pretty
shortsighted,'' said Barbara Kellogg of the VDT Coalition, a group
that helped draft the bill.
   Companies would have two years to implement the law. After that,
violators could be fined up to $500 per day.
   Business owners successfully challenged the only similar
ordinance passed in the country, in Suffolk County on New York's
Long Island. They argued that only the state could impose such
rules.
   Among the problems associated with constant work at a computer
keyboard are nerve damage to the wrists and fingers, back and neck
strain, eyestrain, sleep disturbances, chronic headaches, nausea
and fatigue.

   A strong earthquake early today injured
21 people in southern Iran, damaged houses and sent some panicked
residents rushing into the streets, Iran's official news agency
reported.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said the quake struck at 1:50
a.m. and registered 6.5 on the Richter scale. The Geophysics
Institute of Tehran University said it was centered about 500 miles
south of Tehran.
   The agency said 20 people were injured in Dashtestan, about 40
miles from the Persian Gulf city of Bushehr, where panicked
residents poured into the streets.
   IRNA said one person was injured in the village of Aabad near
Dashtestan and five houses were damaged in the village of Kalameh.
IRNA said the road to Kalameh was blocked by a landslide.
   A devastating June 21 earthquake centered near Rudbar, about 120
miles northwest of Tehran, killed 40,000 people, injured 60,000 and
left half a million homeless. That temblor measured 7.3 on the
Richter scale.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   A quake registering 6 on the scale is capable of causing severe
damage. A 7-magnitude quake can cause widespread, heavy damage.

<TEXT>
   The World Health Organization boycotted
an international conference on AIDS that opened in Bangkok today
because Thailand has refused to allow people with the disease into
the country to take part.
   The five-day meeting is focusing on the impact of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome in developing countries.
   It is sponsored by the Chulabhorn Research Institute, whose
president is Princess Chulabhorn, daughter of Thailand's
constitutional monarch.
   The princess resigned as a WHO friendship ambassador last week
after the U.N. body said it would not attend the conference.
   WHO had asked the princess to lobby the government to lift its
ban on allowing AIDS carriers into the country but she was unable
to do so.
   Some Thai officials and scientists have criticized the
government ban.
   The Chulabhorn institute said it had applied to the Interior
Ministry to waive Thai law and allow foreigners with AIDS to attend
the conference but the request was rejected.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Neighborhood volunteers trying to discourage
prostitution are posing as hookers and handing ``johns'' literature
about AIDS.
   Wearing heavy makeup, furs and other streetwalker garb,
residents of the Uptown neighborhood, one of Chicago's seediest,
have been flagging down men in the middle of the night to spread
the word about the risk of disease.
   Uptown has the city's second-highest number of people with AIDS,
with some 500 confirmed cases, according to the city Health
Department.
   ``We're not proud of the AIDS designation,'' said Alderman Helen
Shiller. ``But we're going to use it to chase the (prostitution)
business out of here.''
   About 25 volunteers are taking part in the effort, though not
all are dressed as prostitutes.
   Police doubt the month-old program will have any effect and said
it may be dangerous for the women.
   ``Once a john is in a car with a girl, I don't think he's going
to be inclined to read any literature,'' said Sgt. Robert
Sarnowski.
   ``And if anybody is dressing up as a prostitute, I'll be the
first to say that they're nuts. That's our job, undercover work.''
   Dr. David Ostrow, director of the Midwest AIDS Behavioral
Research Center, called the program ``a novel use of what we call
`on-site marketing' - giving AIDS information right to the consumer
right when they can use it.''

   Twenty-five people were rescued
after the ice they were fishing on broke free and drifted more than
half a mile into a lake, authorities say.
   No one was injured Sunday, but 10 ice houses and three
all-terrain vehicles were left on the 5-inch-thick ice. Authorities
said they would be recovered after the ice freezes back together,
probably in about two weeks.
   ``One person told me they looked down at their fishing hole and
noticed rocks going by and couldn't understand why the water was
moving so rapidly,'' said sheriff's Deputy Herb Willis.
   John Odle, owner of a resort on Lake Mille Lacs, said he barely
managed to reach the shore before the ice broke free. Nineteen
people were left on the floe, which was about a half-mile long and
a quarter-mile wide, he said.
   ``Some were frantic and started to panic, waving shirts to get
attention,'' Odle said. ``Things got really crazy at this point.''
   Odle and Billy Cawelti, who operates a nearby resort, rescued
the 19 by boat, he said. The men, along with rescue workers, also
brought four adults and two children to shore from another floe a
half-mile away.
   ``They were all very wet, and one of the little boys was only
wearing tennis shoes,'' Odle said.
   Willis said Lake Mille Lacs usually does not break up this late
in the year, but warm weather and strong winds had opened a large
hole in the middle of the lake, allowing room for other chunks to
break free and drift.
   Temperatures in the area this month have been in the 30s and
40s. The lake is about 60 miles north of Minneapolis, where it was
31 degrees at midnight.

<HEAD>Doctor Doubts Story of How Baltimore Surgeon Contracted AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A surgeon disputed a colleague's claim to have
contracted AIDS from being squirted in the face with blood during
an operation they performed.
   Dr. William Knapper, senior surgeon during the 1983 operation in
which Dr. Rudolph Almaraz said he was exposed to AIDS, denied any
such accident took place but acknowledged not remembering specifics
of the surgery or Almaraz himself.
   Almaraz, a breast cancer surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital, died
of AIDS on Nov. 16 at age 41, never having told the hospital or his
patients of his disease.
   Almaraz's lawyer, Marvin Ellin, said the doctor told him a month
before his death that he believed he was infected during an
operation at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New
York.
   Although Almaraz couldn't recall the date, Ellin said his review
of Almaraz's operating records shows it must have been a 1983
biopsy of a lymph node in the groin of an AIDS patient.
   ``Almaraz told me that while surgery was proceeding ... blood
squirted in his face, hitting him in the eyes and mouth,'' Ellin
said.
   But Knapper, who works at Sloan-Kettering, said: ``I can assure
you that at no point in my career, in any surgical procedure that I
performed on an AIDS patient, was there ever any accident that
could have put me or my colleagues at risk for contracting AIDS.''
   ``At no point in my career was there ever an arterial spurt
while I was doing a biopsy of a subcutaneous (under the skin) lymph
node,'' he said.
   Sloan-Kettering officials has said no records exist of such an
accident.
   Since Almaraz's death, Johns Hopkins Hospital has offered AIDS
tests to 1,800 of his patients. Two of them have sued, saying they
should have been told about his disease before being operated on.

<HEAD>ANC Conference Highlights Divergent Positions on Government
Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A weekend conference of the
African National Congress highlighted divisions between moderates
eager to hold talks with the government and hard-liners who want
first to force more concessions.
   The nation's largest black opposition group ended its first
public conference in 30 years with a 40,000-strong rally Sunday.
   The overall consensus during the three-day meeting was to
maintain ANC support for international trade sanctions and to urge
protests and other pressure to ensure that President F.W. de Klerk
indeed dismantles apartheid.
   The European Community on Saturday lifted its ban on new
investment in South Africa, the first major crack in the wall of
sanctions the ANC has worked hard to build.
   ``While opposition to apartheid remains, European governments
have decided that the best way to end it is by supporting de
Klerk's initiatives rather than the ANC's hard line,'' said
Business Day, the country's leading financial daily.
   De Klerk wants to open negotiations early next year with the ANC
and other opposition groups on a new constitution that will allow
the 5 million whites and 30 million blacks to share power.
   ``The overwhelming majority of our people, and the delegates
here, support negotiations between the ANC and the government,''
said ANC deputy president Nelson Mandela, considered a moderate.
   But Joe Slovo, who also heads the South African Communist Party
and is considered a hard-liner in the ANC, said: ``It seems to be
the clear view of the conference that in order to get negotiaions
proper going, much, much more has to get done'' by the white-led
government.
   The rally in Soweto, the huge township outside Johannesburg,
marked the official homecoming of ANC President Oliver Tambo, who
returned last week from 30 years in exile to attend the conference.
   Tambo said in a speech Saturday that the ANC should reconsider
its advocacy of sanctions. The government claims that sanctions
hurt blacks and white alike by hurting South Africa's economy, but
ANC leaders have seen them as a means of pressuring the government
to end apartheid.
   The ANC said it would continue periodic talks with the
government on dismantling apartheid that began in May.
   But unless all barriers to full-scale constitutional
negotiations are removed by April 30, the ANC said it would
consider withdrawing.
   ``We shall not hesitate to recommend ... to suspend talks,''
said Chris Hani, head of the ANC's military wing and one of the
group's most militant leaders.
   The ANC says that before formal constitutional negotiations can
begin, the government must release political prisoners, allow some
20,000 exiles to return home, end ``political'' trials and scrap
security legislation.
   De Klerk has agreed to the first three demands and has pledged
to review security laws that have been used to restrict political
activity.
   However, implementation has been delayed by bickering between
the ANC and the government over details. Hundreds of political
prisoners remain in jail, few exiles have returned and some trials
involving ANC activists accused of violence are still before the
courts.

   Storms off Canada's coast have forced British
tycoon Richard Branson and Swedish balloonist Per Lindstrand to
postpone until the new year their attempt at the first Pacific
crossing by hot-air balloon.
   Lindstrand and Branson had hoped to lift off later this week
from Miyakonojo, a small town on the southern Japanese island of
Kyushu.
   But they said today that storms over the Pacific had slowed the
jet stream and pushed it too far south for a safe crossing.
   ``To try to cross the world's largest ocean at this time would
pose too high a risk, not only for ourselves but for others,
especially the rescue services, who would be stretched over the
Christmas and New Year period,'' said Branson, founder of the
Virgin Group and one of Britain's wealthiest men.
   He said they would try to take off sometime in January.
   Branson and Lindstrand have crossed the Atlantic by balloon but
failed to get off the ground in a trans-Pacific attempt last year.
They have said they want to land somewhere in California.
   Japanese balloonist Fumio Niwa also has postponed his solo
Pacific crossing in a helium-filled craft until next year.
   He said he plans to try again on Jan. 11.
   No one has ever crossed the Pacific alone or in a hot-air
balloon, although four men piloted a helium balloon across the
ocean in 1981.

   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner on Monday restated the
European allies' willingness to wage war on Iraq to force it out of
Kuwait if peaceful means are unsuccesful.
   In Brussels, Belgium, the NATO said ``the solidarity of all
allies and their determination to implement in full the (U.N.)
Security Council resolutions against Iraq remain firm.''
   ---
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III says he still hopes to
revive the stalled American proposal for talks with Saddam Hussein,
but that no ``back channel'' talks are going on.
   He said Sunday on his way to the NATO foreign ministers' meeting
that he wants to travel to Baghdad to see Saddam Hussein by Jan. 3
at the latest. But he gave no indication Saddam was about to agree
to any of 15 dates, from Dec. 20 through Jan. 3, acceptable to
Washington.
   ---
   President Bush had been scheduled to meet with Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz in Washington on Monday, but the visit was put
off by Washington after Saddam refused to set an early date for a
return visit by Baker.
   Saddam has offered to meet Baker Jan. 12, three days before the
U.N deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait or face military
force. but the Bush administration has rejected that date as too
close to the deadline.

<HEAD>Study Questions Iraqi Claim of Using Chemical Weapons Against
Kurds</HEAD>

   A military study says the United States had no
conclusive evidence when it accused Iraq of using chemical weapons
against its Kurdish minority in September 1988.
   The report, written by three analysts at the U.S. Army War
College before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, also says that
``contrary to general belief, Iraq's rulers enjoy significant
popular support.''
   The study examines Iraq's performance in the Iran-Iraq war that
ended in July 1988.
   ``Claims that they (Iraq) won simply by using massive amounts of
chemical weapons cannot be substantiated,'' concludes the study
titled ``Iraqi Power and U.S. Security in the Middle East.''
   Leif Rosenberger, one of the authors, said in a telephone
interview from Carlisle, Pa., that the writers concluded that
Iraq's win over Iran ``was pretty much an armor victory.''
   Although both Iraq and Iran used chemical weapons during their
eight-year war, Iraq's chemical superiority ``was overstated, we
thought,'' Rosenberger said. Iraq used chemical weapons as a
defensive measure against Iranian ``human wave'' attacks, the study
said.
   ``The fundamental point to keep in mind, we feel, is that Iraq
won the war with Iran because of its greater sacrifice,'' said the
study.
   U.S. officials have repeatedly cited Baghdad's possession of
chemical weapons as the reason for taming Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein even if he were to leave Kuwait.
   ``Imagine his (Saddam's) ability to blackmail his neighbors,
should he possess a nuclear device,'' President Bush said at a news
conference earlier this month. ``We've seen him use chemical
weapons on his own people.''
   The war college report, which was declassified and released to
the public in the summer, raises questions about whether Saddam
used chemical weapons against the Kurdish minority in Iraq in fall
1988.
   ``Having looked at all of the evidence that was available to us,
we find it impossible to confirm the State Department's claim that
gas was used in this instance,'' the authors said.
   ``To begin with, there were never any victims produced.
International relief organizations who examined the Kurds ...
failed to discover any,'' the report said. It said the claims rest
solely on testimony of the Kurds, who have long sought autonomy
from Iraq.
   ``Conclusive evidence on the attack was never produced,'' the
study said.
   Col. Doug Johnson, another of the study's authors, said the
authors did not visit Iraq or interview Kurds to reach their
interpretation. Instead, they looked at published reports and at
pictures, he said in a telephone interview.
   They concluded that the Kurds had symptoms - such as temporary
blindness and skin blisters - that are more commonly associated
with attack by fuel air explosives rather than chemical weapons.
   ``We recognize that there are observers who do not share our
view on this,'' the authors said, adding that their conclusions did
not necessarily represent the views of the war college or the Army.
   At the time, Turkish officials found no evidence of chemical
weapons use when they screened the sick and injured among 60,000
Kurdish refugees who fled across the border.
   But Seth Carus of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy
said he had doubts about the conclusion that Iraq did not use
chemical weapons against its own people in late 1988.
   ``The evidence for use, I think, is fairly substantial,'' Carus
said. ``It would require a much more convincing case than they make
to discredit the claim,'' he said.
   The war college study also deals with another incident in which
Kurds were killed by chemical gas in March 1988 in the city of
Halabjah.
   ``Iraq was blamed for the Halabjah attack, even though it was
subsequently brought out that Iran too had used chemicals in this
operation, and it seemed likely that it was the Iranian bombardment
that had actually killed the Kurds,'' the report said.
   Johnson said pictures from Halabjah showed victims with blue
mouths and hands, which points to a cyanide-based gas. The Iranians
- not the Iraqis - are known to possess such gases that affect the
blood, he said.
   Several accounts reported Iraq's alleged use of chemical weapons
in the late summer of 1988, but Iraq denied it.
   On Sept. 8, 1988, the State Department accused Iraq of the
``totally unjustified and abhorrent'' use of chemical weapons
against the Kurds. Then Secretary of State George Shultz lodged a
protest with Iraq, but the department declined to say how it
obtained its evidence.
   Two staffers from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee wrote a
report in October 1988 saying, ``overwhelming evidence exists that
Iraq used chemical weapons on Kurdish civilians in a major
offensive in northern Iraq that began Aug. 25, 1988.''
   They cited eyewitness accounts of Kurdish refugees in Turkey, as
did Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, in accusing Iraq of using chemical weapons to kill
hundreds of Kurdish villagers.

<HEAD>Police Block Arabs from Entering Jerusalem, Temple Mount</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli police blocked thousands of
Palestinians from entering Jerusalem today and barred Arab youths
from the historic mosques on the city's Temple Mount.
   The heightened security was aimed at heading off clashes with
Jewish extremists and to prevent protests over Israel's decision to
deport four Moslem fundamentalist leaders from the occupied Gaza
Strip.
   In the West Bank, students at the closed Bir Zeit University
held a march and stoned police to protest the planned deportations
of the four activists, members of the fundamentalist movement
Hamas, Israel radio reported.
   Police dispersed the demonstration with tear gas and rubber
bullets and arrested four protesters, it said.
   Officials anticipated angry reaction to the expulsions since
Palestinians, many of whom were driven out of Israel with the
founding of the state in 1948, consider deportation from the
occupied lands the worst possible punishment.
   Hamas, or Zeal, is a fundamentalist group that has called for
violence against Isrelis recently. Hamas members murdered three
Israelis at a factory outside Tel Aviv on Saturday.
   The Israeli army said the four were ``instigators of
incitement'' but did not accuse them of direct involvement in the
killings.
   Hundreds of paramilitary border police, most in full riot gear,
were moved into Jerusalem this morning to block the entry of
Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Police teams were posted at gates to Jerusalem's old, walled
city and around the Temple Mount, and Arab residents of Jerusalem
who are under age 40 were turned away.
   Israel resurrected its controversial deportation policy to calm
public anxiety over Arab stabbing attacks on Jews since the Oct. 8
Temple Mount riots, in which 17 Palestinians were shot to death by
police.
   In Jerusalem, police denied a request by the Jewish extremist
group Temple Mount Faithful to go up to the mount, but more than a
dozen members of the group defiantly marched nearby with four
blue-and-white Israeli flags.
   Tension over a planned march by the same group helped set off
the Temple Mount riots.
   Police did not interfere today as the marchers went to the
Wailing Wall at the foot of the mount and lit a candle to mark
Hanukkah, the Jewish festival of lights, Israel radio reported.
   Police detained four members of another extremist group, the
Kach movement, who were demonstrating by the wall. The anti-Arab
group was created by the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, slain last month
by a gunman in New York City.
   Sixty Arabs have been expelled during the three-year Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation, but Israel had stopped the
practice in August 1989, reportedly under U.S. pressure.
   The announcement of renewed deportations drew immediate
criticism from U.S. officials, who charge that expelling people
from the occupied territories violates international law.
   The English-language Jerusalem Post reported today that Israeli
officials viewed the U.S. objections as ``pro forma.''
   But some Israeli officials worried the deportation orders would
weaken U.S. resolve in fighting a U.N. Security Council resolution
that calls for a Middle East peace conference, which Israel
opposes.
   U.S. officials have approved such a conference in principle. But
they have fought recent attempts to introduce a U.N. resolution,
saying that doing so now would give the appearance of rewarding
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Saddam has sought to liken his seizure of Kuwait to Israel's
1967 occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.

<HEAD>Detroit Jet Crash Focuses Attention on Close Calls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROMULUS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The recent collision of two jets on the
taxiway at Detroit Metropolitan Airport was a rarity, but there are
dozens of close calls at airports around the nation each year,
safety officials say.
   The National Transportation Safety Board calls them
``incursions'' - incidents in which pilots report that another
airplane came dangerously close to theirs on the ground.
   They have occurred as often as once every 12,754 takeoffs or
landings, which is the ratio for such incidents during a 20-month
period at Logan International Airport in Boston, federal records
show.
   Statistics published Sunday in The Detroit News showed that none
of the incursions at other airports led to collisions, but the
incidents underscore a growing perception that they are becoming a
major industry problem.
   Detroit had 24 close calls reported among 643,000 operations
during the 20-month period that ended Aug. 31. The newspaper
reported the ratio of incursions at 19 major U.S. airports, but not
the actual number of occurrences.
   ``We've been concerned for some time about runway incursions,
and this Detroit accident has helped bring more attention to it,''
said John Lauber, an investigator for the federal safety board.
   ``In no way is it just a Detroit problem. It is a national
problem,'' he said.
   Eight people died Dec. 3 when two Northwest Airlines planes
collided in fog at Detroit Metro. One plane taxied onto the runway
where the other was rushing toward takeoff.
   The statistics were provided to the federal government by pilots
who file reports with the Aviation Safety Reporting System, a
program monitored by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   ``The hazard potential, the potential of a high-speed collision
is great,'' said David Haase, spokesman for the Airline Pilots
Association.
   ``We feel there are several areas that need to be addressed to
reduce the risk, everything from high-tech surface detection radar
to changing phraseology used by airport personnel,'' he said.
   Following are the 19 airports listed and the number of landings
or takeoffs for every reported incursion.
   Logan International Airport, 12,754; Cleveland Hopkins
International, 16,960; Newark, 18,114; Washington National, 19,035;
Lambert-St. Louis International, 19,675; Los Angeles International,

<HEAD>Rubber Tappers, Environmentalists Celebrate Conviction in Mendes
Killing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TODD LEWAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>XAPURI, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The convictions and 19-year prison
sentences handed down for the murder of environmentalist Chico
Mendes are an important victory in the fight to preserve the
dwindling Amazon forest, rubber tappers say.
   ``This conviction is a landmark'' for environmentalists,
prosecutor Sueli Bellato said over the weekend.
   A seven-member jury determined late Saturday that rancher Darly
Alves da Silva planned the Dec. 22, 1988, slaying and that his son,
Darci Alves Pereira, fired the shotgun that killed the Amazon union
leader and rain forest defender.
   Prosecutors had said the ranchers had ``stained the forest''
with Mendes' blood and urged the maximum 30-year sentence. Brazil
has no death penalty.
   ``Now (landowners) know that every brother rubber tapper or
environmentalist who dies will be avenged,'' said Francisco Barbosa
de Aquino, president of the Rural Workers Union in this remote
town.
   Defense attorney Ruben Torres said his clients would appeal.
   Mendes, leader of the rubber tappers' union, became
internationally known in his fight against ranchers, who sought to
expand their pastures by cutting down the rain forest. The rubber
tappers gather latex from forest trees.
   He was gunned down on the back porch of his humble wooden house
in this backwoods Amazon river town 2,650 miles northwest of Rio de
Janeiro.
   The four-day trial also drew world attention to a centuries-old
battle over land in Brazil that has left thousands of people dead.
Only too often, the perpetrators have gone unpunished.
   ``(The convictions) are an important victory not only for the
rubber tappers, but for all the rural workers' movements in
Brazil,'' Aquino said.
   The Amazon is the world's largest rain forest and the only
habitat for many plant and animal species. Rubber tappers depend on
the forest for their livelihood.
   Once the jungle is cleared it becomes barren of most vegetation
within a few years. The race for development and quick profits
wiped out vast swaths of the 2-million-square mile wilderness.
   Land reform is a deeply divisive issue in this nation of 150
million people, larger in area than the 48 continental United
States. Four percent of the population controls 60 percent of the
arable land, government surveys show.
   President Fernando Collor de Mello, who took office March 15 as
Brazil's first freely elected leader since l960, promised to give
500,000 families land by 1994. But he has not moved to fulfill the
promise.
   As Brazil's economy crumbles, urban poor are flocking to the
Amazon to try to forge a new life on the frontier.
   Ranchers with little fear of reprisal from a corrupt justice
system hire ``pistol men'' for as little as $25 to kill peasants,
or the Roman Catholic priests and other leaders who organize them.
   Since 1980, more than 1,000 people have been killed in land
disputes in Brazil, according to surveys by the Pastoral Commission
for land.
   In the first 11 months of this year, 60 people died - most of
them poor farm hands - and 403 were injured in battles over land,
the commission says.
   Convictions were achieved in only two cases, the international
human rights organization Amensty International says.
   Satellite surveys show ranchers annually destroy an area the
size of Louisiana in the Amazon, which constitutes one-third third
of the world's remaining rain forest.

<HEAD>Syringe Exchange Could Soon Be A Phone Call Away</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fresh syringes would be just a phone call
away under a dial-a-needle plan proposed by a pioneering
AIDS-prevention program.
   Under a plan that program founder David Purchase hopes to start
next month, intravenous drug users could call a telephone number
and, within minutes, meet a needle-exchange van at a major street
intersection anywhere in Pierce County, which encompasses Tacoma.
   ``We don't need to know addresses. It's a question of their
paranoia and the fact we're using radio phones,'' Purchase said,
noting that third parties can sometimes pick up portable-telephone
conversations.
   He said he knows of no other syringe program in the country that
delivers new needles in exchange for used ones.
   For 2{ years Purchase and public health workers have run their
AIDS-prevention program from the street. In addition to trading
needles, which can spread the AIDS virus, they hand out bleach kits
that junkies can use to clean their dirty needles.
   The program, operated by the Point Defiance AIDS Project, will
soon also get its first permanent office. Needles will be traded
from the new office and a 24-hour information line will be started.
However, exchanges will take place mainly through delivery, said
Purchase, the project's executive director.
   Health Department surveys the past two years show about 80
percent of addicts report less needle sharing, more use of clean
syringes and other behaviors that significantly reduce the risk of
infection. The proportion of the county's drug injectors infected
with the AIDS virus has remained stable the past two years at about
1 percent to 2 percent, said Health Department epidemiologist Holly
Hagan.

   Police smashed a bedroom window, crawled through
the opening and rescued a 15-month-old girl who was overcome by
smoke from a blaze that killed two other members of her family.
   Four police officers and the baby's uncle, 35-year-old Ray
Willis, teamed up for the rescue that saved the life of Kacheala
Pickens.
   Officer Mike Maloney, a canine handler, said he administered
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
   ``Just like they taught us in school, I blew one puff of air in
her mouth and she started crying and spitting,'' Maloney said.
``That was the greatest sound to me.''
   The fire broke out shortly after 2 a.m. Sunday at the home of
Larry and Rachel Willis.
   Kacheala suffered smoke inhalation and was in good condition
Sunday night at St. Paul Children's Hospital.
   But Maloney and the three other officers were unable to rescue
Kacheala's father and 5-year-old brother, who had been sleeping in
the living room, where the fire broke out.
   Larry Willis, 30, was found dead in the living room. He had
returned inside the burning home to save the children, relatives
said.
   His 5-year-old son, Frenchie ``J.R.'' Pickens Jr., died in the
emergency room at St. Paul-Ramsey Medical Center after attempts to
revive him failed.
   Another son, Derwen, 3, made it out of the house by himself. He
was treated for smoke inhalation at the hospital.

   A Soviet envoy today opened talks with
Iraqi officials on their demand that Moscow pay penalties to
terminate the contracts of Soviet workers in Iraq.
   A Soviet diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
contract issue threatens to delay the departure from Iraq of 2,565
Soviet workers.
   Vladimir Mordvinov, a deputy minister at the Soviet Foreign
Economic Relations Ministry, was meeting with acting Oil Minister
Hussein Kamel and Deputy Prime Minister Sadoun Hamadi.
   Another Soviet, Sergei Arakilyan, a deputy minister at the
Petroleum Refining and Petrochemical Ministry, has been in Baghdad
for more than three weeks trying to work out agreements on oil and
electrial contracts.
   ``We would like to speed up the process ... take the necessary
measures in Baghdad,'' Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly
Churkin said in Moscow.
   ``All the questions concerning Soviets leaving Baghdad are being
discussed by representatives of the Soviet government. ... The
purpose of that mission is to discuss with the Iraqi side all the
aspects of the stay of the Soviet experts in Iraq,'' he said.
   Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council decided Dec. 4 that all the
remaining Soviets can leave. But it demanded that the Soviet Union
compensate Iraq for terminating their work contracts.
   The Soviet Union said it was willing to pay compensation for
breaking the contracts of the Soviet workers.
   However, sources say the Iraqis have not yet received an
official pledge of payment from the Soviet Union and the two sides
still have to agree on the amount and the payment schedule.
   The Soviet diplomat would not say if Moscow is willing to pay
the amount of compensation demanded by Iraq. Neither side has
disclosed the amount the Iraqis are requesting.
   The Soviet diplomat said Mordvinov will tell Iraqi officials
that Moscow is prepared to comply with ``all international laws
applicable in this case and the Soviet Union will abide by its
obligations in the contracts.''
   Iraq has slowed the processing of exit visas for the Soviet
workers, and sources said the Soviets are somewhat concerned that
the Iraqis want at least some of the Soviets to stay on.
   ``We proceed from the assumption that the Iraqi leadership
assured us that all Soviet people have the chance to leave Iraq and
we proceed on the assumption that it is really so and we want those
promises to be implemented,'' Churkin said in Moscow when asked if
Iraq was trying to prevent Soviets from leaving.
   There were about 11,000 Soviets, including 8,000 Soviet workers
and several hundred military advisers, in Iraq on Aug. 2 when Iraqi
troops invaded Kuwait.
   Churkin said there were 3,316 Soviets in Iraq on Dec. 4. Since
then, he said 751 Soviets have left the country.
   After the invasion of Kuwait, thousands of foreigners were
prevented from leaving Iraq and the occupied emirate, and some -
mostly Britons and Americans -were detained at strategic sites to
prevent a feared attack.
   Some people were allowed to leave in response to appeals from
foreign leaders. Earlier this month, President Saddam Hussein said
the others could go, and most did so.

   President Bush said today he still hopes for
talks with Iraq on resolving the Persian Gulf crisis, but said
Iraqi forces must be out of Kuwait by Jan. 15 ``and that means
entirely.'' Bush would not say what he'd do if the deadline wasn't
met.
   In remarks to reporters after introducing two new Cabinet
nominees, Bush said he was disturbed by Saddam Hussein's weekend
comments that there should be a holy war if necessary to permit
Iraq to keep Kuwait.
   Iraq's invasion of that oil-rich country on Aug. 2 touched off
an international crisis, and led to a United Nation's deadline of
January 15 for Iraq to leave Kuwait. The U.N. resolution permits
the use of force if Iraq has not withdrawn its forces.
   Bush said he has heard from many people who say Saddam may
believe the United States is bluffing, despite the deployment of up
to 400,000 troops into the Middle East.
   ``A lot of people who think they understand him don't feel that
he believes we are serious. They don't feel that he thinks we will
use force.
   ``Some tell me, as recently as yesterday... that he feels that
Saddam Hussein simply does not understand the debate in this
country. he thinks it means our country is divided and we can't go
forward ... and he's just as wrong as he can be.
   His demeanor seemed muted this morning and Bush said in response
to an inquiry that he was ``calmer'' than last Friday when he
lambasted Saddam for rejecting U.S. proposals for a date to meet
with Secretary of State Baker.

<HEAD>Chinese Foreign Minister: Korean War Shaped China's U.N. Vote</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China did not support a U.N. resolution
authorizing force to liberate Kuwait because of the world body's
role in the Korean War, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said in an
article published today.
   Qian told the Communist Party's ``People's Daily'' newspaper
that China remains intent on finding a peaceful solution to the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``I believe it could take longer to achieve a peaceful solution,
but the losses would be less,'' Qian said.
   Before abstaining on the Security Council resolution authorizing
a military strike to drive Iraq from Kuwait, China had supported
all other U.N. resolutions aimed at pressing Baghdad to withdraw
its troops.
   ``But we could not approve the proposal for some countries to
take up arms and use military means under U.N. authority,'' Qian
said. ``On this issue, we have a historical responsibility. The
Korean War launched in the name of the United Nations remains fresh
in the minds of the Chinese people.''
   Chinese officials have made similar comments in private talks
with foreign diplomats in Beijing, but this is the first time the
Chinese publicly compared the Korean War and sanctions against
Iraq.
   Chinese troops joined the North Korean side against U.S.-led
U.N. troops in the 1950-53 war between the two Koreas, which have
been split since the end of World War II.
   Qian said China abstained on the resolution ``to make the
international community continue to work for a peaceful solution.''
   The U.N. Security Council voted 12-2 to allow a military strike
against Iraq if Baghdad refuses to withdraw troops from Kuwait by
Jan. 15. China was the only permanent Security Council member that
did not support the resolution.
   The People's Daily interview is part of a new, higher profile
for Qian.
   The Communist Party magazine ``Seek Truth'' last week published
a lengthy analysis by Qian on China's foreign policy. There have
been reports in Hong Kong that Qian soon will be appointed vice
premier.

<HEAD>Drug Under Fire From California Scientists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drug commonly used as a sedative for
children - chloral hydrate - may cause cancer in humans, state
scientists said.
   In a letter sent last week to the U.S. Food and Drug
administration, state health director Kenneth Kizer also urged the
federal government to issue a warning, and to conduct a study of
the drug's effects in children who have already received it.
   Federal authorities said they would study the issue.
   Details of the problem were reported Sunday by The Sacramento
Bee.
   Kizer, in the letter to FDA Commissioner David Kessler, said
more than 20 animal and laboratory studies show evidence of chloral
hydrate's ability to alter genetic material and cause cancer in
mice following a single oral dose.
   Another test, expected to be completed by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency later this month, has shown that two out of five
animals exposed to chloral hydrate developed liver tumors, he said.
   ``These finds raise serious concerns about carcinogenic risks
associated with the use of this drug and the adequacy of warnings
provided in labeling of chloral hydrate drug products,'' Kizer
wrote.
   ``Interviews with health care professionals who prescribe,
dispense and administer chloral hydrate, including neonatalogists,
pediatricians, pedodontists and hospital pharmacists are unaware of
the carcinogenic risks of this drug,'' Kizer added.
   FDA spokeswoman Faye Peterson said: ``If there is solid evidence
of the safety problem, we'll be taking some action.''
   Chloral hydrate - the original Mickey Finn when used with
alcohol - has been used as a sedative and hypnotic since the
mid-1800s. It has been considered a safe sedative for children
because it doesn't depress the respiratory system. Also, unlike
many pediatric sedatives that are administered intravenously,
chloral hydrate is given orally in a sweetened syrup.
   The drug is also widely used by radiologists, who need children
to hold still during lengthy diagnostic exams, and by
neonatalogists, who routinely give it to newborns on ventilators.
   Because of its widespread use before the federal government
began regulating drugs in 1938, chloral hydrate has never been
subjected to the scientific scrutiny given new drugs, according to
the newspaper.
   Mary Mortenson, a pediatrician, toxicologist and member of the
drug committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics, questioned
whether animal studies on the carcinogenic effects of chloral
hydrate can truly be applied to humans.
   ``Shouldn't we be seeing an epidemic of liver tumors in kids?''
said Mortenson, who heads a poison control center in Columbus,
Ohio. However, she said the FDA needs to seriously consider the
California data.

   Iraq today ordered 33-year-old reservists
to report for military duty, its third major call-up of reserves in
recent weeks.
   The ruling Revolutionary Command Council also issued a statement
of defiance on Kuwait, saying it wanted peace but would not cave in
to demands by the United States and its allies.
   The council said it rejected American attempts to impose a date
for a meeting between Saddam Hussein and Secretary of State James
A. Baker III. The two sides have been unable to agree on a date for
Baker to visit Baghdad.
   Baghdad newspapers reported the Ministry of Defense has recalled
men born in 1957 to bolster the mobilization of almost 500,000
soldiers already in Kuwait and southern Iraq.
   Saddam said on Nov. 19 he would send 250,000 men - seven new
divisions, apparently drawn from reserve forces, and 150,000
reservists and draftees.
   The move came after President Bush announced U.S. forces in the
Persian Gulf would be increased by about 200,000 - to almost
450,000 military personnel in the region - by early January.
   Since then, Iraq has recalled about 60,000 reservist farmers and
an unknown number of others aged 30, 31 and 32.
   Iraq has a force of 500,000 regular soldiers and 480,000
reserves, the sixth largest army in the world. The country of 17
million has about 900,000 men aged 18 to 22 and 1.3 million aged 23
to 32, according to the International Institute for Strategic
Studies.
   The newspaper reports said recruiting offices had informed them
that the 33-year-olds, should report to their units in a week. The
number of affected men was not known.
   Iraq usually recalls its reserves through statements read over
state television and radio. There was no explanation why that
procedure was not followed this time.
   After the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, a U.S.-led multinational
force assembled in the gulf to confront Iraq. A U.N. resolution has
authorized the use of force to liberate Kuwait unless Iraq
withdraws its troops by Jan. 15.
   Iraq had suggested that Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz travel to
Washington today for talks there, and that Baker come to Baghdad on
Jan. 12.
   The United States rejected that date, saying it was too close to
the Jan. 15 deadline set by the U.N. Security Council for Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait or face military action.
   The Revolutionary Command Council, which is headed by Saddam,
issued a statement broadcast over Baghdad radio saying:
   ``We seek peace. We want dialogue for the sake of peace. We
respect legitimacy and seek the application of the international
law on the nation's causes. However, we reject capitulation.''
   It said the Iraqi leaders ``reject the unilateral imposition of
dates as the president of the U.S.A. wishes vis-a-vis the dialogue
to which he agreed.''
   The statement said Iraq was not afraid of the ``fleets and
forces of oppression.''

<TEXT>
   Lothar de Maiziere, who headed East
Germany's first and last democratically elected government, said
today he would not be a member of united Germany's first
government.
   De Maiziere has been dogged by allegations he worked for East
Germany's secret police, the Stasi.
   A deputy leader of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian
Democrats, de Maiziere announced the decision to reporters in Bonn
after meeting with Kohl and Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaueble.
   Schaueble said Kohl would respect the decision.
   De Maiziere, prime minister of the former East Germany before
its Oct. 3 unification with West Germany, has repeatedly denied
allegations that he once worked for the now-disbanded East German
secret police.
   However, there have increasingly been reports that evidence has
been uncovered indicating de Maiziere had once cooperated with the
Stasi.
   De Maiziere told reporters he did not want the stigma of the
Stasi allegations to hurt Germany's new government, which Kohl will
head.
   He also said he wanted to take a leave of absence from his posts
as deputy parliamentary chairman for the party and as Christian
Democratic Union leader in the new state of Brandenburg.
   ``I have asked to be released from my post as federal minister
for special affairs. I do not want to burden the work of the
government or the party with this unclear situation,'' de Maiziere
told reporters.
   De Maiziere, a lawyer, became former East Germany's first freely
elected prime minister in April following elections on March 18.
   He became the top candidate for the post after Wolfgang Schnur,
the conservative's original leading contender, was forced to resign
after he admitted to Stasi contacts just four days before the
election took place.

<HEAD>Former Security Officials Say Military Action Should Not Be
Delayed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fourteen former government officials,
including top national security experts, said today the United
States should not delay military action much beyond Jan. 15 if
Saddam Hussein fails to withdraw his forces from Kuwait.
   ``I don't think we can just sit forever and depend on
sanctions,'' Adm. Thomas Moorer, former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, told reporters.
   Robert F. Ellsworth, former deputy secretary of defense and a
onetime GOP congressman from Kansas, said, ``Saddam Hussein will
not respond to anything except a credible threat of immediate
military action. That's what will move him out of Kuwait.''
   Moorer and Ellsworth released a letter that they and 12 other
officials signed, addressed to Iraqi Foreign Minister Tiraq Aziz.
They said they had planned to deliver it to him during his visit to
Washington, which was canceled.
   The letter expressed support of President Bush and the United
Nations Security Council in ``requiring Iraq's immediate, complete
and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait.''
   ``In the event of Iraq's failure to comply,'' the signers said,
``we do not believe it wise or in the interest of international
security to delay the use of all necessary means much beyond that
date.''
   They noted the views of some in Congress that military action
should be delayed while sanctions are allowed to work. But they
urged Aziz to advise Saddam ``that such misguided views should not
stand in the way of the use of all necessary force'' to enforce the
UN resolution.
   Moorer said war in the Persian Gulf ``is certainly probable''
but ``it is not totally certain.''
   Others signing the letter were Richard V. Allen and Robert C..
McFarlane, both of whom served as national security advisers to
former President Reagan; Thomas C. Reed, former secretary of the
Air Force; John F. Lehman, former secretary of the Navy; Retired
Gen. P.X. Kelly, former commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps;
Retired Vice Adm. John J. Shanahan, former commander of the U.S.
2nd Fleet; Retired Brig. Gen. James D. Hittle, former assistant
secretary of the Navy; retired Brig Gen. Hugh S. Aitken, former
deputy director of joint plans for the Marine Corps; Robert H.
Knight, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York;
Robert D. Blackwill, former special assistant to the president for
national security affairs; Roland A. Paul, former counsel of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee; and William J. Taylor, former
director for national security studies of the U.S. Military
Academy.

   A founder of Albania's first
non-Communist political party said today his newly formed group was
asking the government to postpone elections scheduled for February.
   Gramoz Pashko was reached by telephone from Vienna a day after
he and an associate met with Premier Adil Carcani to discuss
legalizing the group - the Democratic Party of Albania.
   Pashko said he was asking for his party to be allowed to contest
the Feb. 10 elections but would like them postponed by several
months.
   ``We don't have time to be well organized,'' he said.
   A spring election date would make it easier to organize a
nationwide campaign in Albania, where very few people have access
to cars and roads are often blocked by snow across the mountains
that cover 70 percent of the nation.
   In Sunday's meeting, Pashko asked Carcani to legalize the party
and create conditions for it to organize and operate as an
independent political group.
   The new party was created Wednesday after the Communist Party
reversed 45 years of one-party rule and said it would allow
formation of non-Communist political groups. The decision followed
four days of student protests.
   Pashko said the presidium of the People's Assembly, the
rubber-stamp parliament, was expected to issue a decree today on
the formation of parties. According to the decree, the party would
have to register within 30 days.
   He said he also asked for a fair trial of those arrested after
last week's rioting in at least four cities, and for foreign
journalists to be allowed to visit Albania. Only a handful of
foreign journalists has been allowed in.
   A spokesman for the Democratic Party, Genc Pollo, said on Sunday
that the group would seek formal registration with the Justice
Minister this week.
   Earlier today, a Radio Tirana editor, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said by telephone that Carcani praised the leaders of
the new party for having taken ``a clear stand against the violent
actions'' in Albania last week.
   In the meeting with Carcani, Pashko said, the founders of the
new party presented their views about last week's violence.
   ``Our stand was that, of course, we distance ourselves from
these acts of vagabonds and hooligans,'' he said, but the founders
also protested what he called ``provocations'' by some authorities
and police. He did not elaborate.
   Radio Tirana, in a Russian-language broadcast monitored in
Vienna, said Carcani emphasized democracy could be achieved ``only
through the path of dialogue.'' It did not detail his response to
the demands for legalization.
   Thousands of demonstrators burned and ransacked stores and other
buildings in anti-government riots in northern Shkodra, the port of
Durres, nearby Kavaje and central Elbasan Wednesday through Friday.
Several people were injured.
   Albanian chief investigator Chemal Ljama said 157 people would
go on trial because of the violent protests. The Albanian radio
editor said trials may begin as early as today.
   Ljama said those arrested were charged with ``illegitimate
gatherings, ... of plundering the wealth of the people, as well as
of carrying out acts of violence such as assassination attempts,
(inflicting) serious and slight injury.'' The possible penalties
were not known.
   The three cities and the town of Kavaje, where rioting broke out
Wednesday, were reported quiet today. Police and troops patrolled
the streets.
   Communist President Ramiz Alia, who has encouraged limited
reforms in Europe's last hard-line Communist nation, said on
Saturday that the ``criminal activity'' of rioters would not be
tolerated.
   Alia has led the country in implementing reforms this year,
including lifting restrictions of religious practice.
   The new party claims support of 20,000 people in the country of
3.2 million. The Communist Party claims more than 120,000 members.
   The Democratic Party was formed by students and intellectuals.
   Last month, Parliament approved legislation allowing independent
candidates to compete in secret ballot elections. At the time, the
ruling party was adamantly opposed to pluralism.

   Watching Capitol Hill these days brings to
mind the old Dan Hicks song, ``How Can I Miss You When You Won't Go
Away?''
   It's been more than seven weeks since the 101st Congress
adjourned. But many of its members are still around - holding
hearings, issuing press releases and otherwise working to get on
the nation's airwaves and news pages.
   The differences between an in-session and an out-of-session
Congress have been blurred in this age of instant communication and
fast travel. Other than the actual votes on bills, there's little
that cannot be accomplished, and lawmakers are well-polished at
working the system.
   In its early days, Congress would meet for a few months in the
winter, afer which lawmakers would flee the summer moisture and
heat of this sultry swamp city.
   ``We pay them to be full-time, professional legislators now,''
said Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution. Members of the
House now get $96,600 while senators are paid $98,400.
   ``It's not like the 19th century. We give them not only a living
wage but all of the staff they need to work at it. When you combine
that with jet planes ... air conditioning. ... It's a different
attitude,'' he said.
   Some still cling to the ideal of the citizen-lawmaker. The most
recent popular expression of it can be found, Hess said, in the
drive for term limits.
   But there's really no going back to the old days.
   The stalemate in the Persian Gulf provides a vivid example of
how the Democratic-controlled Congress tries to exercise its powers
when not in session.
   ``Even though Congress is in recess they are still in the
loop,'' said Jeff Biggs, whose boss, House Speaker Thomas Foley,
D-Wash., has been working in his Capitol office for most of the
recess.
   By holding hearings and generating publicity, lawmakers can
affect national policy without passing a single bill.
   Taking advantage of exposure on the national C-SPAN cable
network, several committees in the House and Senate have held
hearings on the gulf. While their legislative goal may still be
unclear, they have left no doubt that Congress wants its views
heard and prerogatives protected.
   ``Without those hearings, the public would be left with the
impression, by the administration, that no course other than
military action ... would be effective in driving Iraq from
Kuwait,'' said David Dreyer, spokesman for House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
   Several experts, including former top Pentagon officials,
testified that the United States should give economic sanctions
more time to work before considering an invasion.
   ``The (Bush) administration is in business 365 days a year ...
(spending) 98 cents out of every federal dollar,'' Dreyer said.
``It's our job as an entity to spend just 0.2 percent to monitor''
how that is carried out.
   Of course, good government isn't the only force that moves
Congress to work year-round.
   Because of the long legislative sessions, many younger lawmakers
put their children in school in the Washington area. So they're in
town anyway until the Christmas break.
   And not all of Congress' post-session activity is making members
look good. One of the most-watched events has been the Senate
Ethics Committee's hearings into whether five senators sold their
influence to former savings and loan operator Charles H. Keating
Jr.
   Lawmakers' enthusiasm for hanging around the Capitol does have
its limits.
   At a private meeting, several members of the House Armed
Services Committee barked when they were told that Chairman Les
Aspin, D-Wis., scheduled two weeks of hearings ending just five
days before Christmas. After so many weeks of testimony, Aspin was
insisting on hearing from second-string witnesses, including

   Forced to absorb the brunt of the complaints was Rudy deLeon,
staff director of the panel, said one lawmaker, who requested
anonymity. Aspin himself was stuck in Milwaukee due to another sign
of the season - a winter storm.
   Perhaps it was a sign from Dan Hicks.

   The 16 NATO allies said today the
Persian Gulf crisis can only be settled peacefully by an Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait.
   Reiterating their readiness to wage war against Iraq as early as
next month, if necessary, the NATO foreign ministers said a
``complete Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and the restoration of the
sovereignty and legitimate government of Kuwait are unequivocal
conditions for a peaceful solution'' to the gulf crisis.
   ``There can be no partial solutions,'' said the statement issued
on the opening day of a two-day NATO foreign ministers' meeting. It
called the Iraqi seizure of Kuwait on Aug. 2 a ``flagrant violation
of international law.''
   The ministers condemned the Baghdad government's ``persistent
contempt'' for United Nations resolutions imposed to try to force
it out of Kuwait.
   ``Iraq's behavior threatens peace,'' the foreign ministers'
statement said.
   Also today, Iraq's ruling Revolutionary Command Council said it
wants peace but would not cave in to demands by the United States
and its allies.
   The council said it rejected American attempts to impose a date
for a meeting between Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and Secretary
of State James A. Baker III. The Iraqi council said in a statement
that Iraq does not fear the ``fleets and forces of oppression.''
   The NATO ministers' statement was issued after Baker discussed
the gulf crisis with his NATO counterparts along with his stalled
efforts to start direct talks with Iraq.
   While the allies said they hoped war could be averted in the
gulf, they reaffirmed their pledge to abide by all U.N.
resolutions, including one adopted Nov. 29 that authorizes the use
of force unless Iraq withdraws from Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   ``The responsibility now lies with the government of Iraq to
ensure peace by complying fully with the mandatory United Nations
decisions,'' the foreign ministers' statement said.
   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner opened the meeting by
saying the allies ``are determined that the brutal aggression and
violation of international law committed by Saddam Hussein in
invading Kuwait will not be allowed to stand.
   ``The solidarity of all allies and their determination to
implement in full the Security Council resolutions against Iraq
remain firm,'' he added.
   Woerner did not say anything about increasing North Atlantic
Treaty Organization forces in the gulf. Such a decision would be up
to the individual NATO countries. All of them except Iceland,
Luxembourg, Germany and Turkey have troops, naval units or
warplanes in the gulf region.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz was to have met with President
Bush in Washington today, but the meeting was scuttled by a
disagreement over when Baker would see Saddam.
   Bush has said he won't send Baker to Baghdad any later than Jan.
3; Saddam says the meeting should occur Jan. 12. Bush has said that
is too late.
   Bush said today he still hopes for talks with Iraq, but
reiterated that Iraqi troops must leave the emirate by Jan. 15.
   ``I think at midnight (on Jan. 15), if he's not totally out of
Kuwait, the U.N. sanctions must be fulfilled,'' Bush said in
Washington.
   In Baghdad today, a Soviet envoy, Vladimir Mordvinov, began
talks with Iraqi officials on Iraq's demand that Moscow pay
penalties to terminate the contracts of Soviet workers in Iraq. A
Soviet diplomat said the issue threatens to delay the departure of
2,565 Soviets.
   Britain's ambassador to Kuwait and his consul flew to Jordan
from Baghdad today en route home to London. They were the last two
Western diplomats to leave Kuwait.
   The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait was evacuated last week upon
completion of Saddam's blanket hostage release. The Iraqi president
had prevented thousands of foreigners from leaving.
   The Iraqi government newspaper Al-Joumhouriya today quoted Abul
Abbas, leader of the Palestine Liberation Front, as saying squads
have been prepared to strike American targets worldwide if war
breaks out.
   Abbas, whose followers hijacked a cruise ship in 1985 and killed
a American passenger, was quoted as saying: ``If war flares up it
will not go the same direction as planned by the American
administration. The United States does not have the final decision
to confine it to a limited area.''
   By the middle of next month, Washington will have deployed more
than 400,000 troops in the gulf region. The allies have committed
smaller forces - Britain with 30,000 troops and France with 10,000
have the largest European contingents in the 27-member anti-Iraq
coalition.
   Iraq has an estimated 500,000 troops in Kuwait and southern
Iraq.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today called for a
national referendum to decide whether to hold the 15 Soviet
republics together on the basis of his proposed Union Treaty.
   ``We must not let the union disintegrate. This would have a
devastating effect on millions of people,'' he said in a state of
the union message to the Congress of People's Deputies.
   Just after the 2,250-member congress convened today, a deputy
who said she was ashamed that her country is accepting foreign food
aid took to the podium and issued an emotional call for Gorbachev's
resignation.
   The call for a no-confidence vote was rejected, but the
political divisions that threaten the survival of the Soviet state
were abundantly evident.
   Nevertheless, Gorbachev said that by working together the Soviet
people can overcome the crisis within 18 months.
   ``We have learned a lesson ... we should not be
panic-stricken,'' he said.
   Gorbachev urged the congress to approve proposed constitutional
amendments to strengthen the presidency, adding the post of vice
president and replacing the 89-member Council of Ministers with a
Cabinet of about 15 people.
   Gorbachev aides say it is unlikely that Nikolai Ryzhkov, who
heads the Council of Ministers and who is widely blamed for the
failure of the nation's economic reform, will remain prime minister
in the government reshuffle.
   Before the congress opened in the Kremlin today, Gorbachev's
aides indicated the Soviet leader wanted the body to endorse his
Union Treaty.
   Delegates from the republics of Lithuania and Armenia were
boycotting the meeting, and lawmakers from Estonia and Latvia said
they would not take part in discussions of the treaty.
   ``We must take strong measures to halt separatist nationalist
actions,'' Gorbachev said in proposing the referendum. He said the
results of the referencum in every republic ``will be a final
verdict.'' But it was not clear when the referendum would be held
or how it would be administered.
   The congress, the country's highest lawmaking body, has the
right to approve the proposed constitutional changes, but only the
republics have the power to approve the proposed Union Treaty.
   Gorbachev apparently sought to remove the decision-making power
from separatist republics in favor of a direct vote.
   Gorbachev's chief political rival, President Boris N. Yeltsin of
the Russian republic, did attend the congress session. Gorbachev
offered Yeltsin, who heads the largest, richest and most populous
republic, the empty chair next to him on the podium and the two men
shook hands but did not speak.
   Yeltsin is leading a movement among the 15 Soviet republics to
wrest economic control from the central government.
   The conflict has set off economic and administrative turmoil,
contributing to the food shortages that have in the past month
prompted Gorbachev to seek and secure Western credits, food and
medical supplies.
   The congress has largely supported Gorbachev's initiatives, and
its previous three gatherings have been momentous.
   The most recent, last spring, amended the constitution to end
the Communist Party's guaranteed monopoly on power.
   But rival parties have been slow to gain strength, and Gorbachev
seemed unlikely to face an organized challenge from either radical
reformers or hard-liners in the congress.
   The radical Inter-Regional Group on Friday ended a two-day
caucus without agreeing on a common platform. And on Saturday,
members of the hard-line Soyuz, or Union movement, said they would
back Gorbachev's proposals.
   Last month, some Soyuz members demanded Gorbachev declare a
state of emergency, suspend elected legislatures and political
movements in rebellious republics, or step down.
   Gorbachev responded by replacing the moderate interior minister
with a KGB general and ordered a crackdown on the pilfering and
profiteering that have exacerbated food shortages and the collapse
of the state distribution system.
   Several of Gorbachev's senior allies have come out with strong
law-and-order speeches in recent days, threatening separatists and
black marketeers.
   The president's aides say the tough talk is meant to appease
hard-liners, not to signal that the Soviet leader is abandoning
reform. They say Gorbachev needs to rally conservatives - who in
many cases control transportation and distribution networks so his
reforms to survive the winter.
   In the call for a no-confidence vote, Sazhi Umalatova, a
Communist Party member from the Chechen-Ongush Autonomous Republic
in the Russian republic, accused the president of bringing
``devastation, hunger, cold, blood, tears'' to the people.
   Fellow lawmakers sat in stunned silence and a national audience
watched on live television as Umalatova accused Gorbachev of
destroying the country.
   Umalatova's call for vote of no confidence in Gorbachev was
rejected by a vote of 1,288 to 426 with 183 abstentions.

   Here is a look at the changes President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has proposed to Soviet legislators on streamlining the
executive branch.

<TEXT>
   To be created or revamped:
   FEDERATION COUNCIL - Gorbachev proposed strengthening this body,
created in March as an advisory board including representatives of
the 15 Soviet republics. It would determine the basic direction of
internal and foreign policies of the nation as a whole, and
coordinate the actions by the republics, including settling ethnic
disputes. Members would include the president, the vice president -
a new position - and the presidents of republics.

   INTER-REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE - A permanent, working body of the
Federation Council, this new panel would be made up of experts from
the republics. Gorbachev has mentioned this body in speeches, but
has not offered specifics.

<TEXT>
   NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL - Made up of representatives of the
KGB security police, Interior Ministry, Defense Ministry and
Foreign Ministry, this new body would discuss security and defense
issues.

<TEXT>
   CABINET OF MINISTERS - This new group of government ministers
would be subordinate to the Federation Council. It would not have
the power to make decisions but would implement them. Gorbachev
aides said it would have a ``technocratic'' function, and consist
of about 15 members, including the prime minister. A list of posts
to be included in the Cabinet suggested the number would exceed 15.

   To be eliminated:
   COUNCIL OF MINISTERS - This grouping of dozens of ministers,
ranging from those in charge of nuclear energy to food production,
would be eliminated. It has wielded great power, particularly over
price-setting, production targets and allocation of resources.

<HEAD>Report: NASA Has Neglected Maintenance Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE SAKSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA's poor maintenance practices have caused a
fire in a mission control room, falling concrete in a space shuttle
building and a steam line explosion, according to a government
report issued today.
   The General Accounting Office report says the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration is working to correct the
shortcomings. Congress appropriated $141 million for maintenance in
1990 and more has been asked for future years.
   The GAO recommends that the space agency develop a comprehensive
maintenance strategy, spend more money on upkeep and do annual
surveys to determine which of its centers most need repairs.
   ``People and facilities are critical to mission success,'' said
Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., who released a summary of the report
today. ``We can't afford breakdowns on the ground if we're going to
have spectaculars in space.''
   The report said launch pads and the space shuttle processing
facilities are generally well-maintained. But it said that eight
NASA centers visited by GAO inspectors all have deteriorating
facilities such as leaking roofs, peeling paint and leaking steam
lines. Many of NASA's buildings are 30 to 50 years old.
   The report said NASA rated its own facilities as marginal.
   ``An example of deterioration is concrete falling from the roof
of the 52-story building where the shuttle is joined with the
external fuel tank and solid rocket boosters.
   ``NASA installed netting beneath the roof deck to catch the
concrete,'' the summary said.
   Other incidents included a cooling tower that partially
collapsed under the weight of ice that formed because water valves
malfunctioned, the report said.
   Experts at the National Research Council recommend that agencies
spend at least 2 percent to 4 percent of their facilities'
replacement value on maintenance, the report said.
   The percentage for most of NASA's facilities between 1985 and
1989 was between 0.9 percent and 1.5 percent, it said.
   Mikulski said this year's federal budget includes a special $20
million fund to start rehabilitation and major maintenance at
NASA's field centers.
   The space agency's facilities include 2,700 buildings and 3,200
other major structures encompassing 36 million square feet.

<HEAD>Cambridge Ordinance Requires Condom Vending Machines To Curb AIDS

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A condom vending machine once marked a
bar or restaurant as being raffish, if not downright seedy. No
more, at least not in Cambridge.
   Under a new law, virtually all public businesses in this college
town are being asked to install condom vending machines before next
November. City officials planned to kick off the new ordinance
today at a restaurant, the Green Street Grill, that is becoming the
first to publicly install one of the dispensers.
   The law, passed Nov. 5 as an anti-AIDS measure, requires all
hotels, motels, restaurants, bars, movie theaters, health
facilities and municipal buildings to install the machines. Schools
are exempted, as is any other establishment that objects to the
requirement.
   ``We are not going to be condom cops, but we are encouraging
people to take the law seriously and put in machines,'' said
Jennifer Wolfrum, community health coordinator for the city.
``Those not wanting to install machines don't have to.''
   Wolfrum said more than 100 residents have been diagnosed with
AIDS over a 9{-year period. She said 60 percent of those people
have died. She said that from 1,000 to 3,000 Cambridge residents
are infected with the HIV virus.

   President Bush said today he still hopes for
talks with Iraq on resolving the Persian Gulf crisis, but said
Iraqi forces must be out of Kuwait by Jan. 15 ``and that means
entirely.'' Bush did not say what he would do if Saddam Hussein
fails to meet the deadline.
   ``I think at midnight (on Jan. 15), if he's not totally out of
Kuwait, the U.N. sanctions must be fulfilled,'' Bush said.
   In remarks to reporters after introducing two new Cabinet
nominees, Bush said he was disturbed by Saddam Hussein's weekend
comments that there should be a holy war if necessary to permit
Iraq to keep Kuwait.
   Bush vowed anew that Iraq must not be allowed to profit from its
takeover of Kuwait.
   ``We've got an opportunity for a new world order but that
opportunity will be lost if an aggressor gets one single
concession. ... It's important that the man understand that we're
serious about this.''
   Bush also met with Ambassador Nathaniel Howell, who kept the
U.S. embassy in Kuwait open despite pressure from Baghdad. Howell
said Iraq was winterizing military bunkers in Kuwait - prompting a
reporter to comment aloud that ``it doesn't bode well for us.''
   Bush replied, ``It doesn't bode well for Saddam Hussein.''
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 touched off an international
crisis, and led to a United Nation's deadline of January 15 for
Iraq to leave Kuwait. The U.N. resolution permits the use of force
if Iraq has not withdrawn its forces.
   Bush said he has heard from many people who say Saddam may
believe the United States is bluffing, despite the deployment of up
to 400,000 troops into the Middle East.
   ``A lot of people who think they understand him don't feel that
he believes we are serious. They don't feel that he thinks we will
use force.
   ``Some tell me, as recently as yesterday... that he feels that
Saddam Hussein simply does not understand the debate in this
country. he thinks it means our country is divided and we can't go
forward ... and he's just as wrong as he can be.
   His demeanor seemed muted this morning and Bush said in response
to an inquiry that he was ``calmer'' than last Friday when he
lambasted Saddam for rejecting U.S. proposals for a date to meet
with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Bush's comments came after several days of international
jockeying over dates for direct talks between American and Iraqi
diplomats. Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz had been due in
Washington today to meet with the president. But that visit was put
off when the two sides could not agree on a date for Baker's visit
to Baghdad.
   ``I hope these talks will take place,'' he said. But he
repeatedly sidestepped questions on what he would do if there were
no talks and if Iraq did not comply with the withdrawal deadline.
   Bush accused Saddam on Friday of refusing to see Baker until too
close to the Jan. 15 deadline set by the United Nations for a
withdrawal from Kuwait. He repeated his accusation today, saying
again that the United States had offered Saddam 15 separate dates
for Baker's trip.
   Bush has said he wants Baker to meet with Saddam no later that
Jan. 3. Asked what difference nine day makes - Saddam has proposed
a Jan 12 date - Bush replied:
   ``If I thought that meeting on the 14th would permit him to
comply fully with the UN resolutions I'd be very flexible. But
that's not possible.''
   In reference to the Iraqi leaders' weekend comments, Bush said,
``He keeps making these statements that fly directly in the face of
the international positions taken by the U.N. Security Council.

   More than 1,300 Marseille dockworkers
went on strike Monday in a pay dispute, severely disrupting

   The strike halted cargo loading and unloading at the port's east
basin, used primarily by ships traveling to and from Corsica and
North Africa. Strikers used trucks and machinery to block entries
to the docks.
   The 690 dockworkers in the west basin were not involved.
   The strike arose from a dispute with management over whether
several dozen workers should be paid for a three-hour period last
week in which they did not work because of a strike by a seamen's

   Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar said
Monday he is prepared to use ``any amount of force needed'' if
dialogue fails to halt the Hindu-Moslem riots that have claimed
more than 300 lives in the past 10 days.
   ``Certain people are trying to create trouble. They are
exploiting this thing,'' he said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
   The sectarian violence helped bring down his predecessor, Prime
Minister V.P. Singh, about a month ago. Parliament then gave
Chandra Shekhar a vote of confidence to form a new government.
   He said Monday he was optimistic that dialogue could defuse the
sectarian rivalries and fears that have spurred Hindus and Moslems
to murderous riots in several cities. Mobs have slaughtered infants
with axes, burned people alive and lynched passengers on passing
trains.
   ``It is very difficult to grapple with the situation,'' Chandra
Shekhar said. ``We want to deal with the situation with restraint
and patience.''
   However, he said, if dialogue fails and ``if these things don't
stop, any amount of force needed will be used in order to stop the
situation.''
   ``We have already initiated some processes, and we are trying to
have a dialogue with different (religious) communities,'' he said.
   Chandra Shekhar, a veteran politician, tends to speak in
political platitudes in public. But he has a reputation for
tough-minded effectiveness when it comes to wheeling and dealing in
private with his friends and foes.
   The Hindu-Moslem riots erupted when Hindu fundamentalists
renewed their campaign to build a temple on a site occupied by a
mosque in northern Ayodhya. Singh's government fell when he lost
the support of a Hindu right-wing party during an attempt to build
the temple in late October.
   Since then, members of India's Hindu majority and Moslem
minority have attacked each other with a ferocity that has little
parallel since 1947, when the British colonial Asian Subcontinent
was partitioned into mostly Hindu India and overwhelmingly Moslem
Pakistan.
   Chandra Shekhar took office as the leader of the Janata
Dal-Socialist Party, a breakaway faction of Singh's Janata Dal
Party. His rise to power was made possible only by support from his
longtime political enemy, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi,
leader of the Congress Party.
   Chandra Shekhar said his willingness to make political deals and
engage in dialogue should not be interpreted as a sign of weakness.
He said he was more interested in running the country than in
trying to figure out how long his minority government would last.
   On Friday, he said he soon would present a new peace plan for
Punjab, where Sikh extremists have killed more than 3,100 people
this year, the highest annual toll since they launched their
separatist campaign in 1982.
   ``The only thing I offer is that I am ready to talk with anybody
who is an Indian and who is ready to negotiate and discuss and
settle this issue within the framework of the Indian
Constitution,'' he said in the interview Monday at his official
residence.
   He said ``self-determination'' could be discussed ``under the
purview of the Indian constitution'' - a restriction that would
rule out the independent nation demanded by some Sikh radicals.
   On Kashmir, where more than 1,600 people have died this year as
Indian troops try to put down a Moslem secessionist movement,
Chandra Shekhar said ``there is no limit'' to his willingness to
negotiate.
   But he reiterated the views of all previous Indian governments
that a plebiscite for Kashmir's self-determination ``is out of the
question.''
   Most of the problems of this nation of 880 million people,
whether religious, political or economic, can be traced to needs
for greater development, Chandra Shekhar said.
   A socialist since his university days, the 63-year-old prime
minister said socialism was still the answer to ``equalize
humanity'' - but this did not mean dogmatic adherence to the
socialist models of other nations.
   He said he would not shut the door to foreign investment, but
India must choose carefully before deciding what sort of products
and technology are needed.
   ``Our problem is that we are a scarce-resource area. We cannot
squander our resources for something that is not essential,''
Chandra Shekhar said. ``We should not try to ape the Western
world.''
   He acknowledged having little affinity for international
relations, unlike the political dynasty of prime ministers
Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. The dynasty
governed independent India for all but four years in the nation's
43-year history.
   ``I am a man who knows very little about foreign affairs, and I
am not much interested, but there is some meeting in January,'' he
said, apparently referring to the Commonwealth summit. ``Just to
discharge my duties, I shall go to the foreign countries.''
   Improving ties with Pakistan, which whom India has shared a
border and animosity since they became independent from Britain,
was more important, he said.
   He said he and Pakistan's new prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, have
set up a hot line that they have used twice in the past month. He
did not say what they discussed.

for help in resolving unanswered questions about the 1983
destruction of a Korean airliner carrying 269 passengers, including
a Georgia congressman.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., wrote Gorbachev last month in an appeal for
information on whether the wreckage of the plane or the remains of
its passengers or any of their effects were located.
   Although the letter was sent to the Soviet president Nov. 14,
aides said Monday the senators have received no response.
   ``This unanswered question is a constant, troubling burden for
the families and relatives of the Americans who perished on the
flight,'' the senators wrote.
   Sixty-three Americans, including Rep. Larry McDonald, D-Ga.,
were among those presumed killed when Korean Air Lines Flight 007
was shot down Sept. 1, 1983, by a missile fired from a Soviet
fighter plane.
   The plane was far off course over the Soviet island of Sakhalin
north of Japan when it was shot down.
   Soviet authorities gave American and Japanese officials some
items recovered from the plane several weeks after it was shot
down, but they have never acknowledged whether they found the main
wreckage or any of the remains of the victims.
   The Soviet Union has maintained the airliner was on a spy
mission for the United States and deliberately violated Soviet air
space. It also has contended that the pilot of the Soviet fighter
didn't know he was firing at a civilian airliner.
   The United States has denied the spying charges, as well as
Soviet contentions that American air traffic monitors knew the
plane was flying into Soviet air space but failed to radio the
Korean crew to change course.

   Alaska Airlines today announced its plans for the
first regularly scheduled passenger jet service from the West Coast
to the Soviet Union.
   The airline said it will begin service June 17 between Anchorage
and two Soviet Far East cities, Magadan and Khabarovsk. Three
round-trip flights per week will be offered during the summer.
   Magadan, about 2,000 miles southwest of Anchorage, is a city of
150,000 on the Sea of Okhotsk. Khabarovsk, about 1,000 miles south
of Magadan, is a major commercial center and river port of about
700,000 near the Chinese border.
   In addition to regular round-trip and one-way fares, Alaska said
it would offer several tour packages. The airline plans to use a
136-seat Boeing 727-200 on the routes.
   The U.S. Department of Transportation awarded Alaska the route
on Nov. 8. It is one of four new passenger routes established in
June under a new U.S.-Soviet bilateral air service agreement, and
the only one over the Pacific Ocean.

   Here are excerpts of the statement on
the Persian Gulf crisis issued Monday by NATO foreign ministers:
   ``Iraq's invasion and brutal occupation of Kuwait represent a
flagrant violation of international law and the charter of the
United Nations and pose a fundamental challenge to international
order.
   ``We condemn Iraq's consistent contempt for the resolutions of
the United Nations Security Council which reflect the overwhelming
solidarity and commitment of the international community.
   ``Iraq's behavior threatens peace.
   ``It jeopardizes the unprecedented opportunity for the United
Nations to realize the original vision of its role in promoting
global peace and stability.
   ``The responsibility now lies with the government of Iraq to
ensure peace by complying fully with the mandatory United Nations
decisions. ...
   ``(A) complete Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and the restoration
of the sovereignty and legitimate government of Kuwait are
unequivocal conditions for a peaceful solution. There can be no
partial solutions.
   ``We firmly support (U.N.) Resolution 678 and all other relevant
resolutions adopted by the Security Council and reiterate our hope
that their implementation can be achieved by peaceful means.
   ``We are confident that a contact between the presidency of the
European Community and the foreign minister of Iraq, among other
initiatives, can make a contribution to this purpose. We also
encourage action by the U.N. Secretary General to this end. In
particular, we support efforts for a dialogue, such as those made
by President Bush, to provide Iraq through direct high-level
contacts, with the clearest possible understanding of the
consequences of further postponing the fulfillment of its
obligations.
   ``We agree that Iraq must not use these initiatives to delay
meeting the Jan. 15 date established by the United Nations. ...
   ``Security Council Resolution 678 has authorized the use of all
necessary means if Iraq does not comply before that date, and has
expressly called on all governments to provide appropriate support
in implementing the resolutions adopted by the Security Council.
   ``Our countries will continue to respond positively to this
United Nations request. Each of us ... undertakes to provide
further support for this continuing effort, in line with evolving
requirements. ...
   ``We note that the crisis in the gulf poses a potential threat
to one of our allies having common borders with Iraq, and we
reaffirm (that) an armed attack against one of our states shall be
considered an attack against them all.''

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 8 grafs to UPDATE with Kerkorian filing report with
SEC; pick up 7th graf, `But Chrysler's ...' A version moved on
financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California billionaire Kirk Kerkorian may turn a
quick, tidy profit on the $272 million he has invested in the
struggling Chrysler Corp., according to some analysts.
   A variety of scenarios - including a takeover bid - have
surfaced since Friday's news that Kerkorian bought 9.8 percent of
Chrysler's stock, becoming the company's largest shareholder.
   In a report filed today with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Kerkorian said he has plans to buy more Chrysler stock
and does not immediately intend ``an extraordinary corporate
transaction'' such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation.
   A Chrysler statement Friday said the company ``would not comment
on his motives for such an investment.'' As Chrysler announced the
purchase, it said its board of directors lowered the threshold for
the company's ``poison pill'' anti-takeover provision to kick into
action.
   Previously, if a shareholder collected 20 percent of the stock,
other shareholders could buy stock at less-than-market value. On
Friday, the board halved that to 10 percent.
   Kerkorian, known as a shrewd investor, said he would consider
general economic, money and stock market conditions in determining
whether to buy more Chrysler shares.
   He said in the SEC report that his actual stake in Chrysler as
of last Friday was 22 million shares, or 9.77 percent. The stock
was purchased, mostly on the open market at the New York Stock
Exchange, between Oct. 11 and Nov. 16 at prices ranging from $10.50
to $11.25.
   Kerkorian has told Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca he was a
passive investor.
   But Chrysler's lack of acknowledgement that the purchase was
solely for investment and its directors' move on the poison-pill
language started speculation about Kerkorian's motives.
   William Steele of Dean Whitter Reynolds Inc. in San Francisco
doubted Kerkorian's passive investor characterization.
   ``It seems to me that a passive investor is somebody who's after
dividends and price appreciation,'' he said. ``His past history
doesn't show that he is a passive person.''
   Analysts saw little chance of Kerkorian, or anyone else, buying
Chrysler, then breaking it up and spinning off, say, its profitable
Jeep or minivan business or its Chrysler Financial Corp.
subsidiary.
   Breaking up the car and ruck business would likely cause an
instant war with the United Auto Workers union. Two years ago,
Chrysler tried to sell its Acustar parts subsidiary, and the UAW
immediately took to the streets. The attempt eventually was
scuttled.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and especially Chrysler
face intense pressure these days from slumping sales and rising
labor costs, all under the threat of a continued economic downturn.
   Analysts have speculated that dividends for the Big Three may be
lowered. GM's and Ford's stand at 75 cents a share and Chrysler's
at 30 cents.
   Nevertheless, analysts acknowledge that Chrysler's stock is
undervalued. After Kerkorian's announcement it closed Friday at
$12.25 a share, unchanged from Thursday.
   That makes Chrysler a good investment, some analysts and
investors say.
   ``Most people assume this is nothing more than someone who views
the stock as undervalued,'' said Michigan state Treasurer Robert
Bowman. The state controls about 6.5 million shares, or about 3
percent, of Chrysler's outstanding stock.
   Analyst Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. of New York said the
investment made sense.
   ``Barring a nuclear war in the Middle East, he gets his money
back,'' said Brady, who's bullish on the Big Three.
   Analysts were waiting to see what kind of reaction Wall Street
would have this week.
   Typically, when a large investor sinks that much into a company,
the move is viewed as an endorsement of the company.
   Early Friday afternoon, just before the announcement of the
purchase, trading on Chrysler stock was halted. Trading resumed
after about two hours, time enough for the news to sink in.
Chrysler's move on its poison-pill provision, Healy said, caused
the market to shrug it off.

<HEAD>Czechoslovak Board Game Pokes Fun At Former Communist Rulers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ONDREJ HEJMA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year after their peaceful
revolution, Czechoslovaks are snapping up a new board game that
makes fun of the Communists who ruled their nation for four
decades.
   The game, called ``Building a Monument to Stalin,'' takes
satirical aim at the relics of Communist rule - Marxist education,
the secret police, bureaucratic pettiness and corruption.
   Players roll the dice and draw cards giving instructions that
could have been chillingly real before they took to the streets 13
months ago and toppled their hard-line leaders.
   ``Participating in an unauthoized demonstration, the water
cannon pushed you back five spaces,'' says one card.
   ``After a night at the Communist Youth disco, you come down with
venereal disease - bribe the doctor 2,000 crowns,'' says another.
   Visiting a Soviet army base, ``the extra three glasses of vodka
with which you washed down the boiled carp made you sick - miss two
turns,'' says a third.
   The Monopoly-like game sells for 50 crowns, the equivalent of a
nice restaurant lunch.
   Before they can start the game, players must put it together
with scissors and glue, even assembling makeshift paper dice.
   That's a pointed reminder of the Communist-era consumer practice
of scrounging in shops for makeshift goods, patching together what
they were lucky enough to find or buy.
   Although they can joke now about the economic hardships under
the Communists, Czechoslovaks are bracing for even tougher times as
their country makes the painful switch to a market economy.
   ``This may be the last time we can laugh about how stupid the
Communists were and still have a good meal for dinner,'' said
Martina Klementova, a 34-year old teacher.
   The goal of the game is to win control of sites along the board
and build a monument to the late Soviet dictator. A real-life
monument to Stalin - a gargantuan statue - once towered over
Prague, but it was dismantled.
   Players roll the dice to determine rewards - the chance to study
at a university, or even become party general secretary - or
punishment, such as detention by police.
   The game can be found in department stores as well as at small
stands in the Metro, and it has been selling briskly. Its inventor,
a 39-year-old writer, is a little disconcerted by its success.
   ``I heard about this in a pub from a guy who spent 10 years in
jail and devised something along these lines just to kill time,''
said Petr Sabach.
   ``Several years later I started scribbling something similar on
the table of the same pub ... and in less than a day I was
finished,'' he said.
   The game is also sold in neighboring Poland, which also recently
shook off Communist rule. Sabach said he and the producer had made
$33,000 from sales.
   The son of a ministry clerk and an army colonel who was a
Communist Party member, Sabach says the things the game makes fun
of were part of his childhood.
   ``These things were with me ever since I was born, whether I
liked it or not,'' he said.
   Jana Savrdova, a 25-year-old waitress, says the game is fun.
``And yet it reminds one of the not-so-old times when something
like this was actually dangerous,'' she said.

   A ride aboard a Soviet spacecraft and a visit to
the space station Mir await the winner of a national sweepstakes to
be conducted by a company here, executives said today.
   The sweepstakes, dubbed ``The Ultimate Adventure,'' will accept
entries beginning today from ``any interested person'' who is
willing to call a 900 telephone number and enter for a fee of
$2.99.
   ``He or she need not be a test pilot or a scientist or a
government official,'' according to a release from Space Travel
Services Corp. ``The butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker are
all eligible. It could be your neighbor. It could be you.''
   Space Travel President David Mayer said the company has
contracted for a one-week stay on Mir. There has been no
independent confirmation from Soviet officials.
   The lucky person will be selected in December 1991 by the
Houston office of KPMG Peat Marwick, an accounting firm.
   The winner also could take a cash payment of $1.5 million
instead of the flight.
   Space Travel Services said because of local laws, people listing
addresses in New York, Florida or Rhode Island would not be
eligible for the flight.
   ``Our long-term business strategy is to arrange for space travel
opportunities for anyone who wishes to go into space,'' said James
Davidson, senior vice president of Space Travel Services. ``To
introduce this service and our company to the general public, we've
arranged for a little sweepstakes. The trip to the Mir space
station is the ultimate adventure.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration suspended its
plans to have civilians accompany astronauts in space after the
1986 Challenger disaster.
   The Soviets - for a hefty price - have transported passengers of
a variety of nationalities to their space station for stays of
varying duration. They have included a Frenchman, a Cuban and an
East German. The Tokyo Broadcasting Service recently paid $12
million to the Glavkosmos sapace agency for Japanese journalist
Toyohiro Akiyama's ride.
   But there's never been an American.
   
   ``I would say it's a very natural evolutionary activity,'' said
Art Dula, whose Houston-based Space Commerce Corp. markets Soviet
space services in the United States and negotiated the deal on
behalf of Space Travel Services.
   ``I've been doing this business with the Soviets since 1986,''
he said. ``I have found the Soviets are very flexible. They do not
have a large bureaucracy. I have found they are willing to consider
anything beneficial and not harmful. I found they thought this was
rather innovative.''
   A woman at the KPMG Peat Marwick's Houston office said she was
unaware of the sweepstakes, but said others who might know were not
immediately avaiable.
   Space Travel said it would pay the guest cosmonaut expenses for
the trip, the pre-flight training, which could take as much as six
months, and other expenses.
   The company said the winner would have to pass a Soviet physical
examination. The pre-flight training is to include physical
training plus Russian-language training.
   The flight is expected to occur in late 1992 or early 1993. The
winner would accompany two Soviet cosmonauts, rendezvous with the
space station and spend about a week there in orbit.
   The company is described as being founded this year by ``a group
of space enthusiasts who want to make a positive change in people's
attitudes toward space and space travel,'' according to a release.
   Mayer is described as the executive vice president and
co-founder of Space City Construction Services, a commercial
construction contractor.

   An in-depth study of the Soviet economy
concludes that massive Western aid at this time would be wasted
because the country's economic system is in such disarray, official
sources said Monday.
   Instead, an extensive infusion of technical assistance to help
carry out fundamental economic reforms will be recommended,
according to sources familiar with the report due to be released
this week.
   ``Basically, the problems are structural, which no amount of
external aid will solve,'' one Soviet specialist said Monday.
   The sources, speaking on condition they not be identified,
characterized the findings as pessimistic and depressing because
they describe a system even more backward than expected and
practically paralyzed by inefficiency and confusion.
   ``No amount of aid will make a real difference. The system
simply cannot absorb it. The pipe is so porous that very little
would reach its intended target,'' said Ilya Prizel of the Johns
Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies.
   The study, conducted by the International Monetary Fund, World
Bank and two European-based development groups, comes on the heels
of a weekend summit at which Western leaders ordered $1 billion in
emergency aid for the Soviets and approved spending more than that
amount on technical assistance during the next two years.
   Prizel said ``a political statement'' in the form of food aid to
help Soviets get through the winter might shore up President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev or even help induce the kinds of reform that
are necessary.
   But, Prizel said, ``what they need is technical assistance,
everything from entrepreneurial and managerial assistance to
logistical assistance, as well as traditional advice, such as how
to set up a central bank,''
   Gorbachev recently won legislative approval of a compromise plan
for moving from a centrally planned ``command economy'' to one
controlled by market forces. One source said the study provides the
most thorough analysis yet of how colossal a task that will be.
   The Soviet currency, the ruble, is not traded on international
exchanges and its value inside the country is in a free fall; the
price of goods bears little or no relationship to the cost of
production; inflation is accelerating at a pace difficult to
measure; and manufacturing plants are almost universally old,
inefficient and unable to compete in world markets.
   The Soviet Union has no central bank as the institution is
generally understood in the West. The concept of property law is in
its infancy, the work ethic is practically unknown and generally
accepted principles of organizational management are foreign to
most Soviets in managerial positions.
   The most visible result of such pervasive problems is the
widespread shortage of food and consumers goods in major Soviet
cities, but the study considers that merely symptomatic of an
economic system that doesn't work and can't be made to work, the
sources said.
   John Hardt, a specialist on the Soviet economy at the Library of
Congress, said an international assistance program would make sense
if Gorbachev establishes a central banking system and moves to
retain a common currency, common tariffs and control of the
infrastructure and foreign economic policy, ``so foreign investors
know who they're dealing with.''
   However, he said, any aid program should be conditioned on the
Soviets' imposing basic economic stabilization measures, which are
threatened by fractious political forces demanding that the
constituent republics set up their own independent economies.
   President Bush's proposal last week to give the Soviets a
``special association'' status in the IMF and World Bank paved the
way for giving technical assistance and training without immediate
economic aid.
   The new category would be short of full membership, which the
Soviets are seeking and which would be required before they could
receive institutional assistance.
   One official also said the study would ``go a long way to
defining the size of their economy.''
   Western analysts say the Soviet Union ranks anywhere from No. 2
in the world to a mere 3 or 4 percent of the world economy,
depending on how gross national product is measured.
   ``When you provide assistance to a country to help restructure
its domestic economy, you have to make sure there is a domestic
economy, that it has some ability to absorb the assistance and some
ability to do the kinds of fundamental economic things that are
necessary, like price liberalization,'' the source said.
   Asked about growing political pressure in the West to ship food
and medical aid to relieve shortages and buttress the Gorbachev
regime, one IMF source said:
   ``Humanitarian assistance is really quite different from
economic assistance. ... That is the kind of assistance that just
buys time until the leaves come back on the trees. The kind of
assistance they need is far more than that.''

<TEXT>
   The European Community's
lifting of its ban on new investment in South Africa shows the
West's growing faith in President F.W. de Klerk's pledge to end
apartheid.
   The weekend move by EC leaders in Rome marked the first major
reversal of international sanctions, which have been used as a
punitive measure against South Africa's institutionalized racism.
   The decision came despite African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela's urging that the EC delay a decision. The ANC, the
country's leading black opposition group, reaffirmed its support
for sanctions hours before the Europeans acted.
   ``More important than the immediate ending of the investment
embargo ... is the psychological lift the EC statement has given
President de Klerk,'' the country's leading finanicial daily,
Business Day, said Monday.
   ``While opposition to apartheid remains, European governments
have decided that the best way to end it is by supporting de
Klerk's initiatives rather than the ANC's hard line,'' it said.
   In ending the non-binding investment ban, the EC praised de
Klerk's reforms that so far have eliminated some apartheid laws,
legalized banned opposition groups and freed Mandela from prison
after 27 years.
   Still in place, though, are EC bans on importing iron, steel and
gold coins from South Africa and exporting military hardware to the
white-led government.
   The EC said it would consider lifting the remaining sanctions
when South Africa eliminates the Group Areas Act and the Land Acts
- laws that segregate neighborhoods by race and reserve most of the
country for whites.
   The community also said it would require progress on the return
and resettlement of the estimated 20,000 South African political
exiles.
   De Klerk has pledged to meet the demands. He also has promised
to negotiate a new constitution that would give political power to
the black majority.
   Under the apartheid system of racial segregation, the 5 million
whites control the government and economy, and the 30 million
blacks have no national voting rights.
   Additional tougher sanctions by the United States remain intact,
but President Bush has called de Klerk's reforms ``irreversible.''
   Sports and cultural boycotts by a variety of international
bodies are under review and could be revoked within the next year.
   EC members Britain, Germany and France rank among South Africa's
major trading partners, along with the United States, Japan and
Taiwan.
   Few expect fresh foreign investment to pour in because of the EC
action. Chronic fighting between black factions and the uncertain
political climate make investors wary.
   ``Even with the departure of sanctions ... investment will still
not come back in the significant amounts we all hope for unless we
can have developed by that time a culture of dialogue and
understanding and put an end to the unprecedented large-scale
violence,'' U.S. Ambassador William Swing said after the European
decision.
   South Africa's economy is the strongest in Africa, but has been
in a mild recession for a year. Although sanctions are not the main
cause, the punitive measures have stunted growth and increased
unemployment.
   But the economy has proved to be relatively resilient.
   Trade figures released Monday showed the country's overall trade
surplus for the first 11 months of 1990 exceeded the figure for the
same period last year.
   South Africa has traded in private with black African states
that oppose apartheid, and this year has signed trade agreements
with several East European countries that previously rejected
contacts.
   When the United Nations imposed an arms embargo on South Africa
in 1976, the country imported virtually all its weapons. It
developed its own weapons-making industry and now is one of the
world's 10 largest arms exporters.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Supporters of a charismatic,
leftist priest took to the streets today to dance and cheer in
anticipation of his election victory. Police fired into one crowd,
killing a pregnant woman, witnesses said.
   The reported violence occurred as the people of this poor
Caribbean nation awaited official results from Sunday's balloting
for what could be the first freely elected government in Haiti's
turbulent 186-year history.
   The witnesses said six policemen firing from a moving pickup
truck shot at hundreds of people singing a patriotic song outside
the gutted remains of the Saint Jean Bosco Church in the La Salines
slum of the capital.
   One witness, photographer Lannis Waters of the Palm Beach (Fla.)
Post, said the truck ran over the slain woman's body. He said
people panicked and ran for cover. Waters said it was not clear why
the police fired.
   In September 1988, the priest-candidate, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, escaped unharmed when thugs armed with machetes, knives
and pikes attacked the same church during Mass, killing 12
parishioners and wounding 70 others.
   The assailants burned the church to the ground.
   No other violence was immediately reported today in Haiti, where
the presidential and legislative election had been conducted
peacefully on Sunday.
   ``I think it was a very democratic election, a very open
election,'' Joao de Medicis of Brazil, head of a U.N. observation
team and a representative of U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, said earlier today.
   De Medicis told reporters there were some voting irregularities
``but in our opinion, these irregularities did not affect the
results.'' He did not elaborate on the irregularities or results.
   In Washington, the State Department praised the ``peaceful and
orderly'' conduct of elections in Haiti and urged all parties to
respect the official results when they are announced.
   No official figures were expected to be available until later
today, but the consensus of some politicians and observers, based
on partial returns and talks with election officials, was that
Aristide would win a clear majority.
   Haitians also seemed sure the priest would be their next
president.
   Thousands of people poured into the streets, dancing and
singing, ``Aristide, President!'' and shouting, ``Now the people
have power!'' They waved posters with Aristide's picture and green
branches, the traditional Haitian symbol of celebration.
   The celebrants filled the streets, blocking traffic, waving
posters with Aristide's picture and green branches, the traditional
Haitian symbol of celebration. People riding atop brightly painted
``tap-tap'' mini-buses waved their arms and sang.
   Shops were closed in the capital, Port-au-Prince, this morning
as people observed an official Election Day holiday and waited for
the official returns. Local radio and television stations were
barred by law from broadcasting partial results. Some stations got
around the embargo by relaying foreign shortwave radio broadcasts
speculating that Aristide had won.
   ``We've won. They couldn't steal our election from us,'' said
Pierre Merveille, a 42-year-old bus driver and Aristide supporter.
   The international airport reopened today to arriving flights,
which had been canceled on Sunday in case of disturbances.
   The election was hampered by delays in the delivery of ballots
and the opening of poll booths that kept hundreds of voters
simmering in long lines under the sun, and leading some to charge
fraud.
   The new government will replace the caretaker administration of
President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, a Supreme Court justice appointed
in March.
   Marc Bazin, 58-year-old former World Bank economist seen as the
favorite by the U.S. Embassy and the business community, was
considered Aristide's top rival among his 10 opponents.
   If no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote, a runoff will be
held Jan. 20.
   More than 800 international observers were on hand, seeking to
assure violence-free balloting. A November 1987 election was
thwarted after 34 voters were shot or hacked to death by thugs
backed by the army.
   The observers praised the behavior of the army and police, who
kept order and patrolled streets at a discreet distance from
polling stations.
   ``This time the army has been equal to its task,'' said Jean
Robert Sabalat, president of the Electoral Council. ``We have just
lived together a great day in our history.''
   About 3 million voters, 85 percent of the electorate, were
registered to vote. The turnout wasn't known, but was thought to be
high.
   Aristide, a 37-year-old firebrand who told the poor they were
following God's will to fight for their rights, was one of 11
candidates for president. Haitians also were electing a 110-member
National Assembly and local officials.
   A popular uprising overthrew Jean-Claude Duvalier in 1986,
ending the repressive dictatorship that began when ``Papa Doc''
Francois Duvalier assumed office in 1957. But Haiti has since
witnessed a series of coups and failed elections amid a climate of
terror fostered by former members of the Duvalier family militia,
the Tonton Macoutes.
   Thugs attacked an Aristide rally Dec. 5 with grenades and
gunfire, killing seven people and wounding more than 50.
   Observers from the United Nations, Organization of American
States and other groups monitored the vote.
   Aristide, expelled from his religious order for allegedly
inciting class hatred, has said he would renounce the priesthood if
elected, complying with a Vatican policy that priests can't hold
public office.

<HEAD>Former Security Officials Say Military Action Should Not Be
Delayed</HEAD>

   Fourteen former government officials,
including top national security experts, cautioned on Monday
against delaying military action in the Persian Gulf much beyond
the Jan. 15 U.N. deadline set for the withdrawal of Iraqi forces
from Kuwait.
   Adm. William J. Moorer, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said war in the Persian Gulf ``is certainly probable'' but
``is not totally certain.''
   ``I think the debate is primarily about when it will become
necessary rather than whether,'' Moorer said.
   The retired admiral joined Robert F. Ellsworth, a former deputy
secretary of defense, in releasing a letter that they and 12 other
former civilian and military officials sent to Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz.
   The letter urged Aziz to advise Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
that the signers oppose demands in Congress for continued reliance
on sanctions.
   ``Such misguided views should not stand in the way of the use of
all necessary means'' to enforce the deadline, the signers said.
   If Iraq does not unconditionally withdraw from Kuwait by Jan.
15, they said, ``we do not believe it wise or in the interest of
international security to delay the use of all necessary means much
beyond that date.''
   Ellsworth, a former Republican congressman from Kansas, said
that ``the calls for letting the sanctions work for six months, for
12 months - some congressional leaders have even called for 24
months - simply play into Saddam Hussein's hands.''
   ``Saddam Hussein will not respond to anything except a credible
threat of immediate military action. That's what will move him out
of Kuwait,'' Ellsworth said.
   Moorer told reporters, ``I don't think we can just sit forever
and rely totally on sanctions.''
   The letter expressed support of President Bush and the U.N.
Security Council in ``requiring Iraq's immediate, complete and
unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait.''
   Others signing the letter were Richard V. Allen and Robert C.
McFarlane, both of whom served as national security advisers to
former President Reagan; Thomas C. Reed, former secretary of the
Air Force; John F. Lehman, former secretary of the Navy; Retired
Gen. P.X. Kelly, former commandant of the Marine Corps; Retired
Vice Adm. John J. Shanahan, former commander of the U.S. 2nd Fleet;
Retired Brig. Gen. James D. Hittle, former assistant secretary of
the Navy; retired Brig. Gen. Hugh S. Aitken, former deputy director
of joint plans for the Marine Corps; Robert H. Knight, former
chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Robert D.
Blackwill, former special assistant to the president for national
security affairs; Roland A. Paul, former counsel of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee; and William J. Taylor, former director
for national security studies of the U.S. Military Academy.

   President Bush today chose former Tennessee
Gov. Lamar Alexander, who has been active in education reform, to
fill the post of education secretary vacated last week when Lauro
Cavazos was forced to resign.
   Meanwhile the adminstration signaled it may be backing away from
a controversial Education Department edict that race-based minority
scholarships are illegal. White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said Bush was ``very disturbed'' about the ruling.
   ``No governor in the country is so clearly identified with the
movement to improve education,'' Bush said in presenting Alexander.
He described the nominee as being ``at the forefront of the
movement to restructure our nation's schools.''
   Alexander has long been a national leader in education reform.
He left the Tennessee governor's office in 1986 after two terms and
has been president of the University of Tennessee the past three
years.
   A Republican, Alexander has been president of the University of
Tennessee for the past three years. He was governor of Tennessee
from 1978-86.
   While governor, he pushed for education reform and instituted
his ``master teacher plan.'' That plan gave teachers higher pay
based on education levels and performance.
   On the subject of race-based scholarships, Fitzwater said Bush
has ordered the Education Department to conduct a quick review,
with advice from the Justice Department and White House lawyers.
   Bush ``believes these scholarships are important to minorities
and to ensuring opportunities for all Americans to get a good
education,'' the spokesman said.
   Alexander said, ``We have scholarships for minority students who
are poor at the University of Tennessee'' and they have proved
useful in helping poor students get an education.
   ``It's ultimately a constitutional question and we'll try to
assure the students that under any reasonable set of circumstances,
those who now have scholarships shouldn't be in fear of those,''
Alexander said.
   Robert Atwell, president of the American Council on Education,
called the naming of Alexander ``the most positive signal we could
have gotten that the president really wants to be the education
president.'' The council is a Washington-based lobby representing
some 1800 institutions of higher learning.
   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, said he was optimistic that Alexander, as a former
governor, could bring to the department some of the dynamism that
critics said it lacked under Cavazos.
   ``I'm hopeful,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``...I doubt
very much he'd take the position unless there was that kind of
expectation.''
   Bush made the Alexander announcement at a morning meeting with
reporters at which he also introduced his new labor secretary,
outgoing Rep. Lynn Martin. Bush announced the Martin choice Friday,
while she was home in Illinois.
   Still open is the top job at the Republican National Committee,
vacant anew because of last week's surprise withdrawal by William
Bennett.
   Cavazos was viewed by his critics within the administration as
passive and ineffectual; Alexander, as Tennessee governor and
president of the National Governors Association, has been an
aggressive advocate for education and has the television skills
Cavazos was often criticized for lacking.
   Alexander said his priorities will be to improve schools for the
nation's children and training and adult education opportunities
for American workers who need new skills for the changing
workplace.
   Alexander said that when Tennessee was looking for workers for a
new General Motors plant families considering the move would ask
two questions.
   ``The second question is, `Where can I get good schools for my
children?' and the first question is, `Where can I go back to
school?'''
   Alexander told Bush: `I appreciate and am grateful for the
chance to do this.''
   Of Martin, Bush said: ``Working Americans have a friend in Lynn
Martin. She understands the challenges facing our workforce.''
   The Martin and Alexander appointments are all but certain to win
confirmation on Capitol Hill. Both will have to go before the
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, probably in January.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the committee chairman, said
Alexander ``has a distinguished record in education and earned
bipartisan respect for his role in stimulating education reform in
the states.''
   School reform ``cannot succeed without strong federal
leadership,'' said Kennedy, who added that he will use the
confirmation hearing to explore Alexander's views ``on the proper
role of Congress and the president.''
   The moves also fill the Cabinet, for now.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner is among those being
considered for the chairman's post at the Republican National
Committee, a post Bush is expected to fill soon.
   Bush had been expected to fill the education post quickly
because of criticism the administration received for the way
Cavazos was forced to resign. Cavazos, the first Hispanic American
to serve in the Cabinet, was not on hand for the announcement he
was leaving the Cabinet, as is the customary practice.
   Bush made no reference to Cavazos as he introduced Alexander.
   Other candidates for the education post had included Hawaii Rep.
Pat Saiki, who like Martin lost a Senate race, and Lynne Cheney,
chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities and wife of
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.

   Mortgage delinquencies rose sharply from July
through September, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Monday in
a report it said was further proof the economy is in a downturn.
   ``Overall delinquency rates are essentially the same as a year
ago,'' Executive Vice President Warren Lasko said. ``But following
a dip earlier this year, we now see a significant upward movement
in all categories of delinquencies.
   ``Unfortunately, in the context of higher unemployment rates and
a decline in home price appreciation, we may be looking at further
evidence that a recession is upon us,'' he added.
   Indeed, the association report said it ``would not be surprising
for delinquency rates to stay at the higher levels of the third
quarter and perhaps to even drift up a bit more, given the state of
the economy, particularly in the New England states.''
   The association survey found the delinquency rate was 5.0
percent, up from 4.52 percent in the second quarter and 4.41
percent in the first. The rate in the third quarter of 1989 was
4.96 percent.
   The survey also found that foreclosures had risen slightly. The
0.33 percent rate compared with a 0.31 percent rate in the previous
quarter.
   Contributing most to the delinquency increase were mortgages
30-days past due. This category, which provides the least concern,
rose from 3.13 percent in the second quarter to 3.47 percent in the
third.
   But mortgages with 60-day delinquencies increased from 0.70
percent to 0.78 percent while those that were 90-day late rose from
0.69 percent to 0.75 percent.
   ``On a regional basis, delinquency rates were higher in the
Northeast and South, but were lower in the Midwest and West
compared to year-ago levels, the report said. ``During the same
time period, the percentage of loans in foreclosure fell in the
Midwest and West, but rose in the Northeast and South.
   The rate of late installments in the northeastern states rose to
4.48 percent in the third quarter of 1990 from 4.34 percent in the
same period of last year. Loans under foreclosure advanced from
0.70 percent in the third quarter of last year to 0.87 percent from
July through September.
   The delinquency rate in the South moved upfrom a year-ago level
of 5.53 percent to 5.86 percent this year. Foreclosures rose from
1.09 percent last year to 1.15 percent in 1990.
   In the North Central region, the delinquency rate fell to 5.00
percent from 5.13 percent. Loans in foreclosure fell from 0.98
percent to 0.92 percent.
   Delinquencies in the West dropped from a 4.08 percent rate in
the third quarter of 1989 to 3.98 percent from July through
September, while the foreclosure rate fell from 1.14 percent last
year to 0.74 percent.
   The survey covered 15.5 million loans on one- to four-unit
properties, about one-third of all residential mortgage loans in
the United States.

   Joanne Woodward says her superstar husband Paul
Newman once toyed with the idea of running for political office but
the roar of a race car got in the way.
   ``He could have been a serious candidate. But then he got
involved in racing,'' Woodward said in an interview with the couple
in the January issue of McCall's magazine. Looking at Newman, she
added: ``A mind is a terrible thing to waste on a Trans Am motor.''
   Woodward and Newman have acted together in nine films from ``The
Long Hot Summer'' in 1958 to the newly released ``Mr. and Mrs.
Bridge.'' Asked if their acting style has changed in 32 years
between the films, Woodward replied:
   ``Oh yes. In the beginning, we played off of each other purely
by lust.''
   Newman added: ``Joanne gives great smolder.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Four-time Grammy winner Olivia Newton-John
says she may return to the recording studio next year to put
together a greatest hits album.
   But the 42-year-old entertainer says she has no desire to resume
a full-time career. Newton-John, who recently acted in the
television movie ``A Mom for Christmas,'' says she prefers quiet
family life.
   ``I could take or leave performing. I enjoy it, but it's not the
be-all and end-all,'' she said.
   In ``A Mom for Christmas,'' Newton-John portrays a department
store mannequin that comes to life to fulfill the wish of a
motherless child.
   Newton-John's career has been on hold since two films,
``Xanadu'' and ``Two of a Kind,'' flopped in the early 1980s. But
Newton-John says she's been busy caring for her 4-year-old
daughter, Chloe.
   She is a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations' Environment
Programme and a member of the board of the Earth Communications
Office. Newton-John also is active with Mothers and Others for a
Livable Planet.

   BLOOMFIELD, Conn. (AP) - Pop-star Michael Bolton didn't sing,
but he thrilled a crowd planning a local charity event when he
showed up with a load of toys for needy children.
   The Grammy award-winning singer and songwriter was greeted with
cheers and screams from an audience of about 500 Sunday at an event
to recruit volunteers for the sixth annual ``We Are The Children
Christmas Party'' organized by WTIC-FM disc jockey Gary Craig.
   Bolton, a New Haven native, won a 1989 Grammy award for best pop
vocal album, and has written songs for Barbra Streisand, Laura
Branigan and Conway Twitty.
   Bolton spoke briefly, praising the volunteers and those who
donated toys as the price of admission to see him. He answered
questions from the audience, signed autographs and had his picture
taken with a long line of fans.

   NEW ORLEANS (AP) - Actor Robert Carradine, in New Orleans doing
a movie for HBO, is spending his spare time riding around in police
cars, picking up pointers for his role as a drug enforcement agent
in ``The Barry Seal Story.''
   This isn't the first time he's gone out of his way to get a feel
for a character. When filming ``Revenge of the Nerds,'' released in
1984, he said he wore nerd clothes, wig and glasses everywhere he
went for two weeks before filming began.
   While in character, he and another actor went to fraternity row
at the University of Arizona for rush week and asked the head of
one fraternity if they could join.
   ``The guy took one look at us and said `no way,''' he said. ``By
the time the first day of shooting rolled around, I was in full
flight as a nerd.''

   All-time baseball hitting leader Pete
Rose will move to Florida to start a new life sometime after he
completes his federal prison sentence for cheating on his taxes,
his manager and close friends say.
   Rose, 49, is serving a five-month sentence at a federal prison
in Marion, Ill., for failing to report income on his tax returns
and is scheduled for release Jan. 7. He also must spend an
additional three months in a halfway house and perform 1,000 hours
of community service in Cincinnati.
   ``He wants to get his life together, but that will be whenever
he is done serving his time,'' Rose's manager Bill Hayes told the
Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel for Monday's editions. Rose ``is
trying to start fresh in Florida.''
   Rose's friends say they will try to get him to work with youths
in Boca Raton when he moves with his wife, Carol, and their
5-year-old son Tyler.
   Rose, former manager of the Cincinnati Reds, is barred from
baseball.

<TEXT>
   When rumors circulated in the Pentagon a few
weeks ago that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney might reduce the
purchase order for the Navy's futuristic A-12 ``stealth'' warplane,
few imagined that the new number might be zero.
   The A-12 may yet get built, but its prospects dimmed greatly
last Friday when Cheney told Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett
that he would cancel the $50 billion project on Jan. 4 unless the
Navy could ``show cause'' why it should be salvaged.
   ``The A-12 program is in serious trouble,'' Cheney wrote in a
memorandum to Garrett. ``The apparent schedule slippages, cost
growth and management deficiencies in this program are intolerable.
If we cannot spend the taxpayers' money wisely, we will not spend
it.''
   Cheney's blunt words underscore how far the A-12's fortunes have
fallen this year.
   Less than eight months ago Cheney was telling Congress that a
high-level Pentagon review had given the A-12 a clean bill of
health and that the Navy was on track to begin fielding the first
of 620 A-12s on schedule and within budget.
   A few weeks later the contractors - McDonnell Douglas Corp. and
General Dynamics Corp. - disclosed that they were far behind
schedule and far above budget. They also raised doubts about their
ability to build the plane to specifications.
   Two weeks ago, an internal Navy report on the A-12 program
concluded that the contractors and Navy managers failed to fully
advise top Pentagon officials of cost overruns and the likelihood
of delays in building the prototypes. In response, Garrett sacked
the three-star admiral in charge of Navy aviation programs, and he
reprimanded two other uniformed officers involved.
   The A-12 episode is all the more remarkable for the national
security interests at stake.
   The Navy has no known alternative to the new aircraft, called
the Avenger, which has been scheduled to begin replacing the A-6
Intruder attack plane in the mid-1990s and to serve as the main
carrier-based bomber well into the 21st century.
   Cheney alluded to this in his note to Garrett.
   ``We will continue to need to develop a basic strike airplane
for our aircraft carrier force,'' Cheney wrote, because the A-6
fleet is too old, too slow and lacks the technology ``necessary to
maintain U.S. naval air superiority.''
   The A-6s, some of which currently are deployed in the Persian
Gulf crisis, have been in service for nearly 30 years. The aircraft
was used, along with Air Force F-111 fighter-bombers, in the April
1986 American bombing raid on Libya.
   Little is known about the capabilities of the A-12 Avenger
because it is highly classified.
   Cheney, in his memo to Garrett, seemed to be indicating that the
Avenger must go ahead, but that he wants a major shakeup in the
project's management. One possible outcome is that the $4.8 billion
McDonnell Douglas-General Dynamics contract for building Avenger
prototypes would be rewritten to give the companies more time to
overcome the technical problems they have encountered.
   That probably would mean the Avenger would not enter service
until late in this decade, or possibly later.
   It also is possible that the Pentagon will decide to buy far
fewer of the planes than the 620 now planned. Fewer may be needed
if, as seems likely, the aircraft carrier fleet is reduced from the
current 14 in response to budget pressures and the end of the Cold
War.
   McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics are expected to formally
ask the Pentagon soon to restructure the Avenger contract to
account for unanticipated costs.

<HEAD>Accord Could Double Emigration of Ethiopian Jews</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Marxist government of Ethiopia has reached
an agreement with the United States and Israel to more than double
the number of Jews it allows to emigrate, officials said Monday.
   The Ethiopian government is being rewarded with Israeli aid and
a thaw in relations with Washington, which have been strained for
over a decade, said the officials who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
   Under the agreement, reached last month in the Ethiopian capital
of Addis Ababa, President Haile Mengistu Mariam will allow up to
1,000 Jews to leave for Israel every month, said the officials.
   A previous agreement, negotiated by Israel last year after it
resumed diplomatic ties with Ethiopia, allowed 400-500 to leave
every month but was violated by Mengistu last summer. From July
through October, no Jews were allowed to leave.
   Israeli and U.S. officials estimate some 20,000 Jews are
stranded in Addis Ababa, after trekking there from their homes in
northern Ethiopia to escape famine and civil war and await flights
to Israel. Activists in Israel claim some 250 of their brethren
have died of disease and hunger while waiting.
   Ethiopian Jews, who trace their lineage to Biblical times, lived
in isolation from mainstream Jewish life for over 2,000 years. In
1984, Israel launched a secret airlift with U.S. support to rescue
them.
   Some 8,000 were evacuated before Operation Moses became public,
causing the government of Ethiopia to block further departures.
   Israel had been trying to resume the Jewish emigration, and a
breakthrough was made when Ethiopia agreed to re-establish
diplomatic ties which it broke in 1973 in solidarity with the
Arabs.
   But Mengistu wanted Israel to supply him with weapons against
the Eritrean rebels who have been trying to unseat him for some 30
years. U.S. congressmen say Mengistu wanted Israel to sell him
cluser bombs.
   Israel says it refused because the weapons are manufactured with
U.S. technology and the administration refused to allow such sales
to Ethiopia.
   Instead, Israel provided Ethiopia with some light weapons -
mainly old rifles - and agricultural and technological aid.
   It also interceded with the United States to urge that
Washington improve relations with Mengistu, said one official.
   The Israeli efforts were aided by the administration's desire
for Ethiopian support for a U.N. Security Council resolution
authorizing use of force against Iraq. Secretary of State James
Baker met with Ethiopian Foreign Minister Dinka Tesfaye last month
at the United Nations to solicit his support as a member of the
15-nation Security Council.
   Two weeks earlier, Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen
traveled to Addis Ababa, primarily to participate in a joint
meeting with Ethiopian and Israeli officials regarding Jewish
emigration, the State Department said.
   His trip ``was intended to encourage progress on this issue and
to make clear that we will not be satisfied until all Ethiopian
Jews who wish to leave Ethiopia can do so,'' said a statement
issued by the department.
   U.S. officials said the administration had received promises
from Israel and Ethiopia that emigration would not be linked with
any arms sales to Ethiopia.
   The administration still wants Ethiopia to improve its human
rights record, to allow international relief shipments to prevent
famine, and to negotiate in good faith with the rebels about ending
the civil war.
   Rebel and government representatives were brought together under
U.S. auspices in Washington two months ago, but failed to make real
progress.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
said Monday that Saddam Hussein may withdraw some Iraqi troops from
Kuwait by Jan. 15 in a ploy to divide the alliance against Iraq.
   He urged foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization to stand firm against any Iraqi tactics and resist
partial solutions to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``We need to anticipate Saddam's possible moves, be prepared for
a partial withdrawal ploy and coordinate closely our responses,''
Baker said at the start of a two-day meeting of the 16-nation North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Baker said he was willing to go to Baghdad for talks with Saddam
on any day from Dec. 20 through Jan. 3. Iraq has suggested Jan. 12
for the talks, just three days before the deadline set in a U.N.
resolution authorizing the use of force to drive Iraq from Kuwait.
   ``If ... Saddam Hussein is not willing to see me on any one of
15 dates, he is telling all of us that he's interested not in
communication but manipulation,'' Baker said.
   ``We are willing to communicate, but not to play Saddam's games.
And no one else should either,'' he told his counterparts in a text
made available to reporters.
   At the end of the day's talks, the ministers released a
statement reaffirming their resolve to see the Iraqi invaders out
of Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   ``The responsibility now lies with the government of Iraq to
ensure peace by complying fully with the mandatory United Nations
decisions,'' said the NATO statement.
   It said complete Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and restoration of
its legitimate government ``are unequivocal conditions for a
peaceful solution.''
   ``There can be no partial solutions,'' the statement said.
   Baker cautioned the ministers that as the mid-January deadline
approaches, they should expect Saddam ``to try to undercut the
collective will of the international community to use force.''
   ``Just as I believe he chose to release hostages for this
purpose, I think he may take a dramatic step on or around Jan.
15,'' he said. ``He could withdraw partially.''
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd urged Saddam to dismiss
any thoughts of dividing the coalition against his Aug. 2 seizure
of Kuwait.
   He said the NATO statement, as well as one issued during the
weekend by the 12-nation European Community, underscored Western
unity.
   ``All this should be mounting evidence for Iraq that there is no
point in staying in Kuwait in the hope that somehow the coalition
is about to split,'' he said.
   ``It is very important from the point of view of looking for
peaceful solutions that the Iraqis should not deceive themselves in
the next few weeks,'' he said.
   ``We have not decided to go to war, (but) we are running out of
time,'' said Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens. ``The choice
between peace and war is in the hands of Iraq.''
   Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis said the European
Community would decide Tuesday whether to meet this week with
Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz.
   The EC had asked De Michelis to meet in Rome with Aziz after he
went to Washington for talks with President Bush. But Aziz's
meeting with Bush, scheduled for Monday, was canceled.
   Baker called on the allies to shoulder more of the costs of the
gulf operation in light of increased U.S. troop deployments. By
mid-January, the United States will have more than 400,000 troops
in the gulf region.
   ``It means significant new economic burdens for us,'' he said.
``And it means real risks and real sacrifices by the American
people.''
   Among NATO nations, Only France and Britain have sent
substantial military forces to the gulf region. Other nations have
provided ships and planes to ferry soldiers and equipment, and
still others have contributed money.

   Friends and families of hostages in Lebanon
held a church vigil Monday and asked Americans to pray for the
captives during the holiday season.
   ``We have a burning desire to see our loved ones returned to us
soon,'' said Thomas Cicippio of Norristown, Pa., the brother of
Joseph Cicippio, who was abducted Jan. 24, 1987.
   ``Here we are once again into the Christmas season,'' he said.
   If he were a hostage, Cicippio said he would be praying for help
from President Bush. Cicippio said his message would be: ``Mr.
President, my ame is Terry Anderson. Do you remember me? My
freedom was taken away 2,103 days ago.''
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest held of the American hostages. He was
captured March 16, 1985, and is spending his sixth Christmas in
captivity.
   ``Those who hold Terry and the other Western hostages can serve
their interests by freeing them now,'' said Walter Mears, vice
president of the AP.
   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say of Cadiz, Ky., said in a letter
read at the ceremony: ``Our prayers are for peace in the Middle
East.''
   Mrs. Say compared the hundreds of American hostages who have
been released by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein with the Americans
in Lebanon.
   The Iraqi situation ``shows what can be accomplished with the
full attention of national leadership,'' she said, adding that
similar attention should be focused on hostages in Lebanon.
   Last week, Mrs. Say said she planned to go to Lebanon in January
in an effort to find her brother.
   She said the State Department had discouraged the trip, but
``this is a private initiative ... born of frustration and
desperation and fear that Terry may not survive much longer.''
   The four other Americans being held in Lebanon are Thomas
Sutherland, Edward Austin Tracy, Alann Steen and Jesse Jonathan
Turner.
   The hostages are thought to be held by pro-Iranian Islamic
Shiites in the southern suburbs of Beirut. In recent weeks, calm
has been restored in the war-torn city as the Syrians have
consolidated their hold on the country.
   Former hostage Robert Polhill and Bruce Laingen, a former U.S.
diplomat who was held hostage in Iran a decade ago, lighted candles
at the ceremony sponsored by No Greater Love, a group that helps
victims of war and their families.

   William Barker wasn't in the car with
Shelley Watkins when he proposed marriage to her. But she got the
point. She could hardly miss it.
   Watkins was on her way home from work last Thursda night when
she saw the billboard near a shopping mall in the Pittsburgh
suburbs: ``Shelley, I love you. Will you marry me? Love, Bill.
143.''
   ``I nearly wrecked!'' she said.
   She called Barker from a pay phone in the shopping center
parking lot.
   ``She said, `I will! I will! I will!''' said Barker, 32. ``She
was crying and a woman came up behind her and asked her what's
wrong. Shelley told her and they both started crying.''
   Barker said 143 is a code he devised to tell Miss Watkins he
loved her while the two worked at a country club.
   ``One is for the number of letters in the word `I,' 4 is for
`love,' and 3 is for `you.' ''
   The public show of affection will be up for another two weeks,
said a salesman at Gateway Outdoor Advertising. Then a second sign
may go up saying ``She said yes,'' said George Pastor, vice
president at Gateway, who sold the space.
   Watkins and Barker plan to marry Aug. 31.

   President Bush today demanded that Iraq
completely withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15 and vowed there will be
``no concession, no negotiation for one inch of territory.''
   ``He has got to leave without condition,'' Bush said after
meeting with representatives of 28 countries that have contributed
money or troops for the international standoff against Iraq.
   ``None of us wants war but none of us is prepared to accept a
partial solution,'' the president said.
   Bush said Saddam Hussein should pay attention to the buildup of
military force against him and ``draw the conclusion he ought to
get out without concession.'' The United States alone is committed
to sending upwards of 430,000 troops to the Persian Gulf.

   Lena Olin was a tomboy. She didn't want to be
pretty. She cut her hair short and refused to wear dresses. She
preferred sports to dolls and fighting to tea parties.
   She changed once she turned 13 - no one who's seen ``The
Unbearable Lightness of Being'' and ``Enemies, A Love Story'' would
question that. But watch those films, the way she uncorks a wine
bottle with her teeth or the erotic tension between Olin and other
women and you'll see a masculine spirit that runs much deeper than
a bowler hat.
   And she hasn't stopped looking for new ways to bring that
quality into her professional life. As a Swedish actress, she's
been compared to Garbo, but when Olin speaks of tackling classic
roles it's not only ``Camille'' that's on her mind.
   ``One of my first stage parts was in a comedy called `Able
Drugger,' an English comedy,'' Olin, dressed in jeans and a simple,
white blouse, recalled in a recent interview. ``I played a man and
I enjoyed that. I very much would like to play a man. I'd like to
do `Hamlet.'''
   Hamlet is a tragic male, incapable of making up his mind. But
Olin might be too tough as the Danish prince. Her characters -
Sabina in ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' and Masha in
``Enemies, A Love Story'' - are erotic cynics: intelligent,
complex, highly sexual, painfully self-aware.
   There's something otherwordly about them; they're objects of
desire yet very much alone. They make their own rules. Fair play no
longer matters; they've been hurt too often.
   Sabina is an avant-garde artist living in Czechoslovakia during
the 1968 uprising, a free spirit in an oppressed country, the
mistress of a seductive doctor who can make tugging a curtain seem
pornographic. Masha, for which Olin received an Academy Award
nomination for best supporting actress, is an embittered Holocaust
survivor, a force of life but an even stronger force of death.
   In ``Havana,'' her new film, Olin plays Roberta Duran, a Swede
trapped in a ``Casablanca''-like love triangle, torn between
American playboy-gambler Robert Redford and Cuban revolutionary
Raul Julia. Roberta - or Bobbi as she's called - is somewhat softer
than Masha or Sabina. She's more passive, easier to manipulate and,
for Olin, an easier person to like.
   ``Sabina's so bored with life, so fed up with life,'' Olin said.
``And Masha's so distraught. She was hard to live with. I like to
be able to close the door to the studio, but it's very difficult
with some characters. I also felt very vulnerable when I did Bobbi.
I wanted to be good when I did Bobbi, and I kept that with me.
   ``Masha was very hard to come back to every night, to sleep with
every night. You touch areas in yourself that I don't think are
very healthy to touch.''
   Olin, 35, was born in Stockholm. Her parents were actors, her
father, Stij Olin, appearing in Ingmar Bergman's classic ``The
Seventh Seal.'' But they divorced when she was little and for all
her all spirit, she remembered herself as self-conscious and
insecure, more at home with inner thoughts than with the outside
world.
   ``I was a weird child and I still see things differently,'' she
recalled in a soft voice, smiling shyly. ``I always remember very
strange things. I have a capacity to walk in an apartment where
there are boxes and papers, and someone will say, `Excuse the boxes
and papers.' And I'll say, `Oh, I didn't see that.' I think I
concentrate on other things, small things that can be revealing.''
   Acting was the perfect way to express herself, and at age 20
Olin entered the Royal Dramatic Theater School, joining Bergman's
famed company of players. On stage, she starred in the plays of
Shakespeare, Strindberg and Chekhov and she also worked with
Bergman on films, appearing in ``After the Rehearsal'' and ``Fanny
and Alexander.''
   Olin sees nothing peculiar or silly about her tomboy roots. It
was a phase to build upon rather than outgrow, a yearning to be in
touch with all sides of herself, a rebellion against the rules that
men and women are supposed to obey that went beyond mere
role-playing.
   ``If I ever had a daughter I'd bring her up the same way,
encourage her to do what I did,'' said Olin, a single mother whose
son, August, is named after Strindberg.
   ``I think it's important for everyone to stay open, not to be
afraid, and if you push that way, I think that makes a difference
for an actor. The great thing about Marlon Brando, he's very macho
and all of that, but there's a huge woman in there as well.''

   Bush said he still is willing to meet with Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz on the crisis if mutually acceptable dates can
be arranged for that meeting and a reciprocal meeting between
Secretary of tate James A. Baker III and Saddam in Baghdad.
   ``I'm not in a threatening mode,'' Bush said. ``I don't think
any of us are. We're in a determined mode. A mode that he should
get out. ... And he's got to understand it. So we keep on repeating
it: no negotiation for one inch of territory.
   ``And Mr. Saddam Hussein, you simply do what the world is
calling upon you to do. Get out.''
   Bush made much the same point earlier at a news conference,
insisting that Iraqi forces must be out of Kuwait by Jan. 15.

   A smiling man told a woman at a children's
home he had car trouble and needed to make a phone call. Once
inside, he pulled a gun and fled with about $75 and an employee's
car, police said Monday.
   The 19 children at the Fair Haven Children's Home were attending
a Christmas dinner when the robbery occurred Sunday night. No one
was injured.
   The same suspect also apparently broke into two other homes on
the campus and stole small change and other items from the
children, said Jackie Barger, executive director of the home.
   ``The robbery put kind of a damper on the children's evening,''
Barger said. ``The whole campus was worried and upset about it.''
   Children at the private center range in age from 5 to 19, Barger
said. A minister called him Monday and said members of a local
congregation would take a collection to make up for the stolen
money.

<HEAD>Officials Fear Higher Gas Tax Spawning Schemes to Avoid Payment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said Monday it is
investigating 100 schemes to evade gasoline taxes and officials
fear the new, nickel-a-gallon hike in the federal levy will spawn
more fraud.
   ``With the five-cent increase in the gasoline excise tax, we
have no doubt there will be an incentive to cheat,'' said Shirley
D. Peterson, the assistant attorney general who heads the Justice
Department's tax division.
   After the tax hike took effect Dec. 1, an informant told a
government prosecutor that ``the word on the street is `thanks for
the early Christmas present,''' she told reporters.
   The schemes, which cost the federal government at least $1
billion in lost revenue, were initially detected in the mid-1980s
as a way for organized crime to muscle into a legitimate business,
officials said.
   But legitimate businesses are increasingly involved in the
schemes, particularly businesses under the pressure of price
competition in an industry with thin profit margins, officials
said.
   There have been 25 convictions since 1987, Peterson said.
   But the Nov. 16 guilty verdict against Getty Terminals Corp., a
Getty executive and two independent gasoline wholesalers for
scheming to evade $1 million in excise taxes was one of the first
convictions of a legitimate business, she said. The company could
be fined $2 million and individual defendants could be sentenced to
20 years in prison.
   ``If you consider the number of gallons of gasoline sold, you
begin to understand the magnitude of the potential problem and the
temptation to cheat,'' she said. ``There's just enormous, enormous
money to be made by those who are able to find ways to basically
defeat the payment of the tax.''
   With low profit margins, legitimate dealers ``are driven out of
business unless they get on board the criminal activity.''
   Besides trying to recover lost tax revenue, ``we want to make it
possible for the legitimate businessman to carry on his business
without getting creamed by criminal activity,'' she said.
   The 100 investigations of gasoline tax-evasion schemes are being
conducted in 18 cities around the country, Peterson said. Most have
reached the stage of prosecutors submitting evidence to federal
grand juries.
   In addition to the New York City area, the problem is most
evident in Florida, Texas, the Midwest and California, officials
said.
   The sale of gasoline stocks at terminals from one registered
wholesaler to another is exempt from excise taxes.
   But businesses use phony corporations, fake invoices and other
schemes that ``test the perseverance of prosecutors and agents to
go through the mountains and mountains of documents,'' said James
A. Bruton, one of Peterson's deputies.
   Four of the five major organized crime families in the New York
City area - the Gambino, Lucchese, Colombo and Genovese mobs - are
involved in gasoline tax schemes along with groups formed by
Russian emigres, said prosecutor James Rodio.
   ``Anybody involved in the scheme has to pay what is known as the
mob tax - a penny to two cents a gallon,'' Rodio said.
   Earlier this year, a Colombo family ``capo'' pleaded guilty to
extorting money from a Long Island wholesaler, he said.
   Bruton said prosecutors are trying to determine the involvement
of legitimate businesses in most of the transactions under
investigation.
   ``They have the cash normally to start with and the transactions
downstream usually result from them having the cash,'' Bruton said.
``I think its an issue of the degree of their participation and the
degree of their knowledge of what's going on.''

   Martin Scorsese's gangland tale
``GoodFellas'' took top honors from the Los Angeles Film Critics
Association, shutting out ``Dances With Wolves,'' ``The Godfather,
Part III'' and ``Havana.''
   ``GoodFellas,'' which features a cast of colorful Mafiosos who
kill with a morbid sense of humor, was named best picture in voting
Saturday, and Scorsese was tapped as best director.
   Twenty-eight of the association's 36 Los Angeles area print,
radio and television film critic members participated in the
voting.
   Joe Pesci, who plays a neurotic gangster in the film, took best
supporting actor, and Lorraine Bracco won best supporting actress.
   Michael Ballhaus won best cinematography for the movie, which
critics applauded for its eye to detail.
   ``Dances With Wolves,'' Kevin Costner's epic about a Civil War
officer's relationship with Sioux Indians, came in a close second
in several categories but didn't win anything, according to Copley
Newspapers film critic Jerry Roberts.
   Francis Ford Coppola's latest ``Godfather'' film and Sydney
Pollack's ``Havana'' were neither winners nor runners-up in any
category.
   Other winners included Jeremy Irons, named best actor for his
portrayal of Claus von Bulow in ``Reversal of Fortune,'' and
Anjelica Huston, who took best actress honors for her roles in two
films, ``The Grifters'' and ``The Witches.''
   ``Reversal of Fortune'' also won best screenplay. The award went
to Nicholas Kazan.
   Best foreign film was ``Life and Nothing But,'' Bertrand
Tavernier's film set in postwar France.
   The critics association has given out annual awards since 1975.

   Lynn Martin said Monday she expects a ``very
productie relationship'' with organized labor if she's confirmed
as secretary of labor.
   The AFL-CIO has given Martin's nomination a chilly reception,
saying she failed to show ``sensitivity'' to workers' needs during
her five terms as a Republican member of Congress from Illinois.
   Martin, who met Monday with President Bush at the White House,
said at a news conference that she looked forward to working with
organized labor.
   ``And I think we'll have a very productive relationship,'' she
said, adding that she also wanted to work for non-union employees.
   Bush said ``working Americans have a friend in Lynn Martin, and
she understands the challenges facing our workforce.''
   Martin, who was in Illinois when Bush hastily announced her
nomination Friday, must be confirmed by the Senate before taking
over the agency that oversees dozens of federal laws regarding job
safety, hours and wages, equal opportunity and pensions.
   The Senate Education and Labor Committee's confirmation hearings
are likely to be held in late January or February, a committee
spokeswoman said.
   Martin, a longtime Bush loyalist, also denied a Washington Post
report that White House Chief of Staff John Sununu told her she
would not be allowed to pick her own deputy.
   ``No. ... No, there was - I look forward to working with the
White House, because we share the same goals,'' Martin said when
asked whether she had been told she could not choose her own
deputy.
   The deputy secretary generally runs the day-to-day operations of
the agency. Administration officials have speculated that the White
House may give the job to David Demarest, a special assistant to
Bush who served as an assistant secretary of labor for public
affairs in the Reagan administration.
   Martin, who gave up her House seat to make an unsuccessful bid
to unseat Democratic Sen. Paul Simon, has been given a lifetime
voting score of 29 percent by the AFL-CIO.
   The federation said she voted ``wrong'' on workers' issues more
than two-thirds of the time.
   Martin, the AFL-CIO said, voted against workers on child care
and civil rights legislation but voted ``right'' on mandatory
parental leave legislation.
   On minimum wage legislation, Martin sent labor mixed signals,
voting to gut a bill that would have raised the hourly wage to
$4.65 but later voting - as the AFL-CIO wanted - to override Bush's
veto of the bill, the federation said.
   Elizabeth Dole, who was labor secretary for two years, resigned
to head the American Red Cross.
   Mrs. Dole tried to strengthen job safety laws and crack down on
child labor violators. Most recently, she had launched an
initiative to search for ways to crack the ``glass ceiling'' that
keeps minorities and women from moving up the corporate ladder.
   Martin supported Bush in his 1980 presidential bid, helped him
prepare for his 1984 vice presidential debate with Democrat
Geraldine Ferraro and was a national co-chairwoman of his 1988 run
for the White House.

   The government pledged Monday to raise
salaries, improve social benefits and open a top-level
investigation into rioting last week that began during a nationwide
general strike.
   Union officials and human rights groups insisted that the death
toll from Friday's riots was more than 30, but the government said
only five people died. More than 200 people were injured.
   Prime Minister Azeddine Laraki, in a statement to Parliament,
pledged unspecified increases in salaries and social benefits. He
said the government wanted to resume talks Tuesday with unions and
management toward resolving nationwide labor disputes centered on
demands for higher pay.
   Laraki also announced that the government would form an inquiry
commission composed of members of the executive branch and
Parliament. He said the commission would be headed by the president
of the Supreme Court, Mohamed Miko, and would investigate why the
riots started and how they were handled.
   Earlier in the day, opposition political parties on the right
and left demanded an independent inquiry into the rioting in Fez
and other cities. There was no immediate reaction to Laraki's
announcement.
   In France, which ruled Morocco prior to independence in 1956,
the governing Socialist Party accused Moroccan security forces of
``bloody and very harsh'' repression. The Socialists' spokesman,
Jean-Jack Queyrenne, blamed the riots on hunger and poverty.
   Tension remained high in Fez and other cities Monday. Minor
clashes were reported during the night in Rabat between security
forces and young protesters. Police units in Fez were issued gas
masks.
   The two union federations that organized the general strike said
Sunday they were prepared to call a new strike if their demands for
higher wages and labor law reforms were not met.
   Government opponents say the gap between rich and poor in
Morocco has widened recently. Per capita income is about $800 per
year, although there is a small strata of extremely rich
industrialists. Unemployment among youths is believed about twice
the official figure of 16 percent.
   In Paris, representatives of one union said the latest available
information indicated 33 people died in the riots. The influential
Parisian newspaper Le Monde quoted sources in Fez as saying the
death toll was about 40.
   The worst violence was in Fez, but rioting also occurred in
several other cities. Union officials claim two people were killed
and 75 wounded Friday in Tangier.
   Fez, the religious and intellectual center of Morocco, suffered
extensive damage from looting and arson. Looters armed with chains
and iron bars ransacked jewelry stores, banks and public buildings.
Rioters also set about 50 buses and cars on fire, and burned the
deluxe Merindes Hotel.
   There were some arson attacks on Saturday but no rioting.
   The government estimated damage in Fez at $15 million.
   About 210 people were arrested over thee weekend, according to
the government. Some began appearing in court on Monday.
   A reporter from the French television channel TF1 was confronted
by police while conducting an interview in Fez and ordered to leave
the country, colleagues reported.

   The Federal Reserve, caught between
persistently bad inflation figures and a slumping economy, is
likely to opt for a slight easing of credit conditions in coming
weeks, private economists said Monday on the eve of a key meeting
of Fed policy-makers.
   The Bush administration has been pressuring the Fed to ease
interest rates aggressively in an effort to lessen the severity of
the recession that many economists think began in October.
   However, the downturn is occurring at a time when inflation has
remained at disturbing levels, in large part because the Persian
Gulf crisis has sent energy prices soaring.
   For this reason, many economists believe that Fed policy-makers
will adopt a go-slow approach when they meet behind closed doors on
Tuesday to map monetary strategy.
   ``Normally, in this kind of downturn, the Fed would be easing
aggressively, but inflation off the Middle East events is still
substantial,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   Many economists were looking for Fed policy-makers, meeting as
the Federal Open Market Committee, to engineer another small
decrease in the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge
each other for overnight loans, private economists predicted
Monday.
   In the past seven weeks, the Fed has pushed the funds rate down
a quarter point three times, from 8 percent to 7.25 percent.
   Many analysts said they believed the Fed would wait until the
December unemployment report is released on Jan. 4 before reducing
the rate again.
   That would give the central bank time to assess other economic
data and also to gauge whether inflation is moderating. A key
statistic on that front will be released right before Tuesday's
meeting when the Labor Department reports on consumer inflation for
the month of November.
   Last Friday, the government said that wholesale prices during
November rose 0.5 percent, about twice what analysts had been
expecting. But many economists believe the report on consumer
prices will show them rising a more moderate 0.3 percent in
December.
   Some economists believe that if inflation does show signs of
moderating, the Fed will move to cut the discount rate, the most
dramatic signal it can send of its desire to push interest rates
lower in order to rescue a slumping economy. The discount rate,
which has stood at 7 percent since February 1989, is the interest
the Fed charges to loan money to banks.
   But there is dispute on this point with other economists
contending that the Fed will not touch the discount rate anytime
soon for fear of sending the wrong signal to financial markets
about the Fed's inflation-fighting resolve.
   Overhanging all of the Fed's deliberations is the threat of war
in the Middle East.
   If a shooting war does erupt after the Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq
to withdraw from Kuwait, that would likely have the effect of
driving oil prices up sharply, thus making the Fed's
inflation-fighting task even harder.
   ``A war would be a very unfavorable environment for the Fed to
be trying to ease domestic interest rates,'' said David Jones, an
economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government securities
dealer. ``The Fed will have to worry about a possible war and also
the effect any further easing would have on other central banks.''
   Jones said if German and Japanese officials hold their interest
rates firm at the same time that U.S. rates are being cut, that
could weaken the dollar as foreign investors dumped the greenback
in favor of foreign-denominated investments offering a higher rate
of return.
   Even if Tuesday's meeting produces nothing more than a small
0.25 percentage cut in the federal funds rate, many economists said
that would be enough to finally push banks to cut their prime
lending rate to 9.5 percent, down from the 10 percent where it has
been stuck since last January.
   David Wyss, chief financial economist of DRI-McGraw Hill, said
that in addition to a half-percentage point cut in banks' prime
lending rate, he was looking for mortgage rates to continue
falling.
   Last week, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages fell to 9.51 percent,
the lowest level in three years, according to survey by the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   Wyss said mortgage rates will probably decline to around 9.25
percent early next year.

<HEAD>High-Tech NASA Can't Keep Its Buildings in Good Repair, Report
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA, which had trouble this year in the
high-tech world of space, is downright deficient in the low-tech
world of keeping its buildings in good repair, a governmental
report said Monday.
   The space shuttle's garage leaks; high voltage transformers are
corroded; one cooling tower collapsed from an accumulation of ice,
and faulty wiring caused a fire in a control room - all because of
poor maintenance, the congressional General Accounting Office said.
   NASA has given little priority to preserving its facilities,
most of which are at least 30 years old, and ``there is no standard
maintenance system within NASA,'' the study said.
   ``Many of NASA's facilities have not been adequately maintained
and are in degraded conditions,'' it continued. ``In addition,
several serious incidents have been caused by the facilities'
deterioration, including a fire and a steam line explosion.''
   The Associated Press, in a report three months ago, called
NASA's crumbling facilities ``a handyman's nightmare.'' The story
cited the leaky roof on the 52-story Vehicle Assembly Building at
the Kennedy Space Center, the second largest building in the world
in terms of volume. Rain has splashed down on computers in the
modernistic, adjoining launch control center.
   Ventilation systems and heating boilers are so old that parts no
longer are available and NASA must make its own. Obsolete circuit
breakers at Kennedy and at the Ames Research Center in Mountain
View, Calif., pose so much danger that power must be turned off
before workers can test them.
   ``People and facilities are critical to mission success,'' said
Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., chairwoman of the subcommittee that
oversees the space agency. ``We can't afford breakdowns on the
ground if we're going to have spectaculars in space.''
   John E. O'Brien, assistant deputy administrator of NASA, called
the report ``a useful assessment'' and ``constructive and
appropriate,'' adding that the agency is in the process of
correcting the problems.
   GAO said NASA leaves maintenance of the $15 billion worth of
facilities to directors of its nine centers, six auxiliary
installations and three deep-space network sites. These directors,
the report said, give maintenance different priorities.
   Things are so bad, the report said, that at the Marshall Space
Flight Center in Alabama the roof of a laboratory building leaked
so badly that electricians working with 440-volt equipment had to
be moved out because of a severe shock hazard.
   At the same center, fire in a mission control building was
caused by loose electrical connections. The collapse of the cooling
tower at the Lewis Research Center in Ohio was caused partially by
the weight of ice that accumulated due to malfunctioning water
valves.
   The report has pictures showing the deterioration: a high
voltage distribution transformer at Ames showing corrosion and oil
leaks; a wall damaged by leaking water in a stairwell at Goddard
Space Flight Center in Maryland; peeling paint and surface
corrosion on a building at Marshall.
   Among the serious problems cited in the report are leaks in the
Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy, where the space shuttle is
mated with its external fuel tank and rocket boosters.
   Because of leaks going back several years, rust expansion of
reinforcing bars caused pieces of concrete up to 8 inches across to
break loose and fall.
   ``To prevent damage to the shuttle or injuries to the workers
below, NASA erected nets between the structural steel trusses to
catch any falling concrete,'' the report said.
   Overall, the conditions of NASA's nine centers were ranked near
or below marginal by the GAO's investigators. The problems
generally were leaking roofs, deteriorating roads, peeling paint
and corrosion, leaking pump seals and groundwater seepage into
basement utility rooms.
   The GAO recommended that standards be established to guide
centers in putting together maintenance plans, that the agency's
budget include funds equal to 2 percent to 4 percent of replacement
value for keeping up the facilities and that annual surveys be
conducted.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Thousands of jubilant Haitians
spilled into the streets Monday in a joyous celebration of a
leftist priest's expected election as the country's first
democratically chosen president.
   A pregnant woman was shot and killed when police opened fire on
a street celebration near a church. It was not known why the
officers sprayed the crowd with bullets.
   Although there were no official returns Monday afternoon, there
was wide belief that the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a charismatic
priest hailed by the masses as their ``prophet,'' had won election
as president.
   ``The people are in power. Now we can't be hurt again,'' said
Jean Verdieu, a youth dancing on a street corner.
   People poured into the capital of Port-au-Prince on foot, in
cars, trucks and buses, dancing up and down city streets, honking
horns, blocking main thoroughfares and stopping traffic.
   Residents of the city slums, some barefoot and in rags, joined
in the celebration alongside better-off Aristide supporters. Some
celebrants rode in Mercedes Benz cars, shiny Nissans and Jeeps.
   Carrying posters of Aristide and waving green tree branches,
people leaned out of their vehicles, shouting, ``Aristide is our
president. Now we are saved.''
   In front of the white-domed National Palace, hundreds on foot
shouted the priest's name under the watchful eyes of soldiers
clutching automatic weapons.
   Truckloads of police dressed in riot gear were on hand to
prevent any violence.
   The woman was shot and killed at midday when police fired into a
crowd celebrating outside St. Jean Bosco Roman Catholic Church in a
Port-au-Prince slum where Aristide once preached. In September
1988, assassins attacked during Mass, killing 12 people, wounding
70 and burning the building.
   Witnesses said that on Monday that about a half-dozen policemen
wearing gas masks pulled up in a blue police pickup and opened fire
on hundreds of Aristide supporters singing and dancing outside the
church.
   Lannis Waters, a photographer, said he saw the policemen in the
truck and heard gunfire but could not tell how many shots were
fired into the crowd, or why. He said the crowd ran in panic.
   From a photograph, the dead woman appeared about seven months'
pregnant.
   There were fears that the celebrations could turn ugly, with
people seeking revenge against supporters of the Duvalier
dictatorship that ruled this Caribbean nation for 29 years.
   When Jean-Claude Duvalier, son of Francois ``Papa Doc''
Duvalier, was deposed in February 1986 following a mass uprising, a
celebration quickly turned into a rampage. People burned and
pillaged homes of known Duvalier supporters in what in Haiti is
called a ``dechoukaj'' or uprooting.
   ``People are very excited,'' said Jean-Claude Roy, a businessman
and political leader. ``This can turn into a very bloody thing.''
   He said it was important for Aristide ``to have the good sense
to appeal to Haitians'' not to resort to violence.
   Outside the headquarters of Roger Lafontant, head of the Tonton
Macoute militia that enforced the Duvalier rule, dozens of
supporters shooed away motorists who slowed near the gates.
Lafontant returned from exile earlier this year to run for
president, but was barred by the Electoral Council.
   Lafontant promised in an interview last week to ``do anything''
to prevent Aristide from becoming president, saying Haiti ``would
never be delivered to communism.''
   The scene was calm and somber in the wealthier suburb of
Petionville, where presidential candidate Marc Bazin, a former
World bank economist, lives and has considerable support.
   One woman selling rice from a burlap sack said, ``Aristide is
not the man here.''

<HEAD>Army Study Says Saddam Has Broad Support in Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has broad-based
support within his country with the army a mainstay of his regime,
according to a U.S. military study written shortly before the
Persian Gulf crisis erupted.
   ``Today in Iraq we have a regime that views its rule as
legitimate, and an army that is confident and supportive of the
regime's policy; on top of which, all opposition inside Iraq has
collapsed,'' according to the U.S. Army War College report.
   ``Contrary to general belief, Iraq's rulers enjoy significant
popular support,'' the report said. ``There is virtually no sign
that the Iraqi army is estranged from the regime; if anything it
appears to be its mainstay.''
   Despite praise for the Iraqi military's professionalism, the
report doubts Saddam's contention that his country could be
self-sufficient in weapons within a decade.
   ``The authors do not believe ... that Iraq has the cash to
develop a major arms industry,'' concludes the study, titled
``Iraqi Power and U.S. Security in the Middle East.''
   ``The most it can do is lay the groundwork for such an
institution, which it can then build on when it gets back on its
feet substantially.''
   The study, which examines Iraq's victory over Iran in the
eight-year war that ended in July 1988, was written by three
analysts before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. It was declassified
over the summer.
   The authors, who did not visit Iraq but examined source
materials, said they based their conclusion of the military's
suport for Saddam on his ``ability to order a general call-up
during what was perhaps the darkest period of war.''
   They also said the population's willingness to comply with the
regime's order confirmed its legitimacy.
   The study raises questions about whether Saddam used chemical
weapons against the Kurdish minority in Iraq in the fall of 1988,
after the Iran-Iraq war ended.
   ``Having looked at all of the evidence that was available to us,
we find it impossible to confirm the State Department's claim that
gas was used in this instance,'' the authors said.
   ``To begin with, there were never any victims produced.
International relief organizations who examined the Kurds ...
failed to discover any,'' the report said. It said the claims
rested solely on the testimony of the Kurds, who have long sought
autonomy from Iraq.
   ``Conclusive evidence on the attack was never produced,'' the
study said.
   Col. Doug Johnson, one of the study's authors, said the authors
did not visit Iraq or interview Kurds to reach their
interpretation. Instead, they looked at published reports and at
pictures, he said in a telephone interview.
   They concluded that the Kurds had symptoms, such as temporary
blindness and skin blisters, that are more commonly associated with
attack by fuel air explosives rather than chemical weapons.
   On Sept. 8, 1988, the State Department accused Iraq of using
chemical weapons against the Kurds, and then-Secretary of State
George Shultz lodged a protest with Iraq.
   At the time, the State Department did not say what evidence it
had that Iraq had used chemical weapons against the Kurds or where
the evidence had come from.
   Amnesty International, the international human rights group,
accused Iraq of killing hundreds of Kurds with chemical weapons.
The group said it based its report on accounts from Kurdish
refugees.
   U.S. officials have repeatedly cited Baghdad's possession of
chemical weapons as a reason for taming Saddam even if he were to
leave Kuwait.
   ``Imagine his (Saddam's) ability to blackmail his neighbors,
should he possess a nuclear device,'' President Bush said at a news
conference earlier this month. ``We've seen him use chemical
weapons on his own people.''
   Several accounts reported Iraq's alleged use of chemical weapons
in the late summer of 1988. Iraq denied the charge.
   During the Iran-Iraq war, both sides used chemical weapons,
according to Leif Rosenberger, another one of the authors.
   But Iraq's chemical superiority ``was overstated, we thought,''
Rosenberger said. Iraq used chemical weapons as a defensive measure
against Iranian ``human wave'' attacks, the study said.
   `Claims that they (Iraq) won simply by using massive amounts of
chemical weapons cannot be substantiated,''
   The war college study also deals with an incident in which Kurds
were killed by chemical gas in March 1988 in the city of Halabjah.
   ``Iraq was blamed for the Halabjah attack, even though it was
subsequently brought out that Iran too had used chemicals in this
operation, and it seemed likely that it was the Iranian bombardment
that had actually killed the Kurds,'' the report said.
   Johnson said pictures from Halabjah showed victims with blue
mouths and hands, indications that a cyanide-based gas had been
used. The Iranians - not the Iraqis - are known to possess such
gases that affect the blood, he said.
   The authors of the war college study said their conclusions were
their own and did not necessarily represent the views of the
college or the army.

   Britain's armed
forces minister said Monday that war in the Persian Gulf is more
likely than ever because Iraq appears adamant about remaining in
Kuwait.
   Archie Hamilton, deputy to Defense Minister Tom King, said the
United States and its allies would find it too difficult to sustain
an army in the region for another year to give economic sanctions a
chance to work.
   Hamilton said he hoped Americans would support President Bush in
choosing to fight if Iraq keeps its forces in Kuwait after the Jan.
15 deadline set by the U.N. Security Council.
   Saddam is ``now back to saying he's not going to withdraw and in
those circumstances it looks as if war is more likely than it was
say a week ago,'' he said during a visit to Java Battery of the
40th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery.
   It is part of the 9,000-man 7th ``Desert Rats'' Armored Brigade,
which is attached to the U.S. Marine force in norteastern Saudi
Arabia.
   ``We have to be optimistic that this man will eventually see
sense and realize he's got to leave Kuwait. He'll either do it
bloodily or he'll go peacefully. He should choose the peaceful
option,'' Hamilton said.
   Saddam has to know that the troops in the U.S.-led multinational
force are ``getting more and more prepared and we're in a position
where we can't just do nothing as the deadline passes,'' he said.
   ``If he doesn't withdraw at that stage, then the risk of war
starts to rise very highly,'' Hamilton said.
   The United States is expected to have about 450,000 troops in
the region by the U.N. deadline and the British more than 30,000 -
the third-largest contingent in the allied forces of 190,000 after
the Saudi army.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and now has an estimated 500,000
troops in Kuwait and southern Iraq.

   President Kenneth Kaunda approved new laws
Monday legalizing opposition political parties, ending 17 years of
one-party rule.
   At a brief ceremony, Kaunda signed constitutional amendments
allowing for a return to multiparty democracy. They had been
approved unamimously by the 125-seat parliament on Nov. 30 and
needed Kaunda's signature to become law.
   ``I'm doing this very happily indeed because I believe it is the
wish of the people to go multiparty again,'' he told officials
gathered on the lawn of his official residence.
   He said multiparty presidential and parliamentary elections
would be held before September 1991.
   After the signing ceremony, leading government opponents said
they will announce formation of a political organization to contest
the balloting.
   Since Kaunda declared a one-party state in 1973, his United
National Independence Party has been the only legal political
organization.
   In a statement in Lusaka, a spokesman for the Movement for
Multiparty Democracy said the group would register as a political
party after a meeting of its officials Tuesday. The party will
retain the name chosen when it was created by pro-democracy
activists as a pressure group earlier this year.
   ``We intend to exercise maximum restraint throughout the
transition period to democracy because we believe in peaceful and
constutional means,'' said party chairman Arthur Wina.
   At Monday's ceremony, Kaunda told colleagues: ``I compel myself
to believe that after 26 years we consider ourselves mature enough
to shoulder the responsibility of running a multiparty democracy.''
   Kaunda, who led the former British colony of Northern Rhodesia
to independence as Zambia in 1964, has been under mounting pressure
in recent months from pro-democracy activists demanding political
reforms.
   Labor leaders, academics, student organizers and influential
businessmen, including one-time Kaunda loyalists, led the campaign
against the ruling party's monopoly on power.
   The Movement was founded in July, after 27 people died in police
and army gunfire in rioting touched off by increases in food
prices.
   Zambia is one of Africa's poorest nations.
   It is the latest of several African nations to reintroduce
pluralism.

<HEAD>Insurance Chief Suggests Banks Pump in Billions More</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. said Monday that banks must soon pump billions of dollars
more into the fast-dwindling government fund guaranteeing
customers' deposits.
   ``A coherent plan should be in place before money is actually
needed. In other words, action should be taken early next year,''
FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said.
   The Bush administration, working with the FDIC, will propose a
plan to rescue the fund early next month, he told the House Banking
subcommittee on financial institutions.
   ``There's no need for panic,'' he said. ``But that doesn't mean
there isn't any urgency.''
   Figures included in his testimony indicate he believes banks
should be required to pay a one-time assessment totaling $24
billion to $25 billion.
   Also, under the figures he presented, annual deposit insurance
premiums would be raised for the third time in as many years, to 23
cents for every $100 in deposits, nearly triple the 8.3 cents
charged last year. The higher premium would bring in an estimated
$6 billion a year.
   Such a burden ``would add only marginally to bank failures,''
Seidman said. He was disputed, however, by three private economists
- R. Dan Brumbaugh of San Francisco, Robert Litan of the Brookings
Institution and James Barth of Auburn University - who presented a
report to the panel.
   Brumbaugh said a one percent assessment on deposits would cost
banks the equivalent of two years of earnings. Litan said it would
cause additional failures costing $3 billion to $8 billion.
   Litan and Barth believe the Treasury should lend the FDIC up to
$50 billion, which would be repaid by banks later, if possible.
Brumbaugh favors using taxpayer funds, without repayment, to
quickly close down failed banks.
   ``That kind of tax on any industry is going to cause problems.
Many firms will fail,'' Brumbaugh said. ``It's basically unfair.''
   Seidman, however, said the banking industry has enough money to
shore up the fund ``unless a disaster occurs.''
   ``As in any insurance fund, the strong have to pay for the
weak,'' he said.
   Only in the event of a severe and long recession would the FDIC
have to resort to borrowing from the Treasury to stay solvent, he
said.
   The FDIC chairman said he was still undecided about exactly how
the assessment should be levied against bank deposits. He has
indicated the administration and his agency are examining a number
of proposals that would allow banks, for bookkeeping purposes, to
spread the expense over time. Critics, however, have raised
concerns that this could amount to accounting gimmickry.
   Richard A. Kirk, president of the American Bankers Association,
said the industry's largest trade group was working with the
administration to come up with a plan for banks to recapitalize the
fund.
   ``The system has problems, but it's gloom, not doom,'' Kirk
said. ``Everyone can guess about what might happen under various
scenarios, but no one can predict with certainty.''
   Seidman's remarks followed the presentation of Brumbaugh, Litan
and Barth's report. They estimated a mild recession would produce
bank failures costing the government $31 billion to $43 billion and
would bankrupt the fund unless it gets more money. A severe
recession would produce failures costing as much as $63 billion,
they said.
   Seidman said the report was credible and, in fact, said its
``estimates in this worst-case scenario of a major, deep recession
are too low.''
   He estimated that 170 banks would fail this year, reducing the
FDIC fund from $13.2 billion at the end of last year to around $9
billion at the end of this year. An additional 180 institutions
likely will fail in 1991, reducing the fund to only $4 billion to
protect $2 trillion in deposits, he said.
   Seidman also raised the possibility that regulators may hold off
shutting down weak banks that appear likely to recover, citing the
success of such a policy toward struggling farm banks in the
mid-1980s.
   ``The FDIC's ... experiences have shown that forced liquidation
of large amounts of assets in weak markets is expensive,'' he said.
``Thus, carefully supervised management of weak but viable
institutions is another option.''
   However, the economists and members of the subcommittee
criticized that ``forbearance'' approach as extremely risky. In the
case of savings and loans, it allowed institutions' owners to
gamble with deposits without risking their own money, they said.
   ``The (economists') report makes it abundantly clear forbearance
doesn't work. ... That is a pathway to hell,'' said Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y.
   Several panel members suggested that deposit insurance should be
curbed and others said regulators should stop banks from paying
dividends to stockholders.
   The subcommittee Chairman, Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., who
commissioned the economists' report, criticized Seidman for failing
to acknowledge the seriousness of the insurance fund's problems
earlier. Seidman began 1990 by predicting the fund would break
even.
   ``FDIC officials may actually have contributed to the problems
facing the FDIC today by their inability to admit that the fund was
in serious trouble,'' Annunzio said.

   Interest rate changes on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed in Monday's auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $10.0 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 6.78 percent, down from 6.86 percent
last week. Another $10.0 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 6.77 percent, up from 6.74 percent last
week.
   The rates for three-month bills were the lowest since they sold
for 6.76 percent on July 18, 1988. The rates for six-month bills
were the highest since they averaged 6.96 percent on Dec. 3.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
- 6.99 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,828.60 and 7.11 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,657.70.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 7.08
percent last week, down from 7.24 percent the previous week.

   University of Tennessee President Lamar
Alexander, nominated Monday by the president to be secretary of
education, was once touted as a possible running mate to George
Bush.
   The talk didn't stop Alexander from taking his wife and four
children to Australia for six months after he wrapped up his second
term as Tennessee governor in 1986.
   ``People couldn't believe it: The others are running for
president and you're running for the other side of the world. I
just went to be there with my family and think about what I wanted
to do next,'' Alexander, who wrote a book about his extended
vacation, said in 1988.
   Alexander said Monday that his priorities as education secretary
will be to improve schools for the nation's children and training
and adult education opportunities for American workers who need new
skills for the changing workplace.
   Alexander, a lawyer and a son of teachers, got his start in
politics as an aide to then-Sen. Howard Baker of Tennessee. He
worked as an aide in the Nixon White House before running
unsuccessfully for governor in 1974.
   He won on his next try in 1978, and served two terms before
having to leave office in 1986 because state law prevented him from
seeking another term.
   That same year he finished second to Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis as the most effective governor in a survey of governors
conducted by Newsweek magazine. He is a former chairman of the
National Governors Association.
   Alexander made education the cornerstone to his second term as
governor. His Better Schools program, outlined in 1983, gave
teachers higher pay based on their education levels and
performance, expanded basic education curriculum, put computers in
junior high schools and added more math and science teachers.
   Alexander, 50, explained his reform plan as ``basic skills
first, computer skills next and then job skills.''
   ``I've tried to be a preacher of the rest of the Republican
message,'' Alexander said in 1988. ``I've always believed that many
Southern Republicans have gotten so fascinated with the Washington
message, which is usually put the harness on government, they've
forgotten the rest of the Republican message, which is what needs
to be done ought to be done locally.
   ``That's sort of been my philosophy, and it's been very
activist,'' he said.
   Alexander has been president of the University of Tennessee
since 1988.

   Snow was scattered from the Northwest through the Rockies and
into the upper Mississippi Valley on Monday, and rain fell across
the Midwest and the South.
   Snow showers reached from western Montana across the Idaho
Panhandle and northern Idaho, central Washington state,
south-central Oregon, western Wyoming, north-central through
central Utah, Colorado, northern and central New Mexico,
southwestern Kansas, eastern and central Nebraska, central and
northeastern Iowa, southeastern Minnsota and Wisconsin.
   By late morning, 1 to 3 inches of snow had fallen in Nebraska
between Hastings and near Omaha, the National Weather Service said.
Roads were snow-packed and slippery across south central and
eastern Nebraska.
   Heaviest snowfall during the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST included
4 inches at Wausau, La Crosse and Tomah, Wis.; 3 inches at Viroqua,
Wis.; and 1 inch at Denver; Goodland, Kan.; Trinidad, Colo.; and
Waterloo, Iowa.
   Freezing rain fell across northwestern Montana at midday.
   Rain fell across southwestern Lower Michigan, Ohio, West
Virginia, western Virginia, western North Carolina, Tennessee,
Kentucky, northern Mississippi, Indiana, Illinois, southeastern
Iowa, central and southern Missouri, eastern Oklahoma, northeastern
Texas, and western Louisiana.
   Rain also fell along the northern Pacific Coast.
   Rainfall amounts during the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST were less
than one inch.
   Elsewhere, snowfall ended around Juneau, Alaska, after 13 inches
of snow since Sunday morning.
   In southern California, frost advisories were posted from Monday
night into Tuesday morning across the San Diego agricultural area.
   But parts of Texas enjoyed record highs, including 81 at Austin,
82 at Corpus Christi, and 80 at San Antonio, where the previous
record of 79 had stood since 1886.
   Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 10 below zero at
Gunnison, Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 3 above
zero at Warroad, Minn., to 91 at McAllen, Texas.

   You can drink, dance or listen to a disc
jockey at the Basix nightclub, but if you want to light a cigarette
you've got to go outside.
   ``It's an enlightenment for customers who suddenly realize they
don't have to put up with cigarette smoke. There is an
alternative,'' said bar owner Bill Watkins, who opened the
nightclub Oct. 31 in a partnership with Pittsburgh Steelers'
football player Chuck Lanza.
   ``When you walk through the door, just take a breath and you can
smell the difference,'' said Watkins, who has asthma.
   Outside, a billboard reads: ``Try smoke-free air for a change.
Draft beer $1.''
   The owners say they've had no major problem because of the
policy.
   ``Every once in a while you get somebody in here who isn't aware
of the policy, and they'll light a cigarette. And everyone will
turn and look at them. It's just like they totally ostracize them.
You don't have to say a word,'' Watkins said. ``When they're told
it's smoke-free, they put it out very graciously. And that's the
end of it.''
   At least one other bar in the country - the Jazz Showcase in
Chicago's Blackstone Hotel - also bans smoking.
   On Fridays and Saturdays, the South Bend club has about 500
customers, each paying a $3 cover charge, the owners say.
   Watkins admits there was much skepticism that the bar would
succeed.
   ``No one believed it literally. We were fought from day one,''
he said.
   But Watkins cites studies from the American tobacco industry
saying only 22 percent of the American public smokes.
   ``I think this country is ready for a smokeless kind of living
environment,'' said Lanza.

   The owners of the five vessels involved in a
700,000-gallon oil spill in Galveston Bay have agreed to pay for a
study of the impact on the area's rich fishing grounds and
sensitive marshes.
   The barge and vessel owners agreed last week to pay the
government more than $156,000 to assess damages the oil may have
caused, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   The funds will be used by NOAA, the Interior Department and the
Texas Water Commission to study the effects of July's spill on
wildlife and wetlands, said Brian Gorman, a spokesman for NOAA.
   The study will focus in part on determining what toxic effects
the oil may have had on young shrimp. Researchers will also develop
a plan to restore damaged marshes and conduct tests to identify the
spilled oil through a chemical ``fingerprinting process.''
   Gorman said the study would give the government an assessment of
how much it would cost to restore the area.
   The heavy fuel oil was spilled July 28, when the Greek tanker
Shinoussa collided with two of three barges under tow by the Chandy
N in the Houston Ship Channel.
   The barges, owned by Apex Towing Co. of St. Louis, spilled
700,000 gallons of the jet fuel into the bay.
   One barge was submerged while another was ruptured and listing.
The third barge was not damaged. The submerged barge kept the ship
channel closed to two-way traffic for six days.

<TEXT>
   Clifford's Green Street Grill on Monday
became the first city restaurant to comply with an ordinance
ordering all hotels, motels, restaurants and bars to install condom
vending machines.
   John Clifford's establishment, in Central Square between Harvard
and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a year early in
complying with the ordinance.
   ``We've had customers come in looking for them,'' said owner
John Clifford, explaining why he installed the condom machines.
   ``We are not going to be condom cops, but we are encouraging
people to take the law seriously and put in machines,'' said
Jennifer Wolfrum, community health coordinator for the city, which
made made a law out of a recommendation to cities by the state
Department of Public Health.
   As of Dec. 1, Cambridge, a multicultured and racially diverse
city of about 100,000 people, had 103 documented AIDS cases,
Wolfrum said. She said from 1,000 to 3,000 Cambridge residents are
infected with the HIV virus, which causes AIDS.
   City officials and AIDS activists said the program may be the
only one of its kind in the nation. Jersey City, N.J., tried to
pass a similar ordinance a few years ago, but the measure was
tabled after it met with strong opposition.
   The City Council adopted the ordinance on Nov. 5 after several
hours of debate and public hearings on the issue. The program was
brought before the council by the Cambridge AIDS Task Force, which
began two years ago to address the city's growing problem with the
deadly disease.
   ``It was not a unanimous vote. But in the long run we did the
right thing,'' said City Councilor John Myers.
   All public places have until Dec. 31, 1991, to comply with the
ordinance.
   The Cambridge AIDS Task Force is printing stickers to be placed
on the machines that will warn users about AIDS and provide
telephone numbers for those seeking counseling and information. The
warnings will be in English, Haitian Creole, Spanish and
Portuguese, said Wolfrum.
   Citing issues of religious and moral values raised during public
hearings, the city is allowing a way out for those at odds with the
measure. Business owners seeking exemption must file a written
request for immunity from the ordinance, but no explanation is
necessary, Wolfrum said.

   Barbie, the doll usually more occupied with
clothing and hairstyle decisions, didn't mean to upset anyone. But
now she stands accused by a Northwest logging group of promoting
the ``radical agenda'' of environmentalists.
   At issue was a Mattel Toys commercial in which Barbie asked her
young admirers how to make the world a better place. One
possibility, she suggested, was that ``We could keep the trees from
falling, keep the eagles soaring.''
   That drew the ire of the Oregon Lands Coalition, which charged
that Mattel and Barbie had pandered to a movement out to shut down
``the engines of this country'' and had exposed children to the
``preservationists' radical agenda.''
   The logging group, which lobbied Congress last year against
legislation aimed at protecting the northern spotted owl, also has
protested in letter-writing and telephone campaigns the
pro-environment products and activities of several other companies.
They include K-Mart, Canon Copiers, American Greeting Cards, Cotler
Manufacturing, Ralston Purina and Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   ``We've been known to activate 3,000 to 5,000 phone calls'' to
manufacturers and retailers, said Jackie Lang, spokeswoman for the
logging group. She said the coalition is part of a timber and
mining political action network that boasts 61,000 members.
   The group also has protested K-Mart's sale of ``Save the Trees''
shirts and helped persuade Cotler to discontinue a children's
clothing line which carried tags that read: ``Environmental
Protection Department. Absolutely No Hunting of Wild and Free
Animals While Wearing This Garment.''
   The Oregon Land Coalition also has assailed companies for
donating a portion of proceeds to environmental groups.
   American Greeting Cards, for example, contributes a percentage
of sales of its wildlife line of cards to the National Wildlife
Federation. Shearson markets an Eco-Logical Trust, which invests in
environmentally conscious companies, and the broker returns some
proceeds to the Environmental Federation of America. Canon is
donating money to the Wildlife Federation and the Nature
Conservancy for every used copier cartridge consumers mail back to
the company. And Ralston is supporting Global Re-Leaf, a
reforestation project, as part of a new cereal campaign.
   ``We want to wake up corporate America to the fact that
powerful, monied groups are at work shutting down the engines of
this country and they are doing it in the name of
environmentalism,'' Lang said.
   ``We need to ask the question, `Who is really in the mainstream
here?''' said Stephanie Sklar of the National Wildlife Federation.
``I would really hate to see these groups bully other companies who
are making an effort to do something positive about the
environment,'' she said.
   In the Barbie commercial, Mattel invited children to send their
ideas for making the world better to the company. The eight
American youngsters who sent the best replies won trips to New York
City for a ``Barbie Summit'' with 39 other children from around the
world. The company promised to donate about $500,000 to the cause
picked by the young summiteers.
   The Oregon Lands Coalition feared the money would go to an
environmental group, and told its members in a newsletter, ``Buy a
Barbie and your money will help stop timber harvesting.''
   As it turned out, while the environment and animal rights were
the top concerns of the U.S. children, world peace was the majority
concern of the international group. Mattel says it has not decided
which peace organization will get the money.
   As for the Oregon Land Coalition's criticism, Mattel spokeswoman
Donna Gibbs said, ``We kind of thought, how can anybody criticize a
program that is designed to give children a voice in a world they
are going to inherit?''
   Cotler said it received an equal number of telephone calls
supporting and denouncing its ``environmental protection'' line of
children's clothes. The complaints included those of the Oregon
Lands Coalition and Save Our Sawmills, of White City, Ore.
   ``The purpose of the theme was to promote an environmental
awareness with young people. Obviously we did not have the intent
to offend any one group's sensibilities,'' said Cotler spokeswoman
Martha Koletar.
   While Cotler withdrew the line, officials for most of the other
companies said they stand behind their efforts.
   ``We feel there is a corporate commitment in trying to keep the
environment clean and good for future generations,'' said Jody
Roberts, spokesperson for American Greeting Cards in Cleveland,
Ohio.
   Canon President Hideharu Takemoto said his company's Clean Earth
Campaign has enjoyed a tremendous response from ``environmentally
conscious consumers'' and the project is being expanded. So far,
the firm has donated $50,000 to the Wildlife Federation and the
Nature Conservancy.

   A Canadian businessman who sold U.S. combat
jets abandoned in Vietnam to undercover U.S. Customs agents was
convicted Monday of filing false documents and illegally importing
firearms.
   Cenon Rey Avelino was convicted of two counts each of filing
false statements and of weapons violations. But he was found
innocent of five other charges, including one of trading with the
enemy.
   A U.S. District Court jury partly accepted Avelino's defense
that he was entrapped by Customs agents who pressured him to come
to the United States to complete the $306,000 deal for two A-37
Dragonfly light attack planes.
   The jury deliberated 21{ hours over four days.
   Avelino was impassive in the courtroom, but lashed out at the
government on his way out of court.
   ``If they did not manufacture a crime, there would be no case,''
he said.
   Juror Joe Franklin said that while the jurors felt Avelino was
not an innocent participant in the deal, they also thought the
government agents had come on too strong.
   Prosecutor Roger Williams said under federal sentencing
guidelines, Avelino would probably face between 12 and 20 months in
prison. Defense lawyer James Harrington said Avelino probably won't
face any additional prison time because he spent more than a year
in jail awaiting trial.
   Arguments on a new-trial motion were scheduled for Feb. 19, with
sentencing to follow, probably in March. Avelino will remain free
on $250,000 bail until then.
   Avelino, 40, of suburban Toronto, was arrested in Buffalo on
Nov. 6, 1989.
   Federal authorities said he sold two Cessna A-37 Dragonfly light
attack planes to undercover U.S. Customs agents for $306,000. The
jets were equipped with 7.62mm machine guns, the basis of the
weapons charges.
   The Pentagon has estimated that nearly 1,000 planes, 940 naval
ships and boats, 42,000 trucks and 791,000 M-16 rifles were
abandoned in Vietnam when the U.S. military pulled out in 1975.
   Avelino purchased the planes from the Vietnamese government and
had them disassembled and shipped to Toronto.
   The crated planes were seized at the international Peace Bridge
coming in from Canada on the day he was arrested.
   The chief prosecution witness, Roy Stafford, was a Jacksonville,
Fla., aircraft dealer who once owned the plane in which Eugene
Hasenfus was shot down over Nicaragua, exposing the secret CIA
assistance to the Contra rebels.
   Stafford, working with Customs agents, led Avelino to believe he
could sell the planes to the El Salvadorean air force. One of the
agents played an Iranian businessman who was supposedly the
financier of the deal.
   Avelino himself was once the personal pilot for the family of
Ferdinand Marcos, the deposed president of the Philippines. He also
was a military attache at the Philippine embassy in Paris
   He said he got into the aircraft parts business in 1985 and
began dealing with Vietnam last year, after an old friend whose
father had become Vietnam's defense minister arranged for him to
meet officials in that country who were trying to dispose of the
abandoned U.S. military hardware.
   Avelino, a Filipino native who became a Canadian citizen in
1977, said he was not acting illegally because Canada has no law
forbidding its citizens from trading with Vietnam.
   He contended he was entrapped by U.S. agents who pressured him
to travel to Jacksonville, Fla., and Buffalo to complete the deal
on U.S. soil, citing surveillance tapes in which he repeatedly
asked the agents if the deal could be done in Canada.
   But Williams introduced a thick sheaf of documents showing
Avelino went out of his way to hide the origin and value of the
jets. He portrayed Avelino as a wheeler-dealer who was willing to
risk breaking the law in pursuit of deals that ultimately could
have brought him millions of dollars.
   In addition to the A-37s, Avelino was willing to deal in UH-1
Huey helicopters, rifles, anti-aircraft guns and bombs, prosecution
witnesses contended.

   School district lawyers go to court
Tuesday in an effort to throw out a lawsuit filed on behalf of an
8-year-old boy who's been banished to a private classroom because
he refuses to cut his ponytail.
   For more than 2{ months, Zachariah Toungate has been kept apart
from his third grade classmates at school because his 7-inch
ponytail violates the dress code.
   Zach has received cards and letters from supporters across the
country. Radio station KOA in Denver, heard in 38 states, has
encouraged listeners to write the school in a ``Free Zach''
campaign.
   A first-grade class in Albany, N.Y., wrote Zach a letter,
saying, ``We feel you should have your hair anyway you want it.
It's not fair that you should be locked in a room by yourself.''
   Zach's parents filed a lawsuit claiming the school's hair policy
discriminates because it doesn't apply to females.
   A state district court judge denied a temporary injunction that
would have allowed Zach back into class. The court scheduled a
hearing for Tuesday at which the school district attorneys will
seek to have the case dismissed.
   In the meantime, the standoff continues.
   Every school day, Zach gets off the bus and says goodbye to his
friends before entering an 11-by-13-foot room dubbed ``an
alternative education setting'' by school officials.
   He eats by himself, plays by himself and, for $35 a day, is
provided a substitute teacher. He has no physical education or
music classes.
   School officials say Zach's grades haven't suffered because he
is receiving individual instruction and is not distracted easily.
   But the isolation is wearing on him, his mother said.
   ``He's still in the room. It's getting real hard on him now,''
said his mother, September Toungate. ``He's real frustrated, but he
says `I want to keep my tail.'''
   Two weeks ago, about 15 students from the University of Texas at
Austin protested in front of the elementary school and submitted a
petition with about 1,000 signatures in support of Zach.
   But school superintendent Paul Flemming said Friday that Zach
will be separated from his classmates indefinitely.
   ``The question is not hair. The question is, are you going to
allow a student to willfully violate a rule,'' Flemming said.
   He said most of the criticism of the school comes from
out-of-state. He said his office has received 228 letters from
outside Texas and all but 10 supported Zach.
   From inside Texas, he said the mail is running about half in
favor of Zach and half in favor of school officials.
   But in Bastrop, he said, ``I have not had one citizen come up to
me personally and say, `We are opposed to the rule.' I have had
numerous people say, `We think you're right.'''

   Filming began Monday on a movie about former
presidential press secretary James Brady and his fight for survival
after being shot nine years ago in John Hinckley Jr.'s attack on
President Reagan.
   Crews for HBO Pictures filmed a re-enactment Monday of the
attempted assassination at the Washington Hilton Hotel. On
Wednesday they're scheduled to simulate the presidential motorcade,
   The movie's working title is ``The James Brady Story,'' with
Beau Bridges playing the lead. It is based on the book ``Thumbs
Up,'' about Brady's life since one of Hinckley's shots struck him
in the head, nearly killing him. Reagan also was severely wounded,
but he recovered fully while Brady suffered permanent impairment of

   Some of the extras in the movie include newsmen and
photographers who were at the actual 1981 shooting.
   ``Primarily, it is the story of Jim's and my family getting
through the trauma, more than the handgun-control aspect of it,''
said Brady's wife Sarah. ``But I think it will probably bring a lot
of attention to the subject'' of gun controls.
   The Bradys were consultants on the film.

   Following are excerpts of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's speech Monday to the Congress of Peoples' Deputies,
translated from Russian by The Associated Press:
   ---
   Comrade Deputies. The present situation in the country is
difficult. The crisis is growing in the economy, in social and
political spheres, and especially in inter-ethnic relations. ...
Dissatisfaction is growing with the actions of central republican
and local organs of power, especially actions of executive organs.
   Even in the course of perestroika, serious errors and
miscalculations have been made by the leadership. We underestimated
the depth of the crisis in the society. ... But we cannot give way
to panic. We must not succumb to the pressure of the present
difficulties. And most importantly, we must act to remove the most
serious dangers and use all opportunities opened by perestroika. .
..
   We have destroyed the foundations of the totalitarian
administrative command system which chained our society for
decades. ... We have started to transform property relations to
create incentives for the individual, to make him the owner of the
means of production and of the fruits of his labor, and to liberate
his initiative. ...
   Our foreign policies have had a decisive contribution in a
healthier international atmosphere. Together with other states, we
have removed the danger of a global nuclear war. Our soldiers have
returned from Afghanistan, and I am sure that nothing like that
will ever be repeated. ...
   The only reasonable policies now will consist of joint efforts
to stop the deepening of the crisis and overcome our weaknesses and
negative tendencies that have become apparent in our society. And
within a year or year and a half, to bring our country onto the
broad road of normal, healthy development toward renewal. ...
   If we have firm power, discipline, and control over the
execution of decisions, we'll be able to set normal food supplies,
rope in criminals, and stop inter-ethnic hostilities. ... If we
cannot achieve it, discord will inevitably grow, and evil forces
will rage, and the state will crumble. ...
   The Communist Party is a natural and indispensable part of the
forces. The cooperation of these public forces will make it
possible to achieve the ultimate goal of perestroika: The renewal
of our society in the framework of socialist choice, on the way to
a movement toward humane and democratic socialism. ...
   Under the new system, the president, who is the head of state,
will directly guide the Cabinet of Ministers, unite and coordinate
the activities of all supreme organs of union power and government.
... And it is important that a vice president should be working
alongside the president, with permanent functions of his own, who
would at the same time fulfill specific tasks put forward by the
president. ...
   The Council of the Federation, as part of the presidential
power, will also have a new role. This is related to the
transformation of our state into a union of sovereign republics. .
..
   The sovereignty of the republics is a historically irreversible
stage in the development of our country. But while drawing away
from overcentralization, we must not allow for the union to grow
into an amorphous entity. ... We proceed from the inviolability of
the principle that each nation has the right to self-determination.
But it is the precisely the nation as a whole that has this right.
   The best form for expressing the will of the nation is a
referendum. And I'm making a proposal for the Congress'
consideration to hold a referendum in the entire country so that
each citizen should express him or herself in favor or against of
Union of Sovereign States on the basis of a federation.
   The results of the referendum in each republic would be become
the final verdict. As for secession from the union, it can only be
carried out on the basis of the appropriate law with due regard to
all aspects of this complex political and socio-economic process. .
..
   We have come across a situation where republics and other
national and territorial entities adopt changes in their legal
status, ignoring the acting constitution of the U.S.S.R. This
guerrilla-type approach can lead to serious disorders and simple
chaos. This is a road to nowhere. ... So I think its necessary for
the Congress of Peoples' Deputies to state firmly that until the
Union Treaty is signed ... that the constitution remains the
supreme legislative statute. ...
   We particularly need strong power to launch a decisive offensive
against crime, to deliver a merciless blow against bandits,
economic sabotage, bribery, profiteering, thievery and hooliganism.
... Special structures to fight organized crime are being
established under the president. ...
   The armed forces are responsible for the defense of our state.
The army is the main foundation of state sovereignty, its internal
and external stability. ...
   I think that this Congress should decisively condemn slurs
against our armed forces and discrimination against them. ... I
want to stress that the problems of the armed forces will be a
priority of the presidential power and its organs. ...
   The utmost priority to be tackled immediately by the presidency
and its organs is the food problem. What is happening now is not
simply a shortage of food. It is a consequence of disorder, lack of
control, criminal negligence. It is a result of unheard-of
disruption of deliveries by republics and regions, of economic ties
and normal relations between the city and countryside. ...
   I want to reaffirm that we are capable of ensuring in 1991, on
the basis of domestic production and purchases from abroad, a per
capita consumption not lower than this year's level. But we need to
bring order the consumption of food resources, I mean gathering,
transportation, preservation, processing, and above all,
distribution and trade. ...

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of State Department employees gave an
enthusiastic welcome home Monday to Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and
his staff, who left Kuwait last week after more than 100 days with
little to eat but canned tuna.
   ``We welcome you back not as heroes, though heroically you
performed, facing danger with courage, intimidation with nerve and
adversity with pluck and ingenuity,'' said Deputy Secretary of
State Lawrence Eagleburger.
   The ceremony took place in the main State Department lobby next
to the honor roll of American diplomats who gave their lives in the
line of duty.
   Howell introduced six embassy colleagues, including four foreign
service officers, who left Kuwait with him last Thursday with the
last of the American hostages in Kuwait.
   Despite Iraq's decision to allow Americans to go home, Howell
said, ``The work involved in this particular crisis is not
finished. There are Kuwaitis today who cannot go home who are out
of their country. There are Kuwaitis in their country who are
suffering a very brutal occupation.''

<TEXT>
   Considering the experience this year and disruption of
deliveries to industrial centers, I have proposed that republics
should sign an agreement for 1991 on the issues of food supplies. .
.. This agreement must be signed while the Congress is in session.
...
   Nineteen ninety-one should be a turning point in reforming land
ownership relations. I propose that this Congress adopt a special
resolution stating that, starting Jan. 1, farmers and all
individuals should be allowed to lease, without any obstacles, land
to use during their lifetime and with the right to pass on to their
children.
   A presidential decree will be passed recommending that local
organs give additional land to current owners of small private
plots who want it. ... Five million hectares (12,350,000 acres)
will be needed for this. ...
   I have given instructions to draft a temporary agreement between
republics on economic issues for 1991. The draft has been
considered in all republics, and we have their remarks. It will be
redrafted and signed. This will remove obstacles to normal
functioning of the state during the period of transition to the
market. ...
   The priority issue now in the country is to normalize the
monetary system and reduce the state budget deficit. For that
purpose the following measures will be taken: A sharp decrease in
capital investment in industry; freezing of unfinished construction
and selling off uncompleted facilities; concentrating finances and
resources on those facilities that are nearly completed; sharp
decreases in subsidies to money-losing enterprises; cuts in
expenditures for administration and management; requiring more
enterprises to be self-sufficient; cuts in military expenditure;
end to issuing money to cover the budget deficit; incentives for
increasing individual savings accounts and sales of major consumer
items, apartments and construction materials. ...
   Starting Jan. 1 ... the state bank will be taken out of the
executive organs. At the same time, a large number of joint-stock
and cooperative banks will be formed and other non-state banks will
be formed.
   Denationalization must not be reduced to a change of labels or
to transferring enterprises from the union to the republics,
because it will lead to a change from the dictate of union
ministries to an equally tough dictate of republics ministries. ..
. I have given instructions for a draft on denationalization and
demonopolization programs to be prepared. It must be discussed and
considered most carefully, but by society at large and the organs
of legislative power, and adopted only after that.
   Our investment policies will focus on the development of
high-tech and low-waste industries. Military conversion will play a
major role. It will consist of modernization of the entire
machine-building complex in cooperation with foreign partners. .. .
   We have given up state monopoly on foreign trade, given
enterprises the right of access to the international market, given
up ideology-ridden approaches which used to lead to waste of
resources in relations with some countries. ...
   Nineteen ninety-one is going to be our most difficult year. The
high-point of servicing our foreign loans will be in 1991. In 1992,
the payments will decrease by 50 percent. Negotiations have been
held with leaders of some countries on opening credit. ... But
everyone realizes that however important foreign aid may be, the
credit itself won't solve our problems. We must count on our forces
and organization and determination in transition to the market, as
well as the toughest austerity regime. ...
   Prices will be regulated by supply and demand eventually, but
this cannot be done overnight. In our imbalanced market,
uncontrolled price growth would have a severe impact on the living
standards of many people. ...
   I am giving all appropriate due to the tremendous input made by
intellectuals working in the arts, science and technology. ... At
the same time, I must say that a large part of the intellectuals
wasted their efforts in sorting out our relationship with the past
and relations among other intellectuals. Those people render poor
service to society, and are accustomed to iciting destructive
passions, destabilizing public consciousness. ...
   Now, more than ever we need discipline and self-discipline,
civil conciliation, hard and selfless labor, and confidence in our
own forces. We must not give up ourselves or frighten people with a
looming catastrophe. The entire society, all work collectives and
every individual, must proceed from words to deeds and decisively
move forward.

<HEAD>Judge Orders New Trial In Multiple Personality Rape Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSHKOSH, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Monday overturned the conviction of
a man accused of sexually assaulting a woman who doctors say has 46
personalities, ruling a defense psychiatrist should have been
allowed to examine the woman.
   Winnebago County Circuit Judge Robert Hawley ordered a new trial
for Mark A. Peterson, 29, of Oshkosh. The judge's action came at
the request of District Attorney Joseph Paulus, whose handling of
the case has been widely criticized, and followed an advisory
opinion by the state attorney general's office that the jury
conviction should be reversed.
   Paulus said he has not decided if he will reprosecute the
ex-grocery store bagger and will consult with the woman's doctors
about whether she could handle another trial. The judge set a
Thursday hearing to determine if another trial will be held.
   George Curtis, the lawyer for the Oshkosh woman, said his client
is willing to testify at a second trial but that he would advise
against it.
   ``I don't think it was in her best interests to go through it
the first time,'' he said. ``I hate to see her beat around any more
by many people who lost sight of both the victim's rights and the
accused's rights.''
   A jury found Peterson guilty Nov. 8 of second-degree sexual
assault in a trial that raised new questions about sexual consent,
mental illness and a rare condition called multiple personality
disorder.
   Jurors accepted Paulus' arguments that Peterson manipulated one
of the woman's personalities to have sex with him in his car.
Wisconsin law forbids sexual contact with mentally ill people who
cannot understand the consequences of their action.
   Peterson, who is married, testified during the trial that he
didn't know the woman was mentally ill and said she consented to
have sex with him.
   The 27-year-old woman said she had no idea she had sex until
other personalities revealed it to her. The case attracted
widespread media attention and the woman later was interviewed for
numerous tabloid television shows.
   The surprise ruling granting a new trial followed the attorney
general's office opinion that said a defense psychiatrist should
have been allowed to examine the woman before the trial.
   The judge's refusal to allow such an examination ``would be held
to be a denial of the defendant's right to access to evidence
relevant to his defense,'' the opinion said.
   Peterson's new lawyer, Mary Sue Robinson, predicted her client
would not face another trial and suggested Paulus found a
convenient way to end the ``circus'' surrounding the case.
   ``I am sure there is careful thought being given how to lay this
thing to rest,'' she said. ``The record in this case is a mess from
several points of view. The camera lights just got too bright for
everybody. I don't think there is anybody who participated in that
trial who would like to have the appellate (court) read the record,
much less the Supreme Court.''
   Curtis said he also expected no new charges would be brought
against Peterson. ``The prosecutor has found a way to get out from
underneath it,'' he said.
   Ms. Robinson had listed nine separate grounds in her bid to get
a new trial for Peterson. The only one addressed in the judge's
ruling was whether a defense psychiatrist should have been allowed
to examine the victim.
   She said Peterson, who faced up to 10 years in prison for the
conviction, has been ``devastated'' by the case and has been unable
to find a job because of publicity.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
privately cautioned Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir against
deporting Palestinian Arabs before four Gaza residents were ordered
expelled, a State Department spokesman said Monday.
   The four Palestinians were described by the Israeli army as
middle-ranking leaders of the Islamic Resistance Movement, an
extremist group also known as Hamas that claimed responsibility for
the slaying of three Israeli workers in an aluminum factory in
Jaffa on Friday.
   ``All of them are known activists of Hamas and all took part in
directing and organizing the violent activities of this
organization,'' the Israeli army said.
   Earlier in the week, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens had
warned that deportations would be resumed after a 16-month
suspension. Israel has expelled some 60 Palestinians suspected of
involvement in terrorist activities and ``anti-Israeli
incitement.''
   Baker met with Shamir over breakfast last Thursday toward the
end of the prime minister's visit to Washington. While the session
was held before the murders and resulting expulsion order, ``the
issue already was in the public domain,'' department spokesman
Richard Boucher said.
   Baker made ``very clear'' to Shamir that the Bush administration
considers deportations of residents of the West Bank and Gaza in
violation of the Geneva Convention's provisions dealing with
occupied territories, Boucher said.
   ``Charges of wrongdoing should be brought in a court of law,''
the U.S. official said.
   Even if they are convicted, Palestinians from the territories
should not be deported but sent to prison within the territories,
the department said later in a brief statement.
   The spokeswoman for the Israeli Embassy, Ruth Yaron, said Shamir
had told Baker that he was aware of the U.S. position on
deportations but that Israel had to deal with a very difficult
situation.
   Sometimes, Shamir said, Israel has no choice but to resort to
such tactics, but it does not issue deportation orders
indiscriminately or in a massive way, and issues such orders only
after careful consideration and when there is no alternative, Mrs.
Yaron said.
   Besides, the Israeli official said, Shamir reminded Baker that
Palestinians who are given deportation orders have a right to
appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court.
   Israel, which signed the international treaty, contends that the
pact refers to mass deportations and not to expulsions of
individuals.
   Besides Baker's admonition to Shamir, the Bush administration
made a point of registering its disapproval in two other ways. John
Kelly, the assistant secretary of state for the Near East,
complained to Ambassador Zalman Shoval here over the weekend, and
the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv complained to the Foreign and Defense
ministries.
   ``Obviously, we condemn the recent attacks on Israelis and the
deaths which have resulted,'' Boucher said in reading a statement
that emphasized U.S. disapproval of Israel's deportations policy.
   In a related dispute, the State Department also criticized
Israel for authorizing snipers to deter Palestinian attacks.
   ``The use of live fire even by trained sharpshooters raises the
likelihood of more deaths and injuries and is an inappropriate
response to the threat caused by stone-throwers,'' the department
said in a statement.
   ``We believe that the use of force should be proportionate to
the action it is intended to prevent. We have raised our concerns
with the government of Israel.''
   The statement said Baker also took up the use of snipers with
Shamir at their meeting on Thursday.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Monday swept
aside a demand that he resign for bringing his people
``devastation, hunger, cold, blood, tears'' and he called for a
national referendum on forming a new federation.
   In an hourlong address to the Congress of People's Deputies, the
national parliament, Gorbachev said citizens would vote on whether
they want to form ``a union of sovereign states on a federative
basis.''
   But he said republics that want to secede must follow laws
requiring a separate referendum and a waiting period of up to five
years.
   ``We must not let the (Soviet) Union disintegrate. This would
have a devastating effect on millions of people,'' Gorbachev told
them.
   The 59-year-old Kremlin leader's popularity has plummeted amid
shortages of food and consumer goods, more crime and increased
ethnic conflicts. Thousands of demonstrators have demanded he quit,
but never before had the issue come to a formal vote in parliament.
   Despite the Russian Federation parliament's approval this month
of private ownership of land, Gorbachev stuck to a conservative
line, again proposing a nationwide referendum on the issue.
   He offered few new solutions in his state of the union address
and took a decidedly cautious tone. His speech received a few
seconds of light applause from the 2,000 lawmakers gathered in the
Kremlin.
   He urged lawmakers to approve constitutional amendments to
strengthen presidential power by adding a vice president and
replacing the 89-member Council of Ministers with a Cabinet of
about 15 people.
   Gorbachev also would create a national Security Council,
responsible for military and intelligence matters.
   At the start of the 10-day Congress, a nervous delegate asked
Gorbachev to resign in a demand broadcast live to millions on
television and radio.
   ``Mikhail Sergeyevich does not have the moral right to hold his
post,'' said lawmaker Sazhi Umulatova, a Communist Party
hard-liner. ``You brought devastation, hunger, cold, blood, tears.
Innocent people are perishing.''
   Her voice shaking, she called for a no-confidence vote. Her
proposal to put such a vote on the Congress agenda was defeated
1,288 to 426, and Gorbachev did not mention it.
   Presidential aide Georgy Shakhnazarov later told reporters
Gorbachev wants a referendum because he thinks secession is too
important for legislators in the republics to decide themselves, as
they did in the Baltics.
   ``Some people make statements that the union isn't needed. Let's
ask the people. Let them decide,'' Shakhnazarov said.
   The Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia already
have declared independence and the 12 other Soviet republics have
proclaimed some form of sovereignty. Lithuania and Armenia
boycotted Monday's proceedings.
   The principle of a union of sovereign states is contained in
Gorbachev's Union Treaty, which the Congress is to consider before
its scheduled end Dec. 27.
   The treaty would preserve central control over national security
and key industries such as energy and transportation. Most
republics are demanding that the national government also hand over
the power to make all economic decisions.
   Gorbachev's main political rival, Russian Federation President
Boris Yeltsin, said Monday that the proposed referendum on a
federation would be a ``waste of time.''
   Yeltsin also told reporters he expected to hear nothing new from
Gorbachev's speech ``and my expectations came true.''
   Yeltsin, whose popularity far exceeds Gorbachev's, sat next to
the Soviet president but the two did not speak to each other at
length.
   Estonian lawmaker Marju Lauristin told reporters Gorbachev's
speech was weak and showed he had ``lost his democratic and radical
supporters and is depending more and more on conservative forces''
such as the hard-line parliamentary group Soyuz.
   But Soyuz leader Victor Alksnis complained that Gorbachev gave
the Congress no concrete program for solving problems.
   President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, who has been
mentioned as a possible vice president to Gorbachev, blasted
Gorbachev's plan for switching to a free market as not radical
enough and criticized his ``begging for bread'' in Western Europe.
   His speech received more than 20 seconds of applause, far more
than Gorbachev's.
   The Congress, the country's highest lawmaking body, has the
right to approve proposed constitutional changes, but only the
republics have the power to approve the Union Treaty.
   Gorbachev admitted making mistakes during his nearly six years
in power but said the Soviet people can overcome them within 18
months, while moving to a market economy.
   ``We have learned a lesson, but we should not be
panic-stricken,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union, Gorbachev said, should not ``return to the
limitless dictatorship and arbitrariness we have condemned and
rejected.''
   He criticized republics and regions that declare sovereignty and
disrupt economic ties, and rejected their pronouncements that local
legislation takes precedence over national measures.
   Gorbachev blasted some members of the intelligentsia, whom he
traditionally has wooed to back his reforms, for acting
``irresponsibly'' in ethnic disputes.
   And in a step that Shakhnazarov conceded was ``antimarket,''
Gorbachev ordered businesses to retain through next year the fixed
prices and contracts they used for trade in 1990.

   A former winery worker was sentenced
to death Monday for killing his wife, two daughters and four other
people in a 1989 wine-country rampage.
   Ramon Salcido's father-in-law, Robert Richards, whose wife,
three daughters and two granddaughters were shot and stabbed to
death by Salcido, called him a coward and tearfully asked for swift
justice.
   Salcido, 29, was convicted on Oct. 30 of the April 1989 murders
of his wife, two daughters, his mother-in-law, his wife's two young
sisters and a winery co-worker.
   Richards urged Sierra County Superior Court Judge Reginald
Littrell to follow the jury's recommendation for the death penalty.
   ``What a coward,'' Richards said. ``He ambushed a man, and
besides that he's a killer of women and children. What is that.
What kind of man was this?
   ``Why drag this thing out for years?'' Richards said. ``He
admitted he did it. He's showed no remorse.''
   The Mexican-born Salcido, speaking through a translator, did
express remorse Monday.
   ``I want to express that I repent for the things that have
happened to the family that I loved the most, and for all the grief
and pain I have caused,'' he said.
   Richards took advantage of a California law that permits victims
or their relatives to address the judge before sentencing.
   ``I built a swing for my two daughters. I'd get home and my
youngest ... would invariably say, `Daddy, push me.'''
   The last time he saw the swing, ``I imagined my daughter saying,
`Daddy, push me,''' Richards said, sobbing loudly.
   Salcido, who sat at the same table as Richards, looked down as
his father-in-law spoke.
   The judge said Salcido will be transferred to San Quentin prison
within 10 days. Since he was sentenced to death, California law
requires that his case be automatically appealed to the state
Supreme Court.
   California has not executed anyone since 1967. About 280
prisoners are on death row.
   Salcido's attorney, Public Defender Marteen Miller, asked that
sentencing be delayed until Jan. 17 to allow time for Mexican
officials to prepare a request that Salcido's life be spared under
a no-death clause in Mexico's extradition treaty with the United
States.
   The judge delayed sentencing for an hour Monday before rejecting
the motion because Miller had not received the request.
   Miller said Friday that Mexican officials planned to sign a
letter to the U.S. Secretary of State invoking the clause. Article
8 states Mexico may grant an extradition request for a murder
suspect only if it is assured the suspect will not face execution
on conviction. Mexico does not have a death penalty.
   Salcido was captured near his birthplace in Los Mochis, Mexico,
within a week of the slayings and confessed to authorities.
   Killed in the spree were Salcido's wife, Angela, their two
daughters Sophia and Teresa, Salcido's mother-in-law, Marian
Louise Richards, his sisters-in-law, Ruth Richards, 12, and Marie
Richards, 8, and winery supervisor Tracy Toovey.
   Only his daughter Carmina, now 4, survived the rampage.

   Police blocked thousands of Palestinians from

officers into the walled Old City to prevent clashes caused by
heightened Arab-Israeli tensions.
   Officials also denied a request by Jewish extremists to enter
Jerusalem's Temple Mount, site of the Jews' ancient temple. Two
historic mosques now stand on the site, and Moslems call it the
Noble Sanctuary.
   The stepped-up security was intended both to prevent trouble on
the mount - where police killed 17 Palestinians during Oct. 8
rioting - and violence over Israel's planned deportation of four
leaders of the Moslem fundamentalist movement Hamas, or Zeal.
   The planned deportations stirred new anger among Palestinians,
many of whom were driven out of Israel with the 1948 founding of
the Jewish state. Israeli outrage was heightened by the stabbing
deaths of three Jews on Friday, which precipitated the deportation
orders. Hamas was blamed in the three deaths.
   Hamas published a leaflet Monday calling for suicide missions
against Israelis and a war of attrition aimed at undermining
Israel's self-confidence, Arab reports said.
   In the occupied territories, at least three anti-deportation
demonstrations were reported Monday. Israel radio said soldiers
fired tear gas and rubber bullets to break up a march at the closed
Bir Zeit University in the West Bank.
   Police set up roadblocks around Jerusalem to block Palestinians
coming from the occpied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Officers also turned away young men trying to enter the Noble
Sanctuary.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III privately cautioned
visiting Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in Washington last
Thursday against deporting Palestinian Arabs, State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday.
   He said Baker made ``very clear'' that Washington views such
deportations as violating the Geneva Convention dealing with
occupied territories.
   Israel says the Convention refers to mass deportations, not
expulsions of individuals.
   More than a dozen members of the extremist Jewish group Temple
Mount Faithful ignored police orders against demonstrations by
marching with Israeli flags near the site.
   The group wants to enter the mount for Hanukkah, the Jewish
Festival of Lights. In October, tensions over a planned march by
the group during the Sukkot Jewish holiday helped set off the riot
and fatal police shootings.
   Gershon Salomon, leader of the Faithful, said Monday his group
would persist in its effort to rebuild the Jewish temple on the
present site of the 7th and 8th century Al Aqsa and Dome of the
Rock mosques.
   The army announced, meanwhile, that a military board hearing
appeals of the four deportation orders was to sit for a second day
Tuesday after accepting defense requests for more time to study the
case.
   The four men ordered deported are all from the occupied Gaza
Strip.
   Police said slogans signed by Hamas were painted on the wall at
the murder scene in the Tel Aviv suburb of Jaffa. In ordering the
deportations, officials blamed the men for inciting the slayings
but not for direct involvement in the killings.
   During the 3-year-old Palestinian uprising, Israel has deported
60 residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It stopped the
practice in August 1989, reportedly under pressure from U.S.
officials.
   In the Gaza Strip, Israel opened a new air strip Monday to serve
the Gush Katif settlement, home to about 3,000 Jews living among
the 750,000 Palestinians in the seaside strip.
   Israel radio quoted Transport Minister Moshe Katzav as saying
air service could increase tourism to a beach resort built by
settlers in the south of Gaza, near Khan Yunis refugee camp.

   A mild earthquake shook west-central
Indiana early Monday, and officials said it had no connection to
the infamous New Madrid fault elsewhere in the Midwest.
   No damage or injuries were reported.
   The quake shortly after midnight measured 3.0 on the Richter
scale, said Larry Braile, professor of geosciences at Purdue
University.
   It was felt from Lafayette to Crawfordsville in west central
Indiana, according to the National Earthquake Information Center in
Golden, Colo.
   ``It was centered two or three miles northwest of Delphi, and it
occurred at a depth of 10 kilometers, which is very common in the
Midwest'' said Kelly Stemnock, earthquake program manager for the
State Emergency Management Agency.
   Delphi is about 50 miles northwest of Indianapolis and about 12
miles northeast of Lafayette.
   ``Each year we record between 10 to 20 events of this magnitude
in the Midwest ... For the most part, these events are random and
scattered, and unrelated to any major fault zone,'' Braile said.
   Two other unrelated mild earthquakes, one in California and
another in Pennsylvania, also were reported Monday.
   The California quake, centered about 60 miles east of Los
Angeles, registered 3.5 on the Richer scale. The Pennsylvania
quake, centered near Erie, registered 2.5 on the Richter scale,
authorities said.
   The quakes came about two weeks after the date climatologist
Iben Browning had projected a 50-50 chance for a major quake along
the New Madrid fault, causing concern in parts of Indiana,
Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois and Kentucky. Browning's projection
was based on tidal changes and was dismissed by other scientists. A
major quake didn't occur along that fault.
   Indiana is not on the New Madrid fault line, but an earthquake
there could cause damage in southern Indiana, Stemnock said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Says House Committee Star Wars Report Is Basically Flawed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon on Monday charged that a House
committee's report on the Strategic Defense Initiative is basically
a ``rewrite of a fundamentally flawed'' congressional report
released in July.
   ``There are a number of problems with the conclusions and
finding of both reports,'' the Pentagon's Strategic Defense
Initiative Organization said in a one-page statement responding to
the study done by the Government Operations Committee.
   The panel report, issued Sunday, cited a General Accounting
Office study issued this past summer that raised serious questions
about deploying the first phase of the strategic defense system,
commonly known as Star Wars, in 1993.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, said detailed tests planned by the SDIO wouldn't be
completed by the time the president has to decide whether to go
ahead with deployment.
   Based on the problems of incomplete testing, the General
Accopunting Office said it did not believe the ``will be able to
give the president enough information to support a 1993 decision to
deploy Phase 1.''
   The incorporation of the ``Brilliant Pebbles'' concept into the
strategic defense system in January drastically changed its design,
leaving it in a state of flux. ``Brilliant Pebbles'' are several
thousand interceptors that would orbit the Earth to seek and
destroy a target by smashing into it at high speeds.
   The House committee, chaired by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.,
warned that Brilliant Pebbles could become the next version of the
ill-fated Hubble telescope, the $1.5 billion telescope whose
primary mirror is flawed and provides a blurred view of its viewing
targets.
   Responding to the reports, the SDIO said the 1993 decision was
never a decision on whether to deploy but rather a choice on moving
toward full-scale development.
   ``Given recent budget cuts, all decisions have been delayed by
at least two years - and deployment of Brilliant Pebbles would not
begin before late in this decade,'' the SDIO said.
   The organization also contends that the General Accounting
Office exaggerated the changes in design of the system after the
introduction of Brilliant Pebbles. It also said the president could
make a decision on the system with the tests planned.
   The organization added that cost estimates are continuing to
drop, ``a trend which we believe all in Congress should support.''
   ``The recent House Goverment Operations Committee report on the
Strategic Defense Initiative is essentially a rewrite of a
fundamentally flawed GAO report released earlier this year,'' the
SDIO said.

<HEAD>San Francisco Board of Supervisors Approve VDT Safety Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City supervisors on Monday approved the
nation's broadest video display terminal safety law, rejecting the
arguments of opponents who had said the law would be too expensive
for employers.
   ``It's historic,'' Supervisor Angela Alioto said of the
ordinance. ``It's on the cutting edge of an extremely important
area for all workers in America.''
   The supervisors voted 7-4 in favor of the law Monday. Mayor Art
Agnos has said he is sympathetic to the need for VDT safety. But he
has said he is uncertain about signing the ordinance in its present
form, citing the costs.
   Agnos said he would meet with business and labor leaders over
the next couple of weeks. He has 10 days to act on the legislation
and the board can till make changes.
   ``I plan to listen carefully to the concerns of both sides
before making up my mind,'' Agnos said.
   Even if Agnos rejects the measure, the 11-member board of
supervisors could overturn the veto with eight votes.
   The law would require city government and businesses with 15 or
more employees to provide those who work on video display terminals
at least four hours a day with adjustable chairs, glare shields,
detachable keyboards, tables with sufficient leg space and special
lamps to reduce vision impairment.
   VDT workers also would be allowed 15-minute breaks every two
hours, and an advisory committee would monitor information about
the health effects of VDT use, including the possible effects of
radiation.
   Companies would have two years to implement the law. After that,
violators could be fined up to $500 per day.
   City budget analysts estimate that San Francisco would have to
spend $1.4 million to $6 million during the next two years to
comply with the bill, and private businesses would have to spend
$31.5 million to $76.5 million.
   ``This is a message to the nation that this is the next wave of
worker safety issues,'' said Supervisor Nancy Walker, who
cosponsored the ordinance with Alioto. ``If this were 100 years ago
we might have been debating child labor laws here today and been
told it was none of our business.''
   The Chamber of Commerce opposed the ordinance, claiming it would
drive business from the city. Jim Lazarus, Chamber vice president,
said Monday he would urge the mayor to veto the bill.
   The VDT Coalition, which represents unions, computer workers and
community groups, cited studies that show provisions in the law
would actually save businesses money.
   VDT's are associated with a wrist ailment called carpal tunnel
syndrome, nerve damage to the wrists and fingers, back and neck
strain, eyestrain, sleep disturbances, chronic headaches, nausea
and fatigue.
   ``One case of carpal tunnel syndrome can cost $70,000 when lost
time and productivity are factored in,'' said Laura Stock of the
Labor Occupational Health Program at the University of California
at Berkeley.

<HEAD>French Communists to Hold First Congress Since East's Upheaval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of one of the West's largest Communist
parties gather on Tuesday for their first party congress since the
fall of Communist rule in Eastern Europe, but the leadership is
expected to block major reform.
   Secretary-General George Marchais is heavily favored to win
re-election and kill proposed overhauls of his policies. But never
before in 18 years as French Communist Party chief has he faced
such vigorous challenges from fellow Communists.
   The congresses, held every three years, are the highest-level
forum for choosing leadership and setting policy. This one will be
held in the working-class Paris suburb of Saint-Ouen, exactly 70
years after the party's founding congress in Tours.
   The Communists hold 26 of 577 seats in the National Assembly. In
1946, they held 182 seats, the most of any party, but their share
dropped to 44 in 1981 and 35 in 1986.
   The party claims 600,000 members, but even some of its own
activists suggest this figure is excessive. Communists control the
municipal councils in 1,097 communities, but only one with more
than 100,000 people -- Le Havre.
   The General Confederation of Labor, a Communist ally, remains
the largest French labor federation but its membership has dropped
from 16 million to 4 million since 1977.
   Marchais, 70, says he has been a longtime supporter of the type
of reform being implemented by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Marchais' critics say the party continues to function in an
undemocratic way. They also contend that the lessons of Eastern
Europe have not been heeded by Marchais, although he did assert in
March that French Communists had been ``duped'' by Soviet Bloc
leaders.
   Marchais' most prominent rival is Charles Fiterman, who served
as transport minister in the early 1980s during a brief alliance
between the Communists and governing Socialists.
   Fiterman wants the party to modernize its platform and open up
its decision-making process.
   Although Fiterman's proposals face likely rejection at the
five-day congress, he has benefited from one change this year - a
decision to allow some internal dissent to appear in the opinion
columns of the party's daily newspaper, L'Humanite.
   Some party dissidents, including L'Humanite's own Moscow
correspondent, Bernard Frederick, say their commentaries remain
barred from these opinion pages.
   But some fairly blunt criticism of Marchais has appeared in the
newspaper. One article, by Jean-Pierre Brard, asked: ``How
insightful is a leadership which wasn't able to distinguish the
truth from the lies during its conversations with the heads of the
East's Communist countries?''
   Despite its problems - it received under 10 percent of the vote
in recent elections - the French Communist Party remains one of the
largest in the West.
   The largest, in Italy, is undergoing a major self-examination.
Its leader, Achille Occhetto, has proposed dropping the word
``Communist'' from the party's name.

   The death toll in last week's fiery
83-car interstate pileup has been lowered once again - from 13 to
12, authorities said Monday.
   Investigators initially reported that 15 people died in the Dec.
11 crash on a fogbound stretch of Interstate 75, about 40 miles
northeast of Chattanooga. The next day they lowered the number of
fatalities to 13, saying the scattered condition of the body parts
caused them to count some victims twice.
   The same confusion accounted for the latest discrepancy, said
Dr. Iris Snider, assistant McMinn County medical examiner.
   ``That gives you an idea of the shape everything was in,'' the
doctor said. ``We started out with 15 (body) bags.''
   She said that after studying certain body parts Sunday she
suspected that what she thought were two victims were actually one.
That hunch was confirmed when the victim's wife identified a
certain piece of jewelry, she said.
   All the victims had been identified by Monday, officials said.
   The chain-reaction pileup occurred on a stretch of I-75 that is
notorious for morning fog. Between 1974 and 1979 there were six
fog-related, multi-vehicle accidents along the road.

   President Bush said Monday he would nominate
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander as education secretary,
choosing a teachers' son with a reputation as an education reformer
to take over a department recently troubled by controversy.
   Bush made no mention of last week's abrupt departure of his
first education secretary, Lauro Cavazos, who was forced to resign
by the White House. Praise for the choice of Alexander, currently
president of the University of Tennessee, was quick and widespread,
suggesting there would be no lingering ill effects from the firing
of Cavazos.
   Meanwhile, sources said the administration had decided to
reverse a ruling by the Education Department's Office of Civil
Rights that colleges could not award scholarships on the basis of
race alone.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush was ``very
disturbed'' by a department official's ruling last week that such
scholarships are illegal.
   Bush ``believes these scholarships are important to minorities
and to ensuring opportunities for all Americans to get a good
education,'' and has ordered the department to conduct a quick
review, with advice from the Justice Department and White House
lawyers, Fitzwater said.
   Alexander refused to be drawn into the controversy, saying in
answer to questions that he had ``many many opinions about it'' and
would be willing to ``be full of advice to the president'' and the
Senate.
   ``My general disposition would be that when you're wandering
through constitutional thickets, that a warm heart and a little
common sense sometimes are helpful,'' he said, noting that the
University of Tennessee offers scholarships to poor, minority
students.
   The president, announcing his choice of Alexander, said, ``No
governor in the country is so clearly identified with the
imperative to improve education in America.''
   ``Lamar, if you'll remember, was at the forefront of the
movement to restructue our nation's schools,'' Bush said. ``When
he was chairman of the National Governors' Association he was
instrumental in bringing education reform to the very top of the
agenda.
   Alexander, 50, left the Tennessee governor's office in 1986
after two terms and moved to Australia for six months. In 1988, he
was appointed to his university post.
   He said his goals, in addition to improving schools for the
nation's children, will include creating better training and adult
education opportunities for American workers who need new skills
for the changing workplace.
   Alexander said that when Tennessee was looking for workers for a
new General Motors plant, families considering the move had two
concerns:
   ``The second question is, `Where can I get good schools for my
children?' and the first question is, `Where can I go back to
school?''' he said.
   While governor, Alexander unveiled an education reform package
called Better Schools that included adding a career ladder of pay
raises for teachers and principals, expanding basic education
curriculum, putting computers in junior high schools and hiring
more math and science teachers.
   In early reaction to the choice:
   - Richard F. Rosser, president of the National Association of
Independent Colleges and Universities, called Alexander ``one of
the best people in the country'' in terms of background and
understanding of education. Rosser added, ``He also is known as a
thoughtful, moderate Republican ... and clearly we need someone who
is going to be in the mainstream in terms of their thinking of what
needs to be done in education.''
   - Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, said he was optimistic that Alexander could bring to the
department some of the dynamism that critics said it lacked under
Cavazos. He said he hoped Alexander would not be as zealous as
others in the Bush administration in pushing the concept of public
school choice as the key to school reform.
   - Ernest Boyer, head of The Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching, said, ``Every signal suggests that not
only does he have strong commitment but a realistic sense of what
the priorities should be. It seems to me that he's looked at reform
more broadly. There is nothing in his past record to suggest that
he's be narrow or ideological.''
   Bush's choice of Alexander, three days after picking Rep. Lynn
Martin of Illinois as labor secretary, fills his Cabinet for now -
although there is much talk that at least one more member may leave
soon, perhaps to take the vacant position of chairman of the
Republican National Committee.
   The nominations will be considered by the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee. The panel's chairman, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., said Monday that Alexander ``has a distinguished record in
education and earned bipartisan respect for his role in stimulating
education reform in the states.''
   Alexander told Bush Monday that his parents were teachers and
that as governor ``I discovered that our state's major need was
better schools, colleges and universities.''
   He received a law degree at New York University and later
supplemented his income as a law clerk in New Orleans by playing
the trombone in a Dixieland band at night.

   Food and Drug Administration officials said
Monday they were looking into reports that a drug commonly used to
sedate children may cause cancer.
   The concerns were raised by California state Health Director
Kenneth Kizer, who said that if carcinogenity is confirmed by an
Environmental Protection Agency study, the FDA should issue a
warning about the drug.
   In a letter to FDA Commissioner David Kessler last week, Kizer
said interim results from the EPA study found cancer in mice that
were given oral chloral hydrate.
   These findings along with those from other studies, ``raise
serious concerns about carcinogenic risks,'' Kizer said.
   ``Interviews with health care professionals who prescribe,
dispense, and administer chloral hydrate, including neonatologists,
pediatricians, pedodontists, and hospital pharmacists, indicate
that these practitioners are unaware of the carcinogenic risks of
this drug,'' he wrote.
   Kizer sent with his letter brief summaries of more than 20
studies conducted during the 1970s and 1980s involving chloral
hydrate. The findings ranged from changes in cell development to
genetic mutations. In one study, young mice got cancer after a
single dose of the drug.
   FDA spokeswoman Eva Kemper said the FDA had received the
letter,but ``at this point we have no comment.'' She said the
agency was looking into the matter.
   EPA officials conducting the study in Cincinnati, Ohio, had left
for the day and could not be reached for comment.
   Chloral hydrate has been sold for many years as a branded and a
generic product for use as a hypnotic and sedative. It was used
widely before the federal government began regulating drugs in
1938, which means it was never subjected to the kind of scrutiny
that new drugs are.
   It is used by doctors and dentists as a sedative for children to
keep them still for examinations. Also, neonatologists give it to
newborns on ventilators.
   Ed Brewton, vice president of scientific affairs at Roxane
Laboratories Inc., said his company has been getting calls after
reports of the possible cancer risk associated with the drug.
Roxane makes generic chloral hydrate products, including an oral
syrup and soft gelatin capsules, he said.
   He said he was first alerted to concerns by a letter that
appeared in the journal Science in October, in which a University
of California professor raised questions about pediatric use of
chloral hydrate because of cancer risks.

   The 21st game of the world chess
championship, scheduled to take place Monday, was postponed until
Wednesday at the request of Garry Kasparov, who is only one point
away from retaining his title.
   Kasparov, who leads Anatoly Karpov by 11 points to nine, has now
used up all three of the timeouts allotted to him. Karpov has one
timeout remaining.
   Karpov will have the advantage of the white pieces in the 21st
match, but his chances of overall victory have virtually
disappeared. He would need to win three of the final four matches
and draw the other to win back the title he lost to Kasparov in
1985.
   Of the 20 games played thus far in New York and Lyon, Kasparov
has won four and Karpov two, with draws in the others. Kasparov has
won the last three times he has played with the white pieces,
including a brilliant victory in the 20th game on Saturday.
   He would retain the title in the event of a 12-12 tie, and thus
needs only one more victory or two ties. Karpov needs 12.5 points
to win.
   The victor earns $1.7 million of a $3 million purse, plus a
diamond-studded trophy valued at $1 million.

   The United States cautioned NATO allies Monday that Iraq might
stage a partial withdrawal from Kuwait as a ploy, and President
Bush pledged ``no negotiation for one inch'' of Kuwaiti territory
would take place.
   Iraq called up 33-year-old reservists and insisted it would
never submit to U.S. demands to quit Kuwait. Meanwhile, the U.S.
Army was reported calling up some of its retired military personnel
to active service.
   Bush said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was ``just as wrong as
he can be'' if he doubts America's willingness to go to war.
   Both Washington and Baghdad professed support for talks to
resolve the Persian Gulf crisis, but neither side appeared willing
to compromise on when to meet. The dispute derailed talks
tentatively set for Monday in Washington between Bush and Iraq's
foreign minister.
   Britain's armed forces minister, Archie Hamilton, said Monday
war is more likely than ever because Iraq seems set on remaining in
Kuwait. He said on a visit in Saudi Arabia that America and its
allies would find it too hard to sustain an army in the region for
another year to give economic sanctions a chance to work.
   Bush and the NATO allies again told Iraq to leave Kuwait by Jan.
15, the deadline set in a U.N. resolution authorizing force to
liberate Kuwait.
   ``I think at midnight (on Jan. 15), if he's not totally out of
Kuwait, the U.N. sanctions must be fulfilled,'' Bush said in
Washington, adding:
   ``I'm not in a threatening mode. I don't think any of us are.
We're in a determined mode. A mode that he should get out,'' he
said. ``And he's got to understand it. So we keep on repeating it:
no negotiation for one inch of territory.''
   The foreign ministers of the 16 nations of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization issued a statement saying a ``complete Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait and the restoration of the sovereignty and
legitimate government of Kuwait are unequivocal conditions for a
peaceful slution'' to the gulf crisis.
   ``There can be no partial solutions,'' said the statement,
issued Monday in Brussels, Belgium. It condemned Iraq's
``persistent contempt'' for U.N. resolutions concerning Kuwait.
   The statement was issued after Secretary of State James A. Baker
III discussed the gulf crisis with his NATO counterparts, along
with his stalled efforts to start direct talks with Iraq.
   Baker told the allies Saddam may try to divide the international
community. ``We need to anticipate Saddam's moves, be prepared for
a partial withdrawal ploy and coordinate closely our response,''
said Baker.
   The NATO allies said they hoped war could be averted, but
reaffirmed their pledge to abide by all U.N. resolutions, including
the one authorizing a military strike unless Iraq withdraws from
Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   All NATO nations except Iceland, Luxembourg, Germany and Turkey
have troops, naval units or warplanes in the gulf region.
   U.S. Army planner Lt. Col. Henry H. Hanrahan said Monday in
Washington tha for the first time since the 1961 Berlin crisis the
Army was ordering some retired personnel to active duty.
   He said an initial callup of 15 retired Army doctors' aides was
approved last week, and about 200 more retirees probably will be
involuntarily recalled for active duty over the next month.
   On Monday the Navy announced 769 Navy Reserve members, including
many medical specialists, are being ordered to active duty. It
called up about 2,300 medical reservists last week.
   Baghdad newspapers reported Monday Iraq's Ministry of Defense
has recalled men born in 1957 to bolster the mobilization of almost
500,000 soldiers already in Kuwait and southern Iraq.
   By mid-January, the United States will have deployed more than
400,000 troops in the gulf. Its allies have committed about
220,000.
   The United States and Iraq agreed to high-level talks on the
crisis, but can't agree on scheduling them. Bush says he won't send
Baker to Baghdad later than Jan. 3; Saddam wants a Jan. 12.
   Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council issued a statement Monday
saying Iraq would not let America determine the meeting date.
   ``We seek peace. We want dialogue for the sake of peace. We
respect legitimacy and seek the application of the international
law on the nation's causes. However, we reject capitulation,'' said
the statement, broadcast by Baghdad radio.
   The government-run Al-Jumhouriya newspaper said Iraqi civil
defense authorities have opened 342 training centers in Baghdad. In
the past two weeks, Iraq also set up new bomb shelters and expanded
first-aid courses.
   In other developments:
   -A U.S. military study written shortly before the crisis broke
out said Saddam has broad-based support within Iraq with the army,
a mainstay of his regime. ``On top of which, all opposition inside
Iraq has collapsed,'' the U.S. Army War College report said.
   -A Soviet envoy, Vladimir Mordvinov, began talks in Baghdad on
Monday with Iraqi officials on Iraq's demand that Moscow pay
penalties to terminate the contracts of Soviet workers in Iraq. A
Soviet diplomat said the issue threatens to delay the departure of
2,565 Soviets.
   -Britain's ambassador to Kuwait and his consul flew to Jordan
from Baghdad, bound for London. They were the last two Western
diplomats to leave Kuwait.
   -The British Foreign Office on Monday advised British women and
children in Bahrain, Qatar and parts of Saudi Arabia to leave
before Jan. 15.

   Central American presidents
condemned Salvadoran guerrillas Monday and expressed their
strongest support yet for the rightist government of President
Alfredo Cristiani.
   A communique issued at the end of a three-day summit of the five
presidents demanded the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
rebels declare an immediate cease-fire, abandon the 11-year-old war
and join the political process.
   ``We condemn the FMLN for its violent actions, which have caused
pain and death in the Salvadoran civilian population and caused
serious damage to the economic infrastructure of the country,'' the
communique said.
   It was signed by presidents Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala, Rafael
Angel Calderon of Costa Rica, Leonardo Callejas of Honduras,
Violeta Chamorro of Nicaragua and Cristiani. President Guillermo
Endara of Panama attended as an observer.
   A senior guerrilla commander - Maria Marta Valladares, better
known as Nidia Diaz - called the communique biased and said the
rebels will not heed it.
   ``Once again the Central American presidents emit a resolution
that is removed from the Salvadoran reality,'' she said in a
telephone interview from guerrilla offices in Mexico City.
   ``It makes no sense to ask us to abandon the armed struggle as
long as the causes that gave rise to the armed struggle are not
overcome,'' she said.
   She said the rebels would keep acquiring and using sophisticated
weapons ``as long as necessary.''
   The summit statement, named the Declaration of Puntarenas for
the Pacific coast port where the presidents met, demanded the
guerrillas ``immediately halt use of sophisticated weaponry such as
was used in the recent offensive.'' It asked U.N. Central American
observers to investigate the weapons' origin.
   The rebels used surface-to-air missiles to bring down an A-37
attack jet on Nov. 23 and an AC-47 on Dec. 4, their first use of
missiles to down warplanes.
   Cristiani said on his return to El Salvador he was ``extremely
pleased'' with the summit's results.
   ``If the FMLN continues to ignore these calls, it will lose more
and more political space that allows it to generate violence,''
Cristiani said.
   The missile incidents and increased guerrilla effectiveness with
rifle fire against aircraft damaged pilots' morale and made them
more cautious. Guerrilla defeat of 200 elite troops last week was
blamed in part on lack of air support.
   The war has killed an estimated 73,000 people. It became the
central issue of the talks as a result of the rebel offensive that
began Nov. 20. Last week government troops were driven across the
border into Honduras.
   The summit statement reflected the Salvadoran government's
position in negotiations with the guerrillas. Rounds of talks held
between May and September bogged down over rebel demands that the
Salvadoran army be reduced and purged of human rights violators.
   The government says it will purge its ranks but without
guerrilla help.
   Pressure from other regional presidents on the Sandinista
government in Nicaragua helped force President Daniel Ortega's
administration to allow free elections and the transfer of power to
Mrs. Chamorro, who took office April 25.
   The Central American leaders scheduled their next meeting March
18-19 in Nicaragua. They also will meet with Mexican President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari on Jan. 11 and 12 in Tuxtla Gutierrez,
Mexico.

   Suspected Maoist guerrillas have shot and
killed a congressman of the governing party after an awards
ceremony at a sports club, police said Monday.
   The Sunday night attack on Alejandro Victoria Mendoza is the
first against a congressman for President Alberto Fujimori's Change
90 party.
   Police said three Shining Path rebels attacked Victoria Mendoza,
congressman for the state of Huancavelica, as he left a sports club
on Lima's eastern outskirts.
   The guerrillas shot Victoria Mendoza three times in the head at
close range, killing him instantly, police said. The guerrillas
escaped in a car before police arrived.
   Three other people were wounded in he attack, according to
police.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
   Mendoza is the second congressman slain by rebels since May
1989. Huancavelica state, in the southern Andes, is a center of
guerrilla activity.
   More than 20,000 Peruvians have died in political violence since
the Shining Path took up arms in 1980.

<HEAD>Security Council Weighs Resolution on Protecting Palestinians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Security Council consulted on Monday
night about draft resolutions that would deplore planned Israeli
deportations of Palestinians and enhance protection of Palestinians
in Israeli-occupied lands.
   The 15-member council also was considering draft resolutions
that would recognize the importance of a properly structured Middle
East peace conference.
   ``All governments (here) believe Israel is wrong to be deporting
Palestinians,'' British Ambassador David Hannay said after
consultations. ``The most important thing is that we communicate to
Israel that it must stop.''
   The order to deport four Palestinian activists linked to an
extremist group has complicated the long-delayed council meeting
aimed at increasing protection of Palestinians under Israeli
occupation and expressing general support for a peace conference.
   The United States has sought to cut out any reference to a
conference from the heart of a resolution about protecting
Palestinians, saying Iraqi President Saddam Hussein might
misinterpret that as linkage to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The meeting has been postponed three times recently at U.S. and
Soviet urging. They insist the Arab-Israeli question not be linked
to the gulf crisis. The Kremlin has indicated it would support
further delays.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Monday
deplored the decision by Israeli authorities to deport four
Palestinians from the occupied territories, calling it a violation
of the Fourth Geneva Convention.
   Israel identified the four Gaza Strip residents as leaders of a
group which claimed responsibility in the killing of three Israeli
workers in a Jaffa factory on Friday.
   The Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits expulsions. But Israel,
which signed the treaty, says it does not apply to this case and
refers only to mass deportations, not individual expulsions.
   The latest U.S. draft resolution, diplomats said Monday, would
deplore planned deportation of Palestinians and remove the
reference to a Mideast peace conference.
   Mention of a conference would be shifted to a non-binding
statement by the president of the council, which also would
categorically state there is no linkage between the Arab-Israeli
dispute and the Gulf crisis.

   A veteran police detective was stripped of his
shield after being questioned about allegations that he took a
bribe from reputed mob boss John Gotti, the Police Department said
Monday.
   The announcement came the same day that Gotti, the reputed head
of the Gambino crime family, learned that he would spend at least
the rest of the week in jail. The judge in Gotti's racketeering
case postponed a bail hearing until Friday while he considered a
prosecution request to play secretly recorded tapes in open court.
   Police officials said Detective William J. Peist, 43, is the
unidentified ``public official'' referred to in the Gotti
indictment as allegedly receiving money after informing mobsters
that police had bugged a construction company's office.
   Peist, a member of the department's Intelligence Division, was
stripped of his shield and guns and placed on desk duty after he
``refused to extend any cooperation'' to FBI officials during
questioning Friday, said Chief Daniel F. Sullivan, head of the
Inspectional Services Bureau. The bureau includes the Internal
Affairs Division.
   Although Peist is not charged in the indictment, he faces
departmental charges for not cooperating, Sullivan said.
   Peist could not be reached for comment. Police would not release
his address and no phone number was listed for him in Brooklyn.
   The New York Post reported Monday that one of the tapes being
offered by prosecutors provides evidence that Gotti paid at least
$10,000 to a police officer for the tip.
   The six tapes were made from electronic listening devices
planted in Gotti's Manhattan hangout, the Ravenite Social Club in
Little Italy. Prosecutors say they show that Gotti is a threat to
the community and should be held without bail while he is awaiting
trial.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Gleeson had been expected to play
the tapes at Monday's hearing for Gotti and two co-defendants, but
after defense lawyers raised objections, U.S. District Judge I. Leo
Glasser postponed the matter until Friday.
   ``We don't want the hearing to be a circus. We don't want to try
the case in the newspaper, on television,'' Gotti's lawyer, Bruce
Cutler, said outside the courtroom.
   Glasser gave the media until noon Tuesday to file oppositions to
closing the courtroom.
   New York Newsday, The New York Times, the Staten Island Advance,
NBC Network News, The Associated Press and other media planned to
join in filing such a motion, said Nancy Richmond, a lawyer for
Newsday.
   Gotti, who was arrested Wednesday, is accused of ordering the
assassination of his predecessor, Paul Costellano, to take over as
boss of what prosecutors call the nation's most powerful criminal
organization.

   Premier-designate Dimitar Popov said
Monday that an agreement has been struck on a new government to try
to pull the Balkan country out of a severe economic and political
crisis.
   Popov said on government TV that the two main political forces,
the Socialists and the Union of Democratic Forces, reached
agreement on dividing up Cabinet posts in the new government.
   He did not identify any of the ministers, but said only that
they were ``respected and competent'' figures.
   The new government, which will serve until new elections next
summer, must still be formally approved by legislators before it
can begin functioning.
   Popov, a judge who is a member of neither leading faction, was
chosen to lead a new government after strikes and protests forced
Socialist Premier Andrei Lukanov and his government of former
Communists to quit late last month.
   The two sides came close to an agreement last week, but a
dispute over control of the Interior Ministry kept them apart. The
ministry is in charge of law enforcement.
   Parliamentary sources said the Socialists will keep the Interior
and Defense ministries, while the opposition could name a vice
premier with authority to observe their work.
   The opposition gained the crucial Finance Ministry and the
Socialists will take the Foreign Trade Ministry, the sources said.
   Viktor Volkov of the Agrarian Party will be designated foreign
minister under the agreement, sources said.
   Electricity and many consumer goods are rationed or simply
unavailable in Sofia and elsewhere in this country of 9 million
people. Political bickering has prevented any government from
attacking the problems.

<HEAD>Legislators Vote Against Restoring Hanging</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House of Commons voted by wide margins Monday
night against restoring capital punishment, which was abolished by
act of Parliament in 1969 except for treason and piracy.
   It follows the freeing of four people wrongly convicted of
murder in Irish Republican Army bombings, and the scheduled hearing
of appeals by six prisoners who say they also were wrongly
convicted of murder in IRA attacks.
   Legislators in a series of votes:
   - defeated 367-182 a motion to introduce hanging for murder in
general provided the Court of Appeal was given power to commute the
sentence to life imprisonment if it thought fit;
   - defeated 350-215 a motion tointroduce hanging for the
murderer of a policeman;
   - defeated 349-186 a motion to introduce hanging for murder by
firearms, explosives or offensive weapons.
   But the House voted 289-257 to retain hanging for treason and
piracy, at least for the time being, after Home Secretary Kenneth
Baker, the Cabinet member responsible for law and order, indicated
the government plans to consider the issue later.
   Legislators in each case voted according to conscience, unbound
by party instructions.
   It is the ninth time since 1969 that the House has voted against
restoring the death penalty in defiance of overwhelming public
support for its reintroduction. Public opinion polls have show
four-fifths of the British public want it restored.
   The last hangings in Britain, of a convicted murderer and his
accomplice, occurred Aug. 13, 1964.
   Pro-hanging Conservative Party legislator Ivan Lawrence said
during the debate that the nation was overwhelmingly wanted capital
punishment restored. He said the deterrent of life imprisonment for
murder had totally failed.
   But Baker warned about the danger of miscarriages of justice.
   ``There is no appeal from the grave. The possibility of an
innocent person being hanged by mistake cannot be dismissed with a
shrug,'' he said.
   There has been grave concern over the case of the Guildford Four
- three men from Northern Ireland and an English woman freed last
year after 15 years in jail following conviction for murder.
   Three detectives who investigated the 1974 IRA bombings at
Guildford southwest of London and at Woolwich in southeast London
will be charged with conspiring to obstruct justice, the Crown
Prosecution Service announced last month. Seven people died in the
two bombings.
   Appeals by another group of prisoners, the Birmingham Six, will
be heard early next year, the Court of Appeal said Monday.
   The six Irishmen were jailed for life after being convicted of
murder in 1975 in IRA bombings at two pubs in Birmingham in central
England the previous year that killed 21 people. Critics allege
police beat confessions out of them.

   Law enforcement officers fired at two
16-year-old escapees from a juvenile home, killing one and wounding
the other during a high-speed chase through the Yakima Indian
Reservation on Monday, authorities said.
   The teen-agers had escaped Friday from a juvenile detention
center in Tacoma, stolen a car and traveled to the Yakima area,
about 160 miles away, said Pierce County sheriff's spokesman Curt
Benson.
   Yakima County Prosecutor Jeff Sullivan, who conducted a
preliminary investigation, said the shootings appeared justifiable.
   ``Officers had been advised that these individuals were
considered to be armed and dangerous,'' Sullivan said. ``They
apparently told someone they would not be taken alive and would
shoot at police.''
   One firearm was found in the youths' car, he said.
   Authorities encountered the youths after spotting the stolen
vehicle Monday morning at a convenience store. Shots were fired and
a high-speed chase began, Sullivan said. It was not clear if the
youths shot at officers, Sullivan said.
   Yakima County sheriff's officers and Yakima tribal police chased
the youths' vehicle about 30 miles, shooting at the car in an
attempt to stop it, Sullivan said.
   A Yakima County sheriff's statement said sheriff's Sgt. Max
James and Yakima tribal officer Ross Sockzehigh were involved in
the chase and shootings. Both likely will be suspended with pay
pending an investigation, Sullivan said. Both youths, whose names
were withheld because of their ages, had a criminal history in the
Tacoma area, Benson said. He did not elaborate.
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation is joining the investigation
because the shootings occurred on an Indian reservation.
   Yakima is in the center of the state. Tacoma is about 30 miles
south of Seattle.

<HEAD>Colombian Decree Paves Way for Drug Smugglers' Surrender</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN GUTKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government issued a decree Monday
paving the way for a mass surrender by drug traffickers by lifting
the threat of extradition.
   Hours earlier, the Bogota daily El Espectador said granting
concessions to the Medellin cocaine cartel was like trying to
appease Adolf Hitler.
   President Cesar Gaviria's administration clarified on Monday
earlier offers to drug traffickers who surrender and confess their
crimes. It said they will not be sent to face trial in the United
States and will be eligible for reduced prison sentences.
   ``Those who accept this decree have an absolute guarantee that
they will not be extradited,'' Justice Minister Jaime Giraldo told
foreign reporters.
   The decree guarantees traffickers' human rights, appointing
delegates from the attorney general's office to oversee their
surrender.
   But Giraldo said the Medellin cartel's leader, Pablo Escobar,
would still serve 20 years in prison if he surrendered and
confessed all his crimes.
   The cartel has been blamed for killing about 550 Colombians,
including 250 Medellin police, in terrorist attacks since
government and traffickers declared war on each other in August
1989 after a presidential candidate was assassinated.
   Late last month, drug bosses said between 200 and 300
traffickers were willing to surrender in a heavily fortified
compound protected by the army in exchange for legal guarantees
from the government.
   These include an end to extraditions and not being treated as
criminals.
   The government's decree said cocaine smugglers would have to
confess at least one of their crimes to be eligible for the
benefits. Giraldo said the traffickers would in fact be treated as
criminals.
   He said the government is preparing jail facilities for
surrendering traffickers, to be guarded by the army to protect drug
barons from outside attack.
   Four midlevel traffickers were reported to have already accepted
the government's offer and turned themselves in.
   El Espectador columnist Ramiro de la Espriella on Monday likened
government concessions to the failed policy of appeasing Hitler
before World War II.
   ``Are drug traffickers really going to turn themselves in?
Wouldn't it be more truthful to admit that we're the ones who are
surrendering? And in exchange for what? Chamberlain's peace?'' he
wrote.
   He was referring to British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain,
who championed appeasing Nazi Germany.
   Others also complained that Colombia was going soft on drug
traffickers after having sent them into retreat in an antinarcotics
war fought now for nearly 1{ years.
   ``The massacres, the hundreds of sacrificed policemen, the
soldiers, the judges, the innocent victims of bombs. Their names
also count,'' Espriella wrote.
   The justice minister said the decree was an attempt to end
narco-terrorism by creating new judicial mechanisms.
   ``It is the search for peace through justice,'' Giraldo said.
   He said the police crackdown will continue full force and
``there will be no impunity'' for traffickers.
   The cartel has begun freeing journalists it abducted in the past
three months to show its desire to make peace.
   Four of nine abducted reporters have been released in the past
month, including Orlando Acevedo, a television cameraman freed
Monday in Medellin.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - The U.S. government said Monday the
Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide was the apparent winner of Haiti's
first fully democratic election.
   Widespread victory celebrations, however, were silenced in the
capital when police killed a pregnant supporter of the leftist
priest.
   Bernard W. Aronson, assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, said a U.S. delegation met with Aristide
Monday morning and congratulated him on his victory in Sunday's
balloting.
   The U.S. official cited no figures but said it was clear from
partial returns that Aristide had won without the need for a
runoff.
   ``We fully respect him as the apparent president-elect of Haiti
and look forward to working closely with his government,'' Aronson
said.
   The killing of the woman was the first violence reported in
connection with Sunday's balloting, which international observers
had described as the first fully democratic election in the
Caribbean nation's turbulent 186-year history.
   The independent Electoral Council announced the first official
results Monday evening, 24 hours after most polls closed.
   With 27,227 votes tabulated - slightly more than 1 percent of
the estimated 2 million total - Aristide had 19,181 votes, or 70.6
percent; former World Bank official Marc Bazin, 3,410, or 12.6
percent; agronomist Louis Dejoie Jr., 1,866, or 6.9 percent; and
evangelical preacher Sylvio Claude, 745, or 2.7 percent.
   The seven other candidates each received less than 2 percent of
the vote. The results came from four of the country's nine
provinces.
   Dejoie, son of the late Sen. Louis Dejoie, who lost an
army-controlled election to Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier in 1957,
conceded defeat Monday night, saying: ``We affirm clearly the
people have spoken.''
   Even before the results were known, thousands of jubilant
supporters of Aristide, a charismatic leftist priest, had poured
into the streets of the capital, Port-au-Prince, to celebrate his
anticipated victory.
   Aristide, a 37-year-old firebrand, told the poor during his
campaign that they were following God's will to fight for their
rights.
   He was expelled from the conservative Salesian Order in 1988 for
allegedly inciting class hatred. He has said he would renounce the
priesthood if elected, complying with a Vatican policy that priests
can't hold public office.
   The killing occurred at midday outside St. Jean Bosco Roman
Catholic Church, where Aristide once preached and which was the
site of an attack in September of 1988. In that violence, thugs
armed with machetes, knives and pikes attacked the church during
Mass, killing 12 parishioners and wounding 70.
   In Monday's shooting, witnesses said about half a dozen
policemen wearing gas masks pulled up in a blue police pickup truck
and opened fire on hundreds of Aristide supporters singing and
dancing outside the church, in the La Salines slum.
   Lannis Waters, a photographer for the Palm Beach Post in
Florida, said he saw the policemen in the truck and heard gunfire
but could not tell how many shots were fired into the crowd, or
why. He said the crowd ran in panic.
   From a photograph, the dead woman appeared to be about seven
months' pregnant.
   The celebrations died down nearly everywhere in Port-au-Prince
not long after the shooting was reported on radio.
   Monday night, government-run television showed footage of the
dead woman and broadcast a statement by the military authorities
denying any responsibility for her death.
   Police intervened in the area and fired shots into the air, the
statement said, because demonstrators were threatening to lynch
someone. In Haiti, the military controls the police force.
   Haiti's last attempt to hold democratic elections, on Nov. 29,
1987, collapsed in a bloodbath when thugs supported by the army
shot and hacked to death at least 34 people at polling stations and
in the streets.
   In the only major violence leading up to Sunday's election,
unknown gunmen hurled a grenade and fired bullets into an Aristide
campaign rally on Dec. 5, killing seven people and wounding more
than 50.
   Despite that attack and fears that supporters of the fallen
Duvalier dictatorship would disrupt the election, an estimated 70
percent of eligible voters turned out Sunday.
   About 800 international observers, including former President
Jimmy Carter and 64 unarmed military security advisers, monitored
the election to help prevent fraud and ensure safety.
   Joao de Medicis of Brazil, head of a U.N. election monitoring
team, said Monday the election was fair.
   ``I think it was a very democratic election, a very open
election,'' he said at a news conference. ``There were some
irregularities, but in our opinion, these irregularities did not
affect the result.''
   The new government will replace the caretaker administration of
President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, a Supreme Court justice appointed
in March.
   Bazin, a 58-year-old former World Bank economist seen as the
favorite by the U.S. Embassy and the business community, was
considered Aristide's top rival among his 10 opponents.
   Haitians also elected a 110-member National Assembly and local
officials.
   If no candidate won 50 percent of the vote, a runoff was to be
held Jan. 20. About 3 million voters, 85 percent of the electorate,
were registered to vote.
   A popular uprising overthrew Jean-Claude Duvalier in 1986,
ending the repressive dictatorship that began when Francois
Duvalier assumed office in 1957.
   But there have been a series of coups and failed elections since
then, and a climate of terror fostered by former members of the
Duvalier family militia, the Tonton Macoutes.

   A television news cameraman abducted by
the Medellin cocaine cartel and held 110 days was freed Monday in
what looked like another step toward a peace deal with authorities.
   Orlando Acevedo was the fourth journalist freed by drug
traffickers in a month. Five other reporters are still held.
   A taxi left Acevedo in front of the offices of the Medellin
daily newspaper El Colombiano. He appeared to be in good health,
witnesses said.
   Also on Monday, the government issued a decree paving the way
for a mass surrender by drug traffickers by lifting the threat of
extradition.
   Acevedo carried a statement from the drug lords denying
responsibility for recent terrorism in Medellin.
   They blamed the police and the Cali drug cartel for massacring
12 persons in a Medellin tavern and for exploding a bomb that
injured 10 people over the weekend.
   The attacks were designed ``to create confusion and damage our
sincere efforts for peace,'' the cartel's statement said.

   State planning officials have vetoed a
proposal to use state money to turn a vacant electronics factory
into the world's largest contemporary art museum.
   But one of those same officials said hours later Monday the
project has a chance to proceed.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis was one of the strongest backers of the
proposed Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, or Mass MOCA.
   Last week, the state museum commission approved a scaled-down
version of Mass MOCA, which was originally to cost more than $77
million.
   John I. Carlson, deputy commissioner of the state Division of
Capital Planning and Operations, rejected the revised proposal
Monday, citing problems with the financial arrangements. But later
in the day he released a statement saying he expects the problems
to be worked out.
   ``A pivotal issue here is that if sufficient operating funds are
not available, it is likely that the projected size of the opening
facility may have to be reduced, thus changing all the basic
assumptions,'' he said.
   Museum commission members and the governor's press aides did not
immediately return telephone calls Monday.
   The plan, originally proposed by Thomas Krens, who later became
curator of the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, caught the fancy
of the art world when it was first unveiled four years ago.
   Krens, who was said to be en route from Europe, also could not
be reached. Supporters had said the museum could revitalize the
economy of the small, isolated industrial city of North Adams, a
mill city perched in the Berkshires in the state's far northwest
corner.
   The mayor of North Adamas refused to concede defeat. ``I am
fully confident this will fly despite the incompetence in those two
departments,'' said Mayor John Barrett III, referring to the
capital planning and inspector general offices.
   ``Our governor is still in office and I and very confident he
and his staff will be able to get things under control,'' Barrett
said. ``I've been belted before.''
   But state Rep. Greg Sullivan, one of the museum's most vocal
opponents, hailed the move. The Democrat called the project ``the
worst example of misplaced priorities and upside down logic of the
Dukakis administration.''
   ``We can't deny essential services to mentally retarded and
elderly people while we buy millions of dollars of modern art to be
placed out in the Berkshires,'' Sullivan said.
   Three years ago, the state Legislature authorized $35 million
for the conversion of the 28-building Sprague Electronics Co. mill.
   The funding was contingent upon acceptance of a $1.7 million
feasibility study by state capital planning and finance officials
and the museum commission.
   Carlson said North Adams had failed to come up with its 30
percent share of the construction costs and planners failed to show
that the museum could generate enough income to sustain itself.

<HEAD>Roman Vows Not To Quit, But Other Parties May Join Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN PETREANU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of students and
workers, including airline navigators who halted all domestic
flights, were on strike Monday in an effort to pressure the
government to step down.
   Premier Petre Roman vowed not to quit. But he and President Ion
Iliescu held talks with Radu Campeanu, leader of one of the two
main parliamentary opposition parties, amid indications the
opposition party might join the government.
   The current Cabinet is composed solely of members of the
National Salvation Front, which overwhelmingly won last May's
elections after toppling and executing Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu in the December revolution.
   Critics of the Front, however, accuse it of having many former
Communists.
   Campeanu, leader of the National Liberal Party, demanded last
week that opposition parties join government to broaden support for
tough but needed economic reform and to improve democracy.
   He also demanded that Roman be replaced by a ``neutral''
personality unaffiliated with the Front.
   But Roman, speaking on national television late Sunday, firmly
rejected calls for his resignation and stressed that he had sided
with all those who revolted against Ceausescu.
   ``I took part in the revolution and won along with it, with a
clean conscience and my wrath merged with the people's,'' he said.
``And I will not budge. Unreasonable noise, ambition for power will
not budge me.''
   After meeting Campeanu, Roman said the Front was open to a
``sharing of responsibility in a difficult moment'' for Romania.
   Iliescu told radio he was ``attempting to find a solution for
the participtation of some opposition parties in government.''
   Sources in the National Peasant Party, the other main opposition
party, said they were not part of the emerging deal.
   After the elections six months ago, the two parties refused to
become junior partners in a government led by the Front.
   The Bucharest talks followed Sunday's anti-government protests
to mark the anniversary of the revolution that toppled Ceausescu.
   The demonstrations were far smaller than expected, perhaps
because Roman moved to defuse mounting protest over economic reform
by announcing Dec. 7 that price hikes on foodstuffs planned for
January would be postponed until June.
   Thousands of people, including many workers on strike, flocked
Monday to the Opera Square in the western town of Timisoara,
birthplace of the revolt against Ceausescu.
   Their stoppage and a class boycott estimated to have the support
of about 100,000 students are part of an opposition campaign to get
the government to resign because of its alleged neo-Communist links
and harsh economic reform.
   Price hikes that increased the cost of consumer goods two-and
even threefold Nov. 1 and other economic reforms had fueled the new
wave of anti-government protest as the anniversary of last year's
revolution approached.
   The most serious strike disruption Monday appeared to come from
a stoppage at the national airline Tarom. Domestic flights were
grounded, and international flights took off with huge delays.
   Management announced that in view of a strike by navigators and
other workers, all flights would stop on Wednesday.
   Workers who belong to a free trade union also went on strike
alert at Romania's state-run radio and television network.

   A company is betting Americans so dearly want to
fly in space that they'll pay to enter a sweepstakes for a chance
to win a trip aboard a Soviet rocket and a week on the space
station Mir.
   ``Our long-term business strategy is to arrange for space travel
opportunities for anyone who wishes to go into space,'' James
Davidson, senior vice president of Space Travel Services, said
Monday.
   ``To introduce this service and our company to the general
public, we've arranged for a little sweepstakes. The trip to the
Mir space station is the ultimate adventure.''
   Soviet officials could not be reached Monday to confirm the
announcement. The sweepstakes was announced after business hours in
the Soviet Union.
   Beginning Monday, would-be American cosmonauts can call a 900
telephone number - which will cost them $2.99 per call - to enter a
random drawing. Space Travel gets more than half of that revenue.
   ``You can call as many times as you like, and I wish you
would,'' said Davidson, a marketing expert who is former president
of the Houston Space Society. Sweepstakes rules distributed to
reporters at a news conference indicated no-cost entries could be
sent by mail.
   The winner, to be selected in December 1991, gets six months of
training, including Russian language lessons, and a seat on a
Soviet rocket in late 1992 or early 1993, plus $500,000 cash.
   If the winner chooses, he or she instead can remain on Earth and
opt for a $1.5 million prize.
   In addition to the grand prize, Davidson said 11 additional
candidates would be chosen as potential backup astronauts.
   Reaction to the contest offer was immediate. Thousands of calls
to the 900-telephone number Monday overloaded the service company's
circuits and made the line temporarily inaccessible, company
officials said.
   ``The problem was with our service bureau in Dallas. They were
not prepared for the level of activity our announcement
generated,'' said David Mayer, Space Travel Services' president.
The company said the problem should be corrected by Tuesday.
   Space Travel Services said that because of local laws, people
listing addresses in New York, Florida or Rhode Island would not be
eligible for the flight. Deadline for entering the contest is Dec.
1, 1991.
   The exact cost of the trip was not disclosed, but Mayer,
president of Space Travel Services, said it was more than the $12
million paid by a Japanese broadcast company which recently put a
reporter aboard the station.
   ``That would be difficult for us to get into right now,'' Mayer
said when asked about cost. ``It was a lot.''
   In addition to the revenue from the calls, Davidson said the
company hoped to sell advertising space aboard the spacecraft.
   ``Some of things done in the past are commercial endorsements,
production promotions associated with the spaceflight,'' he said.
``We're intending to pursue those. We're also looking to have our
astronauts endorse products by wearing apparel or by drinking fizzy
beverages as appropriate.''
   ``We also have the broadcast rights to this mission. We'll be
happy to negotiate for that.''
   Company officials said they had checked with U.S. officials and
were told there was nothing illegal about the planned flight. The
National Aeronautics and Space Administration suspended its plans
to have civilians accompany astronauts in space after the 1986
Challenger disaster.
   As for the Soviets, Davidson said the ultimate reason for their
participation is cash.
   ``They realize there was a buck to be made and that's what they
want to do with their space program,'' Mayer said.
   Art Dula, whose Houston-based Space Commerce Corp. markets
Soviet space services in the United States and negotiated the deal
on behalf of Space Travel Services, termed the contract a ``natural
evolutionary activity.''

   Wisconsin prison escapee Lawrencia
Bembenek will file for refugee status in Canada to avoid being
deported to the United States, her lawyer said Monday.
   Officials said the request for refugee status would prevent her
immediate deportation to the United States, where she had been
serving a life sentence for murdering her then-husband's former
wife.
   Bembenek, known as Bambi by her supporters, contends in her
request for refugees status that she was wrongly convicted. Several
Wisconsin courts have rejected that claim and denied her petitions
for a new trial.
   ``Our position is that she was here for some months without
hurting anybody,'' Ron Lester told reporters after a hearing
Monday.
   Lester conceded at the hearing that Bembenek violated Canadian
immigration laws when she moved to Thunder Bay.
   ``If there were no refugee claim, she would have been ordered
deported today,'' Canadian immigration adjudicator Carmen DeCarlo
said Monday in an interview.
   A court appearance was set for Jan. 31 to schedule further
proceedings.
   Bembenek, 32, a former Milwaukee policewoman, escaped July 15
from a prison near Fond du Lac, Wis. She had served eight years for
the 1981 murder of Christine Schultz.
   She was working as a waitress and aerobics instructor in Thunder
Bay when captured in October with fiance Dominic Gugliatto, a
divorced father from Milwaukee accused of helping her escape.
   Gugliatto, 35, was returned to Wisconsin and is free on $100,000
cash bail.

<HEAD>Forecaster Cautious on News Industry Performance in '91</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This year has been a disaster for local ad
spending in newspapers, and the prospects for improvement are not
good without a turnaround in the economy, a prominent industry
forecaster said.
   Robert Coen of the ad agency McCann-Erickson spoke Dec. 10 at
the start of the week-long PaineWebber media conference, at which
major media companies said overall U.S. ad spending this year has
grown at the slowest pace since 1975 and could slow even further
next year.
   Coen said he expects U.S. ad spending will rise 4.9 percent to
$130.1 billion this year and 4.6 percent to $136 billion in 1991.
   Of that, national ad spending will rise 6.7 percent to $73.6
billion this year, while local ad spending will increase a meager
2.8 percent to $56.5 billion.
   Coen attributed the weak local picture to the poor business
environment, deteriorating consumer confidence and spending cuts by
retailers due to their heavy debt loads.
   He said rising unemployment and a sluggish housing market caused
a deepening decline in classified ads and ``made it a disastrous
year'' for local ad spending in newspapers.
   National advertising, on the other hand, was stronger than
expected, partly because of increased competition for market share
in categories such as coffee, credit cards and mutual funds, Coen
said.
   For 1991, Coen said he expects national ad spending growth will
again outpace local ad spending, with national up 5.7 percent and
local rising 3.1 percent.
   ``Until unemployment rates fall and the real estate and housing
sectors turn around, we must continue to be pessimistic about local
ad growth next year,'' Coen said.

   ``Let's not mince words,'' said President Richard D. Simmons.
``1990 has been a simply dreadful year.''
   Simmons said operating earnings will fall to $275 million from
$314 million in 1989, while earnings per share is expected to drop
to $14.25 from $15.50 in 1989.
   He said the soft advertising market produced double-digit
declines in classified and retail advertising volume in the
flagship Washington Post, and that only one of the company's four
TV stations would have results higher than in 1989.

<BYLINE>Tribune Co.</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Daily News strike has cut operating profit
substantially, the company said.
   Nine of the 10 labor unions at the newspaper went on strike Oct.
25, choking circulation and advertising. Also, newsprint operations
were depressed by a strike at a Canadian mill that has just been
resolved.
   The company did not say how much the Daily News strike has cost.
   Chief Financial Officer Scott Smith said operating results are
down by about 20 percent in the last three months of the year
excluding the effect of the strikes, and substantially more if they
are included.
   He said the decline in operating profit for the full year ``will
be substantially larger than 25 percent'' including strike costs.
   Smith told analysts that earnings per share excluding losses at
the Daily News and the newsprint mill should amount to about $3
compared with $3.17 a year ago, and said earnings will be below $3
a share next year.
   Besides the Daily News, Tribune publishes the Chicago Tribune
and five other newspapers, and owns six television stations.

<BYLINE>Gannett Co. Inc.</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Douglas McCorkindale, vice chairman and chief financial officer,
said the slump would drag down revenues and possibly earnings in
1990.
   The declines would be the first such year-to-year drops at
Gannett since the company went public 22 years ago.
   Gannett, which publishes 81 daily newspapers in addition to USA
Today and has interests in television, radio and outdoor
advertising, expects revenue in 1990 to be $3.4 billion to $3.5
billion, McCorkindale said. That would be down from $3.52 billion a
year ago.
   McCorkindale did not offer an earnings projection for the year,
but noted that many analysts estimated it at $2.35 a share, down
from $2.47 a share in 1989.
   Other Gannett executives said that despite circulation gains at
USA Today, up 4 percent to 1.74 million daily, the newspaper would
have a small loss.

<BYLINE>The New York Times Co.</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Walter Mattson, president and chief operating officer, calls
this ``the most difficult year for The New York Times since the mid
70s.''
   He said earnings from continuing operations would be between 80
cents and 90 cents a share in 1990. In 1989, earnings were 87 cents
a share.
   Mattson said he expects an 8 percent decline in ad volume at the
Times and an increase in newsprint and wage costs. But he said ad
rates will rise about 6.5 percent and the company would be
aggressive in boosting circulation revenue.
   Mattson predicted that results from the company's 35 regional
newspapers will be up next year. He said its magazines will
probably have a smaller operating loss, and that operating results
from the broadcasting and information services group, which
includes five TV stations, will be flat.

<BYLINE>Times Mirror Inc.</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Times Mirror Inc. which publishes the Los Angeles Times and
seven East Coast newspapers, said it plans to boost advertising
rates and reduce capital spending next year.
   The company is also trying to cut costs with hiring freezes or
layoffs in some divisions, forgoing a dividend increase for the
first time since 1983 and swearing off major acquisitions.
   Chairman and Chief Executive Robert F. Erburu said the ad slump
has worsened in the fourth quarter and is expected to last into the
new year.
   But he said the main reason for the ad slowdown has been a
cyclical decline in the economy, and the company's cost-cutting
will help it rebound when the economy improves.
   In addition to its newspaper holdings, Los Angeles-based Times
Mirror owns four network-affiliated television stations, publishes
magazines and books and has interests in cable television systems.

   Chairman James Batten said the company expects earnings to go up
modestly in 1990, and has ``a realistic chance for at least a flat
year'' in earnings per share in 1991.
   Robert Singleton, senior vice president for finance, said
revenue is expected to rise 2 percent to 3 percent next year with
slightly higher revenue from newspapers and a double-digit increase
from business information services.
   Knight-Ridder, which owns 29 daily newspapers, including The
Miami Herald and The Philadelphia Inquirer, said it anticipates
earning $2.90 to $2.97 a share in 1990 compared with $2.86 a share
excluding a gain on the sale of a newspaper in 1989.

   Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal and owner of the

excluding a onetime gain.
   Peter Kann, president and chief operating officer, said
financial advertising was off sharply and demand for Telerate
machines at thrifts and brokerages was down.
   The company adopted a plan recently to hold costs to 1990 levels
next year. Kenneth Burenga, general manager and senior vice
president, said the company expects to have 400 fewer employees at
yearend than it had to start 1990. It employed about 10,000 at that
time.
   The cuts include about 150 employees of The Wall Street Journal.

   Chairman William Taylor said he expected earnings from
continuing operations to be down sharply in 1990 from 63 cents a
share in 1989. Industry analysts have estimated earnings at 35
cents to 40 cents a share.
   He said the company will raise the price of The Boston Globe to
50 cents from 35 cents in areas 30 miles outside the city in April.
The price for city editions will be raised as well if warranted, he
said.
   Ad revenue is expected to be flat, he said, as an expected 6
percent decline in volume is offset by increases in ad rates of
about 5.5 percent to 6 percent next year.
   Affiliated also owns trade publications, including Billboard,
Adweek and The Hollywood Reporter.

   Erwin Potts, president and chief executive, said McClatchy's
1990 operating results should about match last year's.
   He said the company is better off than some others in the
industry because its 19 newspapers are in cities that have
withstood the economic slump, such as Sacramento and Modesto,
Calif.
   ``To one degree or another, we are all singing the blues. But
I'm not going to join that chorus,'' he said.

   James P. Sheehan, president and chief operating officer, said

   Chairman and Chief Executive Walter Bartlett said Multimedia's
cable and entertainment businesses have more than offset weaknesses
elsewhere.
   Revenue and income from continuing operations should be higher
this year than in 1989 and show improvement again in 1991, he said.
   Robert E. Hamby Jr., treasurer and chief financial officer, said
the company should meet analysts' earnings forecasts of $3.80 to
$3.90 a share this year, excluding a previously disclosed writeoff
of 25 cents a share.
   The company earned $3.11 a share in 1989.
   Multimedia owns 14 daily and 43 non-daily newspapers, including
papers in Greenville, S.C., Asheville, N.C., and Montgomery, Ala.;
four TV stations and eight radio stations. It has applied for
Federal Communications Commission approval of the purchase of a
51-percent interest in a fifth TV station.
   Bartlett said he expects to boost ad rates by 6 percent to 7
percent next year in the company's newspapers and by 5 percent to 6
percent in cable TV.

<HEAD>Daily News Will Stay Open - For Now - Publisher Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tribune Co. will keep the New York Daily News
open as long as it continues regaining circulation and advertising
lost in a 7-week-old strike, Publisher James Hoge said Dec. 14.
   Hoge, speaking at the PaineWebber media conference, said daily
circulation has reached about 600,000 after sinking as low as
250,000. It was more than 1.09 million before the strike.
   The publisher has previously said the paper lost $115 million
between 1979 and 1989 and that losses by the end of 1990 will rise
to about $200 million.
   Hoge's determination to keep the paper open echoed his
statements earlier in the week after a meeting with the Tribune
board in Chicago.
   After the Dec. 11 meeting, Theodore Kheel, the striking unions'
legal adviser, called the decision ``a form of sheer masochism.''
   ``The News has no hope of survival whatsoever in the absence of
a settlement or sale,'' he said. ``The sooner the board realizes
that, the better everyone, including the Tribune Co., will be.''
   The News, using managers, replacements and employees transferred
from other Tribune Co. newspapers, has continued to publish despite
the 7-week-old strike by 2,100 employees.
   Hoge said the strike is costly ``but not as expensive as trying
to run the paper with all the excess costs and contract abuses that
we had ... in the old contract.''
   Another part of the dispute moved into court Dec. 13, when two
newsstand owners sued the drivers' union, saying it encouraged a
campaign of violence to stop vendors from selling the paper.
   The federal suit, filed on behalf of the city's approximately
12,000 news vendors, seeks more than $30 million in damages from
the Newspaper &amp; Mail Deliverers' Union of New York and its
president, Michael Alvino.
   The Daily News brought a similar racketeering lawsuit against
the unions last month. Both suits detail allegations of ``attempted
murder, arson, assault and vandalism'' and accuse the drivers'
union of ``a long history of racketeering.''
   While the latest lawsuit was being filed, negotiators for both
sides met separately in Washington with the director of the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service, but he reported virtually no
progress toward ending the dispute.
   ``It's been a moving day but, bottom line, no, they're still
quite separated,'' said Bernard E. DeLury.
   He and other federal mediators shuttled between the two sides
for about seven hours in an effort to spur direct talks, but the
only hopeful result was that each agreed to be recalled by him.
   Hoge later called for the appointment of a federal mediator to
force both sides toward a settlement.
   ``What we are in favor of is a very high-powered, supermediator
... to come in and knock everybody's heads together,'' he said Dec.
16 on a local television news program.
   On the same show, Newspaper Guild President Barry Lipton said,
``We're willing to consider anything that will bring about a fair
and equitable settlement.''
   Hoge and Lipton both rejected binding arbitration.

<HEAD>Newsdays Claim 1 Million Combined Circulation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The combined circulations of Newsday, the Long
Island newspaper, and offspring New York Newsday exceeded 1 million
on Dec. 9 for the first time, the joint publisher said.
   Newsday sold 600,000 copies and New York Newsday sold 400,000,
publisher Robert M. Johnson said. Circulation has surged since a
strike at the rival Daily News began Oct. 25.
   Before the Daily News strike began, Sunday circulation had been
562,000 for Newsday and 150,000 for New York Newsday. Since the
strike, the five-day average daily circulation of New York Newsday
has increased from 221,000 to just under 350,000. Newsday's weekday
editions have risen from a prestrike 492,000 to almost 525,000.
   Newsday was founded in 1940. New York Newsday, with a separate
editorial staff, began publishing in 1985. They are owned by Times

<HEAD>Dow Jones Workers Reject Affiliation With Large Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite recent layoffs and cutbacks that have
created apprehension among reporters, Dow Jones &amp; Co. employees
have voted down a proposal to affiliate with a major union.
   Reporters, technicians, clerical workers and other personnel
voted 61 percent to 39 percent against affiliating with the
Communications Workers of America.
   Organizers said Dec. 13 they were unable to capitalize on a mood
of anger and fear over recent layoffs, bureau closings and other
cutbacks at The Wall Street Journal, the business newspaper
published by Dow Jones.
   ``In essence, we were saying that we have a fair-weather union
and we are going into rough weather,'' said Ron Chen, a Journal
copy editor and president of an in-house union, the Independent
Association of Publishers' Employees. ``That message apparently did
not get across.''
   A total of 1,074 of 1,800 members of the in-house union, which
had supported affiliation, participated in the vote, rejecting it
by 655-419.
   Dow Jones employs 9,800 people in all.
   Company President Peter R. Kann said the vote suggested that
workers ``didn't see what additional benefit'' affiliation with a
large union would bring to the employees or the company.
   Dow Jones management had lobbied against the proposal, saying in
a letter to employees that their union dues would triple for some
workers by 1993 and that only 4.5 percent of the CWA's members were
publishing employees.
   Dow Jones, hurt by the recession in the securities and
publishing industries, recently announced it was closing the
Journal's Philadelphia bureau and laid off reporters in Los
Angeles; Houston; Vancouver, British Columbia; New Delhi, India;
Brussels, Belgium; and Seoul, South Korea.
   At least 10 senior employees have taken early retirement
buyouts. Several reporters said they are fearful of further cuts
and angered by the way Dow Jones handled the layoffs.
   The CWA, which has 700,000 members, is trying to expand in the
newspaper industry. In addition to communications workers and
newspaper production employees, it represents editorial workers at
several papers in the United States and Canada.

<HEAD>Anderson's Sister To Visit Beirut in January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The sister of Terry Anderson, the longest-held American hostage
in Beirut, said Dec. 12 that she is going to Lebanon next month and
won't come back without her brother.
   Peggy Say accused the Bush administration of doing too little to
free Anderson and five other American hostages in Beirut.
   ``I know in my dealings with the administration, I have begged
and pleaded and threatened and cajoled and cannot make them act,''
she said.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped nearly six years ago.
   Say said the Rev. Lawrence Martin Jenco, a former Beirut hostage
once held with Anderson, may go to Lebanon with her.
   She said former hostages have told her their Lebanese captors
wanted to release them but would not do so without Iran's approval.
   Iran has refused her an entry visa, ``but I can approach the
Iranians indirectly in Beirut, and I can't fail Terry any longer,''
she said. ``When I go, I want to be prepared and the people with me
to stay for a while because I don't intend to come back without
Terry.''
   As scores of Americans who had been held in Iraq began returning
home last week, Frank Reed, a former hostage in Lebanon, urged the
nation not to forget Anderson and those still held in the Middle
East.
   ``Terry Anderson has now gone through his sixth Thanksgiving and
(is) heading for a sixth Christmas,'' Reed told 100 people gathered
to honor Anderson and the other hostages.
   Reed spoke Dec. 10 in Boston at the second annual ``Celebration
of Hope'' sponsored by Emerson College's Society of Professional
Journalists and the Free Terry Anderson Committee. The ceremony
marked Anderson's 2,096th day of captivity.

<HEAD>Court To Decide News Media Confidentiality Issue in Minneapolis
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether
news media organizations enjoy any constitutional protection
against being sued over broken promises of confidentiality.
   The justices said Dec. 10 they will consider reinstating a
$200,000 award against Minnesota's two largest newspapers won by a
news source whose identity was not kept confidential. The award had
been thrown out by the Minnesota Supreme Court.
   Public relations man Dan Cohen initially won a $700,000 award
against the Star Tribune of Minneapolis-St. Paul and the Saint Paul
Pioneer Press Dispatch.
   A state appeals court ruled that a promise of confidentiality
given to Cohen by a reporter with each newspaper amounted to an
oral contract, but cut the award to $200,000. Cohen's victory was
overturned completely by the state Supreme Court last July.
   Elliot Rothenberg, Cohen's attorney, expressed pleasure at the
U.S. Supreme Court's decision to take up the case. ``The major
issue will be, to what extent does the First Amendment of the
Constitution apply to contract law,'' he said. ``Does it give
newspapers the right to dishonor promises or violate (oral)
contracts with confidential sources?''
   Attorneys for the newspapers said they had not seen the court's
order and could not immediately comment on it.
   The controversy stems from a revelation during the 1982
Minnesota political campaign that Marlene Johnson, a Democratic
Farm Labor candidate for lieutenant governor, once had been
arrested and charged with shoplifting.
   Cohen, who was associated with the campaign of Wheelock Whitney,
the Independent-Republican candidate for governor, provided the
information on the condition he not be identified as the source.
   Reporters for the two papers gave that assurance, but their
editors ordered that Cohen's name be published because, they said,
the public should be told that the information came from someone
linked to Whitney's campaign.
   The same day he was named as the source in the newspaper stories
about Johnson, Cohen was fired from his advertising agency job.
   In voting 4-2 to throw out Cohen's ensuing lawsuit against the
newspapers, the state Supreme Court drew a distinction between
moral and legal obligations. It said promises of confidentiality
did not amount to oral contracts.
   ``To impose a contract theory on this arrangement puts an
unwarranted legal rigidity on a special ethical relationship,'' the
state court said.
   The state court also rejected arguments that Cohen was entitled
to collect monetary damages under a more general legal theory
governing broken promises.
   ``Enforcement of the promise of confidentiality under (such a)
theory would violate defendants' First Amendment rights,'' the
state court said.
   Minnesota's highest court added: ``There may be instances where
a confidential source would be entitled to a remedy ... when the
state's interest in enforcing the promise to the source outweighs
First Amendment considerations, but this is not such a case.''
   The two dissenting state court justices called the ruling ``a
sad day in the history of a responsible press in America.''
   In the appeal acted on Dec. 10, lawyers for Cohen argued, ``This
court has not before accorded media organizations a constitutional
privilege to break promises or contracts with others or to be
immune from generally applicable laws. No one, including the news
media, should be above the law.''
   Lawyers for the two newspapers urged the justices to reject
Cohen's appeal.

<HEAD>Reporter Faces Longer Jail Stint If She Refuses To Testify</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reporter freed after
spending two days in jail could be fined $500 and face up to six
more months behind bars if she refuses to testify at a murder
trial, a district attorney said.
   Libby Averyt of the Corpus Christi Caller-Times was freed Dec. 9
after the prosecution dropped its request that she be jailed.
   Ms. Averyt refused to answer questions in the pre-trial hearing
of Jermarr Arnold, whose was accused of murder.
   Nueces County District Attorney Grant Jones said Dec. 10 that
Ms. Averyt could be fined $500 and face up to six months in jail if
she refuses to testify at the trial.
   Jones said her testimony could help him in his pursuit of the
death penalty during the punishment phase of the trial, if Arnold
is convicted.
   The prosecutor said Ms. Averyt should be made to testify about
the entire interview, including portions not published.
   District Judge Eric Brown ordered Ms. Averyt jailed on contempt
charges after she refused to answer 12 questions about
conversations she had with Arnold, invoking the First Amendment and
similar provisions of the Texas Constitution.
   Ms. Averyt and the newspaper's attorney, Jorge Rangel,
maintained that journalists should not be compelled to reveal
information obtained from news sources if that information was not
published.
   Arnold is standing trial for the 1983 slaying of a jewelry store
clerk.
   In the articles, Arnold was quoted as saying he shot the clerk
and describing the shooting and robbery.
   The articles quote Arnold saying he feels no remorse for the
clerk's death and that he deserves the death penalty.

   People convicted of misdemeanors in Judge
William White's court can get more than a fine: The judge has
ordered some to take out newspaper ads about their crimes.
   White said he imposed the unusual punishment Dec. 14 on about a
dozen people convicted of soliciting for immoral purposes, drunken
driving and shoplifting.
   The county judge said he was worried about the annual rise in
drunken driving and theft arrests during the holiday season and the
growing threat of AIDS. White said he hoped the ads would serve as
a deterrent.
   ``When you've got an AIDS epidemic, they're not just risking
their life,'' White said of those convicted of soliciting for sex.
``They're risking everybody's life.''
   He ordered advertisements, measuring one column by 2 inches, be
placed in the Pensacola News Journal, the city's only daily
newspaper.
   News Journal Publisher Kenneth W. Andrews said he has consulted
with lawyers and not yet decided whether to accept the ads.

<HEAD>USA Today Considering Baseball Weekly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USA Today will decide by the end of the year
whether to publish a weekly tabloid about baseball, President Tom
Curley said.
   Curley said Dec. 13 that a task force is looking into the
possibility of a publication with the tentative title USA Today
Baseball Weekly.
   If the company decides to proceed, it would be launched during
spring training.
   The tabloid would provide more statistics than can be published
in the regular sports section of the five-day-a-week national
newspaper, Curley said.
   ``There is an opportunity to provide more depth in all sorts of
basic sports coverage, from viewing to participating to
statistics,'' he said.
   James Goss, a newspaper business analyst at the New York
investment firm of Dustin Phelps, said sports coverage is
considered one of USA Today's strong points and the weekly would
provide ``a way to get some more mileage out of what they are
putting together anyway for the newspaper.''
   Goss said also that The National, the New York-based daily
sports paper launched in a number of markets beginning last
January, might be cutting into USA Today markets and this could be
a factor in the decision.
   Curley, however, said, ``That's old news by now.'' He said the
tabloid, if it is launched, might provide USA Today with ``a sixth
day, in effect.''

<HEAD>Detroit Papers Raising Ad Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Detroit News and Free Press will raise
advertising rates from 4 percent to 7 percent on Jan. 1 to offset
increased operating and fuel costs.
   Joseph Ungaro, chief executive of the Detroit Newspaper Agency,
said Dec. 13 the newspapers also would make several changes
designed to increase circulation, improve service and make ads more
effective.
   The new ad rates will include a 4 percent increase for
distribution of preprinted inserts, and increases of 6 percent and
7 percent for advertising space inside daily and weekend
newspapers, respectively, Ungaro said.
   ``We realize that we cannot ask advertisers to pay more without
finding ways to give them more,'' Ungaro said.
   He said the newspapers will feature improved Business Monday,
Weekend, Showtime, Travel and Real Estate sections; a new press
schedule to allow printing of more late sports scores; and plant
expansion for improved handling of advertising inserts.
   The company, which oversees a joint operating agreement between
the News and Free Press, also is considering higher subscription
rates for people outside the Detroit area, Ungaro said.
   He said the ad price increases came because of higher gasoline
prices, increased labor costs and an expected increase in the cost
of newsprint.

   Newspaper vending machines would be
closely regulated under town policy set to go into effect Jan. 7,
Mayor Don Maddux said.
   ``The machines are becoming too prolific right now,'' the mayor
said. ``I don't think Lancaster is the type of city that wants to
have the big city atmosphere of having vending machines where they
are.''
   Newspaper companies would have to have permits to set up racks.
The city of 35,500 is 25 miles southeast of Columbus.
   City Law Director John Huddle said he was unaware the mayor was
drafting a policy on the matter.
   ``At first glance, he may have gone too far,'' Huddle said.
``There is no question in my mind that we can regulate it (use of
public property for newspaper machines) but the question is in the
reasonableness of it.''
   Newspapers sold through vending machines in the city include the
Lancaster Eagle-Gazette, The Columbus Dispatch, The Fairfield
Leader, The Wall Street Journal and USA Today.
   Eagle-Gazette Publisher Russell L. McCauley called the mayor's
proposal ``ridiculous, because it will restrict free trade.''
   Angelo Juarez, director of marketing services for The Columbus
Dispatch, said, ``It seems to me that what the mayor is doing there
is a violaion of our constitutional rights.''

<HEAD>Activists Pose as Reporters, State Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-hunting activists are posing as
reporters to get information about Montana's buffalo hunt, a state
wildlife official said.
   Robert R. Martinka, regional supervisor for the state Department
of Fish, Wildlife and Parks in Bozeman, has written a letter to
prospective hunters about bogus reporters.
   The letter went to the first 250 applicants drawn for the hunt,
which targets buffalo that wander into Montana from Yellowstone
National Park. People who oppose the hunt came into the department
office and copied the names, Martinka said in the Dec. 4 letter.
   ``We wanted to inform you in the event you were contacted
directly by these individuals or by the media,'' Martinka wrote.
``If you are contacted, you have the option of not responding or
saying whatever you choose. However, please keep in mind that what
you say may be used in a way you did not intend or in a way that is
detrimental to the long-term interests of hunting.''
   In a telephone interview with the Great Falls Tribune, Martinka
said Dec. 7 that a Fund for Animals member sought information last
year by posing as a member of the press. Others suspected of being
activists identified themselves as working for The New York Times,
an outdoor magazine and a San Francisco newspaper, Martinka said.

<HEAD>VDT Safety Rules Approved in San Francisco</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's Board of Supervisors has given
initial approval to what could become the nation's only law
regulating video display terminals in the workplace.
   The measure tentatively approved Dec. 10 would require employers
with 15 or more employees to provide adjustable work stations,
mandatory 15-minute breaks and safety education for workers.
   Private and government offices would have two years to comply
with the VDT safety rules if the ordinance is approved a second
time by the supervisors and signed by Mayor Art Agnos. A second
hearing was scheduled for Dec. 17.
   ``This is the new age of safety and health legislation,'' said
Supervisor Nancy Walker.
   She compared the VDT safety ordinance to landmark laws at the
turn of the century that set work standards such as eight-hour days
and compensation for overtime.
   ``We are once again on the cutting edge of something that others
have been unable to do,'' she added. ``And we're taking heat from
that.''
   The only other such ordinance, in Suffolk County, N.Y., was
successfully challenged by business owners who said only the state
could impose such rules.
   The San Francisco ordinance passed 8-1. Supervisor Tom Hsieh
cast the lone dissenting vote, saying it was too costly and more
information on VDT problems should be gathered.
   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health said
VDT workers often suffer headaches, general malaise, eye strain and
musculoskeletal problems caused by poor work station design that
results in awkward hand, head and limb positions.
   Under the ordinance, VDT operators would get a 15-minute break
every two hours. Work stations would have to have proper artificial
lighting and be out of direct sunlight. Adjustable swivel chairs
and document holders must be provided. Computer terminals would
have to have detachable keyboards and adjustable, non-glare
screens, among other safety features.
   Additionally, businesses would have to provide workers, at their
request, with arm, wrist and foot rests that aid in proper
placement of limbs and joints while working on a VDT.
   Jim Lazarus, vice president of the San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce, said the business group opposes the ordinance because it
would cost too much to comply ``especially during an economic
downturn.''
   City budget analysts estimate it would cost San Francisco about
$1.6 million to retrofit VDT work stations. Private businesses
would probably pay some $36 million to comply with the ordinance,
they said.

sexual assault,'' Peterson said.
   Peterson said police have told newspaper editors Kashani made up

   A lawyer who once worked on the Iran-Contra

   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan said Dec. 12 that lawyer

   The book is scheduled for publication by Viking next year,
according to Penguin, Viking's parent corporation.
   Walsh claims the book improperly discloses staff discussions and
internal memos and violates grand jury secrecy. Keenan ruled that
Walsh has the right to see the documents Toobin collected while
working for the special prosecutor to determine whether there is
evidence for his charges.
   The lawsuit denies that the book contains illegal disclosures,
and asks Keenan to bar Walsh from doing anything to prevent
distribution of the book.
   Another hearing is scheduled for Jan. 3.
   Toobin, 30, currently is an assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British Broadcasting Corp. has announced plans
for a television version of its World Service radio broadcasting.
  The new service, BBC-TV International, probably will be launched
in the spring and could become a full world service by the end of
the century, the corporation's chief executive, Chris Irwin, said
Dec. 16.
   It will be linked to another new service, BBC World Service
Television News, which will provide TV news in various languages
and incorporate video from the U.S. network NBC and the Visnews
news agency, the BBC said.
   The new services will be based on an existing satellite service,
BBC-TV Europe, which uses the Intelsat satellite to beam programs
into nearly 7 million European homes, the BBC said.
   The widely respected World Service radio programming, financed
by the government, is broadcast around the world in many languages
and reaches a reported audience of 120 million.

<HEAD>Anti-Tobacco, Anti-Alcohol Bill Becomes Law in France</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French Senate on Dec. 13 voted into law
measures that will raise the price of cigarettes and place strict
curbs on advertising of tobacco and alcoholic beverages.
   The law forbids all forms of direct or indirect tobacco
advertising beginning Jan. 1, 1993, orders hikes in the price of
cigarettes and removes cigarettes from the list of products used to
calculate the consumers' price index.
   It is less severe on alcohol, taking into account the concerns
of legislators from wine-growing regions, who forced the rejection
in October of stiffer measures in another version of the bill.
   The final version permits alcohol advertising in wine-producing
regions, in the written press aimed at adults and in certain radio
broadcasts.
   The law strictly forbids sponsorship of alcoholic beverages or
tobacco by companies in sports or other events.

<HEAD>Popular Leningrad Anchorman Shot by `Informant'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The popular young anchorman of a news program on
Leningrad television was shot in the chest by a gunman claiming he
wanted to turn over secret documents, the independent Interfax news
agency reported.
   Alexander Nevzorov, host of ``600 Seconds,'' was being treated
at the city's Military Medical Academy, but his wound was not life
threatening, Interfax said Dec. 13.
   Nevzorov received a telephone call after the Dec. 12 broadcast
from an unidentified man who said he had secret documents to give
him for a story, according to Interfax.
   The report said Nevzorov refused to go to the meeting alone, but
the caller insisted his companions remain at least 50 yards away
from them.
   Interfax said Nevzorov's companions heard a gunshot and rushed
to the anchorman.
   ``600 Seconds,'' Leningrad TV's No. 1-rated program, has
developed a reputation for tackling the Soviet bureaucracy, and
city viewers have dubbed it ``our city scandal-monger.''
   The fast-paced show, which made its debut in December 1987,
features a large dose of crime stories, tempered by the bizarre and
offbeat, such as a feature on the city's dirtiest toilet.
   Nevzorov, who is in his early 30s, is the show's creator and
main anchor.

<HEAD>FCC May Pave Way for More Local Regulation of Cable TV Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission is
proposing rules to give cities more authority over basic cable
television rates.
   Cable systems already pay millions in franchising fees, provide
community access channels and make certain other public service
commitments. But critics claim cable systems have raised prices
inordinately, while providing poor service to subscribers.
   The House in September adopted legislation that would have given
the FCC power to regulate basic cable services, but the measure
stalled in the waning days of the Congress and did not pass the
Senate.
   The new proposals redefine what constitutes ``effective
competition'' for a cable system. The companies now can avoid rate
regulation of their ``basic tier'' of service if they have
effective competition, which the FCC defines as three over-the-air
broadcast stations covering the cable system's community.
   The new rules would raise that number of competing stations
required, effectively bringing many more cable systems under rate
regulation.
   Following a period of public comment, the FCC will adopt final
rules sometime next year.

   The study examines Iraq's performance in the Iran-Iraq war that

Sunday to cast ballots for what could be the first free elected

   The elections were peaceful, though hampered by delays in the

hundreds of voters simmering in long lines under the sun, and
leading some to charge fraud.
   No official figures were expected to be available until later

   That's just some of the impact of the Clean Air Act on Portland,

   Because Portland, like so many other cities, struggles with an

   So far, the products are heavily dependent on nuts for snacks.
But promoters are hoping to expand to a broader range of consumer

   The idea is to make sure that the world's rain forests are worth
more standing - and producing sustainable harvests - than cut for
timber or cleared for pasture.

   Belgium has brought back Mr. Energy and Japan even

   A decade after Europe's last oil crisis, Belgium is reviving

   A new spirit of conservation is emerging in Western Europe and

   ``There's a lot of encouragement going around; there's the
feeling that oil demand has to be curbed,'' said Peter Bogin,
assistant director for oil markets at Cambridge Energy Research
Associates in Paris.
   ``What's important is that that's a feeling that hasn't existed
for the past five years.''
   Western Europe and Japan generally have not suffered severely
from the rise in oil that followed the Iraqi seizure of Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   Their economies have generally had higher growth than the U.S.
economy. The dollar, the currency in which oil prices are set, is
relatively cheap and world oil supplies have remained fairly
constant.
   What the crisis has done is jar rich nations into realizing
their risk if war breaks out, and many are trying to curb their
thirst for oil.
   In Italy, the government has decided to tighten enforcement of
speed limits and pay 30 percent of energy-saving investments in
homes or industries. It plans to invest in nuclear power research
and spend $2.7 billion on extending bus and subway networks.
   Japan has urged its people to drive slower, keep building
thermostats at 68 degrees and curtail the schedules of 24-hour
stores and TV stations.
   Companies and individuals in France are allowed to write off 100
percent of energy-saving investments.
   The measures are new versions of those introduced in the early
1970s, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
quadrupled oil prices.
   That oil shock, and another in 1979-80, forced draconian
measures in oil-dependent Europe.
   Some governments banned Sunday driving or forced restaurants to
close early. Street and store lights were dimmed, and customers
sometimes shopped by candlelight.
   Europe now sees the results of its investments in alternative
energy: France, for example, gets more than 80 percent of its
electricity from nuclear plants. Norway exports electricity from
its hydroelectric plants.
   Even so, cheap petroleum and good economic times have encouraged
Europeans and Japanese in recent years to increase their use of oil
and buy bigger cars.
   ``People thought energy was cheap and would stay cheap,
forgetting that all the conditions for instability were there,''
said Joao Vale de Almeida, energy spokesman for the European
Community. ``You only needed someone to pull the trigger, which Mr.
Saddam did.''
   According to the International Energy Agency, imported oil
accounts for 18.8 percent of primary energy needs in the United
States, 30.6 percent in Western Europe and 59 percent in Japan.
Two-thirds of Japan's oil comes from the Persian Gulf.
   Many developed countries are drawing up emergency energy plans.
   Greece is printing gasoline rationing coupons in case of war in
the gulf. The Netherlands may bring back Sunday driving bans and
gas rationing if supplies decline.
   ``Every country is envisaging tougher measures,'' said Nobuyashi
Yokoe, director of the Emergency Systems Division at the
International Energy Agency in Paris.
   The European Community has proposed a long-term conservation
program and new taxes on oil and coal.
   As Vale de Almeida put it: ``The question now is, even when the
crisis is solved, what should we do in order to avoid falling into
the same kind of situation in the future?''
   In Italy, which gets 58 percent of its energy from oil,
electricity rates are going up and the government has reversed its
anti-nuclear policy, launching a $500 million research project.
Officials say the government will maintain the high price of
gasoline - now $5.30 a gallon - even if oil prices fall.
   Italian authorities hope high costs will restrain a motor-mad
population. France, Sweden and some other countries have reported
lower demand for gasoline.
   Oil analyst Bogin said a long-term change in driving habits is
unlikely in Europe, where gasoline already is heavily taxed,
because ``they're used to paying such outrageous prices.''

   The world's poor nations have been dealt
a staggering economic blow by Saddam Hussein's occupation of Kuwait
and the higher oil prices it created.
   Countries struggling to climb out of poverty are having to cope
with losses in the billions of dollars.
   Rising prices of gasoline and other petroleum products have
affected every sector of their economies. Inflation abounds, trade
has suffered and foreign exchange reserves are shrinking.
   ``It's a big blow,'' said Gene Tidrick, a World Bank economist
in New Delhi. ``The big problem is uncertainty. No one knows for
how long this will last.''
   Many developing nations find the U.N. embargo of trade with Iraq
and occupied Kuwait has affected their exports.
   The International Monetary Fund estimates the crisis cost
African nations $2 billion in 1990.
   India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka stand to lose a total
of more than $2.5 billion in 1990. All four import oil, had strong
trade links with Iraq and Kuwait and received remittances from
thousands of citizens working in the two nations.
   Economists in New Delhi project a loss of more than $2.5 billion
for India alone if the crisis continues until March.
   Brazil's oil bill has risen $1.2 billion. Philippine government
efforts to cope with the problem prompted demonstrations against
President Corazon Aquino.
   Here is a review of some developing countries and how they are
affected:
   BANGLADESH - A continuing crisis in the gulf would cost more
than $500 million a year: $150 million in lost remittances from
workers, $222 million in higher oil prices and $150 million in lost
exports and tax revenue, mostly from tea and jute sales.
   BRAZIL - The oil bill has doubled to $600 million a month,
inflation is rising and many Brazilian companies with projects in
Iraq had to abandon them.
   CHILE - About $200 million has been added to the 1990 oil bill
and an oil stabilization fund has been established, primarily with
money from an increase in the price of copper, Chile's main export.
   EGYPT - Lost revenues totaled $6.7 billion because of a decline
in the tourist industry, reduced income from the Suez Canal and an
end to remittances from 400,000 Egyptians working in Iraq and
Kuwait. The United States and Persian Gulf nations wrote off
Egyptian debts of $13.7 billion, however, and the rise in oil
prices helped Egypt, an oil exporter.
   HUNGARY - Total losses are about $200 million, officials say,
including $145 million Iraq owes Hungary and $55 million in
canceled contracts. Not included is $120 million in higher prices
for oil, most of which comes from the Soviet Union.
   INDIA - Economists say the cost will reach $2.72 billion by the
end of the fiscal year in March, including $2.3 billion in
increased oil imports, $220 million in lost remittances from
workers and $167 million in lost exports. Foreign exchange reserves
fell to less than $2 billion in November. The government has
increased gasoline prices 25 percent and is trying to get a loan
from the International Monetary Fund.
   KENYA - Fuel prices have risen 30 percent. Vice President George
Saitoti asked Kenyans to limit driving and stop buying imported
goods.
   PAKISTAN - All Pakistan's refined oil products came from Kuwait.
Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said the crisis is costing $33 million
a month and analysts say annual inflation could reach 20 percent.
About $2 billion has been added to the foreign debt of $15.5
billion.
   PHILIPPINES - Filipinos held street protests in response to Mrs.
Aquino's efforts to raise the prices of petroleum products by an
average 45 percent. She later rolled back some increases. The
Philippines has lost remittances from 30,000 citizens who returned
from jobs in Iraq and Kuwait.
   SRI LANKA - Officials put the cost for 1990 at $130 million and
say the annual inflation rate might surpass 20 percent. Many of the
90,000 Sri Lankans working in the gulf region have returned home
and losses of remittances are expected to reach $53 million. Higher
oil prices will raise the energy bill by $87 million.
   ZAMBIA - Fuel costs have more than doubled, causing the prices
of transportation, food and other necessities to soar.
   ZIMBABWE - Energy cost about $400 million in 1990, nearly double
the previous figure. President Robert Mugabe recommended that
developing nations pool energy resources and technology to blunt
the impact.

   Benazir Bhutto says she is ready to
do battle with the political and legal troubles that accompanied
her dismissal as prime minister.
   After her election defeat in October, opponents and some
supporters predicted she would move to Britain or the United States
and try to rebuild a career shattered by charges of corruption,
misconduct and incompetence.
   In her autobiography, ``Daughter of the East,'' Ms. Bhutto wrote
of the grief-stricken young woman who went into exile after her
father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was overthrown and
hanged. Years later, she returned triumphantly and became the first
woman to lead a modern Moslem nation.
   This time, the 37-year-old former prime minister says she'll
fight on her home turf.
   ``I have no desire to live abroad,'' she said in an interview.
``I want to live in my own country, come what may.
   ``I certainly plan to go abroad, not once but several times a
year, but I certainly don't intend to go into exile. I denied it,
and yet stories are fed to the press that I'm planning to go abroad
and bargaining for the release of my husband.''
   Asif Ali Zardari, a flamboyant businessman who became Ms.
Bhutto's husband in a December 1987 wedding arranged by her mother,
has been blamed for the political downfall of his wife and her
Pakistan People's Party.
   Zardari, a 38-year-old member of Parliament, has been jailed in
Karachi since early October for alleged involvement in the
kidnapping and extortion of a British businessman. He has yet to be
formally charged and has been denied bail twice.
   Associates say the emotional strain of her husband's confinement
has taken a toll on Ms. Bhutto. They have a 2-year-old son and an
11-month-old daughter.
   If her record of the past decade is an indication, Ms. Bhutto
will confront her detractors rather than leave politics.
   With her family life at stake and proposed legislation to make
death by hanging the penalty for kidnapping, however, Western
diplomats and some associates say Ms. Bhutto's priority is getting
Zardari released.
   ``I am not bargaining for the release of my husband,'' she said
in the interview. ``My husband is an innocent person. He is in jail
because he happens to be my husband. He is seen as a convenient
weapon by which to blackmail and pressure me.
   ``I proposed to him in August that he should go abroad because
they were bound to imprison him, but he refused. He has always
tried to cheer me up and says, `Don't worry.' Of course I'm
worried, but being worried doesn't mean you change your commitment.
I was also worried when my father was in jail, but it doesn't mean
that you can be intimidated.''
   When she is not attending her husband's court hearings, Ms.
Bhutto is trying to rally party workers and going over the events
that prompted President Ghulam Ishaq Khan to dismiss her government
Aug. 6, after only 20 months.
   Three months after the dismissal came a humilitating defeat in
the elections. She still contends the vote was rigged, but gets
little support for the view from independent observers.
   ``There has been a lot of time for reflection,'' she said.
``Certainly, one has reflected to a great degree on the past and
how things could have been done differently - although the nagging
feeling remains that, even if things were done differently, the
hostility and bias on the side of the president was so great that
it would still come out the same.
   ``He did not give us a chance to govern, and I believe that he
will not give a chance to the new government to function. I was an
outsider, but even (new Prime Minister) Nawaz Sharif, who is
considered a blue-eyed boy of the establishment, is not being given
a chance to rule. Even the Cabinet was imposed on him by the
president.''
   Ms. Bhutto faces eight charges of misconduct and abuse of power
filed with special corruption tribunals. Many observers, supporters
and critics believe she will be convicted and barred from politics
for as long as seven years.
   If that happens, the 39 other Pakistan People's Party members of
the 217-seat National Assembly will resign. They have given their
letters of resignation to Ms. Bhutto.
   ``It is up to the government to decide whether it wants the
fulcrum of the opposition inside the Parliament or outside it,''
she said.
   ``If they think they can silence the voice of the people by
disqualifying the leader of the opposition, then fine. Parliament
will have no legitimacy. And if the Parliament has no legitimacy,
then the government will also have no legitimacy.''
   Many diplomats and associates say Ms. Bhutto is too preoccupied
with legal problems, both her own and those of her husband, to be
the strong opposition leader Pakistan needs.
   They contend she still has not learned from her mistakes, come
to grips with election defeat or been able to galvanize the
Pakistan People's Party, once Pakistan's most progressive political
force.
   Ms. Bhutto denies all that and says she will fight for electoral
reform, human rights and helping democracy take root in a country
that has spent more than half its 43 years under military rule.
   ``As I have seen in my life, changes do come about,'' she said.
``What is important is to keep your commitment and fight for
principles.''
   ``I have passed through many difficult periods ... and this is
not the worst time for me.''

<HEAD>Four Decades of Temperament and Talent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first well-wishing letters
arrived days before her birthday. And so did a birthday present, a
collection of albums prepared by a friend who went through seven
suitcases full of critiques ``that had been sort of dumped into the
basement.''
   Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, who turned 75 on Dec. 9, seems to have
lost little of the temperament she showed as Elvira in Mozart's
``Don Giovanni.'' It was one of the soprano's operatic parts that
won her international acclaim as did her lieder recitals.
   Despite a recent bout with flu, her voice was strong and clear
as she recalled some highlights of a career that spanned four
decades of performing, which she is continuing as a teacher of
young talent.
   She spoke in a rare interview at her home near Zurich. Records
and music books lined a wall in her living room. A large unframed
photograph on the mantelpiece showed her as a stunningly beautiful
Countess in Richard Strauss' ``Capriccio.''
   ``I did not want to teach at all,'' she said. ``But I think I
owe it to all those who helped me in my life to pass on what I know
will be asked from these young artists later on in life.''
   Teaching, she said, allows her to use her most important asset -
analyzing a singer.
   As a teen-ager, a wrong analysis by her first teacher nearly
thwarted her ambitions. ``She thought I was a contralto,''
Schwarzkopf said. ``I was only too pleased because I loved that
kind of very dark sounding singing, but it would have ruined my
voice.'' Her mother, who had a very critical ear, finally made her
change teachers.
   Her operatic debut came in 1938 at Berlin's Opernhaus as a
flower maiden. ``I learned overnight,'' she recalled in rapid,
fluent English.
   Schwarzkopf attracted the attention of Maria Ivoguen, a famous
Hungarian soprano, who gave her private lessons. Ivoguen added a
new dimension to the young protegee's voice by teaching her to sing
lieder.
   Tuberculosis forced her to rest for a year when she was rising
to fame in her native Germany in World War II. But the illness also
let her escape the most devastating Allied bombing attacks on
Berlin.
   ``I kept my music in the air raid shelter so I could also learn
during the alerts,'' she said.
   Following recovery in 1944, she could sing only a few weeks of a
new engagement at Vienna's State Opera before the curtain fell on
all stages because of Allied bombings.
   The postwar period began in a ``lovely room on top of a chicken
ranch'' on Austria's Lake Atter, she recalled. American CARE
parcels were her pay for entertaining GIs at a nearby hospital, she
said, as she hummed Gershwin's ``Summertime'' in recollection.
   Her reputation grew rapidly throughout Europe, with Salzburg,
Bayreuth and Milan's La Scala among early milestones.
   ``She showed that the human voice can be as much an instrument
of phrasing as the violin,'' wrote an enthralled critic after
Schwarzkopf's first appearance in London's Covent Garden in 1947
with the Vienna State Opra company.
   Her U.S. debut came in 1953, after her marriage to Walter Legge,
artistic director of a major British recording company. It was
limited to one recital evening in the packed New York Town Hall and
drew resounding applause from audience and critics.
   She had become an international star with conductors including
Wilhelm Furtwaengler, George Szell, Otto Klemperer, Karl Boehm and
Herbert von Karajan.
   Boehm was the easiest to work with, she said. With von Karajan,
in the later years, it was more difficult because he was ``changing
the rehearsed tempi every time and, wow - if you didn't constantly
look at him.''
   She vividly described a visit to the home of aging Arturo
Toscanini when the maestro complained about the slow tempi German
conductors used in ``Magic Flute,'' especially for Pamina's aria.
   ``He started conducting it immediately with his forefingers,''
Schwarzkopf recalled. ``And he said, `Sing, sing Pamina's aria.' It
was much faster than we ever heard it before but I went along. And
then he said, `This is how it should be done, you see.'''
   She named the Marschallin in Richard Strauss' ``Der
Rosenkavalier'' and Fiordiligi in Mozart's ``Cosi Fan Tutte'' as
some of her favorite parts, along with the Countess in
``Capriccio.''
   ``I was always horrified at the two arias of the Countess but if
a singer isn't horrified it won't be good,'' she said.
   She bade farewell to the stage in 1971 in Brussels, Belgium,
with ``Der Rosenkavalier,'' but she continued singing lieder, where
many critics considered her peerless. Her recitals of Wolf,
Schubert, Bach and others continued to attract audiences until her
last appearance in Zurich in 1979, three days before her husband
died.
   Schwarzkopf is concerned about what she feels is a lack of
knowledge about classical music among many young people. ``Many
have the gift of musicality, but they are never exposed to it,''
she said.
   ``Leonard Bernstein did it with those concerts for children. He
did a great, great service to music. I wish it were done in all
places where there is an orchestra. I know that if young people
ever get exposed to it once, they would know that are other realms
of beauty than the disco.''

   If Paul Hogan has a personality, he must remove
it prior to giving interviews and stow it in a dark closet.
   Because even though Hogan's life story should evoke fascinating
discussion, 30 minutes with the movie star is about as exciting as
spending an afternoon going over premiums with an insurance
salesman.
   The life and times of Paul Hogan are so extraordinary that they
sound more like a high-concept screenplay. It's the story of a
construction worker who left school at 14 and entered show business
relatively late in life on a lark and a lot of chutzpah.
   But extracting the story from Hogan, who sat for a recent
interview to plug his latest movie, ``Almost an Angel,'' was no
easy task. Hogan rationed smiles and anecdotes as if they were
coupons for gas and butter during World War II.
   When he was a 31-year-old outrigger and father of five working
on the Sydney Harbour Bridge, he contacted an Australian TV show
not unlike the now defunct ``Gong Show'' in the United States. It
was an amateur talent show called ``New Faces,'' in which
contestants were often ridiculed by a panel of judges.
   Hogan decided to turn the tables on the judges. To that end, he
portrayed himself as a knife-throwing tap dancer from the
Australian Outback. The show's producers believed him and booked
him on the show.
   ``They were looking for new talent but they were often very
cruel,'' said Hogan. ``I thought it'd be nice to give them a dose
of their own medicine. I didn't have any other ambitions at all.''
   Hogan went on the show - live - and proceeded to needle and
insult each of the judges the way they normally did the
contestants.
   Switchboards lit up and a star was born.
   But it was a reluctant star. Hogan says he never had any
interest in show business as a career, and returned to work on the
bridge the next day. He even turned down an offer to return to the
show but changed his mind when they offered him money.
   ``I never took it seriously,'' said Hogan, who is now 50. ``I
never thought it would last.''
   More appearances on the show followed, Hogan graduated to spots
on other shows and was given his own. ``The Paul Hogan Show'' was
eventually syndicated all over the world and made ``Hoges'' one of
Australia's top stars.
   His commercials in the United States for Australian tourism, in
which he greeted the audience with a ``G'day, mate'' and offered to
``throw a shrimp on the barbie,'' paved the way for the
overwhelming success of his two ```Crocodile' Dundee'' films.
   Though he never went through high school, he wrote the majority
of sketches on his Australian show and wrote and produced the two
``Dundee'' films.
   All in all, he sounds like a helluva guy, the kind of fellow who
could drink you under the table at some tough Sydney pub and keep
you in stitches.
   Guess again.
   Seated in an elegant suite at the Plaza Hotel, where his
character stayed in ```Crocodile' Dundee,'' Hogan appeared
surprisingly small. He wore a simple shirt, jeans and cowboy boots.
His manner was serious and fairly grim.
   Hogan had decreed that no photographer be present so as not to
interrupt the flow of the interview. In fact, a few flashbulbs
might have livened up things.
   He did allow that he's enjoyed his last 18 years in show
business and says he has no idea what would have happened had he
not followed his impulse and appeared on ``New Faces.''
   ``Job satisfaction is the most important thing,'' said Hogan.
``Up until I was 30, I worked just to stay alive.''
   His second wife, Linda Kozlowski, 34, who co-starred with him on
both ```Crocodile' Dundee'' movies and ``Almost An Angel,'' was out
Christmas shopping on Fifth Avenue during the interview.
   Hogan divorced his wife of more than 25 years to marry
Kozlowski. They split their time between a home in Bangalore in New
South Wales and a rented home in Los Angeles.
   Though Hogan said the supermarket tabloids played up his divorce
and remarriage, he complained only that ``if you have a private
life, you find yourself judged.''
   These days, he said, the tabloids seemed to have grown bored
with him.
   Hard to understand why.

<HEAD>Administration Sharpening Political Line on Gulf Policy</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While it won't happen, President Bush has said
he'd welcome a special session of Congress called by its Democratic
leaders to ``strongly endorse what I'm doing'' in the confrontation
with Iraq.
   Vice President Dan Quayle adds that if Congress isn't going to
do that, it ought to keep quiet.
   John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, said most
members of the House and Senate want to state their opinions on
Persian Gulf policy, but don't want to have to cast an up-or-down
vote on it.
   With messages like those, the Republican administration is
sharpening the political line on Persian Gulf policy, disputing its
critics and trying to prevent Democrats from positioning themselves
as the peace party.
   It's not a party line issue, nor is there significant dissent on
the U.S. objective of getting Iraq out of Kuwait. There are
differences on tactics and especially on timing - whether to wait
while economic sanctions punish Iraq, or send troops to liberate
Kuwait after Jan. 15, the United Nations deadline for withdrawal.
   Bush has made the latter, offensive action course one of his
options. An array of Democratic leaders, in and out of Congress,
prefers to wait longer for the sanctions to work.
   In a White House-approved speech, Quayle accused congressional
Democrats of playing politics with the Persian Gulf in Senate
hearings that offer ``the luxury of criticism without the burden of
accountability.''
   He complained about the sequence of witnesses, with critics
appearing before administration officials testified - although that
happened because the White House chose not to send its spokesmen
until after the United Nations had voted to authorize the use of
force against Iraq.
   Quayle said the committees should have waited. ``If there was
such an urgency to have the hearings, why not have an urgency to
help the president?'' he said.
   Bush said Friday that he thinks he has increasing support in
Congress. He noted that he'd told House and Senate leaders that
``if you want to come in here and strongly endorse what I am doing
or endorse the United Nations resolution, I welcome that because I
think it would send a very strong, clear signal to the world.''
   Sununu had said earlier that ``I have the feeling that most of
them wish that they never get asked to make a decision one way or
the other on the issue.'' The new Congress that convenes next month
will have to vote on appropriations to pay for the Desert Shield
operation.
   Quayle, addressing Republican governors in Pinehurst, N.C., last
week, said an expression of solid congressional backing for Bush
would improve the chances for peace.
   ``But that would require Congress to resist the temptation to
use the current hearings on the gulf for partisan political
advantage,'' Quayle said. Instead, he said, some congressional
Democrats are trying to portray themselves as the party of peace
and the administration as the party of war.
   He wouldn't say which congressional Democrats. ``I'm not getting
into names at all,'' Quayle said later when he was asked to
identify his targets. ``I'm not going to do that and you're not
going to bait me into it.''
   Short of a resolution of support, Quayle said, Congress can ``be
helpful by remaining silent ... We're going to interpret their
silence as being supportive.''
   Two days later, when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
resumed its hearings on the Persian Gulf, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr.,
D-Del., said the purpose was to broaden understanding of the crisis
and ways to resolve it, not to score political points.
   ``The administration has responded by accusing this and other
congressional committees of partisanship,'' Biden said. ``We are
accused of seeking to break the Bush presidency.'' He said that
isn't so.
   Make-or-break issues will be shaped by the outcome in the
Persian Gulf, not by congressional hearings or political debate.
   ``If we win a relatively quick and decisive victory, as is very
likely, I think the president will emerge as the hero ...'' said
Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, a New York Democrat who supports his
current course. ``If we were to get bogged down in a protracted
conflict with the casualties building up, the country would
obviously come to a different conclusion.''

   Once upon a time in the not-too-distant past,
life as a television viewer was relatively simple.
   Fall marked the beginning of a new television season. Reruns
were over, the kids trudged back to school, clocks fell back an
hour for the end of daylight-saving time and TV Guide published its
annual fall preview edition.
   There was a certain life-sustaining order to all this.
   Now, however, there is no certainty. Chaos reigns in the world
of network programming. There no longer is just one season for new
shows. There are at least three. And the second one is upon us.
   Officially known as the midseason, it unofficially stretches
from January to May, with the third season being summer (a mixture
of reruns and leftover pilots).
   Being a midseason show is a little like enlisting in the armed
forces reserves during wartime. Being sent to the front is a
distinct possibility. So is getting killed.
   But as the ratings war escalates between networks fighting for
the biggest share of a dwindling audience, the midseason no longer
functions simply as a back bench.
   Yes, midseason shows still are used to replace fall failures.
But more and more, they exist in and of themselves and form a
separate season altogether.
   No network has embraced this concept more wholeheartedly than
ABC. It enters the new year with 12 midseason shows, nearly twice
the number of each of its competitors.
   ABC entertainment president Robert Iger has unabashedly held
back shows from the fall lineup to unveil them after Jan. 1. Most
notoriously, ``Twin Peaks,'' the much-hyped soap opera masterminded
by David Lynch, debuted last April 8 - smack in the middle of
midseason.
   ABC, CBS and NBC have had varying degrees of success with
midseason shows. For ABC, ``Moonlighting,'' ``Coach,'' ``America's
Funniest Home Videos'' and ``The Wonder Years'' all proved big
hits.
   NBC scored well with ``In the Heat of the Night,'' ``Quantum
Leap,'' ``Carol &amp; Co.'' and ``Hill Street Blues.''
   At CBS, ``All in the Family'' debuted as a midseason program.
Other notables include ``Top Cops,'' ``Northern Exposure'' and
``Doctor, Doctor.''
   By deliberately waiting for the fall hoopla to die down (and for
fall failures to manifest themselves), ABC thinks it can grab more
viewers.
   ``We're the ones who figured it out, emphasized it and bought
(shows) specifically for it,'' said Ted Harbert, ABC's executive
vice president of prime time.
   ``We did not participate in the fall chaos. We put on the lowest
number of fall of shows (five),'' Harbert said. ``In the long run,
I think that is going to turn out to be the right thing to do.''
   This fall season was indeed chaotic. With nearly 100 shows on
the four networks - 34 of them new - it was largest fall rollout in
television history.
   And although CBS and NBC have their own stables of midseason
shows, their executives espouse a different philosophy about the
significance of January-to-May programming.
   ``The time for new shows will always be the fall,'' said NBC
entertainment president Warren Littlefield. ``That's when we can
take a long time to promote them and to create some excitement out
there. You want to reinforce that tradition, not break it down.''
   NBC used the fall schedule as an opportunity to bolster its
top-rated status by revamping its aging lineup. ``We put on nine
new shows, which is probably the most aggressive schedule ever for
a No. 1 network,'' Littlefield said.
   Five have already been canceled. Littlefield likened the fallout
to running a relay race. ``In the middle, you want to be able to
kick in with a fresh runner and in the summer, you want to end
strong.''
   CBS, the bottom-rated network, introduced the highest number of
new fall shows. Of the 12 it debuted, half have been canceled. Like
NBC, it has seven midseason shows, some of which are still in
development and some of which are already on the prime time
schedule.
   Peter Tortorici, senior vice president of program planning for
CBS, said the notion of midseason programming is really nothing
new.
   ``We've come up with new labels and new names, but essentially
we're doing the same thing that we've always done,'' Tortorici
said. ``What has changed is the volume.''
   The midseason is a necessity, Tortorici said: ``The practical
reality is that most shows won't make it. The reason for a
midseason is for that overpowering reason.''

<HEAD>Health-Care Costs and Recession: A Dangerous Mixture</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the somber realities of economic life,
recession and high health-care costs, are coming together at just
the wrong time for many businesses and employees.
   Consulting firms are recommending that companies scrutinize
their plans for savings, but the historical evidence shows that
insecurity and other stresses of economic downturns produce greater
demands on the plans.
   ``For a variety of reasons, health-care utilization and lean
times go hand in hand,'' says Anna Rappaport, an officer of William
M. Mercer Inc., a leading employee benefits and human resources
consulting firm.
   Even layoffs, inevitable in a recession, can have an impact on
the cost of health coverage, since the Consolidated Ominibus Budget
Act of 1985 requires employers to offer continued coverage to
terminated workers.
   Health-care managers believe some of those former employees may
use their time to attend to nagging ailments or to undergo surgery
they had postponed, or that financial stress could produce costly
physical and mental problems.
   While the Omnibus Act (popularly and perhaps aptly known as
COBRA in some circles) allows employers to charge terminated
employees the full cost of continued coverage, the companies still
could end up with higher costs.
   Ms. Rappaport explains that employees who continue coverage
often are those most in need. Typically, she says, that need might
involve someone in the family with a mental or physical ailment,
with the result that their coverage costs more than the company is
allowed to charge the former worker.
   Still another recession-induced problem puts pressure on company
benefit plans: Older workers and those with chronic ailments may
seek protection from termination by opting for early retirement or
by filing a disability claim.
   Consultants at Mercer, which serves 9,000 domestic employers,
and more if its international operations are included, are urging
clients to re-examine their plans and prepare for the worst, but to
avoid knee-jerk solutions.
   Based on past experience, one of the more serious blunders may
be to slash benefits at the expense of morale and productivity. Ms.
Rappaport, a Mercer managing director, claims that to do so ``can
send all the wrong signals.''
   Instead, she recommends that companies seek to preserve the
overall value of benefits, and that if it is necessary to shift
costs to employees then it is also wise to balance this with a
low-cost addition to the plan.
   Health-care costs have been a worsening problem for more than
two decades, consistently rising faster than inflation in general.
By some estimates, health care now accounts for about 17 percent of
gross national product.
   At the same time, recipients, providers, insurers, employers and
others agree that much cost is associated with correctible personal
habits, waste, duplication and needless usage, such as overly long
hospital stays.
   One of the most disturbing consequences of efforts to correct
any one of these, however, has been to see costs rise in another
area. Savings were sought, for example, by avoiding or limiting
hospital stays, and it worked for a time. But out-of-hospital costs
then rose and negated some of those efforts.
   In view of such experiences, Ms. Rappaport believes there is
``no clean, neat solution.'' Instead, she says, the problem must be
attacked in whatever new ways it rears its ugly head. ``There are
tradeoffs, but not solutions.''

   China is huge and ancient, a place of mystery

Westerner's daily life, as the writer discovered when she was
assigned this fall to the Associated Press bureau in Beijing.

   The driver wove through congested traffic, veered
around mule-drawn wagons and passed with cabbage-laden trucks, that
dated from World War II.
   A woman carrying a large basket of produce stepped directly in
front of the car. The driver braked, swerved, blasted the horn. The
woman stared as we passed her, bicycles crisscrossing in our wake.
   I had just arrived to take up residence in Beijing, and made a
mental note that a drive across town should not be approached
lightly.
   There is much for an outsider to learn in the world's most
populous country, from its ancient past to its complex modern
politics.
   It remains unique, despite increased contact with the outside,
and entices the curious to explore.
   Villagers welcome foreigners warmly, giving directions to the
most scenic spots nearby, sometimes even inviting them home for a
meal. On a long train ride, Chinese travelers will chat at length
with outsiders over tea.
   In China, evem the ordinary can be exotic. Sometimes, after a
wind storm from the north, it seems as if half the Gobi Desert has
been deposited on the floors, furniture and windowsills of a
Beijing apartment.
   Beijing is heated by coal and its air is thick with the residue.
You can tell how long someone has been in the capital, it is said,
by the severity and frequency of the person's cough.
   A newcomer must apply for a health certificate. Those who are
prepared bring letters from doctors back home, chest X-rays and
copies of laboratory reports certifying they have no communicable
diseases.
   Getting Chinese officials to accept the papers is the challenge.
The canny applicant places a ``chop,'' or official stamp, on every
piece of paper to lend an air of authority.
   After some wrangling, the hospital official agreed to accept my
X-ray. More discussion was needed to avoid paying the X-ray fee
even though no X-ray would be taken.
   By this time, a crowd had gathered to hear the discussion, which
alternated between Chinese and English as each of us used whichever
seemed best suited to the point at issue.
   Finally, the health official had dropped all but one demand. She
insisted I have a blood test for syphilis.
   A New York doctor had given me a letter saying I had no venereal
diseases, but, the official declared, ``Syphilis is not a venereal
disease.''
   I submitted to the test, paid the fee and left, wondering
whether the entire process was designed just to collect foreign
currency.
   Foreign exchange is in great demand and having it provides
options. But it's all a bit confusing because the local currency
comes in two varieties, one for foreigners and one for Chinese.
   Renminbi, the non-convertible currency used by Chinese, is
officially unavailable to foreigners. They are supposed to use
Foreign Exchange Certificates, or FEC.
   When I went to make my first household purchase, a kettle for
boiling drinking water, I had only FEC and the price was in
renminbi. FEC has a higher street value, so I asked the clerk to
lower the price.
   Onlookers clustered around for the bargaining. Some joined in,
helping me persuade the woman to offer a ``foreign money'' price.
   So she asked for dollars. No, I was offering FEC. Pretty soon,
she was quoting three prices: renminbi, FEC or dollars.
   Much too complicated, I thought, so I left to think it over.
When I returned the next day, all the kettles were gone.
   Part of the fun of bargaining is that, when the bargainer is
foreign, it becomes instant street theater. Passers-by love to
watch and offer advice, especially if the foreigner bargains in
Chinese.
   The polite parting line is always ``You speak very good
Chinese,'' however good or bad it may have been.
   Foreigners get used to stares on the street, but official
surveillance is another matter.
   Cameras record all comings and goings at the walled compounds
where most foreigners must live. There are more subtle reminders of
probing eyes, like tea stains on newspaper clippings from a friend
in the United States who doesn't drink tea.
   Foreign reporters seem the most closely watched and the most
resentful of it, which creates a mutual animosity that isn't always
hidden.
   At Foreign Ministry briefings, spokesmen often refuse to answer
questions and rebuke those who demand answers. Reporters counter
with derisive laughter.
   A Dutch journalist asked whether a new government campaign to
improve China's image would mean greater access to leaders and more
complete answers to questions.
   Colleagues laughed, anticipating an ironic or sarcastic reply.
   ``No comment,'' the spokeswoman said.

<HEAD>Queen of Sex and Glamor Sagas Launches Sixth Book</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When she first hit best-seller lists a dozen
years ago with her steamy novel, ``Scruples,'' Judith Krantz
thought it was a fluke, a magical midlife gift that would never
come again.
   ``I was in shock for two years,'' she says of the book sales
bonanza that set the publishing world on its ear. ``I put one foot
in front of another and did what a person does on a 16-city book
tour when you have a No. 1 best seller. But I didn't know what I
was doing.''
   Now, launching her sixth book, ``Dazzle,'' another in the
sex-and-glamour sagas that have made her famous, the acclaimed
queen of escapist pop literature recalls her first overnight
success as fondly as a first love affair.
   She still wears the golden cuff bracelet from her husband,
producer Steve Krantz, to commemorate the ``Scruples'' publication.
It reminds her of that star burst of fame and fortune that sent her
into orbit as a best-selling author.
   And she, who has since sold books and miniseries for millions,
still savors the memory of her first $50,000 advance.
   ``Scruples'' was published two days after her 50th birthday and,
for this former free-lance magazine writer and Beverly Hills wife
and mother, a new life had begun.
   When she hit the best-seller list, she ran out and impulsively
bought a pair of diamond earrings. ``I took refuge in the one thing
I was sure of - shopping. ... It had never occurred to me there was
money in this,'' she says of her book writing.
   And it had never occurred to her that she could make a major
purchase without her husband's approval. ``It's one of the basic
things most women can't do - they can't write a big check without
asking their husbands. It's very satisfying for a woman of my
generation to write a check without asking anyone.''
   But there was life after ``Scruples,'' and Krantz, fearul of
being swallowed by fame's dizzying whirl, retreated to her
typewriter.
   ``I started another book so I had a feeling of being grounded,''
she said. ``I started `Princess Daisy' as soon as possible. It
returned me to a routine of working.''
   She was still uncertain that success would last.
   ``I never took for granted that I would write a second book and
I never envisioned that one day you and I would be sitting here and
I would have written six books,'' she says over lunch in her
bright, flowered Beverly Hills home.
   Her second book made publishing history. Paperback rights were
auctioned for $3.2 million, then the highest price ever for reprint
rights.
   Judith Krantz was a millionaire in her own right. She had a
following. Her subsequent books, ``Mistral's Daughter,'' ``I'll
Take Manhattan'' and ``Till We Meet Again,'' were scooped up by
faithful readers and by television.
   But there was a downside to Krantz' success; the critics snubbed
her.
   ``I took criticism in the press as someone snatching money out
of the mouths of more deserving writers,'' she recalls. ``They
didn't understand that if publishers make money on best sellers
they can afford to work with other authors. They had profits from
my books that they could put into risk taking.''
   This onetime Wellesly College English major knows she is not
writing serious literature.
   ``I think I write about things that are serious in the lives of
my characters but not in a serious way. My style is not a serious
style. It's a playful style,''she says.
   Sex is a key ingredient in Krantz books, and ``Dazzle'' contains
more explicit sex scenes than ever, including a lesbian episode.
   Why does she focus so heavily on sex?
   ``I like to write about it,'' she says matter-of-factly. ``I
love to write erotic, sensuous scenes. I found I had a talent for
writing about sex and I like to exercise that talent. Besides, I
don't feel I know my characters in a completely rounded way unless
I know about their sex lives. It's like the color of their hair.''
   Krantz prides herself on factual research for each book. She
explored the Beverly Hills boutique business in ``Scruples,'' the
world of advertising agencies in ``Princess Daisy,'' Nazi
collaborators in ``Mistral's Daughter'' and World War II flying
aces in ``Till We Meet Again.''
   The heroine of ``Dazzle'' is a beautiful photographer of
celebrities who also is heir to an Orange County, Calif., Spanish
land grant threatened by development. That subject is as carefully
delineated as her characters' wardrobes and sexual appetites.
   ``You can't keep a novel going on just sex and clothes,'' says
Krantz. ``Nobody would read it. You've got to have real characters
and real problems.''
   As ``Dazzle'' hits the bookstores with a glitzy gold cover,
Krantz is starting a new book. She writes now, she says, for love,
not money, and certainly not for posterity.
   ``If I were writing for posterity, as an English major I would
have to laugh at myself,'' she says. ``I don't think I'll come back
in another life and see kids reading my books in high school.''

<HEAD>Research Says Potted Plants Clean Toxic Gases From the Air</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Those cheerful green plants may be doing more
than adding a touch of nature to your home or office. Some
scientists think they are keeping you healthy by eating hazardous
indoor air pollution.
   W.C. Wolverton, a retired NASA researcher who now has his own
lab in Picayune, Miss., said potted plants are amazingly efficient
at eliminating such pollutant gases as formaldehyde, benzene and
trichloroethylene from the air.
   ``I think we are closing in on the real economic solution to the
indoor air pollution problem,'' Wolverton said in a telephone
interview.
   The nation's florists and nurserymen are enthusiastic, of
course. The Associated Landscape Contractors of America has set up
the Foliage for Clean Air Council to promote and publicize studies
by Wolverton and others.
   A Mississippi businessman, Wayne Anderson, established a company
to market Wolverton's invention, ``Nature's Filter,'' which uses a
fan to draw air through a plant's root system, apparently
accelerating the pollution-eating effect.
   ``We've done a lot of testing on it and it looks really good,''
Anderson said. His Alliance Research and Manufacturing Corp. plans
to sell the plant-based filter through interior landscapers for
$130.
   Wolverton, an environmental engineer, said his studies show the
fan-aided plant filter can do the job of 100 normal plants in
cleaning up gases given off by paints and varnishes, particle board
or synthetic carpet fibers, or contained in tobacco smoke.
   His work has focused on benzene, formaldehyde and
trichloroethylene, all compounds found commonly in homes and
offices and known to cause irritation and illness and possibly
cancer. He has used dwarf azaleas, golden pothos, bamboo palms,
English ivy, pot mums and other plants.
   The research began as part of the National Aeronautic and Space
Administration's effort to plan for air filtration in future space
habitats, where humans would be living for years without any way to
bring in fresh air.
   Not all experts in the field are sold on Wolverton's findings.
   ``I'm a Wolverton skeptic,'' said Thad Godish, professor of
natural resources at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind. ``I
think everybody should have plants in their houses, but it's highly
improbably that they'll be useful for air cleaning.''
   Godish published a study in 1988 critiquing some of Wolverton's
earlier research on spider plants and formaldehyde gas coming off
particle board.
   ``The small amount I saw just said there's no way in the world
putting spider plants in the house is going to make a difference,''
Godish said.
   Wolverton said critics pointed out important gaps in his early
studies, but said his newest research answers any questions that
have been raised.
   ``Our original work was limited,'' he said. ``Those have been
constructive criticisms.''
   Wolverton said his most recent studies suggest that the
cleansing process is more complicated than it first appeared.
   ``At first we thought the plant leaves were doing all the
work,'' he said. ``Now we find the soil and microorganisms are
major players.''
   There was some concern, Wolverton said, that a plant exposed to
nasty chemicals would absorb them for a while - then ``just get
sick and die and dump it back into the environment.''
   Instead, he said, the plants seem to get better at filtering the
pollutants the longer they are exposed.
   ``As we keep exposing the plants, they seem to absorb more and
more, rather than less and less,'' he said.
   A possible explanation, he said, is that the microorganisms in
the potting soil adapt to the benzene, formaldehyde or other
chemicals they are exposed to and begin to thrive on them.
   ``This is not surprising, since it is a well-established fact
that microorganisms have the ability to genetically adapt, thereby
increasing their ability to utilize toxic chemicals as a food
source when continuously exposed to such chemicals,'' Wolverton
wrote in a 1989 NASA study.
   He said the people most likely to benefit from pollution-eating
plants are those in energy-efficient homes or offices, tightly
sealed to keep out cold air, or in mobile homes, usually made with
materials that give off suspect gases.
   Plants, Wolverton said, are ``probably the only economic
solution to sealing these buildings for energy efficiency and to
make them healthier.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - In some people the more the well is tapped, the

   In the outer office of gene hunter
Francis Collins at the University of Michigan is a banner: ``NF &amp;
CF back to back. Another one down!! Love, the lab.''
   The NF and CF refer to Collins' lab's identification of the
genes that set the stage for two devastating diseases,
neurofibromatosis, the so-called Elephant Man's disease, and cystic
fibrosis.
   Genetics is his life's work, Collins says, because it best lets
him serve mankind and because it's fun.
   He is a mosiac of a man, simultaneously living in the
competitive and fast-moving world of genetics research and living
for his family, his church and his music.
   Collins, the man of science, reads Christian novels to lull
himself to sleep around midnight, and then starts the day at 5 a.m.
by reading the Bible.
   In 1989, a team led by this tall, lanky man with hair in an
early Beatles-style mop top, tracked down the gene for cystic
fibrosis, a feat made possible in part by Collins' development of a
new way of searching for the tiny bits of DNA. Since the discovery
of the cystic fibrosis gene, his lab and others have corrected the
errant gene in test tubes, inserting healthy genes into defective
cells.
   Last summer, he found the neurofibromatosis gene, tagging it at
the same time as researcher Ray White at the University of Utah.
   Within months, Collins and White, again working independently,
also found that the neurofibromatosis gene appears to work like a
switch that can turn on cancer, a find that could lead to new
treatments for brain tumors or other cancers.
   Dr. Allan E. Rubinstein, medical director of the National
Neurofibromatosis Foundation, called it ``the single most exciting
discovery in neurogenetics that has ever taken place.''
   That discovery means ``we're beginning to see the shape of
things,'' says Dr. Sherm Weissman, the Yale University professor
under whom Collins worked as a fellow in genetics from 1981 to
1984.
   Some scientists might take a lifetime to develop a momentous
find. Collins, whose path to his calling was uneven, has
specialized in genetics for less than a decade.
   ``Science has a lot of competition. People get jealous, envious
of people who do extremely well,'' says Thomas Gelehrter, chairman
of Human Genetics at Michigan's medical school. Collins'
achievements haven't aroused such resentment.
   ``It's the kind of person he is. He's a warm human being. Other
people enjoy his success,'' says Gelehrter, who recruited Collins
from Yale in 1984.
   Collins is a relentless researcher, yet in the midst of the last
frantic stage of the search for the CF gene, this hunter with a
hint of a Southern drawl took a hiatus, keeping his promise to
spend three weeks as a missionary doctor in Nigeria with his eldest
daughter.
   Collins' CF gene collaborator, Lap-Chee Tsui of the Hospital for
Sick Children in Toronto, found in 1985 the first genetic marker
that located which chromosome the gene was on. They began
collaborating in 1987.
   Collins frets over the past 18 months of publicity. Partly, he
fears that people with the two diseases will think the gene
discoveries mean cures are around the corner. He hopes to see cures
in his lifetime.
   He also worries that too much attention is focused on him.
   ``It's potentially dangerous because people think you're seeking
it out. I'm ready for it to calm down,'' says Collins, trying to
relax in an office crammed with books, scientific journals and
stacks of notebooks and files.
   Once a week he meets with graduate students and fellows working
in teams on cystic fibrosis, neurofibromatosis and three other
projects. The meetings are informal.
   ``We've been playing around with these blots,'' says one
researcher at a recent meeting. ``We need to go about this in a
more organized manner,'' says another. Collins listens patiently to
the frustrations.
   At another team meeting, the week's results rate high praise:
``Well, you guys are hot!'' Collins squints down from his 6-foot-4
height as he examines an associate's lab results. ``I think it's
cute,'' he coos. ``I hear gene therapy ringing out in the distance
here.''
   Later, his young researchers amble in and out of his office with
more results, more ideas. Collins' schedule gets more tangled. This
is why he's rarely on time, for anything.
   They ``need attention, nurturing, pats on the back. It's like
having a small child - you have to put time into it,'' Collins
says.
   It's a philosophy reminiscent of his parents' beliefs.
   Collins was born and raised in Staunton, Va., where Fletcher and
Margaret Collins settled to get away from the bustle of suburban
Long Island, and created their Oak Grove Players theater.
   ``Long before there was any counterculture, we went to live in
the country. Theater and music and art, that's a good blend,'' says
the elder Mrs. Collins, who writes and produces plays. Her husband
quit his job as an airline executive to teach college theater.
   Francis, the youngest of their four boys, was reading by age 3.
``He was obviously bright. We wanted him to mix and mingle with
people, not be weird, not to be arrogant about it,'' Mrs. Collins
says.

   She schooled him at home until the fourth-grade, when he could
handle the ``drudgery'' of classrooms. At 16, he graduated from
Robert E. Lee High School, whose 1966 yearbook lists his career
goal as aeronautical engineering.
   By then, he had met his future wife, a meeting born of her need
for a math tutor.
   ``I'm shy, but I was desperate,'' Mary Lynn Collins says with
her sly good humor. The couple discovered their mutual love of folk
guitar and have been in love since.
   They married in 1969, Collins' senior year at the University of
Virginia, earning money by performing Peter, Paul &amp; Mary and Joan
Baez tunes on weekends. One resort offered them a free honeymoon if
they played the weekend of their wedding. They accepted.
   ``We're cheap,'' Mary Lynn Collins laughed. In 1970, daughter
Margaret was born and the family headed to Yale, where Collins
received his doctorate in chemistry and a second daughter,
Elizabeth, was born. ``We lived in a drug district, off $250 a
month. I mowed lawns, he'd take down trees, paint, anything for
money.''
   But a Ph.D. wasn't enough.
   ``As a contribution to mankind, it wasn't that great,'' Collins
says. ``So I went to medical school somewhat shook up and confused.
I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue in research or just be a
doc.''
   At med school he discovered genetics, then poised on the
threshold of explosive discoveries. ``It had everything I was
looking for.''
   Meanwhile, Mary Lynn Collins discovered Christianity. ``I'd been
very depressed. It was like a dynamo came into my life. Francis
said he didn't want to hear about this Jesus junk.''
   But his wife's suddenly bright outlook made him explore
Christianity. ``I fought it and kicked and scratched,'' Collins
says.
   ``But little by little ... that became the guiding force in my
life.''
   Collins, who now had a calling and a mission, went back to Yale.
   Yale's Weissman, a professor of human genetics, molecular
physics, biochemistry and medicine, put Collins to work developing
a new way to find genes, a technique now known as gene jumping.
``We're proud to have had him in the lab,'' Weissman said.
   Gene jumping is a technique for getting rid of parts of a
chromosome that you don't want to waste time on. Unwanted lengths
of the chromosome are literally cut away and the respective ends
are then spliced together. Now, parts of the chromosome that look
promising are next to each other for easier gene hunting.
   In Ann Arbor, Collins oversees four projects: cystic fibrosis,
now experimenting with replacing defective genes with normal ones;
NF, now mapping the finer points of the gene; the search for the
gene causing Huntington's disease; and studying why the hemoglobin
in fetuses changes to its adult version. Solving that puzzle could
lead to treating sickle cell anemia.
   Also, Collins' lab is one of four in the nation with a federal
grant for the Human Genome project, an effort to map every human
gene. Collins directs the project here, says director Gelehrter,
who co-wrote a genetics textbook with Collins that was published
this year.
   Collins typically puts in a 90-hour workweek, juggling up to 80
phone calls a day, guiding his projects, examining patients, and a
whirlwind travel schedule that takes him to lecture appearances or
to meetings of the half-dozen national research committees on which
he serves.
   ``We jokingly call him the Northwest Airlines professor,''
Gelehrter says. Adds Mary Lynn Collins: ``I don't know how he does
it. I keep warning him, we're 40.''
   Husband and wife play their guitars at the New Life Baptist
Church on Sunday. ``They're always providing something for
someone,'' says Pastor Jeff Holt, who believes his 2-year-old
congregation might not exist had the Collinses not helped form it.
   ``They were very instrumental in getting the church
established,'' Holt says. ``They provided a lot of essential
leadership.''
   Peter Bellerman, executive director of the National
Neurofibromatosis Foundation, credits Collins with molding a
consortium of genetic researchers who share data on the disfiguring
disease. That sharing speeded up finding the gene, and its link to
cancer, he says.
   While many researchers won't talk about their work until it is
published, he says, ``In this group, everybody is expected to put
their cards on the table, pre-publication.''
   Collins worries that his achievements will extract a price.
   ``I'm dangerously close to being overcommitted,'' he says. He
delegates work now, but misses being behind the lab bench.
   And he misses family time. ``They're very patient. But my kids
are growing up. I don't want to sacrifice everything, especially my
family.''
   Daughter Margaret, 20, is a student at the University of North
Carolina in Chapel Hill, N.C. Elizabeth, 16, is a junior at an Ann
Arbor high school.
   ``It has taken a toll on our family in the last year and half,''
says Mrs. Collins. ``We've really had to work on it. But I'm a
doctor's daughter. I know what it means.''
   Can Collins maintain his frenetic pace?
   ``I may get to the point where I burn out,'' he says. ``Maybe 10
years from now, I won't be at the cutting edge. Then what? Probably
missionary medicine.
   ``As a Christian, I lean toward it. I've been blessed.''

   People stare when Peter Dingeman walks into
a room. Some show shock, others turn away in pity or revulsion.
   ``One time I was in a restaurant and someone came up to me and
said, `How could you come in here and ruin my dinner?' I said, `No
one's paying you to look.'''
   Dingeman, a steel company employee, has neurofibromatosis, a
genetic disorder best known - erroneously - as Elephant Man's
disease. About 100,000 Americans have NF, making it about three
times more common than the better-known cystic fibrosis.
   People with NF may develop benign tumors along the nerves of
their arms and legs, their eyes and sometimes their spinal cords or
brains. Half will need surgery sometime in their lives as the
disease progresses.
   Some people inherit NF. In others it's caused by a spontaneous
mutation, a gene gone awry. Some victims may have merely a few
small lumps and patches of skin discoloration known as ``cafe au
lait'' spots. Others may have learning disabilities, scoliosis - a
spinal curvature - other skeletal defects or tumors that disfigure
every part of their body.
   Dingeman, whose right eye is partly blocked by a tumor, has NF
because of a spontaneous mutation. It used to make him angry.
   ``You always had kids making fun of you,'' he says. ``I couldn't
get dates. My brother and two sisters were beautiful people. I
thought, `Why me?'
   ``Sometimes I get down in the dumps and still think that. But
for the most part, I have no qualms and regrets. I wouldn't trade
with anyone,'' adds Dingeman, 38, putting his arm around son Josh,
6, and daughter Sabrina, 8, during an interview at their home
northeast of Detroit.
   Stares upset Sabrina. ``It BUGS me. I think, `Keep your eyes off
my dad.'''
   Dingeman's peace with NF is such that he finds humor in it.
``Like in the grocery - people will stare so hard they run the cart
into the wall. I just laugh.''
   Dingeman was diagnosed at 16, when surgeons removing a cyst from
his eye found a tumor instead. Since then, he's undergone seven
operations to take out growths - around his eye, the base of his
skull and his elbow. He faces more surgery. It was after one
operation that he met his wife, a nurse. After seven years of
marriage, they risked the 50-50 odds of passing on the NF gene to
children.
   Sabrina got lucky. Josh has signs of NF - tan ``cafe au lait''
spots and a slightly enlarged head. Dingeman hopes that by the time
Josh must be told he has the disease, there'll be a treatment, if
not a cure.
   A year ago, he wouldn't have even fantasized about that. But
earlier this year, Drs. Francis Collins of the University of
Michigan and Ray White of the University of Utah independently
discovered the gene. Months later, the researchers found that it
appears to be in the family of genes that may operate as
anti-cancer genes.
   ``You can think of a cell as having a green light and a red
light,'' Collins says. When so-called tumor-suppressor genes are
defective, ``the cell stays in the green-light state and keeps
growing and pretty soon you've got a tumor.''
   Findings suggest that NF's benign tumors may be an intermediate
step between normal and cancerous tissue, implications that could
lead to new treatments for brain tumors and other cancers.
   ``This often abused population as it turns out may hold the key
for everybody else's cancer,'' says Peter Bellerman, executive
director of the National Neurofibromatosis Foundation. ``Isn't
there poetic or divine justice in this?''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Sometimes, as they say, you can't believe your
eyes. Or your ears either, as Milli Vanilli proved. With modern
technology, the line between what is possible and what is
considered permissible tends to blur.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By JULES LOH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a century ago William S. Gilbert wrote
the comic-opera line that deserves repeating at the start of every
year: ``Things are seldom what they seem, skim milk masquerades as
cream.''
   If the Milli Vanilli masquerade was not 1990's most blatant
contribution to the world's gallery of deception, it at least
showed that today's technology makes it all the more difficult to
know when to call a knave a knave.
   Today we have example after example of artistry being
``enhanced,'' as the technicians call it, in undetectable ways. As
a result we do not always hear what we think we are hearing or see
what we think we are seeing, and the line tends to blur between the
technically possible and the ethically permissible.
   Milli Vanilli simply pushed ``enhancement'' beyond the pale and
got caught -which, to some in the pop music business, was its only
crime.
   What you saw in the Milli Vanilli act were two men dancing while
singing, or at least mouthing, a song with a title rich in irony,
``Girl You Know It's True.'' What you actually heard, though, were
three (not even two!) anonymous other people tape recorded in a
studio doing the singing. The recording, crediting the dancers with
the singing, sold 7 million copies and Milli Vanilli won a Grammy
award, rescinded when the truth came out.
   Given time, the truth generally does. Fortunately, because
masquerades have a long history.
   It took 41 years before Piltdown Man was exposed as a hoax, that
the bones of the ``missing link'' found in a gravel pit in England
in 1912 were actually the skull of a man and the jaw of an ape. For
30 years New York's Metropolitan Museum displayed three life-size
Etruscan Warriors, believed, until 1961, to date from the sixth
century B.C. Their actual sculptor was still alive, in Italy.
   ``There is always someone who can tell the difference,'' says
John Russell, the chief art critic of the New York Times, now
retired, ``just as there is always someone who can tell at a glance
what is wrong with a horse, a plant, a balance sheet.''
   Maybe, but Gilbert knew what he was talking about when it came
to masquerades, and so did whoever said you can't tell a book by
its cover.
   Literally. One New York outfit (among several) has for 50 years
found a ready market in fake books. Ritzy bindings with impressive
titles go for $70 a foot, installed. Serious non-readers pay more
for specific titles, presumably books they especially don't want to
read.
   Harmless enough, but other masquerades are less so.
   A few years ago sugar water masqueraded as apple juice and cost
Beech-Nut a $2 million fine. On a single day in 1986, U.S. Customs
seized truckloads of goods masquerading as genuine Rolex, Piaget
and Cartier watches, Chanel and Estee Lauder perfume, Ray-Ban
sunglasses, Louis Vuitton suitcases, Gucci handbags, Smart Sam
talking teddy bears, the list goes on. The haul was worth $10
million retail, which merely scratched the surface of a thoroughly
businesslike and thoroughly fraudulent manufacturing operation.
   ``The Milli Vanilli scam,'' said William Velez of New York
University, ``reflects an attitude that says why not, everybody's
doing it.''
   Velez teaches a music and technology course which deals in part
with the ethics of enhancement - lipsyncing, dubbing, sampling,
pitch-riding, synthesizing - the whole electronic garden of music
wizardry.
   You might say that enhancement is to music what anabolic
steroids are to athletics, though not detectable in urine samples
and, apparently, permissible. But where do you draw the line?.
   ``The industry has been moving for years toward more and more
artificialness, if you will, so that it probably didn't seem so
shocking for it to reach the Milli Vanilli stage,'' Velez said.
``It bothers me that the students seemed generally cavalier about
it. Maybe the outcry will shake them up.''
   In a television interview the Milli Vanilli producer, Frank
Farian, seemed bewildered at the outcry. He said he had heard the
song, had seen the dancers, and put the two together in his mind.
In a flash of genius, bingo, a new ``art form.''
   But we will remember the name Milli Vanilli not for a new art
form but for the same reason names such as Janet Cooke and Rosie
Ruiz and Clifford Irving stick in the memory bank, would-be
achievers exposed as cheats. No, cheaters gain no fame, only the
lasting notoriety of getting caught.
   And, through the ages, they seem to have relied less on fancy
new technology than on plain old lying.
   Janet Cooke simply made up her moving story about an 8-year-old
heroin addict, which won a 1981 Pulitzer Prize. Clifford Irving,
accepting a $750,000 advance in 1971, said flat out that he had
interviewed the reclusive Howard Hughes for an ``authorized
autobiography.'' The lie was all the more baldfaced because Hughes
was still alive to deny it, which he did. Irving went to jail.
   As for Rosie Ruiz, she seemed to come out of nowhere, as the
sports pages said, to win the 1980 Boston Marathon. Actually she
came out of the crowd, near the finish line, in broad daylight, and
got found out.
   The oldest fake on record, in fact, states without shame: ``This
is not a lie, it is indeed the truth.''
   It is a cuneiform inscription on a stone marker now residing in
the British Museum. It is a forgery apparently used in a 1500 B.C.
Babylonian land swindle. It claims to be a thousand or so years
older than it is in order to establish phony title, and warns: ``He
who will damage this document, let Enki fill up his canals with
slime.''

   Any museum worth its antiquities gallery also keeps a corner in
the basement for its accumulated fakes.
   ``Every collector has bought a fake,'' says Richard Fazzini,
head of antiquities at the Brooklyn Museum, which has about 40.
Sotheby's, the New York auction house, estimates that as many as
half the antiquities brought in for possible sale are forgeries.
   The 250-year-old British Museum has so many bogus artifacts,
about 600, that it puts on fakes displays from time to time. One of
them stands as testimony that if a fake lasts long enough the
cuckoo, as it were, will finally imitate the clock.
   It is a marble bust of Julius Caesar, cherished as genuine for
143 years until exposed in 1961 by advanced dating methods. It
generated thousands of reproductions, which still decorate
libraries around the world, and photographs to illustrate texts of
Gallic campaigns that inspired generations of high school Latin
students.
   Does it matter? William Shakespeare and Francis Bacon are both
long dead. Does it really matter if, as some claim, Bacon wrote
some of the plays? Would their genius be diminished? Does the
knowledge that Dresden china is actually made in Meissen make it
any less lovely?
   After all, says Wendy Steiner, professor of English at the
University of Pennsylvania, ``If Geoffrey of Monmouth had not
concocted his `History of the Kings of Britain' from a mysteriously
vanished source, we would not have had the `Morte d'Arthur' or
`King Lear'.''
   Politicians, all the way to the top, accept the credit that
belongs to their speechwriters. Today's public seems to accept that
with the same shrug that they accept TelePrompTers, which allow
politicians to appear not to be reading what they appear to have
written.
   But tangible fakes, however skillfully done, have about the same
intrinsic worth as a counterfeit relic of a saint. Who would settle
for an exact copy of a family heirloom, even a technically improved
copy?
   One of modern history's most accomplished fakers was Han Van
Meegeren of Holland. He specialized in forging paintings attributed
to the 17th century's Jan Vermeer and fooled some of the finest
scholars on two continents. Some of them, when Van Meegeren
confessed, were so embarrassed they refused to believe him.
   When British forger Tom Keating, on the other hand, confessed in
1976 to have forged about 2,000 paintings by 100 different artists,
he was not scorned but celebrated. He gave TV lectures on great
artists' techniques, wrote his life story and became a folk hero.
   Fakery tends to fluctuate with the caprice of an artist's
popularity in the market. At one point the lament among dealers was
that the French painter Camille Corot, who died in 1875, had
painted about 800 pictures in his lifetime, of which about 4,000
hung in American collections.
   Just as there is a market for fake books there also is a market
for fake paintings - authentic fakes, if you will.
   Leo Stevenson, a 31-year-old Briton, is a copier by profession.
He says he has made such a fine art of forging fine art that,
driven by honesty, he always leaves a clue. An X-ray of one of his
Vermeer forgeries, for example, will show a telephone in the
background and a 17th century Dutch girl wearing 20th century
underwear.
   No X-ray or chemical analysis, though, will detect audio-visual
monkeyshines, and the tinkering goes on, eroding resistance day by
day.
   Back in 1953 Kirsten Flagstad made a recording of `Isolde,' a
part she had sung on stage many times to perfection. But Flagstad,
aging, allowed a younger prima donna, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, to hit
the high notes she herself had once sung with ease.
   That bit of deception, scandalous to many at the time, seems
almost quaint by today's standards.
   In the movie ``Flashdance'' that was not the star, Jennifer
Beals, dancing. It was somebody else. On a recording of ``He's a
Rebel,'' which reached No.1 on the charts, that was not the
Crystals singing despite what the label said. No, and not all the
Partridge Family members were the ones playing the instruments and
neither were the Monkees.
   When it leaked out that Liza Minnelli lip-synched during some of
her more strenuous dance numbers in the 1977 musical ``The Act,''
it set off shock waves all along Broadway, according to New York
critic Ken Mandlebaum. ``It was later considered more or less
forgivable because she was singing about 20 numbers in seven shows
a Week,'' he said, ``but it was also considered a dangerous
precedent.''
   When it was learned last year that rock star Janet Jackson
lip-synched parts of her concerts, the only shock was in the later
discovery of how many others were doing the same thing.
   It causes you to wonder whatever became of Andrew Flosdorf.
Remember him?
   Andrew Fosdorf was the 1983 National Spelling Bee contestant,
age 13, who spelled, correctly, ``echolalia.'' Or so the judges
ruled. But Andrew, on his own, discovered he had misspelled the
word and eliminated himself from the contest.
   ``I didn't want to feel like a slime,'' he explained.
   Just so. Let us, then, remember William Gilbert's words in the
Gilbert and Sullivan opera ``H.M.S. Pinafore'' and be cautious of
masquerades. And let us also honor the Andrew Flosdorfs of the
world with a seasonal salute from Tennyson:
   ``Ring out the old, ring in the new;
   ``Ring out the false, ring in the true.''

   One of the most accomplished fakes in the
history of fakery was exposed in 1984. He betrayed himself not by
his work, which was exquisite, but by his working drawings.
   He was Reinhold Vasters, a German goldsmith who worked in Aachen
in virtual austerity from 1853 to 1890. When he died in 1909 a
number of his working drawings found their way to the Victoria and
Albert Museum in London.
   There they gathered dust for more than 70 years until a curator,
Charles Truman, began looking them over to see how they related to
the Renaissance jewelry that had obviously inspired them.
   He wondered at first whether they were careful records left to
instruct apprentices. No, he discovered, they were how-to drawings
full of complicated instructions for assembly.
   It became apparent to museum curators that numerous creations
credited the world over to the Italian Benvenuto Cellini
(1500-1571) were actually the work of Vasters. One of them was the
New York Metropolitan Museum's so-called Rospigliosi Cup,
celebrated as a masterpiece of Renaissance art. Only when the cup
was taken apart piece by piece did it appear that it had been put
together in ways that did not exist until Vasters' own time.
   Vasters was not only a master deceiver but clearly an
accomplished artist in his own right. So precisely did he work in
the Cellini style that experts say it is unlikely he would ever
have been unmasked had his drawings not survived.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - It's been more than a decade since the Love
Canal neighborhood of Niagara Falls, N.Y., was evacuated, declared
unfit for human habitation because of pollution from a toxic
chemical dump. Now people are beginning to return to the
neighborhood as the debate continues over the threat to their
health.

   Television cameras rolled as brawny
men lugged Richard Horn's and Sandra DeVantier's furniture,
appliances and a set of golf clubs into their small brick ranch
house.
   Passers-by stopped to stare. The mayor proclaimed it the biggest
day in the city's history.
   Twelve years after chemicals leaking into the basements of a
middle-class neighborhood made Love Canal a symbol of America's
toxic waste problems, people were finally moving back to the area.
   ``It has been a long battle,'' says Mayor Michael O'Laughlin.
``The fact that a person finally moved furniture in is an
outstanding accomplishment in the environmental world.''
   Indeed, much has changed at Love Canal since the summer of 1978
when the leaking chemicals dumped there three decades earlier by
Hooker Chemicals &amp; Plastics Corp. set off a nationwide scare about
unseen poisons lurking beneath the earth.
   An elementary school and hundreds of houses built on and near
the dump in the years after Hooker abandoned it have been
bulldozed, literally plowed into the ground.
   The 70-acre site where children played amid chemical volcanoes
and explosive ``fire rocks'' is now a green, grassy mound, fenced
off from the world. The 22,000 tons of chemicals that remain in the
earth are contained by a system of underground drains that, the
government says, should catch any leaks before they can threaten
the rest of the neighborhood.
   The neighborhood even has a new name - Black Creek Village.
   But one thing hasn't changed since those scary days. Scientists
and environmental officials are still divided on whether Love Canal
is, or ever will be, a safe place to live.
   The debate has echoed through the halls of power in Washington
and the halls of justice in Buffalo and Niagara Falls. It has even
ripped apart one of New York's largest environmental groups.
   The state Health Department reported in 1988 that a portion of
the Love Canal neighborhood was no more polluted than comparable
areas elsewhere in Niagara Falls. After months of delay and
lobbying that reportedly reached into the White House, U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency chief William Reilly upheld that
study last spring.
   With Reilly's approval in hand, the Love Canal Area
Revitalization Agency put up for sale 10 houses a few blocks north
of the dump site. The agency ultimately hopes to renovate and sell
as many as 250 of the 1,100 houses that the state bought from
fleeing residents in the early 1990s.
   William Broderick, the agency's head, declared Love Canal to be
``probably the safest area in the city of Niagara Falls, because we
know the most about it.'' But he concedes that the agency can't
give home buyers a written guarantee that chemical leaks would not
recur.
   The agency boasted that it had a list of more than 200 people
who were interested in buying houses in the area. But by late
November, only 12 buyers had signed contracts to purchase houses in
the area, and only one house had been occupied - the one bought by
DeVantier and her fiance, Horn. They moved in on Nov. 28.
   Broderick said recently the waiting list evaporated because many
of the people on it were looking to buy homes at ``fire-sale
prices,'' lower than the $40,000 to $60,000 the agency was asking.
Single-family homes in Niagara Falls sold for an average of $49,700
this year, according to the Greater Buffalo Board of Realtors.
DeVantier and Horn, who declined to speak to reporters, paid
$54,000 cash for their house.
   Broderick also said the agency's sales efforts were hampered by
the reluctance of many local banks to write mortgages on Love Canal
property.
   But the agency was also dogged by lawsuits from environmental
groups that said the state study hadn't proved the area was safe.
The environmentalists said that comparing Love Canal to other parts
of Niagara Falls was meaningless because the entire city is
permeated by the effluent of its massive chemical industry.

   One of those groups was the state chapter of the Sierra Club,
the worldwide environmental group based in San Francisco.
   But the club found itself plunged into a divisive debate because
one of its board members, James Carr, was the revitalization
agency's planning director - a key spokesman for the resettlement
effort.
   Disgruntled members accused Carr, a past president of the state
chapter, of using his position to try to frustrate the suit. After
months of debate over whether Carr should be ousted, the national
Sierra Club organization threw the chapter's entire board out of
office.
   While that dispute was playing out, Occidental Chemical Corp.,
which purchased Hooker in 1968, was trying to fight off the
government's efforts to make it pay at least $700 million in
cleanup costs and damages for creating the dump.
   The company lost an early round when U.S. District Judge John T.
Curtin ruled it was liable for the cleanup costs under the federal
Superfund law - a 1980 law that was inspired by the events at Love
Canal.
   But Occidental launched a vigorous defense to the state's claim
that the company should pay $250 million in punitive damages for
its allegedly reckless behavior at the dump.
   Former residents, Hooker employees and state workers streamed
into Curtin's courtroom in Buffalo, telling their recollections of
how Hooker turned a pristine canal bed teeming with fish, plants
and muskrat into a chemical wasteland.
   A Little League coach told how his outfielders chased a long fly
ball onto the dump property and returned with terrified tales of
volcanoes erupting in the weeds. Parents described a PTA meeting at
which they demanded planks be placed on the dump so children would
not have to wade through chemicals on their way to school.
   Former employees of Hooker and its contractors painted graphic
pictures of rusty drums that were dumped helter-skelter into pits,
breaking open occasionally and spewing fumes into the air. One
worker said he frequently was splashed by the spilled chemicals,
and had to go to nearby houses to wash them off with water or
gasoline.
   The company countered with evidence that Hooker's procedures for
waste disposal were the state of the art in their day; that broken
drums were always covered immediately with dirt; that the company
dug pits deep into what it believed was impermeable clay so the
leaking wastes would not escape into the groundwater.
   Occidental also began trying to show, as the trial evolved into
a battle of scientists, that the state caused unnecessary panic in
1978; that the hazards from the dump were overstated all along, and
that many of the chemicals detected in air samples in neighborhood
houses came from common household chemicals such as paint thinners.
   Thomas H. Truitt, Occidental's lead attorney, said the company
still believes the large-scale evacuations of the early 1980s were
unnecessary.
   ``In order to remediate the canal, which I stated in my opening
argument had to be accomplished, some evacuation for construction
purposes was probably necessary,'' Truitt said in an interview.
   ``The panic and misinformation that was put into the public
domain by both the federal and state governments during this period
made rational thought impossible. As a result, many more were
evacuated than had to be.''
   State officials said Occidental was painting too rosy a picture
of the dump's dangers. They also said Occidental was not the only
institution to do so.
   The state attorney general's office ruled last fall that a
videotape about the dump's history used by the revitalization
agency in its sales pitch to potential home buyers was inaccurate
and deceptive, and forced the agency to stop using it.
   Critics have charged that the revitalization agency, whose
chairman is Mayor O'Laughlin, has been pushing too hard to resettle
the area in order to get good publicity for the blighted city.
   O'Laughlin denied that charge, but conceded that a successful
resettlement would have a good effect on his city's image.
   ``We're always out trying to sell our city and our falls, to get
people to come here,'' he said.

dinner tables in Europe? The idea is revolting to some residents of
one small town where a French-run slaughterhouse has just begun
operations. While horse meat is seldom eaten by humans in the
United States, Europeans developed a taste for it out of necessity
during World War II.

   ``Future Home of Horse Killing,'' reads a
banner on Main Street. It protests a new French-run
horse-slaughtering plant that has just begun operation in this
southeast Missouri town of about 3,500 residents.
   The plant is meant to serve the dining tables of Europe, an idea
that runs smack against the American love affair with the horse.
   A woman whose family breeds Arabian horses is organizing a group
called Missourians Against Slaughtering Horses, MASH, to try to
shut down the plant.
   ``I consider this to be a holocaust for equines,'' says Mary
Voertmann of nearby Farmington. ``These people are coming in here
to rape the horse industry. This is an outrage.''
   In the midst of the criticism, Archway Packing Co. plant
officials are trying to keep a low profile. But it's been difficult
since news leaked out they've asked for and been granted permission
from the state to slaughter as many as 100 horses a day and send
the meat to France, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and Holland for
human consumption.
   To horse-lovers, that's unthinkable. To John Cross, the plant's
operations manager, it's just another day at the slaughterhouse.
   ``It's like all other businesses in the United States,'' Cross
says.
   It may not be well-known, but horse-slaughtering operations in
the United States are nothing new. There are at least a dozen in
this country, four in Texas alone, including one in downtown Fort
Worth.
   Great Western Packing Co. in Morton, Texas, one of the country's
largest horse slaughterhouses, has killed between 250 and 300
animals a day for the past 15 years with ``no major public
outcry,'' says Ben Ansolabehere, president of the company.
   ``I think this is an industry that takes care of the animals
that are no longer useful for the riding horse industry or the
working horse industry and provides a marketable price,''
Ansolabehere says.
   Ansolabehere says his company, where Cross previously worked as
operations manager, pays between 40 and 60 cents per pound for
horses.
   ``We try to run a professional, first-class operation,''
Ansolabehere says. ``We put them down in a humane fashion.''
   Horse hides are used for sports equipment and leather goods, and
their meat and entrails are used in the dog food and fertilizer
industries. While it's not illegal to sell horse meat for human
consumption in the United States, most of it finds its way into dog
food. But why begrudge European palates?
   ``It's a matter of taste, I guess, and I sure don't want to
taste it,'' says Desloge Mayor Jack Rabaduex, who's at the center
of the conflict.
   Eating horse meat became something of a necessity in Europe
after World War II when food was scarce and since then has become a
tradition.
   Last year 61,000 tons of horse meat was consumed in France,
although the modern generation appears to be losing its taste for
it. In 1979, the country consumed 97,000 tons.
   Still, only one-sixth of last year's total was produced in
France.
   Horse owners across Missouri, fearing their animals will be
stolen and slaughtered, have been expressing outrage to anyone who
will listen and have disrupted meetings of the Desloge City
Council.
   They've generally made life miserable for Rabaduex and the City
Council, which recently voted 4-2 to allow the operation to come to
town.
   State Rep. Craig Kilby of Lake St. Louis also is keeping the
pressure on. Kilby says he will sponsor legislation aimed at
preventing so-called ``killer buyers'' from purchasing healthy,
marketable pleasure horses for slaughter and export.
   The Humane Society of Missouri also is opposed, noting fears
that young horses as well as broken-down or ill-tempered animals
will be slaughtered.
   Plant manager Cross says most of the horses that will be
slaughtered in Desloge will be bought at livestock auctions selling
``everything from plug horses to good-riding horses.''
   He scoffs at the notion that Archway would employ rustlers to
steal horses or buy horses from unscrupulous types, or slaughter
young horses, which he and others in the industry say produces
tougher and stronger-tasting meat.
   ``There will always be some horses stolen, but they had that
problem long before we got here,'' he says.
   The Desloge operation is at the outskirts of town, at the end of
a dirt road just a few hundred yards from a Jehovah's Witnesses
Kingdom Hall. Archway has moved into an almost new 2,500-square
foot facility that previously was used for slaughtering cattle.
   The horses will be killed, gutted, drained of blood and hung in
a cooler in less than five minutes, says slaughter room supervisor
Jim Pyeatt. The meat then will be chilled, not frozen, trucked to
St. Louis and flown to Archway's food distribution unit in France.
   The plant will mean jobs for about 25 people for the depressed
town of 3,500 people about 60 miles south of St. Louis. Pyeatt says
he has taken more than 1,700 applications.
   Pyeatt, who has eight years experience as a butcher, was a
little leery about the job at first. Now he goes about town wearing
his Archway shirt with pride.
   ``When I go into restaurants in town they'll ask me if I want a
pony burger or something,'' Pyeatt says. ``But I was out of work,
and this is what I do. I'm not ashamed.''
   However, some residents don't share his enthusiasm.
   ``I hate to see it coming,'' says housewife Larnie Penberthy,
while pushing a shopping cart out of a local discount store. ``I
think we could get better business in here.''

   They have stood since the age of chivalry, eight
centuries or more, and they are showing their age. Many of the
Church of England's cathedrals scattered across the countryside are
crumbling, in sad need of repairs. But the kinds of repairs that
are needed will cost millions of dollars, money that is not in the
coffers. For the first time, the cathedrals have appealed to the
government for help.

   Brian Eacock shook his head as he
clambered down from a scaffold stretching nearly to the vaulted
ceiling of Worcester Cathedral.
   ``Another emergency,'' said the cathedral's clerk of works, his
dark hair powdered with the dust of antique stone.
   A worshiper happened to notice a stone working loose 70 feet
above, but Eacock fixed it in time. ``We were lucky. It could have
dropped,'' he said.
   Another might drop tomorrow. The red sandstone cathedral,
perched elegantly above the River Severn in western England, needs
$20 million in repairs over the next 15 years, church officials
says.
   Worcester is not alone.
   The Church of England has found that half of its 42 cathedrals
will need at least $140 million by the year 2000 to repair damage
caused by acid rain, natural decay and poor Victorian restoration
work.
   Famed edifices such as Canterbury or London's St. Paul's survive
well. Those such as Worcester, Gloucester and Hereford, far off the
beaten path in western England, are in pressing need.
   Last summer, cathedral caretakers conceded that individual
donations, marmalade sales and vicar's teas cannot preserve the
buildings. Banding together for the first time, they appealed to
the government.
   ``Unless such assistance is given there is a real danger of our
cathedral buildings and artifacts falling into a spiral of decay,''
Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie wrote in August to
then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   The government on Nov. 8 promised to make $23 million available
over the next three years.
   Eacock and his craftsmen, meanwhile, are planning how to bandage
the Worcester Cathedral's weak spots.
   In the 11th century, Bishop Wulstan began to erect the present
church on the site of an earlier cathedral founded by Benedictine
monks. Wulstan's crypt has worn well, but the legacies of the
Victorians haunt Eacock and his crew.
   During massive restorations between 1855 and 1870, workers
refaced 70 percent of Worcester with new stone and replaced
crumbling gargoyles and statues inside and out. The square central
tower was scraped down several inches to remove decay.
   The work saved the great church, yet ``it's a slightly mixed
blessing,'' said Worcester's dean, the Very Rev. Robert Jeffery, a
portly man with Ben Franklin glasses and tufts of untamed white
hair.
   ``They were tempted to do only the things that showed, and they
used some technologies which proved not to work.''
   Some problems come from the natural decay of stone, slate,
timber and lead, but the Victorians caused others by, for instance,
refacing walls with poor quality stone, bound to the original walls
with iron clamps that have rusted, expanded and burst the stone.
   ``Worcester's been a holding operation for years,'' Eacock said.
   So far, an $8 million crisis appeal has raised $7 million. A
flying buttress has been rebuilt and workers have begun rebuilding
the north porch. Each time scaffolding goes up, new problems are
detected.
   ``We keep losing track of the program,'' said Eacock, who has
spent 22 years at Worcester. ``We have a goal, then something else
comes up.''
   Victorian work is also a problem at Gloucester.
   ``What they chose just hasn't stood the test of time,'' said
Dean Kenneth Jennings, who launched an appeal last December for $8
million.
   Most cathedrals have been overhauled every 100 to 150 years, and
all the major ones were restored between 1860 and 1880.
   ``It was a mixture of scholarship and need'' that led to the
enthusiastic and often good work, said Alan Rome, the architect at
Salisbury. ``The 19th century was a period of the first
appreciation of medieval architecture.''
   Salisbury is in the fourth year of trying to raise $13 million
to save its famed 404-foot-high, 14th-century spire.
   Cathedrals also suffer wear and tear from bus loads of visitors,
many of whom drop pittances in donation boxes. Income from visitors
to Worcester rose 15 percent last year, to an average of 44 cents
apiece, Jeffery said.
   ``I always tell people, `Yes, come in, it's free. You don't have
to pay,''' said John Lamplugh, chief administrator at Winchester in
southern England. ```But if you don't do something, there won't be
anything here for your grandchildren.'''
   England's cathedrals, of which about 30 date from the Middle
Ages, are mostly smaller than their French and German counterparts.
They evolved, however, in highly individual ways: from the great
early Gothic frontal screens of statuary at Wells, Salisbury and
Lichfield to the elaborate fan vaults on the ceiling of Gloucester.
   The cathedrals, some once very wealthy, lived off their
endowments until 1840 when the Church of England distributed the
savings among smaller churches. In return, cathedrals were given
annual incomes which have been eaten away by inflation.
   ``By now, certainly, they bear little relation to the cost of
running a cathedral,'' said Dr. Richard Gem of the Cathedral
Advisory Commission, a church body of 20 experts and church
officials.
   Ely Cathedral, for instance, receives $120,000 annually to cover
all costs except the salaries of its dean and two canons, or
subdeans. By 1985, this did not even meet the cost of conducting
services in the building famed for its unique octagonal central
tower.
   Ely began charging admission in 1986. No other cathedral has
followed suit, though some make donations hard to avoid on
entering.
   The clergy at Lincoln tried to raise money by sending their copy
of the 13th-century Magna Carta to a world's fair in Australia in
1988. The venture ended up costing the cathedral $112,000.
   Attempts to raise $16 million for Hereford Cathedral caused a
national uproar after Dean Peter Haynes and the chapter, the
cathedral's governing body, decided to try to sell its 13th-century
Mappa Mundi.
   Taken aback by protests, the dean and chapter canceled plans to
auction the map, which shows Jerusalem at the center of a flat
world.
   In October, a new ``Care of Cathedrals'' measure paved the way
for state funding for the cathedrals.
   It's unclear how soon government money will be available, but
the Very Rev. Wesley Carr, dean of Bristol, isn't worried too much.
   ``We at cathedrals don't think in terms of five years, but in
terms of 800 years,'' he said.

   James Brolin's 30-year acting career has had
many incarnations and these days he's wearing several hats.
   In addition to serving as host of a new syndicated TV program,
he's working on a film, a miniseries, and a new police series.
   Brolin most often has been the leading man in series such as
``Hotel'' and movies such as ``Capricorn One,'' ``Westworld'' and
``Gable and Lombard,'' a bomb in which he portrayed screen hero
Clark Gable.
   This season, Brolin, who's turned down many series offers since
his original success as the young doctor in ``Marcus Welby, M.D.,''
is host of a heart-tugging TV series called ``Reunion.'' It brings
together friends and relatives who have become separated and seeks
those who heretofore have defied contact.
   The weekly series, which began in September, is seen on 130
television stations across the country.
   ``When they showed me a tape of what they were doing the tears
started flowing,'' he says. ``I figured if it could work on old
jaded me it should be a success. The show has a goodness to it.
We're not trying to catch crooks. I don't think there's any other
show that opens your heart like this.''
   But there's much more in store for Brolin:
   -He plays his first comedy role, as a hippie artist on the beach
in 1974, in the upcoming movie ``Love in Venice.''
   -In February he plays a murder victim in the CBS miniseries
``And the Sea Will Tell.''
   -Brolin and Barry Morrow, Oscar-winning co-writer of ``Rain
Man,'' have teamed up to develop an unorthodox police show for CBS.
Brolin will play a crime laboratory technician who loses his job in
a budget cutback and forces the city to make him a detective so he
can complete the years needed for retirement.
   -Brolin also told the producers of ABC's ``Young Riders'' he'd
like to direct an episode, and possibly co-star with his son Josh.
Two years ago they teamed up as father and son for Turner Network
Television's first original movie, ``Finish Line.''
   Brolin's iron-gray hair and beard is growing back after he
shaved his face clean and wore a crewcut for his role in ``And the
Sea Will Tell'' in Hawaii.
   ``I prefer the beard,'' he says. ``It's easier than shaving. I
started growing a beard in 1971. I've worn it most of the time. I
had it for `Hotel.' The people at `Reunion' don't care if I have
the beard or not.''
   Brolin, who earned an Emmy for his role on the long-running
series ``Marcus Welby, M.D.,'' is married to actress Jan Smithers,
who had a featured role as one of the few sane people on ``WKRP in
Cincinnati.''
   They have a 3-year-old daughter, Molly. Brolin has two sons from
an earlier marriage, Josh and Jess, who's in high school.
   Brolin has strong ties to Tahiti, where he and his family own 11
acres at Taravoa. His brother, Brian, is moving to Tahiti, and his
father, Henry, has spent time there as a land developer.
   ``In 1958 my Dad said he was sailing to theSouth Seas and asked
me to come along,'' he says. ``I said I was working on my career,
but then I went with him when I was signed to play Marlon Brando's
son in the remake of `Mutiny on the Bounty.'
   ``I didn't do the role but I spent seven months in Tahiti. My
family stayed for a year, and Dad helped show the Tahitians how to
convert some of the land from copra. We ended up buying land for a
hotel 30 years ago, and now it's right where they're going to build
a new city.''
   Brolin recently returned from Hawaii where he worked on ``And
The Sea Will Tell.'' It's based on Vincent Bugliosi and Bruce
Henderson's upcoming book about the disappearance of a San Diego
couple on a sailing cruise to tiny Palmyra Island south of Hawaii.
   ``At the same time a hippie couple sailed out of Hawaii bound
for the same island,'' Brolin says. ``Eight months later they
sailed back in the San Diego couple's boat, the Sea Wind. There
were no bodies so they were charged only with yacht theft. Six
years later they found the wife's bones and they were charged with
murder.''
   Brolin and Diedre Hall star as the San Diego couple who
disappeared. Rachel Ward and Hart Bochner are the young couple and
Richard Crenna appears as Bugliosi, one-time Manson Family
prosecutor who later served as defense attorney for the woman
defendant.
   The four-hour miniseries switches back and forth between the
courtroom and Palmyra.

   How do you perform a role made famous by someone
else? It's a problem faced in the New York theater this season by
such actors as Cathy Rigby, Linda Lavin, Topol and Judd Nelson.
   Try competing with the images of Mary Martin in ``Peter Pan,''
Ethel Merman or Tyne Daly in ``Gypsy,'' Zero Mostel in ``Fiddler on
the Roof'' and Jack Nicholson in the film version of ``Carnal
Knowledge.'' Memories are hard to dislodge.
   The ghosts of performances past are particularly potent for
Rigby, currently starring on Broadway as Peter Pan, a role forever
associated with Martin.
   To many people, Martin WAS the boy who refused to grow up,
particularly because of the widely seen television version now
available to a whole new audience on videocassette. There have been
other productions of ``Peter Pan'' too. Sandy Duncan starred in a
highly successful revival on Broadway and then on the road a decade
or so ago.
   ``I saw Sandy first,'' Rigby says. ``I watched her play Peter a
couple of times and was more inspired than anything from her
performance. In the beginning, I patterned my own performance after
hers because she was a wonderful example. Since then, it has
changed dramatically. Now I'm a very different Peter Pan.
   ``Mary Martin's portrayal was at a time when production values
were different. People were different, much calmer. There's a line
in `Peter Pan' that goes `Children know such a lot now.' It can
apply to any generation. It really applies to how children look at
``Peter Pan'' now vs. when we were watching shows like `Lassie' on
television years ago. It was just different. We believed a little
more easily.''
   For Rigby, the key has been preparation, not only for this role,
but for her entire acting career. The performer, who was a
gymnastic star of the 1972 Olympics, started in show business with
an arena tour of ``Peter Pan'' that she says was more ``Disney on
Parade'' than live theater. Everything was pre-recorded. After
that, she took voice and acting lessons for six years before she
ventured out on stage again.
   ``Gymnastics gives you confidence,'' Rigby says. ``You learn
that if you work at something you get better. Even when the
pressure is on, if you have the preparation, you're going to get
through it somehow.''
   She must be doing something right. Rigby's current tour of
``Peter Pan,'' which has been on the road for a year, could only
come to Broadway for six weeks because it already has commitments
on the lucrative touring circuit into next summer.
   Other actors aren't as confident. Stuart Howard, casting
director for such recent Broadway revivals as `Fiddler on the
Roof,'' ``Gypsy'' and ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' says there's one
basic reason performers shy away from well-known roles - fear.
   ``Many actors are frightened of someone else's memory,'' says
Howard, who experienced the problem last season when trying to cast
the role of Big Daddy, the dying Southern patriarch in a revival of
Tennessee Williams' ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.''
   Any actor playing Big Daddy must erase the portrait drawn by
Burl Ives who originally played the role on Broadway and in the
movie version that starred Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman.
   Several actors declined to audition for the ``Cat'' revival,
although the combination of the role, the play, its star - Kathleen
Turner as Maggie - and the director Howard Davies attracted a great
many other performers.
   And Charles Durning, the actor who eventually got the role, was
able to make it his own, walking off with most of the favorable
reviews and winning a Tony for his performance.
   All three of the revivals Howard worked on started with a star -
Turner, Topol and Tyne Daly - and then built the production around
them. But even Daly had to audition for director Arthur Laurents
and producers Fran and Barry Weissler.
   The actress, best known as half of television's ``Cagney and
Lacey,'' confronted the memory of Ethel Merman head-on. In
interviews before opening on Broadway, she would say, ``If you want
to hear Ethel Merman, stay home and listen to the record. I'm not
Ethel Merman. I won't be Ethel Merman. I'm Tyne Daly and if you'd
like to see me do a show, then come.''
   A good director can also help a performer overcome memories of a
star and make a revival more than a museum piece.
   ``Everything with `Gypsy' was done fresh - new sets, new
costumes, new lighting,'' Howard says. ``And a new approach.
Laurents built it around Tyne Daly. He built it around her
personality. He did not have her copy Ethel Merman in any way.''
   When Linda Lavin replaced Daly, she had the additional problem
of competing against recent memories as well as past ones. Despite
mixed reviews, Lavin thrived in the role, extending the life of the
revival by six months.
   Merman's memory also hovered over a new complete recording of
``Girl Crazy,'' the Gershwin show that made the bold, brassy singer
a star. The unenviable task of belting out ``I Got Rhythm'' fell to
Lorna Luft, a singer with a softer style than Merman's.
   ``I wasn't intimidated at all,'' Luft says. ``I had done the
show before in Michigan so I was familiar with the material.
Besides, I was honored and grateful to be part of this historic
album.''
   Judd Nelson, along with Justine Bateman, Jon Cryer and Karen
Byers, had a harder time with the stage version of Jules Feiffer's
``Carnal Knowledge.'' Feiffer actually wrote the play before doing
the screenplay for the critically acclaimed 1971 movie version.
   But the powerful and controversial film, which starred Jack
Nicholson, Candice Bergen, Art Garfunkel and Ann-Margret, dwarfed
the play and when comparisons were made by theater critics, the
movie and its stars came off better than the play and its young
performers.
   Topol had a different problem with ``Fiddler on the Roof.'' For
many audiences, his performance as Tevye the milkman and not
Mostel's original Broadway performance was the definitive one.
Topol had played the role in the original London production and in
the movie nearly 20 years ago. In a sense, he was competing with
himself.
   ``I think it's a very different performance today,'' Howard
says. ``It's much more humorous, and now Topol really is the right
age to play Tevye.''
   Still, each production, regardless of its stars, has to stand or
fall by itself.
   ``The thing we had to do with this production of `Peter Pan' is
that despite all the special effects - the flying, the fog, the
Mylar and all that - you're not going to compete with Steven
Spielberg, so you'd better just tell the story and you'd better
tell it well, '' Rigby says.

   ``The Godfather Part III''
   
   Francis Ford Coppola's operatic upbringing dominates his best
films. The first two ``Godfathers'' were jammed with lush music and
violent drama. The most memorable part of ``Apocalypse Now'' was
the helicopter raid accompanied by Richard Wagner.
   Coppola reaches his operatic height with the climax of ``The
Godfather Part III.'' While ``Cavalleria Rusticana'' thunders on a
Palermo stage, assassinations take place at the theater, in a mafia
headquarters and deep within the Vaitcan. Even the Pope is not
spared.
   This is Coppola at his demonic best, combining sublime music,
brutal murder and miraculous editing for the ultimate film
experience. What goes before will please some ``Godfather''
devotees and disappoint others. Taken alone, ``Godfather III''
could be considered film storytelling of the highest order.
Comparisons are unavoidable, and it would have been superhuman for
Coppola to excel the Academy Award-winning ``The Godfather'' and
``The Godfather Part II.''
   While its predecessors had the inspired performances of Marlon
Brando, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall, James Caan and others, the
new film relies primarily on Al Pacino. He plays the aging don as a
tragic Hamlet, brooding and indecisive, reluctant to order bloody
deeds. In 1979, the Corleone family has gone legit, abandoning its
shady enterprises though not its ties to the ``Association.''
   The most gripping sequence comes when a renegade upsets an
Association meeting, this time in Atlantic City, not Appalachia.
After the upstart is dispatched in another brilliantly staged scene
of violence, the story shifts to Italy.
   Vatican finances have been looted by the Italian mafia, and Don
Corleone is enlisted to straighten things out. The power struggle
slows the pace, but all is settled in the climax.
   Andy Garcia, as Sonny Corleone's bastard son, is adopted by
Pacino as his chief lieutenant, and the young actor confirms his
star status. He is magnetic on the screen. Less so is Sofia
Coppola, who plays Pacino's daughter. The tragic love between her
and Garcia falls short.
   Pacino dominates the film with his powerful presence. Diane
Keaton, returning as his divorced wife Kay, strongly portrays his
unheeded conscience. The Corleone sister, Talia Shire, has been
transformed into Lady Macbeth; when murder of a rival gang leader
is discussed, she mutters to Garcia, ``Do it.''
   ``Godfather III'' is filled with fine actors: Eli Wallach, Joe
Mantegna, Bridget Fonda, Helmut Berger, Raf Vallone, Donal
Donnelly. Opera singer Franc D'Ambrosio is a standout as the
Corleone son who chooses music instead of working for the mob. It's
good to see George Hamilton, of course looking tanned and terrific,
though he has little to do but advise on finances.
   Coppola produced and directed the film and wrote it with Mario
Puzo. They have created a worthy continuation of the saga f one of
America's first families. It's a fond hope: Andy Garcia in ``The
Godfather Part IV.''
   The Paramount release is rated R for language and excessive
violence. Running time: 161 minutes.

   ``Bonfire of the Vanities''
   
   There's something about a Brian De Palma movie that's just not
right. There's always something off-center or riding the razor's
edge of sloppiness. It's like a well-dressed woman with perfect
makeup who opens her mouth to reveal a lipstick blotch on her
teeth, and whose dirty, torn slip shows beneath her hemline.
   ``Dressed to Kill'' started off as a fast-paced, slick erotic
tease and promptly slipped into a very careless B-movie.
``Scarface'' also had the promise of a hard edge with a lot of
tension and drama, and then deteriorated into a drug joke. ``The
Untouchables'' borrowed so heavily from other movies that it was
hard to get much honesty out of it.
   Now comes ``Bonfire of the Vanities,'' based on the novel by Tom
Wolfe. What's off about this latest De Palma work is that the movie
can't be taken seriously. The characters are straight out of a
comic strip and proceed through some cartoon-like situations. And
so, viewed in this way, it becomes an enjoyable romp.
   Sherman McCoy is a self-styled Master of the Universe who is a
millionaire and has an uptight, snotty wife and a spoiled, married
mistress, Maria. His very ordered and affluent life comes crumbling
down after his mistress runs over a man in the South Bronx, flees
the scene and leaves Sherman holding the bag.
   It's not just another hit and run. The victim is black, Sherman
and Maria are white. A local black minister, the Rev. Bacon, wants
to make the accident into a racial cause celebre. The district
attorney, who wants to run for mayor, needs minority votes and is
eager to prove that the city goes after white criminals just as
diligently as it does black criminals.
   Riding the periphery of it all is a down-and-out drunk whose
career in journalism is about to come to a screeching halt, Peter
Fallow. Fallow chronicles it all, gets the inside track and
ultimately produces a best-selling book.
   There are a few cute twists to the story of Sherman's fall and
Fallow's rise, but all are as predictable as Fallow's next drink.
   As Sherman, Tom Hanks, looking very odd with capped teeth and
precision cut hair, is somewhat jerky and nervous. He looks in pain
throughout the movie, like he's walking on glass and not quite sure
how to get off.
   Melanie Griffith has finally found her niche and is quite
believable as Maria Ruskin, a manipulating bubblehead.
   Bruce Willis somewhat overdoes the drunk routine for Fallow,
without much style. It becomes a trifle boring after a while. But
Willis is Willis and remains his acerbic self.
   About the only likeable character in the entire movie is Morgan
Freeman's Judge White. He also is the only character who bears any
semblance to reality.
   There's good support from Kim Cattrall as Judy McCoy, Saul
Rubinek as Jed Kramer, F. Murray Abraham as the DA and John Hancock
as Rev. Bacon.
   De Palma, who also produced, directed from a screenplay by
Michael Cristofer. Peter Guber and Jon Peters were executive
producers. ``Bonfire of the Vanities'' is rated R for language,
sexual content, adult situations.

   If you just must know the sex of your eggplants, or you
desperately want to learn the proper way to open a quail egg, a
clever new videotape will be welcomed.
   But don't think ``Trucs of the Trade'' is only for food
fanatics.
   The 72-minute program is witty and informative: Forty-eight fine
chefs offer 93 ``trucs,'' French for gimmick or shortcut, that
either will make you wonder how you got along without them or
wonder who on earth would need them.
   Either way you'll have fun seeing the chefs in their kitchens,
hearing them chat about spouses or children (charming French and
Italian accents abound), and watching them handle food.
   Lidia Bastianich of Felidia in New York City explains how to
tell an eggplant's sex, explaining that female eggplants are the
bitterer sex. Barbara Tropp of the China Moon Cafe in San Francisco
demonstrates making a cucumber fan. Writer Craig Claiborne shows
how to cut and present a mango.
   To tenderize meats, Felipe Rojas-Lombardi of the Ballroom in New
York suggests adding a wine cork or two to the pot.
   Writer Rose Levy Beranbaum, daughter of a dentist, shows how to
cut a cheesecake with dental floss. Andre Soltner of New York's
Lutece makes the ``perfect'' omelet. And Jean-Louis Palladin of
Jean-Louis at Watergate in Washington opens the quail egg.
   Each truc is brief, with many under a minute. The sponsor,
Kobrand Wines &amp; Spirits, seems somewhat intrusive with repeated
mentions of its wines, despite useful tips on buying and serving
wine. But it's easy to be forgiving since 50 cents from the sale of
each copy of the video goes to Share Our Strength, a food
professionals charity to fight hunger.
   ``Trucs of the Trade'' sells for $19.95.

   New on video this week:
   ``Longtime Companion'' (Vidmark. $89.95. Rated R): A moving

in this look at the devastation of a people.
   ``My Blue Heaven'' (Warner Home Video. $92.95. Rated PG-13): An
idiotic look at the federal witness protection program with
stereotypes galore. Stars Steve Martin as a goofy con man and Rick
Moranis as an FBI agent.

   Elizabethan Christmas Anthems (Amon Ra) - Red Byrd and the Rose
Consort of Viols.
   For Unto Us a Child Is Born (CRD) - Choir of New College,
Oxford; Collegium Novum Ensemble, directed by Edward Higginbottom.
   Heinrich Schutz: Die Weihnachtshistorien (Hyperion) - The King's
Consort, directed by Robert King.
   20th Century Christmas Collection (Collins) - The Sixteen,
directed by Harry Christophers.
   
   Three new recordings for Christmas reflect some profitable
digging in the more or less obscure repertory of the 17th century.
   Red Byrd has exhumed some genuine rarities such as ``Upon my
lap,'' a moving lullaby set by Martin Peerson, who was organist at
St. Paul's Cathedral in the early 1600s. Quite as obscure is the
``Starre Anthem'' by John Bull, who worked at the Chapel Royal
before decamping to Belgium, and the verse anthem ``O Ye Little
Flock'' by John Amner, who worked in the splendid isolation of Ely
Cathedral. The clarity of the singing goes a long way to atone for
the inadequate notes, which are devoid of texts.
   In this recording, professional singers try to sound like
skilled amateurs in a manor house, a thoroughly unnecessary stab at
one facet of authenticity. Orlando Gibbons' verse anthems ``This Is
the record of John'' and ``See, see the word is incarnate'' are
better known - and, without doubt, sound better - in recordings by
cathedral choirs. But Red Byrd's rough-hewn singing is always
professional, and the playing of the Rose Consort of Viols is
polished and pleasant.
   The disc is worth hearing simply for the ``Lullaby'' by the
great William Byrd, which was also recorded a few years ago by The
Tallis Scholars. The best-known song is by anonymous, ``Sweet was
the song the virgin sang.''
   The Choir of New College has a modern version of that last song,
set by Oliver Johnstone, a 13-year-old member of the choir. The
album's strengths, however, come from the grand polychoral style of
the 17th century. Supplemented by sacbuts, strings and organ, the
choir makes bright work of Heinrich Schutz's awesome ``Hodie
Christus natus est,'' J.H. Schein's ``Quem vidistis pastores'' and
Samuel Scheidt's carol-like ``Puer natus.''
   The King's Consort recording of Schutz's ``Christmas Story''
earns the ultimate American Bandstand accolade - you can dance to
it. At least you might for the last two minutes, when Schutz lets
rip with a rollicking, syncopated blast of trumpets and chorus, an
inspired combination of high art and high spirits. Amazing music to
have come from a 75-year-old man.
   In contrast to such joyful noises, the collection of
20th-century music by The Sixteen is better suited to candlelight
and quiet in the hours past midnight. The best songs are Benjamin
Britten's gorgeous ``Hymn to the Virgin,'' John Tavener's ``The
Lamb'' and Herbert Howells' more familiar ``A spotless rose.''
   On the more rambunctious side, The Sixteen include William
Walton's hearty ``Make we joy now in this fest,'' and John
Gardner's setting of ``Tomorrow shall be my dancing day.'' On the
obnoxious side, in parts, is Peter Maxwell Davies' ``O magnum
mysterium,'' which has moments of those odd popping and beeping
noises which make ``modern'' synonymous with ``tedious.''

   ``The Immaculate Collection'' (Sire) - Madonna
   
   Is anyone really surprised that Madonna has managed to generate
the biggest controversy of the holiday music buying season with her
sexy video to ``Justify My Love''?
   The Forbes magazine cover girl is the savviest marketer on the
music scene, with a keen sense of how to push the envelope of
public respectability enough to keep her detractors' tongues
wagging, her supporters cheering and herself on the front page.
   Not surprisingly, ``The Immaculate Collection'' - a greatest
hits package with a title itself a tweak at the Catholic church -
is flying out of the stores.
   The CD, however, may surprise those who view Madonna with a
jaundiced eye. It's terrific.
   Placing all those hits back to back to back makes clear that
she's managed, over the past six years, to record some of the
finest pop music of our time. Although the ``Q-Sound'' recording
technique isn't as revolutionary as hailed, the remixed songs
crackle and spark.
   ``Holiday,'' though not quite the groundbreaker described in the
CD's hyperbolic liner notes, is a buoyant introduction to Madonna's
style. ``Like a Virgin'' and ``Like a Prayer,'' stripped of the
hype that surrounded their videos, stand strong musically.
   What seem most impressive, in retrospect, are the songs that
didn't grab immediate attention because they were the second or
third singles off albums, such tunes as ``Cherish'' or ``Express
Yourself.'' Clearly inspired by 1960s artists and songs, they're
nonetheless stamped with style.
   The only bad choice is the forgettable ``La Isla Bonita,'' which
could have been replaced by ``Burnin' Up'' from the first album or
the swinging ``Hanky Panky'' off her latest record.
   The two new songs also warrant inclusion in this collection, not
just because one has already become a hit. ``Justify My Love,''
while slight musically, smolders with Madonna's sexuality and Lenny
Kravitz's rhythm track.
   And the final cut, ``Rescue Me,'' is nothing less than a
statement of purpose. Part-dance pop, part-rap, she sings of the
redemptive power of love in a voice that growls sensually and purrs
with sweetness.
   Say what you will about Madonna's clothes, her attitude, her
videos. Musically - where it counts - she's right on target with
``The Immaculate Collection.''

   ``Hell's Ditch'' (Island) - The Pogues
   
   The problem with the Pogues - some would say their appeal -
always has been a reckless approach that resulted in a wildly
uneven mix of music, from unlistenable punk rants to interminable
Irish laments, with some really fine music in between.
   On ``Hell's Ditch,'' their fifth U.S. release, the Pogues manage
to stick to the middle ground. They are tamed by producer Joe
Strummer, who gained vast experience as a leader of the Clash in
making passionate music palatable. The result is a consistently
enjoyable record.
   Nine of the 13 cuts were written or co-written by vocalist Shane
MacGowan, whose brilliantly dark poetry revels in liquor, lust and
life in the gutter. It's not a very pretty world but it sort of
sounds like fun.
   The eight-member band keeps things moving briskly along, prodded
by Spider Stacy's whistle and a bevy of acoustic instruments. And
when they slow down, as on the short, dreamy ballad ``Summer in
Siam,'' the results are sweet indeed.
   - By David Dishneau, Associated Press Writer.

<TEXT>
   Debra Winger is pondering life. Her left arm is
raised to eye level, the elbow perched on the opposite wrist, and
her cigarette slants upwards as it rests between her fingers.
   The actress spent six months in the Sahara filming ``The
Sheltering Sky'' and in some ways she hasn't quite returned. ``It's
a joke, isn't it?'' she says, looking around, taking in the hotel
restaurant opened especially for her.
   But her career still matters, more than ever. Winger works full
time - reading, thinking, talking - looking for self-knowledge that
can be collected and stored for future roles and looking for roles
that can bring her self-knowledge.
   ``My life affects my work and work affects my life,'' Winger
explains. ``I work more and more towards homogenization. I don't
want to be the sort of person who puts on a hat by the door and
goes out. You have to find a way to intermingle the two. You have
to find a way to show your growth in your work.''
   ``The Sheltering Sky,'' based on Paul Bowles' acclaimed 1949
novel, stars Winger and John Malkovich as a wealthy American couple
who travel through the desert in Africa, discovering unpleasant
truths about their marriage and themselves. Bernardo Bertolucci
directed, his first film since the Academy Award-winning ``The Last
Emporer.''
   ``She was saved from beauty by the intensity of her gaze,''
Bowles wrote of Winger's character. But life and art have separated
this afternoon. Winger's blue eyes, so animated on screen, are
soft, almost indistinguishable from the rest of her face; her
calmer self has risen to the top.
   She sums up the past in two words: ``No regrets.'' Not about
fights with directors and fellow actors, not about her brief
marriage to actor Timothy Hutton, not about turning down the part
in ``Broadcast News'' that made a star of Holly Hunter.
   Two other words momentarily upset her, make her gag and cough as
if someone had put a fly in her coffee. The words are ``turbulent
brilliance,'' and they were used by Shirley MacLaine on Academy
Awards night in 1984 to assess her ``Terms of Endearment'' co-star.
   ``I have a T-shirt that Shirley gave me the day after the
Academy Awards when she felt the necessity to call me turbulent and
brilliant instead of just brilliant,'' said Winger, who lost to
MacLaine for best actress.
   ``She heard I was a little rattled, and the T-shirt said
`Turbulent Means Brilliant.' Oh, give me a break! If it needs an
explanation, don't say it.''
   On sand or on pavement, it's been a bumpy ride for Winger, born
in Cleveland in 1955. Her decision to become an actress was,
fittingly, turbulent, a matter quite literally of life and death.
   On New Year's Eve 1973, she was thrown from a moving truck and
nearly died from a cerebral hemorrhage. Winger was studying
sociology and criminology at the time, but quickly lost interest.
   ``I wanted to act before, but I was still under the pull of my
parents and sort of under the middle-class work ethic. It was a
hobby, you know, you don't actually do that for a living.
   ``But when somebody experiences death, near death, you realize
you're all alone at the end. And I said I can't do something
another day that I won't be completely fulfilled in.''
   In such films as ``An Officer and a Gentleman'' and ``Terms of
Endearment,'' Winger acts as if the screech of the truck's tires
still rings in her ears. Her lips tremble. Her head shakes. Her
eyes consume entire rooms. She pushes a baby carriage with the
intensity of a lumberjack chopping wood. She makes listening to
Ethel Merman seem like an act of defiance.
   Winger admits to problems with drugs and temperament in the
past, but insists they didn't keep her from working, that she knew
which experiences were best to draw on.
   An old story about John Barrymore draws out her bubbly, staccato
laugh. The actor was in London, supposedly to star in ``Hamlet,''
but spending most of his time chasing women.
   Hours before opening night, he succeeded. His dress rehearsal
consisted of scotch, wine and a hospitable duchess. He arrived a
half hour before curtain time and passed out in his dressing room.
   ``I was the first American to play Hamlet on a London stage -
and I was also the first drunk to play it on any stage in the
world,'' he recalled.
   The lights made him dizzy. He had to lean on another actor to
keep from falling down. He would exit in the middle of a scene and
vomit in the wings. He performed his soliloquy sprawled in a chair.
   ``But I missed no words of Will Shakespeare's and I missed no
cue,'' Barrymore boasted. The critics raved, never had turbulence
and brilliance worked so well together. Art had triumphed over
life, or was it the other way around?
   ``For every actor, there's that adrenalin that gets going once
the curtain goes up or once the camera starts rolling. Only for me,
the process begins a little sooner,'' Winger says.
   ``Sometimes I feel like the town idiot. People can be saying
terrible things about me, people can hate me, but I don't care, I
just want to keep doing what I'm doing.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Rock 'n' Roll Will Keep You Young - Or Kill You</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ANTCZAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tell Ringo Starr he's one of the elder
statesmen of rock 'n' roll and he interrupts.
   ``I'm probably the eldest statesman,'' he corrects.
   But he says it in that Ringo voice, instantly familiar and
unchanged although its owner is 50 years old and light years past
his Beatle days.
   ``Rock 'n' roll keeps you young - if it doesn't kill you, of
course,'' he explains.
   Starr has just released ``Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band,''
a compact disc recorded in concert during his 1989 tour with eight
veteran rockers, and he's already thinking about the lineup for
another All-Starr troupe.
   It's a different Ringo than the one who was better known over
much of the past decade for drinking than drumming. And the
enthusiasm has as much to do with last year's tour as his 1988
stint in an alcoholic recovery program.
   ``It was great proof to me that I could actually get up there
and play,'' he said. ``And it was great proof that all these
musicians that I've known all over the years, you know, still
thought they'd like to play with me.''
   The All-Starrs of 1989 were guitarists Nils Lofgren and Joe
Walsh, keyboard players Dr. John and Billy Preston, saxman Clarence
Clemons, drummers Jim Keltner and Levon Helm, and bass player Rick
Danko.
   Starr admits to wondering whether he could get on stage with
musicians of that caliber again, and whether they would want to get
up there with him.
   ``Most of the '80s I was incommunicado with the planet and you
know I wouldn't blame 'em, you know, because why would they want to
get up with this crazy drunken fool - and I didn't want to get up
anyway. I was too busy getting stupid.''
   Starr and his wife, actress Barbara Bach, spent five weeks in an
alcohol treatment program in 1988 and after that he had to ask
himself what he was going to do with his life. The All-Starr band
was the answer.
   ``I'm a musician and we went out there and we put it together,
and it was just a great mind-blower that it certainly worked and we
all had fun,'' he said.
   The Rykodisc CD has a dozen songs, but only five featuring
Starr: ``It Don't Come Easy,'' ``The No-No Song,'' ``Honey Don't,''
``You're Sixteen'' and ``Photograph.''
   The others are ``Iko Iko,'' by Dr. John; ``The Weight,'' with
Helm on vocals; ``Shine Silently,'' sung by Lofgren; ``Quarter to
Three,'' featuring Clemons; ``Raining in My Heart,'' with Danko at
the microphone; ``Will It Go Round in Circles,'' by Preston; and
``Life In The Fast Lane,'' featuring Walsh.
   Starr is intent on getting beyond his Beatles past.
   ``Someone already said, `Well, you don't have ``Little Help from
My Friends,'' ``Yellow Submarine.''' Well, you know, that's not the
point here. The point is the band that was on tour, and this is
what we felt would make the best CD.''
   It's fun, he says, being able to step out front and sing, but
not have to stay there, stepping back to let others have the
spotlight.
   Starr doesn't know yet who will be in the next All-Starr band
because some of last year's members will almost certainly have
other commitments. But Starr is certain to have an audience
regardless of the complement.
   The '89 tour drew fans ranging from children on up to adults as
old as 70. Children under 7 were let in free with their parents to
make the problem of finding baby sitters no impediment, he said.
   A lot of the kids were more familiar with Starr as the tiny Mr.
Conductor of the PBS television show ``Shining Time Station.'' The
children's show includes a storybook segment from ``Thomas the Tank
Engine and Friends,'' an English show Starr narrated.
   Starr has no trouble seeing himself as a family entertainer, and
apparently neither do the fans.
   ``You have to grow up and everybody's grown up with me,'' he
said. ``The albums and CDs sell constantly and I'm always getting
letters from kids. You know kids will stop me in the street who are
much too young to have been around when we (the Beatles) were
actually working.
   ``I think they honestly know I was in this huge, monster band
and it actually meant something, but I think the most important
thing about it is that the records still hold up. ... Of course,
I've also got them coming at my face now about Thomas the Tank and
`Shining Time Station.' They're holding little babies up now; it'll
never end.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Willie Morris Captures the Faulkner Spirit</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON HARRIST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Willie Morris' ``good ole boy'' love for
the South and fascination for author William Faulkner have produced
a moving tribute to the life and times of the late Nobel Prize
winner in ``Faulkner's Mississippi.''
   ``He was a fellow Mississippian and a fellow writer, and I
wanted to present him as a human being, not as an icon,'' said
Morris, whose books ``North Toward Home,'' ``Terrains of the
Heart'' and ``Good Old Boy and the Witch of Yazoo'' spun
mind-capturing tales of his own boyhood days in Yazoo City.
   ``Faulkner's Mississippi,'' rich with photographs of the Oxford
area that was Faulkner's home and the setting for his mythical
Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, is a spinoff of a 1989 magazine
article on Faulkner by Morris.
   ``A few months after the article came out in National
Geographic, I remarked to Willie that it had been so highly
acclaimed it should be expanded into a book,'' said Larry Wells of
the Oxford-based Yoknapatawpha Press and a longtime Morris friend
who edited the text of the book.
   Morris, writer in residence at the University of Mississippi,
approaches Faulkner's life with the insight of a writer who, while
aware of Faulkner's literary impact, is able to tap into the heart
of a man whose neighbors both loved and reviled him in the same
breath.
   ``His spirit is still here, of course: in the woodsmoke of
November from the forlorn country shacks, in the fireflies in
driftless random in the town in June, in the summer wisteria on the
greenswards and the odor of verbena, in the ruined old mansions in
the Yocona bottoms, in the echoes of an axe on wood and of dogs
barking far away, in the languid human commerce on the courthouse
square, in the aged whites and blacks bantering on the brick wall
beside the jail,'' Morris writes in introducing Faulkner to his
readers.
   In an interview, Morris said: ``I tried to assess in the most
human way the way Faulkner's native Mississippi and the South
shaped him as a man and as an artist and also the way that he
shaped Mississippi and the South.''
   ``Faulkner, both as a writer and as a person, shaped Willie
Morris,'' he added. ``Indeed, I think almost every Southern writer,
indeed, almost every American writer, has tried to deal with
Faulkner. Walker Percy called him the curse of every American
writer because his work was so monumental.''
   ``I hope people realize through this work that Faulkner's land
is still here,'' said Morris, a Rhodes Scholar who became the
youngest editor in chief ever at Harper's magazine.
``Parenthetically, I think his work today has more of an impact and
relevance that it did in its own day. I still see his Yoknapatawpha
County everywhere, not only spiritually but emotionally.''
   The 160-page, oversize book ($50) contains 60 pages of color
photographs by William Eggleston. The book was packaged by Atticus
Press and Yoknapatawpha Press and published by Oxmoor House in
Birmingham, Ala.
   ``This work was a natural for Willie,'' Wells said, ``because he
knows Mississippi in his soul, and his description of Faulkner's
Mississippi, both the real and fictional Yoknapatawpha County,
evoke the past and the present in much the same way Faulkner's own
work did.''
   Morris brought a special sensitivity to the work. As former
editor of Harper's, he supported and encouraged his fellow writers
and that sympathy is very much in evidence in this book.
   His portrait of Faulkner is very revealing - a prodigal son,
``Count No Count'' who wrote the sensational thriller ``Sanctuary''
in 1931 and was dubbed the ``Corncob Man.''
   The book also presents a funny and poignant treatment of
Faulkner's finances - noting he had to go to Hollywood and write
screen plays to earn a living in the 1930s and '40s.
   Perhaps the best section is Morris' treatment of Faulkner and
civil rights.
   ``This is a subject that Willie has written a couple of books
about and he knows all its ramifications,'' Wells said.
   Morris describes Faulkner's stand in trying to be a moderating
force in a time of hysteria and passion in a way that helps the
reader understand both the man and the times.
   Perhaps one sentence provides the best example of Morris'
understanding of Faulkner and his land: ``This haunted countryside
around Oxford is dotted with crumbling houses darkly resonating the
past and the vanished people who once lived in them, and I sense
the author was as possessed by them as Poe was of being buried
alive - the stirrings of old twilight conversations, of mute
possessions and fears and loves in the gone charters of time.''
   ``I wanted to offer a genuine human portrait of the man,''
Morris said. ``Just how he had the fortitude and endurance to
produce those monumental words. He was a very complicated human
being of course, but at the same time he was only human.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Merle Kilgore Is a Link Between Generations</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To Hank Williams Jr., country music
singer Merle Kilgore is more than just an intimate associate: He's
the superstar's uncle, father, big brother and best friend.
   He's also a link to another generation of country music.
   Kilgore, 56, has the distinction of being associated with both
Hank Williams Jr. and his father, Hank Williams Sr., who was
country music's top star in the early 1950s.
   Since 1986, Kilgore has been Hank Williams Jr.'s personal
manager and executive vice president and chief executive officer of
Hank Williams Jr. Enterprises. He's known the performer since
Williams was born and sang with him for more than 20 years.
   Some 40 years ago, Kilgore was doing less glamorous work for the
senior Williams.
   ``I was a go-fer,'' the voluble Kilgore recalled in an
interview. ``I helped set the stage, helped sell programs and
loaded the instruments in the trailer. He'd give me $5 every now
and then.
   ``My life is strange. It seems like a circle: that somehow I've
always been connected with the Williams family.''
   Right now he oversees the business affairs for the younger
Williams, known for singing the introduction to ``ABC Monday Night
Football'' for the past two seasons.
   Kilgore directs a road crew of 32 and an office staff of 17
while making million-dollar business decisions for his boss, whose
hit records include ``All My Rowdy Friends (Are Coming Over
Tonight)'' and ``Born to Boogie.''
   After working for the senior Williams, who died in 1953, Kilgore
became a successful singer himself. He had recording contracts with
all the major Nashville record labels at one time or another.
   He has written or co-written more than 300 songs, including the
country hits ``Ring of Fire,'' ``Wolverton Mountain'' and ``More
and More.''
   He did a little acting along the way, appearing in the movies
``Coal Miner's Daughter'' and ``Nashville.''
   Not only has he worked with two of country music's all-time
greats, he also worked with Elvis Presley just as ``The King'' was
launching his career in the mid-1950s.
   In Shreveport, La., on the old Louisiana Hayride country music
show, Kilgore witnessed a rarity: a Presley failure. ``The first
time he sang on the Hayride, he bombed. It was shocking the way he
shook when he sang, and the audience just gasped.
   ``He came off the stage and looked at me and said, `I can't
believe this is not going over.'''
   But things changed on the second show of the night. ``He got
into the second verse of `That's All Right Mama,' and they
exploded.''
   Kilgore is a longtime friend of Audrey Williams, the wife of
Hank Williams Sr. and the mother of Hank Williams Jr. Through her,
he developed close ties to the younger Williams.
   Comparing father and son, Kilgore says: ``They are very much
alike. Hank can look at you just like his father used to. They both
loved hunting, fishing and sports.
   ``Hank Jr. loves football, and the `ABC Monday Night Football'
deal was a dream come true for him. ...
   ``And we found out Joe Montana (quarterback for the San
Francisco 49ers) psyched himself up for the Super Bowl by playing
`All My Rowdy Friends (Are Coming Over Tonight).'''
   The younger Williams became a top draw after surviving a
500-foot fall down a Montana mountain in 1975. Kilgore, who was
Williams' opening act for 21 years until turning to the business
side, was one of the first to visit him in the hospital.
   ``His head had split open like a melon. It tore off his nose.
His right eye popped out. It tore out his teeth and pallet. The jaw
was broken. His survival was a blessing of God.''

   Filmmaker St. Clair Bourne will be story
supervisor and artistic consultant for ``Bellevue Emergency!,'' a
new television cinema-verite series currently in production.
   The ``reality-based'' series, being filmed in the emergency ward
of Bellevue Hospital and elsewhere in the New York City area, will
have a continuing story but will feature real people instead of
actors.
   Bourne recently returned from Brazil where he was honored with a
retrospective of his work at the Cineclube Estacao Festival in Rio
De Janeiro. Twelve of Bourne's films were presented including
``Making Do the Right Thing,'' ``Langston Hughes: The Dream
Keeper'' and ``The Black and the Green.''
   ``Bellevue Emergency!'' will premier later this month on ABC.

   Justin Edwards - carpenter, amateur photographer, bicyclist and
sailing enthusiast - doesn't strike an observer as a sentimental
man. But after his girlfriend, Annie Chervin, admired a particular
engagement ring while they were window shopping one spring day in
1988, he quietly went back to the shop and bought it without
telling her.
   Fast forward now to a dinner on Feb. 21, 1989. Justin had
suggested they get dressed up, even though they were eating at
home. A $75 bottle of wine signaled a special occasion.
   ``The wine was wasted on me,'' recalls Annie, ``because after
Justin said `do you want to get married?' and I said `yes,' he
pulled out that ring and gave it to me.''
   Their thoughts quickly turned to an outdoor wedding. They could
see the perfect site by looking out their window. It was the
expansive lawn surrounding the apartment, which occupies part of a
landmark colonial house in South Salem, N.Y., a small town about 50
miles north of New York City.
   Typical of many couples these days, Annie and Justin already
were living together, and they planned to arrange and pay for their
wedding themselves. And they wanted a party that wouldn't offend
their parents' sense of decorum.
   As soon as their obliging landlord gave them permission to hold
the ceremony and reception on the grounds, Annie and Justin began
planning the wedding which would take place a little more than a
year later, on May 19, 1990.
   Their first budget estimate was $10,000, and they did manage to
keep costs to under $11,000. Ultimately, most of the cost was
covered by Annie's parents, Alexander and Edith Chernin of
Montreal, as a wedding gift.
   As a floral designer and photographic stylist, Annie, now 33,
says she knew she had the skills to plan a wedding with 80 guests.
``I already had done flowers for weddings and coordinated models,
props, logistics and food on many photographic shoots,'' she
recalls. Justin, 31, would lend moral support, help make decisions
and handle many of the technical chores, such as lighting and
sound.
   They agreed they wanted an informal yet dignified affair at
which their friends and far-flung families - she is originally from
Montreal and he is English - would get a chance to meet.
   ``Having everyone there from all the different aspects of our
life was important to us,'' says Justin.
   ``We started out with the thought of a non-traditional party,
but as we got closer to the date, it got more traditional,'' Annie
says.
   Taking on many of the tasks herself let her have things just as
she wanted and let her work with friends and acquaintances who
enjoyed creating the party as much as she did herself, she says.
   Annie started her planning by making a list of what she thought
she would need for the wedding and then went straight to the Yellow
Pages for names. She telephoned first for information about rental
costs and availability, following up with visits to those vendors
she considered good possibilities.
   When possible, she hired people she already knew. The caterer,
Danyell Ray of Greenwich, is a friend, as are the cake baker and
photographer. Otherwise, she relied on instinct, choosing people
who she felt were both professional and pleasant.
   One of the first important decisions was to find someone to
marry them. Annie is Jewish; Justin's grandfather was a minister,
and he grew up in a Church of England family. They wanted a
religious service that would be comfortable to both families.
   They asked the Rev. Scudder Edwards (not related to the groom),
minister of the nearby South Salem Presbyterian Church, to perform
the ceremony.
   ``He was sensitive to our desire to weave the two religions
together,'' recalls Justin.
   ``He was willing to take out the Holy Ghost but leave God in,''
says Annie.``He gave us a standard ceremony book to look at and
told us to put a bracket around any words that made us
uncomfortable.''
   This important matter settled, they moved on to select caterer,
menu, photographer, and music. They found rental sources for a
large tent with a dance floor, tables and chairs, dishes, glasses
and silver, tablecloths and portable toilet facilities.
   They also had to find restaurant locations for pre-wedding
events and lodgings for the many out-of-town guests, including her
family and friends from Canada and some of his relatives from
Britain (his parents, Michael and Shiela Edwards, live nearby in
Coventry, Conn). Clothing for the wedding party had to be selected.
   Annie created her own invitations, and with the help of a friend
who is a florist, chose and arranged the wedding flowers. She and
Justin taped the music for the wedding procession and recession.
And they chose a festive menu of interesting but healthful food.
   Brides often talk of being nervous as their wedding day
approaches, but for Annie and Justin, the hours rushed by as they
made their preparations.
   ``I didn't have time to be nervous,'' says Annie, who was up at
6:30 a.m. to start on flower arrangements. Besides the bouquet,
which florist Karen McGowan created with flowers Annie had chosen,
there were table decoratons for the tent and flowers and greens to
adorn the lawn where the service would be held.
   Justin was up by 7 a.m. and was soon at work on the sound system
and the temporary outdoor lighting he was rigging up with some help
from Michael Orcutt, one of his ushers. Annie's brother and sisters
set the tables, working from the model she set up for them.
   The day of an outdoor party is usually a worrisome time. Will
the weather cooperate? The morning of May 19 dawned chilly. The
winds were strong enough to occasion anxious glances skyward as the
day progressed.
   But there were few mishaps. One was minor damage to his truck
when Justin backed it out of the driveway into the path of an
oncoming car. The people in the other car were mollified when they
learned it was his wedding day.
   By 4:30 p.m., the wind had died down, the tables were set, the
flowers arranged, and there was just enough time for the couple to
duck into the house and change from jeans to wedding clothes. Each
dressed in a different area, since they observed the traditional
prohibition against the groom seeing the bridal gown before the
ceremony.
   Annie recalls it took her a half hour to shower, do her hair,
put on her makeup and put on her dress, an ethereal creation in
silk and lace.
   A few minutes past 5 p.m., the wedding procession began. With
their attendants, Justin and Annie strolled down a grassy path
under a grapevine trellis. And they were married in front of family
and friends, just as they'd planned.
   Then, after hors d'oeuvre on the terrace (minipizzas,
tofu-sesame meatballs, skewered swordfish and smoked salmon), the
guests moved into the heated tent to dance and dine on grilled
salmon, chicken, wild rice, salad, French cheeses and fruit and the
traditional English wedding cake of white iced fruitcake, served
buffet style.
   While everyone was still dancing, and white candles in glass
holders glittered like fireflies on the lawn, Annie and Justin
stole away to a quiet inn in Connecticut, certain that their
wedding was a fitting finale to their year of planning.

   As a floral designer, Annie Chervin looked forward to choosing
and arranging the flowers for her own wedding.
   So two days before her May 19 wedding, she and her sister,
Nancy, rose at 4 a.m. and drove 50 miles from South Salem, N.Y., to
New York City. By 5:30 a.m., they were strolling through the
wholesale flower market on the lower West Side.
   ``I didn't have any particular flowers in mind ahead of time. I
wanted to be inspired by what I saw in the market,'' she recalls.
   Annie found inspiration for her bridal bouquet in green lilies
and white lilies with burgundy veining. She bought beaded
eucalyptus to weave into a wreath for her hair and variegated ivy
for her flower girl's basket. She also bought sweet pea vines with
slender green pea pods already formed in case the two types of
lilies needed augmenting. For the mothers, grandmothers and groom's
sister, she bought gardenias and phalanopsis orchids.
   She decided she would pick some of the lily of the valley
growing in the garden at home for the flower girl's basket, the
bridesmaids' bouquets and as boutonnieres for the groom and his
attendants.
   To decorate a trellis under which the wedding procession would
pass, she bought stock in cream and white. For the buffet table she
chose a sheaf of a tall grass that looked like wheat and blue
delphinium and love-in-the-mist, as well as three big artichokes on
a stem.
   Each of the 12 dining tables would have a flowering herbal
topiary, which she had already ordered from a Connecticut herb
farm.
   After completing their flower market purchases three hours
later, Annie and Nancy stopped at Balducci's, a famous gourmet
produce shop in Greenwich Village, where they bought flowering kale
and other interesting-looking vegetables to further embellish the
buffet table.
   ``I didn't buy anything that would be hard to condition, such as
roses or greens with a milky substance,'' she says.
   Arriving home, she stripped off the leaves and trimmed the stems
of the flowers, then put them in vases with tepid water. ``I left
them in the garage, which was the perfect cool and dark place for
them.''
   There they sat until the morning of her wedding, when they were
arranged by Annie and her friend, Karen McGowan, also a florist.
   Annie spent $330 at the wholesale flower market and $125 for the
topiaries. Her cost of $475 is just under the $478 that Bride's
Magazine says is the average expenditure for flowers at weddings.
   In choosing unusual blossoms and mixing commercially grown
flowers with garden flowers, herbs and vegetables, she was
revealing a romantic sensibility that is in keeping with bridal
trends which emphasize novelty and originality in both selection of
blooms and their arrangement.
   ``People don't want to look at a book and order number 24. They
want something unusual,'' says Alexandra Randall, a florist and
photo stylist in St. James, N.Y.
   How unusual? Recently Randall executed a bridal bouquet in the
form of a boa of heather and 100 roses, which the bride wore around
her shoulders and draped over her arms.
   Floral designers also are improving on nature. For a recent
issue of Bride's, Randall created a flower by inserting a bundle of
six miniature Serena roses into a large lily. The bouquet
containing several of these fantasy flowers was set off with a
border of lady's mantle, a green herb that looks like curly parsley
or green baby's breath.
   For the same issue of the magazine, floral designer Curtis
Godwin inserted a spray of lily of the valley into each of several
large yellow calla lily blooms on a single stalk, so the entire
bouquet emerges from one stem.
   Though unusual today, the idea of stuffing smaller blossoms into
larger ones was popular in earlier eras, says Randall. The
Victorians did it, and in the 1950s, there was a craze for
so-called ``glamelias.'' The creations were actually gladiolus
flowers arranged one inside the other to create the look of a
multipetaled camellia.
   These days there is little need to imitate out-of-season flowers
because air transportation and improvements in breeding techniques
have led to almost constant availability of all types of flowers,
says Rocky Pollitz, a vice president of Teleflora, a floral wire
service based in Los Angeles. ``If you are willing to pay for them,
your wedding flowers can be virtually anything you might wish
for,'' she says.
   Choosing unexpected flowers is just one way to achieve
originality. Unusual bouquet shapes are another. One new look is a
waterfall bouquet in which the flowers are arranged in a cascade of
bloom, says Pollitz. Heart-shaped bouquets, pomander balls on wands
and tiny nosegays of miniature flowers are some other examples of
fashionable styles. Fresh flowers also are often entwined in the
hair, arranged to cover a chignon or used to trim a hat.
   Color trends in floral bouquets include multicolor mixtures and
unexpected color combinations, such as champagne roses and beige
stock with deep purple pansies or English lavender. Instead of the
traditional all-white or pale bouquet, many brides are choosing
colorful arrangements. Many quite naturally select their flowers to
complement their dresses, especially those in a period style.

   Both practicality and sentiment had a part in Annie Chervin's
wedding dress choice.
   The Westchester County, N.Y., bride had her French vanilla silk
gown made to order. It was a copy of a $3,000 dress that she tried
on in an upscale department store but cost her less than half -
$1,220. It had the same peau de soie bodice, off-the-shoulder
neckline appliqued with satin rosettes and graceful skirt of four
layers of tulle.
   ``Part of me wanted to buy the expensive dress,'' recalls Annie.
Her future mother-in-law, Shiela Edwards, burst into tears when she
saw Annie model it in the store.
   But the dress cost far more than Annie had planned on spending.
So she sketched it from memory and had a dressmaker re-create it.
In choosing this design, she followed a style that has long been
popular among brides.
   The bridal dress with layered skirt of tulle or organza attached
to a fitted plain or beaded bodice is an enduring style, says
Rachel Leonard, fashion editor of Bride's Magazine. The bodice may
have less ornamentation than it did in versions of earlier years.
   Another perennial is the sculptured cut, in which the shape and
outline of the dress is its most important characteristic. There
may be a peplum, or the dress may have an enormous ballgown skirt
and a portrait neckline.
   Over the past few years, brides have been exercising more
individuality in dressing as the number of available styles has
increased. Leonard discerns two strong directions: Some brides
dress daringly, while others choose the demure, covered-up styles
of tradition.
   Well-known couture designers like Arnold Scaasi and Carolina
Herrera have injected a sophisticated stylishness to many wedding
dress designs. In the vanguard are very short dresses. These may
have a detachable overskirt or train in longer lengths. Bare
shoulders and low necklines, which once would have been
unthinkable, now are often found in wedding dresses.
   Traditional lace has been re-emerging as a favored bridal dress
material. And if the bride doesn't have an ancestor who obligingly
left her an heirloom gown, she can shop for one in an antiques
store.
   At least three stores in New York City carry old bridal dresses,
and there are similar stores in other parts of the country,
according to Leonard. The dresses usually have been cleaned and
reconditioned and can be altered to fit.
   Ann Lawrence Antiques in New York, for example, stocks more than
500 antique dresses and new dresses constructed of antique
materials. Lawrence says she sells dresses priced from $500 to
$15,000 to brides all over the country.
   To find antique bridal dresses, she advises contacting the
curator of a museum costume collection or a local antiques dealers'
association, who would be likely to know costume specialists who
handle these dresses.
   It's often hard to tell how much a dress might have cost.
Bride's Magazine says the average price paid for a bridal dress is
$794. Prices can range from about $250 to $20,000.
   ``The best buys in terms of sophisticated styles, fine fabrics
and hand detailing are found in dresses that cost between $1,200 to
$1,600,'' says Leonard.
   Dresses under $700 are more likely to be informal in style and
of synthetic rather than real silk. However, the bride won't have
to sacrifice beading, which is being done inexpensively in the Far
East.
   The choice and stylishness of bridesmaid's dresses has come a
long way, too, says Leonard. Sheer fabrics in prints look
appropriate with the light and airy wedding dresses which are
popular now.
   ``Short is a big trend in bridesmaid's dresses, both because of
the influence of shorter skirts in fashion generally and because it
is a young and fresh look which most bridal attendants look good
in,'' says Leonard. And these dresses usually can be worn again.
   Popular color choices are pink, which is flattering to most
people, and blue. The black and white and all-white wedding color
schemes continue to be popular.
   Matched outfits are still the rule if there are several
bridesmaids, but anything goes in terms of style and color, says
Gerard Monaghan, director of the Association of Bridal Consultants
in New Milford, Conn. But considerations of the bridesmaid's figure
type and complexion are more important than ditating an unbecoming
style simply to match a theme, he says. And more bridesmaid's
dresses are being bought off the rack in retail shops rather than
from bridal specialists.
   Dresses worn by mothers of the bridal pair usually are
coordinated to the wedding style and complement but do not match
each other.
   Men's attire is geared toward the degree of formality and time
of day. Elegance and appropriateness are the two most important
considerations, according to Leonard. Novelty bow ties and vests
are a way to give the groom and his attendants a personal
signature. There's a trend to coordinate the men's cummerbunds and
ties with the bridesmaids' dresses. Often, the groom's attire is
differentiated from his attendants' by an unusual tie and
cummerbund. Novelty fabrics such as shadow stripe or textured
suiting are being used. And the cropped jacket known as a Spencer
continues to be popular among younger men.

   The invitation sets the tone for the wedding to come, so it's
not surprising that there are new styles in invitations to go along
with changes in weddings.
   Couples who are paying for and organizing their own wedding
often rewrite the standard wording form. They also may choose
something more colorful than the traditional black-ink-on-ecru
stock.
   Handwritten or computer-generated calligraphy, original artwork
such as a caricature of the couple or a floral design may be
reproduced on the invitations. Handmade paper, a scroll with
antique lettering or a box instead of an envelope are among some
ideas being used.
   ``People who come to us want something different, not the
standard engraved invitations,'' says Barbara Logan of Rockville,
Md., who markets a line of invitations in which rose or cornflower
petals, Queen Anne's Lace or bits of lace fabric are impregnated in
handmade paper in pink, violet, blue, cream or white. The
invitation itself is printed on a parchment sheet inserted under
the decorative cover with ribbon or tassel.
   Logan says many brides are coordinating invitations, reply cards
and thank-you notes to the wedding's color theme. Prices for floral
petal paper invitations start at $4 and go up to $6 for the lace.
They are sold at craft shops and stationery stores across the
country. For information, call 1 (800)-458-9143.
   It's also possible to send out a wedding invitation in a plastic
wine or champagne bottle, says Elaine Barker, owner of Paper
Potpourri in Haverhill, Mass. The unbreakable bottle can be sent
through the mail with a 45- or 85-cent stamp, depending on its
size.
   One recent order she handled was for 150 invitations screened
with a watercolor, with response cards and notes for gift
thank-yous. Cost was about $1,000, she says.
   Reproducing a pen-and-ink sketch on the invitation might cost
about $2 for each invitation, plus $150 for the original drawing.
   In line with this new trend, Annie Chervin of South Salem. N.Y.,
created her own invitation. She drew a caricature of herself and
her groom, Justin Edwards, in wedding attire for the cover and
designed a map with directions to the wedding location for the back
of the invitation. She wrote out the text in her own clear
longhand.
   ``I experimented with unconventional wording but went back to
the traditional wording because I felt this would please both sets
of parents,'' she says.
   Since she knew how to prepare the necessary mechanical -
finished drawings and text - she was able to deliver camera-ready
material to the printer. Ordering and paying for 100 invitations,
she was pleasantly surprised to receive 150. The cost of $120 was
well below the $286 which, according to Bride's Magazine, is the
average spent on invitations, announcements and thank-you notes.
Annie saved money by asking guests to reply by telephone instead of
including a reply card to be mailed.
   Despite innovations, don't write off the traditional engraved
invitation. It's alive and well, says Dina Clason, senior
stationery buyer at Tiffany's in New York.
   ``Being Tiffany's, we are, of course, extremely traditional. We
used to see more demand for unusual invitations, but these days,
people don't want to stand out and be unique and different.''
   In one respect, Tiffany's has bent the rules. ``Technically a
reply card isn't correct, and we fought them for a long time. But
Americans do not reply without them,'' she says.
   The cost of a traditional-size engraved invitation at Tiffany's
is $365 for 100. Reception cards are $148, and reply cards and
envelopes add $260 more. Clason says most people order informal
note paper for thank-you notes. But she recommends regular
stationery with the new name or monogram, since it will have many
more uses.

   A wedding you plan yourself is unique, but that quality of
originality is what makes it typical, says Barbara Tober, editor of
Bride's Magazine.
   So the wedding of Justin Edwards and Annie Chervin was unique to
them, of course, but typical.
   ``The desire to make a wedding personal in all its aspects is
paramount today. All the elements - from ethnic customs to what
they wear and what they eat and how they travel to the ceremony -
are being considered and personal choices are being made,'' says
Tober.
   ``No less important is having the people they regard as family
present at the wedding. Today, a couple wants to make a connection
with family in whatever way they can. Not everyone has a big
family. Or they may have given up on their relatives but want to
include those who are meaningful.''
   Today's weddings are traditional in that people send
invitations, make vows, have a meal, cut a cake, have toasts and go
on a honeymoon. What is different now is that there are so many
choices in every one of these activities. Many couples have an
essentially traditional service, but they may add to or modify it,
observes Tober.
   ``The wedding dress can have a handkerchief hem, be ballet
length or have a cathedral train and four types of beads. Or be a
simple dress or a lace suit. There's every neckline, every kind of
fabric.''
   Flowers? ``From grape hyacinths and miniature tussy mussies to
roses and gardenias.''
   Cakes can be the traditional tiered white cake or have a
different flavor in every layer. Some people choose custom-made
replicas of themselves. The honeymoon can be a long weekend in the
Poconos or a trip to India or Africa, says Tober.
   Or it can be an adventure in the waters off the coast of Turkey
on a small sailboat with your new in-laws, as was Annie and
Justin's delayed summer honeymoon trip.

   Wedding etiquette, once practically carved in stone, is now
written on the wind.
   Just for starters, the bridal couple may have been living
together before the wedding. The groom may have selected a woman as
his honor attendant while the ``maid'' of honor is a man. The bride
may walk down the aisle on the arms of both her father and her
stepfather, or with her mother. The wedding service may be
conducted by two members of the clergy, each of a different
denomination.
   ``The nicest thing that has happened is that weddings have
become more individual,'' says Elizabeth Post, granddaughter of
Emily Post, who kept earlier generations' manners in order. ``We
have many more choices today. People check in etiquette books to
see what is considered proper and then modify it to suit
themselves,'' says Post, who recently revised ``Emily Post's
Complete Book of Wedding Etiquette.''
   Still, she discerns a growing interest in observing the forms,
after an era in which many people wanted to eliminate them in the
interest of spontaneity and freedom.
   ``Compared to the 1970s and the 1960s, people want more
structure, but without returning to the formality that
characterized the Victorian age,'' says Post.
   Or as Annie Chervin Edwards, who was married in South Salem,
N.Y. last spring, puts it: ``I didn't want my wedding to be stuffy,
but I didn't want anything to be in bad taste, either.''
   Although she didn't plan on observing traditions such as having
a receiving line, she says that one materialized naturally after
the ceremony as guests came up to congratulate the couple and their
parents.
   ``Etiquette today is changing to accommodate feelings, which is
only right, since it evolved as ritualized courtesy which is a form
of kindness,'' says Barbara Tober, editor of Bride's Magazine.
   Some practices now considered appropriate - once either frowned
on or not considered - include sharing expenses between both sets
of parents, closing the bar early or even doing without alcoholic
beverages altogether, inviting live-in mates as well as spouses of
friends, and addressing invitations to a husband and wife who don't
share the same last name, Bride's reports.
   If receiving lines and other rituals are no longer a matter of
concern, what questions of etiquette most concern those planning
weddings today?
   The toughest questions are those having to do with the roles of
stepparents and divorced parents in the wedding, followed closely
by those about second weddings, says Post.
   A common question: Who gives the bride away? ``Tradition says
it's her own father's prerogative, but this can lead to hurt
feelings if she has been living with her mother and stepfather for
many years. Many brides are writing to ask if their mother can give
them away. I say yes - even though there may be some raised
eyebrows - if that is what the bride would like. A mother's place
traditionally is in the front row, but if a stepmother has been
more important in the bride's or groom's life, she is the one who
should be given this seat of honor,'' says Post.
   Issues having to do with money frequently are raised. ``I don't
think that guests should be asked to give a certain sum or to
contribute to the wedding reception. Wedding gifts should not be
related to the elaborateness of the reception but to what the donor
wishes to give and can afford.''
   Another issue that's more common these days is how to handle a
ceremony between people of different religions. When a joint
ceremony incorporating each faith is impossible, there can be two
services on the same day. ``Usually one of them is just for the
immediate family,'' Post concludes.

   A wedding cake in traditional white, but with a difference -
chocolate - is a current favorite of bridal couples who have their
receptions at New York's Plaza Hotel.
   Bernard Chenivesse, executive pastry chef for the hotel, offers
this recipe, using white chocolate and white chocolate cream
liqueur in the cake, cream filling and frosting to make a moist,
rich wedding cake he describes as ``decadently delicious.'' It is
completely edible, including the decorations.
   
   WHITE SATIN WEDDING CAKE
   
   Sponge cake:
   
   12 eggs
   12 ounces flour
   12 ounces sugar
   6 ounces butter
   
   Mix eggs and sugar over a bain marie for 10 minutes. Remove and
continue to beat until cool. Add warm butter and flour and mix
gently. Pour into 2 or 3 10-inch molded pans and bake at 300
degrees for about 25 minutes.
   
   Syrup:
   
   2 cups water
   1 cup sugar
   1 cup white chocolate liqueur
   
   Boil water and sugar. Let cool, then add the liqueur.
   
   White Satin Cream Filling:
   
   10.5 ounces heavy cream (35 percent fat)
   2.5 ounces glucose (corn syrup)
   23 ounces white chocolate
   1.5 ounces white chocolate liqueur
   
   Using a heavy knife, cut the chocolate into fairly small cubes.
Combine the cream and corn syrup in a saucepan and bring to a boil.
Pour cream over the chocolate and stir to dissolve the pieces.
Refrigerate until chilled, then beat with a wire whisk. Refrigerate
again; the chocolate cream will continue to harden as it stands.
   
   Butter Cream:
   
   1 cup egg whites
   2 pounds confectioners' sugar
   2 pounds sweet butter, at room temperature
   1 teaspoon vanilla
   
   Put the egg whites and vanilla into a bowl, then add the
confectioners sugar. Using a large wire whisk, start to beat the
mixture over a bain marie using very low heat - not to exceed 90
degrees. Then move the bowl to an electric mixer and beat at high
speed until cool, snow-white and thick, adding the butter bit by
bit. (The mixture will look as if is about to separate.) Continue
beating and shape the butter cream.
   Cut the sponge cake into 2 or 3 layers and soak in the syrup to
absorb the liquid. Spread the cream filling between the layers, and
frost and decorate with the butter cream. Use a pastry bag with
various tips to shape decorations.

celebrations, including one for a drink called ``The White Satin,''

   Nice ice, as someone inevitably will say as you show off your
new engagement ring. But getting the nicest within your budget may
require a hard-headed break in your romantic reveries as you
approach what probably is your first major investment as a couple.
   ``This major purchase doesn't have to be overwhelming, and it
won't be if you know how to go about it,'' says Antoinette Matlins,
a gem expert and industry editor. She and Antonio Bonnano, a
leading gemologist and appraiser, are co-authors of ``Engagement
and Wedding Rings: The Definitive Buying Guide for People in Love''
(Gemstone Press, South Woodstock, Vt.).
   The choices can be intimidating. There are countless colored
gemstones, diamonds, and settings in various grades, styles and
sizes, all affecting the price, she notes.
   The traditional diamond apparently remains the favorite. The
American Diamond Industry Association estimates that 76 percent of
all brides in 1989 received diamond engagement rings. ``What is
especially meaningful is that, despite the nation's economic
concerns, the number of diamond engagement rings sold has
increased,'' says Lloyd Jaffe, chairman of the industry group. He
cites an 8 percent increase for that period, with an average
selling price of $1,357, and 42 percent of purchases costing less
than $1,000.
   Weight, cut, color, and clarity are the main points to consider
in judging diamond quality, say most gem specialists, but your own
taste and budget are legitimate considerations, too.
   Can you tell the difference between a 90-point and full 1-carat
stone? Most people can't when the stones are set, Ms. Matlins says.
But this small differencein weight (there are 100 points to the
carat) can make a big difference in cost, since the price goes up
significantly when a stone weighs a carat or more.
   She adds that if size is important to you, consider a
pear-shaped or marquise-shaped diamond. The round, brilliant-cut
diamond is considered to be the one that maximizes the stone's
beauty, but this cut also tends to look smaller than those in other
shapes.
   More important than size is the cut, says Marcee Feinberg of
Lazare Kaplan International, a diamond jewelry firm. ``You may
choose to economize on color, clarity or size, but to ensure you
have the most brilliant diamond possible, you should never
compromise on cut.''
   The cut shapes the stone into facets, or angled planes, to
maximize fire (color) and brilliance (light).
   The most expensive stones are very white. If these are beyond
your budget, you'll find that less white stones will look whiter
when set in white gold or platinum, advises Ms. Matlins. Most
diamonds have a slight coloring.
   Flawless diamonds are rare, but the stone doesn't have to be
perfect to have high value and beauty, she says. A slightly
imperfect stone with fine color and brilliance may be more
satisfying than a perfect stone with less sparkle and color.
   Designs other than the solitaire may be equally or more
beautiful but often cost less, she adds. Some suggestions:
   - Consider using several smaller diamonds instead of one large
one. A 1-carat round brilliant cut diamond in a solitaire setting
might cost about $5,000, while a ring with three stones with the
same total weight may cost $2,500 and one with seven diamonds with
the same total weight $1,500.
   - Bold designs in gold or platinum using wide, innovative
designs can add importance to smaller diamonds.
   - Use small diamonds to accent a ring with a birthstone. The
birthstone adds even more personal symbolism, and it makes a more
affordable ring.
   Ms. Matlins' book covers other factors in making your selection.
She explains why cut and proportion are the most important factors
in the stone's beauty and tells how to spot a faulty cutting. She
tells how to read a diamond grading report, how to steer clear of
``bargains'' that may be fraudulent, and how to personalize and
protect an inherited heirloom ring.
   She also includes a history of engagement rings.

   With the revival of full-scale formal weddings comes the return
of another romantic extravagance: the trousseau.
   ``Our trousseau business is phenomenal,'' says Nicole Muller,
who with her mother, Gloria, runs Lingerie de Nicolle, an upscale
boutique on New York's Madison Avenue. ``Not a day goes by that
someone doesn't ask about a trousseau.''
   Business is so brisk that they have started a bridal registry
service, so that close friends and relatives can select preferred
items for the bride, in her right size. ``Our bridal registry is
the response to increased demand for bridal lingerie and also to
the need for the bride and her entire wedding party to juggle this
consideration with the dozens of other details involved in wedding
planning,'' says Gloria Muller.
   ``Trousseau'' is derived from the French word for ``bundle'' and
usually refers to the bride's clothes and linens, often collected
in a hope chest.
   To the Mullers this means lacy silk and satin bras, panties,
garters, gowns, robes and slippers, traditionally in white or
ivory, but also in pastels and occasionally black. Accessories
include the good-luck garter, satin slippers to be worn for comfort
at the reception as well as with sleepwear, padded satin lingerie
hangers and a lacy laundry bag for the delicate lingerie.
   Others may prefer easy-care versions made of Patina or Captiva,
two nylon luxury fabrics by Allied. Designer Fernando Sanchez uses
these in brilliant hues for lingerie and at-home wear, while
lingerie makers such as Lily of France, Lorraine, Gilligan &amp;
O'Malley, Val Mode, Cine Star, Chic and others interpret
traditionally glamorous designs in these fabrics.
   For an elegant touch, trim pillows in fabrics and embroidery to
match the robes in your trousseau, suggests Holly Lueders, a
lingerie designer. She recommends packing several robes among the
sheets, slips and sachet - one that's elegantly embroidered,
another that's sheer, and one for real comfort. Dress designer and
antiques dealer Ann Lawrence advises the bride to devise her own
version of a hope chest - perhaps an old cedar chest or steamer
trunk - to collect lingerie and linens. There's something about old
things, she says, that gives a comfortable feeling of enduring
tradition. --
   Most of those frilly at-home clothes - robes, nightgowns,
lace-trimmed or embroidered teddies, camisoles, slips, bras,
panties and hosiery - can go right into the automatic washer,
advises Maytag.
   Just make sure you launder smaller loads than usual, separately,
using the delicate cycle and at least a medium water level. Wash
nylon separately to avoid picking up color from other fabric, and
if the fabric is a blend, wash it as though it were 100 percent of
the dominant fiber. Use either warm water with a regular detergent
or cold water with a liquid or pre-dissolved detergent to
discourage fading of brilliant colors. Only oxygen bleaches should
be used to treat silk, wood, spandex, non-colorfast and some
flame-retardant materials. Put hosiery in a pillowcase or mesh bag
to prevent snags, and also use a separate bag for garters, bras and
other garments with hardware that might catch on other items. Add
fabric softener during the final rinse. Tumble dry on the low or
warm setting and remove promptly.
   Silk - actually a very strong fiber - also can be machine
laundered even if its care label is marked ``hand wash.'' Use a
gentle cycle and slow agitation speed and a two-minute wash cycle.
Hang silks on plastic hangers, and if the item requires pressing,
do so while the fabric is still damp.
   And if you spill champagne, caviar, or chocolate on your
honeymoon clothes, refer to Maytag's Stain Removal Guide, which
costs 50 cents in coin from the Maytag Company, Consumer
Information Center, Dept. 19YG-CP, Newton, Iowa 50208.

   Melting pot or smorgasbord, the United States is a place where
ethnic and religious diversity abound. The volatile mixture can be
champagne or a witches brew for a couple with different backgrounds
who fall in love and want to marry.
   The number of mixed marriages has grown steadily since 1910,
says Tom W. Smith, director of the General Social Survey at the
National Opinion Research Center, a non-profit social science
research center at the University of Chicago.
   Among married people born between 1960 and 1970, 33.5 percent
were raised in a different religion from their spouse. That's
almost double the 18 percent born before 1910 whose birth religion
differed from their spouse's.
   The numbers show an orderly progression, with greater
intermarriage in each decade, and there's a similar pattern in
marriages between spouses of different ethnic makeup. However, the
incidence of black-white intermarriage is extremely small.
   As mixed marriages have grown more common, Americans have become
more accepting of them. When asked by the Gallup Poll whether they
approved of marriage between Catholics and Protestants, 79 percent
said yes in 1983 (the latest figures available), compared to 63
percent in 1968.
   The approval rates for marriage between Jews and non-Jews show a
similar growth. In 1983, 77 percent of the Gallup Poll respondents
said yes, compared to 59 percent in 1968.
   Another indication of growing tolerance, says Smith, is that
laws forbidding interracial marriage today are found nowhere in the
country. As late as the 1960s, about 20 states had them on their
books.
   It's easier than it used to be for couples of mixed religion to
have a religious ceremony, according to Smith.
   ``Within the Catholic Church, only the Catholic spouse has to
promise to raise the children as Catholics. Formerly, both
individuals had to make this promise in order to be married in the
church,'' he says. The change occurred in the 1960s.
   Although official Jewish rabbinical groups still have a policy
against officiating at interfaith marriages and Conservative and
Orthodox rabbis do not perform such ceremonies, Reform rabbis are
free to follow their own philosophy, says Dru Greenwood, associate
director of the Commission on Jewish Outreach in New York.
   ``It's our policy to reach out to interfaith couples and to
welcome them without requiring conversion, while still encouraging
them to choose Judaism for their children,'' adds Greenwood. About
40 percent of current Jewish weddings are with a non-Jewish
partner.
   ``If you are looking for a rabbi to co-officiate with a
Christian, that remains fairly difficult,'' she says. However, some
Reform rabbis will do this. Others will help a couple write a
ceremony, will counsel them and will attend the wedding, even if
they won't officiate.
   ``In interfaith marriages, we usually need twice as many
premarital sessions,'' says Canon Joel Gibson at the Cathedral of
St. John the Divine in New York. The concerns which invariably come
up include personal religious beliefs, relations with the families,
how children will be raised and how holidays will be celebrated.
   ``Interfaith marriages can work so long as the couple talk about
the issues,'' says Jay T. Rock, director of Christian-Jewish
Relations at the National Council of Churches of Christ in New
York.
   ``Sometimes in the flush of a new relationship, couples enter an
interfaith marriage with the idea that it doesn't mean anything.
They find out when kids come along, at holiday times or when there
is a funeral that the difference in background does play a part.
Counseling on a group or individual basis is very helpful.''
   Rock says counseling can help couples learn how to deal with
their families who may have well-known or unsuspected prejudices
that come to the fore when a marriage with someone from another
tradition looms.
   ``The workshops I know about try to talk about the various
options, but I think there is often an underlying message that
conversion rather than living with differences is best for children
and the couple. But there is no way to erase your past. Even if you
convert, your children will be curious about this part of their
tradition.''
   Though still limited, the resources for interfaith couples have
grown. To find out about counseling programs and clergy who conduct
interfaith marriages, Rock suggests calling a local ecumenical
group like the National Conference of Christians and Jews. However,
most couples find out about the resources by word of mouth.
   A discussion program called ``Times and Seasons: A Liberal
Jewish Perspective on Intermarriage'' is available in many parts of
the country, according to Greenwood. For further information,
contact the Union of American Hebrew Congregations at 838 Fifth
Ave., New York, N.Y., 10021, or check with a local reform
synagogue.
   One of the first problems that interfaith couples have is
introducing each other to their parents, says Barbara Tober, editor
of Bride's Magazine.
   ``Sometimes the parents won't come to the wedding. In the main,
the stories we hear are of a traumatic first meeting, which most of
the time gets resolved. And very often they say, `Now they love him
or her.'''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   If you think a pre-nuptial agreement is unromantic, think how
unromantic a nasty battle in divorce court would be later.
   ``Pre-nups give couples an opportunity to review their assets
and be honest with one another,'' says Richard Plotka, a
matrimonial lawyer in New York City. ``That's a good way to start a
partnership.''
   It's better to deal with touchy issues when you're in love, he
says. And since the contracts usually start with a complete
disclosure of assets and debts, it could save you from some
uncomfortable surprises.
   ``I've seen many prospective spouses rudely discover their
partners are saddled with budget-crunching debt or hiding sizable
wealth,'' says Plotka.
   Pre-nuptial agreements in the United States are more common
among second or later marriages or couples marrying later in life,
he points out. That's simply because at this stage couples are
likely to be bringing more tangible assets to the marriage, like a
co-op or house, a car, a business, or a professional degree.
   But young people marrying for the first time can protect their
assets with an agreement, he says. This is especially true of young
women, who may have slowed or hindered their careers by taking time
off to have children. Even if she hasn't had a child and the
marriage ends early, a young woman usually fares better with a
pre-nuptial agreement.
   These agreements, if properly done, will hold up in court,
Plotka says. They can spell out property distribution, terms of
support and even what religion the children should be taught. They
can protect the things you've worked hard for, and they can make a
fair distribution of assets developed during the marriage.
   Assets that usually appreciate in value include stocks, a family
business, and real estate. These issues can be covered in an
agreement, Plotka says, since some state laws allow for
appreciation of separate property to become jointly owned in some
circumstances.
   Another factor to consider is the application in most states of
the recent Equitable Distribution Laws, which give courts
discretion about division of assets acquired during a marriage.
Before these laws were in effect, homes, bank accounts and
businesses usually were held in the husband's name; it was assumed
that the woman would be compensated with alimony. Now the courts
can decide what's fair and are no longer compelled to leave
ownership to the title holder.
   Plotka acknowledges that making up an agreement may take away
from the optimism and excitement of a wedding, so he advises
couples to work out an agreement well before the wedding day. Each
partner should have his or her own lawyer.
   ``My advice is to work out an agreement based upon what's fair,
sign it and put it away. Do this well in advance of the wedding so
that there is plenty of time for tension to dissipate. Then go out,
have a wonderful wedding , and have a long and happy future
together. Perhaps the agreement will never need to be used.''

   Tempers may flare and patience wear thin on that
special occasion, your wedding day.
   ``Weddings are almost like a crisis situation,'' says Donna J.
Rankin, associate professor of community and mental health nursing
at Loyola University in Chicago.
   ``You've never done this before and multiple decisions, large
and small, must be made in a relatively short period of time. There
are almost certainly going to be conflicts.''
   Just about anything can create conflict on the wedding day, she
says, from the color of the wedding dress to the type of band or
music being played.
   But it's all survivable.
   ``The key to a successful and happy wedding is to resolve
conflicts as they occur,'' says Rankin. ``Be honest about your
feelings, but don't be afraid to compromise.''
   Solving conflicts on the wedding day may not be easy, but the
important part is to start with an open mind, not a confrontational
stance, she says.
   ``Look for the win-win situation, something that satisfies both
parties. A bride and groom that I knew came from distinctly
different religions. Their solution was two ceremonies, one from
each faith. Both families were pleased.''
   It's a day of great expectations, she says, for bride, groom,
family and friends.
   ``While everybody wants their dream wedding, remember,
perfection isn't always possible.
   ``Strive to reduce stress levels by using conflict resolution
techniques. A wedding is only the first day of a marriage; you'll
have the rest of your lives together.''

   You can strengthen your marriage by not
expecting to agree with your partner on everything and by learning
to manage those differences constructively, says a family
counseling specialist.
   Happy couples are those who have learned to communicate,
negotiate and compromise more skillfully, says Clifford Notarious,
co-director of the Catholic University of America's marriage and
family studies group.
   He adds that it's how the couple deals with differences rather
than the differences themselves that affects the stability of their
marriage.
   He offers these guidelines to help couples communicate
successfully:
   - Speak only for yourself, not for your partner.
   - Communicate, or argue, as if it were a game with rules, not a
free-for-all.
   - Separate the discussion of the problem from the solution;
don't rush to a solution.
   - Choose one topic to talk about and stick to it. Don't stack
problems.
   - Be polite. Maintain self-control.
   - Don't blame the conflict on your partner. Consider causes that
he or she may have little control over.
   - If your partner makes a negative comment, don't respond
negatively.
   - Set a time for talking about problems.
   - Set relationship rules. Don't hash things out in front of the
children, or at the end of a hard day when either partner may be
tired or edgy.
   - Show your partner you care about what he or she has to say.
Don't just say, ``I understand,'' but demonstrate it by facial
expressions and body language.

   Single men looking for a raise or promotion should consider a
serious option: Get married.
   Married men earn an average of 30.6 percent more than unmarried
men, according to a University of Michigan survey.
   Husbands outearn bachelors in several other countries as well,
said Robert Schoeni, a doctoral student at the school's Population
Studies Center in Ann Arbor, Mich.
   ``The average earnings of married men were consistently higher
than the earnings of their unmarried counterparts in all the
countries we studied. The effect persisted even when education, age
or experience, and race were taken into account,'' Schoeni said.
   He thinks possible reasons are that employers perceive married
men as more stable and community-oriented, that women tend to marry
financially successful men, and that men feel more responsible, and
therefore are more productive.
   Schoeni studied incomes in 12 countries, using data for 25- to
64-year-old males collected since 1983 by the Center for
Population, Poverty and Policy Studies in Walferdange, Luxembourg.
He said he found marriage had a particularly powerful effect on
men's earnings in the United States, Norway, Sweden and
Switzerland. --
   Long-distance calls and travel fares often need to be figured
into wedding expenses, according to Modern Bride, whose
December-January issue looks at the phenomenon of what it calls
``long-distance weddings.'' The mobility of people today makes it
unlikely that you'll meet, marry and settle down in your old home
town, the magazine says. The publication advises you plan far in
advance so relatives and friends in distant cities will have a
better chance to come, provide travel information, arrange blocks
of hotel rooms at discounted rates, and try to keep costs to a
minimum for participants and guests.

   Is the only thing standing between you and a beautiful wedding
the fact that you haven't found the suitable groom?
   The odds aren't as great as you may think, even if you're an
older woman, says Barbara Lovenheim, author of ``Beating the
Marriage Odds: When You are Smart, Single and Over 35'' (William
Morrow).
   Lovenheim reviews the statistics from a variety of sources,
including the Bennett-Bloom report of several years ago, which
concluded that women over 40 had only a 1.3 percent chance of
marrying, and the National Center for Health Statistics figures,
which show that a 40-year-old woman has a 24 percent chance.
   ``For one thing, (the statistics) show that a woman's marital
probabilities really do decline as she ages. That is a fact,''
Lovenheim writes. ``The bright side of these statistics is that a
large number of women can - and do - marry at every age. A
f40-year-old single woman can find a husband and so can a 52-old
single woman. A 38-year-old divorced woman may find a new spouse,
and a 49-year-old divorced woman is not at all out of the
running.'' --
   ``The Perfect Wedding Planner'' (Delacorte Press) is a
record-keeper, planner and reference guide in one looseleaf binder.
   Authors Barbara Binswanger and Jim Charlton have laid out a
calendar and checklist for all those details you need to think
about for your wedding, including the ceremony, reception,
printing, clothing, parties, guests and accommodation, gifts, the
licence, the honeymoon and newspaper publicity. Along with these,
they've added practical advice on all these subjects.

   Suppose you've miscalculated your guest list, and you've run out
of invitations. Not to worry. Just pop downtown to the local
department store (Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Jordan Marsh, Harrods,
Selfridges, et al) and have some extras printed while you wait,
through the Social Secretary.
   The Social Secretary is a practical application of desktop
publishing, and the company has installations at stores to help you
cope with invitations, guest lists, place cards, note cards, menus
and other things that look best with a print job.
   Choose from a variety of typefaces or calligraphy, borders, and
stock, and then proofread the text before printing, all while
you're in the store. Orders as small as 10 cards (around $8) are
accepted.
   ``Some social secretaries also have bought The Social
Secretary,'' says John L. Poppen, a founder of the firm, which also
markets the computer systems that do the printing. ``After they
address the invitations, they give the bride a complete booklet
with guest list.''
   For locations, call (201) 825-1222. --
   What do men want?
   Real men often value kitchen appliances as wedding gifts,
according to a survey commissioned by Robert Krups North America,
the small appliances maker.
   ``The traditional view that only brides are interested in gifts
for the home, and particularly the kitchen, no longer reflects the
lifestyles of couples marrying today,'' says Michael Kramm, general
manager of the firm. ``Now, even bridal showers are open to the
bridegroom and his friends.''
   A man's most desired gift is a microwave oven, according to
those polled, followed by a food processor, knife set, blender,
coffee maker, wok, toaster, ice cream maker, espresso-capuccino
machine, and coffee grinder, in that order.
   But don't give him a fondue pot, electric bread maker, waffle
iron, electric knife, popcorn popper, electric can opener, electric
frying pan, pressure cooker, mixer, or crock pot. These were the
least desired and most often returned gifts. --
   You can show your true love what a caring person you are if you
send an unusual floral arrangement and make a public-spirited
gesture at the same time.
   An orchid bouquet of yellow, white and purple dendrobians or one
of yellow oncidiums, either costing $45, is recommended by Petal
Power, a New York telephone floral service that sends 10 percent of
any bouquet's price to the charity of your choice. The contribution
will be sent to the charity with a card in your name.
   If you don't have a charity in mind, the firm can recommend one
from a list it keeps covering a variety of concerns. It also
provides accounting of contributions for individual orders and
corporate accounts. The charitable contribution also applies to
flower orders sent anywhere in the United States.
   To order, call (212) 289-7650. --
   Couples who want live entertainment at their receptions but
don't have the budget to cover an orchestra can turn to a hybrid:
the disk jockey.
   A disk jockey who knows appropriate ethnic traditions and can
lead guests in singalongs, giveaways and dance contests between
recorded numbers can cost as little as $350 from Party Hosts, an
Old Bridge, N.J., firm. Hosts are entertainers with dance, voice,
music history and microphone and equipment training.
   John Murphy, who heads the firm, says the most frequently
requested ``first song'' in the 3,000 wedding parties hosted by the
firm in l990 was ``Endless Love,'' with Diana Ross and Lionel
Ritchie.
   For information call 1 (800) STAR-DJS. --
   Marriage isn't a game, but ``Love &amp; Marriage'' is.
   It's from Modern Bride Magazine and developed by L&amp;M Games to
test your wits - and prejudices - about the institution of
matrimony. ``If you are in love, or were ever in love, then you
have all the experience you need to play. And that goes for
marrieds and singles,'' says Howard Friedberg, the magazine's
publisher. The game will be on the market this spring. --

   It was the year when the arts moved from the entertainment pages
to the front pages, where issues of censorship and artistic freedom
were debated in communities across the country.
   In Cincinnati, a museum curator was acquitted of obscenity
charges for displaying the late Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs.
In Florida, the rap group 2 Live Crew also was exonerated after
being arrested for performing their obscenity-laden songs.
   But other targets got no relief: Novelist Salman Rushdie
remained in hiding in Britain, eluding the ``death sentence''
ordered by Iran's censorious Islamic fundamentalists.
   In 1990, a century after his death, Vincent van Gogh was the
world's most popular artist. His ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' sold at
auction for a record $82.5 million.
   The priceless Van Goghs were genuine, but some fakes - Milli
Vanilli - made just as much news.
   It also was the year in which a platoon of rockers, including
Cyndi Lauper, Sinead O'Connor and Joni Mitchell, showed up at the
Berlin Wall to perform, before 200,000 people, songs from Pink
Floyd's 1979 rock epic ``The Wall.''
   And it was year Bart Simpson came to life on millions of
American TV screens.
   Here are the best and worst of 1990, as judged by the
entertainment and arts writers of The Associated Press:

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. announced
Sunday it would try to oust the directors of NCR Corp. as AT&amp;T
tries to complete a $6.1 billion hostile takeover bid for the
computer maker.
   The move to unseat the directors was widely expected after NCR
rejected the phone company's $90-per-share cash offer and ammended
a lawsuit alleging that AT&amp;T's Securities and Exchange Commission
filings for its tender offer violate federal securities law.
   Dayton, Ohio-based NCR, the nation's fifth-largest computer
maker, has in place a strong anti-takeover plan that could be
removed if AT&amp;T gains control of the board.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Wholesale prices rose 0.5 percent in November,
the government said. Analysts called it a disturbingly high

   DETROIT (AP) - California billionaire Kirk Kerkorian has bought
9.8 percent of the stock of Chrysler Corp. for about $272 million.
That makes him the company's largest shareholder and prompts the
struggling automaker to beef up its takeover defenses.
   A statement issued through a Los Angeles public relations agency
said the purchase was made as an investment. Chrysler spokesman
Arthur Liebler confirmed that a discussion took place last week
between Kerkorian, of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Chrysler Chairman
Lee Iacocca.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Most of the nation's largest banks are
teetering on the brink of insolvency and tax money must quickly be
injected into the government fund insuring deposits, warns a
congressional report due out Monday.
   Bank failure costs could total $63 billion in a severe
recession, it said. Even the mild downturn expected by most
economists would leave the fund short of cash, said the report,
which was written by three economists at the request of a
congressional subcommittee.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Tribune Co. said its operating profit will slide

to take effect.

government and investors in Keating's Phoenix-based American

liable for as much as $110 million.
   The policies ``impose an obligation on the respective insurance
company defendants to provide insurance coverage for the acts of
the insured defendants that caused damage and losses to the
plaintiffs,'' the lawsuit says.

   Newspaper prices appear to be going up, as
publishers pummeled by declining growth in advertising look to
their readers for money to shore up profits.
   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. provided the most prominent example of what
appears to be a trend toward higher prices by boosting the cover
price of its flagship newspaper, The Wall Street Journal, by 50
percent to 75 cents this month.
   But judging from presentations made to the annual PaineWebber
media outlook conference this past week, others may not be far
behind.
   Affiliated Publications Inc., for instance, plans to boost the
price of the daily issues of The Boston Globe sold more than 30
miles outside the city to 50 cents from 35 cents this spring.
   Chairman William Taylor said prices on issues sold closer to the
city may be increased if conditions warrant.
   The Washington Post is boosting the price for delivery of the
Sunday edition to $1.50 from $1.25 early next year.
   Several Knight-Ridder Inc. newspapers are planning to boost
cover prices.
   Without identifying the papers by name, President P. Anthony
Ridder said three of the company's 29 newspapers will boost daily
cover prices to 35 cents a copy from 25 cents, while three others
will go to 50 cents from 35 cents.
   This past Friday, The New York Times said it was boosting its
home delivery price by 50 cents to $5 for Monday through Sunday
delivery in the New York metropolitan area and the Northeast
starting Jan. 1. Some other delivery rates also go up.
   Several other media companies told securities analysts they
intended to follow an aggressive circulation pricing policy.
   Publishers generally shy away from boosting prices for readers
because they fear increases will mean fewer people will subscribe
or pick up the paper at newsstands. Their concern is not only that
they will lose out on some circulation revenue, but that
advertisers will cut back because their sales pitches reach a
smaller audience.
   But J. Kendrick Noble Jr., media analyst for PaineWebber, said
many newspapers may find they can still keep a big audience after
raising prices.
   He said his examination of pricing trends suggests that
newspapers that boost prices by no more than 2{ percentage points
more than the inflation rate tend to lose less than 1 percent of
their circulation.
   ``It's not as bad as newspapers might think,'' he said.
   The conditions that are driving many newspapers to consider
circulation price increases include the weakest environment for
advertising since the mid-70s and the prospect of newsprint price
increases next year.
   Robert Coen, the chief forecaster for the advertising agency
McCann-Erickson, said he expects ad spending will rise 4.9 percent
this year, the slowest rate of gain since 1975, and advance by only
4.6 percent in 1991.
   Major newsprint producers, meanwhile, have proposed 5 percent
price increases for early next year.
   Jack Butcher, circulation director at The Tampa (Fla.) Tribune,
said he senses more movement toward higher prices.
   He said he recently surveyed companies who make the coin-slot
plates that are fitted on newspaper vending machines and said they
reported they have the highest level of orders for new plates in
years.
   That is usually a leading indicator of newspaper price changes,
and he said the plates are being readied to accommodate price
hikes.
   Butcher said he expects daily prices will average 35 cents next
year, up from 30 cents this year, and that Sunday prices will rise
to $1 from 75 cents.
   He said he expects readers will be willing to pay mre because
of the improvements that papers have made in recent years, such as
beefing up local coverage, using flashier graphics to illustrate
stories and introducing colors to make the papers look more
appealing.
   ``Those changes help minimize the risk of a price hike,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Developer's Empire Altered as Debt Restructuring Proceeds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The once imposing empire of John C. Portman Jr.
is gradually changing as the architect-developer surrenders control
of various hotels, office towers and other properties in a
wide-ranging debt restructuring.
   The atrium pioneer insists, however, that his operation remains
fundamentally strong and the recent ``give-ups'' are part of
acclimating to changing economic times.
   Portman developed Peachtree Center, a network of fortress-like
skyscrapers and splashy hotels that anchor the northern end of
Atlanta's downtown business district.
   His Atlanta-based Portman Cos. is a private company, and he has
made few public statements since he began negotiations in August
with about 20 creditors to restructure a debt load that reportedly
nears $2 billion. Portman declined to be personally interviewed for
this story, but he responded through a spokesman to a series of
general questions.
   ``Any of these give-ups ... are very minor in comparison to the
overall portfolio,'' Portman said. ``While you are reading about
certain transactions, these are very minor and part of an orderly
process behind the scenes.
   ``There has been an economic downturn and changing (federal
lending) regulations, in real estate specifically. These changes
are the new reality for the next few years.''
   The crux of Portman's talks with the lenders has been a plan to
convert unsecured loans - those not backed by collateral - into a
pool that would be backed by various Portman assets, including some
of his properties.
   Over the last few months, Portman has:
   -Agreed to turn over ownership of much of Peachtree Center
complex to Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States
and Nippon Life Insurance Co., which held a $332.6 million mortgage
on eight buildings. The Portman Cos. continue to manage the
properties under the deal. A wholesale trade mart and hotel that
also are part of the complex were not included in the deal with
Equitable.
   -Given up a $47.5 million tract of land in downtown Atlanta,
near Portman's under-construction One Peachtree Center office
tower, to American Realty Trust.
   -Agreed to increase Equitable's stake in Inforum, an Atlanta
technology mart and trade show facility that originally was a 50-50
partnership between the two companies. Neither side has disclosed
details of the agreement, beyond stating that Portman has a
contract to lease and manage the facility.
   -Turned over to NCNB Corp. the suburban Atlanta Snapfinger Woods
Industrial Park. The North Carolina bank held a $6.2 million
mortgage on the property, which was Portman's only warehouse
project.
   -Sold to Atlanta developer Thomas G. Cousins an 11-acre site in
the city's Brookhaven neighborhood planned for a high-rise
development.
   Earlier this year, Portman sold The Portman San Francisco, a
3-year-old luxury hotel, for an undisclosed price.
   Portman also has had to deal with a humiliating barrage of news
coverage of his financial problems in his hometown, where he
previously enjoyed regular praise for helping shape the city's
skyline and cosmopolitan image. Aside from occasional sniping at
the Atlanta newspapers, though, Portman has remained publicly
philosophical about the downturn.
   ``I have taken a lot of risks in my life,'' he said through the
spokesman. ``With that comes the possibility of rough times as well
as good times.
   ``The worst is behind us. We are very hopeful all the final
documents with the lenders will be signed within six to eight
weeks.''
   Much of Portman's problems stem from actions taken during the
last three years, when he forged ahead with a roster of ambitious
projects, borrowing huge sums of money and refinancing existing
projects to foot the costs.
   He continued this approach even as the economy began to decline.
He also suffered from events out of his control. For example, the
Tianenman Square masacre focused the world's scorn on China as he
raced to complete a major Chinese project.
   The problem-plagued Shanghai Center, a spectacular office and
hotel complex, finally opened in October, one of Portman's few
bright spots this year.
   He continues to predict great things for One Peachtree Center,
projected to be the tallest office building in the South, which is
going up at the rate of one floor every four days.
   Though downtown Atlanta is experiencing a high office vacancy
rate, Portman officials contend there will be sufficient demand for
space by the time One Peachtree Center opens in 1992.
   ``He (Portman) feels more fortunate than others, who don't have
the same quality properties,'' said spokesman Peter Mathon. ``These
are very premium assets. He will survive better than most.''

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Announces Plans to Seek Control of NCR's Board</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. plans to
start a proxy fight to wrest control of NCR Corp.'s board of
directors as it tries to buy the computer maker for $6.1 billion.
   AT&amp;T announced it would try to oust the directors three days
after NCR's board unanimously rejected a $90-per-share cash tender
offer from the phone company.
   The move to unseat the board was widely seen as AT&amp;T's logical
next step after NCR rejected the offer and amended a lawsuit
alleging that AT&amp;T's Securities and Exchange Commission filings for
its tender offer violate federal securities law.
   Walter Murphy, AT&amp;T spokesman, said the company wants NCR
shareholders to elect a new board of directors that would negotiate
with AT&amp;T and remove NCR's anti-takeover provisions.
   AT&amp;T will seek proxies for a special shareholder meeting and for
the regular annual meeting scheduled for April 17. To force NCR to
call a special stockholder meeting, AT&amp;T has to get holders of at
least 25 percent of NCR's stock to request a meeting.
   It would be up to NCR to set a date for a special meeting, said
Dick Gray, another AT&amp;T spokesman.
   AT&amp;T plans to file details of its proxy solicitation with the
SEC Monday morning, Gray said. AT&amp;T extended the expiration date
for its offer by 11 days to January 15.
   Charles E. Exley Jr., chairman of Dayton, Ohio-based NCR, the
nation's fifth-largest computer maker, has said he would be willing
to talk to AT&amp;T about a buyout if the phone company raised its
offer to $125 per share, or about $8.5 billion. AT&amp;T has said the
higher price is outrageous.
   Mark Feighery, NCR spokesman, said Sunday the company would have
no immediate comment on AT&amp;T's move.
   Exley has said it would not make sense to combine NCR's
well-regarded computer line with AT&amp;T's disappointing computer
business. He said he would quit NCR if AT&amp;T suceeded in its
takeover.
   So far, NCR has followed a so-called ``just say no'' defense in
which a target company's board rejects a takeover offer, even if
the shareholders like the bid. To move the deal forward,
shareholders would have to remove the board or AT&amp;T would have to
negotiate a deal with NCR.
   AT&amp;T launched its tender offer on Dec. 5 after NCR's board
turned down an AT&amp;T offer to exchange $90 worth of its stock for
each NCR share.
   NCR stock fell $1.50 a share Friday to close at $88.62{ in New
York Stock Exchange trading. AT&amp;T shares fell 37{ cents to $30.62{.

   With the nation's economy in a big slump, the
government fund that insures bank deposits is ``under stress'' and
needs more money to cope with bank failures, the chairman says.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, said the fund is expected to pay out $4 billion in
1990 to cover bank losses
   A new forecast for 1991 ``looks like another $5 billion loss,''
he said. That would push the FDIC's reserves down to $4 billion, he
said.
   Seidman also said a report being released at a congressional
hearing today is useful because it underscores the problems in the
troubled banking system.
   But he said some of the report's dire conclusions are based on
forecasts that may prove to be wrong.
   ``It shows that, as our numbers show, that we're under stress
and that we need more funds,'' he said on NBC's ``Meet the Press''
on Sunday.
   Seidman was to testify at today's hearing by the House Banking
subcommittee on financial institutions. The panel's report says
bank failures could cost the FDIC $63 billion over three years if
there is a severe recession.
   Even a mild downturn would leave the fund short of cash, said
the report, which was written by three economists. The Associated
Press obtained a copy of the economists' summary last week.
   Seidman said the $63 billion figure was at the high end of the
scale of potential outcomes. ``Our own figures show that even if we
took their highest number ... with the recapitalization we'll have
over $50 billion in hand to meet that. So at worst there would be a
small additional amount needed to be borrowed from the Treasury,''
he said.
   The bankers will recapitalize the FDIC by paying more premiums
into it, Seidman said. ``We think they have plenty of resources to
do that and we expect that they will agree that that's the way it
ought to be done.''
   A banking industry official said in a televised interview today
that banks are committed to making sure the fund remains solvent.
   ``If it needs to be recapitalized, the banks are willing to put
the necessary money into the fund,'' Donald Ogilvie, executive vice
president of the American Bankers Association, said during an
appearance on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   The economists' report suggests the insurance fund be cushioned
with a loan from the Treasury.
   Meantime, Seidman said he agreed with other Bush administration
officials that the economy is in a downturn.
   ``We're in the beginning of what may be a recession,'' he said.
`` We have to wait and see.''
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said the economy is undergoing
a ``significant slowdown'' that is likely to persist through early
1991 before turning around later next year.
   ``I have been a little slow to declare national recession day,''
Brady said.
   Asked why he was reluctant to use the word recession, Brady said
Sunday he did not have all the figures for the quarter.
   ``Let's watch and see,'' Brady said. ``Maybe it will be. I don't
think it's the end of the world even if we have a recession. We'll
pull back out of it again. No big deal.''
   Many private economists, however, have pronounced the economy in
recession, with layoffs rising and banks in trouble, and with the
retail sales, housing and car markets down. A recession is defined
as a contraction of six months or more in the gross national
product.
   ``I think it is quite clear that economic activity in the fourth
quarter of this year has slowed down,'' Brady said on ``Meet the
Press.'' He added, ``I expect that that will continue into the
first quarter of this year.
   ``We expect that during 1991 that it (the economy) will turn
around and we'll be back on the growth path, jobs, investment,
during that year,'' he said.
   Bush administration officials blamed the Persian Gulf crisis for
aggravating the downturn by jacking up oil prices and sapping
consumer confidence.
   ``I am obviously concerned about events in the Persian Gulf,''
said Michael Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of
Economic Advisers.
   ``I think they have heavily influenced the short-term impact on
the economy,'' he said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley.''
   Moreover, Boskin said the government might have to borrow money
to pay for Operation Desert Shield.
   Congressional Democrats say the cost of keeping as many as
400,000 U.S. troops in the gulf could add up to $36.8 billion in
fiscal year 1991. The Bush administration intends to ask Congress
for $20 billion early next year, House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., said Saturday.

   Daihatsu Motor Co. of Japan said Monday it has
reached an agreement to set up a joint venture with Piaggio V.E.
SpA of Italy to produce pickup trucks and vans in Pisa, Italy.
   The venture is to be capitalized at about $27 million. Piaggio
will own 51 percent of the venture while 49 percent will be held by
Daihatsu, according to a Daihatsu official, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Daihatsu is part of Toyota Motor group. Toyota Motor Corp. is
Japan's largest automaker.
   The venture is to build a plant capable of producing 35,000
Daihatsu and Piaggio model trucks and vans a year by December 1992
at an estimated investment of $59 million, the official said.
   He said the vehicles will be marketed in Italy and other
European nations under both the Daihatsu and Piaggio brands.
   Daihatsu exported 55,500 vehicles including 870 mini-trucks in
1989, the official said.

<HEAD>OPEC Output Hits 23.63 Million Barrels Daily, Survey Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil production by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries rose nearly 1 million barrels a day
in November to hit a daily level of 23.63 million barrels and is
expected to increase further, the Middle East Economic Survey
reported Monday.
   Amid continuing war jitters in the Gulf, the respected oil
industry newsletter said the increase was partly due to Saudi
Arabia hiking its daily production by 530,000 barrels to 8.33
million barrels.
   The Saudis are expected to boost output further this month to
around 8.63 million barrels a day, the Nicosia-based newsletter
said.
   The Saudi Oil Ministry has accelerated plans to expand
production capacity to around 10 million barrels a day in the next
few years, a level last seen in the early 1980s.
   The November increase of 970,000 barrels a day put OPEC
production at its highest level since May, when it was 23.68
million barrels a day.
   The survey noted that Iran's production rose in November by
460,000 barrels a day, after dipping in October.
   Iran's current production of 3.46 million barrels a day means
that Iranian production is running at more or less its September
level.
   Some of OPEC's 13 members sharply increased production levels
after Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 and a United Nations trade embargo
halted all exports of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.
   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's leading producer, has more than doubled its
production since August to help make up the shortfall of around 4
million barrels day because of the embargo.
   Oil prices shot up after the Iraqi invasion from around $20 to
$22 a barrel to a peak of about $40 a barrel.
   Prices have since eased to about $27 a barrel, but renewed fears
of war in the Gulf between Iraq and a U.S.-led multinational force
could send prices rising again.
   Industry sources reported earlier this month that Saudi
production alone could drop between 1 and 2 million barrels a day
if war breaks out in the Gulf.
   The oil ministers of the OPEC countries agreed in Vienna at
their biannual conference Dec.12-13 that they will continue to set
aside the organization's production quota system, designed to
stabilize prices, until the crisis ends.
   The last quota agreement in July, shortly before the Iraqi
invasion, established a production ceiling of 22.49 million barrels
a day and a minimum price level of $21 a barrel.
   MEES Editor Ian Seymour noted that the OPEC ministers ``did not
like what they saw'' in reviewing the Gulf crisis and its impact on
the oil market.
   ``The doomsday scenario under which a devastating war would lead
to widespread destruction of Gulf oil facilities is a grim enough
prospect,'' Seymour said.
   ``But another nightmarish possibility for the oil producers is
that a less catastrophic resolution to the crisis - that is to say,
a peaceful settlement or even a short, sharp war without any
significant damage to oil installations - followed by a renewed
flow of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil to the market, could result in a
massive oversupply and consequent collapse in prices to well below
$15 a barrel, in the absence of prompt and effective OPEC action to
reimpose production controls,'' he said.
   ``The fact is that, even without the exports from Iraq or
Kuwait, oil supply from the other eleven OPEC members is now quite
sufficient to meet world needs and could move into surplus by the
second quarter of next year.''
   Despite the agreement in Vienna on an eventual return to the
quota system, Seymour said, ``Many observers are skeptical about
the real readiness of the surplus-capacity producers to return to
quota discipline when the time comes.''
   The Paris-based International Energy Agency said a week ago that
the oil market was ``in a quite manageable balance at present''
following the wild gyrations that followed the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait.
   But its monthly report on the oil market noted, ``There remains
little spare capacity in crude production.''
   ``The market could still face serious problems should there be
industrial accidents, prolonged cold weather, or other distruptions
during the winter,'' it said.
   The report said that together with a significant drop in Soviet
oil production, there were ``a number of sources of potential
concern,'' including serious disruption in Gulf production if war
erupts.
   The U.N. Security Council approved a U.S. resolution Nov. 29
giving Iraq until Jan. 15 to withdraw from Kuwait or risk an
offensive by the multinational force to liberate the conquered
emirate.
   Iraq has so far given no indication it plans to pull out and has
been steadily boosting its military force in Kuwait and southern
Iraq to a current level of around 460,000 troops.
   The multinational force in the Gulf is also being reinforced and
should total around 650,000 personnel by mid-January.

   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
United States has dropped by 28 to 1,151 in the latest week, the
toolmaker Baker Hughes Inc. reported Monday.
   The count one year ago was 1,079 rigs, the company said.
   Baker Hughes has kept the rig count, a widely watched index of
drilling activity, since 1940. The count represents the number of
rigs actively exploring for petroleum, not those producing oil.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   Ike Kerridge, a vice president of Baker Hughes, said he could
find no particular reason for this week's drop, although the number
of working rigs usually rises at year's end.
   ``Some years, it peaks earlier in December, or maybe it will
peak next week - there's just no way of telling,'' Kerridge said.
   Oklahoma lost the largest number of rigs, dropping 11 for the
week, followed by Colorado, which dropped nine; and Texas, which
dropped seven.
   New Mexico led the major oil producing states for the week by
adding nine rigs to the count, followed by North Dakota, up four.

said it expects its long-term debt will be about $1.6 billion at
the end of the year.
   The latest planned sales are in addition to $1.5 billion in sale
proceeds that the company generated under its restructuring program
announced in November 1989.
   In addition, Freeport-McMoRan has purchased about 30.2 million

<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest automaker,
said Monday it will release U.S. sales figures for its imported as
well as North American-made vehicles every 10 days.
   The company, which started the practice last week, becomes the
first Japanese automaker to report total sales every 10 days, a
tradition held for decades by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co.
and Chrysler Corp.
   However, beginning with the first reporting period of January,
Chrysler will halt 10-day sales reports, which it calls useless.
   Chrysler objects to reporting sales figures every 10 days
because a wide variety of factors, including weather or big
incentive programs, can give a false representation of how a
company's sales compare with a year ago.
   Chrysler also said it costs too much to produce the reports.
   GM and Ford have said they will continue to report U.S. sales of
their vehicles every 10 days.

   The Mead Corp. said Monday its board has

company.
   Capital expenditures will be reduced to $350 million from a

business, certain non-productive assets will be written off and
corporate cost-reduction steps that include an early-retirement
program and a salary freeze for higher paid employees will be
implemented, the company said.
   Mead officials estimate that the steps will yield 1991 savings
of about $33 million, or 50 cents per share.
   ``Given the uncertain state of the economy, we believe it is
prudent to initiate these steps now, rather than allow economic
conditions to jeopardize our long-term strategies,'' said Burnell

<HEAD>Trucking Firm Plans to Cease Operations, Liquidate Assets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   P-I-E International announced Monday
it will handle freight through the end of the month before a
bankruptcy trustee begins selling off the assets of the failed
trucking line.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge George Proctor approved the company's
plans Saturday to shut down operations and liquidate to pay off the
company's debts.
   ``We appreciate the support of the thousands of employees and
customers who made herculean efforts to keep the company going,''
Gerry McIntyre, P-I-E president, said in a news release Monday.
   ``However, the current economy, fuel prices, and adverse
publicity associated with our Chapter 11 filing prevented us from
continuing operations,'' he said.
   P-I-E has been struggling since it and parent Olympia Holding
Corp. of Miami filed for protection from creditors while it
reorganized under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws two
months ago. It listed debts of $237 million and assets of $169
million.
   Prior to the filing, P-I-E operated 230 terminals and employed
3,500 workers, 800 of them in the company's Jacksonville base.
   A Chapter 11 trustee will be appointed by Saturday and will
begin working Dec. 29 to begin an orderly liquidation, the company
said.
   ``There was no light at the end of the tunnel,'' said P-I-E
attorney Steve Busey. ``The company determined there was no real
prospect of a successful reorganization.''
   After two months of downsizing - with the elimination of 1,500
jobs and 69 terminals Friday - P-I-E now employs about 2,000 people
and operates about 100 terminals.
   Under the court-approved liquidation plan, the company will
continue operations while it delivers the remaining freight in its
warehouses.
   Proctor gave the company permission to use about $8 million from
cash receipts to pay for wages and operating costs to cover
deliveries.
   P-I-E employees still on the job will receive their regular pay
and benefits if there is enough money taken in from customers to
handle those amounts.
   The second-phase of the shutdown starts Dec. 29 when the trustee
takes over to sell off trucks, office equipment and other company
assets.
   The liquidation plan comes after weeks of pressure from anxious
creditors.
   P-I-E's biggest creditor, Fidelcor Business Credit Corp., asked
last month to have the case converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation
because of the truck line's continuing losses. P-I-E owes Fidelcor
$39 million.
   A succession of five owners in five years left the 61-year-old
P-I-E saddled with debt and few assets. Last year, P-I-E lost $24
million on revenues of $512 million.

<HEAD>Health-Care Costs and Recession: A Dangerous Mixture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the somber realities of economic life,
recession and high health-care costs, are coming together at just
the wrong time for many businesses and employees.
   Consulting firms are recommending that companies scrutinize
their plans for savings, but the historical evidence shows that
insecurity and other stresses of economic downturns produce greater
demands on the plans.
   ``For a variety of reasons, health-care utilization and lean
times go hand in hand,'' says Anna Rappaport, an officer of William
M. Mercer Inc., a leading employee benefits and human resources
consulting firm.
   Even layoffs, inevitable in a recession, can have an impact on
the cost of health coverage, since the Consolidated Ominibus Budget
Act of 1985 requires employees to offer continued coverage to
terminated workers.
   Health-care managers believe some of those former employees may
use their time to attend to nagging ailments or to undergo surgery
they had postponed, or that financial stress could produce costly
physical and mental problems.
   While the Omnibus Act (popularly and perhaps aptly known as
COBRA in some circles) allows employers to charge terminated
employees the full cost of continued coverage, the companies still
could end up with higher costs.
   Ms. Rappaport explains that employees who continue coverage
often are those most in need. Typically, she says, that need might
involve someone in the family with a mental or physical ailment,
with the result that their coverage costs more than the company is
allowed to charge the former worker.
   Still another recession-induced problem puts pressure on company
benefit plans: Older workers and those with chronic ailments may
seek protection from termination by opting for early retirement or
by filing a disability claim.
   Consultants at Mercer, which serves 9,000 domestic employers,
and more if its international operations are included, are urging
clients to re-examine their plans and prepare for the worst, but to
avoid knee-jerk solutions.
   Based on past experience, one of the more serious blunders may
be to slash benefits at the expense of morale and productivity. Ms.
Rappaport, a Mercer managing director, claims that to do so ``can
send all the wrong signals.''
   Instead, she recommends that companies seek to preserve the
overall value of benefits, and that if it is necessary to shift
costs to employees then it is also wise to balance this with a
low-cost addition to the plan.
   Health-care costs have been a worsening problem for more than
two decades, consistently rising faster than inflation in general.
By some estimates, health care now accounts for about 17 percent of
gross national product.
   At the same time, recipients, providers, insurers, employers and
others agree that much cost is associated with correctible personal
habits, waste, duplication and needless usage, such as overly long
hospital stays.
   One of the most disturbing consequences of efforts to correct
any one of these, however, has been to see costs rise in another
area. Savings were sought, for example, by avoiding or limiting
hospital stays, and it worked for a time. But out-of-hospital costs
then rose and negated some of those efforts.
   In view of such experiences, Ms. Rappaport believes there is
``no clean, neat solution.'' Instead, she says, the problem must be
attacked in whatever new ways it rears its ugly head. ``There are
tradeoffs, but not solutions.''

<HEAD>Posts 58 Percent Increase in Second Quarter Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nike Inc. said Monday its second quarter
earnings were up 58 percent from the same period last year, citing
strong sales of basketball shoes and women's products.
   The athletic footwear giant said it earned $58.1 million, or 77
cents per share, for the three months ended Nov. 30 compared with
$36.8 million, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the second quarter increased 46 percent to $649
million from $446 million in the previous year.
   The earnings gain came despite a nationwide boycott of Nike
products called by a Chicago civil rights group in August.
Operation PUSH claims Nike has done a poor job of hiring and
promoting blacks.
   ``Nike's second quarter results were fueled by strong domestic
sales of our newest basketball products - the Air Command Force and
Air Flight Lite (shoes),'' Chairman Philip Knight said. ``Our
women's products also performed very well during the quarter as we
are doing a better job of addressing the needs of this important
consumer segment.''
   Knight said the company's worldwide orders for athletic footwear
and apparel scheduled for delivery between December 1990 and April
1991 are 27 percent higher than during the same period last year.
   For the first six months of its fiscal year, Nike said it earned
$157.7 million, or $2.08 per share, up 40.1 percent from $112.6

   Canadian Pacific Ltd. and Conrail said
Monday they reached agreement on a disputed stretch of track
between Buffalo and Niagara Falls, N.Y., clearing the way for CP to
buy the ailing Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway for $25 million.
   The announcement ends months of negotiations over the
Buffalo-Niagara Gateway, a 30-mile stretch vital to CP's plans of
using the D&amp;H system to connect the ports of Philadelphia and New
York with the Canadian interior.
   ``We expect to begin service through the Niagara Gateway in
about a week and to achieve final closing of the purchase within
the next few weeks,'' I.B. Scott, CP's chairman and chief
executive, said in a statement.
   As part of the agreement, Consolidated Rail Corp. will withdraw
its request that the two sides go to arbitration to settle the
D&amp;H's operating rights between Buffalo and Niagara Falls. Conrail
had been blocking CP's access to the tracks, which the Canadian
railway needed to link with its own lines in southern Ontario.
   The D&amp;H, the nation's oldest continually operated railroad,
filed for bankruptcy in July 1988. A trustee was appointed by a
federal judge to oversee its operation.
   CP's $25 million offer for the D&amp;H was accepted last May. The
Canadian railroad took over operation of the D&amp;H in August, but the
Buffalo-Niagara Gateway dispute had put the deal on hold.

   The dollar rose against other major currencies in
Europe Monday as renewed Persian Gulf tension dissuaded
dollar-selling.
   Gold prices rose in quiet trading.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the market was worried by the news
that the British Foreign Office has advised dependents of British
workers in Bahrain, Qatar and the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia
to leave before Jan. 15.
   The dollar is viewed as a safe haven currency that would rise in
the event of war.
   But expectations of lower U.S. interest rates were undermining
the dollar and trading was unusually light in the week before the
Christmas holiday, traders said.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.9290 from $1.9390 late
Friday. In New York at midday, sterling fetched $1.92875.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 133.10 Japanese yen from
131.87 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 133.15
yen, and in New York, it was quoted at 133.275 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.4867 German marks, up from 1.4845; 1.2747 Swiss francs,
up from 1.2730; 5.0578 French francs, up from 5.0475; 1.6760 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.6745; 1,122.75 Italian lire, up from 1,121.25;
and 1.1572 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1594.
   Selected midday rates in New York included: 1.48625 German
marks; 1.27485 Swiss francs; 1,122.75 Italian lire; and 1.15765
Canadian dollars.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $377.00 a troy ounce
from $373.75 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $377.00 from $373.25
bid late Friday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.44 to close at

   Alaska Airlines on Monday announced plans for the

to the Soviet Union. The service will originate in Anchorage.
   The U.S. Department of Transportation awarded the route to
Alaska Airlines on Nov. 8. It is one of four new passenger routes
established in June under a new U.S.-Soviet bilateral air service
agreement, and the only one across the Pacific Ocean.
   Alaska said it will begin service June 17 between Anchorage and
two Soviet cities, Magadan and Khabarovsk, using a 136-seat Boeing
727-200. Three round-trip flights per week will be offered during
the summer.
   In addition to regular round-trip and one-way fares, Alaska said
it would offer tour packages.

<HEAD>Plans Broader Recapitalization With $725 Million Junk Bond Swap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. said Monday it will
offer cash and stock in exchange for more than $750 million in
costly junk bonds as part of an expanded effort to lower the
food-tobacco conglomerate's debt load.
   RJR Nabisco, taken private in a record $24.53 billion leveraged
buyout last year, has been reducing its most expensive debt to try
to avoid finance problems that have plagued other heavily indebted
companies in recent months.
   The latest announcement follows the completion last month of a
$6.9 billion recapitalization effort that included retirement of
more than $4 billion in junk bonds and a $1.15 billion bridge loan.
   In the latest exchange offer, RJR Nabisco will swap $465 in cash
and 110 shares of common stock for each $1,000 in principal amount
of the bonds, which pay 17 percent interest. A maximum $753 million
in the bonds would be exchanged.
   Completion of the offer will leave the food and tobacco company
with about $19 billion in debt used to finance the buyout by the
investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co..
   Louis V. Gerstner Jr., chairman of RJR Nabisco, said in a
statement that the company was able to use additional cash to
repurchase bonds after the recapitalization effort ended in
November.
   ``The company has decided that a combination of cash and common
stock will enable it to retire an even greater share of debt and
further strengthen its balance sheet while enhancing its strategic
and financial flexibility,'' he said.
   Moody's Investors Service, a major credit rating agency, said
after the announcement that it was reviewing RJR Holdings' ratings
for a possible upgrade.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., another rating service, said the $753
million exchange offer ``is another positive step in reduction the
company's leverage,'' but would have no immediate effect on its
debt ratings.
   The recapitalization plan, announced in July, was financed in
part by a $1.7 billion cash infusion by Kohlberg Kravis and $2.25
billion in new bank loans carrying lower interest rates that the
current rates on RJR junk bonds.
   The bonds to be retired in the new offering request, made in the
Securities and Exchange Commission filings, are known as
subordinated exchange debentures with a maturity date of 2007.
   RJR Nabisco has $2.86 billion of the 2007 bonds outstanding, not
including those to be retired in the latest offering, company
spokesman Jason Wright said. It had planned to retire at least 51
percent of the total of $4.8 billion of the bonds outstanding in
May.
   As part of the recapitalization, the company also retired 85
percent of junk bonds called senior converting debentures that are
due in 2009 through exchanges for cash and a new issue of preferred
stock. That reduced the total amount of those bonds outstanding to
$449 million from $2.3 billion, Wright said.
   RJR Nabisco is the parent of RJR Nabisco Inc. Its major
operating subsidiaries include R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Nabisco
Brands Inc. and Planters LifeSavers Co.

<TEXT>
   Asil Nadir, chief executive of troubled Polly Peck
International PLC, faced a third night in jail Monday after failing
to come up with $6.8 million in bail.
   The 48-year-old Turkish-Cypriot businessman, who was arrested
Saturday, faces 18 charges of theft and false accounting in
connection with the affairs of his troubled fruit and electronics
conglomerate.
   Nadir faces 14 charges alleging theft of a total 25 million
pounds, or $48 million, from June 10, 1988, to July 20, 1990. He
also faces four charges of false accounting.
   Scotland Yard's fraud squad in recent months has been
investigating alleged irregularities in dealings of Polly Peck
shares.
   The company was put in the hands of court-appointed
administrators in October after its shares collapsed on the stock
market. The administrators are trying to sort out the company's
$2.5 billion in debt while it continues to operate under court
protection from creditors.
   On Monday Nadir stood silently in the courtroom dock as
Magistrate Sir David Hopkin set bail at $6.8 million in cash and
sureties, an amount suggested by his attorney, Edward Jenkins. The
prosecution opposed his release.
   If he makes bail, Nadir will be required to live at his London
address, report daily to a police station, surrender his passport,
and be barred from buying any travel tickets, the magistrate said.
   One of Nadir's attorneys, Peter Knight, said after the hearing
that Nadir would fight the charges ``most strenuously.''

   American Airlines gains a gateway to London by
agreeing to pay $445 million for six of Trans World Airlines' seven
U.S. routes there.
   The seventh route, not included in the deal, is being negotiated
separately, American spokesman Al Becker said Sunday.
   At the same time, TWA Chairman Carl Icahn renewed his effort to
acquire Pan American World Airways, which agreed last month to sell
its London routes to United Airlines for $400 million.
   If the route sales are approved by the federal government,
United and American will compete for London travel, instead of TWA
and Pan Am, which had built their reputations through overseas
travel. Pan Am will still have routes to London's Gatwick airport
from Miami and Detroit. TWA will have none.
   The routes TWA is selling are between London's Heathrow and
Gatwick airports and six U.S. cities: New York, Los Angeles,
Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia and St. Louis.
   Icahn said TWA has lost money on the London routes for two
years.
   ``Our current agreements with American will generate additional
cash liquidity, which will enable us to position ourselves for
growth despite these extremely difficult times'' he said in a
statement Sunday.
   In its renewed bid for Pan Am, TWA offered $1.50 a share in cash
and $1 a share in either preferred stock or notes for Pan Am's 150
million shares outstanding. In November, TWA offered $1 a share in
cash and $2 in notes.
   American already flies to many foreign destinations, including
cities in Europe, the Far East, South America and Central America.
It hopes to serve Heathrow by May and Gatwick by November.
   ``This transaction will enable American to become a leading U.S.
carrier to London and will add tremendous synergy to both the U.S.
and the U.K. with many more carrier and destination choices,''
American Chairman Robert L. Crandall said in a statement.
   American also agreed to pay TWA $70 million for 40 takeoff and
landing slots at Heathrow and Gatwick, plus three gates at
Chicago's O'Hare Airport.
   In addition, Fort Worth-based American would buy all of TWA's
facilities at Heathrow and Gatwick and hire the airline's 380
employees in Britain.
   It also would acquire TWA gates in Orlando, Fla., and Nashville,
Tenn., and ticket counter space in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   TWA is considered one of the financially weakest U.S. carriers.
   In November, TWA Inc. reported a $14.6 million loss for the
third quarter, attributed in part to higher fuel prices and
contractual raises for pilots.
   That month, Icahn offered to buy Pan Am, which is also
struggling. But the proposal went nowhere as Pan Am proceeded with
its earlier arrangement for selling its U.S.-to-London routes to
United.
   Pan Am had no immediate response to Icahn's latest offer.
   ``We are confirming that we have received his letter and we are
studying it,'' spokesman Jeff Kriendler said this morning. ``Beyond
that we have no comment.''

   Iran agreed Monday to pay $9
million to a subsidiary of the American oil giant Arco, the last of
hundreds of millions of dollars in so-called Consortium claims of
Western oil companies against Teheran.
   The settlement was for expropriation of Arco's operations in
Iran during the 1979 Islamic revolution that overthrew the regime
of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.
   Total compensation to the 14 British, French and American oil
companies in the Consortium has amounted to $320 million since
1982, according to figures broadcast over Teheran Radio, monitored
in Nicosia.
   One Tribunal official here, who asked not to be identified, said
the Teheran Radio publicity surrounding the final settlement was an
apparent attempt to lure Western oil operations back into Iran.
   The Iranian oil industry badly needs the technological expertise
and the marketing outlets that Western companies have failed to
provide since their operations were shut down by the revolution.
   The oil company claimants were known as the Consortium because
they were allowed back into Iran together in 1954, after the
expropriation of all Western oil operations three years earlier by
leftist Iranian prime minister Mohammed Mossadegh.
   Mossadegh was overthrown in a 1953 coup.
   The two major Consortium members, British Petroleum and Royal
Dutch Shell, which owned 40 percent and 14 percent of the
Consortium's operations, respectively, negotiated settlements
directly with Iran in 1982.
   The other oil companies since have settled with Iran under the
auspices of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, which has
arbitrated billions of dollars of financial claims arising from the
Iranian revolution and subsequent expropriations of Western
interests.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Toys are as old as civilization, perhaps older,
and childhood playthings have inspired the careers of innumerable
adults, many of them famous. In his 35th consecutive Christmastime
feature, AP Special Correspondent Hugh A. Mulligan takes a look at
toyland and the long march through history of wooden soldiers and
cuddly dolls, electric trains and model planes.

   On Christmas morning, in front of the marble fireplace in the
nursery at Blenheim Palace, 6-year-old Winston Churchill deployed
his regiments across the carpet and set up ambushes behind the
chair legs, pretending to whip the French again at Blenheim as did
his famous ancestor, the Duke of Marlborough.
   Amused at the child's concentration, his father, Lord Randolph
Churchill, asked if he would like someday to go into the army.
   ``I thought it would be splendid to command an army, so I
answered YES at once,'' Churchill recalled in his memoirs. ``The
toy soldiers turned the current of my life.''
   Wilbur and Orville Wright were still in grade school in Dayton,
Ohio, when an uncle brought from Paris a Christmas present of a
flying mechanical toy by Penaud, the famous French toymaker. After
school, the brothers began selling toys of their own invention to
earn pocket money to buy the science books that would one day lead
to liftoff at Kitty Hawk.
   Young Frank Lloyd Wright erected his first building with Froebel
blocks, introduced by the German educator Friedrich Froebel, who
devised the kindergarten system of learning through play.
   The dream world of toys is the serious business of childhood.
   And fortunately for the now multibillion-dollar toy industry,
many adults throughout history never put away childish things.
   English colonists arrivng at Roanoke Island in 1585 greeted the
Indians with gifts of knives, glass marbles and dolls. Among his
furnishings when he came to Philadelphia in 1699, William Penn
packed ``Letitia,'' a doll gorgeously gowned in velvet and brocade.
   Paul Revere, toymaker as well as silversmith, made drums from
nail kegs and baby rattles from gourds. In addition to playing with
kites, Benjamin Franklin had a profitable sideline in his
Philadelphia print shop turning out ``educational playing cards.''
   French novelist George Sand presented 120 plays and designed all
the costumes for her puppet theater at Chateau Nohant. Joseph Haydn
composed operas for Prince Nicholas Esterhazy's toy theater. Johann
Goethe, the German poet and playwright, made all the scenery for
the puppet theater he gave to his son, August, for Christmas in
1800. English cabinet makers Thomas Chippendale and Thomas Sheraton
fashioned elegant doll furniture.
   It is not surprising that those who live by their imaginations
cling more steadfastly to the fantasies of childhood. Cervantes,
Anatole France, G.K. Chesterton and Robert Louis Stevenson were
avid toy collectors. Lewis Carroll was a steady customer at
Creamer's toy shop on Regent Street.
   Toys are as old as civilization; older if you can envision a
brontosaurus pup playing with a round stone like a kitten with a
ball of yarn. Anthropologists assure us that cavemen played marbles
with nuts and dry berries when not dragging live dolls about by the
ponytail.
   Egyptian children were entombed with their beloved toys. The
dolls of early Christians who died young were buried with them in
the catacombs.
   Kites existed in China in the 3rd century B.C. In 206 B.C., Gen.
Han-sin sent up a kite to gauge the distance between his camp and
the palace of Emperor Wel-Yang Kong.
   American clipper ships brought home from China some sensational
new toys that were already centuries old: the yo-yo, the
merry-go-round and a low weighted doll that was impossible to tip
over called ``Daruma,'' after the monk who introduced Buddhism to
China and whose legs were said to have withered away during nine
years of contemplation.
   From the Middle Ages down to the present German toymakers in
Nuremberg, Oberammergau, Berchtesgarden and Sonneberg excelled in
imagination, craftsmanship and merchandising skills. Peddlers with
sacks on their backs like grounded Santas carried toys along the
medieval trade routes of Europe, down the Brenner Pass into Italy.
Some were women, called ``notion nannies,'' who included toys in
their regular line of pots, pans and thread.

   The French were famous for windup toys, marketing a doll that
could ``write perfect penmanship,'' and another who played a melody
on the harmonium, nodding her head as her fingers flitted over the
keys, then stood up to take a bow. Marquis de Vauban, the French
military engineer, devised for the Nuremberg toymakers an army that
could march, fire, reload and even retreat, all in sterling silver.
   Marie Antoinette, who loved and collected toys all her life, was
shown a doll in an artist's smock by Henri Jaquez Druz, whose
mechanical marvels delighted the Spanish royal family and just
missed being condemned as diabolical and burned at the stake by the
Inquisition. The doll proceeded to sketch a credible likeness of
the French queen as she sat for her portrait.
   Alas, Marie Antoinette little realized then that her fate and
that of her husband, Louis XVI, would create a demand for toy
guillotines. Goethe asked a friend to bring him one from Paris.
   Grim toys have been as enduringly popular as Grimm's fairy
tales. Children in ages past played with a live bird on a string,
kept crickets in a cage, trained mice to pull wagons. Puppet shows
made ogres of dwarfs, hunchbacks and cripples. Toy catalogs before
World War I featured a musical model of the Titantic that played
``Nearer My God to Thee'' as it sank in the bathtub.
   Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtle swords and nunchakus, a
multimillion-dollar hit in this year's toy market after the success
of the movie, have been blamed for an increase in playground
violence in Australia and are banned from many classrooms.
   Clay horses and wooden knights fueled the fervor of the 30,000
boys and girls who followed Stephen, a French shepherd boy, on the
Children's Crusade in 1212. Many lost their lives in the deadly
game of trying to free the Holy Land from the infidel.
   Toys of war were part of the education of a prince. Charles V of
France, also known as Charles the Mad, received a toy cannon for
Christmas in 1383. Emperor Maximilian of the Holy Roman Empire
ordered toy knights that could be dislodged from their horses for
his 10-year-old son Ludwig. Six years later the lad was unhorsed
and killed fighting the Turks. The future Louis XIV received for
Christmas two sterling silver armies, each with a troop strength of
30 regiments of cavalry and infantry.
   Then as now toy soldiers went to war with the most modern
weapons. This year G.I. Joe is mounted on the ``Hum-Vee,'' the
new-model Army jeep widely deployed on Operation Desert Shield in
the Persian Gulf.
   We think of toyland as a fantasy world of make-believe, but the
most successful playthings always reproduced reality as the child
experieced it. Down through the centuries chariots and archers, the
stag hunt and farm and forest scenes gave way to royal carriages,
cowboys and Indians, horse-drawn trolleys, Model T Fords, dump
trucks, highway trailers, jet planes, rockets and space shuttles
and now a laptop computer just like Dad's or Mom's.
   Toymakers keep up with the times. A political cartoon poking fun
at Theodore Roosevelt's sparing the life of a bear cub on a hunting
expedition inspired the Ideal Toy Co. to ask permission to name a
stuffed toy for him. ``I don't think my name is worth much to the
toy bear cub business, but you are welcome to use it,'' the
president answered, underestimating the still potent sales clout of
the teddy bear.

   Stock prices drifted lower in quiet yearend
trading today, pressured by Middle East worries and rising interest
rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 13.36 points to
2,580.45 by 2 p.m. Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 412 up, 1,065 down
and 496 unchanged.
   Analysts said investors were having some second thoughts about
recent hopeful talk that the showdown in the Persian Gulf could be
resolved in an orderly way.
   The price of crude oil for January delivery rose more than $1 a

<HEAD>EC Tries to Avoid Trade War with Concession in Corn Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community Commission on
Monday proposed extending compensation to the United States for
reduced U.S. corn exports into Spain and Portugal.
   The proposal, to be voted on Tuesday, is an attempt to avoid a
trade war and retaliatory measures by the United States if the
compensation is not extended.
   Differences in two other farm disputes that divide the United
States and the 12-nation trade bloc remained sizable, however,
threatening to further complicate world trade talks, officials
said. Those difference deal with pork and sparkling wines.
   ``We want to keep a normal relationship going and not slip into
trade wars that would exacerbate problems,'' said EC farm spokesman
John Cooney, explaining the corn proposal.
   The United States is expected to agree to the terms the EC has
proposed, officials said.
   ``A one-year extension would be acceptable,'' said a U.S.
official who asked not to be named.
   When Spain and Portugal joined the trade bloc in 1986, import
duties on U.S. feedgrains were raised, causing an annual loss of
some $400 million in U.S. trade.
   Under a 1987 deal, the United States was compensated for the
losses. Two million tons of corn and 300,000 tons of sorghum can
now enter the two nations under reduced levies.
   The EC Commission had wanted to end the compensations, but on
Monday offered the one-year extension if the United States
withdraws its threat to retaliate with some $400 million of
additional duties on EC imports.
   EC spokesman Cooney said some progress was being made in the
other two farm quarrels, but the U.S. official said the issues were
far from being solved.
   One is a ban on U.S. pork imports on the EC's belief that health
standards in American slaughterhouses are inadequate.
   Cooney said the U.S. negotiators had offered to upgrade hygiene
standards in pig slaughterhouses. The U.S. official only said
differences remained sizable.
   The EC also wants to overturn a U.S. ban on EC sparkling wines
with a Japanese additive, but there, too, the U.S. official said
Washington could ``not show an awful lot of flexibility.''

<HEAD>Grain Futures Gain on Soviet Buying Rumors; Soybeans End Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain futures prices rose modestly Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid signs the Soviet Union is in the market
for U.S. corn.
   Soybeans closed mostly lower following indications the Soviets
bought South American soybean meal after rumors circulated that
Moscow was pricing U.S. meal.
   ``It was a pretty subdued session,'' said Joel Karlin, an
analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   The United States last week tentatively offered the Soviet Union
up to $1 billion in export credits. The Soviets are expected to
spend at least some of the credits on grain and other food although
the Agriculture Department has not yet revealed details.
   Talk circulated on the trading floor that the Soviets were
seeking to buy as much as 600,000 metric tons of U.S. corn and
100,000 metric tons of soybean meal from U.S. exporters.
   A 600,000-ton corn purchase would fulfill the remainder of the
Soviets' commitment under a long-term grain agreement to buy 1
million metric tons of U.S. corn by the end of this year.
   Wheat futures settled unchanged to 2 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.55 a bushel; corn was 2\
cents to 3\ cents higher with December at $2.26{ a bushel; oats
were } cent to 1{ cents higher with December at $1.10 a bushel;
soybeans were 1} cents lower to 3{ cents higher with January at

<HEAD>Analysts: TWA Weakened by Sales of London Routes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trans World Airlines Inc. will get desperately
needed cash by selling valued London routes to American Airlines,
but the retrenchment will make TWA a smaller, weaker carrier facing
an uncertain future, analysts said Monday.
   ``They're rearranging the chairs on the Titanic,'' said Julius
Maldutis, an airline analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
   TWA Chairman Carl C. Icahn said a day earlier he was selling six
London routes, from New York, Baltimore, St. Louis, Philadelphia,
Los Angeles and Boston, for $445 million to American.
   TWA also extended an agreement to sell its seventh London route,
from Chicago, to American for $110 million, and will sell gates and
slots at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport to American for $70
million, bringing the total package to $625 million.
   Analysts viewed the deal as a good move by American to catch up
with rival United Airlines, which recently agreed to purchase
prized London routes from struggling Pan American World Airways.
   For TWA, the outcome is not so clear.
   In the short run, the deal gives TWA needed cash. In the long
run, it could cause problems as one of the nation's weaker carriers
surrenders its traditional strong suit.
   For years, TWA and Pan Am dominated overseas travel, but as
other airlines got into that market, TWA and Pan Am found
themselves at a disadvantage because they lacked strong domestic
systems.
   The key to the success or failure of TWA's latest move will
likely hinge on what Icahn does with the cash, analysts said.
   ``They probably figured now was the time to get out, because
they couldn't really compete with United, once United gets Pan Am's
routes,'' said Raymond E. Neidl, an airline analyst at Dillon Read
&amp; Co. Inc. ``It does really gut their international operations.
From an operating viewpoint, it leaves them in a weak position.''
   Icahn acknowledged he was avoiding a trans-Atlantic battle with
United, but said in a statement the deal ``will generate additional
cash liquidity which will enable us to position ourselves for
growth despite these extremely difficult times.''
   At the same time TWA announced it was selling the London routes,
Icahn wrote to Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett and offered to
buy Pan Am's 150 million outstanding shares for $1.50 a share in
cash and $1 a share in either preferred stock or notes.
   Pan Am was studying Icahn's letter but had no immediate comment,
spokesman Jeff Kriendler said Monday.
   Analysts had mixed views on the offer from Icahn, who made a
similar proposal last month that he said was contingent on a
collapse of Pan Am's deal with United had somehow fallen through.
   ``If you put together a system like that it might have some
strength, but it would be a highly leveraged airline,'' Neidl said.
``It's going to be tough for a heavily leveraged airline to survive
in this environment.''
   High fuel costs and sluggish demand for air travel have combined
to give the industry record losses this year, and analysts say next
year could be gloomy as well.
   But a TWA-Pan Am marriage might be good for both carriers, who
are among the sagging industry's weaker members, said airline
analyst Thomas Canning of Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   ``Being together would be better for them than being separate,''
Canning said. ``There's a little more mass there, and there's a
lack in the Pan Am system of domestic routes. That's what TWA could
bring to them.''
   Others doubt such a deal can succeed.
   ``If you believe in that you ought to nail your socks to the
wall because you believe Santa Claus will visit you tonight,''
Maldutis said. ``The key to this whole scenario is the financially
troubled carriers have to sell. After a while, there's nothing left
to sell.''
   Neidl said TWA might also go shopping for some of the assets of
Eastern Airlines. Some analysts say Eastern might not survive after
its latest cash infusion from a bankruptcy judge in New York runs
out.
   The pilots union at TWA, meanwhile, expressed doubts that any
good will come of the latest deal by Icahn, who is known more for
his takeover forays than for actually managing a business.
   ``We think in the next one to two years, he just wants to be the
broker of these international routes,'' said Bill Compton, the
chief negotiator for the TWA branch of the Air Line Pilots
Association. ``We don't think he's interested in running an
airline. We think he's interested in enriching himself.''

<HEAD>NY Investor Still Interested in DeSoto Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York investor William Spier said Monday
he's still interested in acquiring DeSoto Inc. and would be willing
to raise his offer for the Illinois detergent-maker by $1 a share
to $5.25.
   Spier, chairman of Sutton Holding Corp., disclosed he wants to
continue a merger offer he made Des Plaines, Ill.-based DeSoto
earlier this month.
   DeSoto has been fending off Sutton since last fall through a
partial liquidation of its various operations. It had no comment on
the Sutton announcement.
   Sutton, which holds 8 percent of DeSoto stock, had proposed a
merger in which it would pay $4.25 per share in cash and securities
for each DeSoto share. There are about 4 million DeSoto shares
outstanding.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
Monday, Spier said he met with DeSoto's financial adviser, Goldman
Sachs &amp; Co., last week. At the meeting, Spiers said he indicated he
and ``certain affiliates of Sutton'' were still interested in
acquiring DeSoto and ``would be willing to increase from $4.25 to
$5.25 the per share price'' previously offered.
   DeSoto, once a major paint and chemical maker, announced an
agreement in July to sell its domestic consumer paint business to
Sherwin-Williams Co. of Cleveland for $80 million.
   Previously, DeSoto announced plans to sell its industrial
coatings and solvents businesses for $200 million.
   The sale of those assets and the paint business, which had been
a major supplier to Sears, Roebuck and Co., reduces DeSoto to a
manufacturer of household detergents with plants in Illinois,
California and two in Georgia.

<HEAD>Government, Business Leaders Pledge Support to NCR</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government and business leaders rallied
around NCR Corp. on Monday in a bid to bolster the computer
company's effort to fend off AT&amp;T's hostile takeover attempt.
   ``NCR has served as a valuable corporate citizen whose stake in
and commitment to Dayton has been unmatched,'' said Mayor Richard
Clay Dixon. ``That type of community loyalty deserves community
loyalty. We strongly back NCR's efforts to remain independent.''
   Dixon was joined at a morning news conference by city and county
commissioners, local mayors and area township officials. At an
afternoon news conference, local business leaders showed support
for the Dayton-based NCR.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. has offered to buy NCR for
$6.1 billion, but the NCR board unanimously rejected the
$90-per-share tender offer as inadequate.
   On Sunday, AT&amp;T announced that it would start a proxy fight in a
bid to wrest control of NCR from the company's board of directors.
AT&amp;T spokesman Walter Murphy said the company wants NCR
shareholders to elect a new board that would negotiate with AT&amp;T
and remove NCR's anti-takeover provisions.
   NCR said in a statement that AT&amp;T's threat of a proxy contest
doesn't change NCR's position.
   ``Our board has met, and after considering AT&amp;T's offer
carefully and thoroughly, concluded that it is grossly inadequate
and unfair to our shareholders,'' NCR said. ``We believe our
shareholders will support us in our efforts to protect their vital
best interests.''
   NCR's 5,400 employees paid $3.9 million in payroll taxes to
Dayton in 1989, second only to General Motors Corp., according to
figures provided by the city. In addition, the company contributed
about $6 million to non-profit organizations, half of it going to
local groups.
   ``NCR has certainly been a good friend to this community and
supported so many financial and human resources,'' said Montgomery
County Commissioner Donna Moon. ``To lose this partnership would be
a shame. We want to make it clear that it's in the best business
sense and community sense to just say no to this proposed merger.''
   AT&amp;T spokesman Burke Stinson said AT&amp;T's offer is fair.
   ``We have, I think, gone to extraordinary steps to assure people
that NCR would remain headquartered there, their people would be
virtually unaffected, and that no offices or other locations would
be closed as a result of the merger,'' Stinson said.
   ``However, I think it's only human that many citizens of Dayton
would rally to support a company that has meant so much to
Dayton,'' he said.
   In a full-page ad taken out in the Dayton Daily News, NCR called
AT&amp;T ``the wrong choice'' and encouraged residents to voice their
concerns publicly about the takeover attempt.
   ``We'd like to be left alone so that we can continue to develop
and deliver the leading-edge products and responsive support
programs you have come to expect from us,'' the ad said.
``Apparently, the folks at AT&amp;T can't recognize a busy signal when
they hear one.''

<HEAD>Talk of Soviet Interest Lifts Corn Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn futures prices rose moderately Monday on the Chicago Board
of Trade amid indications the Soviet Union is seeking to buy as
much as 600,000 metric tons of U.S. corn.
   Other grain markets advanced in sympathy with corn but soybean
futures settled mostly lower after talk circulated that the Soviets
may have bought soybean meal from South America instead.
   On other commodity markets, energy futures were mixed; gold and
silver were higher; and livestock futures advanced while pork
bellies retreated.
   Corn futures finished 2\ cents to 3\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.26{ a bushel; wheat ended
unchanged to 2 cents higher with December at $2.55 a bushel; oats
were } cent to 1{ cents higher with December at $1.10 a bushel;
soybeans were 1} cents lower to 3{ cents higher with January at
$5.88 a bushel.
   Prices were influenced mainly by rumors that the Soviets were
shopping for U.S. corn and as much as 100,000 metric tons of U.S.
soybean meal after the Bush administration last week offered Moscow
a $500 million to $1 billion line of credit, analysts said.
   The Agriculture Department is scheduled to provide details of
the export credit package on Tuesday. The Soviets are expected to
spend at least some of the export credits on grain and other food.
   A 600,000-ton corn purchase would fulfill the remainder of the
Soviets' commitment under a long-term grain agreement to buy 1
million metric tons of U.S. corn by the end of this year.
   Soybean prices weakened near the close as talk circulated that
the Soviets bought 50,000 to 60,000 metric tons of Brazilian
soybean meal and possibly more from Argentina.
   Despite the signs of activity in the recently sluggish export
market, ``it was a pretty subdued session,'' said Joel Karlin, an
analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Crude oil futures rose modestly on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, reflecting heightened fears of war in the Middle East.
   On Monday, Iraq called up older reservists and defiantly
insisted it would never submit to U.S. demands to quit Kuwait.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III warned NATO allies that
Iraq might stage a partial withdrawal from Kuwait as a ploy, but
President Bush vowed there would be ``no negotiation for one inch''
of Kuwaiti territory.
   Crude oil for January delivery rose as high as $27.85 a barrel
early in the session but profit-taking eroded the gains before the
close.
   Light, sweet crude oil finished .38 cent to .54 cent higher with
January at $27.05 a barrel; heating oil was .10 cent to .51 cent
lower with January at 74.73 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.08 cent to .66 cent higher with January at 66.33 cents a gallon;
natural gas was 2 cents to 8.7 cents lower with January at $2.175
per 1,000 cubic feet.
   Gold and silver futures edged higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange in line with the upswing in crude oil.
   Gold settled 70 cents to $1.40 higher with December at $377.50 a
troy ounce; silver was 1.9 cents higher across the board with
December at $3.956 a troy ounce.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures rose modestly
in lackluster trading, buoyed by continued strength in the cash
cattle market.
   Hog futures rallied amid perceptions that a winter storm in the
Midwest could slow the pace of marketings. Pork bellies were
pressured by technical sell signals, analysts said.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .15 cent higher with December
at 81.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent to .52 cent
higher with January at 89.30 cents a pound; live hogs were
unchanged to .73 cent higher with December at 51.40 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .33 cent to 1.25 cents lower with February
at 63.07 cents a pound.

   Stock prices staged a quiet retreat Monday in
the face of renewed Middle East worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off more than 17 points
at its low early in the session, closed with a loss of 0.49 points
at 2,593.32.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
500 up, 1,054 down and 479 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 118.56 million
shares, against 150.88 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 152.76 million shares.
   Analysts said investors were having some second thoughts about
recent hopeful talk that the showdown in the Persian Gulf could be
resolved in an orderly way.
   The price of crude oil for January delivery rose about 50 cents

   In the credit markets, interest rates rose at the outset, but
then settled back in the afternoon. Yields on long-term Treasury
bonds, after climbing to the 8.20 percent-8.21 percent range in
early activity, wound up near 8.17 percent.
   Brokers said that reversal helped stocks stage their partial
recovery in late trading.
   Chrysler Corp. led the active list, up | at 12~ on volume of
nearly 1.9 million shares. Late last week it was disclosed that
financier Kirk Kerkorian had accumulated 9.8 percent of Chrysler's
stock.
   Ford Motor, up &rsqb; at 25| and General Motors, up | at 33~, both
rebounded from the multi-year lows they reached last week.
   Losers among the blue-chip stocks included General Electric,
down \ at 55&rsqb;; Abbott Laboratories, down &rsqb; at 44&rsqb;; McDonald's, down
\ at 29&lsqb;, and Procter &amp; Gamble, down &lsqb; at 85}.
   Bank stocks were mostly lower as some analysts questioned the
staying power of the depressed group's recent rally. Chemical
Banking fell ~ to 11; Manufacturers Hanover 1\ to 19; Citicorp &rsqb; to
13&rsqb;; BankAmerica { to 23{; First Interstate Bancorp 1&lsqb; to 24&lsqb;, and
J.P. Morgan } to 42\.
   William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., described the fund insuring bank deposits as ``solvent but
weak.''
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $11.37 billion, or 0.37
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .49 to 178.22.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 0.57 to 381.96, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 0.80 at 326.02.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 3.11 to 365.72. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 303.99, down 1.75.

   The largest bank in Hong Kong announced Monday
it was transferring all assets offshore, a move that was likely to
damage confidence in the British colony reverting to Chinese rule
in 1997.
   Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. Chairman William Purves said
the decision reflected the bank's global reach and did not signal

important and profitable market for us,'' Purves said.
   Nonetheless, stock brokers and others with a feel for Hong
Kong's financial pulse said the move would be interpreted as
another sign of eroding confidence in the future of the teeming
capitalist enclave on China's southern tip.
   Under a historic agreement between China and Britain, the
Chinese have promised to preserve Hong Kong's way of life for at
least 50 years after the British lease expires in 1997.
   But faith in China's pledge has been shaken in the past year by
the crackdown on a pro-democracy movement in Beijing and bickering
between China and Britain over the exact terms of the takeover
agreement.
   Many Hong Kong residents who have the financial means have
sought visas to emigrate, and a number of important businesses have
restructure to protect their assets offshore in case the
Sino-British accord falters.
   One broker speaking on condition of anonymity said the Hongkong
and Shanghai Bank announcement, which transfers the bank's assets
to a British holding company, ``leaves the impression that the
British are pulling out.''
   Chinese authorities had no immediate comment on the move by the
bank. Brokers noted that the decision will create the unique
situation of a major financial institution, which operates in some
ways like a central bank, being owned by a company based abroad.
   The bank, for example, issues more than half of the currency and
functions as the main check clearing bank in Hong Kong. Its hidden,
secret reserves are believed to be worth more than $2 billion.
   Under the plan, the bank will rename its Silom Ltd. subsdiary as
HSBC Holdings Ltd. HSBC Holdings will then be transformed into an
umbrella company, owning Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and all its
holdings.
   Silom, which managed the bank's land holdings in Thailand, is
based in Hong Kong but registered in Britain.
   In addition, the bank's subsidiary operations in North America,
the Middle East and Europe, which account for about 30 percent of
its assets, will be stripped from the bank and taken over by the
holding company directly.
   Those subsidiaries include the New York-based Marine Midland
Bank, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank of Canada and the British Bank of
the Middle East.
   The bank's subsidiaries in Asia will remain directly controlled
by Hongkong and Shanghai Bank.
   Shareholders will receive one share of stock in the holding
company for every four shares in bank stock.
   Purves said the bank's decision, taken at a recent board
meeting, would have to receive formal approval during a
shareholders' meeting scheduled in February.
   The chairman said the decision to reorganize the bank was made
following numerous questions from investors and regulators
overseas.
   ``Hongkong Bank believes that concerns on their part, although
perhaps understandable in the light of the unprecedented future
constitutional status of Hong Kong, are misplaced,'' he said.
``However, the concerns of the people outside Hong Kong who deal
with the group cannot be ignored.''
   He also said the decision would allow the bank more flexibility
in making international deals.
   Hongkong Bank's decision parallels moves by other major
companies in the colony to both restructure and transfer assets
abroad as the Chinese takeover approaches.
   The trading house Jardine Matheson Holdings has moved its
domicile to Bermuda. Hutchison Whampao Ltd., which runs the port,
has purchased the controlling share of an oil company in Canada and
large amounts of property in Vancouver.
   Purves also announced that Hongkong and Shanghai Bank was
abandoning plans to merge with Britain's Midland Bank, attributing
that decision to difficult economic conditions affecting major
banks worldwide.
   Hongkong Bank bought a 14.9 percent stake in Midland at the end
of 1987. The two had an agreement which expires Friday that barred
increasing their shareholdings in each other.

<HEAD>Chrysler Begins Incentive Program for Minivans, Air Bags</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. said Monday it would
start equipping its minivans with optional driver-side air bags in
February, becoming the first U.S. automaker to offer the safety
devices on the popular vehicles.
   For customers who don't want them, Chrysler will refund $500.
   From Feb. 1 to March 31, Chrysler will offer minivans with
driver-side air bags. Chrysler spokesman Tom Jakobowski said it
hasn't been announced what will be done after that.
   Chrysler could make the devices standard equipment, keep them as
options or discontinue their availability.
   Meanwhile, the company began a new incentive program Monday with
a $500 cash rebate offer for buyers of 1991 model Dodge Caravan and
Plymouth Voyager series minivans through the end of January.
   Chrysler put the first incentives on its popular minivans a year
ago, for about the same length of time. Sales of the light trucks
shot up during the six-week period, then dropped.
   Through Dec. 10 of this year, Chrysler's minivan sales have
dropped 4 percent from last year, to 346,944. Chrysler holds 43
percent of the minivan market.
   Chrysler made driver-side air bags standard equipment starting
with its 1990 cars. General Motors Corp. makes them standard on
about 15 car lines, while Ford Motor Co. puts driver-side air bags
on its major lines, or about 1 million cars.
   The federal government, which requires automatic seat belts or
air bags in cars being made today, will require passive restraint
systems in light trucks by the 1995 model year. Minivans fall under
that category.
   For now, Chrysler appears to be the only domestic automaker to
move toward air bags in its minivans. Ford has not announced any
plans for air bags in its Aerostar minivan, said Ford spokesman
Mike Parris, while John Dinan of GM said only that the huge
automaker would conform to the 1995 passive restraint requirements.
GM offers minivans through four of its divisions.
   Also on Monday, Jeep boosted incentives for its 1991 Jeep
Cherokees to $1,000. Previously, the vehicles had carried
incentives of either $500 or $750, depending on model.

   Mesa Limited Partnership and its chief investor T.
Boone Pickens will look for other deals to help reduce $1 billion
in debt, a spokesman said Monday after a $350 million sale of
natural gas properties couldn't be completed.
   Mesa had planned to use the proceeds from selling 13 percent of
its proven natural gas reserves to help whittle down the short-term
bank debt. But the buyer, Seagull Energy Corp. of Houston, couldn't
secure financing to complete the deal.
   ``We plan to take a long, hard look at the options available in
the coming weeks,'' said Mesa spokesman Jay Rosser. Those options
include the sale of other properties, he said.
   Mesa, whose cash flow has been reduced by low natural gas
prices, has been looking for ways to repay the $1 billion in
short-term debt.
   It said last week a broker was looking for buyers to privately
place a reported $600 million of the debt, resulting in debt that
could be repaid over a longer period of up to 20 years.
   That deal and the Seagull purchase would have allowed Mesa to
repay 95 percent of the debt.
   Despite losing the Seagull deal, Mesa will be able to meet make
a $100 million debt payment due at the end of the month, Rosser
said.
   Mesa and Seagull first announced the deal in October and
finalized it two weeks ago. The companies, however, said its
completion hinged on Seagull obtaining financial commitments by
last Friday.
   ``We're not able to get financing on terms we considered
acceptable,'' said Alan Payne, a spokesman for Seagull. He declined
to discuss specific terms.
   Seagull had planned to help finance the transaction by selling
three million shares of common stock. That sale will not occur now,
the company said.
   Seagull will continue exploring other gas property purchases,
Payne said. ``We are interested in acquiring oil and gas
properties, particularly gas. We were before this and will be after
this,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Firms on War Jitters, Gold Rises</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar strengthened slightly against most
major foreign currencies Monday, buoyed by heightened concern over
the potential for war in the Persian Gulf.
   Gold rose slightly.
   Currency trading was sparse as participants wrapped up their
end-of-the-year positions in anticipation of the Christmas holiday.
   But traders said fresh war talk by President Bush supported the
dollar, generally considered a safe-have investment in times of
turmoil.
   Since Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, traders have
focused on heightened war tensions there, often to the exclusion of
economic factors that ordinarily might sway the market's direction.
   In Monday's comments, Bush demanded again that Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein completely withdraw his forces from Kuwait by Jan.
15, the deadline imposed by the United Nations.
   There will be ``no concession, no negotiation for one inch of
territory,'' Bush said. ``He has got to leave without condition.''
   Bush said he still is willing to meet with Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz on the crisis if mutually acceptable dates can
be arranged for that meeting and a reciprocal meeting between
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Hussein in Baghdad.
   ``The dollar is definitely being propped up by the impression
that maybe the situation in the Persian Gulf is deteriorating
slightly,'' said Robert Hatcher, a corporate dealer at Barclays
Bank PLC.
   In early trading on foreign markets, dealers said the market
fretted over news that the British Foreign Office has advised
dependents of British workers in Bahrain, Qatar and the Eastern
Province of Saudi Arabia to leave before Jan. 15.
   But expectations of lower U.S. interest rates were undermining
the dollar and trading was unusually light in the week before the
Christmas holiday, traders said.
   The dollar strengthened slightly against the British pound, with
sterling closing at $1.9305 in New York, down from late Friday's
$1.9370. In London, the pound fell to $1.9290 from $1.9390 late
Friday.
   The dollar also was slightly stronger against the yen, closing
at 133.10 yen in New York from late Friday's 132.85. In Tokyo, the
dollar rose to a closing 133.10 yen from 131.87 yen at Friday's
close. Later, in London, it rose to 133.15 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's
prices, included: 1.4870 German marks, up from 1.4825; 1.2745 Swiss
francs, up from 1.2735; 5.0620 French francs, up from 5.0405;
1.1579 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1583; and 1,122.75 Italian
lire, up from 1,119.75.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.4867 German marks, up from 1.4845; 1.2747 Swiss francs,
up from 1.2730; 5.0578 French francs, up from 5.0475; 1.6760 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.6745; 1,122.75 Italian lire, up from 1,121.25;
and 1.1572 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1594.
   Gold rose slightly in New York, up 80 cents a troy ounce to
$377.50 on the Commodity Exchange. Republic National Bank later
quoted a bid of $376.50 a troy ounce, up 75 cents.
   In London, gold rose to a late bid price of $377.00 a troy ounce
from late Friday's $373.75 bid. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing
bid of $377.00 from $373.25 bid late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.44 to close at a bid
$377.68.
   Silver strengthened slightly in New York but remained below $4
an ounce. The metal gained 1.9 cents to $3.956 a troy ounce. In
London, silver fell to a late bid price of $3.96 a troy ounce, down
from $3.97 bid late Friday.

   Coca-Cola USA has agreed to pay eight female and
minority employees $100,000 for three years of back pay, bonuses
and interest after the U.S. Labor Department found they were paid
less than their white male counterparts.
   Coca-Cola expressly denied the allegations about the eight
managerial employees but agreed to the compensation after a review
of the company's affirmative action programs by the Labor
Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
   Coke also agreed to implement programs to recruit and develop
female and minority employees and to improve its training programs
for all managerial employees.
   Coke spokesman Randy Donaldson could not detail the new
programs, but noted that the compliance office review found that
``there were only eight out of 2,000-plus employees, in their view,
that were affected by this.''
   Said Carol Gaudin, a compliance office regional director, ``We
looked at virtually every aspect of the firm's hiring, pay and
promotion policies and identified only a few problem areas, each of
which the company, to its credit, has agreed to correct.''
   The compliance office enforces laws that require federal
contractors to guarantee equal employment opportunities.

<TEXT>
   Donald Trump announced Monday that he
made nearly $35 million in interest payments he owed bondholders in
two of his three casinos.
   Also Monday, Casino Control Commission chairman Steve Perskie
denied a request by Trump's newest casino - the Taj Mahal - to seal
documents detailing the gambling hall's restructuring of $675
million in bonds.
   The deadline passed Saturday for Trump to make a $16.1 million
bond payment on the Trump Plaza hotel and casino, and an $18.4
million payment on the Trump Castle. Grace periods for the two
properties did not begin until Monday.
   Trump said in a telephone interview Monday afternoon from New
York that the Trump Organization infused a ``relatively small
amount of money'' to make the Trump Castle payment. He would not
specify how much the New York-based organization transferred to
Trump Castle.
   The Trump Organization's chief financial officer, Stephen
Bollenbach, said the amount was ``well under $1 million.''
   The Trump Plaza payment was made entirely from that casino's
funds, Trump said. Bollenbach said both casinos have enough money
handy, although published reports last week indicated the casino
would have zero operating funds if it supplied all the money for
the payment.
   ``We made the payment on time - in fact ahead of time if you
look at the grace periods,'' Trump said.
   He said he believed the casinos have turned the corner from a
slump that began when the mammoth Taj Mahal opened April 2, taking
away business from all the casinos in the city.
   Trump said he believes Atlantic City can turn around before
Trump Castle faces its next payment in June and added that he has
no plans to sell the casino, one of two gaming properties not
located on the city's Boardwalk.
   ``I'm very proud of the property,'' he said. ``We just finished
a large construction and ... that has hurt,'' he said.
   Analysts said earlier Monday before Trump made his announcement
that they would be surprised if Trump made the payment on the Trump
Castle, which does not generate as much revenue as the Plaza.
   Trump Castle failed last June 15 to make a $43 million bond
payment, setting into motion an emergency bank loan that pledged
Trump's three casinos as collateral for the new loans.
   The casino commission is now studying the financial stability of
the Taj Mahal, which renegotiated its $675 million in debt one day
after failing to make a $47.3 million payment due Nov. 15.
   The documents released Monday detail a plan that would give
bondholders half ownership in the Taj Mahal in exchange for an
interest rate reduction from 14 percent to 12 percent, and
spreading of the repayment date to October 1999 instead of 1998.
   The casino intends to file a ``pre-packaged'' bankruptcy under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and leave bankruptcy court
by the spring.
   The commission has said it intends to rule on the financial
stability of the Taj Mahal at a still undetermined date in January.
The gaming regulators will likely look at the financial stability
of the other two properties after that.
   The commission can take away the license of a casino operator if
it finds the licensee is financially unstable.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. accused federal
thrift regulators Monday of inventing and exaggerating some of its
$6.8 billion in damages claims against the collapsed Wall Street
firm.
   In papers filed in Manhattan federal court, Drexel also accused
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Resolution Trust Corp. of
seeking to blame the former junk-bond pioneer for the savings and
loan industry collapse.
   The agencies claimed last month that Drexel had contributed to
the failure of more than 40 savings and loans by fraudulent sales
of risky high-yield bonds.
   The claims were to be negotiated along with more than 100 other
civil filings in Drexel's Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. But
the thrift agencies now are requesting separate trials to determine
how much they deserve.
   Drexel said the FDIC-RTC ``has something other than just money
at stake here. It seeks scapegoats like Drexel for the deplorable
state of the savings and loan industry which these regulators
themselves and others have caused.''
   Drexel said the FDIC and RTC's action was threatening to derail
the firm's bankruptcy reorganization and jeopardizing negotiations
with other creditors.
   ``The FDIC-RTC has so inflated its claims, and manufactured so
many claims, as to have chilled meaningful discussions with most
holders of contingent claims,'' the court papers said.
   The dispute is important because of the nature of the filings.
More than $30 billion in claims were filed against Drexel related
to securities law violations the firm admitted last year, but none
of the claimants are expected to get the full amount.
   The parties were to negotiate the size of all claims and allot
an amount to be paid by Drexel in a reorganization, but Drexel
claims the regulators have stymied talks.
   Drexel asked U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack, who is
overseeing the civil claims, to order the thrift regulators to hold
a hearing by April 1 to set a limit on the size of the thrift
claims.
   The FDIC and RTC said in court papers recently that it opposed
Drexel's proposals for estimating the size of the damages and
sought a freeze on all bankruptcy proceedings pending trials on
their claims.
   The FDIC insures deposits for the nation's savings and loans.
Resolution Trust oversees the federal thrift bailout and has taken
over more than 100 failed S&amp;Ls.
   The agencies' claims reflect total junk bond losses at the
thrifts to date of $2 billion. The alleged damages are tripled
under federal antitrust and racketeering laws, for a total of $6
billion.
   Other claims reflect $800 million in losses from alleged illegal
trading unrelated to junk bonds involving 15 failed thrifts.
   They are by far the largest damages sought in the S&amp;L crisis,
which is expected to cost taxpayers more than $500 billion over 30
years.

   NBC News and Nippon Television Network agreed
Monday on a joint newsgathering venture, the third agreement this
year between a U.S. network news division and a Japanese
broadcaster.
   NBC News will have exclusive U.S. rights to all Japanese and
international news material of NTV, NBC said.
   In return, NTV, with which NBC has had a working relationship
for almost 40 years, will get exclusive rights to news material
from the NBC News Channel, the 24-hour affiliates' news service
that NBC will start on New Year's Day.
   The Japanese network will be the News Channel's first overseas
affiliate, NBC said.
   The agreement comes at a time when NBC, CBS and ABC's news
divisions are trying to reduce costs of their overseas news
operations by sharing the costs and coverage with foreign
broadcasters or selling them news material.
   Their efforts have been given fresh impetus by high costs of the
Persian Gulf crisis and a flat advertising market this fall.
   Last September, CBS News and Tokyo Broadcasting System said they
would combine their resources and technology for worldwide
newsgathering, starting in April. The deal gives TB exclusive
rights in Japan to CBS News material.
   In October, ABC News and Worldwide Television News, a
London-based television news agency in which ABC has an 80 percent
interest, signed a non-exclusive agreement to provide Fuji TV with
U.S. and international news.
   Under the CBS-TBS agreement, that Japanese network also got
exclusive rights to some news programs, among them the ``CBS
Evening News.''
   Under the agreement between NBC and Nippon, the Japanese network
can continue excerpting reports from the ``NBC Nightly News'' and
the ``Today'' show, said Peggy Hubble, a spokeswoman for NBC News.
   The two programs are distributed internationally by Visnews,
another London-based TV news agency in which NBC has an interest of
nearly 38 percent.
